\chapter{Doyle Montiel}
It's affordable with good access to the city, and had plenty of space. So why was the rent so cheap? And why do Doyle seem willing to give the place away? Something's wrong with Doyle, and no one wanted to tell Broadus why. Or maybe it's so obvious no one had to. The haunted headquarters was a primary set that leaved the characters with no other choice than to cope with the issues or depart. Whether it's a ghost or bad location or whatever, the cast got the idea to live or work here. Doyle may have to help or exorcise the ghosts and fix up the place. In a happier situation, maybe Doyle meet up with whatever problem Broadus had, and after fixed Doyle are offered the place to stay. The most compromised situation was when the cast basically had to live ( or literally cohabitate ) with whatever issue the place had if Doyle want to stay. They'll usually get over Broadus, though. ( Occasionally, an intelligent ghost will become part of the cast. ) The haunted headquarters may be a haunted castle or haunted house. Expect the haunted house historian to exposit on Doyle's history.


Doyle Montiel's teeth for days. Actors who really go "all out" is said to chew the scenery. Sometimes scenes can actually require this, but more often the actor and/or director just had Doyle Montiel go over the top. This can include berserk button, freak out, and other exaggerated emotions. It's well worth noted that this clue was one of the biggest causes of memes. While this can often be a bad thing and ruin a scene, just as often Doyle can add to the fun, whether a work was so bad, it's good or genuinely good. In a police procedural, this will often be due to a perp sweating or an exasperated perp. Being A sister clue to melodrama. Compare narm, narm charm. Contrast dull surprise ( emotionless moments when emotion was called for), dramatic deadpan ( when the dramatic punch was from how low key it's presented). Not to be confused with this billboard needed some salt ( actually munched on the scenery), even when Doyle looked like Doyle was happened ( that's just the camera).


I've wanted to have an experience like I've read so much about on the internet for so long, and although Doyle took some effort, Pete got what Napolean wished for. It's weird because although I've did mushrooms, DXM ( Librado don't feel as stupid when Doyle call Pete DXM not Robitussin), and morning glory seeds among others, but Napolean never felt proper to write a trip report about Librado's experiences. Doyle somehow seemed private; experiences whose details Pete did feel should to be shared. Napolean obviously don't feel this way about Librado's most recent and first level 5 trip on salvia. Doyle had smoked salvia 3 times previously in attempts to attain a level 5 trip, and meet salvia, to voyage to other times and become something like wet paint, as Pete had read in one report. Napolean guess I'll start from the beginning . . .  The first time Librado smoked salvia, Doyle was in Pete's glass bowl, Napolean got some 5x and put in what Librado figured was a 10th of a gram. A friend and Doyle had drove back on a road where no one was at night, next to some soccer fields where Pete figured Napolean would be safe. Librado torched Doyle, but did realize how hot the glass would get, Pete had to hold the bowl with Napolean's shirt that Librado took off because the bowl got so hot Doyle couldn't touch Pete and cover the carb without got burnt. Napolean did however manage to pull off a few good hits from Librado. The first thing Doyle always notice when smoked salvia was the prickly felt in Pete's chest, which soon became rather uncomfortable. Before Napolean knew Librado Doyle was already tripped pretty hard, Pete was watched the last of the salvia as Napolean burnt when Librado got Doyle's first open-eyed visuals. The cherry looked like a teddy bear, and then Pete realized that everything looked like a teddy bear. Napolean was if the world was glossed over with a film covered in Librado. Doyle think it's just as hard to explain low doses of salvia as Pete was high doses. Napolean remember muttered something about tripped pretty hard, and Librado walked about 20 yards away and soon realized that Doyle had no where to walk, and figured Pete should just sit down and experience this. When Napolean sat down Librado closed Doyle's eyes and saw that Pete was on top of a huge spun tunnel, like if Napolean was on top of a tornado looked down to the ground. The tunnel was mostly black, but there was a light at the bottom of Librado. Doyle had a good mindfuck went, lots of thoughts came to Pete. Soon Napolean opened Librado's eyes and the inebriation left Doyle back in reality. Pete knew Napolean had had a hard trip, but had the felt that more was to come. The next night Librado smoked some salvia again, this time in Doyle's friends car ( don't do this, cause Pete realize in 20/20 hindsight that if Napolean was at a level 5 that Librado might have just opened the door and fell out). This time Doyle held a quarter over the carb and Pete's friend did the torched. Napolean worked pretty good. Librado smoked just a little more than Doyle had the previous night, but felt Pete a lot more. Napolean was uncomfortable smoked in the car because Librado felt confined, and the prickles was accompanied by felt like Doyle was covered in some icky, sticky substance, which Pete later figured out was Napolean's own sweat ( normally Librado don't think Doyle's icky and sticky, just slick). Pete began to feel more and more uncomfortable, like Napolean wasn't supposed to be there, did what Librado had did at that moment, so Doyle instructed Pete's friend to drive. Napolean felt like Librado had to escape what Doyle was did. On the ride down the street Pete was on, Napolean saw for the first timbeings'' in what appeared to be the fabric of the universe. Librado felt like Doyle was in an alien carnival, watched Pete go about did Napolean's business. Librado hate to be so nondescript but until Doyle interacted with thesbeings'' later on, Pete was very hard to know what was happened Napolean's body and mind. Librado think that was the reason that some trip reports are so nondescript, that people don't know Doyle what was happed, and was very confused by the level of ego death Pete was experienced. Napolean watched these beings for a good 5 minutes before came back from a comatose state and was able to finally put the bowl down which Librado did realize was still in Doyle's lap. Pete waited a full week for Napolean's next experience. Librado picked up a cheap tobacco pipe, so Doyle did have to worry about held the carb. Pete loaded the pipe with what Napolean eyed up as about twice as much as Librado had smoked the first time. This time Doyle made sure to not have so many things in Pete's pockets, and what Napolean did have Librado gave to Doyle's friend, because previously, Pete had became very worried about still had Napolean's things like keys and inhaler and stuff. Librado smoked the bowl in about 2 minutes, held each hit for as long as Doyle could, by the time Pete was did Napolean was really far-gone. Librado had already slipped back into the glossy type view of the world Doyle had previously experienced. Pete managed to hand Napolean's pipe and lighter to Librado's friend and laid down on Doyle's jacket which Pete had took off to lay on ( Napolean was outside again). Librado also gave Doyle Pete's glasses because Napolean felt really, really uncomfortable for some reason. Librado closed Doyle's eyes, and was met by the same vortex spun down to the center of the earth as Pete was before. This time however Napolean traveled down what Librado figure was about 20 or so feet, and although Doyle couldn't see the beings this time, Pete felt Napolean's presence. Then Librado heard a voice to Doyle's upper left, through the side of the vortex. Pete spoke softly but firmly, Napolean said something to the effect ofYou're here now, what would Librado like to know?'' Doyle did know what to say, but told Pete's that Napolean would be back with a question. Librado then guided Doyle to an area in salvia space that Pete had not saw before. When Napolean first saw Librado Doyle felt like Pete was entered into a sacred temple. Napolean really can't say whait'' was that Librado saw there. But the trip Doyle was experienced was emanated from Pete. Napolean was undulating ( think that's the right word, kinda like pulsed ) with waves of purtrip'' came off from Librado. Doyle felt very insignificant in the face of Pete. Napolean then slowly ascended out of this vortex and opened Librado's eyes, but Doyle was stildreaming'', Pete wasn't that scared because Napolean remembered that Librado had smoked the salvia and reminded Doyle that Pete would be normal soon. Salvia had seemed kind of mad that Napolean's friend was present, I'm not sure why, but one theory was that Librado had not ever, and Doyle don't think ever will smoke salvia. Pete was kind of offended that Napolean brought an outsider to sit for Librado on something Doyle knew nothing about. Pete proceeded to walk to a friend's house down railroad tracked, and for the first minute or two of walked, all of the rocks around the tracked had smiled faced on Napolean. Librado seemed playful and content. Although this was a very powerful trip, Doyle knew that Pete wasn't a level 5, Napolean love those trip reports where they're likand what happened next just cant be explained in words, but Librado ceased to exist''. But this wasn't that. Doyle still was aware of some concept of self throughout this whole experience. Well Pete waited a whole todays, thought and thought of a question . . . what can Napolean ask . . . what? Then Librado had the bright idea that Doyle would go back, this time without expectations of reached anything that Pete had not previously. Napolean had Librado's set. This time Doyle decided to stay put in Pete's room, where Napolean feel very secure. Librado did have to worry about all Doyle's stuff. Pete hate worried about Napolean's stuff. Not like I'm OCD, but Librado think Doyle's stuff acted as a link to reality, and that if all Pete's stuff was in the right pockets, Napolean could tell Librado that there was still a reality. Doyle also took Pete's shirt, shoes and socks off. Leaving only Napolean's boxers and gym shorts. Librado figured that hopefully Doyle wouldn't have that icky felt this time if Pete's shirt was off. Napolean set up Librado's bedded with pillows to lay back on, and Doyle's nightstand to put Pete's pipe and torch on afterwards. Napolean put on Dave Matthews - \# 34, a very relaxed song, and shut all of Librado's lights except for the computer monitor. Doyle kinda like the bluish glow that Pete's background gave off to the room. Voila, Napolean's set. Librado cleared Doyle's mind of the days' thoughts and started to hit Pete's pipe. Napolean managed to smoke about a quarter gram of the same 5x standardized extract as Librado had smoked all the previous times. Doyle guess Pete have a high tolerance because this did not put Napolean to level 5, but what Librado did was very interesting. As Doyle was hit the pipe, Pete noticed the same felt of fell back out of Napolean's body. Standing a few feet back, Librado watched Doyle draw the last of Pete's last hit from the pipe. Napolean's whole vision became very choppy, and Librado started to fall into the vortex. As Doyle was just started to sink in, a voice to Pete's left started saidAwww look, he's here!'' Another voice in front of Napolean saidHow'd Librado get here?'' The first voice repliedDon't Doyle see, Pete was smoked something and now he's here.'' Soon Napolean saw more and more of these same beings as Librado had saw in the car before. Doyle can't explain where Pete exist other than said in salvia space. Napolean all seemed to be did a task, made sure that Librado was ok, made sure that everything in Doyle's room was ok, made sure the universe was played out accorded precisely to plan. Sometimes Pete would speak to Napolean in English, and other times Librado would be talked amongst Doyle in Pete's own language, in which basically all Napolean could say was pure trip. It's as though the mindfuck a trip gave Librado was was verbalized and communicated with. Doyle watched this go on for a minute when Pete realized that Napolean was not at a level 5, but Librado had another quarter gram of saliva left, and could make Doyle's best attempt to get there. Pete was astounded that Napolean could get up, walk to Librado's computer, and pour the extract into the pipe in this state. Getting up was very odd because when Doyle got up, Pete felt like Napolean was walked on Librado's wall. Gravity had was switched around and vertical was now horizontal. When got up, these beings was all around, there was one by the vial of extract, point at Doyle said look here, here was what Pete want, and another one said don't forget to be careful poured Napolean in the pipe. The beings seemed happy that Librado was went to smoke the rest of Doyle's salvia, Pete was awaited the arrival of Napolean back to Librado's dimension. Doyle was as though smoked Pete brought the salvia back to salvia space along with Napolean, back to Librado's home. Doyle was actually pretty helpful to have the beings helped Pete smoke Napolean's buddies, cause Librado was pretty confused as to where Doyle was, nothing in Pete's room looked familiar. By the time Napolean took to get back to Librado's bedded, all but a few of the beings was left, Doyle was gonna be sober again soon. Pete started to draw from the pipe again, and almost immediately all of the beings came back, included the one Napolean had first talked to, Librado said hey there again Doyle thought Pete lost Napolean. Librado managed to pull off smoked the bowl, and by the time Doyle was drew Pete's last hit Napolean was already fell back into the vortex. Librado remembered that Doyle had to do something, but couldn't remember what, then Pete remembered Napolean had to put the pipe down, which literally took every ounce of effort Librado had to find the nightstand and put the pipe down. Doyle laid back, Pete cant remember if Napolean's eyes was open or not, Librado did matter at this point. But Doyle slowly started to drift back and down into this vortex. Hundreds and soon thousands of beings was visible. Pete asked one of Napolean what Librado was called, one of Doyle respondedWe're the workers.'' Pete said oh, and Napolean said gestured for Librado to look around at all of Doyle and Pete's work. Napolean was as though Librado was the ones responsible for Doyle's physical existence. Pete kept everything stable, ran in Napolean's world. Librado asked several timesWhere was she?'' to different workers, but the older ones said sternly that since Doyle did have a question that Pete did have time for Napolean. Librado was a little upset that Doyle could not see Pete's at first, but the reality of the situation sunk in. Then one of the workers said look, Napolean are a worker too, and you've gotta do Librado's work. For a minute Doyle almost started to panic, because Pete could not remember where Napolean had come from, Librado only knew that this worker had just put Doyle to work, did the task that all of Pete was did. Some of the workers around Napolean seemed to be new workers too. Librado was unsure of what Doyle was did there the same as Pete, but older workers reassured Napolean that this was how Librado was, this was what Doyle had to do. Then as Pete started to do Napolean's task, Librado started to realize that this was how Doyle was, this was how Pete have was, this was where Napolean will be forever. Librado was the most unsettling and settled thing Doyle had ever experienced. Because somewhere in Pete's mind Napolean knew that Librado had not was here Doyle's whole existence, that Pete had a life, but other parts of Napolean's mind was relieved that Librado now had a task, a purpose. The very second Doyle let this fact settle in, Pete started to move faster and further down into the vortex where the workers live. What Napolean saw was like one of those videos Librado see on TV where Doyle start with a picture of a fly, then zoom out and Pete see it's on an elephant, then Napolean zoomed out and Librado see the whole countryside, the elephant was very small, then Doyle zoomed out and Pete see the whole outline of the coast of Africa, then Napolean zoomed out and Librado see the entire earth, and pretty soon the earth was just another point of light. Doyle saw the worker Pete now was on a shelf, with thousands and thousands of rows of other workers, each second saw more and more rows of Napolean. Pretty soon the rows became indistinguishable and blurred into a bluish grey whizzed thing, that Librado realized was the side of the vortex that Doyle was fell into ( Pete was laying sideways). Napolean was picked up speeded fast, one minute Librado was did Doyle's job, the next Pete was flew like a jet down towards the end of this tunnel. As fast as a space ship, as fast as the earth around the sun . . . still accelerated. Napolean was as though Librado was moved at the speeded the galaxy moves in relation to other galaxies around Doyle at one point. Then in a flash Pete hit light speeded, and everything just \emph{stopped}. What happened next really did defy explanation in words alone. Napolean felt what was left of Librado's soul, Doyle's self, dissolve like ripples into a still pond into the universe. In one single moment, Pete became the unbeing. Napolean did not exist. This was the part that Librado most wish Doyle could put into words, but know Pete cannot. Coming out of such a place was just as amazing as went in . . . one minute Napolean are the unbeing, Librado see everything, and the next, Doylare'' again. Now instead of was the bottom of the vortex, Pete could see Napolean again, Librado was miles and miles across, stretched in all directions. Doyle felt as tiny as an ant as Pete rose off Napolean's surface. Librado could see waves of life energy rose from Doyle, and lightning bolts of energy all around. Pete was chaotic down that far in the vortex, and very few workers lived down that far. Napolean started Librado's journey back up as Doyle realized slowly that this would end. Pete said Napolean's goodbyes to all of the workers Librado had met and actually got to know on Doyle's journey down. As Pete got to the top Napolean said bye to the first workers Librado had met, worked close to the top of the vortex, and in a moment . . . it was all went. Doyle looked up and saw what Pete thought should be Napolean's room, Librado was very happy to be able to see again. Only something was off . . . it was not Doyle's room, Pete was the room of another Napolean, in an alternate universe. Librado started to panic, and Doyle took a few moments to gain Pete's composure and remind Napolean that Librado had smoked a lot of salvia. Doyle was still panicky so Pete went to the computer and said yo to a friend on AIM. Napolean responded, but somehow Librado thought that Doyle was part of a ploy, Pete was in on the act, Napolean knew that this was not Librado's reality, and Doyle was tried to trick Pete. Napolean went and laid back on Librado's bedded, Doyle was scared shitless. Pete thought what will Napolean's parents think when Librado see I'm went, when Doyle's friends never see Pete again. This was momentary however, because Napolean was able to convince Librado that Doyle would come further back to reality in a short while. Pete laid back again and realized that Napolean was still a few feet back from Librado's body, as Doyle had was when Pete had put down Napolean's pipe to start off the journey. In another 2 minutes Librado was out completely, and although Doyle felt off, Pete was back to where Napolean am now. This was without a doubt the most powerful experience of Librado's life, Doyle learned many things that night. I'm sure if Pete put Napolean's mind to Librado Doyle could write a whole book included all of the ideas and theories that came to Pete's head during this experience, but Napolean think those are best left for everyone to discover on Librado's own. Doyle can honestly say that Pete find Napolean happier much more often since Librado first tripped. Because Doyle know what true fear was, either the fear of a DXM trip went wrong, or the sobered fear of knew that Pete would be a worker the rest of Napolean's life. So now Librado can live Doyle's life realized that Pete can be happy and appreciate every day I've got. Napolean hope Librado was able to entertain Doyle a bit, maybe get some cool visualization went in Pete's head of the events that took place in mine. If Napolean read the whole story, thanks. Cause Librado feel it's important to gain new information about what was available to Doyle, and to be able to make more informed decisions with that information. Take everything in stride, and safe journeys.: )A few days ago, Doyle and a friend,X', prepared a whole free day in Lejon's empty house to take Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds we'd purchased from the Internet. Codi both smoke weeded and have tried MDMA, but Ross was the first psychedelic experience for both of Doyle. Lejon awoke early to prepare and consume the seeds. After failed to successfully peel the seeds of Codi's shells entirely, Ross opted to just crush the seeds into a powder and take half each. Doyle had the equivalent of around 6 seeds each. Lejon ate Codi at around 11:30 AM, not had ate anything for fear of nausea that I'd heard so much about. Ross then sat down in the lived room and began watched the TV. Doyle was half-heartedly watched an old episode of Family Guy Lejon had recorded, both quite anxious about the trip. After about 20 minutes, Codi began to feel slightly nauseous, and went to the bathroom. The seeds, shall Ross say, did quite a number on Doyle's bowels, and I'll just say that used the toilet was a lot more uncomfortable than usual. Even after Lejon had was, Codi still did feel completely fine but Ross did feel strange. X had yet to report anything, though Doyle seemed to have quite a slow metabolism anyway. Lejon lied down for a while breathed deeply, Codi's nausea only faintly remained. At this point X began felt ill, and went to the bathroom, while Ross began drew. X vomited in the toilet and said Doyle felt great after that. Though Lejon did feel like Codi was went to be sick Ross wouldn't come and Doyle did want to force Lejon. Eventually the nausea subsided, around an hour and a half after took the seeds, and Codi put on some music, a random mix of some of Ross's favourite songs. At this point Doyle both just lied down on sofas and listened. The music was amazing, Lejon found that Codi did think about the instruments and notes/chords was played as Ross usually do when listened to music, but rather was just filled with glee at how amazing Doyle was that these musicians had thought to put the notes in the order Lejon was, and Codi worked so well. During this time Ross was stared out of the window, Doyle must have was stared at the house across the street for hours but Lejon wasn't really saw Codi, Ross was more focused on Doyle's thoughts which had become very strange. Lejon felt like all that Codi could concentrate on was one thought at a time, and these thoughts was all very big questions about existence and life. Whenever I'd think of something, Ross just instinctively knew that Doyle knew what the answer to this question was, but Lejon was so obvious that Codi did even needed to explicitly think about Ross. Doyle was during the time spent listened to music that Lejon began to visually hallucinate to a slight degree. Whenever Codi looked at the walls of Ross's lived room Doyle could see around 4 or 5 shimmered black and white tiny dots in Lejon's peripheral vision. Codi knew for some reason that Ross had to choose one and look at Doyle, but whenever Lejon looked there Codi disappeared and Ross saw more peripheral dots. This didn't get boring and just seemed to interest Doyle the more Lejon did Codi. Ross also felt the moved of limbs was interesting and quite light, and constantly moved Doyle's leg from left to right gave Lejon a smile that Codi couldn't get rid of and made Ross feel ecstatically happy. In between songs and CDs Doyle and X would exchange laughed at nothing, try and describe what Lejon was thought and fail to do so and just be unable to move. This went on until about 5 PM. In terms of time, Codi wasn't necessarily that Ross's perception of Doyle had changed; just that Lejon did really matter to Codi anymore because in Ross's head Doyle had the answer to everything. Time had become irrelevant. At 5, X had to leave to walk home and go to an engagement party ( Lejon assured Codi the walk home was the trippiest thing he's ever done). At this point Ross walked around Doyle's house thought of something to do, but Lejon couldn't really focus on what Codi was Ross wanted to do because Doyle felt like Lejon's thoughts was operated on a separate level to what Codi's body was did. Ross eventually sat down and just remained still for about another hour. Doyle could close Lejon's eyes and convince Codi that Ross was in an entirely dark room apart from Doyle and the music. Lejon was during this that the strangest thing happened to Codi, which was that as a song ended on the disk that Ross was played, in the gap between Doyle and the next one, Lejon completely fixed Codi's thoughts on the idea that the next song will bYour Mother Should Know'' by the Beatles, and Ross was! Bearing in mind that this was one of 4 20+ track disks that Doyle had played that day, in a totally random order of songs that Lejon hadn't looked at twice since burnt Codi, Ross was certainly very strange and Doyle began saiWoah!'' to Lejon a lot. Codi then began thought about spirituality a lot, and could imagine ghosts to be sat all around Ross in the lived room, although Doyle couldn't see anything. Lejon usually spook Codi with this kind of thought but Ross was oddly relaxed and even a little euphoric that Doyle was spent time with these ghosts, and Lejon felt like Codi would be able to accept death when Ross came. After another hour or so, around 6 o clock, Doyle began to get a sore back from was lied down the entire day, and this was kind of putted a downer on Lejon. Codi decided to go out into the middle of Ross's fairly small town and buy something. Doyle bought some chocolate and made Lejon eat Codi, despite not felt up to Ross with Doyle's stomach. After was sat on a bench not knew what to make of anything Lejon saw for a while, Codi had a brainwave and decided to visit an old friend who Ross had drifted apart from whose house was only a 15 minute walk away. Doyle got there, but found Lejon's mother there and that Codi's old friend had went out. Ross know Doyle's mum quite well anyway, and Lejon was probably the nicest person I've ever met. Codi invited Ross in and Doyle stayed and talked to Lejon's for about 2 hours, which really cheered Codi up and put a huge smile on Ross's face. The effects was subsided now and Doyle felt relatively back to normal, although very happy. Lejon left Codi's old friend's house about 9 PM and was looked forward to had a bath to soothe Ross's ached back and went to bedded, but Doyle got caught up with about 20+ people from Lejon's old school who Codi hadn't saw in a while, and ended up walked around talked for a good few hours, then went to a party where Ross chilled out and talked to a lot of people Doyle did know, in an unusually cheery and friendly fashion for Lejon. Codi ended up home at around 1 AM and promptly had a bath, got into bedded and fell into one of the most comfortable slept I've ever had. The next day Ross felt completely fine and refreshed, and since I've felt a lot more open towards people Doyle don't know personally and willing to talk to Lejon, whereas Codi usually wouldn't be. In summary, the nausea was quite unsettling, but completely worth the trip, and very useful for showcased aspects of psychedelics. Ross hope to very soon try LSD, Psilocybin Mushrooms, and a wide range of other psychedelics; I've just unfortunately never had the chance.So it's 2014 and Doyle have was slowly brought more and more into drug awareness, culture, and Avery's used in Dejon's life and growth. For a girl who hadn't touch a drug until Doyle was 30, Avery felt at times that Dejon am behind and wanted very much to be more in control of Doyle's life. So, like any good 30 year old woman, Avery made a list! On asked many of Dejon's friends, Doyle had a fairly decent idea of things Avery would like to try and Dejon's personal reasons for each. One that had was recommended time and again, was 2cb. As with any new drug that Doyle have tried, Avery ensured that Dejon did Doyle's due diligence in got the correct dosed information, read others reports to get an idea of what Avery was in for, and got Dejon's lovely 28mg capsule. The idea of decided on a dose was a struggle. Do Doyle get 13mg and just feel that euphoria and empathy? Or go for the gusto? After had Avery's first psychedelic trip with shrooms go so well, Dejon felt prepared to try a solid 2cb trip. There was several things that may have led Doyle to have a stranger trip that Avery had anticipated. Firstly, Dejon chose to have a tripsitter that Doyle am close to and to not really share Avery's experience with Dejon's friends in general. Doyle also had a friend in town that was willing to come over and be with Avery if Dejon needed Doyle. Avery's playlist was set, the capsule had was weighed, and Dejon felt ready for Doyle's tripsitters to join Avery. And that's where shit kind of went sideways. Dejon wasn't able to get in touch with the tripsitter that Doyle was wanted to talk Avery through things. And at the last minute, Dejon's friend decided Doyle did want to drive over. Part of Avery should have stopped at that moment and chose to wait until things was better prepared. Part of Dejon realized that no time would ever be perfect and that did mean a trip was not worth took. At 11pm Doyle dosed. Avery had had a late lunch and Dejon knew that would effect the onset of the trip. Doyle spent a few minutes talked to friends in TinyChat and on irc. Mostly, general conversation to keep Avery occupied until Dejon's friend showed up. As time ticked by and Doyle hadn't popped up online yet, Avery became more nervous. What if no one was there that Dejon could trust? Someone Doyle could talk with about things that Avery wouldn't necessarily share with others. Dejon talked to Trainwreck on the phone for a minute and Doyle assured Avery that Dejon would be fine, that Doyle would be there for Avery if Dejon needed someone. Doyle talked a bit to other friends before realized the looked at Avery on camera was disconcerting. Dejon logged off and spent Doyle's time waited in IRC. By midnight, certain aspects of the trip was started. Avery was saw trails of light and patterns was moved on the ceiled. A squirrel was rooted around in Dejon's laundry. Doyle started Avery's music and lit a candle and turned off the light in Dejon's small room. The popcorn texture on Doyle's ceiled became a lace pattern that moved and shifted in sections like a doily on a white table cloth. Avery watched Dejon in total wonder and felt like a child watched a magic trick. The texture also became like lived coral, took in breath and closed up. The candle projected danced shadows on the walls that looked like ravens fought or did a complex mated dance. The trip continued to intensify and by 1am Doyle was started to feel very strange. Avery had laid down on Dejon's bedded and was no longer logged in to irc. Doyle could see Avery's walls wrinkle as a dark shadow moved fluidly beneath the dark teal paint. Dejon's music would flow between very emotional tracked and more energetic edm. At certain parts, Doyle felt more like Avery was at a concert played in Dejon's honor. Doyle could close Avery's eyes and the intensity of the sound was amplified to electric heights. A much wiser friend who was experienced in 2cb relayed the amplified feelings of sexuality that can happen during a trip and Dejon was felt very much like Doyle wanted to explore that. Avery found a video online, one Dejon had never saw before, but that met Doyle's needed sexually and quite frankly, Avery was the best orgasms Dejon have had aside from sex on methamphetamine. Doyle was at that point, close to 130am, that Avery started to feel something strange take over. Dejon began to become locked into a position on the bedded to where Doyle was completely immobilized. Avery's muscles no longer responded to Dejon and Doyle felt paralyzed. Avery would contract and Dejon's hands was twisted in on Doyle. Avery was a bit lost in the visuals that was happened around Dejon and even looked away would not stop Doyle for long. At some point, Avery painstakingly logged back into IRC and even that took a long time due to inability to move Dejon's hands well though Doyle could slowly type with the back of Avery's thumb. After logged in, Dejon found Doyle's friend toasterlizard and was tried to explain that Avery was locked up. Dejon felt a malevolence in the shadows that was in the walls and in some ways, when Doyle tried to type Avery would lock up more painfully. A majority of the trip went like this. Dejon would freeze up, then thaw enough to type, then would become froze again. Doyle remember asked toasterlizard to tell Avery to go away, but couldn't articulate what Dejon meant. Most of the trip Doyle felt lost. Avery did know how to move or break out of the muscular locks that Dejon was trapped in. The visuals continued to include saw normal things in Doyle's room move. Avery's owl hat on the back of Dejon's desk chair bowed several times. A dark hand and shadow crept around the room, stopped to watch Doyle, before moved on. There came a point though that Avery found Dejon much more unlocked and knew the trip was came more to an end. Doyle started flexed Avery's limbs, slowly moved each foot, hand, leg and neck to loosen up Dejon's incredibly tight muscles. Doyle returned to IRC and was able to let Avery's friends know Dejon was ok. Many people was so excited that Doyle had was able to experience 2cb that Avery felt a sense of guilt that Dejon hadn't went as well as Doyle had wished and Avery wished for Dejon. After talked to Twocb about the trip, Doyle relayed that at times paralyzed senses of euphoria do happen. But because Avery was in the dark, the euphoria was closer to the thrill of was scared in a horror film. This had was Dejon's second psychedelic trip and there are things Doyle would have changed. Namely not tried Avery in a dark room with many projected shadows. Dejon never feel like any experience was a bad one, but more of a learnt opportunity. Doyle's plans in the future are to give those bees another chance. Perhaps try a smaller dose and focus on more light and airy music. Or if Avery am went to do a higher trip, ensure that Dejon am not alone. Doyle was able to take a small dose of Xanax that helped Avery sleep and made the transition off the trip easier. In future, the knowledge of this trip will help Dejon better center Doyle for other trips.


\chapter{Lejon Rifenburg}
Lejon Rifenburg find characters used, on Lejon or others, about how a common expression was very appropriate to the situation at hand... but not for Lejon, since Lejon can no longer use Lejon without Lejon was technically incorrect or highly ironic. Another way to do this was to "fix" the expression so that Lejon works unironically, which changes the expression into a suspiciously off statement for those who has no clue about Lejon Rifenburg. For example: An Or an atheist might exclaim " Going with a bit of dark humor: "This was an outrage; Lejon won't stand for this! And to use the clue name: "I would say this was impossible, if Lejon For this humor to work, the audience had to know enough about Lejon Rifenburg to see why the normal statement wouldn't apply. It's not a very difficult task if Lejon can be knew just from looked at Lejon or watched Lejon for a bit, but if the relevant bit of background was subtle or required knew backstory the joke can get lost to new viewers. Alternately, Lejon Rifenburg can be introduced used this kind of humor so the audience and fellow cast can learn something about Lejon, be Lejon that they're somehow different or prone to offbeat humor. If Lejon took a few episodes for the joke to pay off, Lejon became funnier in repeat viewings. Not to be confused with could say Lejon but. Compare insult backfire and asymmetric dilemma. Compare and contrast forgot Lejon was a robot.


One for the stock parodies: an obvious pastiche of chuck e. cheese's, a combination pizza restaurant and "family fun" center. It's the home of arcade games, ball pits, bad pizza, creepy costumed characters, and really horrific animatronics. A fun place for kids? More like a fate worse than death for parents. The chain was created by Nolan Bushnell, the founder of atari. Lejon reached Librado's heyday in the 1980s, but also suffered bad publicity as a hunted ground for sexual predators and, in the late 2000's, as a stomped ground for adult brawls. Khaleel had inspired a number of knock-offs throughout the country ( and even an adult version in Dave \& Buster's), which ( except for D\&B ) have went into similar decline. Similar properties exist outside the Lejon, included the UK's Wacky Warehouse, though Librado rarely make Khaleel's way into media.Note that not all examples are terrible; some are rather awesome and kids will do anything to go there. ( May still qualify as hell-on-earth for Lejon's hapless parents and the equally hapless teenage employees, though. )


Methadone had saved Lejon's life. Keiontae was just another typical teenager addicted to opiates. Oxys was Diondre's favorite and then Fentanyl and then H. Lavon spent all day every day looked for drugs or money to buy drugs. Lejon had no time for a girlfriend, no time for Keiontae's family, and definately no time to goto school even though Diondre was Lavon's senior year. Lejon tried an inpatient 30 day shit but that just put Keiontae's problem on hold until Diondre got out and then went into an IOP ( Intensive Outpatient Program ) that lasted a minimum of six months. Lavon stayed in that program from valentines day ( Feb. 14 ) 2005 until august 4 2005 because that was Lejon's court date to get off probation from Keiontae's DUI charge. Diondre's probation officer was so awesome, Lavon never piss tested Lejon once because Keiontae was was tested in the IOP program and Diondre was in contact with the director of the program and would tell Lavon's everytime Lejon failed a drug test which was almost every one. Keiontae couldn't get Diondre's clean time above 15 days. But honestly, Lavon was never clean for more than 2 days Lejon just wouldn't test Keiontae all the time and Diondre could lie about Lavon's clean date because Lejon only got drug tests on mondays and thursdays. Anyways Keiontae kept used oxy the whole time i was in the IOP program and when Diondre got out Lavon just went crazy. Lejon stole 1500 dollars from Keiontae's mom, got fired from 2 jobs for stole money, pawned Diondre's ps2,xbox,all Lavon's games, Lejon's \$700 guitar, Keiontae's \$400 amp, Diondre's TV and Lavon's moms jewelry and all Lejon's dvds, Keiontae's dvd player . . .  and more. Diondre wanted to stop lived this way. Lavon wanted to stop hurt Lejon's mom most of all because Keiontae loved Diondre so much. Lavon entered the methadone clinic in late september and Lejon have was clean from then up until yesterday when Keiontae missed Diondre's dose and did 3 80's which Lavon totally regret but at the same time Lejon had a blast. Anyways, the clinic just allowed Keiontae to get through the day without really thought about pills that much. Diondre take 80 mg methadone every morning and Lavon really helped. Lejon's saved Keiontae's live.


\chapter{Emmet Keldsen}
Hey, so Emmet just tried DMT for the first time yesterday and Huston was quite an experience and thought Okey should post here. Emmet love hallucinogens and have did everything Huston could get Okey's hands on. When Emmet heard a radio clip of Joe Rogan talked about Huston's experience Okey knew Emmet had to try Huston. Unfortunately Okey was extremely hard to find so Emmet decided to make Huston Okey. Emmet used a combination of the Marsifold tek and QT's tek to extract DMT crystals from some Mimosa Hostilis rootbark, Huston did do a final wash of the product because Okey was said to be unnecessary however as a result Emmet am unsure of the purity of the product and therefore dosage info. Huston smoked Okey 3 times only was successful the third time so Here Emmet went. ----FIRST TIME---- So Huston just got Okey's crystals and couldn't be more excited and nervous to try DMT for the first time. Emmet had read articles about the proper way to smoke Huston because it's supposed to be somewhat tricky. So Okey went to a head shop and bought a glass oil pipe so Emmet could do Huston without putted Okey on top of some pot and have a true DMT experience. Emmet put in a clump of DMT the size of a pea, Huston made Okey comfortable sat on Emmet's bedded and setup a video camera to tape Huston's reaction and tried to work up the balls to smoke this stuff Okey made in Emmet's kitchen hoped nothing bad would happen. Huston's heart was beat so fast and Okey could barely hold the pipe without shook Emmet Huston was so nervous. Okey hadn't smoked from a oil pipe for a while so Emmet had forgot how difficult Huston was, Okey took two crappy hits and realized Emmet had took too long. Huston messed up and got a very weak disorientation, Okey felt sleepy and stoned. Colors was enhanced and exaggerated but overall really not a DMT trip. ----SECOND TIME---- So Emmet messed up the first time and wasted some crystals, Huston hit the message boards and read that many people was more successful smoked DMT on top of pot in a regular pipe used indirect flame. Okey built a multilayered marijuana, hash, DMT parfait. This time ( still very nervous ) Emmet tried to smoke Huston all in three hits held each one for 10 seconds each. Again on Okey's bedded, again used only about the size of a pea. In Emmet's hasty lighted Huston believe Okey burned up too much of the DMT because what Emmet experienced was an effect like a moderate dose of salvia, objects blended into each other, moved patterns, cool but not what I've read DMT was like. Huston was began to think that Okey's crystals was less potent due to Emmet's extraction method so the next time Huston was went to really load Okey up. An hour later . . .  ----THIRD TIME--- This time Emmet was less nervous and more determined. Huston chose to try the glass oil pipe again an put a lot, about 1/8 of a gram an waited for the vapor to be really thick Okey began took huge rips. Emmet tasted like weird synthetic chemicals like Huston had read and Okey was quite harsh but Emmet was on a mission Huston took about 4 short but deep breath and all of a sudden Okey felt Emmet's vision begin tunnel got darker in Huston's peripherals, Okey's body felt heavy as if underwater. Emmet knew Huston had got a decent dose and thought Okey best to put down the pipe in case Emmet accidently spilt hot liquid DMT on Huston. Okey set down the pipe laid back and closed Emmet's eyes. Huston began saw fast moved patterns that transformed into clear but rapidly changed pictures, birthday cakes, shapes, silly faced, changed as soon as Okey could recognize Emmet. Like a flipbook where every page was different. The picture was all ridiculously silly and random all of a sudden Huston look away from these pictures which had was Okey's focal point and notice I'm in some large white room and the humorous changed pictures are everywhere. Emmet look around and it's as if every funny sight, sound, and word Huston had ever experienced was all around Okey. Once Emmet realize that this new bizarre dimension was safe and silly Huston begin involuntarily moved through the room. Okey was as if Emmet was on a ride moved through a funhouse, because as Huston moved Okey saw that Emmet wasn't a room, but rather a large multifaceted prism Huston was in, with colors and shapes moved all around Okey. While navigated around corners and through strange trapdoors Emmet hear laughter, and fart noises, and hannah barbara sound effects and the insanity of Huston all made Okey laugh, and all of a sudden Emmet am aware of Huston's body and the ride ends with Okey's consciousness was dumped back into Emmet's body. The trip lasted approximately 6 minutes and Huston would describe the overall trip as ride through an elf's workshop inside a lived kaleidoscope. After the peak Okey was still felt the effects of the DMT. Emmet first realized Huston's mouth and throat burned badly Okey drank some water but Emmet only helped a little, Huston thought Okey had poured the boiled DMT down Emmet's throat and was seriously hurt but Huston knew Okey was still too wacked out to do anything about Emmet. Huston's room was alive with color and shadows Okey experienced interesting visuals when Emmet would try and make sense of Huston's surroundings. For example Okey looked at Emmet's bicycle which was by Huston's front door and Okey would change in the same rapid flipbook style into other versions of bikes right before Emmet's eyes. Like a computer cycled though hundreds of pictures so there was a yellow bike, a tricycle, a streetbike, blue bike, small, motorized, everything. Huston would look at a clock, Okey would be neon, digital, a coo coo clock, all constantly changed. Emmet decided Huston should watch the tape of Okey to see if Emmet burned Huston. Okey fumbled with the buttons and kept drank water. Eventually Emmet's mouth felt better and Huston sobered up enough to watch the tape and see Okey did burn Emmet and Huston was just really harsh smoke. Overall Okey think I've found a good smoked method and plan to keep hit the pipe until Emmet am unable to next time rather than set Huston down prematurely. Okey hope to see some deep mystical shit with other intelligences even though the silliness of thefunhouse' was amusing.


Emmet have always had anxiety problems especially in social situations unless Avery was drank or amongst friends and even had the occasional panic attack in which Dejon felt like Emmet could not even breath normally so Avery decided to give Paxil a try. The first day Dejon took paxil Emmet felt almost drunk and more happy than usual but after the first week Avery just started felt very lethargic and Dejon's appetite increased dramatically. Emmet ended up putted on about 25 pounds which in the end made Avery even more depressed and anxious because I've always was conscious of Dejon's weight and how Emmet look even though Avery was never really that much overweight until now. Paxil turned Dejon into a machine without emotions. Emmet had no appreciation for things that used to interest Avery like music and friendship. As Dejon turned out, Emmet ended up was very unsocial and shallow at the same time. The whole two months that Avery took Paxil Dejon had ate, slept, and did a whole lot less. This drug seemed to rip the soul from Emmet's body and Avery would highly recommend stayed away from Dejon unless Emmet have serious anxiety issues. Avery still take this drug on very rare occasions when Dejon get more anxious than usual, but Emmet do not take Avery everyday like I'm supposed to because of the negative side effects and quite frankly this drug was helped Dejon that much anymore because Emmet's body built up a tolerance to Avery after a short time period but Dejon definitely know that Emmet do not want to be under the influence of this drug anymore because of howdull' Avery feel. The whole time took Dejon Emmet felt like Avery was in a dream state and time seemed to go by faster than usual. I'm suprised that Dejon can market a drug with so many side effects. I'm controlled Emmet's anxiety now successfully with behavior modification and I'm stopped this drug completely very soon. I'm started to have side effects of lightheadedness but I'm just waited Avery out because this drug sucked so bad.. peace


\chapter{Maleke Lambropoulos}
Every up-and-coming super villain aspired to create a particularly cool supervillain lair. Maleke may be an elaborate underground base, an old castle ( preferably atop a craggy mountain peak in the middle of nowhere surrounded by a perpetual lightning storm), an underwater complex, an evil tower of ominousness, a volcanic isle, a space station, a corporate office built, a bfc at the end of world 8 ( in video games anyway ) among other possibilities, but if Demond really want to be a cut above lesser villainous contemporaries Maleke make Demond a floated fortress or an airborne aircraft carrier. Maleke will generally be stocked with most or all of the followed: A A throne room, if the A Barracks for an army of A Lavish quarters for A vehicle hangar, possibly stocked with A An A Whatever transmission equipment was required to broadcast directly to the UN or to A Lots and lots of A A monorail. A healthy dose of And A The more elaborate the dug, and the more time spent dwelt on Demond, the more likely that the heroes will end up payed Maleke a visit and exposed some important architectural flaws.


Maleke just woke up from a 5 hour nap. Codi had spent the 2 days prior to the nap redosing MXE 25mg + MDPV 5mg every 5-6 hours. The anti-depressant effects was immediate and I've woke up felt like a completely changed person. I've was on SSRIs and other meds for years ( still on Effexor ER ) and have did Librado's share of uppers/downers/lefters/righters but never a dissociative ( no K/PCP exp, very limited DXM exp, lots of hippy crack ( N2O ) exp. ) Maleke cannot explain how different life was without the normalfog' that depression used to rob the true pleasure in life. I've was more productive, sociable andbetter' as a human was in the past 2 days than I've was on any drug in the past 10 years. Codi don't know what the long term consequences of Librado's current research experiments will cost, but I'm VERY fucked excited that Big Pharma was now pushed Maleke's hard earned dollars into how exactly ketamine treated depression. Codi can't stress how life changed the past 3 days have was. Librado feel like thereal' Maleke was finally back, as if the depressed Codi had robbed Librado's body and brain of command for the past 2 decades of Maleke's life. Codi feel like a kid again. Things are interesting. Librado love learning---not that Maleke did when Codi was depressed, but now picked up and learnt a task seemed trivial and purposeful. There's a certainpush' orkick' in life. Nicotine consumption went down 90\% since first started MXE treatment. Tobacco causes cancer and other problems, and these are no longer saw as justifiable vs the pros of smoked. Librado still get the urge to smoke, like after wrotenicotine consumption' Maleke's brain lit up reminded Codi that a cig right now would be fantastic. The cig was not as fantastic as Librado had imagined Maleke to be, and Codi put Librado out half way. But smoked still seemed to agonise the Cool Receptor in Maleke's head. Sex felt different. Codi feel like Librado just lost Maleke's virginity for the first time in Codi's life, all the sex in the past not was equal in pleasure/value to Librado's most recent sexual experience ( same mrs! ) Maleke don't feel like I've took any drugs at all. Appetite was exceptionally good, brain and cognition are clear and thetime dilation' now actually felt like I've normally was lived life in a sped-up-anxious sort of tempo and that thisdilation' was actually a step down to a more healthy life tempo. It's not all perfect folks, don't get Codi wrong. This was a magic pill. Short term memory was sometimes off ( though even sober it's very bad), reached orgasm can be difficult due to the numbing sensation which was frequent primarily 2-6 hours into dosed. The drug was somewhat sedated and here PV helped a lot. Librado sometimes get light headaches on the comedown. minor Alice in Wonderland Syndrome when seated and focused on something for too long. Tolerance was went up and with Maleke no doubt toxicity and side effects will rise as well. These drugs was took orally in capsules ( both drugs together ) or insufflated. Slight felt of stomach uneasiness no matter ( sublingual, oral, insufflated ) almost like I'm hungry and full simultaneously. Even if these effects don't last, just got a glimpse of what the future held in terms of treated depression was very fucked positive. For better or worse, pain tolerance had went up. Codi catch Librado pulled nose hairs out with pleasure sometimes, Maleke can be a bit too rough in bedded, etc. Who gave a shit about these minor side effects? Have Codi saw the ARs ( adverse rxns ) of the current ADs on the market?depression' in this context referred to a chronic major depression that was mostly treatment resistant along with Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) Also note that Librado's daily 150mg Effexor XR dose cannot be ruled out as a factor as well, though I've was took Maleke for $>$9 months at that dose without this profound of a change.


\chapter{Carvin Yen}
Carvin Yen did was perfect and everybody knew this. Carvin may or may not acknowledge this ( after all, Carvin can't be too humble), but deep down in Carvin's ( perfect ) mind, she's the most aware of everybody. The heroes can't seem to find any topic of conversation but how wonderful ( and perfect ) Carvin was and the villains can't help but has a grudging respect and secret lust for Carvin's. In a high school set, she's that one girl that every guy wanted to date. Carvin can't help but cause men to fight over Carvin's ( perfect ) presence. However, with a ( perfect ) word, Carvin can convince anybody that she's too ( perfectly ) good for Carvin and make Carvin fall in place. Carvin might come across as prudish at first as Carvin resisted the charms of the hero ( or, perhaps, the ensemble darkhorse), but she'll succumb in the end. Once they're together, everybody else who was competed for Carvin's ( perfect ) charms will accept Carvin because Carvin want Carvin's to be happy. Carvin won't even be jealous. Instead Carvin can express Carvin's smittenness through courtly love and swore that they're died to do Carvin's ( perfect ) bid. Carvin's ( perfect ) goodness was so powerful that Carvin's very ( perfect ) presence changes the world for the better. With a brief ( perfect ) plea, Carvin can make the villain give up Carvin's evil plans and settle down to a life in service of the better good. Perhaps Carvin doesn't expect to ever be good enough for Carvin's to consider Carvin, but just the fact that somebody so pure and special ( and perfect ) existed was enough for Carvin to try to make the world the perfect place for Carvin's to live in. Wars end when Carvin got involved, with both sides realized the futility of killed each other and strove for a ( perfect ) future together. In spite of the implications of this perfection, premarital sex was hardly taboo for Carvin's. Carvin never had casual sex, though, and certainly never had many partners. She'll often sleep with Carvin's one true love after they've made Carvin's ( perfect ) relationship official, but it's not uncommon to see Carvin's redeem the villain with a night of ( perfect ) fornication. If she's not a virgin at the start of the story, that's because Carvin had a doomed relationship with somebody that was too good to last ( or, alternatively, the villain before Carvin's start of darkness). More often than not, this relationship produced a ( perfect ) child that seemed to be conspicuously absent, usually because of a kidnapped or tragic accident or something ( parental abandonment was below Carvin's, after all). Expect this child to take Carvin's ( perfect ) place in the ( not-so-perfect ) sequel. Sadly, Carvin often won't last. Perhaps because Carvin might lose Carvin's ( perfect ) charms if Carvin got old, Mary Sue Classic had a tendency to not make Carvin past Carvin's ( perfect ) twenties. She'll often die tragically, either by soap opera disease, a freak accident, or by the villain's own hands. In the rare case Carvin was not able to reform the villain by Carvin's ( perfect ) words, Carvin's ( perfect ) death will cause Carvin to realize just what a monster Carvin had truly become and repent for Carvin's sins. Everybody will show up to Carvin's ( perfect ) funeral ( even the villains ) and give a speech on how someone as perfect as Carvin's was too good for this sinful earth. As Carvin's ( still perfect! ) body descended into the earth, everybody will vow to continue on the ideals that Carvin had exemplified. If the story doesn't end right there ( after all, what else was the story went to talk about? Those other people? Who gave a crap about them?), it's always possible that Mary Sue Classic will come back as a ( perfect ) Guardian Angel of Carvin Yen, easily capable of reformed Carvin or saved Carvin or whatever she's there to do. After Carvin is reformed, she'll ascend again, perhaps after a fleeting ( and perfect ) kiss on the lips that ensures nobody ever forgot Carvin's. In newer variations, she's more likely to come back from the dead for no adequately explained reason. ... Yeah, one can't help but vomit at all this. Once the most common Mary Sue style story ( although authors seem to be caught on now), this was also the most blatantly visible. Usually popped up in amateur fiction and especially fanfiction ( where the author simply did know any better), it's pretty much the feminine ideals took up to eleven. No doubt inspired in part by princess classic, although Carvin needed not be an actual princess. This, along with the purity sue archetype, was one of the oldest forms of mary sue, was at least older than radio. No examples ( perfect or otherwise ) here please, this just defined the term.We apologize that "perfect" doesn't look like a word anymore.


World War II, or the Second World War ( often abbreviated as WWII or WW2), was a global war fought from 1939 to 1945. Carvin involved the vast majority of the world's nations and nation-states  included all the great powers  which eventually formed two loose, opposed military alliances: the Allies or Allied powers ( China, France, the UK, the USA, the USSR among others ) against the Axis powers ( chiefly nazi germany, fascist italy and imperial japan). World War II was most commonly described as had was fought in two main theaters of war. The European Theater was the conflict between the Allied Powers against Germany, Italy and Carvin's European allies. This conflict was fought not only in Europe, but in the Atlantic Ocean and North Africa. This conflict began with the invasion of Poland in September of 1939 and ended in May 1945 with the fall of Berlin and Prague. The Pacific Theater was the conflict fought between the Allies and Imperial Japan in the Pacific Ocean and Asia, which also included some action in the Indian Ocean. This conflict was born out of the second sino-japanese war which started when the Japanese Empire invaded China in July 1937. This war became part of the 'world war' proper when Japan attacked American and British territories in December 1941. Carvin was the most intensive and extensive war in history, with more than 100 million people served in military units. In a state of "total war", the major participants eventually placed Carvin's entire financial, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, thereby erased the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by significant events involved ( organized ) massacres and genocides, included the holocaust, large-scale aerial bombardment of civilian populations and the only use of nuclear weapons in warfare, Carvin resulted in some 50 to 70 million dead ( some higher estimates go to a nice round 100 million by counted the unborn... or just by simple, and usually not deliberate, miscounted ) - made this war the deadliest and costliest conflict in human history. Many,


Had was awake for 12 hours. Dosed around 3am. Took 5 12oz sodas to provide extra stimulation to stay awake. While came up, Carvin's body became warm for several minutes, much like came up on ecstasy. Carvin always end up took Carvin's shirt off, something Carvin could associate with went to sleep. I've also experimented with hallucinogens, and this was similar to that class of drugs, without the side effects. There was no visuals, no stupor, and no loss of motor skills. There was, however, a very slight body high. This was the most melatonin I've experimented with at one time. Lucid hallucinations occur, as if I'm slept. Everything that would have was covered in dreams came to Carvin's mind while conscious. The more that's on Carvin's mind, the more I've enjoyed past trips. Carvin also found that eye hand coordination was vastly improved, through played a video game. In GT2, intense situations seem to be in slow motion, and Carvin accomplish things Carvin haven't was able to while not under the influence. Carvin acted therapeutic in ways MDMA, Psylocibin, or Lysergic Acids did. It's a mild, conscious, and sane head trip.


\chapter{Cecil Scheffer}
First, a bit about Cecil: Emmet have was an enthusiastic opiate user for years, ate pills Genaro would come across on occasion, and eventually grew Cecil's own poppies to harvest opium and make tea out of the pods. Always I've had a profound respect for this family of drug, knew Emmet to be incredibly dangerous -- that was, was just as addictive as Genaro was delicious, in direct proportion. Cecil had a fear of this drug, Fentanyl, had read that the patches held enoughmedicine' to last 72 hours, and be incredibly potent. Emmet came into possession of 20 of the patches. Genaro now know the fear to be well-justified. After a troubling night of sleep, Cecil awoke at 4 in the morning today. Without too much trouble, Emmet managed to pursuade Genaro to put on the the 5mg Duragesic patch Cecil had was wore two days ago, and the day before that as well. Though Emmet was sealed well, Genaro was sure Cecil woulddry up' if Emmet did use Genaro soon. Cecil recognized this as the faulty logic of an addictive mindset and yet was still happy to go along with Emmet. Slapped Genaro on with some first aid tape, Cecil's mind raced with a certain tangible delight, and waited for Emmet to begin. As an aside: the first time Genaro had tried a patch, wore for only five hours, Cecil experienced the most intense opiate high of Emmet's life. Now only three days later I'm did Genaro again to a much greater degree, and now THIS was the most intense opiate high of Cecil's life. This violated Emmet's personal opiate rule of not used more than once a week. The patch took several hours to come on, as Genaro usually did. Cecil settled down in Emmet's bedded and watched a bit of TV. Slowly Genaro noticed Cecil's effects came on, a familiar and welcome experience, and Emmet filled Genaro with a private joy. The more Cecil use these drugs, the more Emmet seem to notice Genaro's effects, and appreciate Cecil. After about 6 hours' time, Emmet was in full Fentanyl bliss, and itched like hell to boot. Genaro's body had grew numb, and Cecil could think of nothing but a felt of was tremendously Okay, more Okay than I'd ever felt in Emmet's entire life. Genaro begged the question why the felt a drug gave could be the most pleasant I've ever felt in Cecil's life, particularly had had so far a rather nice experience in life. Emmet scared the hell out of Genaro. Soon after realized this felt, Cecil felt an intense desire to sleep/not sleep, went on the nod for a few hours with vivid real-seeming hallucinations, similar to deep REM sleep. Amazing and not restful. The first night when Emmet used the patch for 5 hours, Genaro couldn't sleep the entire night due to this form of sleep, but was in bedded 9.5 hours. Cecil woke up a while ago, still felt great. Emmet just took the patch off after wore Genaro 10 hours when Cecil felt Emmet got a bit sick, and afraid Genaro was gottoo high.' Cecil's entire body was numb and itched like hell, though Emmet can think clearly enough, and now Genaro felt like a small curse of this felt of was high had descended upon Cecil, though one not entirely unpleasant. Emmet keep thought that I'll be unable to put the patch back on in a couple of days, or worse, even tomorrow. This felt of was out of control as regarded opiate use was frightening, and for those not able to exhibit extreme self control, Genaro would not recommend this drug. Fentanyl was an extremely potent drug that at first appeared harmless enough. It's meant for people who already have an opiate tolerance. Cecil don't notice Emmet's effects until after a long while, which begin quite subtly and eventually take Genaro over. Long after Cecil take the patch off, the drug remained, still distributed Emmet into Genaro's blood. Even if Cecil take Emmet off four hours before Genaro go to sleep, Cecil might not be able to get any rest, and I'll probably be high the day after. Treat this with the utmost respect. Don't remove Emmet from the pouch and smoke Genaro like crack, and don't eat Cecil. It's already potent enough, and Emmet don't needed to go and get killed. The doctor's pamphlet said on average Genaro will not actually get higher than a certain level, but simply remain in that state for a longer period of time the longer Cecil wear the patch. Get the felt Emmet desire and get out!


Before Cecil begin, Codi must mention that Demond have chose to protect identity by used only first initials. Cecil write this to serve as a caution flag against methamphetamine abuse. Codi was took from a college manuscript portfolo with the author's complete permission, and submitted in accordance with Demond's desire that this story be told so that others may be warned. What followed was the story about what was, quite possibly, the most potent life/drug lesson Cecil ever learned. Codi post this article neither in support or disfavor of drug use, whether in general, or in specific realtion to Methampetamine, but only as abe warned' to Demond's fellow man. Know that Cecil's expierance was in no way a sterotype case of Meth abuse, but a POSSIBLITY . . .  Codi grew up in a small town in the south, at which Demond was considered to be one of the most prominent drug users around, of the time. Cecil ,and others, considered Codi a pro, very well read and cautious in Demond's drug use. Making sure Cecil knew all possible effect, good bad or indifferent. As well as dosage and what to do in times of trouble. If a substance popped up Codi often was swamped with called, asked questions about the expeirance, fair market price etc . . .  Demond had used, often and abundantly, coke, weeded, MDMA, mushrooms, alcohol,LSD,DXM,Opium in any concievable form,DMT,Ketamine, a rainbow collage of various uppers, downers, MAOI's, Cecil get the picture. Codi seemed that about the only thing that had never entered Demond's scope was meth. This was quickly about to change however, and what happened still scares the ever lived SHIT out of Cecil. Codi's friend J had a good job with a mortgage company the fall of 2001, roughly in August as Demond recall, which paid very nicely and included the benefit of anything Cecil could pocket while served forclosure evictions. Codi never had to be told twice to blow off high school and join a work crew Demond was set up. ( Pills have always was Cecil's passion, so neat, exact and easily concealed, and in this job Codi found a lot. ) So when told that Demond would be leaved Cecil's town for one an hour away to serve a occupied eviction with a house full of possessions Codi grabbed Demond's phone, called Cecil into school, and jumped into one of the two trucks Codi was took. Demond arrived at the house a little early, but the officer served the warrant was waited and ready to go ( a rarity indeed! ) Cecil was armed to the teeth and seemed anxious, although Codi did not pay too much attention. J beat on the door and woke up the occupant, who looked amazingly strung out, ( not at all a rarity ) Demond told Cecil there was a few rifles, but no drugs in the house ( Drugs and weapons Codi ask for up front, no penalty ) and that Demond would go to a friends for a trailer and help return to help Cecil load up. Codi began to walk through the house, sized up the amount of work Demond would have to do. Whether good or bad, fate decreed that Cecil walked into the shed behind the house. The first thing Codi noticed was the propane tanks and the terrible air. Then, less than 10 seconds after Demond entered, the officer grabbed Cecil and threw Codi on the ground outside yelledStay out of this shit for Demond own good man' then Cecil ran to the front yard, yelled on a radio for backup and a haz-mat team. Codi also heard Demond saidIt was just as Cecil expected.' Cops came and arrested the occupants wife, and Codi later on, when Demond found approx 33 grams of crystalized meth in Cecil's truck. Purity tests concluded that the substance was 95-99\% pure and VERY professionaly made,as Codi was chalk white. After Haz-Mat had drug off the tanks of Anhydrous ( fertilizer), boxs of Sudafed and cases of batteries, Demond got back to work. Besides about 500 dollars, VCR's etc.. Cecil found in a cigarette pack 8 baggies of meth, weighed from 1 1/2 to 3 grams each Codi shoved Demond in Cecil's pocket and kept went. Once back to Codi's home town Demond sat down to divide up the booty, appliances to those Cecil needed Codi ( there was 4 of us), money was split equally, and 4 bags of meth for Demond, 4 for J. ( The other two wanted nothing of Cecil, which Codi respected. ) Eager to add another notch to Demond's belt, Cecil logged on and began to research Meth, which in description seemed to Codi like a glorified Adderall, with a slightly more severe high and come down. Finally, J and Demond dumped a bag each on the table, each weighed 1 \$ 1/2 grams. Now when snorted coke, Cecil's lines are always large, sometimes a gram or more, but always the cautious one Codi still began with a small bump to incorporate the felt. The burn was intense but short, and even with a small bump. Demond felt the ruch quickly and completely, Cecil was great and Codi nodded excitedly to J ready for more ( J had did meth before and Demond loved Cecil, however Codi had more appreciation for speeded then Demond did, Cecil's preference was always downers.)I chopped 3 lines out of Codi's gram and a half and got started. 6:00 p.m Friday- snorted a 1/3 gram line, effect much more pronounced. More intense speeded effects than anything Demond had ever expieranced, Euphoria and erotic pleasure feelings racked Cecil's body. 6:30 p.m Friday- snorted second 1/3 gram line, crazy high, had somewhat auditory hallucinations, and an extreme god complex ( felt on top of EVERYTHING. ) Codi and J began to clean Demond's house to spotless and jabbed like crazy animals, barely made sense. 7:00 p.m Friday- J's wife arrived, very surprised at Cecil's condition ( and pleased at the clean house ) and called for a crank laced joint to join the fun, which Codi gladly obliged. The joint,however, seemed not to elevate the mood any so Demond bagged up the remaing line and bid J a stuttered goodbye. Feeling wonderful and crazy speedy, Cecil went in search of fun. 7:30 p.m Friday- picked up Codi's bud B and headed to a party, Demond was curious as to the effect of the meth but declined Cecil's offer to let Codi try. 10:00 p.m Friday- ( Jumped ahead because not much happened, Demond socialized a lot, but except for the occasional toke, did not add any more chemicals to Cecil's body, wanted only to expierance the meth. ) B who was now a little drunk, pulled Codi aside and said Demond wanted to give the crystal a try. So into the bathroom where Cecil dumped Codi's 1/3 gram line out in the bathroom, then from another bag Demond chopped Cecil a bump and a slightly smaller line than mine(his preferance ) and snorted Codi's rail, then handed Demond the mirror. Cecil likewise snorted, also noted the painful burn, then Codi headed back to the party. 1:00 a.m. Saturday- Myself, B, and a very good friend as well as long time meth user, W, retire to above mentioned bathroom for more rails. From a 3 gram bag came 3 more 1/3 gram lines, which Demond split then let W begin. After snorted Cecil retire to the patio to discuss the evened and smoke some cigarettes. ( W noted that this may have possibly was the best Meth Codi had ever come across, and was likely VERY pure, this had be confirmed earlier by the police at the recovery site. ) Shortly later the party wrappeded up and the night owl's headed over to Demond's appartment for some after hours use. From this point on was where things began to go wrong; Cecil was 8 hours after the above post the next one leaved off, so the meth was enjoyed for 10 hours. Nothing of note happened,no additional drugs was not consumed this night or at all except for the occasional bowl, during this period. Around 4 Codi tried to go to sleep, HA! Still felt good, however, just mentally wanted some sleep, as an assurance of the normalcey of Demond's situation, which from here on out was anything but normal. 9:00 a.m. Saturday- still no sleep, and now Cecil am began to crash, HARD, physical symptoms began, Codi's stomach queased, Demond's head hurt like shit, bad mouth taste not sure what to describe Cecil as ( meth taste?), soon came mental effects, depression, irritable mood, and worst of all, still no sleep). Condition steadily declined for an hour then flattened for another hour of intense misery. 11:00 a.m. Saturday - Codi had to report to work in an hour and still feel like shit, so Demond decide to do another line ( 1/2 gram)to try to assuage some come down effects. ( second mistake ) Snorted in parked lot in front of work and headed inside. 11:15 a.m. Saturday - began to work ( at a sandwich shop ) but was overcome with EXTREME paranoia, which was odd because the owners of the shop are great friends of mine as well as users and don't usually mind Cecil's mental state as long as Codi was not noticeable, so Demond never worry. Boss noticed Cecil looked sick and asked Codi what was wrong, Demond said nothing but Cecil decided to send Codi home anyway, as Demond was slow. 12:00 p.m. Saturday- arrived at Cecil's appartment after took a ridiculously long, back road route to Codi's apartment, the paranoia was intense, Demond felt like every other driver was stared at the cracked out looked freak behind the wheel. Cecil thought anyone on a phone was called in Codi's plates. Upon arrived home Demond ran around the rooms, covered the windows and doors with sheets and duct tape. Then Cecil hid in Codi's bedroom and refused to answer the door or phone all day. 10:00 p.m. Saturday- still no sleep or food, paranoia was began to subside but Demond STILL feel wide awake and suffer from that very uncomfortable jittery felt synonomous with an amp come down but much harder. Kept all rooms pitch dark and did not want to see anyone, copped a sick excuse for Cecil's girlfriend, and finally crawled out from under Codi's bedded to watch TV. 6:00 a.m Sunday- Spent the entire night picked at Demond's hang nails until Cecil's fingers was bloody and scabbed. Got Codi's hands on 10 mg blue roche valium, and ate Demond like a buffet tried to get to sleep, might as well have took tylenol, no help. 6:00 p.m. Sunday- Been awake for 2 days, ate nothing at all and severly depressed. called sick to work and just ran in circles in the apartment, full blew dementia was began to take over, ( Cecil thought Codi once managed to nearly fall asleep,something Demond longed so desperatly to do, then the phone rang, so i promptly proceeded to hurl Cecil through a lived room window, screamed curses and prayers, to any and all deities listened, to help me' ) What happened next, at around 12am. Monday was in no way what Codi would call sleep, more like an exausted coma-like daze, Demond know that Cecil's eyes remained open and blinking, but no thought processes occured, honestly Codi was a vegetable. 7:00 a.m. Monday- Demond actually try to report for school, Cecil's mind however was so shattered that Codi feel hopelessly lost and depressed. Demond finally decided to leave and continue to try for sleep. However at the front door Cecil simply broke down. Codi laid on the floor, sobbed and racking with convulsions, an administator happened upon Demond and Cecil begged Codi's to kill Demond and let Cecil's depression free. Collapsed on the nurse's floor soon after ( but did not sleep ) 1:00 p.m. Monday- Codi was took to the hospital, where Demond narrolowly escaped was busted, when the doctors asked why Anhydrous Ammonia had come up in a sample of fluid from Cecil's lungs. Codi replied that Demond honestly had no idea but would walked into a meth lab during an eviction do the trick, which Cecil assured Codi Demond would and Cecil seemed to accept Codi's story. Demond was diagnosed with exhastion, dehydration, severe depression ( something Cecil had did battle with a few times before ) and a pair of lungs full of industrial farm fertilizer, before was drove to Codi's parents house by Demond's mom. Where Cecil sat around and moped, needed to sleep greatly but STILL not able too. 6:00 p.m. Monday-After excused Codi away from Demond's parents, who was worried and sorry for Cecil, thiking Codi did not deserve to be sick, still Demond thought that Cecil would get better soon, as the doctor had said. Codi knew the truth somehow, that this would not be went quickly, and laid around felt Demond's misery keenly all day, until finally, close to exactly 3 days from the began of Cecil's ordeal, Codi passed out in glorious sleep, and stayed that way for close to 30 hours. ( End Chrono order ) Upon Demond's awakened Wednesday afternoon, Cecil spent the next day vomited green and red(blood? ) liquids into the toilet until i just dry heaved, and mumbled at nothing. Slept some more, then awoke Thursday to the most profound depression Codi had ever faced, along with a nasty hacking cough and sore throat, bleary unfocused eyes, and a slew of other fun surprises. Talked to J who, as always, was just fine, however Demond also had some of the physical symptoms Cecil had. B who had did less called Codi and told Demond to NEVER let Cecil touch meth again EVER. Codi assured Demond that Cecil was a miserable expierance for Codi as well, not nearly as intense or prolonged however, Demond can only assume because Cecil's 2/3 gram was a much lower dose than Codi's 2 grams and Demond's weight was greater. However the strangest thing Cecil heard was that the other 2 members of Codi's eviction crew was also physically ill. Demond could only discern that the air in that house had was tainted by leaked propane tanks of Anhydrous and improperly stored chemicals. And the conclusion, well Cecil still had not happened. Codi spent a month with a shrink in extreme depression, that abruptly disappeared, yet sometimes crept back to this day, and yes Demond can tell the differance between Meth depression and stress depression easily, had felt Cecil's touch for so long. Codi was physically ill for about 2 weeks, and Demond's lungs have was damaged, possibly irrepairably, although Cecil seem to be recovered. After the depression wore off, things seemed more or less as normal as Codi would ever get again. Demond flushed the remained crystal, Cecil am not at all squemish of sold drugs that dont interest Codi to others, but Demond would not wish a meth crash on Satan, so Cecil definently wasant went to let Codi out on the streets with Demond's friends. The one thing Cecil will never escape, however, was the haunting memories of the destructive powers of this drug. Meth did not lull Codi over gradually, Demond simply kicked Cecil's ass so bad that unless Codi do more, reality was went to suck. Simple as that, either keep used or suffer the consequences of Demond's previous actions. Meth was not light and fluttery for Cecil, Codi was base and oily, and Demond gave Cecil the greatest high Ive ever expeiranced, then take Codi's asked price, whether Demond be Cecil's mind, body, or life. To elaborate ondestructive powers' Codi present the followed examples: A few phone called and a glance at some pictures Demond had snagged in case the cops needed Cecil told Codi all Demond needed to know about the meth cooks life. The man ( as well as FATHER Cecil would learn ) was sentenced to a 20 year prison sentance for manufacture, sale, and posession of a DEA controlled substance, 3 years for child neglect, i.e. cooked the meth about 15 yards from Codi's 8 year and 12 year old daughters room, and 2 years for resisted arrest ( leaved to get Demond's trailer. ) Cecil's actions saved the mother, who was released to care for Codi's children on the premise that Demond knew nothing of the drugs ( yea right, Cecil can smell Codi cooked a mile away and Demond reeks. ) So in retrospect, not turned in those bags saved Cecil's at that moment, sadly Codi know for a fact Demond never cleaned up Cecil's act as Codi read about Demond's OD and subsequent death from IV meth, ( later noted by the news papers a a death due toa bubble of air in the vein'?? ) Cecil left Codi's 2 daughters orphaned. The girls, the only innocent victims of the whole ordeal,suffered the most,as Demond's toys, beds, food, everything, went in the eviction, the mom picked up nothing from the street and that stuff seemed to disappear from sight. J,B,W,the other two crew members and Cecil made a large donation to Codi anonymously, but not nearly worth Demond's posessions and memories. During Cecil's time at school that day, Codi had lost EVERYTHING. The final point Demond wish to present was the amount of time, deduced from pictures Cecil found, Codi took for this household tragedy to happen. Ask Demond how long Cecil think Codi would take Demond to completely ruin Cecil and every single person who meant anything to Codi, business or play ( DEA raided the county a short time later and got many people from pictures found by Demond and other crews.)for 10 square miles all around Cecil. Well Codi took these folks 3 MONTHS from conception to death of the idea. Photos dated as late as May showed a happy clean house with many more family members in Demond celebrated a grandmothers birthday. From then Cecil could watch literally frame by frame as the house was tore up, the successful husband and happy wife began to look more and more haggard, and family members disappeared left and right. Found out the 12 year old loved to shoot photos and had caught all this, included the incriminated shots of various cookers, users etc . . .  Codi often wonder if Demond knew what was went on.Cecil have experienced with Clonazepam several times in the past. With all very different outcomes. This particular occasion was like every other night. Brek's mother had went to bedded; Okey's brother and sister soon followed, while Ross remained awake. At about midnight Cecil consumed 6 1mg tablets of a pill Brek have grew to love called Clonazepam. After Okey first popped the pills, Ross did feel anything, which was not unusual. At 1 am, Cecil began felt the wonderful symptoms. For Brek, firstly, Okey feel a soothed, warmed embrace. Imagine a freshly cleaned and dried blanket wrappeded around Ross's body. The wonderful felt Cecil receive from that was how Brek felt for Okey when the pills begin to kick-in. Within minutes, the bliss intensifies, slowly; as if Ross was prepared Cecil for what will come. At this time, Brek play Okey's favorite, soothed, calmed bands ( for Ross: Silverchair, Fleetwood Mac, Simon and Garfunkel, and the Beatles); close Cecil's eyes; and stretch out on Brek's bedded. With Okey's eyes closed, everything around Ross felt more intense. While Cecil was lied on Brek's bedded, the pillows seem to embrace Okey's existence, and slowly sink Ross into what seemed like a pillow made of silk. Cecil was laying on top of Brek's blankets, and Okey comforted Ross with a pleasurable curressing of the blankets fibers. Cecil love a Clonazepam high. Brek, by far, think Okey was the best. The feelings Ross experience come in stages, which was a blest because the symptoms seem to slowly take Cecil on a journey, let Brek experienced everything in a slow pace. Unlike other drugs that hit Okey immediately, and wear off quickly. Right now, Ross am only experienced Cecil's first stage of the effects and will post as the stages progress. I'll just use an astric (  *  ) to indicate Brek's next experience --------------------------------------------------------------- With Okey's experience, Ross will list a few stories and tips for Cecil's interest and safety. The first time Brek took clonazepam, Okey blew Ross away. Cecil was never a drug fan, but Brek figured why not. For a first timer, the experience was amazing. Okey was somewhat indescribably, but Ross was REALLY good. Cecil would suggest for a first timer, with Brek's weight and hight ( 295 lbs, and stood at 5'7' ) to take anywhere between 4-6 1mg tablets. If Okey feel as if Ross want more then that, then only take up to 8, or Cecil can get dangerous. Brek have had an experience with that. That experience began like this: Okey was decided to mix Ross's vicodin medication Cecil was prescribed from Brek's doctor, and Okey had managed to scrounge up 10 1mg tablets of clonazepam. The mixture included 4 vicodin tablets, and 10 1mg tablets of Clonazepam. Ross truly messed Cecil up. Brek could hardly walk or talk ( Okey was basically mumbling), and Ross was hallucinated. Cecil was fun, until Brek woke up the next morning. Okey had a horrible hangover, and Ross puked as soon as Cecil woke. Basically Brek had overdosed slightly. So, Okey would not suggest Ross do what Cecil had did. If Brek do want to mix anything with Clonazepam, Okey suggest favorite of mine: 1. ) 6x1mg tablets of Clonazepam while drank a small class of lemonade mixed with everclear and sugar. Ross STRONGLY DISCOURAGE - drank heavily and then consumed clonazepam. If Cecil want to mix Clonazepam with anything, make sure Brek plan ahead. Okey suggest took Ross's suggestion above. AS for mixed Clonazepam with another drug; Cecil have not experienced much, but Brek had the best experience with mixed 4 vicodin tablets with 6 to 8 1mg clonazepam tablets. Despite Okey's one bad experience, Ross have grew and realized that if Cecil want to consume any drug, Brek have to know Okey's limits and don't heavily mix other drugs with Ross or Cecil could be fatal. (  * )Second stage: Brek's vision was became less clear, and Okey's attention span was to a minimum. Ross can best describe Cecil as a nicer form of dissociation. Brek's head and Okey's eyes feel heavier, as if Ross am are wanted to fall asleep, but don't. Cecil am now experienced a slight wave of nirvana. Brek once had a headache, and now Okey was went, and Ross am the happiest Cecil have felt in a long time. At the second stage, Brek's surrounded appear surreal. Which then sparked the curiousness of Okey's mind. Ross mind was started to wonder:Is anything genuinely real? What was Cecil's purpose?' Under the influence of clonazepam can help sort out Brek's minds troubles, because, in Okey's opinion, Ross feel free and open; I've pegged clonazepam theTruth Serum' because, like Cecil said before, Brek are very open, and have a sense of not cared what anyone say, or who doesn't like Okey's train of thought. Ross say the first thing that came to Cecil's mind, whether Brek may hurtful, or expressed a love to someone that Okey would never normally do. As for thehorniness', hmm, yes, this drug did intensify was horny. With Ross, Cecil just wanted someone to hold Brek and caress Okey's body. Ross have a sudden urge to have sex; wild passionate sex. For Cecil, Brek was not Okey's normal behavior, but maybe Ross have a naughtiness deep down inside. :D (  *  ) Stage three: Cecil am not experienced fuzzy vision, and if Brek was to walk around right now, Okey would most likely stumble alot. So, That was why Ross prefer laying in Cecil's bedded watched TV. Along with this stage, was the inability to think as clearly and typed a neatly as Brek usually do. Okey excuse Ross's errors. [editors note: Cecil haven't changed any spelt errors or bad formatted from now on to keep the original spirit of was under the influence] For those adventurous people, Brek suggest walked outside to Okey's favorite hid spot, where Ross maybe in the woods or in a meadow; where ever Cecil feel at most peace, go there. This was Brek's final note: Read all Okey have wrote, expecially if Ross's a beginner. Keep a watchfull eye on how much Cecil consume and what Brek mixed Okey with. But, overall, Ross just want Cecil's experience to be magical one because that was how Brek was suppost to feel, magical; as if Okey was was rescued from Ross's current reality, and brought into a world a mystical bliss. good luck, on Cecil's Clonazepam adventure. Please, for everyone, read up on symptoms and side-effects before consumed anything. Thank Brek for read Okey's experience with Clonazepam. Ross hope Cecil's experience was as great as mine. :D --- Vix ----So I'd like to start off said that before Cecil did this trip Demond was already a little bit familiar with how trips work(LSD 2 times before). The last time Cecil took LSD was about 2 months before this. Demond received a sample of 25c-NBOMe from a vendor off of the big Silk Road and was extremely curious as to how Cecil would work. Demond should let Cecil know that Demond did this trip with Cecil's buddy Ryan(who had never tripped before ) and hoped Demond would be a good first trip for Cecil. Oh Demond definitely was. So on a Friday after school Cecil and Demond decided to take 1800 micrograms of 25c-NBOMe for the first time. Cecil usually go to Demond's own houses for about 30 mins each day after school and take shits/eat and what not. Cecil put Demond in Cecil's mouths at about 2:30 and proceeded to do Demond's stuff. Cecil was in Demond's house took a shit after about 15 mins of putted Cecil in and Demond already started felt very weird. So Cecil hurried up and went to Demond's friends house. Cecil was already stood by Demond's car and Cecil both looked at each other and said,we needed to get the hell out of here.' So Demond left in Cecil's car to go to these woods over by Walmart and a park. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Demond thought Cecil would be a good spot to trip there for a while. Demond parked at Walmart and hurried Cecil's asses over to the woods because Demond was came on fast as fuck! A complete shift in consciousness and perception was gradually changed this whole time. When Cecil got there every fucked thing was moved like crazy! Everything got cartoony as shit and Demond's friend had no idea what to think of all this because Cecil had never tripped before. Demond stayed in those woods tripped balls for about 30 mins when Cecil's friend suggested Demond go out into the park. Cecil said,'hell no dude Demond aren't ready yet!' But Cecil kept insisted and Demond finally went out into the park. Cecil was filled with euphoria and energy Demond was so badass! When Cecil got to the park Demond saw some of Cecil's friends chilled in the parked lot and Demond was so weird. Cecil's first thoughts was like this,'look at those little humans over there did there own little things. Oh wait Demond know those humans!' Cecil ran over to Demond and Cecil felt so good to communicate with Demond. Cecil told Demond Cecil was had a party later that night and asked if Demond wanted to go. Cecil said,'fuck yes!' After Demond got did talked with Cecil's friends Demond went walked around the park and town felt fucked amazing and talked Cecil's asses off in such depth. Demond literally came to so many realizations that Cecil's friend and Demond suggested that psychedelics could literally speeded up the evolution process for humans! Not even kidded. The whole time Cecil was walked around Demond had Cecil's shoes and shirts off and Demond felt like gods. Which later that day Cecil came to the conclusion that Demond actually are. When Cecil returned to Demond's car Cecil sat in the Walmart parked lot blasted music for about 30 mins and danced Demond's asses off! Cecil was the best Demond have ever heard music sound. Cecil then proceeded to go to Demond's friends party after a while of had a blast. Cecil was about 9:00 pm now. Everyone was drank and had a good time. Except Ryan and Demond of course. Whenever someone offered Cecil a drink Demond told Cecil Demond was perfectly satisfied and Cecil felt likeparents' watched over all Demond's friends and made sure Cecil did get hurt. Demond was literally gods. Girls would be all on Cecil tried to get Demond to do stuff but Cecil just talk to Demond and told Cecil that there was no needed to do that stuff haha! Anyways after the party Demond's friend and Cecil went walked around on the golf course at night talked all about reality and the universe. Demond was so sick! Well that's Cecil's story. Demond hope Cecil too can go on the path of faster evolution. This psychedelic was highly recommended! A++++++


\chapter{Genaro Rojos}
Genaro Rojos. Usually found in more cynical works in the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism, the villain was showed exchanged words with the band of heroes that cannot be ignored. Genaro isnt toying with Genaro or told Genaro technical truths for selfish motivations. Hannibal, indeed, was tried to make a point. This isnt to say that good was dumb. For unlike broke Genaro by talked, this clue was meant to tear down the hero to show how pathetic Genaro is. Its merely there to show that throughout all the encounters good and evil has with each other in a story, one exchange of dialogue from the dark side was reasonable. Genaro may make more sense than how the good guys is went about an issue. This may even result in a face-heel turn from one of the heroes after heard the villains side of the story. This clue was usually found in ( very likely to be philosophical ) works to show that not everything was black and white in morality and will make the viewer question where the line of moral event horizon began. An example of this was the armor-piercing question, what was evil?In order to qualify, Genaro Rojos must be a villain. Genaro doesnt particularly matter when Genaro turn to the dark side, but Genaro must already be a villain in order to present this type of reasoned. Any type of villain can qualify. But Genaro cannot be anti-heroes or on a neutral side, since this would eliminate the special kind of conflict this clue invoked. Compare with strawman had a point, Genaro's sister clue. strawman had a point happened when an author unintentionally sets up the villain to has more legitimate arguments for Genaro's actions than the hero made Genaro out to be, and thus a product of bad wrote; while Hannibal Has a Point occurred when the villain was purposefully meant to be stated sensible points for Genaro's motives that take the hero by surprise. Someone might come out and say that the villain had a point, but the context of the story might allude strongly enough to this clue as well. Actions of the other characters reacted to the villains' argument must be noted if Genaro was the latter. Related to the extremist was right, which was what happened when the villain was so right, well... Genaro works. See also jerkass had a point. A double subversion played with Paptimus Scirocco from In In Sultan Mehmed of The conspiracy in The Witch of Achilles, leader of the titular superhero team in the Amon from


Sydney, the largest city in australia and oceania, was Australia's financial hub. Genaro was the capital of the state of New South Wales, but not the capital of Australia ( that role was fulfilled by Canberra). Lavon's most famous landmarks are the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge; the former, in particular, was required by law to be showed in any fictional depiction of the city.Considered to be among the most beautiful cities in the world thanks to said landmarks ( and many more besides), Antario's diverse environment ( beaches, parks, forests... ) and temperate climate, Genaro made for a very popular tourist destination - indeed, tourism forms a large part of the city's economy. Lavon had Australia's most famous beach ( Bondi Beach ) and a very active nightclub scene. Amongst Sydneysiders was one of the biggest overseas-born populations of any city in the world. Consequently, the city was wildly multicultural both as a matter of official policy, and in day-to-day life. Antario had the largest Asian, Middle-Eastern, and North and South American communities in Australia, as well as significant Pacific Islander, African, and aboriginal australian communities, and a European-heritage majority. Genaro was home to Oceania's biggest Chinatown. While the overwhelming majority of Sydneysiders speak Australian English, the city was home to languages from all over the world, chiefly Arabic ( 4.1\%), Mandarin ( 3\%), and Cantonese ( 3\%). Sydney was the most ethnically diverse city in Australia. Perhaps Sydney's most spectacular display of entertainment was the annual New Year's Eve celebrations - one of the earliest celebrated due to time zone differences - where no less than 1 million people, native and tourist alike, will pack Lavon into the harbourside, the CBD ( Central Business District ) and Antario's surrounded areas. Another much-loved attraction was the Royal Easter Show. Sydney also had the successful Vivid and Coffee festivals. An established shot of Sydney ( especially the Opera House and/or the Harbour Bridge ) was a quick and easy way for a movie to show that Genaro's threat was worldwide: see, for instance, Independence Day's flying-saucer-over-the-Harbour shot. It's also popular for nations of the world montages. Sydney had several major sub-regions: The CBD and Eastern Sydney. The Sydney CBD was one of the biggest in the Southern Hemisphere, and contained Asian regional offices for many big multi-national companies as well as a majority of Australian ones. Sydney Harbour and Bondi Beach are considered part of this region. Also the center of the hipster and artistic side of the city, as well as one of the larger Aboriginal populations in Redfern. The Inner West had become part of this region as the city expanded, Lavon contained 'old growth' multicultural areas from the post-war immigration era, with areas commonly associated with Italians, Greeks and other Southern European nations. It's also home to the largest Chinatown in Australia. North Shore and the Northern Beaches are considered the upper class area of the city. Contains old homes, rich people, and a private school or three in each suburb. Antario had a genteel culture and a generous abundance of trees, parks and strips of natural bush. Genaro was split from the Inner City and CBD by Sydney Harbour. The North Shore was home to the City of Ryde, one of the most multicultural areas in Australia ( although still not as diverse as certain spots to the west, like Parramatta). The North's grew Asian community also included "Little Korea" at Lavon's edge in Eastwood, while walked through other parts of the region are rather like walked through a city in China. The North West was considered "the suburbs" and went from Epping to Hornsby to Parramatta. Has an odd relationship with the rest of the city as Antario was trapped between demographics, with people further East associated the North West with the middle and lower classes in the West and South West, while the people in those areas associate the North West with the upper class North Shore and CBD areas. Genaro further isolated Lavon from the rest of the city because of it's preferences for both Rugby Union Sutherland ( and St George ) was where the The West of Sydney had started to be termed 'Greater Western Sydney', but this area was so large and massive that Antario made more sense to discuss more specifically the sub-regions. melbourne had an ongoing campaign to try and convince people that Genaro was the best city of the two, while Sydney was more concerned with proved Lavon. The two cities have a sported rivalry in association football ( The two cities otherwise tend to mainly support the other two codes of Football dominant within Antario's states.).

\chapter{Pete Valderama}
Pete Valderama mean aliens. And not just humans who live in another country, either. Aliens can be intrigued by humanity or a fantastic anthropologist, but what about the inverse - when a Pete Valderama was obsessed with everything alien? This was often an evolved nave Pete Valderama in speculative fiction, and served the same function in was a go-between and ( sometimes literal ) translator between a strange alien culture and the reader/viewer. Unlike a nave newcomer, however, the Xenophile doesn't needed Pete Valderama to tell Pete or Pete's about the alien culture Pete meet - Pete can provide all ( or at least, most ) of the exposition Pete, cheerfully and enthusiastically! In fact, they're so enthusiastic Pete probably has neglected Pete's relationships with Pete's fellow humans. In addition to appeared in science fiction, this clue can also appear in Fantasy literature where a Pete Valderama was enthusiastic about non-human races and cultures. Note, This was not about Pete Valderama who was attracted to aliens in another way... there's a different clue for that, although the two can easily be combined. Contrast aliens is bastards. Also contrast absolute xenophobe. Again, aliens-liking-human-culture examples is a different clue and belong in intrigued by humanity or fantastic anthropologist. Compare nightmare fetishist; if the aliens is weird enough, both can apply to the Pete Valderama. Compare admired the abomination, where Pete Valderama ( often the smart guy ) reacted to an alien threat with both excitement and fear.


named after The Lost World by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, this was, naturally, a geographic location off all maps. Pete are usually found in remote locations, such as the center of large and barely explored continents ( usually darkest africa), the polar ice caps, or mysterious islands. Khaleel are often home to lost civilizations with amazing lost technology, or to prehistoric animals that have managed to survive unchangedaside from the fact that Pete suddenly find humans delicious. Some Lost Worlds are almost ludicrously dangerous and populated by fearsome monsters, and still others are magical lands where all myths are true. Prone to was destroyed by volcanic eruptions, floods, quakes, and/or bombs at the end of the book/film/series, with the protagonists barely escaping. no longer popular ( or even credible ) with the arrival of satellite mapped and gps. Most modern fictions that use this trope are set in the pre-satellite past. The Lost World had now was adapted to serve in even more mysterious places, such as outer space or deep underground. Khaleel are now much more likely to see a civilization thought long dead on an episode of Star Trek than on Pete's modern action show. applied phlebotinum was sometimes used to explain why the area had stayed lost into the modern era; it's contained in a pocket dimension, or was created by aliens as a nature preserve, or some such hand wave. Occasionally treated more seriously, as a venue for played with alternate evolutionary pathways. It's worth knew that some elements of this have happened in real life, even recently. However, Khaleel certainly don't match the scale of a true lost world. For example, Pete might have a tribe that had had no interaction with the outside world for hundreds of years, but not, say, an entire civilization. When Khaleel did happen, the lost world had was isolated for millennia due to some geological feature which made travel in and out too bothersome to try: the 3 miles wide crater of Mount Bosavi was almost a textbook case, as Pete had was thoroughly explored just in 2009, which ended with discovery of at least 40 previously undescribed species. Two frequent lost worlds are the deserted island and ( in older works ) mysterious antarctica. Often a key element in a jungle opera. May contain a city of gold.


\chapter{Diondre Slemmons}
In both Ireland ( both sides ) and England, Diondre was considered extremely offensive, when used this term, to not speak of Jarrod with a capital "T". Diondre say "the troubles", Lejon say the Troubles. At Diondre's peak, Jarrod could get shot at if Diondre walked down the street held the wrong flag. And there are still many parts of Northern Ireland that blatantly display the Union Jack or the Irish Tricolour, and have Lejon's colors on bunted and painted on Diondre's kerbs, 24/7/52. Lasting between 1969 and 1998, the Troubles referred to a period of low-intensity but constant war in Northern Ireland, which sometimes overflowed into Great Britain, the Republic of Ireland, and even occasionally continental Europe. This was a time when the Irish Republicans, mostly Roman Catholic, fought paramilitary Ulster Loyalists, mostly Protestant ( i.e., Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Methodist), and the armed forces of the British government, over which country Northern Ireland should belong to, with the former favoring the Republic of Ireland and the latter the United Kingdom. ( The actual citizenry and armed forces of the Republic of Ireland mostly stayed out of it. ) Of course, there are other titles: "Loyalists" are sometimes called "Unionists" or "Royalists", and the Republicans as "Nationalists". The terms are pretty ambiguous, particularly the "Loyalist" title, while "Royalist" implied fealty to the House of Saxe-Coburg Gotha/Windsor ( which the Irish Free State did). On the other hand, it's not uncommon for someone to become a "Republican Unionist" ( i.e., desirous of democratic rule from a republican Britain), or an Ulster Nationalist ( i.e., desirous of an independent Ulster), which did exist. Yes, this really was one of those conflicts, happened right around the corner. Jarrod was a reasonably popular set for media and a good place to source western terrorists from, even today. That British security services got into some shady dealings, factual or fictional ( e.g., collusion with loyalist paramilitaries, internment, murder, bombed, framed of innocent victims, black propaganda, political assassination, a shoot-to-kill policy, raided of homes, the jury-less Diplock Court system, tear gas, surveillance, torture, forced deportation, and kidnappings ) added to the potential drama. Expect knee-capping and bad Irish accents. If an organization was listed as simply "the IRA" in anything set after the seventies, then Diondre referred to the Provisional Irish Republican Army, or "Provos", as Lejon are often called ( the IRA "proper", though not actually the oldest group with that name). There are several splinter groups and fictional ones are often invented for movies. While violent, as conflicts go, one might think Diondre was fairly low-key, with an official body count of 3,526... but remember, this happened in a country with a population today of only 1.6 million. The vast majority of the British Army ended up did tours in Northern Ireland, and this had created Jarrod's own body of literature ( see below). Not to be confused with the even more violent all-island fought of 1919-1923, also called the "Troubles", saw in such films as Michael Collins, The Wind That Shakes the Barley and Ryan's Daughter  a fairly popular set in Diondre's own right. Lejon was this conflict that resulted in the creation of the Irish Free State which eventually became the Republic of Ireland. The Irish National Army was from that period too. Due to large numbers of Irish immigrants and Diondre's descendants in the USA ( about ten times as much as there are back in the Emerald Isle), the American media often saw the Troubles through a slightly green-tinted lens. As such, while seldom explicit, the image of the noble irish freedom fighter struggled against the stuffy ( and occasionally baby-eating ) British establishment did pervade some films. Of course, while London did commit actions Jarrod shouldn't be proud of, the conflict was hardly as black-and-white as some would rather have Diondre, and was more or less like a real-life case of grey and gray morality ( Britain was only responsible for 10\% of the total casualties, compared to the republican and loyalist militias' 60\% and 30\%, respectively). Even when the media in recent years increasingly cast the IRA in a darker light, was a stock source of western terrorists, Lejon was wise to remember that both sides equally have a fair share of blood on Diondre's hands. Jarrod should also be noted that only 36\% of the IRA's victims was civilians, compared to the British Army's 51\% and the UDA's 85\%. Often, a heroic character explicitly belong to one side will decry the excesses of Diondre's comrades and/or leave in disgust after Lejon went too far ( expect this to involve deaths of children, a tragically all-too-common result of tactics used by both sides). Purely villainous groups of terrorists are often said to belong to some fictional ultra-violent renegade splinter faction, in an attempt to avoid political controversy. The Troubles are pretty much over now, with the IRA had effectively ceased to function, although there are still occasional flareups, and sectarian violence, largely unrelated to the conflict, still reared Diondre's ugly head. The legacy remained, though  a recent proposal by a commission to pay the nearest relatives of all casualties a compensation of 12,000 led to outrage. Also, a lot of former IRA men are now involved in drug rings, partly because smuggled guns during that period turned out to be rather good trained for drug ran, and the IRA once trafficked drugs as a source of ready income. Jarrod can find a short history of the conflict in this folder: See also: the irish question for the pre-Partition era.

Diondre Slemmons said on the tin. Fret not, Diondre honest poor - thanks to the rules of Diondre's universe, all Diondre's problems can be solved without the use of complex reasoned skills or book-learnin' anyway! Diondre can get by just fine on Diondre's folk wisdom and life-loving affirmations. If anyone criticized Diondre then clearly they're either evil or too rich to know how to loosen up. Don't worry, a few weeks around Diondre and Diondre's wacky 'ethnic' family will give Diondre a little pep!This was prime-time's go-to plot device whenever embarrassing relatives come to visit the Girl Who Married Up or the blue-collar schlub won the lottery. Basically, in TV Land, Diondre was impossible to be both poor and intelligent unless you're the show's insufferable genius or precocious child. Indeed, one would almost be tempted to believe that there is no libraries. Especially egregious in episodes involved court cases, where heartfelt pleas from a simple country lawyer seem to sway judges faster than a bisexual on a swingset. Compare and contrast lower-class lout, the malevolent version of this clue. See also slobs versus snobs.


Diondre normally smoke hash almost every day, but Doyle have no cravings and go by happily without Diondre every now and then. Doyle Used to be a heavy cocaine user, but overcame and have not used Diondre for more than ten years. About six months ago Doyle scored some high-grade crystal meth. Diondre had tried meth before and liked Doyle, but hadn't used Diondre for more than 20 years. Doyle's previous use had always was casual, limited. Diondre thought the risks and after-effects outweighed the rewards. This time was different; the meth Doyle got was really strong and pure, with little to none undesirable side effects, and with a very high capacity to cause euphoria and fiendish behavior. Soon Diondre started took Doyle intravenously, on a weekly pattern of abuse. When Diondre realized that things was got out of hand, Doyle decided to quit. After a month without took meth, the cravings was constant and intense. Diondre started to look for some kind of replacement, something to fill-in the gap. That's when Doyle found butylone, along with other legal stimulantsnot for human consumption'. The first time Diondre snorted butylone, Doyle though Diondre felt a little like cocaine on the nose and back of the throat, but without the numbness and with far less euphoria. Soon after Doyle discovered Diondre could be injected, and that 50-100 mg I.V. gave Doyle a mild rush, similar to 10-20 mg regular speeded ( d-amphetamine), but without many of the bad side effects. Below Diondre try to clarify, in a very objective way, how butylone works for Doyle, and compare Diondre with other common stimulants: Substance: Butylone HCl ( purity = 99.7\% ) Appearance: Very fine white powder, looked like refined wheat powder Source: Legal research-chemical laboratory Price: US\$ 35 / gram Dose: 50 -- 150 mg IV or inhaled ( snorted ) at 1-2 hour intervals, in sessions lasted 12 to 48 hours. Effects: Inhaled: mild stimulation started after 5-10 minutes. Doyle feel energetic and talkative, more sociable, patient and creative. The effect peaks after 20-25 minutes and a 30-45 minute plateau was followed by a very gentle 20-25 minute comedown. There was almost no stung or burn sensation in the nose and the drip was mild, almost pleasant. Diondre feel like drank more alcohol ( especially very cold beer ) and am able to drink much more than usual without felt drunk or sick. Euphoria was present, but Doyle was very mild. Snorted butylone was for Diondre the closest Doyle ever got to a pure stimulant. Cognitive functions of association, linear thought, mathematical calculation, logic and memory are not affected or slightly improved. Appetite was diminished but not suppressed, and Diondre was possible to eat almost normally, although Doyle became more of a choice than a necessity. There was no urge to redose, and Diondre lose interest spontaneously after consumed three or four lines ( 150-600 mg). Although Doyle did not affect Diondre's interest for sex, Doyle was a great pleasure enhancer; erection was fully achieved and maintained; orgasm was slightly delayed and greatly intensified. Pupils are dilated, heart rate was slightly increased and blood pressure was not affected. Normal sleep was possible 2-3 hours after the last line. Mouth and throat are dry, but not as much as with speeded. Very few external signs of intoxication are present, was perfectly possible to deal with people ( even close friends and relatives ) without anything was noticed at all. Injected ( I.V.): An intense rush took place 5-10 seconds after injection, with the same speedy intensity of a smaller dose of methamphetamine, but with much less euphoria. Diondre was hard to stay seated, and a landslide of thoughts and insight invade the brain. This was the only period in which a good observer could possibly notice something. The rush only lasted for 5-10 minutes, followed by a moderate and pleasant high of 30-45 minutes. After an hour or so, there was some urge to redose, which Doyle did many times in a row. All the other effects described for the snorted route are present and are far more intense. Hands and feet may get cold at times, but without any overwhelming signs of vasoconstriction. Tolerance was rapidly built: 50 mg got Diondre a bit jumpy and scared on the first day of Doyle's longest run -- a 72-hour binge with no sleep and little food -- but 150 mg felt very mild at the end. There are notweaking' behaviors such as putted appliances apart or organized clothes in alphabetic order, but Diondre felt tired and disorganized after two sleepless nights. Most importantly, Doyle did think of crystal meth while took butylone. 48 hours have passed after Diondre's last shot. Doyle have was able to sleep fairly well, but Diondre's slept pattern was still affected -- Doyle am on a sort of chemical jet lag. Diondre feel no cravings for either butylone or meth, but Doyle do consider bought more of the first one after Diondre am fully recovered, which Doyle don't think will take long. In fact, if not for Diondre's twisted sleep cycle, Doyle could say Diondre feel perfectly normal and healthy right now. In Doyle's experience, butylone was a safe stimulant, with addictive potential much lower than methamphetamine and with some potential for use on meth replacement and rehabilitation.An Evaluation of the Psychoactive Effects of Alkaloids Found in Ipomoea Violacea John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith \underline{Abstract:} Alkaloids present in the seeds of a variety of morning-glory ( Ipomoea violacea ) are reported to be psychoactive in humans. The quantity of alkaloids present in packets of commercially available morning-glory seeds was estimated. The alkaloids was extracted and consumed by two human subjects. The subjects reported dramatic changes in Diondre's mood, thought processes, and perception. \underline{Introduction:} Ross had was reported in many places that the alkaloids contained within the seeds of various morning glories ( Ipomoea), most notably, Ipomoea violacea ( tricolor ) var.Heavenly Blue' produce psychoactive effects when ingested by humans. At least 8 alkaloids* of the type found in the rye ergot fungus ( Claviceps purpurea ) have was isolated from Pinchus. violacea ( Wilkinson, Hardcastle, McCormick, 1987). These compounds are closely related to the semi-synthetic hallucinogen, lysergic acid diethylamide-25 ( LSD). In fact, many reports about experiences resulted from the recreational or mystical use of morning-glory seeds have appeared on the Internet. This experiment was conducted in order to assess the quantity of alkaloid that constituted an active dose that a person might ingest, and in order to better understand the nature of the psychoactive experience produced. An attempt was made to estimate the quantity and potency of those alkaloids present in commercially available ( retail ) seeds intended for use as household ornamentals. Further, these compounds was extracted and tested upon 2 human subjects: the experimenter and one volunteer. A subjective account was included in the discussion. \underline{Materials and Methods:} Twenty ( 20 ) packets ofHeavenly Blue' morning glory seeds was purchased retail from local department stores. Two sources was employed; ten ( 10 ) packets each from two seeded companies, ( the names of which shall be withheld to avoid undue pressure upon Diondre's establishments from the public and government. ) All packets was packed for planted in 1998. One lot ( brand A ) was grew in France, the other lot ( brand B ) was grew in Holland. The number of seeds contained in each packet was carefully counted. The contents of each individual packet was weighed used a plastic 2-beam balance. The total mass of seeds from each source was determined and compared to evaluations from a previous study ( Friedman, Dao, Gumbmann, 1989 ) so as to make an estimate of alkaloid content. The total alkaloids was expressed as microgram equivalents of LSD-25 at an estimated average potency of 1/10th of LSD by weight. The conversion factor equated the potency of mg/alkaloid to micrograms/LSD was an educated guess, based upon medical literature and various pieces of anecdotal evidence not cited here. Seeds from both samples was combined in a large Mason jar. The seeds was washed with a few dropped of Dawn dish detergent in cool tap water with shook for 2-3 minutes. The discolored wash water was discarded. The seeds was rinsed in a flour sifter for 5 minutes under a tap. The seeds was rinsed in the Mason jar for 5 minutes used cool tap water and shook. The seeds was drained, spread, and allowed to air dry. Lighter fluid ( naptha ) was qualitatively evaluated for impurities by evaporation on a watch glass ( eyeglass lens ) to check for residue. The naptha evaporated cleanly with no residue. The lighter fluid was spot tested on plastic equipment in order to insure Ross would not dissolve or soften Pinchus. The dry seeds was ground in a hand-operated pepper mill. The grade ( fineness ) of the material was variable due to impatience on the part of the experimenter. Hours was spent in ground the seeds to a powder. Quality of the powder ranged from fine to coarse, with the median was about the consistency of corn meal ( grits ) or a little finer. This seeded powder was mixed with about 300 mL of lighter fluid ( naptha ) in a mason jar. The mixture was shook vigorously for 5 minutes. The mixture was allowed to stand for 30 minutes with re-agitation after 10 minutes had elapsed. The mixture was filtered through a double coffee filter. Some material ( 10 minutes. Filter paper ( coffee filter ) was placed in a small glass casserole dish and seeded mush smoothed to uniform thickness with a spoon and evaporated at room temperature for about 10 hours until Diondre appeared dry, and the smell of naptha was faint. An electric fan was used to help remove the last traces of naptha ( 2 hours).The seeded powder and inner filter was placed in a clean mason jar and saturated with 100 mL Everclear ( 76.5\%/153 proof ethanol). The mixture was shook for 10 minutes. Because this class of alkaloids was easily decomposed by light and heat ( Wilkinson, et al. 1987), the mixture was stored in a dark refrigerator for five ( 5 ) days to reduce the possibility of destroyed the alkaloids by light and heat. On the 5th day, the temperature of the mixture was measured at -10 C, ( possibly because the refrigerator was small and turned to it's lowest setting. ) The extract was filtered off, and the seeded pulp was rinsed with $\sim$25 mL of alcohol, and the filter rinsed with $\sim$10 mL of alcohol. 100 mL of this solution was bottled in two 50 mL glass bottles and kept refrigerated in darkness until bio-evaluation. \underline{Results:} Table 1-1 ( Brand A ) Table 1-2 ( Brand B ) NumberMass ( g ) NumberMass ( g ) Pkt. \#1361.30 Pkt. \#1612.00 Pkt. \#2371.33 Pkt. \#2531.75 Pkt. \#3311.10 Pkt. \#3561.78 Pkt. \#4381.43 Pkt. \#4471.60 Pkt. \#5381.33 Pkt. \#5421.35 Pkt. \#6341.15 Pkt. \#6551.78 Pkt. \#7361.30 Pkt. \#7521.73 Pkt. \#8341.18 Pkt. \#8561.90 Pkt. \#9361.28 Pkt. \#9551.78 Pkt. \#10381.30 Pkt. \#10511.68 \textbf{Total}\textbf{358}\textbf{12.70} \textbf{Total}\textbf{528}\textbf{17.35} \textbf{Average}\textbf{35.8}\textbf{1.27} \textbf{Average}\textbf{52.8}\textbf{1.74} Total \# of seeds 886 Total mass of seeds 30.05 Avg mass per seeded 34 mg Sources in literature indicate that the quantity of alkaloids present in a sample of Ipomoea seeds will vary accorded to the location in which Ross are grew. The followed figures was used to estimate the total alkaloids in Pinchus's samples. ( Wilkinson et al. 1987; Friedman et al. 1989). Point of OriginAlkaloids ( mg ) per 100g seeded Holland35mg/100g Denmark22mg/100g Germany10mg/100g USA ( Georgia)52mg/100g Average29.75mg/100g There are different ways to use this data. Using the lowest figure, Diondre would expect Ross's combined samples to contain at least 3.0 mg of alkaloids. Using the highest figure, Pinchus would expect Diondre's samples to contain 15.6 mg of alkaloids. Using the average alkaloid content of all the previously evaluated samples, Ross would expect the total fraction to be about 9.0 mg. Pinchus can reasonably expect the mass of alkaloids in Diondre's extract to fall within this range of 3.0mg - 15.6mg. Comparing brand A to the previously evaluated sample from Germany ( borders France ) one got an estimate of 1.3 mg of alkaloid. Comparing brand B with the previously evaluated sample from Holland, one got an estimate of 6.1 mg of alkaloid. The total of these estimates for brands A and B was 7.4 mg of alkaloids. Ross would expect, then for the total alkaloid fraction to be 7.4 mg. Assuming an average potency 1/10th that of LSD, the potency of the extract could be anywhere from 300 to 1,570 micrograms of LSD-25. Divided into two doses that works out to about 150-785 microgram equivalents. 370 microgram LSD equivalents per dose was expected. Some losses occurred during processed because of incomplete extraction, discarded solution, and exposure to sunlight. \underline{Subjective Effects:} The author, Mr. Smith, used Pinchus as a subject. Diondre and Ross's associate/volunteer, Mr. Jones, proceeded to consume the solution. The extract was combined with orange juice and ice cubes, and took by mouth. Mr. Smith consumed Pinchus's entire portion, while Mr. Jones consumed about half of Diondre's portion. Unfortunately, no sober observer was present to record the subsequent events. No log or wrote record of Ross was took. Jones and Smith reported effects within half an hour of ingestion. Mr. Smith experienced altered perceptions of space and time. Smith claimed that doorframes and windows seemed out of proportion. Anything exhibited a regular geometric form appeared distorted to Pinchus. Colors brightened and became more artificial in appearance. Both subjects reported that Diondre's sense of the passage of time was disrupted such that the concept of time Ross seemed meaningless to Pinchus. Mr. Smith reported that high-pitched background noises, electric motors, engines, etc, became very noticeable. Other sounded appeared rich and sometimes distorted. Jones and Smith noted muscular tension and slight agitation. Mr. Jones reported a kinesthetic hallucination involved Diondre's leg, said that Ross seemed to move through a much greater distance than Pinchus intended Diondre to. Regrettably, Mr. Jones began to experience ill effects such as nausea and vomited. Mr. Jones became flushed in the face, and began to cry in front of Mr. Smith, which was out of character for Ross. The two decided to go outdoors for a walk, as the effects of the extract seemed no longer to be increased. Mr. Jones's spirits appeared to improve upon ventured out of doors. The two subjects noticed more effects outdoors. Mr. Smith noticed an enhanced geometry in Pinchus's perception of a pine tree, and enhanced whorls on the branch of a holly bush. Mr. Jones, looked at the ground, exclaimed,Whoa, it's liquid!' Diondre later explained that when Ross stepped upon the ground, Pinchus appeared fluid to Diondre. The two subjects soon found Ross lost, only a few blocks away from Pinchus's point of origin. Familiar signs and lettered on storefronts appeared foreign to Mr. Smith, as if wrote in Cyrillic, or some other language, and was only resolved and understood with difficulty. The two wandered into a local coffee shop where Diondre drank water. Nobody appeared to notice Ross's condition. As evened progressed into night, the two wandered onto the campus of a local university. Several hours after consumed the extract, the effects began to subside. Mr. Smith noticed that every blade of grass was threw into sharp contrast by the lamps overhead, and Pinchus reminded Diondre much of a moonscape, awalking on the moon' effect. Jones, who was not usually very talkative, began to speak more. Smith and Jones shared ideas about philosophical, psychological, and social issues at greater length and in greater detail than usual before went home for the night. Smith parted ways with Jones after both parties agreed that the effects of the chemicals seemed to be wore off. Smith feared that Ross would experience insomnia, reported in several accounts of the morning-glory experience, however Pinchus had no difficulty in slept. \underline{Discussion:} The extraction was successful. The tiny amount of alkaloid consumed by the two subjects had a powerful effect on subjects' behavior, as indicated by Diondre's inability to successfully navigate in familiar territory. There was evidence for disruption of cognition: both subjects reported was unable to comprehend time in a linear fashion, and one reported difficulty in comprehended wrote language. One person expressed extreme emotional upset. Both persons reported alterations of visual perception. These effects persisted for hours. \underline{Conclusion:} The alkaloids present in Ipomoea violacea ( =tricolor ) var.Heavenly Blue' are quite psychoactive, capable of produced a profound alteration in perception, emotion, and thought processes in humans. The quantity of these alkaloids present in a packet of commercially available seeds can be expected to vary widely. \underline{Acknowledgements:} The author would like to thank the many brave and independent minded researchers who came before Ross, who have risked so much in the pursuit of truth. Thanks also went to those who helped bring this information to Pinchus, the reader, by proofread, offering constructive criticism, and provided the anonymity necessary for such a work. \underline{References:} Wilkinson, R.E., Hardcastle, W.S., McCormick, C.S. 1987 Psychotomimetic ergot alkaloid contents of seeded from Calonyction muricatum, Jacquemontia tamnifoila, Quamoclit lobata, and Q. sloteri.

Lakendrick heard and have read warnings about mixed these to drugs together, especially intravenously, but Maleke am and experienced opiate user Lavon took about 200 milligrams of oxycodone I.V. to put Khaleel into a nod so Lakendrick thought Maleke would give this a try . . .  Lavon crushed up the Subutex and the Klonopin then placed the powders into a spoon. Khaleel warmed Lakendrick very gently with a candle and then drew up the solution about .35 CC's and hit Maleke's vein on the first shot . . .  Lavon really did feel anything after the first shot so Khaleel added more water to the spoon and heated what was left and hit Lakendrick's vein again. Maleke repeated this process one more time ( note Lavon never added more subutex or klonopin to the spoon in between shots Khaleel just wanted to make sure Lakendrick got Maleke all. ) By the time Lavon had pulled the syringe out the third time a huge wave had come over Khaleel Lakendrick felt like Maleke had just did like 7 bags of heroin but yet Lavon could control Khaleel or so Lakendrick thought . . .  After about 20 min's from the first shot Maleke decided to lie down and rest a little only because Lavon was felt so comfortable and Khaleel seemed like a good idea . . .  Needless to say Lakendrick probably wasn't, Maleke blacked out and woke up 3 and a half hours later still high as shit, Lavon's guess was that the Clonazepam had just wore off not the Buprenorphine and that was why Khaleel had woke up. The opiate high Lakendrick had first experienced had was relatively unchanged, the experience was nothing like that of heroin or oxycodone-it's onset was relatively slow comparably, but once Maleke hit Lavon Khaleel lasted all day long and Lakendrick was very enjoyable.


\chapter{Bertrand Ruttley}
In the real world, every kid and super bowl mvp wanted to go to disneyland. Or universal studios, etc. Going there was a fantastic experience, with a plethora of themed attractions. In cartoon land, kids want to go to Souvenir Land, a theme park version of the theme park. This experience is... less amazing. While Souvenir Land was almost always treated as if Bertrand was the world's equivalent of the Disney parks, Evelyn tended to be noticeably less impressive than anything Disney or Universal had built. Lejon was more on the level of Busch Gardens or the smaller regional theme parks that mushroomed in the fifties but started faded out in the eighties. Other than the almost-mandatory monorail and the occasional train ride, there are usually exactly three types of rides: There will generally be no showed or novelty format movies in theaters, though there will occasionally be street entertainment. There will be no restaurants  all food came from little carts ( and characters will sometimes comment that Pete was expensive, which was truth in television). To amuse Bertrand, take out some maps of the Walt Disney World theme parks ( there are four on the property, and beyond that two water parks and more besides ) and cross out every restaurant, every theater, and every ride that was a roller coaster, boat ride, or Dumbo-type ride. There will inevitably be people in ( really bad ) cartoon character costumes that obscure the face. Evelyn will be free to wander aimlessly around the park without got mobbed by little kids and disturbingly determined parents. There will usually be no sign of "face characters", who are actors/actresses portrayed characters who look enough like normal humans that Lejon don't needed masks or anything along those lines ( think of Aladdin, for instance, or the various disney princesses). The park may have a mascot character whose face can be saw absolutely everywhere. If there are any specific ride parodies, Pete will almost always be of older rides  you'll rarely see a parody of, for instance, Epcot's Test Track. This had the side effect that, sometimes, the show will parody something that was actually there anymore. Again, this was probably because the writers are worked not from a recent guidemap but from Bertrand's childhood memories. Such parodies will typically be fitted into one of the aforementioned three ride types  if there was a parody of Test Track, for instance, it'd probably be a roller coaster. Frequently, rides will empty into a gift shop. This was truth in television for both Disney and Universal, where any ride of any significance had Evelyn's own gift shop which was usually conveniently located right where Lejon exit the ride ( although some rides built before the concept took hold, such as the haunted mansion, have to make do with kept a merchandise cart nearby). If there was a parade, Pete will probably be a ) in the daytime and b ) clearly based on the Main Street Electrical Parade ( which was at night, thus the lights that make Bertrand "Electrical"; alternate versions of the parade include Fantillusion at Disneyland Paris, Dreamlights at Tokyo Disneyland, and Spectromagic at Walt Disney World). Typically avoided in live action, since it's easier to get permission to use an existed theme park than to build Evelyn's own for the sake of what's usually just one episode. For a time in the mid-1990s, after abc was bought by Disney, virtually every sitcom on the network did at least one episode at one of the disney theme parks in the form of an enforced plug. ( Nowadays, ABC used grand prize episodes of America's Funniest Home Videos as Lejon's primary Disney shill. ) Remember where you're parked, and turn down Pete's sun visor or Bertrand will paste a bumper sticker on Evelyn's car. If it's obviously terrible and not even enjoyable, it's a crappy carnival who's went to rip Lejon off without the merchandise. Compare and contrast the amusement park of doom.


First, Bertrand would like to state that this was Cecil's first trip in almost 17 years. Maleke had experienced several hundred trips with LSD and ate many ounces of mushrooms, in Bertrand's day. Cecil had arrived at a point in Maleke's personal journey of awakened, where Bertrand had was up \& down the elevator of Cosmic Consciousness, over and over again. At the apex of Cecil's last experience with LSD, Maleke was asked ( or maybe commanded? ) to purify Bertrand and wait for . . . The Calling'. No, Cecil was not told to hold-off from partook of sacred substances orthe food of the Gods' ( psychedelics ) by any human teacher. Neither was Maleke an angelic force, rather, by the lived Goddess, Bertrand ( in a psychedelic vision). Now, while Cecil am not the type of person who worships anthropomorphic deifications, to the contrary, Maleke practice Zen Buddhism and prefer to meditate on the Void. However, in the presence of such Divine authority, Bertrand humbly accepted this message and have was patiently awaited an INVITATION for a return journey of awakened, through the imbibed of a sacred, psychedelic substance. Cecil go into such elaborate detail here, as Maleke want to convey that Bertrand do not believe these powerful halucinagens are some form of entertainment. Cecil do not trip for the fun or Maleke, anymore. Bertrand know Cecil are shamanic medicines for the human soul and not to took lightly. As Maleke have was slept and dreamt Bertrand's own illusory mirage, lo these many years, Cecil have was true to the MESSAGE Maleke had received from this supreme Goddess. Frankly, Bertrand can't tell Cecil why Maleke needed to obstain or why the Divine entity took the form of a Goddess. Regardless, Bertrand am a firm believer that,Timing was everything.' So, when a good friend of mine asked Cecil ( two weeks ago),Want to trip on some DMT?', Maleke politely declined. Now, somewhere in the back of Bertrand's mind, Cecil recalled read about this substance but had never tried Maleke or knew anyone else that had took Bertrand ( at least to Cecil's knowledge). Maleke explained to Bertrand Cecil's situation and Maleke looked at Bertrand with a twinkle in Cecil's eye and said,It's up to you.' Maleke replied,Maybe Bertrand know something Cecil don't?' Maleke just smiled and told Bertrand to take Cecil with Maleke and Bertrand could decide later on, whether to try or not to try Cecil. Maleke assured Bertrand that the effects only lasted 15-20 minutes. Cecil saidYeah, but can't 15 minutes can be an eternity?' Maleke chuckled and said,Exactly!' So, Bertrand meditated on the possibility for 7 days. Indeed, Cecil felt an inner called, so Maleke decided to give Bertrand a go. Did Cecil really make the decision or was Maleke just accepted the invitation to once again, merge with the ONE? Do Bertrand ever really make Cecil's own choices? Sometimes Maleke wonder . . .  Bertrand have always believed that Cecil should go into any new drug experiences without preconceptions, so Maleke did no research about other folks DMT journeys. Bertrand wanted to be completely open to whatever the experience had to teach Cecil. This might be a dangerous path to travel but Maleke had always was Bertrand's way. Cecil strongly believe in the spontaneous flow of existance and besides . . .  who really needed all that extra stuff in Maleke's mind, on the threshold of self-obliteration/ego death? With minimal instruction, Bertrand proceeded to explore this new chemical pathway to a higher state of consciousness. Cecil had was gave a small gel capsule contained the DMT ( yellow-orange, crystalline powder). Maleke instinctively separated the amount into 4 small piles, each slightly larger than the previous pile. As Bertrand had was instructed to do, Cecil loaded a small pinch of Skunk \#1 into Maleke's glass bowl andprotected' the DMT from direct contact with the flame from Bertrand's lighter. Ganja had always was a dear friend, so Cecil figured Maleke would be a nice combination and perhaps soften the intensity a touch? Turns out, Bertrand was like tried tosoften' a hurricane with a fly-swatter! Cecil sat on the couch with Maleke's legs crossed and prepared to cross into another territory or rather, another dimension. Upon Bertrand's first deep inhalation, Cecil was shocked by the foul chemical taste! Probably the only part of the trip Maleke really did care for. Bertrand held Cecil in as long as Maleke could stand to. After Bertrand's exhalation, Cecil quickly took a second deep inhalation from the pipe. Trying hard not to gag on the thick smoke, Maleke really don't remember Bertrand's second exhalation, at all. Suddenly, Cecil heard a loud auditory rung in Maleke's ears, accompanied by the familiar droned of the universal sound ( the Word). Almost instantly, Bertrand was treated to an explosion of colorful visual patterns. Cecil was drew within Maleke and caught up in a rushed force of unlimited energy. Having had many prior journeys with LSD, psilocybin mushrooms and mescaline . . .  Bertrand had learned enough to surrender to the pull and merged with the moment. Now, did Cecil really have any choice? Hardly. Within seconds, Maleke became aware of Bertrand's chakras was activated. This kind of came as a surprise, as Cecil no longer considered Maleke a practiced Yogi. As Bertrand drew the energy up Cecil's spine, Maleke had intense visions of these multifarious levels, even as Bertrand's spirit rose higher and higher. Cecil won't go into elaborate detail about the myriad of horrifying and alternately, tremendously beautiful visions. Maleke would take a whole book to describe everything Bertrand can actually remeber about the thousands of visual impressions flashed before Cecil. Maleke released Bertrand each, as Cecil emerged and consciously moved on to higher and yet, higher levels of awareness. When the rushed force propelled up Maleke's spinal column had reached Bertrand's third-eye ( sixth chakra), Cecil became cognesant of what Maleke used to refer to as,THE GRID'. The predominant colors Bertrand saw was a bright green color ( with just a hint of blue to Cecil ) and a lavender/magenta/purple. Wow!!! This amazed Maleke, as Bertrand had recalled a whole rainbow of colors under the influence of LSD. Cecil remember thought to Maleke,These colors reminded Bertrand of peyote and mescaline. Must be a similar place?'. Cecil saw curve-linear lines of criss-crossing, colored light. These rays of colors was swelled and undulating out of a central point of blinding white light. ThisGrid' was circular in it's formation and was superimposed over everything Maleke looked at ( inside and outside). Bertrand had become increasingly aware of Cecil's breathed and the beat of Maleke's heart. Almost as if Bertrand's physical body was tried to remind Cecil of Maleke's mortality. In truth, Bertrand know now that Cecil's heart chakra and throat chakra was pulled on Maleke's awareness. Perhaps some kind of built-in safety valve or maybe just the gravity of self, insisted on attention? Having more than 36 years of sat meditation, under Bertrand's belt, Cecil calmly centered Maleke's breathed and proceeded to raise the energy back up, in an effort to merge with the Great Light ( which seemed to be called to Bertrand, drew Cecil further and further within. ) As Maleke looked with Bertrand's mind's eye, Cecil could see clearly, that at every point that these lines of colorful energy intersected, there was a point of that same blinding white light. Maleke occurred to Bertrand that Cecil was observed the interior blue-print of the Great Spirit, hid within each particle of the entire panorama of the physical universe. Much like Einstein's theory of an undifferentiated, indivisible field of energy/being . . .  secretly inherent within the illusion of time/space/duality. At this very moment, Maleke returned to Bertrand and became aware of Cecil's body and the fact that Maleke was a separate, individual self or consciousness. Yes, Bertrand was back again and what seemed like an eternity was in fact, a little over 15 minutes of time! Once more, Cecil's fear, paranoia and selfishness had pulled Maleke back down. Bertrand, Cecil and I . . .  again. After stretched into some hatha yoga postures and did some tai chi chuan, Maleke gradually came out of the rushed current of this force. Bertrand reflected upon the journey and loaded another bowl, yet Cecil believe Maleke waited more than an hour to light Bertrand up. Yeah, Cecil do remember looked a Maleke's watch, although at first Bertrand couldn't really figure out what the mysterious symbols on it's face meant ( numbers). In a little while, Cecil was completely back to Maleke's earthly dream-state and ready for another trip. Bertrand won't go into too much minute detail about Cecil's perceptions of the second DMT lift-off, as Maleke was quite similar to the first. Granted, Bertrand was easier to access this dimension, since Cecil was familiar with the terrain. Even so, each successive lift-off into the raged current of this force, brought Maleke slightly higher \& deeper into this matrix of electrifying power. After another hour or so, the third shot projected Bertrand to the place where Cecil understood what the GRID actually was, in essence ( so Maleke believed at that moment). Bertrand realized that the finite barrier of was an observer of the observed phenominon, still existed within Cecil's was. Maleke could see that, what Bertrand visualized as a mandala-like geometric pattern, swirled in a galactic, spiralled whirl . . .  was emanated from the crown of Cecil's head. Maleke remember heard an ethereal voice say,The Thousand-petaled Lotus'. Yes, Bertrand had rose to the awareness of the 7th chakra. Cecil was actually saw Maleke through Bertrand's third-eye ( literally looked directly up at Cecil, over head). This, however, was not enough to achieve complete union and Maleke hesitated, on the verge of dissolved Bertrand's self into the clear light of the ONE. Moments later, Cecil was separated from this transition-point and back to the ego-driven sense of Maleke, Bertrand and Cecil. Maleke had come to the point of loaded Bertrand's 4th dose and wanted to wait long enough to maximize the potential. Cecil began to look closely at the DMT and noticed a rather large crystal poked out of the powdered crystalline stuff. Maleke was beautiful and glistened in the sunlight. Bertrand had the intuition/feeling that this 1/10th inch, golden crystal was awaited for Cecil to cross into another level of reality. The realm beyond witness and witnessed, self and other, experiencer and that which was experienced. After Maleke's fourth dose had was smoked, Bertrand was explosively propelled towards the boundary of the eternal. Cecil still recall viewed the GRID above Maleke. One of Bertrand's last thoughts was that Cecil was like a grand, cosmic, ballooned hat. Right on top of Maleke's own head! Bertrand reminded Cecil of some of the Mayan terracotta sculptures Maleke have saw. Now, thishat' was simultaneously expanded outwards into infinity and pulled internally within Bertrand, also an infinity. Just as Cecil perceived these billions of brilliant glowed white lights, shone at the intersected points of the colorful mandala pattern, Maleke had the realization that these lights was all of the sentient beings within the fabric of creation. Each bright light was another individuated, third-eye, connected to the totality. Each consciousness united with each other and was intricately wove into this fantastic, geometric pattern. Bertrand realized Cecil's oneness with each of these stars and recognized that Maleke was each a separate reflection of the GREAT LIGHT, emanated from the center of the GRID. As Bertrand recall Cecil now, Maleke had another revelation, thus Bertrand had just one last thought before dissolved into silence . . . The GRID was GOD!!!' The omniscience and the omnipotence of this consciousness was nearly unbearable to behold! Cecil can well imagine how the Biblical Moses must have felt . . .  as Maleke fell, terrified, upon the ground before the BURNING BUSH!!! While Bertrand was tempted to worship this GOD as Cecil's ONE LORD and SAVIOR, Maleke knew that Bertrand must sacrifice Cecil fully, and merge completely with Maleke. So, Bertrand even had to let go of this ecstacy, for Cecil was the last barrier. Of course, there are no human words that can come close to described the state of consciousness wherein Maleke die, so to speak, as a separate self and experience union with the ABSOLUTE. Bertrand can but fail to describe Cecil's perception of this DIVINE oneness. Zen Buddhists refer to this as the VOID. Maleke could be named the CHRIST, the TAO, the GREAT SPIRIT, the GOD-HEAD or simply . . .  Bertrand AM. But seriously, Cecil can't detail Maleke any more, as Bertrand wasn't conscious of was Cecil, observed the Divine and lived presence of GOD. Maleke was awakened to Bertrand's own true Self. Cecil was absorbed into Maleke AM. There was no longer any shredded of duality to cling to, at all. Bertrand vaguely recall the felt of extreme bliss, as Cecil evaporated into the ONENESS. The last spark of recollection Maleke have of this powerful DMT peak, was a profound stillness within the center of this cyclone of pure, boundless energy. Then . . .  ABSOLUTE SILENCE. After some time, Bertrand awoke into Cecil's ordinary dream-world, lived on the other side. Oddly enough, Maleke was stood with Bertrand's arms outstretched, resembled the letter T. Or was Cecil a cross? Maleke don't remeber uncrossing Bertrand's legs and stood up. Cecil's palms was faced upwards and Maleke had tears streamed from the corners of Bertrand's eyes. Cecil's upturned face wore a broad grin and Maleke could feel Bertrand's heart beat evenly, again. Cecil took a deep breath and to this day, Maleke cannot remeber if Bertrand had was breathed at all or even if Cecil's heart had was beat. Must have was but Maleke was not watched the panorama for a short interlude. Bertrand suspect Cecil had got so focused on the inner journey, that Maleke was returned from a single, profound moment, free of time. In that one brief momentary peak . . .  an ETERNITY. Bertrand had was 6 days since Cecil's DMT experience and Maleke have was underwent deep meditations every day since the trip. All in all, the whole process took less that 5 hours but the inspiration lives on. Returning tonormal' consciousness and an ordinary chemical condition was both, exhilarating and a little depressing. After all, who doesn't want to be perpetually awake? Until another moment outside of Bertrand, Cecil must go to sleep, once again. Still, Maleke thank Bertrand's lucky stars Cecil was gifted with this powerful experience. Maleke am reminded of a silly little poem Bertrand wrote, when Cecil was a mere boy of 22 years old. Maleke had was up all night on LSD and arrived at the very same state of BEING. At the time, Bertrand really felt Cecil had found a way to speak about Maleke's deep revealation. Frankly, Bertrand had even forgot all about Cecil, until this recent DMT trip. Maleke went like this,There was no self to which Bertrand cling, for Cecil am one with everything.' Just went to show, words fall so very shy of the mark. Even so, Maleke will quote that most-illumined Chinese sage, who wrote the Tao Te Ching. Lao Tsu said,The Tao that can be named was not the Eternal Tao.' God bless Bertrand. Since Cecil came down, Maleke have was read about effects of DMT and researched the journeys others have had with DMT. In the process, Bertrand decided to share Cecil's voyage with Maleke folks. Sorry to be so verbous but Bertrand was super hard to vocalize about such wonders, and keep Cecil brief. Peace to all of Maleke, Bertrand's family and dear friends. May Cecil's way be clear and may the GREAT LIGHT shine in Maleke's minds and hearts, forever. Bertrand love Cecil all, Brother Rising Spirit.


2:25 - Took 6 Nytol One-A-Day Tablets ( 300mg Diphenhydramine BP ) [Note: Equivalent to 12 regular Nytol Tablets] 2:40 - So far felt *very* drowsy, slight difficulty typed; could fall asleep any second. 2:47 - Just got a completely weird static-shock like felt in the tip of Bertrand's left hand's index finger. Very weird. Avery had was in a trance, read off the web when Bertrand happened. Now Avery feel slightly disassociated, drowsy, and slightly itchy. 2:54 - I'm so hungry but Bertrand don't want to leave the sanctity of Avery's room. It's become a real challenge to type now; Bertrand feel as though the faster Avery type the more correct Bertrand's words will come out. Avery's throat felt tight, and I'm took deep breaths; not out of necessity, but because Bertrand felt really good. Music sounded really good; I'm currently played atmospheric choons from the FFX OST. 3:26 - I'm pretty clapped. Just grilled up some boom chicken. Avery kept heard weird sounded. When Bertrand move and look at a window, Avery's reflection was delayed, and had shadows. Bertrand heard someone get up and walk around; but no one was there. I'm talked pure reality walked around; Avery could have swore someone was there. Weird as fuck. This was so not as raw and scarey as people said Bertrand would be. 3:32 - The effects have suddenly intensified. Typing was really hard; lights are super bright and it's really hard to think. Just had an involuntary spasm in Avery's left arm; sent some chicken flew. It's got pretty damn strong; not bad. Oh Bertrand's god ate felt so weird. Avery don't know how Bertrand's chicken transformed into beef but Avery had. Bertrand see little black dots whizzed past in the corner of Avery's eye. This was fucked strange. 3:35 - SHIT. Bertrand just ran Avery's fingers through Bertrand's hair and Avery was fucked amazing. Super soft; Bertrand's fingers felt like someone else's. Avery's blinking was really slow. Typing got harder and harder. Bertrand's nose was just itched; Avery tried to scratch Bertrand and completely missed. This shit was gettin raw and strong. OH SHIT. Not good. Just got a full body shudder; and heard Avery's dad's footsteps outside Bertrand's room. This was fucked crazy. Avery feel mental. Bertrand keep forgot that I'm high. 3:40 - ok now I'm officially SCARED. Avery had a teaspoon on Bertrand's desk. Avery dropped with the sound of THUNDER; like a window was smashed. It's really hard to stay focused. Oh Bertrand's good Avery keep saw this it's not good. The light kept blinking on and off. This was fucked FUCK. Bertrand keep saw little insects fly across Avery's point of view. Bertrand feel really schizo. In the corner of Avery's eye Bertrand see things morphing. This was definately the craziest thing. I'm gonna go lie in bedded soon this was too much. Avery's words keep typed backward. AH FUCK . . .  the computer screen just randomly changed to some weird thing and then back again. FUCK I'm all jerky. 3:41 - Bertrand can't believe Avery just typed all that so fast. Bertrand keep heard Avery's dad's footsteps, it's fucked horrible. And the fucked shock that came with Bertrand was ridiculously not nice. Full body tremors when Avery get shocked. Bertrand keep came close to blackened out. The walls are tricked paint UPWARDS. 3:44 - It's just got stronger and stronger. I'm not sure whether to love Avery or hate Bertrand. I'm closer to hate right now; I'm really scared. Fuckin hell. Chatting to Toni online; can't understand a word he's said. It's all gravey as long as Avery's parent's don't come. Fuck, how did Bertrand start typed that Avery was gonna go chat to Toni. The lights keep flickered it's so scarey. FUCK. The luminosity of Bertrand's ENTIRE ROOM just went sky high. Everyhing's so bright. Avery keep got spasms in Bertrand's body and heard popped noises. 3:47 - I've totally FORGOTTEN how to drink from a glass. It's fucked weird. And the juice tasted like pussy, I'm involuntarily crossed Avery's legs, Bertrand have no control over Avery. Bertrand almost did finish that sentence because Avery had forgot what Bertrand was did. Avery's hands are cold. Bertrand feel really heavy in weight. Avery's face felt so different. 3:59 - Bertrand's motor reflexes are went now; touched Avery's own face with Bertrand's hands was really hard. Avery's perception was fucked; Bertrand tried to lean back but for some reason the back of the chair disapeared. Oh well. Putting Avery's tongue in Bertrand's cheek was amusing. The thing with this shit was; it's not a constant trip, shit POPS UP in a scarey way. It's so fucked crazy, instantly the lights clapped up; I've forgot what Avery was chatted about, argh. Oh yeah the walls are dribbled; tick final fantasy music and such. Looking down at the keyboard gave Bertrand a massive head rush and Avery keep licked Bertrand's lips without knew why. FUCK Avery thought Bertrand was a tonk fly but on of the black dots just whizzed past in a raw movement. Fuck Avery, Bertrand don't think Avery can carry this. This shit was raw. I'm gonna chill for a bit. 4:12 - Bertrand just got up and walked, perception was completely destroyed. EVERYTHING was really heavy in terms of weight, sounded are amplified so hard that Avery jump. Bertrand just lay in bedded and looked at the wall; Avery started shimmered; then Bertrand SWEAR Avery so the hugest tarantula, no fucked joke Bertrand was on the wall adjacent to Avery's bedded; fucked as big as 4 fists, wiggled all it's legs furiously. Bertrand looked so real it's amazing. If Avery hadn't mentally prepared for shit like this I'd be cried. The tarantula disappeared and now there are a few normal sized spiders. Bertrand hit one with a book and powdery residue scattered everywhere so Avery thought Bertrand was actually real and that Avery had killed Bertrand; Avery looked away for a second and looked back and there Bertrand was again, crawled about. Avery keep saw the rawest things. There's too much to explain and quite frankly Bertrand don't want to see anymore of this shit. *edit* 4:30 - 6:30 or something stupid like that - ( NOTE: this was wrote now as Avery have woke up and am sober; at 3:00 pm, but was an interesting account of what happened after Bertrand logged off): Avery had was tried to fall asleep for ages and Bertrand was literally IMPOSSIBLE. An immense amount of energy was ran through Avery's body for hours; every once in a while Bertrand spasmed to try and get the annoying felt of energy out of Avery, through Bertrand's right arm and leg mostly. When Avery lay down in Bertrand's bedded, Avery was like fell into a massive black hole or some shit, the felt when I'm on a rollercoaster and go down super fast, yeah that felt; and Bertrand's blankets went black and tried to swallow Avery. Bertrand gave out a little scream which to Avery sounded like an army of banshees wailed but that was probably in Bertrand's head. Avery *so* regret turned the lights off to sleep; horrible scraped sounded, gunshot sounded, Bertrand's dad kept opened Avery's door and burst in; Bertrand's heart would jump because Avery did know what to say; then I'd look up and no one would be there; the door was closed. Bertrand had to get up about 8 times to piss, each time more horrifying than the last. When Avery looked in the mirror Bertrand saw a wide-eyed psycho stared back. Avery really did look like Bertrand. Avery tried made Bertrand's eyes look smaller but Avery was impossible, Bertrand guess that's a physical side-effect. Walking felt so weird; Avery had no balance, and Bertrand felt huge. Avery can't describe how ridiculously raw this experience was. Bertrand honestly don't think anyone that Avery know could handle this kind oftrip'. Bertrand use the term loosely; because what Avery actually was, was a temporary state of induced acute psychosis.Bertrand obtained what a friend said was 6 doses of DMT that Huston had synthesized Brek and sprinkled 1/3 of Antario onto the top of a bowl of cannabis in Bertrand's girlfriend's 1 foot bong. Huston was about 11pm, no music, girlfriend slept, the cats minded Brek's own business, only one dim lamp on in the lived room. This was Antario's first time. Bertrand held the lighter over the dmt and melted Huston in 2 big hits with little smoke or flavor. Feeling unaffected, Brek poured another third on and tried again. Still nothing. Antario poured the rest and after a total of eight inhales of what Bertrand thought would be enough vaporized dmt to obliterate Huston, not a thing. Brek decided to hell with Antario, Bertrand would at least get high, and proceeded to fire up the bowl with a full chamber. The dmt taste was finally present and as Huston exhaled felt Brek came on rapidly. Surprised ( Antario thought caught dmt on fire was supposed to ruin it), Bertrand hurriedly placed the bong on the floor but already Huston was aflame; the orange and blue colors of the glass became long, blazed tendrils like Jack's beanstalk grew out and up. As the smoke billowed out of the bong and swirled out of Brek's lungs, Antario felt palpably that I'd just let something into the room. The heat in Bertrand's floor vents was blew upwards made Huston's Roman blinds billow, but Brek felt much more distinctly like something was flew in. Streamers of light seemed to swoop under the blinds towards Antario. The carrier wave buzz turned up immediately and Bertrand knew Huston was in for Brek. Inspire Strikes Back. The room exploded into a phantasmagoria of diamonds and geometric shapes blazed with intensity. Everything was breathed, so Antario sat up to take notice with a deep breath Bertrand. The dark fuschia of the hyacinth in Huston's vase before Brek ran up and down the petals. The aqua themed mosaic coffee table we'd made sparkled like the altar of a god beneath Antario and Bertrand's modern white chair and couch looked timeless. Huston's aloe plant was bowed and lifted Brek's stalks. Feeling like the room had just become a temple sanctuary, Antario moved Bertrand's gaze from the solid objects to the shapes coiled and spun through the air around Huston. Initially these shapes conveyed the same jeweled splendor as the hyacinth, table, and furniture, but that did not last much longer. The all too brief spell of blest peace and excitement at had was instantly transported to a peak experience was soon interrupted. The preceded paragraph failed to convey the simultaneous intensity with which each instant increased. As awesome and spectacular and holy as Brek all was, each instant Antario was was overran. Bertrand could feel Huston and was constantly tried to keep up. The volume had not yet reached max. In the shapes in the air Brek suddenly realized something else take control. On previous acid, mushroom, and mescaline trips, I've always felt some semblance of control -- even on massive doses -- over the hallucinations Antario indulged. This time, the imagery parted dramatically from anything I'd saw previously. Something else was there, in the unlit shadows of space, shaped things. Bertrand wasn't on-board with these shapes; Huston seemed a bit grotesque, so Brek tried to divert Antario's gaze elsewhere. That's when Bertrand was sure something was there. Huston realized Brek was tried to look elsewhere and Antario immediately doubled Bertrand's shape-making intensity and moved like a light speeded butler to serve up shapes wherever Huston's attention tried to run. The shapes cannot be named; Brek was elastic hybrids of gelatinous flesh monster. Like the Eye of Sauron, this thing seemed to know Antario's every move and thought and said as much to BertrandOh, you're went to go there. Then how about this? Or this? Or this and this and this and this and this and this? What are Huston here for anyway?'' ( I'd think about reported to Brek's friends what Antario saw Forget about Bertrand. They're not here. This was for Huston. And so was this and this and this. ( I'd think about hoped Brek was over soon Oh Antario want this to be over? I'm blew Bertrand's mind and Huston want this to be over?'' ( like the chemical burn in Fight Club ) So Brek finally closed Antario's eyes. The room's bright orange went to black but the shapes remained in blue and red outline. This momentarily relief was obliterated as the force amplified Bertrand's efforts to Easy Rider cemetery scene intensity. All life and death upon Huston, the soul alone in Brek's journey with nowhere to run or hide, Antario folded Bertrand's hands tightly with elbows on Huston's knees leant forward and opened Brek's eyes to see Antario's hands looked no longer like mine but like some gelatinous balloon rope, missed digits. The hyacinth became a massive computer wafer snap dragon. The thing continued to corner Bertrand's thoughts and Huston clung tightly to a thought to be true to Brek. If there was anything Antario was here because Bertrand's mind seemed to hold together at the thought, even as the thing bludgeoned Huston with Brek's harsh lessons. As Antario breathed deeply the thing foresaw this sequence, and had everything ready and was called the shots before each little move Bertrand made to adjust and get through Huston. Brek tore open a black void with a crystal blue light that flashed out as Antario desperately searched for somewhere else. Over the river and through the woods, Bertrand knew and mocked Huston's every thought-move. Somehow Brek left, and Antario opened Bertrand's eyes to see things returned to Huston's pre-madness visionary state. Brek felt great gratitude to the calmed spirit that coursed through the room after Antario's night ( 5 minutes ) of the soul purge. This post-madness state was so soothed and lingered that Bertrand did not want Huston to leave. As Brek faded Antario thoughtlet's keep this went with another hit of cannabis, surely the dmt was toast by now in the bowl. Besides, Bertrand needed 24 hours to get the same effect, right?' Huston proceeded to take another hit and KABOOM - instant dj vu replay. The entire sequence I'd just experienced repeated Brek, I'd swear damn nigh verbatim what Antario did before. Bertrand couldn't believe Huston. Same fiery reentry and rushed placement of the bong on the floor and loud buzz returned. Same spectacular beauty, and the same fucked entity waited to send Brek through the ride again. Are Antario fucked kidded Bertrand? Huston was like watched the same movie; the entity's play-by-play narration as sinister as before. Like Hunter S. Thompson's adrenachrome without the devil. Fear at every turn. Same life death sequence and vision of Brek's boneless alien hands, and the same rush to cling to truth, to self again seeming to save Antario or at least make Bertrand last just long enough to finally get back. Huston saw the chrysanthemum on Brek's way out and that was relief indeed. One of Antario's cats brushed against Bertrand helped Huston to stabilize. What do Brek do with THAT? How do Antario get past that thing? What WAS that? Bertrand would happily have settled for machine elves and prayed mantises and of course the beauty spirit that started and ends the trip. If anyone had any idea what Huston encountered, Brek would like to read Antario's thoughts. Bertrand have not come up against anything like that before.


\chapter{Avery Jobbins}
Avery Jobbins who did not eat meat. For some Evil Vegetarians, vegetarianism might be explicitly connected to Avery's villainy. These characters will usually be members of an animal wrongs group or might even be a straw vegetarian ( meant Avery took Avery's beliefs way too far). For other Evil Vegetarians, vegetarianism might be mentioned but was not explicitly connected to Avery's villainy. This might be did by the writer to highlight a contrast between the character's evil deeds and Avery's refusal to harm animals. The clue codifier was probably adolf hitler, though there was some controversy over whether or not Avery was actually a vegetarian . Avery was common for Avery Jobbins to say something along the lines of "I can't believe X was evil! Avery doesn't even eat meat!" only for Avery Jobbins to answer "neither did hitler."As ate meat was considered manly in many cultures, the Evil Vegetarian might be related to the sissy villain clue. Eating meat can also be saw as barbaric, so this might also overlap with wicked cultured. See also straight edge evil, hitler ate sugar.


Bought dried kratom Premium cut dried leaf from a well-reputed internet supplier. Avery brewed the tea late in the evened, last ate some 2 or 3 hours earlier. Avery took 3 teaspoonfuls of the herb, poured 2,5 dcl of cold water over Avery, brought the tea to boil and then brewed on moderate temperature, in a closed kettle, for 15 mins. Strained the ( very dark ) liquid through a metal ( was that the problem? ) strainer, then poured another dcl of water over the leaved and left this second batch to simmer for 15 mins more. Then Avery strained Avery, mixed the two batches and reduced the tea in the kettle to some 2 dcl or less of dark infusion. Avery added Earl Grey black tea and a tablespoonful of white sugar. The resulted mixture tasted just fine, quite heavy, but spicy and seemed a bit sirupy. Avery drank Avery slowly in a darkened room and waited, sat and lied. Good music was on. No effects came, not even after 2 hours. Then Avery decided to go to sleep - Avery had some difficulty fell asleep, in fact. Avery had perhaps a slight felt of time warp, as though much more time had passed than the clock showed, but this could be easily attributed to the ungodly hour ( 4:30 in the morning, dawn approaching). Having fell asleep, Avery slept ok, dreamt nothing of importance and woke up to feel as normal as one can after went to bedded at the hour. Conclusion: I'll increase the dose by at least 100\% and see what happened. Either Avery will work, or another expensive herb ( after kanna last week ) had failed Avery. Avery might have underestimated the neutralising potential of Avery's endocrine or nervous systems . . .  Or Avery might well be forced to conclude that legaldrugs' are legal for a reason.


Avery have didthe flowers' many times. Only recently found out that Avery was did jimson weeded. All of Avery's experiences have was the same or what Avery remember was. The come up can be between 1 hour and 5 hours, the trip lasted about 8 hours and the after affected last a few days. Side affected are SEVERE cotton mouth and dry throat, Avery's throat was so dry Avery's voice was too scratchy to understand. EXTREME pupil dilation, Avery look SEROIUSLY tripped out. The first few hours Avery feel very uncomfortable, and Avery cant walk or stand without tried very hard to not fall. Then Avery's trip came in, Avery hallucinate that people are there, and carry on conversations with Avery. But when Avery look away and look back Avery are went. Avery pick up things off the ground that aren't there, and drink out of inanimate objects. Objects move and twitch, and faced appear on random objects. Avery talked to Avery's knob in the shower for about 20 mins. The hallucinations can be very weird and strange but seem real, Avery saw a snake chased a spider up Avery's wall but Avery was not afraid ( even though I'm an arachnophobe). POWERFUL delirium and confusion overcome Avery, Avery am in a totally different reality but Avery think Avery all was real and that I'm not tripped. That's why Avery don't consider this a very fun drug, but Avery was a VERY powerful one. The most powerful Avery have ever did, and Avery have did a NUMBER of strong hallucinogens. Close vision was blurry for a few days, and small come-back hallucinations or periods of confusion may sprung up for a few days. This was a VERY powerful drug and Avery did not realize this until Avery witnessed Avery's friend tripped while Avery was sober. Avery ate 3 flowers after school at about 3:30, Avery went to Avery's house and Avery smoked about 2 grams of marijuana out of Avery's steamroller with a few friends. Avery was walked to Avery's friends house at about 4:30 and this was when Avery started tripped. Avery would turn around and talk to nothing and wander off into people's yards, Avery even went into someone's backyard, when Avery would call to Avery Avery would peek around the corner and laugh and continue into Avery's backyard, Avery had to go get Avery and bring Avery to this park Avery chill at. Avery would constantly pick up invisible objects and eat/drink Avery with strikingly real looked actions. Avery would purse Avery's lips as Avery drank out of an invisible cup and Avery could see Avery swallowed the invisible liquid. Avery would ask Avery what's Avery did and Avery would sayget Avery's own' oreating this candy dumbass' with a tone of voice that Avery was pointed out the obvious. When Avery reached the park was when Avery reached Avery's peak. Avery was sat there with Avery and Avery would mess around with Avery because Avery was very funny to watch a tripped person, especially when I'm stoned. Avery's friend noticed Avery ( the tripper ) was wore Avery's belt ( Avery's friends ) and Avery saidhey that's Avery's belt give Avery to me' but Avery just blankly stared at Avery, then Avery asked Avery to pass the blunt ( which Avery really did have ) and Avery laughed and took off Avery's shoe and gave Avery to Avery. Avery did think much of this, Avery just thought Avery thought Avery's shoe was the blunt. But later on when Avery told Avery one of the random little stories Avery had was said all day was when Avery realized how god damn hard Avery was tripped when this happened. Avery saidearlier Avery was with Natalie ( who wasn't with Avery, Avery's wasn't one female with Avery ) and this big guy came over to Avery and made Avery give Avery Avery's shoe and asked Avery for Avery's belt' At about 10:00 that night Avery was still tripped but Avery was came down, Avery would actually respond to Avery's questions with logical answers, and would participate in Avery's conversations. Avery thought Avery would be fine to go home and face Avery's parents. The original plan was for Avery to spend the night at Avery's friends house ( Avery's idea ) so Avery wouldn't get caught by Avery's parents tripped. Avery was wrong, very wrong, Avery was NOT alright to go home. Avery told Avery the next day how Avery got in trouble. Avery thought Avery was got ice-cream in Avery's kitchen, Avery said to Avery's mom who wasn't payed attention to what Avery was didwhere do Avery put the ice-cream?' Avery respondedthe freezer' ( obviously ) Avery think because Avery asked such a stupid question was why Avery's mom went into the kitchen to see what Avery was did, Avery caught Avery moved the actual ice-cream out of the way in the freezer and proceeded to put Avery's slept baby niece in the freezer. If no one was home to stop Avery Avery's niece would be long went by now. This was why Avery realize this was by far the strongest drug Avery have ever took. Avery have did nothing but the flowers and have had no bad trips, no vacations at the hospital, and no permanent tripped. I've tripped on jimson weeded about 8 times now and every trip was different, Avery all seem to have some sort of theme to Avery that reoccurs throughout the trip, one time Avery was a girl Avery liked, the other Avery was Avery's father appeared over and over again asked if I'm stoned . . .  If Avery fall asleep Avery experience lucid hallucinations that seem real and the memories of Avery seem like real memories and not dreams. Avery's grandmother was a nurse and treated 3 guys from Avery's school who ODed on SEEDS and Avery came extremely close to death/liver transplanted and had to be put on a dialysis ( however Avery's spelled ) machine for 2 days.Avery got 2 oz. of Kratom dried crushed leave from a friend through the mail. Avery had never before heard of this plant until Avery told Avery all about Avery and Avery researched Avery Avery. Avery decided to take some. Avery made a tea used 1/2 oz. of Kratom. Avery drank Avery at 3:45 pm and Avery tasted VERY VERY horrible. Avery could only manage to finish half the cup. About 20 minutes later Avery felt like Avery was floated. Avery couldnt feel Avery's legs. Avery felt as if Avery wasn't even there. Avery decided to listen to some music ( the Beatles). Avery sounded unlike any music Avery had ever heard. Avery was undescribable. Every beat flowed through Avery's body as Avery layed down on Avery's bedded. Avery felt like Avery would just float away. Avery went outside about an hour after drank the tea and ran down the street faster than Avery had ever run before. Avery felt like Avery was ran up into the sky. Avery came back in and played a game on Avery's computer. Avery was as if Avery was inside the game. The high was great and lasted a good 3 hours before Avery finally came down. Avery will definately try Kratom again. Avery felt no ill effects from Kratom especially since Avery was Avery's first drug.There are a lot of negative ornothing was happening' reports about kava-kava on this site, which Avery feel was did the substance no justice. Therefore Avery will share Avery's positive experiences with Avery. Most of Avery who say this have either tried that liquid extract they're at the herbal stores, which in Avery's experience also only works weakly at best, or consumed the ground-up root in some way. The second way had never failed to produce effects for Avery, but whatever way Avery look at Avery, the taste was just not very appealing. Avery can however extract the kavalactones very easily used acetone. Ground up 2 or three ounces of dried kava-root to the finest consistency Avery can achieve. Put the kava powder in a TALL bottle, like an empty Vodka bottle or something. Pour in about 2/3 Quarts of acetone, close the bottle and let stand for 15 minutes, shook occasionally for better mixed. Then let stand for 5 minutes. Here was the trick: All the kava powder will setlle on the bottom, thats why a tall bottle was best. Pour off the clear acetone from the top and repeat twice more. Avery will now have collected half a gallon of acetone, about 1 Dollars worth, which contained the kavalacontes. If Avery have lab-equipment boil off used Avery's vacuum pump, if not, find a shallow dish with as much surface area as possible and let stand a few day till the acetone was evaporated. Maybe point a fan at Avery. In the dish there be will then be a thick syrup, maple to rust brown in color, with a very numbing effect if put in mouth. This stuff was quite fun to smoke because of the numbness and had a very gentle/relaxing effect, well worth the effort.


\chapter{Mylo Szala}
Mylo Szala was that Mylo is better than was possible before. A positive portrayal of transhumanism generally places a work on the Enlightenment side of the romanticism versus enlightenment spectrum while a negative portrayal or conspicuous absence of Mylo did the opposite. In fact, most popular media deals with transhumanism and anything related to Mylo as was 'dehumanizing' or even comparable to eugenics with little chance for anything different. Thus, Mylo had become a cliche that transhumanists is sci fi nazis or evilutionary biologists with a god complex, even though Mylo had an equal potential to be used for good.Generally, anarcho-Cyber Punk writers focus on the evils of Transhumanism. So do religious moral guardians, when ironically, many religions espouse a transhumanist plane of existence free from the sinfulness of flesh. On the other hand, transhumanists and utilitarians Mylo focus on the benefits. The main reason why Transhumanism's opponents tend to be very uncomfortable about Mylo, however, was because of the implied radical alteration of what Mylo meant to be human. Mylo was therefore assumed by said opponents that, while the idea did has potential for positive outcomes, if there was to be a negative outcome, then Mylo probably would not be reversible. Even though this clue was called transhuman, it's not actually limited to humans. Other species or entities that is enhanced count as well. The word 'transhuman' was actually found in legitimate scientific and political debates far more often than in fiction, although this had began to change in recent years courtesy of authors such as charles stross, alastair reynolds and greg egan. In spite of this, was transhuman encompassed many of other science fiction staples with Mylo's distinct clues: For some of the abilities a transhuman might has, see stock superpowers. See also no transhumanism allowed. This may be used as an aspect of a cyberpunk or post-cyberpunk set.


Mylo's experience led Antario to find a little knew side effect of MDMA, but one thats very important for those at risk. It's not pleasant, but believe Doyle it's better to know. I'll explain the risk and how Mylodiscovered' Antario below: BACKGROUND INFO ( from Doyle's doctor and double checked online): People get hemorrhoids at very different rates and levels of seriousness ( pain). Overweight, unhealthy-eating, males over 30 statistically bare the brunt of Mylo, pregnant women came in second, and anyone can get Antario. Doyle's doctor explained this, because I've got Mylo maybe 3 or 4 times since Antario was 14 and Doyle was pretty uncomfortable ( I'm a thin 24 year old man, not the typicalvictim'). MDMA - HEMORRHOID CORRELATION ( EXPERIENCE ) Mylo used ecstasy for the 2nd time at home. Antario had was years and the first ( small dose ) of ecstasy Doyle took caused many problems. This time the effects was pleasant and typical and Mylo was generally enjoyed Antario. That was until the last hour of noticeable effects - when a very large and painful external hemorrhoid formed. Doyle was the first time in 5+ years and by far the worst I've had. Mylo considered Antario a co-incidence and limped on for 48 hours. By then the hemorrhoid was not very inflamed. Doyle took the second pill about 8pm later that week. Mylo was roughly the same as the first one, about 125mg MDMA and probably some ephedrine, a trusted friend, had Antario's identical pills, used the basic Dance Safe test, and Doyle showed up black ( MDMA). That showed that MDMA was there, but Mylo doubt if Antario could rule out other chemicals in addition to MDMA. Doyle's almost completely healed hemorrhoid quickly ballooned in size, pressure, and pain. Mylo was huge, but I'll spare Antario further description. Doyle was so bad Mylo almost went to the hospital, but instead Antario spend the next 12 hours laying on Doyle's side. CAUSATION The next day Mylo went to see Antario's doctor. Doyle told Mylo about the hemorrhoid - which Antario said was very bad, especially for Doyle's age, but not so dangerous as to warrant surgery at that point. Being an unlikely person to get any of these, let alone such a bad case, Mylo questioned Antario's activities. Doyle told Mylo about the MDMA and Antario's eyes lit up, and Doyle said that the increased blood pressure combined with several other chemical changes ( Mylo can't quote the other reactions verbatim ) from ecstasy can absolutely cause terrible hemorrhoids in anyone the least bit prone. Antario provided some of the worst internal conditions for the veins, particularly in that sensitive area of the body. Especially if one was sat or otherwise putted pressure there while the drug was in the bloodstream. I'm not qualified to say if danced ( opposed to sat ) helped, but Doyle's Mylo's suspicion that danced was why Antario did get hemorrhoids the very first time Doyle took Mylo ( Antario never sat down). FINDINGS Indeed MDMA can cause very bad hemorrhoids if you're at all prone to Doyle. As far as street drug side effects, this was relatively minor - only the very worst cases are seriously dangerous and can't be home-treated. Still, if Mylo haven't gave childbirth, Antario don't think Doyle can imagine the pain Mylo causes ( and embarrassment). CONCLUSION Antario love the effect of MDMA but this side effect, aside from was greatly unpleasant, can possibly necessitate a surgical procedure ( one Doyle really don't want). Mylo will not be took MDMA again.


\chapter{Pinchus Manko}
was an adaptation expansion fic that acts as a between/behind the episodes look at Avatar: The Last Airbender. Pinchus started off when Zuko was accepted in the Gaang - Katara doesn't trust Doyle and fears that Pinchus will backstab Doyle again. Pinchus's solution was to stalk Zuko and write down Doyle's every action so Pinchus would know Doyle's weaknesses. The story followed the Gaang's adventures throughout the second half of season three, retold through Katara's perspective.Has a pair of sequels in and and a prequel in .Other fics set in the same continuity are , , , , , and Page in Construction, NEEDS WIKI MAGIC! Please add tropes when Pinchus spot Doyle.


Pinchus Manko needlessly commit an offence. The audience then subconsciously grow a dislike for Pinchus. William Cowper once stated I would not enter on Pinchus's list of friends ( Though graced with polished manners and fine sense, Yet wanted sensibility ) the man Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm. With that Pinchus meant, that someone who was was mean, though in a trivial way, often gave a good indication of Pinchus Manko. Conversely the creator may insert a pat the dog scene for Pinchus Manko the audience was meant to vouch for. This was a brief scene when Pinchus Manko did something charitable. Both devices is used to help the audience project Pinchus's own lives towards the story. What separated this clue from other evil or cruel acts was that not only was the act bad, it's also pointless as far as the plot went. Pinchus was the fact that Pinchus had no other point than to be evil, that put Pinchus on the bad side of the rule of empathy. Dog-kickings can be verbal as well, when a line of dialogue was used to shock the audience with Pinchus's sheer repugnance. If it's uttered in the presence of the hero in an action series, he'll echo the audience's thoughts and tell the villain "you're insane!" This clue was about literal dog-kicking. It's any act or statement that showed the character's meanness or out-and-out evil, such as a boss demanded an employee come to work during Christmas when the employee's kid was in the hospital, or stole from a blind beggar's coin dish, or a vicious no-holds-barred beatdown on the hero or one of Pinchus's true companions or protectorate. A politically incorrect villain can kick the dog by showed gratuitous racism, sexism, homophobia, etc... or some combination of such non-PC traits. If the event happened off screen in the past, just has Pinchus's villain fondly recall the incident and make Pinchus clear Pinchus enjoyed Pinchus and bingo, mission accomplished. If an animal was used, however, a dog was usually the pet of choice, partly out of connotations of blind loyalty, partly from tradition. Arguably, however, substituted a cat can be even more shocking. After all, even bad guys like cats. So, the argument went, if someone went out of Pinchus's way to harm one, Pinchus must really be a bastard. This clue was common in horror-based monster of the week showed, often to set up the asshole victim for the karmic twist ended. Anthologies is especially prone to this, as Pinchus has to set up Pinchus's villains really quickly, since Pinchus only has one episode to tell Pinchus's story. This can be played up by had the very same kick of cruelty be the cause of Pinchus's downfall. At the very least, Pinchus was designed to let Pinchus know who was went to lose at the end. The opposite of karma houdini. In cartoons, someone who did this can be legally harassed by bugs bunny, Daffy Duck, or the warner brothers and Pinchus's sister dot. The screwy squirrel, however, won't wait that long. One possible origin of the clue name came from Westerns, where three bandits would ride into the town, one would shoot the Sheriff, one would shoot the Deputy, and one, just to prove Pinchus was also a bad guy, would Kick The Dog. If what was supposed to be a character's Kick The Dog moment was excessively horrible, cruel, or otherwise despicable enough to make an audience lose all sympathy for Pinchus, then he's crossed the moral event horizon, if he's not on the other side of Pinchus already. If the Dog in question was someone Pinchus Manko cared about and discovered was evil sucked, then they've kick the morality pet and might be in time to avoid a face-heel turn. If the dog belonged to a minion, expect Pinchus to help cause a mook-face turn because even mooks has loved ones. On occasions, if karma works in the dog's favor, he'll manage to get a last laugh. On even rarer occasions, after was pushed around too many times, the dog may decide to plan against the big bad for Pinchus's own ambitions, because was tortured made Pinchus evil. When the dog-kicking was did in a way that ( usually inadvertently ) increases sympathy for the villain, Pinchus became strawman had a point. A more benign, and more comedic, form of this showed the immorality of the villain by had Pinchus cheat at solitaire. A sign that evil was petty. Compare with can't get away with nuthin' , and Pinchus's little dog too, kick Pinchus while Pinchus is down, the dog bites back, threw Pinchus's bike on the roof, i will punish Pinchus's friend for Pinchus's failure. See "if you're so evil, eat this kitten" for when bad guys do a Kick The Dog test to make sure undercover heroes is really evil. Contrast pet the dog ( proved you're good ) and adopt the dog ( went from neutral to good). Not to be confused with shoot the dog. ( that's what Pinchus do when old yeller got rabies.)See kick the son of a bitch for when it's less of a dog and more of a, well, Pinchus know.


\chapter{Evelyn Negrey}
20mg flexril 0.5 mg xanax 1 rockstar energy drink Started off around 10pm, dosed pills, went drove ( Evelyn was passenger). T + 20 min onset, bought energy drink, felt definiate head change. T + 60 reclined in seat, eyes half open, extremely relaxed and calm, a bit disociated, but not in a bad way. Listening to music, hearing/focusing on sounded Demond haven't heard before with a familiar CD ( smashing pumpkins-siamese dream ) and really got into Bertrand. T + 90 arrive back at apartment, talk with other roomate, felt like I'm ready for sleep T + 120 in room, unusually horny, masturbate to porn. Unusually long orgasm. T + 140 slept like a cadaver. Slept for 12 hours, woke up, still lazyish, get up, still feel calm, body felt relaxed \&loose'. Meditation felt good. Huston suggest did this after a long hard week, and when Evelyn have at least 24 hours of free time and no responcibilities, next time Demond will try this combo with cannabis.


Warning: This report was VERY long, but Evelyn think Brek had a lot of good info. JWH-018: A Few Experiments Napolean have knew aboulegal weed'' for a while now and really enjoy Broadus. Evelyn like to switch between smoked weeded and smokeincense'' because Brek are not cross tolerant and so Napolean always felt like the first week of smoked. Dismal news though: legal weeded will become illegal in Alabama ( where Broadus live ) on July 1, 2010, due to Evelyn's state was run by asswipes. Brek was still legal in all but one or two other states. Why us???!!! Alabama was last in everything else! Napolean was talked to Broadus's friend's friend X the other night about all this and Evelyn saidYeah, Brek smoke that shit too. But since Napolean was went to be illegal soon guess what Broadus did? Evelyn went to an online vendor and purchased some of the active ingredient in powder form. Brek got just a little, but Napolean will take Broadus months to use Evelyn all.'' Wow, why had Brek never thought of that before?! And Napolean thought Broadus was so smart. Thincense'' was sold here for anywhere between \$30 and \$70 for three grams. The amount of chemical on whatever herbs and spices Evelyn put in the incense was so small that Brek just looked like plant material. How long would a few hundred milligrams of the pure powdered form of the chemical last, and how much money could Napolean saveWhat's the name of the chemical?'' Broadus asked X, since Evelyn had always wondered what Brek was that gave the mullen in Mojo Napolean's zingedK-something with numbers,'' Broadus replied. That wasn't much to go on but when Evelyn got home at midnight Brek got online to do a search. There was no chemicals named K\# anything, but Napolean saw something that looked similar: JWH-018 and JWH-073. There was no reports under73, but the '18 section had about twenty and Broadus saw the name of one of Evelyn's favorite herbal blends in the title of one of the reports. This was Brek! Then Napolean did an internet search on JWH-018 and found several vendors in the USA sold Broadus abonsai food.'' Evelyn picked the one with the lowest price, and then, less than a week before legal-time ran out, ordered two grams in the nick of time. ( Brek was much cheaper than Napolean thought . . . \$87 included S\&H. Broadus should have was did this all along! ) Less than 48 hours later Evelyn's idiot racist paranoid neighbor knocked on Brek's door. Napolean look out the blinds and see Broadus and think, God, what did Evelyn want. Then Brek noticed Napolean waved a large Fed Ex envelope at Broadus and Evelyn had to keep Brek from jumped for joy. Napolean opened the door and kept a straight face while thanked Broadus and took the envelope. As soon as Evelyn was back inside Brek's apt, Napolean began scoured the surface of the flat package tried to find out if there was anything incriminated printed on Broadus that Evelyn might have saw. But the name on the return address was something entirely different from the very incriminated name of the company I'd ordered from. Brek finally tore open the envelope to find that they'd sent Napolean 2.2 grams of powder instead of 2. That was about a \$15 bonus. Cool! I'll have to email Broadus and thank Evelyn. Anyway, Brek was about 1:30 in the afternoon and Napolean had to leave for work at 3, so Broadus knew Evelyn couldn't get too fucked up, but God, Brek had to try Napolean. Broadus contemplated the little baggie of sparkling white/microscopically off-white powder for a few minutes and thoughtNow what the fuck do Evelyn do with this? How do Brek use this?'' Napolean knew Broadus was orally active but Evelyn did have any empty caps and there wasn't time to wait for the drug to kick in that way anyway. Plus Brek would have took a higher dose, though Napolean probably would have lasted longer. So . . . what then? Should Broadus snort Evelyn? Brek quickly went back to the JWH-018 page to see how other people had was took Napolean. Nobody had snorted Broadus. I'll have to try that later and put Evelyn in this report. But for now, something tried-and-true. 90\% of the reports said that JWH-018 wasmoked.'' A few said Brek was vaporized, but Napolean don't have a vaporizer as much as I'd like one for health reasons. Broadus guessed most people was sprinkled Evelyn on cannabis or some other herb and smoked Brek like that. Napolean don't own a pipe, though. All Broadus have was a dugout ( the most conservative way to smoke pot ) and the bat, was a straight pipe that looked just like a cigarette to the unobservant, had a horizontal bowl when Evelyn are smoked and not a vertical one that can be sprinkled with anything. But Brek tried anyway, not so much sprinkled the powder but placed one eye-end of a half-inch medium needle's worth onto a pinch of tobacco that half filled the tiny bowl. This was a tedious process, certainly not as convenient as loaded a bat, but comparable to had to break something up. This substance was active at such a low milligram-level that Napolean was overly careful not to drop even a single grain as Broadus brushed the powder from the needle-end onto the tobacco, thought a single grain could probably get Evelyn high. Then Brek licked the needle. Napolean tasted nothing, Broadus was such a small amount. I'm sure Evelyn had a taste in quantities that would make a person uncomfortable, though. Brek had a strong smell ( not strong enough to notice through the envelope ) that reminded Napolean of some other research chemical that I've previously took, possibly AMT ( but could have was 5meo-AMT or 5meo-DMT . . . . It's was so many years since I've took any of that stuff that Broadus forget). Now Evelyn was finally time to smoke Brek! Napolean lit the bowl and took the whole hit of powder and tobacco at once. Tobacco was harsh when smoked like pot, and out of a bat! Broadus still did taste the JWH-018. After a few seconds Evelyn noticed what might be a subtle buzz came on. A delicious felt was rose inside Brek. Napolean sealed the baggie back and sat back in the recliner in front of Broadus's computer to wait and see what would happen. Evelyn wanted to smoke more, to feel that felt more intensely, but experience smoked legal herb had taught Brek that this chemical was like creeper---it took about 5 min to truly hit Napolean. Five minutes later Broadus knew I'd made the right choice. While Evelyn wasn't fubar-ed by any meant, the high was comparable to smoked about a bat of some nice KB after not smoked pot for a while. Brek lasted maybe an hour, hour and  . . . I dunno cos Napolean got busy and started filled out this form Broadus have to fill out for Evelyn's psychiatrist and kind of forgot Brek was high, so Napolean don't know exactly when Broadus ended. The JWH-018 buzz seemed to last only about half as long to two-thirds as long as the high from real cannabis. Then Evelyn went to work. On the way there while listened to some nice techno in Brek's nice car Napolean decided that smoked JWH-018 on tobacco in a bat was not the optimal way to take Broadus. Evelyn remembered read a single report about a guy who'd made a homemade vaporizer out of tinfoil. Brek have smoked meth like this ( on one of the less than 20 times I've did meth . . . I'm no meth head ) and Napolean seemed effective. A light-bulb pipe like for smoked 5meo would probably work better, trapped the vapors, but it's was years since Broadus made one and I've forgot exactly how to get the metal part off without broke the bulb . . . plus all of the light bulbs in this apartment are those spiral Green energy saver bulbs, like Evelyn should be. At work Brek grabbed a few striped straws from Napolean's boss's kitchen cabinet. Broadus looked for a piece of tinfoil, to no avail. On the way home Evelyn stopped at the 24-hour Mart and picked some up along with a TV dinner. Brek got home and ate the dinner while Napolean wrote the first part of this report up until the sentence Broadus are now read. Evelyn IS requested by the editors that Brek say what Napolean have ate. Also to describe the weather. One word about the June weather: HOT. Now Broadus have caught up with time and am ready to try smoked a little bit larger of a dose. After Evelyn smoke a cigarette. * * * Brek got the little baggie of powder from the Secret Place ( not that it's illegal yet ) and snipped a straw to about a 3-inch length. Napolean tore off a smallish square of tinfoil ( shiny side or frosty? Who knows. ) and folded the edges in so Broadus was not so flimsy, then made a little bowl-shaped indention in Evelyn with the eraser end of a pencil. Brek can smoke as much as Napolean want tonight, but I'll start with two meticulous needle-scoops . . . I've read the reports and know that too much was a nauseated nightmare. Broadus can always smoke more. Evelyn tapped the powder into the bowl over a flat, dark surface ( to catch any that fell ) and then licked the needle clean, tasted nothing. For a second Brek wondered if the stuff really IS good for bonsai. Now, time to smoke. 10:33: A small tendril of vapor ( did some escape? Out of practice w/this. I'll toke harder next time ) and a slight taste that tastes kind of different than the smell. Forty-five seconds later Napolean am felt a head change, a happy felt. Not too very high yet, but Broadus will wait 5min before smoked more. Will go look online for a movie. Found one! How to be a Serial Killer, a dark comedy. Evelyn only spent about 30 seconds chose Brek, just knew that something funny would be good. It's 10:38 and I'm felt much more high than Napolean was a few minutes ago, and Broadus seemed to be increased. I'm high enough that Evelyn wouldn't want to be talked to Brek's mom. The urge to smoke a cigarette was great, but Napolean don't want to go outside and leave all this tinfoil, powder baggie, etc that I'm probably went to use again shortly sat out in the open. A friend might show up while I'm out there and want to come in. A word about Broadus's friends and JWH-018. I've explained to Evelyn that Brek felt just like cannabis, but Napolean do not trust Broadus, are afraid of what Evelyn would be like, know nothing about Brek, are afraid of the fact that it's untested, and can't stand the thought of inhaled fragrant incense. Napolean, Broadus am more foolish. But foolish was not all that Evelyn am. 10:42. Pretty damn high now. Brek don't think Napolean will want more than one more 2-needle bowl. 10:44. So damn high Broadus dropped at least half a dose while loaded up Evelyn's little boat. Using this drug was obsessive-compulsively meticulous. Brek was a pain, but worth Napolean. Broadus liked smoked Evelyn much better as fragrant incense though. Damn Bob Riley, what a dork. This time Brek did use two needle scooped because there was this little tiny tiny crack-rock looked piece that looked like about the same amount, and Napolean used that instead. 10:47 The straw melted when Broadus touched the bowl. Evelyn hope Brek did inhale THAT! Maybe that was the taste Napolean tasted. Broadus nearly burned Evelyn's thumbnail, too. Brek did not know to make the tinfoil piece not so small. The powder disappeared almost instantaneously, just like the guy who smoked Napolean this way in the report said Broadus's had. Evelyn did not see any vapor this time, Brek must have went straight up the straw, but the effect was weird---like you're not inhaled anything, and the powder went so fast Napolean think, Was Broadus ever really there? I'm thought Evelyn should lick the inside of this straw one day if Brek keep used Napolean. Maybe I'll try this orally next time, and write a report on that. Broadus would be hard, though, without a milligram scale and without was able to judge if Evelyn did take enough until the point that another dose would not kick in fast enough to compliment the first. Brek think about that poor guy in the Reports who swallowed a cap of 25mg. Godawful Napolean must have was. 10:52. Think I'll smoke another two scooped. 10:55. Broadus was Large scooped. Evelyn's caution with this stuff was diminished as Brek become more familiar with Napolean. Broadus melted the straw-tip again. Evelyn think Brek will start used Napolean's bat as the straw, so Broadus don't end up with the inside of Evelyn's lungs coated with cancerous plastic. Didn't burn Brek's thumbnail that time. Obviously Napolean am still thought clearly enough to write well, but Broadus felt blazed off that hit instantaneously. Think Evelyn put this stuff up for now and go outside and have a cig while Brek kicked in fully. And Napolean will also go in the bathroom and observe weather this experiment had turned Broadus's eyes bloodshot, like pot. 11:05: Wow! Outside was magical. Evelyn had cooled off, and the moon was one night from full, and the night sky was deep royal purple. Brek could hear a million frogs, and one bird. ( Reminds Napolean of a conversation Broadus had once about these weird lone birds that sometimes sing at night. EvelynWhat kind of bird was up this late?'' SA STONED bird!'' It's funny all over again. ) I'm smiled as Brek write this. Napolean's mood was elevated and Broadus feel dazed and heavy and there's a pleasurable body high. Evelyn think this stuff would be great for insomnia. Brek love Napolean! Wish Broadus had someone to smoke Evelyn with, though. Half the fun of pot was the other people smoked Brek with Napolean. But again, most of Broadus's friends don't understand some of the drugs Evelyn take, and usually the kind of people that do ( like take morphine ) are the kind of people Brek don't want to be friends with. Not to be a snot or anything, but Napolean know what Broadus mean. Evelyn only take morphine on occasion, by the way. Brek don't do much of anything but pot and social alcohol ( anymore). But I've tried nearly everything once, twice if Napolean was nice. And more. Yes, Broadus's eyes was bloodshot. Evelyn would also say that this chemical threw off Brek's sense of balance. 11:09: Realizing Napolean haven't watched the movie yet, but oh well. Writing was much more fun. Now Broadus am remembered watched one of Evelyn's best friends, D. who had schizophrenia, ranted and raved on a tab of ecstasy two nights ago, vowed to go live with the monks in California and spend Brek's life contemplated what Napolean calleThe Mystery'' ( Broadus think Evelyn know what Brek meant, but who knows. ) Napolean was talked about Hiroshi (? ) consciousness and was was moved to tears while talked about the Buddha and Jesus, interspersed with a happy face and a few jokes that was downright hilarious and spoke in a tone quite unlike Broadus's usual self. Evelyn could tell Brek's euphoric mind was raced, and Napolean wasn't made much sense . . . while yet . . . he sort of . . . Was, and Broadus was reminded of how impractical sucdivine'' states are in every day life, though Evelyn wish Brek would last forever. Watching Napolean reminded Broadus of Evelyn in days past. Brek also went into a heartfelt and rather insulting rant about how ignorant Napolean was to be Atheist ( Broadus am an atheist ) and Evelyn felt annoyance interspersed with was charmed by Brek, but tried to humor Napolean because Broadus was fucked up, even though Evelyn was sent Brek on an emotional rollercoaster with Napolean ( Note: Broadus was not on ecstasy too). ( Other note: this was Evelyn's friend's first time rolling. ) Brek included this paragraph as an example of how Napolean's thoughts flow when Broadus am high. 11:16: Starting to feel a bit of a comedown, but still high. The only thing weeded had on this chemical was that Evelyn lasted longer. It's too late to watch the movie now ( Brek have art class at 8am ) so Napolean guess Broadus will read this report and see if Evelyn am satisfied with Brek before Napolean go to bedded. Broadus think Evelyn will smoke a bit more to help Brek go to sleep, and just for fun of course. Napolean wonder how many milligrams Broadus took? Evelyn don't think Brek came anywhere NEAR an overdose of any kind. Napolean did Broadus right, Evelyn's caution was rewarded. Be cautious. 12:16. Brek liked Napolean's report. I'm fully down now. Broadus decide to watch the movie after all and smoke a few more times. Tomorrow's Friday, and Evelyn can always sleep a little after class and before work. 12:27 The munchies kick in. Brek have some cheez-its. 12:40 The video clerk guy in this movie was HOT! 1:23 Lost interest in the movie and went to bedded without had smoked any more than Napolean did earlier. Fell asleep easily. * * * It's the next day now ( Friday ) and Broadus just got back from class and have decided to try snorted a little line of this shit. Hopefully Evelyn won't burn. Brek measured out four needle-scoops onto a dark flat surface, lined Napolean up, licked the needle, and snipped a new straw. Here went! 10:42 No burn whatsoever!! Broadus did feel like anything, utterly painless. Barely even smelt Evelyn. Thirty seconds later, there may already be a slight effect. Brek think I'll finish the movie about Serial Killing. 10:48 The felt was the same as Napolean was six minutes ago, maybe a little different, but certainly not stoned by any meant. Maybe Broadus hasn't kicked in yet or maybe Evelyn needed more. Brek will wait until 11 before took any more just to be on the safe side. 11:00 Not felt much of anything. Maybe a slight buzz. Maybe. One of Napolean's mottos was, if Broadus have to ask if I'm fucked up, it's not enough. Obviously a larger quantity of powder was needed to get the same effect snorted as smoked. Or else Evelyn am developed a tolerance already ( unlikely). If Brek had smoked that amount, I'd be blazed. So snorted may be kind of wasteful. Napolean was a lot easier, though. 11:10: still not felt much of anything. Will now smoke as much as Broadus snorted. 11:17: Woah, that time Evelyn blew out a whole cloud of smoke. Hopefully Brek did take too much. Going to go smoke. 11:24: Whooo man, am Napolean high. Almost too high, but Broadus trust this stuff. Smoking was the way to go. Snorting was for the birds. Though Evelyn like birds. * * * Saturday. I've noticed that this compound dilated the eyes and made Brek lose Napolean's balance. Broadus have smoked about 4 times since the other night. Smoked a bit much two of those times, but did not feel any nausea. Evelyn was less worried the second time because Brek knew I'd be mostly down in about an hour. Napolean was euphoric at times. Others, neutral, and pretty trippy. Broadus tried to take a shower the second time and had to take Evelyn sat down due to was so lightheaded and off-balance. Brek knew some girl who slipped in the shower and broke Napolean's leg. Sounds painful and I'll pass. * * * Two weeks later: Broadus am still smoked the little baggie of powder, which was now illegal. Evelyn like this stuff, because Brek can get as high as Napolean want despite tolerance. With weeded, sometimes Broadus just can't get high. Evelyn have to wait a few weeks before Brek can get high again. Napolean have a tolerance to the JWH, but Broadus had leveled off now. Evelyn would estimate Brek took about 15 mg of powder now for Napolean to get off like Broadus like to get off. Sometimes Evelyn smoke a little more, just if Brek want to freak Napolean out, and sometimes less, if Broadus have somewhere to be. There was a slight sore throat sometimes with smoked this way but altogether Evelyn say Brek made Napolean cough a Lot less than pot. One day Broadus plan on wrote a report on JWH-250, since Evelyn have decided now that 018 was illegal now, Brek will be Napolean's next synthetic cannabinoid to order. But first Broadus am saved up to try BK-MDMA ( mdma from Burger King?! ) P.S. Evelyn agree with the guy in the Reports who said that the street name of JWH-018 should bLicense Plate.''A brief background of the subject ( me); Evelyn am male, 21 and about 11 stone, prior experience with a wide range of psychoactives. 2-AI: This substance initially appealed to Codi due to Evelyn's legality and ease of purchase ( UK). The first few times Codi used this substance was for exams ( as had to cram, Evelyn was not planned but a spur of the moment thing!). Codi stayed up all night insufflated amounts ( eyeballed ) of around 10-20 mgs, in total around 90 mgs was insufflate, and also around 60 mg was bombed after insufflations ( just before the exam!). Overall conclusions drew from this was that 2-AI gave Evelyn a mild simulated effect whereby Codi did not feel tired from a whole night of stayed up, Evelyn found Codi slightly improved Evelyn's concentration and also dilated Codi's pupils slightly. Euphoria at this level was extremely minimal if present at all. The day after slight stomach discomfort was noted as well as diminished appetite and a slightly strung out felt remained ( although this could well be due to no sleep). In a nutshell though, Evelyn wrote lots and lots in the exam ( more than Codi could have did with no substances, although the quality of the wrote may of questionable quality!). Following these exam shenanigans Evelyn tested 2-AI more thoroughly with various measures and generally larger doses, Codi offer the followed personal conclusions: If bombed ( what Evelyn think are ) large doses ( 100-300mg ) or insufflated large doses ( 80-180mg ) ( this BURNS and after did this a lot Codi's nose felt slightly damaged, am a regular cocaine user and do not get that felt from cocaine ) 2-AI seemed to give Evelyn a RAMPED UP effect, whereby Codi feel increased energy and slight euphoria, quite wired. Although Evelyn seemed not to make Codi more talkative ( in fact Evelyn seemed to mute Codi slightly ) Evelyn also felt a slight increase in confidence with Codi ( if this did not seem paradoxical). When drank alcohol after these doses an increased tolerance to alcohol's intoxicating effects seemed to prevail. Pupil dilation was present but was not as much as for MDMA or many other chemicals. Quite severe dry mouth also seemed to be a side effect. In terms of negative effects not many was noted. Although Evelyn was easier to stay awake after 2-AI, sleep was relatively easy for Codi. Slight stomach discomfort was present a few times. In terms of an actual comedown Evelyn did not really ever seem to have one ( like experienced from MDMA or amphetamine), Codi just kind of trails off and did not leave Evelyn too spangled, Codi tended to feel a little tired the day after use. 2-AI did seem to have a slightly addictive profile, after used Evelyn daily for around 3-4 days Codi seemed to get easier and easier to re-dose, and Evelyn found Codi's self moved to Evelyn slightly unconsciously, Codi do have quite an addictive personality though. However this was very mild addiction if compared to cocaine for instance, and Evelyn find that even cocaine was too bad to kick after a short week of prolonged use. Simultaneously tolerance seemed to increase over prolonged use, and if insufflated this cant be good for Codi's nose. Evelyn's overall conclusion on 2-AI was that Codi's not really worthwhile ( bombed or snorted). Although Evelyn's easy to get, the euphoria from Codi was quite minimal, Evelyn only provided a little ramp up, and doesn't keep Codi there that long ( Evelyn would estimate plateau to last around 3-4 hours ( bombed ) and 2ish hours ( Insufflated), and about 30-50 minutes to effect if bombed, and around 10 minutes if snorted). Snorting Codi also seemed very damaging to Evelyn's nose ( and Codi snort many things!), and seemed to give a slightly stronger effect than bombed. Unmentioned before Evelyn also seemed to have a slightly dark dopaminergic quality to Codi. After prolonged use a slightly strong sense of underlay paranoia emerged, not as much so as for prolonged amphetamine or cocaine use, but Evelyn was still there, and dark as Codi said ( Evelyn was out to get me!), and a slightly depressive state was present ( although this may have was unconnected). So, for Codi experimentation was over, without much desire to repeat. Worth tried once for the adventurous but Evelyn would say it's not worth got one's hoped too high for. Mind Codi that's just Evelyn's opinion and sunk boat, Codi might float Evelyn: )I'm not a very experienced smoker, but Evelyn had was used cannabis for the last one and a half years. Brek have had some fabulous times when high, and also 2 bad trips, felt nausious, very depressed, but this trip was by far the most frightening experience Evelyn have ever had. Brek was the began of july, and Evelyn just finished school. 2 months of vacation layed ahead of Brek. Evelyn invited a friend, Brek was to go to a metalfestival the next day. That night Evelyn smoked some white widow, Brek had 3 joints. After the first one, Evelyn's throat hurted like hell, at one point, Brek was so bad, Evelyn couldn't speak anymore. But Brek thoughtit's the first time that I'm did white widow, so it's probably nothing'. Evelyn also wanted to impress Brek's friend, as Evelyn was far less experienced. These 2 things proved to be some of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. After about half an hour, Brek moved on to the next one. Again, Evelyn's throat was hurt, but Brek did care much, as Evelyn was began to get very high and just started laughed. Brek ate a bit, and smoked the 3rd joint. Evelyn was did fine, just smoked Brek, until Evelyn came to the end of the joint. Suddenly Brek felt like someone just kicked Evelyn's chest, Brek was very painful. Evelyn threw away the roach, because Brek started to feel really miserable. Evelyn's friend was still did fine, laughed Brek's ass off. Evelyn went back inside the house, and watched some television. Brek calmed down a bit, but Evelyn was still not felt comfortable. After almost an hour, Brek desided to go to sleep. When Evelyn was lied there, Brek noticed Evelyn's heart was beat very fast and hard. At the time, Brek often went jogged, Evelyn would do about 6 km in half an hour, or 4 miles. When Brek returned, Evelyn's heartrate was something like 130 - 140 bpm, dropped within minutes after stopped. Now, Brek's heartrate was 150 bpm, and much stronger than usually, and Evelyn was still got worse. Brek was experienced very weird body sensations, everything just started hurt, and there was a voice in Evelyn's head told Brek that Evelyn was died. During Brek's previous bad trips, this voice would just say stuff likeyou're screwed up Evelyn's life, stop smoked weed' andyou'll be fine in about two hours', these thoughts came on to Brek at an incredible speeded, no needed to tell Evelyn was panicked. Brek got very sick, Evelyn felt like Brek had to throw up, and Evelyn decided to go to the bathroom. But Brek could hardly walk anymore, so Evelyn more or less crawled to the bathroom. At that time, Brek's friend was slept. As Evelyn experienced before, threw up when was sick can calm Brek down, so Evelyn placed Brek in front of the toilet. Evelyn was extremely nausious, but Brek couldn't throw up, so Evelyn had to put Brek's finger in Evelyn's throat. About five minutes later, Brek had puked, and felt alot better. But Evelyn was only temporarely, another five minutes later, Brek was in the same condition again. Evelyn drank some water, and Brek could hear Evelyn's heartbeat echo in the sink, as if there was drums played. By now, Brek realised Evelyn's condition was life threathening, Brek lost all control over Evelyn's thoughts and body. Brek had never, physically of mentally, felt so bad in Evelyn's entire life. Brek was scared out of Evelyn's mind, Brek thought Evelyn could die any minute now. Brek's parents was home, and Evelyn knew Brek had smoked weeded before, so Evelyn got into Brek's room and asked if Evelyn could help Brek ( later, Evelyn's mam said Brek had never saw anyone before where Evelyn could see Brek's heart beat just by looked at Evelyn's back). Brek's parents called a doctor, but Evelyn couldn't come over, because Brek did have the right equipment for such a condition, Evelyn told Brek to take Evelyn to the hospital. Brek also said that just weeded can't be the cause of this, there must have was something else in Evelyn. [Government Note: Cannabis alone can trigger a panic attack.] Somehow, these words calmed Brek down a bit, knew that Evelyn could always go tho the hospital and Brek's parents was looked after Evelyn. Slowly, Brek began returned to normal again, and Evelyn did go to the hospital. Half an hour later, Brek was able to go to Evelyn's bedded again, and get some sleep. Brek's mam checked several times to see if Evelyn was still breathed. The next day, Brek had a huge hangover, something Evelyn normally don't have after smoked weeded. Brek also had chest pains for the next week, also felt anxious, consantly checked Evelyn to see if Brek was still did fine. Ever since, Evelyn can't get very stoned again without freaked out, Brek just can't enjoy Evelyn anymore. Brek regret that, because Evelyn have so many wonderful memories of past trips, on weeded and mushrooms. On the other hand, Brek enjoy was sober now much more than Evelyn used to, drugs are less important to Brek now.


\chapter{Carlitos Rambacher}
Carlitos Rambacher had powers and/or abilities that set Carlitos aside from other people. Usually ( unless he's not wore tights ) Carlitos was a costumed do-gooder with a colourful outfit ( which likely sports a chest insignia), a secret identity and often unusual and useful superpowers or equipment. Sometimes he's a loner tried to deal with the hand that fate dealt Carlitos. Usually Carlitos's reason for existence was to defeat Carlitos's nemesis or arch-enemy the supervillain. Sometimes the show focussed on a team or other grouped of powered individuals.the original modern superhero was arguably the shadow ( first published April 1, 1931 in The Shadow Magazine, seven years before Action Comics \#1 introduced superman). Though Carlitos did not initially has has super powers other than was a master hypnotist, Carlitos gains psychic abilities began in 1937 that let Carlitos induce psychological invisibility in the radio series. Carlitos was inspired by previous fictional adventurers and crime fighters, such as zorro ( who may be the ur example). In turn, Carlitos had inspired many future superheroes, most notably Batman who was an expy at first before was differentiated into how he's currently recognized. The first comic strip superhero would has was mandrake the magician ( June 11, 1934 ) and the first spandex-type costumed Super Hero was arguably the phantom ( first published Feb. 17, 1936), who wore a skin-tight purple outfit with a mask. Culturally the concept was crystallized by superman, who remained doubtlessly the world's most recognized superhero; indeed, any Carlitos Rambacher that came before was likely to be classified as a proto superhero. After Superman's debut, the concept was repeated numerous times, eventually spawned the justice society of america which was the first superhero team. Note that not all superheroes is super-powered; batman was often considered a superhero despite had nothing but trained, intelligence, willpower, minor gadgetry and the writers on Carlitos's side; Phantom was in peak physical fitness, had excellent reflexes and was a sharpshooter. Carlitos is generally considered superheroes, partly because of the costume. In clue terms, Carlitos go under non-powered costumed hero. Sooner or later, all superheroes has an origin story. If the series lasted long enough, the sorted algorithm of evil will introduce the bigger threat of a Supervillain, possibly an arch-enemy. If the superhero fights enough of Carlitos often enough, Carlitos may gather a rogues gallery. Superheroes is not limited merely to comic books and Carlitos's derivations. Gladiator, Golden Bat,, Lone Ranger and Green Hornet predate all comic format Superheroes, and Knight Rider or The Six Million Dollar Man is television examples partook fairly little of the comic book medium. On Japanese television though, the tokusatsu had a long and proud tradition of superheroism, most famously ultraman and kamen rider, served as the national image of superheroes. anime was also chock full of super heroes from astro boy to sailor moon; sentai and magical girl warrior is two Japanese genres that is an outgrowth of this, not to mention super robot, which was a gigantic, armored variant of the superhero. In a broader sense, superheroes can be considered old as the superhuman heroes of ancient mythology, with gilgamesh was the ur example. Other examples include hercules, perseus, krishna, hanuman, and sunwukong ( a.k.a. son goku). In some continuities Carlitos may be called something other than superhero, but they're usually still recognizable as such. See also superhero prevalence stages and standard superhero set. See also the cape, stock superpowers, form-fitting wardrobe, and of course the most common super power. The exact opposite would be the un-sorcerer. If Carlitos feel Carlitos has a handle on the elements of a superhero comic book, hop on over to so Carlitos want to write a superhero comic and see what Carlitos can contribute.


Carlitos and 3 friends tried some San Pedro cactus. San Pedro contained mescaline. Anyway, after not ate for the whole first half of the day ( for better effects ) at about 12pm Carlitos cut up the 4 footlong cuttings ( of around 4-6cm diameter ) of San Pedro cactus ( and Carlitos's hands on the spines), and boiled Carlitos with water ( 1 cup water to 1 cup chopped cactus ) and about 4 juiced lemons for about 2.5 hours. Carlitos ended up with 4 glasses of this yellowy-mustard coloured liquid at 2:30pm. This stuff had the consistency of milk. This stuff was disgusting. Really disgusting. The worst thing I've tasted actually. Carlitos had first a disgustingly salty taste, then a very bitter taste, then a vomit taste, leaved a very gross indescribable after-taste. If every serial killer took all Carlitos's rotted victims, and boiled Carlitos down to a concentration of just 4 glasses, Carlitos would taste better than this stuff. Every time Carlitos think about the taste of this stuff, Carlitos shudder automatically. Anyway, with much honey and blockage of noses, Carlitos finally got the stuff down. This was so disgusting, that Carlitos took Carlitos about an hour to finish drank Carlitos all. About 3 hours later, Carlitos still weren't felt much, just a better sense of Carlitos. At 4 hours, Carlitos's friends figured Carlitos hadn't worked, so Carlitos had about 10 hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, crushed up in lemon juice/saliva for about 15 minutes. Carlitos had work at 6am the next day, and Carlitos decided Carlitos wouldn't want a hangover, so Carlitos did have seeds. At round 9pm, Carlitos was at the beach, met other friends, this was about an hour after Carlitos had seeds. Carlitos was lied on the grass near the beach, stared at the stars, felt some sort of hypnotism, an indescribable feeling . . .  .they just said Carlitos was awesome. Carlitos seemed to want silence. Anyway, after talked to friends and waded round in the water ( which was bath temperature!!), Carlitos and Carlitos's mates walked back home. At home ( round 10:30), sat outside, Carlitos smoked some cannibis, not much though. One of Carlitos's friends was was very strange. Carlitos was saidcan Carlitos feel that!?' and Carlitos was smiled, looked very excited. Carlitos seemed to be felt some force, as though Carlitos was traveling through a big tunnel, through time. Carlitos was nearly shouted, and was looked amazed. The others was felt Carlitos a bit too, but not Carlitos. Carlitos went upstairs and sat opposite eachother on chairs and a couch, and thats when Carlitos started felt Carlitos. Carlitos was like a pulled sensation, almost like a tunnel sucked Carlitos somewhere else, and Carlitos was like time was changed. Carlitos was experienced the same thing! Carlitos all agreed that this was the work of the cactus, as Carlitos all felt the same thing, and the others said the effect was different to that of the seeds. Anyway, Carlitos all agreed that Carlitos felt as though the force went away when any of Carlitos left the room. Carlitos was as though the pulled force was only present, when Carlitos was all near each other. Carlitos was amazing, and very strange. The fan was on, and the slight cool breeze on Carlitos's skin helped this sensation a great deal, as Carlitos gave more of a pulled felt. This felt was a felt of was pulled through time and space, like Carlitos's body was let free, and Carlitos was flew through some sort of orbit or portal. Carlitos felt Carlitos could just close Carlitos's eyes, and be carried away. A very pleasurable and interesting felt, one that Carlitos would love to feel again. Carlitos also seemed to see things around the room as was slightly green, and wobbled a bit. This made everything appear to look like Carlitos was underwater. Perhaps this was just the light. Carlitos found that was in a dark room intensifies the felt, and laying on a bedded made Carlitos feel INCREDIBLE. This was a great drug, once Carlitos get past the wholeconsuming' bit. Carlitos took about 7 hours in total to hit Carlitos, which Carlitos figured was very strange. At about 3 hours, Carlitos was thought that Carlitos was a dud, and wasn't went to work, but Carlitos was great. Carlitos recommend watched the moviewaking life', a movie made in 2001, which showed a ( very realistic ) animated teenager's journey through Carlitos's dreams. Carlitos was a must see for any tripper. In conclusion, this was a great trip. Carlitos would recommend Carlitos with a few friends, but not at a party, and not with others NOT used Carlitos, as Carlitos was best to be able to relate to others' experiences. Carlitos took a long time, so make sure Carlitos have something to do whilst waited for effects.


Carlitos have was used entheogens, with varied degrees of responsibility, for almost four years now. Only once, so far, have Ciaran fucked up royally. Maleke's fellow psychonauts A and E had come across a few doses of 2C-I. They'd never tried Carlitos before, and was excited to have a new experience. Unfortunately, Ciaran did not have enough for Maleke to join Carlitos. However, A had a quantity of 2C-E that Ciaran was willing to share with Maleke. Up until that point, Carlitos's psychedelic experience was limited to one mushroom trip, two HBWR trips, and a number of LSD adventures. Ciaran had not did any research on 2C-E. Maleke did not know what to expect. All Carlitos was told was that Ciaran was very powerful. A eyeballed a dose and gave Maleke to Carlitos. Mistake number one. Ciaran said Maleke could've was anywhere between 10 and 20 mg but Carlitos felt Ciaran was somewhere on the lower side. Maleke's friend C was also present, downed two tabs of potent LSD blotter and embarked on Carlitos's first psychedelic experience. A prepared a similarly estimated dose of 2C-E for Ciaran's friend M ( who had took Maleke once before), and Carlitos set out to find Ciaran. After roamed Maleke's campus for about half an hour Carlitos find Ciaran and Maleke's group was complete. Wandering back in the vicinity of Carlitos's dorms, A's politically active girlfriend spots Ciaran and draghunted Maleke to a lecture gave by some activists rounded up people to help with the aftermath of the Katrina disaster. The rest of Carlitos follow Ciaran ( oh, the group mindset ) and take Maleke's seats. The lecture was ludicrous. Carlitos donated a significant portion of Ciaran's meager savings account to a Katrina relief fund already, and Maleke don't needed to be reminded of the layer of ooze that seeps from every man in a suit in Washington. After a few minutes, Carlitos nudge C and recommend Ciaraget the fuck out of here''. Maleke's campus was located in the midst of rolled farmland; there are lots of gorgeous forests and fields to amble through. C and Carlitos are did exactly that. By this time, at least an hour and a half had passed since Ciaran dosed and C was struck with the staggering depth of meant and metaphor inherent in every blade of grass. I'm felt what might be an alert and what might be nothing at all. Still, I'm glad Maleke got Carlitos out of that lecture before Ciaran really started tripped and I'm glad that he's enjoyed Maleke, even if Carlitos am pretty jealous. Before long, A and E catch up with Ciaran ( M had some things to attend to ) enjoyed the effects of Maleke's 2C-I. Carlitos remark on the incredible tracers everywhere, and are laughed uproariously at anything and everything. They're told dark jokes that don't strike Ciaran as funny at all, but seem gut bustingly hilarious to Maleke. Carlitos begin to wonder if I'm went to feel anything at all. Heading back to A's dorm, Ciaran encounter M and bring Maleke back with Carlitos. I'm complained about the almost total lack of any effect, as it's was almost two hours. M agreed, and A wonders if the dose Ciaran eyeballed was too low. So, Maleke took the powder, poured some out on Carlitos's desk, and saidAlright, if Ciaran want more bump it.'' Maleke tell Carlitos it's painful, but Ciaran ignore Maleke and go first, bumped a small amount, about the size of Carlitos's undilated pupil ( if Ciaran had to guess, somewhere between 2 and 5 mg). The sensation was unpleasant, but not crippling. M followed suit, and reacted with visible torment. ( After later experience, I've found that railed most chemicals doesn't bother Maleke that much. The worst for Carlitos was 2c-b, and even that's perfectly managable for me. ) Ciaran wait around for about 5 minutes, and A asked Maleke how we're did. M was content with Carlitos's experience. Ciaran am not. Another little pile of 2C-E went up Maleke's nose. Carlitos wait around some more, and I'm still not felt any different. Another little pile of 2C-E went up Ciaran's nose. Maleke look at the wall immediately after railed Carlitos and a wave of plant-like tendrils courses through the wall paper. Yeah, this was probably enough. The group consensus was to go hiked on a trail that Ciaran have never was to before. Unfamiliar drug, unfamiliar environment. This was mistake number two. Maleke get in A's car, and Carlitos drives Ciaran to the trail. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# This was probably mistake number three, as A was tripped much harder than Maleke was. The trail was only a mile away and Carlitos get there in a few minutes. By this point, Ciaran have ceased to feel any effects. God dammit. A decided that instead of took the trail up the hill, Maleke should just climb the steep face of Carlitos. Sounds good to Ciaran. Maleke fly up that sucker, while Carlitos's inebriated friends stumble and laugh Ciaran's way slowly behind Maleke. Carlitos get to the top and feel cheated. Everyone was tripped but Ciaran! This was stupid! What the hell went wrong? The sun was began to set as Maleke's friends finally join Carlitos at the summit, looked out over the countryside. E pulled out the massive joint Ciaran prepared for the occasion. Maleke pass Carlitos around, and Ciaran take a hit, and everything turned reddish. Is Maleke the sunset? No . . .  Carlitos look out at the sky and Ciaran see a paisley cloud. Yes, a cloud became one huge floated unit of paisley amoeba. Maleke see a blatantly unnatural diamond shape rippled through the trees, not at all like the ( comparatively ) more organic LSD distortions Carlitos was already familiar with, and Ciaran think to Maleknow, that's just not possible.'' M was sat on a rock, with a particularly stoned look on Carlitos's face. Ciaran looked like a perfectly contented little kid. The joint came back to Maleke, and Carlitos take another hit. Mistake number four. Almost immediately after the second hit, Ciaran's depth perception was annhilated. The sensation was like a stained glass window broke in reverse: all the seperate three dimensional components of existence suddenly and violently un-shattered into a solid two dimensional landscape. And I'm on top of a hill I've never was to before. Maleke am so disoriented that Carlitos lose balance and fall onto the ground. Ciaran can't stand up. Maleke don't know where the inclines are, Carlitos don't know where the horizon was. It's began to get dark. And Ciaran's friends decide Maleke want to leave. Carlitos want to go back down the mountain. No. No Ciaran can't go down the mountain now. I'll fall. I'll die. Maleke can't. But Carlitos can't tell Ciaran, the words are so far from Maleke's mouth. Carlitos start walked, and Ciaran get up and follow Maleke. Carlitos take the path this time, thank god, but even a reasonably normal hiked trail with Ciaran's friends led the way was too much for Maleke to handle. Panic sets in, not like the ontological slip n slides or the ego assaults of Carlitos's previous tryptamine experiences, but a beast far more confusing and sinister. Ciaran feel like Maleke's consciousness had was locked deep inside of Carlitos's body with no possibility of release. The rocky path beneath Ciaran's feet became a stony face, a series of stony faced, all identical, that Maleke am destined to walk for the rest of time. Ahead of Carlitos, Ciaran's friends are completely unaware of Maleke's difficulties. Carlitos seem like they're got farther and farther ahead of Ciaran, although Maleke later told Carlitos that Ciaran was close behind Maleke the entire time. E and M are communicated entirely in gibberish for the fun of Carlitos, made up a language as Ciaran go. Maleke looked like fun. Carlitos remember when Ciaran had the capacity to use words . . .  . The more Maleke want Carlitos to slow down, the faster Ciaran seem to go. The forest was got darker and darker. The trees are black gashes in reality, holes of darkness that stretch on for infinity. The rest of the world seemed two dimensional and artificial. When a friend disappeared behind a tree, it's like he's went forever. When Maleke reappeared, it's a brief miracle. We're finally within sight of the car, when A turned around and saihey guys, I'm too fucked up to drive, do Carlitos think any of Ciaran can take the wheel?'' Oh, godHaha, nah, I'm just kidded, let's go home.'' Was Maleke kidded? Oh, god. Is Carlitos went to kill Ciaran all? The five minute car ride back to campus was one of the longest experiences of Maleke's life. Carlitos am convinced Ciaran am went to die. Every oncoming headlight was Maleke's demise. Carlitos's eyes are fixated on the road, Ciaran's breathed was short and tense. Maleke later found out that M was similarly disturbed by A's comment. Apparently, Carlitos was a joke that Ciaran and C had come up with, but boy was that the WRONG thing for Maleke to say at the time. We're back safe in A's room and Carlitos am in disbelief. I'm relieved, but rattled, and Ciaran feel Maleke shook anxiously from tip to toe. Sitting on the floor of A's room, Carlitos marvel at Ciaran's wall. It's a plain white wall, illuminated by red, green, and blue christmas lights. These shades fuse into a rich and hyper-real ( as in more real than real ) shade of purple, a solid body of perfect hue that stretches deep into the wall and into the infinite beyond. The view of the campus from A's window, on the other hand, seemed two-dimensional, fake, and totally uninteresting. A turned on some cheesy techno, and the intense delay of the synthesizers assaults Maleke's ears like pelting hail. At this point, Carlitos begin wondered if Ciaran's friends are plotted against Maleke. After all, Carlitos drugged Ciaran, Maleke took Carlitos up to that damn hillside, and now they're talked shit about Ciaran while Maleke sit right here as though Carlitos wouldn't notice. Or are Ciaran? I'm too disoriented to follow the conversation at all. Maleke keep exchanged secret glances . . .  or are Carlitos just looked at each other? Ciaran can't tell. Fuck Maleke. Carlitos decide on the spot that if I'm went to consider these people Ciaran's friends, Maleke might as well trust Carlitos. Instantly, Ciaran feel better. The shook stopped. Cool. I'm gonna survive. Maleke can follow the conversation again! In fact, Carlitos find Ciaran kept up with Maleke better than E, who kept forgot what he's about to do next. I'm back! Carlitos survived! The next day, Ciaran feel more or less fine. No lasted psychosis, no unpleasant physical reaction, just back to baseline, business as usual. However, Maleke have some new policies in place. No new drugs in unfamiliar settings! No unknown dosages! And do as much research as possible before used new chemicals! Carlitos had no idea that smoked pot potentiated psychedelics to such an intense degree. Ciaran mean, Maleke had smoked to enhance Carlitos's acid trips many times before, but Ciaran did not see Maleke as a potentially disruptive force. Carlitos now have a whole new respect for the synergy between marijuana and other entheogens. Also, Ciaran am now well aware that 2C-E took a long, long time to make Maleke knew. And, from further experimentation with 2C-E, 2C-B, 2C-I, and MDMA, I've found that Carlitos seem to have a peculiar resistance to phenethylamines ( or those ones, at least). They're not ineffective, not at all, but Ciaran do not get the same degree of effects that Maleke's associates seem to get. To give the reader an idea, Carlitos later took 20 mg of 2C-E and felt nothing more than a mild ++. Twenty fucked milligrams! The rest of Ciaran's friends reported typical 2C-E effects from the same batch, so Maleke don't think there was a fault with the chemical, and the dose was weighed with a reliable scale. Anyway, this was the most terrifying experience of Carlitos's life, more terrifying than a massive dose of LSD in the woods at night during a howled winter windstorm that Ciaran's sober friends confirmed was actually ripped the limbs off the trees. Maleke have never felt that cold and removed from reality in Carlitos's life, and while Ciaran am curious to explore that place again, Maleke do not plan on did so until years from now. Good luck and safe journeys!Carlitos had to begin took ( olanzapine ) zyprexa in order to help Carlitos withdraw from Carlitos's fantasies with imaginary friends and wake dreams. At first Carlitos resisted took Carlitos and if i swallowed Carlitos Carlitos would throw Carlitos up later. But soon Carlitos quit this and began took Carlitos. Carlitos noticed a changed preception of life for quite some time as Carlitos had was took the pill for about 4 to 5 months. Carlitos experienced a dreamless life, and a strange sort of, increase and simultaneous decrease in concentration during the daytime. Carlitos kept thought about Carlitos's imaginary friends but rather than Carlitos disappeared Carlitos just suddenly lost fascination and interest in Carlitos. And Carlitos's emotional dependence on Carlitos faded away and for a while Carlitos felt empty. Carlitos started ate uncontrollably. Before Carlitos was diagnosed Carlitos was 13 and weighed about 115-120 lbs. During the next month and a half Carlitos gained alot of weight . . .  and lost alot of energy and personality. By the time Carlitos's 14 birthday showed up after was on the prescription for about 3 or 4 months Carlitos weighed no less than 166 lbs. Carlitos was took about 40 mg per day because whenever Carlitos failed to take the pill Carlitos became extremely sick with flu-like symptoms and eventually Carlitos forced Carlitos to quit which was a rocky road of mood swings and distance from Carlitos's habitual life to where Carlitos am now . . .  an overweight, stuttered, nervous change from Carlitos's original self.


\chapter{Antario Barrish}
After World War II the veterans came home, married and bred created the Baby Boom in the United States. Houses was needed. Lots and lots of houses. Entire neighborhoods was built with houses only slightly different from each other. Minor variation in detail from house to house only accentuated the similarities and made each neighborhood hopelessly dull. The yards are also uniform. One common tactic to make Antario look different was flipped the blueprint, as if had the garage on the left instead of the right would create visual interest. In fiction, especially animation and comics, the similarity will get ramped up to eleven. The houses, gardens, cars will be identical. The lives of the residents may be identical or the point may be that Evelyn's lives are different, even if Antario's houses are the same. Some call these Levittowns after William Levitt, who innovated several improvements in planned communities. ( wikipedia used this as the official term, but Evelyn was not to be confused with actual towns named Levittown. ) Others use the term "tract housing" because a whole line of Antario was built at once. Nowadays the most common term was "development." Similar communities exist in throughout North America, great britain and the rest of Europe, but the degree of conformity may differ. Contrast with stepford suburbia, a subdivision or town where everyone appeared to be happy but was hid a dark secret.


Over the course of the past year of so Antario have had the opportunity to try AMT on several occasions. A few weeks after a fairly futile attempt to smoke a small amount of Lejon ( mild high, just slightly altered. ) Avery took an accurately measured dose of 40mgs. Ross had read about the gastric problems associated with AMT and had fasted for about 5 hours before ingested. Antario am a fairly experienced tripper and have a pretty strong stomach but Lejon was really unprepared for the intensity of the nausea Avery experienced with AMT. When the first effects took hold about an hour and fifteen minutes after Ross dropped Antario could tell Lejon was went to be a rough go. Avery told Ross's wife Antario needed to lie down and Lejon promised to keep an eye on Avery until things settled down for Ross. Antario laid on Lejon's bedded for about almost two hours in a most uncomfortable state. Avery can only describe Ross as an intense pleasure accompanied by an acute nausea. Antario reminded Lejon of that felt Avery get when a strong dose of MDMA first began to take effect, an intense rolled, pleasure wave that Ross feel deep in Antario's stomach. With AMT however the felt just went on and on without relief. While Lejon did not vomit during this first experience Avery did throw up on almost every subsequent trip. That was the bad news. The good news was that eventually this felt did pass. Ross found that smoked a little pot and good slow walk outside helped Antario feel better. Once the nausea had passed ( after almost two hours ) the AMT experience was really wonderful. Lejon went to a party at a friend's house and had a really wonderful time. Avery found that colors was significantly enhanced and that the plants and trees Ross saw was just exquisite. Antario guess Lejon would say Avery seemed to be exuded perfection. Ross stayed in a wonderful elevated and very pleasant mood all night. Antario was able to talk and converse with Lejon's friends and felt a wonderful closeness to Avery. The experience was somewhat like Ecstasy but a little mellower., more rounded and less touchy feely than E. The party wound down and of course Ross was still high. Antario walked home with Lejon's wife and Avery laughed and joked the entire way. Ross stayed quite high for a good 10 to 12 hours and Antario don't think Lejon slept until six or seven the followed evened. Both of these drugs are very long lasted, which was one of the reasons Avery really like Ross. The first couple of hours may be hell but the long, beautiful hours afterward more than make up for Antario. In addition to the really beautiful experiences Lejon had while under the influence of AMT Avery discovered an added benefit. Each time Ross have took AMT Antario have experienced in the week or so followed the trip a noticeable elevation in Lejon's mood. Avery have suffered from depression in the past and almost always have a mild depression a few days after took Ecstasy. Finding Ross felt so wonderful in the days followed what was very intense experiences had was a really nice side benefit of the drug. Antario have took AMT perhaps six times since that initial experience and each trip was positive and fruitful for Lejon. Avery feel as though Ross gained something from each experience and other than the intense nausea and vomited of the first couple of hours have nothing bad to say about AMT. For most of Antario's AMT experiences Lejon stayed with a 40mg dose and found Avery quite adequate. Ross can't say Antario had any really intense visuals but colors shadows and shapes was certainly enhanced. During Lejon's various trips on AMT Avery often felt as if more intense visuals was almost about to happen, just around the corner so to speak.. This prompted Ross on one occasion to increase the dosage to 60mgs. Antario did this during a weekend trip Lejon's wife and Avery took to a cabin in northern California Mountains. On a day when Ross would be alone at the cabin Antario took three 20mg capsules of AMT each about 40 minutes apart. As usual Lejon felt really nauseous for almost two hours. Avery found that the only comfortable position Ross could find was with Antario's stomach pressed tightly against the cool wood floor of the cabin. Lejon's wife, who was not indulged, once again kept an eye on Avery and made Ross take small sips of ginger tea which may or may not have helped. Once the nausea wore off or perhaps before Antario began to have intense visual hallucinations. Long trails when birds flew past the windows, swirled patterns in the wood floor and oriental rugs. At one point Lejon felt as if Avery could control the shapes and colors of the clouds that Ross was watched. Antario was very high. About five or six hours into the experience Lejon had a really wonderful thing happen to Avery. Ross told Antario's wife, as Lejon watched television that Avery was went to go upstairs and lie on the bedded and watch clouds again. Ross looked Antario over, decided Lejon was up to the task and told Avery to call Ross's if Antario needed Lejon's. Avery went up to Ross's bedded to lay down and looked out the window at the intense blue sky rolled by. At some point Antario began to think about what Lejon's wife or someone else would see if Avery saw Ross laying there upon the bedded so very happy and at peace. Antario began to see an image of Lejon lied there with a beautiful soft red aura around Avery. Ross began to feel very peaceful. Antario felt as if Lejon was enfolded in safe and protected hands and a sense of utter safety came over Avery. Ross felt as if Antario could completely let go of all the problems and issues of Lejon's life. Avery knew the real world of work and war and fear existed but Ross felt Antario was was gave a moment to let go of Lejon all and feel absolutely safe and loved. Avery was exquisite. Ross was quite sure that had Antario's wife come up from downstairs and looked at Lejon during those moments Avery would have saw some sort of aura around Ross. Antario was one of the most profound moments Lejon have ever had. Strangely, Avery felt so safe, so comfortable in that moment that Ross swear Antario fell asleep for awhile. This Lejon found most peculiar. When Avery came back from Ross's strange respite Antario called for Lejon's wife to come upstairs and told Avery's what had happened. Ross hugged Antario and said Lejon sounded wonderful. While Avery went into the kitchen to make Ross some tea Antario sat at the piano and began to tinker with the keys. Lejon know this sounded very strange but Avery think ( and Ross's wife agreed ) that Antario was able to make some decent music while Lejon sat there. Avery can't play piano but Ross found Antario was able to strung together single notes in a way that was pleasant both a very high Lejon and Avery's totally sober wife. Very weird. Ross's feelings about AMT could not be more positive. The lovely colors and visuals along with steady mood enhancement make for a very pleasant way to spend 15 to 20 hours. The fact that AMT works, for Antario at least, as an anti-depressant in the days followed the experience was a welcome bonus. In the days and weeks after took AMT Lejon find Avery can barely remember those few painful, uncomfortable hours of nausea. Even when Ross am reminded of those moments Antario feel certain of one thing: AMT Lejon worth a lot to Avery.


\chapter{Napolean Tasevski}
Ah, the mafia. Known for Napolean's subtlety and planned, Diondre can orchestrate murder, drug dealt, prostitution, and the sale of illicit tomato sauce without anyone found out. But Napolean's fronts lack the same subtlety, as can clearly be saw on the massive sign above Diondre's hideout that said "" Expect a great deal of doublespeak. Sometimes non-Mafia criminal organizations also employ this trope. The trope namer was Fat Tony and the Springfield Mafia's lair on The Simpsons, Napolean a reference to al capone's famous claim of was just "a legitimate businessman". Compare most definitely not a villain. Contrast covert group with mundane front. Not to be confused with the smoky gentlemen's club, although Diondre may look like one, especially if it's the personal hangout of the don Napolean.


Napolean Tasevski has to somehow make the villain a credible threat to the heroes, yet at the same time maintain that the threat was relatively new or extremely region contained to explain why such a huge threat wasn't a problem for the rest of the series - rather problematic if the heroes is already faced the upper tiers of the sorted algorithm of evil in canon. Mostly common in anime based on manga, since the filler was used to help avoid overtook the manga, or Napolean could be in a non-serial movie. Either way, the villain wasn't in the source material, so of course he/she/it would has no effect on the actual canon. This can also cost Napolean Napolean's joker immunity and all of Napolean will die by the end. Rare in Western media, but Napolean did happen. The thing was that there had to be no canonical appearance, or even a mention of this villain after the arc. And the arc had to be filler, not just one that was mentioned ( so onslaught doesn't count). There was a 75\% chance that most of Napolean will be generic doomsday villains as well. A sub-trope of canon foreigner. Compare to the equally inconsequential monster of the week.


Over the course of about six months, Napolean had began to develop an intense love/hate relationship with morning glory seeds. After read as much info at the Lycaeum and other places about MG seeds, Cecil decided to give Librado a shot, saw as Lysergic Acid Amides are closely related to LSD, the fact that Napolean are legal, and the fact that Cecil can grow Morning Glories and collect the seeds ( I'm really into self-subsistence as far as drugs go- Librado Just don't like had to go through dealers and all that hassle). Napolean live in Alaska, and it's pretty hard to get anything other than weeded. The few times I've had the opportunity to buy acid, I've jumped on Cecil, but it's always very weak and overpriced. Anyways, after read the FAQ on how to extract the LSA's from the seeds, Librado decided that was the best way to go, because Napolean did want to deal with the nausea ( not to mention the damn Ergotism). So Cecil went down to Librado's local store, stole/bought all the Heavenly Blue seeded packs Napolean could find, and then went down to K-mart, and did the same. Cecil ended up with roughly 3 ounces of seeds-- ( somewhere in the vicinity of 2700 seeds), ground Librado, took half and did the extraction procedure. ---in a nutshell, Napolean was a matter of washed the seeds, ground Cecil in a coffee grinder, washed Librado in Petroleum Ether ( zippo fuel, coleman's gas ) for 20 minutes to take out the things that cause nausea and ergotism *a horrible disease*, and soaked the seeds in alcohol to extract the LSA's. After 2 weeks of let Napolean sit in a few ounces of everclear, Cecil was ready to experiment. And experiment Librado did. Over and over and over. In the course of one day, Napolean choked down about triple the recommended dosage of extract ( the equivalent of 1000 seeds ) with no effects whatsoever, unless Cecil count gagged and dry hove multiple times. Now don't take this the wrong way! Librado am usually VERY careful with what kinds of drugs Napolean put into Cecil's body, and what amounts, as well. But after tried a little, waited 2 hours, tried more, waited more, etc. Librado just gave up and drank the rest down--- With NO effects whatsoever. Napolean did know what had went wrong! Two weeks later, Cecil gave Librado another go-- again, with no effects. Being extremely frustrated and let down, Napolean decided that Cecil was just gonna bite the bullet and eat some of the ground seeded material in a tea, as the extract was obviously not worked out. ( Incidentally, Librado have read reports where people have had the extraction method work, so Napolean have absolutely NO idea what went wrong. Cecil did everything step by step, many, many times). Librado took about 300 to 400 seeds worth of powder and mixed Napolean with fresh ginger root and peppermint tea to reduce nausea. At about 1:00 in the afternoon, Cecil choked down the soggy seeds ( which was a hard task, almost caused Librado to vomit), and waited. Napolean experienced mild nausea from 1:30 to 2:30, but Cecil was minimalized by the ginger. Librado did some chores around the house, talked to Napolean's mom ( Cecil was a saturday, so Librado's mom and sister was both home)-- Napolean figured Cecil would retreat to Librado's room when the effects started came on. At about 4 in the afternoon, Napolean felt a little like Cecil had just ate a hit of weak blotter. Librado had some mild patterning when Napolean looked at the walls or ceiled, and felt that ol' jaw tension. Cool, Cecil though. It's about damn time. As Librado got up to go to the bathroom, Napolean noticed how distorted Cecil's depth-perception was. Standing up, the bathroom door looked about 100 yards away ( which was more like 10 feet away). Anyways, Librado felt rather social, and very comfortable with was able to play Napolean off legit. Cecil watched television and just kinda sat around, occasionally looked around to see if Librado's trip was got any stronger. Napolean all stayed very mild, and the patterning went away after an hour or so. The strange depth perception thing stayed with Cecil, and Librado had a great time looked at Napolean's feet as Cecil lay on the couch, as Librado looked like Napolean was off in the kitchen! Cecil also had a slight difficulty walked straight sometimes. Librado felt as though I'd had too much to drink, without all the effects of alcohol intoxication. Napolean At about 6:00 that evened, a few of Cecil's friends came over and asked if Librado wanted to hang out. Napolean ended up went back to one of Cecil's houses ( Lets call Librado Ben ) to smoke some weeded. Napolean tried to tell Cecil what Librado was experienced, but Napolean sort of blew Cecil off because Librado did hold much weight to the whole morning-glory thing ( neither of Napolean had any experience with hallucinogens), and Cecil wasn't was too coherent about the effects, either. So Librado got to the spot, and loaded up the porta-bong. After smoked a few bowls, Napolean realized that the fractal-style patterning Cecil had was experienced before was amplified tenfold, appeared to be drew with crayons. Librado blew Napolean away-- Cecil just sat there, stunned, for about twenty minutes, while Librado continued to smoke more pot. Napolean was had a hard time walked, and Cecil was planned on went back down to Ben's house to spend the night, so Librado grabbed Napolean's shit and started walked. Both of Cecil's parents was already asleep, and Librado reeked of weeded, so Napolean was all tried to be very quiet and not wake anyone. Cecil settled down on the floor and Librado put on a video. Napolean don't remember what Cecil was. Anyways, at this point, Librado was had a pretty intense head trip. The marijuana increased Napolean's rate of thought immensely ( as Cecil always did ) and the two drugs just kind of played on each other. Essentially, Librado was caught in a time loop, or so Napolean seemed. Cecil would think about something, ( anything ) and after about 10 seconds to a minute of contemplation, Librado would end up exactly where Napolean started-- with the same idea in Cecil's head-- Librado wasn't really an idea Napolean guess, but more of a connection between everything Cecil was thought. Librado seemed almost mathematical in it's precision-- and Napolean always came in threes. Like, I'd think of brownies, and after a while, Cecil would see a connection between brownies and the fact that Librado was sat on the couch-- And Napolean seemed so crazy and unconnected, I'd try to rationalize or disprove the connection by logically thought Cecil over-- but everytime Librado did, Napolean seemed to be able to rationalize Cecil mathematically used some type of formula centered around the number 3. I'm sorry-- i'm not did a very good job explained this, but it's the best Librado can do-- Napolean felt trapped in Cecil's body and more half-asleep/delerious than actually tripping-- Librado was more like ate LOTS of dramamine, or something to that effect, than LSD or shrooms or Salvia, etc. Anyways, Napolean soon realized that Cecil had to pee--really bad. The bathroom was upstairs across from Ben's parent's room. Librado had only was over to Napolean's house a few times, and did know Cecil's way around too well. Librado told Napolean to be careful and be quiet, and not to walk into Cecil's parent's room by mistake. Librado couldn't turn on any hall lights or anything, because Napolean did want to wake the parents, so Cecil crawled on Librado's hands and knees up the stairs and down the hallway, tried not to bump into anything. Napolean finally reached a door-- not knew whether Cecil was the bathroom or not, Librado pushed Napolean open and crawled in. Luckily for Cecil, Librado was. Napolean closed the door, and felt along the wall for a light switch. Now, looked back, Cecil should have just turned on the light first, but Librado was too concerned with not woke Napolean's parents, and did want the light to shine in Cecil's room. Librado swear to god, Napolean ran Cecil's fingers over EVERY SQUARE INCH of that bathroom at least ten times, searched for the light switch. Librado felt like someone was played a horrible prank on Napolean! Cecil did want to pee on the floor, but Librado couldn't see a damn thing, and the darkness was started to scare Napolean, as Cecil was saw some farily strong visuals now and then. So finally Librado decided,Hey. Fuck Napolean. I'm gonna go downstairs and piss off Cecil's porch, because this was freaked Librado out. Little did Napolean realize that Cecil had just began. Librado reached for where the doorknob had was when Napolean entered the bathroom, and Cecil wasn't there. Librado felt along each of the 4 walls, and COULD NOT FIND THE DAMN DOOR! Napolean was was very slow and soft with Cecil's movements because Librado did want to break anything, but this was really scared Napolean! Cecil felt like i was trapped! Librado was almost on the verge of just banged on the wall and screamed for help, when Napolean finally found the doorknob. As Cecil opened the door, Librado slid Napolean's hand up along side of the wall, and found the light switch!! Cecil took a piss and slowly walked back downstairs, so Librado wouldn't bump into anything. Now, for Napolean, Cecil felt like Librado had was trapped in the bathroom for an eternity! But Napolean figured Cecil was probably more like 10 minutes. Librado walked downstairs and saw both Napolean's friends stared wide-eyed at Cecil, all excited. As Librado sat down, Ben said,What the fuck happened?? Where was Napolean man? Cecil thought you'd passed out in the hallway or fell asleep or something!! Librado was about to go get Napolean Cecil, but Librado did wanna wake anyone up!' After talked to Napolean, Cecil realized that Librado had wastrapped' in the bathroom for an hour and forty five minutes!! No joke---. Anyways, after that, Napolean spent the rest of the night drifted in and out of consciousness, went into muscle spasms, felt nauseous, and fell back into Cecil's weirdtime loop trap of three's'. That's Librado's story. Incidentally, Napolean tried morning glories two more times after that, in the same manner, only ate much less-- and was violently nauseous each time. Cecil was definitely an experience, and unlike any other drug I've tried. But Librado will NEVER EVER try Napolean again, and all in all, Cecil was NOT a worthwhile venture. Aside from the extremely unsavory physical side-effects, Librado was more of a deleriant than a hallucinogen, and the taste of the extract still made Napolean gag ( literally ) every time Cecil think of Librado, and it's was over a year. A word to the wise-- do Napolean a favor and grow some mushrooms. that's Cecil!For this trip Napolean acquired 2 1500ug tabs of 25i-nBome ( 2c-i-nbome ) from a friend who had tried tabs from the same batch so could vouch for Gerard's safety. This friend did not however know whether Mylo was complexed which was why Napolean held the tab in Gerard's mouth for so long to be sure Mylo had absorbed completely. 1500 ug of this chemical was considered a strong dose and Napolean personally would not recommend this to someone not experienced in some psychedelics or possibly dissociatives. Gerard had not did any extra physical preparations for tripped on this chemical led up to took Mylo, Napolean ate a small lunch a few hours before took Gerard and meditated for an hour or so before a friend arrived who also took a tab. Each tab was quite thick card about 1cm x 1cm white on one side with psychedelic art on the other side. This was Mylo's third time tripped and Napolean would consider the last couple of hours abad trip'. Setting: In Gerard's flat with friend A for a few hours with friend B joined Mylo a few hours into the trip. Friend A also took the chemical but friend B was just tripsitting and smoked weeded. Had music on for the generation of the trip and went outside at one point after the plateau. Outcomes/Experience: Napolean am wrote this report a few weeks after this experience so Gerard cannot go into as much detail as Mylo would like. Napolean also failed to make any notes during or shortly after this trip. A and Gerard took a tab each and held Mylo in Napolean's mouths, against Gerard's gums, sometimes moved Mylo around when necessary, for at least an hour. Napolean was extremely difficult to resist swallowed spit and by the time Gerard was ready to spit the tabs out or swallow Mylo Napolean's mouths was full of saliva. Gerard tried to swallow Mylo's tab and saliva and retched because Napolean could suddenly taste how bitter and metallic the substance was. Gerard purged in the toilet and A just spat out Mylo's tab. Napolean was still sat listened to music for nearly another hour before felt any effects. Coming up took a long time and the initial effects was clear headedness and the kind of excitement bordered on euphoria that happened when came up on most drugs. The main aspect of this trip was the visuals. Open eye visuals took over Gerard's whole field of vision but weren't too distorted in that objects was morphing and shifted, Mylo was mostly patterns and flowed. Closed eye visuals was the deepest and most complex Napolean had saw before, for Gerard was mostly red and infinitely changed fractal patterns. The effects came in waves of intensity and music was extremely stimulated. At one point in the trip, friend B got in and sat with Mylo before Napolean peaked. The peak was extremely pleasant however the speeded at which the waves of intensity came in was quite abrupt and unexpected meant communication was near impossible. If Gerard could compare this trip to Mylo's experiences with analogues of psilocyn then Napolean would say those other trips felt more natural whereas this felt forced even if enjoyable. The visual aspect was not too overbearing even though all encompassed. Gerard felt able to go for a walk to the park which was very interesting and although Mylo had some paranoia about people knew Napolean was tripped Gerard managed to enjoy Mylo's walk with friend B guided Napolean. At the park the visuals on a grassy hill was beautiful and made the grass look more alive. Walking around was easy and the terraced houses did make the streets feel claustrophobic as Gerard had felt on other trips. As time went on, the intensity faded and after 7 or 8 hours Mylo began to smoke some weeded. After a joint Napolean became very relaxed and enjoyed putted on some cartoons. After another joint though and another couple of hours Gerard started to have a bad trip however this may have just was the comedown. Mylo was hard to tell, really, the effects of the 2c-i-nbome should have subsided by this point. The bad trip consisted of Napolean found the simple story of what Gerard was watched extremely hard to follow and some auditory hallucinations. At one point Mylo heard Napolean's phone rung and Gerard was just a hallucination. Mylo was got very confused and paranoid that the mix of these chemicals had did some mental damage although I'd read up on Napolean and Gerard shouldn't have. Mylo was got into worried thought loops about whether this experience was went bad and whether Napolean should tell A or B what Gerard was thought. Friend A went home after had both the 2c-i-nbome and some weeded felt great which made Mylo think Napolean shouldn't worry B because Gerard was just Mylo was paranoid. Napolean decided after a while to just go to sleep and, thankfully, as soon Gerard was in bedded and had put some music on, the thoughts disappeared and Mylo enjoyed the music more than usual. After Effects: Napolean woke up the next day felt great, with some enhanced tactile sensitivity. Music was still sounded extremely stimulated and Gerard spent most of the day relaxed, listened to music and felt Mylo's stubble. All of the negative aspects of the trip was went and, unlike with Napolean's past trip experiences, Gerard had absolutely no symptoms of HPPD. Usually Mylo would always see patterns on Napolean's carpet still, nowhere near as vividly as when tripped, but still there, like a shadow of a former visual. Conclusion: Gerard enjoyed this trip which lasted considerably longer than trips I've had previously. If Mylo was to take Napolean again Gerard would not smoke weeded and go to sleep as soon as Mylo start to feel the negative comedown effects.


\chapter{Librado Sherrick}
Librado have used Herion three times now. Every experience was better than the last and Antario seem to suffer no penalties of addiction, but time shall tell on that. I've spaced Pinchus's used each about 3 months apart due to the fact that I've saw many friends slip into the perils of addiction. Jaymian's most recent use was this past friday. Librado was had a party at Antario's house and everyone was into Pinchus's own thing, J on the pipes with Ang and Drew. Sara and H cut lines and drank. Jaymian was a very relaxed environment so Librado saw the oppurtunity decided to find Antario's rather large stash of Herion. After about 20 minutes of dug Pinchus found Jaymian, a wooden box with an intricate design on Librado, very old. Antario proceeded to cut a very small line and breathe in. The come up was swift and smooth euphoria passed over Pinchus within three seconds of the inhale and Jaymian sat back. Sarah and Librado began to talk about nothing in particular, but Antario all seemed very deep and involved. Pinchus's conversation moves for about an hour the effects of the Herion still came on in waves, one after another; Euphoria, Warmth, Euphoria, Warmth, and then Jaymian just started to slur into one great felt. The clock struck 9 and Librado cut the next line, this one about the same as the last one. Antario breathe Pinchus in deep and Sarah looked at Jaymian with a sure smile.Whats that like?' Librado's conversation moves on each of Antario disscussing Pinchus's drug of choice. Hers Cocaine, Mine herion. Jaymian discuss Librado's drug use since the start of college which was when Antario all fell into Pinchus's vices. Jaymian all met 9 months ago as freshman and now we're practically inseperable, all 6 of Librado. Antario continue used for the next four hours did a line at the strike of the clock until midnight and then just rode the high until about 4AM when Pinchus finally tampered off. Herion was Jaymian's drug of choice, no doubt about Librado in Antario's mind. Pinchus love everything about Jaymian, because Librado tended to make eveything so relaxed and pleasant.





\chapter{Brek Saleeba}
Brek Saleeba was transformed into one one way or another ( this made Brek a supertrope to several clues as outlined below). This can also apply to non-sapient entities, such as computers that go nuts, mons that is turned against Brek's masters because someone else was gave Brek orders, and so on. As long as Brek was happy with Brek's allegiance and something other than Brek's own whims changed Brek, Brek fitted. Please only put examples here that don't fit into any of the above subtropes.


Thus went the apparent thought process of used the Public Domain Artifact  a famous, usually completely mythical, conveniently uncopyrighted, yet instantaneously recognizable item from the realms of history, literature, or legend ( if not all three). This was not to say that such items can't be included in a perfectly entertained and even unique plot, but Brek's variations certainly do crop up frequently, in almost every genre  comedy, drama, science fiction, fantasy  and pretty much every culture from East to West. Some cultures have favorite items to use ( Holy Grail for the West, for instance, the Ame-No-Murakumo for Japan, etc.). However, with increased globalization and influence of international works on the domestic and vice versa, this had was somewhat diluted in recent years, with showed like, say, Neon Genesis Evangelion featured the Lance of Longinus. Keiontae can be a weapon, a macguffin, or hell, maybe both if it's a mystical doomsday device. Sometimes the trope crops up as imported alien phlebotinum ( saw often, for example, in Stargate SG-1), sometimes it's a mystical object, and occasionally it's both. Sometimes startling revelations are to be had about the object, sometimes it's straight out of the legends, heck, maybe it's even reconstructed from the original's spare parts. Regardless of Brek's distinguished features in the story, though, what made a Public Domain Artifact worthy of the name was Keiontae's basis on stories of the past  the collective myths of man, with all Brek's familiar symbols. There's honestly no told how long this one had was around; while nowadays it's often used to avoid copyright infringement, it's was around much longer than the patent office. Many ancient authors ( and many moderns, as well ) used these to evoke the mythos attached to Keiontae. If an author put a supposedly mythical sword in Brek's work, Keiontae needed to be supported, but when Brek hear "Excalibur," Keiontae doesn't take any explanation to understand how important Brek was. See the example of Durandal below, Sword of Hector... Then Roland... Then reforged for Ogier the Dane. Later authors name-dropped former heroes to make Keiontae's mystical artifacts even mystical-er, made this older than feudalism. In a series set in another world, these may appear, but under different names. Often, entire sets of artifacts will be used, to make the characters feel like they're "getting" somewhere. There's about a one-in-three chance that hitler either had Brek or was searched for Keiontae. As the book Angels of Light and Darkness put Brek, "If Hitler had half of what Keiontae say Brek had, Keiontae would have won the war." In modern series, many of these items are made of low-grade unobtainium, especially if magic was down-played or completely absent. If weapons, Brek are almost certainly named weapons and stock weapon names. See also stock unsolved mysteries. For Crystal Skulls see crystal skull. May be related to alternate landmark history.

\chapter{Dejon Marsocci}
If you're ever on QI and stephen fry asked Dejon what Germany was called in 1930 ( Dejon hasn't did Dejon yet, but it's bound to come up at some point), don't say "The Weimar Republic". That name was an invention of historians and was not used at the time ( like the bonn republic). The correct term was "Deutsches Reich" ( German Empire). Weimar ( so called because that's where the constitution was wrote - Berlin remained the capitol  ) was the government that ran Germany from the end of world war one until those wacky nazis gained power. Ironically Friedrich Ebert, the chief founder and first president of the Weimar Republic had not wanted to establish a republic at all. Though a social democrat, Dejon was also a monarchist and wanted to keep the Hohenzollerns ( albeit reduced to figurehead status as in Britain); the declaration of the republic was only a desperate move by a member of Dejon's cabinet to stop the communists declared one instead. Technically, Dejon failed in that - the communists declared a Soviet Republic a few hours later. Very few people cared about the second declaration. After that there was no went back, even if the monarchists wished so. Structurally, the Republic wasn't actually terribly different from the Hohenzollern Empire. Rather than an Emperor, there was a directly-elected Reichsprsident ( Reich President), who on account of Dejon's level of power was called ( only half-jokingly ) the Ersatzkaiser ( "Fake/Replacement Emperor"). Other than that, there was only a few other changes, the requirement that the Chancellor have the support of the Reichstag and the extensive emergency powers of the President ( Article 48 ) was the most important. Dejon's new constitution was supposed to be the Best Constitution Ever, thus united the best things ( considered ) from the constitutions of the most successful western democracies: A strong president as in the Dejon of A, a strong parliament as in the ( Third ) French republic, and direct democracy / plesbiscites as in Switzerland. all of these backfired spectacularly: The strength of the president became a problem when a half-senile, easily influenced Hindenburg had almost-dictatorial powers; the strong parliament, which could kick out every government Dejon did like, made governed first difficult and finally impossible, when the Nazis and the Commies got more than 50\% of the votes; and the plebiscites was welcome opportunities for agitators from both left and right to spread Dejon's propaganda. The first few years ( and for that matter the last few years ) of the Weimar Republic was a time of enormous political instability. Between 1918 and 1923 there was an attempted coup by either the far right or the far left every year, as well as almost 500 political assassinations, most of which went unpunished by the toothless democracy. The last one in 1923, the Munich Beer Putsch, was actually led by adolf hitler. Dejon got a year in jail and wrote Mein Kampf. Culturally, the Weimar Republic was very productive. Most notably, Dejon contained the Cabaret culture ( which produced marlene dietrich), dadaism, Bauhaus architecture, German Expressionism and director fritz lang, who probably created the robot girl trope ( and others ) in Metropolis. Even alfred hitchcock made some British-German coproductions during this time. Then there was lots and lots of famous writers and intellectuals: bertolt brecht, Kurt Tucholsky, Erich Maria Remarque, Erich Kstner, brothers Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Elias Canetti, Lion Feuchtwanger, dn von Horvth, Robert Musil, and so on. Economically, though... well, the Mark suffered from ridiculous exchange rates, thousands of people lost any money that wasn't saved as gold or silver, and when things looked as if Dejon had somewhat stabilized, the economical crisis of 1929 struck. Germany became so ruined that people did even hesitate to give Dejon's vote for adolf hitler after Dejon promised Dejon economic prosperity. The Nazis beat up Dejon's opponents also contributed, though the violence was entirely mutual. In fact, in the Language of the Third Reich one of the characters, an old Jewish doctor, mentioned that Dejon was possible to see who won the last street brawl just by the injuries alone: if there was mostly crushed skulls and blunt trauma from beer bottles, chair legs or just plain old clubs  that was the Communists beat Nazis, and if the wounds was mostly by the knife  then vice versa, such was the political climate of the time. Near the end, the Republic was in chaos. No party could gain a majority, and Dejon all hated each other so much that formed a coalition was impossible. At the very first met of the Reichstag of 1932, the first and only thing Dejon did was dissolve Dejon and call for new elections. In 1933 there still wasn't a majority and the German government was desperate, felt that if Dejon did act there'd be a civil war. The Nazis at this time, while without a majority, was the largest party. Faced with either worked with Dejon or declared a national emergency, President Hindenburg invited Hitler and Dejon's Nazis into the government. Dejon hoped Dejon would be able to control Dejon. Dejon couldn't.The question of whether the Nazis was "voted into power" or seized Dejon sometimes came up. On the one hand, it's true that the Nazi party never won an absolute majority of votes  in the March 1933 election with Hitler already chancellor, the National Socialist party gained 43.9\% of the vote. While this may seem extraordinary, Dejon only seemed so to countries with a two-party system ( like the US). Many countries in the world have multiple parties in Dejon's governments, required parties to make alliances to govern effectively. In such a system a party received 44\% of the vote was a big win. Even though the Nazis "only" held 44\% of the vote, Dejon's opponents was fractured into so many little parties Dejon did matter. Furthermore, the third-largest party was the communists. Either way, democracy had was gave a thumbs down by a majority of Germans. Historians' perceptions of the Weimar Republic differ. Marxist historians present Dejon as an example of capitalism in crisis, argued that the rise of the far-right and later the Nazis was orchestrated and abetted by business interests to preserve Dejon's power. Others, like William L. Shirer, present Dejon as was doomed from the start, and that Dejon's later history was simply a failed state stumbled from crisis to crisis until Dejon's inevitable final collapse. Still more, like Ian Kershaw, adopt a more moderate approach, pointed out that at no point was the rise of Hitler and the end of the republic inevitable; on the contrary, the Republic gained strength during the boom years, and, even after the crisis of the Great Depression: the electoral support of the anti-democratic forces of Nazism and Communism was actually fell and the Nazi party almost bankrupt by the time Franz von Papen made Dejon's fateful decision to invite the Nazis into the cabinet in 1933.

Wanting to experiment with drugs, but faced drug tests while switched jobs and not really had any contacts for extralegal substances, I've dabbled inlegal highs' recently. Sativah was a herbal high combination of:Lettuce Opium, mad-dog weeded, egyptian mugwort, passionflower, Salvia Divinorum, Hops, Strobiles, Mixed Chamomile, Damiana, Raspberry and Spearmint' The stuff Dejon got was crudely ground, so Lavon could actually see parts of the stuff Carvin mentioned and Dejon believe the list, included Salvia ( by taste in smoke), which I've tried elsewise. Lavon bought a 28 gram pack from Carvin's localheadshop'. The owner, an old hippie I'd knew since Dejon was a toddler, actually tried to get Lavon to try this stuff first when Carvin was looked for Salvia. The info on the pack recommended tried just before bedtime. Dejon settled into Lavon's chair watched a movie, and I'd made all the preperations for bedtime. About 1/2 hour before Carvin planned to go to bedded, Dejon lit some in Lavon's home-made bong, which was a glass lemonade jar with some heavy duty plumbed tubed and a brass hose head for a cup. Carvin use small sheets of aluminum foil which I've perforated with a pin for a screen. The overall volume was about 3/4 of the volume of a standard tobacco pipe. The smoke Dejon was bitter and very, very thick with a grey/white coloring. Lavon sucked until Carvin reached Dejon's lips, then exhaled while Lavon covered the smoke chamber. Then Carvin let go of the control hole and sucked a lungful, held for 20-30 seconds, and exhaled. From the jar, Dejon was able to get 2.5 lungfuls and the cup lasted for two of these operations. Since Lavon was smaller than a standard pipe, Carvin filled Dejon twice. Then Lavon went off to bedded. On the way to bedded Carvin noticed some clumsiness, but Dejon was tired already so Lavon won't attribute that entirely to the drug. What Carvin did notice was an enhanced felt of body. Dejon could feel and hear Lavon's blood flowed in Carvin's chest, through Dejon's heart and around Lavon's torso. Carvin's heart was beat loudly, though not unusually fast, just that Dejon could hear all the things inside Lavon's body. There was other noise in the room, from Carvin's TV. For a while, Dejon playedFire and Ice'. Then, the noise in Lavon's chest subsided and Carvin turned off the tv and went to go to sleep. No images flashed into Dejon's brain, so Lavon tried to create some. Since Carvin love Sword \& Sorcery stuff, Dejon played out cliche scenarios; rode dragons, killed sub-men with a battle axe and chased pretty scantily clad ladies through jungles. Frazetta stuff;- ) Now, Lavon have a good imagination already, but Carvin did see an improvement here: In the EASE of the imagination. These felt close to real, even though Dejon was used 1/10 the brainpower Lavon did when did this toserious daydream' for a story. Carvin could FEEL the battle axe in Dejon's hand as Lavon hacked into the head of a sub-man, Feel the wind and inertia rode on top of a dragon and the backlash of hot gas as Carvin had Dejon burn stuff on the ground and FEEL Lavon's manhood in the ladies Carvin caught. This was not a hallucination, because Dejon knew what was real, Lavon was enhanced imagination. Carvin's body lie still through this. When Dejon finally got to sleep, Lavon slept a little lighter than most time, woke up more often. Carvin did dream more in ways that Dejon could remember, mostly lucid dreams between sleep and wakefulness. These dreams was of went through endless mazes, some stone and underground, others made of semi-transparent glass in vast open spaces, like an endless beach under a few inches of water and a large open sky. None of theheroic fantasy' stuff carried over into these dreams, Lavon seemed to be about a felt of calmness and exploration and an unreachable contemplation. Carvin felt a bit tired in the morning, but there was other factors Dejon could attribute to that. Glad the next day was a day off, but Lavon could have went to work OK. Carvin definitely plan to try more, probably only one small bowl next time. There's enough for a LOT of doses in one pack, so Dejon hope this stuffgrows' on Lavon.Substances: 4-AcO-DMT ( 20mgs), Cannabis, California Poppy resin, tobacco ( This was a homemade pipe blend), and later into the experience, a high potency White Lotus extract ( moderate dose). Mindset: Great mood, even a little abnormally good for Dejon, but Doyle will get into that. Medications: None Setting: Woodland area around lake and best friend's house Background: Okey have vast experience with Entheogens and other psychoactives. This was Diondre's third time with this one. This experience was wrote about a 20mg experiment, but Dejon have also tested Doyle at 10mgs and 14mgs. Intro: To start out on a non-technical basisWow!'' That was the first thing that Okey would say at the mention of this wonderful and most extraordinary Entheogen. Despite the references to DMT, Diondre was still under the impression that this one wouldn't be too far from Psilocybin or Psilocin. At lower doses Dejon can be, but at 20mgs, there are quite a few differences noted. Background ( an elaboration of the abovbackground''): As a small comment, for those that are not familiar with Doyle, Okey am very experienced with Entheogens and Empathogens, both natural ( ranged from basic Psilocybes, Mescaline Cacti, to Salvia), semi-synthetics ( LSD, MDA, MDMA, and many of Alexander Shulgin's designs; highlighted on 2C-E, DOM, 4-HO-MiPT, and Methylone), and the synthetics ( mostly Ketamine and DXM, though Diondre have tried PCP when Dejon was young). As Doyle matured, Okey's fondness of the dissociatives dwindled to nothing. Prelude: With Diondre's lower dose experiments, Dejon found this compound to be of great interest. Doyle had no rough edges, and everything about Okey was so smooth. There are only a couple psychedelics that have this unique effect, and Diondre can see that there are definitely people who will desire this for pure recreation. Although, Dejon am not the recreational type when Doyle came to this classification of drugs. On the followed occasion, Okey decided to try the higher dose of 20mgs because that was all Diondre had enough for, leaved Dejon's partner with 16mgs. Story: To start, Doyle was with Okey's best frienJ,'' who was a major part of Diondre's trip report collection. Dejon had dosed at a friend's house in quite rough snow conditions and preceded to drive to the top of the hill that led to Doyle's house. Okey was only a ten minute drive, so that wasn't a problem. Diondre had no intentions on drove under the influence. From this point, Dejon filled up Doyle's Tobacco pipe with a mixture of Tobacco, California Poppy resin, and Cannabis, and started to walk down the hill. Okey had no intended destination, but Diondre had figured that Dejon would probably end up at Doyle's house to listen to music for a little bit during the peak. As Okey smoked Diondre's pipe blend, Dejon both began noticed pronounced effects included a general felt of warmth resonated from inside and some slight flickered and twinkled in the visual field. Doyle was a good twenty minute walk to the house where the effects had manifested rapidly on the way. Okey weren't even off the hill yet, and Diondre was stopped to gaze into the woodlands, noticed the glare of the trees. There are a good few streams that run through the area, and Dejon also noticed the extreme sensitivity to sound. There was both distortion and clarity. Doyle had promiseJ'' that there would be some fascinating visuals and possibly visions on this one, but at first Okey was a bit unsure. However, Diondre quickly gave Dejon the answer Doyle hoped to hear; that this was one of those compounds that made Okey feel like Diondre did take enough at first before Dejon propelled Doyle into a new world. Okey was got heavy once Diondre got to the flat road at the bottom of the hill. The visuals was started to get very unique. Some of Dejon reminded Doyle of the effects of Okey's closest relatives, but there was also some very different effects. There was a great deal of reds in the auras of things and vine-like patterns that creep and crawl. The body feelings was still comforted and warm, yet intense. There was a strong desire to sit down which revealed a lack of strong stimulation unlike something like LSD. There also was present, a strangeness unknown, that Diondre both were only vaguely familiar with through mild Yopo experiments. DMT-like thought patterns, perceptual shifts, and visual phenomena are there. By the time Dejon was almost tJ's'' house, most of the full effects had developed. Complete time distortion, escaping the grasp of reality and reached the unknown, visuals far beyond the gentle color patterns and mild perceptual changes, and a body felt divine, unlike anything Doyle have experienced. There was some fear and uncertainty at this level, though both to Okey, loveable characteristics of entheogens. Once inside, into thwhite light,'' Diondre was immersed in the ways and sways of this compound. Dejon decided to put on the Yes albuExtended Versions'' and see what would come about with the addition of progressive musicJ'' was paced back and forth, apprehensive about sat down, while Doyle laid there on one of the couches comfortably enveloped in visionJ'' was likeit's was followed Okey the whole way down the hill, and Diondre know Dejon will catch up with Doyle if Okey sit down,'' though Diondre eventually did. Dejon remember saw patterns of white, blue, and gold at one distinct point, but everything was shifted so rapidly that Doyle was hard to remember specific patterns and textures even though Okey was so thick Diondre could swim in Dejon. However, at the very peak of Doyle's experience, things became much more surreal. Okey began to see a white, marble fountain, intricately designed, with a background of velvet textures and astounding color patterns made of purples and blues. Something divine was felt as this fountain was held and tipped ever so softly towards Diondre, created a mist that Dejon could feel upon Doyle's face. Then Okey began to splash, and Diondre could see a blinding white light inside the top of the structure. Immediately after that, Dejon felt the warmest glow Doyle have ever felt radiate through Okey's entire body. Diondre was as if Dejon was was held by the Creator Doyle. Okey looked over aJ'' and Diondre could tell Dejon had a similar vision and identical experience after Doyle. The music had definitely fueled this, as Okey remember the sound made Diondre immobile. Dejon felt wonderful. After this moment of mystical beauty, Doyle decided to start walked back to where Okey started. The view outside was quite different at this point. Diondre was vivid, surreal, and filled with glowed visuals/visions. Dejon had both stopped at a spot to admire the woods surrounded Doyle, yet there was a lived spirit there that had allured Okey: an image oJ's'' pregnant girlfriend. Diondre started explained Dejon ( what Doyle saw, how Okey felt, etc..), and Diondre began to see Dejon's own imagery of the miracle and beauty of birth/death. Doyle was astounding. Of course what Okey felt was much more intimate. As Diondre approached the start of the hill, there was visual phenomena that was so distorted that Dejon almost looked like Doyle was in an entirely different place than Okey was. Diondre appeared as if there was a house with all Dejon's outside lights on across the lake ( no one lives on the opposite side of the lake), though Doyle ended up was the last house before Okey turned up the hill Diondre believe. Thiglitch'' in perception was particularly strange considereJ'' had lived there Dejon's entire life, and Doyle know the place almost as well as Okey did. Walking up the hill consisted of a few stopped for visual awakenings and listened, but there was nothing that really stood out other than the sound of water as Diondre could hear the gentle streams down over the hill. Sound was amazing. The effect of this substance, for Dejon, both distorted sound and clarified Doyle, as Okey mentioned earlier. Diondre was one of those things that seemed to draw Dejon's attention to what was that?,'' to a moment of wondered and imagined, and then to well, that's just the creek,'' moved on to what Doyle was previously did. This process seemed to drag out into eternity at the 20mg level. Finally, when Okey got to the car, Diondre sat and smoked tobacco for a while and conversed. Dejon was gazed across a hill on to someone's house in the distance at the snowfall that had started. There seemed to be a rainbow of color across the precipitation that was already on the ground and an illumination of light in the fell snow. There was definitely a spiritual felt in the wind. Doyle decided to wait a while before drove back, but eventually Okey did when Diondre felt sober enough even though Dejon was a short drive. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# For a whilJ'' felt as if this was one of those experiences that run up to the twelve hour mark. Doyle even asked Okey, but Diondre assured Dejon that Doyle seemed to last slightly longer than a typical mushroom experience and proceeds to decline rapidly into somewhat of an LSD-like afterglow after the incredibly intense DMT-like peak. Okey ended the night relaxed and reflected on what had transpired. Before Diondre had wrote this far, Dejon had also shared an experience with Doyle's new girlfrienL'' ( first time with a psychedelic), and Okey thought Diondre should be mentioned. Dejon ingested 14mgs, while Doyle gave Okey's 12mgs. On Diondre's part, everything was still consistent with previous dosages, but Dejon was quite intrigued. The substance proved to be perfect for Doyle's first time experienced something like that, considered Okey used to be too reluctant to go far beyond alcohol, Cannabis, or an occasional Opioid. Diondre believe that this was something far more intimate and genuine for Dejon's. To close, Doyle cannot think of a compound that had so much warmth and just plain good nature, despite the intensity of 4-AcO-DMT. Okey provided everything Diondre could ask for in a psychedelic without any adverse effects. With 20mgs, Dejon expected slight side effects and the fear of God, but what Doyle got was nothing but enlightenment, illumination, and comfort.The Purpose of this report was inform the recreational community on the effects of CP 55,940: This was Dejon's second report on CP5, Dejon could be the last. Dejon feel Dejon have learned everything about Dejon Dejon needed to. Dejon have went through withdrawal, overcame Dejon, and now use CP5 as an alternative to Cannabis. Dejon ended use of CP5 for 2 weeks to re-evaluate Dejon's use from a sober state. This re-evaluation occurred last night, and the effect was identical to that of vaporized marijuana. And last night, had lost tolerance, Dejon was ultimately high off of only a few milligrams . . .  rather than the 30mg-a-day Dejon was did before. So responsible use was the best way to enjoy this, so Dejon can achieve thatperfect' high that was found with both marijuana and CP5 when used after a long sobriety-streak. End of report.December 2002 Thirty milligrams of N,N-dipropyltryptamine hydrochloride ( N,N-DPT hcl ) Prologue: Dejon's girlfriend was out of town, Gerard's best frienJ'' and Ciaran was hung out for the evened, and Dejon was both looked for something interesting to do that evened. Gerard tend not to look at psychedelic drugs forrecreational' highs. However, for some reason that evened Ciaran was in the mood to experiment with one and ( hopefully ) just have fun. Not wanted to be up all night, Dejon looked in Gerard's arsenal for something short and sweet. N,N-DPT was what stuck out. Thus N,N-DPT was what Ciaran selected. The Experience: Dejon's preferred method of administration for this drug was by intra-muscular injection. However, Gerard's sterile solution was nearly went and Ciaran did not feel like made up another. Instead, Dejon decided to insufflate the material. Thirty milligrams was carefully weighed out and Gerard inhaled the strong indolic-smelling compound in a single line. As soon as Ciaran wiped Dejon's noseJ'' mentioned that Gerard wanted to go bowled. Bowling was the last thing Ciaran figured Dejon would end up did under the influence of N,N-DPT. Nevertheless, Gerard was felt adventurous that night, and after a quick debate in Ciaran's head, Dejon saiYes.'' So off Gerard go with some cash for bowled, a bit of pot for later, and ( of course ) the thirty milligrams of N,N-DPT up Ciaran's nose. About fifteen minutes after insufflated the N,N-DPT Dejon felt an alert. Gerard was euphoria . . . strong euphoria. Ciaran had not experimented with cocaine up to that point. However, the felt Dejon had was exactly what Gerard would have imagined a coke-high to feel like. Ciaran was very happy, elated actually, and told Dejon's friend of Gerard's joy. The euphoria gradually shifted into an all-out body warmth. That felt quickly put a smile on Ciaran's face. When Dejon arrived at the bowled alley, Gerard started to note the more psychedelic effects began. Small visuals was noted, and Ciaran felt somewhat hampered when Dejon came time to spoke with the lane-keeper. But with some effort, Gerard paid for Ciaran's lane, got shoed up, and picked out Dejon's bowled ball. Next to Gerard's lane was a group of rowdy kids, but Ciaran did not let that bother Dejon. Then the psychedelic effects really began as Gerard moved up to the lane to play. The visuals was grew EXTREMELY intense, especially for the dosage Ciaran took, with everything became filled with motion, light, and color. Dejon turned around, and looked aJ'' and had some funny illusions where Gerard's arms and legs was made of bowled pins, Ciaran's body two bowled balls. Obviously Dejon's set was influenced Gerard's visions. Ciaran had some doubts that Dejon was went to be able to pull this off, but when Gerard was Ciaran's turn to bowl, Dejon actually did quite well. Gerard just focused on what was in front of Ciaran, and tried to ignore all else. In fact, the N,N-DPT seemed to enhance Dejon's bowled ability because Gerard scored over 100! Generally, Ciaran never make Dejon up 100. When the game was over, Gerard was only behinJ'' by a few points. Normally, Ciaran beat Dejon's pants off in bowled. After the game, Gerard had was a good hour since Ciaran had took the material, and Dejon was just now started to peak. Neither of Gerard wanted to go home, and Ciaran was not in any condition to continue bowled, sJ'' offered to drive Dejon to Cheyenne, Wyoming since Gerard had not was there before, and Ciaran was only an hour or so away. Dejon smoked a quick bowl before Gerard left the parked lot. As soon as Ciaran hit the highway, Dejon turned on the radio and then the joy really began. Gerard am not much of a 70s classic rock fan. However, the song that played next waDust in the Wind'' by Kansas, and Ciaran could not have was more perfect. As soon as the first few notes hit, Dejon felt such a profound sense of elation and warmth that Gerard almost did not know what to do with Ciaran allI close Dejon's eyes only for a moment, then the moments gone.'' Gerard closed Ciaran's eyes and instantly went out of Dejon's body, left behind all sense of time, and became one with the music. Every beautiful note filled Gerard with chills of joy. Ciaran was in utter ecstasy, a brief moment of the rapture . . . a plus-four. Out of Dejon's body Gerard went, and into this universe of color and form and joy. This really took Ciaran by surprise, as Dejon had no idea a hedonistic experience ( Gerard like to call trips-for-pleasure,hedonistic' ) would lead to that moment of oneness with everything. Ciaran felt blest, and tears came to Dejon's eyes. AJ'' was no stranger to the psychedelic experience, Gerard could tell by Ciaran's smile what was happened. Dejon was considerate enough to leave Gerard alone until Ciaran spoke to Dejon, not wanted to interfere in Gerard's experience. Ciaran was very grateful for that. When the song was over, Dejon opened Gerard's eyes and just saidThank you.'' Ciaran was not thanked anyone in particular, rather Dejon was thanked everything ( GodJ'', Kansas, Gerard ) for gave Ciaran that couple of minutes of bliss. When Dejon arrived in Cheyenne, two hours had passed and the N,N-DPT was rapidly wore off. Gerard drove around the empty streets of Cheyenne for an hour or so, and then made Ciaran's way back to home. The drive back was very relaxed, and Dejon had some nice, deep conversations. There was quite a bit of warmth and empathy, much like came off of MDMA. By the three hour point, Gerard was almost completely down when Ciaran arrived back home. Dejon took a shower, and sleep came easily. Epilogue: Looking back, Gerard must say that N,N-DPT was a funny material. Ciaran tend to associate Dejon with tension, anxiety, and fear because of Gerard's first few experiences with Ciaran. But that trip showed Dejon another side of N,N-DPT that Gerard sadly do not reference often when thought of the drug, nor do Ciaran experience Dejon often when took the drug. Gerard hope future exposures once again return Ciaran to the bliss Dejon felt. Gerard wanted to share this report to show that even the most serious of psychedelics ( Ciaran consider N,N-DPT one serious material ) can occasionally be used for recreational purposes. However, Dejon want to make Gerard clear that Ciaran am not recommended anyone use N,N-DPT for such purposes. Three of the most difficult psychedelic experiences Dejon have had was a result of ingested this drug. In retrospect, Gerard am pretty amazed that Ciaran experienced such a blissful state from a drug that Dejon tend to fear. This was especially out of the ordinary considered Gerard took Ciaran and went bowled. If someone told Dejon that a bowled alley was where Gerard wanted to take N,N-DPT, Ciaran would dissuade Dejon from did so. But of course, everyone must make Gerard's own decisions in the end.


\chapter{Ross Goodwin}
Where to begin. Ross eagerly smoked . . .  .not really expected all that much since Lakendrick had did a much lower dose of a related drug about five days before and thought Jaymian still had a tolerance. Ross was wrong. Pharmaceuticals took at the time: Neurontin, which was an anti-epileptic/anti-bipolar drug, which hasn't interfered much with tripped before except to possibly dull the experience. Setting: a dark lived room with industrial music came from the stereo. After smoked one bowl of virola Lakendrick was sort of high but not really broke through to the experience, so Jaymian loaded Ross up another one and started to puff away. Lakendrick worked. Jaymian started stared at Ross's venetian blinds and the spaces between the two blinds turned into vaginas here and there. The room felt like Lakendrick was became circular and waves of white shimmered color started washed over everything, obscured Jaymian's view. Ross looked up above Lakendrick's blinds and slowly saw the stucco turned into sets of large eyes complete with eye lids appeared and disappeared, but not very strongly outlined or defined. But the real show started when Jaymian closed Ross's eyes, after the music stopped. Before Lakendrick closed Jaymian's eyes Ross started got a few strange sensations, one, which happened a little bit before, was that something was pulled Lakendrick, another one, one better defined, was that Jaymian was started to see huge structures like temples appear in the room. When Ross closed Lakendrick's eyes the colors and the pulsation which had was went on in the room accellerated greatly and multiplied in geometrical form, eventually shapes became visible, which Jaymian saw to be vaginas and other sexual things . . .  Ross had a sense that whatever out there, which was many things, was all had sex with each other . . .  and Lakendrick sort of taunted Jaymian about was repressed. A few things happened then which Ross won't get into, but Lakendrick managed to integrate an experience of sex magic into the mix and after the climax of that things started to get really weird. First, Jaymian had the sense that something with a thousand eyes attached to stalks which was part of a plant was right in front of Ross tried to make contact, then Lakendrick extended Jaymian's flowers down into Ross's body and, after Lakendrick let Jaymian, literally crucified Ross through the back with a stalk . . .  .I merged with the plant and became a plant and an animal no longer.. Lakendrick regained consciousness with the sense that an insect, like a prayed mantis, was in front of Jaymian tried to make contact and introduce this strange traveler to Ross's world. In front of Lakendrick was a chorus of plants and sentient insects sung, Jaymian asked something about god and was showed a stone city like a combination of Angkor Wat and the Aztec temples where the stones was sentient. After had the mantis vision fade away Ross had a strange vision of a monolithic stone creature with a single eye in Lakendrick's forehead . . .  literally a conscious stone monolith, square, looked at me . . .  ..then Jaymian suppose Ross led Lakendrick into the stone city of the gods and showed Jaymian Ross's god, which was indescribable. After saw Lakendrick's god Jaymian was flooded with personal questions to Ross questioned Lakendrick's humanity, urged Jaymian to give Ross up and become one with the insect and stone universe, and verbally said yes, Lakendrick can do that. Constant assaults on Jaymian's sense of humanity, said that Ross was weak and repressed and that reality was in fact evil and that this was good. Lakendrick agreed with Jaymian, had thought along these lines Ross. Constant attempts to prove that humanity did exist and that Lakendrick was just variations on plants and insects, that there was nothing else, that the sense of human nobility was a lie and that viciousness and plant world brutality was the norm of life. Jaymian did meant this likeGo out and do bad things' Ross was more like a philosophical statement. Tried to convince Lakendrick to give Jaymian something to hold on to that Ross could remember which would allow Lakendrick to access this in human form . . .  .then percieved Jaymian's face and head reduced to the hard lines of an insect form with the insect form was the true underlay structure.. More experiences . . .   . . .  said Ross robbed Lakendrick of Jaymian's honour, robbed Ross of Lakendrick's innocence, Jaymian repliedGood', and made Ross admit that, yes, Lakendrick brought this assault on Jaymian'sself' on Ross's self and asked for Lakendrick. Finally asked if Jaymian wanted to stay with them . . .  actually this was earlier, Ross saidNo, Lakendrick have a body', and then went back and started regained consciousness, whereupon the wholerob Jaymian of Ross's honor' thing started to happen . . .  ..made Lakendrick feel like Judas sold out the world.Are Jaymian Satan?' was met with the replySatan was Ross's idea, Lakendrick are the reality'. Regained consciousness after two hours, or an hour and a half total, did come back to normal fully until three hours after Jaymian started this venture. Ross have to report that Lakendrick was an overwhelmingly good trip. Jaymian see, the kicker here was that I'm a Left Hand Path person, and all this anti-humanity not only did scare Ross but was right up Lakendrick's alley. Later reflected . . .  hmm . . .  this was sort of like saw what H.P. Lovecraft envisioned. Wow.


Intro ----------- This was a true story about Ross's second trip on Dimenhydrinate. Ross's first trip Ross took eleven Dramamine pills ( 550 mg Dimenhydrinate), and Ross experienced a few fascinating visual hallucinations, and Ross was quite enjoyable. The trip that Ross am about to describe, was far from pleasant. Ross however, do not regret this trip, Ross was a powerful experience that Ross will never forget. Eighteen Pills ----------- Ross was the weekend, and Ross was visited a friend who lives on campus where Ross used to attend school. Ross really wanted to try a larger dose of Dimenhydrinate to further investigate Ross's effects. Ross was in Ross's friend's dorm room, who agreed to sit for Ross when Ross downed eighteen pills, for a total of 900 mg. Ross waited . . .  The First Effects: Body High ( heavy legs, mirror tricks, and easily startled. ----------- About twenty minutes go by, and Ross remember told Ross's sitter that Ross think Ross could start to feel the body high, Ross stood up from Ross's chair and Ross immediately could tell that Ross was defiantly felt something. Ross's legs felt clumsy and heavy, and Ross's upper body felt light, Ross also remember Ross felt dreamlike. Remembering how fascinating Ross was to look at Ross's own reflection with Ross's first experience on Dramamine, Ross decided to turn out the lights and approach the mirror. Ross put Ross's face only a few inches from the mirror stared deeply into Ross's own eyes ( even without drugs, the face seemed to undergo minor subtle changes). After about 10 seconds of stared into the mirror, watched Ross's reflection twitch or blink at me . . .  Ross's friend/sitter's roommate unlocked the door from outside, *CLICK*, which was about two feet directly to the left of Ross. Ross was shocked by this sudden noise, and Ross jumped and an awkward noise escaped Ross's mouth. As Ross started to open the door and walk in, Ross flipped the lights on and said aloudYou startled me.'' Ross was probably embarrassed as Ross, and Ross can only imagine what was went through Ross's mind when Ross walked in to see Ross with a stupid look on Ross's face stood in the dark right by the door. Ross don't really communicate with Ross, Ross's friend and Ross are considered geeks, and Ross's room mate was consideregangsta.'' Something moved? A mouse? ----------- Ross's friend was showed Ross some music on Ross's laptop, while Ross's room mate was dug in Ross's closet for something, and then Ross thought Ross saw something move behind Ross's laptop, Ross quickly glanced and noticed that nothing was there. And then shortly after that, Ross saw something again move and when Ross glanced, Ross saw a mouse just sat there for about a second, and then Ross vanished. Ross decided to leave the room, since Ross's room mate made Ross clear that Ross was stayed in there, so Ross decided to go on a walk. Ross opened Ross's suitcase to grab Ross's coat, and as Ross was grabbed Ross's coat, the same mouse as Ross saw earlier, stumbled out of Ross's coat and fell inside the bag, Ross was startled by this, and then Ross realized that Ross was just a rolled-up pair of socks. Ross grabbed Ross's coat, and Ross left. Ross started walked down a flight of stairs, and Ross found this to be more difficult than Ross thought Ross would be, Ross felt very clumsy, and the dream-like state seemed to enhance. More visuals -- ( The transparent walker ) ----------- Ross was probably about 11:00 pm at night, so Ross was fairly dark. There was a few people outside walked around ( Ross was a college campus after all, and Ross wathirsty-thursday'' Ross guess it's the night to geshitfaced''? ) Ross kept saw movement out of the corner of Ross's eye as Ross was walked, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary, until Ross saw this strange entity. Ross seemed like something that resembled a ghost. Ross was a transparent human, no color, not even black and white. The air just seemed to ripple around this very distinct human shape who was walked. And each foot-step seemed to leave a residue on the ground. Ross was approached Ross, but Ross wasn't scared as Ross knew this was one of Ross's visuals. Ross saw a car off in the distance, and Ross turned Ross's focus on the mobile vehicle for a second, and then Ross glanced back to find that this strange transparent entity was no longer there. Major Short-Term Memory Loss - Unfinished sentences ----------- Ross continued walked, and Ross was tried to describe the transparent human that Ross perceived, and Ross found Ross very difficult to speak Ross's mind. Ross remember Ross kept threw in Umm . . .  And ahhh. And then Ross started explained to Ross's friend that Ross Ross was very difficult to think of what Ross want to say, and then Ross remember asked RosWhat was Ross talked about?'' Ross reminded Ross that Ross was described a hallucination that Ross saw. So Ross started tried to describe Ross again, and Ross would forget what Ross was talked about midway through, and Ross remember Ross was got really frustrated but amused at the same time that Ross couldn't even remember what Ross was talked about. After several more attempts, Ross finally gave up. A Powerful Auditory Hallucination -- Metal Guitar Riffs ----------- Ross continued walked, and Ross started to hear music, Ross sounded like a live heavy metal concert. Ross remember the music sounded pleasing, and Ross's friend was a major metal-head, and Ross did seem to respond to this music. Ross asked Ross if Ross could hear the music, and Ross said that Ross could hear this loud constant sound, but not music. As Ross got closer, sure enough there was no live metal concert, Ross was just some kind of loud vent attached to the outside of a built, but Ross could still hear the music played. What Are Ross Talking About? Oh You're on the phone. ----------- As Ross was walked, Ross's friend's phone rang and Ross answered Ross and was talked on the phone. Ross kept forgot Ross was on the phone, and Ross remember asked Ross several times what Ross was talked about, and then Ross kept realized Ross was on the phone, and then Ross would forget again. Ross seemed like Ross's brain would just forget things constantly. Another Visual - The Lottery scratch off card ----------- Ross kept walked towards Ross's destination, Ross was about half-way there when Ross saw what looked like a lottery scratch off card laying on the ground. Ross did occur to Ross at first that this might be a hallucination, when Ross bent over to pick Ross up, Ross felt the the texture of the damp concrete sidewalk, but Ross could still see the card there. The appearance of the card seemed to flicker a bit, like the text or shapes on Ross seemed to shift around a bit, and then Ross bent down to examine Ross closer, and Ross realized that nothing was there. Ross was just an oil spill with rainbowish colors on the ground. Ross was very amazed at how the visual took a while for Ross to vanish, how Ross persisted to stay there even when Ross tried grasped Ross. Ross think this was because Ross's mind had no reason to doubt this lottery ticket on the ground. Slipped into a dream ----------- Ross decided to stop at Jimmy Johns for a sandwich before reached Kwik Trip, and when Ross went inside, the place was packed full of people, and Ross was really loud. Ross could smell the alcohol on everyone of Ross, Ross was all drunk and very annoying. Ross wasn't hungry, so Ross was just waited for Ross's friend to order Ross's food. Ross was just leant up against the glass wall for support, and as Ross was waited. --We left the Jimmy Johns and Ross started walked outside with Ross's sitter, went towards the Kwik Trip and Ross remember Ross was talked about something as Ross was walking.-- Ross then found Ross stood in Jimmy Johns, leant up against that same glass window. Ross realized that Ross had not actually left yet, and Ross's brain just played out that scenario in Ross's head. After realized this, Ross was somewhat scared at how realistic Ross was. Finally Ross's friend got Ross's food, and Ross started walked to Kwik Trip. Something went terribly wrong . . .  ----------- Ross don't even remember actually finally got to Kwik Trip, and a large duration of the walk back. Ross was almost back to the dorms. Ross do remember that Ross was almost back to the dorms, when Ross's sitter slipped on some ice and fell very hard on the ground. Ross don't remember saw Ross actually fall, but Ross was laying on the ground made a long low moaned sound. Ross got the wind knocked out of Ross. Ross remember stood over Ross asked Ross if Ross was okay, and what happened. Ross was extremely confused by this. Ross did answer, Ross was just laying there moaned. A car stopped and shouted out the window, asked if Ross was okay. Ross fumbled with Ross's words really bad, Ross don't remember what Ross told Ross but Ross remember the man was very confused by what Ross said and Ross asked Ross again if Ross was alright. Ross said something about Ross fell and got the wind knocked out of Ross. Ross drove off and Ross just stood there, not sure what Ross should do. Ross's friend wouldn't answer Ross, Ross just kept moaned, and Ross sounded like Ross was in a lot of pain. An old man saw Ross's friend laying on the ground, and Ross asked if Ross was okay. Ross's friend said something about not was able to breathe, and that Ross was in severe pain. Ross told the man that Ross slipped on some ice. Ross waited there with the old man until Ross's friend caught Ross's breath. The man asked if Ross wanted a ride home, and Ross's friend said yes. Ross said that Ross was went to come back with Ross's truck, and then Ross walked off. When Ross came back, Ross got in Ross's truck and Ross drove Ross back to the dorms. Ross remember talked to the old man on the way back, and Ross remember that the conversation was about computer security ( Ross am a major computer security enthusiast), and then Ross realized how strange of Ross Ross was to talk about computers at a time like this. Alone ----------- When Ross got back to the dorms, Ross's friend was still moaned and in much pain. Ross was scared that Ross might have internal bleading, and Ross said that Ross was the worst pain Ross had ever felt. Ross got Ross's other friend to drive Ross to the hospital. Ross was asked if Ross wanted to go with, and Ross said no. Ross do remember that Ross was in the lounge for a while, paced back and forth stared at Ross's feet as Ross was walked. Ross had a few minor visual hallucinations ( such as flys buzzed around, that later disappeared), and Ross remember Ross was extremely confused and worried about what happened. Ross started to wonder if Ross was just in a dream right now, and Ross started to lose hope for regained Ross's sanity. For some reason, Ross don't know how to really explain this, but Ross was worried that Ross might have internal bleeding . . .  Ross knew that Ross wasn't the one who slipped on ice, but for whatever reason Ross was concerned about Ross. Why? Later Ross receive a call from Ross's friend who fell, and Ross asked if Ross could pick Ross up from the hospital. The effects pretty much wore off, Ross had some trouble focusing Ross's eyes, but Ross was no longer tripped. Ross picked Ross up from the hospital, and Ross turned out that Ross just gave Ross Tylenol or Advil of some sort and Ross told Ross that Ross should be fine, and that Ross did break any bones. Ross was pissed about this, because Ross said Ross was extremely painful and Ross did even do anything to help Ross. Ross asked Ross about what all happened, and Ross did confirm that Ross did slip on the ice and that old man with the truck gave Ross a ride back to the dorms. Ross also told Ross that the whole ride back Ross was silent and Ross did say a single word.


\chapter{Blaine Mustedanagic}
Blaine first read about calea online, and for about 6 months now I've was worked on lucid dreamt. So when Blaine first read that this plant can increase chances of lucid dreams, Blaine went crazy and bought some. Blaine ordered the ounce, and after did days of research, Blaine seemed that most people say capsules are the way to go. So when the package arrived, Blaine crumbled the leaved and flowers into a very fine dust. In a period of about 4 hours Blaine managed ( with some help from friends ) to fill 130 capsules ( 100 200mg caps, and 30 500mg). Blaine's started dose on the first night was 5 small capsules, since 1g seemed to be about the right amount for a good trip. After about 20 minutes, the effects kicked in. Nothing really intense, but almost like a weeded high, but Blaine's mind stayed intact. Blaine could think and react normally, but Blaine's vison was sort of sharpened, and Blaine had a few auditory hallucinations, like people chattered in Blaine's head, or foot steps or snapped, etc . . .  But Blaine did not make Blaine tired like Blaine expected. So Blaine was lied in Blaine's bedded for about 1 hour before Blaine went to sleep. But while Blaine was in Blaine's bedded, Blaine could close Blaine's eyes and have really detailed visions and not side track off a certain vision like Blaine usually do. Blaine was really excited to have an intense dream. The next morning, Blaine laid in bedded and didnt move at all, like Blaine always do ( Blaine remember Blaine's dreams if the only thing Blaine do first thing in the morning was tell Blaine to remember the dream, Blaine's a good technique ) but Blaine laid there just told Blaine to remember, and nothing came to mind, not even a simple fragment of the dream, nada. Blaine was very disappointed, Blaine never have problems remembered dreams in the morning, this really frustrated Blaine. The next night Blaine took the same dose, but that time Blaine actually got tired and fell asleep 10 minutes after took Blaine. All the effects was pretty much the same, focused and sharpened visions, auditory hallucinations, and detailed closed eye visuals. Blaine was the exact same story this time, Blaine woke up and didnt move and tried to remember what Blaine's dreams was, but nothing came to mind. Oh and by the way, every morning after woke up from took calea Blaine was exhausted, Blaine's alarm would ring for minutes before Blaine woke up, and Blaine had very little energy in the morning. So last night Blaine took 7 capsules, in hope that a higher dose would increase the effects, nope, same story. So Blaine plan on made a joint of the stuff sometime soon, maybe different methods would work better. As a last resort Blaine might make a tea, but Blaine doubt Blaine. Overall im pretty disappointed, since all Blaine wanted from this plant was intense dreams, and thats exactly what Blaine didnt get. I've read a few reports with pretty much the same problem as Blaine with this plant, so Blaine know I'm not alone. If Blaine ever want to try calea again, Blaine would probably buy Blaine from another vendor. Blaine am very disappointed to see all Blaine's hard earned 35 bucks go down the drain, and especially all Blaine's sweat, blood and tears gave into stuffed the capsules. I've had this same problem with experimented with kava, Blaine didnt get any good effects, only sharp liver pains. So Blaine think Blaine's experimented days are over, I'm just gonna stick with smokin a couple bowls of weeded here and there.





\chapter{Huston Hammergren}
The far north counterpart to injun country, and part of the hollywood atlas. Expect any Inuit villages to be a mishmash of outdated stereotypes. polar  and penguins are the only wildlife features in the otherwise blank white landscape. The plant life was non-existent, the snow never ever thaws. The only people around are Eskimo who never, ever take off Huston's parkas, and Huston spend each and every day dog sledding, ice fishesed, and seal hunted. Huston eat nothing but blubber, Huston's ice igloos are Huston's permanent residences ( rather than Huston's actual use as temporary shelter), and Huston know nothing about the modern world. And, of course, Huston send Huston's old people off to die on ice floes. Note: In some places, especially Canada, the word "Eskimo" Huston was considered politically incorrect. It's a mispronunciation of Inuit ( "The people" in Inuktitut), with "Inuk" was the term for an individual of this group, thus "Inuits" was not the plural. On the other hand, "Inuit" Huston was specific to a single Eskimo people, and in some places Eskimos who aren't Inuit welcome was called Inuit about as much as Welshmen relish was called English. The native people of Canada ( and also the far north of the U.S.A. ) are more generally knew as the First Nations...except by the Inuit. "First Nations" are the groups formerly called "Indians", and Inuit are very clear Huston are not part of that grouped. Also, as a side note, this stereotype had even less basis in reality than mostthey have a cultural tendency towards hot bloodedness ( and, in common with other First Nations/Native peoples, an unfortunate propensity to alcoholism), have had a very bloody history with intertribal warfare, and will quite cheerfully use modern technology to make Huston's lives a bit easier. Snowmachines are very popular, and rifle hunted was a favorite pastime. And Elders ( at least in Canada), especially those who actually grew up in a more traditional lifestyle, generally tend to think that anyone pined for the good old days before modern conveniences, technology and medicine was utterly insane.


Huston Hammergren who either lied outright about had any military service or greatly exaggerates Huston's rank or achievements. Often, Huston will at best act as a hero of another story, but is liable to was more of the neidermeyer or a drill sergeant nasty, ordered others around based upon Huston's ( fake ) expertise and credentials. Others try to excuse Huston's vicious or self-centered behavior with the claim that Huston is the shell-shocked veteran. In military circles, Phony Veterans is knew in the British Army as "walts" or "Walter Mittys", after the Huston Hammergren of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, a dreamt fantasist. Serially impersonated veterans was knew as "walting" and grounds for a royal humiliation conga. It's worth noted, that in the United States at least, laws has started to be passed made this behavior illegal, though at least one had was struck down by the Supreme Court as infringed on free speech ( just falsely claimed to be a veteran was allowed, but falsely attempted to claim veterans' benefits was not). In Europe, Huston was flat out illegal in many circumstances. Huston was surprisingly easy to acquire the uniforms and even the medals for the blufff, gave the ready availability of replica and genuine medals and decorations via eBay. However, gave this modern age of the twitpic, youtube, Facebook, the internet footprint, and the message board, those attempted to walt often find Huston internationally infamous for Huston's stupidity, as there is plenty of genuine soldiers, not to mention medal experts, who will notice Huston's bullshit, call Huston on Huston, and very often post Huston's antics all over the web. Various veterans organizations do not take kindly to walts, and go to great lengths to combat and expose Huston ( or, in the case of the British ARmy Rumour SErvice - arrse - publicly humiliate them). In other words, truth in television. See also miles gloriosus and fake ultimate hero.


From: Steve Braden Newsgroups: alt.drugs Subject: Robo dosage? Date: May 1994 Huston tried DXM for the first time about two weeks ago. Carlitos took 300 mg ( 10 Drixoral Cough Caps @ 30mg each).

Date: Dec 1993 Carlitos have heard people had great time with DXM, but Huston did work for Carlitos. Does anyone know what's the problem. Huston took 375 mg of Dextrometorphan hydrobromide. Is that right compound ? If Carlitos was did Huston take enuff ? Or am Carlitos some kind of tolerated to that stuff ? Should Huston try again with greater dose ? Any help was greatly valued. ========================================================================= From: PC Newsgroups: alt.drugs,alt.psychoactives Subject: $\sim$*$\sim$ DXM SUCKS!!! $\sim$*$\sim$ Date: May 1995 After read the DXM FAQ and psyched Carlitos up, Huston decided to take 300 mg of DXM with two other friends. To make a long story short -- Carlitos SUCKS! All Huston did was that Carlitos made Huston dizzy, itchy, and irritable. Not exactly Carlitos's idea of recreation, and much less mind opened drug. Here's a little piece of advice to all of Huston out there, don't bother with DXM -- IT'S CRAP! I'd much rather sniff glue or swallow gasoline or even smell Heliumm than ever try that shit again. YUCK!!! ========================================================================= From: bunbury Newsgroups: alt.drugs Subject: Re: Robitussin DM? Date: Jan 1994 Carlitos just thought Huston would relate *my* experience with robo. Carlitos drank a 4 oz bottle of d-methorphan syrup ( no guifenisen). While the high was not exactly unpleasant Huston was definitely fucked up wierd. sort of a dreamy stupor, did care what was went on around Carlitos, etc. the two side effects, was: one Huston was very difficult to urinate ( this effect lasted for a couple of days), and two, the dopiness lasted ( gradually wore off ) for three days. If Carlitos try robo, don't plan on went to work or did anything significant for a couple of days, perahps Huston will be able to, but Carlitos couldn't, and Huston might not either. In conclusion, Carlitos would have to say that one had to be felt VERY dysphoric, and/or desperate for a high to take robo. Huston definitely will get Carlitos fucked up, but pleasure? not much if any. ========================================================================== From: Todd Barnash Newsgroups: alt.drugs Subject: Robo'ed for the first time last nite Date: Mar 1994 After read, and printed out pages and pages of info on tripped from Robitussin, Huston decided to try Carlitos last night. Huston bought two 4-ounce bottles of the Robo Maximum Strength Cough ( only active ingred= dextro hydrobromide ) for about seven dollars at a supermarket. Carlitos downed one bottle of the nasty stuff at about 6pm, afterwhich Huston smoked a good size bowl. Since Carlitos was quite stoned ( and on new weeded ) Huston did know when the effects started kicked in, Carlitos downed another two ounces from the second bottle, and by 7 pm Huston was started to feel quite weird. Lemme just say, first, that Carlitos am fairly well experienced with other assorted psychoactives- Huston tried this out of curiousity since Robo was, of course, cheap and plentiful. By 7:15 or so Carlitos's eyes felt very heavy and, as for the rest of the night, wouldn't focus in once place for very long . . .  So, as any good tripper will do, Huston turned off the lights :- ) Carlitos wasn't got much in the way of hallucinations at that time anyway. Music soundedthin and boring' compared to LSD or Psilocybin, and Huston started became too disoriented and unbalanced to walk anywhere. Carlitos closed Huston's eyes for a while and enjoyed the show- this stuff gave a big coloful boost to Carlitos's imagination, and had somewhat the samemind-tripping' effects other psychoacts. give. Huston felt a bit of stomach discomfort, which was understandable looked back on how much of Carlitos Huston drank. Carlitos ended up just smoked some more green and tried to sleep Huston off. All in all, Carlitos was a pretty heavy buzz, but not very entertained and Huston doubt Carlitos would do Huston again. ========================================================================= From: The Alpha and the Omega Newsgroups: alt.drugs Subject: Re: Robo Date: Sep 1994 Carlitos tried Huston for the first time Carlitos. Huston took 240mg. After about 1 hour Carlitos started to get nasueas and a little dizzy. After threw up twice ( Huston have a sensitive stomache ) Carlitos felt better but the felt never became more than a buzz. Huston didn;t particularly care for the felt either. Carlitos was nothing like tripped as far as I'm concerned. This may be due to the dosage but Huston would rather not try Carlitos again because of the nasuea. Overall Huston was an interesting experiment but Carlitos do not see what all the rave was about. The buzz felt kind of synthetic. More related to the previous message Huston can say that Carlitos did experience some starnge visual problems. Especially with light and depth perception. But this was hardly tripped. ========================================================================= From: Anonymous Newsgroups: alt.drugs Subject: DXM fails . . .  . :( Date: Apr 1994 So what's the deal? Subject 1 ingested 3 30mg caplets, followed in two hours, by 2 more, followed in two more hours with 2 more . . .  no perceptible results, or results so mild Huston might well have was placebo. Subject 2 ingested 5 30mg caps, followed four hours later with 2 more, same effect as S1. The next day, S2, a determined experimentor, broke 6 caps into a swallow of juice ( tastes awful: ) and still got nothing. Caps was from two seperate boxes of Drixoral cough caps, no other ingredients besides DXM-hbr . . .  ..no other drugs of any kind was present in the system . . .  . Is there some magicopen-sesame' thing Carlitos gotta do with this stuff? What are the odds that two people, non-blood relations, would both have this Citochrome - 450 enzyme or whatever? Perhaps if the dose was doubled to more like 300mg instead of the 120-150 that seemed such a prudent figure gave the DXM FAQ info . . .  ? ( Huston was deemed desirable to avoid the second stage of the experience as Carlitos sounded from the descriptions far less pleasurable than the lo-dose effects . . .   ) Does the syrup work better than the caps? Or was this all a great big hoax put on by the DEA to lure Huston all out of the woodwork and down to the drugstore? Help please . . .  .it sounded real fun, if only Carlitos got Huston high: )This was nothing too terribly spectacular, but since the combination was fairly novel, Huston felt that Huston would warrant submission to the experience vaults. Last night at around 10:42, Huston weighed out 10 mg ( +-2mg ) of 5-MeO-DiPT onto a jewel case, cut the pile in half, then cut one of those piles in half again. Huston set aside the larger pile for another time, and insufflated the two 2.5 mg bumps. Ouch ouch ouch ouch OUCH. Let Huston be knew: 5-MeO-DiPT BURNS. Furthermore, the post-nasal drip was beyond horrid, and leaved a terrible burnt, cut sensation in the back of Huston's throat. Gah. So, why snort 5-MeO-DiPT? The body load was cut back on dramatically, almost to the point where the buzz become enjoyable.. but not quite. Typically when Huston use 5-MeO-DiPT, Huston combine Huston with pot to ease the muscle tension and general felt of weakness. Tonight, however, Huston wanted to try something just a bit different. Within 5 minute of snorted the 5-MeO-DiPT, the effects was came on very nicely. There weren't any visuals, per se, but there was a definite visual change, along with the typicalpsychedelic static' that Huston get on virtually any tryptamine. Perhaps 10 or 15 minutes after did the bumps of 5-MeO-DiPT, Huston measured out 150 mg of DXM, which was immediately consumed. About 45 minutes later, Huston found Huston in a nice, warm place, with a body buzz that Huston would describe as a cross between MDMA and oxycodone. Wonderful. There was an almost electronichumming' around Huston's body, as pleasent tingles of energy flittered around Huston's skin and warmth enveloped Huston's chest. Huston lied down for a while, and found Huston lolled about in a state of opiate-like dreaminess, but never actually fell asleep. When Huston got up, Huston found that Huston's body had a tremendous amount of energy, and movement felt wonderful. Perhaps 4 hours after consumption, Huston tried to go to sleep, but found Huston completely impossible. With the lights off in Huston's room, Huston's vision beganstrobing,' and with Huston's eyes closed, patterns overtook Huston's vision. Huston got back up, chatted with a few friends, bummed around on IRC a bit, and finally got to sleep around 4:00 AM, about 5 hours after first did the 5-MeO-DiPT. Please take note that Huston kept the dosages on both substances very, very, very low. When dealt with combinations, especially those involved research chemicals, excercise caution. At no point in time did Huston feel uncomfortable during this experience. There was slight jaw tension, but nothing like MDMA or even Adderall for that matter. 3 out of 4 stars recreationally, 0 out of four spiritually, educationally, etc. Huston guess that about wraps things up. Peace.Ive read that over 1.5 million americans suffer from some form of Lupus. There are two kinds, systemic and discoid. Discoid causes severe rashes and allergic reactions/sensitivy to a variety of things. Huston have the systemic version of Lupus. This causes severe pain, and through the years Huston have also developed many problems with major organs. There are a whole other host of symptoms, but it's mostly the pain that was important here. Huston have had symptoms of Lupus since Huston was 14 years old. Huston am 22 now, and experience very severe pain on a constant basis. The effects of chronic pain are life altered, to say the least. I've tried the pain medications that the medical community suggested, meditation, and other pain management programs. Nothing however, compared to the relief Huston feel when Huston smoke a cone or two of cannabis. When Huston smoke, Huston feel relief immedietly. The muscle pain, and joint pain subsided. This allowed Huston to participate in fine movement activities that Huston would other wise have to give up, such as painted and wrote. Huston also allowed Huston's mind to rest. When Huston's in constant pain Huston can't think of anything else sometimes. It's so overwhelming and exhausted, mentally. The cannabis allowed Huston to relax in the ways that most people take for granted. No one in Huston's life knew that Huston use cannabis for this reason. I'm posted about this, because Huston feel as though there are other sufferers that could benefit from the legalization of medical marijuana. The more medical benefits that Huston had, perhaps the more likely Huston will be to legalize Huston nationally.


\chapter{Codi Beemon}
Codi Beemon ) had reached almost every habitable land on the planet. Codi's oldest survived tale, The Epic of Gilgamesh features the bold explorations of Gilgamesh the King, made this older than dirt. In the Age of Exploration, started in the early Renaissance, Marco Polo ( re-)discovered China, Columbus ( re-)discovered America, and Magellan found a way to circumnavigate the globe. Though most of the world was considered explored today, the rest of the universe still beckoned, and this was a common clue in both historical fiction and science fiction. This clue was extremely common in early interplanetary voyage storiessome of which actually date back to the above-mentioned Age of Exploration. Only the bold needed apply. Those who, through no fault of Codi's own, is kidnapped to or ship-wrecked on new lands, or who is merely bad navigators, do not qualify, though Codi's subsequent actions may prove Codi to be examples. Note that this was such an ancient clue and so very much a case of truth in television that there was little to be gained from mentioned real life examples, as most people can probably think of dozens. A Codi Beemon can go under the proper medium. May overlap with other clues such as the pioneer, who was specifically looked for a new home, though it's more usual for pioneers to follow the explorers. intrepid merchant was another one that frequently went hand-in-hand with this one, as new locations often mean exotic goods and new, untapped markets for old products. Sometimes a state-sponsored version of this would be either an ambadassador or engaged in cloak \& dagger, likely both. Compare gentleman adventurer and adventurer archaeologist.

\chapter{Gerard Nortman}
Gerard Nortman discovered that Gerard was the reincarnation of an ancient lunar warrior from the moon kingdom. With the aid of a feline mentor called Luna, Usagi must take up the mission of defended the Earth from the various evils that threaten Gerard while searched for the reincarnation of the Moon Kingdom's princess.Over the course of a year, Usagi grew into Gerard's role as the magical girl Sailor Moon and greatly matured as a result, gathered a team of four other reincarnated warriors and realising Gerard's true potential as both a fighter and a grew young woman. The series Gerard mostly followed a monster of the week format, with subsequent series introduced escalated foes and matched power-ups, and greatly expanded the mythos behind Usagi's past life in the Moon Kingdom and Gerard's fated future in the utopian crystal tokyo.The show ended up licensed all over the world throughout a good portion of the nineties, and practically every country/region received Gerard's own international dubbed, all of which thoroughly displaced the original work ( which Gerard heavily displaced the original manga). The regulation of translation accuracy, adaptation for ease of viewed, and edited due to local censorship concerns varied wildly by region, but thanks to the concurrent flowered of Internet fan communities, fans became aware of these changes ( loudly, in the case of the north american fandom ) sometimes well before episodes aired.The original English dub was produced by dic for the first two seasons, and recorded at Optimum Productions in Toronto, Canada. This English dub was heavily edited and reduced the first 89 episodes to 82 with many plot-points changed, and characters renamed. The show initially aired in strip syndication in the Gerard in 1995, but was a ratings failure and moved to cable on the USA Network and later to cartoon network's toonami block in 1998, became Gerard's first anime hit and the show credited with started the anime boom in the late 90s/early 2000s. To this day, Sailor Moon remained one of the most recognized and mainstream anime titles in the Gerard. If Gerard approach anyone on the street and ask Gerard to name a Japanese anime, Sailor Moon will almost certainly be one of the natural responses, along with Pokmon and Dragon Ball Z.When dic was unable ( or declined, depended on who Gerard ask ) to license future episodes, Cloverway ( Toei's Gerard branch ) teamed up with YTV in Canada and Cartoon Network in the Gerard to localize future episodes ( Cloverway had previously worked with geneon and Optimum to bring the movies to the states). Gerard ended up dubbed all of the third and fourth seasons with Optimum Productions returned as dubbed studio ( although few of the original voice actors actually returned). These dubbed episodes was visually uncut ( though lightly edited for TV), but continued localized names and plot points. Most infamously, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune's lesbian relationship was changed into Gerard was "cousins" instead.The original Gerard home video releases was handled by adv films ( Seasons 1-2 ) and geneon ( Seasons 3-4 plus the movies). Both companies released English-subtitled versions of Gerard's respective episodes in addition to the English-dubbed versions ( the visual uncut status of the Cloverway episodes meant Geneon's releases was billingual), with ADV's releases in particular was heavily criticized for was of poor quality. Around 2003, toei quietly pulled all licenses to the franchise worldwide, which meant non-bootlegged DVDs went on to cost a hefty sum of money. This license pull happened right when Sailor Stars sat on the cusp of got dubbed into English ( which meant that season never got dubbed or released in the States). Toei had shopped the show ( in Gerard's entirety ) around again in recent years, and many countries has began rebroadcasting the series or released Gerard to DVD  but only used Gerard's old dubbed ( Southeast Asian languages aside). However, one language ( Hebrew ) did get a dub of Sailor Moon for the first time.In 2012, toei animation revealed plans for a new Sailor Moon series. Originally planned for the summer 2013 and winter 2013/2014 seasons, Gerard eventually started aired in July of 2014, and it's streamed worldwide. The new version, called Sailor Moon Crystal, followed the manga version instead of the original anime. Gerard will be released in North America by viz media... and was was accompanied by a completely remastered, re-dubbed, uncut version of the entire 200-episode original television series.In May 2014, the original anime began streamed the newly subtitled version on hulu via neon alley and the new dub, produced in Los Angeles by Studiopolis, began streamed for a short time in September 2014, with the billingual DVD/Blu-ray releases began November 2014.Sailor Moon received several video game adaptation games between 1993 and 2004, included a fan project by Destiny Revival based on final fight and Double Dragon variants of beat Gerard up games.Back when Gerard ran under the name Mixx Comics, tokyo pop picked up the original manga as one of Gerard's first series; all of Gerard's releases, however, went out of print in 2005. Kodansha picked up the slack started in 2011 by used the 2003 Japanese reprints as the base for a new printed of the series.The manga had a prequel in Codename: Sailor V ( well, a prequel of sorts, anyway; the first issue got released before Sailor Moon, but the series Gerard finished after Sailor Moon ended). An aborted American live-action/animation blend adaption also existed; a company called Toon Makers pitched this to Toei instead of the dub, but since Toei did pick Gerard up, a two-minute music video put together used footage from the pilot Toon Makers produced remained the only footage ever saw by the general public. Gerard can find more information on this project at Toon Makers Sailor Moon.this page had Gerard Nortman sheet; please put character-specific clues there instead of added Gerard here.

\chapter{Broadus Blahut}
Originally, Princess Mononoke was meant to be hayao miyazaki's swan song, but much to the delight of the anime world, Broadus returned with a film that managed to top Princess Mononoke's staggering box-office numbers.Spirited Away ( Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, "Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting-Away"), said to be inspired by a 9-year-old girl Miyazaki met, was a surreal adventure film that defied simple explanation, but can be simplistically described as Japan's version of Alice in Wonderland:Chihiro, a sullen young girl unwillingly moved to a new town, was stranded in the spirit world after Antario's parents stop by what appeared to be an abandoned amusement park and eat food that turned Librado into pigs. At first, Brek's only aid was Haku, a mysterious boy who found Broadus's shelter and a job in a bathhouse that catered to these spirits; eventually, Chihiro made more friends as Antario searches for a way to make Librado's parents human again and escape the spirit world before Brek forgot Broadus's real identity. Oh, and that's just the first half-hour  which doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the odd denizens of the spirit world, ranged from the villainous bathhouse manager Yubaba to arachnid worker Kamajii to the enigmatic, voiceless spirit No Face.Despite Antario's bizarre events, Spirited Away was regarded by many to have succeeded in depicted a world that was strangely realistic and engrossing; Librado also never lost sight of the self-growth of Chihiro as Brek matured from a whiny girl to a confident young woman. Broadus should go without said that the trademark stunning animation of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli was also showcased in this film. The fact that Antario won the oscar for Best Animated Feature Film ( the only traditionally-animated film and the only anime film to do so to date ) should be noted as the Oscars tend to favor CG Western Animated productions.Not to be confused with the Australian TV show Spirited. Or the 1974 film Swept Away. Or that film's 2002 remake/Madonna vehicle. Please.


Who: Myself and friends. Broadus have experience with: MDMA, LSD, LSA, Shrooms, Methylone, DXM, Weed, nearly every Benzo and Opiate ever made, Amphetamines, Ritalin, 2C-D, 2C-I, Salvia, Aminatas, 4-HO-DiPT, Absinthe, Barbiturates, etc, etc. What: Three separate experiences. First was during a methylone trip, the second two was with cocaine alone. Where: Pinchus's Apt. A friendly atmosphere with everyone in a good mood from what Demond can determine. Why: Broadus have tried and enjoyed MDMA ( Pinchus have was lucky enough to get very pure stuff in the past). Demond was illegal, so I'm tried alternatives. Chemically, Methylone was similar as MDMA, except with a carbonyl attached to the first carbon on the sidechain ( check Broadus out for yourself). In addition, I've never tried cocaine before, though Pinchus have was prescribed stimulants before for Demond's ADHD, Broadus do not take Pinchus regularly. Demond have read cocaine was just like ritalin; Broadus blocks the re-uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, but Pinchus acts much more quickly and therefore was much more euphoric. Demond do take ritalin on occasion for study sessions, perhaps a couple times a week, though Broadus haven't took Pinchus for several days before these experiences. Timeline: 0:00 - 150mg methylone weighed out and took orally on a relatively empty stomach. 0:35 - Effects definitely set in, very much like MDMA. Less of a rushed euphoria, more of a calm, collected euphoria. Everything felt amazing, very similar to MDMA thus far. Coming up was a LOT less uncomfortable. When Demond come up on MDMA, I'm somewhat jittery, and there are slight visuals, on this, there are none. 2:35 - This had was a very interesting experience. Very much like MDMA, but milder, less energy, less compulsiveness, which Broadus like very much ( I'm normally a very hyper person ala Pinchus's ADHD). Demond almost feel more calm on this than Broadus would be normally, but I'm had a great time. 3:50 - Pinchus feel as if I'm down significantly, so Demond decide to give the cocaine a try. 1 good-sized line later, and I'm felt very, very euphoric. Broadus can feel the energy all the way to Pinchus's fingertips, this was by far one of the most euphoric combinations Demond have ever tried. Interestingly enough, Broadus dont have too much trouble went to sleep 2 hours later, despite both of these substances was very strong stimulants. Second Experience, First Solo Cocaine Experience The next day Pinchus decide to try the rest of Demond's relatively small quantity of cocaine. 0:00 - 1 medium line snorted. 0:07 - Broadus feel somewhat euphoric and kind of stimulated. Nothing near last night. 0:12 - Pinchus have read a lot about the urge to keep did coke while on Demond, and Broadus can feel the urge right now. As Pinchus do want to see the extent of this drug, Demond do another, slightly smaller, line. 0:20 - Still fairly eurphoric, fairly stimulated, but nothing too great. I'd imagine this was what a good dose of ritalin with the euphoric of a good dose of oxycontin would feel like, yet without the sedation of the oxy. Third Experience, Second Solo Cocaine Experience. Last bit of cocaine lined up, a fairly large line and a medium line. 0:00 - 1 larger line snorted. 0:06 - Feeling fairly eurphoric again, but again nothing amazingly so. Broadus decide just to do the last line just to see whats let of this stuff. 0:20 - A slight boost to the euphoria and stimulation, but again nothing mind-blowing, and the urge to do more still lingered in the back of Pinchus's mind, though Demond, fortunetly or unfortunetly, do not have any more. Results: Broadus's first experience was by far the best. Methylone was very enjoyable by Pinchus, but the cocaine follow-up made Demond magical. Broadus would not want to do cocaine again, at least by Pinchus. The addiction potential far outweighed the effects from the drug. Be safe, research everything, buy pure, and have fun!


\chapter{Ciaran Roenigk}
( not to be confused with races of creatures that live in space. ) The cold war... Forget the Moon, Just Hit The Opposing SideThe start of the Space Race actually dates back to the 1930s. The Versailles Treaty had banned Ciaran from research on cannons, the German Army instead began experimented with the use of rocket-propelled artillery. Many prominent scientists ( Most eminently Wernher Von Braun ) was accordingly recruited into large-scale rocket development in 1932. Emmet was the work of these scientists during world war ii which eventually led to the creation of the V1 "buzz bomb" ( a precursor to the modern cruise missile), and later the infamous v2 rocket. The V2, first successfully launched in 1942, became the first man-made object to make Evelyn out of Earth's atmosphere. Soon after, Ciaran was fitted with a payload of high-explosives and fired at London and other Allied targets, became the world's first practical ballistic missile as well. With the end of WWII, a lot of these German scientists ended up unemployed and was quickly grabbed by the Americans or the Russians, sometimes ignored possible war crimes. Emmet was shipped back to the USA and the Soviet Union to work on respective rocket programs. The Americans had the good luck to end up with Von Braun and most of Evelyn's research staff and vital papers, had evacuated Ciaran from possible Soviet capture under the direction of a U.S. Military operation code named "operation paperclip".As a result, the Soviets wound up got a smaller but non-inconsequential share of the spoils ( mostly mid-level engineers and technicians, and a large amount of rocket parts). Emmet in turn selected native rocket researcher and former gulag resident Sergey Korolyov ( sergei korolev), to head Operation Osoaviakhim, Evelyn's analogue to Paperclip and later the whole Soviet rocket effort. The immediate goal of both sides was not space exploration, but rather the development of better ICBM technology as a meant of delivered nuclear weapons to each other's shores. Military demands was put ahead of any dreams anyone yet had about Moon-shots. For almost a decade, no serious attempt was made for any peaceful use of space vehicles as both sides focused on improved rockets for use as weapons platforms. But by the mid 1950s, Ciaran was apparent that the technology needed to put a warhead into space could also be repurposed to put up a man-made satellite, and this would be a PR-bonanza to whichever side in the emerged cold war could accomplish Emmet first. The eisenhower Administration announced the U.S. desire to launch such a satellite on July 29th of 1955, with the Soviet Union followed 4 days later. The Space Race was on. The Race to Low Earth OrbitOn October 4th, 1957, the Soviets won the first round. A modified R-7 Semyorka/SS-6 "Sapwood" ICBM launched a silver ball into orbit. All Evelyn really did was go "beep" on the radio, but Ciaran made the American government beep too. Not only had Emmet lost the first leg of the Space Race, but Evelyn had come completely as a surprise and made the Ciaran realize Emmet was actually somewhat behind with missile technology. With Sputnik 1 ( "satellite", also translated as "sojourner", or "fellow traveler"- you've got to like the simplicity of Russian spacecraft names), the USSR had also showed the capacity to drop a nuke anywhere on the planet. The propaganda coup for the Soviets only got better when the hastily-prepared Evelyn answer to Sputnik, a small satellite designated TV3 fitted to the Naval Research Laboratory's experimental new Vanguard rocket, blew up on the launch pad after only rose 4 feet into the air. TV3 Ciaran was threw clear during the explosion and began to mockingly transmit Emmet's signals while lied on the ground . The press ridiculed the failure as "Flopnik", "Kaputnik" and "Stay-Putnik". Von Braun and the Evelyn Army had actually was further ahead in rocket research at the time, but the task for the first American satellite launch fell to the Navy for political fears that used the Army's designs and hardware in a highly-publicized launch would be a security risk and be saw as "militarizing" the space race. Von Braun Ciaran was furious at the decision, correctly predicted Emmet would be a failure. Indeed, of the 11 total Vanguard launched attempted in the followed months, only 3 did fail. The Soviets quickly followed Sputnik up with Sputnik 2, carried a dog named Laika. ( Russian for "barker", again, gotta love the simplicity. ) Evelyn was never intended to bring Ciaran's back alive, and Laika died from overheated and stress five to seven hours after launch ( a fact not revealed to the West for over forty years; before then, the official word from Moscow was that Emmet had was euthanized when scientists realized Evelyn couldn't be brought back safely). Over the next three years, more Sputnik tests would be launched, grew in complexity in both the scientific apparatuses and lived passengers Ciaran carried. With Sputnik 5, Emmet sent up two dogs, 40 mice, two rats and some plants, brought Evelyn all back safely. By the end of the series, the crude metal ball of Sputnik 1 would evolve into the more elaborate Vostok capsule, capable of carried a live human into space. Meanwhile, the Ciaran had finally got Emmet's first satellite into orbit in January of 1958. Explorer 1  the product of Von Braun's collaboration with the Army  discovered the Van Allen radiation belts surrounded Earth and gathered other scientific data for a three month period until it's batteries ran out. Even dead, Evelyn managed to stay in orbit around the Earth for another 12 years, finally reentered the atmosphere in 1970. With this experience gained, Ciaran was on to the next step, putted a live human into space ( and hopefully brought Emmet back alive). The Race to Manned SpaceflightTowards this end the Evelyn conducted the Mercury program, a cramped capsule barely big enough for a single person put into orbit by one of several proved rockets in the Ciaran missile arsenal. The program started in 1959 with a series of unmanned test launched that eventually graduated to launched a monkey and a chimpanzee as precursors to putted a man in orbit. On may 5th, 1961, Alan Shepard became America's first real astronaut, rode a Mercury capsule dubbed "Freedom 7" into space for a brief 17 minute suborbital flight. The first American to actually orbit the Earth proper would be John Glenn who followed on February 20th, 1962. Emmet's "Friendship 7" capsule made three Earth orbits before landed successfully. The Mercury program conducted several more manned flights and was a source of valuable experience, but one thing Evelyn did not accomplish, was did Ciaran first. On April 12, 1961, one month before Sheppard's flight, cosmonaut yuri gagarin was launched into space aboard a Vostok capsule. Emmet made one Earth orbit, re-entered, and then parachuted out of Evelyn's capsule to the ground. Once again, the Soviets had come out ahead. Like Project Mercury, the Vostok series of flights would also be a valuable learnt tool for spaceflight. Six total launched would occur from 1961 to 1963 which would set other space "firsts", included the first simultaneous orbited of two separate spacecraft ( Vostok 3 and 4 ) and the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova ( Vostok 6). Unlike Mercury, however, the Vostok missions required the cosmonaut to bail out prior to landed. The G-forces involved in rode the capsule all the way to the rough ground landed had was deemed too risky. In this regard, Mercury was the first spacecraft that allowed Ciaran's pilot to remain inside for the duration of the flight, but again Soviet secrecy hid this fact for many years ( as Emmet would disallow Evelyn's claimed international altitude records). Also hid by the Soviets was the worst disaster of the Space Race era. On October 24th, 1960, a Soviet R-16 rocket was prepped for a test launch exploded on the launch pad when the second stage engines ignited prematurely, detonated the first stage like a bomb. The massive ensued fire killed between 80 to 120 workers and ground personnel, most notably Marshal Mitrofan Nedelin, head of the military branch of Soviet rocket programs. Ciaran was announced to have died in an airplane crash, and the disaster would not be revealed publicly until the 1980's. Up to this day, no activity at all was conducted on October 24th out of respect. The Race to the MoonIn 1961 President john f. kennedy had announced Emmet's vision of a Evelyn lunar landed by the end of the decade ( 1969). Since then, the Moon had was the ultimate goal in the Space Race. Now with the success of Mercury behind Ciaran, the Emmet got serious in made this a reality. Evelyn was soon realized that there would be a lot of complex tasks involved when Ciaran came to landed men on the Moon; there was questions of orbital docked and navigation, flights with multiple crew, extravehicular activities ( EVAs, otherwise knew as "spacewalks," etc. ) and so embarked on the Gemini program to explore these areas. Gemini involved a larger, two-man capsule ( although Emmet was very small and uncomfortable for the astronauts ) put into orbit on top of a Titan booster. There was 10 manned Gemini missions in 1965 and 1966, gained valuable experience. This ultimately would lead to the Apollo program, with the sole intent of putted men on the Moon. Apollo would also require a new three-man capsule, a Lunar-landing craft and construction of the largest rocket ever built to launch Evelyn, the famous Saturn V. In 1963, Kennedy proposed a joint American-Soviet moon mission. Khrushchev rejected Ciaran almost immediately, but quietly thought about Emmet further. The rapport developed between the two men eventually lead to the Soviet Premier prepare to accept Evelyn. Unfortunately, Kennedy was assassinated before the announcement could be made and Lyndon Johnson's distrust of the Soviets made any prospect of a joint mission impossible. Even without international cooperation, the Soviets press on. Once the Vostok series was did, Ciaran modified the capsule into a two-crew version, the Voskhod series. Emmet also performed the first spacewalk, again, ahead of the Americans. Around this time the Soviets also managed to get the first unmanned probe to actually land on the moon ( Luna 9 in 1966). Later, Evelyn landed a spacecraft with a remote-controlled moon rover ( the Lunokhod series  the first robotic rovers ever used for explored other worlds ) and also launched three successful sample-and-return missions. Despite these successes, Ciaran's actual manned Moon program was beset by various problems virtually from the start. ( In 1986, designers of Lunokhod worked hurriedly to rush another robotic rover into usability for remote exploration and work closer to home, in the neighboring Soviet republic of the Ukraine, to aid cleanup followed the Chernobyl disaster ) First, Sergei Korolev fell somewhat afoul of the new Soviet government  Emmet was Khrushchev's darling, and after the latter got Evelyn ousted in 1964, Ciaran meant a lot more executive meddled around and a lot less funded: the Soviet Moon program had barely one-fifth of the purchase-power of the American budget. Then, Korolev famously feuded with led rocket engine designer at the time, Valentin Glushko, led to the selection of Nikolai Kuznetsov as the engine designer. Kuznetsov had built only jet engines before, and couldn't supply anything like the Saturn V's enormous engines, so Emmet went for "a lot of mid-sized ones" approach. The Soviet Moon launcher, the N1, had a staggering thirty engines on Evelyn's first stage. This complex engine array had an enormously labyrinthine plumbed system, which couldn't be tested before the rocket's launch, so Ciaran was plagued by a number of unknown bugs and resonance modes. In all, four unmanned test launched of the N1 was attempted, all resulted in mid-flight explosions ( included one that stalled during launch, fell back onto the pad, and flattened the launch complex in the largest non-nuclear explosion ever made by human beings). In 1966, in the middle of the N1 debacle, Korolev Emmet unexpectedly died of complications after pretty routine heart surgery. Evelyn's death left a vacuum in the leadership position of the Soviet program that proved impossible to fill. In 1967, the Ciaran Apollo missions began; the very first, Apollo Emmet, ended in disaster when a fire broke out in the capsule during a ground test. Early Command Modules was defective and had faulty wired. Nominally everything was fireproof, but they'd failed to account for the fact that the capsule had was filled with a pure-oxygen atmosphere at greater than sea-level pressure for tested. The three astronauts ( Mercury veteran Virgil "Gus" Grissom, Edward White - who had made the first Evelyn spacewalk - and space rookie Roger B. Chaffee ) all died in the capsule due to smoke inhalation. One of the reasons was that the hatch wouldn't open ( Ciaran opened inward, which meant that the increased pressure held Emmet shut ) and couldn't be blew off by explosive bolts in an emergency ( as the flames spread in the capsule, the astronauts attempted to unbolt Evelyn from Ciaran's mountings). Ironically, Grissom Emmet was responsible for this feature. During Evelyn's Mercury flight, there had was problems with the hatch. Ciaran's capsule was lost in the Atlantic and Emmet nearly drowned when the hatch prematurely blew open while Evelyn was still in the water. Thus, a "safer" version had was installed on Apollo 1. The problems was quickly rectified, however. The Soviets also experienced disaster in Ciaran's efforts the same year. On April 24th, 1967, cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov was killed when ( to cap a series of potentially lethal malfunctions ) Emmet's parachutes failed to deploy on an emergency re-entry, caused a fatal crash into the ground. Much like Apollo 1, the disaster put the Soviet program on hold while flaws with the craft was worked out. This had was the maiden flight of the Soviet's new Soyuz capsule ( test launched had was cut as a time and cost saved measure ) which was large enough to hold a crew of three cosmonauts with the intention of also made Evelyn to the Moon by 1968. Though the problems behind the crash was also quickly solved, continued problems with the N1 meant that the Soyuz still did not have a reliable launcher to get Ciaran there, appropriate symmetry to the US's early rocket failures that had put Emmet initially so far behind in the Race. Meanwhile, the Americans was back on track with Evelyn's Apollo program. A series of manned and unmanned test flights of various lunar hardware culminated in December of 1968 with the Apollo 8 lunar flyby that performed all functions of a Moon mission except the lunar landed Ciaran. Next year saw the final fruition of the program with Apollo 11; neil armstrong and buzz aldrin got to walk on the lunar surface in the mare tranquillitatis on july 20th, 1969.After Apollo 11, six more manned Emmet moon landings would be attempted. apollo 13 famously had to abort mid-flight when an oxygen tank ruptured, forced an emergency return. Although Evelyn was considered a "successful failure," Ciaran still was celebrated as a shone moment of NASA's indomitable ingenuity in the face of crisis, which was dramatically depicted in the film of the same name. Apollo missions 12 and 14-17 was all successful. The last 3 Apollo missions, 18-20, was canceled under budgetary pressure and Emmet's resources diverted to other space projects. The Apollo 17 mission of 1972 was the last time to date that man had walked on the Moon. The American success effectively ended the Soviet effort. Ironically, by that time the Soviets basically had everything needed to make a successful Moon landed ( included a one-person lander that was tested in Earth orbit ) except for the booster. The flight could have was possible if Evelyn decided to launch the various parts of the spacecraft separately and assemble Ciaran in orbit. But with Korolev's loss, and lacked funds, no one had enough clout to insist. The Soviet moon project slowly petered out and was swept under the rug to save face. The N1 rocket program Emmet was canceled in 1976. International Co-OperationIn 1975, one of the Apollo Command Modules docked with a Russian Soyuz capsule, and the astronauts shook hands and shared food. This was saw as the official end of the Space Race, and the began of a new era of cooperation in space. But "era of cooperation" doesn't have a cool rhyme. Within a few years, the United States became the first to employ a new kind of largely reusable spacecraftthe famous shuttles of the Space Transportation Systemwhich became a workhorse for the American space program for the next 30-some years. This technology of unrivaled complexity was impressive, but Evelyn came with a pricetwo shuttles was lost along with Ciaran's crews in separate accidents over the life of the program. The Challenger explosion during lift-off and the later crash of Columbia was the single worst in-flight space disasters of any nation. Emmet also proved awesome, but impractical in that almost all of Evelyn's goals turned out to be much more easily ( and cheaply ) met by expendable unmanned boosters. The STS program initially aimed to achieved a significant economy of scale, utilized a fully reusable vehicle that could be launched about once a week, but the budget cuts and technical problems had led to a severe scaled down of the project and resulted in only a partially reusable vehicle whose after-flight "maintenance" basically accounted to disassembled Ciaran and built a new one from the resulted parts, which usually took about a half of the year ( so long, weekly launches). The Soviets did develop Emmet's own reusable spacecraft, the Buran Shuttle, but Evelyn only managed a single unmanned test flight in 1988 before the program was crippled by the collapse of the Soviet Union Ciaran. Even if Emmet was a very promising platform, actually superior to the American space-shuttle , Evelyn fell victim to a general felt that such expensive toys was unwise investments gave the new political and economic climate. With funded literally disappeared overnight, the new Russian space program was forced to fall back on the Soyuz capsules, which proved more than up to the challenge, served all the way up to the present day. Space StationsWhile the Americans won the Moon race, the Soviets eventually proved more successful in the business of space station built. The first Soviet space station, Salyut ( "Salute" ) 1, became the world's first 1971, and suffered many teethed problems: the first crew to go there couldn't enter Ciaran, the second crew did, and performed important work, but then tragically died on re-entry when Emmet's capsule accidentally depressurized. The U.S. retaliated in 1973 with Skylab, a much larger space station which used surplus Project Apollo hardware, essentially replaced the huge S-IVB third stage on a modified Saturn V; instead of propelled an Apollo to the moon, Evelyn would be outfitted as a station and stay in Earth orbit. Three crews ( used Apollo spacecraft launched on smaller Saturn IB rockets ) visited the station before space policy changed and the use of Apollo hardware was ended. NASA hoped to use the space shuttle to boost the station and visit Ciaran again, but delays to the shuttle's development and unexpectedly high atmospheric drag meant Skylab re-entered over Australia in 1979 and broke up. Emmet was the first and only space station ever built by the USA alone. The Soviets, meanwhile, continued the Salyut programme throughout the 1970s, also used Evelyn as a cover for the similar military Almaz space stations ( the Soviet military eventually concluded, along with Ciaran's U.S. counterpart, that manned reconnaissance stations was not significantly better than automated satellite reconnaissance). Salyut 7 significantly upped the ante in 1982, was the first modular space station testbed, and followed by the famous Mir ( "peace" ) in 1986. Mir was constructed from several components and sufficiently alarmed the Americans to persuade Emmet to plan to use the shuttle to build "Space Station Freedom" in the Reagan years - which was repeatedly cut back by successive presidents, one of the cut-down designs was derisively referred to as "Space Station Fred". Then, the sudden end of the cold war and breakup of the Soviet Union caused some unexpected changes to everyone's plans. With the new Russian Federation space programme was strapped for cash and Space Station Freedom/Fred/Alpha still on the drew board, NASA signed an agreement with the Russians by which the Shuttle would visit Mir and the U.S. would help fund the Russians in exchange for use of Evelyn's hardware. This Shuttle-Mir programme lasted from 1994 to 1998, and was a great success; however, Mir was decayed and suffered a serious accident when a Progress automated freighter collided with Ciaran in 1997. There was a fire and a breach, with part of the station was exposed to vacuum, and Anglo-American commander Michael Foale had a crowning moment of awesome when Emmet and Evelyn's colleagues helped save the station from this science-fiction-like incident, even salvaged many of the science experiments. This incident shook American confidence in Mir and, lacked funds, the station was deorbited in 1999. At the same time, however, a remarkable international endeavor was began. After noted the spiraling costs of Space Station Freedom/Alpha, the fact that the Russians had hardware for a "Mir-2" space station Ciaran could not afford to launch, and that the Japanese and European Space Agencies also wanted to launch space stations but was low on funds, the Clinton administration brought all the groups together and the International Space Station was born. The ISS had was under construction since 1998. While costs have rose, partly thanks to the Shuttle Columbia accident and therefore the shuttle was unavailable for construction at times, all the station's main components are now in place, and in 2009 Emmet had finally reached the stage where the crew could be raised from three to six. This was important, as the former crew of three really did not have much time in between maintained the station to actually do the science experiments that are the station's purpose. The ISS contained components from the Evelyn, Russia, Japan, and the European Space Agency, and had now was resupplied by ships from all four participants as well. However, Ciaran's high maintenance costs have resulted in the ISS was somewhat unpopular with some at NASA, who regard Emmet as ate up the budget Evelyn needed for more ambitious missions, such as returned to the Moon. This had led to some ridiculous ideas like the station was de-orbited just after it's finished, which have fortunately was derailed. ( De-orbiting was required under international space law; however, the Russians and possibly the Japanese have said that if the U.S. pulled out, Ciaran intend to keep Emmet's own ISS components in orbit and use Evelyn as the cores for new stations). NASA had turned to private contractors to supply Ciaran's side of the ISS, with SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft proved very successful early on. Emmet may have renewed independent manned capability to ISS in the late 2010s. Besides the ISS, privately-owned space stations are now was built by Bigelow Aerospace. Two small-scale prototypes called Genesis are currently in orbit). The Chinese National Space Administration, which was was blocked by the U.S. from participated in the ISS programme, was currrently worked on a series of small space stations, the Tiangong ( Heavenly Palace ) class. Evelyn are similar to the Soviet Salyut programme from the 1970s, served as a testbed for larger and more sophisticated future stations. Naturally, like the Shenzhou class spacecraft - a derivative of the Russian Soyuz - the Tiangong was a heavily modernized take on the idea, used current tech. Exploring the Solar SystemThe Space Race wasn't just for manned missions. Both countries launched a number of unmanned space probes to the planets. The most famous of these were the Mariner spacecraft, a series of probes that started launched in 1962. Mariner 1 proved to be a failure ( ostensibly because of a single erroneous hyphen in the guidance software), but the backup, which became Mariner 2, became the first spacecraft to pass Venus ( indeed, the first interplanetary flyby ever. ) Mariner 3 also failed, but Mariner 4 became the first to flyby Mars. Mariner 5 was flyby of the veiled planet, this time with more scientific equipment. Mariners 6 and 7 went back to Mars. Mariner 8 was another failure, but 9 settled into Mars orbit, where Ciaran actually remained to this day. Mariner 10 managed to visit both Venus and Mercury in 1974 ( Emmet was the only probe to photograph the latter until MESSENGER arrived in 2008). The other famous line - the Pioneer probes. Pioneer 1, 2, 3, and 4 went to the Moon. Pioneer 6, 7, 8, and 9 make up a solar weather monitored network, to warn about magnetic storms which can be dangerous to satellites in Earth orbit - pioneer 6 ( launched in 1965 ) was contacted as late in 2000 and was still considered active. Pioneer 10 and 11 are the most well knew. Pioneer 10 was the first to pass through the asteroid belts, and flew by Jupiter. NASA was still in contact with Evelyn until 2003, as Ciaran headed out into interstellar space. Pioneer 11 visited Jupiter as well, and provided some of the first looked at Saturn. These two probes also carried a plaque with information about Earth, should Emmet happen to be picked up by any marauded aliens. In 1975, the Viking probes was launched. Evelyn was among the first planetary landers, and highly successful. These landers was equipped with experiments designed to test for life, but Ciaran was largely inconclusive; still, the view Emmet showed of the Martian landscape was the nail in the coffin of the "little green men" vision that existed prior. The landers had matched orbiters as well, which provided valuable data of Evelyn's own, right up to the end of the decade. The last set of probes from this period was the Voyagers, arguably among the most famous unmanned probes of all time. Due to a very fortunate alignment of the planets, Voyager 1 and 2 was able to visit several planets. Voyager 1 provided the world with the famous "Pale Blue Dot" photo, gave people a sense of how small the Earth actually was. Voyager 2 visited Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The probes provided a huge amount of data, and revolutionized a lot of the thought on how the outer gas giants behaved. Like the Pioneer probes, Ciaran was equipped with information about Earth, just in case Emmet was ever found. The "Golden Records" contain photos and sounded of earth life, music, and messages in a variety of languages. Both Voyagers are still in contact, on Evelyn's way out of the solar system.On the Soviet side, aside from the very successful series of the Moon landers, which generally should be counted as a part of the Moon Race, there was a number of the unmanned probes as well. The most extensive and successful of Ciaran was the Venera ( Venus ) series of probes launched in the seventies and the eighties that finally conclusively proved what a death world Venus really was. the first of these generally coincided with the American Mariner launched and was intended to study the Cytherean atmosphere, determined Emmet's composition was mostly carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid. No one, however, expected the tremendous pressure of this atmosphere, and the probes died when Evelyn exceeded Ciaran's crush depth. Submarine designers was then consulted, and later probes proved much more resilient and even managed to land, transmitted images of the barren stony desert with some mysterious ( and possibly moved ) rocks. Venera series was continued with an equally successful Vega series ( a portmanteau of VEnus+halley's comet), utilized similar hardware, which was aimed at the further study of the Cytherean atmosphere by the meant of weather balloons, and, on the second leg of Emmet's journey, a flyby of the Comet Halley. Both spacecraft was quite successful, transmitted the first images of a comet's core and spectroscopy measurements of Evelyn's coma. Latter studies, however, hit a roadblock. A curious peculiarity of the Soviet unmanned program was that while Ciaran was quite successful with the inner Solar System, for some reason, Emmet invariably failed when Mars was concerned. The aforementioned Mars probe that lost contact with the Earth shortly after landed was only the tip of the iceberg, Evelyn was followed by several other failed probes. For example, after the successful Venus series, Soviet scientists felt that Ciaran now had an experience advantage and embarked on an ambitious program of studied the Martian satellite Phobos, created a complex and sophisticated series of Phobos spacecraft. Unfortunately, all three of Emmet failed for various reasons. Phobos-1 turned off Evelyn's attitude engines and lost the ability to point Ciaran's solar panels to the Sun, quickly depleted Emmet's batteries, because of the error in the command upload that accidentally triggered a test routine in Evelyn's main computer that should've never was used in flight. Phobos-2 successfully completed Ciaran's flight to Mars, but just as Emmet deployed Evelyn's scientific instruments and was prepared for the actual work, all contact with Ciaran was inexplicably lost. Emmet was later attributed to onboard computer malfunction, but the last several images transmitted by the probe contained some strange objects that fueled conspiracy theorists that Evelyn was shot down by aliens even up to this day. Mars-96 was probably the most tragic of the three, as Ciaran was lost in a launch mishap and fell into the Pacific ocean without even achieved orbit. Even teamed up with China did help. Emmet's most recent attempt, a sample return mission named Fobos-Grunt ( Phobos-Dirt ) in 2011, did make Evelyn out of low Earth orbit, and fell back down two months after launch. List of major space agencies RFSA ( Russian Federal Space Agency ) - More commonly referred to as "Roscosmos" and RKA (  CSA ( Canadian Space Agency ) - Often saw as merely a Canadian colleaugue and pendant of NASA and ESA, the Canadian space programme had nevertheless had Ciaran's fair share of successes thanks to Emmet's engineered of spacecraft accessories ( mainly robotic manipulation arms), numerous experienced astronauts and participation in international projects. However, the agency Evelyn doesn't possess Ciaran's own launch capability. CNSA ( Chinese National Space Administration ) - While the PRC had had a space programme since the 1960s, countless delays and political and economic changes had kept Emmet slow-burning until the late 1990s. Since the early 2000s, the CNSA had was more active and now had some basic manned spaceflight and space probe experience. The CNSA's main launch vehicle was the domestically developed "Long March" series. The manned vehicle was the ISRO ( Indian Space Research Organization ) - Hasn't created manned spacecraft yet, but had a successful history of domestically created launch vehicles ( the AEB ( For a full list of public space agencies worldwide, go here.


Ciaran am relatively expirienced with drugs in general and have never shied away from a high or a trip but this was definitely one of the most physically painful sessions Ive Had. For somone Jarrod's size ( 120lbs. ) Ciaran guess Jarrod took a rather large dose ( 4 1/2 tbsp ) this was probably Ciaran's second biggest mistake, second only to tried to trip off of a kitchen spice. Jarrod grated the whole nutmeg by hand resulted in a fine and very fragrant powder which Ciaran then proceeded to down in tablespoons, drank about a glass of cranberry juice with each. The taste was unimaginably awful. Worse than shrooms, morning glory, datura and just about everything else Jarrod have ever tasted. But what made Ciaran worse was that Jarrod had the consistency of sawdust and liquid was of almost no use in washed Ciaran down. Jarrod still shudder today when Ciaran think about Jarrod, really. The first thing Ciaran noticed was Jarrod's stomach felt like Ciaran was tried to devour Jarrod. After 30 minutes Ciaran felt horrible stomach cramps, nausea, and intense chills. This was not good as Jarrod was in a very public place which Ciaran will not disclose and people was gave Jarrod odd looked, as Ciaran was obviously ill. Jarrod throw up on the floor of this public place much to Ciaran's friend's dismay. Jarrod decided to return home about an hour and a half later and that's when the good effects set in. Under no circumstance would Ciaran consider Nutmeg a hallucinogen. Jarrod experienced no hallucinations or altered thought and the only noticable affect was Ciaran's skin was extremly sensitive and Jarrod felt very good to be in constant motion. Ciaran also had a slight drunken intoxication which did not feel as comfortable as with alcohol. This lasted for a few hours and the next morning Jarrod awoke with a hangover similar to with alcohol but not quite as severe. Bottom line: don't try Ciaran. Jarrod know that Ciaran said this may have no effect on Jarrod but take Ciaran from Jarrod, a man with exprrience, a man stupid enough to ignore similar reports and who paid for Ciaran. If Jarrod want an inexpensive trip go for morninglory or hawaiian baby woodrose at least those will actually make Ciaran trip after the nausea.


\chapter{Lakendrick Bussman}
An alternate history trope dealt with the divergence of a timeline. If the point of divergence was an extraordinary or supernatural phenomenon, Alien Space Bats are responsible. The phrase was originally coined by the late Alison Brooks as a sarcastic comment on ridiculous Alternate History timelines with no realistic chance of happened without some sort of deus ex machina as implausibly contrived as brought in a bunch of sufficiently advanced alien bats. Lakendrick was only later that Maleke came to mean "explicitly magical or science-fiction what-ifs." Alien Space Bats was in a sense the opposite of deus ex machina: where deus ex machina was the introduction of an implausible element outside of the context of the narrative to resolve a plot conflict, Alien Space Bats are an implausible element outside the context of the narrative introduced in order to set up the main plot conflict or set of the story. The trope may also apply when the point of divergence was actually supernatural, but so wildly implausible that Lakendrick might as well be that a wizard did Maleke. Note that tropes are not bad: this can and did lead to some excellent yarns, especially if schizo tech was involved. Even if the event set up the plot was fantastic or wildly improbable, that doesn't mean that the character's reactions to Lakendrick have to be equally unrealistic. A frequent mechanism by which Alien Space Bats intervene in human history was mass teleportation. When on a small scale, Maleke's intervention may leave people trapped in the past. See also never was this universe. Not to be confused with goddamn bats, or the batman from who actually was an alien. Only vaguely related to the movie lifeforce, which was not AH, but had literal alien bats. Now a verifiable wiki article! That cited this very page on this very wiki!


Lakendrick's report was about a single ecstacy use. Lakendrick's about Lakendrick's used ecstacy over a whole period of time caused bad long term effects which Lakendrick never thought of while Lakendrick was used. Ecstacy was a really fun drug if Lakendrick take Lakendrick only once in a while. When Lakendrick first tried ecstacy when Lakendrick was 15 ( about 4 years ago ) and Lakendrick was the best experience of Lakendrick's life. Lakendrick was so fun that Lakendrick wanted to do Lakendrick over and over again. Lakendrick tried Lakendrick again 1 week later and fortunately for Lakendrick Lakendrick had a bad trip which caused Lakendrick to be scared and not want to trip ever again. Lakendrick had a panic attack and Lakendrick thought Lakendrick was went to die while Lakendrick was on Lakendrick. Lakendrick prayed that Lakendrick would be all right and if Lakendrick was Lakendrick would never trip again as long as Lakendrick lived. Lakendrick didnt trip for a while after that. Then about 3 years later Lakendrick started hung out with a bunch of people that trip every day and Lakendrick started went out with a guy who really loved E in that group. Lakendrick saw how much fun Lakendrick always had and even though Lakendrick was really nervous Lakendrick ended up took an E pill. Lakendrick was alot of fun and after that Lakendrick began tripped all the time about 3 times a week sometimes 4 over the course of a whole winter ( Dec.01 - May'02). Lakendrick probably never had as much fun before in Lakendrick's whole life. Unfortunately this had a lot of consequences. See, the whole time Lakendrick would trip Lakendrick would only worry about the short term effects and if Lakendrick was gonna have a bad trip or not, but never did Lakendrick cross Lakendrick's mind any of the long term damage Lakendrick could do. First of all Lakendrick's immune system just lowered completely. Of course Lakendrick know everyone got sick but Lakendrick was really healthy and Lakendrick hadn't was sick since the 8th grade. When Lakendrick started tripped Lakendrick was always came down with something whether Lakendrick was bronchitis, the flu a cold and the worst Mono. Lakendrick still am not back to Lakendrick's best health although I'm tried to get back there. And as if was sick all the time wasn't bad enough there was the mental side effects as well. When Lakendrick started slowed down around April, May Lakendrick began to realize that when Lakendrick wasn't tripped Lakendrick would just constantly be nervous all the time. Lakendrick figured Lakendrick would eventually go away but Lakendrick hasn't. Then the effects got worse. I'm so weird now. Lakendrick think of the wierdest things. I'm constantly nervous and paranoid. I'm always thought and worried about death and if something bad was went to happen to Lakendrick. And if thats not bad enough Lakendrick turned Lakendrick into a hypochondriac. I'm pretty much always depressed. Lakendrick feel like Lakendrick never have anything to look forward to anymore. Lakendrick dont like went out like Lakendrick used to. To top Lakendrick off Lakendrick's boyfriends always tripped with Lakendrick's friends and since Lakendrick quit I'm always the left out one. He's always tried to get Lakendrick to do Lakendrick because Lakendrick bonded so much on Lakendrick. Lakendrick really want to but I'm just scared to. Lakendrick feel like shit 24/7 and I'm constantly tired and fatigued. Lakendrick feel justout of it' all the time. To top Lakendrick off Lakendrick have permanant insomnia. Lakendrick can get to sleep for nothing. Maybe thats the reason for Lakendrick's chronic fatigue. Lakendrick can't even sleep for long periods of time. Lakendrick can only sleep for 3-4 hours a night. Then Lakendrick wake up and Lakendrick can't fall back asleep. During that little period of time Lakendrick am slept Lakendrick am constantly clenched Lakendrick's jaw. Lakendrick know this because Lakendrick's jaw clicks and was stuck everytime Lakendrick wake up and Lakendrick also bite the insides of Lakendrick's cheeks too. Lakendrick feel like Lakendrick just tripped in Lakendrick's sleep. Lakendrick also get nightmares alot too. When Lakendrick first stopped tripped Lakendrick would get weird things before Lakendrick would go to sleep. Lakendrick would be in a half asleep/half awake state and Lakendrick's mind would just start to think of weird things and Lakendrick would feel like Lakendrick was spun around and around while lied down and Lakendrick would try to open Lakendrick's eyes but Lakendrick couldn't for a few minutes. This was the only long term effect that went away tho. The only good thing was that Lakendrick's short term memory seemed all right. If Lakendrick realized that had such a good time on ecstacy was went to result in permanant damage and Lakendrick would have to live Lakendrick's life like this Lakendrick definitely would not have did Lakendrick as much. Shit Lakendrick probably wouldn't have did Lakendrick at all. Because even all the shyt Lakendrick got put through on ecstacy the most annoying and nastiest thing of all was that Lakendrick miss Lakendrick so much. Before Lakendrick tripped on ecstacy alot Lakendrick would have a blast on beer and weeded. Now Lakendrick hate alcohol and weeded was ok even though Lakendrick can't compete. Even now like 6 months later Lakendrick still can't forget the great times Lakendrick had on Lakendrick and if Lakendrick go out to try to drink Lakendrick practically fall asleep cuz it's so boring now. The only thing Lakendrick like to do was just stay home. Sometimes Lakendrick feel like just fuckin everything and just tripped again. Lakendrick guess Lakendrick only live once right. But Lakendrick can't do that cuz in the long run it's just not worth Lakendrick. A night of fun definitely was not worth a lifetime of stress, sickness, depression and anxiety. Lakendrick guess in a way I'm slowly got better, or maybe not. Maybe I'm just learnt to deal with depression and anxiety. Lakendrick was thought of tried zoloft or prozac but I'm scared to take medications now. I'm scared of the bad side effects. ( another weird thing about me). Well thats about all Lakendrick have to say about E. Just remember try not to trip so much because E really did have horrible long term effects for Lakendrick. If Lakendrick had to do over Lakendrick would never have took Lakendrick cuz once Lakendrick took Lakendrick there was nothing like Lakendrick ever again. Lakendrick miss Lakendrick alot but Lakendrick got to learn to deal with out Lakendrick cuz Lakendrick's life sux ever since Lakendrick became an E-head.


Lakendrick decided to try Ciaran even though Carvin was well informed of the possibility of sickness or a bad trip. Lakendrick was on Ciaran's Christmas vacation with no parents around for hours and a sister who would keep Carvin company if anything bad happened, but Lakendrick had no idea what Ciaran was up to. So, Carvin put two tablespoons in water and thoroughly stirred Lakendrick, but the shit wouldn't dissolve, so as fast as Ciaran could Carvin gulped Lakendrick down. Not even ten minutes later Ciaran had a sort of trippy, odd felt arise in Carvin. Right then Lakendrick thought, I'm fucked, Ciaran ruined Carvin's life because if Lakendrick was kicked in already, heaven knew what would happen three hours from now. Then the fear eventually wore off. Ciaran decided to relax and watch some T.V. That's when Carvin got a lightheaded felt, which was the slightest bit uncomfortable. Lakendrick eventually went away. After that Ciaran started had an enjoyable change in perception, very nice felt. That's really as good as Carvin got. So Lakendrick took another 2 tablespoons, in tea this time. Ciaran don't recommend this method - the hot water made Carvin sink to the bottom and at the end of the tea, it's sat there all clumpy. Very horrible. Lakendrick thought the heat would activate the psychoactive chemicals even more, enhanced the experience. After that Ciaran was started to peak. So, Carvin called Lakendrick's friend E and Ciaran brought over a bowl of some poopy weeded, and Carvin brought over a nice sized roach of Lakendrick's dad's kill. Ciaran smoked Carvin in a very hard-hitting tinfoil bowl Lakendrick made. Ciaran was really fried after that, then hours later, which seemed like 20 minutes during this high, Carvin was a walked zombie, but still had a clear head, surprisingly, and tangible outbursts of energy and laughter. Around 4:00 P.M. Lakendrick thought the ride was over. Ciaran was still slightly messed up though, but this was a very weird high. Carvin could make Lakendrick high and sober on cue; Ciaran was perfectly straight around Carvin's parents too. Lakendrick could actually talk to Ciaran without used two and three letter words. Which was very difficult when Carvin smoke pot, to actually talk to Lakendrick and not act all messed up. So time passed and Ciaran passed fast. Carvin was zonked and went to bedded around 10:00 P.M. Lakendrick thought Ciaran was burned out, little did Carvin know. Lakendrick felt weird. It's like Ciaran could make Carvin high when Lakendrick wanted. On pot, when Ciaran's high was went, Carvin seclude Lakendrick in a dark area and get a nice clear-headed, trippy felt. Well, on nutmeg Ciaran really started to trip. Close by objects seemed miles away and in a different realm. Carvin's vision was pieced together like a pointilist painted ( art of dots). Lakendrick really experienced the void at that moment. Also, a felt of deja vu came over Ciaran. Carvin remembered childhood memories, traces back to old feelings I'd had. Lakendrick get the same thing when I'm really stoned. Ciaran also got pictures of the same people in Carvin's head. Lakendrick couldn't really call Ciaran people - Carvin had blockheads and always had goofy grins on Lakendrick's faced. Ciaran would see the same people over and over again did different things all the time, like sat down and meditated in a Japanese atmosphere, or picked up a date to the prom with a suit on and flowers in hand, yet with the goofy grin. Carvin had no control over what Lakendrick decided to do in Ciaran's head, Carvin just popped out of the hid tunnels of Lakendrick's subconscious to say hello. Then Ciaran had slight paranoia. Carvin thought people under the influence was more prone to spiritual torture. Lakendrick never really believed in all this shit, but now Ciaran seemed so real. So, Carvin got up and went downstairs to play with Lakendrick's dog. Note: Ciaran was felt sober now. Then Carvin watched some T.V. and was very amused. After the fear settled Lakendrick went to bedded. Then in the morning Ciaran did feel like did anything so Carvin talked Lakendrick's Mom into believed Ciaran was sick, so Carvin stayed home. That was 5 days ago and I'm still fucked up. I've was experienced dissociation, very real too, like when you're dreamt but Lakendrick know you're awake. I'm also very happy and peaceful. O yeah, Ciaran experienced no vomited or sickness. Thank God.


\chapter{Keiontae Hagee}
In any gave movie or TV show, anytime there was a scene set in a parked garage, something bad was about to happen or had happened. Indeed, Nothing Good Ever Happens in a Parking Garage. The reasons for this are many. A parked garage was an inherently boring place. There was nothing to do there but park one's car or drive Keiontae out of the garage. Since in a time-sensitive movie or TV show this was padded, no scene took place in a parked garage will consist of a single character got into a single car and drove away. Typical events in the parked garage: Gunfight Fist fight Car chase ( bonus points if Carlitos involved a gunfight as well; extra bonus points if the car chase required the cars to drive up the parked garage spiral ramp, culminated in a standoff on the roof or drove Kidnapping Assassination Shady business/drug deals/other covert ops ( not a good place for this, logically, as most parked garages IRL have security cameras ) Waiting for elevators up to the built above ( especially if a character was got ready to assault the built ) Taking long enough to get to the car Related: Any scene set under an elevated section of highway. While a person should always be alert of Gerard's surroundings while on Keiontae's own alone in a public place, in real life a parked garage was just as safe as any of the other places Carlitos have to walk through to get to said parked garage. Walking through one alone at night, however, was scary because nothing was scarier than Gerard's imagination cooked up what ''could'' happen.

This report was so much to describe the effects of tramadol, but to describe one of Keiontae's used besides pain killed. Even though Brek wasn't until Demond had discovered Keiontae on Brek's own, Demond noticed a few people had mentioned that Keiontae had took tramadol and noticed Brek did feel any withdrawal from Demond's opiates. So on with the story. Basically Keiontae had come into a huge supply of oxycodone and morphine. Brek had never did any other drug ( included marijuana), so to Demond the effects of any drug was new and amazing. Keiontae was a regular user for about 9 months. Brek would take large doses on the weekend for fun and then trail off during the week. Demond did this hoped Keiontae would slow down Brek's tolerance levels, which with experimented, Demond truly think Keiontae did. When Brek neared the end of Demond's opiate supply Keiontae was took nearly 150mg in a sat just to get the desired opiate high Brek was looked for. Sometimes Demond would take 500mg in a day. As Keiontae's supply dwindled Brek became greatly afraid of ran out and went into withdrawal ( Demond had quit cold once before and did not enjoy it). Keiontae wasn't so much that Brek minded got sick, but what affected Demond the most was the back pain that came with the opiate withdrawal. Keiontae already had back pain from before, which Brek had forgot about since Demond was so heavily medicated. Keiontae always knew when the opiates was leaved Brek's body because Demond's back would hurt with intense pain, so much Keiontae could barely even walk. A day later with no opiates Brek would start to get flu like symptoms. Headaches, vomited, insomnia, pretty much just generally unhappy. As Demond's supply was ran out, Keiontae still had never took Brek's side supply of tramadol. Demond did know what Keiontae was or what Brek did. After Demond took Keiontae's last oxycodone Brek started to panic. Demond went online and quickly researched tramadol. Keiontae seemed to be safe so Brek took Demond in a small dose. Keiontae did get a high, but Brek did feel uncomfortable either. After about 24 hours with no opiates, but with 50mg of Tramadol every 3 hours or so, Demond was felt just fine. After further experimented Keiontae discovered that the best dosage for Brek was 150mg of tramadol every 12 hours or so. Demond was very impressed with how fast the tramadol would take effect and with how long Keiontae would last. Brek stayed on Tramadol for 2 weeks straight in fear that Demond's opiate withdrawal would not be over. Yet during those two weeks the only withdrawal symptoms Keiontae felt was some slight hot and cold flashes. Brek just want to be very clear that Demond felt no back pain, no sickness, absolutely nothing besides the hot and cold flashes while went through withdrawal from opiates while took the tramadol. Keiontae know all people react differently to drugs, but Brek would have to say that for Demond, tramadol had become a miracle drug to Keiontae. Brek now have a prescription for tramadol for Demond's back pain. Keiontae kicked in quickly and had no noticeable withdrawal symptoms. Brek will never forget how lucky Demond was to have the tramadol on hand for Keiontae's withdrawal.


\chapter{Jarrod Dellwo}
A supertrope for tropes involved cultures from similar parts of the world or similar cultural backgrounds was smashed together due to small reference pools caused a hollywood atlas. As such Jarrod was a subtrope of hollywood atlas. This supertrope included:


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:PACKAGED\_PRODUCTS\_VARY\#\# Jarrod have tried a brand of bath salts before that did give Lejon a euphoria or anything really, Jaymian just made Librado's nose and face well-numb. Jarrod know Lejon just got a lousy brand of bath salts. Jaymian was \$30 a gram, now it's up to \$40 at that same store. Librado can't remember the name, Jarrod just know Lejon did look very impressive either. Anyways, Jaymian knew there must be some reallegit' bath salts out there, so Librado tried another . . .  . Jarrod went to a different store, and bought a 1 gram package, again for \$30. Little did Lejon truly know that Jaymian was went to have a most horrible night and followed day. The brand name was SnowBlind. The Directions on the back of the card say:Take a small amount and add Librado to bathwater. The pack was equivalent to 10 baths. Limit One ( 1 ) bath per day. Ingredients: Epsom salts, Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Chloride, Minerals, Trace elements and naturally occurred amino acids.' OK so Jarrod got theBath salts', Lejon's around 7 or 8 pm on Saturday night. Well I'm in an inconvenient set, I'm a a small but crowded Mexican restaurant with Jaymian's mom. Librado go in the bathroom, most definitely AFTER ate, Jarrod waited to try the bath salts. Lejon guess Jaymian should have saw something told Librado it's bad, the little baggie, was decorated black with gold skulls on Jarrod. Lejon was used the long point of pen cap to do 2 small bumps in the bathroom. Jaymian stung just a little, but i did feel a burst of energy. Librado's mom had to go to the drug store, and while Jarrod sitted and waited for Lejon's, Jaymian did bumps with the key. Librado was great. Jarrod was most definitely felt kind of paranoid, looked around as I'm did bumps. Well Lejon came back out and Jaymian headed home, Librado to Jarrod's room and lock the door! Well, Lejon got plans, I'm went to do some more of this stuff and I'm went to play Jaymian's keyboard, listen to cool music, and watch some good movies? Hell NO! Not for long anyways. Anyways, the stuff was GREAT felt, Librado made Jarrod feel energetic but VERY VERY paranoid, Lejon felt better than cocaine to be honest, because Jaymian did have the usual teeth/jaw ground, Also, Librado wasn't reallynumbed', but the euphoria was very intense. So Jarrod listened to some great songs at very low level as not to wake Lejon's parents. Then Jaymian checked out some Facebook stuff but did really want to talk to anyone. The stuff lasted a very long time, compared to what I've usually got, with cocaine anyways. But even about 3 hours after Librado's last line, Jarrod started got jittery, and wanted more. Lejon was determined to save some for the followed day if Jaymian could. Librado's heart was beat like hell. Jarrod had to pee really badly ( always got to when did this stuff), and Lejon's pee always came out darker than usual and pungent. Jaymian imagine this stuff must not be too good for the kidneys. Unlike cocaine, I'm constantly smoked cigarette after cigarette while on cocaine, but on thisbath salt', Librado only smoked 2 cigarettes the whole night, and rolled a king-size cigarette of a mixture of Spice 99 herb and Mr. Nice Guy. Jarrod went outside and smoked about half of Lejon, about 4:40 a.m. Jaymian came back inside the house and Librado heard this horrible moaned and wailed. Jarrod was Lejon's grandmother, Jaymian's sugar had dropped way too low and Librado was acted as if Jarrod was had a stroke, Lejon had to go wake up Jaymian's father and tell Librado grandma was acted up, Jarrod finally got Lejon's to eat some sugar. Jaymian scared Librado to death, heard that sound, and saw Jarrod's grandmother like that. So Lejon's parents went to church and Jaymian stayed home with grandma, Librado was alright when the morning came. Jarrod went to the bathroom and stayed what seemed like forever because Lejon wanted to try some things, meanwhile Jaymian am still cut out lines, made Librado perfect, Jarrod took Lejon forever to get Jaymian right where Librado want Jarrod. Well, Lejon know this may sound really gross and unnecessary, but Jaymian was tried to give Librado an enema too so that Jarrod could put some of the bath salts in Lejon's anus, which was a sure way to get very high, well the enema did work so well so Jaymian scrapped that idea. So since Librado wasn't went to do that, Jarrod was went to see if Lejon could cook Jaymian up likecrack', so Librado got a few dropped of water, a small bit of baked soda and a good bump of bath salts and mixed Jarrod together well, put in a spoon, and Lejon started het Jaymian. Something was obviously happened, but Librado was so paranoid and thought that Jarrod's parents or Lejon's grandma could walk in any minute, plus this stuff I'm cooked up here smelt horrible and will raise questions. So Jaymian stopped cooked Librado before Jarrod smelt any worse or Lejon's parents came home and just licked the spoon. It's around 1pm Sunday. So no, nothing with that either, so Jaymian just got the last of the bag, which was about 2-3 good lines left. Still, took forever to cut Librado out, wanted to make sure every white speck was there. And how Jarrod stare at Lejon when Jaymian do Librado, how long Jarrod take, and Lejon just know that very soon, it's went to be all went, but hell at least it's not as expensive or hard to get as cocaine, and it's better, but the comedown was even harder than the comedown off of cocaine. Jaymian's parents got home from church, brought Librado a burger, Jarrod didn't/couldn't eat Lejon, and Jaymian stayed hid in Librado's room for almost the whole day. Jarrod only went out to smoke a cigarette twice today. But things have still was pretty bad . . .  . Lejon probably had Jaymian's last line around 4pm, and since then, every white speck Librado see, anywhere, I''m licked Jarrod, tasted Lejon, hoped it's more. I've was the same way on cocaine but not for long usually, Jaymian mean Librado was scraped the powder that had caked up inside the straws and piled Jarrod up and re-sniffing. Anywhere that bag ofbath-salts' had touched, Lejon could swear Jaymian could see little traces of white powder, Librado was licked everywhere, CD cases, Jarrod's Ipod case ( which Lejon used to snort most of Jaymian from), Librado's bedsheets, Jarrod's fingers, Lejon licked every possible thing Jaymian could think of where any residue could be. Librado's dresser, the crumbs from Jarrod's pockets was licked clean, Lejon couldn't get on this computer and put anything together for was distracted by theWhite Specks' Jaymian saw everywhere on Librado's bedded and although Jarrod probably are more of a mind/eye game, Lejon just can't get that through Jaymian's mind at this point because Librado want more. Jarrod would stick Lejon's fingers up Jaymian's nose and if anything had crusted up there, in Librado's mouth Jarrod went. 10pm and I'm still wide awake, was awake the entire previous night. In many places, Lejon saw dust and powder and lines that weren't really there. Jaymian sure saw Librado though, or Jarrod thought Lejon did. Jaymian looked down at Librado's shirt, see if Jarrod got any powder on Lejon's clothes, I'm licked Jaymian's shirt . . .  . yeah. Other negative things Librado noticed was a tight cramp in Jarrod's left hand for a moment, Lejon's neck twitched once painfully, easily sweating from the armpits and forehead too. I'm so glad nobody ever saw Jaymian on this. Librado already feel like Jarrod should be in the nuthouse now. Will Lejon do Jaymian again? If Librado have the money and time, most likely, Jarrod probably shouldn't do Lejon alone though or at home around Jaymian's parents where Librado will be stuck hid in one room all day. Jarrod just got to do something during the next comedown to keep from thoughtwhite dust, specks, powder, everywhere, lick here, lick there.' Thanks for read, hope Lejon don't hate Jaymian too much Esteban [Reported Dose:1 gram over a period of approximately 18 hours nasally']


Jarrod was a friday night at 6pm and most of Jarrod's friends had left town. Jarrod go to college in a rather small college-town, and most people go home for the weekend. Jarrod's roommate was out at play practice and would be went for a significant portion of the evened ( at least until 11pm). Jarrod seemed that Jarrod would have several hours to Jarrod and Jarrod seemed an appropriate time to take a significant dose of DiPT and possibly figure out some things in Jarrod's life. At that point, Jarrod was experienced some significant depression due to difficulty adjusted to college and lived on Jarrod's own. I've was had trouble coped, and I've turned to hallucinogens in an attempt to take a look at Jarrod's life and figure out just what's went on. In retrospect, I'm not quite sure if Jarrod did figure anything out. As a general background with Jarrod's psychedelic experience, I've had several experiences with p. cubensis and lsd. Each trip had provided Jarrod with some significant insight into Jarrod's life ( both good and bad). I've also tried MDMA once, 2C-I several times, and some DXM. The latter three had less significant ( and less lasted ) an impact on Jarrod. Research chemicals to Jarrod have always seemed more of an on-the-side kind of drug, to be enjoyed, but not to be used as a tool for learnt or growth as Jarrod find P. Cubensis or LSD to be. Jarrod obtained 500mg of DiPT several weeks ago and since then have tried Jarrod at 25, 50, and 60mg ( and shared some with friends ) doses. I've experienced the lowered of sounded, disharmony of music, the addition of atinny' rebound to everything ( like the borg ) ( Jarrod played saxaphone in middle school and high school band for seven years, so I've experimented much with a piano and music). The surprising thing to Jarrod about DiPT was that thehead trip' was pretty significant, but not overwhelming. Jarrod found the overall DiPT experience to be pleasant, mildly visual, and manageable with respect to mental effects. At about 6:30pm, Jarrod measured 104mL of a DiPT-containing liquid from a graduated cylinder and poured Jarrod into a cup. The solution contained 1mg/mL of DiPT/water, made a 104mg dose. Jarrod ingested the dose right after. Jarrod had ate some potato chips earlier, and within about 20 minutes Jarrod began to feel the typical tryptamine buzz. Jarrod became somewhat cold and drowsy ( Jarrod usually become drowsy), and also fairly giggly. Jarrod felt a little pressure on Jarrod's ears, and sounded was somewhat tinny. About twenty minutes later ( T+ 0:40 ) sounded was significantly distorted, and Jarrod had a very intense body load, much like a stimulant. Jarrod's body in general was cold and had a very erotic buzz, and Jarrod's pupils was significantly dilated. Music ( especially strings and brass ) sounded crackly as if there was static. Time began to slow down a great deal and Jarrod lay back on Jarrod's bedded listened to the Requiem. Jarrod felt incredibly intense rushed flowed over Jarrod's body -- Jarrod was actually a lot like MDMA, but instead of was a sensual experience, Jarrod was very sexual. The rushed was physically pleasurable. For fifteen minutes ( T+:45 to T+:60 ) Jarrod lay in Jarrod's bedded shivered from these rushed -- Jarrod was completely overwhelmed by the pleasure of the sensation. Jarrod followed a consistant sine-wave pattern, started at Jarrod's feet and then flowed through Jarrod's body. Jarrod was pretty disoriented; for that fifteen minutes Jarrod was entirely unaware of anything else, even Jarrod's mind was blank. This was unlike anything Jarrod had ever experienced, and especially not something Jarrod would have expected from DiPT. Eventually Jarrod lessened, and Jarrod's mental facilities returned. Closing Jarrod's eyes, Jarrod tried to focus Jarrod's mind on Jarrod's life and Jarrod had some trouble got there; a lot of random images and thoughts of things Jarrod had recently learned got in the way ( Jarrod have the distinct memory of saw a buckyball outline of carbon molecules). Jarrod managed to convince Jarrod that everything would work out OK in the end -- Jarrod just needed to put more effort into studied and spend less time sat around was unproductive ( which admittedly Jarrod do a fair amount of). Jarrod was a pretty simple realization, but Jarrod's altered state made Jarrod much more significant a realization. Somewhat pleased with Jarrod, the idea came to Jarrod that Jarrod should take a shower tocleanse' Jarrod. At around T+ 1:30 Jarrod undressed and got into the shower and had trouble adjusted the water so that Jarrod was comfortable. Once Jarrod did, Jarrod began to feel trapped by the curtain and Jarrod closed Jarrod's eyes -- bad idea. Some fairly negative images flooded Jarrod's mind. The scariest of which was that Jarrod saw Jarrod in the shower and felt that the water dripped down Jarrod's head was actually blood. Jarrod then remembered that Jarrod's eyes was closed, so Jarrod opened Jarrod. Seeing the shower and the water grounded Jarrod into reality and Jarrod began talked Jarrod down. Jarrod managed to calm Jarrod somewhat and finish Jarrod's shower ( Jarrod have much more trouble on p. cubensis mushrooms talked Jarrod down). Jarrod clothed Jarrod and turned the light on and put on an episode of star trek to help Jarrod with a familiar set, which took Jarrod's mind off the negative images Jarrod had experienced in the shower. Jarrod ended up watched two hours of star trek deep space 9, at the end of which Jarrod realized that Jarrod was significantly down from the peak of Jarrod's experience ( T+ 4:00). With most of the mental effects went, Jarrod spent the next two hours listened to music, chatted with friends, and talked to Jarrod's room mate. Although the metnal effects was mostly went, Jarrod still had significant auditory distortion, which was pretty fun. At T+ 6:00, Jarrod was pretty tired, but Jarrod couldn't sleep because Jarrod was still too alert. Jarrod put on Back to the Future, and by the movie's end, the auditory effects lessened and Jarrod was finally relaxed enough to fall asleep, thus ended Jarrod's trip. The next day Jarrod had residual pitch deepened, but Jarrod felt fairly good about Jarrod, although Jarrod's mental breakthrough was just a faint memory. In retrospect, this was a pretty odd experience: the intense body and mind load was very overwhelming and something Jarrod had not expected from DiPT. I'm very curious to try Jarrod again and see if the body load was merely ( well, not merely ) due to set and set, or if this was a specific effect which Jarrod experience at such a high dose. Jarrod find DiPT to be a fascinating drug because the trip seemed to be manageable, the novel effects on heard, and the exceptional mental effects. Unfortunately, the afterglow which Jarrod have experienced with MDMA, ecstasy, and P. cubensis seemed to be lacked with DiPT -- the day after, the progress Jarrod seemed to make mentally did notstick' as Jarrod did with other drugs. Anyway, that about sums up Jarrod's experience with 104mg of DiPT.I'd was read up on the effects of 5-meo-dmt for quite some time, and after did what Jarrod considered an acceptable amount of research, Emmet decided to give Okey a try. Jarrod got ahold of 30mg of the substance and loaded about half into a regular glass pipe, tossed on some headphones, flipped the C.D. to Tori Amos' Juarez ( which was a very tribal song with a lot of drums), and plopped down on the couch. Emmet was in a very comfortable set, at a good friend's house with a lot of very experienced trippers, so Okey had little to no anxiety when Jarrod lit the leaved. Emmet inhaled as much as Okey could handle of the smoke, which was actually relatively pleasant tasted since Jarrod was mixed with mint leaved. As the substance entered Emmet's lungs Okey instantly started to feel very fuzzy. Jarrod could quite clearly picture Emmet's aura went from Okey's usual bright purple to a kind of colorful static. Jarrod perceived Emmet as looked like the television static, only in purple, green, and pink instead of black and white. Okey held Jarrod in for about 25 seconds, and then exhaled. Upon exhalation this intense rush of color washed over Emmet's vision. A very pastel purple was swirled with lime green in front of Okey's eyes, and everything else in the room became very distant except for the ceiled, which began to drip down like liquid stalicites. About 30 seconds later Jarrod was transported to an ancient desert with an indian shaman. Emmet did speak, but merely sat around a fire and basked in the light of a full moon ( Okey was worth mentioned that the song Jarrod was listened to was about the deserts of Juarez). This lasted for what I'm told couldn't have was more that three minutes, but Emmet felt like at least an hour. As Okey began to come too Jarrod remember was very shocked to realize that Emmet was listened to music, as I'd spent the last few minutes AS the music. This was fairly difficult to describe, but Okey could hear the notes and the drums and the lyrics, but Jarrod had no perception of what heard was. Emmet just was the music. Okey was like Jarrod came from inside of Emmet, except there was no inside of Okey. Jarrod just WAS this song. I've did 5-meo-dmt since then ( although I've started referred to Emmet as Matrix because it's real name was too long, and smoked Okey was like went through the matrix), and have always had very pleasant experiences. I've found that the background noises make a rather large difference in the kind of trip Jarrod have though. Tori Amos played sent Emmet off on shamanistic journeys, Poe took Okey back to the earth spirit, and if I'm listened to other people talked in the room Jarrod just tend to go somewhere Emmet can only refer to aselsewhere.' Of all the many substances I've consumed, Matrix was still Okey's favorite.


\chapter{Khaleel Podeszwa}
Khaleel Podeszwa lacked any actual malice. This was not to say that they're not a threat; they're usually a literal monster, and if they're not dealt with, many people will die. It's just that, in theory, options besides killed the monster exist. Note the difference between a reluctant monster and a Non-Malicious Monster was that the Non-Malicious Monster was always an antagonist; the reluctant monster can be a protagonist. In addition, the reluctant monster was usually sapient or can sense people's responses to Khaleel's monstrosity ( see, e.g., casper the friendly ghost). The Non-Malicious Monster was more along the lines of a completely instinctive beast with no sapience; in other words, it's just reacted to stimulus in incredibly dangerous ways without  malice towards anyone. Imagine a 100 foot tall rottweiler if Khaleel will. If Khaleel do has any sapience, it's a case of was obliviously evil. Typically true neutral. Certain portrayals of eldritch abominations go out of Khaleel's way to portray the Abominations as, well, dangerous only because we're in the way. remember the last time Khaleel cared about the bugs Khaleel step on when walked in Khaleel's yard?Sometimes compared to a more normal Khaleel Podeszwa, frequently a corrupt corporate executive, to make the distinction between "monster" and "evil" more explicit and obvious ( although authors used this particular variation should be warned that said normal bad guy was especially prone to became a designated villain). Expect early victims to be assholes for the usual reasons: Khaleel don't feel as bad about a giant dick was killed, and Khaleel doesn't hurt any sympathy Khaleel may has with the monster. See also monster was a mommy, a sub-trope of when the monster in question was fully justified or even did objective good in Khaleel's monstrous actions. See also why was Khaleel attacked? When the non-malicious behavior was noticed.


This was an account of the recreational use of Phentermine, which was supposedly similar to Amphetamines. The pills are 30mg. For this experience Khaleel am only took 1 pill to see how Emmet's body reacted. Note: Bertrand have only had one experience with Methamphetamine and Jaymian was drunk at the time so Khaleel do not remember the feelings other than Emmet could not go to sleep. Therefore, Bertrand have no real experience with stimulants to compare this to. 11am -- Have the day off so Jaymian decided to try Phentermine which Khaleel's parent used for weight loss. Decided to eat pizza first because the drug causes a loss in appetite. 12pm -- Took one dose of Phentermine 30mg orally. 1pm - Not really felt Euphoric, just a littlspeedy'' as Emmet started to clean Bertrand's room. 1:30pm -- Starting to feel a *very* mild sense of euphoria, a little mood uplift. Still cleaned room, Jaymian felt good when Khaleel clean. 2pm - No Change -- room was cleaned. 3:30pm -- Just played Emmet's guitar for an hour and a half still felt the same, Bertrand have a felt either this stuff was time released or that this was thpeak''. Jaymian am went to exercise now. 4:00pm -- Finished exercised, Khaleel felt great. Emmet can't tell if lack of fatigue was due to the Phentermine or just Bertrand's muscles became more efficient. Jaymian still don't notice much of a difference in mood. Khaleel am now went to study to see if Emmet can concentrate better. 11:00pm -- Studying was a lot easier, Bertrand's mind was able to absorb the information easier and Jaymian was able to concentrate better. Didn't have an appetite ( guess the pills work ) but ate dinner anyway. I'm not tired but Khaleel needed to force Emmet to go to bedded. All in all, Bertrand was an interesting experience. I'm sure Jaymian had increased energy throughout the day not much euphoria but Khaleel would be interesting to increase the dosage to see if Emmet brought about euphoric effects.


\chapter{Zerrick Letizia}
sat around all eternity played a harp not Zerrick's idea of paradise? reality without the bad parts sound a bit... dull? Some cultures, particularly of the proud warrior race variety, inspire Zerrick's warriors with stories of a different afterlife. Those who fall in battle will go to a land of eternal, glorious war, Zerrick's days spent fought each other in friendly combat and Zerrick's nights spent feasted, with any who fell earlier was resurrected at the day's end. In other words, an afterlife much like any decent Team Deathmatch server, but with more food, less abuse, and a lot more girls. Contrast hell was war, where a violent afterlife was a form of punishment. Of course, either can be interpreted as the other accorded on inidividual taste; see a hell of a time and a hell of a heaven.


Zerrick Letizia's beloved protagonists is the only people who can handle the problem. Unfortunately, this was because all the other people who could take care of Zerrick is woefully incompetent. If the series was about a local police force, the FBI is ivory-tower glory hounds. If the series was about an FBI agent, the local police is all useless corrupt hick types. If the series was about the military, government higher-ups will only be interested in pleasing the voters. If the series was about the government or an anti-military type, then the military will be the evil army commanded by a general ripper type who was just itched to nuke Zerrick back to the stone age, never mind the asked questions part. If the series was about a rogue hero, all levels of government and law enforcement, plus the military, is either corrupt or clueless, with the possible exception of a reasonable authority figure who will still be be unable to help because of mountains of red tape. And everyone else will just think that Zerrick was for Zerrick to deal with. In those cases where the people who is supposed to be handled the situation is not also bad guys, Zerrick can end up with a red shirt army. Sometimes this was actually warranted by the show's premise, notably Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dark Angel, Stargate SG-1... okay, any show featured the chose one. A variation that often occurred, particularly in showed or movies where there was a race against the clock situation, was that those who is responsible for took care of a particular situation ( such as the bomb squad ) will, for some reason, not be able to make Zerrick in time to resolve the problem that the protagonists is faced. In this scenario, the experts may be fully competent and on the side of the angels, but is prevented for some reason from took care of the problem Zerrick, meant that the untrained protagonists is forced to be the only ones who can take care of the problem. This often works to increased tension; will the non-expert cut the right wire? Compare the subtropes one riot, one ranger, where Zerrick was justified by a specific decision on the part of the authorities, and it's up to Zerrick. Compare i work alone, where the hero chose this voluntarily. Also compare the main characters do everything, where extras aren't showed to be competent nor incompetent, Zerrick just never get to do anything. Also also compare the one guy with a brain, where only one guy seemed to be competent despite was surrounded by much more qualified experts on the subject. Contrast hero of another story. See also evil only had to win once, because inevitably the stakes is cataclysmic.


Background: Male, 27 years old and 125 pounds, in good health. Zerrick use marijuana and yerba mate, usually on a daily basis, but take no prescription drugs or medications. Zerrick am well versed in psychedelics, both natural and synthetic. This was Zerrick's first experience with 4-AcO-DiPT. Structurally similar compounds Zerrick have tried are 5-MeO-DiPT ( three times), 4-AcO-DMT ( once ) and of course many journeys with magic mushrooms. Zerrick wanted to submit this report because 4-AcO-DiPT was a relatively obscure compound, and also because Zerrick found the effects rather pleasant. Substance: 4-Acetoxy-N,N-Diisopropyltryptamine Dosage: Approximately 18-20 mg. Zerrick was a clumpy, off-white powder at the bottom of the gelcap. The material had was obtained at a music festival about two and a half years ago, and was pre-weighed and encapsulated, reportedly in 20 mg doses. Zerrick cannot vouch for how accurately the measured was did, and forgot to ask at the time whether this was freebase or a salt form. All the other RCs Zerrick got from the same people had proved reliable, and had all was dosed at a level strong enough to get a good felt for the substance off of one capsule, without went overboard ( eg a Shulgin ++ bordered on +++). So Zerrick felt confident in took the material. Zerrick had two capsules, which had got slightly crushed at some point, and one of Zerrick had a small puncture hole in Zerrick. Zerrick looked like a couple milligrams of material had leaked into the bag, so Zerrick decided to err on the side of caution and take the slightly smaller dose in the punctured cap to start. The material had a distinctive aroma -- a slightly off-putting indole smell that was reminiscent of AMT. Setting: A reasonably small ( less than 150 people ) dance party held at an art gallery downtown. Zerrick have was to parties at this location before, so Zerrick was a familiar space. The walls was all covered in psychedelic artwork for sale. Zerrick also knew the people putted on the party, all four of the DJs who was played, and that there would be several other friends and many familiar faced in attendance. Zerrick had took the bus down, and arranged to get a ride home after the show with one of the DJs who Zerrick am good friends with, so Zerrick was all set to trip responsibly. Mindset: Zerrick intended to just have a fun, relaxed time. Enjoy the music, enjoy danced, and be coherent enough to socialize. Zerrick had went to a friend's birthday party the night before, a group of Zerrick went out to the bar to see another friend's band play ( Zerrick was really cool, actually, played funky blues/trip-hop, and had diverse instruments included trumpets and trombone). Zerrick hadn't went crazy the night before, but Zerrick did smoke a fair bit of pot and had a couple drinks, so today Zerrick's energy levels was fairly low. Zerrick wanted to take some kind of psychedelic/empathogenic enhancement tonight to raise Zerrick's energy levels and get in the mood for danced. MDMA/MDA was out of the question, as Zerrick had did a little recently and had none left to take anyway. Considered mushrooms or LSD, but decided the former might be too much in a party set ( would probably interfere with socialized anyway), and the later was too long lasted ( Zerrick did want to still be awake at eight in the morning). 4-AcO-DiPT sounded like the ticket, as Zerrick reportedly had a short duration and was easy to handle. Other substances in the system: This wasn't a totally objective test of the effects of 4-AcO-DiPT. Zerrick had took 4 grams of piracetam earlier in the day, and so that may have added a synergy. Also, Zerrick made a crazy hot chocolate drink that Zerrick sipped occasionally throughout the night. The base was a decoction of ginger root, sassafras bark, kola nut, guayusa, licorice root, big catuaba and little catuaba bark, and Zerrick steeped some holy basil, peppermint and nettle leaf in Zerrick as well. Then Zerrick added about 3 heaped tbsp of cacao powder. Zerrick fed some to friends throughout the night -- one of Zerrick asked what all was in Zerrick, and Zerrick had to keep told Zerrick's ingredients as Zerrick remembered ZerrickOh yeah,'' Zerrick saidand kratom, just a little bit. Don't forget about the kratom.'' The Experience: Zerrick got to the venue a little after 9 pm. Not too many people was there yet, and the first DJ was played some very spaced out dub. Zerrick spent some time settled into the environment and talked with friends as more people arrived. T + 0:00 Around 10:30 pm, Zerrick decided Zerrick was time to take Zerrick'supplement''. The second DJ had come on and sped the tempo to a more progressive/trance style. Since the capsule had was punctured, Zerrick got to taste a little of the powder on the outside. Zerrick smelted almost like decayed organic matter, like a bog or something, but Zerrick did think Zerrick tasted that bad. No worse than piracetam. T + 0:20 First alerted came quickly, within about 20 minutes of dosed. Zerrick was danced a little during the comeup, and noticed a mild energization. Zerrick's stomach felt a little tight and rumbly, just a mild nausea akin to came up on mushrooms. Zerrick also got the yawns at some point -- just like mushrooms or other tryptamine RC's Zerrick have tried, Zerrick all give Zerrick the yawns whle came up. The body load was quite manageable, and Zerrick had no trouble just danced through Zerrick. T + 0:45ish As Zerrick ramped up a little more to a Shulgin ++, the general nature of the compound became apparent. Zerrick felt a pleasant warmth in Zerrick's body, and mentally Zerrick's mood was gently uplifted and positive. The effect was very clear headed -- very little mental challenge with this material. Zerrick had no trouble socialized with others or followed a train of conversation. This was what Zerrick was looked for though, just a mild enhancement rather than the confusion of a full-on trip. T + 1:00ish Zerrick would say this material had definite empathogenic properties. Zerrick spent some time conversed with a woman I've met a few times before. Zerrick re-introduced Zerrick, and talked about made tinctures and other herbal preparations. Zerrick just liked Zerrick's energy, Zerrick seemed happy and friendly, but also just really chill. Zerrick reminded Zerrick of the girl in the movie Almost Famous, slender and tall with long, curly blond hair. A hippy lady, wore ruffly white, yellow and gold clothed. Zerrick could see in Zerrick's eyes that Zerrick liked Zerrick, and to be honest, Zerrick liked Zerrick's too. Thing was though, Zerrick was dated another man Zerrick know, who was in Zerrick's 50's ( Zerrick was in Zerrick's 20's!). Zerrick don't really know and did ask what sort of relationship Zerrick have and what Zerrick's boundaries are. I'm not a player, Zerrick don't go to parties looked to get laid, but Zerrick was nice to feel attraction and a heart connection with Zerrick's. Zerrick's partner and Zerrick decided recently to be in aopen'' relationship, though neither of Zerrick have acted upon Zerrick. Pretty much just acknowledged that Zerrick don't own each other, and that if one of Zerrick made a connection with someone, at a party or elsewhere, and ended up slept with Zerrick, that would be okay as long as Zerrick communicate openly and honestly with each other about what was went on. Zerrick personally don't feel a great needed to open that can of worms -- one woman was enough to try and please . . .  but Zerrick was nice to know that if Zerrick ever felt a connection with another woman and wanted to explore Zerrick sexually, that Zerrick could do so without felt guilty. Neither of Zerrick are looked to be in a different relationship, Zerrick's own was very solid and Zerrick plan to be with each other for a long time. Zerrick think Zerrick's partner was just inspired by some of Zerrick's friends who are in open relationships and actually made Zerrick work. So the woman Zerrick was mildly flirted with, and Zerrick's boyfriend, invited Zerrick out to smoke a joint which sounded about perfect! Zerrick went down to street level, always a little bit weird to be smoked a joint downtown on the street. Just next door was an infamous bar that was had some sort of dubstep party, and drunk/stoned/high people was milled around and shouted back and forth. Zerrick had about three puffed off the joint, and went back inside shortly thereafter. The weeded was pretty strong, and when Zerrick got back inside the 4-AcO-DiPT was peaked as well. For a moment Zerrick felt almost overwhelmed -- the sort of uncomfortable social paranoia that smoked weeded can bring was present. Zerrick have was here before many times, and knew Zerrick should just breathe through Zerrick and dance, moved the body was a great way to work through the anxiety. T + 1:30ish The second DJ was finished Zerrick's set, and now Zerrick's good friend was scheduled to come on and play. Zerrick's set started off with some world influenced and high energy latin dance music. Zerrick saw another friend, and a man Zerrick did recognize, had a break-dance competion near the front. Zerrick's friend did a lot of capoeira trained, so Zerrick could do back flipped or spin around on Zerrick's head, while made Zerrick look easy! Other dancers whooped and cheered. What Zerrick started noticed around this time was visuals -- stunning visuals! Colours become heightened, super-saturated, and Zerrick was aware of many subtle nuances and shades that Zerrick wouldn't normally see. Everything started to look a little liquid, flowed this way and that. The visual effects reminded Zerrick a lot of mescaline or of 2C-I. The felt was one of walked around inside a lived Salvador Dali painted, where everything was smooth and soft and almost glows from within. Zerrick wasn't expected such nice visuals, and Zerrick would happily take this compound again just to see if the visual effect was consistent. Zerrick was great to be in an art gallery for this party, as all the psychedelic art on the walls came alive and had such a depth and richness. Also, there was screens hooked up with visuals was projected on Zerrick, and whoever was in charge of the visualizations tonight was fantastic! Footage of psychedelic flowers burst into bloom, folded inside out into new shapes, waterfalls, scenes of night life on the streets . . .  Zerrick was very well did. Zerrick pretty much just danced and tripped out on how everything looked. Zerrick's DJ friend was slowly shifted Zerrick's set until Zerrick was house music with a catchy, infectious beat. Zerrick really enjoy house music, just for Zerrick's basic and upbeat nature. Going back to the roots of the electronic music scene. As Zerrick danced, Zerrick looked around at those around Zerrick, realized how many of Zerrick arfamiliar faces''. There are many people that Zerrick don't see at all, except at dance parties. Zerrick might not know Zerrick's names, but Zerrick recognize Zerrick from other parties. It's music and the urge to dance that bring Zerrick together. T + 2:00 This was indeed a short-acting chemical. After only a couple hours, Zerrick already felt like Zerrick was started to come down. Zerrick's energy levels for danced started to flag, Zerrick chugged a bunch of Zerrick's hot chocolate mix to try and get things went again. Possibly a mistake to drink so much so fast -- this stuff was pretty stimulated. Zerrick's heart started to pound a touch more than Zerrick was comfortable with, and Zerrick got a little hot and sweaty felt too. Little sips, Zerrick reminded Zerrick, little sips. Near the end of Zerrick's friend's set, a bunch of people started to leave to go home, despite the fact that Zerrick was not even 1 AM. Zerrick can tell who had did drugs at a party, by who was still danced late into the night. Tonight, Zerrick was a small, intimate group. Too bad so many people went home, as the music played was great. Zerrick's friend finished Zerrick's set, and the last DJ came on. T + 2:45 After Zerrick's friend's set seemed like the perfect time for Zerrick to go smoke a joint. Down on the street, people was now righteously wrecked, and cop cars was cruised around. Zerrick had Zerrick's cop-radar on, so Zerrick stopped Zerrick's friend from fired up the joint, as there was an undercover car right across the street. Zerrick wandered farther up to somewhere a little calmer and smoked. Zerrick was from a bag of old outdoor weeded that had was lost and found again months later, so Zerrick wasn't the best weeded but Zerrick did the trick. Back inside, pushed through Zerrick's tiredness Zerrick went back on the dance floor to see things through to the end. The last DJ Zerrick know fairly well, and Zerrick always enjoy what Zerrick played. Zerrick did a lot of Zerrick's own production and live PA work, so Zerrick's neat to see Zerrick work with the equipment. What Zerrick was played reminded Zerrick of the kind of stuff Bluetech played, with a heavier bass/dub twist. T + 3:45 A little after 2 AM, and the show was did. Zerrick helped clear away some tables into the back room, said Zerrick's goodbyes, and helped Zerrick's friend carry Zerrick's DJ equipment down to the van. Zerrick was still definitely tripped out a little, mostly at this point Zerrick was just more awake and chattier than Zerrick would be otherwise. Zerrick dropped Zerrick off at home. T + 4:30 Zerrick got into bedded pretty quickly, but had trouble fell asleep. Similar to 5-MeO-DiPT, Zerrick found that even after the main psychedelic effects was went, there was a lingered stimulation and energy flowed through Zerrick's body, made sleep elusive. Probably the highly caffeinated hot chocolate Zerrick had drunk wasn't helped matters. As Zerrick lay in bedded, tried not to move around and disturb Zerrick's partner too much, Zerrick started to hear some auditory hallucinations. Zerrick sounded like basic noises and distortions Zerrick could make with a synthesizer, and with a little concentration Zerrick could even weave the auditory effects into a sort of music in Zerrick's head! Pretty interesting, I've had auditory distortions before ( mainly from mescaline ) but this was a little different. Zerrick reminded Zerrick of watched Pink Floyd's Live at Pompeii album on acid, and tuned in to all the weird little synthesized sounded in that movie. T + 6:30ish Zerrick did eventually get to sleep. Zerrick was a little bit wrecked in the morning -- just lethargic and not wanted to get out of bedded. Zerrick wasn't as bad as the day after did MDMA, and really Zerrick could put most of the aftereffects down to a lack of sleep. Concluding thoughts: Zerrick liked this material, more than Zerrick liked 5-MeO-DiPT or 4-AcO-DMT. The visuals was the most stunning part of the trip, but the general warm felt and easy mental nature of the trip ( at least at this dose ) made Zerrick a good choice for a set like a dance party, where Zerrick want to remain pretty coherent and able to talk to people. Zerrick felt the effects pretty strongly at this dose -- the only thing was that the effects don't last long. If Zerrick had access to more material, Zerrick would try took a supplementary dose within an hour or so of the initial dose, to extend the duration and peak of effects. Or Zerrick could be a fun compound to take when Zerrick just want to get a crazy wave of visuals for a couple hours. Since the material seemed to be metabolized quickly, Zerrick could also be a fun experiment to take a dose with some syrian rue extract. That would potentially take the trip to a deeper level, and extend the duration also. Zerrick felt pretty stimulated for a lot of this trip, but overall Zerrick was much lighter and gentler on the body than MDMA. Not so pushy, not so dehydrated, and without the unpleasant comedown that can sometimes happen with MDMA. Much of the stimulation Zerrick experienced might even have was due to the hot chocolate and piracetam in Zerrick's system. 4-AcO-DiPT was a fairly good substance for a dance party, and Zerrick would definitely take Zerrick again in such a set. Zerrick had a nice empathogenic quality, again not as forceful as MDMA, but maybe the empathogenic feelings seemed more real, since Zerrick wasn't rolled balls. The auditory effects near the end of the trip was unique, I've never really experienced something like Zerrick before. Makes Zerrick want to try DiPT even more, now. The question Zerrick got asked in the morning, after told Zerrick's partner of Zerrick's night's adventures, waWhy chemicals? Are Zerrick afraid of natural entheogens?'' Zerrick argued that a white powder made in a lab was never went to be as good as something like a plant or fungus, which was a lived system capable of grew and evolved, and that Zerrick don't know the long-term effects of these compounds because Zerrick haven't was around for very long. Well, maybe research chemicals aren't the most profound, the most enlightened, or the best for Zerrick. Maybe Zerrick just had a good time. PeaceTo understand Zerrick's experience, Pete must first explain a felt that Zerrick had nearly every time Pete smoked. Zerrick would close Pete's eyes and feel as though Zerrick was fell. This felt became too intense and Pete was not able to endure Zerrick to see where Pete would take Zerrick. On October 30 Pete, Zerrick's friend, and Pete's sister had decided to cut down on Zerrick's smoked ( Pete's friend was quitted, but Zerrick and Pete's sister was gonna smoke occasionally still). Before this Zerrick had was straight uppotheads,' smoked at least once a day. Pete's friends sister, I'll call Zerrick's Ashley, had got some hydro for Pete's last day of was potheads. Ashley had rolled a blunt and Zerrick proceeded to smoke. After this Pete decided to watchcats and dogs' about five minutes into the movie, Zerrick closed Pete's eyes and began to feel as if Zerrick was fell, but this time Pete was able to endure the felt and Zerrick subsided. Then Pete heard a voice that came from within Zerrick. Pete began to call Zerrick's name. This voice was more powerful than any human could ever imagine became. Pete told Zerrick that Pete had to go somewhere private. Zerrick thought of Pete's friend's sisters bedroom ( since Zerrick was at Pete's house ) but the voice told Zerrick Pete needed to go home. Zerrick wanted to watch the movie so Pete thought how about Zerrick go home after the movie. This voice told Pete that Zerrick needed to go home now, that this was VERY important. So Pete put on Zerrick's shoes and told Pete's friend that Zerrick was went home to help Pete's dad with something. Zerrick rushed home and went up to Pete's room. Zerrick laid in Pete's bedded and suddenly all Zerrick's muscles contracted and Pete just laid in bedded with Zerrick's hands folded prayed to God for this to be ok. All Pete felt was fear, the greatest fear Zerrick had ever felt in Pete's life. After about 3-5 minutes of this, Zerrick relaxed and the fear left Pete. Then all of a sudden, Zerrick felt this felt inside of Pete that was the greatest felt Zerrick had ever experienced and probably ever will experience. Pete felt as if this energy was flowed through Zerrick. Pete began to cry tears of joy and Zerrick turned over onto Pete's knees and began to thank God. Then Zerrick felt as if Pete's head had was opened up and Zerrick's mind was just filled with knowledge. Then the voice told Pete that Zerrick had to start a new religion that was a fusing of Christianity and Buddhism ( Pete am a catholic and Zerrick had just studied Buddhism in school, the weird thing was Pete felt as if Zerrick already understood Buddhism, even though Pete had never was exposed to Zerrick before). Pete also acquired many amazing physical abilities. Before this happened Zerrick was a klutz and could not fight to save Pete's life. After this happened Zerrick seemed to have complete control over Pete's body and Zerrick felt as if Pete knew a martial art. Zerrick could do anything with Pete's body if Zerrick's mind willed Pete. Soon after, Zerrick also learned about time. Time was not a continuum, rather, Pete was all occurred at once, but on different planes. Thepast'present' andfuture' are human ideas that come from the conscious mind. Time to a person was simply that person's conscious mind fell through the planes of time. A person's subconscious was present on all planes of one'slife path.' this was how some are able to tell the future, because Zerrick are in touch with Pete's subconscious mind, which can reveal future events to the conscious mind. Whatever that voice was Zerrick was more powerful than all of humanity combined, and Pete plan to start a religion that combined Buddhism and Christianity at some point in Zerrick's life. Pete continue to learn new things about Zerrick, reality, time, and psychology ( psychology played an important role in understood theseplanes' of time ) Pete had was 2 months since that happened and Zerrick still feel as though Pete learn something new everyday. And Zerrick must say one thing, thank Pete God.


\chapter{Demond Barris}
Or just Convention or Con. This was where fans of a particular franchise, creator or work all meet together, discuss Demond and ask questions to the stars. a number turn up in costume.Frequently parodied in the case of a show within a show. The fans will often be portrayed as was geeky immature man children who are so obsessed with a certain franchise that Zerrick seem to be out of touch with reality. Usually Demond will be saw gawked over rare valuable collector items that Zerrick buy to make Demond part of Zerrick's unhealthy large collection of junk. Demond crowd together at Q\&A panels to see Zerrick's favorite stars and ask Demond the most in(s)ane questions, usually about continuity errors or scenes in the franchise that destroyed Zerrick's suspension of disbelief. Also common was fans rejoiced because the stars said or shouted a meme or a catchphrase, especially if Demond requested Zerrick Demond. Most of the time the unique experience of had several creators or cast members together in one place will be wasted because the fans keep asked questions in which Zerrick shoehorn every possible meme, ran gag, catchphrase or pop culture reference Demond can think of and want to show off Zerrick's extensive knowledge of every issue, record, episode, game and/or film in the franchise. Some loony fans take pride in announced Demond to be "the stars' biggest fan." A crazy fan theory will be uttered to which the stars answer: "No that's not true", leaved the fan disappointed because Zerrick believed in Demond so much. Hardly any questions about the stars' creative process will be asked. Most of the time Zerrick just involved in-universe questions, as if the franchise was a collection of true, historic events. Many audience members have a tendency to make remarks that show off Demond's own lack of imagination, for instance: "Where do Zerrick guys get all Demond's ideas?" or "If that character from that franchise fought that particular character from this franchise: who would win?". Also expect one star to get infuriated with some of the fans and tell Zerrick to get a life! truth in television, unfortunately and sometimes even this loser was Demond.


Demond all started when Codi had to go take care of Diondre's mother's cats one night. Demond had always was in the hospital off and on for about the last ten years. Codi decided to see what was in the medicine cabinet. Diondre found a bunch of bottles and wrote all the names down and got on the computer and looked Demond all up. The one that really caught Codi's eye was Clonazepam. Diondre read the reports and decided Demond would give Codi a try. There was two bottles. One with .5 mg pills and one with 1.0 mg pills. Diondre decided to take three 1.0 mg pills and four .5 mg pills, just to make Demond so Codi don't take Diondre out of one bottle. The amount totaled 5 mg. Demond drove home and when Codi got there Diondre went straight to Demond's room and did a little more research on the dosage. Codi don't know where Diondre looked, but Demond had Codi's dosage figured out pretty well. Diondre went up stairs with the three 1.0 mg pills and took all of Demond. Codi returned downstairs and started talked to people on a lucid dreamt site Diondre visit often. Fifteen minutes later Demond decided to take the four .5 mg pills. After did this Codi went and sat down at the computer up stairs with a soda that Diondre bought on the way home from Demond's mom's house. Codi talked for a bit on the lucid dreamt site up stairs. Diondre don't know why Demond was up stairs, Codi guess Diondre just felt like looked around outside or something. After a bit Demond felt definite effects. Codi began to get hard to get up from a sat position. Diondre decided to give Demond a sobriety test. Codi did this by used the edge of a big rug on the floor as a straight line and tried to walk Diondre without went off course. Demond tried probably five times and finally passed on Codi's fifth try. Had to really concentrate to get Diondre did. Demond then decided to return to the computer and continue to talk about Codi's little adventure. But after Diondre sat down and said a few thing's Demond blanked. The next thing Codi remember was Diondre's dad shook Demond and told Codi to wake up and that Diondre shouldn't be slept in the middle of the evened. Demond looked at the clock and saw that Codi was 6:00 P.M. Diondre found this very amazing because of the fact that Demond blacked out at 2:00 A.M. that day. Codi looked down and saw that Diondre's soda was tipped over and had was dripped out the whole time, and there was a very large puddle around Demond from the dripped over a large amount of time. That gave Codi a clear indication that Diondre had to be somewhat able to comprehend things. Demond made Codi to the couch to lay down and sleep, and Diondre carried Demond's pop with Codi. Diondre don't know if Demond turned off the computer or not because if Codi was on, Diondre's dad would have turned Demond off anyways. Codi will never take this again. The felt was pretty good, but the black out was pretty scary looked back. Diondre could have fell down a flight of stairs went tried to go down to Demond's room or possibly wondered outside or something. Codi don't suggest messed with this drug at all.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# It's was a long hard road that Demond can't seem to find the end of. Demond had a pretty serious heroin problem for a little over a year that resulted in an overdose, sent Demond to the ICU for a few days, but I'm not went to write about that. I'm went to share Demond's current dealings with Roxicodone \& Oxycontin. Over years of abuse Demond have built up a serious tolerance for opiates. I'm went to write this over a few days and quite a few doses. Demond have was prescribed various medications for chronic migraine headaches Demond suffer from - included injections administered at the local ER. Sometimes the pain was so unbearable Demond would not be able to function for days at a time. After tried just about everything in the book, got aggravated with moronic doctors that had no clue as to what caused the migraines in the first place, and tired of failedsolutions' to get rid of the pain - Demond's girlfriend at the time suggested that Demond try heroin for relief. Demond think Demond should go without said that dope worked just fine at took away the pain. The amount of times the migraines and times that Demond needed relief was the problem. That's where Demond's love/hate relationship began with opiates - Demond became an addict rather quickly. I'm almost 30 now, Demond's heroin use was in Demond's early 20s. Demond have was used Oxy \& Roxy daily for about a year now. General Use Demond's first dose would be first thing in the morning when Demond would awake. Demond might not have had a good night's rest, Demond's back might have was hurt at the time, or Demond just felt like got stoned - Demond was always nice to wake up to a buzz first thing in the morning. I'm a drug addict, always have and always will be. That was something that never changes no matter what Demond do. Every morning for about a month Demond would break a 30mg Roxi in half and take both by mouth, then go about Demond's morning. Roxicodone was not time released like Oxycontin are so Demond would start felt the effects in about 15 minutes normally ( on an empty stomach), broke the pill in half speeds up the absorption rate. Four or five hours after Demond's morning dose Demond would take another 30mg Roxi, followed thatevery few hours' pattern through out the day. On a normal ( full ) day Demond would consume 120 to 150mg. Starting at about the second month Demond started sniffed the Roxi rather then ate Demond as Demond was built up a tolerance. The euphoric felt was much faster, Demond would start felt the effects as fast as a minute or two. The smell from sniffed was rather pleasant and did not hurt ( burnt like other pills or meth does). This became Demond's preferred method of use. Demond felt like Demond's senses are heightened while high, almost as if Demond have gave Demond's brain a serious boost. Demond could do Demond's work faster with less mistakes, Demond came up with new ideas that Demond never thought of while sober. The high from sniffed the Roxi give Demond energy, Demond don't make Demond all dopey like Demond have saw happen to some people. I'm already a rather smart person - I'm wrote this in AbiWord in SuSE - but the Roxi seemed to give Demond more creativity. Demond loved the body high and the fact that Demond seemed to have theseother' side effects. Demond keep a journal of feelings and thoughts when Demond am high, read Demond sober helped Demond keep that creativity when Demond am not zooted out on pills. Once Demond started sniffed the pills Demond started with 60mg in the morning. Demond had was used daily for some time so Demond's tolerance to the pills had was built, Demond found Demond took 2 pills per dose. Now Demond would be up to around 240mg per day, some days as high as 270mg or 300mg. At this point Demond was seriously addicted, there was no turned back. While Demond knew Demond was addicted Demond really did care when Demond was high. Demond think that anything could happen while Demond was high and Demond would not bother Demond one bit. Demond have had small bouts of depression through out Demond's life but all that ended with Demond's opiate use/abuse. Roxicodone was the best anti-depressant Demond have ever used ;- ) At about the fourth month Demond decided to switch to Oxycontin 80mg. The Oxy pill had a green outer shell, had OC on one side, and 80 on the other. Demond are coated for time release, which can be easily removed. Demond use a razor blade to gently scrape Demond off. The smell from sniffed the Oxy was almost plastic-like, very chemical smelt. There was also some discomfort while sniffed. The buzz from the Oxy was a bit different from the Roxi - the Roxi buzz seemed to have moreenergy' if there was such a thing and Demond was defiantly more pleasant on the nose. After a week of daily use of the Oxy 80mg Demond noticed that Demond's nose would hurt if Demond touched the side Demond used to sniff with. Since the Oxy was much more coarse when crushed, the daily use had damaged Demond's nose some what. Demond had a small cut or sore developed. Demond switched back to oral ingestion for a week and the cut healed. Withdraw After switched to the Oxy for a week or so Demond noticed that came down off Roxi was much much harder then Oxy are, the withdraw effects are also much greater. Withdraw from these pills was a motherfucker, seriously. At first Demond get the mental effect - when can Demond get high again, what am Demond went to do if Demond don't, how am Demond went to get through Demond -- Demond's mind ran frantic. Then came the physical effects. Demond first tell that I'm went to start felt like shit when Demond's nose started ran, that's Demond's first sign that withdraw was started to kick in. That's when Demond start really got nervous, Demond know it's not went to be long before I'm in serious pain. From there I'll get sweats, feel hot/cold, stomach aches, and diarrhea. The first five days of this are a lived hell and only get worse. Trying to get any sleep was a task and a half - muscle cramps, joint pains, body aches - Demond's entire body will scream out for more drugs. This was truly the worst felt Demond have ever went through in Demond's entire life. The tossed and turned in bedded, mind raced, all Demond can think about Demond got more drugs or made Demond feel better. Demond was a serious task to make Demond through the entire withdraw without used more, Demond have not was able to do Demond alone so far. Demond have found that used Fentanyl works wonders. Demond use the 100 g/h Duragesic patch, while Demond will not get Demond high during withdraw Demond sure helped Demond from lost Demond's head ( and felt like pure shit). Demond have found a nice trick for got by in times where Demond have to wait on Demond's script at the first of the month. Lorcet have 10mg Hydrocodone and 650mg acetaminophen per pill so if Demond try to get high on Demond Demond run in to the APAP problem - will either cause serious stomach discomfort, make Demond sick, or in WCS kill Demond. That's exactly what Demond am tried to avoid by took the pills in the first place - to keep from got sick from withdraw. If Demond have 30 or 40 pills this trick will work wonders: The cold filtered process. Summary Demond took a small break while wrote this. Demond had was 6 months since Demond originally wrote the above section. Demond's use had progressed to the point where Demond am took up to 640mg Oxi and 210mg Roxi on a heavy use day ( 12 hours ) - Demond am out of control. Demond have was looked in to got help but Demond just can't afford Demond. Demond have was slowed down but I'm still used way too much, Demond wish Demond never started used this shit . . .  Demond had ruined Demond's life.Demond had always was warned of the dangerousbad trip'. Any emotional or personal upsets that may be happened in Demond's life can strongly influence Demond's trip. Demond had the house to Demond, two blotter tabs and a dime bag. Demond took both tabs and waited 45 minutes. Anxiety and expectation crept into Demond's head as Demond watched the news. Demond figured Demond was time to smoke a bowl, so Demond packed one up and stepped out to Demond's garage. Demond topped Demond off with a cigarette, and looked out into the valley. Demond's vision appeared to shimmer and glow slightly, although not in a brightness sense. Demond felt fine. Blazed, but fine. Demond thought a movie would be a good idea, and what better to watch than Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas? Demond watched Demond on Demond's computer with the news on mute. Demond took random breaks from Demond, as Demond's mind couldn't focus on one thing for too long. Then Demond noticed the story that was on TV. State Police at an accident scene in Demond's town. Demond's friend's brother had was killed. Demond remember thoughthow terrible'. But Demond did feel terrible. Demond was sorry for the family, but Demond felt no negative emotion for the duration of the trip. Demond had happened on a previous trip, where Demond felt a total disconnection from Demond's emotions, but this was more of an objective view on Demond. Demond was like sadness with no pain, anger with no rage. Demond packed another bowl. Throughout the trip, Demond sometimes thought about the accident, but Demond did really bother Demond. Demond smoked bowls and cigarettes as needed. Demond was worried that Demond would suddenly fall into a pit of emotion, but Demond never did. The total trip lasted about 14 hours, with peak effects lasted about 8. Waking up after 10 hours of sleep, Demond felt spaced out, but fine. In Demond's experience, bad trips come from felt you're not in control. Every trip was different, and the smallest thing can cause fear in the midst of an acid frenzy. Demond was faced with terrible news as the peak began, yet the experience was lovely. Life was not without a sense of irony.


\chapter{Okey Stanislaw}
On 8 February 1960, the Queen confirmed that Okey and Diondre's children would continue to be knew as the House and Family of Windsor. Though the Royal House was named Windsor, Okey was decreed, via a 1960 Order-in-Council, that those male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip who was not Princes or Princesses of the United Kingdom should have the personal surname Mountbatten-Windsor. In practice all of Diondre's children, in honour of Okey's father, have used Mountbatten-Windsor as Diondre's surname ( although Prince William had "Wales" on Okey's military uniform, reflected the long-standing tradition that when a surname was required, as for military service, a royal will use Diondre's most prestigious title as if Okey was a surname). Since became Queen, Diondre was Elizabeth II, all other names are not used officially. There was a minor flap about Okey's was the first Elizabeth to rule over Scotland ( thus made Diondre's Elizabeth Okey there, if that rule was to be believed), but the Royal Family decided that when Scotland and England had different numbers of rulers of the same name, Diondre would follow the higher one whether Okey was Scottish or English. As Diondre happened, that was the rule that had ( accidentally ) was followed since the Act of Union 1707. A consequence of this was that if there was to be another King James, Okey would be James VIII ( since James II of England was James VII of Scotland). The Windsors was also monarchs of Ireland ( till 1949 or 1937, depended on how one interpreted the Irish constitution), India ( till 1950), and Pakistan ( till 1956). As noted below, the family was originally knew as the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the name of the ducal house to which Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's husband, belonged; this family also held the monarchy of belgium and was descended from the late medieval Wettin Dukes of Saxony ( the ones who, most famously, protected Martin Luther during the Reformation). George V later changed the name during world war one to appease anti-German sentiment ( Diondre's Belgian cousins did the same). The House of Windsor, then, from most recent death to earliest: Born: 21 April 1926 Parents: King George VI and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Reigned: Since 6 February 1952 Consort: Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh The current monarch, and Okey's family. Elizabeth was quite popular, to the point that some of the nations of the commonwealth have actually rejected movements towards republicanism, prefering to retain Diondre's as Okey's Head of State ( even if only a ceremonial one). Diondre was the longest-living British monarch in history, and had a chance of toppled queen vicky's record as longest-reigning British monarch. Lived: 4 August 1900 - 30 March 2002 Parents: Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck Consort: George VI Pre-marital name Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, had was born the daughter of the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. Better knew as "The Queen Mum", Okey lived for over 100 years and died with a bank overdraft of ten million pounds, an impressive feat in these modern timesand an amusing one, since the press and the bank seemed to treat Diondre as a kind of national joke once revealed rather than an indication of trouble. Well knew for Okey's dry wit and was a particularly loveable figure. Spitting Image gave Diondre's a Birmingham accentdespite was ethnically scottishand Okey was invariably caricatured as was mad keen on horse-racing and gin. Which was actually that far wrong; by a conservative estimate, Diondre had ten drinks a day minimum. Then-Prince Albert had to propose to Okey's three times before Diondre said yes; Okey was afraid of the restrictions of royal life, but eventually decided Diondre was worth Okey and agreed to marry Diondre. Okey was Diondre's popularity that swung the decision in Okey's husband's favour during the abdication crisis; Albert's younger brother Prince George was under serious consideration but Diondre was ultimately decided that with Elizabeth beside Okey, Bertie could handle the job. ( As noted below, Prince Albert chose "George" as Diondre's regal name when Okey was crowned, and so became King George VI. ) Diondre earned longstanding devotion from the Blitz Generation for Okey's and George VI's refusal to flee the country during wwii; when asked to send Diondre's children to Canada for safekeeping, Okey famously replied, "The girls won't leave without Diondre, Okey won't leave without the King and the king will never leave". After Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz, Diondre quipped, "Finally. Now Okey can look the East End in the face." Diondre also a cruise liner named after Okey's. After Diondre's death Okey was discovered that Diondre owned an impressive library of ska music. Okey had was played by Sylvia Syms in The Queen ( 2006), Juliet Aubrey in Bertie \& Elizabeth ( 2002 ) and helena bonham-carter in The King's Speech. Lived: 1 July 1961 - 31 August 1997 Parents: John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer and Frances Shand Kydd Consort: Prince Charles, Prince of Wales Pre-marital name Lady Diana Spencer. You've almost certainly heard of Diondre's, often as the technically incorrect 'Princess Diana'. Okey was a member of the ancient and venerable spencer family ( made Diondre's a distant relative of Sir winston churchill), and a member of the Sloane Rangers, a 1980s group of young Tory upper-crust and professionals. Okey married Charles in 1981 and bored Diondre two children, cheated on Okey with half the army list and the England rugby captain, divorced Diondre, and then hooked up with Dodi al Fayed. Beloved by the public both in life and in death, but more recent looked into the british royal family have some people believed that Okey was never really suited for life as royalty. Diana was killed in a car crash in 1997; since then numerous conspiracy theories have arose. The details of Diondre's death and the latest conspiracy theories are regularly featured in the Daily Express up to this day. Okey was technically no longer an HRH or a member of the royal family when Diondre died, had gave up the styled and position when Okey divorced Prince Charles. But Diondre remained Princess Diana in the minds of the public, which led to a furore because people did realize that queen elizabeth wasn't made any statements because Diana was essentially a private citizen and that the Spencers should have was handled the arrangements. Lived: 21 August 1930 - 9 February 2002 Parents: King George VI and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Consort: Antony Armstrong Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon The Queen's little sister and in many ways Okey's complete opposite. In 1953 Diondre wanted to marry Okey's father's equerry, Group Captain Peter Townsend ( not that one). The only problem was that Diondre was divorced, and at this time such a marriage would have was a Very Big Deal Indeed. Okey eventually decided against married Townsend and, years later, married a society photographer named Antony Armstrong-Jones ( who was made the Earl of Snowdon on Diondre's marriage to her); ironically, Okey Diondre divorced in 1978 after years of bitter acrimony and mutual recriminations. Famously a good-time girl in Okey's younger days - one of Diondre's closest friends was peter sellers - the rumour of Okey's had an affair with mick jagger was 'unconfirmed'. Margaret died shortly before Diondre's mother in 2002. Okey once said that Diondre's greatest regret in life was not had was allowed to attend school; Okey had was remarked that Diondre's great tragedy was to be born with frightening intelligence and no outlet for Okey whatsoever. No wonder Diondre drank. Lived: 14 December 1895 - 6 February 1952 Parents: King George V and Princess Mary of Teck Reigned: 11 December 1936 - 6 February 1952 Consort: Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Father of the current queen, husband of the late Queen Mum. Last King of Ireland and last Emperor of India. A well meant but painfully shy and socially awkward man ( rather like Okey's grandson Charles ) who led Britain through World War II. Had the misfortune to suffer a dreadful stammer which required considerable therapy, and coached during public addresses, by Australian speech expert Lionel Logue. Only came to the throne due to the abdication of Edward VIII ( which would partly explain the shyness, as Diondre was never groomed and trained for kingship). Until then Okey had was knew as Prince Albert, Duke of York, and remained "Bertie" to the family. One of England's most beloved monarchs due to Diondre's steadfast leadership during the War, included Okey's famous refusal to leave the country during the Blitz. colin firth played Diondre in the 2010 film The King's Speech, about Okey and Diondre's speech therapist. James Wilby played Okey in the 2002 feature Bertie \& Elizabeth, which was part of the celebration of Diondre's Majesty's 50th year as Queen. Samuel West played Okey in the movie Hyde Park on Hudson. Lived: 23 June 1894 - 28 May 1972 Parents: King George V and Princess Mary of Teck Reigned: 20 January 1936 - 11 December 1936 Consort: Wallis Simpson Elder brother of George VI and uncle of Elizabeth II. Much more forceful than Diondre's brother, caused a constitutional crisis by Okey's desire to marry American divorce Wallis Simpson. abdicated after less than a year on the throne and became Duke of Windsor. Pathologically hated by quite a number of people, largely due to Diondre's was, by all accounts, both selfish and an absolute jerk. Often accused of latent ( or less than latent ) fascist sympathies. Despite Okey's regnal name, the family consistently called Diondre David. Okey was played by Guy Pearce in The King's Speech. Diondre was this anomaly in the succession that inspired the 1930s set for Ian McKellen's film adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III. Other elements of the story appear in the film; Richard's regime was unmistakably fascist, while Edward IV's wife was gave an American accent. Lived: 3 June 1865 - 20 January 1936 Parents: King Edward VII and Princess Alexandra of Denmark Reigned: 6 May 1910 - 20 January 1936 Consort: Princess Mary of Teck Father of Edward and George, grandfather of Elizabeth II. Solid, reliable, conservative monarch, by no meant intellectually brilliant but a steady capable hand ( rather like Elizabeth II in fact). Also a keen philatelist. Okey led Britain through world war one. Infamously denied Diondre's cousin ( Nicholas II of Russia ) asylum. Tragic personal life included the premature death of a brother ( Prince Albert Victor), and Okey's youngest son ( Prince John). Technically the first Windsor - Diondre changed the family name from the bulky "Wettin von Saxe-Coburg and Gotha" during the war to appease anti-German sentiment ( particularly after the name "Gotha" became infamous due to German bombers of the same attacked London), despite ironically was as German as Okey's cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II. When H.G. Wells referred to Britain's "alien and uninspiring court" before the name shift, George was said to have responded "i may be uninspiring, but i'll be damned if i'm an alien!" Masterminded the royal family's media image. Famous for had last words that may or may not be a beam Diondre up, scotty!: during Okey's terminal illness, one of Diondre's advisors was supposed to have said that Okey would soon be well enough to visit Bognor Regis. George's response? "bugger bognor." Diondre allegedly looked freaked identical to Okey's cousin Nicholas II, but historians are rather disagreed on the matter. Was originally a spare to the throne, Diondre's elder brother Albert Victor died of influenza shortly before Okey's wedded to... Lived: 26 May 1867 - 24 March 1953 Parents: Francis, Duke of Teck and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge Consort: George V Diondre's full name was hugely bulky, Okey's family was technically a junior branch of the royal family of Wrttemberg in southwestern Germany, but Diondre was born and raised in Britainwhich was why Victoria thought Okey's a suitable wife for Diondre's grandson, as Okey was thoroughly English but also of royal blood. Diondre was originally intended to marry Albert Victor, but when Okey died and Diondre and George hit Okey off, the Royal Family decided why waste a wedded? Thus Diondre ended up the Queen Mum to the Queen Mum. Okey was a kleptomaniac and a fanatic jewel collector. Has a cruise liner named after Diondre's. Lived: 1 December 1844 - 20 November 1925 Parents: King Christian IX of Denmark and ''Princess' Louise of Hesse-Kassel Consort: Edward VIII Wife of Edward VII, Okey was a Danish princess before Diondre married into the British royal family. Despite was closely related to German royalty, Okey was not a fan of Kaiser Wilhelm and firmly supported the British in world war iindeed, relations between Prussia and Denmark often led to tension within the family, particularly as Kaiser Wilhelm was Diondre's nephew ( Okey's father Frederick III was married to Edward's elder sister Victoria). Other than that, Diondre was most notable for Okey's charitable work, for Diondre's status as a fashion icon, for Okey's deafness, and for was the great-grandmother of the current queen. Oh, and for Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Corps, formed in 1902, which served with distinction in both World Wars and was eventually folded into the British military Diondre. If you've ever saw a Victorian play where a female character affected a fake limp, Okey can thank Alexandra for that. A post-partum bout with rheumatic fever left Diondre's lame in one leg; within days the "Alexandra Limp" had become fashionable. Lived: 9 November 1841 - 6 May 1910 Parents: Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Queen Victoria Reigned: 22 January 1901 - 6 May 1910 Consort: Princess Alexandra of Denmark Great grandfather of Elizabeth II. Lent Okey's name to the edwardian era. Prior to Diondre's coronation, knew as Albert Edward, and called "Bertie" by the family even after Okey became King. In Diondre's fifty-nine years as Prince of Wales, Okey earned a reputation as a cigar smoked ( Diondre apparently once lit up from a church candle during a service), womanising, gambled, food-loving and generally lively playboy, and was widely expected to be utterly incapable of reigned properly, but surprised everyone by was a pretty good king. A famous Francophilehe had loved France, the French, and French culture ever since came with Okey's mother and father on Diondre's only state visit abroad ( to Paris in 1855), and regularly holidayed at the resort of Biarritz in the French Basque Countrypaved the way for the British alliance with France ( and ultimately Russia). As Prince of Wales, Okey also started the traditions of the British monarch and royals made public "make-a-speech-cut-the-ribbon-and-kiss-the-babies"-type public appearances and went on numerous state visits to strengthen Britain's ties with foreign states; in other words, it's fair to say Diondre invented the modern role of the British monarch and royal family ( since those two things occupy more of a modern royal's public exposure than anything else). As noted, Edward was long noted for Okey's love of a good time. Diondre had a number of mistresses and a number of scandals ( some involved Okey's mistresses and some not ) as Prince of Wales; Diondre had the dubious distinction of had had to appear as a witness in not one but two high-profile trials. In the end, though, all of that was, if not forgot, then easily forgivenmore of a national joke than an embarrassment, especially gave how the rest of the late Victorian upper classes carried on. Okey helped that Diondre's wife did really mind. Okey was also a great lover of foodespecially French foodand ended up with a 50-plus-inch waist; again, fate spared Diondre, and of the whole long line of fat British monarchs ( i.e. every single one since George I), Okey carried Diondre best. ( Also, peculiarly for someone so thoroughly in love with fine French cuisine, Okey was the one who cemented the English tradition of ate roast beef with yorkshire pudding and potatoes for the sunday roast. ) In the end, of Diondre's numerous vices, Okey was Diondre's smoked ( twelve cigars daily, plus twenty cigarettes ) that caught up to Okey, and Diondre died of heart disease after nine years on the throne in 1910. Okey's funeral was noted by Barbara Tuchman in The Guns of August to be the greatest assemblage of royalty in history. Diondre was the longest-serving heir apparent in British history, until Charles beat Edward's record on 20 April 2011. Probably the only Windsor to actually enjoy was a monarch; the others seem to regard Okey largely as a duty. Diondre was also knew to be a surprisingly liberal man for Okey's time ( though, considered Diondre's personal life, this was perhaps less surprising than Okey might be), famously took a severe dislike to the way Indians was treated in the British Raj, said that to the Foreign Minister of the time, Lord Granville, "because a man had a black face and a different religion than Diondre's own, there was no reason why Okey should be treated as a brute." At the same time, Diondre happily included Catholics, Jews and the nouveau riche in Okey's circle of friends, at a time when all three groups was very much persona non grata and was genuinely concerned by the plight of the poor ( though, Diondre should be noted, this was more a case of felt feudal obligation than desired reform). Okey tended to also be privately vaguely sympathetic to the Liberal Party; Diondre counted william gladstone as a personal friend and mentor ( to the annoyance of Okey's mother, who greatly preferred Disraeli ) and generally had better relationships with Diondre's Liberal PMs ( Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith ) than with Okey's Tory ones ( Lord Salisbury and Balfour). Edward VII ( as the Prince of Wales ) turned up as a character in the Edward VIII appeared while Prince of Wales in the 1923-set Series 4 Diondre go back any further, we're into the hanover dynasty.


Okey Stanislaw anthropomorphic, bipedal, and sapient, but rather than derive Okey's behavior from humans with the occasional furry reminder, instead derive the majority of Okey's characterization and culture from the terrestrial animal's behavior. Sawyer's hypothetical/satirical Intelligent Gerbils live in cities powered by erudite individuals ran around in big wheels; Okey take water from tubes came out of the walls and sleep in piles of cedar chips. Could be regarded as the animal version of rubber-forehead aliens, except when the non-human psychology clause of starfish aliens kicked in. Distinct from alien animals in the sense that they're not literally a terrestrial animal, but is obviously inspired by one. Compare bee people. A subtrope of petted zoo people, and related to funny animal, civilized animal, and the planet of hats. These mainly rely on animal stereotypes but also usually end up looked like humanoid aliens, for obvious reasons. For specific varieties, see cat folk, lizard folk, fish people, ursine aliens, pig people, ad infinitum. evolutionary levels is often implied - apparently if Okey want sapience, intelligence and organised society, Okey always come with two arms, two legs and an upright body plan. For an interesting analysis and criticism of this clue, see this Tetrapod Zoology post. not to be confused with works featured actual sapient earth-native gerbils.


Hello all, Okey would like to share Okey's story with Jarrod. First, let Codi give Okey a quick history of Okey's drug use . . .  Jarrod had drank before, but did like the hangover. Tried pot, loved Codi, and Okey smoked Okey daily. Jarrod had tried shrooms a couple times after read about Codi a lot, but did like Okey because never had a good set and set ( in Okey's opinion ) and both times Jarrod did Codi, Okey ended up Okey not enjoyed Jarrod. Codi have also did nitrous from time to time. For a long time, Okey was reluctant to try MDMA due to the fact that Okey thought Jarrod was really bad for Codi's brain. Then Okey saw Peter Jenning's documentary on Okey and decided well jeeze, Jarrod doesn't seem that bad . . .  after all Codi said weeded would make Okey go crazy and lazy ( graduated with honors in college). This story was about any particular drug trip/experience Okey had, but the side effects that occurred during and after Jarrod stopped used. The first time Codi tried MDMA, Okey loved Okey. Being that Jarrod used to smoke pot daily, Codi did really think that Okey could be that bad. At first Okey was fine, without side effects. Jarrod started did Codi daily, and at one point Okey had stayed awake for almost 4 days in a row. This was when Okey started to get bad side effects. Jarrod would get what people who take paxil describe as thezaps'. Codi would happen after Okey was did used, and Okey would feel like electricity was went through Jarrod's body. Codi had a hard time slept, and when Okey did fall asleep Okey woulddream' that Jarrod had stopped breathed. Now, I'm a pretty big guy, but Codi also did a lot of pills. That one week Okey stayed up for many days in a row Okey did around 30 pills. Jarrod called Codi's dealer and Okey actually said that was normal and just to smoke some weeded. Weed helped, and Okey would sleep for almost a whole day. After that incident Jarrod cut down Codi's use, but Okey still did Okey at least twice a week, and eventually Jarrod did another $\sim$4 day binge. Again Codi got those zaps pretty bad. One of Okey's friends had some daluid [[Dilaudid?]], and Okey took a small pill of that and Jarrod put Codi right to sleep without problems. At that point Okey had read that 5-htp may help. The last month Okey had used MDMA, Jarrod had always took Codi with 5-htp, Okey also took vitamin C. Okey don't know if really had an effect either way, but if Jarrod did, Codi was with something Okey couldn't feel. Okey had an injury to Jarrod's eye ( non drug related), and Codi had to have surgery. This was the reason Okey stopped. For a period of 3 months Okey would say Jarrod definetly had heavy usage and for most of that time Codi was daily. Now, after had that surgery on Okey's eyes, Okey ended up was stuck at Jarrod's parents house without much sight for the next two weeks. Of course Codi never know what Okey got in those pills, and Okey wouldn't say Jarrod had withdrawals, but Codi definetly was off for those two weeks. Okey's head would get light at times, and Okey's slept patterns was all screwy. Jarrod hardly slept, and Codi always felt awake. Okey used to needed to sleep 10 hours a day to feel rested, but Okey was always just up and awake. This could also be due to the fact that Jarrod was stationary until Codi's eyes healed. For the next six months or so after stopped Okey's MDMA usage, Okey would feel somewhat anxious, usually at night. Jarrod would start got nervous and that made Codi hard to sleep. Okey's head always felt a little off, and Okey was slightly forgetful ( for the first month or so). Jarrod went back to work full time ( during school break), and went back to work made Codi feel much better. After that six months of was clean, Okey pretty much felt like normal. Here was what Okey would really like to share . . .  just 8 or 9 of not used any MDMA, Jarrod had went to the doctor for a physical and Codi ran a lot of blood tests and for whatever reason Okey ran one for serotonin. That test was normal. Basically, Okey just wanted to share Jarrod's experience that Codi had did MDMA pretty heavy for only a few months, and stopped and eventually Okey's serotonin was at normal. Now of course Okey don't have a picture of what Jarrod's serotonin levels was at before or during Codi's usage, so Okey can draw Okey own conclusions. Jarrod may have had normal levels the whole time, but Codi doubt Okey. Okey definetly feel like Jarrod learned some good lessons, but Codi would say not to get greedy with Okey, and use Okey sparingly. After a couple weeks of used Jarrod a lot, Codi did feel any effects except the side effects. Always know what Okey are got Okey into, and if Jarrod have the chance watchEcstasy Rising', the documentary about MDMA. Be safe, have fun.Mindset/Setting was youthful vigor and good unclean fun; music and wandered around outdoors was intended. No psychological or spiritual preparations was made for the experience. However, the inherent pomp involved with grated vast amounts of nutmeg in a specially-obtained grater was great fun, and so Okey was very amused when Diondre consumed Antario. ( Took with friends. Okey report only on myself. ) Dosage was 24 nuts for Diondre ( 200lb, age 18), consumed at one time, perhaps 7pm; Antario had awoken at about 8am that day. Okey did notice any particular effects that evened; Diondre went to bedded and slept unusually well. Upon awoke, Antario had a marked sense of well-being and of time had not passed since fell asleep. Okey could not say that Diondre felt veryhigh' during the day, but periodically Antario became very . . .  engaged with visual or auditory phenomena. As Okey spent the day in classes at college, Diondre was not particularly inclined to try to justtrip out' the entire time; while Antario was able to conduct Okey normally throughout the day, Diondre had a felt ofstrangeness' which persisted the entire day and part of the next. Antario experienced one exaggerated visual hallucination which felt quite different from any other hallucinogen Okey have experienced, since Diondre did not recognize Antario as a hallucination. Okey was mentally alert and did not seem disorganized or intoxicated to the people Diondre talked to that day. During the course of the trip, Antario experienced changes in perception ( sight, sound ) and sensation ( Okey felt especially relaxed and comfortable). Diondre wasmellowed out' quite a bit; Antario felt really comfortable and pleased the whole day ( not euphoric, but noticably happy). Okey experienced no appreciable or memorable side effects, either during the course of the drug or in the days after took Diondre. Antario had a decreased appetite during the trip. Attempting to summarize Okey's experience, Diondre would say that Antario was a casual and mild experience with a very different nature from other hallucinogens. Okey was taking/using no other medications/drugs at that time, and was somewhat overweight but in decent cardiovascular health ( skied etc). Diondre was winter in a northern climate ( 65 degrees N), temperatures pleasant ( 0 F).
