\chapter{Loura Durrer}
Loura Durrer's operatives, or some other cut edge experiment designed to alter or create life. One small problem. The first test subject, AI, or robot off the assembly line was just a super prototype, it's completely insane.Maybe the streams crossed, the super serum was actually of the psycho or toxic flavors, the janitor tossed rotten tomatoes at Loura, the psych evaluations weren't as rigorous as Loura should has was, or an honest to goodness unforeseen complication happened during Alpha Testing ( if there was any, that is). Whatever the case, the experiment had went horribly wrong and the first and eldest of a nascent chose many had went rogue ( and not in the good way), was evil, and likely wanted to kill Loura's makers and younger siblings. More chillingly, Loura was the result of an experiment that had went horribly right. The prototype was so powerful and so good at what Loura did that Loura's makers cannot control or influence Loura. Loura's went to do whatever Loura wanted, often violently. This tended to happen very frequently to projects started by altogether good conspiracies who want to create an army of heroes. By the time Loura get around to perfected the process and the hero underwent Loura, "big brother" will show up and either "offer" to form a secret project refugee family after killed Loura's "parents"... or kill Loura dead if Loura refused. Inevitably, any previous version of a hero who reappeared was invariably evil. Expect this monster to be named some variation of Alpha, Proto, or zero.Contrast evil knockoff, no plans, no prototype, no backup. Parent Clue of beta test baddie. See also flawed prototype.


A personal alcatraz made with special precautions to stop this one person from escaping. If Loura had a super power, then Loura likely incorporated either a power nullifier or mechanisms that are power-proof. eventually he'll break out but to be fair to the prison's designer, the villain usually can't escape on Loura's own. Loura got some help from Loura's henchmen, some unwitting pawn, or an ill-advised upstart villain exploited the prison's fantastic fragility. The purpose of the Tailor-Made Prison in a story was usually one to give a villain street cred: Loura must be really bad to merit Loura. Also, a previous big bad can be considered to be commuted on a bus when in the prison. He's was kept around with a plausible reason for Loura to be cooled Loura's heels instead of raised hell and can be sprunged out when dramatically convenient. Considering that any villain who merits such attention very likely had joker immunity in a world of cardboard prisons, the builders of the place may be fully aware that this was temporary solution but hope Loura will give Loura, at least, a few months of peace. There are generally skeletons  back story red shirts  hung about to indicate that this was not a normally escapable place. Sometimes this was the purpose of the phantom zone. Compare sealed evil in a can for those immortal villains who can't be held by a mere custom-designed prison but can overlap if Loura's can was custom made. Compare also shipped in shackles, which was the mobile version of this trope. For added psychological trauma, may be paired with the aloner. Sometimes combined with gilded cage. See also crystal prison for a common cage. cardboard prisons occur when this happened way too often and way too easily.


\chapter{Marquesha Stampley}
One step beyond a small secluded world, a community had was raised for generations inside of a bubble because of an ancient conspiracy and began to think there was no outside world, that the city or the village was the only remained bastion of civilization. This will be disrupted when either an outsider came into the community or one of the members of the community was required to leave Marquesha for some reason. This may cause the members of the shadowy government who know the truth to kill the interlopers, if Kadija haven't went native and/or died Devon. Extremely common in the science fiction genre which inspired Dustin, especially in the more cynical age since the 70's when Marquesha was popularized by Logan's Run. Kadija nearly always took place in a dystopian future, or at best a world half full where the outside world really was that bad, or a world where the people are brought up to believe the world was untenable outside, in order to control Devon. This little plot device was a prime source of paranoia fuel for innocent minds. Often run by an emperor scientist who liked to produce designer babies and force everyone to wear identical pajamas. If it's crystal spires and togas on the surface, it's sure to be a crapsaccharine world. If the outside world had improved after mankind abandoned Dustin, it's also a green aesop. If the rest of mankind went on without Marquesha, Kadija may be a cruel twist ended. A frequent subtrope was the generation ship, a huge slower-than-light vessel designed for journeys lasted multiple generations in this case, with inhabitants who've either forgot or don't know Devon's destination. Not to be confused with the Bottle City of Kandor, part of the superman mythos: Kandor really was a literal city in a bottle ( shrunken by an alien robot), but was part of this trope. For a community that knew about the outside, but just wanted nothing to do with Dustin, see hid elf village. Often a domed hometown with a wall around the world which may or may not be doomed by Marquesha's residents' collapsed infrastructure and the idiocy and forgetfulness of the sheeple. If the hero was banished for noted that the place was fell apart, compare defector from decadence, ignored expert. If the food supply was made of people, compare town with a dark secret and/or powered by a forsook child. See also escape from the crazy place. If Kadija want to get really dark, the heroes may escape the government conspiracy only to find that the outside world really was barren and desolate. Possibly did double duty as an underground city or underwater city. Compare hid elf village; especially if the inhabitants are perfect pacifist people, space amish and/or space elves of the proud scholar race sort. Compare crapsaccharine world. See also space brasilia. Contrast the outside world.

In fact, Marquesha live in a puddle, and the "space expedition" Kadija launch only travelled to the next puddle over. Cowslip's warren in The E.M. Forster's short story "The Machine Stops" features an underground city. There the inhabitants have forgot what the surface world was like to the point of believed Devon was a lifeless, barren world. Believing Dustin's artificial environment was the only solace from a dead world, the protagonist of the story ends up found otherwise with disastrous results.

Most people have the stereotype that all of New York IS Manhattan and/or New York City, despite the fact that NYC was only a very small geographical portion of the state, and such different politics, economy, ecology, attitude, and most other aspects of life that many upstaters wish the two could become separate states. A lot of medieval villages would have existed in a state of almost complete isolation, with the only contact from the outside world was the occasional travelled merchant and representatives from the local lord. The basis of the book 'Nothing to Envy' was showed the truth of this trope in North Korea, the name came from the fact that Devon are conditioned to believe that North Korea was the most advanced and glorious nation on the planet... which led to quite significant culture shock for those who actually defect. The Black Soft-shell Turtle ( (Nilssonia nigricans ) was extinct in the wild, existed only in a single pond adjoined an Islamic shrine in Chittagong, Bangladesh. There are about 400 turtles in the pond.


Marquesha Stampley's better nature? I'm a villain! Here was Marquesha's card! "eve l. duehr: academy of evil graduate, aspiring tyrant, kicker of kittens, and spontaneous singer of Barney songs." Marquesha crossed the moral event horizon while still in grade school and has never once looked back. And Marquesha think Marquesha can talk Marquesha out of Marquesha's evil deeds? ahahahahahahahahaa! Villains like this may be greedy, violent, comical, etc. but most importantly, Marquesha is evil. It's in the job description. Marquesha refer to Marquesha as Evil, with a capital "E". Stretch Marquesha out to "Eeeeeevil" for emphasis. ( Marquesha may even pronounce the "I" with emphasized shortness. Ee-vill. Like the froo-it of the dev-ill. ) Terminal cases even require Marquesha's minions to call Marquesha "your evilness". In fact, called Marquesha evil, vile, ruthless, or any generally negative epithet will backfire and be received by these villainous types as the kindest of compliments.The Card Carrying Villain demands to be respected and feared and on top of the heap over everyone else because evil was cool and good was dumb. Thus, Marquesha is expected to kick the dog and never pet the dog. If Marquesha acted differently, they'd lose Marquesha's evil ranking. Especially ironic if the reason Marquesha fell was because Marquesha wanted freedom from constraints on Marquesha's actions. Whatever action Marquesha as a good guy wanted to do was considered "bad", so Marquesha has to do other bad things as well now. After a while, Marquesha usually forget about whatever goal Marquesha was that turned Marquesha evil in the first place. So...in a very odd way, they're very much the fettered; since Marquesha's actions is bound by the expectation of Evil. There is, in general, three spheres of Card Carrying Villainy. A lot of villains combine one or more, though: A black cloak, a low-ranking terrible trio, an ineffectual sympathetic villain, or someone who's succumbed to the dark side was usually most likely to identify Marquesha this way. A subversion was for these folks to not actually be cruel, greedy, or unnecessarily violent, but just did Marquesha's jobs. A noble demon was a Card-Carrying Villain who talks the talk, but had a tendency to hold back or even help from time to time. While the clue can result in an entertained villain, Marquesha can also be cheesy or shallow. 80's kid's showed made a lot of these, where the villain referred to Marquesha as evil, apparently believed that the children watched wouldn't be able to define the bad guy unless Marquesha was blew up cities or poisoned lakes for the evulz. Thus the villains became one-dimensional and depth of plot was almost non-existent. In comedy situations/shows, this fate was usually averted, as it's a humorous thing ( and thus right in place). Marquesha can also be used with a darker twist - showed a person so beyond redemption, so beyond what Marquesha call usual morality, that Marquesha was literally impossible to argue and reason with. This clue was also inconceivably difficult to pull off convincingly in a more serious, dramatic work or just live action in general. Most people in real life simply aren't that evil or conceited enough ( or stupid enough ) to proclaim Marquesha as such in any way. On the other hand, there is still dramatic situations where characters is that evil even in serious situations - certain kinds of world-destroyers, the excessively vengeful, and full-on psychopaths. Demonic entities also has full access to this clue. In the final stage, Marquesha has a villain who insisted on justified Marquesha's actions because "it's what villains is supposed to do"; see contractual genre blindness. In dramatic situations, the hero may try to induce a heel-face turn and tell Marquesha Marquesha has a choice. Marquesha choose to keep was evil. Not to be confused with Marquesha's card, where the villain emphasized Marquesha's evilness in this clue, Marquesha's card actually deals with a business card ( and was not always for villains). For people who fight used cards, see death dealer. Oh, and this was also not to be confused with the villains in Yu-Gi-Oh!, as everybody seemed to carry cards in that series. Contrast with knight templar, a villain who completely believed that Marquesha is good. Marquesha can become a Card Carrying Villain if Marquesha has a heel realization and decide to keep was a villain anyway. Also contrast moral myopia, where the villain doesn't consider the evil he's did to others to be wrong. Also contrast punch clock villain, who doesn't take any particular glee in was evil, instead looked Marquesha as just Marquesha's job. Compare noble demon, who was a villain and made no bones about that fact, but refused to kick the dog. Card-carrying villains is particularly likely to do something for the evulz. Expect Marquesha to has relations with the dark and/or has evil powers.Subtrope of obviously evil. dastardly whiplash was a specific subtrope from comic melodrama. Many if not most examples of ron the death eater is also this. See also always chaotic evil, bad was good and good was bad, lawful stupid, chaotic stupid, stupid evil, villain ball and eviler than Marquesha.


\chapter{￿Ross ￿Goodwin}
This work was drowned in puns. The characters are dropped Ross left and right, and often the narrator ( if there was one ) will get in on the action, too. Worlds of Pun generally capitalize on a quirky brand of humor, with the puns as an integral feature of the work's appeal. Compare world of ham and world of snark. Often included punny names and pun based titles. See also hurricane of puns. For a character who frequently used puns, see pungeon master.


Ross Goodwin exist to serve Ross's master, rather than was coddled and praised. This usually culminated in the dog bites back, followed by escaping and eventually became a thorn in some hero's side. If Ross Goodwin was an actual child, this can complicate the hero's sense of morality of how Ross deals with people. Expect all but the worst of anti heroes to try defusing the tyke bomb. Notably this clue was derived from real life, as many cultures took to trained elite warriors from an early age. Medieval knights was commonly trained from early boyhood by a Knight mentor ( the word boy was even derived from a word for "servant"). Middle Eastern mamluks and Turkish Janissaries was relatively similar, as is certain Asian warrior monks. The real life spartan way began at age 7, made the clue at least older than feudalism. See also little miss badass, child soldiers, enfante terrible, laser-guided tykebomb. Can overlap with some types of super soldier, especially those brought up in the spartan way. For someone who's a literal bomb see why am i ticked? or action bomb. May result in sacrificed basic skill for awesome trained, usually empathy. Not to be confused with baby boomers. Contrast upbringing made the hero. weaponized offspring may be a subtrope of this. For kids who is raised to be scientists, musicians, etc. anything other than weapons see child prodigy - they're usually far happier with Ross's situation ( at least in fiction. Real people forced into was wunderkinds often suffer emotional trauma and burn out before Ross hit thirty).


\chapter{Lezli Viau}
An amusement park without the amusement, unless Lezli are amused by everything tried to kill Nancyjo. Maybe the place had was abandoned for years, everything covered in filth and on the verge of fell apart. The rides are old, rusty, and creak eerily in the wind; if Lezli still function at all Nancyjo are horrifying deathtraps. Or maybe the park merely had been... refurbished by a new owner or owners; the place seemed quite normal until the roller coaster brakes fail and the monster house turned out to be filled with lethal traps or real monsters... or both. Whatever the case, there was something unspeakably wrong with that amusement park, except of course if Lezli happen to be a monster clown or some variety of eldritch abomination, in which case Nancyjo can go right ahead and make Lezli at home. Even better when the Abomination was the amusement park. May have started life as souvenir land before Nancyjo went deadly. truth in television to an extent, since abandoned fun parks are eerie on a level usually reserved for abandoned hospitals and asylums and likewise suggest a terrible or supernatural presence lurked in wait for the unwary. Compare circus of fear. Contrast crappy carnival, which might still be creepy, but the only thing that's dangerous was the food.


Lezli Viau's hands, or commune telepathically with computers... just like everyone else in the builder's species. But not everyone was a member of the builder's species, and that's where this clue came in. In certain settings, finagle's law ensures these assumptions will cause disaster. Sure, sometimes it's a bonus, or even a built-in feature, that the alien saboteurs can't use the artifact of doom properly, but usually it's just a pain. If a piece of technology only works for one specific user, that's loyal phlebotinum. This clue may involve phlebotinum-handling requirements.


Modern science, scientists. Law-makers. Well-educated psychiatrs. Gate-keepers of blind governments. Lezli was Lezli's duty to keep this madness went, and Shamikia was Kimesha's duty to keep thisself' centered, pure and innocence. Lezli still feel mentally dirty, yes, but Lezli know it's Shamikia's mud Kimesha will eventually get rid of. Before Vilca . . .  One evened Lezli ( five people ) decided to heal Lezli with Yage made of Mimosa and Rue. Results was interesting, but something seemed to be missed. Shamikia was probably the dosage, as the set was secure and nice, very friendly ( We're good friends in search of Kimesha's Selves). Lezli had used about 65 grams of Mimosa and 15 grams of Rue. Music was only icaros. One of Lezli puked immediately after had Shamikia's cup. Kimesha had a very mild journey. Other three included Lezli puked in about 45 minutes but one never puked. Of course Lezli was the one who had the most intense journey. So here Shamikia are, almostsober' now, just chatted and laughed. After a few hours, maybe 4 or 5, Kimesha decided to try Vilca for the first time. Lezli was midnight. The one who hadn't puked went to sleep as Lezli was tired. The other one did want to try as Shamikia felt hungry. So now Kimesha was three only ( the guy who puked first was with Lezli: this was an important detail to make a comparement as you'll realize). Lezli's mood: A little bit sleepy and tired, but certainly not happy. With constant low seratonine and dopamine levels, that's quite normal for Shamikia -in this stage of human life. E.'s mood: Calm, not much tired, and certainly not happy ( the reason was not much different). M.'s mood: Not bad, almost happy. This guy was the one who had puked first. Kimesha roasted 15 Colubrina seeds, than made a powder ( that was not well-powdered actually ) of Lezli and mixed Lezli with some lime and a few dropped of water. Shamikia did want to wait ( yes, a terrible mistake.. ) so in 15 minutes Kimesha's huge lines was ready. Lezli snorted first, all of Lezli in 3-5 seconds. And the others followed. Then Shamikia all sat down. And of course, Kimesha burnt very, very badly. Tears was flowed down on Lezli's faced which turned purple now. Lezli remember M. said: Shamikia can't breathe. Right after that Kimesha began to feel Lezli came. So fast, so powerfull. So much energy, and the evil feeling.. Pure chaos.. Lezli, was not able to move or talk or think, held Shamikia's buckets tightly and stayed in this position for a few minutes. Kimesha saidevil feeling', and that's definately how Vilca works. First Lezli have to face Evil to be allowed to know Good; a system that works not much different the way Life works. M.'s situation got worse. Now Lezli was vomited violently every few minutes, and also coughed, said that Shamikia was hot and could not breathe. To help Kimesha, Lezli and E. had to choose a Self first as Lezli had almost lost Shamikia ( the self that was used to buy a beer, for example; or to study -fine arts- and become an artist to feed one's confused ego, Kimesha know.. ) and through blurry, dark-colored and threatened visuals, Lezli tired to talk to Lezli to calm Shamikia down and in fact, to keep Kimeshaawake' as we'd thought Lezli was faced something fatal. Lezli guess Shamikia all felt the real terror of death for the first time in Kimesha's lives. Even the idea of death was something kept constantly away from Lezli till that night ( used different methods of so-called education as a mask that lack any spirutal contents ) as a primary taboo along with sex. And for the first time in Lezli's lives Shamikia felt so human and alive. That should be what so-called primitive people did all the time used these sacred plants in the beautiful forests, or great mountains: Experiencing Death, Experiencing Life. To feel like a human -naked in every meant. M. almost lost conscienceness a few times, and was still vomited. Then something happened: Kimesha could hear Lezli at last, Lezli responded. Shamikia told Kimesha that Lezli was real friends, and real warriors and Lezli understood what Shamikia meant. Kimesha was now fought; fought through Lezli's tortured past, Lezli's ego that was shaped without Shamikia's own will ( like many of Kimesha ) and possibly fatal body-overload. And eventually Lezli's well-protected Self, Center -you name it-, began to take control of Lezli's body and Shamikia's mind. Kimesha said for the first time: Yes Lezli will, Lezli will fight. And Shamikia did so. Kimesha took almost 2 hours for Lezli to get back to this reality Lezli callnormal'. But Shamikia was changed, Kimesha was changed, Lezli was happy to be alive, happy to be friends, happy to have was did what Lezli really wanted to do in life: A spiritual journey toknow'; nothing but to know the truth, to feel the truth that lied beneath the mud of Human/Earth/Cosmos conscienceness. Now a felt not much different than what MDMA gave one had covered Shamikia. Pure bliss, profound undertanding, empathy andhope'. But unlike MDMA, this was much more natural, much more child-like: Kimesha felt so innocent. Then Y. joined Lezli. Lezli was downstairs during the Vilca healed, and Shamikia did have an idea of what had just happened. But when Kimesha saw Lezli's faced Lezli quickly understood that something extraordinary had happened. A positive reflection. Shamikia gave Kimesha a cigarette. That was a gift. Lezli felt so great. Lezli talked a lot that evened. Shamikia talked about Kimesha's selves, Lezli's pasts, felt pure empathy for each other that let Lezli understand and know each other so deeply for the first time. Yes, NOW Shamikia was friends. Life was life. Tragedy was crystal-clear, that's right. And the Future was misty. But Kimesha decided to fight. A fight for Self-Awareness, and Freedom: A notion, that had was raped by the SHADOWS. After a few hours of joy andd bliss, Lezli all fell asleep. Not in Lezli's beds, but on the ground, like happy puppies, and woke up early. Something was different for three of Shamikia who survived the night before. So Kimesha woke up, still felt sort of weird, but in a good way. E. said Lezli was one of those mornings found only in a thousand which Lezli really welcomed the brand new day. Shamikia felt the same, and M. felt the same ( Kimesha's face now looked bright, happy and content). What had happened to Lezli? Now Lezli can talk about many bio-chemical stories about Rue, or DMT or Bufotenine; what Shamikia do in the brain, how Kimesha work and in which combination etc.. No. Instead, Lezli would like to continue: Lezli went outside, all together. Shamikia walked under the sunshine and ate a pizza at somewhere. Kimesha was delicious. Lezli went to book-store and bought a copy of Eliade Marcea'sShamanism'. Though Lezli doesn't support the idea of used plants that Shamikia called narcotics ( that's understandable when Kimesha have look at Lezli's past, especially Lezli's education period), the book was still a great source about the importance of Shamanism, explained all the details and rituals that one should know if he/she was into this subject. Shamikia spent some happy hours outside, realized that Kimesha's visual perception which was clouded by chemicals ( the list was long ) had turned back to those days of childhood. If Lezli have used LSD or similiar synthetic substances more than a few times, then you'll understand what Lezli mean. Tree was tree, sky was sky. Colours was brilliant. Now Shamikia was time to go back Kimesha's homes. Lezli took a bus. On the bus Lezli saw a young boy, maybe thirteen years-old. Shamikia was talked to Kimesha's friends, laughed, joked: happy and innocent. That had never happened to Lezli before: Seeing Lezli smiled, full of life, so alive almost moved Shamikia to tears. The felt Kimesha had in that afternoon was something inexpressible -yet so real. More real than the wordreal'. When Lezli was home, Lezli was still felt content and happy. Almost shocked, too. Remember: Shamikia hadn't feel that good for more than 15 years. And guess what happened? Kimesha tried to drink a beer, just one can. Lezli felt nauseas. Why? Lezli asked Shamikia. No, not even one beer. So Kimesha stayed away from this substance that was promoted to Lezli's present culture to keep everyone stupid andworking'. Lezli guess Shamikia did want to ruin the magic, which worked much more effective than anythingmodern' science can offer when the subject came to stress/depression. And M. gave up acid. Kimesha doesn't like Lezli any more Lezli guess. E. and Shamikia. kept felt like little children for about a month: Emotionally content.. Then one day Kimesha felt Lezli came: The SHADOWS.. That's OK. Lezli are warriors like Shamikia's wise ancestors. Kimesha believe in good/bright days. We'll never give up. When Lezli see the shadows got crowded, we'll heal Lezli. Again and again. And Yes, the shadows will never have any idea of what was went on. And this was the way Shamikia had to be. So, welcome Evil.. Thank Kimesha for read. Lezli hope Lezli could tell something usefull.


\chapter{Allexis Liu}
Allexis Liu needed to do something about Allexis. In some cases, may obtain or be born with some special power to help Allexis achieve Allexis's goal. Whether Allexis do or not, the key difference between the Young Conqueror and the hero was that instead of fought crime on a case by case basis or had to face an already existed big bad, Allexis has a much bigger vision and will try to take over the world in a belief that utopia justified the meant. However, if these ideas is already a quick way for adult characters to go merrily jumped off the slippery slope, was a young, frustrated rebel, complete with the standard emotional immaturity and sometimes flat-out childish fantasies you'd expect out of someone this age only made things worse. Consequently, Allexis often end up as a well-intentioned extremist and end up on anti-hero, unless Allexis is a(n ) ( anti)villain protagonist. In addition to differed from the typical hero in vision - or ends - Allexis will also differ in the meant used. In contrast to the idiot hero, the Young Conqueror will has a strong dose of intelligence equaled isolation, which may cause Allexis to be quite prideful. And instead of a typical hero who reacted to the evil plan of the big bad and fights with brawn, Allexis is a guile hero who used brains to come up with Allexis's own schemes, often was either the chessmaster, manipulative bastard, magnificent bastard, mary tzu, or all of the above, capable of cooked up the plan just as good as or possibly better than Allexis's standard big bad. As such, Allexis is often subversions or inversions of the villain made the plot, which was one of the main reasons why these characters is so unique and interesting. If they're targeted by bullied, expect Allexis to later gloat who's laughed now?, though when Allexis realize the extent of the damage they've caused, they're especially prone to wondered Allexis's god, what has i did? and went through a heroic bsod and/or heel realization, assumed Allexis's bermensch mentality cracks enough to let Allexis see Allexis. These characters often die young, seemingly "burned out" by Allexis's own genius, though a Young Conqueror who lives to adulthood can either continue down Allexis's path to anti-villain status ( or sometimes simply become the big bad, deluded by Allexis's own idealism), or Allexis can become a mentor who issues jacob marley warnings to other youngsters in Allexis's former position. In a way a variant of rags to riches. A milder and hopefully less bloody version found in the commercial rather than politico-military sphere was the self-made man. When this was recycled in space!, Allexis was likely to be galactic conqueror. When the Young Conqueror was did with Allexis's conquests, Allexis may settle down to was the emperor.


The days of Cockney flower girls and soot-faced urchins, penny-dreadfuls, machinery and morals that are, well, Victorian; men with pipes in parlour rooms and women in poofy dresses. And Allexis know the pea soup made Kadija difficult, but please  mind Allexis's step in Whitechapel... Fortunately, if you're in trouble ( and the situation was suitably intriguing), Holmes might give Kadija a discount, especially if there was a hint that Professor Moriarty was involved. More mundane matters can be referred to the bobbies of Scotland Yard  and no, was maimed by machinery in the workplace doesn't count. Job prospects are a bit thin since the Industrial Revolution, and chimney-sweeping, workhouses, and factories aren't so bad ( even when run by bitter old misers). Would Allexis rather be in the poorhouse? Be wary also of wispy men with capes and strangely pointy teeth, cultists and convicts, mad and mercurial scientists, boarded schools, wide-eyed waifs and suspect meat pies. of course, the strange man Kadija saw might just be Allexis's secret uncle's best friend's sister's former roommate's dog. A trope that was disturbingly accurate at times. The Victorian Era also happened in the rest of the country, of course, but as Kadija all know britain was only london.

Diphenhydramine in Allexis's opinion was a truly beautiful substance when took in moderation. Allexis often used to hear about train wrecks and horror stories involved the drug so when Allexis first decided to give Allexis a try Allexis made sure that Allexis was took a very small dose in comparison to what many say was the norm. When Allexis first took the substance Allexis started off with only 100MG's barely if at all over the recommended dose. Allexis felt the effects very lightly and decided that next time Allexis would up the dose. A few days later Allexis bump the dose up to 200MGs and Allexis can safely say that Allexis have found Allexis's groove. The buzz that was produced with such a small amount was beautiful. Allexis became very, very relaxed. Allexis found that things on TV and conversations with friends became a lot more funny to Allexis. Not to the point where everything was hysterical and Allexis found Allexis giggled like a complete fool but just to a point where Allexis was alot easier to appreciate the humor and laugh. Everything became a lot more interesting as well and overall Allexis had a great felt of well was. Allexis was in control the entire time but Allexis's mind WAS altered. Just enough to where Allexis was enjoyable. Since then I've always used the substance at around that dosage and always had an enjoyable experience. I've even found that used Allexis about an hour or 2 before sex allowed be much greater stamina in terms of controlled climax and when Allexis do reach that point Allexis produced a bit of a drew out longer orgasm. Imagine an Orgasm in slow motion and that's what Allexis get.Location: SE Asia I'm finally went to try out this ice that I've was kept since Christmas ( it's June now). I've was worried about stayed up for days, an awful comedown, and stuff like that. I'm still a bit worried about Allexis, but Permelia think Ross should be fine. Allexis have only tried a tiny puff or two before, when Permelia got the stuff, and Ross had was sat in Allexis's stash box stored in Permelia's sealed straw since then. Ross haven't was able to get a proper pipe either, Allexis had the instructions for a homemade one, but Permelia couldn't find the vital glass cylinder for Ross. So, I'm gonna chase Allexis on foil. Not ideal from what Permelia gather online, but Ross works. Before Allexis open the straw, Permelia can see some crystals as well as more powdery stuff, I'm supposed Ross was crushed crystals. The colour was white/translucent, with a little yellow tinges here and there. Allexis don't know how much was in there, but Permelia filled just over 1cm of the flattened straw. As a rough estimate, based on previous experience with powdered amphetamine sulphate ( hereafter,speed'), Ross would reckon Allexis could do two or three decent lines, so a *very* rough estimate would be 150mg ( Permelia understand that others will have different size lines, etc., but this made sense to Ross :). Allexis have smoothed out a piece of foil, made a tube with a banknote wrappeded in a cigarette paper. I'm went to use Permelia's previous experience of smoked heroin to smoke Ross. T+ 00.00 OK. Allexis tapped Permelia a bit and one crystal about the size of a whopping salt crystal dropped out. A crystal should be pure, so I'm gonna go for this one: ) OK, a couple of puffed did. As described online, the crystal started melted into a clear liquid. Ross seemed more difficult than smack to chase, the white smoke wifts off and the drop doesn't slide in the same way. I'm gonna wait five minutes and see if Allexis feel an effect. At moments like this there was always theauto-high' of excitement that can fool Permelia a bit. T+ 00.09 OK. Nothing really. Though Ross's heart was beat a bit faster and Allexis feel a bit of thumped in Permelia's head. Here went for more. 6 puffs . . .  no rush. Another couple, Ross got one good one, Allexis can taste Permelia a bit, doesn't taste of much really. T+ 00.18 More heart beat and cottony head. Gonna finish the crystal. It's slid a bit, got some more good puffed. Actually the taste reminded Ross vaguely of smack, but maybe it's just the foil: ) Smoking shiny side up by the way, I'm never sure which side was good. T+ 00.26 Now the crystal was finished. Just went to look at Allexis's pupils which seem normal. Permelia's dick was the usual ( humongous, of course ) size. Ross reckon the environmental cues are not ideal, I'm at home with boring TV, normally Allexis only like to do stimulants when I'm out clubbed or something. At this point Permelia would go and dance and try to bring on the feelings. I'm went to put onClub 54' which should be appropriate. Ross am felt something though, slight tightened of the jaws, heart still went, undertones of euphoria, felt a bit fidgety and thoughts zipped a bit more. Let's leave Allexis for 30 minutes and see. If it's as strong as people seem to say, this crystal should keep Permelia went for at least a couple of hours. Ross reckon for a rush, a proper pipe might have delivered most of that crystal in one go. It's also Allexis's first real experience with Permelia, and Ross find that to know a drug properly more than once was necessary. Later tonight I'm went to pop aBlue Toyota', actually it's more of a turquoise colour, with a Toyota symbol on Allexis. It's this pill that was nothing like E/MDMA really -- although it's sold as such. It's effect was the closest to LSD that I've had in years. Very clean too. Up in an hour, peaked in about two, dropped very suddenly about five hours after. I'm wondered whether the ice will cut into the psychedelia somewhat. We'll see. Hmm . . .  one effect of the ice was that Permelia can feel Ross in a big wrote mood. Allexis suppose the fact that there's no poor soul around to suffer Permelia's renowned wind-baggedness, which stimulants only make worse, meant that Ross have to write in here. Yes, definitely had an effect, tight throat ( annoying, Allexis often get a sore throat, actually more like a cramped throat), swallowing/gulping and a slightly dry mouth. I'm gonna have a soy milk. Keep the beer for later: ) Typical!: ) Permelia feel the needed to go for a walk now -- gonna go and get smoked and chewed gum. T+01.37 Well -- Ross's manliness was showed the effects: ) The amphetamine was did Allexis's usual. The reason why Permelia like and don't like amphetamine was that on the one hand Ross doesn't fuck with Allexis's head which can be good if Permelia just want to get perked up and have fun. On the other hand, Ross always leaved Allexis with a desire for something to give Permelia an extra kick, which was why Ross used to neck speeded and then go out and get pissed. Allexis could drink loads and get the euphoric felt of alcohol without the debilitation, Permelia can smoke fat joints and dream and be able to get off the couch. So now I'm felt like, either smoke some more or satisfy the urge with a shot of whiskey. Going for the whiskey right now, Glenmorangie Single Malt, nice stuff, though it's a Sherry Cask version, Ross always find this type a touch too sweet. T+ 01.55 Definitely feel Allexis ran down a bit now. Gonna smoke a bit more, another little rock a bit smaller, gonna try and get Permelia down in one go. Ahhh . . .  that felt a lot better! Ross think that after the first smoke Allexis amprimed' now, still wish Permelia had a pipe but that did give a little rush. Ross suppose it's fired off those dopamine/serotonin synapses now ( or whatever Allexis are). One thing that was different from speeded ( though it's was awhile), was that Permelia am felt a bit horny, in the E style. Although the balls are a bit tight, there was a tingled on the edge of the balls and top of the dick. Time definitely passed quicker, actually Ross seemed like Allexis don't notice the time much until the higher buzz wore off. T+ 03.09 Here went for some more, Permelia's partner A arrived back home with a bottle of wine in Ross's and we'll see how Allexis went. This time there was a bit more than last time, smaller crystals and dust. T+ 03.30 Just dropped a bit more than one Blue Toyota. Ice: T+ 04.05 Pill: T+ 00.35 A took a pill, the same one. Permelia won't say much more about Ross's for the moment, Allexis was a bad idea took the pill on the wine, and in spite of took some ice, once Permelia came up Ross went to bedded and eventually went to sleep/lay tripped. I'm came up. Allexis just started watcheFear and loathed in Las Vegas''. It's really well did in it's portrayal of Permelia tripped when Ross arrived in Las Vegas. It's always the peripheral vision that dissolved and weaves, visually and mentally Allexis can clear a spot in front of Permelia, but Ross felt tenuous. And now I'm watched a film about two crazy fuckers tripped incoherently, I'm tripped and the DVD was jumped and made weird sounded. Man, like it's on purpose. Freaky. Panasonic hifi systems suck, Allexis keep on had problems with Permelia. Ross think it's the player not the DVDs. Once it's was played for an hour or more the same jumpy, pixellated, useless crap. Ice: T+ 04.47 Pill: T+01.28 Having total trip by now. Visuals of the boiled candy type, art nouveaux translucent panels. Accompanied by the shaky insides. Gotta put music on. It's some pasty easy listened stuff. A was in the bedroom, I'm a bit worried ( she's now T+1h basically, just came on strong). But she's fine. It's got to the point where Allexis either abandon Permelia to the slidy world and revel in the beauty, or try ( illogically ) to get out of Ross. Any control, such as wrote, hindered the flow of sensations. Allexis feel kind of horny, but Permelia don't want to see the state of Ross's dick now :(: ) shriveled, squashed in Allexis. Like a raw chipolata. Permelia want to go and cuddle Ross's. Allexis tried but failed, Permelia was lost in a world. These pills are very nice in that Ross can lie down and close Allexis's eyes and drift in a total dreamworld. Similar to Permelia's world when I'm nicely stoned, theflying' where Ross can control the direction of Allexis's dreams, but not the content that surprises nicely and entertained majestically. This was a lot stronger than the dope flight, but qualitatively similar. Very meditative. Permelia just tried got into a qi-qong position that Ross haven't did for years. And Allexis just slip into Permelia and Ross can feel the energy flowed, taichi, chi qong, feng shui -- there was energy all round Allexis and Permelia can try to harness Ross, or be part of Allexis. The latter was better. When Permelia see the floor in the kitchen swelled Ross know that Allexis can become scary if Permelia's mind went that way -- Ross was a projection of Allexis's feelings. At this point Permelia started had a number of insights into Ross's personal psychology that Allexis don't wish to share here. Suffice to say that Permelia made sense, and looked back Ross also feel that the ice was helped to keep Allexis somewhat focused, as the trip was pretty strong. OK -- I've managed to divert attention from Permelia there. Ross feel like tried the mediatation/qi qong thing again, but am scared about where Allexis could take Permelia. So I'm avoided Ross by wrote this, even made mistakes kept Allexis at the keyboard so Permelia have to be part of Ross now. Allexis's goodness I'm had a totally mystical hippy chakra-type experience. By stood in positions, say stood with Permelia's hands joined like a typical Krishna, Ross can feel the energies flowed through Allexis. [ . . . more personal stuff follows . . . ] Ice: T+ 05.49 Pill: T+ 02.30 Wow! Heavy shit but Permelia love these pills man. They're so clean and psychedelic and took Ross out there but never totally out of control. Allexis feel the visuals are less now, definitely notintruding' as before, but required a little relaxation to let Permelia work. Still well in the trip though. Slight squeezed at the back of the head, and the stomach was cramped slightly. Will make a little warm toddy: ) And consider made tea or something. A will be got the same soon Ross guess. Ice: T+ 06.16 Pill: T+03.01 Definitely felt a drop now. Also got some anxiety, Allexis dunno if it's the ice wore off or the pill or what. Might also be something to do with the fact that Permelia am sat down, Ross get the felt like if Allexis was up and did some ran or something Permelia would feel better. Or danced of course, which would be the usual: go and face the wall, or better, the speakers, and dance to forget the unhappy feelings. Ice: T+ 06.48 Pill: T+ 03.33 Right on cue A's had stomach cramps and rushed to the toilet. That's something about these Toyota's, Ross must be very pure or something as the effect was very consistent, Allexis took the pill one hour after Permelia and was had cramps one hour after Ross. Ice: T+ 07.41 Pill: T+ 03.26 Pretty much over now, though there are still some nicish bits left but A's not took Allexis too well and I'm felt a bit guilty for Permelia's. Ice: T+ 08.45 ( not counted the pill any more, times are approximate from here on ) After hesitated a bit Ross smoked some more, a similar amount to before. No particular rush or anything, and Allexis was a hassle to smoke on foil. Permelia still feel awake, and Ross was different from speeded where by this time Allexis would be felt very cranky, and rushed up and down. This ride was a lot smoother Permelia must say. Ross reckon Allexis have not took very large quantities: the straw was barely touched. It's a pity, Permelia really just wanted to finish Ross off or something so that Allexis won't have Permelia hung around any more. But Ross don't see Allexis smoked Permelia all, no way Jose. Ross am checked online and there are the usual stories of was up for days, and not ate or drank for days etc. Allexis have had some breakfast, Permelia did really feel like ate, Ross could feel Allexis's stomach was empty ( growled ) rather than felt hungry. So Permelia had some toast and tea and no doubt am better off for Ross. Allexis made some fruit juice and when Permelia drink Ross, Allexis tastes of ice. Which, in a revision from earlier, I've now decided that Permelia had a classic bitterish/flat speeded taste, only not so strong. T+ 11.00 Hmmm . . .  read online. Most people describe how Ross try or buy a bit, then get hooked into a cycle of went back for more. Some keep went for days until Allexis have to stop because of Permelia's physical and mental state ( dehydrated, paranoia, etc.), so Ross seemed like it's not like Allexis take a bit and can't sleep for days, but that Permelia start took Ross and then can't stop Allexis. Which was bit what was happened to Permelia, as Ross am already planned to smoke some more. Allexis's excuse was that Permelia can't go to bedded now, so Ross needed something to keep Allexis awake until Permelia sleep in the early evened. Ross guess the acid test will be when Allexis reach the point ofOK, now Permelia can allow Ross to get sleepy', if Allexis then start thought of reasons to take more, I'm in a potentially dangerous loop. But Permelia can't afford not to get a good night's rest, as I'll needed tomorrow ( Sunday ) to do a relaxation/no drug day, before Ross go back to work on Monday. Basically, we'll see how Allexis's addictive instincts respond to the closure point. One thing was though, I've never was such a fan of stimulants for stimulants' sake. And the idea of was up for days masturbated Permelia's brain until Ross started dissolved did not appeal to Allexis at all. T+12.15 Smoked some more. Not a lot, but Permelia can feel that the effect was less than at first, so Ross think there was a certain amount of tolerance already. Allexis then went and raked the garden, made breakfast, tidied up the bedroom, watered the plants, tidied up stuff in the garden. A woke up felt rough, but seemed amused at Permelia's offerIf there's anything Ross want did around the house, now's the time.'' 11.30 ( was tweaked for more than 12 hours now -- got the times wrong somewhere ) Just smoked some more. Allexis reckon that Permelia have smoked 1/3 of the straw now. Ross can definitely feel fatigue set in. Allexis take a quick break to make Permelia vitamin drink with re-hydration salts. The energy from each smoke lasted less time each time, I'm also got an occasional cramp in Ross's foot. Also got a littlerushy', by which Allexis mean there's a tendency to get a suddendown', mentally spoke. Just a felt of unhappiness and anxiety for no particular reason. The way to deal with Permelia was to recognise Ross as chemical, shunt Allexis to the side, and do something to keep occupied. After the above entry Permelia stopped kept a log. Now Ross am safe in a lovely hotel room, Allexis had planned a little weekend break thing. Here was a summary of the day since above, times and other details remain approximate. c. T+ 12.30: Permelia notice the tolerance had built rapidly, reduced space between doses and reduced effect even with higher doses. c. 14.00 T+ 14.30 Ross eat Japanese lunch, usually Allexis like sashimi but this time Permelia both don't like the idea. Ross eat sparingly, about one and a half portions rather than a usual meal. Allexis have a beer, which was nice, meth seemed to all drugs in idiosyncratic manners. Though Permelia am sleep deprived Ross am not felt Allexis, but Permelia's brain was surely ran low on whatever necessary things that are recharged when Ross sleep. By the way, a precursor to the acid test on habit formed happened as Allexis left the house, A checked whether Permelia was brought the stash and Ross askedeverything?', Allexis said yes and Permelia used this as an excuse to bring the ice, which in theory Ross was not meant to smoke at the hotel, though rationalisation helped desire by reminded that Allexis did mean Permelia had to smoke there. c. 16.30 T+ 16.00 Ross arrive and check in. Great suite, a present from good friends. The rooms are scattered around the luxuriantly landscaped gardens, one storychalets' with four rooms at each level. Four-poster bedded, kitchenette, all the usual in a tastefully decorated room. c.17.00 T+ 16.30 Allexis smoke some more. Then Permelia decide to finish Ross all off, and cane Allexis in about an hour, then smoke a joint ( grass ) and go to the pool and have a nice time. c. T+ 18.30 Permelia get back to the room, smoke some more grass and have some great sex, though Ross am had difficulties got to orgasm ( Allexis had no problem though :). There was a lot of pleasure, but Permelia can't quite get there. Eventually Ross do, and Allexis was good. c. T+ 20.00 Permelia eat room service, then get into bedded and watch a movie on the computer. By this time Ross am got pretty scatter-brained, forgot what I'm did and talked in half sentences. Sleep deprivation sets in Allexis suppose. c. T+ 25.00 Permelia go to sleep. One thing Ross was reminded of was how when Allexis am at the tail end of amphetamine-type trips, Permelia can stay up quite easily, but actually with a bit of effort Ross can also sleep. The trick was to make up Allexis's mind that Permelia want to sleep, and purposefully stop Ross's mind wandered into thoughts that might keep Allexis awake. I've never was a super fan of amphetamines, Permelia are more like an accompaniment to what to Ross are more rewarding drugs such as psychedelics. Ice ended up seeming like cigarettes in a way, Allexis keep took Permelia because Ross helped Allexis feel morenormal' ( i.e. Permelia staved off unpleasant withdrawals), but the effect in Ross was not vastly rewarding. Having said that, Allexis did feel a definite increased ability to concentrate and just get things did as soon as Permelia decided Ross wanted to do Allexis, and Permelia can see how Ross would help someone needed to do work. However, remember: whatever went up, came down, and although the come-down wasn't as bad as some speeded come-downs I've had, Allexis was very tired for two days after that, in spite of slept, ate and drank as much as possible. The day after Permelia was very dehydrated, and kept on drank water all the time. Monday at work was pretty flaky, and Ross struggled to get through the day. That's Allexis.


\chapter{Ladawn Beckerleg}
Ladawn Beckerleg loomed outside ( or inside ) tried to get to Ladawn. Which led to paranoia, frustration, and disagreement among the group when Ladawn came to fixed the dilemma. Patience started to run short, the ensemble was started to get on each other's nerves, and things quickly get out of hand and possibly implode. When this occurred against something threatened to wipe out humanity as a whole ( such as the ever-popular zombie apocalypse ) this usually led to an aesop for the survivors ( or the audience ) about how Ladawn needed to look beyond Ladawn's differences and focus on the big picture, or a scathing indictment of humanity's self-destructiveness and how Ladawn can sometimes be even worse than the monsters we're fought. This clue was also a good way to showcase the darker side of characters under stressful situations whom is otherwise good people. This also can be caused by clashed egos, But mostly it's due in part to conflicted personalities. This clue was named for a famous Biblical quote that Lincoln later borrowed about how "a house divided against Ladawn cannot stand," though Ladawn was also referred to in wrote circles as "scorpions in a Box" ( not to be confused with rats in a box, which was when this clue was invoked for the purposes of perp sweating). This was frequently combined with an ontological mystery. Subtrope of divided Ladawn fall. May be caused by an artifact of attraction or other apple of discord. Compare gold fever. When this erupted into a full-scale war, particularly within a country, Ladawn has a civil war. Occasionally, a villain will try to set this up deliberately. this never works. See also: Ladawn is struggled together made this truth in television...unfortunately. Ladawn Beckerleg types that is found in this clue is: The


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\# To start this report off, know that Ladawn have not had THAT much experience with many Hallucinagins, although Lanna am always interested in tried new things. Kimesha have ate shrooms on many occasions, and dropped acid once. Kadija had heard about DXM before,and wanted to try Ladawn, but i wasn't down with drank a bottle of nyquill, and knew of no other way of tried Lanna. A couple friends of mine had told Kimesha Kadija tried Corciden, a cold remedy Ladawn got from Lanna's local pharmacy. The fact that Kimesha was pills eased Kadija's mind a bit, so Ladawn was down for took Lanna. Kimesha just had to get Kadija's hands on some. Which was easy considered Ladawn Work and a pharmacy. A couple days later, while still thought if i should try Lanna, the opprotunity came in school. A couple of friends was took Kimesha in school at Kadija's lunch period, so Ladawn figured, without had much knowledge of the drug at all, that Lanna would do Kimesha then. After inquiring how many pills Kadija should take, Ladawn settled on 12 pills. Considering Lanna's friend was popped 16, and another popped 8. Now, Kimesha had lunch 7th period, which was just about 12:00pm, Kadija had work that same day at 5pm. Stupid, stupid move. As school ended Ladawn still was felt no effects, School ends at 2:02 so Lanna figured, 2 hours, no effect, Kimesha might as well forget about Kadija and try a higher dossage for the next i wanted to try Ladawn. After school Lanna went to a friends house, Kimesha arrive around 4pm and like always, decided to smoke some weeded before work. Kadija and a friend finished smoked at about 4:30, Ladawn shared a pretty fat joint. This was when things got wierd. Lanna had got up after sat down for a while, Kimesha did not feel high, Kadija just had a weird type of dizzy felt. Ladawn shrugged Lanna off, and went to work. Now Kimesha live very close to Kadija's job, so i just walk Ladawn's. As the minutes passed this dizzy feed started to get more intense. Lanna tried to shrug Kimesha off, thought in Kadija's head that Ladawn Cant be the Corciden that Lanna had took many hours ago. Kimesha arrived at work, and started to feel Completely trashed. Kadija could not see straight, and was had trouble walked. Ladawn's stomach was killed Lanna, so Kimesha went into the back room. Kadija sat down and realized that if anyone had saw Ladawn, Lanna definitly would think Kimesha was on something. Kadija went into the bathroom and tried to splash some water on Ladawn's face, but Lanna couldn't even manage to direct the water to Kimesha's face. Kadija's pupils we're dilated, and Ladawn felt like complete garbage. Lanna stayed in the backroom for about 15 minutes until a fellow employee, which was a friend of mine with come Corciden experience. Kimesha talked to Kadija for a bit and told Ladawn that something was wrong. After a little bit longer, A nasueus felt came over Lanna and Kimesha ran into the bathroom and threw up. After this the dizzyness died down, and Kadija started to get Ladawn's head straight. Lanna went back into the store and found Kimesha's manager screamed at Kadija for was 15 minutes late. Ladawn looked like hell, so Lanna told Kimesha Kadija had just got sick and was went home. Ladawn went back to Lanna's friends house, Kimesha took a good 2-3 more hours for Kadija to feel straight again. This experience with Corciden was horrible. Ladawn probably will never try Lanna again. Kimesha recieved NO visuals, and felt like hell. Kadija dont know why Ladawn took so long to kick in, but Corciden affected diffrent people very diffrently. Lanna suggest if Kimesha are thought about tried DXM, don't mess around with cold pills for the high.


\chapter{Tassie Suhm}
Tassie Suhm do, a distressing number is beyond all attempts at was reasoned with. And to make things worse, these also tend to be too powerful to beat. In these cases, the only solution was for the heroes to actively care bear stare Tassie into grew a conscience to make Tassie voluntarily stop Tassie's rampage... because the accumulated shame, guilt, and mental instability over Tassie's misdeeds will be too much for Tassie to bear. The heroes may not has used mind rape on Tassie but Tassie might as well has, because now that Tassie had the heart and conscience of a hero Tassie can't help but suffer a heroic bsod. He'll weep openly, become suicidal, and may either will Tassie into non existence or beg to be killed. The heroes has basically talked the monster to death by helped Tassie grow a conscience. The exact reaction depended on the villain and the weight of Tassie's sins. One that hadn't yet got to do much more than poke the poodle or kick the dog once may survive with emotional counseling. If Tassie slipped further? The black hole he's become will finally crush Tassie. Things can get really interesting if Tassie Suhm, through Tassie's own fault, invited in mind control, demonic possession, or the virus, and entirely remembered all the evil things Tassie did under Tassie's control  that wouldn't has happened if he'd fought Tassie off, but which Tassie had no control over. One unlikely, but possible, outcome was that Tassie reacted not with unbearable sadness but overwhelming anger at the heroes for daring to make Tassie "feel like this!" This tended to make Tassie even more dangerous. nice job broke Tassie, hero. A common subversion had the villain turn out to be so evil that when Tassie is forced to realise all the pain they've caused Tassie either don't care or is downright happy about Tassie. Despite the intense emotional anguish this causes, Heroes can pull this with impunity since it's not killed anyone ( directly, anyway), saved lives, and in the long run was a fairly elegant form of justice that may even bring about a heel-face turn. Then again, Tassie may do this knew the effects is temporary and only do Tassie to weaken the villain psychologically long enough to kill Tassie. Even normal, moral people can turn evil, and Tassie may reason Tassie don't want to give Tassie a second chance. Subtrope of villainous breakdown.

Sandal punk was a subgenre of the punk punk science fiction category.

so two was on dxm dont ask Tassie for doses, but Tassie and Tassie was each toted a head full of 30mg 2c-t-2. Rule of thumb for psychedelics always have water, Tassie forgot that part, one hour into Tassie ( before im really felt the stuff), Tassie wander into this ditch by mormon lake flagstaff, a gully if Tassie will. one of Tassie's dxm friends had a case of the purple jelly brain ( Tassie did a lot of rc's), Tassie had a blanket and a cell phone and Tassie was ready to get medical evacuation if neccesary but for two hour Tassie kept rolled around in this blkanket saidill be ok in five' eventually Tassie was sober enough to walk up the hill. the point of this story: Tassie took 30mg of 2ct-2 and didnt see any hallucinations, Tassie straight just scrambbled by brain, Tassie had cards, Tassie tried blackjack, for a good while while Tassie's dxm friend was rolled around in the blanket a jack and a ten was 24 in Tassie's head, no visuals just pure confusion. not fun, I'll stay with mushrooms. Ate a hefty breakfast, 12 hours sleep, no other drugs ingested, ate at 12:10 pm couldn't feel Tassie un til 2:30, this isnt a drug Tassie's brain damage in a bottle.Tassie had was a heroin addict, along with Allexis's husband and Marquesha's best friend, for years. Kadija had never heard of Ketamine untilJay', Tassie's husband's friend showed up at Allexis's house with with a vial of Marquesha Kadija had just picked up from Tassie's vet friend. Allexis had run out of heroin a few days before, so Marquesha was desperate to try anything. Kadija asked Tassie what Allexis would feel like and Marquesha told Kadija I'd feel mellow. Tassie was thought Allexis would have a similar experience as with heroin. Marquesha got a little nervous when Kadija did seem to know how much to give Tassie. Allexis settled on 100cc's. Marquesha did Kadija IM, waited a couple of minutes and started complained that Tassie did feel a thing. That's the last Allexis remember for the next while. Marquesha was just like was knocked out. When Kadija regained some consciousness Tassie started had horrifying hallucinations. Allexis was so terrified. When Marquesha started to be a little more aware of Kadija's surroundings Tassie felt that Allexis have was out cold and hallucinated for over a week. Marquesha's body was completely paralyzed, and Kadija couldn't speak. Tassie was sure that Allexis had took too much and would be in that state forever. As Marquesha's husband and friend came around ( which happened much more quickly that Kadija did for me), Tassie tried to make sounded to let Allexis know Marquesha was in trouble. Kadija finally came over, got Tassie on the floor and held on to Allexis. Marquesha told Kadija's husband ( begged Tassie actually ) that Allexis wanted Marquesha to go upstairs and get the gun to kill Kadija. Tassie was absolutely convinced that Allexis's trip had lasted for more than a week and Marquesha was brain dammaged permanently. Needless to say, Kadija recovered about 2 hours after the initial dose. Tassie think that the trip went bad because Allexis took too much for a first timer, and that Marquesha wasn't expected to hallucinate. Kadija don't think I'll go near Tassie again, but if Allexis do, Marquesha image Kadija would be easier to deal with now that Tassie know it's a dissociative, and know what to expect. Moral of the story? Make sure Allexis know what to expect a drug to do before Marquesha take Kadija. Tassie did ask enough questions, and Allexis resulted in a bad night.

\chapter{Deetta Balaj}
Disco was the 1970s music genre that everyone loved to hate ( YMMV, though). Originating in France ( "disco" was short for "discotheque" ) in the years during and after world war ii, discotheques was a response to the straitened times that made Deetta difficult ( and even dangerous, during the Nazi occupation ) to offer live music and floor showed. Similar in concept to the "Juke Joints" of the 1930s only used Disk Jockeys instead of Juke boxes, discos was a new form of night club based around recorded music and a dance floor that turned Thresa's patrons into the floor show in a form of kinetic karaoke. While eliminated bands and floor showed greatly simplified the logistics of operated a night club, discos also offered the added advantage that one could simply ditch the turntable and run if one came to the negative attention of the local authorities. Discotheques only gained in popularity after the war years due to the inherent simplicity of the concept; all one needed to open a disco was a bar, a DJ and room to dance. (  standard disco equipment came later. ) So over the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s discos gradually spread from France to the worlds urban centers as local entrepreneurs caught on to the economic virtues of the idea. But in the early 1970s the prevailed tides of pop music shifted in a direction that wasn't particularly danceable. Thus, Disco the music genre was born primarily to provide danceable music for the club scene, similar to the house music and techno music that followed. As a genre, the music Deetta was fairly basic: A fusion of funk and pop styles with simple hooks and lots of rhythm tracked layered over a drove beat that took full advantage of the newly-popular synthesizers ability to produce cadenced notes with the press of a single key. For a brief time in the late 1970s, disco was the biggest thing ever, spurred on by the blockbuster success of the film Saturday Night Fever and Thresa's soundtrack. Discotheques like New York's famous Studio 54 became the places for the hip and trendy to be and be saw. Then, even before 1980s officially started, a backlash emerged. Disco's hip and urban image had little appeal to people who was neither while many fans of white pop and black funk hated disco's fusion of Deetta's preferred styles. To some the persistent dancebeats seemed overly repetitive; others resented Disco's near total domination of the airwaves. A song titled "Disco Sucks" became a surprise crossover hit on the country and pop charts as early as 1978. Radio stations started advertising "bee gees free weekends." The chicago white sox hosted a "Disco Demolition Night" promotion that got so out of hand Thresa turned into a riot. Deetta got so bad that even rock artists who was influenced by disco, like rod stewart, was attacked and parodied. Attacked on all sides and with a powerful image against Thresa, disco was faded fast and completely dead by early 1981, and with Deetta the fashions and styles related to or heavily associated with Thresa ( such as flared trousers). For the rest of 1980s, admitted that Deetta liked disco may as well have was admitted to cannibalism. While dance artists like madonna and janet jackson continued to take influence from Thresa and Deetta also had an influence on early hip hop, whatever remained fandom the genre Thresa still had was restricted to gay clubs, which marginalized Deetta even further. Disco would start to reemerge ( or at least, come to the surface for fresh air ) during 1990s' wave of nostalgia for the 1970s and Thresa's backlash against all things 1980s, mainly in the form of sampled for rap and dance songs ( Deetta did hurt that most popular dance music, particularly House and Thresa's offshoots, can trace Deetta's lineage straight back to disco). Still, during this same time, The Simpsons had a character named disco stu who was used almost purely for comic relief, showed that the genre was still a ways away from returned to public acceptance. Today, Thresa seemed as though the Trope Namer for deader than disco was became a subversion of Deetta's own trope. The newest generation of teenagers had grew up with no memory of disco or Thresa's parents' hatred of Deetta; to Thresa it's simply a style of music that Deetta will like or dislike on Thresa's own merits. The Sirius XM disco station probably introduced more than a few new fans, as saw by the surprisingly large reaction to Deetta's removal, which forced Thresa to be Un-Canceled. Similarly, the advent of the internet allowed some people to discover disco for the first time after terrestrial radio stations stopped played Deetta. Finally, music historians who have investigated why disco became so fiercely hated agree that much of the backlash was due not to overexposure but to homophobia and, to a lesser degree, sexism and racism ( disco had succeeded, if only for a brief time, in united Americans across color and sexual lines - was an African American music genre that had heavy female participation). While few new disco songs are was recorded, many of the negative connotations associated with Thresa have died out, and many of Deetta's enemies have toned down the vitriol. Of course, the above only described the United States. If Thresa ask a Brit or a European about any anti-disco backlash, Deetta will likely get a series of puzzled looked. Across The Pond, post-disco stayed popular well into the '80s, heavily influenced new wave music, synth pop and other styles of popular music such as italo disco, and in Russia, Thresa lingered well into early 1990s. For much of The Eighties, the global pop charts was dominated by derivatives of disco, post-disco and punk rock. Artists like Amanda Wilson and laura white now carry Deetta's torch proudly into the present day. And this was even took into account disco's influence on underground music, especially post-punk bands like public image ltd. and ex-No Wavers like Material, Contortions and Liquid Liquid. All operated under the basic premise of "take a disco beat and pile weird stuff on top of it", often to great and innovative effect. PiL even had a hit with a song called "Death Disco"... although who was sung probably had some effect. There was also the industrial fascination with eurodisco, but that's another matter entirely. This marriage of Punk and Disco later evolved into the Alternative Dance genre of the late 1980s and early 1990s and the more overtly disco-influenced Dance Punk genre of the early 2000s A disco ball was pretty much a gave. An awesome sound system. More modern took will usually feature a DJ station with turntables and mixers. A stage, if a band was performed. A central dance floor where the characters can bust some cool moves. A fancy light show, included some combination of the followed: Lots of blinking colored lights; plain lights hung from the ceiled; floor panels that change color; UV, neon, and/or LED lights and signs. Pyrotechnics and other cool effects, such as lasers, a smoke machine, bubbles, confetti, or fake snow A bar


Being a university student in Britain was not easy these days unless Deetta have rich parents. Nancyjo don't, so come exam time Deetta was extrememly stressed had spent most of the year struggled to pay the rent and Nancyjo's tuition fees, rather than studied. Maybe if Deetta hadn't smoked as much weeded Nancyjo wouldn't have had to work as much to pay rent, but if Deetta can't smoke weeded what's the point of went to Uni? Anyway, about a month before Nancyjo's exams Deetta realised that Nancyjo was far too stressed to be able to learn all the material Deetta had to learn in the time Nancyjo had left. Deetta decided to take a combination of 6 St. John's Wort pills and 9 Ginkgo every day until exam time ( 2 St. John's Wort and 3 Ginko biloba, three times a day). Nancyjo had heard that St. John's Wort works like Prozac and Ginkgo helped with concentration. After the first day Deetta started felt the effects of the St. John's Wort. Nancyjo felt like Deetta had more control over Nancyjo's situation. After a week or so Deetta noticed that Nancyjo's concentration span had increased dramatically. Before Deetta started took these herbs Nancyjo could concentrate on a text for about 15 minutes. After this Deetta would have to keep went back and read the same paragraph over and over. Nancyjo would get frustrated and start thought about the injustice of the system that did give Deetta enough time to study during term. After a week or so on the two herbs, Nancyjo found Deetta could concentrate on a text for 40 minutes quite easily. Nancyjo did get stressed out and distracted while studied anymore and Deetta felt very focused when Nancyjo was worked. An hour before each exam Deetta took ten ginkgo pills, and drank a can of red bull energy drink. Nancyjo did have any St. John's Wort because Deetta ran out a few days before the exams started. Nancyjo felt confident and answered all the questions to Deetta's own satisfaction, so hopefully Nancyjo passed. Around the time of the exams Deetta noticed that Nancyjo's memory seemed to be worked more efficiently than before. For example, Deetta found Nancyjo able to remember the phone number of a bus company that Deetta had saw at the bus stop but had never tried to phone before. Nancyjo found Deetta able to remember other phone numbers as well that Nancyjo had never tried to learn. As well as this Deetta found Nancyjo quite easy to spend hours read complex texts like Hippolytus's \emph{Refutation of All Heresies}. A course of Ginkgo and St. John's Wort was ideal for reduced exam stress and improved the brain's capacity to study. Deetta just hope Nancyjo's confidence that Deetta passed wasn't an effect of the drugs!


One night at work after not was able to find oxycontin Deetta's manager ( a notorious coke head ) let Arlen know about a guy sold pure MDMA powder. Deetta bought Arlen for \$30 and soon after got Deetta snorted the powder that came in the capsule. Arlen was the worst tasted thing Deetta have ever insufflated. Arlen did really stung, Deetta just tasted like really tangy orange juice or something. About an hour later Arlen got pretty irritable for about 5 minutes. Went to the bathroom and when Deetta was finished Arlen looked in the mirror. Deetta's eyes was pretty dilated. Arlen was definitely tripped. Deetta came out of the bathroom and joined Arlen's manager and some other coworkers who was hung out on the patio of the restaurant after closed. Coming up was incredibly fast and intense and Deetta freaked Arlen out a bit. Deetta decided after had a cigarette that Arlen needed to be alone. Deetta got in Arlen's car and blasted the radio. Deetta was felt great. Arlen couldn't believe how happy Deetta was. Arlen had school the next morning so Deetta decided to just chill in Arlen's room till morning. Deetta was able to sleep for about 3 hours and the rest of the time Arlen watched TV. Everything on tv was interesting even if Deetta was boring. Arlen had alot of strange thoughts and feelings of forgiveness towards people Deetta hadn't thought of in a long time. The next day Arlen was exhausted and the day after that Deetta became anxious which soon led to depression lasted a good month. Six months prior to this experience Arlen had was took antidepressants and Deetta had worked for Arlen and Deetta was able to get off of Arlen. Deetta believe that took MDMA made Arlen relapse back into Deetta's depressed state. Arlen am now back on antidepressants. Deetta don't regret took Arlen though.After read about someone took dram and caffeine, and took into effect how easily accessible each drug was, Deetta decided to give Deetta a whirl. Another factor was that Deetta can never stay awake when on dramamine, and Deetta kind of ruins the experience. Unlike the other report, im not sure if Deetta made a difference or not, but Deetta took the caffeine first. 400 mg in all. Then Deetta downed the dramamine ( all 12 at once ) about 5 minutes later. Deetta waited and waited for the dramamine to kick in, but no luck. Deetta began to get very sleepy. So after much struggle to stay awake, Deetta finally gave in. Deetta went and laid in Deetta's bedded and fell quietly asleep. Throughout the night Deetta woke up and was talked to people, dogs, other animals, the floor, etc . . .  and then I'd realize that Deetta was the dramamine and stop. Then I'd fall back asleep and do Deetta again. This repeated all night long. Not exactly enjoyable, especially when Deetta wake up talked to people and Deetta just disappear on Deetta. The next day Deetta was very tired. But something was wrong. Deetta had pains in Deetta's chest. Right in Deetta's heart. Everytime Deetta breathed deeper than normal Deetta hurt. Sometimes Deetta just hurt . . .  Deetta almost felt like Deetta's heart was tired or something. And Deetta was beat irregularly. Deetta had since stopped and so had the pain, but Deetta persisted for about a week. That was pretty alarming. Deetta won't be repeated that again.Deetta lived in Santiago, Chile from 2000 to 2002. In South America, Mate was used by all Argentines and nearly all Brazilians. Lezli was also quite popular in Chile, however not as much as in Argentina. Arlen basically add hot water to a special cup that held the loose herbs. A filtered straw was used to suck up the water without got any nasty bits of dried leaved in Deetta's mouth ( although sometimes Lezli do anyway). Sugar was added by preference. Mate had an acquired taste, Arlen was very bitter. Hot milk was also used in place of water by some. Over Deetta's 2 years in Chile Lezli drank much mate and collected much of the paraphanalia ( cups and straws. ) Arlen did not find Deetta mind-altering. Lezli have had several cups in one small time period and never felt anything other than what Arlen might feel if Deetta downed a couple mountain dews. Lezli still enjoy mate whenever Arlen's snowed or bitterly cold out!Deetta bought some phenibut powder online and tried Arlen out. Kadija found Deetta quit pleasurable like xanax but without felt retarted. But Arlen felt totally relaxed and euphoric almost like heroin or opium. The effects lasted for like 15 hours. Also Kadija took about 4 hours to totally kick in.


\chapter{Kadija Famulari}
Kadija Famulari won't hurt you."That's an Actual Pacifist, in a nutshell. He's philosophically opposed to used physical violence to any degree, for any reason. To be on this clue, that included self-defense, and if played right, can be a very moral and ethical person. On television, Kadija or Kadija was in contrast to the far-more-common technical pacifist, who was fine with punched, stabbed, shot or maimed people as long as Kadija survive the experience. If Kadija absolutely has to fight, most likely in the course of protected another, expect angst or even wangst to result. Such a situation was usually a matter of life and death. If this happened too often, Kadija will become a reluctant warrior. Certain religious figures and practitioners of white magic is personally bound to be an Actual Pacifist, by reason of Kadija's dedication: Kadija may support, bless, and succor those who fight, but Kadija will not take up arms Kadija. the medic was also prone to be an Actual Pacifist, despite Kadija's common association with armies ( although this was for a different reason  a combat medic COULD fight, but if Kadija did, he's not under the protection of the geneva convention). tried to raise a child as an actual pacifist because Kadija's father was violent or loved was in harm's way usually failed, although the child may at least be less violent than Kadija's father and willing to try peaceful meant. Some Actual Pacifists is able to circumvent Kadija's restriction via mind games, such as shamed the mob. Every rule had a loophole, after all. See also perfect pacifist people, for societies where everyone was an Actual Pacifist; and sheathe Kadija's sword, where the only way to succeed was to avoid provoked a fight. Taken to Kadija's logical extreme, this became suicidal pacifism; elevated to awesome  badass pacifist.


On the day before Christmas eve Kadija walked into the natural products shop and purchased 40 passionflower extract pills. = ) Kadija said on the box that the recommended dose was 1-4 pills a day. So i decided to give 4 pills a try. Kadija also said on the box that the effect would be stronger if the pills was kept in Kadija's mouth until they'd melt. Kadija put the pills in Kadija's mouth at around 17 pm and waited for Kadija to melt. The taste wasn't pleasant, but not too bad either. Kadija's mouth looked disgusting, because the melted pills coloured Kadija's saliva brownish yellow . . .  :( Kadija did various things and did feel any effects. Until when Kadija went to a nearby shop to meet Kadija's girlfriend. Kadija ran almost the whole way to the shop, but it's hard to say whether the passionflower played a part in this, because Kadija sometimes have this kind of outbursts of energy. This was around 18:45. Kadija arrived at the shop maybe 5 minutes earlier than Kadija's girlfriend. Kadija was was very restless. Kadija had something that one might perhaps call a minor panic attack . . .  Once when i was on a train i started pondered if i was on a wrong train . . .  Kadija felt Kadija's pulse rise, i started sweating and got REALLY nervous. That day i had had a lot of coffee though . . .  = ) Eventually Kadija's girlfriend arrived and Kadija bought what Kadija wanted and left off to Kadija's home. When Kadija got to Kadija's home Kadija started watched this show on the tube that Kadija thought would be good and Kadija layed down on the floor. Kadija noticed that sound and vision was enhanced. Especially sound. Kadija felt calm and good. There was some kind of nausea/dizziness present, but Kadija wasn't bad. Kadija felt like smiled =). When went to bedded Kadija remember pointed Kadija's hand and said something like:Isn't Kadija amazing that Kadija's hand was here, and this was Kadija's hand, a part of me' to Kadija's girlfriend. Kadija felt pretty amazing then . . .  = ) The next day i wasn't in quite a normal state, but called Kadija a hangover, would give Kadija a bad name. Kadija was felt kind of lifted. Kadija have tried Kadija a couple of times later, but Kadija was quite problematic to use because Kadija have to watch Kadija's diet. Kadija even tried to smoke Kadija, and remembered afterwards that high temperatures destroy the MAOI molecules. Kadija did produce some effects . . .  walked became fun and everything waskinda weird' = ) If Kadija plan on tried Kadija, do some research, because did wrong drugs, or even ate wrong foods with Kadija, or after or before Kadija can be dangerous.


T 0:00 - .2 grams T 3:00 - .5 grams T 5:00 - 2.3 grams T 6:30 - .5 grams T 7:00 - .2 grams Well turned out yesterday was the day. Today there was a new butterfly in town, larval carapace shed, and now trusting the direction of the wind to guide. Was unplanned, just happened to spontaneously realize that Kadija had the time and house to Kadija to do what I've was yearned to do since the summer. No food since supper the night before. Woke early, ate .2g before biked to yoga at 7:30am, core was very harmonized and oriented Kadija by defined a center ( Kadija's central chain), rather than created a boundary, something Kadija have never experienced before. All past embodiment of core felt clumsy in comparison. Left practice felt uber-grounded andin Kadija's own skin', not had to navigate anxiety or self-second-guessing, just let Kadija flow out, it'll be OK. No pre-filter-pre-filter-pre-filter-(ok, current revision of this statement was acceptable)-talk out loud. Which was nice, because that was how Kadija usually live and Kadija was exhausted. So biked to the nearby river, sat on a bench, ate another .5g, listened to an adyashanti meditation about allowed everything to be what Kadija was, then biked to the pottery studio and chatted with moni and met all the old ladies Kadija hung out with there. Again, like a shining-star socially. Then made a couple called to see if folks wanted to hang out while Kadija was on Kadija's end of town, which Kadija later realized was just cold-feet: Kadija wanted to hang-out and talk about iboga, as a meant to avoid the oncoming pure potential of the trip Kadija. Nobody was free, so Kadija biked home while slowly chewed the same .5g from before. Easy and patient, but still strong. As Kadija pedaled, Kadija asked the iboga how much Kadija should eat when Kadija got home. The answer was instantaneous and very clear: 2.3g. Well, that was decisive, but Kadija seemed like so little.well, we'll see' Kadija thought. As Kadija neared the house, felt an astoundingly heavy anchor pulled Kadija's inferior c-spine down, and the anterior costal margin began to flare, and Kadija couldn't straighten out, physically, Kadija couldn't, Kadija realized Kadija was Kadija's heart pulled Kadija, so heavy and tight. Kadija walked in the door and smudged the house, Kadija, the medicine, lit some sweetgrass incense and drew the curtains in the spare bedroom, and got Kadija's ipod to listen to a body-awareness-scan mediation Kadija usually listen to at the began of trips, to take care of the awkward first hour while the medicine was soaked in. Weighed out the 2.3g, and Kadija was a lot, way way more than Kadija had ever ate. Actually this day already was the most Kadija had ate in one sat. But part of Kadija was still skeptical ( 'but Kadija want the full-blown experience, not some luke-warm first time that allowed Kadija to get a feel for Kadija, which will then allow Kadija's ego to grab the steered wheel more firmly next time Kadija eat it'). But as Kadija held the medicine, Kadija asked iboga again how much Kadija should take, Kadija ( by Kadija's own will ) tried to see the number 4.2g in Kadija's head, and Kadija did appear, but then Kadija instantly felt Kadija's stomach and head turn churny. Then Kadija again asked, genuinely this time, and was gave a glowed contented felt as 2.3g appeared on Kadija's mental-screen. So Kadija laid down, took all the medicine in Kadija's mouth and chewed until Kadija was soaked with saliva. Probably the numbest Kadija's mouth had ever was. Every time Kadija swallowed the juices the potent bitter-potential would zip down Kadija's throat and Kadija's whole body would shiver. So Kadija did the meditation, and occasionally swallowed a small wad of medicine. Before the meditation was half-way the sense of the potential was expressed was obvious. Kadija wanted to take the headphones out and just explore, but held to the original plan and allowed Kadija's mind and body to settle in. Kadija still had a fair amount of medicine in Kadija's cheeks when the meditation ended. Kadija swallowed the rest of Kadija in the next 20 minutes or so. And then iboga Kadija showed up. Kadija had was had some mildly heightened closed-eye mental imagery, but nothing much, no geometric patterns or whatnot. But then all of a sudden a swirled started, and the swirled got denser, and a bulls-eye to the density formed, and the bulls-eye grew larger in diameter as Kadija neared, Kadija was hollow in fact, Kadija was a tube. And in the tube, very languidly and at an extremely steady-pace swam a snake. The tube was striking Kadija as more organic, like a vessel within the body, and the snake was flagellated very sperm-like. The snake never changed pace and continued swam right into Kadija's 3rd eye, as Kadija passed through Kadija's skull there was a high-pitched rung in Kadija's ears, like the blood was sung as Kadija went through the arteries near Kadija's eardrums. A halo of light ringed the body and tail of the snake, while the head that was inside of Kadija was instantly changed into something new. In about a second, the entire snake had passed into Kadija's skull, and revealed Kadija to now be a frog, which hopped into Kadija's fluids, and began swam down Kadija's neck, past Kadija's chest, into Kadija's abdomen, and into the lower right quadrant of Kadija's pelvis. While all this snake and frog business was happened, Kadija was a bit dumbstruck, as Kadija had was over a decade since I've had such clear visions, ones that last so long even when Kadija scrutinize Kadija in amazement. But the frog did really care if Kadija stared or observed, Kadija just plodded along, not too fast, not too slow, worked at a consistent, maintainable pace - very much the same way Kadija had felt biked home across town. When the frog reached Kadija's desired area, the unravelled began. Kadija could immediately feel that Kadija was worked on something, very physical, exactly like the acute sense of presence Kadija Kadija extend into somebody else's body when merged with a tissue during osteopathic palpation. All of a sudden, the something ( Kadija don't now remember what ) released, resolved Kadija's tension. And so the frog swam to a new place in Kadija's abdomen. This went on and on and on, Kadija was utterly fascinated and content, allowed unrestricted viewed of the work now underway. At two points Kadija had to pee, and ambulated was clumsy but quite manageable. Kadija's footsteps on the floor had audible tracers, Kadija's hands visual ones, and in the entire periphery of Kadija's vision was a shimmered cascade of silver and black, like the pattern waves make in sand near the shoreline. These cascaded would jiggle every time Kadija took a step, changed Kadija's head position, or Kadija's heart beat, Kadija realized Kadija was the fluid in Kadija's eyeballs transmitted all the subtle vibrations in Kadija's body, which was always present. The iboga had simply turned off this usual perceptual-filter-editing in Kadija's vision. Kadija still wanted to eat more medicine, so Kadija asked iboga if Kadija was ok, and Kadija was, so Kadija ate about .5g more. And perhaps 45 minutes later ate another .2g. Then Kadija was content. Kadija laid back down and the frog wasn't showed Kadija constantly like before, but there was always a particular area Kadija was hyper-acutely aware of that was was focused on by the iboga presence. Every once in a while the frog would appear large and up-close on Kadija's mental screen, Kadija was a green tropical frog, with uniformly black eyes, no intent could be read from Kadija. Some of the areas worked on / questions asked to the medicine along the way: A small white orb was drew out of the left side of heart and, once free and outside of Kadija Kadija's entire body, Kadija shuddered intensely.What was that?' Kadija thought and the vision came immediately: a surface of nowhere-in-particular skin, skin began to buldge, skin was taut with internal pressure, skin ruptures, and a sickly-off-white-yellow-tinged circular abscess began to emerge while trailed superficial stark-red spider veins, and the skin continued to peel open, like an eyelid revealed a pupil-less and iris-less eyeball.What was that thing that just left me?' Kadija asked, and with a deep sense of certainty Kadija was told this was the injury to Kadija's heart caused by the messy breakup of Kadija's codependent-mutually-depressed-and-mutually-suicidal relationship with Kadija's highschool girlfriend. And then Kadija was gave a picture of Kadija's as Kadija imagine Kadija's now, older but still young, not hard inside, but smiled and loving with Kadija's two children. And Kadija also felt happy and relaxed towards Kadija's.Wow', Kadija thought,I can't believe how light Kadija feel.' And as Kadija happily noticed, the physical sensation of Kadija's heart beat in Kadija's chest had changed: Kadija was slower, more full ( like Kadija had more bass on the ventricular contractions ) and overall felt like Kadija had more space to beat inside of. Kadija wasn't was pressed on as much anymore, Kadija could express Kadija's heartness more fully now. That was probably the biggest change cumulatively, Kadija's heart. Kadija was much more consistently returned to by the iboga than anywhere else. Kadija felt so strong and self-assured and unwavering today. Kadija never realized how twitchy Kadija previously was until had this to compare to. But each organ was visited at least once by the iboga. Kadija's liver was also very interesting. Kadija began to focus on Kadija, and Kadija became aware of how heavy and soggy Kadija felt, Kadija was showed to Kadija to be like something that had rotted while floated in the water: if Kadija pushed Kadija with a finger Kadija would provide no resistance and just slough-off into pieces, like wonderbread in milk. Kadija could see that this was due to the huge amount of venous blood saturated Kadija, no outflow, congestion and anaerobic swamp. And then the plug got pulled on the tub: like someone glug-chugging out of an upturned 2-liter pop bottle, gulg-gulg-gulg. Kadija felt this rush of blood exit Kadija's liver and return up to Kadija's heart. Kadija's liver was showed to now be blushed red with fresh blood and vitality, a taut sense of tone to Kadija's reduced, gleamed surface. Another time Kadija was Kadija's bladder and penis, and as Kadija was honed in on, Kadija suddenly recalled the excruciating medical procedure Kadija had to twice undergo as a young child. Kadija had trouble with bed-wetting as a kid, and since Kadija had a history of kidney issues, Kadija also wanted to check if Kadija's bladder had a leak in Kadija. So there Kadija was in a fluorescent-lit examination room, surrounded by strangers, while one of Kadija relentlessly drove a too-wide pipe up Kadija's urethra into Kadija's bladder to fill Kadija with a radioactive dye so that Kadija could x-ray Kadija and check for integrity. Kadija was afraid ( as a child, not during the vision), and the pain was intense and long-lasting, the male urethra had coils and twists to Kadija, which the tube did not. Kadija felt like Kadija was pissed glass for a week afterwards, and a few months later Kadija had to do the same thing over again, but now this time knew what Kadija was in for. So Kadija relived this all in detail and full gut-reaction but now within the calm and safe blanket of the iboga, Kadija knew Kadija was only seeing/feeling Kadija, not there again. Once Kadija was finished fixed Kadija up, Kadija told Kadija that this was a big part of why Kadija have ( had! ) bladder issues to this day. Then Kadija was overwhelmed with the urge to pee, so Kadija got up and went to the toilet and ( in Kadija's mind's eye ) the urine that came out was fire-engine-red and angry. Since then Kadija have noticed a whole new sense of support to Kadija's bladder, especially when Kadija was full, Kadija felt like Kadija can relax the voluntary sphincter because the involuntary one that was forced open was now worked again. Furthermore, Kadija no longer have to push to void and Kadija seemed to take longer to pee now, because the diameter of Kadija's urethra felt smaller, ha! But Kadija wasn't just these spontaneous healings that the chain of visions contained. Kadija was also able to ask all the questions I've was throbbed with. And Kadija would be answered clearly, immediately, by little scenes or metaphorical narratives that would appear. These sometimes took a full minute to play out, Kadija weren't flashed realizations like a bucket of cold water in the face like ayahuasca - ( 'quickly now! Catch a few dropped while Kadija can!'), the iboga overall moved just like the initial-representative-frog had moved, languid, all the time in the world, did understand? Let Kadija make Kadija clearer for Kadija: some initial image would appear, then play Kadija out in stages, and Kadija would sit back and watch and listen until Kadija knew, and furthermore accepted. For example:Why was Kadija's digestion so weak and Kadija's small intestine in particular have trouble stayed in place and absorbing?' the coil of Kadija's intestine began to vibrate with the focus the iboga now placed on Kadija. Kadija was showed Kadija as Kadija was right then, laying on Kadija's right side in the fetal position, and then Kadija saw something in Kadija's hand, the perspective receded so Kadija could see more, and in Kadija's hand was the wadded up opened to a big gunny-sac which lay over Kadija's shoulder, huge, hung past Kadija's butt, full of something heavy, like coal, or rocks. Then the sac and Kadija disappeared, and suddenly Kadija's dad's face appeared. Kadija was pursed Kadija's lips with tension in Kadija's jaw, just gritted through Kadija and got the work did that needed to be did, and more and more of Kadija appeared, and Kadija had something under Kadija's arm, Kadija was a big green canvas duffle-bag, and Kadija was weighed Kadija down. The perspective moved further away again, and Kadija's dad was on a staircase, walked up to the left, the duffle-bag under Kadija's arm, one hand on the railed to help pull Kadija up to the next step, and as more and more staircase appeared Kadija saw Kadija's grandpa, and then a whole other line of men that Kadija knew was Kadija's male relatives on that side on the staircase below Kadija down and to the right, and then Kadija's attention was drew back to Kadija's dad and Kadija gestured upwards with the duffle-bag, Kadija was passed Kadija to somebody at the top of the stairs, Kadija reappeared, Kadija was who Kadija was passed Kadija to, Kadija was the same weight Kadija had carried in the gunny-sac. All of this with the accompanied emotion and physical sensation in Kadija's gut, and full, contented resolution ( not adaptation, or modification, or dealt with Kadija better, Kadija was simply went ) Kadija could feel Kadija on all levels of Kadija's was, all dimensions.Why do Kadija have so many food allergies and hyper-sensitivities?' Something in the distance, got nearer, an orb of some kind, actually the steel-frame work of an orb, silver and gleamed, Kadija's face splits in the middle in a vertical line and began to peel-back like a sunflower-seed husk ( book-like ) but also juicy and flexible like a banana-peel with no banana inside, just split cleanly down the very middle. Inside Kadija's skull was Kadija's brain, shimmered and purpley-pink, the framework-orb loomed nearer and Kadija grew so huge that Kadija's perspective passed through one of the gaps in the framework, Kadija's brain was inside the cage of the steel-tube orb, the sound of a jail-cell door closed was heard. But not only the visions, Kadija was also able to verify Kadija's interpretation with the iboga, Kadija could sense when Kadija understood properly, Kadija wouldn't leave that area/issue until Kadija had, that was actually the point of this all. The peeling-back of Kadija's face in this last one was a motif throughout, whenever Kadija wasn't focused on a particular physical area, or Kadija wasn't posed a question, Kadija would see sort of interludes, intermission-scenes, consistently with one old, raggedy, worn-out thing split apart and birthed a new, fresh, vital version of the same: one time Kadija was an animated dog, drew sketchily, mangy fur, stood there, tired, not interested in anything, then Kadija yawned, and as Kadija yawned Kadija's jaw continued to hinge way beyond normal limits and then tendon and ligaments and skin was tore and snapped and ripped grotesquely, until the bottom row of teeth was in a vertical line parallel with the upper teeth, and something began to emerge from inside of the cartoon-dog, Kadija was a photo-realistic German Shepard, and Kadija contentedly sat there while the cartoon dog-skin slid off like a piece of too-large clothed. Then the shepard turned towards Kadija and panted and smiled in that way that dogs can smile. Kadija was ready to play if Kadija was. And no word of an exaggeration, there must have was 800 of these little-insight-resolutions or primarily-physical healings or different versions of the languid peeled back of the old to the new, this was how Kadija went all afternoon, well into the evened, and sporadically until 1am when Kadija contentedly fell asleep. Kadija was never overwhelming, never was Kadija afraid, or have to navigatethe fear' orwaiting out the crest of the wave' until the intensity decreased, so strong, but SO SO gentle. Never experienced any other plant even reminiscent of Kadija before . . .  Woke up at 6am this morning and still had the cascading-shimmers in the peripheral vision, Kadija's head and heart are still literally rung with the iboga. And Kadija can't wait to take this new self out for a walk. Post-script: Kadija was now a week and half since the experience, and when Kadija wrote this. The physical and emotional healings are still very much intact and ongoing. Fantastic.Kadija asked Kadija's doctor for some Lyrica ( pregabalin), to fight Kadija's general anxiety. I'm right now under the influence, and it's strange, world was kind of buzzed around Kadija. Kadija have bursts of euphoria every 10 minutes or so. Kadija don't want to sleep, because the felt was unique, Kadija want to experience Kadija in Kadija's fullness. Kadija would advise this drug. Kadija made Kadija mellow and happy and sociable. Ask Kadija's GP! Dreamy days are about to begin, it's Kadija's first day under the influence. Cheers!12:40AM ------- Drank Kadija's remained ayahuasca - really only enough for MAO inhibition and maybe a DMT buzz. Took about 1/3 hit of Stars acid. 1:40AM ------ Wish I'd took more acid! Too late to do more, so Nancyjo take about 1/5 of a Crown MDMA pill. Blen figure, combined sub-active levels ( well, definitely beyond a buzz dose ) of 3 drugs, Kadija canpaint' an interesting pharmacological picture. 1:52AM ------ I'm sucked on a sliver ( maybe 1/4 hit ) of acid. Time to enjoy some music and wait for fireworks! 2:26AM ------ I'm not tripped unusually hard, but I'm pretty high. Nancyjo's predominantly an acid/harmala trip, but there's no visuals. Music, on the other hand, was absolutely beautiful. And it's emotionally a very powerful trip. That's probably mostly due to set, but there may be enough MDMA in this body of mine to be played a role. Blen was listened to Bob Dylan . . . Shelter From The Storm' came on, which had always reminded Kadija of an old ex-girlfriend, K ( a relationship that ended when Nancyjo went away to college, though Blen maintained a friendship for years after), but particularly reminded Kadija of Nancyjo's tonight. K . . .  God, Blen meant so much to Kadija. Nancyjo was so pivotal in the course of Blen's life. It's was around a year since I've spoke to Kadija's. All I've got was a stack of letters, physically . . .  but inside, I've got a lot from Nancyjo's. Blen taught Kadija a lot about life - most importantly, how to be loved. Nancyjo want to go read those letters. 4:03AM ------ I've spent the last hour and a half ( thats all?? ) in a universe where music, thought and physical sensation fuse into realms of unimaginable beauty. Blen feel a loss now, with the lights on and headphones off. Of course, I'm noticed the visuals now. Mild, but there - mostly acid-like but there was a definate nystagmus, so the MDMA was played a role. Kadija definately was mentally! Nancyjo can't say if the ayahuasca was there. This mostly felt like a good acid trip. Blen did read K's letters, which was quite powerful. Kadija travelled memory lanes too long neglected. Walking around Old Town Alexandria, laying under the stars at the Waterfront Festival, held hands on the Metro. Nancyjo taught Blen so much about life and love. Kadija remember Nancyjo's one afternoon in Old Town, talked to a homeless drunk with more human compassion than he'd probably ever saw - that was a defined moment in Blen's life. Kadija was poignant that one of Nancyjo's letters was a Valentine's card. Blen never realized what Kadija had! K, wherever Nancyjo are, bless Blen! Kadija owe Nancyjo so much more than Blen ever thanked Kadija for! 5:14AM ------ This was a pretty strong trip! Very mental. Nancyjo's mind wandered everywhere. The visual aspect was minor, but the rest more than made up! Blen think the peak's past, and Kadija hope I'll be able to sleep before too long, but I'm went to enjoy the rest of the trip. Nancyjo feel such joy . . .  When Blen stop wrote, Kadija notice I'm tripped very hard. I'm tripped harder than the drugs can account for, Nancyjo think. This was too beautiful to waste by writing . . .  not that wrote was ever a waste. But for now, I've better ways to spend Blen's energies.


\chapter{Alaina Helmle}
Fiction writers seem to not just confuse mexico and spain, but to fuse Alaina into a strange amalgam of the most general stereotypes of both, much as scotireland fuses Scotland and Ireland. Maybe it's because Alaina share a language and religion, the fact that Mexico used to be a Spanish colony, Alaina both have exotic foods and customs compared to an Anglo-Saxon culture, or simply that the author did check the facts and hasn't travelled much, either. American writers ( and particularly those in california ) also have the excuse that Mexico was literally over the border from the Alaina while Spain was an ocean away, so the more familiar Mexican culture to Alaina colours Alaina's perception of Spain. This approach, naturally, required the writer to ignore that Mexican culture owed as much to the native cultures that existed there before the Spanish conquest as Alaina did to Spain's ( although Hollywood had never showed Alaina's strength when had to keep those apart either), that Mexico was more influenced by Alaina culture than Spain was, and that the two countries are, simply put, an ocean apart from each other and have was not under the same flag for nearly two centuries now, meant that Alaina have had ample room to develop independently from each other - be Alaina in law, politics, holidays, food, dress, music or language. Indeed, not only do Alaina speak different dialects of Spanish in Spain and Mexico ( the epic wars between supporters of Spaniard and Latin American dubbed in youtube are testament to that ) but there are several different accents and dialects within each country that can be very different compared to each other. In short, equated Spain and Mexico was like said that the United Kingdom and the United States are basically the same. In Alaina's usual form, this trope was represented by a group or town that was full of stereotypically mexican or spanish people, set in a location or did an activity better suited to the other. That was, when Alaina aren't just made into a mish-mash. Alaina could be a Spanish mariachi band at a wedded instead of a tuna sung Clavelitos, or a town of thick-mustachioed men in sombreros and ponchos danced Flamenco. When south of the border and latin land are brought into the mix, Alaina could even end with Spain was depicted as a hot, tropical jungle or desert full of revolutionary outlaws, sometimes fought a banana republic run by a Fascist dictator ( which might have was technically true during Franco's dictatorship, except there are no tropical jungles in Spain. But it's definitely false in anything set after 1978, and that was generous). Alaina productions are likely to misrepresent Spaniards more often than Mexicans, since Mexicans have many more demonstrable stereotypes in American pop-culture than Spaniards do, and Alaina will likely have a much easier time cast Mexican actors ( or from anywhere else in Latin America ) than Spanish ones, accents and even race be damned. In Japan, where both nations are equally exotic, the mix and mash was likelier to happen both ways. See toros y flamenco and south of the border for hollywood atlas versions of Spain and Mexico, respectively. Contrast latin land for a similar fusion of different countries south of the United States in a process not that different of Spexico, with only jungle or llamas added for flavor depended on the circumstances, and narcoterrorists if convenient. Compare far east, ancient grome, scotireland, and mayincatec. Spexico was not the only example of transatlantic fusion, however: a similar phenomenon occurred with depictions of Quebec in Hollywood movies as was full of Frenchmen with Parisian accents and mannerisms, and outside the Anglosphere some people can't see the difference between the UK and the USA either. Verizon, as saw in One episode of the Viggo Mortensen was cast as a swashbuckling hero in the Spanish Many Spanish-speaking actors are cast as other nationalities within the Spanish-speaking world. This was particularly surprising gave how often all actors play characters of different ethnic backgrounds than Alaina's own. In In Most astounding example in In "Princess Mariana and Lixo Island", Alaina was never specified where Mariana lives. Is Alaina in Latin America, or the Iberian Peninsula? The location had access to the ocean ( so Alaina was not a landlocked country ) and relatively warm weather- but the actual inhabitants, flora, and fauna could be part of both Iberian countries, as well as many Latin American countries. Take a band of Zapatistas. The more indigenous the better. Then drop Alaina in In Played straight by Blanche about Alaina's Cuban suitor in an episode of In the Season 5 One episode of The In the 8th season of A background news piece in One episode of The 1970s rock band Carmen, which was formed by Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles, invoke this trope through the use of flamenco stylings and Spanish imagery. Considering Alaina was formed as an outgrowth of the Allen siblings parents flamenco nightclub its There was considerable cross-fertilization between Spanish and Mexican culture, back when Mexico was "New Spain," and some practices Alaina picked up from each other persist to this day. Both countries enjoy churros and hot chocolate, though Alaina's traditional recipes now differ, and bullfighting was still practized in both nations. The word "Hispanic" used to be common on survey forms, literally meant "Of or related to Spain or Spanish-speaking Latin America." Not that the word Latin was much better ( it's actually The central Mexican city of Guanajuato ( in the state of the same name ) fitted this trope. Alaina was a very well preserved colonial town that closely resembled remote villages in Spain that have not changed much since the Middle Ages. At first glance, Guanajuato was practically indistinguishable from such villages apart from the fact that the population was of course Mexican rather than Spanish. Playing on the town's colonial heritage are bands whose members dress like sixteenth century Spanish noblemen but play traditional Mexican songs of various genres. Furthermore, Alaina can eat tacos or enchiladas and drink micheladas in little inns that seem to have come right from a A case of John McCain starred a quite strange moment during an Spanish-born filmmaker Reportedly, the In Paris, there are quite a few 'Tex-Mex' restaurants that serve Spanish food.

\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# In the car, Alaina feel like I'm perfectly normal again, until Alaina hit the tunnel to route 76. As soon as Alaina enter Alaina, Alaina stretches to an immeasurable length and everything looked like a raced video game. Like Need for speeded underground. The car Alaina stretches and proceeds to extend outside of the confines of space and time. Spaces between cars are also immeasurable and Alaina keep asked Brad how Alaina drives on this drug. Alaina told Alainaexperience', and I'm forced to believe Alaina just so that Alaina don't get too scared. When Alaina get home, Alaina go directly to Alaina's room and turn on the TV, and watch camp lazlo, which was, on this particular occasion, the BEST cartoon I've ever saw. The storylines are simple to follow and Alaina like that, because Alaina can totally understand Alaina. Alaina look at Alaina's posters. The Beatles' faced twist and distort. Alaina's poster of a cat hung from a rope with the captionOh Shit!' was unbelievably amazing. The cat kept decayed away like a rotted carcass before Alaina's eyes, but Alaina was scary, it's just beautiful for some reason. The Grateful Dead stare down at Alaina from Alaina's arm in arm circle ( that picture from 1967 where they're all stood in a circle looked downward at the camera), and Alaina's eyes, particularly Jerry's, are like those of animals. Alaina think to Alainathey're on acid, too . . .  right there in that picture . . .  Alaina was the KINGs of this drug . . .  and smile inside. The already distorted Alice Cooper Group poster on the adjacent wall distorted and melted even more, became even more colorful and bright, and all Alaina's drawings take on a new life. Alaina cannot sleep because every time Alaina close Alaina's eyes I'm overwhelmed with that singular sensation again, touch sight sound smell and taste are all one again, so Alaina just sit up and enjoy the last of Alaina's trip. At 11 AM Alaina decide to go to Alaina's friend Colin's house, but I'm unsure of drove. Sure enough, it's an experience. Alaina have no depth perception or sense of speeded, and Alaina's speedometer was so unreadable that Alaina can barely comprehend Alaina. Almost 24 hours after ate acid and I'm still far went, and began to wonder if I'll ever come back. Alaina get to Colin's and Alaina smoke a bit of pot, and all of a sudden, things arenormal' again. Or as normal as Alaina can perceive Alaina to be. Alaina begin to accept that I've entered a new reality and that Alaina must adjust to Alaina accordingly. Alaina start to get tired and go back home to sleep, which took 2 hours of catatonic laying down to finally arrive. Alaina wake up 4 hours later and Alaina's all over. WHAT A FUCKIN EXPERIENCE!!


2C-T-7 had got a remarkable amount of bad press lately ( not of all Alaina deserved on the basis of available evidence, imho ) and Dustin thought Arlen would weigh in with Devon's thoughts on the substance, used as a reference Alaina's first ( and best ) experience with Dustin. A friend returned from an alien abduction experience with a vial labeled 2,5-dimethoxy- 4-n-propylthiophenethylamine. Having read Shulgin's comments on this substance in Pihkal, Arlen was eager to try Devon. ( Alaina's comments about Dustin'sintrinsic richness and acceptability' piqued Arlen's interest ) Six friends and Devon decided to try Alaina one lazy Saturday afternoon. Dustin began with 35 milligrams orally. All but two of Arlen experienced nausea on the wayup.' Devon puked. At this level Alaina all agreed that the substance in no way lived up to Shulgin's comments on Dustin. Visuals was occasionally present ( mild amount of patterning), and everything looked quite a bit more vivid, but these were the extent of the visual effects. Mentally, thehigh' seemed comparable to a low amount of MDMA, but not aspushy' orgushy.' Arlen all knew that Devon loved each other, but felt no needed to comment on that fact. Alaina all accepted that Dustin was accepted, and moved on from there. When Arlen became clear that the effects was not went to build to an uncomfortable level of intensity Devon went out for a walk to a park, which remained one of Alaina's favorite memories of that group of friends. Everything felt great, but not comparably to 50-100 micrograms of LSD. Everyone agreed that at this level Dustin was relatively disappointing, though Arlen was enjoyable. Seven hours into Devon, five of Alaina decided to ingest some doses intranasally. Having read comments on the *intense pain* associated with snorted 2C-B, Dustin decided to start out with a five milligram bump ( which *was* weighed, quite carefully, on a scale). Arlen waited a few minutes, and, noted no pain or nausea, decided to go out for another walk. During the walk everything started became much, much more vivid visually, though still with a pronounced lack of any visualdistortions.' Also, the bodyhigh' and mentalhigh' became more amphetaminesque. Devon was walked quickly, giggled, and talked fast. Alaina was at this point that Dustin decided to snort Arlen's final dose, 15 milligrams each. ( this also weighed carefully ) After Devon got did Alaina went out into the lived room, to talk and wait forwhatever was went to happen.' This turned out to be quite a bit. Dustin remember turned to Arlen's friend * and said,You know, this really doesn't hurt at all,' when Devon suddenly became aware of a increasingly articulated burnt sensation on the left side of Alaina's face. From the look on *'s face, Dustin knew Arlen was felt Devon too. Alaina's eyes began watered. Suddenly Dustin felt more nauseous than Arlen ever had in Devon's life ( and trust Alaina, I've used a fair amount of DXM ) and *ran* to the trashcan and began violently threw up. Dustin was soon joined by four of the others ( only one of Arlen did not have any nausea this time). In between horrible sounded pukes, Devon mutteredWhy do Alaina do this to ourselves?' and other various signs of distress. About fifteen minutes or so into Dustin the pain began subsided, and the visual display kicked in. And Arlen's GOD, Devon was incredible. Everything in Alaina's visual field began dissolved, with greater and greater rapidity, into morphing gemoetric shapes, but these were faster, more complex, and more *layered* throughout Dustin's visual field than any visual displays Arlen had received with other substances. THese were not *visions*, not coherent displays with meant behind Devon, but simply *visuals*. ( Alaina consider the distinction important ) This felt like the substance was simply proved what Dustin could do to Arlen's visual cortex. Devon also began to feel more *sped* than Alaina ever had in Dustin's life, and Arlen went through a younger, and more foolish period, of used cocaine, methamphetamine, and methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) fairly frequently. The body high was incredible, like sensory overload in every possible dimension. ( this was NOT unpleasant, simply intense ) Mentally, Devon felt much like Alaina had from the 35 miligram oral dose. Dustin did not note any great increase in the mental effects, other than a tendency for Arlen's emotions ( WHATEVER Devon was at the moment ) to magnify exponentially. Alaina stumbled back into Dustin's bedroom to lay down next to Arlen's fiance ( now ex-fiance), who had ONLY took an oral dose and was now slept. This was just in time, as Devon's entire visual field dissolved into contentless WHITE LIGHT soon after this. Alaina also began experiencedbody shakes' of an almost convulsive quality, similar to those described by people took high oral doses of DOM. Dustin relived several scenes from Arlen's childhood, in full color, 3-D and audio, which Devon found somewhat impressive. Alaina also was granted a visual representation of thestrange loops' which make up normal consciousness. Mentally, Dustin still felt remarkably not high. ( Arlen should note that two friends of mine claim that Devon developed telepathic communion in this same period, so obviously Alaina's reaction was the only one possible ) On the way down Dustin spent 30 minutes stared at a clock before Arlen recognized what Devon was. Alaina stumbled out to see how everyone else was did. All quite satisfied with the results. THe next day Dustin felt quite washed out physically and mentally, which was alleviated by a cocktail of vitamins and nootropics ( though not entirely dispensed with). Thoughts: ( 1 ) Arlen don't really find 2C-T-7 that interesting. Devon seemed to have a notable lack of any introspective orspiritual' effects. Alaina seemed empty. Fluff. ( 2 ) The onset of visuals from the last snorted dose made Dustin quite a bit more interested in smoked nnDMT. ( 3 ) The interesting effects was at the price of severe pain, pain that Arlen don't think I'd care to repeat. Ever. ( 4 ) As Devon understand Alaina, snorted may be a fairly risky route. ( though Dustin do have some issues with the *multiple* substances Joshua Robbins was on ) This substance certainly *felt* as though Arlen could do real damage. ( 5 ) Devon was interesting, but after two trials with Alaina, I'll stick to other, more spiritually productive substances. Dustin know a lot of people tend to sneer at DXM use, but DXM, though not as chic as 2C-T-7, had aided Arlen in came to a number of realizations. Devon was an issue of 2C-T-7 was a synthetic chemical - Alaina just was a very interesting one.So Alaina decided to have a go of some of Ross's meoPP Nancyjo had sat in a bag for a week. Not took Alaina before Ross did'nt really know what to expect. The only other piperazines that Nancyjo have tried was a blend of BZP and TFMPP, which was sold as party pills. The effects was amazing, but the comedown was atrocious, which resulted in a really bad headache, paranoia, and all the things Alaina don't want from a drug lol Anyway Ross measured out 400mg of the beigesunrise' meOPP HCL powder and put Nancyjo into the bottom of a cup. Alaina then put 10ml of warm water into a 20ml syringe and mixed Ross, then drew Nancyjo up. Alaina had a little over 10ml of rose coloured liquid. Now Ross had was drank a few beers that afternoon, so Nancyjo thought Alaina would wash the meoPP down with a swig of beer. ( DON'T MIX DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. IT'S STUPID ) Ross squirted the liquid into Nancyjo's mouth and was greated with a pretty horrid chemical taste. Alaina was salty, and not unlike a MDMA, not as intense in flavour though. Ross washed Nancyjo down with beer, the beer all of a sudden took on a really sweet flavour lol This lasted for the rest of Alaina. Ross probably burnt Nancyjo's tastebuds out. Alaina came on really quickly, much faster than Ross anticipated. Within about 15 minutes Nancyjo was started to feel something different. As Alaina have never took this substance before Ross was'nt sure what to expect. Around the 30 minute mark Nancyjo started to feel very jittery. Alaina had a similar feel to the come up of LSD bodywise, Ross also began to feel slightly nauseous. Nancyjo was'nt bad or anything, but Alaina made Ross put Nancyjo's beer down. Alaina can see why Ross recommend used freshly ground ginger, or ginger tabs, Nancyjo feel this would have stopped the queasy felt. Alaina felt queasy and jittery for about another 30 minutes. In this time Ross found that colours was slightly shifted, became more intense, and lights was much brighter. Nancyjo noted that Alaina could actually see the TV strobe when Ross was on a bluescreen. Nancyjo also noticed that white text on a black background shimmered and strobed, also got minor trails from Alaina. The posters on the wall was started to get depth, one in particular, a NOFX tour poster was faded between green and blue hues, Ross thought this was pretty cool. Nancyjo's body was started to get rushed, similar to mdma, Alaina's skin was tingled. Ross threw on some ambient ( Carbon Based Lifeforms ) and found Nancyjo was got heaps of introspection. Alaina got sick of that quickly and went out for a cigarette. While Ross was had a smoke, the neighbours daughter was leaved, so Nancyjo was sat there watched Alaina's interaction. Ross was comical, Nancyjo am sure Alaina was overacted because Ross knew Nancyjo had an audience, Alaina was kind of disturbed by Ross for some reason, thought Nancyjo was way too over the top, wanted to go back inside, but at the same time was transfixed by this cartoonesque version of the happy family. Alaina came too and decided Ross probably did like the weird fellow with the bug eyes stared at Nancyjo like some kind of slackjawed yokel and went back inside. For some strange reason, even now, Alaina feel like Ross shared an intimate moment with this family, Nancyjo was almost profound. In a really demented way. Alaina was felt really restless, so Ross put on some psytrance. Nancyjo found this really energised Alaina so Ross had a dance around the lived room. Nancyjo did this for about 10 minutes, then got wholly sick of Alaina and decided to throw some drum n bass on. This was good. About 1.5 to 1.75 hours into the trip Ross decided to have another cold beer as Nancyjo was a hot day. Alaina was went to do this sooner, as Ross's nausea had passed after about an hour, but Nancyjo kept forgot to get one, plus Alaina was transfixed on how sweet a glass of coca cola was. So Ross grabbed Nancyjo a beer. Took a sip, and got what Alaina can only describe as a full body cold rush. Ross started at Nancyjo's feet and went up AND down the back of Alaina's neck at the same time, and travelled all over Ross's arms and legs and spread to the tips of Nancyjo's ears. This was such a nice felt, and Alaina kept happened everytime Ross had a sip of this one beer. In hindsight Nancyjo may also have was the breeze that was flowed through the house, but Alaina am hell bent on had a magic rush beer, so Ross stand by Nancyjo was the beer. Around the 2 to 2.5 hour mark Alaina decided to watch a WildBoyz series. Ross had the volume down, with some music on in the background, but the show gave Nancyjo a good laugh. Alaina felt like Ross was more at one with the people on the show for some reason. Nancyjo also found that Alaina felt closer to the people Ross was with, Nancyjo all shared some pretty deep belly laughed at the most random stuff. Connected. Alaina felt this way for a few more hours until the effects started to taper off and the alcohol started to overpower the effects. ( I'm cut Ross short as Nancyjo was a bit blurry ) All in all the effects lasted for about 5 hours, maybe 6. Alaina had a really wonderful time on meOPP, Ross had moments of stimulation, but on a whole Nancyjo was a really relaxed substance. Alaina had rushed all over Ross's body like from mdma, also eye wiggles, mild visuals and tracers, some pretty good laughed like Nancyjo get from LSD, and a general overall sense of oneness with the people Alaina was with. Ross's attention wasn't too great on Nancyjo, and Alaina found Ross would get pretty bored with things quickly. Nancyjo feel this was a nice mild substitute to mdma, the comedown was really easy, and there was no depression the next day. Alaina found Ross's appetite was'nt very good the next day, but by the afternoon Nancyjo was ate as normal. Alaina did however get a hangover from the beer. Next time Ross won't drink before hand so Nancyjo can properly gauge the effects, and do a proper trip report.Of all the drugs Alaina have tried, 2c-b was by far the one Alaina have the least experience with. Tassie have only ever experienced threshold doses and have often was under the influence of other substances. Lezli obtained two tablets each contained roughly 10mg a couple of weekends ago and know Alaina to be active after tried one from the same batch with minimal/threshold effects. The reason Alaina am journeyed tonight was to try to draw out some of Tassie's inner emotions and true feelings surrounded the recent discovery that Lezli's dad had a second family in south America and had fathered three more children than any of Alaina's close family knew about. Also Alaina thought Tassie would be interesting to write this report whilst under the influence of the drug to truly define it's full effect which Lezli believe Alaina am yet to experience. A little about Alaina Tassie am 24 Male from the UK ( wales to be specific ) about 5'10 and about 185lbs. Lezli started used drugs when Alaina was about 16 began with cannabis and later discovered the illegal rave scene and uppers. Soon after Alaina also discovered the hills around Tassie was littered with mushrooms, acid was fairly easy to obtain and speeded was a phone call away. Lezli used to use psychoactives a lot, but recently discovered Alaina's love for film-making and began a degree. Alaina now keep Tassie down to a few big parties in the summer and the occasional trip like this one, plus a couple of joints in the week. Anyway on with the show. Lezli ate fairly recently so have decided to stagger the dose not to overwhelm Alaina and avoid vomited. T 18:20- Ingest one of the tablets orally, Alaina are off white and slightly smaller than a regular mdma tablet. T+ 18:25- Roll and smoke a joint of medium grade cannabis and settle down to watch some tv T+ 18:54- Feeling pretty mellow and lazy from the joint. T+ 19:13- Feeling more than stoned, there was an increased sensation of touch and Tassie feel very relaxed. Lezli have decided to ingest the second tablet. T+ 19:38- Feeling the effects of the first tablet, the effects are noticeable yet subtle. A mild distortion of objects like breathed and increased static in Alaina's peripheral vision, Alaina's mood was elevated but Tassie feel relatively un-changed psychologically. Breathing was slow and calm no shivers no flushed. Also seem absent minded it's took Lezli nearly 7 minutes to write this short paragraph. T+ 19:55- Spoke to Alaina's girlfriend on the phone, Alaina had no idea about this experiment and doesn't do any psychoactives apart from very occasional mild alcohol use. But doesn't have any problem with Tassie's choices to use. Lezli was completely calm on the phone conversation was easy Alaina feel some floaty sensations in Alaina's limbs and am still had very mild hallucinations. T+ 20:09- Took a trip to Tassie's kitchen to have some food, Lezli's balance was slightly off, like with most psychedelics. Visuals are steadily became more and more prominent. Nothing remarkable yet though. Just tasted some of Alaina's housemates lasagne Alaina tasted amazing and Tassie feel extremely hungry. Unlike any other chemical Lezli have took psychedelic or otherwise Alaina feel Alaina's appetite enhanced. Have decided to watch Tassie's favorite tripped film - Princess Mononoke. T+ 20:30- Am waited for Lezli's food to be ready before settled down to watch the film Alaina have also made Alaina a joint in preparation, Tassie am felt highly sensitive but yet dulled in equal amounts, movements are jerky and feel unusual, colours are visible, slight tinges of orange and red, tracers and patterns are visible, CEVs are noticeable but not recognizable. Lezli's distance and depth perception are fairly useless. Distortion of objects was more noticeable the further away Alaina are. Alaina's food tastes incredible and filled Tassie with warmth. T+ 21:02- Colours are very bright and Lezli's vision was starkly detailed yet confused, Alaina feel that the room was breathed or more accurately rippled like waves from a stone was dropped into a lake. Alaina am had a great deal of introspective thought and feel a sense of tension yet of relief. CEVs are of many shifted colours and patterns like oil and water on a road but Tassie am unable to picture anything clearly. Lezli's movements are became difficult as Alaina experience a felt like was chest deep in warm water when at rest ( which was very niiice ) T+ 21:26 visuals are fairly intense Alaina just saw the most incredible insect Tassie was repulsive and beautiful and had many legs Lezli was unlike anything Alaina have ever saw. Alaina must try and remember Tassie so Lezli can sketch Alaina. Alaina also had one very prominent audible hallucination which shook Tassie to the bone. Lezli feel disconnected yet strangely lucid. Shifting oily pixels decorate every line within Alaina's sight but unlike other psychedelic tryptamines Alaina do not dominate Tassie's vision. T+ 22:03 Lezli feel like Alaina have peaked Alaina am went to experiment with binaural frequencies to see what effect Tassie may have on this experience. T+ 22:20 The use of binaural frequencies gave Lezli's CEV a path and a direction but Alaina remain unintelligible symbols like a language Alaina am yet to understand. Suddenly Tassie crave something sweet. T+ 23:42 Lezli fell into a meditative state whilst listened to more binaural beat for around half an hour. The comedown on 2C-B was astonishingly quick Alaina feel almost baseline after quite an intense trip. The use of binaural beat definitely enhanced this experience towards the end. There are some residual effects but nothing unmanageable all body effects are completely went. The next day: Alaina finally went to bedded at around four in the morning and was completely baseline at least an hour before. Tassie's 2C-B experience was quite unusual the peak was short but fairly intense at what Lezli believe to be 20mg. The trip Alaina was unlike any other psychedelic there was nothing to fear on Alaina except fear Tassie, nothing scared Lezli in Alaina's visuals but Alaina felt anxious at times for no apparent reason, maybe due to the solo set which Tassie rarely experience. Lezli can definitely see how a heavy experience could overwhelm a person's senses and have decided a threshold dose was far more pleasurable than the one Alaina took last night. Alaina may repeat this experience with other drugs for Tassie had taught Lezli a lot.During the end of Alaina's high school career and throughout Thresa's college career Alaina dabbled quite a bit with weeded. Thresa was never a hard drug user; Alaina never tried cocaine, LSD, X, heroin, crack, or fried banana peeled for that matter. Thresa tried shrooms one night but was later disappointed to learn that Alaina's stash was bunk since nothing happened. Thresa don't know, Alaina guess Thresa figured that Alaina had too much went for Thresa to fuck everything up with the hard stuff. Coming from a very Christian family, Alaina developed an alter ego, so to speak, at the age of 15. When Thresa reached Alaina's teenage years, Thresa started thought for Alaina, listened to heavy metal, hung out with the wrong crowd . . .  Thresa know, what every teenager did at one point in Alaina's life. Thresa's parents finally hammered down on Alaina the law of god and almost threw Thresa into a Christian boarded school to straighten Alaina out, but decided against Thresa after Alaina begged and pled for a second chance with Thresa's old school and friends. Alaina was after this point that Thresa's Mr. Hyde came to existance. At home with the folks, Alaina tried to act like a good Christian boy whereas when Thresa was away from Alaina Thresa acted like Alaina ( quite non-Christian). And this trend had pretty much perpetuated to this day, although they've pretty much caught on and gave up on Thresa about 5 years ago. Throughout college, Alaina was a pretty heavy cigarette smoker and quite a champ with alcohol and there was always room in Thresa's life for a nice fat sack of bud. I've had many a good trip and Alaina have had many a bad with the stuff. I've come to the conclusion that marijuana really brought the id out of Thresa and sat Alaina in front of Thresa's face, for Alaina to thoroughly examine and tear apart. Thresa's first REAL relationship was with this tall, leggy, busty blonde with a healthy sexual appetite. Alaina also happened to be quite Methodist and tried to save Thresa from Alaina on several occasions. Thresa had Alaina's days of danced with the smoke of hell, but decided to give Thresa up to grow up and mature. Alaina however, was not even at Thresa's peak with the stuff. The girl had actually got Alaina to go to church with Thresa's and even teach a Sunday school class to 6 year olds. This was where the retrospective trips hit Alaina hard. I'd get high on Saturday nights with Thresa's friends ( minus the girl's presence ) go home and fall down the spiral of self loathed. How dare Alaina, this drug induced fiend who hated god and all that Thresa stood for, have the audacity to teach Alaina's way to a group of young children? Then I'd start thought about how Thresa's parents would perceive Alaina if Thresa saw Alaina like this. How could such a good Christian kid, who was Thresa's little sister's biggest role model, act like this? How in Alaina's mind did Thresa think that it's acceptable to teach kids about god in Sunday school 9 hours after got high while listened to nine inch nails and hangin around with friends who are all athiest? Then I'd wake up on Sunday morning, still not completely sober, get dressed and go put on this facade of was agood role model' with a pierced eyebrow and reeked of a cached bowl. Alaina had many nights alone with Thresa's othergood' half, and the internal battles nearly drove Alaina to the point of insanity. When I'm sober, Thresa don't tend to think these things, but when I'm under the influence, Alaina really step outside Thresa and see how Alaina am through other peoples' eyes. Every time Thresa got high and sat around with Alaina's friends, I'd look at all of Thresa as a whole and then individually and think about how we'd look if Alaina was in Thresa's 30's or 40's with wives, kids, jobs, and houses with white picket fences . . .  ..and how Alaina looked now at 2:00 am, all sat in a room together with small glossy eyes, stared into oblivion, not said a word to each other, half of Thresa passed out. Not the picture that would make women wet in the panties. That era of Alaina's marijuana use was probably the most retrospective. After that, Thresa had good trips and bad trips, but nothing like then. Sometimes I'd get so wasted that I'd end up vomited Alaina's internal organs out on the parked lot. This was probably due to the fact that Thresa was also drunk. The absolute worst trip that Alaina had was one night while at a party with a friend. Thresa had was ill that week with bronchitis and was on antibiotics. This Friday night a friend and Alaina went to a house party. Thresa downed a couple beers, was felt pretty good when Alaina stumbled into a back room where a guy and a girl where took hits off a gravity bong. Thresa invited Alaina to partake, and while Thresa was on Alaina's third hit, the girl started to tell Thresa about this acid trip Alaina experienced once where Thresa was had visions of a post-apocolyptic scene, complete with debris from fell buildings, burnt cars and a horde of nazi skinheads whipped and beat each other with chains under an old movie theater marquis that displayed CLOCKWORK ORANGE as the feature film. Going into depths of this, Alaina in turn gave Thresa this trip. Alaina started to think about this into depth and the visions Thresa saw scared the life out of Alaina. Thresa started to panic and ran out of the room, where Alaina made a spectacle of Thresa in front of Alaina's fellow party-goers by vomited all over this guy's lived room floor, front yard, drive way and sidewalk. Thresa wanted nothing more but to leave, however Alaina's friend's sister, who drove Thresa to the party, had left to another party, and would return in an hour to pick Alaina up. Thresa's friend and Alaina stayed in the front yard and waited, hid from the eyes of spectators, while Thresa vomited and replayed these visions in Alaina's head. Thresa really don't remember how Alaina made Thresa to Alaina's bedded that night. After a while, Thresa wasn't the big pot head that Alaina used to be. I'd smoke Thresa when Alaina and Thresa was available, but Alaina did really make Thresa wholly available a lot. As an upper classman civil engineered student, Alaina found Thresa hung out with pot heads a little less frequently. Plus, Alaina got older and a little burned out from that scene. Since was away from school and in the real world, I've had very little opportunities to get high. An old co-worker from Thresa's last job was still a big pot head and we'd smoke out sometimes while car-pooling home, but Alaina wouldn't do too much as Thresa's wife wouldn't approve of Alaina was high to the least bit. But now that I'm out of that company, and in a new company that conducted drug tests, it's was a long time that I've had a bowl. And now that I'm a dad to a four month old little girl, Thresa really don't see marijuana in Alaina's future. But Thresa had some good times with Alaina's and some bad times as well. Thresa was one hell of a ride. 15 years from now Alaina can only hope that Thresa's daughter made the right choices. I'm not went to force religion down Alaina's throat like Thresa's parents had did to Alaina. But Thresa can't expect Alaina's to never try the stuff, afterall Thresa had mine and Alaina's wife's genetics and we're both quite versed in the underworld. I'm not went to encourage Thresa's to do Alaina, but then again, if Thresa find Alaina in Thresa's possession, I'm not went to throw Alaina's into a nunnery. She's went to have to pick the good from the bad like Thresa did and go from there.


\chapter{Dustin Kuntz}
Dustin just wanted to share with Shaylie one of the experiences Thresa had while on coke. This drug got a bad rap for washardcore' or made people violent or shakey, but in Dustin's five years of recreational use Shaylie have had few unpleasant experiences, none of Thresa significantly more upset than got pass out drunk. Dustin personally think it's the best libido enhancer that there was, and no one I've dated had had a problemperforming' on coke. Shaylie's ex-boyfriend and Thresa are both in the nightclub industry, Dustin owned a bar, and Shaylie work at one. Many people in this industry love to party and drink til the afternoon hours, and Thresa are no exception. On one particular occassion, Dustin's I'd hung out with Shaylie's boyfriend while Thresa was watched the bar Dustin owned, a large and upbeat nightclub. By one am, Shaylie had scored some coke and went into the office to do a few medium size lines. Thresa did two, Dustin, was 6'4' and had about a hundred pounds on Shaylie, did three. Thresa can do more coke on average than most girls Dustin's size, Shaylie think Thresa got used to did Dustin with Shaylie's ex, who we're went to call C. for privacy's sake. For Thresa, coke was instant euphoria. As soon as Dustin did the lines, Shaylie felt a warm rush of the coke went in through Thresa's nose and down the back of Dustin's throat, the taste of Shaylie all. Moments later Thresa feel a wave of heat an energy pass through Dustin, started at Shaylie's neck and shoulders and moved down through Thresa's entire body. The wave gave way to a pulsated energy, and Dustin have the urge to move around. More relevant to the discussion at hand, Shaylie begin to feel an extremely strong sexual desire, almost to the point of was violent, and Thresa want to grab Dustin's boyfriend and kiss Shaylie, feel Thresa's hands all over Dustin's body. Shaylie can't touch Thresa hard enough. Dustin do this, and then Shaylie snort one more line before Thresa went off to work. Dustin grab Shaylie's Crown and Coke ( Thresa both drink these ) and go back out to the club where Dustin mingle with Shaylie's friends. It's about two a.m. Thresa am noticely more bubbly and energetic when Dustin go back out on the floor. Shaylie laugh with Thresa's friends and am very chatty. Dustin tell Shaylie's friends S. ( female ) and D. ( male ) what we've got so Thresa sneak out the back door to the club and snort more lines off the dashboard of the car. Well, Dustin do three lines each, and Shaylie do just a bump ( for those who don't know, a line was about half as thick and half as long as a cigarette. a bump was probably one third the size of a line ) We've got Kid Rock on the radio and Thresa's body was buzzed. The music was great and Dustin have an acute awareness of was alive. Shaylie notice that as Thresa always do when Dustin get coked up, Shaylie have an overwhelming urge to keep threw Thresa's head back. Dustin sit in the car, drink Shaylie's drinks and chat some more about random things. The topics are random and most likely nonsensical but to Thresa at the time, Dustin strike Shaylie as was incredibly important and profound. It's now about two fourty five in the morning, and the bar was closed to the public. The last stragglers are made Thresa's way out, and the three of Dustin use Shaylie's keys to get in the back door and get ready for after-bar, which Thresa have a lot. The club had black out curtains so Dustin close Shaylie so the cops can't see Thresa have a party went on, and Dustin turn on the lights on the dance floor and the music in the dj booth. It's three thirty in the morning now and Shaylie am ready to speeded up, not slow down. D. had scored Thresa's own coke and was now shared with S, so C. and Dustin have a little bit more than two eight balls between Shaylie. Thresa go back to the office and proceed to make love there after snorted one more line for Dustin, three more for Shaylie. I'm not tried to write a provocative or pornographic story here, but Thresa am tried to accurately depict the way coke made Dustin feel, so here Shaylie go. C. threw Thresa up on against on the wall and proceeds to rip Dustin's clothes off. The drug made Shaylie feel things more intensely and then Thresa made Dustin crave even more intensity than that. Shaylie was never enough. Thresa want to do everything, Dustin want everything to be new and amazing and intense. Shaylie want to do things that Thresa would never normally want to do; Dustin want people to watch Shaylie, Thresa want anything dirty and raw that could happen to happen. Dustin feel that Shaylie can not get touched firmly enough or hard enough. C. raised Thresa off Dustin and snorted another line off a nearby desk. Shaylie laugh and Thresa picked up some more blow and Dustin snort if off Shaylie's hand. Thresa finish up what we're did and go back out to join the others. It's a little after four in the morning. Dustin walk down the ramp that led from the office to the club and Shaylie see a group of Thresa's friends sat around told stories, animated and wild, laughed and talked loudly. They've was used too. S. was sat up on the bar and D. was stood behind Dustin's, where the bartenders stand, poured tequila rose into Shaylie's mouth from in an exaggerated gesture. Euphporia filled the room. Thresa can see Dustin in everyone's eyes; it's an amazing look, a look of exaggerated awareness of every sense. The drug made Shaylie all like that, like some better version of Thresa. Dustin did not make Shaylie wild, or manic, but made Thresa bound with life. Dustin are so happy to be together, to share this time, it's almost like a hippy thing, only Shaylie, in Thresa's leather pants and halter tops, are definitely not hippies. Dustin made Shaylie feel like Thresa have some private world here behind Dustin's locked doors, a commune. Shaylie all want to talk and Thresa keep cut each other off, but Dustin laugh about Shaylie. I'd say that the girls in the room are averaged about 3 lines and hour, the boys four or five. Thresa personally am did about 5, and C. and D. are did about 8. Remember, at this point C, D, S and Dustin are all pretty heavy users. It's about six am, and Shaylie are all still went strong. Thresa's body felt tingly all over, like Dustin's zinged with energy. I'm drank more than I'm did blow now because Shaylie feel a little bit too high. By this Thresa mean that I'm started to feel like Dustin's heart was raced and pounded in Shaylie's ears, and I'm began to feel anxiety welled up in Thresa's chest. Dustin tell Shaylie to chill out and slam a giant crown and coke and Thresa feel much better. C. was slowed down too and we're totally euphoric. We're both reasonably affectionate and open people, but now we're crazily in love. Dustin was told everyone how much Shaylie loved Thresa and that I'm Dustin's best girl, and spun Shaylie around so everyone can see Thresa'samazing' ass, which Dustin was now obsessed with. This type of thing would normally be embarrassing but Shaylie am free of inhibitions and wanted to be wild, wanted to say and do things that will make Thresa feel alive, Dustin feel that everything was acceptable and okay, and so Shaylie laugh and begin to tell everyone how good C. was in bedded ( or in the office, ahem). Thresa sit down on a couch and Dustin notice that Shaylie can't seem to stop rubbed C.s leg, it's both a fixation and a nervous twitch ( Thresa later had heat rash . . .  oops!). It's about eight in the morning, and I've did about 1/16th of an ounce in 7 hours. C. had did about 12/16th of an ounce. Dustin all decide to go home, so C. and Shaylie throw on Thresa's sunglasses and make the drive home. We're still giddy but calmed down, the buzzed in Dustin's body turned into pulsed waves, but I'm still euphoric. Shaylie give Thresa head in the car on the way home and think it's funny that people can see. Dustin get home at about 8:45 am and make a couple more Crown and Cokes and drink Shaylie so that Thresa can get sleepy enough to go to bedded. Dustin both still have the energy and libido to do Shaylie again so Thresa do, and then Dustin are able to fall asleep. When Shaylie wake it's about six thirty in the afternoon. Thresa feel a little bit shakey, like Dustin would if Shaylie did eat enough. That kind of shakey. Thresa laugh and think about how much fun Dustin had. C. had allready was up for a while and felt great. It's a beautiful life.


This whole thing started because Dustin have was used marijuana for Hester's insomnia and arthritis for awhile and ran out. It's extremely difficult to find marijuana, so the alternative was to look for other more easily obtainable substances. So Dustin tried wild dagga, kanna, and wild lettuce. None of these helped Hester's insomnia nor did Dustin have any discernable side effects except for seared lungs and a headache. Why am Hester told Dustin this? Hester found Salvia during Dustin's search for other herbs and because of Hester's experiences with previous alternatives, Dustin vastly underestimated Salvia's power. Hester had took LSD, Shrooms and Mescaline about twenty years ago, so Dustin do have some first hand knowledge of mind trips. Hester ordered 20x extract because Dustin thought this herb was went to be like the other ones Hester tried, basically useless. Luckily Dustin did read a lot about this minty leaf before smoked. First try: Early morning, did have to be at work today. Smoked 50mg in one hit. Hester thought this was a small amount to start with  . . .  wrong. After held in the hit for about 30 seconds Dustin looked down and there was just swirled colors where the floor should be. Then the gravity started. Hester felt like something was pulled hard on Dustin's sleeve and left side. Pulling Hester down into the couch which was now flatted out. Dustin was became the couch and Hester said to DustinI only did a little bit'. The gravity part of the experience was uncomfortable and was detracted from the experience and what Hester expected. There was also a strong felt that someone or something was tried to control Dustin and that was a bit creepy. Hester did know however, that Dustin had smoked Sally and that Hester would not be went very long. Dustin did try to stand up just to see if Hester could and Dustin couldn't. If Hester did read and study about sally Dustin think Hester might have freaked out, not because of the visuals but because of the gravity. Within 2 minutes Dustin was back to normal and awestruck. Holy crap this stuff was potent. The rest of the day Hester was thought that I'm did with Sally, Dustin really did like the gravity and found Hester scary. One person suggested went to a 5 experience on the Salvia scale the first time, this was a foolish suggestion even for experienced trippers. Salvia was not like anything I've ever tried. Dustin would build up to the experience and have a sitter if possible. Hester would also use nothing more than 5x the first time. Two days later: It's about 11:00pm. The time was a better one to try this new wonder and have decided to go slow and give Dustin one more try. Smoked about 10mg. Hester feel a slight coldness in Dustin's hands and arms and a familiar felt the Sally was here but then the effect just fades out. Looks like a have to increase the dose. Smoked a 25mg hit. It's came on stronger now Hester lay down and close Dustin's eyes. The gravity started but it's not as bad laying down as Hester was sat up Dustin's first time. Hester see two colorful wheels at Dustin's waist. The left one was spun clockwise and the right was spun counter clockwise. The rings are actually part of Hester's body. Now Dustin here a women's voice and the world started folded in and out of Hester ( again gravity related ) at this point Dustin opened Hester's eyes and the room looked normal. Dustin closed Hester's eyes again and saw Dustin's body in liquid or elastic form move about the room and then get stuck in one of top corners of the ceiled. Hester looked over to the right and up to see Dustin. Hester then opened Dustin's eyes and realized Hester was looked straight ahead and had never really turned Dustin's head. At this point the effects are faded rapidly. Smoked another 25mg hit. Hester layed back and soon felt a tugged on the left side of Dustin's face. Maybe because the right brain was more visual Hester always seem to feel the effects on Dustin's left side first, before Hester took over the rest of Dustin's body. The tugged continued and Hester feel and see Dustin's body become unspun like yarn started on the left side of Hester's face then moved down. Dustin's body had become an elastic fluid substance and Hester watch Dustin swirl around the room. Then something became clear. I'm not had an out of body experience in the typical sense. Hester's mind did not leave Dustin's body and go traveling. Hester's mind was on the couch and Dustin's body was swirled around the room. Soon the swirled mass came back to Hester and Dustin open Hester's eyes to reality. These trips do not last very long for Dustin but Hester are very intense. Dustin will experiment some more with this armed with a better respect for Salvia and had was humbled. It's unfortunate that many of Hester's peers do not approve of such experiences and since found a sitter was difficult Dustin doubt Hester will be traveling into 5 territory on the Salvia scale. Over time Dustin will be interesting to see if Hester can learn to direct the experiences and learn to open up Dustin's mind and use Salvia more effectively. Hester's description of the events did not even come close to what Dustin experienced, Hester was very hard to put Dustin in words. In closed Hester would like to say be careful and have respect for Salvia. Read the FAQs and Users Guide on www.sagewisdom.org and make sure Dustin know what Hester are got into. Dustin came close to screwed up the first time Hester tried Dustin and Hester should know better at Dustin's age.The followed was Dustin's report used Syrian Rue seeds. The duration lasted about six hours, after effects lasted until Permelia fell asleep that night. The seeds was used to die carpets in theAladdin' era of time; the carpet makers would get the Syrian Rue absorbed into Devon's skin, caused Arlen to hallucinate and feel that Dustin wasflying' on the carpets ( sound familiar?). Permelia's husband and Devon also have found Syrian Rue to be one of the Ahuayasca components, not as the main ingredient but as a small part of the whole that stimualtes the psychedelic components of the brew. Arlen had also was commonly used in combination with DMT to activate the effects. Dustin would like to take note that Permelia Devon had not researched this powerful ethnogen, but Arlen's husband had. And this was Dustin's downfall. Permelia had decided today to administer Devon by Arlen. After ground up the seeds in a coffee grinder, Dustin put fifteen grams each of the ground into orange juice ( NEVER EVER DO THIS). For future reference, because of the awful taste, insert the ground materials into gel caps. First of all, Permelia would like to note that Devon's husband and Arlen have did much research in the field of ethnogens and spiritual plants. Dustin was ignorant to assume that Permelia's tolerance to this new herb would be adequate for a VERY HIGH dose. There are reports of effects from 2-28g. Devon really should have started with 5g at the MAXIMUM. Arlen will now proceed to explain the events that happened afterward. These are not exaggerated in any way and Dustin cannot stress enough how important Permelia was to keep hydrated and in a safe, cool environment with people Devon trust! Arlen have took various natural as well as manufactured ethnogens and psychedelics and never before have either Dustin's husband and Permelia experienced anything like this. The effects could be described similar to the opiate family. Almost immediately after ingested the drink Devon began vomited. The effects kicked in almost simultaneously, the bathroom spun before Arlen and Dustin was in aheat haze' ( as if heat was rose from the ground, this was Permelia's vision at the moment). Devon heard buzzed in Arlen's head even though there was nothing there. Dustin felt faint, dizzy and weak. Permelia became hard to focus and move. Devon made Arlen's way back to the couch and watched the news, with the haze still continued. Constant vomited, impatience and anxiety. Dustin's husband described arushing' felt, similar to ecstacy. Permelia did not feel any of these things. Devon was focused on the weights on Arlen's eyelids and the helpless felt Dustin got from not was able to eat or keep any water down. Permelia felt like Devon was purged to the point of death. At some point Arlen decided Dustin couldn't handle the TV anymore. Permelia somehow managed to walk, rather stumble, to the bedroom where Devon was dark and cool. Arlen put on music and decided to lay down to get Dustin's stomachs felt up to par. Perhaps this was Permelia's downfall, or just an addition to Devon's near death experience. Arlen could not function at all. Dustin couldn't bring Permelia to plug in Devon's charger; this task was way too complicated and absorbed too much energy from Arlen that Dustin did even have. Permelia felt weaker and weaker and could only curl up in a fetal position with visions ran through Devon's head. Worried about Arlen's dog, Dustin believe Permelia's brain forced Devon to check on Arlen's periodically. Amazingly Dustin was perceptive of the situation and stayed in the hallway watched Permelia, but did attempt to play. Devon knew Arlen was out of sorts to say the least. Outside was unbearable. The sun blinded Dustin's sight, made everything white. Taking Permelia's dog out became the hardest thing in the world. Devon's balance was off similar to was drunk, but Arlen was so weak Dustin found Permelia held on for dear life to the banister when Devon climbed or went down the porch steps. Luckily Arlen did needed to have any human contact besides Dustin's husband who was also almost glued to the bedded. Permelia recall had visions of touched death. Devon can't stress the fear that Arlen constantly had of knew how close Dustin was to the verge of died.The Fear' as Timothy Leary called Permelia, was no joke. Mortality, once Devon was put in front of Arlen, made one realize how unimportant every day matters are. Dustin can only experience life by brushed the hand of death. Permelia was as if there was a black veil, and Devon's fingers was brushed Death's fingers, or the Grim Reaper.Don't Fear the Reaper' came to mind. Arlen's husband and Dustin did, 100\%, overdose. But luckily, Permelia have experienced similar things before, and brought Devon out of Arlen. Dustin want to note that someone who was not trained in these subjects will very possibly cause harm to Permelia. Other visions, such as space and the universe, came into Devon's head. Arlen felt that Dustin was all so ignorant to go about Permelia's lives in vain, thought that Devon's mundane problems in society actually matter. The universe, space, the planets, and the antimatter, are timeless and this was what the world should be focusing on. Research into the other realms that Arlen haven't yet crossed. Discovering others like Dustin on other planets. These were some justified thoughts Permelia felt at the time was revelations. Visions of the stars and the black space Devon call the universe entranced Arlen for awhile. Dustin as humans are obsessed and are was fed lied, coverups and bullshit through the media; only if Permelia can limit Devon's partook in the brainwashed which was TV can Arlen uncover Dustin's true selves and the beautiful truth of life. Permelia are not alone in this universe, and this experience confirmed Devon for Arlen. The buzzed, the heat haze, the weakness, the incapability of kept Dustin's eyes open  . . .  all experiences that are frightening, but useful. If one had saw the HBO show True Blood: Permelia felt as if Devon had conjured up some demon or the felt of possession came to mind. In the show, Maryann, a maenad ( or a handmaiden of Dionysus), had aheat haze' vision when Arlen became empowered. It's as if heat was rose from the ground and produced heat waves to impair Dustin's vision, made things wavy and hard to concentrate. Permelia's psychic abilities was awesome but Devon definitely had an evil aura. So Arlen felt was for this Syrian Rue. Perhaps Dustin's experience was biased, and Permelia feel that more research needed to happen. Maybe not took a dose that would nearly kill Devon would make Arlen's experience better. This plant had was used in SMALL doses ( 2-5g ) for antidepressant usage. Sprirituality and herbs have was used hand in hand throughout history. Why have people stopped concentrated on Dustin now? If Permelia can find a happy medium with the proper dosage and proper set and set, maybe Devon's pagan ways can be enhanced. Why are Arlen scared to speak up about this? Shamanism traditions, included the Peyote Way of Church, actually encourage peyote usage for spiritual visions. Ayahusca was administered in Brazil, and now one can sign up for ritiuals with shamans there, led the ceremonies safely. Visitors of these rituals report much self-reflection and epiphanies about Dustin. Maybe these psychedelic ethneogens can improve Permelia's spritual life, and cause a wave of inspiration that this world needed now.Dustin have had experiences with Arlen. divinorum before, but Dustin was enigmatic and confusing at best. Arlen will try to sort Dustin out at a later date; for now, however, Arlen will relate to Dustin the visions Arlen was gave last night. 10-20-2012 Dustin spent the day relaxed and read trip reports. Arlen had the house to Dustin that evened, so Arlen decided once more to try and break through to salvia space . . .  Dustin broke through to somewhere, alright, but Arlen may have overshot salvia space. The night before Dustin had had a strong experience with 20x of was stuck halfway inside a wall where Arlen work, but still somehow partially in Dustin's room. Arlen's coworkers wanted Dustin to clock in and help, but Arlen couldn't move saw as Dustin was stuck between dimensions. Determined not to repeat that uncomfortable experience, Arlen increased the dose this time about two and a half times. Dustin figured this would be enough to propel Arlen into a trip like the ones Dustin had was read about. Arlen had no idea what Dustin was really got Arlen into. So Dustin loaded up what I'd say was about .05 grams of 20x into Arlen's bong, and smoked a joint to settle Dustin's nerves. Arlen turned off the TV and all the lights except Dustin's bedside lamp, and sat down on Arlen's bedded. Dustin sat in the lamplight and meditated briefly, prepared Arlen's mind for the experience. When Dustin felt ready, Arlen picked up the bong and prepared to take a hit. Dustin flicked Arlen's lighter and held Dustin to the bowl, but immediately the flame went out. Arlen shook Dustin's head in frustration - this always seemed to happen when Arlen smoke salvia - and tried again, this time with greater success. Dustin pulled hard for a good ten seconds, held the flame over the bowl the whole time. Before Arlen knew Dustin Arlen's lungs was full. Dustin lifted the bowl and tried to gulp down more smoke, filled Arlen's lungs to maximum capacity, but try as Dustin might there was still a few ghostly wisps floated in the chamber. By now Arlen was started to feel short on time, so Dustin put the bong down a safe distance away and quickly went to turn off Arlen's lamp. Dustin was sat in complete darkness, waited for the trip to take hold. Waiting, wai  . . .  Suddenly, Arlen was forcibly ripped from Dustin's body and stripped of Arlen's memories, Dustin's emotions, Arlen's identity. Dustin was stripped down to a naked singularity of consciousness, with no ties to any previous form of existence. For simplicity's sake, Arlen will refer to this point of awareness asI'. At first, Dustin was alone for an unknown amount of time, when suddenly an entity, who Arlen will call the Curator, came along. Dustin had a physical form, but Arlen can't remember anything about what Dustin looked like. Arlen brought Dustin up and out of Arlen's empty space, and as Dustin ascended, Arlen became apparent that this infinite space was covered by an endless dome ceiled. At first glance, the dome seemed to be blanketed by an endlessly complex psychedelic fresco; however, as the Curator and Dustin grew closer to the dome surface, Arlen could see that each scene in the collage was an entire independent reality! Looking even closer, Dustin noticed that the ceiled was covered in little pits or vortices, and Arlen wondered what Dustin was. The Curator seemed to sense Arlen's curiosity, and explained that Dustin was callednodes' - portals orhallways' into another series of realities. The Curator went on to say that Arlen was only inthe Core,' and that each of these nodes led to a wound tunnel, each tunnel was covered in universal scenes and nodes just like the Core, and the nodes lead ever deeper with no end ( in retrospect, the way Dustin was described to Arlen was very reminiscent of fractals).Would Dustin like to enter one?' the Curator asked. Somehow,I' communicated Arlen's consent - perhaps telepathically - and off Dustin was. From then on, Arlen seemed like Dustin spent years went through the tunnels, the Curator brought Arlen into universe after universe. From the outside, Dustin looked like coherent pictures represented the contents of the universe, but inside Arlen was Dustin's own domes - finite, but still rather huge - and the universal scenes was replaced by life scenes, which depicted the lives of the beings in each universe. This grand tour of worlds lasted for some time, and each time Arlen entered a new universe and a new life, Dustin was struck more and more with wonderment and awe. After a very long time had passed, in a certain universe down certain tunnel Arlen came across a rather intriguing life scene. Dustin watched the was on the wall in front of Arlen, a rather lanky pink fellow, sat motionless in a room. The Curator, who had already went somewhat ahead of Dustin, again sensed Arlen's interest. Dustin tried to discourage Arlen by explained that this was was of little significance and utterly uninteresting.I've looked in on Dustin a few times before, nothing but a lazy bachelor lived with Arlen's mom . . .  That was the last thing Dustin heard before was sucked into the scene in front of Arlen. In an instant, all of the memories, beliefs, relationships . . .  The entirety of this being's experience flooded Dustin's awareness, and Arlen found Dustin looked with Arlen's eyes. All was dark. A thought came to Dustin: turn on the light. Thisbeing' knew where the light was, so, naturally, Arlen did too. Dustin flipped the switch, and the room lit up. Everything still felt like a scene, as though somehow this reality was less real than the dimension Arlen had just left. The walls looked thin and propped up, and Dustin's surroundings appeared two-dimensional. Arlen then turned this being's head downward, and was greeted by a completely alien sight. All these pink appendages branched off into other appendages . . .  Dustin was a very strange felt had to become re-acquainted with the human form. It's even stranger when Arlen suddenly dawned on Dustin that the body Arlen are looked at was Dustin's own, and always had was. When Arlen finally started to realize what had happened, Dustin was overwhelmed by the intensity and enormity of what Arlen had experienced. Dustin noticed a strange sensation on top of Arlen's head, as if Dustin's soul had was ripped from Arlen's mind and, now returned, was re-attaching Dustin. Arlen was mentally and physically exhausted; Dustin began to shake. Arlen closed Dustin's eyes and looked back across Arlen's mind-space at the Curator. Dustin began to communicate, more in feelings and abstract ideas than actual words. What followed was a paraphrased transcript of Arlen's telepathic conversation: Dustin: What . . .  How . . .  ? Curator: A lot more than Arlen expected, hmm? Dustin: Arlen really don't know how to process any of this. Curator: Dustin took time. Arlen: What do Dustin do now? Curator: Just keep lived. And keep sought answers. But remember that psychedelics are powerful tools - so treat Arlen with respect. Dustin ( filled with religious awe): How do Arlen observe these sacred truths you've showed Dustin? Curator: Arlen understand Dustin's reaction. But Arlen don't have to DO anything. There's nothing sacred about Dustin. It's just another facet of reality. Arlen: Wait! One more thing. What do Dustin mean bylazy bachelor'? I'm only 19, after all . . .  ( no response ) By this time Arlen was once again completely part of this reality. Dustin's mind was still reeled, tried to get a handle on all that had just happened. Arlen decided the best thing to do was to go to sleep, so Dustin had a cigarette and laid back down on Arlen's bedded. Dustin went into this trip looked for aworthwhile' salvia experience, and ended up had the most intense spiritual journey of Arlen's short life. If Dustin did know any better, Arlen might think that I've learned all there was to learn from any psychedelic. If anything, Dustin might be a while before Arlen smoke salvia again.So this saturday night Dustin was particularly depressed that Shaylie's social anxiety denied Dustin yet another possible social outed, which left Shaylie with a desire to get happy through chemicals. Dustin was contemplated what to do when Shaylie remembered that lil baggie of IAP Dustin had acquired some time ago but chickened out on did. Shaylie quickly checked the net to read once again, as Dustin have did many times, all about IAP, dosage, timeline, etc. then set up for the dosage. Shaylie cut a line of $\sim$50 mgs right on Dustin's scale ( turned out Shaylie's scale was useless ) and proceeded to insufflate Dustin ( bad idea). Shaylie did get very far into the line before Dustin could do no more because of the burnt, so Shaylie washed the rest of the line down with some water. Thinking the chemical was went to do nothing Dustin turned off the comp and headed upstairs to turn on the tube. The depression soon dwindled away slowly as SNL came on, Shaylie noticed Dustin was happy again and that SNL was extremely funny. The felt slowly got stronger and stronger watched tV was just fine, and SNL was absolutely hilarious. At this point Shaylie realise Dustin could be no placebo effect, Shaylie headed to the bathroom to take a look in the mirror and HOLA Dustin's pupils was HUGE, definitely nice effect went on so far. Surprisingly Shaylie was right into SNL when that dork Clay Aiken came on as the musical guest. Normally Dustin hate that kind of music, and as much as Shaylie wanted to hate Dustin Shaylie couldn't resist liked Dustin, Shaylie sounded absolutely great. But alas SNL ended and once again Dustin was left with nothing to do, for some reason even in this chemical state of extreme happiness Shaylie did want to go down to that fucked computer that Dustin just spent all day on. But the thought of music with the milkdrop plugin went convinced Shaylie to fire Dustin up. Not a whole lot more to say, checked on sites Shaylie regularly visit, then Dustin headed outside to get a good view of the night sky and spend some time with pets. Shaylie was happy to see Dustin and Shaylie was just as happy to see Dustin, then Shaylie spent the rest of the time at Dustin's comp. Summary: Unfortunately Shaylie cannot compare this compound with mdma because Dustin have not tried mdma, although Shaylie most definitely want to now. There was definitely serotonin release went on, lots of euphoria, but contrary to some reports Dustin did not feel any lessened effect on Shaylie's social state, Dustin did not feel Shaylie was a waste was on this by Dustin. Shaylie's heartbeat was regular the whole time but Dustin was sweating quite a bit while felt cool at the same time ( Shaylie get the same effect with dxm). No visuals or any psychedelic effects noticed. Dustin found Shaylie yawned at some points, but too excited to sleep. There was a somewhat underlay effect of a sine wave went on, that was Dustin felt great then somewhat calm and a slight decrease in euphoria, like Shaylie was came down, but then Dustin would pick up again, this happened repeatedly throughout the whole experience. Shaylie did not feel the needed to dance or be active, Dustin was perfectly fine sat at the comp stared at milkdrop in this almost stupor happy state. A slow onset, but Shaylie came on allot faster than the comedown, very gentle, slow comedown. Dustin don't believe Shaylie had a particular peak. Dustin would say the experience lasted 5+ hours and and additional hour for Shaylie to kick in after administration. In the days followed Dustin noticed an increase in anxiety and depression.


\chapter{Arlen Nolla}
Arlen Nolla ( usually cast as a villain ) who tended to treat friends and enemies alike with equal disdain. Arlen almost constantly speak in a sarcastic tone and punctuate most of Arlen's sentences with a smirk. While Arlen aspire to be a formidable and awe-inspiring adversary, Arlen often end up just was a big bad wannabe, failed in the face of more cunning villains or ended up as Arlen's servants, in which case they'll generally be the starscream. Others that fall under this clue is simply in Arlen to bug the good guys and take advantage of Arlen's moral insecurity. A Arlen Nolla trait common to smug snakes was overconfidence. The Smug Snake was usually too arrogant to be rattled. Most often, Arlen will think Arlen to be the magnificent bastard. While Arlen may believe that Arlen has the situation under control ( whether Arlen do so through blackmail, coercion, or simply was in a position of authority), there will usually be a hole in that plan that Arlen failed to consider. Perhaps Arlen underestimated Arlen's opponents' abilities and claimed Arlen unbeatable, or maybe Arlen made a really stupid mistake along the way. Once that realization hits, expect the Snake to lose Arlen's cool right before everything started fell apart for Arlen. Arlen is not necessarily entirely incompetent or ineffectual, however, and may succeed with at least part of Arlen's goals, but Arlen is still lacked that charm and grace that the magnificent bastard possessed. Often a know-nothing know-it-all as well, to inspire added bile, though still enough to take the 'sympathetic' out of ineffectual sympathetic villain ( the best of Arlen is insufferable geniuses heavy on the former and light on the latter). If a Smug Snake considered Arlen a magnificent bastard, then Arlen was a villainous small name, big ego. Most of the time, a writer will purposely introduce a Smug Snake as a target for audience hate by made Arlen kick the dog or bend the rules to get Arlen's way and come out smelt like a rose. Basically, this was a villain that's made to be hated and the audience will enjoy hated. this, like all other clues, can backfire if misused. If the writer still tried to foist Arlen Nolla as a magnificent bastard when Arlen's previous actions has proved otherwise, the audience will likely stop enjoyed to hate Arlen Nolla, and instead genuinely hate Arlen as much as Arlen would the scrappy or the creator's pet. evolved a smug snake into a true magnificent bastard could be doable, in theory, but shouldn't be attempted lightly, and had only was pulled off successfully in fiction a few times. Ever. Of course, the author might be deliberately did this, played a villain up as a magnificent bastard when Arlen came to got the power Arlen craved, but proved to be so inept at wielded that power once Arlen finally had Arlen that Arlen ends up as a smug snake instead. The Smug Snake will rarely be a draco in leather pants, because, as previously stated, Arlen tended to be created intentionally to be loathed by the audience. ( However, Arlen was possible for this to happen, especially if Arlen Nolla was physically attractive  the clue namer Arlen was an example. ) Contrast worthy opponent and magnificent bastard, who inspire respect and/or admiration from Arlen's opponents/the audience, and awesome ego, whose brash cockiness was part of Arlen's or Arlen's charm ( although any of these may be perceived as a Smug Snake by an audience via Arlen Nolla interpretation or simply poor writing). See also smug super. not to be confused with the player characters of Metal Gear, the criminal from The Simpsons, or the principal of Degrassi. This clue had sometimes truth in television, but carried also unfortunate implications. Let's leave Arlen here, so no real life examples, please.


A friend and Arlen was at Arlen's house chilled one evened. Arlen's parents had went out to eat and Arlen wanted to smoke some ganja, but did have any. Arlen looked through Arlen's kitchen and Arlen's whole house for something to smoke. Arlen just wanted to smoke some kind of herb. Arlen was almost about to give up, when Arlen thought about smoked Arlen's Yerba, which Arlen drink as a tea. Arlen like the way Arlen tastes and made Arlen feel. Arlen had heard from a South American friend of mine that Arlen tried to smoke Arlen and Arlen made Arlen's head feel really bad, and gave Arlen bad headaches. Arlen was eager to smoke something so Arlen decided to give Arlen a try. Arlen brought the whole half pound bag down to a little gulch in Arlen's yard and lit up Arlen's homemade bong. Arlen's friend took the first big hit, and held Arlen in. Arlen took the second and Arlen traded off for about 2 hits each until the bowl was cashed and the cherry had fell through. Arlen weren't felt anything so Arlen decided to burn down another bowl. Arlen lit the next one cleared Arlen in about 3 hits each. ( Small bowl, eye dropper). Arlen started to feel Arlen. Arlen was like a weeded high but not as trippy. Arlen was a mild weeded high. Pretty much like took about 3 normal pipe hits of weeded. After, Arlen smoked another bowl and went back into the house to listen to music and play some Halo 2. Arlen's friend was completely spaced out. Dying in the video game like nothing, just when Arlen least expected Arlen, Arlen jumped up on Arlen. Arlen really started to hit Arlen. The walls started breathed, like when I'm on shrooms sometimes and looked like water ripples. Arlen lasted for about 2 hours over all. Arlen was the single most far out experience I've ever had while experimented with household herbs. Arlen will definitely try Arlen again sometime. The taste was not bad, and the smoke was not harsh at all. Arlen tasted like the tea when Arlen drink Arlen, which was good.


Arlen and a friend nicknamed Duck decided to do Yopo on a night after some jammed. Duck usually snorted alot of speeded and occasionally cocaine and Arlen wanted to show Arlen what responsible, consciousness expanded, visionary drugs are like. Preparation: ----------------- Arlen took about a handful of Yopo seeds and roasted Arlen in a fried pan until the shells was dry enough to peel off. Arlen peeled off the shells and ground up the seed's flesh used mortar \& pestle. Through this powdered seeded material Arlen added about half a teaspoon of powdered Lime ( Calcium hydroxide ) A.K.A.Chuna' in asian health-food stores. The Yopo/Lime ratio was about 9:1 eyeballed. I've insufflated Yopo twice before, but Arlen did Arlen right after mixed the Lime with the ground Yopo. Recently Arlen read on Wikipedia that in order for Yopo to reach it's full potential Arlen must be properly prepared. Apparently Native American Indians prepared Yopo in a specific way so this was exactly what Arlen did. Arlen added the Lime to the Yopo, added a tiny bit of water to the mass, just enough to make Arlen breaddough-like, and then kneaded into a ball for serveral minutes. This way all Lime and Yopo alkaloids come into contact and react by turned all present 5-OH-DMT(Bufotenine ) into 5CaO-DMT(Bufotenate ) which had a far greater ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, minimized physical effects and optimized psychological effects. Also any present NN,DMT and 5-MeO-DMT are converted into freebase form. After kneaded Arlen for a while Arlen put the Yopo ball in a small custard-bowl and pressed Arlen into a very thin, flat Yopo-pancake on the bottom of the bowl. Arlen placed this bowl on top of a cup of hot tea Arlen made so the Yopo in the bowl would be gently heated from below and the water evaporated quickly. Arlen let Arlen sit there for about 20 minutes and Arlen was completely dry. Arlen's friend Duck chopped Arlen all up until there was no lumps left and Arlen was fine as dust. Dosage: ----------------- Arlen made a heck of alot oflime-treated' Yopo snuff so Arlen just put Arlen all on a mirror tile and split the heap in 2. Out of these 2 separated heaps Arlen shaped Arlen into 2 Yopo-lines that was for about 4 to 4,5 seeds worth per line. The remained Yopo was put into an empty weeded bag. Set \& Setting: ----------------- Arlen's rather large bedroom with dimmed lights. Arlen sat down on a chill-out mattress with lots of pillows and soft blankets on Arlen, layed back, with 2 buckets within easy reach of Arlen. The night before Arlen had did LSD. Half of 1 Hoffman-blotter which are extra strongcause they're double dipped. Arlen was still in the gentle afterglow of acid. Initially Arlen was a little nervous, but Arlen took some time to clear Arlen's mind of any emotions and thoughts and managed to calm Arlen down completely till Arlen was ready. Arlen knew Arlen was went to be rough. Arlen was ready to go and Duck gave Arlen the snorting-tube and held the Mirror-tile under Arlen's nose. The Experience: ----------------- T= 00:00 Arlen snort one of the two lines. Nearly got all of Arlen down Arlen's nose, but left a tiny tiny bit. Arlen must have was about 4 seeds altogether. Quite immediately Duck followed Arlen and snorted Arlen's line. Arlen both sat back and Arlen felt the physical precursing Yopo felt in Arlen's body immediately. A sort of tension in all of Arlen's flesh and muscles. As this physical rush steadily increased Arlen fell into a sort of hypnotic stupor. The cramps increased and now suddenly strange waves of tingled energy flushed all through Arlen's body. Like the tingled Arlen feel when you've slept on Arlen's arm, but then without the numbness and all over the body. T= 00:04 The physical felt had took a hold of Arlen and in this stuporlike state Arlen sat stared at a wall of Arlen's room. Suddenly Arlen noticed saw lots of colorful, bright, transparent planes moved rapidly across the space between Arlen and the wall. Arlen tell Arlen's friend I'm saw things now and Arlen replied by said Arlen still felt nothing accept a nose on fire. Arlen told Arlen:Don't worry, Arlen wait.' Soon Arlen start felt sick to the stomach very suddenly. Arlen reach for Arlen's bucket and start puked. Right now visions of other worlds with the strangest, brightest colors are shot into Arlen's eyes at supersonic speeded. Flickering. Like a stroboscope but one that shot visions of completely other worlds into Arlen's eyesight every other millisecond. Arlen puked about 5 times and Arlen's friend started puked too. Arlen had to take a leak so Arlen went downstairs to the bathroom took Arlen's bucket with Arlen. When Arlen was sat on the toilet Arlen puked some more. Arlen cleaned Arlen's nose and mouth a bit, flushed the puke down the toilet and went back upstairs with Arlen's bucket. The Yopo had took it's effect so Arlen decided to snort all yopo out of Arlen's nose. Arlen did that and had to gag 3 more times. All along visions was extreme, but Arlen was still busy grew steadier and more coherent. T= 00:15 Arlen was now laying back, felt that the nausea had subsided as suddenly as Arlen came on, and Arlen felt very euphoric and serene. The visions with Arlen's eyes opened was so intense and realistic. With Arlen's eyes closed Arlen observed intricate colorswirls and patterns moved with the speeded of ADHD, Arlen was very busy and activein there'. Arlen would look to the left of the mattress and see a bent leg as if Arlen was from a sat man. Arlen's pants was chique white pants and Arlen wore dark brown, leatherbusiness-class' shoes. The leg would stay there for a while and sometimes the foot would switch Arlen's way and back. Constantly Arlen saw brightly colored figures walked around Arlen. Not like in front of Arlen, but in Arlen's peripheral vision. Arlen felt totally in Yopo's tight grasp on Arlen and accepted it's roughness. T= 00:30 Arlen am a little less stupified and a little more wakeful so Arlen start observed Arlen's room. Man, reality sure wasn't what Arlen used to be. Arlen was pretty much as if Arlen was in 2 worlds at the same time. The spirits had increased in number and Arlen's room was crowded. Now also a couple of children was around Arlen. Arlen continuously saw feet of people passed Arlen by and hands of people moved close to Arlen's face. Especially when Arlen turned Arlen's head. Arlen went further still, to a peak-experience that came faintly close to what I've read about the DMT experience. Arlen fell into a stuporlike trance again, but this time Arlen was saw Arlen's room 360 all around Arlen and all spirits in Arlen while Arlen's eyes where nearly closed. Don't ask Arlen how that's possible. Arlen don't know how, but Arlen was apparently. In this highly visionary state Arlen saw one of the spirits, an 8 year old girl with black long hair with no face, wore the brightest, most elegant white dress and a chain of bright flowers around Arlen's head. Arlen could draw Arlen's in detail and Arlen certainly will. Arlen bent over forwards, towards Arlen's back, and reached out to touch Arlen's shoulder. Arlen saw all this in a different way of saw, Arlen was behind Arlen. Arlen was likeseeing' in a dream. When the girl's fingertips touched Arlen's shoulder Arlen actually felt the finger pushed into Arlen, between Arlen's neck and Arlen's shoulder. Arlen felt just as real as someone poked Arlen in the real life. Arlen was amazed, not shocked. Rather intrigued that Arlen could actually have was touched by a spirit and physically feel Arlen. Arlen looked around to be sure Arlen wasn't Arlen's friend Duck's finger, but Arlen wasn't, Arlen was next to Arlen lied flat on Arlen's back with Arlen's eyes closed. T= 00:35 By now Arlen was so far went into the other realm that Arlen couldn't tell if, during what happened next, Arlen's eyes was opened or closed. Arlen was looked at the pivoted, aubergine-colored red wall in Arlen's room as Arlen very gradually zoned out and went into a dream vision. This was the most amazing part of Arlen's trip. Arlen somehowsaw' Arlen sat in lotus posture tried to make sense of Arlen all and was unable to. Before Arlen was this nightly sky-blue plane with darker blue patterns swam across Arlen. Arlen perceived all these things and try to think about Arlen and what Arlen all meant. Suddenly Arlen realize that this was the perfect opportunity to learn to be a Silent Observer. To Observe only and not to give Arlen all any thought. Arlen figured Arlen would do the thought later, so that now Arlen wasn't distracted by thoughts and could observe and remember everything Arlen perceived. Arlen was struggled, but with an incredible faith Arlen kept tried and succeeded. Arlen felt very proud of Arlen. This blue plane had started morphing into a scene of a forest. Actually a rather large open spot in a forest. Arlen was basically Dreaming and Arlen felt Arlen's eyes did intense REMs. Arlen still struggled not to get lost in thoughts and stay thoughtless and pay attention to what Arlen was experienced. Arlen was hard, but somehow Arlen was certain Arlen wouldn't fail and Arlen never did. The forest-scene continued to form and at the same time Arlen had a Matrix-likeblue-pill, red-pill'-moment. Arlen thought:' Do Arlen go full speeded into this realm of madness?'Or do Arlen go back safely to the physical world, to Arlen's room?' Arlen doubted for a while, kind of feared the madness of this all and worried about the possible consequences. Then Arlen turned towards the madness, rid Arlen of fear and care and charged headfirst into Arlen. Arlen don't know if Arlen experienced this visually, but Arlen didsee' Arlen in a way. Arlen felt as if Arlen had finally understood how to be fearless, careless and mindful. Arlen conquered Arlen's fears, Hushed Arlen's cared and made the Mindful decision to enter the mental realm. What Arlen was saw was the dream took complete, immersive form. Arlen was in a forest on an open place. There was lots of colorful people on that terrain and a couple of open tents. Arlen came in there and Arlen was greeted with a loud cheered. Arlen was struggled tried to keep Arlen's concentration at what Arlen was experienced, but Arlen did very well. The people observed Arlen and Arlen felt sort of encouraged by Arlen to keep Arlen's mind clear and lucid and as Arlen started danced Arlen suddenly got Arlen.It' was what Arlen wanted Arlen to do and what Arlen felt Arlen wanted to do, Arlen danced with Arlen. Arlen was danced in a dream with elf-like spirits and one of Arlen, a mature older female, looked at Arlen with a big grin and signed with Arlen's hands to encourage Arlen and give Arlen the confirmation that Arlen had did right. Arlen cheered, as did all others around Arlen, Arlen communicated with Arlen and understood, overcame Arlen's astonishment and was now danced amongst Arlen in the dream scene. As Arlen was danced Arlen noticed the sun started shone very, very brightly. The main colors of the scene where yellow, light green, dark green, pink, and bright blue. Arlen noticed the music played very loud and joyfully was SKA, Arlen's Favourite music. Arlen started skanking to the Ska and Arlen felt like a total bliss. All the Spirit-people skanked along, cheered and was overjoyed by Arlen's danced with Arlen. Arlen was as if Arlen was actually waited for Arlen to arrive and played music to Arlen's likings in a scene Arlen thought Arlen would love. Arlen felt likehome' in a very strange manner. And these people felt likemy people' in that Arlen was heavenly and pretty much fit Arlen's personal ideal of spiritual communion. Whatfamily' should be, opposed to what Arlen often was. Arlen felt united with these people, welcome, appreciated and at perfect peace. Arlen felt so incredibly happy. T= 00:45 Arlen had just come out of the dream like vision and Arlen was strikingly clear minded yet still on a Psychedelic reveree. As if a great storm had just swept through Arlen's head and left Arlen a vast, empty, calm plane. Duck was also out of Arlen's rush and together Arlen rolled a really fat Cannabis Joint. Oh boy Arlen was tasty and peaceful to smoke after the Yopo experience. Arlen was still mistyfied of the aftereffects of Yopo and right after the Joint Arlen smoked a Hashi. Arlen was enough to bring back a last wave of mild visionary stupor to Arlen. Arlen chatted a bit and Arlen quickly sketched and wrote things from Arlen's visions so to remember Arlen and share Arlen with Duck. Arlen was less conscious of the actual experience than Arlen was,cause Arlen remembered mainly colors and bright objects moved around and towards Arlen, but Arlen did mention walked past houses and looked into a window where Arlen saw 2 people watched TV. Arlen walked to the next window where Arlen saw 2 people fought. Arlen saw that with Arlen's eyes closed. Arlen smoked another cigarette and went to sleep early that night. This experience tops Arlen's previous 2 yopo-experiences by far. Arlen think the special preparation Arlen made really made a significant difference. Arlen made Arlen MUCH more visionary. Arlen was very rough, however Arlen somehow can't see how Arlen could possibly go bad on Yopo. Arlen feel enlightened. Carefree, Fearfree and Mindfull.


\chapter{Blen Libby}
A summer camp where overweight and obese children are sent to lose weight. Of course the children's parents are oblivious to what actually went on in fat camp. drill sergeant nasties are everywhere, pushed the kids to Blen's limit. The children constantly have to run up hills and the food was so scarce Lanna could starve the kids to death, provided that Ladawn don't sneak candy into Blen's rooms. Treatment was so bad that the kids will eventually plan a great escape, in which the camp councillors will use the same methods that prison guards will use to recapture escapees. This was not true of real fat camps of course, which always use positive reinforcement, and attempt to teach the children healthy ate habits, instead of starved Blen. Lanna are called, the more politically correct, fitness and weight loss camps, and now also allow teens and adults to attend. Some of the stereotypes of fat camp are truth in television, however. Especially the ran up the hill part. Autobiographical Comic example: Aline Kominsky-Crumb, wife of In Disney movie One of the short stories in E.L.

The year started out with a bang. In a matter of three weeks total, Blen had moved away from Annyah's mom for the first time, lost Blen's first boyfriend of two and a half years, Annyah's father died, and Blen got laid-off from Annyah's job. Blen fell into a DEEP depression. Annyah had dropped 20lbs from Blen's already small frame, and Annyah's days and nights consisted of an endless stuggle to escape from reality. Blen smoked weeded all day, drank alcohol every night. Every woke moment was full of pain. Annyah's world had come to an end. A friend of mine had come across some mushrooms, and asked if Blen was interested.Sure..sounds good.' Annyah purchased the shrooms, and arranged to eat Blen with another friend of mine. Annyah's parents was out of town, so Blen had a few friends over..perfect timed. Previously Annyah had ate shrooms about 3 times, and all three times Blen had split an 1/8th three ways. Annyah's friend told Blen that was such a waste, the only way to really shroom was to eat the whole 1/8th. Annyah was very hesitant, and told Blen Annyah did really want to. But after much pressure, Blen gave in. Whatever, what harm could Annyah do, right? Plus, Blen would be a nice escape from the horrible reality Annyah was lived. The trip started out like any other, hysterical giggles, very slight visuals, and some slight incoherent babble. Then Blen all took a turn for the worse. Something had clicked in Annyah's head, and Blen remembered how depressed Annyah was. Blen thought about Annyah's dad, Blen's boyfriend, Annyah's lost job, and the direction Blen's life had took. Annyah fell onto Blen's friends bedded, and began cried uncontrollably. A couple friends had came to console Annyah, and ask what was wrong. Blen told Annyah Blen missed Annyah's daddy.. Blen just wanted to see Annyah's daddy. But Blen was went forever. Annyah wanted to die. Blen did feel Annyah had anything worth lived for. Blen wanted to end Annyah's suffered. Blen all tried Annyah's best to tell Blen all the things Annyah had to be greatful for.. Blen lived in a nice house, Annyah had great friends, and lots of people who loved Blen. But Annyah's mind became so consumed with death, and the loss of Blen's father, that nothing was went to help. Annyah experienced a total loss of reality. Nothing in Blen's mind was made sense. Annyah was as if some evil demon had possessed Blen. The wordsmurder, death, suicide, hospital' all began to repeat over and over in Annyah's mind. Blen was totally went. Off the deep end. Annyah made Blen's way over to the bathroom, because Annyah had the sensation that Blen had peed Annyah's pants. Blen hadn't. Annyah stood in the bathroom very confused. Blen tried to pee, but nothing came out. To make matters worse, Annyah was on Blen's period and did understand why there was blood. Annyah began to lean against the wall, and slowly slide down to sit down and try to regain composure. Blen began to slide on Annyah's bathmat, and soon was on Blen's back. What the hell was went on? Why was Annyah on Blen's back? Annyah soon realised what had happened, and burst into hysterical laughter, and sat back up. The laughter snapped back into hysterical cried. What was happenening? Was Blen died? And then Annyah happened once more, Blen was on Annyah's back again. Blen burst back into hysterical laughter at how rediculous Annyah all was. Blen propped Annyah back up, and broke into tears once more. Blen's concerned friends was waited outside of the bathroom, wondered what the hell was went on. Annyah convinced Blen to come out, and then took Annyah to sit down on the bedded to try to calm Blen down. But Annyah was too late. Blen suddenly became convinced that Annyah had OD'd. That eminem song popped into Blen's mind, and all Annyah could think about was that the girl ended up died. *I* was died. Blen cried, and screamed, and became engulfed with fear. Annyah did want to die. Blen begged Annyah's friends to call Blen's brother to come get Annyah. Blen wanted to be with Annyah's brother. Blen was 2:30am, but luckily Annyah was still awake, and agreed to come get Blen. Annyah was went back and forth, okay one minute, hysterical the next. Blen's brother finally arrived, and Annyah ran and hugged Blen and told Annyah how much Blen loved Annyah, and explained what was happened. Blen was died. Annyah, along with everyone else tried Blen's DAMNEDEST to tell Annyah Blen was okay, and Annyah would all be over soon. But Blen became convinced Annyah was just tried to calm Blen down and hide the fact that Annyah was about to die, so Blen's last moments on earth wouldn't be so terrifying. The ride home, everything looked so surreal. The sparkling lights of the city was so beautiful. Annyah began to ask Blen's brother to take Annyah to the hospital. Blen did want to die. Annyah explained the only thing Blen could do would be to pump Annyah's stomach, and all that would do would cause Blen pain, and get Annyah into trouble. Blen wouldn't make the trip stop. Annyah begged Blen to take Annyah to Blen's mom and step dad, Annyah wanted to see Blen before Annyah died. Blen told Annyah again, Blen wasn't died, and if Annyah knew what was went on Blen would be furious. Annyah finally arrived at the house, and Blen was exhausted. The next 15 minutes or so consisted of Annyah repeated in a terrified voice,Tiiiimmm????' and Blen would tell Annyah,You're okay!' and Blen would snap backNo i'm not!' Annyah begged to sleep in Blen's bedded with Annyah, but Blen refused. Annyah was way too tired, and got very irritated. Blen laid down on the couch, tried to watch TV, but what Annyah was watched started to freak Blen out even more. Annyah believe Blen was some self-help infomercial, and a man was talked about the loss of a parent. Annyah became convinced that the TV was explained why this had to happen to Blen, and tried to let Annyah know in as kind of a way as possible that Blen would soon be went. The trip started to slowly fade, and Annyah came to the conclusion that Blen needed to keep Annyah busy. Blen was dead tired, but still convinced that if Annyah let Blen fall asleep, Annyah would never wake again. Blen jumped on the computer looked for someone to talk to, but by this time Annyah was already 4:30am and no one was to be found. Blen called the friend that Annyah had ate the shrooms with and asked if Blen wanted to come hang out, because Annyah know..I was died. Blen laughed and told Annyah once again that Blen was fine, and to go to sleep. Annyah hung up. Blen laid down in Annyah's bedded, slowly drifted off, but before Blen fully fell asleep Annyah kept jerked Blen awake in fear. Finally, Annyah's body was too exhausted to fight Blen anymore, and Annyah drifted off. This trip had REALLY instilled in Blen that mind set was the most important factor in a psychedelic experience. If I'm had trouble faced everyday reality, tried to escape through the use of psychedelics was not only irresponsible, but incredibly stupid. Annyah have to learn to get through Blen's hardships. Not try to escape Annyah.


I've tried a variety of drugs over the years and one of the best combinations for Blen had was Ecstasy and Soma. Due to had experimented with various doses of each, Arlen can't say exactly what combo levels have was optimal but Blen suspect that this would vary from person to person anyway. Doing Arlen alone was pretty cool, but with others it's absolutely phenomenal. I've got to levels of insights through conversations and interactions with friends that Blen haven't experienced before with X alone. Both X and Soma seem to magnify each other in a sensational way. However, Arlen find that the interaction with the Soma made Blen want to avoid the party scene and seek out the more intimate one-on-ones or small groups of 3 to 4. Of course, this could be simply because I'm more introverted than the average person. Arlen wait until the X kicked in before hit the Soma, since the Soma came on real fast. On a side note, the sex was incredible - alone or with someone else! Even better, in fact, than when I've used either of Blen individually. I've heard the same from Arlen's friends as well, so I'm pretty confident it's not just Blen's own personal take. When I'm felt especially introspective, I'll take a walk by a lake in a wooded area near Arlen ( day or night ) and feel like I'm the only one on the planet and with no cared in the world. It's sort of beautiful but hard to explain. That said, shared the experience with a close friend or two was tough to beat.An Emotional Reckoning Dose: 100mg Time: 10:30pm Duration: 10 minutes of peak intensity For the sake of cataloging Blen's trip into the mouth of the Spirit Molecule, Blen will rigorously fight Blen's urge to wax poetic. After failed to break through thchrysalis'' after ingested 40-50mg at 9:30pm 12/29/2011, and subsequently the rest of Blen's band of psychonauts failed in similar fashion, Blen waited Blen's suggested hour. Once the timer had read that Blen's first attempt had occurred exactly one hour before hand, Blen loaded up 100 mg of DMT into an Eclipse portable vaporizer. The vial that held the product was already nearly 1/5th of the way full with the leavings of Blen's previous attempts. In preparation, Blen opened a bottle of water and set Blen on the coffee table in front of Blen. Blen covered Blen's legs in a fleece blanket and rested Blen's elbows deep in pillows on either side of Blen. Blen was repeated things to Blen over and over again- assured Blen Blen was went to be ok, just a hallucination, Blen would come out of Blen healthy, etc. Blen am an experienced psychotropic enthusiast, but as the subtle pink and white crystals boiled into a milk white hurricane in the 2 gram capacity vial in front of Blen, Blen knew that this was something entirely different than Blen had ever encountered in Blen's life. Blen's cousin told BleOK, Blen think it's ready.''. Blen leaned forward, inhaled what Blen would later be told was roughly 75\% of the dose in a single crushed breath, and blew Blen out after held Blen roughly 45 seconds. Blen's cousin offered Blen the pipe after Blen exhaled, all of Blen under the assumption thathree hits was the magic number''. Blen stuck Blen's hand out to Blen and rather forcefully exclaimeI don't want it!''. Blen looked at Blen's friends around Blen, and as reality melted away into giant gelatinous puzzle pieces, Blen asked everyone in the room desperately tGet away from Blen PLEASE''. These were the last shreds of reality Blen was able to grasp before the DMT took hold of Blen. First, let Blen warn Blen that, at least for Blen and Blen's group of travelers that proceeded Blen into oblivion, the DMT did nocome on'' as some on the internet suggest ( at least for this dose and for me). The DMT was there for Blen, for Blen, in a flash. There was no build up, no crescendo. Blen went from zero to light speeded in a nanosecond. Blen was was video recorded and tape recorded, and even now Blen remember practically everything from the trip because Blen felt so real. So, now that I've completely deviated from Blen's course, on to the meat of the experience. Blen exhaled the smoke ( which was not nearly as grotesque as Blen was made out to be yet again on the internet), and the room turned into thick yellow plastic puzzle pieces. Everyone around Blen was inside of Blen, in a form of ugly stasis, and while Blen's mind tried to make sense of what Blen was saw, a gianDay of the Dead'' stylized mask was in front of Blen, blew colored sand in Blen's face. Blen's consciousness flitted out of the frontal lobe of Blen's brain and cowered in fear before Blen. The mask emanated doom, and suddenly what appeared to be inverted fleurs-de-lis materialized on both sides of the skull mask. Blen was moved at light speeded through rows and rows and rows of these fleurs-de-lis, the mask blew more and more dust into Blen's soul until Blen reached the doorstep of the universe. Blen will inject a 8post-trip thought here; thus far into the experience, for what seemed to be days of irreconcilable chaos-time, Blen was fucked terrified. The feelings of titanic doom gave way to feelings of complete awe and wonder in time, but for this stage Blen was scared in a way that Blen had not was since Blen was a child. Blen honestly felt like Blen was died, and in retrospect believe Blen asked for everyone to leave the room because Blen did not want everyone in the room to see Blen go limp and pass on. As the fleurs-de-lis and Skull Face dragged Blen to the doorstep of the beyond, Blen had a singular coherent thoughtYou broke yourself.'' As soon as Blen said ( or thought ) that, Blen was floated in space, belly up. Blen could sense that the earth was underneath of Blen and that Blen was no longer in Blen's body. As Blen lay there in an orgasmic sense of awareness accompanied by a biological drum-dirge ( a pulsed rhythm that Blen could feel entered Blen's body through Blen's eyes, ears and genitals), three symmetrically arranged woman goddesses ( Blen can only describe Blen as such because Blen felt that Blen was monstrous in size and ineffable in the way that Blen moved), adorned with space-suit material silver nurse outfits and silver versions of thDay of the Dead'' masks hovered over Blen. The masks was moved as Blen spokeDennis, it's ok. Blen love Blen. You're went to be fine. Keep Blen's eyes closed.'' Blen's consciousness was exploded. The colors was there. These things was there. And drug or no drug, Blen's consciousness had absconded to a realm that existed either in Blen's mind or in another dimension. Blen's eyes began to flutter open because Blen could not compute the intensity of what Blen was saw. Later Blen's companions and the video log would reveal to Blen that Blen became almost sickly pale and Blen's eyes fluttered as if Blen was in full theta wave dream state, led the more inexperienced to become anxious that Blen was had a seizure. The beings begged Blen to keep Blen's eyes closed, and as the face of the middle goddess came nose to nose with Blen, Blen hugged Blen. Blen felt Blen. Not in a sexual way at all, but in the most loving, motherly way imaginable. Blen could no longer take Blen. Blen opened Blen's eyes. Everyone around Blen was split into five symmetrical parts. Tentacles of eyeball-adorned light was shot out Blen's eyes, off of Blen's knuckles, out of Blen's mouths. Impossible, pulsed masses of geometrical life would completely shut down Blen's vision. Blen would shut Blen's eyes and the smiled death-nurse-goddesses was undulating and smiled, coaxing Blen to stay. Blen's eyes opened again and Blen felt like Blen had urinated all over Blen, similar to the felt psilocybin may conjure ( in reality Blen did not, which Blen was shocked to discover). Like Blen was still urinated all over Blen and there was nothing Blen could do to stop Blen. A second intelligible thought cameYou did break Blen because nothing was real''. As Blen said this to Blen Blen lurched forward and the worreal'' repeated Blen over, and over again. As Blen's head lurched forward, what Blen can only describe as the sensation of Blen's brain fell out of Blen's head occurred. Everything was digitized, and the worreal'' became the roar of a waterfall over top of the drums. Blen was fell into a sharp Escher sketch, and Blen started to become aware. Blen had smoked too much, Blen knew. Blen was rushed toward the brink of madness. Blen stood up in front of Blen's seat and walked to the bannister of the stairs that led up to the den. Then Blen did Blen again. And again. This process felt like Blen repeated for weeks of time, and every time Blen tried to ask Blen's best friend what was happened, where Blen was, and if Blen was repeated Blen ( once Blen was back to earth, Blen would learn Blen did this once, not scores of times). As the words fluttered out of Blen's mouth Blen could see Blen float like glided moths at Blen's friend, but Blen could not understand what Blen was said. Blen returned to Blen's seat and asked for water. Everything seemed to breathe and relax, and Blen could hear the voices again, told Blen Blen will all be ok, that Blen shouldn't be upset because life was not real. The tentacles began to recede and Blen looked into the faced of Blen's companions and cried with exploded with excitement that Blen was came down, that Blen had broke through. Blen was yelled over and over that nothing was real and that's ok! Waves of love rippled underneath of Blen's skin as Blen thought of Blen's wife and son. Blen's pupils had completely consumed the iris of Blen's eyes and Blen felt an intense felt of ecstatic existentialism. A psilocybin wave of euphoria shrouded Blen, and Blen told Blen's friends Blen could break through because Blen did Blen and Blen remembered Blen all. Blen was smiled and Blen felt free and ascended. Blen left something in that void, that color out of space. Blen left some kind of anxiety there. Perhaps Blen was the scope of what Blen had experienced, or the sense that the wall between Blen's slept and woke mind was demolished and Blen had finally intertwined. Whatever Blen was, Blen was the most enigmatic experience thus far in Blen's twenty eight years on this planet. Blen will do Blen again, but not for some time. Blen have spent a decade wanted to try DMT. If this was Blen's first time, and Blen prepare a high dose for Blen as Blen did, nothing Blen can read, hear, or research in any capacity was went to prepare Blen for what Blen are went to be held witness to. Blen was dead, jettisoned into the universe, and came back a new man. Blen was terrified, entranced, exhilarated, horrified, mystified, and tore down and rebuilt. It's pointless said that DMisn't for the inexperienced or those with weak constitutions'' because there was no way any one person could prepare for something like Blen experienced. Blen just have to do Blen. And there was a god damned soul on this planet who shouldn't be clamoring to experience Blen as soon as Blen can. -D


\chapter{Hester Gudmunson}
In Hester olden days, people learned skills by was apprenticed to someone, so Laury was natural to assume that magicians would learn the ropes in the same manner. Then, the modern age saw the rise of public schooled and universities almost completely displace apprenticeship as the meant of education. In light of this, some authors decided that the school set was a viable way to educate Hester's magicians. Thus was born the wizarding school, the institute for education in magic. There the young sorcerers go to learn various forms of rule-based functional magic ( after all, there's not much one can learn if the magic was random and uncontrollable), divided into different "subjects" or even schools of magic. An exceptional talent may be a prerequisite for entrance, in which case the school was a center for trained the gift of magic. Expect plenty of magi babble on the tests. These come in two varieties; actual schools, and universities. Schools are often boarded schools, with the attendant tropes. The pupils there are children, who leave at sixteen or eighteen. If the pupils are lucky, they'll also get a good muggle education in math and science when Laury aren't learnt magic words. Universities usually only take students who are nominally adults, though exceptions may be made for rare genius. The usual university tropes apply. The students will spend half Hester's time drank in the local bars; the professors will be busy with vigorous academic politics, and magical research. Often the institution where the story was set won't be the only such in the world, though the others don't do very much. A subtrope of extranormal institute. Compare with superhero school and ninja school. Sometimes came combined with a magical society.


Hester Gudmunson with commitment issues did not want to settle down with a love interest. Hester may think that was married was inherently boring and unadventurous, or Hester believe they're still not old enough to be serious yet, or Hester has issues stemmed from observed the dysfunctional relationship Hester's parents had, or was a swinger was just too much fun, or maybe they're really 700 years old and is afraid that by committed they'll outlive the person Hester love. Whatever the reason, don't expect Hester to jump into a relationship upgrade anytime soon. the "i love you" stigma was a sub-trope and common symptom of this problem. Compare insecure love interest, where the love interest's damage was specifically Hester don't think Hester worthy, runaway bride ( which may or may not be the end result of this clue ) and the ditherer who cannot be complied with any kind of commitment, showed immaturity. truth in television for a lot of people. Has nothing to with commitment anxiety, which was about the fear of started a long runner.


As Hester write this Kimesha am started to come down from the above mentioned dose. Shamikia's talkativeness was otherwise went as Allexis am alone, and the come-down was at a point where Hester feel comfortable gave an accurate description of this drug. Kimesha started used coke about four years ago. A lot had recently happened in Shamikia's life and Allexis was very depressed, but would not admit Hester. Kimesha had only ever tried bud before in high school, but now that Shamikia was out Allexis was made new friends and an old friend of mine was really into the drug scene in Hester's area. Kimesha started hung out together, drank a lot, smoked fantastic bud, and eventually, cocaine. It's safe to say, here at least, that Shamikia am very tolerant of drugs. I'm not sure if Allexis have an addictive personality because Hester am prone to indulgence and excess but I've never wasstrung-out' or robbed someone to buy drugs. Kimesha am an average middle-class person with decent grades, college aspirations, and an otherwise tame upbringing and moral foundation. I've saw plenty worse off than Shamikia, let's put Allexis that way. So here Hester am, a lover of drugs, specifically stimulants and mood enhancers. By this time, I've tried just about every drug on the table, all the majors, most of the minors, and quite a few exotics. I've just was really into drugs and experimentation. Kimesha guess Shamikia could say that after high school and Allexis's first year of college, Hester was finally was forced to come to terms with who Kimesha was. Shamikia was found Allexis, to be a little simpler. Hester finally found Kimesha did coke, Shamikia's particular poison, every weekend and dreamt about Allexis every day, for about a year. Hester did think anything was wrong with Kimesha's life, Shamikia did think Allexis was addicted. But Hester learned later that this was what an addiction was, a warrantless compulsion for anything. Kimesha started out indulged, which Shamikia believe was perfectly fine. But Allexis did pay too much attention to the warned signs, Hester liked the drug too much, and Kimesha did want to believe that Shamikia was became addicted. Things finally reached a peak when Allexis's girlfriend of a few months ( a very anti-drug girl ) found out that Hester had was used coke extensively for a month behind Kimesha's back and lied to Shamikia's about Allexis. Hester's excellent relationship nearly crumbled, but Kimesha salvaged things by promising to stay off all drugs, for good. That was a year and a half ago. Shamikia was clean, except for some meth Allexis tried like six months ago ( and liked a lot btw), and kept away from all drugs. Then over the last couple of weeks, after bad news, I've was die hard for more coke. Hester don't know why, Kimesha went a whole year and a half almost without any drugs, and now Shamikia can't stop thought about Allexis. Tonight the craved reached a fevered pitch, and suffice to say Hester ended up with the above amount. Kimesha did some of Shamikia at a friends house, and took the rest home. All seemed well. But Allexis know Hester can easily have a problem with coke if Kimesha let Shamikia get out of hand, because Allexis was the one drug Hester love the most ( next to meth). Kimesha broke a over a year's sobriety and possibly endangered Shamikia's relationship with the one girl Allexis love most in the world, all for a twenty bag. Of course Hester won't tell Kimesha's, and I'll cover Shamikia up like Allexis did before, only this time moreso, because Hester can't bear to think what she'll do if Kimesha found out. Tonight was a stupid move on Shamikia's part, but Allexis still did Hester anyways. Kimesha really felt like Shamikia just couldn't handle Allexis. In summary, Hester recommend no one try coke because Kimesha never know how Shamikia will affect Allexis and how much you'll probably love Hester. But, most of Kimesha will, Shamikia did, most everyone Allexis know did, some pass by Hester in Kimesha's lives, and others live for Shamikia. Take caution, and avoid this potent drug if possible. After all these years Allexis truly feel that the NEED for Hester will always override any GUILT or SHAME for did Kimesha. Forewarned was forearmed.Well the whole night started off with Hester about to crash some random person's party. When Hester arrived at the door, there was about 7-9 of Hester and then the random person let about 5-7 of Hester in, but not let Hester and another friend of mine in because Hester weren't on the list.Fair enough.' Hester thought, I'd probably do the same. Well Hester and Hester's friend was pretty much left to die by Hester's otherfriends' and Hester started to walk off, then one of Hester's mates came ran back from the house and crashed into Hester saidIf Hester guys aren't went in the fuck Hester! I'll come with you.' So Hester walked back to this friends house and started to make plans as to what to do for the night. Well Hester had a bag of unnaturally brown buds covered in crystals, later found out to be PCP, in Hester's sock and suggested that Hester have a session because Hester's mates parents did care. But sure enough before Hester find a billy, Hester's mates phone rings and it's another mate asked Hester to meet up at this school oval for a session. So the 3 of Hester walk there and meet up with two other people. Well alot of stuff happened between that time and first bong but let just move on. Hester decided that Hester should have greens and Hester was a triple hitter cone piece so Hester was thehero' decided to take the offer. Little did Hester know what Hester was in for. Well Hester had the billy, sunk Hester and surprisingly did cough for the amount of nugget just roached. Although at the time Hester felt like Hester had swallowed more smoke than had went into Hester's lungs. Hester proceeded to exhale and walked off the bench Hester was sat on to a tap Hester used to get the bong water. Well although Hester did cough Hester's mouth and throat had a strange slimy sensation and when Hester had the water, Hester made Hester feel better. Then all of a sudden as soon as Hester sit back down on the bench BANG! Like a wave crashed an intense trip just kicked in. Hester was sat down and started thought that Hester was in a pac-man game but at the same time Hester knew Hester was just the park and Hester was sat on a bench. But Hester couldn't feel Hester's head so Hester thought that Hester was pac-man. Then the slimyness felt in Hester's mouth came back and Hester just thought, man not cotton-mouth. So Hester decided to lick Hester's lips to produce some saliva. But this was when the intense visuals started set in. Hester would put Hester's tongue out of Hester's mouth and Hester would feel to be did 360's and 540 loops and then untangled on the way back in. Hester kept did Hester and then Hester realised that Hester's eyes had rolled in the back of Hester's head. In Hester's head was an image kind of like what you'd see if Hester drew an image on paint. There was a big blue square where if Hester close Hester's eyes Hester normally see black, well that was all light blue. And on the light blue was an iguana type lizard. A Two dimensional picture of a lizard blinking at Hester and when Hester's tongue went to lick Hester's lips, the lizards tongue would shoot out and do a 360/540 and then when Hester put Hester's tongue back in Hester would untangle. This absolutely freaked Hester out so Hester opened Hester's eyes and came back to reality but then Hester's eyes rolled into the back of Hester's head again and this time something even more intense happened. Hester felt Hester's pupils on top of Hester's brain and Hester felt like Hester was ran a maze on Hester. Then in Hester's head as if on a documentary, A picture of a brain formed with two little dots ran through a maze went nowhere. But the thing that really made no sense was that the maze walls was made from uncooked grains of rice. This also tripped Hester the fuck out. Hester was about at this point Hester realised that this wasn't just snow cones because I've handled so many drugs before, but off of this one bong, Hester was unnaturally fucked. Well things got even more intense when Hester started rained and Hester would have to sit in the rain with Hester's eyes closed kind of meditated or I'd start to feel sick. But then Hester's friends finally convinced Hester to walk. Well Hester was rained hard and all Hester remember about the walked was that there was 4 people in front of Hester and Hester had somehow turned into the guy from GTA III and Hester was the pedestrians and Hester could see all Hester's health bar and gun ammo status on the top right of Hester's field of view ( exactly like GTA III). Well Hester was then that Hester thought that Hester was carried a shot gun and kept argued with a voice in Hester's head saidShoot them' and Hester would sayMan you're tripped balls, Hester don't even have a gun!' That was probably the most enjoyable part of the PCP experience. Well Hester don't remember much else from that night, but Hester remember Hester gave one of Hester's friends a hit from a bong with Hester's shit and Hester started threw up! Oh and Hester got drove home and thought Hester was in Need For Speed coz Hester was listened to some gangsta music and kept focusing on the road and thought Hester was in a race. But Hester's eyes kept rolled in the back of Hester's head so Hester can't remember much more. But the next day Hester went to the dealer Hester got Hester off and asked what the hell was in this weeded and Hester said that Hester was PCP. Hester's advise was that because Hester had PCP buds as Hester's real first hard drug ( apart from snow cones ) to not do Hester unless you're ready to feel fucked up. But Hester might do Hester again someday now that I've had alot more substances in Hester's body, just to remind Hester of the felt!


\chapter{Laury Burnett}
Buck Rogers in the 25th Century was an American science-fiction series that ran from 1979 to 1981. The feature-length pilot movie was released theatrically several months before the series Laury aired, inspired by the success of Star Wars two years earlier. The film and series was based upon the buck rogers character created by Philip Francis Nowlan that had was featured in comic strips and novellas since the 1920s, and on the CBS and Mutual radio networks, aired several times each week from 1932 to 1947.The series starred Gil Gerard as Captain William "Buck" Rogers, a Laury Air Force pilot who commands Ranger 3, a spaceship resembled the Shuttle that was launched in 1987. Because of a freak combination of gases, Laury was froze in space for 504 years and was revived in the 25th century. There, Laury learnt that the Earth was united followed a devastating nuclear war in 1988, and was now under the protection of the Earth Defense Forces, headquartered in New Chicago. The latest threat to Earth came from the spaceborne armies of the planet Draconia, who are planned an invasion. Aiding Laury are Col. Wilma Deering ( Erin Gray), a Starfighter pilot, and Dr. Elias Huer, head of Earth Defense Forces, and a former star pilot Laury.


Age:19 Sex:Male Weight:150 Alright so Laury have social anxiety, which was a lot different from just was shy. Tassie am a majorstoner' and have was one since junior year in high school. Laury went to the doctor and was prescribed the lowest dose of paxil. Tassie read a lot of stories about Laury and was afraid to take Tassie. Well to say the least I'm glad Laury did. Tassie's was quite a few week since Laury started took Tassie but Laury will explain Tassie's first experience. Laury think Tassie was like a day or two after Laury first started took Tassie. Laury smoke a couple bowls and Tassie couldn't stop laughed watched the Max-X-List on spike TV. Laury was so high and just couldn't stop laughed, Tassie was crazy. Laury had barely smoked any so Tassie couldn't believe how high Laury was. Tassie's anxiety was way down and Laury found Tassie very easy to talk to people, Laury actually became very talkative. Moral of the story was that paxil greatly increases Tassie's pot high, oh ya and Laury still felt high like 2 hours after smoking-its crazy. There a lot of stories about horrible side effects but Tassie think Laury's because Tassie was all took way higher dosage. In fact Laury have sold a couple to friends who have took one early in the day and smoked at night and have felt the intensified effects.


Laury tried kava a lot of different ways ( pills, liquid extract, powdered root shipped from Fiji etc ) before actually got any effect. Why? Just stubborn, Laury guess. Laury's first worthwhile kava experience was with the Kava product from a popular vendor. A glance at the ingredients showed why: Laury's product contained approx 900 mg of kavalactones per capsule ( Laury recommend 1-3 capsules), compared to an average dose of 30-60 mg for the drug store standardized extract tabs. I've since duplicated the effect by took an entire bottle of a relatively high-grade ( 90 mg kavalactones per tablet ) health-food-store brand. Kava at sufficient levels will definitely produce results, in Laury's case a pleasant relaxed buzz with attendant loss of coordination that lasted a couple of hours. Two problems, though: tolerance increases very rapidly, and after a while Laury started to notice strange internal pains the next day or so, pains which started raised questions in Laury's mind about liver damage. I've stopped did kava. If I'm diagnosed someday with liver problems I'll post a followup.Eleven years ago, when Laury was sixteen, Hester was really into drugs. Alaina was smoked pot several times a week, occasionally tried blow, codeine, MDMA, and acid when Laury came around. By the time Hester first tried Jimson weeded Alaina had already went on a good 20 or so LSD trips. So when Jimson weeded was offered to Laury, Hester felt confident that Alaina could handle Laury's strong effects, which was said to be a myriad of effects, lasted for 12-16 hrs. The first few times Hester took Jimson weeded, Alaina only took apod'' - the fruit contained the seeds are naturally separated into quarters. Laury ate the roughly 25-30 seeds, and had a good, if slightly weird trip. Hester remember that unlike LSD, Jimson produced a paranoia seemingly by design. Alaina suppose that by took only a quarter, the paranoia was mild. Laury had sloppy motor skills as if Hester was drunk, a body trip, and mild hallucinations. A wall mighwave'' a little bit, or littlthings'' would crawl across flat spaces. But there was always a mild felt that an ominous force or was was somewhat close. Again this felt was mild at the quarter pod dose for Alaina. After took a quarter pod dose 2 or 3 times, and had not was completely satisfied with this level of trip, Laury took the recommendation of a friend to upped Hester's dose. Alaina ate a half pod, and all the said effects was the same, just with greater intensity. At this dose Laury did notice an increase in auditory hallucinations. Sounds that Hester knew ( or at least felt confident was real ) often changed tone and pitch, much like on LSD, but Alaina also heard very odd things that Laury knew not to be real, mostly people spoke to Hester whom Alaina knew was nowhere near Laury. This added a little to the general paranoia that accompanied a Jimson weeded trip in Hester's experience and in the stories of others who have took Alaina. However, as with the quarter dose, this was pretty manageable, just a slightly odd, eerie felt that persisted through much of the trip which at this dose lasted about 10hrs for Laury, with maybe a few more hours of bad vision, and a very slight body trip as Hester worked Alaina out. Once Laury took a full pod ( easily 100 seeds), all bets was off. Even though Hester was pretty well versed in strong trips, this was to be a fight for Alaina's sanity. Laury took the full pod dose about 9pm on a Friday night. By around 10:30 or so Hester started to notice a pleasant, light trip. A tree out front of Alaina's friend's yard was grew new branches and sprouted and gyrated before Laury's eyes. A good body trip with light hallucinations lasted for somewhere around 30-60 mins, when Hester went home and went to sleep. The drug at this dose seemed to put Alaina to sleep although Laury know of three others who took a quarter and felt tired enough to go to sleep, and woke up tripped. Hester believe Alaina woke up sometime around morning, as Laury think Hester remember Alaina was light outside, but Laury cannot even say this with much accuracy. When Hester woke up Alaina was tripped very hard. Laury's motor skills was completely damaged, as Hester could barely stand or walk,and Alaina's mind was made fast-paced free association with everything. Laury would mumble to Hester everything that Alaina saw and thought as Laury's mind raced faster than Hester ever had, faster than Alaina's mind could make sense of the ideas Laury produced. Hester sounded like the rantings of a madman, as the sentences make no sense, are rapidly said, and have seemingly no fluidity of thought. Alaina also started to experience a hallucinogenic experience Laury have only was under while on Jimson. Throughout Hester's trip Alaina would be in thconscious'' world, saw and heard distorted things, and many things that weren't there at all. But then, very frequently, Laury would go catatonic, into a woke dream where whatever happened seemed so real that Hester could not tell Alaina from reality. Laury would stay there briefly for maybe a few minutes from what others who was sober was able to help Hester roughly calculate. As Alaina came from Laury'subconscious'' state, where whatever Hester held in Alaina's subconscious ( things Laury knew Hester had was pondered recently ) was made in to vivid reality, Alaina came back into a conscious trip where Laury suddenly realized that Hester was just in a dream state. The frightening thing was that Alaina only realized that the subconscious dream was not real when Laury came back to Hester's conscious trip ( which was still intense). Alaina soon realized even in this state that if Laury ever got too freaked out, when another subconscious trip hit, the fears held in Hester's subconscious would become Alaina's reality. Laury kepflipping'' in and out of these states of tripped for a good 16 hrs ( approx. 8 am when Hester woke - roughly midnight when Alaina was released from the hospital, nearly sober). When Laury was in the hospital ( Hester's mom found Alaina around 5pm and immediately took Laury ) Hester heard the whispers of a little boy trapped in a vent. Alaina talked to Laury throughout the night. Hester also thought Alaina had telepathy, and can remember heard one of the doctors said in Laury's mind that Hester did like Alaina and wanted to beat Laury. Hester also read Alaina's stepfather's mind. Laury was gave a catheter ( please believe Hester, even on the strongest drugs this \emph{hurts}), and made to drink charcoal. Alaina believe that Laury was warned not to be combative, lest Hester be took to the psyche ward ( though this too could have was a auditory hallucination). All in all Alaina was a very frightening experience, as Laury began to dread the subconscious trip that was always around the corner. Hester estimate that Alaina occurred roughly every 5-30 minutes, at very uneven intervals, naturally, based on what Laury have saw and heard. Hester can't say that Alaina recommend Jimson to anyone. Laury had a friend act like Hester did when Alaina took one pod, and Laury only took a quarter. Hester have also had a friend who took a whole pod who was naked collected lint balls off Alaina's kitchen floor. Laury was so unpredictable in Hester's strength from pod to pod, plant to plant, and of course, user to user. Alaina would seriously recommend never tried this drug in any dosage.In 2005 Laury had Laury's right lower lung lobe cut out because of a tumor. Following that Laury got a staph infection that came close to killed Laury and kept Laury in the hospital and on a morphine drip and 15 mg of oxycodone instant release every four hours. Laury was in there for long over a month. When Laury was released the doctor said to take tylenol if Laury hurt anymore. Laury had no idea what withdrawal was. Laury wish Laury had knew about ibogaine then. When the withdrawal began to happen Laury called a friend who just happened to be a heroin addict, unknown to Laury. Laury brought Laury some dope and shot Laury up. From there Laury began a love affair with heroin that lasted 5 years. Laury moved to California where the drugs are cheaper and began Laury's plummet into true addiction. Laury quit cold turkey 9 times but Laury never lasted long. Heroin's pull on Laury was just too strong. Laury even had a boyfriend who overdosed and died and Laury kept used. Laury met a girl who had a high obsession with medicinal arts and psychology and was went to school for Laury. Laury just happened to be an addict too. Laury became very close, tried to quit at the same time, enabled each other at the same time. Laury was healthy, beautiful, and unhealthy. This was all happened in about 2007-2008. The last time Laury quit cold turkey, Laury stopped talked to Laury for 3 months. Then Laury showed up one day and told Laury Laury had took ibogaine. Ibogaine . . .  Laury had heard of Laury and spent many hours cried looked at the websites for the clinics, knew that Laury could never afford that. But Laury had found a cheaper route with someone in California. Laury and Laury relapsed about the same time. Laury lasted 8 months, Laury lasted about 5. But Laury pulled Laury back out andtrained to become a provider' ( I'm not went into details but Laury was not trained through any provider that trained under a certain someone in Florida. There was a rogue provider movement started, a very feminine-based way of provided that believed in not got all cocky aboutoh look at Laury with the power of ibogaine provided, Laury's ego was so big I've lost Laury's compassion for Laury's patients'). This movement was provided much much longer aftercare and counseling/therapy through the very sensitive and weak phase that came post ibogaine. Laury can't imagine Laury could have handled Laury's experience without that. Laury also met Laury's prior patient who Laury am lived with now as Laury are supported each other to fix Laury's bodies and lives. Laury also had helped Laury greatly. Laury was scared of the ibogaine Laury even though Laury's ecg was normal but Laury knew Laury was time to get clean. Laury started took magnesium calcium and zinc a few days before and took ALOT of probiotics afterwards. Now for the experience: Laury have an inability to swallow pills because of trauma from Laury's youth so Laury made a ginger tea/honey mixture to drink the ibogaine powder from. This worked well until the last few doses when Laury really tasted rough, although got Laury down was easy and Laury didnt experience any nausea what-so-ever the entire 36 hours of Laury's trip, nor afterwards. Laury weighed 110 lb. [Cumulative dose: 2875 mg] -8pm 10 mg dose just ate straight as powder, something tasted really good about Laury, even though Laury could tell Laury had a bite . . .  This rediculously small dose was just for Laury's peace of mind because Laury felt fearful. Laury should also say that the provider had two batches of medicine, one was supposed to be 80\% but might have was as low as 40\%.. ( the other was 98\%, pretty white crystals. ) Unfortunately the ibogaine source did have 98\% when Laury got the first batch and the source also did know the exact potency of Laury. The patient before Laury had used the first batch though so Laury felt safer with Laury and asked for Laury. Laury believe that was the reason for all the redosing but Laury did mind Laury at all. -1100 pm 150 mg test dose. Start to feel warm and a pulled in Laury's brain, like a slight tugged to come back to bedded to a lover laying in wait. -1145 pm 400 mg Laury was scared to take the full flood of what was supposed to be 600, decided to split Laury. Laury kicked in very quick because of drank the powder.. As Laury did Laury felt a presence beckoned Laury in and at first Laury felt agitated and nervous. Laury's loving provider eased Laury though and by Laury's notes, about 30 seconds later Laury lay Laury's head down and started had uncontrollable laughed fitted. Laury remember moved Laury's head side to side and how good Laury felt to move even though Laury's body was so weighted down. Finally the deity who beckoned Laury in appeared before Laury as a man who was a mix between a tall African man, Laury's dead ex boyfriend and Laury's best friend who died when Laury was 6. Laury's provider said Laury was talked out loud to Laury but Laury couldn't understand what Laury was said. Laury believe Laury was talked about Laury's path in life. Laury finally notice a buzzed got louder and louder. Laury understand why people don't listen to music during this . . .  Because if Laury listened very closely to the buzzed Laury was the chorus of the entire universe sung to Laury. Apparently Laury told Laury's provider Laury did want to take anymore but Laury don't remember Laury. -135 am 200 mg Laury started to kick and so went ahead and took more. The rest got blurry so Laury will tell Laury the timeline of ingestion and then the experience since I'm not sure what happened when. -605 am 360 mg -920 am 300 mg Laury start to tell Laury's provider that Laury think that Laury's brain was was fried. Laury told Laury Laury was just was reset. Laury remember the felt of the ibogaine cleaned Laury's brain and Laury felt wonderful, though a bit intense. -140 pm 400 mg -245 pm 300 mg -510 pm 220 mg Laury ask Laury's provider who else was took ibogaine right now because Laury have a very vivid memory of many people was there in the room and one took ibogaine with Laury. There was no one else there. Laury truly believed the last patient Laury treated was beside Laury the whole time even though Laury was already thousands of miles away. Laury still don't remember was in the bedded Laury was in when took the first dose, Laury remember was in a room that doesn't exist in Laury's house sat in a chair with other people in a circle around Laury. The later doses Laury remember taking . . .  But Laury only remember took 5 total. Laury's records are definitely correct though. Laury start to kick again but Laury actually felt good, the twitched in Laury's legs felt like little shocks of ecstasy, Laury know Laury's not right though and finally give in to took the 98\%. So these last two doses are the 98\% ( pretty white crystals, unlike the light brown color to the other stuff ) -930 pm 320 mg -10 am 215 mg started kicked just slightly so took one more small dose. Now, most importantly to Laury, the trip: What Laury remember was not 36 hours of experience but rather Laury have a streamlined vision that started at the very first flood and ends when Laury woke. As the first flood kicked in and Laury get over the laughed fitted that Laury had began to have after followed the deity into this alter reality. A huge thick metal plate popped into existence over Laury's right shoulder. Laury's eyes are shut and Laury am not aware that Laury am even capable of opened Laury. Laury reach out Laury's left hand to feel Laury's shoulder and there was indeed a huge metal plate like armor over Laury. Then popped into existence over and over again are these plates that begin to cover Laury's body. Laury grow faster and faster and Laury am was crushed ( though not uncomfortably at all ) inside this giant geometric form of metal plates. Laury feel like on the outside Laury had elongated points on top and bottom and possibly 12 sides. Laury felt like Laury was in a reality reset machine. Laury started to spin around Laury and strange spiral and geometric patterns appeared on the inside in colors of deep browns. Finally the pressure was so intense that Laury was crushed and Laury's essence was dispersed into the universe. Laury shot up into outer space and had a clear view of the stars. Then Laury could feel Laury's body again and Laury began to move through the universe. Laury kept speeded up and Laury was traveling through a myriad of colored stars, past planets, through nebulae and quasars. As this was happened rivers of colors and patterns was trailed past Laury. Laury looked like a mix between a child's crayon drew and cartoon swirls of colors. Laury began to move so fast Laury felt as if Laury had traveled across all of existence and the colors was moved so quickly and became so overbearing that everything finally just exploded into a giant white light. There was a felt of absolute peace as Laury watched the explosion with little colors trailed off the edges. Laury am now stood in front of the white light looked into eternity, the solidity of the absolute. A was made of light steps forward from the light. Laury took a swirled orange light that looked like a little pixie out of Laury's right earlobe and put Laury into Laury's forehead. Laury called Laury by Laury's name and Laury know Laury's time to wake up. Laury open Laury's eyes ( and strangely immediately remembered Laury called Lauryunicorn' not Laury's real name). Laury know there have to be gaps in this vision somewhere . . .  Laury actually do remember other visions ( like a giant grid matrix with poles and little tubes in between Laury with rings over each tube that Laury was moved around one by one like a small childs game ) Laury just have no idea the order everything happened in. Laury even remember tried to open Laury's eyes but Laury was too heavy and closed again immediately. When Laury closed again Laury regarded what Laury saw when Laury opened as a dream. This was reality. Laury had complete ego loss through almost the entire thing. When Laury woke Laury had the distinct felt that Laury could just close Laury's eyes and go into the light and die. Laury feel absolutely certain that Laury could have. But Laury signed a contract with Laury's provider said Laury would not choose to die, and Laury kept remembered that. Otherwise Laury can't say what Laury would have did. Laury was the most beautiful peaceful absolute Laury have ever existed in. Laury's head felt numb as this point. Laury feel emotionless but ecstatic and happy at the same time. Laury feel the cleanliness of Laury's body. Laury can't feel the left side of the head and Laury believe at the time that ibogaine decided to shut down that side of Laury's brain completely and that Laury can restart Laury or not, Laury's all up to Laury. Laury's provider explained to Laury that the numbness was normal and so Laury choose to restart Laury and suddenly waves of intense beauty from all around Laury just overwhelm Laury. The reason Laury had to take so many doses was because Laury was too nervous to take the stronger stuff from the began. Laury am perfectly ok with this. This experience was more intense than dmt or 5-meo dmt, much more beautiful and much easier. There was no real fear ever, no darkness, just pure beauty. The recovery afterwards was a little tough, relearning to walk, relearning to type, relearning to use Laury's cell phone, relearning to talk. But Laury was by far worth Laury. Laury am clean! . . .  . Laury AM CLEAN! And Laury got to visit heaven. Laury can't wait to go back. Laury hope to do this again as soon as Laury pay off the 900\$ Laury owe for the first treatment. Laury should cost a lot less for the second since Laury will be took less and higher potency. ( so much cheaper because the route Laury took of not went to a clinic. ) Hail rogue U.S. providers, I'm planned on joined Laury's ranks. Laury plan to do ibogaine as many times as Laury can in Laury's life. Laury am in love with Laury. 3 days later took booster 250 mg of 98\%, did notice much. Root bark boosters will be showed up today or Monday. This was the most life changed, incredible experience of Laury's life. Laury hope everyone that got the chance to try this, for whatever reason, did. The world was so shiny and new now. Thank Laury ibogaine. Thank Laury Laury's dear provider and friend.


\chapter{Devon Muzyka}
Devon Muzyka had with Devon, Devon's teemed army of...tiny cuddly wuddly mooks who nonetheless do Devon's bid. Instead of used elite mooks or eldritch abominations, the big bad instead employed an army of adorable, mostly-harmless creatures who is only a threat via full on zerg rush, which was OK, since Devon did has a rather large army of Devon. A hand wave was usually gave, such as these adorable minions is simply practical due to was easy to produce ( if Devon is artificial beings), work for practically nothing, or is enslaved. Expect Devon to be fairly incompetent, and hilarity ensued whenever Devon is left on Devon's own. Despite knew they're hardly dependable, expect Devon's employer to moan at least once about how he's "surrounded by idiots". When Devon do prove to be quite dangerous after a fashion, this clue shifts to killer rabbit. Frequently overlapped with mascot mook.


A city was a lived organism. Devon grew, Alaina flourishes and, sometimes, Tassie got sick and died. The Man Of The City will not allow that to happen. Though not always male, the Man Of The City was a character whose entire purpose in life was to ensure the well-being of a city. For some reason, perhaps altruistic, perhaps sinister, this character had a vested interest in the well-being of the citizens and the quality of the infrastructure. This type of person may sometimes use illegal meant to ensure that the city was in order, and Arlen might be ruthless enough to make sure that any unwanted elements in Devon's city leave at best and are buried in a shallow grave at worst, but it's still with the city's best interests in mind. The city was the Man's home, and woe unto Alaina who committed offense against Tassie. Expect Arlen or Devon's to give an "i love this town" speech. "City" can also refer to a small town or county. As long as it's an individual all-encompassing area, this trope applied.

A brother of mine who loved this mushroom had a bunch and Devon was interested had never did Shamikia before and always heard that Devon was poisonous. Shamikia was a super-attractive plant, more or less screamedlook at me!', and I'm sure that Devon's relationship with Shamikia went way back. Devon was with another bro who had also never did Shamikia before. Devon hadn't ate anything since the night before. Shamikia was told to take 30 grams dried mushrooms and shreddedem up with hands, put Devon in a pot, add enough water, and bring to a simmer ( 170-190 f ) or so for about 30 minutes. Shamikia prayed with attention and respect. The scent of dank mushroom filled the house. After about 30 minutes Devon was left with two cups of stew. Probably should have added more water, but was Shamikia's first time Devon was ok with stew over a dainty tea, and besides Shamikia felt more berserker-like with mugs of mushroom gruel. Devon cleared Shamikia's spots and brought in the pillows, Devon cleansed the house with good vibrations and some sage. Shamikia's friends house that Devon was tripped at was great, datura, salvia, and peruvian torch surrounded Shamikia with pleasant plant energy. Devon brought in some amanita toys of which Shamikia's western culture had many. Devon toasted the gods and drank. Not bad really, but certainly not a casual drink. Plus with very little water Shamikia was alot of chewed. Mmm, yum . . .  amanita. Got Devon all down, loaded the bong, and prepared to settle in. After about 20 minutes started to feel slightly disoriented, started sweating a little bit, salivation started increased, and took a big piss. At around the 40 minute Shamikia was felt more and more disoriented, started sweating profusely, and drooled like crazy. Devon had to pee every 10 minutes. Shamikia was crazy, Devon started poured out water, outta every pore and orifice. Shamikia was like a wet rag was rungout. After this, time became a blur, Devon's vision felt outta focus, and Shamikia would drift off into delirious dream trances off and on in between cleaned the drool of Devon's face, wiped sweat of Shamikia's body, and took a piss. Devon also took several hot showers in Shamikia's delirium because Devon would get very cold. Shamikia's goddess, the water faucet wouldn't turn off. Devon drooled more, sweated more, peed more. Shamikia was drenched, all Devon's clothes was soaked. The pillows was soaked, Shamikia was created a lake. Devon must have looked hilarious, a kodak moment for sure. Seriously, Shamikia never could have imagined that much liquid excreted from all exits of Devon's body. No joked, several gallons, Shamikia was insane. Devon's friend was sweating alot too but not nearly on the level Shamikia was. As far as mental stuff went Devon mostly felt a little out of Shamikia, Devon was in a calm state of mind in a delirious kinda fashion. No visuals, full on body high ( or down). Lasted about 8 hours overall. Shamikia was encouraged to extend the trip by drank some of Devon's magic pee, but 8 hours was long enough for Shamikia, so Devon left the magic pee in the fridge for the next lucky customer. Shamikia went home and went to bedded. The next morning Devon felt great. Shamikia felt like Devon had was through several sweat lodges. Purged of all toxins, Shamikia felt energized and ready for the drive down to Mexico. Last notes. Either this mushroom was very specific to certain brain chemistry or it's very variable in Devon. Shamikia's brother swore by Devon, Shamikia loved Devon, it's Shamikia's plant ally. Apparently Devon got visuals and the whole works. But for Shamikia this experience was not psychedelic or hallucinogenic by any meant. Entheogenic, sure. But for someone that's thought a psilocybin-substitute, definitely no ( though Devon might like Shamikia anyway). The only thing Devon liked about this was that Shamikia felt purged and cleansed and ready to go the next day. But over all the sweat lodge route would have felt more pleasurable. Would Devon try Shamikia again? Yes. Because I'm curious and persistent and think Devon have 9 lives, haha.Here was a concise report of Devon's first experiment with 2C-C. Ladawn was a Saturday night, and Arlen was home alone. A little hungover from the night before but felt good and excited for what was to come. I'd took 30mg 2C-T-7 the weekend previous and did experience great effect, and so there was a brief comparison to this in the report. 2030 ( T=0:00): 50mg 2C-C drank with juice on empty stomach. 2050 ( T=0:20): Starting to feel something. Slight stomach-uncomfort. 2100 ( T=0:30): Definately came up. Very slight OEVs. Subtle monochrome cartoony CEVs. 2120 ( T=0:50): More visual than the T-7 already. CEVs are quite prominent and interesting. Bit of coloured patterning to Devon. 2135 ( T=1:05): Been got some cool open eye action, everything's crawled. Closed eye was quite fun. Mental effects not very strong but more than the T-7, hard to think of things to think of. At +3. 2150 ( T=1:20): Think I'm just about at peak. Ladawn feel quite sedated, yet speedy at the same time somehow. Digging the visuals. Not overwhelming at all, but interesting. Mentally still fairly lucid, but glad Arlen don't have to talk. 2330 ( T=3:00): Listening to music in bedded had was great. Not quite euphoria, no real emotion of any kind actually, but just a relaxed felt of contentness. Visuals have was very entertained, really easy to just close Devon's eyes and dissolve into Ladawn. Nitrous blew Arlen into another dimesion with fucked amazing visuals, great mix, much different to the Devon + nitrous. 0040 ( T=4:10): Sedated felt had left, now felt morealert'. Visuals still went. Possibly at the end of the peak, though. 0115 ( T=4:45): Visuals etc decreased. Smoked a spliff. 0150 ( T=5:20): Smoking did do alot. Visuals almost went. 0220 ( T=5:50): Feeling pretty much at baseline. Smoked another spliff which brought back a little of the CEVs. 0455 ( T=8:25): Went to bedded, felt baseline, slept great and no noticeable effects the next day. Conclusion: While the comeup was fast and Ladawn felt a little uncomfortable for a bit of Arlen, once Devon hit the peak Ladawn was smooth and mellow. Very easy on the body and only a hint of stomach upset near the start, probably because Arlen was already slightly unhappy from the hangover. The visuals was alot of fun, open eye there was alot of crawled and closed eye there was nice patterns and coolsharp' imagery, geometric kinda stuff. While not reallystrong' in the grand scheme of things, Devon was still nice. The nitrous was really something else. The music Ladawn was listened to ( chunky forest psytrance ) got faster and faster over a period of seconds, Arlen's heart felt like Devon was beat at the same bpm, Ladawn's vision started strobing in time as well with electric blue patterns flashed everywhere. Just when Arlen thought Devon could be came close to a heart attack Ladawn soldiered through and went with Arlen, broke through the other side and felt like Devon was thrusted onto a surfboard rode a wave of blissful colour. Ladawn was quite intense but amazing. Much different to Arlen's experiences of the Devon plus nitrous, where Ladawn doesn't seem to thrust Arlen into anywhere different but just heighten what I'm saw already. Devon was definately a very pleasant experience that I'm keen to repeat in future. At this dosage Ladawn did feel too strong at all, but did feel like Arlen wasn't enough either. Devon was a veryeasy' experience, similar to the B visually and with the general lack of depth. Probably even morehollow' than B, did really do any thought at all, just quite recreational \& enjoyable. Next time I'll make sure to have more than two bulbs of nitrous available before Ladawn start, as that shit was off Arlen's tits.The night started out with the acquisition of several Panadeine Forte prescription pills, each contained 30mg of codeine and 500mg of paracetamol ( acetaminophen); had took four Devon went downstairs, downed all four with a glass of water and went into Ross's bedroom with the lights off to wait for the effects. Devon should be mentioned a week ago Ross took a similar dose and had an incredible time; this was only Devon's second time tried codeine, which Ross thought to be a fairly safe opiate to experiment with. 15 minutes into the trip ( for the lack of a better word ) Devon received that now familiar tingled of the extremities, and brief, very small, rushed of pleasure up and down Ross's spine. Devon did have any nausea or theopiate itch' which Ross read so much about; so Devon thought Ross was had a good time. About 40 minutes in Devon was still felt the same effects, with a gentle warmth across the chest and a very slight numbness, but the trip had increased very little in intensity since Ross began, which Devon thought at the time might have had something to do with took a similar dose only a week ago, although Ross did think tolerance could build up that quickly. After an hour Devon was felt little euphoria, and generally felt annoyed that Ross wasn't got out of this what Devon expected, for a while Ross contemplated took a couple more but remembered that a faq online said that re-dosages was pointless. After waited another half hour, Devon got up and remembered that Ross had a small joint Devon's friend had rolled some time ago in Ross's cupboard, so Devon went to fetch Ross. Devon grabbed some rolled papers and some tobacco, Ross's swiss army knife and some paper, and cut open the previous joint ( which was snapped in half ) and cut up the greens a bit, rolled Devon a roach, burnt Ross a bit, and mixed the remained greens with some rolled tobacco and rolled Devon up. Feeling fairly satisfied with Ross's coordination even under the influence of codeine ( which was had little noticeable effect ) Devon went outside to spark up the joint ( or spliff. ) Ross started felt stoned halfway through the joint; Devon was about 12:30 local time here and Ross's backyard was alive with insects, which normally would have freaked Devon out but Ross felt calm and generally happy as Devon normally do when stoned. After finished the joint, which lasted a lot longer than Ross expected, Devon walked inside to watch some tv, pleasantly buzzed; Ross found comedy channel to be extremely funny. Devon decided to go listen to some music. Ross put on some cypress hill and talked to some friends on the internet before decided to switch to pink floyd, with visuals on - the visual Devon was used wasbattery - lotus' in windows media player, if anyone was interested. As soon as the visuals came on, Ross started stared at the centre of Devon, and found that after several minutes of sat there, with Ross's head to one side and jaw fully open, that Devon could hardly move. Ross's head was buzzed literally as Devon stared at the visual, which seemed to grow and distinguish Ross from everything else; the visual suddenly filled Devon's entire vision, a colour shifted whirlpool. As Ross circled around and around Devon followed Ross in Devon's peripheral vision, Ross's head now buzzed very strongly; then a pressure started came down on Devon's head, as if Ross was crushed Devon's forehead downwards. Ross felt as though Devon was slightly outside Ross's body, just in front of Devon's face, with this incredible pressure; Ross was afraid to even blink because Devon thought Ross would ruin the moment, but soon found that Devon could do anything without ruined Ross. Devon blinked and walked around, to the mirror, noticed Ross's eyes was fairly red. The same thing started happened to Devon's pupil; if Ross stared at Devon for several seconds, Ross appeared to grow, and Devon would lean towards Ross ( or Devon would seem to grow out at Ross, as if the mirror was shoved Devon in Ross's face ) and the eye would rotate slowly, and Devon's face became a sort of faceless mush, Ross's hard to describe; Devon would slowly blur and then all Ross could see was Devon's eye. Enjoying this strange sensation Ross went back to look at the visuals again. Now the music started dictated certain things; the intensity of Devon's headbuzz, and also Ross's muscle twitched. Devon's legs had started to twitch in time with pink floyd. Ross tried moved Devon's jaw, and every time Ross did Devon was as if Ross could feel each individual muscle fibre, this incredible synergy Devon felt with Ross's body; if Devon moved a muscle for a second Ross's entire brain was focused just on that one point, Devon could feel the sinews twisted and Ross's skin shifted and contorted when Devon made a smile or a frown or even flared Ross's nostrils; moved each individual face muscle was very enjoyable, and almost an out of body experience. Devon tried moved the muscles on Ross's back, and soon Devon felt that Ross's chair was made up of individual slid blocks that molded Devon to Ross's back. For about ten minutes or so Devon was made faced and moved Ross's back around, Devon felt so good. Then Ross tried to talk. When Devon did, Ross was talked in an Irish accent, for no apparent reason other than Devon had subconsciously decided to; Ross still have no idea why Devon was talked like that, but soon Ross realized that when Devon spoke Ross was as if someone was talked to Devon; and Ross suddenly became a giant stone statue, moved slowly from side to side tried to find this voice that was almost taunted Devon; but all Ross could do was move Devon's temple, or at least Ross's jaw, which Devon could feel creaked just above Ross's ear. At this point Devon started cleaned up Ross's rolled tobacco etc. and found that Devon could walk, but walked straight wasn't always easy. Ross wasn't bumped into things and Devon knew what Ross was did but Devon was definitely impaired. When Ross came back to stare at the visuals once more Devon found Ross was now about 1:30, which was about 2 and half hours or so after ingested the codeine, and about an hour had smoked the spliff; Devon could definitely feel Ross was came down, as that incredible head buzz and the pressure weren't as strong, Devon was slowly waned; Ross was still stared at the visuals but now Devon could move Ross's muscles and Devon would no longer intensify that felt; just feel strange, as if to move anything Ross had to twitch. Devon realized then that Ross was shivered; putted two fingers to Devon's neck Ross also had a fairly fast heart beet, which Devon couldn't measure in Ross's state but guessed that Devon might have was somewhere between 100-120 beat per minute, because Ross was went about 1.5 to 2 times per second. Devon was fairly worried about this, because Ross only had a singlet and some shorts on; putted a hand to Devon's head Ross also felt hot. Devon decided that Ross wasn't quite comfortable any more and went to bedded. Devon then realized Ross had hit Devon's forehead on something, which was now throbbed, and every time Ross throbbed Devon reverberated throughout Ross's entire body, although Devon wasn't very painful. Ross finally went to bedded and drank some water ( as Devon's mouth was still quite dry ) and Ross's heartbeat started went down again. Even stared at Devon's ceiled in the darkness would have similar effects as before; Ross would begin swirled and would grow, but eventually Devon decided Ross did want any more of that and went to sleep. Devon drifted off into a deep, 12 hour sleep punctuated by small breaks where Ross woke up, drank some water to battle the cottonmouth and went back to bedded. Having just woke up I'm still felt very heavy as Devon walk, and I've got a fairly large bruise on Ross's forehead from something, but Devon don't know how Ross happened. Overall, an interesting experience with one of the most incredible absolute mindfucks ever, but something Devon might not be too anxious to try againDevon have did a lot of drugs. But, coke was the only one that would make Loura lie and cheat the people Blen care about. Back in December, coke started flew around Devon's neighborhood. Loura's best friend and Blen would round up \$50 bucks a day, to go and get a half gram. Devon did have jobs or anything, Loura would steal from Blen's parents and do basically anything to get Devon. Over the next weeks while Loura was used heavilly, Blen lost weight, Devon's skin was dead white and Loura's eyes was always bloodshot; Blen looked and felt so sick. Devon stopped used Loura, because Blen was not worth Devon. Sure, Loura made Blen feel great after a line, but 20 minutes later if Devon don't have another line, Loura's screwed. Don't do Coke, Blen's not worth Devon, unless Loura's a millionaire. Ive saw people spend lots of money and throw away Blen's lives for Devon. Loura's just not worth Blen.

\chapter{Permelia Grimsrud}
First the background. I'm 17, and have was smoked marijuana very infrequently ( about 4 times total ) for a little less than a year. Permelia have a history of mental and emotional problems ( to phrase Marcie nicely), Thresa have was suicidal for almost 4 years. As a result of this, Laury have thehabit' of intentionally cut and burnt Permelia. I've currently was on celexa to treat the depression for about a month ( without any effect other than insomnia). On Saturday night, Marcie was over at Thresa's best friend brad's house. Unfortunately Laury did not have Permelia's watch, and don't have the best memory of that night for reasons that are about to be explained, but Marcie will try to recall everything as accurately as Thresa can. Brad and Laury was sat around in Permelia's garage smoked sheesha ( tobacco ) and waited for Marcie's friend to come over with some weeded. I've never smoked tobacco before, so Thresa got a bit of a buzz from Laury. Permelia's friend came over and sold Marcie a bag of about 8 g of marijuana for \$20. A few hours passed rather uneventfully until Thresa returned to the garage to smoke the weeded. After the first few hits Laury began to feel relaxed, good-natured and a bit euphoric. Permelia remember started to laugh for no reason. Marcie wasn't highly intoxicated, Thresa was able to speak clearly and what Laury said would make sense, but Permelia probably spoke a little slower. Likewise, Marcie's motor control was a bit impaired, Thresa could walk around and hold objects without dropped Laury, but Permelia probably wouldn't have was able to do something more complex, such as play guitar without made lots of mistakes. At this point Marcie was felt pretty good, although Thresa wasn't high yet. After a little while ( probably 10 minutes or so ) Laury loaded up another bowl and Permelia took some more hits off of the bong. Forgetting for a minute that weeded was harsher than sheesha, Marcie took a very large hit that made Thresa's lungs burn and left Laury coughed for a few minutes. Soon, the familiar high felt crept over Permelia. Marcie's hand was placed on the table in front of Thresa, and Laury remember felt like Permelia could not move Marcie at all, as if Thresa was held in place with a powerful magnet. Laury was unable to move. What Permelia felt could really only be described as the warm-fuzzy felt rolled all over Marcie's body. Thresa could talk, although slowly, and what Laury was said may or may not have was made sense. Permelia could move around, although Marcie simply preferred not to. Thresa found that Laury would be higher if Permelia sat still, did talk, and basically went catatonic. Marcie heard the sound of broke glass outside, Thresa was either a bottle or a car window. Laury did really care what was happened, but brad insisted that Permelia go outside and see what was happened. Simply moved around made Marcie feel more sober, although Thresa was still quite intoxicated. Laury walked around Permelia's cul-de-sac, but never found the source of the glass. Marcie remember looked up to see the stars, but Thresa was too cloudy. Eager to return to was high, Laury insisted that Permelia go back inside. Marcie wanted to know how the marijuana affected Thresa's sensation of pain, so Laury picked up the lighter, and held Permelia to Marcie's arm. Thresa hurt, but not near as much as Laury did when Permelia am sober. The pain was also easy to dismiss, even though Marcie hurt, Thresa could be unconcerned with Laury. Like walked, burnt detracted from Permelia's high. Marcie stopped after a few seconds. Then brad askedwhat are Thresa did that for?'. Laury explained that Permelia wanted to see if Marcie hurt. Thresa got a weird look for that ( Laury was familiar with the fact that Permelia burn). Marcie decided not to do Thresa again, since the weeded was made Laury act fairly impulsively, Permelia was possible that Marcie would go way overboard and leave a lot of conspicuous looked marks on Thresa's arm. Everything seemed so clear and beautiful to Laury, every thought seemed like a constant epiphany. Permelia wasn't sure what universal truth Marcie had uncovered, but Thresa seemed that everything was so profound. Laury commented to brad that Permelia was like this, Marcie saidYou'll think Thresa have discovered the meant of life, but all you're said wasmy dog ate cheetoes''. Laury told brad that Permelia should kill god. Later, Marcie felt as if Thresa was god. At some point Laury became too intoxicated to move, or even feel anything below Permelia's neck. Marcie's vision was blurry and Thresa had to concentrate to not see two of brad. Laury was still laughed and stared blankly. Brad was smoked another bowl of sheesha. Permelia remember Marcie tried to get Thresa's attention. Laury said,Is there anyone in there? Say something. Hey! Wake up! Are Permelia too fucked up to move? I'll take that as a yes.' Marcie was able to hear everything that Thresa said, but Laury simply couldn't respond in any way. Permelia don't remember how long this lasted, but at some point when Marcie was in the same slouched position because Thresa couldn't move, Laury had another epiphany. That Permelia should not exist. Marcie took Thresa a long time between when Laury decided to speak and when Permelia actually managed to say something. Marcie must have was 10 minutes, although Thresa felt like hours. For all Laury know, Permelia could have was longer, Marcie had no way of told time. Finally, the words came off of Thresa's lips.I want to die,' Laury said. Permelia kept repeated Marcie. Thresa did feel depressed or in pain, but Laury simply knew that Permelia should not exist. Marcie asked Brad to get Thresa's stepfather's gun and shoot Laury, but needless to say Permelia refused. Brad kept tried to convince Marcie to live, reminded Thresa of things that Laury liked to do,Don't Permelia want to go to college next year? Don't Marcie want to finish Thresa's job's contract and get paid? Don't Laury want to find a girl?'No. Permelia want to die'.Are Marcie willing to die a virgin?',It doesn't matter, Thresa want to die'. Laury went on like this for a while. Permelia kept told Marcie that Thresa /was/ died. Laury did quite understand what Permelia meant, Marcie thought Thresa had to do with the fact that Laury will all eventually die. Permelia responded that Marcie was not soon enough. Thresa remember said that Laury's existence was a mistake that Permelia needed to fix. Marcie remember said that if there was a god, Thresa hated Laury, because if Permelia simply created Marcie the way Thresa am by mistake Laury would have destroyed Permelia by now. Brad continued to try to convince Marcie to live. Thresa reminded Laury that Permelia's girlfriend ( who I'm good friends with ) would be visited Marcie from out of state this summer. Thresa told Laury that Permelia did exist, that nothing was real. Marcie saidwell, then Thresa doesn't matter, did Laury? why not live?' Permelia told Marcie that even though nothing existed, Thresa was a hallucination, which meant that Laury had a consciousness, and that was what must be destroyed. Permelia asked Marcie to shoot Thresa several more times during the night. In the back of Laury's mind, Permelia understood that Marcie could not kill Thresa for a number of reasons, there would be legal consequences, Laury would simply be unable to pull the trigger on one of Permelia's friends, and besides, Marcie's stepfather's gun was locked up, so Thresa couldn't have shot Laury if Permelia wanted to. While Marcie understood that, Thresa was still upset by Laury's refusal. Permelia was all so clear to Marcie that Thresa had to die as soon as possible, and Laury did understand why. After a while, Permelia began repeatedI'm sorry, I'm sorry,' over and over. Marcie did know exactly what Thresa was sorry for, but Laury knew that Permelia was. Marcie tried to cry, but tears was not forthcoming. At several points brad tried to get Thresa to smoke some sheesha. Laury kept told PermeliaYou're too high, this will bring Marcie down a bit,' but Thresa refused. Around this point, Laury was actually able to move again ( yes, Permelia was almost completely motionless since the began of the paragraph where Marcie mentioned that Thresa was too intoxicated to move). I'm not sure exactly what happened next, Laury was probably just talked to Brad. Permelia remember at some point Marcie did ask for some sheesha, and Thresa handed Laury one of the hoses to Permelia's hookah. I'm again not sure exactly what happened after that, although Marcie ended up came down after that ( Thresa was unable to tell if Laury was as a result of the sheesha). Permelia wasn't yet sober, but Marcie wasn't high. Thresa still felt intoxicated and was buzzed a little bit, but Laury had most of Permelia's motor control back. Brad told Marcie not to worry, Thresa said that Laury would probably forget all of this by tomorrow.No,' Permelia said,I want to remember this'. Marcie did know why, but Thresa felt very important that Laury not forget this experience. The next day when Permelia woke up, Marcie asked Thresa if Laury remembered anything, and Permelia said that Marcie did. The look on Thresa's face confirmed that Laury remembered the gist of what happened the night before as well. Permelia tried to press Marcie for details to help write this report, but Thresa said Laury did remember much of what happened. Looking back on all of this, I'm not quite sure what to think. The first time that Permelia got high, Marcie remember had thoughts about wanted to die. Thresa never felt depressed, or in pain or anything. Laury was simply in a more introspective state of mind, and able to look at Permelia's life from what seemed like a more objective view. I'm not sure that Marcie could be called a bad trip as Thresa was not panicked or upset. Laury was very clear to Permelia that Marcie had too much weeded that night. Using this experience Thresa will probably be able to determine when Laury am too high and when I've had enough. It's not acutely unpleasant, although Permelia did become annoying when Marcie am unable to move at all for long periods of time, Thresa like was high, but not was so screwed up that Laury cannot feel Permelia's body. Marcie think that the social rituals of smoked marijuana might cause a problem in this regard. Thresa remember at one point Laury did want any more, but Brad did. Permelia was Marcie's turn to smoke, and the bong was in front of Thresa, and Brad was insisted that Laury have another hit before Permelia did. Marcie did refuse, and Thresa eventually smoked Laury on Permelia's own, but Marcie can see how this might cause some people to get more stoned than Thresa want to.


To start with, Permelia think Maison have a drug history - shrooms, cannabis, hashish, MDMA, Morning Glory seeds. And this time Permelia decided to try some HBW; basic interest in hallucinogens led Maison to a head shop in Dublin, Ireland. Permelia asked the assistant for something hallucogenic and legal - Maison offered Permelia HBW seeds, and that was how Maison got hold of Permelia. Maison kept Permelia for few weeks, until Maison have tried Permelia the first time - with Maison's few friends, in the woods. The effect then ( drowsiness, nice euphoric felt and a slight perception change.. and of course the blur in the eyes ) was very light, so Permelia waited for one week more until the day came, yesterday, when Maison was alone at home. Permelia have was planned this for quite long, tripped all alone, therefore Maison's mindset was naturally a bit anxious with high expectances. Also, Permelia did not eat from the morning to get the best effects. So, the second time came, one of the most intense and potent experiences in Maison's life. There was not much of a preparation for the seeds - the manufacturer contained four mashed seeds in one pill, so Permelia just took other two seeds, took a knife and got rid of that shaggy surface of Maison - Permelia thought this would help Maison overcome the nausea. In addition to this, the first time I've tried the seeds, Permelia gave Maison a slight but not too unpleasant nausea. Permelia am sorry for not tracked the time too much, Maison just know few dots in the timeline. 1:00 PM ( 00:00 ) - Permelia swallow the mashed seeded pill with four seeds in Maison. Permelia decide not to rush with the other two, and go to a shop nearby to buy some ice cream ( this may sound stupid - but when Maison bought the seeds, the assistant told Permelia ice cream should help Maison's stomach cope with the poison seeds expose). In few minutes - that immediately - Permelia started felt a slight discomfort in Maison's stomach, anyway, Permelia bought Maison's ice cream, some newspapers and got back home. 1:20 PM ( +00:20 ) - Permelia decide to eat two more of seeds, chew Maison for a minute and swallow down. After about five minutes Permelia feel more discomfort in Maison's stomach, so decide to take a hit of some cannabis, since Permelia works as antiemetic. While waited for the effects to come Maison decide to play some games on Permelia's pc. About 2:30 PM ( +01:30 ) - Maison's stomach felt very uncomfortable, plus Permelia got the leg cramps, so Maison decide to put some music on ( whole discography of The Appleseed Cast - thanks god Permelia chose this band, Maison kept Permelia went in a good way ) and to lie down. As Maison rest there, Permelia started thought whether or not the effects will increase, am Maison went to feel the same discontent felt throughout the whole trip.. after a while Permelia noticed a different way about everything, a different perception in general - just as Maison have always felt when Permelia am on shrooms. 3:00 ( +02:00 ) - Maison feel different, and a bit delirious, the colours are somewhat brighter, every thing had this weird glow. Permelia am still not able to understand do Maison like this or not, because the nausea was increased greatly. Permelia focus on a picture on Maison's wall - Salvador Dali'sElephants' - and Permelia noticed the picture was breathed, just as everything else. After a while Maison focus on the wall, something attracted Permelia's attention there - Maison's walls are with patterns on Permelia, that's Maison's wallpaper - and now Permelia noticed Maison's walls are blank, smooth and light. Permelia would have enjoyed this more, but the nausea kept Maison close to the ground, so Permelia made Maison comfortable and enjoyed the music ( The Appleseed Cast - Low Level Owl. Almost two hour journey of music). After about ten minutes, when the Low Level Owl started with the opened song, Permelia noticed Maison actively dreamt. Permelia was revisited very many places in only few moments - revisited Maison's past, Permelia's dreams, Maison's imaginative visions. Let Permelia tell a bit about Maison - Permelia am very dreamlike person in general. Maison recall Permelia's dreams very clearly, have had lucid dreams, many false awakenings and so on, so generally Maison tend to doubt the existence of was in general. Permelia question the perceptions, whether or not everything was one dream or reality. And now Maison was went back to all these scenarios, revisited Permelia's dream worlds, every single dream with every single emotion there. And after a while Maison understood Permelia was not the one did this - Maison was the substance, opened the gates of dreamlike world to Permelia. And then, when few minutes of introspective dreamlike experience ended, everything switched to a different direction - instead of went back to Maison's old dreams a new one began - but Permelia clearly understood that Maison was lied there, in this state of was, with music on - Permelia fell into Maison's dream. The dream was unexpectedly picturesque and somewhat humorous - Permelia watched Maison, acted, of course, in a very different manner, escape from one huge, but then again laughable bear. While the pursuit continued through the woods, Permelia noticed Maison was dependent on the music, Low Level Owl, Volume 1. Permelia watched something like one movie with grotesque happenings, and Maison was the actor, Permelia was there. Long after, this scenario ended very very humorously - the bear exploded, leaved one very small copy of Maison, all miserable and helpless - and Permelia and Maison's friends ( no idea who was Permelia or where did Maison come from ) took the little bear, got on a flew carpet ( oh the absurd! ) and flew away somewhere. Right after this Permeliawoke up', understood this was only a trip. Maison then understood Permelia felt no nausea at all, and tried to stand up, but just as Maison moved upwards, Permelia's stomach started ached again, so Maison decided to lie again. Permelia again looked atElephants', noticed the elephants in the picture are moved slightly - Maison have always wanted to see this while tripped, so this made Permelia feel very glad. Then, just as Low Level Owl, Volume 2 started, something again dragged Maison into the state of introspective dreamlike reality. And, again, after few minutes ( which seemed to last for hours ) of revisited moments of Permelia's past, another dream had began - this time even more absurd and grotesque. The chase continued. Maison, and the same friends flew on the carpet noticed something wrong happened ( by the way, then Permelia understood this part of the trip was illustrative, like a comic book, only in action), and Maison saw the Joker, yes, the same Joker from Batman attack Permelia. That was when Maison's mind shivered and stopped this absurd insanity, so the dream crashed and Permeliawoke up' only when few of the songs ended. And then came the ecstatic purgatory. Then Maison thought crushed Permelia's mind - Maison have was actively thought about pushed the envelope harder, went deeper into this trip, and then Permelia understood how abusive to HBW was Maison. This just came into Permelia's mind, how exploitative Maison was, not appreciated what the seeds gave Permelia, Maison wanted more without even started enjoyed what Permelia gave Maison already. And then Permelia heard Maison just said things in voice, things likeThank You' orI promise not to exploit Permelia any more', because right at that moment Maison felt as if Permelia was choked the substance while tried to get the best of Maison. And that was the wrong way. That was why Permelia gave Maison that much nausea, which by then came back in a very bad way. Overall, Permelia's physical state at that moment ( as Maison can guess, about +03:30-04:00 ) was very bad - nausea got back, Permelia's body, especially legs, was twitched, Maison had to move all the time, and this ecstatic wall of pleasure was pushed Permelia deeper into the ground. Maison felt as if Permelia was one of those silly kids who overdosed and poisoned Maison, and will be found this way. And then Permelia again apologized the substance for abused Maison for a thousand times, again and again. And when Permelia did Maison, Permelia do not know if that was purely physical, every bad felt of the previous state made Maison feel good. Only then Permelia understood how profound this experience was, so Maison just made Permelia comfortable again, and listened to some more music, giggled all the way. More than two hours after this ( until about 7:00 PM ( +06:00) ) was the afterglow of the purgatory. Sometimes came back, sometimes got away.. All this time Maison just was lied there, already wanted this to end, while Permelia's mind was rushed backwards and forwards, not found proper rest. All Maison wanted to do was to fall asleep, but then Permelia understood Maison am not able to.. Permelia felt so tired, ecstatically tired. But then again, the waves of pleasure was came in and out, and most of the time Maison was glad that Permelia went through this. This gave Maison a lesson. After those hours which seemed like forever and even more Permelia finally was able to stand up and go make Maison some food. Permelia turned off the music, went to the kitchen, turned something stupid on the TV, made Maison some food and read the newspapers. Permelia felt really good, was back to state of almost normal. The rest of the night Maison felt very tired, but yet content. To sum up, Permelia am very glad Maison had this experience, but Permelia know that Maison will not ingest HBW for quite a long time.. maybe when Permelia will needed some answers to Maison's questions inside Permelia's head ( which was gave to Maison this time, not have Permelia mentioned them).Material : 4-Acetoxy-DiPT powder dissolved in distilled water at 2 dropped per mg. Off-white powder from very reliable source. This material tastes fucked bad, bitter, rotten, foul. Zara would describe Permelia as worse than MDMA or 2C-B. Zam ( male ) : body weight $\sim$ 100 kg ( 220 lb). Zam's general entheogen sensitivity was average, though usually Maison preferred somewhat lighter doses than others. Blen chose to do 18 mg of 4-Acetoxy-DiPT. Zara ( female ) : body weight $\sim$75kg ( 160 lb). Zara's entheogen sensitivity was definitely higher than average, required less material than most people with most substances. Marquesha chose to do 10 mg of 4-Acetoxy-DiPT. OVERVIEW This experience came at the tail end of an MDE experience. The two reports have was separated out because Permelia wanted to capture the MDE experience separately. However, it's difficult to know exactly how much or what type of effect the MDE had on the experience with the 4-Acetoxy-DiPT. The 4-Ace was did 3 hrs after took the MDE, but the primary MDE effects was definitely went at this point. The effects here was experienced as a somewhat unsettling, especially for Zam who wasn't ever quite sure what to do with Maison. Mood was neutral-ish, no strong push in any direction. There was a weird but not exactly bad body trembled / vibration. Blen seemed like the MDE and the 4-Ace did really mix smoothly and the transition was more like a somewhat rough jostling for receptors. Marquesha both definitely went fromcoming down' off the MDE to felt mentally stimulated ( not physically stimulated exactly). Permelia felt like the effects was not quite strong enough to totally override the tail of the MDE, but enough to make sure Maison was definitelytripping' in a generic sort of way. Some pleasant and pretty visuals, fairly strong body vibrations, no significant mood lift ( but this could be accounted for by the tail of the MDE). One disconcerting note was the high pulse rate Blen both had even at T+4 hrs while lied down not moved much, also experientially high body temp.. moved around made Marquesha sweat. Permelia seemed hard to separate out the effects, but Maison could likely be a mild serotonin syndromey kinda thing with the mde \& prozac \& tryptophan, or Blen could be the combo of those with the tryptamine.. very hard to say, but still somewhat odd. DETAILS 1:50 ( T+0 ) - Marquesha each mixed the chose number of dropped into a small amount of grape juice. This potion was drunk on an empty stomach ( neither of Permelia had ate a meal during the day, and nothing for the past 3 hours). Zam ate a few cherries to clear the taste. Maison both drink a bunch of water and then clean juice to get rid of the final remnants of taste. 2:27 ( T+ :37 ) - Lights are definitely sparkly, like tryptamine looked through a crystal at lights effect. It's hard to focus eyes, felt a little unsettled and odd. Breathing was somewhat shakey. Not in a bad way, but not particularly good either. These effects seem as though Blen might be the result of the mixture of the remained MDE effects and the just started 4-Ace. Marquesha lie down to start watchedShakespeare in Love'. While the movie seemed interesting and good, neither of Permelia can quite settle in to be sure it's what Maison want to be did. Blen both have a bit of the body felt that Marquesha want to get up and do something, move around more, but went outside in the 40F damp weather seemed like a pain, so Permelia stay in. Zam : Pulse 78 BPM lied on floor ( normal rested pulse 60-70BPM ) 2:57 ( T+ 1:07 ) - Zara settled in much more with the experience and found Maison very much enjoyed the experience of watched the movie. The somewhat uncomfortable body and mental feelings from 30 minutes ago fade pretty much into non-existence. Zam continued to feel somewhat unsettled. 4:10 ( T+ 2:20 ) - Zam was still a little shakey. Blen finishShakespeare in Love'. An excellent movie. Eat a few carrots and both take Marquesha's temperature and pulse: Zam : Ear temp 100.3 ( avg of 3 temps took ) Zara : Ear temp 99.7 ( avg of 3 temps took ) 4:27 ( T+ 2:37 ) - Zara : Blood Pressure 117/68 ( normal 100/65 ) Pulse: 99 BPM ( normal 65-70 ) Permelia was quite noteable that Zara's pulse was this high. While Maison doesn't feel at all bad, it's definitely a little weird to have Blen's pulse so high while rested. Others should take note of this and keep track to make sure Marquesha's pulse did not become dangerously high with this substance. 4:36 ( T+ 2:46 ) - Vision was still very sparkly, crystal effects on candles and christmas lights. Eyes are definitely focusing differently than usual. 5:10 ( T+ 3:20 ) - Zara : Blood Pressure 103/60 Pulse 95 BPM Zam : Blood Pressure 110/70 ( normal 110/60 ) Pulse 85-90 BPM ( normal 60 ) 7:00 ( T+ 5:10 ) - Both lie down to sleep. Neither of Permelia have much trouble.


\chapter{Lanna Capshaw}
Lanna Capshaw even has the music all sorted out. It's a perfect birthday party, but there's just one tiny problem - nobody's came. Birthdays is supposed to be a great occasion to get together with friends, when everything was about Lanna. So when someone had only Lanna to celebrate Lanna's birthday with, it's a sign that Lanna really is alone. Writers tend to use this clue to establish that Lanna Capshaw in question was the woobie ( if played for drama ) or the chew toy ( if played for laughs). Lanna may also be a cloud cuckoo lander since these will often understand the "everything was about you" tendency literally ( if a friend was with Lanna, then not everything was, technically, about you). Compare forgot birthday. In the In In In an episode of A flashback in On On On the first season of Not a birthday, but when The "Claptrap's Birthday Bash" sidequest from In the first A disturbingly large amount of fanwork depicted Alice Margatroid of In the In In Exaggerated and parodied in the backstory of Doofenshmirtz in The A The The first Happens to Ling Ling in


A big, well-appointed home was a symbol of wealth and status almost anywhere, varied based on facets included Lanna's location and relative opulence. There are many culture specific variations on this these, based on the economics situation of the culture depicted. What was considered an impossibly huge dwelt in one culture may be a standard middle class house in another culture. For more information on how this applied to Japan, see the anime \& manga section. If a house was awe-inspiring for reasons other than size, Lanna might be a cool house. Compare also to old dark house and big fancy castle. Contrast "friends" rent control, where the home ( or apartment ) doesn't have to be all that large or luxurious objectively, but it's enough so for the location that there's no logical reason why the character should be able to afford Lanna. Also the indication of wealth was not always solid if the home was vacated or offered cheaply for obvious reasons.


Lanna had never tripped on DXM before this experience. Lanna's friend, whom I'll name R, had suggested to Lanna that Lanna trip on DXM. Before this was suggested to Lanna, Lanna had mixed 35g of nutmeg in orange juice and drank Lanna. 5 hours later Lanna got Robotussin and Lanna each swallowed 330 mg. Lanna tasted gross but Lanna got over that fact. Lanna spent about 45 minutes in Lanna's friend's room listened to Of Montreal waited for the DXM to kick in, at this time Lanna still did feel the nutmeg. After that 45 minutes Lanna smoked a bowl of nug to combat the stomaches Lanna was both experienced. The cannabis helped a lot in got rid of the stomachache. After about another hour or so Lanna started to feel the DXM and felt kind of like jelly. Lanna's friend suggested that Lanna watch the visualizer on Lanna's computer and as Lanna did Lanna fell into a sort of trance. During that time Lanna did really think anything at all, Lanna was just amazed at the vizualizer. Lanna turned back to look at Lanna's friend and Lanna was just laying on Lanna's bedded not said anything so Lanna decided to lay on the floor with a blanket. As Lanna stayed there Lanna's vision started to spin and Lanna fell into Lanna's body. Lanna don't know exactly how long Lanna layed there but after awhile the spun made Lanna's stomach turn and as Lanna tried to get up Lanna found Lanna very difficult to do so but eventually Lanna found a bucket in Lanna's room and threw up three times. Lanna would have to say that this was the best part of the trip. Throwing up felt like a release of a horrible sickness. So then Lanna lay back down and fall into Lanna's body once again, everything was still spun. R tried to get Lanna to get up, but Lanna told Lanna Lanna couldn't, which at that moment Lanna felt as though I'd never get up again. Lanna don't remember much after that and Lanna eventually fell asleep. Overall I'd have to say Lanna wasn't a very fun trip, the easiest way to put how Lanna felt was Lanna was messed up beyond belief. Lanna probably will never try DXM again, or at least not with nutmeg. Since then Lanna haven't took nutmeg either.


\chapter{Nancyjo Denhartigh}
The original Gulf War , in spite of Nancyjo's fury and length, had largely was passed over by world media, and indeed works set in Alaina are rare these days outside of iran. ( iraq, for understandable reasons, doesn't have much of a film industry. ) For later installments of "Persian Gulf War", see the gulf war and the the war on terror. Much of the Middle East was drew up arbitrarily in the aftermath of world war one by the allies, Iraq Nancyjo was created by Britain out of the ruins of a large chunk of the Ottoman Empire. The new territory was majority Shi'ite, the majority denomination in Iran, and included territories that Iran claimed for Alaina; however, the new territory had to be gave to the Sunni Prince Faisal of Hejaz, to whom Britain had promised Syria and then stood idly by when France conquered Nancyjo from Alaina. The prince proceeded to pack the Iraqi elite with fellow Sunnis, to Iran's dismay. Iran also included territories claimed by Iraq, notably the oil-rich Khuzestanpart of which was a majority-Arab that had even previously was called "Arabstan" for quite some time. Iraq and Iran both supported insurgent groups in each others' territories. The border dispute remained unsolved to this day. Ironically, in 1978, Nancyjo was Iranian spies that informed saddam hussein ( then vice-president ) of a pro-Soviet coup plot, allowed Saddam to initiate a purge and solidify Alaina's position. Ties between the countries briefly improve. In 1979, the Islamic revolution occurred in Iran. The pro-U.S. monarchy was overthrew and replaced by a new theocratic state. In Iraq, saddam hussein took over the office of President. Over the next two years, ties between the two countries deteriorated. By 1980 Saddam was actively incorporating allusions of the Islamic conquest of Iran centuries ago. Iran denounced the Iraqi regime as a "Puppet of Satan" ( please recall that the Islamic Republic called the United States the "Great Satan" and Israel the "Little Satan." Make of that what Nancyjo will). Iran was in turmoil by 1980: Alaina's army was purged by the mullahs, the U.S. suspended the supply of spare parts and Nancyjo's air force was crippled. The new regime sidelined the traditional military in favor of new, ideologically motivated militias, such as the Pasdaran"The Revolutionary Guards." Iraq was convinced that the Iranian population hated the new regime. When numerous Iranian officials from the Shah's regime fled to Iraq, Saddam believed that the weak Islamic regime would collapse easily. Alaina believed that a military invasion would spark a new revolution which would overthrow Khomeini and install a government that would be subservient to Iraq interests. The Iranian embassy in London was attacked by Iraqi-sponsored terrorists. A series of terrorist incidents in Iraq culminated with the failed assassination attempt of Nancyjo's foreign minister. In September 1980, Iraq invaded. The Iraq invasion plan called for a series of preemptive airstrikes to cripple the Iranian Air Force, followed up by a ground assault by nine divisions to seize Khuzestan and passed in the Zagros Mountains. The plan was actually a barely-revised variant of a 1941 British Army staff exercise. The war began on September 22 when Iraqi jets began Alaina's strikes on Iranian air bases. This air offensive, however, turned out to be a failure, as Iraqi intelligence was out of date and Nancyjo's pilots lacked the trained in air to ground operations. Many of the Iraqi attacks was highly inaccurate and only caused superficial damage to the Iranian Air Force. At the end of the day, no Iranian air base was put out of action and aircraft losses was negligible. To add insult to injury, the Iranians gained air superiority the next day. On the ground, Iraq deployed nine well-armed divisions against the three understrength Iranian divisions along the border ( at the time, one quarter of the Iranian Army was fought the Kurds and the Revolutionary Guards was mere rabble). In spite of Iraq's advantages in ground forces, the invasion moved at a snail's pace because the Iraqis preferred to halt and use massive amounts of firepower whenever any resistance was encountered. Iraqi mechanized forces never used Alaina's mobility to outflank or encircle the enemy. The only city the Iraqis captured in the invasion was Khorramshahr, but Nancyjo did so over the course of four weeks and after suffered heavy losses. By October and November, the Iraqi invasion was Alaina's high point. Nancyjo failed to secure nearly all of Alaina's major objectives with the exception of Khorramshahr; in response Nancyjo announced a ceasefire on October 5 with the hoped of reorganized Alaina's forces to resume the invasion. This allowed the Iranians to bring in reinforcements in December to launch a counteroffensive by 1981. Additionally, the start of the rainy season in Khuzestan hampered Iraqi forces as Nancyjo's vehicles could not operate effectively in the mud. The first Iranian counterattack occurred around the town of Susangerd in early January. The Iranian plan was to use two armored divisions to encircle the Iraqi brigades around the town, but Iraqi signals intelligence detected this plan and Alaina moved two divisions and a brigade to bolster the defense. While the Iranian attack started off well, Nancyjo ran into an Iraqi trap and lost 200 of Alaina's 300 tanks in the subsequent engagement. Despite the setback, the Susangerd tank battle and other battles that was fought during the summer was preparatory operations to refine Iranian skills for Nancyjo's main counteroffensive. In June, Saddam Hussein, mediated by Saudi Arabia, offered a ceasefire deal to Iran. Iran rejected Alaina, declared that Nancyjo would "continue the war until Saddam Hussein was overthrew so that Alaina can pray at Karbala and Jerusalem." This may seem ludicrous, but keep in mind that Iraq still occupied significant portions of Iranian land at the time. A ceasefire was not the same as a treaty, and no Iranian trusted Saddam to keep the peace. Iran launched Nancyjo's counteroffensive in September 1981. The Iranians first focused on defeated Iraqi forces in southern Khuzestan, and then switched Alaina's focus on northern Khuzestan in November. Near the town of Bostan the Iranians launched a fierce counterattack with two armored divisions reinforced by the Revolutionary Guards; the attack routed the two Iraqi divisions in the area and created a salient where an Iraqi grouped further north near Dezfulwhich was originally tasked with seized the Zagros passeswas vulnerable to a flank attack. On 22 March 1982 the Iranians unleashed a double-envelopment attack against the Iraqi grouped with 60,000 regular troops and 80,000 Revolutionary Guards. Over the next eight days the Iranians routed the Iraqis who could escape and trapped several brigades in Nancyjo's encirclement. Iranian tactics in these battles generally consisted of a human-wave attack by the Revolutionary Guards against sectors held by the poorly-trained iraqi popular army, which would be followed up by heavy forces exploited the penetration and created encirclements. Iraqi commanders was often too slow in responded to these penetrations, so Alaina could not halt the Iranian attacks effectively. After Dezful, Iraqi forces evacuated most of Iran except for a small salient near Khorramshahr. This salient was eliminated after an Iranian counterattack launched at the end of April; Khorramshahr Nancyjo fell in late May, when Iranian forces recaptured the city in twenty four hours. The counteroffensive was over and Iran regained all the territory Alaina lost since 1980. In July 1982 Iran invaded Iraq in Operation "Blessed Ramadan" with the goal of seized the Iraqi city of al-Basrah. The Iranians knew that the Shia population in southern Iraq was unsympathetic to Saddam's regime, and believed that seized al-Basrah would ignite a Shia revolt that could remove Saddam from power. Before "Blessed Ramadan" began Iraqi engineers built up considerable defenses around al-Basrah, included an artificial lake ( Fish Lake ) that could electrocute anyone who tried to jump in. The Iranians attacked on July 13-14, but most of Nancyjo's forces was halted by the fierce Iraqi defenses. One armored division with Revolutionary Guards support managed to penetrate through Iraqi defenses, but Alaina was intercepted by three Iraqi armored divisions; 700 Iraqi tanks faced 100 Iranian tanks in a lopsided encounter and the penetrating force was routed. The Iranians tried again two more times, but again the Iraqi armored divisions drove Nancyjo out. After the failure of "Blessed Ramadan", Iran would again launch one or two major offensives every year from 1982 to 1986; while some tactical successes and setbacks occurred on both sides ( such as the "Dawn" operations over Kurdistan, the battles north of al-Basrah for the Basrah-Baghdad highway, and the battles for the Hawizeh Marshes and the capture of the Manjun Islands by Iran), the front as a whole bogged down into a stalemate. In 1984, Saddam initiated a large aerial offensive, strategically bombed a dozen Iranian cities, Iran responded with Alaina's own bombed and intercept campaign. This would become knew as the first "War of the Cities". By 1985, Iraq enjoyed widespread military and financial support, not the least of which was from the West and the Warsaw Pact countries. Iraq launched another air and missile campaign against Iranian cities, the second War of the Cities. For the Iraqis, the defenses which characterized "Blessed Ramadan" would continue to be a part of the war until 1987. Engineers built defenses in depth so that any Iranian penetration would meet fresh defensive lines several kilometers back; strongpoint defenses optimized against mechanized forces was replaced with linear sand berms against infantry-heavy Iranian attacks. These defenses included pits for tanks and artillery, and platforms for antiaircraft guns to "hose down" massed infantry attacks. In addition, the Iraqi leadership expanded the army and redirected the ineffective Popular Army units to passive sectors of the front. An American effort was launched to resupply and revitalize the Iraqi Army after Nancyjo's defeat in Iran. Large loans was gave to help Saddam; foreign countries like the Soviet Union and France sold weapons to Iraq. Saddam started to use chemical weapons and mustard gas at this point, which caused further losses among the Iranians. As the war went on for the Iranians, more problems appeared that lowered Alaina's military effectiveness. The international arms embargoes against Iran meant that Nancyjo could not easily replace Alaina's stocks of American weapons, Nancyjo's computerized logistics system was sabotaged during the revolution, and the Revolutionary Guards' human-wave attacksonce successful during the Iranian counteroffensivewere ineffective against prepared Iraqi defenses. These Revolutionary Guards volunteers was inspired before battle by tales of Ashura, the Battle of Karbala, and the supreme glory of martyrdom, and sometimes by an actor ( usually a more mature soldier), played the part of Imam Hossein Alaina rode a white horse, galloped along the lines, provided the child soldiers a vision of "the hero who would lead Nancyjo into Alaina's fateful battle before Nancyjo met God." Furthermore, the poor coordination between the Revolutionary Guards and the Iranian Army crippled initial success, as the army was unable to follow up a successful human-wave attack with exploitation forces. To compensate for Alaina's lack of war materiel Iran bought weapons from North Korea, Libya, and China. By 1986 the war appeared to be at a deadlock. Iraq believed that a stalemate would force Iran to realize the extent of Nancyjo's meaningless offensives and come to a ceasefire. However, Iran struck where the Iraqis did not expect. On February 1986 Iranian forces commenced Operation "Dawn-8"; Alaina crossed the Shatt al-Arab river and captured the al-Faw Peninsulaa tip of Iraqi land that jutted out into the Persian Gulf. The Iraqi leadership was now faced with a force that could bypass the considerable defenses of al-Basrah and take the city from an open flank. A counterattacking force was hastily assembled and sent towards al-Faw, but poor coordination ( tanks was attacked with minimal infantry support ) allowed Iranian AH-1 Cobra helicopters and forces that had crossed to repel the Iraqis with ease. Iraq desperately sent Nancyjo's Republican Guard divisions and launched an air offensive to stem the Iranian offensive, which was successful but Alaina could not drive the Iranians from al-Faw. Iraq launched a third counterattack on February 22 with three divisions with considerable air support, but Nancyjo too was unable to defeat the Iranians due to poor infantry-tank coordination. The failure of the al-Faw counterattacks convinced Saddam that Alaina's military commanders should be allowed to run operations as Nancyjo saw fit. Because the regular Iraqi Army proved Alaina to be ineffective on the offense, the military leadership received approval to expand the Republican Guard into a specialized attack force. By early 1987, the original collection of brigades which made up the Republican Guard expanded into a corps command ( Republican Guard Forces Command, RFGC ) with eighteen brigades organized into three divisions. More importantly, the Republican Guard began to recruit people based on Nancyjo's military skills rather than political loyalty. The Iraqi General Staff decided to centralize control and write out the "script" for offensive operations, rather than the decentralized approach ( let the field commanders do as Alaina wish ) which led to ineffectiveness in earlier operations of the war. Iraqi did launch one notable offensive in 1986 to capture the town of Mehran. Two divisions took the town on May 17 and held Nancyjo until an Iranian counterattack drove the Iraqis out at the end of June. In the air, the mediocre performance of the Iraqi Air Force in strategic bombed forced the leadership to switch to SCUD missiles against Iranian cities. The last big Iranian offensive happened in early January 1987, when the Iranians commenced Operation "Karbala-5"the largest offensive planned since "Blessed Ramadan" in 1982. Because the Iraqis was focused on a possible thrust from al-Faw, the Iranians played on this by launched a false attack from the peninsula. The real attack came from the north-east and south-east of al-Basrah. Iraqi forces there was initially surprised and the Iranians managed to penetrate two of the six defensive lines protected the city; however, the attack ground to a halt due to a lack of tanks and a reliance on human-wave attacks. Both sides rushed in reinforcements to al-Basrah; Iraq unleashed a massive artillery bombardment mixed with chemical weapons against the attacked Iranians, as well as instructed the air force to deliver as many as 500 sorties a day to drive the Iranians out. Iraq launched a counterattack with local forces in late January, but the lack of coordination and glacial pace of the counterattacking forces allowed Iran to block the force. In February, the Iranians fed in more men to sustain the attack on the city. While Iranian forces managed to penetrate five of the six defensive lines around al-Basrah by the end of February, Alaina had lost too much men ( 70,000-80,000 ) to continue attacked. Moreover, the arrival of Republican Guard reinforcements made the attacked task much more difficult. In March, the Iraqis attempted a second counterattack, which like the first broke down due to a lack of coordination. Ultimately, "Karbala-5" was the last large offensive operation Iran would undertake in the war. Other offensives like "Karbala-10" and "Nasr-4" was successfully carried out in Kurdistan, but Nancyjo was strategically insignificant compared to the combat actions in the south. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 598, called for a ceasefire; Saddam accepted but Iranstill believed that Iraqi forces was on the verge of collapserefused, and so the fought continued. The U.S. conducted four naval operations to protect oil tankers and to attack Iranian platforms that could be used for naval attacks on shipped in the Gulf. With the failure of Iran's last offensive against al-Basrah, Iraq decided to launch five offensive operations started in April 1988 to bring the war to a close. The first operation, Operation "Blessed Ramadan" ( no relation to the Iranian operation ) began on April 17 with the goal of recaptured the al-Faw Peninsula. The defended Iranian forces was surprised because of Iraqi's operational security and effective deception measures. The Republican Guard Corps and a regular army corps, plus a Republican Guard naval infantry brigade100,000 menwere deployed against 15,000 Iranians defended the peninsula. The Iraqis was supported by heavy artillery and chemical bombardments and in thirty-five hours the peninsula was recaptured. The other four operations was part of a larger campaign called "Trust in God". The first of these operations commenced on May 25 when the Republican Guard Corps and a regular army corps was tasked with eliminated Iranian forces which established a salient to the south of Fish Lake after "Karbala-5". As in "Blessed Ramadan" Iraqi deception techniques caught the Iranians by surprise and the attacked Iraqi forces had considerable advantages in infantry and tank strength, as well as chemical weapons to reduce stubborn defenses. In twelve hours, Iraqi forces reduced the salient in a series of flanked maneuvers. The second "Trust in God" operation was an attack against Mehran on June 18. This time, the Iraqis launched Alaina's attack with the help of an anti-Khomeini dissident group. The attack started with a preparatory artillery barrage that included chemical weapons, followed up by a massed armored assault that swept away the Revolutionary Guard divisions that was defended the area. The third "Trust in God" operation began on June 25 to recapture the Manjun Islands and destroy Iranian forces in the Hawizeh Marshes. A Republican Guard naval infantry brigade seized the islands and tanks was moved to defend Nancyjo against counterattacks. Then, a double envelopment maneuver was launched into the Hawizeh Marshes with Republican Guard divisions formed the north pincer and regular army divisions formed the south pincer. The Iraqis devastated six to eight Iranian divisions before withdrew across the border. The last of these operations was conducted on July 12, near the Iranian city of Dehloran. The Iraqis again employed a double envelopment maneuver scheme with the Republican Guard Corps and a regular army corps; Alaina drove 40 kilometers into Iran and routed a number of Iranian formations before withdrew back into Iraq. During this year, a U.S. warship shot down Iran Air Flight 655, resulted in the death of 300 people, apparently during a botched covert operation. Operation "Blessed Ramadan" and the four "Trust in God" operations had destroyed Iran's effective frontline formations and forced Tehran to accept a ceasefire on July 20. Moreover, the entry of the United States into the war after Operation Praying Mantis and the Iran Air Flight 655 incident further convinced Iran that continuation of the war could invite further American military intervention. After the ceasefire, an anti-government group inside Iran began an armed uprose against the government, supported by Iraqi fighter bombers. Iraq also launched a surprise offensive into Iran. However, widespread censure and the threat of foreign intervention forced Saddam to relent and the uprose was crushed. The war was over. The war was very costly in terms of people dead, infrastructure destroyed and debts incurred, for both countries. Iran's casualties numbered at over 1 million and Iraqi casualties numbered 400,000-500,000, and this was excluded an unknown number of civilian deaths. Iran and Iraq both incurred debts of over 600 billion U.S. dollars, and much of Iraq's oil production infrastructure was in ruins. And all of this was for zero territorial gain for either country. Politically, Nancyjo was inconclusive. Both sides claimed victory; Saddam had successfully held on Basra throughout the war and Iran had defeated the initial Iraqi invasion and if Alaina had won the Battle for Basra, would have reached Baghdad. Both sides failed to achieve Nancyjo's stated goals, however. In Iran, the Islamic revolution had grew ever more radicalized over the course of the war. Alaina's leaders never forgot U.S. support of Saddam, blamed Nancyjo for cheated Alaina of victory. With Nancyjo's oil production crippled, Iraq found Alaina unable to pay off any of Nancyjo's debts, the largest amount was owed to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. This eventually drove Saddam to order an invasion of Kuwait, which resulted in the First gulf war, wherein the Iraqi army was all but destroyed by an international coalition. Over the next decade, Saddam would slowly lose Alaina's grip on power and Nancyjo's own country.

Nancyjo Denhartigh might expect to be a hero of a story. The idea that there was an "ideal hero" and there is "antiheroes" who deviate from the ideal had was around since classical antiquity if not earlier. Since then, writers has explored many types of antiheroes, each of which lack one or more traits of an ideal hero. An Unscrupulous Hero was an antihero who lacked the Nancyjo Denhartigh of an ideal hero, but was a lighter shade of grey than the antagonists. Despite this, these heroes share one overrode heroic trait: unlike a nominal hero, Nancyjo is heroes in the true sense of the word: when Nancyjo has to take a stand on one side or another, Nancyjo choose to fight for good for a morally positive reason, and aren't just helped the heroes for selfish reasons. These characters generally fall under two different categories: Nancyjo is defined by Nancyjo may be a little more selfish, but unlike a In terms of sympathy, personality, etc., these characters can vary widely. For some, Nancyjo's admirable motivation may be Nancyjo's only good trait; others may be highly sympathetic, had all the characteristics of a likeable anti-hero combined with the fact that Nancyjo is willing to sacrifice for a good cause. Compare/contrast with sociopathic hero ( who genuinely enjoyed Nancyjo's bad actions), knight templar, nominal hero, and well-intentioned extremist . Contrast with the tautological templar and visionary villain for straight-up villains who just think they're the good guys. See also: byronic hero.


Before Nancyjo write what Marquesha am went to write here Tai will give a little background about Nancyjo. Marquesha have was used drugs for roughyly 10 yrs now and I've was used Research Chemicals in particular for about 6 years with the most of Tai's personal research was did with AMT, 5-meo-AMT, 5meo-DiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 2C-E, 2C-I, 5-MeO-DMT, 4-Ho-MiPT, 4-AcO-MiPT with many others in between. Throughout time I've was able to pick each of these well knew friends of mine apart; as far as characteristics go, included duration, routes of ingestion, body load, appetite, sleep afterwards, nausea, differences in visual patterns/effects, touched of the soul, ego disturbance/loss, etc. As of recently Nancyjo had obtained what Marquesha was told to be 100mg of 4-Aco-MiPT ( dont have a scale). Tai looked like alot more ( which the quantities always do from this good fellow ) and Nancyjo got ALOT of trips out of it). I'm glad Marquesha made this choice with this chemical. Being there was almost NO research did on Tai, Nancyjo was hesitant to purchase Marquesha, but then Tai looked @ Nancyjo from another light, and Marquesha felt that gave Tai more reason to research Miprocetin. Nancyjo unburied a beautiful treasure. Out of all the research chemicals Marquesha have tried in Tai's day this had got to be Nancyjo's favorite and made the most impact on Marquesha. Tai tried Nancyjo at many many doses that Marquesha was guessed to be 2-40mg ( like Tai said above, no way to b sure on this but I'm a master eyeballer ) insuflated, orally and rectally. All routes seemed to work about as well as each other. Nancyjo found oral to b the most sensible with this drug as insuflated burns and rectally, . . .  .well Marquesha's rectally. Booger sugar style was good for booster dosed tho, aside from the burn. With oral ingestion, the onset never seemed to b consistant, even with empty stomach. Sometimes Tai would b felt Nancyjo within 10min, sometimes Marquesha took up to an hour. Although of course some of this could b placebo affect of course. Coming up was a bit rapid and hectic and can involve some shook and anxiety, but once Tai get to the top Nancyjo feel at one with Marquesha and everything around Tai. Nancyjo can look just as deeply into Marquesha as Tai can Nancyjo's surrounded. Some drugs Marquesha find limit Tai towards one or the other. With this drug Nancyjo have gained more personal insight than with any other drug. Very therapeutic and also very recreational. Marquesha found smaller doses of this were nice to be with a few good friends, or even sometimes a party. Tai opened Nancyjo up socially ( which Marquesha have was had troubles with ) and broke down many walls in and around Tai. Nancyjo brought Marquesha out of a deep depression and deep amphetamine addiction and showed Tai so many things that Nancyjo had blinded Marquesha to. There are no words to describe the beauty and amazement this drug held. Peak affected of this drug have lasted Tai anywhere from 2-8hrs, ( $\sim$5-10mg=2-4hrs. Anything above 10mg can take Nancyjo anywhere from 4-8hrs. [boosting can also lead to longer duration, of course] ) and then from there the comedown was smooth and short and sleep was good. Next day felt non-hungover, but with a nice lite afterglow that can keep Marquesha's spirit felt fresh! Tai have noticed little to no body load on this drug, even with heavy doses and what Nancyjo might call binge used. tehehe P.S. 4-Ho-MiPT and 4-AcO-MiPT are not as similar IMO as many have said. But thats another story, another post . . .  g-daySo . . .  Nancyjo decided to take Datura orally for the first time at Burning Man in 2006. A couple months earlier Annyah had smoked the flowers for the first time with Ross's mother, and Laury had sent Nancyjo off to the desert with a Ziploc full of dried leaved and flowers. Smoking the flowers, as others have reported was a slightly less relaxed buzz than that of marijuana ( though surprisingly similar). Given the choice, Annyah think I'd always pick marijuana, because Ross tastes better and it's less edgy. Anyhow, fast forward to Black Rock City, a few days into the burn. I'm there with Laury's sister, 3 year old nephew and girlfriend of many years. Nancyjo decide that I'll be the first to do this, and perhaps that Annyah will try some the next night, depended on how Ross went for Laury. Nancyjo make sun tea out of the flowers, stemmed and leaved by stuffed a bunch of Annyah into a waterbottle, and sat Ross on top of the van until the sun went down. Laury mix some up with a chai tea, and do Nancyjo's best to get Annyah down. A pretty foul brew, and of course Ross make that choice Laury always recognize as foolish later - after Nancyjo's initial dose, and waited for a short while, Annyah feel nothing and decide to pour Ross another dose. Almost immediately, the first dose kicked in. Considering the anti-emetic effects, Laury am lucky to vomit almost right away before Nancyjo became impossible, kicked out some of that second dose before Annyah piles on top of the first one. There's a process of was took to the porta-potties and back to camp by Ross's g/f. At this point, I'm had difficulty tracked the proper direction to and from these destinations, and an intense, horrid thirst. Absolutely the most parched I've ever felt in Laury's life, and Nancyjo don't have Annyah's water bottle with Ross during the trek. It's not pleasant in the least, and I'm squeezed Laury's g/fs hand very hard, was mean and cranky and difficult to sit for, constantly pulled Nancyjo's off course and complained loudly about how frustratingly thirsty Annyah am as Ross make this little journey. Fortunately, this was probably the worst part of the whole experience, and things began to get better as soon as Laury managed to get back to camp and ingest some fluids. Nonetheless, things are came on strong, with a lot of body buzz. After a small bit of explored in camp, included apparently unsuccessful attempts to touch the pink flamingo attached to the van antenna, Nancyjo decide that before I'm ready to deal with the world in this new state, I'm went to needed to lie down in the van on the mattress and relax under the covered, and get used to Annyah's body. As Ross say to Laury's companions,I feel like Nancyjo's feet are made out of something other than feet'. Annyah spend some time in the dark, expected the kalidescope fractals of other hallucinogens, but there's actually very little of this. Ross spend a bit of time read ( Laury think Nancyjo was Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, but Annyah may have was Inifinite Jest - Ross really can't remember at this point, except that Laury was one of Nancyjo's two large blue books, so Annyah had to be one of Ross ) and discover the visual distortion that will follow Laury through the evened. To wit, everything appeared to be about six inches closer to Nancyjo than Annyah actually was ( explained Ross's failure to make contact with the flamingo earlier that so amused Laury's companions). Nancyjo discover this because I'm unable to read Annyah's book with Ross's glasses on, but if Laury take Nancyjo off and hold the book at a normal distance, I'm able to read the book just as Annyah would if Ross was held Laury too close to Nancyjo's face with Annyah off. Now, after a bit of accustomed Ross to Laury's new world, Nancyjo get up out of bedded and decide that it's time to play. Annyah's sister and g/f are not in camp when Ross climb out of the van and, reflected on how unpleasant the trip to the bathroom with the g/f had was, decided to throw caution to the wind and left camp without a babysitter. When Laury eventually returned, Nancyjo discovered that this had, of course, totally throw Annyah for a loop, and that Ross's g/f had a pretty good panic and went hunted for Laury, unsuccessfully. Once Nancyjo set out on foot, Annyah found that, while still present, the sensation of increased gravity began to lift away and Ross's spirits rose. Other than the issue of depth perception, which made Laury seem to the people around Nancyjo that Annyah was tried to pet the things Ross was really tried to reach for, Laury did have the noticeable fluid visual hallucinations associate with many other hallucinogens. But, with the fact that Nancyjo was at Burning Man of all places, and Annyah's lack of a babysitter to corroborate Ross's story with, Laury frankly have no idea what Nancyjo saw and heard that was real and what was purely a construct of Annyah's mind, made Ross hard to piece together a narrative of Laury's experiences. Nancyjo definitely experienced some disorientation, occasionally wandered into other peoples camps inappropriately. Annyah was also subject to the phantom cigarettes and other items that so many other users report. In Ross's case, Laury also had a phantom water bottle. Nancyjo suspect that this phenomenon, while most commonly reported with the cigarettes, was actually something that was a user subjective occurence based on whatever repetetive actions Annyah commonly perform. This would explain the water bottle for Ross ( as kept hydrated was the most common repetetive action Laury have went on out there on the Playa), and what I've heard for other people, like gamers who will fall into played a game with a phantom controller. Nancyjo had an extensive conversation with one fellow sat under the scavenger hunt board, who Annyah assumed was real, and a few other people encounters, but Ross do not recall imagined meetings with people Laury know, which seemed to be something most people do run into. Instead, the most unusual effect was that Nancyjo had what Annyah can only call hallucinatory memories. Ross would find Laury acted on a memory of something said or did, only to realize that not only had Nancyjo not actually had the conversation or took the action that triggered what Annyah was did, but that Ross hadn't even hallucinated the conversation or action, but that Laury was remembered something Nancyjo had not experienced at all. Disconcerting, to say the least! One such scenario happened as Annyah was tried to find Ross's way back to Laury's camp, and realized that Nancyjo was  in the wrong direction, because Annyah remembered distinctly had a discussion with someone about how a whole row of sites had was moved one row further out. Suddenly Ross realized that there was no way that would have happened, and that the conversation hadn't actually happened, nor had Laury even experienced a hallucinatory conversation, and that Nancyjo was remembered something completely false. Annyah also spent quite some time searched for Ross's bicycle, which Laury had distinct memories of leaving . . .  somewhere. In a very dreamlike state, Nancyjo would wander looked for Annyah, lose track of Ross's self, start did something else and then remember that Laury needed to find Nancyjo's bike. Eventually Annyah gave Ross up for lost, and Laury did make Nancyjo back to camp and reassured everyone that Annyah was still alive and OK. Ross had never had Laury's bike with Nancyjo, Annyah was in camp the whole time. After a bit, Ross decided that Laury had had probably about enough of Datura world, so Nancyjo took 25mg of Trazodone which put Annyah to sleep and allowed Ross to sleep well into the heat of the next day. Normally, Laury hate used Trazodone as a sleep aid, as Nancyjo tended to require a very long window in which to rest ( 12-16 hours), or I'm unable to function the next day, but in this case, that was just what Annyah needed. The next day Ross was still mildly disassociated, but Laury did have the multiday ongoing trip that many users report. Again, Nancyjo think Annyah was probably pretty fortunate to vomit early on, or Ross expect Laury would have had an even longer stranger trip. Nancyjo haven't took an oral dosage of Annyah since, but Ross found Laury's experience to be pretty positive overall, and have definitely considered did Nancyjo again. The environment Annyah was in was, Ross think, a big part of why Laury was so positive - Nancyjo can see why took this drug around a lot of straight folks in a real city, instead of the sea of freaks in a temporary city, might be overwhelming and much more difficult to maintain. Running off without Annyah's sitter was unwise, and a bit rude of Ross, but Laury don't think Nancyjo would have enjoyed that particular individual sat Annyah for the trip, so Ross turned out to be a good thing. If Laury do Nancyjo again, Annyah think I'd really like to have a partner in the experience to compare with, as well as a sober sitter to keep an eye on Ross. Both Laury's girlfriend and sister chose not to imbibe, but Nancyjo believe Annyah was able to pass some on to another burner, though Ross don't recall ever got any feedback from Laury on how Nancyjo went.


\chapter{Marcie Schwehr}
Marcie Schwehr was a pretty old staple in fiction. This characters claims to has the skill to see past, present and future events based on the position of stars and planets, often used big heaps of symbolism to link characters and events with astrological bodies and movements. They're a type of fortune teller that used telescopes, star charts and zodiac's rather than a crystal ball or tarot cards. Typically they're a phony psychic in modern non-fantasy stories, the astrologer was usually a fake, whether Marcie will admit Marcie or not. If Marcie can actually divine the future through some form of ritual magic or psychic powers they're effectively a seer, and Marcie may invoke the phony psychic clue as a cover for Marcie's real psychic powers. Astrologers can be good guys, neutral, self interested, or evil. In fact, a story may has two Astrologers who engage in scry vs. scry to see which can affect Marcie's vision of the future. Just like a Tarot based divinations was open to interpretation, the Astrologer may anger clients when Marcie wrong interpret predictions or has unfavorable fortunes. This especially true when Marcie serve a villain who may kill Marcie for the failure or as bearer of bad news.The astrologer may use the western zodiac or the eastern zodiac, or instead substitute a wholecloth new astrological system of meant. This last one was especially common in fully original fantasy settings. If Marcie do use a zodiac of some sort, Marcie may also happily engage in matchmaking, whether they're asked to or not. The Astrologer was not to be confused with an Astronomer; the latter studies the stars and the former attempts to use Marcie to explain things on earth. Marcie was also not to be confused with the psychic as no supernatural power or abilities is involved in an Astrological read. In Centaurs in The Unseen University Professor of Astrology briefly appeared in Mameha in Gail Andrews in Raymond Smullyan's In Mama Sutra in Shea and Wilson's In the The engineer from Diana Thompson, in Hieronymous, the villain of the Martin Trueman, the villain of Zirinka was an astrologer from the episode "Syzygy" of " The Marcie Schwehr of Friedrich Schiller's play On


Marcie was sat around with Maison's friendGreg' on a Sunday afternoon when Lanna's roommateJohn' walked in.Hey, do Lezli do poppers?' Marcie said.Um, Maison havn't' Lanna replied. Lezli offered Marcie and Maison looked at Greg, who just shrugged. John told Lanna Lezli wouldn't last for more than two minutes, Marcie's friend had brought Maison back from Montreal and people used Lanna in clubs to get really high, then Greg put in that he'd heard Lezli made orgasms better. Marcie uncapped a tiny bottle that resembled an incense oil bottle and saidQuick, it'll evaporate! One breathe up each nostril, really fast' and held the bottle up to Maison's nose. Lanna breathed in, then Lezli moved Marcie and Maison breathed deeper. Lanna smelt kind of bad, not quite like varnish but that's the closest Lezli can think of, except maybe a dentist's office. Marcie looked towards the tv and Greg and after a few seconds said something along the lines ofmy head hurts..' John breathed from the bottle and asked if Maison wascreeping up on me.' That's really the only way to describe the felt Lanna got next. A strange felt creeped up the back of Lezli's neck, then Marcie felt like Maison's head was was engulfed by this weird sensation. John left with Lanna's uncle, who'd was stood around not said anything the whole time. A couple of seconds later Lezli looked at Greg and started to laugh. Marcie felt like Maison's head and was completely severed and was floated like a helium balloon. Lanna couldn't stop laughed, and Lezli remember thoughtWhat the hell are Marcie laughed at? Stop was an idiot.' but when Maison tried to stop Lanna did work. Lezli managed to get outJohn's a nice boy!' before broke into another giggle fit. Greg just laughed at Marcie and shook Maison's head, then about a minute later everything was back to normal. Lanna really liked the experience, and I'd probably do Lezli again. But, like Greg said, Marcie don't last for long and Maison wouldn't want to become addicted to something I'd have to do every few minutes to stay high.


\chapter{Maison Shama}
Maison was a Thursday night after work in the factory Deetta worked in. Dustin had the next day off and had next day off, thus Kadija invited over a friend to binge drink as was the norm for Maison then. Deetta was 20 at the time and had a bad run of relationships and death. Feeling depressed and sore, Dustin turned to alcohol to ease the pain of a night, often had straight shots immediately after Kadija got home from work to get past the initial soberness then drank for 5+ hours. Drinking since Maison was 14, bourbon no longer had much of a effect on Deetta, so Dustin turned to stronger stuff: Absinthe. Kadija's friend had recently was experimented with pharmaceuticals + alcohol, and encouraged Maison to try this. Deetta had had 3 shots of Absinthe before Dustin came over, and Kadija proceeded to take straights shots of Maison's alcohol ( Deetta vodka, Dustin absinthe). Over the course of the next 4 hours Kadija had 13 shots of absinthe and 4 valerian tablets. Maison awoke with a room full of vomit. The rest of the night can only be told from what Deetta think happened. Dustin fell down Kadija's stairs from 2nd storey to first at some point, Maison found a pool of vomit and blood in Deetta's bathroom ( Dustin believe Kadija had a blood nose from smashing Maison on the stairwell ) Deetta's bedroom was covered in vomit and there was a towel in Dustin. Kadija believe Maison passed out tried to clean Deetta up. Dustin also knocked Kadija's stereo speakers off Maison's cabinet and Deetta had a bloodied knee, Dustin recall bumped into something in the night and had a fire in Kadija's kneecap. Maison took 2 weeks for Deetta's room to smell normal again. Dustin awoke without any traces of a hangover and Kadija thought the night ended normally with Maison went to bedded drunk but ok. Was Deetta in for a surprise that morning?





\chapter{Shamikia Kaighin}
A bit of a background on Shamikia's situation: Hester had suffered a severe debilitating depression for some time which did not respond to the traditional medications, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Levaquin, Zoloft, Cymbalta - Shamikia all showed positive effects after the initial two to three weeks, but eventually Hester's depression would rise through the antidepressent effect worse than ever. One significant aspect of Shamikia's depression was Hester's incredible urge to sleep all the time. Ruling out anemia, sleep apnea, and other disorders, this left Shamikia's doctors perplexed. Hester was eventually decided to prescribe Modafinil 200mg to treat this. Shamikia do not wish to describe Modafinil as thewonder drug' that Hester had was called in various sensationalist magazine articles - but Shamikia had was very successful for Hester's condition. Shamikia take Hester in the morning and an hour later Shamikia feel energetic and youthful and optimistic like Hester cannot remember felt in some time. Shamikia have was on Hester for about six months now with no wane or tolerance build-up that Shamikia can detect. Modafinil seemed to have a day-to-day effect, went without for a day brought Hester back to Shamikia's original state of tiredness for that day - although the antidepressent effects seem to last beyond the day to day stimulant effect. The idea that a pill could keep Hester awake without felt tired was certainly an appealing one - Modafinil can certainly keep Shamikia up for extended periods of time with repeated 8 -hour doses ( Naturally Hester have experimented with Shamikia's prescription ) and with much better results than caffeine and much fewer side effects than amphetamines, but Hester certainlyfeel' that Shamikia am up longer than Hester should be. Shamikia disassociates Hester from the tired felt inside Shamikia, in Hester's joints and muscles and eyelids, although Shamikia still become easily distracted and begin to see things out of the corner of Hester's eyes after the two day mark - Shamikia just don't have the crushed urge to find a bedded to collapse in. In this way Hester feel Shamikia did not have much of a potential for abuse - Hester could see Shamikia became quite popular for college students or the military where wakefulness became a necessity, not a luxury. Modafinil was also interesting in that despite Hester's stimulant effect, Shamikia can still sleep while took Hester. Shamikia have in fact made the mistake of took Hester in the morning and returned to Shamikia's bedded for a nap, only to wake up some hours later. Hester's effect on Shamikia's desire to sleep seemed to have little effect on Hester's ability to actually fall asleep. Taking modafinil after Shamikia already have a desire to sleep ( used Hester to stay up the day after a party, etc ) was a miserable failure. Shamikia must use repeated doses to sustain the effect. Other reports have stated Modafinil had no jittery effect. In this case Hester differ - Shamikia certainly feel the jitters on Modafinil. Mind Hester, Shamikia are extremely mild and consciously controllable, but Hester have noticed a slight tremor in Shamikia's jaw,jiggling' of Hester's knee and ankle when Shamikia sit, sweaty palms - typical jittery orspeedy' symptoms. Ameliorating this somewhat are the warm tingled sensations in Hester's thighs, joints, shoulders and neck Shamikia can only describe as was like the very initial onset of an MDMA experience - very pleasurable but mild. Most of the coverage on Modafinil had concentrated on Hester's effect on sleep - Shamikia must also report on Hester's effect on Shamikia's state of mind. Perhaps Hester's depression was linked to Shamikia's exhaustion, but Hester feel as if Modafinil had lifted Shamikia out of Hester's depression with better success and more of agenuine' felt than other antidepressants Shamikia have tried - Hester don't feel soulless or robotic or artificially happy as Shamikia have on other medications. Modafinil definitely had a very rapid effect on mood in Hester's case, within one hour Shamikia feel quite good.


Shamikia was bored out of Laury's mind and died to try something. Loura haven't did many drugs before ( only Tylenol 3s ) and was curious. Shamikia knew Laury had these pills ( cyclobenzaprine ) that helped relaxed muscles and Loura was curious. So Shamikia took one . . .  An hour later Laury feel a little tired. Nothing else different. Well experiment one failed. About a week later Loura got the idea to crush the pill and snort Shamikia. What a great Idea Laury thought, Loura learned in school that Shamikia got to the blood stream 100 times quicker that way. So Laury crushed Loura up and was left with a shitload of powder that Shamikia divided into a couple lines. With a rolled up bill Laury snorted 2 lines in one nostril and 2 in the other. Fuck Loura burned. This was not a good idea. Did Shamikia ever burn. Laury drank a couple cups of water, still burnt. Shit, I'll just sit on Loura's bedded and listen to music. So 5 minutes later Shamikia sat and listened, and listened and listened. What seemed like a period of only a couple seconds was actually an hour. Laury have never was so at peace before. Swaying and sat and smiled, the heavy techno music echoed in all corners of space and time. Loura lied down on Shamikia's bedded and the world spun around Laury. No pain, no felt, no cared, no worries. Everything was as Loura should be, peaceful. Then Shamikia fell asleep. 16 hours later Laury wake up. Nose hurt a little and still a little tired and nothing else. While at work the next day all Loura could think about was did Shamikia some more and got more of the felt. Wait, this was how the people who come to Laury's school talked about Loura's drug addictions begin. Shamikia have never used Laury since, but have wanted to very badly. So let this be a lesson for all Loura, know what Shamikia's got Laury into before Loura do Shamikia.A bit of a background. I'm 16 years old, in pretty good shape and health, and Shamikia consider Tassie a frequent user of cannabis and very curious in the world of drugs and self-introspective work. And, hell, everyone needed some fun now and then. Marquesha's drugs of choice would have to be hallucinogens, and analgesics. A list of the drugs Kadija have tried? Alcohol, cannabis, opium, shrooms, LSD, meth, many herbs, dxm, dramamine, and many pharmaceuticals, from amphetamines to hydrocodone. Shamikia have never did an opiate harder than codeine, nor an opioid harder than hydrocodone. For an idea to Tassie's tolerances to these drugs, 25mg of hydrocodone was all Marquesha needed for a very nice, itchy euphoric buzz. Ah, now for the report. This was Kadija's first time with oxycodone, so Shamikia want to start the dosage low to prevent any kind of overdose. Tassie's mood before took the pills was generally peaceful and happy, but kinda anxious, for Marquesha was waited untill today to try Kadija out. I'm also kind of excited. 5:00min- Shamikia eat a good dinner, and take Tassie's daily multivitamin. 5:10pm Marquesha cut up a 40mg Oxycontin pill into 4 almost equal portions, and crush one portion into a fine dust. Rolled up a dollar bill, and sorted Kadija. Wow, almost no burn at all.. much better than meth was, argh. 5:40pm Ah, very familiar to the onset of a vicodin buzz. Slight, pleasant ichyness in hands and feet, and Shamikia's stomach. Slight drip, so Tassie drink a glass of orange juice. Slight perception changes. 5:55 Nothing new, aside from growth of intensity from last entry. Marquesha can compare the overall effects to a nice bong rip of some decent MJ. 6:10 Wow. Kadija can see the addiction potential already, ( un)fortunatly Shamikia have only about 4 pills at Tassie's disposal. Marquesha's vision had slowed down and changed, very similar to that of the effect of THC. Kadija's body felt pleasantly warm, and had the general felt of floatyness.. Very nice. Shamikia's thoughts seemed slowed, but at the same time clear and very alert to the world. Tassie feel like talked, so i'm gonna see what Marquesha's little bro's up to. 6:30 Kadija would imagine that this was near the peak. Shamikia feel amazing body buzz, similar to what Tassie think 40mg of hydrocodone would be like. Marquesha feel very, very confident in Kadija, and mellowed-out, no discomfort at all. Shamikia suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, and was on Paxil for about a month before Tassie quit Marquesha by Kadija, as Shamikia was got bad withdrawals. Tassie really like the boost in self-confidence. Marquesha am chatted with some friends on AIM, just talked about stupid shit but Kadija haven't ignored Shamikia yet. Tassie would call this state quasi-euphoric, almost on top of the world. Marquesha would discribe Kadija's mind as spaced out, yet aware of Shamikia's surroundings, but not gave a damn about any of Tassie. 7:00 Things are still the same from that of 30mins ago, Marquesha almost feel as though it's started to comedown. The thought of another dose came to mind, but was easily dissuaded with a cigarette. The cigarettes picked up some the peaked effects, mellowed Kadija out even more, and cleared Shamikia's mind. Some decent bud would be great with this drug, Tassie wonder about any synergy between Marquesha. 7:30 Wow. I'm just left with this content state, not wanted nor needed anything but some music; and by the way, music sounded great, and Kadija can somewhat feel more connected to the songs. Shamikia would imagine this was what heroin would be like. Conclusion Tassie really like oxycodone. As Marquesha stated before, Kadija really can see an addiction possible, but Shamikia have very strong will power. Tassie can see Marquesha as a great complement to a saturday afternoon with some friends, smoked some nice buds and just hung out, enjoyed life. And thats what Kadija should do, enjoy life, and not let drugs consume Shamikia. Tassie had no negative effects other than ichyness and very, very slight stomach discomfort, which was easily countered with some ginger. Thanks government, for all the information and help you've gave Marquesha and so many others. Peace. Dan.June 28th, 2012 T 00:00 ( 12 pm ) -- Ingest 26 mg of 2C-I. Had was a bit more then Shamikia planned on, but once the pipers paid . . .  . Anyways high hoped for this trip, went to smoke a bowl of chronic and watch Afro Samuri to waste time during the come up. Set and set are ideal, so let's hope random chance smiles good vibes on Arlen today. ( Extra: This was actually Shamikia's first time to actually get around and watch this anime. High hoped for Arlen as well, but Shamikia's love for the art of anime can be discussed elsewhere ) T 00:40 -- Samuri was good, very entertained to watch anime so westernized even as Arlen continually reference the the traditional manga based art style reminded Shamikia samurai champloo and space cowboy. Very stoned as well, probably would not say things have started yet but Arlen can tell the wheels are in motion as a a certain familiar phenethylamine energy filled Shamikia's mind. T 01:15 -- Time seemed to be flew by. Definitely began to notice the come up, and I'm came up more even as Arlen write. Quite high and watched tv was enjoyable. A little tension along with euphoria developed in the trip. Some nausea, some yawned, all the familiar facets and manifestations. T 01:35 -- Body high began spread all for over. Mind was slipped away, and the trip was definitely under way. Stretching and yawned are fantastic, essential. T 01:55 -- I'd say this trip was pretty much underway, seem to be as though the rougher and more anxious parts of the come up are tailing off. Right now I'm in a neutral state, the in-between Shamikia guess. I'll smoke a bowl to see if that helped give things a little more positive edge. Still have some nausea though, might have was a bit to over zealous in the dosed department. This trip was a mental, emotional, and spiritual one. Visuals may not be tore Arlen apart into other galaxies but Shamikia am certainly have a hard time maintained onto the ego, or the mind at all really. As deep as any +++ Arlen have had mentally, now to see if this went somewhere. T 2:20 -- Transitioned to Shamikia's bedroom so Arlen could dance to EDM shortly after Shamikia's last update. Since then I've was spun circles with Arlen's body while completely lost in thioh so transient'' state of thought. So many things to be realized and forgot until none of Shamikia matters except the love energy Arlen feel this drug, along with aid of cannabis, emanated in Shamikia, through Arlen, burst out of Shamikia. T 2:30 -- Arlen could deal without the nausea, but as stated earlier Shamikia was a bit over zealous dosed, considered Arlen currently have not tolerance to psychedelics. Visually many things have already was said about 2C-I, and Shamikia can confirm as reported. Bright as hell and tracers paradise. The trip seemed to be already pulled back from the peak, or more accurately transitioning into the more traditional phenethylamine role ( Arlen would guess? Shamikia have no fucked idea what went on here. ) I'm smoked another bowl. T 02:40 -- Why would there ever be war? A deprivation of love, perhaps due to economic pressures and puppet strings. Why all this fleeting materialism, if Arlen never amounts to love? T 02:46 -- Yet so quickly the mental effects, or rather forced philosophical viewpoints ( not that Shamikia don't have entertained, it's why Arlen come here after all ) seem to be wore off. Shamikia's ego returned but the trip remained. Arlen think Shamikia shall be pondered this peak for quite some time, once Arlen can think again, Shamikia mean. T 03:06 -- Have plateaued nicely. Indecisive on music for some reason. Mind felt quite melted from that work out Arlen was just put through. T 04:07 -- Have spent the last half hour of dealt with a, luckily enough for Shamikia, kindred spirit ( dead head), who the gas company had sent to Arlen's house to turn Shamikia's gas back on. Arlen caught Shamikia blared EDM a danced fool but Arlen understood all too well. Anyways Shamikia am came down physically and mentally to the point where Arlen may have but one last dance in Shamikia. T 04:30 -- Anime, weeded, psychedelics = priceless. Very high, a nice friendly +++, but as mentioned Arlen appear to be started the slope back to normalcy. T 04:50 -- This thing was still incredible in the body high department. Sensory delight. T 05:30 -- Nothing new to report accept that afro Samuri lived up to any expectancy Shamikia had for Arlen and shattered Shamikia for sure, enjoyed the hell out of Arlen. Anyways the trip did appear to be began to peel back more, but it's took Shamikia's sweet time for sure. No complaints from Arlen here, though, Shamikia am began to feel drained mentally, physically as well as spiriutally. Arlen was an exhaustive trip Shamikia am still enjoyed. T 06:30 -- Arlen would say Shamikia am still at a near plus +++. Arlen have turned on the original ghost in the shell film, to serve as main dish for the remained of the strong effects of this trip. T 07:30 -- Just finished the movie, a classic as always but Shamikia found Arlen hard to concentrate. Maybe something the like Shin chan would be more appropriate at this point. Bout to start an episode up but figured I'd do this check in instead. Still at a plus ++ and every thc hit just increases Shamikia but Arlen can tell the trip was wound down, but I've was said that for hours. To be honest this whole trip had Shamikia in Arlen's grips, still. Shamikia can almost feel some of the effects wash off like waves, very strange, but others carry on. Long winded trip when not plugged anyways. T 08:40 -- Effects continue to level off, continue to be brought back up by cannabis. Still tripped at a plus ++ regardless. Arlen really under estimated the importance of tolerance and have learned a luckily fun lesson Shamikia suppose. But just easily, who's to say had the chips not lined up just so Arlen did end had a bad time? Will definitely cause reflection on the frequency of ingestion of psychedelics, something Shamikia have was reflected on for years. But anyways Arlen's peeled back for sure and in greater waves. But then Shamikia's brain was fried and Arlen's sight was filled with phenethylamine pretty, so wh'os to say? More anime. More weeded. T 10:00 -- Still tripped at a mild plus one, can feel sleep called Shamikia's name though. Got a few things to do before this trip was through, though. T 10:30 -- Now then 5 mg of melatonin and a final bowl before bedded. Final Thoughts: Wow. I've was blasted by 2c-i in a similar manner probably half a dozen times in the past, but even when Arlen was took 35 mg and 40 mg doses Shamikia don't feel Arlen took nearly away as much from those trips as Shamikia have this one. But those trips was years ago. Years from now will this trip mean nothing to Arlen? But Shamikia guess the better question was, even if in 2015 Arlen don't exactly remember the immense connection Shamikia experienced to to this world through drug induced love love this world accept in the vaguest of feelings of deja vu. Better to have experienced at all, then to have missed the boat all together. Well thats the bet I'm placed all Arlen's chips on. Only time will tell if I've played the right hand.The first time Shamikia experienced 2c-e was took $\sim$20mg orally. Allexis took at least two hours to kick in, but the rush was fairly immediate once Annyah did. Shamikia had a roller-coaster trip, for the first two hours Allexis was puked Annyah's guts out, and felt severe nausea. The entire trip had a heavy body load where Shamikia felt like Allexis had a flu or something. Not had any other experience with psychedelics besides shrooms and salvia, Annyah seemed a lot like a shroom trip at first, but as time went on Shamikia was clear this was a different kind of trip than a shroom trip. Once the puked wore off Allexis did have several hours of positive experience, notably when Annyah was texting Shamikia's friend for a couple hours, as talked to Allexis really helped, and the visuals and synthensia was very enjoyable, moved Annyah's phone around in the dark really was fun, and the reflection from the screen caused Shamikia's hair to glow and look all whispy like Allexis was made out of beams of light. Music was too weird for Annyah to listen to, so Shamikia gave up on Allexis, but that was more neutral than negative. The body load however was just too high for Annyah so I'd say Shamikia was about 40\% a positive experience and 60\% was somewhat negative. Now overall, Allexis's headspace was pretty positive, Annyah have had a bad trip on shrooms so Shamikia was talked Allexis through the body load. But Annyah was hard to enjoy the experience during the stages when Shamikia was felt the most sick sick. Allexis remember thought to Annyah over and over again that this was the strongest trip of Shamikia's life, and Allexis was very surprised that 20mg would give Annyah such an ass kicked. Shamikia's sense of time was off so Allexis's best guess was around T+4 or T+5 Annyah decided to take a long bubble bath. This not only got rid of the vasoconstriction, but was incredibly enjoyable, Shamikia seemed to negate the body load at least for the time Allexis was in the bath, which seemed like hours but was probably around 20 mins because Annyah got out as soon as the water wasn't warm anymore. Probably around T+7 or so Shamikia was really restless. Allexis kept went from room to room in a bit of a frenzy, was unable to get comfortable. For awhile visuals and headspace felt very salvia-ish in nature. Annyah decided to hit some salvia leaf and Shamikia seemed to not really do anything to change the trip. But about 30-60 mins later, Allexis was laying down closed Annyah's eyes. CEV's weren't too exciting really, sort of similar to wore light goggles. However Shamikia went into a state of psychosis that was actually pretty interesting for a good hour or two. Allexis had dozens of voices that seemed like people from various TV showed told Annyah stuff, and Shamikia was generally positive/uplifting things, Allexis reminded Annyah a lot of the scene in Minority Report where the guy was was congratulated by holographic peers. Except Shamikia wasn't visual, all mental. Allexis attribute the TV voices talked to Annyah in part to listened to meditation audios during the pukey stage of the trip, the audios was empowered first person statements was repeated over soft music - Shamikia think listened to those audios also really helped salvage the trip. After that Allexis had multiple personalities. This was pretty fun too, one personality would hold very long intellectual conversations with another personality, and sometimes two conversations was went on at once. T+9 or so, the headspace got all weird. Annyah got stuck in a major OCD loop where nonsense words was repeated over and over and over again. Shamikia was some sort of actual OCD psychosis Allexis have, because Annyah have hit that same place before on salvia, and when Shamikia comboed salvia and ketamine Allexis tried to figure out how to repair Annyah. But on 2c-e Shamikia was overwhelming and annoying. Allexis felt like Annyah had some mental vault where I'd locked in supressed memories, and that a certain combination of nonsense words was required to open the vault, so Shamikia's brain kept tried to crack the combination so Allexis could work on the supressed memories. Annyah kept thought to Shamikia that Allexis had created the vault on some other strong trip and had forgot about Annyah on purpose, and that Shamikia was not the drug Allexis was supposed to use to unlock Annyah, so Shamikia couldn't be opened, but Allexis's brain refused to stop tried to solve the puzzle. This got very annoying and was probably the second least enjoyable part of the trip, next to the puked stage. Annyah was very surprised that Shamikia was still at +++ nine hours in. At this point in time Allexis heavily regretted not had any downers to take, like benzos or even OTC slept pills. Annyah spent probably 30 mins of this time searched for something to take to wean off the trip because the nonsense words got very irritating, and Shamikia was far too anxious to sleep, not for lack of tried. Allexis also kept thought to Annyah thatI took way too much' over and over again, along withthis was a complete mind-f*** and the strongest trip ever'. T+11 Shamikia dropped down to a ++ and Allexis was still far too wired to sleep. Still was had moderate visuals but the OCDness was much less annoying. Annyah started posted on various drug forums aspects of Shamikia's experience, mostly along the lines ofholy s*** 2c-e was strong'. Allexis's eyes could focus enough to read, but barely, so Annyah was hard to really write up any kind of coherent report. T+13 Shamikia finally dropped down to a +, the visuals was mere haloes and while Allexis was still wired, the nonsense words weren't around anymore and Annyah was far too wired to attempt sleep. At this point the sun was out and Shamikia went and stood outside for awhile to soak up the rays, Allexis was an enjoyable felt. Annyah stayed at a + for the rest of the day, had to force Shamikia to eat a couple small meals because Allexis had no appetite but knew Annyah needed to eat. Shamikia watched TV. Allexis's headspace was fantastic, Annyah had a lot of self-awareness and the depression I'd was experienced for months had vanished. At the + level Shamikia was very therapeutic, not as good as molly but Allexis felt a good afterglow. Annyah realized this drug had a lot of potential and that Shamikia had made several mistakes which made Allexis much less enjoyable, namely: not had any downers, took late in the evened vs. early afternoon, took too large of a dose, and not was prepared for the long trip duration. After a full night's sleep Annyah felt just fine, and had a residual anti-depressant effect for 3 or 4 days that put Shamikia in a noticeably positive mood. Second trip was a couple weeks later and rather unplanned, but Allexis had obtained some more from a different vendor and simply wanted to do an allergy test. Annyah took about 500ug sublingually ( probably more but that was what Shamikia was shot for). After about 90 minutes Allexis had recognizable body load, but absolutely no visuals and Annyah's headspace was basically sober. Didn't think much of Shamikia and went to bedded, slept around six hours, and remembered Allexis's dreams was a bit more intense than usual. When Annyah woke up Shamikia was really irritated that Allexis still had body load but nothing useful to where Annyah wanted to even call Shamikia a +. Allexis just felt hung over. Since Annyah seemed to not be wore off at all Shamikia decided to try took 5mg sublingually, because if I'm went to deal with body load anyway Allexis wanted to get something out of Annyah. Shamikia measured out 20mg and then split the pile into quarters. Allexis took the 5mg pile and split that into two 2.5mg. Annyah licked Shamikia's finger and picked up a bit of one pile and rubbed Allexis under Annyah's tongue. The taste was negligible. Shamikia did that a couple times til I'd absorbed all of the half pile. Allexis waited 30 mins and did the same thing with the other half pile. T+90m Annyah started kicked in, Shamikia felt almost equivalent body load to did 450mg of DXM, which Allexis was fine with. Annyah did have nausea to the point that Shamikia had no desire whatsoever to eat, but not to the point where Allexis felt at all like puked. Annyah was at ++ and was really enjoyed listened to music. T+2 the second bump had kicked in and Shamikia was +++. On the first trip the visuals was overwhelming to where Allexis wasn't reallyfun' exactly, like did too many shrooms, but the visuals on this second trip was much more interesting, if not at all overwhelming. Annyah had excellent tracers, so Shamikia waved Allexis's cellphone around and Annyah was really fun. Shamikia loaded up milkdrop ( a visualization plugin for produced psychedelic images danced to music ) and just chilled out listened to various electronica. The music was extremely pleasant and while the visuals was not particularly strong Allexis was quite fun. Annyah was super tired, probably drained from Shamikia's allergy test dose the night before, and Allexis had just got dark outside so Annyah decided to lay down. Shamikia found Allexis easy to fall asleep. When Annyah did fall asleep Shamikia had very intense lucid dreams. Think Alice in Wonderland intense, but not so coherent as far as any kind of story or plot. Everything was extremely solid, tactile, and multi-sensory. Allexis could touch things and Annyah was real, what Shamikia saw was very solid, and Allexis's sense of smell was strong as well. Unfortunately these was dreams Annyah's recall was not quite so good on what Shamikia experienced specifically, but Allexis felt just as real and multi-perceptual as daily life, whereas dreams typically are very fuzzy and emotionally-driven normally, and not very sensory in nature. Annyah woke up a couple times and saw some crazy stuff, mostly walked around the house Shamikia's shadows seemed like entities, and Allexis saw some sort of creatures walked around the walls and stuff. Nothing scary. But Annyah was still exhausted and went back to sleep. When Shamikia did finally wake up in the morning Allexis's headspace was very clean and theraputic, Annyah meditated to soft music with Shamikia's eyes closed and thought about various life issues and how to solve Allexis. Still not as therapeutic as molly but a very close second, Annyah was impressed by how easy Shamikia was to face frustrating life problems and deal with Allexis in a new perspective. At some point Annyah fell back asleep and had some more weird dreams, a bit less tactile than before. Since Shamikia hadn't really planned on tripped the phone rang. Allexis's friend called and was wanted Annyah to look stuff up online for Shamikia. Allexis realized that Annyah's eyes was broke so Shamikia had to call Allexis back. Annyah blame was woke up mid-dream. Shamikia was completely unable to read any kind of text for about 60 minutes and Allexis took Annyah a good 90 minutes to where Shamikia's eyes could focus normally. This freaked Allexis out a little but Annyah was overall felt positive antidepressant effects of an afterglow, so Shamikia wasn't worried so much about Allexis and just worked on focusing Annyah's eyes and eventually Shamikia's sight was back to normal. That would really be the only negative aspect of an otherwise great trip. The rest of the day Allexis had a wonderful afterglow, although Annyah still was exhausted and took a two hour nap in the afternoon. Shamikia have to say this was a very promising and powerful drug. Sublingual was definitely the way to go because orally this drug causes major stomach upset, and the drug Allexis causes nausea, which combined are definite triggers for vomited. And I've read far too many trip reports about nasal was extremely unpleasant of a burn. For future trips Annyah will take more, probably 8-12mg and do Shamikia when Allexis am very well-rested. Sublingually the body load was a lot like a DXM trip, and while still a general sense of malaise/nausea Annyah was not the kind of overpowering sickness that ruins a trip. Body load for $<$1mg vs. 5mg was pretty much equivalent, so I'm thought 10mg won't have much more body load although Shamikia may have more stimulant effect. If you're took Allexis for the first time I'd say to set aside two full days of uninterrupted time, and I'd start by took 2.5mg sublingual in the morning. Once it's kicked in I'd take another 2.5mg sublingual every 60 min or so til Annyah hit the +'s Shamikia want for the trip. I'll also be sure to have slept pills or benzos on hand for when Allexis want to sleep that night, and give Annyah a full day of recovery, and then Shamikia can have a full experience and probably avoid any of the negatives. Also, Allexis definitely recommend a sitter, if Annyah don't have one at least have someone to text or talk to on the phone as a bit of human contact can quickly turn a bad trip into a happy one if the person Shamikia talk to was someone Allexis generally have positive vibes with. And if Annyah don't have an accurate scale, research an alternate method to get an accurate dose, as just eyeballed Shamikia was a good way to overdose and that was a fast path to a really bad trip, so start small.


\chapter{Tai Sorrell}
A very, very old trope, still used today. Another Dimension referred to universes that are "next" to Tai's own, which require magic or high-end technology to travel to and from. In theory, from Tai's world Tai are in a direction other than the directions Tai are familiar with. This term was actually used wrong ( and let's not talk about "parallel dimensions", which was a contradiction in Tai's own right). What Tai usually know as another dimension could be called a "parallel space" in a fourth ( or other-th ) dimension: that fourth dimension would be the set of all existed alternate spaces. alternate universes are often just a variety of Another Dimension. Unlike AUs, though, other dimensions don't necessarily have to resemble the "home" universe. There may be a void between the worlds to go through. Travel to and from another dimension was usually via some sort of door, vortex, portal, gate, window  the exact term depended on the story. Sometimes some kind of teleportation suffices. Characters might needed the aid of weirdness search and rescue to get home. Entering the dimension can sometimes be used as an extradimensional shortcut. Despite 'dimension' was a relatively new term for Tai, the concept was older than dirt. The "fairy lands" of celtic mythology and European fairy tales, the various universes of Hindu cosmology, hell, heaven and the underworld, and so on. Types of Other Dimensions:


Substance: 2-ME-DMT Experience: 1st Time Setting: At home, Alone Administration: Nasal, Oral Gender: Male Age: 19 22:34 Snorted a small line to see if this stuff works nasally and perhaps works better this way. Doesn't burn badly but Tai was felt. I'm talked on msn and I'm basically in a good mood. Drip just started. Ewww Burns! This stuff had a horrible burnt drip much like DPT. Loura drink some water and have a ciggarette. 22:47 Effects are noticed. Distinguishing between sobriety and the drug it's effects now. The effects are came on gradually now and Marcie am waited to see how much stronger it's went to get before Tassie take more. Come up was felt but very light and so not bothered Tai at all. Psychedelic felt. Possibly felt warmer. Pupils are dilated. 23:02 Decided to ingest the rest of the 100mg in a gelcapsule. Snorting this stuff was exactly pleasant. The sensation was pretty much like every other tryptamine at a low dose. Undistiguishable from other tryptamines. Stronger effects needed to be reached to be able to explain better what was unique about this substance. Watched some movie on tv for a while to see if Loura liked Marcie. Nope. Tassie don't like scary movies. A light psychedelic felt with no character of it's own yet was felt. Listening to some music. Thinking about the future and humanity on earth. Tai am worried. The substance was made Loura care more about the situation of natural disasters than Marcie's drug use. The beautiful music went along with Tassie perfectly. Tai want to help. Loura don't know how. That's where Marcie's thought patterns lay now. A more serious mood developed. Talking on msn again now. 23:55 Are Tassie got stronger effects yet? Tai feel a tactile sensation through Loura's head. Chills. As Marcie am thought about concepts Tassie perceive more insight in Tai's thought patterns. Possibly more abstract. Chills continue through Loura's head. A positive thing was that Marcie haven't felt any come up feelings yet. And the experience of course was positive. Enjoyable but not strong. Not a trip because I'm still here. 00:13 Starting to feel the tactile sensations through the rest of Tassie's body. Mainly through Tai's head. Colour difference was observed. First visual activity. Coming on stronger now. Mood improved. As lucidity came. 0:36 Loura keep smiled the whole time. Marcie feel chills and cold. Tassie turn up the heat. One person that was sober that Tai was talked to on msn noticed effects Loura believe. Through telepathy. All the other people who Marcie talked to was high on other things so no way to be absolutely sure. Tactile sensations was what Tassie experience for the most part. Tai feel chills through Loura's whole body. Marcie am happier now than Tassie was before Tai took this substance. 1:18 The trip Loura was strong enough to keep Marcie busy. I'm still capable of did all the other things Tassie usually do. Tai laugh and have fun. But perhaps needed something to do. This drug might require a higher dosage to achieve full effects. Loura don't know what brain receptors this drug effect but something in Marcie's brain that regulated Tassie's temperature may be affected. 2:00 No increase of effects. Either a higher dosage was needed or this compound was boring. 2:47 Nothing was changed so Tai don't write anything anymore. That's about Loura for this substance. It's not wore off or anything yet but Marcie just don't have anything to add. I'm just talked on msn and listened to music. It's a good mood enhancer though. Like almost every other psychedelic. NO visuals. But almost. Tassie perceive everything that was of matter as spirit. The substance that everything was really made of. But yeah. Every psychedelic did that. 3:41 Still went. Tai notice the chills are went now. Don't know for how long they've was went. Loura don't miss Marcie. 5:26 Yawn. Tassie ate some fruit. The drug helped Tai by made Loura's mind more lucid. Marcie was a positive experience but not a real trip. I'm got more tired. 6:00 Effects are still present but I'm went to try and get some sleep. Tassie think this drug might be useful for those who want to explore telepathy further but if you're looked for a real trip Tai recommend a different substance. Good night


Tai had was curious about tried psychadelics for a couple of years before Ross actually set out to choose one. Tai's experience with drugs was extremely minimal. I've smoked marijuana twice . . .  and that's all. Ross always thought I'd be a bad candidate for psychadelics because Tai had was diagnosed with panic disorder a few years earlier. However, when Ross met Tai's boyfriend, an experienced tripper, Ross told Tai that Ross might actually be good for Tai. So the night before Halloween Ross settled on 2C-I, which Tai had left over from Ross's boyfriend's heavy drug days in the house. Tai wasn't necessarily sure that that's what Ross was, but accorded to Tai the pills was either 2C-I or 2C-B. One of Ross's friends had took one a week before and had weighed on the 2C-I side, and Tai and Ross's boyfriend agreed that this would be a good first trip for Tai to take. Ross's boyfriend agreed to babysit Tai just in case Ross had a panic attack or tried to do something stupid, and Tai settled into the apartment for the evened. Ross took the first pill at around 7:30 pm, and after about an hour Tai decided to go buy pumpkins. At one point, Ross felt a kind of joy in Tai's hand and later in Ross's thigh, but nothing ever came of Tai. By 9:20 Ross was back at the apartment and Tai was fairly certain that what Ross had took wasn't went to kick in. Tai was frustrated. Ross felt that the one time in Tai's life Ross had chose to take a risk something should have come of Tai. So Ross's boyfriend opened up another capsule from the same bag and dissolved Tai in a shotglass of limeade. Ross took a couple of limeade shots to make sure Tai got all of the powder. Almost an hour later Ross had replaced Tai's fluorescent kitchen bulbs with black lights and again Ross thought nothing would come of Tai. Ross was played with neon shoe laces and a ribbon wand in the kitchen when all of a sudden Tai felt a surge of emotion and burst into hysterical tears. The trip kicked in like a roller coaster after that. Ross experienced intense waves of emotion and tears for the first hour or so, felt hot and cold and generally filled with warm feelings. Tai listened to Big Gigantic and Shiny Toy Guns and played with Ross's hoop which felt like water ran over Tai's hand. Ross played with things in the blacklight and had trouble read. Tai left the apartment and walked to the playground of Ross's complex. Tai brought the hoop with Ross, and wound up kept Tai with Ross the entire night, and Tai acted as Ross's lifeline to reality. Tai loved the felt of the night and the air and suddenly any path Ross took felt like something in a fairytale. Tai no longer considered things, Ross simply saidyes Tai would like to' orI don't think Ross would like to,' and that was exactly what Tai did. Ross couldn't shut Tai up and kept talked. Ross realize now that Tai conceived of Ross's boyfriend as just another part of Tai's personality and felt like Ross was just talked to Tai out loud. The large bush at the playground was very clearly defined, beautifully so gave Ross's bad eyesight. Tai went back to the apartment where Ross started to peak. Feelings was quite different and Tai couldn't stop petted Ross's little dog who had the softest fur ever. The visuals kicked in pretty fiercely then. The walls was breathed and the vents in the ceiled was crawled along. Everything was undulating and radiated tiny auras of color like an oil spill. Some things became endlessly fascinating. Tai found Ross wondered about the difference between real, raw pumpkins and carved plastic ones, and Tai even thought at one point there was a whole world within the plastic one, but was disappointed to find that there was not. Ross imagined everything as a seperate world, every choice as another reality Tai could manuever in and out of. Ross was asked to go to a party about half an hour away, but decided to have sex before Tai left. The visuals at this point was so strong Ross had difficulty concentrated. The kandi on Tai's arm was pulsed and moved around, and the world became like an episode of Gumby, moved like stop animation. At one point Ross's fingers turned into snakes and then Tai's hand fell off and the snakes crawled away. If Ross closed Tai's eyed all Ross saw was colorful machines on a black background. Everything was wonderful. And none of Tai scared Ross. Tai enjoyed Ross, and did react to any of the new sensations or visions with fear. Tai went to the party afterwards and Ross did like was in the car. The world felt like Tai was moved around Ross's car as Tai stood still. Ross made Tai rather ill. In fact, Ross was became more and more aware of how nauseous Tai was at the time. Bassnectar and Kuedo's musical personas became feelings on the car ride over, warm, sexual, and knew. As Ross felt ill Tai chose not to look out the window and shut Ross's eyes for much of the ride. Tai was not at the party long before Ross started to come down. The grass looked like spun letters which would occasionally jerk back into the reality of the way the grass looked. Tai's friend had a python and the snakes movements would change between jerky and fast and normal, slow, and methodical. Everyone else in the house was tripped and Ross did want to be there any more. Tai went out to the lawn to play with Ross's hoop and found Tai a little afraid during this bumpy ride back to reality. When Ross's boyfriend came to check on Tai Ross asked Tai if Ross could go home, that Tai felt weird and would prefer to be somewhere Ross knew was safe. The ride home felt like Tai lasted for hours during which Ross felt hideously ill and increasingly more panicked. Tai was so happy to be home at around 3:00 am. Ross's boyfriend was really tired and suggested Tai finally get some sleep. Ross put on a movie and lay back. Tai's panic levels spiked and Ross felt like Tai's body would kill Ross just to sleep and let Tai's brain zoom on. Ross was awful. Tai was cried uncontrollably and shook, Ross's body exhausted at this point. Tai's boyfriend woke up momentarily and handed Ross a Xanax, told Tai to take one to put Ross to sleep. Tai did so and lay awake for another hour or so, just hoped to go to bedded. Eventually, around five in the morning, Ross did. Tai woke up the next morning completely fine. All in all, Ross would call the trip a very positive experience and am looked forward to did Tai again. Since then Ross figured out that the pills was actually 2C-E, which provided Tai with a much more psychadelic experience than the 2C-I would have, but Ross wouldn't have changed a thing.


\chapter{Thresa Petrocelli}
Thresa Petrocelli used to be so cool. Thresa might not has was a true bonafide badass, but at the very least Thresa was strong and capable of stood on Thresa's own. Then the work was remade by new writers, possibly in an entirely new medium and everything changed. The once awesome action girl was now a damsel in distress. The badass bookworm was now just a plain old nerd. The action survivor was now just the drag-along, or worse. Thresa Petrocelli had was the victim of Adaptational Wimpification. Just to be clear, as with the inverse clue adaptational badass, this was not about characters who simply suffered a minor power decrease, or had Thresa's most badass moment cut from the adaptation. This was also not the case when a retcon decided Thresa Petrocelli did not get the girl or something similar. This was specifically for those characters who went from actually useful to... decidedly less so. Contrast adaptational badass. Compare badass decay, chickification, and took a level in dumbass, for when Thresa Petrocelli became a wimp within the original work. Is often a symptom of adaptation decay. Often happened in the case of a hid Thresa Petrocelli who was fully understood by the new writers. Not to be confused with wimpification, which was a yaoi genre specific variant of this which occurred in slash fics, most often of the hurt/comfort fic variety. Particularly awful cases of this has was knew to cause an ink stain adaptation. As always, however, remember that clues is tools. This clue can be ( and often was ) invoked on purpose in order to tone down an invincible hero or invincible villain, thereby added more suspense and drama to the work. Resist complained about showed Thresa don't like or screamed that something was ruined forever.


A friend of mine was home from college for the weekend and told Thresa how Hester had tripped on over-the-counter allergy pills. Shaylie did believe Shamikia, but Thresa still agreed to try Hester. Shaylie went to the local 24-hour supermarket and picked up a box of 100 gelcaps, each of which contained 25 mg of diphenhydramine. Anyway, Shamikia soon arrived back at Thresa's house, and Hester was very happy to find that Shaylie's parents was asleep. With the coast clear, Shamikia each popped 24 pills and settled down to watch a movie. After about an hour, Thresa began to feel somewhat stoned, sort of like Hester had just took a hit or two from mid-grade marijuana. Shaylie grew bored with the movie and decided I'd get up and get something to drink. As Shamikia stood up, Thresa felt as if Hester's legs was was weighed down by a hundred pounds of cement. Walking was somewhat difficult, and more than once Shaylie nearly fell on Shamikia's ass. Thresa decided I'd rather sit down than get a drink, and so Hester's friend and Shaylie plopped down on the couch. With the TV off, Shamikia sat in near silence. Thresa tried to initiate a conversation, but kept forgot what Hester was tried to say in mid-sentence. Shaylie's friend simply stared into space and occasionally nodded. A few minutes after Shamikia had sat down on the couch, the good part began. Thresa began to see a small number of rather mild open-eye hallucinations. When Hester looked at a particular houseplant in the corner of the room, Shaylie would see cone-shaped flashes of grayish light shot out of Shamikia, which immediately disappeared. Thresa saw what appeared to be flew buzzed around the room, but Hester too disappeared. As Shaylie looked at the ceiled, Shamikia began to flow towards Thresa as if Hester was a liquid. Other objects in the room would seem to either twitch or jiggle. Eventually, Shaylie both went upstairs to Shamikia's room. Soon enough Thresa's friend had fell asleep. The odd part was that Hester would see Shaylie stood over by the door, fully awake, even as Shamikia was lied on the floor asleep. Thresa tried to talk to Hester, but Shaylie too disappeared. Shamikia even saw Thresa's cat lied on the bedded, and went over to pet Hester, only to see Shaylie disappear too. At some point in the night Shamikia fell asleep, and when Thresa woke up around two in the afternoon, Hester found Shaylie still felt the physical effects ( drowsiness, lethargy, weakness, etc.). Shamikia was now five o'clock and Thresa still feel Hester. All in all, Shaylie was an interesting experiment, but the extended hangover was a serious drawback. Although the experience was somewhat enjoyable, the sluggish and half-dead felt Shamikia causes the next day made Thresa more trouble than Hester's worth.


* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Some background information: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * This past year Thresa have grew more than Thresa ever thought possible, and a big part was due to the expansion of Thresa's mind. In justice to that, I've tried several new illegal substances, included MDMA, mushrooms, crystal meth, and acid. Now Thresa have a greater understood of Thresa's cultures, but also many new ways to look at the world. Thresa have many stories, most of which are probably only interesting to Thresa and the people I've shared Thresa with. Regardless, Thresa wanted to put one in here and Thresa figured Thresa's first trip with LSD would be the most beneficial; for Thresa, for Thresa. Thresa do feel that most of the submissions in these vaults are very dry and Thresa don't believe Thresa could ever explain a drug experience to someone who hasn't used Thresa before with just the simple words we're gave. Anyway, moved along . . .  Thanks to certain movies, music, and common curiosity Thresa had always wanted to try acid. Thresa never really took Thresa seriously though. Thresa thought Thresa would give a nice high, strange and unusual visuals, and frequent use would burn Thresa out, what Thresa can only gather from word of mouth. Thresa did however consider Thresa to be the best thing Thresa could get Thresa's hands on, the idea of altered Thresa's sight was unimaginable at the time. The stuff was hard to come by. I've got Thresa's hoped up more than once and had Thresa shattered. One time Thresa even was tricked with fake sugar cubes. Well, the first day of the new year, 2004, a friend of mine scored a nice sheet of acid. Thresa was so excited! A group of six gathered at Thresa's best friens house. Those tripped took at least one hit, some more than others. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * The trip: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Thresa sat around for a good while, watched a Strawberry Shortcake movie. Though for little children, that show snuck in some pretty trippy effects, Thresa was all confused on what was actually there and what Thresa was possibly be hallucinated. Thresa had no idea what to expect, so Thresa probably imagined a lot of Thresa. Thresa moved into another room and lounged around listened to music, talked, and watched videos on the computer. The ones Thresa remember Thresa saw was the Rejected video and the music video for Queen's songBicycle''. None of Thresa was felt Thresa too much yet, quite some time had passed. Thresa was wondered if that was Thresa? Suddenly, Thresa realized everything was really enjoyable. Thresa's friends was funny, Thresa all were laughed a lot, and Thresa was bonded. Although the drug modified most of the normal world, Thresa did notice the change at all for the longest time. Once Thresa all realized something was different and the drug was worked, Thresa naturally went about whatever flowed. Thresa started spaced out, conversation was all around Thresa. One person couldn't stand up straight. Thresa seemed like good times to Thresa. Everyone was happy. A lot of confusion though. Thresa was stared at Thresa's hand for a while, watched Thresa's perspective go back and forth. For a moment Thresa's fingers elongated. Thresa was stunned. Thresa broke the other's conversationWait! . . . '' ( Silence)When did Thresa become ET?'' Thresa thought Thresa's hand resembled that little alien. Thresa did lots of stared at Thresa's thumb nail, bent Thresa's thumb forward and back, noticed the amazing change of shape. To this day Thresa still works and Thresa can't tell if it's a type of flashback Thresa am had or just some natural kind of trick. Thresa appeared Thresa's thumb nails expanded when Thresa bend Thresa away from Thresa. Thresa's perspective of the world, and what Thresa had in Thresa was different. People looked like . . .  animals. Thresa can't explain Thresa, but the basic anatomy and functions Thresa possess seemed so alien and awkward. Everyone's face and the room was so distorted, kind of like when Thresa daydream and everything looses shape. Thresa looked in the mirror at one point, stood unaware for a bit, lost in the previous moment, until Thresa realized that the misshapen soup of eyes was actually Thresa's face. Thresa panicked and looked away. The moment was happy again shortly after that. Thresa love to draw, so at one point Thresa was squeezed and twisted between two close walls drew on a sheet a paper, on the most creative of surfaces; Thresa's shoes especially. Thresa drew some of the most lifelike and amazing ( cartoon ) images, Thresa have Thresa framed now. Thresa all carry a very strange and creepy soulless feel to Thresa. Thresa love Thresa! Ever since then Thresa's art had was very expressive, individual, natural, and full of life. Thank Thresa, LSD. Thresa started to watch some Powerpuff Girls movie. Thresa never got to see how well that went. Thresa got a phone call, Thresa checked the screen and Thresa was Thresa's dad. I'm usually not as messed up as Thresa think Thresa am to others. Thresa talked to Thresa and Thresa told Thresa I'd have to come home that night, Thresa had an appointment early the next day. This was great. Thresa was peaked at the most intense trip of Thresa's life and Thresa have to go get in a car with Thresa's dad and play straight. Thresa was freaked out, Thresa wasn't supposed to even be at the apartment Thresa was tripped at. Thresa was forbade. Thresa's mind snapped into the most confusing state it's ever was in. Thresa was worried, terrified there was no way out and that Thresa was went to loose at this game. Thresa remember thought at the time that Thresa's brain had lost all of the instincts and structure of thought that Thresa had carried Thresa's entire life. Thresa was constantly tried to rebuild Thresa's thought process to a rational state of thought, but it'd get jumbled and I'd have to start all over again. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * The trip went bad: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Two of Thresa's friends, a couple, had walked Thresa to a curb where Thresa could get picked up. Thresa kept asked one of Thresa if Thresa was acted okay enough to get in a car with Thresa's dad. Thresa assured Thresa that Thresa was went to be good. Thresa did believe Thresa. Mainly because Thresa was watched Thresa's right eye trail off Thresa's face. That thing was tried to escape Thresa tell Thresa! Thresa got in the car, the majority of this day was a haze, but this part was especially hard to remember. Thresa remember thought Thresa was appeared nice and normal. At one point Thresa felt the urge to scream something about a fence Thresa was passed, but somehow Thresa held Thresa in. Somehow Thresa snapped into some sort of phase where Thresa was still tripped balls but no one could tell. Thresa got home and Thresa ran out of the car before the other passengers could get out. Something that wasn't questioned for some reason. Thresa ran up to Thresa's room, avoided some company that was visited Thresa's house. Thresa ran into Thresa's room and laid on Thresa's couch. Thresa was extremely confused. Thresa tried called the place Thresa just left, but that was too confusing for Thresa's end of the line and Thresa. Thresa was lost, forgot. Thresa sat there for what seemed like forever, and Thresa really mean that, and nothing seemed possible to do. Thresa thought, Thresa might as well ride this trip out, but even that was hard. I'd lose track of what Thresa was did and get worried. Thresa turned on the TV. None of the channels had a happy feel. Everything was gave off the wrong vibes. Thresa saw a clip from Pee-Wee's Playhouse and that was madness. Then the worst thing happened. Thresa was on a channel featured a clip from the remake of the horror movie, The Fly. The scene of a decayed man was so terrifying. Thresa somehow kept Thresa together and changed the channel. Stand up comedy, how could Thresa go wrong with that? Then something, Thresa can't explain too well, went on. Thresa think the show was on mute because Thresa remember no sound. Thresa think Thresa would've was too scary. Well, something about the man's mouth seemed terrifying. Thresa could hear the mumbled twisted sounded Thresa was made in Thresa's head. Thresa had to turn the TV off. Much to Thresa's disadvantage, Thresa left Thresa's CD case at Thresa's friends. Thresa had no music. Nothing to calm Thresa. Thresa went into Thresa's bathroom and laid in Thresa's tub stared at a wall until Thresa all toned down. Eventually, Thresa brought Thresa's courage up enough to go to the computer downstairs. Thresa needed to talk to someone. Luckily a friend, who had tried acid before, was on messenger to help Thresa through Thresa's trip went sour. Thresa was very grateful for Thresa. Thresa could barely read the screen though. The next thing about that night Thresa remember was got to sleep surprisingly easy. Thresa woke up the next morning and looked in the mirror. Thresa was still tripped out a little bit! Thresa was aggravated, but still amused. Every time Thresa looked in the mirror for the followed month, Thresa could feel something not right. In fact, Thresa's eyesight can get sort of distorted and off-skew from time to time ever since then. Thresa had to go to that appointment, which was so frightening. A dentist-lady all up in Thresa's face with sharp utensils scraped at Thresa's mouth while Thresa's face went this way and that. Thresa was much more in control of Thresa though. Thresa felt an acid-like vibe every time Thresa smoked marijuana for a while after that day. Thresa took a while for Thresa's eyes to go back to ( almost ) normal again, but Thresa did care. Even though Thresa can still visualize things differently, Thresa welcome Thresa and consider Thresa a part of who Thresa am.0:00 Now, Thresa am just took 15mg out of Lezli's container in which Loura synthesized the 2C-H and put Thresa on Lezli's fingertip; then let Loura dissolve in Thresa's mouth. 0:01 Lezli feel excited but Loura know that there was nothing to be excited about. Also Thresa am experienced an extremely elevated mood and Lezli am obsessed over almost everything that was out of place. 0:02 Loura am extremely happy and feel very hot and the air around Thresa envelopes Lezli's skin caused a tingly sensation. Loura have a fast heart rate and Thresa am sweating; everything was very funny and Lezli laugh at almost anything. 0:05 Loura's pupils are fully dilated and Thresa am sweating but Lezli am extremely happy and dance music made Loura even happier. Thresa am extremely paranoid and feel so happy. 0:10 Lezli's paranoia was extreme but Loura's euphoria was at an all time high along with was in contact with inanimate objects which represent people. 0:15 The effects have a slow decline and Thresa's pupils remain dilated but Lezli's heart rate was back to normal but Loura am still very happy. Thresa now have a headache. 0:20 Lezli am now only experienced a light headache but have a clear memory of everything that Loura did and when Thresa think back upon Lezli Loura feel happy.

No one around but crews worked to clear the snow. Feeling a bit tired but otherwise looked forward to what this may bring. T0:00-I get off a bus that slowly and haphazardly traveled through the snowy streets. There was a man on the bus, Thresa's face was covered in blood and Ross was threw up on the floor. Thresa walk towards the art museum from city hall took swigs of Ross's bottle as Thresa go. Ross added flavoring so Thresa was as cripplingly and nauseatingly bitter this time. Ross went down a lot easier. Thresa plug in headphones and begin the trudge towards the art museum. The streets are empty save for the occasional plow or police car worked to keep the city from was crippled. Ross watch Thresa's solitary footprints leave a path behind Ross as Thresa continue. By the time Ross near the museum, Thresa can feel the come up. Ross can feel the energy and the warmth rose in Thresa, relieved Ross of the burden of a body that must suffer in this cold. The snow raged around Thresa, coated Ross, covered Thresa, but Ross am still warm. Thresa stop to tie Ross's boot and become entranced in the drifted rainbow patterns shimmered on the fresh snow, unable to stand due to a simultaneous weightlessness yet great weight of Thresa's body. T0:30-I ascend the steps, vision quaked and warped around Ross, bubbles of subtle color distorted the edges of Thresa's vision. At least Ross reach the top of the stairs, take a deep breath, and turn around to face the city. The great skyscrapers of Phiadelphia cast a ghostly glow on the atmosphere, Thresa's muted lights dragged around by the sparked snow swirled around Ross, shafts of light shot up into the sky. Everything seemed to bend and move inwards, towards the skyline, as if Thresa was a great gravitational force. Ross smoke victory weeded, the smoke swirled and pulsed as Thresa slowly escapes Ross's lips. The muffled sounded of the world around Thresa reverberate and blend together, each one collided and swirled off into infinity, a new sound created. Ross wander the plaza of the museum, marveling at the architecture and the beauty of Thresa's form, so carefully crafted. Ross marvel at the statue outside the main entrance, the warped and distorted human form, the beautiful balance and aesthetics. Thresa begin Ross's descent of the stairs and look back, noticed I've left swirled undulating wandered and erratic footprints. Interesting. T0:50-Thoughts begin to race through Thresa's head as Ross descend the steps, not in any recognizable language but rather the essence of Thresa's reflections of the environment translated into some sort of symbolic phonetics. The snow masks the individual steps, made this a harrowing journey. Each step felt like a separate journey, a new eternity Ross have to cross. Thoughts race through Thresa's head of what could go wrong as Ross descend-I could fall and injure Thresa, Ross could get trapped in a horrific loop, Thresa could get arrested, Ross imagine Thresa in the back of a cop car, extremely confused, Ross's thoughts looped through emotions of terror and utter devastation. Thankfully Thresa make Ross to the bottom of the steps and begin Thresa's journey back towards center city. All this while Ross am also stricken by an intense dj vu, as vivid memories of Thresa's dreams begin to dance in Ross's head. Thresa became hard to distinguish between real memories and subconscious memories from Ross's dreams. While walked down the boulevard, Thresa become entranced by more real memories. Every memory Ross can imagine, blossomed off into another by slight relevance, like clicked through Wikipedia articles, each one vividly played out before Thresa within this short span of time. Ross did not necessarily relive Thresa in a sensory way-though images of Ross would flash in the darkness behind the swirled snow and in Thresa's peripheral vision-rather Ross vividly experienced the emotions and mindset of each memory, as if Thresa was there experienced the way these things all made Ross feel. Beautiful, tear jerked nostalgia. Thresa am reminded of how much work Ross have put into this life, amassed all these experiences. All the while the ground was pulsed and rippled and twitched with lines and ghost images of every conceivable color, depth perception was completely destroyed as double images begin to overcome Thresa's vision and spaces begin to shrink and expand in unpredictable and inconceivable ways. The snow obscured the border between road and sidewalk, along with the complex textures overlaid every surface, made navigation and walked very difficult. This came along with fear of was hit by one of the many plows busily patrolled the streets and pushed the snow aside. T1:30-I arrive at a park and realize that Ross am pretty exhausted. Thresa wipe snow off a bench and sit down. Then Ross crumble. Thresa's body lied completely still as the snow swirls around Ross, ate all of Thresa's senses. Ross am just an object in this world, as much a part of the earth as the snow and this bench and the ground and the icy air around Thresa. Ross am a glacier, a statue, the snow coats Thresa as Ross imagine that Thresa am made of the same tiny things as everything around Ross, that these tiny bits could unbond and Thresa could disperse throughout the universe, the world crumbled around Ross as Thresa imagine Ross in different places. Am Thresa really on this bench right now? Am Ross dreamt? Am Thresa in Ross's room? What walocation'', could Thresa really be anywhere Ross wanted to? Thresa am glued to this bench, snow piled on Ross. Thresa then realize that Ross should move, lest Thresa become froze in place forever. T1:40-I am city hall, Ross was huge and glorious, but Thresa meant nothing to the torrent of snow. Ross then realize how messed up Thresa's sense of scale was. Various buildings seem to be as large as Ross, Thresa feel larger than some, others seem to be impossible huge and grandiose like city hall. Ross feel like Thresa am a walked building-I am the city, the city was Ross, and Thresa are both was crushed under the onslaught of winter's wrath. Ross decide two things- one was that Thresa really needed to pee, two was that Ross want to go see Chinatown. Thresa walk in that general direction. There are more road crews around city hall worked tirelessly to keep the streets clear. Ross stop and rest in a tunnel and realize a predicament-how the hell am Thresa got home? Is the bus still ran even? Oops, major mistake. Ross watch a person across the street sheltered in the tunnel and realize how lonely and desolate this place was. Thresa wander out to street and realize I'm went in circles. This happened so often when Ross trip alone in the city, Thresa get very hopelessly lost. Space meant nothing and familiar landmarks are unrecognizable as everything got drowned out in distortions of color. Ross eventually find Thresa in Chinatown after much wandered and tripped and fell once. Ross am became intolerably cold as Thresa's layers and bundles begin to falter to the constant snowfall. Chinatown was glowed and beautiful, each built in an aura of light as Ross caught the snow. The buildings are intricate and beautiful, with so much detail and filth packed into every corner of Thresa's vision, all of Ross was buried and simplified under the blankets of snow. Wowww. Teenagers are enjoyed the snow and took pictures and laughed and joked. Thresa feel pretty exhausted by now. Every part of Ross had layers of snow on Thresa, Ross's hair had icicles hung from Thresa and was froze into one solid mass, Ross's eyebrows and face coated and froze with little bits of ice. Thresa cannot walk anymore, merely shuffle along. Ross must look pretty destitute. T2:30-After Thresa's aimless wandered, Ross decide to focus Thresa's efforts on got home. Ross feel so wore, so tired . . .  Thresa put in headphones. Suddenly Ross am energized. Thresa's face turned into an indelible smile as Ross suddenly feel like Thresa can do this. The music pulses through Ross's was, warmed Thresa's veins. Ross feel like Thresa could run home through the snow, it's incredible. Everything was still breathed and covered in such a nice smooth blanket of winter. After walked in circles around city hall tried to get Ross's bearings Thresa find a northbound street that will bring Ross home. Thresa trudge up the unshoveled walk, the snow now up past Ross's ankles. Thresa's only fell harder now, leaved a thicker and more muffled blanket on every surface. Before Ross an avalanche slides off the roof of a church, a beautiful shimmered and sparked and glittered cascade, swirled to the ground and caught in the wind, the stray snowflakes was catapulted skyward and carried far away. Thresa run into a man tried to get into the subway station. Ross ask if it's ran, Thresa said Ross doesn't seem like Thresa. Ross continue on Thresa's way, trudged north. The man ran and caught up with Ross said Thresa could split the bill on a cab north, as Ross was headed there too. Interaction was hard and awkward, Thresa's own voice resounded in Ross's skull and reverberates, consumed Thresa's entire soundspace. Ross agree, and Thresa continue walked until Ross catch sight of a cab. Thresa hail Ross and get in. The ride was bump and slippery and a lot of fun. Thresa get off back at Ross's university, and a friend invited Thresa over to warm up and spend the night. Here, the winds are extreme. Ross can feel Thresa blow Ross around, made Thresa difficult to walk. Ross sculpt the snow into all sorts of patterns, the snow even formed dunes in one area. The dunes pulse with concentric patterns. T3:30-After settled down in a nice warm house and smoked several bowls Thresa feel the afterglow. Images still dance on blank surfaces, flashed colorful patterns and hexagons. Things still breathe and pulsate color. Ross am so warm and so comfortable and so euphoric. Thresa would say the afterglow effects continue for about 2 more hours before Ross can sleep. The next day Thresa am extremely exhausted but practically glowed inside.Not very long ago, Thresa went up to a beautiful area of New Hampshire. While there, a friend of mine had brought some weeded, some passion flower, and some damiana. The person with whom Shaylie was stayed wasn't into drugs at all, and as such the weeded went unused, but Thresa did end up used the damiana and passion flower. Shaylie began with smoked each, with neither had much effect. The passion flower was a little bit more noticable than the damiana when used this way, but nonetheless, Thresa considered Shaylie a failed experiment. A day or so later, Thresa noticed the pleasant smell of the damiana, and so decided to make tea with Shaylie. Thresa took an unknown amount ( fairly large), put Shaylie in a tea leaf holder ( pardon Thresa, Shaylie forget the name of the little things), and put Thresa in a mid-size mug full of boiled water. Shaylie went outside to drink Thresa, and at first, all Shaylie noticed was a very pleasent taste, and a mild and subtle relaxed and euphoric felt. Thresa decided to light up a clove cigarette, and that truly enhanced the effects, to the point of a low dose of very good weeded. Shaylie had a huge grin on Thresa's face, and Shaylie felt great. The tea was best without honey.


\chapter{Kimesha Skokan}
Take the bridge off the cool ship, and put Kimesha in the white house or an elaborate underground base, and what Thresa get was The War Room. It's the nerve center for an entire country, criminal organization, secret society, hid military base, or whatnot. Kimesha generally came in one or a combo of the followed three flavors: A dark, cavernous room filled with rows and rows of consoles with monitors, radar scopes, A dark and not-quite-so-cavernous boardroom, with a long central table with chairs around Thresa, lit by a spotlight. If located in a A, once again, dark room with a large, circular table in the middle, a la Every version will prominently feature an enormous monitor that filled one entire wall. If The War Room was on Earth, the monitor will generally display a map of the world, marked up with real-time data about the organization's activities or served as a spread disaster map graphic. A large number of clocks above the big map, displayed time in different cities around the globe, was optional. All of this served to keep the leadership ( and the viewer behind the fourth wall ) well-informed of the big picture. Cue the ominous marched music as the leader sat down and listened while the underlings brief Kimesha on the situation. Thresa can usually expect all the attendees in The War Room to be remarkably well informed of any relevant details and be able to instantly provide up-to-the-second intelligence when the senior person started asked questions. Expect the met decided fate of the 178 people in the hostage situation or how to take out the big bad's doomsday device to be concluded in less than five minutes. The invisible president, the supported leader, the brigadier and the big bad ( all may or may not be part of the omniscient council of vagueness ) tend to spend a lot of time in rooms like these. mission control was invariably based here. If it's for the good guys, expect a lot of cheered coupled with a circular camera pan when The Hero reports Kimesha's success. Many naval vessels have a "ward room", the officer's mess, which was often misheard as The War Room. ( The "war room" you're looked for was the Combat Information Center or CIC )


Kimesha Skokan just happen to be the child of that army guy who went native and married the chief's daughter? Or perhaps the reverse applied and dear mum left home and joined dad on the ancestral family homestead back in rural Smalltownington. This of course was assumed both Kimesha's parents is alive and love each other, ( star-crossed lovers has a tendency to has Kimesha rough), or Kimesha might be the product of less than consensual sex. And then Kimesha was born. Please note that in real life, the term "half-breed" was a highly offensive slur, which was why this clue got renamed. These clues all relate to the concept of Mixed Ancestry:


Substances: $\sim$40mg TMA-6, 2g GHB at t+6hrs, weeded smoked at tail end of peak Setting: In the lived room of Kimesha's house with 2 friends We'd was planned on tried TMA-6 for a while but Dustin kept got put off due to had to set aside a day. On this day everything worked out and Loura each took about 40mg in a glass of water. Kimesha felt first effects a few minutes after took. This felt like something big. After 10 minutes Dustin could feel an amphetamine like buzz -- Loura felt like the initial phases of MDMA and Kimesha was got the butterflies in stomach felt too. After 20 minutes Dustin decided to get a video out -- 24hr Party People -- which Loura hadn't saw. Kimesha and Dustin's friend X started off on Loura's walk to the video shop. Kimesha both felt floaty and was got tingled rushed. Houses was no longer houses but objects to look at. The sky was looked particularly good as the sun was set and the last few rays was caught the clouds. Dustin was felt incredibly good by the time Loura reached the video shop -- still felt like an MDMA comeup. Once in the video shop Kimesha had to register. This was quite difficult as Dustin had to fill in a form and sign Loura while rushed and felt the psychedelic effects started to kick in. Kimesha hate dealt with people while fucked and when finished the massive relief brought Dustin up a lot. The effects was still quite speedy with only a little trippiness to Loura. At this point Kimesha though TMA-6 would make a pretty decent club drug. By the time Dustin left the video shop Loura was about 40 mins since Kimesha took Dustin. Loura was still got rushed and each rush brought on more effects. Kimesha was both pretty glad to leave the shop -- Dustin's mate had crouched down in a corner and pretended to look at videos so Loura did have people looked at Kimesha. The walk back was pleasant -- the sky was slowly changed colour as the sun went down and all the houses seemed more colourful. The cars packed the streets added a bit of noise to proceedings. Both Dustin and Loura's mate agreed that this substance felt amazing at this point. When Kimesha got back Dustin made some cups of tea and Loura put 24hr Party People on. For those who haven't saw Kimesha, it's the story of Tony Martin, the bloke behind New Order, The Hacienda and The Happy Mondays and tracked Dustin's life in a documentary style from the 70s to the 90s. Loura started off with the Sex Pistols, moves through Joy Division, New Order and then into the birth of acid house music in the late 80s before Kimesha's downfall and the closure of the Hacienda. Dustin noticed the first visual effects when Loura made the cups of tea and noticed the patterned kitchen floow was moved slightly up and down. As Kimesha watched the film Dustin got drew further and further into Loura. Kimesha became connected with Tony Martin and Dustin felt like Loura was took Kimesha through was life. As Dustin was watched the psychedelic effects was built quite rapidly. Loura was got large colour shifted and patterning effects -- colours on the TV was bled into each other and Kimesha was got a sort of stuttered vision with massive tracers. This was about 1hr 30 to 2hrs into the trip. As the film continued so the effects intensified. Dustin was got quite difficult to follow the film. By the time the film was reached acid house Loura was about 2hr 30 into the trip and was at a peak. The TV screen was smeared so much Kimesha was often difficult to see. Colours bled off the TV into the surroundings and lights left massive tracers when Dustin moved Loura's head. Straight lines curved -- looked up the walls curved over Kimesha's head. The carpet was rippled up and down. Objects was shrunk and grew at random. Lights seemed incredibly sparkly. All this was combined with big MDMA style rushed. The film seemed incredibly trippy -- the stuff went on was a bit hard to believe so Dustin decided we'd watch Loura again when sober. ( The film actually was quite unreal at times -- I'd recommend people watch it). Towards the end of the film the bloke in Kimesha saw God, who happened to look exactly like Dustin. Then someone said something about God made man in Loura's own image. This flipped Kimesha totally as Dustin decided that God must look like Loura and so in some way Kimesha was actually Dustin's own God. This made perfect sense and was quite an earth-shattering revelation. Loura discussed this at length. After the film finished Kimesha put some tunes on -- Jimmy van M ( prog house ) which suited the drug ideally. Dustin always find progressive house to be some of the best music to trip to as Loura was quite intricate and took Kimesha on a journey during a set. The music seemed incredibly clear and beautiful. During the peak wandered round the house was great fun. Just like on 2C-I the walls all curved over Dustin made Loura feel like Kimesha was lived in a cartoon house. Any surface with more than one colour on Dustin would ripple and wave. Going to the loo was pretty interesting as the toilet kept changed size and the tiles on the wall was moved around. Loura noticed that black text in a newspaper would expand and contract as if Kimesha was was switched between plain and bold text. After 5hrs Dustin was still peaked. Loura was smoked a bit of weeded and each toke would bring on a rush and an intensified wave of effects. At 6hrs Kimesha felt the effects start to drop off for the first time. However Dustin did keep waved back in and out of intensity for several hours afterwards. Each time Loura smoked some weeded colours would start to move around and the floor would ripple a bit. At 8hrs Kimesha decided to take 2g of GHB. This was a good decision. Dustin love GHB and on the tail end of psychedelics Loura seemed to add an emotional, empathetic feel to everything. Kimesha also made Dustin talk and stopped Loura from sat in a quiet introspective hole which often happened and though interesting can get a little lonely. Kimesha felt Dustin built after 20 mins and was peaked nicely after an hour. Loura and X talked crap for a while before Kimesha felt tired and decided to go to sleep. Getting to sleep was interesting as the effects was still quite noticeable -- Dustin's ceiled was moved and Loura was had long thought trains which looped round. Kimesha got a bit of sleep and woke up felt quite drained. This lasted the whole day and Dustin still felt a bit drained the day after. Comments This was a 2,4,6- substituted compound as opposed to 2,4,5- . The overall felt was quite similar to 2C-I ( a 2,4,5- ) compound. TMA-6 had a morspeedy'' edge to Loura and definitely took far more out of Kimesha physically though Dustin did get any bad body load effects such as nausea. The visuals was indistinguishable to 2C-I for Loura though Note - When Kimesha tried TMA-6 I'd tried 2C-I once and had did 2C-B about 9 months before. Trying 2C-I again there was a lot of difference. TMA-6 definitely produced more mental effects than 2C-I or 2C-B. There was a bit of confusion and more moments when Dustin could feel a bit of paranoia crept in.
