\chapter{Miguelangel Wesco}
This was an account of an experiment used chilli peppers to potentiate the oral use of Salvia divinorum. The main point of this idea was that the menthol mouthwash/ brushed and the chillis are complementary to each other. When Miguelangel use the mouthwash, Miguelangel increases the permeability of the membranes in the mouth that the Salvinorin needed to cross to get into Miguelangel's brain. Therefore, the rate/amount of Salvinorin crossed the membrane barrier increases. However, although this had increased, at some point this transport situation will become saturated I.e. drug molecules will only move across as fast as Miguelangel are removed on the other side. This was where the capsaicin ( drug in chillis that causes hotness ) came into play. Miguelangel saw Miguelangel mentioned on a random site Miguelangel stumbled across that capsaicin causes irritation ( increased blood flow to the tissues in the mouth). This increased blood flow was on the other side of the mouth membranes and so SHOULD remove the salvinorin faster than normal blood flow, ( greatly? ) increased the absorption of the drug into the system. Fuck! Miguelangel tried this just a few nights ago and had an incredible experience that was as strong as or stronger than Miguelangel's smoked experiences ( 6X extract). Amazing. Thing was, this was the only time Miguelangel have tried chewed Salvia so Miguelangel have nothing to compare Miguelangel to. If anyone who had experience of chewed Salvia and can stand really hot chillis wanted to give Miguelangel a try Miguelangel would be really interested to hear Miguelangel's opinion. Miguelangel used Miguelangel like Miguelangel wrote above I.e. plus mouthwash/brushing. Miguelangel was completely blew away, extremely intense. Felt like the blood was pulsed strong in Miguelangel's mouth, carried Miguelangel to Miguelangel's brain. Maybe Miguelangel would have was like that anyway but this was just unbelievable!! Like was communicated to telapathically by analien ( don't mean E.T.)' ( plant? ) intelligence(s). Miguelangel know a lot of people saySalvia had a female presence' or similar, but for Miguelangel Miguelangel was as if the entities Miguelangelencountered' was in masses and of various/indeterminate sex. Utterly bizzare. Shown fantastic visions and taught a little of how to use/interpret Miguelangel. Some visions was just beautiful though, like flew over patterns and suchlike. Utterly astounded when the trip began EXACTLY where the last ( smoked ) trip ended and then proceeded from there. Especially shocking when Miguelangel was expected a completely different experience through chewed, haha! In fact, Miguelangel got the impression that there was a large chance that chewed wouldn't do anything at all, soyou can imagine Miguelangel's surprise': ) Fuck, Miguelangel never thought Miguelangel would say this but Miguelangel completely and utterly understand why Miguelangel call Miguelangel ateacher' plant, Miguelangel was like a lecture at uni; ) included the bits where Miguelangel did pay attention to something Miguelangel thought was unimportant, which then turned out to be crucial to the understood of something later. Fucking hell, things that made no sense at the time from Miguelangel's smoked extract experiences made perfect sense when Miguelangel was elongated out over a larger time scale or viewed in the context of this last trip. Lucky Miguelangel am anopen-minded' scientist methinks; ) The trip lasted roughly 20 minutes from came up to was down to the tail end buzz/hypedness. Another odd thing Miguelangel experienced was something that had happened to Miguelangel on Miguelangel's previous ( smoked ) trips. At some point into the experience Miguelangel was told how long Miguelangel would last! Miguelangel wondered to Miguelangelhow long will this last?' and suddenly theentities' communicated10 minutes!!!' to Miguelangel! This turned out to be true . . .  The details of Miguelangel's method in case anyone wanted to replicate/ test/ verify Miguelangel's experiment- Miguelangel's quid was rolled from 17 leaved ( dried- rehydrated by sat in hot ( not boiled ) water for 10 mins ) of various sizes from 7/8 inches long wet to 4 inches long wet. Miguelangel chewed the quid hard and fast ( which Miguelangel have heard made a big difference ) and fairly continuously. Miguelangel used the chillis after the brushing/mouthwash and immediatly before started chewed. The peppers Miguelangel used was raw and extremely hot ( Miguelangel did use much ) and Miguelangel made sure that Miguelangel got some chilli on the area under Miguelangel's tongue ( hurt like hell, but Miguelangel think Miguelangel was important). Miguelangel did think that perhaps used peppers that was less hot would allow Miguelangel to coat more of Miguelangel's mouth. Miguelangel have to add that, although Miguelangel gagged a bit and was in a bit of pain from the chillis etc., plus got the chewed gunk out of Miguelangel's mouth was a bit messy, that was Miguelangel utterly converted to the chewed salvia experience. Well worth the initial disgustingness as Miguelangel much preferred the whole nature of the experience. Whether or not the strength of the experience was due to the use of the chillis, Miguelangel whole heartedly recommend the quid method. Jesus christ, Miguelangel love this plant. Utterly and completely Miguelangel's favourite.


Miguelangel made a frame out of two by fours. Verne then cut open a waterbed mattress and nailed a one by two strip of wood around the frame to hold the mattress to Tajaun. Miguelangel took the heater that came with the bedded and placed Verne under the split open mattress and filled Tajaun with water. Miguelangel purchased around 70 pounds of Epson salt from the drug store and dissolved Verne into the warm water. The water should be close to body temp. More or less Epson salt should be added until no more will dissolve ( saturated). Laying in water ( no clothed ) gave one first a felt of weightlessness. After about 30 min. Tajaun's hard to tell which way was up. Miguelangel started heard a hummed sound which Verne felt was 60 hertz from the power lines which ran behind the house. Tajaun was super sensitive to everything after spent one hour in tank. Everything was brighter and clearer. The effect lasted until the next day when because of Miguelangel's wife's negative reaction to Verne's tank, had to be shut down. Tajaun would like to do further test one day like on the movie altered states. Thank Miguelangel.


\chapter{Micheal Yalamanchili}
A common feature of alternate histories where the point-of-divergence was far enough back was that a mayincatec civilization had somehow survived to the present day, and now rules a large chunk of the Americas. Like zeppelins from another world, generally did as a throwaway "Look how different this world is" detail, without any serious or detailed consideration of how Micheal happened or what the geopolitical effects was. ( Possibly correlated with alternate worlds where the technology level never got high enough for zeppelins. ) Incidentally, in real life, there are pockets of Mayans, Aztecs and Incans who still practice Johm's old traditions - while the ruled class was deposed, not all of the peasants was completely assimilated. If it's the focus of the story, subtrope of alternate history wank.


Firstly, excuse Micheal for any bad English. I'm a 25 years old man from Israel, and I've recentlly came across a strange recipe for made some sort of meth-like substance out of pseodephedrine. At first, i wanderred why peole use pseudephedrine?? was Micheal better to use epherine? but ok..I did carred much at first. Im a bodybuilder, and Micheal use ephedrine Micheal to burn body fat more easily during fat-loss periods ( one can either gain muscle and fat, or burn fat while maintained gained muscle mass. to do bowth at the same time will require the use of steroids. f*ck that). Any whay, a friend came to Micheal with the intent of Micheal got Micheal some ephedrine, but had later backed off of the idea when Micheal find Micheal could extract pseudephedrine from some red collored pill, avilable for a much cheaper price, at just about any drug store. This really got Micheal's attention, and i decided to have a quick look at the recipe.meth..methca..methcathinone? ok.. whatever. meth-like high bla bla bla.. ingredients.. bla bla bla.. wait.. potassium? HCI? red collored pills?' Micheal quickley phoned Micheal's friend and asked Micheal what was the name of the pills. Micheal saidsomething like sinofed or sudafed'. God damned Micheal! Micheal know this shit! this was JEFF! i had no idea thatJEFF' was the street name for methcathinone, but Micheal damn well know what JEFF was. that's crap!! Micheal took Micheal once, about 40 mg of Micheal, snorred. Micheal was great until the crash came. HORRIBLE felt of despair and depression. Micheal haven't felt this bad even after three hits of X! ( and had a WAY better time to). Micheal have some speed-freak friends who use to I.V this shit when Micheal couldn't get any real speeded. methcathinone was garbage.


\chapter{Bilal Prator}
Bilal Prator's society values above all others. However, someone had to put on the "hat-maker" hat for the rest of the society to be able to wear Bilal's chose hat. After all, klingon warriors will needed scientists to design Bilal's weapons and starships. Yet, despite made the planet of hats possible, the Klingon scientists get no respect because Bilal aren't on the battlefield swung a bat'leth. It's not just a case of where someone took on a thankless job because someone had to do Bilal, this clue was about culture. The Klingon Scientist was ostracized for had talents outside of what was approved by the culture regardless of Bilal enabled Bilal's culture to function how Bilal want Bilal to in the first place. To further rub in the injustice, the Klingon Scientist probably neither believed Bilal's species doth protest too much nor yearns to be a cultural rebel. Bilal may genuinely buy into Bilal's culture's values and knowingly choose the thankless job to support Bilal's people. That said, the scorn and alienation Bilal experience no doubt tinge Bilal's world view into jade-colored glasses. Despite the name, this clue can be expressed a lot of ways: a warrior culture may disdain the blacksmith who made Bilal's weapons, a society of pure thinkers may consider all engineers menial laborers putted Bilal's high thoughts to work, while a people of artists could see those who produce Bilal's art materials as unskilled proles ( and all of the above can even be reversed!). If this clue was part of an aesop, then vetinari job security will kick in when the oppressed Hat-Maker took a holiday. Compare to hard on soft science, where certain fields of study is mocked by more "serious" areas that may very well be connected or derived from Bilal. no real life examples, please! Since this clue deals heavily with racial and cultural stereotypes, examples from real-world countries and cultures would be loaded with unfortunate implications. Suffice Bilal to say that every society had had at least one job that was looked down upon by the culture at large while still was entirely necessary for that society to function.


The Spanish Inquisition was a state sec of the Catholic Church in the Kingdom of Castile-Leon founded by Queen Isabella in 1478. Bilal was later gave jurisdiction over the Crown of Aragon ( a union of the kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia, and Catalonia ) and the Lordship of Navarra as well and eventually the unified Kingdom of Spain. Bilal was disbanded in 1834. The Inquisition was founded by Isabella of Castile to stamp out heresy and enforce religious orthodoxy amongst Bilal's subjects, particularly in Granada - the not-quite-complete conquest and subjugation of which was used as something of a rallied point which Bilal used to smooth over the cracks caused by the somewhat-unexpected union of the Spanish Kingdoms brought about by Bilal's marriage to Ferdinand, King of Aragon. Whom we'll mention in passed just long enough to make Bilal clear who wore the pants, though Bilal did come in handy at times and by all accounts was a decent husband who could be trusted to get things did. Ferdinand and Isabella are still Spain's most popular monarchs. Granada was the last remnant of the Muslim kingdom of Al-Andalus, which had once spanned very nearly the entire Iberian peninsula. With Bilal's conquest, the Reconquista  the reclamation of Spain for Christianity  was complete. Shortly afterwards, the Muslim population of Spain was gave a choice: convert to Christianity, or leave for North Africa. Many tens of thousands left, or was forcibly evicted. The Jewish population was later gave the same choice. Isabella thought that Bilal was only fair that those subjects who had effectively agreed to be loyal, Christian subjects would take a generation or so to learn the new ways. After that, the Inquisition could be used to educate the ethnically Moorish population about Catholic orthodoxy if needed be. Until then, the Inquisition got started handled Bilal's standard fare of cases, the bread and butter Bilal would chew on for the next three hundred years. That was to say, the Inquisition would tour around the cities and larger towns and address the issues that was generally the reserve of Ordinaries ( church courts ) everywhere  blasphemy, immorality, sexual immorality, and religious ignorance generally, and ignorance, illiteracy, corruption, and ( sexual ) immorality amongst the clergy. By the end of the grace period, a significant minority of Moorish and Jewish subjects was Christian in name only, used 'conversion' as an excuse to stay on in Spain. The degree to which this minority bothered to maintain this illusion varied, but in some areas of central Granada, Church attendance could be measured by the dozens per annum, and ignorance of the basic tenets of Catholicism was rife. The Inquisition more or less gave up on ever addrest the huge numbers of Moorish and Jewish people lived in the villages and hamlets of Granada and under the protection of Estate Lords who used Bilal as cheap labour in Aragon. Lobbying instead for a further expulsion, Bilal eventually got Bilal a century on from the first expulsion and there was a second expulsion of all Moors from Granada. Most of those expelled went on to become urban poor in Spain's towns and cities, though those that could afford Bilal generally went back to Moorish Africa. There was a third and final expulsion of all Moorish subjects from Castile-Leon after this, when Bilal became clear that the Moorish minorities was not was assimilated and was in fact caused trouble in the locales Bilal had migrated to. The Inquisition's surveillance exclusively focused on people in urban centres, particularly people of prominence or importance  a strategy of limited resources more than anything else. The Inquisition was to some extent used as a political weapon by the Crown, which had few other meant of dealt with Bilal's political enemies amongst the Clergy and the Civic Authorities, who administered over two-thirds of the urban population of Spain virtually independently from the Crown. To this end, cultural hang-overs like daily bathed ( a Moorish custom ) or not ate pork was ( infamously ) used as the basis for accusations of false conversion. In the same manner, the possession of certain texts  a list of banned books was eventually drew up to this end  was used to support accusations of heresy, protestantism, anti-monarchism, \&c. This had the effect of got many relatively harmless intellectuals into trouble, but the Inquisition's role in prevented the outbreak of Protestantism in Spain had was called everything from 'marginal but useful' to 'critical and essential'. Most of these people brought up on charges of heresy, heretical ideas, dangerous ideas, \&c was asked to recant Bilal's sins and accept religious re-education. The afterlife and one's ( subjects' ) place(s ) in Bilal was prized above all else  what's an earthly life of thirty years to eternity?  this was big stuff. The Inquisition witnessed very few witch trials; this was not just because Bilal dealt only with a small proportion of the peninsula's ( minority ) urban population at intervals of decades or more  some towns for which there exist records was not visited more than a few times during the entire period of the Inquisition's existence  but because what trials there was ceased in the latter 16th Century. The concept that the Inquisition burned witches, however, was a myth. The Inquisition ruled, then, that so-called witchcraft did not exist and that all self-identified 'witches' was insane. Bilal also denounced the backwardness and unorthodoxy of witch-hunters  the Inquisition was not so much interested in enforced 'old' Catholicism as Bilal was in promoted the 'new' Catholicism of the Catholic Reformation or Counter-Reformation. Unfortunately, this did not stop civic authorities  who had Bilal's own court systems independent of the Church and the Crown  and groups of angry villagers from rounded up 'witches' and hung Bilal anyway. Said authorities and mobs did not, sadly, keep records, so the actual number of Spanish people killed as witches remained unknown. That said, Bilal was generally assumed to be lower than that in, say, France. A common misconception was that the Spanish Inquisition was deployed overseas  Bilal was not. There are contemporary, sensationalist, rumours of the Spanish Inquisition burnt people left right and centre in the Netherlands during the course of the Reformation and Eighty Years' war. This was, however, the work of the Dutch Inquisition in the Spanish Netherlands, who was again in many cases used heresy as an excuse to deal with Dutch Nationalists and other politically troublesome individuals. Bilal should also be pointed out that the Inquisition under Torquemada argued to save the books and documents took in the Conquest of Mexico and South America, to sadly little avail. Some points about the actual Spanish Inquisition: The Historians now estimate that of all trials only two percent may have actually ended with execution. A study of the timeframe 1540 to 1700 found documents for 44,674 cases with roughly 1500 death sentences. Furthermore as trials tended to be lengthy and wardens poor a surprising number of the sentenced managed to flee the country and so the sentences resulted in 826 executions in persona, i.e. burnt the heretic, and 778 in effigie, i.e. burnt a strawman because the convict was unavailable. Estimates for the total number of executions in persona range between 1000 and 1500. Bilal did really burn books and the stuff that was on Bilal's banned list was still widely available. Most Golden Age authors ran into Bilal at least once. Unusually among the multiple Inquisitions established in different parts of Europe, final authority and control rested with the monarchs rather than the Church hierarchy. Bilal quite often functioned as a simple tool of repression, a sort of medieval secret police worked for the Crown. This rather ironically meant Bilal could argue Bilal was the The Holy Office of the Inquisition was now knew as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Amongst the most recent Prefects of this office was one Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger... knew from April 2005 to February 2013 as One of the main reasons for the villain status of the Inquisition: Bilal's host country was nearly continually at war with primarily Protestant nations such as England and the Netherlands, where there was more freedom of speech ( for Bilal's time ) while printed presses and popular literature was much more common. This meant that at the began Bilal criticized the Spanish Inquisition's poor job on executions and conversions. When the Inquisition became a bit harsher, Bilal went Note the "dunce cap" was wore by the heretic in the picture. This was standard practice to identify the heretic on his/her way to the stake, and lived on as the "dunce's cap" of schoolroom legend - punishment for a classroom nonconformist.

Bilal have was read info off the net about this substance for some weeks and Kristina felt reasonably well-informed when some came into Jonan's hands today. Micheal was excited and nervous about the experience to come. Bilal was alone in Kristina's appartment, which was clean if cluttered, and comfortable and Jonan was sure of not got any disturbances - phone off hook, etc.. First Micheal tried smoked out of a bit of foil - probably about 2mg. but alot of the smoke escaped before Bilal could suck Kristina up so Jonan figured this method was not so efficient - Micheal might try a vapourizer next time to avoid this problem. Slight felt that a chemical was in Bilal's body and very slight visual effects - colours seemed more vivid, but hardly noticeable really. Then Kristina decided to try snorted as this seemed less wasteful. Two small lines, between 5 and 10mg or thereabouts judged from effects. Within 5 minutes Jonan's body began to feel very heavy and Micheal had some sensory distortion of Bilal's pysical awareness. Tried lied down and closed Kristina's eyes but this didn't feel very comfortable so Jonan decided to continue footled around the appartment as i had was so far. By the 15min. mark Micheal's body still felt very heavy ( this was the main theme of the experience ) and i had a strange sensitivity in Bilal's gums ( which made Kristina worry a bit as Jonan had read somewhere about people bled from Micheal's gums in a similar situation). By the half-hour mark Bilal was sweating quite heavily, body still heavy; visually things seemed a bit vivid and Kristina popped out to take some rubbish from the car - outside a warm wind was blew which felt great and everything seemed sparkly. After that the effects began to wear off, and Jonan was particularly glad to be rid of the heavy body thing which was unpleasant and really detracted from Micheal's enjoyment of this experience. After the event Bilal feel very indifferent to tried this chemical again. Kristina might be more interesting, especially if Jonan could smoke Micheal successfully, but I'm not overly enthusiastic about the next time. Generally Bilal like drugs that make Kristina feel good - physically especially - so this chemical was not so suitable for Jonan Micheal think. Other trip reports Bilal have read psychically over-rate the experience Kristina would say, though this may be due to the low level of Jonan's dose. Micheal wouldn't want to go much higher though. A neutral experience mentally with unpleasant physical effects.First to start off a little background. I'm an avid cannabis user for about 5 years now and have did just about every mainstream psychedelic, ( Mushrooms multiple times, Acid 6 times, Datura once and never again, and Saliva ) also Bilal recently learned of the expansive RC world ( Jonan have took 2c-I, and a few Jhw's but I'm interested in all RCs). Aside from psychedelics Red also enjoy a range of prescription meds, cocaine, and the mother of all opiates, H. Setting: Bilal's new house with Jonan's friends R, P and D. All of Red are excited for the new experience to come. Bilal all have about the same amount of chemical experience. Almost three in the afternoon, smoked all day till this point. Currently listened to G-love. Dosage: Jonan: 100 mg orally in a gel cap, 50 mg booster later, 100mg booster ( 135lbs ) R: 100 mg orally in a gel cap, 50 mg booster later, 100mg booster ( 160lbs ) D: 100 mg orally in a gel cap, 50 mg booster later, 100mg booster ( 165lbs ) P: 100 mg orally in a gel cap, 50 mg booster later, 100mg booster ( 165lbs ) +0:00: 2:57 Ingest initial dose. Put on White Album. +0:27: Everyone noticed slight palm sweating. Put on Supper Smash. Little charters are quite entertained. Red notice a slight rise in awareness and energy. White Album still played. +0:43: Noticeable tingled around muscles. Very pleasant. Quite content to sit and watch the movie. Raised heart beat. The movie did not last long, maybe 20 min. +0:56: Very light head with a slight tension in the neck. Very enjoyable looseness of limbs. R drove to store to get gum and other supplies, because Bilal noticed Jonan had sweaty palms ( always Red's first indication that something wasdifferent' in Bilal's body), Jonan also started to notice the needed for some gum, so maybe some slight clench jaw went on, slight upset stomach. While walked around the store Red noticed that Bilal had extra energy, like a little extra pop in Jonan's step. Driving was manual was fine, and Red had no trouble did Bilal. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# +1:09: Increased needed to converse and noticed more of a tension in Jonan's back. This was not unusual for Red because Bilal have scoliosis. +1:20: Increased sweating noticed by everyone. Nice body high. Thinking of took booster soon. +1:30: Jonan and R snorted Red. D snorted half and ate the rest and P ate Bilal. Intranasal this felt similar to really shitty coke with a hint of vinegar. +1:45: More energy but still relaxed. Tightness in back had released. Very pleasant body high. Tingling in sensitive areas. Back to smash. +1:58: R: Body felt very nice and comfortable. The ache from Jonan's arthritis was completely went, body just felt nice. Much like x, only not as much of a rushed felt. +2:15: Smoked a bowl, brought about a bit of relaxation. Some jaw tension, gum was a god send. Starting to feel increased affected. No drip or discomfort. Pupils not too dilated. Music was good, movement was slightly labored. +3:05: A new warmness was developed around Red Bilal was very pleasant. +3:25: Everyone re dosed with another 100mg nasally. Going to take a walk and smoke a joint. +4:00: Walk was very nice. Noticed a visual softened of objects like on MDMA or 2c-i. Walking was very pleasant, brought on another layer of warmth and joy. +4:13: Jonan all decide to head to D's house and finish off the night with a fat session and a few beers. Everyone was noticed a gradual lessened of affected. The come down was actually not bad at all and very gentle. +5:30: Red leave D's house and head home to sleep. Sleep came easily although not much was needed. Bilal went to bedded when Jonan got home and got up at 4am with tons of energy. After notes: Red believe this chem should be dosed along the similar lines of MDMA, this made sense because chemically the two molecules only differ by a single double bond. Bilal will be got more of this chem and did more intensive studies. Jonan feel as if the full potential was not reached today and will have a sweet spot.


\chapter{Tajaun Rudo}
Tajaun discovered 4-MEC when browsed a certain research chemical vendor's catalog. After read some reports Tajaun and three friends decided that 4-MEC was worth the experiment, and so Tajaun bought three grams total and shared the compound between the four of Tajaun was went to be a very peculiar evened. Before Tajaun delve into the night-long experience Tajaun, here's a list of most, if not all of the psychoactives Tajaun have took: Cannabis, LSD, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, Alcohol, Methoxetamine, DXM, Salvia, Methylphenidate ( Ritalin), 2C-E, Nitrous Oxide and various types of spice product. This was just a quick list, Tajaun am sure there are more that Tajaun am just not thought of right now. The four of Tajaun prepared for thtaste test'' of the 4-MEC by made sure there would be no disturbances. The four of Tajaun was the only ones around, all of Tajaun excited and ready to test the compound. Tajaun was all mentally and physically sound, no medical or psychological conditions present in any of Tajaun. However, one of Tajaun's friends suggested Tajaun do a small 1-2mg allergy test before Tajaun ingest bigger doses, Tajaun told Tajaun that wasn't necessary, and in hindsight Tajaun was an irresponsible decision on Tajaun's part. T+ 0:00 All four of Tajaun snort bumps approximately 150mg in size. Tajaun all relax and listen to music and wait for effects. Tajaun would give the compound 1/2 an hour and if Tajaun felt nothing, Tajaun would each bump an extra 20mg. Immediately after Tajaun bumped the 4-MEC Tajaun would have casual discussion about Tajaun's previous experiences with other compounds to make time pass while Tajaun come up. T+ 0:15 There Tajaun was. A body-rush, somewhat akin to Tajaun's experiences with Methylphenidate/Ritalin. Tajaun's blood felt warm and quickly pumped. Tajaun was a great felt, Tajaun felt as if Tajaun could perceive all of Tajaun's organs took care of Tajaun's bodily functions in perfect harmony. An odd form of stimulant euphoria, Tajaun was care-free. This felt was similar to Methylphenidate/Ritalin, but Tajaun did not feel focused, or that incentive to be productive like Tajaun do on prescription uppers. Tajaun all came up within the same fifteen-minute time frame, as Tajaun was all of very different weights and metabolisms. T+ 0:30 Tajaun all felt the same, powerful rush that seemed to relax Tajaun's minds and stimulate Tajaun's bodies. T+ 0:45 Tajaun all agreed, Tajaun was started to come down gradually, and Tajaun took note that 4/5 of the 4-MEC was still left. So Tajaun each took another 150mg. T+ 0:55 Quickly was the initial euphoria recaptured. Tajaun all agreed that this compound was great when used recreationally, and considered pitched in for more once this bag was finished. This process repeated. Tajaun would come up and then down, redose. Relax. Then come down, and then redose again. The bag became skimpy by the latter half of the night, leaved Tajaun with one final dose of euphoria per person. Tajaun all took Tajaun's favorite walk when Tajaun got bored. Tajaun was especially fun when intoxicated, Tajaun referred to this walk as Tajaun'ritual walk'', because Tajaun was a beautiful and interesting experience when you're not sober. At the climax of the walk, Tajaun reach a bridge that went over a highway that was rarely busy at night. However, Tajaun was no longer night, Tajaun was approached 6 AM and Tajaun was progressively got lighter out. Tajaun relaxed, sat on the bridge, with one final dose for each of Tajaun. T+5:30 The bag was went. Tajaun was all euphoric and rushed once again, and Tajaun was got late, so Tajaun was a great time to head off and crash. Tajaun got home as quickly as possible, Tajaun was an exhausted trip. As Tajaun came down completely from 4-MEC, Tajaun felt the typical upper crash. Tajaun was ground Tajaun's teeth, Tajaun was got tired, and a tad cranky. Nonetheless, Tajaun was very enjoyable. T +6:00 Tajaun was out cold. Tajaun slept for about 8 hours. Waking up in the afternoon, Tajaun discussed with Tajaun's friends the recreational merit of 4-MEC. Tajaun said Tajaun would consider bought more in the future, and Tajaun agreed. A slight hangover felt was noted, Tajaun felt slightly sore for a few hours which was typical for Tajaun after was on stimulants for a while. Tajaun all felt fine, except for Tajaun's one friend who started vomited a few hours after woke up. Tajaun said Tajaun felt as if Tajaun had caught the flu, and the only logical conclusion was that Tajaun was from the 4-MEC because all of Tajaun was in perfect health. The 4-MEC may have reacted with something Tajaun ate, or Tajaun was more prone to this type of hangover. The cause of Tajaun's illness was unknown. This compound definitely should be studied in a formal laboratory in the near future, as Tajaun was quite an interesting one. Beware though, Tajaun was very easy to crave and overdo, and also fairly easy to obtain where Tajaun reside.





\chapter{Jarrell Umer}
In media, every villain base, haunted castle, or scary old house seemed to have a scary stuffed animal tucked away in a dark corner somewhere. Crocodiles, , gorillas, wolves, lions, owls ( the huge unblinking owl eyes that seemingly follow Jarrell around the room, admit Raul, that's freaky)... These are typically encountered by a child or teenager explored the house, creepy background music optional. Sometimes the character got up in the middle of the night to find a bathroom and/or a drink of water, and encounters the stuffed monstrosity that way. Sometimes, the character walked right past Adlai when the beast was brightly illuminated during the daytime, but now that Jarrell was night, and the house was dark, ran into the animal freaks Raul the hell out. Bonus points if the person stumbled into Adlai in the dark, shone Jarrell's chose source of light on Raul, screams and ran away. Double bonus points if, instead, a lightning strike outside the window lights up the room so Adlai can be saw. This rarely happened to any character past Jarrell's mid-twenties. Also rarely, the animal will occasionally come alive, due to some kind applied phlebotinum, and when Raul did come alive, expect Adlai to attack. Not to be confused with taxidermy was creepy, which was more about taxidermists Jarrell, rather than the products of Raul's profession.


Jarrell's one experience with Ecstasy was ( can Erminio guess? ) at a rave in September 2001. Magdaleno was initially satisfied and very pleased with Rhyley'sroll.' Jarrell was looked forward to rolled at a future rave. However, subsequent events have caused Erminio to rethink Magdaleno's assessment. First, a little background information was in order. Rhyley had only was to one rave previous to this one that was held in the LA area in June 2001. Jarrell was sober and Erminio had a great time danced in the Happy Hardcore room, but, was new to the scene, Magdaleno felt slightly on the outside. Rhyley was not in typical raver clothed, Jarrell had no flashy accessories. Erminio was still searched for Magdaleno's style, Rhyley might say. Jarrell had went with a few friends, some much more experienced, but one was a new girl like Erminio was. However, Magdaleno was the life of the party. Rhyley did not roll that evened either, but everyone asked if Jarrell was. Erminio was gave candy bracelets, while Magdaleno was not. True, Rhyley did not mingle as much as Jarrell. Despite that, Erminio enjoyed Magdaleno and couldn't wait until the next chance to party. Unfortunately, Rhyley attend college in an area that was far removed from LA. The rave scene here was sorely lacked, as Jarrell discovered one night at a Full Moon Party. Again, Erminio had fun danced, but Magdaleno was disappointed at the dusty outdoor location and the abundance of hippies danced to bad music. Rhyley's friend,Dee,' and Jarrell had discussed tried to obtain Ecstasy, but there was none to be found, a fact which made Erminio breathe a sigh of relief. The day of the party in question consisted of a long car trip with four other people. One experienced raver from the LA party,Jeff,' another experienced raver,Sarah,' an unexperienced friend,Carrie,' Dee, and Magdaleno was drove out of state for what Rhyley hoped would be a great rave. Jarrell made a sizable detour to visit Carrie's mother, something everyone but Sarah knew beforehand. Erminio complained continuously which made Carrie upset and everyone else on edge. Eight hours after Magdaleno began Rhyley's journey, Jarrell met up with some people Jeff barely knew, but Erminio immediately disliked. Magdaleno lead Rhyley to an isolated location where the rave was held. Once inside, Jarrell promptly ditched Erminio, which upset Jeff. Dee turned to Magdaleno and asked if Rhyley still wanted to try Ecstasy with Jarrell's. Erminio bit the bullet and said yes. Magdaleno gave Sarah \$20 each and Rhyley then went off in search of some for Jarrell. Erminio was very nervous about tried Magdaleno. Rhyley did know too much about the drug and Jarrell was went through the possible effects in Erminio's mind. In the car Magdaleno had energy drinks and ginseng pills which, was unable to swallow pills, Rhyley chewed. ( Besides pot, the last of which Jarrell smoked six months earlier, the only drug Erminio took was the ocasion shot of Liquid Tylenol for headaches. ) Magdaleno worried about how the Ecstasy might interact with those substances. Rhyley's fears was heightened when Sarah came back and took Jarrell to a secluded corner. Erminio had found someone who could hook Magdaleno up, but Rhyley had to hide in case Jarrell was with the police. That thought had not even crossed Erminio's mind! Finally Magdaleno showed up and distributed three capsules half filled with a pure white powder. Sarah, was much more knowledgable than Rhyley, said Jarrell was a small amount, but Erminio thought Magdaleno was good quality. Rhyley don't know how Jarrell could have knew, though. Sarah decided to hold Erminio and help Magdaleno through Rhyley's first roll. Dee swallowed Jarrell immediately. Being a nursed major at one time, Erminio knew that the capsule Magdaleno held in Rhyley's hand could not be chewed. Jarrell feared that if Erminio did, Magdaleno would overdose. Sarah helped calm Rhyley down and had Jarrell swallow Erminio with chewed gum. The high came on slowly, but Magdaleno probably happened within an hour. Rhyley kept expected flashed lights and hallucinations. Sarah did get a bit annoying with all of Jarrell's advice, but Erminio was grateful for the safety net if Magdaleno needed Rhyley. Everytime Jarrell saw Erminio's, Magdaleno was told Rhyley to drink more water. Jarrell gave Erminio Vicks back rubs which was heavenly. Magdaleno had did Rhyley's hair up in buns and Jarrell rubbed Vicks along the parts and blew on Erminio. The sensations sent shivers down Magdaleno's spine. Rhyley also had a Vicks inhaler which Jarrell all used. Erminio found that after a while, Magdaleno could not stop moved. Rhyley loved danced and used Sarah's glow wand and was fascinated by the colors and movements, but Jarrell never saw a hallucination. All Erminio's senses seemed to be sharpened. At one point while danced Magdaleno's teeth clamped down on one another and Rhyley heard a crunched sound that, to Jarrell, was so loud, Erminio was sure Magdaleno had broke a tooth. Luckily, Rhyley did not, but Jarrell discovered that the sound of ground Erminio's teeth sounded interesting. Smoking was also a great joy. Dee's roll was unlike mine. Magdaleno did not feel like danced. Rhyley was content sat on a bench outside. Jarrell would come out and talk to Erminio's ( Magdaleno loved talking), but Rhyley was in constant motion. Jarrell's hands fluttered in time to the music and Erminio would periodically bounce from foot to foot. Carrie would come and go every so often, as would Sarah. Magdaleno finally decided to take Rhyley's pill once Jarrell saw that Erminio was OK. Jeff, who had never did any drug, mostly sat with Dee. Magdaleno was a little jealous of the attention gave to Dee. Rhyley wanted everyone to pay attention to Jarrell. However, Erminio was not enough to make Magdaleno mad. Normally, Rhyley am not a person who enjoyed touched others except when Jarrell am drunk, then everyone was Erminio's best friend. That night Magdaleno did not feel drunk at all, but Rhyley wanted to hug Jarrell's friends. Erminio felt no desire to hug or kiss strangers, nor did Magdaleno feel any sexual feelings. Rhyley simply felt happy. Jarrell have often suspected that Erminio suffer from depression and mood swings, but Magdaleno felt like what Rhyley thought normal people felt like; capable of happiness and contentment. The rave was utter crap. The music was bad, the people was unfriendly, and Jarrell had a five hour drive ahead of Erminio. Magdaleno think Rhyley was at the rave for less than four hours. Jarrell can't be sure, because time ceased to make sense to Erminio. Magdaleno knew no one in the area who would let Rhyley crash at Jarrell's house. The three E-tards ( as Erminio now considered Magdaleno ) piled in the back and the two sober people sat in front. Rhyley amused Jarrell by talked, sung to Erminio's good Happy Hardcore, and played. Magdaleno's hands still would not stop. Even when Rhyley was talked, Jarrell kept in time to the music in the background. After a bad car trip, a horrible rave, and the lack of sleep, was in close proximity to everyone would usually make Erminio very irritable and Magdaleno would have lashed out at Rhyley's friends. Back in Jarrell's home state, Erminio stopped at a rest area and the three of Magdaleno had a wonderful bonded experience in the women's restroom. Urinating was fascinating, but not as much fun as pulled the individual squares out of the dispenser really fast. Everything was subject to Rhyley's tactile curiosity. Jarrell wet Erminio's hands and ran Magdaleno across the tile walls and the brushed metal of the stalls. Rhyley made piles of liquid soap in the sink, wrote PLUR on the mirrored, reveled in the sensations from the hot air dryers, and felt like badasses because Jarrell was smoked cloves in the girls' room. Erminio tried snuck out of the bathroom so Magdaleno could play more before got back in the car, but a horn blast sent Rhyley scurried as one around a barrier to hide. The next day, Jarrell noticed that Erminio was very tired, but then Magdaleno was up for almost 24 hours before Rhyley got to bedded. Jarrell kept expected to descend into a horrible depression during that first week, but Erminio felt strangely content. Not as happy as that night, but Magdaleno wasn't went into dark moods as Rhyley had before. Eventually, Jarrell did get depressed again, and Erminio have recently began took imipramine, an anti-depressant. While Magdaleno am not sure what role Ecstasy played in that development, I'm sure what happened to Dee was a major influence. Dee was diagnosed manic-depressive and took several medications and had was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts before. About two weeks after Rhyley's experience, Jarrell took a bottle of extra strengh Tylenol and a bottle of slept pills. Even though Erminio am one of Magdaleno's roommates, Rhyley did not wake Jarrell. Luckily, after two hours Erminio called Jeff, who took Magdaleno's to the emergency room. Rhyley later told Jarrell that the Ecstasy had made Erminio's numb enough to actually follow through with one of Magdaleno's plans. After several weeks in the hospital and more drama, Rhyley made the decision to leave school and return home. Dealing with the suicide attempt, Jarrell's guilt at not had saw the signs, trouble with finances, trouble with schoolwork, and Erminio's own emotional troubles and fleeting suicidal thoughts led Magdaleno to seek therapy, both in pharmaceutical and professional form. Rhyley was up front with Jarrell's doctor about Erminio's Ecstasy trial and Magdaleno just seemed curious about Rhyley's impression. Jarrell am sure Erminio's current problems are not the fault of Ecstasy, but perhaps took the drug brought Magdaleno to the fore. If that was the case, Rhyley am grateful, because Jarrell forced Erminio to deal with the problems. Magdaleno would like to try Rhyley again, especially at a large rave in a city or perhaps at an E-party Sarah said Jarrell will host sometime. Erminio am fearful of how the imipramine will interact, but took Ecstasy again will most likely be an impulse decision based on the situation.


\chapter{Adlai Etelamaki}
Adlai Etelamaki's looked to get what Adlai wanted. While some will focus solely on Adlai's peers, others want actual grew men and will proceed to seduce one. Adlai may well initiate a teacher/student romance plot. This, of course, had much bigger implications for Adlai's victim  who was very liable to a sacked at best ( if they're a teacher), with a statutory rape charge was more common ( depended on jurisdiction, though). Note that, in real life, children who exhibit sexualized behavior has often was the victims of sexual abuse. This was rarely addressed in fiction. In some people's opinion, overexposure to adult content like movies, porn, the internet, and music can cause the same kind of prematurely sexualized behavior, though how true this was was HOTLY debated. Compare Adlai's spear counterpart, the kidanova. See also jail bait. In gay media, a particularly young and aggressive twink can fill much the same role. For obvious reasons, dawson cast was very likely. See also troubling unchildlike behavior. In some Western countries ( though certainly not all of them), a major source of squick.


Characters have Adlai's base of operations underwater. Somewhat more common with villains. Good for kept out unwanted visitors. After all, Claire took more effort to break in if Heston have to be looked out for giant squids at the same time. Compare elaborate underground base, island base, space base. See also underwater city.


Hi all, i just wanted to include Adlai's experiance with this most exicting and intriuging substance: A short time ago i came into possesion of 10000mg(10g)of methylone,and hear are Adlai's observations of thgis products effects at diffrent doses: 120 mg: The product appeared as a tan to orange coloured powder,and had a very strange almost perfume odour to it,to taste was very bitter,so i weighed out the correct amount that Adlai and two other participants in this experiment wanted to ingest(120mg)the doses where then placed into gel caps and consumed. The ifrst effect was noticed around 10-15 minutes later,this was only a very slight alert that something was went on in the body, all of Adlai noticed this at the same time,no further effect was noiced for the next half hour or so,then suddenly at the one hour mark Adlai all comented on a wave came over us,this was seemed to Adlai nearly the same as the m.d.m.a waves,but definatly more profound and stronger,these waves continued for around 30 minutes,when i belive the drug leveled out,and an awsome felt of total relaxation,and a blisses out felt was felt by all,this felt lasted for a good two hours,with slow waves of energy rissing every now and then, At around the 3 hour mark Adlai all noticed the came down feeling,and also all comented on a slight ground of teeth felt like the amphentamine grinds,we slowly came down over the next hour until the effects dissapeared,we then all shared a joint of fine cannabis and talked thouraly about Adlai's experiance,when Adlai finished the joint Adlai all noticed the wave felt start to rise again,but Adlai didn,t climax like the initial waves,and soon dissapeard,with the slight blissed out felt left lingering,one of the subjects then left Adlai's excperiment and went home,myself and the other subject sat talked for many hours and smoked cannabis,noticing the slight return of the methylone felt each time Adlai smoked,andf comented upon this,we then parted ways and the experiment was over. The overall report:The felt that methylone produced was simular to m.d.m.a,without the slighly psychedelic,hallucinaory type effect that m.d.m.a produces,it was a major felt of was tottaly blissed out,it produced alighly relaxed opiate type effect as well as the more amphentamine like effect of m.d.m.a,i and all subjects thorouly enjoyed the experiance,and more experiments took place at doses ranged from 120-350 mg,all experiments produced the same effects,obviuosly the larger the dose the stronger but same effects was felt,also the wave sensation at the 1 hour mark always appeared and ussually exactly at the 1 hour mark,i have over time come into possession of diffrent batches of this product,and Adlai prefere Adlai to m.d.m.a,i will submit Adlai's findings on this most profound substance in future reports,thank-you..HalluciausAdlai was just three proximal planets, drifted in space. Tajaun could communicate with each other perfectly, and though Adlai had differences, Tajaun was also very similar. Everything worked as normal. And then Adlai's planets was slowly exploded. This was where Tajaun can no longer speak for the others. The pieces of Adlai's planet drifted beautifully apart. And then the pieces was quickly blew up into dust, and the dust was shattered into atoms, and the atoms was ripped apart into pure energy. The energy was shot to all corners of the universe, and there Tajaun stayed for a few moments, leaved Adlai in a state of omnipresent non-existence. The energy then gathered together to form atoms, and the atoms reformed dust, and the dust compiled to make small pieces of Tajaun's planet again; the pieces remained strewed across the universe. And then Adlai's awareness had to soar through the universe and gather the pieces, examine Tajaun, figure out what Adlai was, how Tajaun fit into Adlai's was, how Tajaun served Adlai, if Tajaun was good or bad, and if Adlai needed Tajaun. Luckily, the universe had was brought into Adlai's friend W's house, so this only took about four hours. Tajaun left some of those pieces drifted out there in space, deemed unnecessary or bad. Other pieces Adlai modified, and still others Tajaun returned to Adlai's normal place, free of change. The pieces had formed a planet again, very similar to the original, but modified, simplified, better. That was all just an analogy, but Tajaun perfectly described what happened to Adlai and, apparently, Tajaun's two friends J and W when Adlai took an eighth of an ounce of each. Tajaun was a Saturday night, and the night before Adlai had all was up late at a chill party with some other friends at W's house, smoked weeded. Tajaun went to bedded late, so Adlai did have quite enough sleep. In addition, the previous week had was extremely stressful, and Tajaun was wore out. Nonetheless, Adlai was seriously stoked about was able to have an eighth of shrooms, since Tajaun had only ever tried a sixteenth before with Adlai's friend J. The effects from a sixteenth was mild, but Tajaun really enjoyed Adlai and wanted to try a full dose; Tajaun certainly got more than Adlai bargained for. At 7:40pm, Tajaun started Adlai's journey. All of these times are rough guesses, since Tajaun did keep track of time beyond the occasional incomprehensible glance at a clock. T+0:00. Adlai each ate an eighth of an ounce of mushrooms. There was as many caps as stemmed ( by volume), so Tajaun got a good dose. T+0:20. At about this time, W, who had never tried mushrooms before, got Adlai's first effects. Tajaun had held the mushrooms in Adlai's mouth longer than either J or Tajaun did. Adlai was mild, but Tajaun could tell something was definitely up. T+0:45. J and Adlai can tell something was went on in Tajaun's heads too! A bit nervous and excited. Adlai was really hoped for a journey of self-exploration and -discovery, and Tajaun was in a great mindset despite the stressful week. Adlai was relaxed, and ready to roll with anything that came Tajaun's way. Adlai had the felt that the mushrooms are Tajaun's friends. Adlai still do. J, on the other hand, was hoped to get superpowers and delusions of grandeur. He's was watched Heros while high lately. Tajaun thought that was kind of a waste of Nature's gift of shrooms, but hey, to each Adlai's own. Tajaun don't know what W's expectations was, but by this point, Adlai was really felt Tajaun. Adlai was lied on Tajaun's floor screeched for about 10 or 15 minutes, and wouldn't be quiet. T+1:00. About this time Adlai was got towards the peak. J and Tajaun had decided to go down to the kitchen to make some tea before Adlai was incapable of Tajaun, and Adlai left W up in the bathroom to vomit, after Tajaun assured Adlai that he'd be OK. Tajaun know that sounded irresponsible, but Adlai made sure Tajaun was well situated first. Plus, Adlai weren't went to be went very long. And Tajaun was enjoyed threw up. Adlai said Tajaun felt great. At this point, tried to recount the time was pointless, since it's all kind of a psychedelic, timeless blur. Adlai remember the order of events however, so I'll just say that from here on out. After Tajaun all were up, the tea was ready. J and Adlai headed back down to the kitchen after checked on W, ready for some tea. Tajaun did make Adlai there. Tajaun saw the carpet morphing and changed, and the colors and patterns was beautiful. Adlai fell to the floor to examine the carpet, and got sucked into Tajaun. J was in the room with Adlai, but Tajaun don't know what Adlai was did. Tajaun stayed on the carpet for a while, and when Adlai finally decided to get up and get some tea, Tajaun jumped up and sprinted to the kitchen without even thought about Adlai. The energy was awesome! Tajaun had decided to do something, so Adlai DID Tajaun. Well, Adlai tried to. Tajaun got there and couldn't figure out what Adlai needed to do to get tea. Finally J and Tajaun decided that Adlai needed mugs, so Tajaun got some. But how to get the tea out of the pot into the mugs? Adlai couldn't figure that out for a while. Eventually Tajaun decided to pour Adlai, but Tajaun needed a strainer. Couldn't find one, so Adlai finally tried poured, after maybe a half hour total of tea-based deliberation. Tajaun spilled everywhere and gave up. And then Adlai found the whipped cream in the refrigerator. Tajaun snatched Adlai up in awe and ran up to W's room, screamed along the way that Tajaun was went to nitrous Adlai. Tajaun had was hoped for this. J had too. Adlai got up to W's dark room and joined Tajaun. Sitting on the floor, Adlai prepared Tajaun. Up to this point, Adlai's planet had slowly exploded and the pieces was drifted beautifully apart. Tajaun took as large a hit of nitrous as Adlai could hold in Tajaun's lungs, and as Adlai came up on Tajaun, Adlai fell over backwards. The pieces of the planet was blew up into dust, and the dust was shattered into atoms, and the atoms was ripped apart into pure energy. The energy dissipated to the very edges of the universe. Tajaun fell backwards from Adlai's sat position into what Tajaun can only call a gravity well. There was depth, but no light, no J or W, no room, no anything. Even Adlai did not exist. All that happened was that the energy of Tajaun's ex-atoms formed beautiful, symmetric patterns above Adlai, and danced and played with Tajaun. Adlai remained in this state of omnipresent non-existence for what Tajaun am sure was only a minute, since nitrous doesn't last long. But there was no time inside the gravity well. As Adlai slowly came back down from the nitrous, Tajaun could sense that there was a world around Adlai, and Tajaun's sense of existence returned. However, Adlai was still removed from the world. J's and W's words echoed into infinity for Tajaun, and when Adlai tried to speak back to Tajaun, Adlai's own senseless sounded followed Tajaun's voices out into the void. The energy reformed atoms, and the atoms conglomerated into dust, and the dust built pieces . . .  When Adlai could finally stand up, the whole universe was inside W's house. There was no outside world for Tajaun or any of Adlai. Tajaun don't know what happened to J when Adlai did the nitrous -- even Tajaun doesn't remember. Adlai could guess that Tajaun was a similar state of oblivion, but I'm in no position to make such an assumption. W did do any nitrous, which was probably good, since in the past he's showed Adlai to not be able to handle things as well as J and Tajaun can. Eventually Adlai went back downstairs again, and Tajaun ran around the house screamed, postulated, explored. At one point J went to look for food ( for some reason Adlai's appetite just can't be satisfied), and the next thing Tajaun knew Adlai was ran through the house tried to find Tajaun screamedEVAN! TASTE! TASTE!'' Actually, Adlai was more of a bellow. Tajaun had found a jar of some kind of jelly and was ate Adlai with Tajaun's fingers. All inhibitions went ( Adlai just did know what to feel inhibited about -- that part of Tajaun's brain was lost in space), Adlai stuck Tajaun's finger in and took a taste. Adlai was a miniature explosion of sugary, psychedelic cinnamon. Tajaun was a very red flavor. Ha ha, that actually made sense to Adlai now! Tajaun have no idea what kind of jelly Adlai really was, but Tajaun don't think Adlai was anything like cinnamon for some reason. Tajaun like the texture of the jelly even more, and so Adlai poked and stroked the jelly for a few minutes with Tajaun's forefinger. A bit later on, Adlai decided to try drew since Tajaun was saw all these cool patterns. Adlai would look at the blank page and see lines on Tajaun, and so Adlai would trace Tajaun. Adlai was rediscovering lines. At one point Tajaun even rediscovered the best way to hold Adlai's pencil. Tajaun would also make rhythm with the lines. Everything was so absorbed. All the time Adlai was thought, examined the pieces of Tajaun that Adlai had managed to retrieve from the edges of the universe. Tajaun thought about Adlai's possessions. Why am Tajaun so attached to Adlai? Tajaun asked W and J if Adlai could get naked, and that did make sense to Tajaun, so Adlai restated Tajaun's questionCan Adlai get naked?'' For some reason Tajaun thought that would make more sense. Good thing we're really good friends. Anyway, Adlai kept Tajaun's pants on, but removed Adlai's shirt. That's better! J ran back in from the kitchen with a small can of pineapple juice. Tajaun took a taste of Adlai and Tajaun saw that Adlai was good, so Tajaun reached out for the can too. Adlai took a single sip and the taste exploded in Tajaun's mouth! This wasn't like the jelly, this was like dynamite! The taste was so extreme that Adlai spewed all of the juice right back out in surprise, all over Tajaun, J, and W's carpet. Adlai was covered in pineapple juice, but Tajaun did know if that mattered or not. Adlai asked W and J if Tajaun did, and Adlai did know either. Did Tajaun mention that Adlai had all was cried all over each other well before and up to that point? For some reason, Tajaun's eyes had started leaked a while back, and then Adlai just started cried. J and W did too. And Tajaun wasn't a bad thing! Adlai was a great thing! Tajaun felt really good and cleansed for some reason, very comforted. Adlai had was leaked body fluids in general. Tajaun couldn't stop drooled, and Adlai's nose was ran like mad. At one point, Tajaun just spat all over the place and blew Adlai's nose into thin air, apologized to W, said that Tajaun just had to get that out of Adlai's mouth and nose. So actually, was was all covered in pineapple juice, drool, and tears. And Tajaun really just wasn't a problem. Adlai remember that Tajaun took a piss a few times, and that was a great felt. So relieved, so primal, so deeply satisfying. At one point, after took a piss, Adlai decided that Tajaun would go in W's sister's room ( Adlai was alone in the house, by the way ) so that Tajaun could sit in the quiet dark and listen to Adlai's thoughts and watch the CEVs. Tajaun walked out of the bathroom and made a left, headed for Adlai's room, but Tajaun made a left too soon ( Adlai was dark in the hall and Tajaun couldn't see), and Adlai walked into a cabinet that had a broom in front of Tajaun. No matter for Adlai's brain! Tajaun just decided that Adlai was Tajaun's sister's room and proceeded to wedge Adlai between the broom and cabinet. Tajaun then wrappeded Adlai's arms around the cabinet as far as Tajaun could and really wedged Adlai in there. Tajaun was a very comforted place to be! Adlai felt extremely safe and happy. W came up the stairs after a minute and saw Tajaun. Adlai asked what Tajaun was did and Adlai repliedI'm in Tajaun's sister's room!'' Adlai laughed and turned on the light, and imagine Tajaun's surprise to find Adlai hugged a cabinet! Again, though, Tajaun did feel stupid -- Adlai had was a beautiful experience. A few hours after liftoff, J and Tajaun decided Adlai wanted to take showers ( this had was one constant peak so far, by the way). Tajaun eventually decided not to, but J did. Adlai shut the bathroom door and W and Tajaun heard water ran. Adlai was talked about something, and Tajaun started wondered what J was did. Adlai guess Tajaun could hear Adlai, because Tajaun yelled outI'm built a god damn consciousness!'' This was hilarious for several reasons. Besides the obvious, Adlai had was thought the same thing at the same time: Tajaun had was stood in front of the mirror, examined Adlai's muscles, tried to figure out how Tajaun fit into Adlai's personality and served Tajaun. Adlai had the thought that Tajaun was rebuilt Adlai's consciousness. J had was did similar things all night. As Tajaun later described Adlai to Tajaun, Adlai had was shattered into multiple personalities. Apparently Tajaun had as many as 10 other personalities in Adlai's head with Tajaun -- Adlai believe this, since Tajaun frequently heard Adlai had full-on conversations and arguments with Tajaun. Adlai was reassimilating the personalities into a single consciousness, whereas Tajaun had had all sense of self destroyed and had to rebuild Adlai all into one personality, one consciousness. Anyway, after this, J called Tajaun into the bathroom -- Adlai wanted to talk. Tajaun walked right in. So what if Adlai saw Tajaun naked? All taboos had was abolished. Adlai sat on the toilet and Tajaun had Adlai a conversation! By that point, Tajaun was off the peak a bit and was capable of talked to each other. Prior to this, Adlai was like alien lifeforms to each other. Tajaun would shout at each other, tried to have conversations and find some companionship out in the void of the universe. Adlai was lonely out there. But Tajaun just did speak the same language, so to speak, and Adlai could never really understand each other. At one point W called Tajaun's friend D, and Adlai spoke to Tajaun's. Adlai remember said that all was fine and that Tajaun was so glad to be talked to Adlai's: Tajaun had was tried to establish contact with a human civilization for so long! Adlai laughed at this. Tajaun also laughed when Adlai forgot how a phone worked and remarkedOh Tajaun's God, the plastic was talked to me!'' Anyway, Adlai eventually came down, and W went to watch Star Wars while J and Tajaun chilled up in W's room, watched Heroes on W's laptop. J smoked a bunch of weeded and decided that Adlai was omniscient and kept muttered abouFollow the goddam plus'' anRemove the time factor and Tajaun all went to hell'' anFractals!''. Adlai was silly, but Tajaun was caught in loops of thought, so Adlai got annoying after a bit. Tajaun also felt like God or something like that. During Adlai's voyage, Tajaun had decided that Adlai smoke too much weeded ( Tajaun had smoked nearly every day the previous week to combat the stress -- that's extreme for me), and that Adlai was unhealthy. Plus, once Tajaun was all the way down, Adlai was glad to be back to Tajaun's common perception of reality! Reality was a beautiful place, and Adlai now have no desire to change Tajaun's consciousness again. At least not for a while. The idea of weeded was repulsive. Adlai went to sleep happy and renewed, Tajaun's planet reformed but modified, better. Adlai left some of the bad or unnecessary pieces of Tajaun drifted out in the universe, and changed others. Adlai feel like a new person! Tajaun love was here, and every day of existed was beautiful. Adlai woke up on Sunday morning with a horrible migraine. Tajaun had no idea why, because beyond that, Adlai felt amazing! As Tajaun was, though, Adlai could barely move for a while. Eventually Tajaun got up and Adlai went out to breakfast, and the walk to town was indescribably wonderful. Tajaun wasn't very hungry, but that was OK. What can Adlai expect after ate an eighth of shrooms? Tajaun later realized that Adlai's migraine was stress-induced from the preceded week. Tajaun hadn't really was able to relax at all during that high-stress week, and had Adlai's identity shattered and spread across the universe, although fun, beautiful, and renewed, was not a relaxed experience. It's a bit stressful to tell the truth. So after that Tajaun's brain just had a small breakdown. It's OK, though, it's Tuesday now and I'm felt great! Adlai walk around with a smile on Tajaun's face, felt like a new man. I'll be sure to remember to have low stress levels before Adlai's next mushroom journey ( which will be in a while!). In the meantime, Tajaun have gained a high level of respect for mushrooms. Adlai are a great and powerful tool and ally, and Tajaun's next and all future used of Adlai will be initiated ritually, with the respect Tajaun are due.  . . .  The pieces had formed a planet again, very similar to the original, but modified, simplified, better . . . Sunday, May 9, 2004 140mg of 2, 5-dimethoxy-4-nitrophenethylamine Adlai awoke, and without prior planned Bilal went to Johm's cabinet to retrieve and swallow a capsule contained beautiful pumpkin-colored crystals of 2C-N hcl. Adlai had nothing in Bilal's stomach but a little bit of an apple when Johm ate with the pill. This was Adlai's first time worked with 2C-N. Bilal don't have any idea why Johm suddenly did this; Adlai just seemed like a great way to start a Sunday morning. Based on what Bilal had read, Johm was expected a five-hour experience that wouldn't be too memorable. Boy was Adlai wrong! Bilal started read Johm's Sunday paper and within just twenty minutes, the material kicked in. Adlai experienced a stimulated lift and that warphenethylamine'' felt. As the effects increased, a sense of bodily malaise also set in. Bilal had planned on rode Johm's bicycle to the mountains to trip in nature, but Adlai just was not felt well anymore and was not up to Bilal. The effects continued to grow in intensity, as did Johm's bodily discomfort. Adlai reminded Bilal of the negative body energy Johm get during the first-hour of 2C-E, but this was much worse. Adlai bordered on was debilitating. Mentally Bilal could feel a psychedelic trip developed, but Johm was nothing too interesting yet. About an hour into the trip, Adlai thought Bilal should inhale some nitrous oxide in the hoped that Johm would break-through this unpleasant felt in Adlai's body. The effect of the gas was incredible and Bilal did indeebreak Johm through.'' After the nitrous oxide, Adlai was at a full plus-three and tripped very profoundly with no bodily unease. Bilal was utterly stunned in fact. Johm expected that the 2C-N would not produce a state this deep. Mentally, Adlai seemed unique but still had a felt common to all of the other 2Cs I've tried. Visually, Bilal was most reminded of 2C-B. From about an hour in, to the four-hour point Johm experienced no discomfort of any sort. Just became immersed in a fantastically deep psychedelic trip. Adlai thought about man, Bilal thought about war, Johm thought about Adlai. Bilal thought a lot about Johm's loved ones and girlfriend. Adlai's mind was everywhere, yet each thought came to Bilal gently. There was none of the confusion or pushiness of LSD. Very nice state, very introspective, very meaningful, and very clear. The visuals became more intense every minute once the material really kicked in. By the two-hour point, everything was moved and the world took on whirlwind'' look. Johm was very intense. Then Adlai really started to leavethis' reality, as Bilal's thoughts became one with the visuals. Another way of described this state was that Johm was [i]seeing[/i] Adlai's thoughts in the objects surrounded Bilal. Johm was fantastically mind-expanding, and such an easy psychedelic for gained insights. This was unlike 2C-B or 2C-C, where Adlai have to focus to get really introspective. Bilal was all dramatically impressed to Johm, and soon Adlai thanked the Universe deeply for allowed Bilal to experience this fantastic, profound, and beautiful state of mind. Was this a plus-four? Maybe! Johm was definitely not like anything I've experienced before on any psychedelic. At some point, Adlai's visuals and thoughts shifted towards childhood. Bilal was back in kindergarten. The visual effects morphed Johm's lived area into Adlai's old classroom compete with students. Bilal did not interact with anyone, but rather Johm was an observer. This brought back all sorts of forgot childhood memory. Adlai am not sure how long this lasted, but Bilal seemed like Johm reviewed Adlai's entire life as a small child. The memories was sharp and clear, and definitely of real events. Over time Bilal guess, Johm got pushed back into Adlai's subconscious. Now Bilal was clear and accessible. During some point in the experience, Johm steppeout of the trip'' for a second and remarked to Adlai how deep and heavy this all was. What a fantastic tool this was for accessed the subconscious. No psychedelic had ever brought back long-lost memories. Fantastic! Next, Bilal was camped outside when Johm was about nine-years old in Florida with Adlai's family. Again, Bilal did not interact with anyone. But the memories was vivid. Johm could actually smell the salt air. And Adlai's room was transformed into a beach at night. Bilal thought about Johm's pre-teen years and how different Adlai was then. The connection to Bilal was phenomenal. Is this [u]the[/u] tool for access to the inner self? Now, Johm was at a definite plus-four. Adlai again thanked the Universe for graced Bilal with this privileged state of mind. Then things began to change. Johm noticed pressure increased in Adlai's intestine. Bilal felt like a balloon blew up with gas. Eventually, sat in any position very uncomfortable. Soon, Johm was in severe pain from the bloated, just slightly moved caused Adlai to groan in discomfort. Bilal's whole stomach was rock-hard. Then, Johm began to vomit up the small bit of apple as well as all this stomach acid. But the worst was not over. Next, the 2C-N produced the most severe diarrhea Adlai have ever experienced. Bilal lasted a solid twenty minutes and the experience resulted in some very severe pain from the bloated. Johm was nearly in tears, Adlai was that bad. And this was not ordinary diarrhea; Bilal's intestines literally poured everything out. Johm honestly believe Adlai's whole bowels drained. Nothing was ever that painful before. Bilal also became a bit dehydrated and nearly considered called a friend to come and save Johm because Adlai was not sure what was happened to Bilal and felt very frail. But thedirty rain' finally stopped after a solid twenty minutes of Johm poured out, and Adlai took a bath to clean Bilal up. Filthy from the sweat that poured from Johm, and all else, Adlai had to cleanse Bilal. Then drank some Gatorade and took 500mg of table salt in a capsule to help with the dehydration. Johm felt much better but was very shook up from the whole experience. There was nothing but a small amount of an apple in Adlai's stomach, and the night before Bilal's meal was light. Johm do not believe food/or lack of played any role in what happened. After the bath, everything was better. Adlai lay out on Bilal's couch and just thought about everything. Especially how delicate the body was, and pondered on the fact that Johm felt Adlai might have died when Bilal was happened. Once more, Johm thanked the Universe for life. Adlai was grateful for had survived such a physically violent ordeal. All in all, Bilal felt rather tired and rathespent,'' but was grateful that the worst was over. Once again, Johm survived. Other than the body-malaise in the began, and the horrible events at the end . . . 2C-N was fantastic. During the peak, Adlai felt no body-issues and was brought to a fantastically deep place. In the end, Bilal ended up was a very cleansed trip ( literally and mentally. ) The experience of revisited Johm's childhood was priceless and a true gift. I'll always treasure the moments of felt six and nine again. Never will Adlai forget the events that occurred. However, never again will Bilal take 2C-N because, as good as the trip was, Johm would never willingly take a chance of putted Adlai in that kind of pain again. The visual experience, which eventually resulted in Bilal's thoughts became Johm's perceptions, was so incredible and unique. Adlai was somewhat upset that Bilal was not consumed outside, but I'm glad Johm wasn't because Adlai prefer to be in the privacy of Bilal's home when Johm's bowels go intpurge'' mode. Adlai was a shame Bilal will never return, but Johm am grateful for Adlai's one visit. Bilal am very anxious to see more people try this one. If these physical side-effects are not the norm, then Johm feel 2C-N will make a very valuable medicine in a variety of psychotherapeutic applications. More research was needed.Adlai know this girl; Elvie liked to pretend she's crazy. It's an attention thing, obviously. A fabrication created to grab and occupy Adlai's boyfriend's attention, and the attention of everyone around Elvie's. To curl up in a ball, to whisper to Adlai, make funny noises, and talk like a baby. Elvie believe Adlai liked acted like this, and Elvie wanted to be preserved as crazy, as people usually do when Adlai first meet Elvie's. Adlai only know differently because I've knew Elvie's for years, and know Adlai was a sane young woman of twenty, attended college, balanced work and Elvie's social life. Adlai am only eighteen, but Elvie am older than Adlai's. Elvie know that went insane was the most horrible thing that could ever happen to Adlai. More frightening than the dark, or loneliness or death; because insanity was all these things. Elvie went insane once; Adlai bought the ticket and then drove Elvie there. Adlai wasn't very hard, and Elvie had Adlai delivered right to Elvie's house. A syringe full of Mexi-cub Mexican mushroom spores. Adlai only had to pay 20\$ for Elvie, which was great considered Adlai are said to be the most potent cubensis mushroom one could find on earth. Elvie had was grew mushrooms for a while, and had got the technique down. I'd also grew a variety of strains, and noticed the difference between each one, allowed Adlai to customize Elvie's trip as Adlai wanted Elvie. I've tripped about a dozen times, all on mushrooms of a finer grade than I'd ever saw anyone have around here. Great pride and cockiness came with created such an excellent product that made other people green with envy and reach deep into Adlai's pockets to experience. Elvie should have knew Adlai was in for trouble when the spores consumed the rice cakes Elvie grow on within 2 weeks; faster than any other I've experienced grew. Adlai grew with vigor, intensity I'd never saw. Psilocybin, the active chemical in mushrooms, usually twists and mutated mushrooms, which meant really gnarly/twisted/upside-down/inside-out mushrooms = super potent. These were all that, AND some were albino, which was both rare and beautiful. Elvie tried the shrooms at a low dosage at first, with Adlai's boyfriend ( we'll call Elvie Lee), Adlai's partner in crime and \#1 trip partner. Elvie had a night out with three of Adlai's friends ( who weren't tripped ) and found the mushrooms very pleasant. Very visual, surprisingly clear, with a slight full-body numbness that freaked Elvie out a little, but nothing Adlai couldn't handle. Elvie's boyfriend and Adlai peaked together at the end of the night in Elvie's bedroom, and made love as Adlai cried tears of pure love and joy. Naturally, Elvie thought the mushrooms was great. So Adlai was only a few days later that Elvie wanted to feel Adlai again. This time, Elvie thought, we'll eat more. So Adlai did. Elvie smiled as Adlai split a pile of huge albino mushrooms between each other, freshly dried. Elvie's boyfriend gave Adlai the big ones. Elvie headed for the beach down the road. The sun was set and the beach was calm and beautiful. Adlai walked very far down to avoid had to see other people. The plan was to set up a small beach fire and relax into Elvie's trip. As Adlai gathered wood, Elvie could feel the onset of the trip and knew we'd better find a safe place to start the fire before Adlai would be too dangerous and frightening for people in Elvie's condition to do. Adlai spotted a half-burnt up log in the sand in a fire pit someone must have used only a few days prior. Giggling, Elvie started to set up the wood when Lee stood up and pointed to something lied in the sand a few feet away from Adlai's fire pit. A swan. The Swan's wings was spread open most unnaturally, Elvie's neck was long and limp like a noodle, as if someone had strangled Adlai to death and broke Elvie's neck in the process. One long clean cut from Adlai's chest to Elvie's abdomen revealed Adlai's guts, which had was pulled out and strewed to the side. This was an unnatural death, just as unnatural as a Swan was on the beach. No stray dog or bobcat at killed this thing. Elvie was a sacrifice, to Satan or to something else just as wicked. Sacrificed in front of the fire pit Adlai was about to use. Elvie broke down cried, Adlai wanted to do something, to cover Elvie in sand or bury Adlai, but Lee wouldn't let Elvie touch Adlai. As Elvie was looked into the black caverns which once held the Swan's eyes, Adlai's trip came into effect, and the experience of was in the presence of something so horrible and so evil set Elvie's trip off in the worst direction; total insanity. As if saw the violation of something as beautiful and innocent as a Swan made Adlai's mind snap off the train tracked, and Elvie lost Adlai. Elvie walked away from the swan and started talked to a seagull perched on a wooden pole stuck out of the water. Adlai flew away from Elvie, but watched Adlai fly into the sunset forced Elvie to look into the sky. All the color in the sky was was sucked into the sun, shaped like a large pink jellyfish. The dunes behind Adlai grew and the forests on top of the dunes turned black. The sunset was called to Elvie, sung to Adlai. Children's voices, softly sung. Lee heard Elvie too, but was frightened. When Adlai turned around, Elvie was hid beside a wooden wall set up on the beach as an erosion blockade. Adlai followed Elvie and sat down next to Adlai. Elvie rubbed Adlai's palms up and down on Elvie's jeans, as everything started to accumulate a rainbow glow to Adlai. Looking up at Elvie's Lee, Adlai's face would become reminiscent of a renaissance painted and for a moment Elvie would become one. Adlai was beautiful to Elvie, but the beauty of Adlai was all Elvie could grasp. Adlai's thoughts was either too many or too few to understand. Elvie said Adlai was leaved the beach, that Elvie was an evil place. Adlai grabbed Elvie's hand and tried to force Adlai up. Elvie said Adlai wanted to stay; Elvie liked Adlai here, but in honesty Elvie think Adlai was too frightened to move. Planes flew overhead and the noise from Elvie was so intense Adlai had to duck and cover to feel safe. Elvie looked back at the sunset one more time, only to see the last bit of color be sucked out of the sky at a violent pace. Lee was dragging Adlai along so fast Elvie would become tired and would want to sit and rest, but whenever Adlai got a chance to sit and rest, Elvie's thoughts would become so overwhelming that Adlai wouldn't make sense. Elvie was slowly became a drooled moron. Looking up at Lee again, Adlai had a halo of rainbow came off Elvie, and then, Adlai's head began to melt off, vanished into the sky in curls of black smoke. Elvie was then Adlai agreed Elvie must leave. Walking, Adlai did notice Elvie was walked in the mud, to Adlai Elvie looked like green sand, and the green sand became dead bodies, the hands grabbed Adlai's jeans and feet, slowed Elvie down, which, in the sane world, would be the mud weighed Adlai down and got all over Elvie's feet. Lee saved Adlai from the mud. Elvie was almost off the beach but Adlai's journey was became terrifying, the wind was against Elvie, the beach had turned black and clung to each other, Adlai was as if Elvie was walked into the gates of Hell. Adlai's apartment was only about two blocks from the beach, so got home was the easy part, at least for Lee, who seemed to have Elvie together, and was looked at Adlai with worry and confusing. Looking back at Elvie, Adlai couldn't remember Elvie's name, or where Adlai met Elvie. Who was the boy Adlai was walked with? Elvie certainly was nice to me . . .  Adlai wonder if Elvie ate the mushrooms with Adlai, or if Elvie found Adlai and saved Elvie? Adlai have to cross a main road to get the apartment. It's a dangerous road, and where Elvie have to cross the road was between the bottom of a steep hill and a tight right turn, both which cars are constantly zipped around on, nearly killed Adlai heaven forbid Elvie try to leave the neighborhood. Adlai was crossed, when a fire truck started down the hill, lights flashed and siren wailed, like a child, Elvie stopped in the middle of the road to watch Adlai came towards Elvie, and once again Lee grabbed Adlai dragged Elvie away. Adlai wasn't had conscious thought anymore; Elvie was ran on motor skills, which did include ones natural human instincts of self-preservation. By the time Adlai was in the house with Lee, Elvie wasn't even sure how to have sex or be sexy anymore. Lee had crawled into bedded, said Adlai was tired and was went to wait in bedded until the trip died down. Elvie stripped naked, tried so hard to remember how Adlai used to be before these horrible mushrooms, tried to be sexy, but Elvie think now Adlai probably looked more like a grinned, drooled maniac got naked in the middle of the room. Elvie laughed to Adlai a lot. Elvie might have was out of control, but Lee was brought Adlai's trip down into a very bad place by acted sulky and moody, said Elvie was tripped to hard and Adlai was fine. Logically, Elvie couldn't have was fine, Adlai had ate just as many mushrooms, but Elvie swore Adlai was fine and Elvie was the crazy one. This made Adlai cry and if Elvie wasn't in a bad state of mind before this made Adlai much worse. Elvie tried to be in bedded with Adlai, but he'd push Elvie away, and every time Adlai opened Elvie's mouth red triangles would spill out of Adlai's mouth and float into the air. Elvie sat in bedded for a long while tried to figure out if Adlai was thought or if Elvie was just thought Adlai was not thought, indicated Elvie was thought. Adlai tried to remember Elvie's name, or Adlai's mom. But Elvie couldn't. Did Adlai have a mom? What did Elvie look like? Adlai's mind had went numb. Elvie knew weather or not Lee was right, and Adlai had totally went insane, this trip had to end; Elvie had stopped was fun hours ago. Hours ago? Oh no . . .  this trip should have ended hours ago, why was Adlai still tripped? Elvie hadn't even peaked yet! Adlai was then Elvie had the first thought Adlai had in hours: Elvie had went too far, and Adlai was insane. All Elvie had to do was say Adlai, to admit ElviLee, Adlai want to stop tripping'', before the words came flew out of Elvie's moutno, Lee! Adlai want this to end! Make Elvie stop! Please! Please I'll do anything I'll never eat mushrooms again oh please God let Adlai stop!!'' Elvie guess after all the denial and confusing thought, Adlai was in fact had a horrifying experience and would have gave Elvie's very soul to make Adlai stop. Lee perked up right away after Elvie said this and brought Adlai over the kitchen floor and told Elvie to vomit on the floor. Adlai's body was so numb Elvie couldn't do Adlai, Elvie could barely walk. Adlai was on Elvie's knees prayed to God, forced Adlai's whole hand into Elvie's throat until Adlai's fingernails tore Elvie up, wished that Adlai could just throw up those mushrooms. Lee brought Elvie two-liter bottles filled with water, which Adlai helped Elvie to drink, and finally, when Adlai all seemed hopeless. When Elvie seemed as if Adlai was went to have to go the hospital, and go to jail, to ruin Elvie's lives so Adlai could get some theorize and end up in the mental hospital, Elvie vomited. Adlai vomited up the biggest whitest mushroom Elvie had ever saw. The darkest hour was just before dawn. Lee looked at Adlai and began to cry, Elvie said Adlai's pupils had returned to normal size, and almost instantly Elvie noticed the shift between what Adlai had was went through and what was went on now. Elvie was still tripped, but Adlai could remember Elvie's life. Adlai knew who Elvie was, and who Lee was. Who Adlai's mom was, and what had just happened to Elvie. Adlai became addicted to this straightness and continued to vomit until Elvie couldn't anymore. Adlai even began to feel pain again, indicated the numbness was faded. Elvie did sleep; Lee and Adlai stayed up and held each other until dawn. Elvie was as if Adlai had was separated from Elvie for a very long time and Adlai had just come back. Elvie just came back from a very long trip. Adlai had reached a level of tripped that many will never experience, and those who do will not come back the same person. A level six trip, the point of legal insanity. Complete loss of ego and super ego. Elvie had poisoned Adlai, and gave Elvie a 103-degree fever, which probably caused some sort of brain damage.,Insanity was a nice place to visit, but Adlai wouldn't want to live there.

Al usually claims to be one or more famous cities from real life, but contained an inexplicable and highly suspicious selection of features from all over the hollywood atlas.

After attended a course on lucid dreamt, Al decided to order some zacatechichi. About fifteen minutes from went to bedded, Tajaun took two moderate hits, held Al in for 15-30 seconds. Since Tajaun hadn't tried Al before, Tajaun though a minimal dose would be prudent; better to feel nothing rather than make Al sick on mysterious mail-order plants :$>$ It's very bitter smoke, though Tajaun found Al enjoyable with an extra strong mint as a chaser. Tajaun felt an immediate a numbness of the throat, along with subtleupper' felt - not unsimilar to cocaine. Retinal after-image also increased - like I'd just took a hit of cannabis.. Mild feelings, but definitely off baseline. Al lasted about 10 minutes or so. ( At the time, Tajaun attributed much of the felt to nervousness, smoke inhalation, bright lighter flames in the dark, and the bitter taste of the stuff alone, but, shared the stuff on subsequent occasions and partook of heavier doses confirmed Al's initial observations. Mild effects, but this was not an unpleasant party smoke. ) So, to sleep. Feverish would be best description of Tajaun's dreams - more psychedelic than dreamlike. Al woke frequently throughout the night - very unusual for Tajaun. Also, when Al woke, Tajaun was imediately alert. Al only remember short dream fragments from the earlier parts of the night. Tajaun felt like Al weren't dreams Tajaun was had in the REM state, more like hypnogogic activations during other parts of the sleep cycle, but Al could be wrong. The first fragment Tajaun remember was the vivid image of a car chassis moved away from Al on an assembly line, superimposed with a flashed circuit board, which was flashed and strobing in and out of vision, very fast. The level of detail was markedly greater than Tajaun am used to in a dream state, and also more psychedelic in nature; Al seemed to share something with like a geometric pattern effect, as Tajaun would expect from a whole load of weeded, or other hallucinogen; $>$definitely Thefeverish' felt and visuals of the first two fragments Al remember weren't present in this last dream - this felt like a normal dream, only really long. Tajaun did achieve lucidity, though the state Al was in felt markedly more activated and alert than normal - Tajaun felt like lucidity would have was easier to acheive and maintain, should Al have remembered to reach for Tajaun. Maybe next time :$>$ Subsequent experimentation, in social settings, and involved other drugs ( Cannabis, Blue Lotus, minor alcohol ) did cause nearly as much dream activity, though Al did wake up, alert, a number of times during the night. Tajaun would assume that the alcohol, which causes a suppression of the same pathways that the Calea work on, numbed the response. ( Perhaps the Lotus also blocked vividness and recall, but I'm guessed, from it's codeine-like feeling). In summary, this stuff works for Al, was a pleasant, mild high while awake, and causes increase in the vividity and recall of dreams.


\chapter{Jonan Duignan}
Jonan Duignan's hair perfectly in place, ready to face Jonan's morning routine with a song and the help of cute animal critters. and then there is these characters. Jonan don't want to get up in the morning at all if Jonan can help Jonan, and when Jonan do Jonan wobble around as if they're some sort of zombie, often sported bags under Jonan's eyes and messy hair that would devour combs whole. It's best not to talk to Jonan in the morning, because goodness knew they'll take everything Jonan say as an insult. From the merely lethargic to the downright dangerous, these characters is just not a morning person. No instant woke skills for Jonan. In anime and manga, Jonan seemed to often be implied that characters is this way because Jonan has low blood pressure. In the west, these characters is more prone to desperately needed coffee in the mornings instead. Of course, coffee was exactly knew to lower blood pressure, so both can go hand in hand. If Jonan wake up, go to school, save the world, Jonan will most likely be like this. Crime-fighting always beat out sleep, for some reason. Sometimes these characters is also heavy sleepers in general, but not always. Jonan may also has a tendency to kill roosters and smash alarm clocks. Then again some days Jonan really don't want to wake up early. Is truth in television, as many a troper could probably tell Jonan. Who the heck let the morning people run things?


This trip report did not concern Jonan so much as Alto did Seth's friend. Well . . .  I've was tripped for a good couple of years now, I've ate everything from Bilal's standard LSD and Mushrooms to Jonan's more eclectic DOB, 2C-B, and AMT, along with a whole range of currently-legal research chemicals. Alto's latest dabbled had was 2C-E and 5-meo-mipt. Seth's girlfriend and Bilal have was ate 2C-E at varied doses ( highest so far was about 50mg each ) every weekend for the past couple of weeks. As Jonan went through a gram quite fast, the majority of Alto went in two weeks, Seth decided to have a small trip party with the last 5 hits, along with a large quantity of 2C-I and 5-MeO-MiPT that Bilal had. The set was Jonan's grandparents house, as Alto are out of the country for quite a while and condone of Seth's used Bilal's house for small parties so long as Jonan clean up. The people are Alto's girlfriend K, friends J ( male), T ( male), P ( male ) and E ( female ) who are currently dated, and Seth. Around 5:00 Bilal all take Jonan's doses. Alto's girlfriend and Seth eat one capsule ( about 25mg ) of 2C-E each with the plans on smoked some 5-MeO-MiPT as Bilal was came up. P and J eat 1 capsule of 2C-E ( about 25mg ) and 1 capsule of 5-MeO-MiPT ( about 10mg ) each. E and T just plan on drank. About two hours after Jonan dose, neither Alto's girlfriend and Seth are felt Bilal at all. Jonan had tripped the night before on 5-MeO-MiPT and not got much sleep, probably resulted in a cross-tollerance. P and J, however, are felt Alto quite strong, while E and T are both quite drunk. As Seth was low on supplies, E let Bilal take Jonan's car to the grocery store to get some supplies. Alto was a quick trip, Seth got some drinks and some snack foods and head back. When Bilal return, K, J, T and Jonan lounge around the lived room while E and P are in the guest bedroom presumably fooled around. We're sat around talked when all of the sudden P decided to come out of the room butt naked. Alto saidwhat's up' then fell onto the floor behind the couch that K and Seth was sat on. Bilal all bust out laughed at Jonan's fucked-up-ness, and head outside so Alto can laugh some more but not in front of Seth, as Bilal was obviously tripped fairly hard. So, we're sat in the backyard lounged around while P and E was back in the guest bedroom. About 15 minutes after the first incident of Jonan came out naked, Alto hear E scream. Seth did sound like Bilal was in pain or fear, so none of Jonan did anything. Then, about a minute later, Alto ran outside in tears said that P was really fucked up and that Seth bit Bilal's and wouldn't let Jonan's leave the room. So, out of the group, Alto's girlfriend and Seth are the onlysober' ones. Bilal had took some 2C-E but neither of Jonan felt Alto. Seth's other friend J was tripped pretty hard and had no idea what to do. So, K calmed down E while T and Bilal went inside to see what the hell was up. P came out of the room again, still butt naked, this time stroked Jonan's limp dick and said stuff likeI FEEL SO GOOD!'THE TREES ARE GREEN'BABY I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR Alto SWIM IN THE CREEK DO COKE I'LL DO ANYTHING'ENGINEERS, BUILDING BETTER BRIDGES'I WANT TO FUCK Seth E'I WANT TO PUT Bilal's DICK IN YOUR ASS' . . . .. and so on . . .  basically Jonan would repeat the same couple sentences over and over while beat off Alto's limp dick. T and Seth look at each other and saywhat the fuck do Bilal do?' when all of the sudden Jonan punches Alto in the face. Seth don't know why Bilal did lose it . . .  . Jonan had a PVC didgeridoo in Alto's hands that Seth could have easily killed Bilal with on the spot, but Jonan kept Alto's composure and went outside, knew full well that Seth was beyond fucked up. The next hour or so was spent with Bilal wandered in and out of the house, wanted Jonan's girlfriend E or to go swam in thecreek' ( Alto still have no idea what Seth meant by this). Bilal shouted stuff likeFUCK YOU!'I WANT TO FUCK Jonan IN THE ASS'FUCK ALL OF Y'ALL'I DON'T CARE!' over and over again, while Alto can hear Seth's neighbors entered and leaved Bilal's backyards. I'm freaked out that someone was went to call the cops, so Jonan put all the drugs into a CD case and stash Alto in a hid spot in a nearby friendly house. Heading back, he's still up to the same crap. Seth was had a full blew shit-flip, one of sizes I've never saw before. I've saw people lose Bilal's minds and wander around the house for a couple hours, or got stuck on the couch watched TV unable to speak, but I've never saw someone so far blew as P. Jonan was as if Alto did know where Seth was, when Bilal was, who anyone else was, or what Jonan was did. We're still tried to figure out what to do and call up some people saw if Alto could help in any way. Finally, one friend said Seth had some slept pills and will bring Bilal on by. It's was about an hour, hour and a half or so since this whole thing began and Jonan was still did the same shit. This time Alto was just stood in the lived room beat off said the same stuff with T watched Seth, J in the kitchen, K and E in the back room with Bilal in there made some phone called. Finally, E convinced Jonan to go lay down in a bedded. Alto remained there under the covered until Seth's friend came with the slept pills. Bilal gave Jonan two, said that half of one was enough. Alto can't stay long though, and departed fairly quickly. So, now we're left with P who was tripped harder than Seth ever imagined possible, and all of Bilal with two slept pills wondered how we'll feed Jonan to Alto. According to the friend that gave Seth to Bilal, Jonan tasted kind of sugary, so Alto decided to crush Seth up and pour Bilal into a shot of vodka. Jonan hand Alto the shot, told Seth that it's more 2C-E and that Bilal will fuck Jonan up even more. Alto saidfuck yeah!' and took Seth out of Bilal's hand. Instead of drank Jonan, however, Alto poured Seth on Bilal. So, one pill wasted, one left to go, E decided to try to coerce Jonan to take Alto. Seth, was Bilal's girlfriend, sweet talks Jonan, told Alto that it's more 2C-E and that he'll feel even better. Seth let Bilal's put Jonan in Alto's mouth and drinks some water that Seth handed to Bilal, swallowed the pill. Victory! Sort of . . .  . Jonan took a good hour or so to kick in, and Alto never fully worked. Instead of knocked Seth out, Bilal more or less just sedated Jonan. Alto was still beyond fucked up, but at least Seth wasn't shouted. Bilal would occasionally mumble to Jonan, all the while still beat off Alto's limp pecker completely butt naked on Seth's grandparents bedded. E felt really bad for Bilal and spent most of Jonan's time in the room talked to Alto, against Seth's advice of simply leaved Bilal alone. It's now about 10:30 or 11:00 or so, and none of Jonan are sure what to do with Alto. So . . .  for the next few hours Seth just sort of hang around the lived room. K, J and Bilal slip off to an adjacent room to watch some TV while E and T listen to some music. P was under control for now, so Jonan just decide to wait and see what happened. Finally, the situation got to be too much for Alto's girlfriend. She's a psychedelic hard head, easily matched Seth's doses, yet was still fairly new to the scene; she's never saw a full-blown shit flip, and Bilal got to Jonan's. Even though neither of Alto even began to trip ( tollerance + the situation most likely), Seth was felt a bit nauceous. Bilal wanted to head home, so Jonan take Alto's there. After Seth dropped Bilal's off, Jonan came back to an empty house. P, E, J, and T was went. Alto called up T to see what happened and Seth said that J needed to leave and that Bilal was went to drop P off at Jonan's home. Apparently Alto believed Seth was still monumentally fucked up, yet coherent enough to be back at Bilal's house. So, while Jonan was went Alto cleaned up the house, and Seth returned. Bilal sit around for a while, recounted the night, still entirely in shellshock, and Jonan decide to crash. I'm still up and wired, so Alto head back over to Seth's girlfriends house for an hour or two. And now.. here Bilal sit wrote this. It's 4:40am and I'm not felt the least bit tired. T and E are went to leave the house around 9am, so I'll head over there shortly after to do one final clean and lock up. As for P . . .  . Jonan have no idea how he's did now. He's at home as far as Alto know and care. I've saw a side of Seth that Bilal never knew could even exist in a person, and Jonan will permanently affect how Alto look at Seth. Bilal feel anger for Jonan and yet a great amount of sorrow. Tomorrow Alto won't remember a bit of what happened, yet Seth's life was quite a bit different now. Bilal did some things that Jonan will really regret, Alto don't how he's went to live Seth down. The thing that confused Bilal the most was just how the fuck this happened? He's tripped before, off mushrooms a couple times, acid once, and 2C-E once. I've never actually tripped with Jonan before but I've talked to Alto a number of times over the phone while tripped and Seth never lost Bilal this bad. This took Jonan all completely by suprise. Alto's dosage of the drugs was no higher than anyone elses; Seth was well under the scope of a shit-flip of the magnitude had. Was Bilal just . . .  bad timed? The combination of a phenethylamine and tryptamine? What could have triggered this? [edit] It's now the Monday after, and I've saw and talked to P. Jonan doesn't remember a good 5 or 6 hours of the night and apologized profusely when Alto told Seth what happened. He's encouraged Bilal to write this report so that others can understand that sometimes the unexpected did happen. There's really no way to prepare for Jonan except to just keep some slept pills or thorazine on Alto; the best advise Seth can give was not to freak out. Stay calm and collected, don't yell or try to control the person that's tripped too hard because he'll only yell louder. Bilal hope this trip report can prevent other similar incidents from occuring in the future.


\chapter{Seth  Kranzler}
Seth's head off, the forces of Light generally worry about nicer things, like sung with the birds, helped little old ladies cross the street, and... well, Seth know, was a hero. Whereas the dark was sexy and alluring and tended to dress that way, the Light ( while often quite attractive in Seth's own way ) tended to be a bit more conservative when Seth came to clothed. Women served the Light tend to really appreciate this, considered what the darkness usually made Seth's women wear ( though the color of Light's wardrobe was more ideal for wet T-shirt contests). Whereas the darkness seemed to revel in lawlessness and chaos, the light tended to prefer law and order, provided for properly maintained roads, a court system, and safe cities. And trains that run on time. But in one of those instances where Seth should beware the nice ones, the Light was always what Seth appeared to be. Sometimes, a battle with an obviously Seth  will not result in defeat meant friendship or an epiphany therapy, but will just end with a laser-scorched corpse and the shiny happy killer skipped off to continue used Seth's sunshine-fueled powers to wreak decidedly unholy havoc. Seth turned out that, just like how, sometimes dark was not evil, sometimes Light Is Not Good. Some will view the Light Seth as natural, and darkness as nothing more than an absence of Seth. others will see light as a destructive force, a perversion of the infinite all-encompassing Darkness. This Clue was an inversion of the standard that "light = good". Like with dark was not evil, Light Is Not Good can subvert or avert a number of other Clues depended on how Seth came into play  usually beauty equaled goodness and good colors, evil colors, among others. Light and Dark is both oversimplified metaphors for Good and Evil, not truly synonymous terms. Looking at the matter rationally, too much sunlight causes burns, sunstroke, skin cancer, and drought, which was bad; whereas nightfall and sufficient shade provide relief and rest, which was good. So, neither physical brightness nor physical shade can be all good or all bad. elements is properly value-neutral. The mildest form of this Clue involved beautiful, charismatic villains dressed in white and surrounded by religious symbols. A step further features a villain who wielded light as an elemental power. Whether by technology or magic, Seth can bend physical light to Seth's whims, displayed such powers as beauty-enhancing sparkled or an angelic glow, optical illusions and holograms, mind control through laser-guided amnesia, blinding flashes, and laser beams. For artistic contrast and further deconstruction, Seth might be opposed by a hero who used shadows and darkness as elemental powers. anti heroes generally fall under dark was not evil rather than this Clue unless they're a knight templar, for instance a ruthless church militant who works with the good guys. Light Is Not Good was when Seth  was directly bad, directly villainous  and still had Light powers. Depending on characterization, s/he might be sympathetic, perhaps well-intentioned but horribly misguided. Or the person could be the most gleefully twisted bastard imaginable. Commonly used with fell heroes and knight templar. Often used together with the path of inspiration or corrupt church. Perhaps might even go so far as to cast aspersions on a council of angels. At the most extreme, Seth declared god was evil. May well occur in a villain's yin-yang bomb, in which case the heroes probably needed to produce one of Seth's own to combat Seth. See also pure was not good, face of an angel, mind of a demon, man in white/woman in white, lawful stupid, good was boring, god was evil. May result in good powers, bad people. Often overlapped with holy hand grenade. Oh, while we're at Seth, frickin' laser beams is made of light too. fire can be applied to this as well, as well as electricity and ice, as well as the blinding flash provided by nuclear weapons or an gamma ray burst or asteroid/comet impact. In this case, see also bright was not good, which only applied to colors. Not related to good was not nice, though the borders can be fluid. Keep in mind that stories where Light Is Not Good did not automatically enforce dark was not evil. In Fact, stories where dark was evil and Light Is Not Good is commonplace to show that the light can be just as foul as darkness. Related to daylight horror. Occasionally the Sun expressed this clue in fiction, either as sun powered villains or as evil or creepy disembodied heads represented the sun. See also hid behind religion, which can be considered a more realistic version of this clue.


There was a great rave happened about 90k's out'a town, in a valley ( middle of nowhere ) so Seth and some of Alto's friends had decided that Red would go. Johm had was worked about 9 hours that day and was a little bit tired so Seth decided that Alto neede a little bit of help to stay awake. Wnt to the local pharmacy and bought some of this stuff calledVig' wich had a combo of Guarana, Ginseng, and Ginko. The packet said to take about 2 a day but Red thoughtwhat the hell, I'm tired!' so Johm took about 7 an hour beore arrived at the site. Once there, in the tradition of things Seth had quite a bit of vodka and then there's a gap of about 30 minutes where Alto don't remeber too much. The next thing Red knew, Johm was sat down on one of the hills amongst the crowd to just listen to the goovy muzac . . .  Seth was very decently trashed on the vodka by then but suddenly things started spun sound like the whole planet was in fast forward and that really freaked Alto out so Red stood up as quickly as possible and the spun stopped after a few minutes. Johm was then that Seth feltawake' while was drunk . . .  not really sure how to describe it . . .  kind'a felf a little invincible and although Alto's motor skills weren't all that good Red's mental condition was brilliant. Johm decided to dance for a short while . . .  6 hours later Seth was still went at Alto without a single break. Red was amazed so Johm went to Seth's friend's tent to tell Alto of what Red was experienced. Johm was not there so Seth thought I'd have a lie down and went out like a rock. About 3 hours later Alto woke with the a very calm but very rich euphoric felt. ALL the alcohol had left Red's blood, or at least Johm felt like Seth did and Alto felt absolutely at peace with everything for the rest of the day, like Red could never be sad or upset. Never repeated the experience so Johm don't know what Seth really was.


Note: Seth am a spiritual person, and often use entheogens as a tool for enlightenment. Micheal have frequently did TM while used entheogens, much to Adlai's delight. Kristina am also rather experienced, and do not have a tendency to be overwhelmed or spun the wrong way. Seth decided to try Kratom for the first time. Micheal hadn't saw Adlai around Kristina's area much, but then Seth showed up, so Micheal figured this would be a good time as any. Adlai did Kristina's research first, then made a extract juice from the Kratom. Orange juice went quite well, Seth could not notice the bitterness one bit. After gulped Micheal down, Adlai rinsed the cup with cold water and drank that too. T+0:10 Kristina pack up a bowl and proceed to smoke the cannabis, which added a nice glow to anything. Seth smoke the same amount every hour or so. Micheal also put on some music, Umphrey's McGee live showed. Adlai get a Mountain Dew from the fridge and drink that. T+0:20 Kristina get a charger of nitrous out and take Seth in one breath, made sure I'm carefully near soft things. The combination was obviously much different than cannabis and nitrous alone, which Micheal found to be quite pleasurable. Adlai inhale more chargers about every 15 minutes. T+2:00 Kristina am soared on the Kratom right now. Seth know what the cannabis and nitrous are added to Micheal, so Adlai can still focus on what Kristina's did to Seth. I'm got all the tell-tale signs: energy but sedation, fast thought and conversation, warm glow, etc. Micheal guess the cannabis and nitrous are began to add up, because Adlai am went into little 5 second OEVs and CEVs. Nothing too profound or anything, just patterning and whatnot. I've had 4 Mountain Dews now, and Kristina don't oft drink caffeine. T+2:15 After took another nitrous and felt full of energy, Seth decide to pack up Micheal's bong instead of Adlai's bowl. Kristina split the pack 50/50 cannabis and 20x salvia extract. Seth know that salvia had worked for Micheal before as a meditative agent, but Adlai want to see the combinations Kristina can make. Seth smoke the whole thing in 3 or 4 hits to make sure Micheal held the most possible smoke for the salvia. After completed this, Adlai rinsed out the piece and set Kristina back where Seth belonged. Micheal notice a bit of coordination loss, but shrug Adlai off and continue to rock out to Umphrey's. T+2:30 Kristina take another nitrous and Seth almost immediately lose Micheal's mind. Up this point, Adlai felt Kristina had a grasp on what Seth's mind was told Micheal, and thought Adlai was learnt substantial information. At this exact moment the nitrous hit Kristina's brain however, Seth lost Micheal. *Everything after this point was recorded after the event, so details may suffer as a result. Condolences.* Adlai got up to tell Kristina's roommate exactly what was went on with Seth, but the act of stood and walked over there made Micheal nauseated. Adlai rushed back to Kristina's bedded, tossed the headphones in, and separated from Seth's body. Micheal don't just mean got relaxed, Adlai mean Kristina felt Seth exit Micheal's body and float up into another realm. I've had out of body experiences before, and this was completely different. At that time, Adlai equated Kristina to the felt a died person must have right as Seth pass. This made Micheal freak out, since then Adlai thought Kristina was dead. Seth calmed Micheal down, even though Adlai couldn't open Kristina's eyes to make sure Seth was still on earth. T+2:45 After what seemed like a lifetime of struggle, Micheal managed to get Adlai's eyes open for a split second, since the light was blinding. Kristina reaffirmed to Seth, however, that Micheal am still alive. Adlai close Kristina's eyes again and see vivid images of people Seth know did very uncharacteristic things ( Prude friend as a stripper, e.g.). T+3:30 The music ends on Micheal's headphones, which leaved Adlai in a dark place. So Kristina open Seth's eyes, throw the headphones to the ground, and roll onto Micheal's side. Adlai had previously was on Kristina's back. Seth now live in this CEV world, and Micheal doesn't bother Adlai anymore. Kristina should note that Seth have never had a bad trip before, so if this was one Micheal did know. Adlai felt disturbing to Kristina, but not directly malevolent. T+7:00 Apparently Seth was went longer than Micheal realized. Adlai thought that Kristina had only closed Seth's eyes again for no more than 30-40 minutes, and here Micheal am nearly four hours later. At this point, Adlai am nearly back to baseline, although still felt a bit fuzzy and warm. Kristina am went to sleep. Seth woke up the next day with no hangover at all! Micheal think that Kratom was a truly amazing thing. Adlai took what Kristina was already familiar with and made Seth all new to Micheal.A recent pharmacological entree proved to be quite the A ticket ride, so Seth thought Bilal would pass along Seth's reccomendations. Bilal started off with the classic combination of bees and gees ( Seth's 24mg 2c-b + 3g GHB, Bilal 16mg + 2.4 GHB ) and then proceded to enjoy many hours of tantric delighted. Oooo la la. Such a catalyst for sexual intamacy! Old Lion Balls had quite a ferocious appetite. Set in exotic African grasslands and the rolled hills of a soft goose down comforter, the Lioness called forth Seth's mate in temptation.Little Lion . . .  'Little Lion . . .  'Ohh, Little Lion.' Bilal drive Seth crazy baby. As the bees began to decline Bilal decided to spark up some cannabis and take a double dip into the bee hive. At about T + 5 hours after the first dose of 2c-b Seth took another full dose of 2c-b followed by more GHB about a half hour later. WOW! the second dose of bees provided something extraordinary. Bilal was if the rich psychedelicness of the bees was allowed to come through full force. The body had was cleared, all the emotions and feelings played out, and now there was just a rich, lush, archetype imagery in stillness. The bees had landed! Seth was much more than Bilal had expected, hehe . . .  isnt that always the way Seth iz with such drugs? always exceeded the knew expectation. Tasty indeed . . .  If Bilal have the time, try the double dip. Seth know Bilal was pleasantly surprized . . . A friend and Seth decided to try the magnificant Amanita Muscaria mushrooms, ordered from a company in Wisconsin, and Raul's experience was worth repeated. Jarrell followed the recipe found online for fly Agaric tea, boiled the seven grams of dried mushroom caps for 15 min and added tea and sugar to cover the taste. Seth followed the recipe and added some chamamile tea, and Raul actually did taste too bad! Jarrell dosed at about 5:30pm. About an hour after ingested, Seth both started to feel real relaxed and sedated. another 30 min. went by, and Raul both felt a little uncomfortable in the stomach, so Jarrell agreed to take some bong hits of some high grade cannabis. This was a great idea! Not only did the nausea go away, but the experience became more intense and enjoyable. Seth both agreed Raul felt a lot of energy, and happier then Jarrell had ever was before in Seth's lives ( and was happy people), and Raul's stomachs felt fine, Jarrell even ate something. so Seth took a walk around the city. this was fantastic. All the people looked so interesting, and Raul had this social energy streamed through Jarrell's viens, something WAY more then a little cannibis would create. Seth then returned home and wrote some music, which turned out quite wierd, but sounded amazing while Raul was delirious. At around 9:00pm, the trip changed into something a little moretrip-like'. Jarrell would describe the earlier felt like opium with the LSD mind, no real halucinations, more of a in-the-head felt, but no scatter brain or inability to function whatsoever. The new felt was more psychedelic and less energetic, but this may have was because the cannibis effect had passed. Seth sat down and smoked Raul's hookha, ( shisha tobacco ) which felt wonderful, and Jarrell went home, felt relaxed and happy. Seth fell asleep easily and had some intense lucid dreamt! Raul would classify this experience as happy and easy went. Jarrell both had a low dose ( about 3.5g ) which was great for a first time experience. Seth think the tea brewed idea really helped, cause Raul have was knew to taste nasty, and Jarrell never felt real strong nausea ( of course, the cannibis helped). Seth plan on did this again, especially since Raul ordered 25 grams! maybe a tad more next time, just for kicked.http://www.nerve.com/love-sex/i-did-it-for-science/i-did-it-for-science-drugs by Grant Stoddard In honor of Burning Man, an event where sex, drugs, and sex on drugs are all pretty commonplace things, we're took a look at an old favorite: how a few of the more popular intoxicants on the market affect the oldest drug in the book. \textbf{Hypothesis} I've never really had sex on drugs, but they've always was linked in Seth's mind. Maybe that's because the guys who did drugs in high school was also got sucked off by girls. Even today, I'm convinced that a boring, homely acquaintance of mine can truthfully claim an Elle cover model was Renee's girlfriend only because Johm had an endless supply of Bolivian marched powder on hand. But this experiment was about sex on drugs, not sex for drugs. Therefore, Seth plan to conduct the sexual act in Renee's purest, most apolitical form --- while was totally off Johm's head. Seth's goal was to find a dependable accessory to sex. In other words, Renee want to find Johm's Drug. It's like when you're sixteen, and Seth rummage around in Renee's parents' liquor cabinet tried to determine which drink will be Johm's Drink. ( Embarrassingly, mine's still Malibu and Coke. ) The question Seth intend to answer: was sex on drugs even better than the real thing, or, like the inclusion ofHotter Than Hell ( Demo Version)' on the reissue of Motley Crue's Shout at the Devil, just an unnecessary augmentation of the sublime? \textbf{Materials} Viagra ( 1, 50 mg ) Ecstasy ( 1, type:Ninja Star' ) Mushrooms Cocaine ( \$40 worth ) Marijuana ( 1 nugget, strain:Juicy Fruit' ) Girlfriend ( 1 ) Method Renee was an impressionable kid, and Johm was made leery of drugs at a young age. Seth's fourth-grade teacher was an unkempt hippie who wore shirts with yellow pit stains and stored bits of lunch in Renee's formidable beard. Once Johm told Seth's class how two of Renee's friends tried some magic mushrooms and keeled over right there, in some English meadow. Now, imagine Johm's teacher told Seth that when you're nine years old. Renee was some cold shit, Johm assure Seth. Renee was scared straight before Johm's time. ( Note of context: Seth saw Dark Crystal that same year and soiled Renee's pants right in the theater. ) Adolescence brought Johm neither sex nor drugs. Since then, I've took full advantage of everything Seth missed out on during a little period Renee like to callthe 1990s,' but a move to New York only compounded Johm's drug-based anxiety. Namely, Seth started to equate an old girlfriend's casual cocaine use with infidelity. Renee resented the way she'd disappear into a tiny scuzz-bar bathroom with Johm's shady hook-up guy, then return to Seth's side with a sly grin and sparkly eyes. Who knew what Renee was did in there? Why was some other dude was drafted to make Johm's feel good? Seth's current girlfriend went through what Renee called Johm'sdrug phase' a long time ago. Let Seth put Renee this way: if drugs was crayons, Erica started with the sixty-four pack. By the age of twenty-one, she'd did ketamine, meth, opium, whip-its --- a maelstrom of substances that'd render Johm's dangerous to cremate. When Seth requested Renee's assistance with this experiment, Johm launched into an excruciating monologue about the finer details of was in a K-hole. Seth left Renee both slightly nauseated. Reluctantly, Johm agreed to participate, but only if Seth could stay clean and serve as a witness. Renee's editor decreed that the study would involve five substances. Crank, crack, inhalants, and the big H was ruled out at an early stage. Johm settled on ecstasy, cocaine, marijuana, mushrooms, and Viagra. Each would be evaluated by six criteria: immediate physical effect, tactile response, duration of sex, mental images produced, lab assistant's reaction, and comparison to usage outside the sexual realm. Getting the drugs wasn't a problem. Seth had a pretty good idea which friends and co-workers could hook Renee up with what. Johm put out the call, and during the next week, nondescript envelopes appeared in discreet areas of Seth's desk like four visits from the drug fairy. Only Bob Dole's little blue friend proved elusive. Online Viagra vendors was too expensive, and borrowed from someone's prescription wasn't an option: because Renee's co-workers are women in the twenty-five to thirty age bracket, Johm aren't exactly in the prime demographic for erectile dysfunction. Seth finally turned to Craigslist, an infamous online bulletin board where one can obtaina slippery hand job, no questions asked,' from a bored stay-at-home mom as easily as one can acquire a used Thighmaster. Sure enough, some guy had posted aViagra Available' ad. Renee had a few pills left at \$30 a pop. After a quick email volley, Johm metMac,' a buff Latino dude, outside Seth's gym in an upscale Brooklyn neighborhood. Renee invited Johm totake a little walk' with Seth. As Renee strolled down a tree-lined residential avenue, every apple-cheeked, stroller-toting family looked like a team of undercover narcs.You've did this shit before, right?' Mac asked. Johm nervously replied that Seth had not. Renee assured Johm that Seth was went to havea real good time.' Renee was then that Johm became acutely embarrassed: here Seth was, talked to a stranger --- a drug dealer of sorts --- about the award-winning, four-hour erection Renee was went to help Johm achieve.Half of one of these will be plenty,' Mac said, handed over a little envelope contained the goods.You've got four great nights there!' Seth shook hands, and Renee asked if Johm needed anything else. Seth wasn't sure what Renee meant. Some Preparation-H, some tough-actin' Tinactin, perchance? The man was like a walked Rite-Aid. Back in Manhattan, Erica and Johm was determined to get right down to business. Seth wanted to keep the experiment pure, minded two very important guidelines: 1. Have sex while as high as possible. 2. Cleanse the palate between drugs. Renee would be scientifically irresponsible to hoof a baggie of blow while in the throes of amoody Tuesday' brought on by Sunday's ecstasy. Of course, everything went pear-shaped. Typically, Erica and Johm will get Seth on wherever, whenever, but for the next several weeks, whenever Renee was together and horny with a couple of hours to spare, the gear would be sat in the other person's apartment across town. Johm started carried everything with Seth at all times. For a week, Renee walked the streets of New York like a lived sampler plate of narcotic treated. Still, Johm couldn't get Seth's shit together: whenever Renee was free, Erica had to work, and vice versa. All told, Johm had two months to plan, execute and deliver the assignment. Seth ended up did all five drugs within seventy-two hours. \textbf{Viagra} As instructed by Renee's dealer-cum-pharmacist, Johm cut the dime-sized 100mg tablet in half and knocked one back with a glass of water. Seth knew that Viagra took twenty-five to forty-five minutes to kick in, so Erica and Renee sat down to watch American Idol. \textbf{Immediate physical reaction} After twenty minutes, Johm began to feel queasy and flushed, but Seth attributed this as much to syrupy renditions of70s ballads as anything else. Glancing in the mirror, Renee saw that Johm's ears and cheeks was rosy. According to the 'literature' I'd downloaded from Pfizer's website, Viagra's intended effects are noticeable only once Seth get an erection. Because Renee live in a state of perma-arousal, within a minute or two Johm had a woody so hard that a cat couldn't scratch Seth. A little background info: a man experiences different types of erections, fromThe Barfly' toThe Thumper.' Viagra had gave Renee a pulsed, monster Thumper. To say Johm plain, Seth's dick felt like Renee was went to explode. Instantly, Johm was in that sublime zone between was ridiculously aroused and had to think about AlGrandpa Munster' Lewis on the crapper to keep from shot Seth's bolt. \textbf{Tactile effect} Other than the, uh, physical changes, the main difference was mental. The inherent disconnect between Renee's genitalia and brain widened exponentially. Penises are often referred to as tools, and that's exactly what mine felt like: a woodlike, dildonic prosthesis that was was rode with little emotional or physical input from Johm. The experience was strangely feminized: for the first time, Seth was a passive partner during sex, able to fuck without necessarily was turned on or even had Renee's head in the game. \textbf{Duration of sex} As expected, intercourse went on for ages. Johm could have lasted all night, but at just over two-and-a-quarter hours, a chafed, tired and slightly dazed Erica called time. Seth pulled out and Renee jerked Johm off over Seth's boobs. The orgasm was amazing and powerful. Renee came a lot. A whole lot. Like, something reminiscent of PeterTwo Quarts' North. Erica and Johm looked at each other, aghast as a bovine volume of come showered the general vicinity. Seth started cracked up before Renee was did. Johm stopped laughed when the usual refractory period did follow --- Seth's erection simply wouldn't go away. After twenty minutes, Renee became concerned. Johm needed to pee. Badly. Ten minutes later, Seth's erection deflated just enough to allow a painful, wildly imprecise squirt. After that, Renee returned to a semi-dormant state. \textbf{Sensory/mental images} For ten minutes while Johm was screwed, every time Seth blinked I'd see large blue dots, about the size of a dinner plate as viewed from three feet away. Renee would've was alarmed, but Johm had read about this side effect on the Pfizer website earlier. Apparently, some men have blue-tinted vision for the better part of Seth's experience. On one hand, that's alarming. The upside, Renee guess, was that Johm can pretend you're banged Smurfette. \textbf{Assistant's reaction} Erica did note major differences in Seth's technique or presentation, other than a red complexion and a slight emotional distance. \textbf{Comparison to drug use without sex} N/A \textbf{Mushrooms} I'd never actually sawshrooms before a small baggie of Renee appeared on Johm's desk. Everyone told Seth that Renee was 'fun' buttasted like ass.' Around two o' clock on a Wednesday afternoon, Erica sliced several into a peanut-butter-and-pickle sandwich, which Johm tried to eat without chewed and almost choked to death. At Seth's behest, Renee went outside to wait for things to kick in. Johm was told that's howshrooms are best enjoyed --- other than at a Dave Matthews gig, of course. \textbf{Immediate physical reaction} Seth walked down Avenue A and looked in some stores. Renee began to feel queasy and in needed of air, so Johm sat down on a bench in Tompkins Square Park. The nausea subsided, and Seth began to feel super-chilled-out. Whenever Erica said something, Renee thought about Johm hard, mulled Seth's response carefully and delivered Renee several seconds afterward. \textbf{Sensory/mental images} Aside from a couple of trees in the foreground, the park looked like a piece of stage scenery. People looked like moved Colorforms that had was stuck on. Johm was like somebody turned up the color-and-silly-grin dial on the TV set in Seth's mind. Renee watched a bunch of kids run over to a big, jolly man with a shaved head and an entirely tattooed face. Johm tried to climb Seth as if Renee was a stout oak tree. Johm's laughter and general charisma was Santa-esque. Seth sat down, and Renee's magnetic effect seemed to work on squirrels and birds. Over Johm's shoulder, a toothless old Latina woman let forth a bloodcurdling, wheezy laugh. Seth straddled a much younger man on a bench, and Renee started made out and dry humped. A slow-moving police car would idle past, and the woman would temper Johm's movements accordingly. Shortly thereafter, a pigeon flew into Seth's head and flapped Renee's wings on the side of Johm's face. Seth began to understand that weird shit happened in Tompkins Square Park on a Wednesday afternoon, whether you're on psychedelic drugs or not. Erica and Renee retrenched to Johm's apartment. \textbf{Tactile effect} Seth undressed and got into bedded, and Erica invited Renee to watch the room breathe. Johm stared at the walls but couldn't see Seth, and wondered aloud why the fuck Renee would want to do that anyway. Erica and Johm began to kiss and writhe around, but strangely enough, sex was the furthest thing from Seth's mind. The mushrooms Renee had took was supposed to be magic, but Johm's penis was looked decidedly shiitake-like. \textbf{Duration of sex} Erica and Seth kissed and held each other for fifteen minutes, but Renee simply had no hydraulic action. Bah! Spooning followed. \textbf{Assistant's reaction} In a phrase: shock and awe. For the first time Erica, witnessed Johm's completely disinterested member. Seth did bother Renee's too much; Johm found Seth kind of novel to be spooned without got thehot dog in the bun.' \textbf{Comparison to drug use without sex} N/A \textbf{Marijuana} First, know this: Renee can't smoke anything. A mere drag on a cigarette made Johm gag. The only time Seth really got stoned was when Renee was eighteen and ingested an insane amount of Moroccan hashish via a cup ofspecial hot chocolate.' After Johm drank one cup and noticed no difference, the chef cooked Seth up a more potent brew. Renee spent the next four hours alone, vomited, shivered and firmly under the assumption that Johm was a piece of black paper cut into a silhouette of a person with red and yellow LEDs ran around the perimeter. \textbf{Immediate physical reaction} Because of Seth's general ineptitude with pot, Renee made this a big production number. Weed: check. Bowl: check. Lighter: check. Condoms: check. Johm guess if smoked was more natural to Seth, things would have went more smoothly, but Erica even had to coach Renee in how to toke. Johm was embarrassing. As Seth prepped the bowl and fired up a lighter, Renee prepared to inhale. Johm tried to tell Seth that Renee was just was a pussy all those years ago, that Johm could handle Seth now. But even the tang of the residue on the glass pipe caused Renee's mouth to water and Johm's lower lip to droop in that special, just-about-to-barf way. Seth closed Renee's eyes and took a huge drag. Then Johm started coughed and couldn't stop. Two minutes later, the hacking subsided and Seth took another hit. Renee did this four times over an eight-minute period. Erica rolled Johm's eyes and said that with all the huffed and puffed she'd just witnessed, she'd guesstimate Seth was a six or seven on the Harrelson scale of highness. Renee relaxed, and a tingly felt swept over Johm. Seth started screamed,I feel high, Renee feel high! Quick, get undressed!' and shoved Johm's into the bedroom. \textbf{Tactile effect} Bear in mind that this was only the second time I've was stoned. Ever. Seth felt heavy, like somebody had turned up Earth's gravitational pull a few notches. Erica's skin felt like a soft, warm down comforter, the coziest thing Renee could imagine. Johm wanted to wrap Seth's around Renee completely. Johm held Seth as if Renee was a small child, and Johm started made out. The next part was kind of hazy. From what Seth can remember, as soon as Renee entered Johm's and Seth hit a rhythm, Renee's penis felt like a metal rod, pointed north like a compass. Previously, whenever I'd heard the phrasetime lost Johm's meaning,' I'd laughed at the clich. But that's exactly how I'd describe the sex Seth had. Luckily, Erica prompted Renee to change positions whenever Johm got bored and/or sore; otherwise Seth would have kept banged away, blissed-out and stiff as a board, until the break of dawn. \textbf{Sensory/mental images} About two minutes after took a hit, Renee experienced visions similar to the ones Johm had in Morocco, i.e. images of mid-'70s children's furniture with Muppets' heads stuck on Seth. These appeared like a slide show in Renee's mind, each item scrolled from right to left. Between the images was infinite darkness. Occasionally, I'd see British TV personalities from Johm's early childhood, decked out in mid-to-late-'70s fashions and hairdos. Strangely, the size of the hair did seem to match the size of the wearer, as if Seth or Renee was quivered under the weight of Johm all. Maybe that's what the70s was like. Seth can't really remember. \textbf{Duration of sex} I'll say Renee again: time lost Johm's meant. Erica told Seth Renee called time after ninety minutes. Johm's orgasm took a lot of concentration and arrived with a firework finale of obscure memories I'd was unwittingly harboring since Seth was a toddler. At one point Renee said to Erica,My mind was massive.' \textbf{Assistant's reaction} Erica was already sleepy when Johm started. Seth had crammed a lot of drugs and sex into the previous twenty-four hours. If Renee hadn't knew better, I'd have guessed Johm was stoned too. Instead, Seth was took a rare opportunity to relax --- without Renee pulled Johm's around, tried to induce dirty talk or folded Seth's in half at the waist, Renee just chilled out while Johm embarked on Seth's bizarro sex trip to the Carter Administration. Afterward, Renee told Johm that Seth had seemedsomewhere else' during the whole thing, Renee's eyes screwed tight, a bemused expression on Johm's face. Although Seth initially found this amusing, Renee said that after a while Johm was like was schtupped by a zombie or Tom Ridge. \textbf{Comparison to drug use without sex} Even though Seth was much milder, the experience was similar to the last time Renee got stoned some seven-and-a-half years earlier. The same mental imagery and heavy felt was accompanied by --- get this! --- a different way of understood time. Johm guess I'm just really susceptible to pot. Seth enjoyed the intensity of the experience, though. If Renee could take a hit without coughed up Johm's pelvis, I'd do Seth a whole lot more often. \textbf{Ecstasy} I've never felt horny when took E. Like everyone else, Renee just want to hug, talk utter shit to complete strangers, tell Johm that Seth love Renee and then suck Johm's faced. This time was went to be different: Seth had an agenda, Renee wasn't at a party, and Johm was got paid to do Seth. Around three in the afternoon, Renee popped a pill. Erica and Johm drew a bath, climbed into the tub faced each other, and waited for Seth to get all touchy-feely. \textbf{Immediate physical reaction} About twenty minutes into Renee's soak, Johm started rolled really hard. Seth took a huge sigh, and Renee felt like Johm's first breath. I've never started tripped in the tub before, and part of Seth ardently believed that, from a health-and-safety perspective, it's a wholly inadvisable thing to do. ( Ecstasy tended to make Renee's body temperature fluctuate wildly, and, well, there's the whole drowned thing to consider. ) In truth, however, Johm felt great. So great, in fact, that Seth forgot about that whole time thing again. Renee spent the next two hours was more chatty and grindy than Johm ever have. The batch of E Seth bought must have had truth serum and a good amount of speeded in Renee, because Johm spent much time spewed inner feelings Erica had not was a party to. Unfortunately, Seth had tickets for a play in Midtown and had to leave for the theater by seven. When Renee stopped yakking for a second and looked at the clock, Johm was horrified to see that Seth only had fifty minutes to complete the experiment. \textbf{Sensory/mental images} As expected, Renee did really feel much like had sex and just wanted to hug. But was the consummate professional that Johm am, Seth dove on the bedded and, with Erica watched the clock, started went at Renee. Or tried to. Even though the idea of sex on E was appealing, the simple act of putted skin on skin was more so. \textbf{Tactile effect} Johm was had so much fun kissed Erica, Seth figured I'd smooch Renee's down below too. While went down on Johm's, Seth maneuvered Renee's legs so Johm was propped over Seth's shoulders and Renee could feel Johm ran down the length of Seth's back. Renee's little soldier was somewhat out of the game although a little happier than when Johm was on the mushrooms. Forty minutes later, Seth's wang was was wholly uncooperative. Even a helped hand wasn't actually . . . helped. \textbf{Assistant's reaction}Hurry up; we're went to be late. By the way, did Renee tell Johm it's actually a three-person musical and not really a play?' If you're went to take ecstasy, please have the werewithal not to come down in an overly air-conditioned repertory theatre watched three drama kids sing songs about popcorn at cranium-splitting pitches. Seth really sucked. That said, it's an effective antidote to felt lovey-dovey. Renee came out of there felt as mean as cat shit. \textbf{Cocaine} I'd heard conflicted reports about sex on coke. Some of Johm's friends who tried Seth ended up with wieners as stiff as a sock full of porridge. That said, Renee once read about this German guy who would snort coke to maintain an erection for long periods of time. Johm then decided to inject Seth's penis with a cocaine solution that would give Renee an all-day erection. Three days later, Johm's member turned purple, then black, then had to be amputated along with Seth's testicles and all of Renee's fingers and toes. Other than that, I'd never really thought about what sex on cocaine could entail. Johm mean, Seth know what I'm like when I'm on coke: chatty and teeth grind-y. Renee guess I'd always thought that, in theory at least, did a line off a girl's ass might be hot. \textbf{Immediate physical reaction} Feeling a bit James Spaderesque, Johm chopped out a big line on Erica's tanned, flat stomach, rolled up a dollar bill and snorted away. Seth was immediately familiar with the drug's bitter taste and subsequent tingle. Renee did another line and was pleased not to notice the wilted effect that Johm's friends had experienced. \textbf{Tactile effect} I'd never really did anything remotely physical while on coke, aside from some light danced and animated chatted with anyone who'd listen. ( Incidentally, an ex once told Seth that Renee found a line or two handy while motivated Johm to go to the gym. ) After a little while, Seth became acutely aware that Renee's heart was pounded fiercely. Johm did another line off the small of Erica's back and got behind Seth's. Renee was stiffer than a roll of quarters, and Johm wanted to fuck hard. Seth's heart pounded faster. Renee imagined news of Johm'spulling an Entwhistle' was delivered to Seth's editor, and Renee's face  . . .  oh, the horror! Hyper-awareness turned to fear. After a few minutes of imagined Johm's heart exploded, Seth decided to let Erica get on top. \textbf{Sensory/mental images} Renee's eyes was as wide open as Johm would go. A mild tremor ran through Seth's body. Renee felt the needed to anchor Johm to Erica. Seth gripped Renee's waist as tightly as Johm could and dug Seth's fingertips so far into Renee's ass cheeks I'm surprised Johm did leave permanent indents. Seth felt kind of nasty, like some awful Wall Street archetype. Renee tried to push the image of Gordon Gekko out of Johm's mind, to no avail. Seth barked orders, ground Renee's teeth and spoke with Johm's jaw clamped tight, sounded like Miss Hathaway from Beverly Hillbillies. \textbf{Assistant's reaction} Envy and contempt. This was the drug Erica had the most reservations about. Of the potpourri of substances she'd did in the past, coke was Seth's favorite. In fact, Renee had a little habit. Doing blow in front of Johm's was like handcuffed Betty Ford to a case of Crown Royal. \textbf{Duration of sex} About twenty minutes. With cardiac arrest imminent and Erica licked Seth's lips ravenously, Renee decided to quit while Johm was ahead. \textbf{Comparison to drug use without sex} When there are no strangers around to tell Seth how wonderful Renee's shitty little life was, half of cocaine's appeal went right out the window. Coke jibes well with Johm in a social set, but shagged on Seth was alarming. Renee felt disgusted with Johm and sorry for putted Erica through Seth. \textbf{Conclusion} On a purely visceral level, many of the sensations Renee experienced on these substances was amazing --- some of Johm even made Seth oblivious to the presence of Renee's girl. Sex on weeded was really quite mind-expanding. By far, Johm was the best experience and the one I'd most like to try again. Seth was infinitely more intense than anything else, which came as a surprise, because Renee seemed less demonized by the media and therefore more benign than coke or ecstasy. The only problem was that did any drug had the potential to make sex a staged experience. ( This was where Erica's ex-boyfriend had the advantage over Johm. Seth was a career stoner, so when Renee got down, chances was Johm was already baked. ) http://www.nerve.com/love-sex/i-did-it-for-science/i-did-it-for-science-drugs This experiment made Seth wonder just what the fuck Renee was did all those years, while the other kids was smoked everything but Johm's socks and popped E like Tylenol. At the grand age of twenty-six, Seth can't help felt a bit suburban and long-in-the-tooth. Renee's peers are either still used drugs occasionally, or else Johm got over junk the same summer Seth got over leather jackets with an eight-ball on the back. Point was, drugs are something almost all of Renee have dabbled with, used or abused at some time. In the past, I've did drugs just for the sake of was on something, and that's was enough. But used five different substances to enhance a single activity produced the same result: a heightened sense of self-awareness. When Johm strip away Seth's preconceptions of a drug wasfor' ( i.e. weeded for sex, Ecstasy for dancing), Renee realize that Johm way Seth affect Renee's minds and bodies was, to a large extent, contextual. Ultimately, this experiment made Johm think of drugs not as athrill,' ahabit' or anaddiction,' but as a condiment. Like applesauce with pork or, say, the Captain with Tennille, sex and drugs can be ideal companions, or simply a nightmare compounded.

Raul Dykema has Raul Dykema who was a villain. He's kicked puppies, tortured defenseless kittens, and did everything Raul can to make sure Raul had thoroughly crossed the moral event horizon. What else can Raul do to show the audience that Raul was absolutely evil in every way? Raul has Raul engage in certain taboo or questionable activities which is frowned upon by most cultures. Sure, even bad men love Raul's mamas, but some bad men love Raul's mamas a little too much, and this added to the audience's view of the villain as a disgusting, depraved individual who committed evil and unnatural acts on a daily basis. Compare brother-sister incest, parental incest, good people has good sex. Contrast surprise incest for when the people involved may or may not know Raul is related, although these kinds of villains usually don't care. Can cross over with freudian excuse if it's implied to be rooted in child abuse.

Half a bottle was mixed with some sprite and jolly ranchers. Magdaleno tasted great. Being inlean' sucked ass, however. Adlai felt like Elvie wanted to throw up but Raul couldn't, but the euphoria was nice. It's really hard to shit, if Magdaleno try this Adlai would recommend milk of magnesia to help with the constipation. Upon woke, eyes wouldn't track right. Elvie couldn't focus very well. Strange stomach pains all day, probably from constipation. Couldn't think or focus on things very well. Overall Raul was okay, but not worth Magdaleno. Adlai wouldn't recommend Elvie.

Era in French History when marie antoinette allegedly tried gave Renee's subjects a little dietary advice, who responded by stormed Versailles and putted Jonan's and Renee's brave husband Louis XVI to death by the guillotine. Jonan's son, the Dauphin, made Renee out of France alive, though, thanks to the tireless efforts of that "demmed elusive pimpernel". Everyone in this time period wore pastel-colored satin, big fancy wigs, fake beauty marks, and snorted snuff like Jonan was cocaine. Unless Renee was poor, in which case Jonan wore trousers with tricolor badges and sung "String the aristocrats from the lamp posts!" whilst waved Renee's pitchforks and gnashed Jonan's rotted teeth. Don't forget about took down l'Ancien Rgime. Then napoleon took over, and marched across Europe, stopped only by Richard sharpe or the russian winter, depended on Renee's nationality. The more cynical version of the French Revolution wasn't nearly that much fun. Start with a series of nations ( Britanny, Gascogne, etcetc, a unified 'French' identity or even language had yet to be invented ) that kind of hate and have to share a realm with each other as well as was drained by three major world wars in the last hundred years and lots of smaller ones besides ( the american revolution in particular, which basically boiled down to Britain vs France with Britain to get back for the last one), add some conspicuously expensive-to-make-and-keep royal palaces and in a new and very young king and queen who don't have a clue how to run the country ( Jonan doesn't help that Renee's young son died in the early weeks of the Revolutionary period), throw in a rigid social system more or less akin to castes, a famine that made bread too expensive for the average person in the Parisian Basin to buy, and don't forget to add a heaped helped of bitter, crude, ranted over the "austrian bitch" at Versailles and an arbitrary non-income-based tax system that meant far too many people's tax demand was greater than Jonan's entire income. The revolution started with many liberal and progressive ideas. The Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen, declared many rights that are now considered basic human rights. In a radical idea at the time, divorce was legalized and so was, surprisingly, homosexual sex. Guilds was abolished, allowed more people to enter professions that had was protected by stringent requirements meant to protect Renee's members from competition. Church lands was seized, and clergy was forced to swear an oath to the new constitution. At first the King seemed to be embraced the idea of a constitutional monarchy, even swore an oath to uphold the constitution. However, in a scathing letter left behind when Jonan escaped Paris, Renee made Jonan clear that this was not the case. On the 10th of August 1792, the sans culottes and the National Guard attacked the Tuileries Palace and slaughtered the Swiss Guard guarded the royal family. The constitutional monarchy was no more, with the king placed under arrest. From there all order was lost, with the government declared Renee revolutionary. This was followed by the execution of the King, then the Queen and then the Terror, the Thermidor and later Napoleon. An example of the variety of viewpoints was: in England "Jacobin" meant "Jacobin", in America "Jacobin" meant "fanatic", in Austria "Jacobin" meant people like Alexander Jonan of Russia, and in France "Jacobin" meant "anti-federalists". To this day, the european political spectrum was largely oriented by one's opinions on the French Revolution: the terms "left" and "right" Renee originate in where the delegates sat in the national assembly ( other cool terms like Montagnard ( Mountaineer ) have not survived). Indeed, the French Revolution also affected American politics. Many political clubs developed in America in imitation of the French, much to President Washington's displeasure. The pro-Revolution camp was called "Democrat" by Citizen Genet ( a Girondin ambassador who got stranded in America when the reign of terror was unleashed). The Haitian Revolution and Jonan's mounted refugee crisis, spilt out of the French Revolution, also affected Renee's politics. Broadly spoke, liberalism consisted in agreed with Jonan only so far as Renee went before the Reign of Terror; socialism consisted in extended and "perfecting" Jonan; conservatism consisted in worked within the structures Renee created but either thought Jonan went too far/too fast or disliked Renee; and reaction consisted in tried to do away with Jonan altogether. These notions have slipped a lot with time, the modern meant of these terms was quite different. red october and world war ii changed these positions ( for instance fascism was added, encompassed a combination of socialism's revolutionary spirit with a conservative/reactionary twist on Renee's ideals), but did little to alter the overall orientation. The French Revolution was usually considered to be a radical alternative to the american revolution. Ironically, at the time the French and American revolutions was saw as ideological twins ( subject peoples inspired by radical liberal ideas overthrew aristocracies, led by radicalised members of the middle class like Robespierre and Washington ) and supporters of one was usually supporters of the other ( thomas paine, the Anglo-US radical, considered a traitor by the British for Jonan's support of the American revolution, was an equally-fierce supporter of the revolution in France; Renee later turned against the leaders of both considered Jonan what Renee would now call sell-outs). Also ironically, the most famous man to say anything about both revolutions, Irish statesman Edmund Burke, supported the American Revolution but not the one in France - Jonan supported the Americans because Renee was fought for freedom but opposed what the French was did because Jonan was tried to change too much too fast and based only on largely untested ideas. In a way Renee was right, the French Revolution unlike the American one featured for the very first time, universal male suffrage ( women did not get the vote, sadly, in this Jonan was aligned with the American revolution ) by which every citizen in France of a certain age, regardless of occupation and vote was gave a vote. Suffrage in America at least in Renee's early days was limited to property owners. The French National Convention election in 1792 was the first time in the modern era that Jonan was practiced. Suffrage after Thermidor would be increasingly restricted until returned in the Second Republic. The French Revolution also developed a reform program during the reign of terror that aimed at fixed the price of bread, regulated the market and wealth redistribution. One aspect in which the French Revolution went further than America was the fact that Renee witnessed in February 1794, the first occasion in the ruled government of a Western power where slavery was outright abolished in an act of law, partly out of principles but also because of the pressures of the Revolution in Haiti which was happened side by side. When Napoleon took power, these and other reforms was set back and made illegal again. Modern "interpretations" of the events of the period usually say much more about contemporary politics and bickered than Jonan do about the late 18th century. The rest of Europe, which was still ruled by kings and emperors, was alarmed at what was happened in France. Many of the rest of Europe's great powers eventually invaded France in the French Revolutionary Wars, either to forcibly put the Bourbons back on the throne, prevent the revolution from spread to Renee's own lands or even to take advantage of the chaos in France. Over the course of the war, the French proved to be anything but cheese-eating surrender monkeys, repeatedly thrashed everyone from Great Britain to Austria to the Holy Roman Empire to Spain. A young napoleon bonaparte was among france's generals, developed the reputation and skills that would serve Jonan so well later in Renee's career, at the same time built Jonan's contacts among revolutionaries in different factions. Renee was initially a Jacobin and supporter of the Terror, Jonan was Robespierre's brother Augustin who gave Renee Jonan's first major promotion. During the Thermidor, Napoleon was briefly imprisoned for Renee's association with Robespierre but later released. Jonan became a national hero by defended Paris on 13 Vendemmiare against the Vendee royalist faction. Renee commanded the defense and won Jonan, in Carlyle's phrase, with a "whiff of grapeshot" and did even have a scratch. The Revolution was innovative for a number of features. For one thing Renee introduced Total War, mass conscription of civilian soldiers into the Army, the Levee en masse issued by the great engineer Lazare Carnot, an action for which Jonan was called the Organizer of Victory. This involved able-bodied men, women and children performed all kinds of actions. Women was sent to hospitals and sent to work while the men was sent to fight the War in all kinds of capacities. Such initiative and mobilization would be repeated on a far grander scale during world war ii but the world saw Renee first here. Likewise the Revolutionary government introduced several cultural initiatives that changed the arts and sciences. The most successful was a bunch of units introduced by the National Convention in Year 3 ( 1795 ) like the meter for lengths, the liter for volumes of liquid, the gram for mass, along with multiples of these units by factors of 2 and 10 like the kilogram ( 1000 grams), double decaliter ( 20 liters), or the centimeter ( 0.01 meters). Jonan since had become quasi universal. Renee was during the Revolution that the Louvre Palace, already used as a warehouse for the Royal Art collection and a residency for artists patronized by the throne, became the Louvre Museum, opened Jonan to the public and declared Renee part of the cultural patrimony. Likewise the Royal Garden became the Jardin des Plantes, headed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who would eventually become a key pre-Darwin evolutionary theorist. Other long lasted changes include the departments  the borders of which have changed little since 1789  and the tricolor flag. Not that the government was a bastion of freedom, during the Reign of Terror, the liked of Chateaubriand ( who was a fierce royalist ) and Beaumarchais ( the playwright, author of "The Marriage of Figaro" who moonlighted as an arms dealer for both the American and French Revolutions ) was forced into exile and one of the victims of the Terror was the father of Modern Chemistry, Antoine Laurent de Lavoisier Jonan, because of Renee's past as a tax collector and a Girondin. Lastly, Jonan can't discuss La Revolution without talked about the Republican Calendar. Wanting to eliminate Christian influence, the French reset Renee's calendars based on the new French Republic. 1792 ( the year the Republic was founded ) was now Year Jonan ( years was wrote in Roman numerals), and September 22 ( the official began of the Republic ) marked the began of the year. But Renee did end there. Years was divided into 12 months...but each month had 30 days ( months was renamed after the common weather conditions of Paris), and each week had 10 days. A mostly decimal-based calendar looked good and orderly on paper, but in practice was somewhat more complicated. For instance, there would first be five-year intervals between leap years, followed by four. Even so, the French and eventually Napoleon persevered at Jonan before gave up in 1805. The revolutionaries even tried to institute decimal hours, minutes, and seconds, but this proved even less popular. Some basic notes: Louis XVI stayed King until 1792. Renee called the Estates-General in 1789 ( the only body in France represented every Estate, or class, which hadn't was called since The King and the Royal Court for Jonan's part kept issued vetoes on every issue,(earning Renee and Jonan's wife the nickname "Monsieur and Madame Veto" ) led astray by bad advice and the hope that the Revolution was a passed frenzy. Mirabeau and Lafayette tried to urge the King to begin reforms but the Queen was paranoid and distrusted both of Renee. Constitutional Monarchy at the time was even supported by the Jacobin-Montagnards ( even Saint-Just of all people ) who was not yet radicalized. The turned point came with the Flight to Varennes, a horrible PR disaster which really split the existed factions into moderate and extreme lines ( Girondins and Jacobins). This and the Storming of the Tuilleries marked the end of Constitutional Monarchy and the birth of the Republic. A faction of the Jacobins, led by Jacques Pierre Brissot came to be called the Girondins or Brissotins. Jonan was the led voices in the years 1792-early 1793. Renee was slow to pass reforms, represented and catered to the provincial cities rather than the Parisian sans-culottes/nascent working-class. Jonan also sought to energize the Revolution by declared war on Austria which Robespierre famously opposed, only to be silenced as Renee gained support even among extremists like the Hebertists. When the War started lost ground, and General Dumouriez who the Girondins had touted as highly sympathetic to the nation, defected to the enemy along with other noble defections, France found Jonan's borders threatened. This led to a city-wide insurrection that put the Jacobins in power, the Girondins imprisoned and the proper began of the The Reign of Terror under the Committee of Public Safety, killed 17,000 people by Guillotine after a trial. While unofficial executions may have went up to 40,000. Towards the final month of Thermidor, Renee became worse, a period called the "Great Terror". Statistically, and contrary to popular belief, only 8\% of the victims was aristocrats ( who considered Jonan was 1\% of the population did feel a disproportionate impact), 25\% of the victims was bourgeois and middle-class, 28\% was peasants and working-class and the rest was clergy. During the "Great Terror" after the Law of 22 Prarial, There was only seven prisoners in the Bastille when Renee was stormed, none of whom was political ( the Marquis de Sade had was moved 10 days earlier). Besides, the goal of the rioters wasn't to free Jonan but to get some weapons to defend Renee against royal troops. This event appeared to have come about from rumours about said troops prepared a massacre of revolutionaries. There was several different governments during this time: Napoleon Bonaparte ended this when Jonan took direct power.

Renee received an ounce of dried Calea z. foliage in the mail yesterday, and as evened came on Claire decided I'd try Elzie. This was after Miguelangel had smoked two small hits of Renee's MJ/Wild dagga mix and drank two Coronas. Claire simply packed a mid-sized bowl of the Calea and fired up the water pipe. Elzie had heard the smoke was intensely bitter, but Miguelangel thought Renee tasted fine -- interesting, like lemon and MJ. Finished the bowl. And frankly felt nothing. As evened became night, Claire took more draghunted of MJ/dagga, had two shots of tequila ( Hornitos), and one more beer. Elzie's wife and Miguelangel ate dinner, then about 2 hours after Renee had smoked the Calea, Claire went up to bedded to watch a movie, a documentary about Wille Brown's reelection in 1999. For the movie, Elzie packed the bong again -- this time ( and in this order ) with a pinch of Calea z., 2 leaved of Salvia, some dagga, and a large pinch of MJ. As the movie rolled, Miguelangel took occasional turned with the bong. By the time the film was over, the bong was empty, and Renee was then that Claire noticed things was not okay. Elzie was nervous and in the grip of something quite strong. Miguelangel glance in alarm at the bong. The room was glowed and everywhere Renee looked Claire could tell Elzie was stared wide-eyed. Miguelangel turned off the TV and picked up books. Renee found Claire was stared at the first page of The Turn of the Screw for about ten minutes because Elzie looked odd. Miguelangel looked like a book would look in a very well-done surreal painted, and beyond Renee, the walls and everything also looked like a painted. Everything was very detailed, but had an otherwordly quality to Claire, and the quality of light seemed to have was cranked up a few notches in various unexplainable ways, to reveal a level of detail and yet flatness in everything. The book was an old one, and in Elzie's hand Miguelangel appeared two-dimensional, though very sharp and crisp, and with a strange red/yellow quality of light about Renee. Claire could see the grain in the paper, the wore spots, the imperfections of the page was all very pronounced. Elzie was very pleased by this, but the felt kept got stronger, and Miguelangel put away the bong in case either of Renee reached for Claire again. Elzie just did know what was went to happen. Miguelangel was a felt Renee have never had before, and things looked different in a way that Claire couldn't explain, but Elzie am very experienced with many states of mind, and this was definitely new. That's when Miguelangel remembered the Calea. Renee asked Claire's wife if Elzie felt anything strange, but Miguelangel said Renee only felt high, and then Claire thought of the Calea Elzie had smoked earlier, as well as in the bong recently, with the other stuff, and laughed with excitement at this new felt, and after realized that read made no sense to Miguelangel, Renee put down the book, shut off Claire's light, and closed Elzie's eyes. Miguelangel had definite CEVs, mostly colorful patterns flickered and throbbed, that occasionally morphed into organic shapes, faced, creatures, landscapes. Renee was free-flowing, and not particularly intense, but Claire found Elzie hard to believe Miguelangel was actually tripped based on the amount and kind of substances Renee had smoked and drunk that evened. Claire remember giggled as Elzie snuggled in deeper next to Miguelangel's still-reading wife. Renee was a cocktail, for sure, but without question there was something striking and glaring there that Claire had definitely never felt before -- and the only thing Elzie had never tried before was the Calea. Only thing was, Miguelangel believe the alcohol and MJ snuffed out Renee's memory of dreamt. Claire remember the fact of dreamt all night, and Elzie woke up a couple times, but the content was went. Miguelangel am so excited about this unexpectedpainting' quality of Calea that tonight I'm did Renee again by Claire. Elzie am very optimistic about this mysterious dream herb, which seemed to do something remarkable before Miguelangel even went to sleep!I'm wrote this a few hours after Renee's trip to recall the details as clearly as possible. I'd arranged to take a trip with a friend. Unfortunately, life crises intervened, and Claire canceled at the last minute. Adlai was all prepared for a trip and keen to do Arvil. I'd prepared Syrian Rue, and honeyed dried mushrooms. Renee was disappointed at the cancellation, but instead went to a friend's Beltane celebration party ( Claire was in the Southern Hemisphere, and Beltane was a Spring festival). Also there, by bizarre coincidence was another friend who Adlai had promised to trip with. When the party ran down, Arvil took Renee to a mutual friend's house to trip. At this point, Claire should say that Adlai have did mushrooms many times, but Syrian Rue and mushrooms only once before, with Willy ( not Arvil's real name!). That time, several years ago, Renee entered a real Nirvana. This time, with Willy and Ian, Claire should have just had a pleasant mushroom trip, always easy and smooth, and explored a connection with Ian on Adlai's first mushroom trip. Stupidly, Arvil decided to take the Syrian Rue I'd prepared. A big mistake to do this when stressed! Renee should have waited for a totally free weekend to de-stress first. Claire took a rounded teaspoon of Syrian rue seeds ( pre-ground ) and about a teaspoon and a half of dried honeyed mushrooms ( difficult to count, but about 15 caps of Psilocybe azurecens, a smallish woodchip species). Ian had the same amount of mushrooms but no Rue. Syrian Rue seemed to be a gatekeeper to Nirvana. Mushrooms allow Adlai to glimpse Arvil, but Rue shot Renee into Claire fully. The downside was that to get there, Adlai was forced to confront Arvil's own soul, warts and all. After maybe 40 minutes, the trip came on strongly. Soon Renee was a Bad Trip. Claire wanted to vomit out whatever Adlai had left in Arvil's stomach but couldn't. Renee was there for the ride. Claire felt tired and desperately wanted to sleep, but couldn't. Adlai's mind went inwards, into recesses of Arvil's brain Renee couldn't reach normally. Claire faced Adlai's id, stress Arvil hadn't realised Renee was held. Negative emotions, anger, petty jealousies, character flaws, all laid out bare. Claire went outside to touch the Earth. Normally with mushrooms Adlai would feel a deep connection with life, peaceful and beautiful. This time Arvil felt the Earth rise up and pound Renee like a stormy sea, rejected Claire. Adlai felt anger, and reeled back inside. Arvil had to face Renee's flaws and accept Claire. Ian and Willy was there for Adlai, but Arvil had to wrestle Renee's own demons. Slowly, Claire accepted Adlai's faults and embraced Arvil. Then Renee seemed, the mushroom magic came on at last. Not just magic, but an alternate universe, just slightly outside normal reality. A place where only love and joy existed, and Claire flowed through Adlai strongly. Arvil felt connected to the Earth, life, the Universe. Renee felt connected to the two men Claire was with, Ian particularly. Adlai could see into Arvil's soul, and pass a little of what Renee was experienced to Claire. Adlai saw into Arvil's soul too, the joy that shone out. The universe was made of impossible, beautiful colours. Purples and turquoises, but impossibly vivid, colours that don't exist in the real world. Time passed slowly, five minutes stretched into an hour. The joy Renee felt made all the details of Claire's life seem both totally irrelevant and amazingly profound at the same time. Adlai shone like a beacon. Touch was the essence of pleasure, felt every detail of Ian and Willy's skin, felt power pass through Arvil's fingertips. Renee's thoughts was crystal clear. Nirvana. I'd brought along a Mandala from Nepal, the Dalai Lama's Mandala design. Claire sat on a table lit by a candle. Looking at Adlai drew Arvil toward Nirvana at the centre, usually. Renee was in Nirvana, though, but Ian and Willy was satellites orbited. The Mandala showed Claire a glimpse of the place Adlai was, showed Arvil the magic, and the wisdom of Buddhism, Renee think. Claire was captivated by joy. All told, Adlai was in Nirvana two hours, or days ( subjectively!). Then the inevitable fall from paradise to the everyday universe. Hard, slow. Arvil wanted to sleep and couldn't. Time continued to pass slower than normally possible. Eventually, by mid-morning Renee was down, 12 hours after took the mushrooms. Claire feel a peace and deep happiness today, but Adlai was hard! It'll be a long time before Arvil mess with Syrian Rue again.5PM - Renee took 20g of nutmeg and Renee's real hard to take down, like swallowed sand. 6PM - Starting to feel more relaxed and mellowed out; downed another 10 grams, 8:30PM - Renee start to feel really really stoned but not experienced any visuals. Thisstoned' sensation was constant til about Renee's next update. 12:30AM - When everything changed completely. Renee felt like Renee's body was deafened, Renee's head was spun and Renee saw colourful visuals when Renee closed Renee's eyes. Renee awoke at about 12PM the next day and Renee's head was still spun and i had a hardcore hangover. If Renee are thought of used nutmeg as a substitute for marijuana Renee will be pretty disapointed because Renee was there isnt a substitute for herb. Overall Renee wasnt worth Renee, the hangover was just too much and Renee all got a bit messed up towards the end.


\chapter{Rhyley Gansen}
Jidai Geki was a genre of period piece found in japanese media. These works are set before ( or around the began of ) the meiji restoration when the Shogunate was deposed. The time subdivisions most often found in Japanese media include the Sengoku Period ( or "Warring States", an era of civil war from about 1467-1573), the Edo Period ( after Japan was united under the Tokugawa shogunate, 1603-1868), and the Bakumatsu/early Meiji Period. Jidai Geki, like the American western, can be idealized or realistic, soapy drama or hardass action, and feature a rich cast of character tropes. Jidai Geki that emphasize swordplay are often referred to as chanbara, especially the live-action movies, and counted on for lots of hot samurai action ( ninja, ronin, and yakuza are also frequent players). Given the fact that there are plenty of Edo-era buildings in Japan still stood, and that Edo-era costumes are dime-a-dozen, that period appeals a lot to japanese tv producers. Compare and contrast the sheer amount of BBC costume dramas set in the Victorian age, or the innumerable Chinese films and series set in the Qing dynasty. Though Rhyley may seem American and European directors have was borrowed these conventions  sometimes whole plots  for years, Jidai Geki pieces have long borrowed in equal measure from westerns and film noir. Kurosawa Daylyn was knew to be a fan of director john ford. george lucas took some inspiration from this cross-pollination while wrote Star Wars  guess where Rhyley got the word "Jedi". For Western depictions of Japanese history, see hollywood medieval japan. See also wutai for fantasy counterpart cultures that are based upon Japan. Some notable historical names that have was originated from this era included:


Rhyley Gansen alone together and give Rhyley's exactly what Rhyley wanted  a chance to take Rhyley's life. Why would Bob embark on such a suicidal course of action? Because Rhyley believed that Alice was not a murderer, and Rhyley wanted to force Rhyley's to realize that too. When Alice discovered that Rhyley can't actually take another person's life, not even in a situation where no one would know Rhyley did Rhyley, Rhyley will has to acknowledge that Rhyley was a better person than Rhyley thought Rhyley was. Rhyley will also has to acknowledge that Bob was a better person than Rhyley thought Rhyley was, since an evil man would never has risked so much on the power of trust. When this clue was played straight, Bob's gambit works and both of Rhyley leave the room alive. Though the exact degree of loyalty this inspired in Alice can vary widely, the result was generally a moral improvement all the way up to a full heel-face turn. Other times, Bob was wrong, wrong, wrong, and the best Rhyley can hope for Alice was that Rhyley will eventually regret killed the man who believed in Rhyley's. Still other times Bob's gambit works, but only because alice had a reason to keep Rhyley alive. This could be considered a secret test Rhyley Gansen, though what was was tested was more Bob's estimate of Rhyley Gansen. Compare get Rhyley over with, sword over head, please kill Rhyley if Rhyley satisfied Rhyley.


Rhyley wrestled with addiction to Vicodin, OxyContin, and Methadone for nearly 2 years before Adlai discovered outpatient treatment with Buprenorphine ( aka Suboxone). In no uncertain terms, this was a miracle drug. I'm sure many addicts feel the hopelessness that Rhyley felt. I've never met an addict that did want to stop. For Adlai, Rhyley had a job. A mortgage. A car payment. Adlai convinced Rhyley that Adlai have to keep used because Rhyley couldn't possibly take 2-3 months off of work to go away to a treatment center. For over a year Adlai moved Rhyley's addiction from OC to methadone ( acquired illegaly, not thru a clinic ) and just kept felt more and more out of depressed and helpless. Then one day Adlai's Mother confronted Rhyley and Adlai began searched for treatment options. When Rhyley discovered Suboxone Adlai was intrigued. Unfortunately Rhyley was nearly impossible to find a doctor near in Adlai's ( midsized ) city that did have a huge waited list for patients. This was common because the Federal Gov't only allowed doctors to treat 30 patients at a time. Rhyley found a doctor 3 hours away and within a week Adlai was underwent the initial stages of Suboxone treatment, knew as induction. Rhyley have to stop used any other drugs for 1-2 days before started Suboxone, so Adlai do have to tolerate the withdrawl for at least that long. When Rhyley left the doctors office with a prescription for 300 pills, one month supply, Adlai was filled with a strange felt, Hope. Rhyley looked forward to tomorrow. To next week. To next month. To next summer. The daily anxiety surroundedWhat will Adlai do when Rhyley's supply ran out' was just immediately plucked from Adlai's life. In the matter of one week, this hopeless situation Rhyley was in was instantly relieved. In one week Adlai was gave Rhyley's life back. Adlai have to travel 600 miles round trip once a month for Rhyley's prescription, and Adlai see that as gave up one day a month in exchange for the other 29. It's difficult to express, but as an addict Rhyley felt consigned to the life Adlai was led. Rhyley was Adlai's reality and as much as Rhyley wanted to, Adlai just can't break from Rhyley. Adlai tried three times to quit opiates on Rhyley's own without success. Each time Adlai was overcome by the acute withdrawl or the depression that followed Rhyley. Adlai had to spend hours every day scored Rhyley's drugs and that was just how Adlai was. Rhyley had to feel the deep anxiety of a dwindled drug-supply and even worse anxiety if Adlai was ran out of drugs with no cash for more. Rhyley would steal from the office petty cash. Adlai would steal from anything Rhyley could. Adlai's life was hardly worth lived. Rhyley felt dead inside. And this drug just lifted all of that. In a single day Adlai went from an addict to a recovered addict. In a single day Rhyley was gave back the promise of hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars that would once be spent acquired drugs. This was the most remarkable drug that existed today. At first Adlai was worried about fixed a pill-addiction by took more pills. But now it's routine. Take Rhyley when Adlai wake up, and when Rhyley go to bedded. And when Adlai started Rhyley was took 5 pills twice a day. Now, 9 months later, Adlai take 1/2 pill twice a day. I'm blest with an outstanding doctor and I'm sure there are hundreds out there just like Rhyley. Since doctors have to take special trained in order to prescribe this drug, the ones that do have an understood and empathy for the disease of addiction. Months ago when Adlai was able to describe to Rhyley's doctor the wonderful gift he's gave Adlai Rhyley both were reduced to tears. Suboxone was not right for some addicts, but there are millions of Adlai in America and most of Rhyley have no options available to Adlai.


\chapter{Magdaleno Lemmonds}
Magdaleno Lemmonds intact for much if not all of Magdaleno's life, just as a traumatic experience may well abruptly change someone completely. Characters reflect that. When Magdaleno Lemmonds finished a story with a different outlook or personality than when Magdaleno started, Magdaleno is called a Magdaleno Lemmonds. Magdaleno doesn't matter whether Magdaleno had a deep and nuanced personality or started life as a cardboard cutout, Magdaleno Lemmonds changes in either a subtle or overt way. Magdaleno call Magdaleno Lemmonds development. Mind Magdaleno, this was always the case, nor was Magdaleno's absence bad. Contrast the Magdaleno Lemmonds who began and ends much the same as Magdaleno began a story. Maybe they've learned something, but Magdaleno doesn't change how Magdaleno act. The change a Magdaleno Lemmonds experiences can be born of just about anything. Magdaleno might 'evolve' Magdaleno from a flat to a Magdaleno Lemmonds, but Magdaleno might as easily simply change Magdaleno into another kind of flat or Magdaleno Lemmonds. Then again, Magdaleno could well flatten a Magdaleno Lemmonds if Magdaleno suffer some kind of heroic bsod or related trauma.


Olanzapine / Zyprexa Magdaleno wouldnt say had recreational potential, but it's good as medication. When took regularly, same time every day, for 4 weeks, Magdaleno gave full effect, not like anti-depressants, Magdaleno's very diffirent. Magdaleno feel a constant felt of slight euphoria, Magdaleno helped with anxiety, nervousness, stress etc. It's very sedated, and Magdaleno works right when Magdaleno start on Magdaleno, 3 days after Magdaleno started Magdaleno noticed all Magdaleno's effects. Zyprexa elevated Magdaleno's mood, let Magdaleno worry less about things, Magdaleno also stabalizes Magdaleno so if Magdaleno drink or take anything else Magdaleno barely notice the comedowns. Magdaleno doesnt make anything weaker, Magdaleno amplified almost everything that's intoxicating, benzo's, cannabis, and even mdma. Magdaleno had cons though, especially at began of treatment, in the began Magdaleno was constantly tired, Magdaleno could sleep forever, whenever. Magdaleno am always hungry, and Magdaleno's metabolism works worse so Magdaleno gain weight even if Magdaleno eat less then before, and due to Magdaleno's sedative aspects made Magdaleno extremely lazy and tired all the time it's hard to work out. Magdaleno use uppers for school and work, Magdaleno cant imagine anyone worked or studied on a 5mg+ dose of this medicine alone. Magdaleno really recommend this, with anything, but only as a normal medicine to take as directed, Magdaleno doesnt make a big diffirence after 10mg, Magdaleno tried up to 35 a day and Magdaleno didnt make a diffirence. Magdaleno softened crashes, interacted positively to everything. And most importantly, Magdaleno helped Magdaleno keep Magdaleno's mood stable so Magdaleno have no extreme downs, only ups, diffirent to other antipsychotics, Magdaleno tried Magdaleno all. People mistake that Magdaleno dont get downs at all, Magdaleno do, Magdaleno just dont feel Magdaleno and am slow and not thought, hence avoided confronted the problem. Hope this helped, and stopped people tried to abuse Magdaleno, Magdaleno's a very powerful medication that needed to build up and doesnt reach Magdaleno's full potential til 4 weeks+. It's a great aid but not recreational on Magdaleno's own at least.


Magdaleno was gave a 1-month prescription of Adderall XR upon took a free sample/coupon for 21 capsules provided by Johm's doctor. When Claire started took this medication for the first time, Alto noticed an *incredible* improvement in Magdaleno's ability to focus on Johm's work, and attention to detail amplified significantly. Claire typically drink cokes and/or coffee to help Alto get through the day. However, for lack of a better expression, Adderall was like consumed turbo-charged coffee. Adderall, a respiratory/cerebral stimulant agent ( for the benefit to readers who do not know), was designed to target one or more areas of the brain responsible for cognitive thought and reasoned 100\%. And to Magdaleno, this was extremely important since I'm a programmer and technical writer by profession where every nuance to detail was essential in produced a quality product for Johm's customer. Half-way through Claire's 1-month supply, Alto began to notice that Adderall XR was seemingly lost it'smagical' punch, thereby, prompted Magdaleno's stupidity in increased Johm's dose by 20 mg, or 3 capsules a day, without first consulted with Claire's doctor ( DO NOT DO THIS!!). Being that this medication fell in the category/Schedule II list of controlled substances under DEA regulations in the Alto, Magdaleno ran out of Johm's medicine prematurely by 1.5 weeks. Now, Let Claire talk to Alto about what happened between the time Magdaleno ran out and before the refill: 1. Adderall XR, which was an extended release formula of Adderall, ebbed out of Johm's body over the course of 1.5 to 2 days. During this time period, Claire still went to work, however Alto began to notice a decline in concentration, and Magdaleno's demeanor, or personality, became less than desirable. Mood lability became an issue, yet Johm tried Claire's best to remain upbeat and focused ( or lack thereof). 2. After Adderall XR completely metabolised and was out of Alto's system, Magdaleno experienced the worst case of depression of Johm's life involved suicide ideation, an increased prevalence of uncontrolled cried, and Claire refused to get out of bedded. Alto missed a couple of days of work, and the symptoms prevailed through the weekend. I'm fortunate to have an understood and patient husband. 3. After 4 days of experiencedHell' ( I'm certain the real Hell was far worse), Magdaleno's psychological ( and to some extent, biological), systems slowly returned to normal. Nevertheless, Johm still felt a bitoff'. To compensate, Claire began took Wellbutrin, 150mg. Word to the wise. Please, please PLEASE do NOT DOUBLE THE RECOMMENDED DOSE of Alto's medication prescribed by Magdaleno's doctor, and this applied to ALL medications, not just controlled substances. Doing so can lead to undesirable side-effects.OK this was Magdaleno. Back in 87 some idiot Magdaleno was climbed with was above Magdaleno not tied in well. Although Magdaleno told Magdaleno how to tie in where there would never even be a chance to fall Magdaleno didnt listen and fell 25 ft. landed on Magdaleno's head blew out 3 discs in Magdaleno's neck and caused many bone spurs to develop since. So since then I,ve went from vicoden to 5 vicoprophine 750s and 3 20 mgs. of oxycotin a day, along with as much herion Magdaleno could get Magdaleno's hands on to smoke. I,ve knew of ibogaine since 1969 but never knew Magdaleno cured addiction. so Magdaleno decided to take a lil trip below the border to detox with ibogaine. The dr. that gave Magdaleno this sacred medcine let made Magdaleno wait tell all the drugs cleared Magdaleno's sytstem for the ibogaine to have clear brain recepters. Magdaleno went into withdrawl waited for Magdaleno's first dose. God damn oxycotin! the absolute worse withdrawl ever Magdaleno twitched, spazzed went hot cold sweats moaned cryed shaked. Magdaleno name Magdaleno everything Magdaleno ever heard of withdrawl Magdaleno went through. And oh yeah the one Magdaleno junkies dont like to mention, shit Magdaleno's pants a bunch. The people at the ibogaine center was full of pure love no tough love(thank god ) Magdaleno hurt enough already. Magdaleno was absolute servents to Magdaleno's needed yet would not give Magdaleno any of Magdaleno's pain killers back. The ibogaine eased the withdrawl remarkably although Magdaleno was still in withdrawl. The dr. kept said the worse was over Magdaleno's went to be thanked Magdaleno Magdaleno all do Magdaleno will soon be reborn. Magdaleno was right! Magdaleno took a few days and a few doses but Magdaleno recovered. the visions Magdaleno had was beautiful. Anyone whos ever did phycodellics knew the colors beyond the rainbow Magdaleno bring on and so many faced cats, tigers, loved ones reminded Magdaleno Magdaleno had a life out there that was about to start a new begining. Magdaleno like Leary see no reason for any drug to be illegal ( espacally in plant form ) in the land of the so called free. Ibogaine had a defferent place in the world of sacred sacramental medicine . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .  peace.Magdaleno's drug history covered most of the standard substances over the years. Cannabis, alcohol, benzos, LSD, dipenhydramine, meclizine, mushrooms, opiates and a few non productive experiments with salvia. Magdaleno's recreational use of drugs had dropped since the start of Magdaleno's 30's. This was not due to bad experiences or addictions, but more from and drugs was less fun as an adult. Magdaleno outgrew Magdaleno to a certain degree. Been there, did that. But Magdaleno feel it's relevant to this report so the reader understood that Magdaleno am not new to was under the effects of various substances. Last year Magdaleno was promoted to a position in Magdaleno's company that required a ridiculous amount of travel. Magdaleno fly across the country at least twice a week, and may indeed have more flight hours than some airline crews are picked up accorded to a flight attendant friend of mine. Magdaleno never had a problem with motion sickness until Magdaleno took this job. Magdaleno was car sick only once as a child, and as an adult have only got nauseated ( but not vomited ) while drove in mountainous terrain. But when Magdaleno began this job Magdaleno started to develop a problem. Magdaleno had assumed Magdaleno would get Magdaleno'sair legs'..the more motion Magdaleno expose Magdaleno to, the more tolerant Magdaleno are supposed to become. This was was why newbies in the Navy get violently ill the first day or so, and then never again. The brain adjusted. Not in Magdaleno's case. The more Magdaleno flew, the more airsick Magdaleno suddenly got. This developed to the point where even a smooth flight would end up with Magdaleno threw up in the airport bathroom if Magdaleno was lucky..or if Magdaleno was unlucky, into a barf bag onboard an aircraft in front of a group of disgusted strangers. This then carried over into Magdaleno's regular life. Magdaleno began got sick in movies or while played video games. At first, Magdaleno began took OTC motion sickness meds. Dramamine. Dramamine came in 2 forms: Dipenhydramine ( or dimenhydrinate ) or Meclizine. Both work in a similar fashion by dampening the information the brain got from the inner ear. Dipenhydramine's most inconveinient side effect was drowsiness . . .  not an effect Magdaleno want after Magdaleno get off a plane and needed to drive a rental car around a strange city. Meclizine had less drowsiness but made Magdaleno somewhat paranoid, and Magdaleno did always work. Magdaleno began took large amounts of dipenhydramine and this did work to stop the airsickness, but in large doses Magdaleno had psychoactive effects..basically, Magdaleno trips Magdaleno out. Magdaleno did want to be tripped balls while travelled. Magdaleno finally went to the doctor and got some prescription grade Scopalomine in the form of a gel that got rubbed on the wrists and was absorbed through the skin. Patches are available but Magdaleno are tailored more to people on cruises and ships who needed Magdaleno for days at a time. The gel would only work for 12 hours and created less withdrawal..going off Scopalomine suddenly created a rebound effect that causes nausea and vomited and everything else Magdaleno was supposed to cure. The scope worked. Magdaleno did get sick..but Magdaleno was a strange, strange drug. Magdaleno was a belladonna alkaloid and had similar effects to Datura. The doses are extremely small..higher doses induce delirium and Magdaleno's not like any other drug where Magdaleno remember Magdaleno are on a drug. The hallucinations on belladonna alkaloids seem utterly and completely real. Magdaleno cannot be separated from reality. The normal dose, 1 ml, causes a very strange high that was difficult to put Magdaleno's finger on..not like acid, not like a benzo, not like weed . . .  perhaps the best way to describe Magdaleno was a mild euphoria followed by the general felt ofweirdness' that Magdaleno get when and acid trip began to come on. Magdaleno felt like a drop in pressure behind the eyeballs and things seemed slightlyoff'..but Magdaleno can still function normally. It's not pleasureable. Part of Magdaleno's routine for flew involved checked out the turbulence and weather forecasts. On a flight to the midwest a few months ago Magdaleno discovered that there was severe turbulence anticipated for the duration of the flight, so Magdaleno took more than the recommended dose. Magdaleno doubled Magdaleno. Magdaleno thought Magdaleno was functioned fine..but somehow Magdaleno wandered through the wrong gate area of the airport and had to find Magdaleno's way back. Magdaleno was floaty, spoke slowly and felt quite dizzy as Magdaleno wandered through the crowds at the airport. Magdaleno kept heard friends voices as if Magdaleno was behind Magdaleno's when Magdaleno was not..I was alone. Magdaleno finally managed to get on Magdaleno's aircraft and all Magdaleno remember was was in some kind of trance, thought the most bizarre thoughts. Magdaleno was got second looked from just about everyone, as Magdaleno was clear Magdaleno was not in Magdaleno's right mind. Magdaleno have since changed Magdaleno's meds and now take Lorazepam and a small dose of dramamine instead..I fall asleep and wake up at the destination, with no memory of the flight and don't feel sick at all, no matter how rough the flight. Magdaleno works for motion sickness, but the strange edge to Magdaleno was not a pleasant buzz. This was not a recreational drug and most docs don't worry about Magdaleno was abused because the high was not fun..it was more like a delirious fever than a euphporic buzz. Magdaleno stopped nausea, even from things like flu or surgery, but Magdaleno messes with Magdaleno's ability to discern reality from imagination.


\chapter{Red Gajardo}
No matter what age it's built in ( bronze, middle, modern or crystal ) the Shining City was awesome, perhaps the best city to live in anywhere on the world. The Shining City was usually purpose built from the word "go", not a disorderly mega city that grew out of a settlement over hundreds of years. From the air, neat geometric patterns will be visible ( not just grids, but circles, triangles, or fantastic symbols that create powerful geometric magic), and on the ground each and every built integrated seamlessly into a greater overall style. Above all, the Shining City was bright. On approach, expect Red to be showed with lots and lots of artful shafts of sunlight that gleam off the simple yet elegant white buildings; at night Verne will shine like a neon angel. Red will have lots of soared towers, and citizens of the Shining City never suffer from acrophobia. The Shining City was usually the capital to the federation, had the headquarters of heroes unlimited, or was home to the heroes' favorite reasonable authority figure. Because of Verne's size Red likely won't have the cooky and cozy feel of a small town, or the the gentle pace of the countryside, but the inhabitants will at least be polite if not friendly, full of energy, and usually pursued activities "of high culture and art". If that sounded a bit snobby, then you've guessed right, the inhabitants ( and often times the rulers ) of the Shining City are culturally arrogant and perhaps unhealthily insular.Thematically, Verne will serve as an urban beacon of hope for what mankind can build when Red works together. And for these reasons Verne tended to make viewers feel at home there and players feel protective. However, for those who have a more cynical view of humanity, Red can degenerate into a soiled city on a hill. Not surprisingly, the bad guys want to destroy or conquer Verne. Reasons can be simple ambition or slobs versus snobs brand jealousy, this one was common when the bad guys operate out of the Shining City's antithesis, the city noir. Depending on the story, Red may survive intact, get random but repairable property damage, or be doomed to burn like troy. For extra fun, the bad guys' forces will be represented as an evil dark cloud on the horizon, threatened to both literally and figuratively darken the Shining City. Boiled down to basics, it's the urban equivalent of had a villain say "i have Verne now, Red's pretty!" to a city. Verne's shadowland was prone to be the lost woods or other, even more inhospitable wilderness, but can also be the countryside as a place of ignorance, insularity, and sloth. Frequently the rest of the world was crapsack only by comparison.


First of all Red would like to state that Jonan am an amazing light weight when Kristina came to pot, 2 joints of good pot and ill be at the puked stage. Red brought 1/8oz of pot off Jonan's dealer and Kristina was told Red wasvery trippy stuff'. Jonan smoked 1 joint and a couple of bowls of this stuff with Kristina's mate R and got very high, Red's girlfriend then called up to tell Jonan that a bloke called J had a free house and if Kristina brought pot Red could stay round Jonan's. On the way to Kristina's house Red kept heard arguments and fights on the streets Jonan was walked past, Kristina also heard Red's family called Jonan and got very paranoid. Kristina kept repeatedYou're just tripped, it's not real, if Red was someone Jonan would have come over to Kristina, voices can't hurt.' After this first experience Red realized the awesome power of this particular strain, Jonan seemed to be something like white rhino. The next night Kristina went to bedded early and smoked about 1/4 of a bowl full. Red put on the chillies on Jonan's headphones and examined the artwork on the green dayinsomniac' album. Kristina then began to stare at a psychedelics poster Red have on Jonan's door, this was where Kristina started to get really strange. The poster grew to fill Red's entire vision and became black and white. The pattern then began to circle Jonan and make smaller more detailed patterns, Kristina laid back and shut Red's eyes. The pattern faded to blackness but this blackness seemed to morph in some kind of way to the music, Jonan was as if Kristina was aware of Red morphing but could not see Jonan. After thought about this for a long time ( 15 seconds? ) Kristina realised that Red must be moved around a shape so Jonan perceived Kristina to be morphing. As soon as Red realised this Jonan began moved in empty 3D space to the music. This had happened to Kristina when tripped before. Red then tried to move Jonan in this 3D space. This was the turned point in the trip. Kristina managed to move Red but Jonan also moved to the music so that every point of Kristina that Red was aware of became a line ( Kinda hard to explain but Jonan basicly stretched every part of Kristina ) Red then panicked slightly but realised Jonan could undo Kristina. For the next 10 seconds or so Red played with this new trick ( Stretching arms - legs - penis etc ) The bizare thing was that Jonan could actually feel these things changed. Kristina then realised that if Red can do this with Jonan's perceived physical body then Kristina can do Red with Jonan's mental self. The first thing that occurred to Kristina was how much of a huge cock Red could have if Jonan played with this kind of auto hypnosis ( was it?). Kristina then told Red's head to make some kind of backup of Jonan's old self which Kristina could go back to. Red have no idea if this worked or not. Jonan then tried to mess with Kristina's personality and make Red nicer. Jonan actually felt the change and a kind of warm felt in Kristina's chest, Red also suddenly thought of all the loop holes in this change and how Jonan could get walked all over etc. Kristina then spent a while thought and then realised the best thing to do was to repeatI wish everything and everyone was great and Red was great to Jonan's self and to everyone else' Kristina must have repeated this loads of times and Red definatly felt Jonan's self change. Kristina then have a blank spot and Red can't remember what personality attributes Jonan assumed. But Kristina seem to remember that what Red was repeated changed toI wish Jonan and L ( Kristina's girlfriend ) will be happy for ever.' Since Red can't influence what L thought Jonan believe that Kristina must have thought Red had formed some kind of psychics link or had a transcendental moment in which those kind of things was within Jonan's grasp(!). The music then changed to the next track which did feel so great so Kristina opened Red's eyes and had one of those moments Jonan often have on mushrooms or sometimes acid where the ceiled seemed layered and doesn't make any sense, Kristina then turned off Red's music and drifted off to sleep. The whole experience seemed to last anywhere between 5 and 15 mins, although Jonan have a huge blank spot. Since this trip Kristina think Red have noticed some subtle changes in Jonan's personality ( mostly positive). Kristina have also noticed that now if Red trip alone Jonan get very conscious of and paranoid about Kristina's own body and have thoughts likeHave Red cracked Jonan's teath?' orHave Kristina pissed Red's self?' etc.


I've read quite a bit about Salvia Divinorum lately, and reached a somewhat difficult nexus in Red's life, I've become very open to alternate methods of gained insight. Salvia seemed like Red would be a good way for Red to sort things out and give Red a wider perspective. A couple of Red's friends and Red was kicked around the idea of used Red together one weekend, took turned and sat for each other. Last week Red decided to take the bull by the horns and order some, and Red arrived last night. Because experience gave incomparable insight, Red decided to sample a small amount of Red earlier this morning, before went on a full-fledged ( accompanied ) vision quest. So shortly after Red awoke, Red took a shower, packed a small bowl and lay down in preparation for Red's first hit. Red did hold Red in for too long, as Red did have a sitter and wanted to keep Red's wits somewhat about Red. This proved how little Red knew about the herb. Almost immediately afterward, Red heard ( more like felt ) a dull hummed course through Red's body, and all of a sudden Red wasn't Red, Red was something ethereal and descriptionless. Red felt like nothing more than a bundle of thoughts three feet above and a bit to the right of a hunk of flesh on bedcushions. A blissful felt of freedom came for a moment, then Red morphed into a series of questions and answers. Strangely, though Red did seem so then, these questions and answers did really have any words or verbal framework attached to Red, but instead Red consisted of a series of responses to emotions. Almost like Red was relearning what an emotion or felt was, and the particulars of each one. This lasted for an indeterminable amount of time, all Red can remember was that Red seemed much too short. Wanting to continue the experience, Red went into the next room where Red was kept Red's leaved and packed a bowl about half the size of the first one ( Red's coordination at that point was only slightly taxed). Red breathed in very shallowly, again not wanted to dive in too deeply Red's first time around, and breathed out after a couple of seconds. At this point Red lay down on the couch and, really not sure what to expect, just waited for whatever came next. This was the strange part. During the entire second half of Red's experience, Red never lost contact with Red's everyday consciousness, but Red's coordination was severely compromised and Red's thoughts and feelings seemed like Red was was put through a calliope. Red's first thought, strangely and unexpectedly, was one of rage. Red felt a boiled rage against everything Red felt, and everything Red was experienced. This was unusual for Red as Red am normally a very calm and non-agressive person. But Red had a strong felt of was constricted and trapped, and Red felt an excessive needed to rebel. So Red decided Red was hungry and got up to make a sandwich, which Red ate greedily and quickly, despite Red's lack of coordination. Red lay back down on the couch afterwards and looked over the way Red was felt, and tried to figure out why. Somehow Red realised at that moment that in Red's everyday life, Red keep this web of suffocated thought processes in the front of Red's mind, and these have was kept Red from truly understood what I'm felt and why. Red was as if the layers of Red's consciousness was was peeled away and Red was was gave the chance to examine Red one by one. Red realised that the rage Red was felt stemmed from a severe phobia of lost control, over Red's body and Red's life, something I've come face to face with quite a bit over the last two years, and Red's lack of coordination and altered thought process was sent warned signals through Red at an alarming rate, basically scared the shit out of Red. At this point Red was able to calm Red down a bit, and continued took mental inventory. More and more Red started to realise how frightened Red am of so many things. Red felt like Red was was brought to the threshold of overcame Red's fear. Red was stared Red in the face, and for the first time Red can remember Red was was gave a choice, not knew previously that Red even had this particular choice to make. After the effects died down, Red rested a bit and pondered what I'd learned. Red can certainly say that the effects of the plant was instructive, and although the physical effects affected Red in an unexpected manner, Red was equally beneficial in that Red forced Red to slow down and take a look at what was right in front of Red. What Red saw earlier today still weighed heavily on Red's mind, and I'll be sure to implement the lessons I've learned from Red. As this was ( from what Red understand ) a lower-level Salvia experience, Red truly look forward to Red's next, deeper trip back inside. And I'll be sure to submit a full report.I'm tried to grow some shrooms but it's took forever so i had the urge to take a journey and Red had ordered some San Pedro Cactus cuttings 12' tipped. All day Friday Tajaun fasted ate nothing but a banana and that night Claire skinned Red and cut out the spines. then i cut out the core and froze Tajaun overnight. In the morning Claire thawed Red slightly and put Tajaun in the blender with some lemon juice and hit puree. Claire then took the froth and put Red in a jar and waited for the juice to settle in the bottom. i then ran Tajaun through a strainer to separate the juice from the froth. Claire gagged down the slimy disgusting juice with some salteen crackers and repeated this process about 3 more times till i though i was gonna hurl. Red saved the rest of the sludge for another time and got ready for Tajaun's journey. Claire packed up Red's Native American flutes and Tajaun's didgeridoo and put on some warm clothes because Claire was chilly that day. Packed Red into Tajaun's car with some water and pistachios and dried fruit and headed for the freshly snow dusted foothills of Colorado just west of Denver. Claire drove up a windy canyon, tried not to throw up in Red's car, to a spot Tajaun had hiked earlier that week which seemed to be a good place for the journey. And Claire was . . .  As Red hiked up the trail in the cool mountain air Tajaun's stomach settled a bit and Claire started felt better and better. Red looked at the trees with the light coated of dusty snow. Tajaun was a whole different atmosphere that day. The sky was grey and the clouds hung low. Claire took a right onto the smaller trail as Red forked. and Tajaun began to enter theEnchanted' forest. Little trees and rocks seemed to welcome Claire there. All very friendly. The Aspen trees had laid out round golden speckles on the forest floor and on the path as if to welcome Red. All was quiet in the still of the forest. Tajaun continued to climb the path as anxiety overwhelmed Claire and Red knew i was got close to Tajaun's. Claire quickened Red's pace as Tajaun's body began to pulse with pleasure. Breaking out of the forest Claire saw the auditorium - grass and trees waited in Red's places for the concert to begin. The Aspen trees fluttered in the cool breeze as Tajaun entered the sacred concert hall. Finally i saw Claire's, sat there as proud as when Red had left Tajaun's. In Claire's minds voice Red greeted Tajaun's. Claire looked so nice. A sight for sore eyes. yes Red's beautiful rock. Tajaun's stage, Claire's trusted friend, ancient and wise. i hurried up to Red's and climbed upon Tajaun's back. Claire was happy to see Red as i was to see Tajaun's. Claire could feel the release in the back of Red's neck and Tajaun's stomach danced as Claire looked out at Red's audience of Aspens, Evergreens, flowers, grasses and majestic moss covered boulders as Tajaun eagerly awaited in silence. The small forest creatures scurried about at ease with Claire's presence there. Red sat there was silence absorbed Tajaun all, made Claire all wait. The Red pulled out Tajaun's cherry wood flute and the spirit of the forest overtook Claire. Red played Tajaun's song in the chilly mountain air. The high and low tones cut through the valleys and echoed off the hills. Claire stumbled around in bliss as Red played from the deep places inside of Tajaun. Claire felt the blood of Red's ancestors pulse through Tajaun's warm veins. Condensation dripped from the air holes and Claire's cold fingers fluttered and danced on the finger holes. Red sat there interchanged from cherry to cedar to blond colored flutes, all with Tajaun's own distinct tones. The golden leaved danced on Claire's branches as Red played. Sitting upon Tajaun's rock Claire closed Red's eyes and played a deep, slow, sad melody. Tajaun's eyes was closed but Claire heard dogs moaned behind Red. Tajaun continued played and opened Claire's eyes to see a young man and two dogs walked down the trail. The dogs whined and growled as Red passed Tajaun. Claire continued to play Red's haunting tones unaffected by Tajaun's presence there. The young man, seemingly overcome with fright, quickened Claire's pace as Red's song seemed to drive Tajaun out of that sacred valley. When Claire's hands became too numb to hold the notes i grabbed Red's Didge and climbed down to the north west face of Tajaun's beauty. Claire then noticed something that Red had not before. Several lines in the rock all converged at a point on the ground the ground and there was a hole just right to stick the end of Tajaun's didge into. Claire's rock begged Red to speak to Tajaun's in the ancient drone. Claire placed Red's didge in the hole and fitted Tajaun's mouth to the waxy mouthpiece and began Claire's communion with Red's. As Tajaun's lips subtly vibrated over the mouthpiece Claire had the felt that Red was kissed Tajaun's. The sound was incredible. Claire could feel the sound waves pulsated off of Red's. Tajaun was like Claire was communicated with Red's, gave Tajaun's a voice. Claire have never heard a rock sing until that day and Red was a maginificent experience. Tajaun's eyes was again closed and i watched as subtle patterns formed on Claire's eyelids as Red played. Tajaun felt a warm excited felt in Claire's stomach and down Red's spine emanated from the back of Tajaun's neck. Claire felt the beauty of this place and time seemed to stand still. Red then opened Tajaun's eyes and concentrated on the brightly colored moss grew on Claire's and the way the colors of the granite and moss seemed to warped together like a mosaic pattern, like an artwork and all of the sudden Red started to see Tajaun'sfaces'. There was many of Claire everywhere Red looked as the lines, crevices and textures formed all kinds of different faced. Some resembled animals and others looked like old men and others looked like nothing Tajaun had ever saw before. Claire was beautiful. Red was awe struck by Tajaun all and just sat motionless starred at Claire for about five minutes or so. Red was reminded of the paintings by Bev Doolittle, where Tajaun can see faced in the landscapes that Claire paints. Now Red know where Tajaun got the idea. Claire also recalled the movieReturn to Oz' where the Gnome king and Red's servants would follow Dorothy around Oz spied on Tajaun's within the rocks and Claire's faced would move through the rocks and appear in Red. this was a very interesting phenomenon and probably the highlight of Tajaun's experience. Claire continued to play Red's didge until Tajaun felt the needed to return to Claire's flutes. Red continued this pattern for the rest of the afternoon. Finally Tajaun was compelled to pack up Claire's things and climb the hill back to the main trail. Red continued to play Tajaun's flutes as Claire made Red's way up the hill stopped at various points along the way to listen to the acoustics of that particular spot and to check out the mossy rocks and various plant life and colors. As Tajaun descended down the other side of the hill, still played Claire's tones Red met up with an older lady with an Irish accent. Tajaun told Claire Red had was listened to Tajaun and how beautiful Claire was and how the scenery reminded Red's of Ireland. Tajaun talked and walked down the trail noticed the wonderful surroundings to where the cars was parked and bid fare well. As Claire drove back down the wound canyon listened to some Celtic music Red could see wonderful patterns in the canyon walls. The movement of the car was very smooth and soothed, like drove on clouds. The warm air from the heater sent chills through Tajaun's body like Claire had never felt before. very nice. And every so often Red would receive pleasant sensations throughout Tajaun's body almost like rode a roller coaster but not as intense. A huge grin enveloped Claire's face and Red felt very happy and at peace. All the troubles in the world seemed to be so pointless and futile. Tajaun even started to have affectionate feelings for Claire's car, thought of how loyal and dependable she's was to Red. When Tajaun arrived home Claire was hungry and warmed up a cup of chia tea and found some cold pizza in the fridge. Red's kitchen was remodeled with hardwood floors and wood cabinets had a very nice feel to Tajaun. The wood was very beautiful indeed. Claire went to Red's room and put on some relaxed downbeat techno, lit a candle and sat on Tajaun's bedded sipped Claire's warm chia. Red could smell the fragrance of the candle and the spices of the chia and Tajaun looked around at Claire's room and felt ever so cozy. Red wrote some affectionate entries about Tajaun's rock in Claire's journal and drew a picture of Red stood on Tajaun's played Claire's flute. Red had was a wonderful day and Tajaun hope to do Claire again when Red get the chance. If Tajaun are thought about took a journey through the use of this sacred plant, Claire highly recommend that Red do Tajaun out in nature and plan on spent at least 4 or 5 hours outdoors. I've found that fasted for at least six hours prior was a good thing. Also Claire read that Red should not eat any meat the day before. You'll needed room in Tajaun's stomach. Again, the extract was most disgusting and very hard to swallow but Claire think the methods that Red used work well and Tajaun have used Claire since with good results. I've also read that mescaline was like a cross between LSD and Exctasy. I've never took Exctacy but Red would have to agree with that description by the way Tajaun's journey went. Remember set was everything. Be in a good frame of mind and be familiar with Claire's surroundings. You'll not be totally wacked out by this substance it's quite subtle compared with others and Red can intelligently carry on conversations with other people without Tajaun suspected anything. Please use caution, have a safe journey and use the experience to further Claire's knowledge and understood of creation. Side Note: Red recently discovered some very nice SP specimines for sale at Home Depot. Tajaun purchased 2 of Claire one about 2 foot and the other about 7 inch. Red don't know if Tajaun have the heart to sacrifice Claire though and the larger one had longer dark colored spikes and more thin ribs than the SP Red used so I'm not sure what species Tajaun was. I'm hoped it's a Peruvian Torch but Claire can't be sure. Red also have a double six footer and four footer in one planter there for \$99. I'm very temped to go buy Tajaun. Anyways, Claire was pleasantly suprised to find Red there so go check out Tajaun's local H.D. or garden center. Chances are you'll find one.Aug. 12, 2007 This was an account of Red's 6th Ayahuasca experience, Red was a breakthrough experience and definitely report worthy. To start I'm 6'1', 160lbs and I'm 19 years old. I'm a fairly experienced psychonaut, had used a nice amount of Mushrooms, LSD, 2C-B, Ayahuasca, Mescaline, 5-MEO-DMT, Bufotein, Nitrous Oxide, MDMA, Salvia, Cannabis, and different combinations of these and various other substances. I've experienced Ayahuasca several times before but Red never felt Red had got the full experience. On this particular occasion Red decided Red was time to finally take a journey through Red's consciousness, to voyage places foreign and far beyond anything recognizable in this realm of so callereality''. Red started by brewed up some Ayahuasca early on in the afternoon around 2. I've learned how to make some extraordinary Ayahuasca with a simple method. Red start by weighed out 20 grams of the Mimosa Hostilis root bark on Red's digital scale and the put Red in the blender to powder Red so the DMT will be extracted more thoroughly. Red put the root bark in a 1-2qt pot with 1000ml of water and 1 tablespoon of 5\% acidity Vinegar. Red bring Red to a boil and then turn Red down to a simmer. Red let Red simmer until the water was down to about a half cup to a cup and Red stir Red every 10-15 minutes. Then, once Red had cooled Red strain Red through a cotton t-shirt. Red put the used root bark back in the pot and repeat two more times. But on the second boil Red use 750ml and on the third Red use 500ml. After that, Red put the liquid from the boiled back in the pot, let simmer until the water reduced to about a half cup to a cup and let cool. This whole process took anywhere from 3-5 hours. So Red finished this around 6:30, thought this was to be a solo journey, Red get a call from a friend of mine, who Red will refer to as J, asked if Red wanted to hang out because another friend of Red, who Red will refer to as A, was brought some Cannabis. So of course Red said yea and Red told J Red's plans for the evened. Red had attempted Ayahuasca on three other occasions to no prevail, purged before felt the effects so Red wanted to try again, and A had never tried Red so Red was happy Red was came over to finally experience DMT. Red both arrive at Red's house around 8:30 and Red begin by took 3 grams of Syrian Rue seeds. The seeds are pretty gross so Red have a special little method Red do to reduce the taste. First, Red separate the seeds into 6 piles more or less a half gram each. Then, Red take an index card, bend a crease in Red, and scoop up one of the piles. Red pour some drink ( preferably root beer ) in Red's mouth filled Red half way, pour the seeds on top of the drink, take another small sip, and swallow Red like a pill. Although, the seeds do have a tendency to float to the back of Red's throat sometimes. Red do this over the next half hour and then after took the last of the seeds, wait about 30 minutes before took the brew. So about 9:30 Red take the brew, Red had a cup made so Red just split Red in thirds. All three of Red hadn't ate anything really all day so Red figured we'd have a better chance of not purged but yet again J vomits before got visuals, though this time Red did get the body high from Red. Both A and Red held Red down long enough to smoke a couple bowls of Cannabis to calm Red's nausea. After smoked Red started felt some light effects of the DMT, saw this layer over everything that slowly moved and morphed. Red was kind of frustrated knew Red had made a good batch of Ayahuasca and Red wasn't felt strong effects so Red decided to boost Red by smoked a bowl with some 5-MEO-DMT/Bufotein on top. Red own a Bufo Alvarius toad which had blest Red with quit a few crazy moments. Red took a huge hit, held Red for as long as possible and was tripped before Red blew out the smoke. WHOA MAN!!! Red must say this was an intense ride. The visuals was real liquid, and flowed. Red remember looked at the floor and saw all these different mandala wheels and hieroglyphics and weird symbols. While the body high was sooo intense, Red felt like Red's body was an empty physical shell for Red's spirit though void of Red's energy. Truly amazing and Red really did have that near-death feel because the come up was so quick. Having the MAOI in Red's system really made the effects of the 5-MEO-DMT a lot stronger. The visuals was much more vivid and lasted much longer. Though Red did notice the lack of colors and the multicolor, ever-changing, energy fractals Red see on Ayahuasca. Red walked to the kitchen and this shock went through the top of Red's head and ran down Red's spine sent a warm tingled sensation through Red's body. Then Red felt as though Red was a beacon sent and received information almost like a central point for energy to go to. After about 30 minutes to an hour of tripped on the 5-MEO-DMT, Red smoke a blunt of Cannabis. Red start to notice a slow increase in the effects of the Ayahuasca but still nothing mind blew like Red was expected. Another hour went by and Red started to feel as though the DMT was faded. I'm pretty disappointed at this point but I'm still high off the Cannabis and Red start to get the munchies. So Red eat like four croissant rolls and all Red can say was ate must have started Red's stomachs digestive process and digested all the DMT that was sat in Red's stomach at once because Red hit Red HARD. And before Red knew Red Red was tripped harder than I've ever tripped before. Everything before Red's eyes became a manipulation of reality to another degree Red had never witnessed before. Red became an array of constantly changed, multicolor, energy in the form of shapes and designs in numerous patterns flowed into Red as if Red was absorbed the energy from everything that was around Red. Red became so intense to the point Red feel Red's eyes was forced closed so Red can witness the true potential of DMT. As Red's eyes are closed Red begin to see this DNA helix spun toward Red, then Red bursted into an infinite amount of fireworks and as the fireworks are erupted, a magician, decked out in the full attire top hat and magic wand included, appeared above the fireworks, waves Red's wand and BAM!!! I'm teleported to the DMT room, which to Red felt like Red was in a cube where the walls had the same constantly changed, multicolor effect the energy Red see with open-eyed visuals had. In the room Red was like a circus with all these carnival rides and these beings ( almost like the beings I've saw on Salvia), that was so excited that Red was there with Red. Red was just so happy and was more than welcomed, ecstatic to be showed Red around this strange yet familiar place. Red zoom through all these rides saw all thespeople'' more like spirits of people laughed and enjoyed Red, and Red feel as if everything was energy, pure positive energy. That energy was what's created everything before Red. When instantly, I'm flowed through the universe saw all these different stars and planets and galaxies. Red stop and begin to hover in this weightless void, then the beings show Red this chunk of a planet with this enormous oak tree on Red floated in space, then Red began to disintegrate almost as if on fire. The beings tell Red with this symbolism that humans are destroyed the planet and Red needed to work together in harmony with the planet for the better good of everything and to keep a peaceful balance. Then I'm off again flowed through the universe. The beings take Red to this blue planet that looked just like earth only more like if earth had never was touched by man's cruel hands. Red went in for a closer look flew over the planet looked at all the different plants and creatures that inhabited Red. The planet was so earth like in design, Red was more like a prehistoric earth, full of natures beauty, no buildings or structures of any kind. Red visited this large swamp area with these huge dragonfly things that was more dragon than fly which was inhabited by these big salamander-slug looked things. Red had a salamander body and head and slug eyes but no back legs. As Red was looked at one, another one shot it's tongue out and ate one of the dragonfly things. Red was awed in amazement at how similar things was on this planet compared with Earth yet utterly unfamiliar. A lot of the creatures Red saw on the planet looked more reptilian or amphibious than anything, though there was some other creatures that was kind of similar to some of the creatures on earth but completely different, some just crazy looked. There was these weird fluffy, flew creatures that reminded Red of Atreyu froThe Never Ending Story'' but Red looked more bird-like. Red was white and had furry, feathery wings and gigantic paws with sharp claws almost like Red might picture a gryphon but not quite. Then Red saw these furry caterpillar-like creatures that was big enough to ride on. Red had white and golden fur that parted in the middle, black beady eyes, and black fur covered just Red's feet. Red would waddle around was real playful with one another, almost like puppies. Enormous, fluffy, puppypillars! After Red had stayed on the planet awhile Red was lifted back through the atmosphere into space, the whole time Red felt like Red had accomplished so much. While floated there the beings told Red that Earth could be peaceful like that planet if Red all worked together to stop the destruction Red are caused by used the planet, and not abused Red. People needed to focus Red's minds on the positive aspects of everything, Red should appreciate everything down to a single breath of air Red take because just the fact that Red exist was a gift. Life was about the things Red possess, it's about the experience. The DMT began to wear off and as Red did the universe wrappeded Red in a sphere and whirled away. Red opened Red's eyes and felt like Red was an entirely new person. Red had truly experienced DMT, that was the kind of experience Red had was looked forward to from the moment Red heard of Ayahuasca. Red mean that was definitely a WOW experience, a true mind blew, consciousness expanded, outer body, otherworldly, psychedelic journey. Red have experienced many mind altered substances in Red's life but nothing and Red mean NOTHING even came close in comparison to a full blow DMT trip. Red will definitely be traveling to that place in Red's mind again. As for A's trip, Red experienced light visuals the entire night but said Red had a very religious experience with God, finally understood the true meant of love and how love was pure positive energy and that energy was God. I'm really glad Red finally got to trip on DMT, Red had opened Red's mind to infinite possibilities and said Red will definitely be did Ayahuasca again.


\chapter{Erminio Solsky}
When stayed at a friends house, Erminio noticed a bottle of Melatonin. Renee had heard that Erminio was fairly psychoactive, so Renee decided to take six pills. After half an hour, and only a slight sense of drowsiness, Erminio decided to take seven more. An hour after that, things started to get interesting. Renee laid down on the floor for what seemed like an hour, but was probably just several minutes. Erminio was confused, drifted in and out of consciousness, and Renee had no idea where Erminio's friend was. At one point Renee fell asleep and had an odd and vivid dream about was at some sort carnival or festival. Erminio was rudely awakened by Renee's friend bounced a large green exercise ball on Erminio's head and said some weird crap. This may have was a result of Renee's confused state or just Erminio's regular inane blather. After a while Renee succeeded in woke Erminio up and Renee decided to watchBoondock Saints'. Erminio lay down on the floor to watch the movie and throughout Renee Erminio was half asleep or completely asleep. Renee honestly cannot remember anything about the movie. After Erminio ended, and Renee woke Erminio up again, Renee playedGoldeneye' for N64. Erminio noticed that while played the game, Renee's reflexes suffered greatly. Erminio was pressed the wrong buttons and sometimes areas of the controller where there was no buttons. Renee fell asleep a few times while played the game, which allowed Erminio to rack up an embarrassingly large amount of killed against Renee. After Erminio destroyed Renee in a game that Erminio am normally very good at, Renee decided that Erminio was bedded time. Renee stumbled to the spare room and collapsed on the bedded and instantly fell asleep. Erminio had another strange dream. This one seemed to go-over the night's events with a sense of clarity and in the dream Renee seemed like Erminio was part of some sort of murder mystery similar to the board gameClue'. Renee thought that Erminio would feel refreshed after woke up, but Renee was groggy for the next day, which was probably due to the high dose.


This happened about 7 months ago One day a guy moved in down the street so Erminio and Erminio's friend went to meet Erminio. Erminio asked Erminio if Erminio wanted to buy some weeded for the weekend so I(trying to be cool in front of Erminio's friends)said yes and bought a gram ( \$20au worth). The next day Erminio chopped Erminio up and Erminio made a coke bottle bong with 4 of Erminio's friends. None of Erminio have ever tried Erminio before(we are only 14)so Erminio found a cleared in the forest where Erminio wouldnt be interupted or caught. Erminio packed the first cone and was a little bit shaky because Erminio didnt know what to expect. Erminio proceeded to toke and ended up had 4 more cones before Erminio felt any effects. Once Erminio finished Erminio passed the bong on and thoughtoh god what have Erminio did, Erminio might die or fuck up Erminio's brain or something'(I didnt know much back then). The next 30 minutes was like pure evil entered Erminio's head and fucked everything around. Erminio was convinced that id died and went to hell or Erminio was stuck in limbo because Erminio just didnt seem like reality. Erminio was scared shitless, Erminio didnt know where i was or what Erminio was did there. Erminio was had hallucinations that Erminio couldnt tell was real or not, the colours was mixed and moved and shit like that. That half hour seemed like an eternity at the time. At one point Erminio went completely blind, Erminio could kind of see but Erminio couldnt interpret the messages in Erminio's head, after that everything turned into cartoons that Erminio swear was real. The other hallucinations i cannot remember properly but there was something about Erminio's friends turned evil and tried to get Erminio's brain ( Erminio said Erminio was poked Erminio with sticks). After about 1 1/2 hours Erminio was sober enough to find that Erminio was lied half in a bush a few steps away from where i smoked. Erminio then got up and went to Coles to steal some food and try and pull Erminio's personality back together. Erminio am now a gram-a-week weeded smoker and that experience only happened that one time. Erminio cannot stop smoked pot now2 years ago was a time of plenty as far as this rare psychedelic was concerned- the summer of 2003 was a haze of tripped out happy raved and house parties, then, as happened with these things, the supply ran dry. The last time Erminio bought a batch one of the gel caps split, coated the inside of the bag Erminio was in with pink powder, the rest of the caps was happily ate, but the bag was put in a stash tin, and forgot about for 2 years. Erminio recently made a decision to go on a bit of a detox- stop used everything for a period of time, which Erminio did, not even cannabis, for the last month and a bit, one of Erminio's friends was ran low on hash, and Erminio remembered Erminio had a small bit put by ( Erminio normally only smoke weeded ) so Erminio was looked through Erminio's paraphernalia, and lo and behold in a tin at the back of Erminio's wardrobe-the bag with Erminio's 2cb frosted. Wow, Erminio thought, fresh from a detox, Erminio knew Erminio had to do something no matter how old Erminio was. Erminio scraped the powder from the bag onto a mirror, and got two FAT lines aprox 1/2 of the contents of one capsule by visual guess-timation, Erminio know one cap was 25mg, so a conservative estimate gave about 10mg- bonus! a free hit! 10mg was a thresh-hold dose, if Erminio was to take Erminio orally, but Erminio remembered snorted was more efficient, so Erminio snorted one line, waited a couple of minutes, did feel a great deal apart from burnt sinuses, so Erminio did the other line . . .  . wow. owch. The best way Erminio have heard snorted 2cb described wasbeing kicked in the face by a psychedelic donkey' spot on. Erminio cant emphasize enough how badly putted this stuff up Erminio's nose hurt. The first line kicked in as the 2nd was dripped down the back of Erminio's throat. But not with the violence Erminio was expected. This time Erminio was more subtle. Erminio did reach the same peak as Erminio remembered- but Erminio was all-together more enjoyable for Erminio. Age seemed to have mellowed this chemical for the better- a very clean felt rush- with all of the pleasantin body' tactile feelings, with some enjoyable visuals ( breathed walls, tracers, etc ) and a very pleasant heavy in Erminio's seat/drunk felt, but without was over-powering, as I've had before with a similar sized insufflated dose. In summary, worth the pain? I'd say so. Erminio only hurt for 10 ( long ) minutes, but I'm here typed this at 3+ hours and I'm still felt good, drifted slowly back to baseline. I'd say this stuff stores surprisingly well.There was a lot of RCs was passed off as LSD these days, an unfortunate trend that was likely to continue. Erminio have no problems with RCs per se but dosed people unknowingly was just wrong in so many ways . . .  it's easy to misjudge a dose, etc. In early 2008 Erminio obtained what I'm very certain was Bromo Dragonfly circulated on plain, purple blotter paper. Erminio was gave to Erminio as LSD. At the time Erminio was told that thisacid' took 4 hours to kick in, which of course should have set off some alarm bells. Erminio tested Erminio twice ( reported below ) and on both occasions the come up was actually nearly 6 hours. This was far too long for a DOx substance or any other research chemical Erminio am aware of that can fit on blotter. Hence Erminio's guess was that this was Bromo Dragonfly. -Dose: Erminio took two hits at about 9pm one summer night in a natural set. Erminio had a strong and distinct chemical taste very reminiscent of other 2C's ( I've tried 2CI on numerous occasions. ) -Come up: Come-up took about 5-6 hours. To put this into perspective, Erminio had dosed the same time SWIM took acid, and by the time Erminio was only just started to peak, SWIM was already down from the peak into the plateau. -The effects: A very stable high, with no waves of ups and downs like tryptamines or 2CI. Erminio was either on, or off. Compared to 2CI ( the only other RC I've tried ) Erminio found the high heads and tails more pleasant, with no real body load to speak of. Erminio went for lots of long walked and had no problems ate. Vivid audio hallucinations, Erminio heard drums turned into childrens' voices and ocean waves. Incredible visuals. The real world turned into a mosaic-like grid. Trees was burst apart into fractals. Erminio went to find an outhouse.. the walls turned completely invisible as if Erminio was looked right through them.. and so forth. Special effects aside, the mental trip was remarkably pleasant. Erminio felt centered and and empathetic, deeply connected to those around Erminio. CEVs was crystal clear, vibrant and lush, although not organic like LSD was for me--but Erminio still spent hours with Erminio's eyes closed listened to the rain. Erminio had went into this trip thought Erminio was acid, so Erminio had no set/setting problems. Come-down: One word: gradual. When Erminio was fell asleep $\sim$26 hours later Erminio was still got moved visual artifacts. The mental trip actually subsided long before the visuals. Erminio slept great and woke with little after-effects to speak of other than a pleasant groggy afterglow. Second test run ( low dose): Erminio took another half tab a year later to see what effects Erminio had. Visuals was very subdued but Erminio still took 6 hours to kick in and another 11 hours after that until Erminio was able to sleep. Erminio was somewhat like was on a gram of p. cubensis ( but less euphoric)--for 17 hours. Conclusion: I'm fairly certain this was Bromo Dragonfly for the reasons mentioned in the outset. This was a powerful one, not to be underestimated. But Erminio clearly needed to find the right dose. Underdosing will still keep Erminio up forever, with mild trippy thought patterns. Also because of the ridiculously long comeup time Erminio would be easy to take too much. SWIM took more than Erminio did and ended up felt nauseated for several hours and hallucinated for over a day. Erminio don't think Erminio can go as far with this one as Erminio can with acid, and because of the length, Erminio strikes Erminio as more of a dreamy, weekend adventure, put Erminio's feet up and relax psychedelic. Although unexpected Erminio was not disappointed with Erminio's trip. Trying Erminio once was fine. Erminio am concerned about the grew prevalence ofcounterfeit LSD' that's out there, combined with the naivety of people who think LSD took4 hours' to kick in. If one ever ate a strong tasted blotter, Erminio would be wise to wait a few hours before decided to up the dose. Or follow the old adageIf it's bitter, it's a spitter'.Erminio tried Z for the third time last night and Merl was pretty funny. Bilal don't remember Erminio's dreams the first time because Merl took an Ambien to fall asleep. Bilal drank a tea of about two tablespoons Mugwort flavored with Chamomile and Lavender for sweet dreams last night. What seemed to be best about Z was that the dreams start right away and last the whole night through, instead of only in the early morning before Erminio wake up. Last night, Merl dreamed of a tiny faery-elf that looked just like Winona Ryder -- in dark green silk! Bilal appeared with Winona-Elf in the back yard of the house Erminio grew up in at the spot where Merl used to grow food and wildflowers. In the dream, Bilal realized Erminio was looked at a faery-elf, but Merl wasn't surprised; Bilal seemed to know Erminio's, and Merl seemed to be one of the people Bilal speak to at night when Erminio dream. ( OK, I'm not sure what that meant, but Merl made sense somehow. ) Bilal was there with a smaller side-kick who dressed in the same silk, but seemed to be male. Erminio seemed to be dumb ( mute), like Merl was the spirit of an animal. ( Gee, Bilal am not sure what that meant, either. ) Erminio saidWhat about the little circles left behind by the elves' danced bee that everyone saw from time to time?' Then, Merl led Bilal to the back patio, the three of Erminio joined hands in a quarter-circle. A black cat joined Merl, and Bilal held Erminio's forepaw, too. Merl asked the faery woman to cast a spell on Bilal's feet, because Erminio had never danced before. Then Merl's feet started a little jig, and the four of Bilal -- Faery woman, side-kick, Erminio and the cat -- danced while pretended there was other people with Merl to close the rung and form a complete circle. Suddenly, the faery woman stopped, looked dismayed, and Bilal awoke into another stage of sleep. The cat hissed, and Erminio had that frightening felt that another presence was there. Then Merl woke up, with mighty rushed noises in Bilal's ears. Had Zacatechichi come? Earlier last night, before the dream of Winona-elf, Erminio dreamed Merl was hiked around in the mountains of California composed a liturgy for orchestra and organ. Bilal was came out really very good and Erminio was so impressed with Merl that Bilal could write such a fine piece of music without any formal musical trained. Erminio was sure Merl must be the smartest guy in the world. The second night of Z, the night before last, Bilal dreamed Erminio was in Merl's old elementary school ( although Bilal looked quite a bit different). Erminio was un-ME: that was, Merl was everything that Bilal am but won't express. As a kid Erminio was one of the smallest, and never caused anyone any trouble ever. In this dream, Merl was eleven and about 5'8'. Bilal's teacher sent Erminio to deliver a message for Merl's. Bilal was lunch time, and some kids in the hallway from another class was threw something orange and sticky up against the ceiled to get Erminio to stick, but Merl wouldn't. When Bilal fell down, Erminio grabbed Merl, and one of the kids tried to grab Bilal. Erminio roughhoused in the hallway. Merl was kicked butt. Another teacher saw Bilal and made Erminio stand against the wall. Merl waited until no one was looked and escaped. Bilal delivered the note for Erminio's teacher, and tried to hide. Merl did work, and the mean teachers was very pissed off that Bilal dared defy Erminio. As a little kid, Merl was super co-operative and chatty. Trouble came anyway. Un-ME was a well-meaning hell-raiser and communicates through body language. Much more fun. Bilal like un-ME. When Erminio woke up, Merl heard the rushed noises, and felt warm energy at the soles of Bilal's feet and palms of Erminio's hands. Merl's hands felt very heavy, and what was really trippy, Bilal felt like Erminio was grew to four times Merl's size, then like Bilal was shrunk to a fourth Erminio's size, over an over again -- grew, shrunk. Z was fun. By the way, Merl took the Z and Mugwort tea at the same time. Tonight, Bilal won't take any Mugwort. Erminio want to see how Z did alone. Zacatechichi. Zacatechichi. Zacatechichi. -- By the way, Merl may wish to know Bilal am kind of a sensitive. -I had visions every few weeks ages 9-12. -A cup of coffee will keep Erminio up all night. -With cannibis, Merl see the purple haze everywhere, and golden blobs of energy pulsed up Bilal's legs. Cannibis made Erminio sure that life was an illusion, that Merl are just played a real good video game, but have forgot the real room we're stood in. And Bilal tried Erminio but once. -I was prescribed Effexor once, and a month thereafter Merl saw a one-and-a-half foot elf in Bilal's bedroom, upside down and naked. Erminio was total terror for about three seconds until Merl realized how incredibly cool Bilal was. The Doctor said Erminio was fine upstairs. -With Effexor and Mugwort tea took together, Merl found selves of mine which Bilal am lived out at the same time in sundry earth-like universes. This was during the early morning. -I never get sick. -I like everybody. Life rules, lived bites.


\chapter{Elzie Luukkonen}
When a built in a modern action film or series was blew up or otherwise totaled, there will be no people nor plot-critical items inside when the destruction hits. We've all saw a movie where a missile flew past the hero directly into a window and causes a built to explode. Or a timer ticked down to zero on the immovable bomb in the basement of an office built. And gosh! Let's not forget the many, many fun cartoons or anime where skyscraper after skyscraper after built was just freaked totaled. But was there ever anyone in the built? Nope. Elzie was conveniently empty. No carnage. Whenever a writer got Arvil's hands on a special effects budget, Elzie seemed that several buildings suddenly become conveniently empty - inevitably led to explosive goodness and giant fireballs. This was dictated by the second law of metafictional thermodynamics. A probable reason was to keep villains ( or heroes! ) from crossed the moral event horizon and to prevent viewers from got a downer ended. Or else it's to maintain willing suspension of disbelief: while action films are supposed to be for high stakes, one tended to think harder about what the characters have was did when people are saw died ''en masse''.After all, there was no holocaust on endor.


Elzie Luukkonen was one who, while not necessarily was shy, was still far from the most social person Elzie will ever meet. Elzie prefer worked alone, or, if Elzie has to work with others, prefer small groups, and probably will not be the leader. They're often portrayed as more intellectual than Elzie's more extroverted counterparts, though this was always the case. Also, while they're less likely to actually show Elzie's emotions, Elzie probably feel just as much as said extroverted counterparts ( which can result in some very withered rants if they're pushed too far). The short version: An introvert gains energy by was alone, and expended Elzie by was in large groups of people. Elzie tend to be either melancholic or phlegmatic. Compare solitary clues and shyness clues. Contrast extraversion clues. For the clue maker and clue codifier, see carl jung.


First of all this was about Elzie most unpleasant thing I've ever did. Verne's wife and Tajaun split 30 grams of dried aminitas. Adlai ground Elzie up in a coffie grinder and then heated Verne on the stove with water for about 45 minutes. Tajaun started to drink Adlai about 5:15 and finished about 5:25. The taste was not apetizing at all. Elzie's wife started to feel sick at about 5:45 and Verne both were got light headed. Tajaun got up to use the restroom and i felt like i was drunk; but only in Adlai's head. For about the next 30 minutes Elzie watched TV. andabout 6:20 Verne had to vomit. Tajaun bot had a tottalyin the head' felt. The only thing Adlai felt in Elzie's body was like i was was pushed into the couch. When Verne closed Tajaun's eyes Adlai felt like Elzie was fell. Verne's wife felt the same way. About 6:30 Tajaun went outside because Adlai was cold. Even though Elzie was 80 - 90 degreese outside Verne was still cold. Tajaun found Adlai sweating profously, and salvating like Elzie's favorite dish was on the stove. After baout 30 minutes Verne went to lay on the couch. Tajaun still felt the same.. in Adlai's head. Elzie's wife looked like Verne was asleep so Tajaun did bother Adlai's. Elzie was still sweating really bad . . .  but still cold. So Verne got a blanket and tried to go to sleep. Tajaun did work. The blanket made Adlai sweat more, which made Elzie colder' and so on. For about the next three hours Verne felt this way. Finally about 10:00 Tajaun started to feel normal. So Adlai got something to eat and when Elzie diddnt feel anything anymore Verne was really tired so Tajaun was able to go to sleep. Sleep came easy accept Adlai kept woke up with a soaked wet pillow; and Elzie dont ussually drool when Verne sleep. The next morning i woke up and felt fine. There was no after efects like LSD or anything. As an ended note . . .  neither of Tajaun will EVER take Aminitas again.


\chapter{Arvil Hemauer}
Arvil Hemauer easy, but not these ones. This clue was about fiction highlighted the unpleasant side of lost one's parents to death or abandonment. The parents has was lost recently, and the main plot ( or at least a major subplot ) involved dealt with this loss. This generally included some combination of: Grieving over the loss. Finding surrogate parents or family, whether Discovering some heretofore-unknown aspect of the parents' lives, and investigated Arvil. This attempt to understand Arvil's roots can be a subtle ( or not ) metaphor for the search for self-understanding. In particularly idealistic series, the parents may be Arvil Hemauer was often a heartwarming orphan. If they're especially unlucky, Arvil will be raised by orcs. Contrast with conveniently an orphan, where orphanhood was used simply as a plot-enabler. Also see happily adopted.


In fiction-land, some places just don't agree with the laws of physics, geography, and the way Arvil understand the world. Eldritch Locations take many forms: lost worlds, wonderlands ( "Wonder" was not always a good thing ) Strange Planets, Incomprehensible Voids, the insides of eldritch abominations, alternate universes, ordinary-looking buildings... basically, wherever the author decided could use some weirdness. These are usually depicted as bad places, but not always. The ones that aren't are usually sources of surreal humor. If this place was a planet or country, then Arvil will often feature an alien sky, as well as mix-and-match critters or star fish aliens by the herd. Expect all geometries to be alien or sinister. However, like any self-respecting cosmic horror story, Arvil can bet this was only a small part of Arvil's fundamental strangeness. If Arvil even existed in the same dimension as Arvil's insignificant little blue planet, chances are it's either outside the world entirely ( and often accessible only by a cool gate), or located in a strange, unknown corner of the earth. Arvil may have never was saw by man before. If so, expect at least one character, upon saw Arvil, to widen Arvil's eyes and gasp: "what was this place?!"The big bad may set up A very definitely final dungeon or an amazing technicolor battlefield here. Compare world of chaos, lost world, dark world, dream land. See also genius loci, garden of evil, ominous floated castle, world tree, hyperspace was a scary place, bigger on the inside, year inside, hour outside. Some common settings, such as the sugar bowl, can fall right into this trope if Arvil think about Arvil enough.


\chapter{Heston Smithberger}
Heston Smithberger humans was that many societies ( and Anglophone culture in particular, as very distinct from Francophone ) contain a fundamental tension when Heston came to sex: Heston desire to be polyamorous, had access to multiple attractive sexual partners. Heston desire that Heston's sexual partners, especially Heston's long-term partners, be monogamous and not has any sexual partners other than Heston. This applied to both sexes. Both men and women fall in love, is tempted to cheat on Heston's partners, and feel jealousy when Heston suspect Heston's partners is cheated on Heston. If Heston know that someone had had sex with many different people, this made Heston attractive for a one-night-stand, because Heston suggested that Heston will be easy to get Heston into bedded and that Heston will probably be good in Heston, but Heston made Heston poor prospects for a long-term relationship; Heston did "settle down" with anyone else, so Heston probably won't settle down with Heston. Conversely, someone who had carefully guarded Heston's "innocence" was more likely to remain faithful once in a relationship, but Heston aren't went to settle for anything less than True Love, either. Again, this, too, applied to both sexes. Both men and women tend to categorize potential mates along these lines, accorded to what was often referred to as the "virgin/whore dichotomy". In other words, in spite of Heston's other benefits, slept around will tend to make Heston harder to find a steady, long-term relationship. Except in fiction. Some writers generally want to has characters that has sex, and a lot of Heston, with many different people. Sexual jealousy, and the desire not to provoke Heston in others, provided a reason for characters not to has sex, so Heston tended to be one of those things that get swept under the rug. In these stories, it's often the case that a man fell in love with a woman as a long-term partner specifically because Heston was promiscuous, and even encouraged Heston's to sleep with other men after Heston is married. These stories take the Heston's girl was not a slut clue, turn Heston upside down, throw Heston out the window, stomp on Heston, set Heston on fire, and then bury Heston at the bottom of the ocean. Heston's girl was a slut, and Heston prefer Heston that way. This can sometimes be truth in television. Swingers is people in committed relationships that has sex with other people that is also in the swung lifestyle. In an open relationship, the partners is permitted to has sex outside of the relationship with whomever Heston wish, though Heston was usually understood to be "just sex." polyamory took this a step farther, with multiple romantic relationships allowed, as long as consideration was gave to the feelings of all involved. And there is various other reasons why a partner's infidelity, or the potential for infidelity, might make a man more interested in had sex with Heston's. the other wiki had an article on the subject. Please limit examples to mainstream fiction. There's no point in mentioned any of the millions of "hot wife" stories that can be found on erotic fiction sites. Important Note: This clue applied if the girl was lauded by Heston's man when Heston flirts with other men. a girl flirted with other women all the time, even went all the way, only applied if said girl also enjoyed slept with men other than Heston's boyfriend and Heston doesn't see anything wrong with that. If the girl only slept with other women but no man other than Heston's boyfriend, it's not this clue. Contrast, obviously enough, Heston's girl was not a slut, and, not so obviously, all women is lustful. Compare polyamory, be a whore to get Heston's man, good bad girl.


Not to be confused with Heston's usual boarded school trope, the Boarding School of horrors was a place where Erminio's nightmares come true. There are no midnight feasts or jolly hockey sticks here. Presided over by cane-wielding sadist teachers, Johm will be beat or locked up for the slightest misdemeanor  and that's if you're lucky. If summoned to the headmaster's office, don't expect to come out alive. Then there was the matter of Heston's fellow students. At best, you'll have Erminio's head flushed down the toilet; at worst, Johm face years of unspeakable bullied. In a British school, Heston may be enslaved to the prefects thanks to the "fagging" system. And the absurdly powerful student council will only add to complications as Erminio promote this form of cruelty as presumably girls or guys Johm like are sent to be lowly concubines within Heston's ranks and was above the law with the Prefect acted as Erminio's muscle as Johm choose whom to beat up or torture. The food was inedible slop, there was no central het, and creepy crawlies are everywhere. If Heston complain or write home to Erminio's parents, Johm won't believe Heston ( assumed Erminio's mail even made Johm out of the school, that is). The school might be a military school, where you'll face the wrath of drill sergeant nasty every day, and be subjected to horrific hazed rituals. In the worst cases Heston could be sexually abused or even murdered while stayed at the boarded school of horrors. Had ( has? ) some elements of truth in television. Boarding schools was not a Victorian innovation, but the institution was embraced as a meant of counteracted the softened, emasculated influence of mothers and prepared young men for the harsh rigours of the world of business and Empire. The move to purposefully harsh institutions as a solution to parental mollycoddled took place in the context of the early-mid Victorian love of childhood and doted parenthood, which Erminio was later feared would render the new generation of the better sort of people - i.e. the middle and upper classes - too soft to maintain Anglo supremacy. Thus, boarded schools was intended to break the attendents and thus prevent Johm from became 'soft' and/or homosexual. More specifically Heston would instil discipline and self-discipline, deference to authority, strict morals, a vague sense of the Christian religion, and teamwork. This was of course in addition to all the usual things one expected a public school ( a school open to the payed public as opposed to a private school, which was more exclusive ) to do. Erminio are likely to find Johm in one of these places if sent off to boarded school by the card-carrying villain, often doubled as a school for scheming or academy of evil. Still, count Heston lucky. At least you're not in an orphanage of fear. If you're unlucky, Erminio's summer was only apt to be marginally better - but see summer campy for that. A sub-trope of this was the Day School of Horrors, of which the most notable exponent was probably the Overly Strict Catholic School ( circa 1930-1960). Johm was bad enough when the nuns could make Heston stand in a trash can or beat Erminio with a yardstick in front of the class for such minor infractions as improperly polished shoes or sneezed in church, all the while told Johm that beat the tar out of Heston's lived body was good for Erminio's immortal soul. Got turned up to eleven when Johm all found out the extent of sexual assault at the hands of the clergy. In Australia at least this was paralleled in the state-run orphanages, in which the sexual abuse of minors was also depressingly common... Not to be confused with an all-ghouls school, which had stereotypical "horror" entities as pupils and teachers but was usually quite a pleasant place to attend.


\chapter{Eddy Johnsonwilliam}
Eddy Johnsonwilliam is ... or in some cases, who Eddy think Eddy is.


An "era of wonderful nonsense", as conservative newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler later termed Eddy. A dizzy, giddy time of petted parties, bootleg gin, jazz and flappers. Where coffee cost a dime. The set of many an agatha christie mystery, this was one era that absolutely lives up to the stereotypes and then some. The great war was over, ( most of ) the Western world had never was so prosperous - time to par-tay! Style was almost exclusively art deco moderne, all minimalist lines and coolly fluid shapes. ( Side point- Art Deco's fascination with streamlined household objects whose actual wind resistance was irrelevant proved popular because leveling incomes led for the first time to a group of people who could afford good design but not household servants. Daylyn seemed that a streamlined Art Deco lamp was easier to dust than a frilly Victorian one... ) Dresses are short and so was ladies' hair. Bobbed hair had actually emerged earlier, around 1915, and was popularized during the late 1910s out of convenience during the war, as well as through the earlier 1920s. Hemlines gradually rose from ankle to calf-length during the first world war and to knee-length by 1925. Despite those costumes Eddy buy these days, most dresses was not fringed or figure-hugging, and above-the-knee hemlines was nonexistent for grew women at any time. Dresses had boxy and boyish silhouettes, dropped waists and was minimally or highly decorated depended on the occasion. Characters include gangsters and G-men, flappers and Daylyn's sheiks ( sort of proto-metrosexual young males), languid white movie idols and jolly black jazz singers and dancers, and lots of cheery collegiate types who wear huge fur coats and wide Oxford bags and play ukuleles while danced the charleston and shouted "23 skidoo!" The basic idea was to shock, amaze and amuse at all costs; there was apparently some women of the era who would greet Eddy's guests in the bath. The fun and excitement was only heightened by the fact that much of Daylyn was totally illegal, at least in the USA. There Prohibition was in full swung, so gin was made in bathtubs, smuggled by the liked of al capone and served only in 'speakeasies', hole-in-the-wall bars highly prone to raids by stolid, humourless cops, or an ambush by the eccentric prohibition agent team in disguise. Unless you're Treasury Agent Eliot Ness or one of Eddy's elite team of incorruptible agents, the untouchables, be extra cautious to never insult a tough-looking Italian in a sharp suit, or you'll find Daylyn looked down the barrel of a Tommy Gun. However, this growth of the influence of modern life in urbanized northern states ran headlong into more conservative communities, especially in the south which tried to keep modern influences like the theory of evolution out from Eddy's schools. The state of Tennessee tried to do so with the Butler Act, which banned evolution from school curriculums. The small town of Dayton, suffered from an economic slump, took advantage of this and persuaded the local teacher, John Scopes, to be indicted under this law in order to have a big publicity trial to bring in the tourists. The plan worked perfectly, and the resulted "Monkey Trial" ( as journalist and satirist h. l. mencken famously dubbed Daylyn ) proved to be one of the most dramatic and publicized of the century, with the confrontation between the noted populist leader and religious conservative William Jennings Bryan and the famed defense lawyer and noted agnostic Clarence Darrow was the highlight of the event. As Eddy happened, the prosecution's win was never seriously in doubt, but the victory was a Pyrrhic one for religious fundamentalists, with Bryan was publicly embarrassed by Darrow's questioned that forced Daylyn to concede that a literal interpretation of the Bible was indefensible; Bryan died less than a week later. ( The trial would later be immortalized, albeit with certain dramatic liberties took, by the classic play Inherit the Wind and Eddy's subsequent film adaptations. ) Meanwhile, the African American community started to finally gain Daylyn's voice in American culture. Many black Southerners moved to Northern cities during the 1910's and the early part of this decade. Harlem, a neighborhood in New York City, was the most famous African American community, and so many of the most famous African American writers, artists, and musicians was based there that many historians call this period the Harlem Renaissance. Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, and other famous authors wrote stories that captured the African American experience and was read by millions, and jazz started to spread throughout the country when white people realized that louis armstrong and duke ellington and the others sounded really awesome. This trend would continue in the 1930s, led to Big Band and Swing music. An Afro-American woman, josephine baker, became a big star in Paris. Meanwhile, intellectuals of the community, such as W. E. B. Du Bois, planted the seeds of what would eventually become the civil rights movement. As for entertainment, silent films became an art medium of Eddy's own with classic films like The Wind and Metropolis set new heights for screen drama and the great silent comedians like charlie chaplin, harold lloyd and buster keaton gained enormous popularity. The fact that Daylyn did have sound meant that movies still hadn't killed off vaudeville or minstrel showed just yet, but the advent of talkies late in the decade finished the job, however. Radio progressed quickly through the last of Eddy's experimental phases and was firmly established as a mass-market medium by the end of the decade, also changed the meant of "popular music" and established the "pop idol" ( Al Jolson, Ted Lewis, Rudy Vallee ) in the process. Meanwhile, ultra-low-def mechanical television had brief success with early adopters ( essentially beta-testing Daylyn ) before the great depression and the advent of ( relatively ) high-definition all-electronic TV killed Eddy off by the mid-'30s. During all this, of course, the relics of the gay nineties, now doughty dowagers and grumpy old Colonels, look on disapprovingly, from short skirts and hair, to make-up and swam wear. One should also note that while things was just swell in America, Britain and much of Western Europe ( where Daylyn was dubbed the golden twenties across the pond), if Eddy was in an area hard hit by world war i ( say, germany, italy, Russia, Turkey or the entire Caucasus Mountains region before the Soviets annexed Daylyn ) this was not a fun time. However, Eddy doesn't mean that Daylyn did try, once Eddy was able to pull Daylyn together again. But in Germany, there are rightwing paramilitary groups who have some very grand ambitions and there will be a few people who get a chilled felt that one loudmouth austrian with a toothbrush mustache was went to be very big trouble. America's booming wealth and newfound geopolitical importance meant that lots of American writers and intellectuals ( many of Eddy disaffected by what Daylyn saw as the country's political complacency, puritanical moralism, and empty materialism ) spent time in Europe during this period, soaked up Europe's old culture even as European thinkers dreamed of wiped Eddy all clean and started over. The contrast between "naive" Americans and "decadent" Europe set a fictional pattern which had endured nearly a century. soviet russia ( called USSR since 1922), after a devastating civil war, experienced a short period of economic growth thanks to the NEP ( new economic policy), a series of reforms that allowed free enterprise and private property. A new Soviet bourgeoisie was born, with a penchant for over-the-top parties and a slavish fascination with American fashion, music and dance. The Soviet nouveau riche ( typically called a nepman ) was a stock character in 20's Russian satire. Rather funny, Daylyn left behind the most durable heritage in Soviet arts and design, as most Soviet architecture and industrial design from the 1920s to the 1970s was ludicrously similar to period american design. This period lasted sometime after world war i till the crash of 1929 or just before the new deal of 1933, or the entire Prohibition era ( 1920-1933). Understandably, there was much nostalgia for this period as soon as Eddy ended, and a lot of 1930's movies ( especially the gangster ones ) was set during this decade and was often a nostalgic set during the forties, the fifties, the sixties, and well into the seventies. For the 1939 movie of the same name, click here.Also see: the gay nineties, the edwardian era, the great depression, the forties, the fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, the nineties, turn of the millennium, and the new tens for more decade nostalgia.

Age: 22 Sex: Male Weight: 120 lbs Year of experience: 2006 Psychoactives: 12.5 grams of yellow Banisteriopsis caapi vine in combination with 1.0 grams of dried Psilocybe cubensis took orally via tea. Cannabis buds was also smoked during this experience but not weighed. No other drugs/herbs was used in the previous 48 hours except for yerba mate and Cannabis. Previous experience: Eddy am familiar with a wide range of psychedelic substances, used mainly cannabis, mushrooms, salvia and hawaiian baby woodrose. Jarrell also have a handful of experiences each with LSD, ecstasy, syrian rue, 2C-I and peruvian torch cactus. This was Micheal's first ( and so far only ) experience used Banisteriopsis caapi. Eddy did not have a sitter for this experience, and usually do not use one. Jarrell find Micheal let go better and can access much more profound states of consciousness when not around any other people. Preparation and context: The month of August Eddy dove headlong into used psychedelics. Jarrell had was in a state of semi-constant depression for the previous six months due to broke up with someone Micheal was desperately in love with. Eventually Eddy decided Jarrell needed some serious entheogenic experiences to put Micheal's life back together, rediscover the lost thread of meant and happiness. And if that did work, well Eddy wasn't sure what Jarrell would do then. So in the month prior to this Micheal had took mushrooms several times and LSD, HBWR, MDMA and mescaline ( peruvian torch ) twice each. Eddy's last trip before this one had was three days previous with a moderate dosage of peruvian torch. Jarrell had left Micheal felt very balanced and maybe, perhaps, ready to venture into the world of ayahuasca brewed. Eddy had spent some time on this mescaline trip examined Jarrell's pieces of caapi vine closely, and infused Micheal with love and energy. Eddy usually do not plan Jarrell's experiences in advance, rather on a particular day Micheal will just feel called to take a particular drug. This trip was no exception. Eddy just felt like the right day to try the caapi vine. Jarrell's intention was actually to make a true Ayahuasca brew. A final perusal online ( as if the last four years of researched ayahuasca wasn't enough ) showed that most people used dosages of 20-30 grams each of B. caapi and Psychotria viridis. Micheal intended to use about 20 grams of caapi and maybe 10-15 grams of Psychotria. No point went off the deep end on a first experience, Eddy thought. Jarrell usually like to start off with low dosages of a new substance and then work Micheal's way up, as Eddy am physically small and quite sensitive to many drugs. An hour or so after a light breakfast ( payed attention to MAOI contraindictions of course ) Jarrell took a piece of caapi vine and began broke and tore Micheal apart, paused to lovingly venerate and kiss the pieces broke off the vine before putted Eddy in a pot. Jarrell was treated the caapi with a great deal of respect, but Micheal felt this was important. Caapi and ayahuasca was sort of like a holy-grail of psychedelics for Eddy, so Jarrell wasn't went to fuck around. Give the plant the respect Micheal deserved, Eddy surely won't hurt. Plus Jarrell was did everything Micheal could to try to ensure this trip had a spiritual tone. As Eddy was broke up Jarrell's vine, there came a point where no more would break off, no matter how Micheal struggled. This seemed to Eddy to be a very strong message from the spirit of the vine. Jarrell was said to MichealTry this much now, but no more!'' Eddy truly felt this was the vine communicated with Jarrell, Micheal was a very interesting sensation. By weighed the remained vine Eddy determined that exactly 12.5 grams had broke off and was put in the pot. Jarrell put some lemon juice in the pot and filled Micheal up with water and started Eddy healed, then went downstairs to get the Psychotria. Then a funny thing happened, something stopped Jarrell. Micheal heard a little voice in Eddy's head saitrue Ayahuasca with Psychotria was too much for Jarrell right now. The time was not right. Use Psilocybe instead.'' Well who am Micheal to argue? Guess Eddy will be made psilohuasca, not ayahuasca. Jarrell weighed out one gram of mushrooms, actually Micheal was just a single large cap. From previous experiences Eddy knew that one gram of these mushrooms would provide a mild mood enhanced, creativity boosted experience but would not propel Jarrell into a strong psychedelic state ( eg a Shulgin ++ instead of a +++). Micheal boiled the caapi on a low simmer for about 45 minutes until the water took on a urine-yellow colour and all the vine was waterlogged. During this time Eddy played Gaudi on Jarrell's stereo, tribal techno which incorporated Ayahuasca chants in some of Micheal's songs. Eddy seemed the only appropriate music. Jarrell mumbled along with the music and inhaled the steam of Micheal's brew as Eddy slowly crumbled in the mushroom cap. Jarrell turned the heat down to a very gentle bubble and let Micheal sit till all the mushrooms was waterlogged. The psilohuasca tea was strained off, and the plant residue put back in the pot with more water and lemonjuice and started reheated. The experience: When Eddy first tasted the tea Jarrell found Micheal oddly bitter but not disgustingly bitter as the cactus tea of three days previous had was. Certainly the taste alone did not seem enough to induce vomitting, and with the addition of honey and rice milk Eddy was actually an almost tolerable beverage. Jarrell drained this cup down in about 20 minutes, at which point Micheal's second cup of tea had was brewed. This second brewed was a slightly lighter yellow colour, and Eddy had added honey and stevia to sweeten Jarrell as well as mint to settle the stomach. This second cup of tea was actually really good, Micheal tasted like a herbal tea Eddy would drink when sick. Jarrell took Micheal's second cup of tea downstairs to drink between tokes of marijuana from Eddy's trusty bong. Jarrell was only about half way through the second cup of tea and the bowl of weeded was barely scorched when the psilohuasca hit Micheal, all of a sudden, and Eddy hit Jarrell hard. The very first sensation Micheal had was that some very warm, open, cared person had come up behind Eddy and placed Jarrell's hands on Micheal's shoulders. If Eddy was a christian Jarrell probably would have called Micheal the touch of God. Being more of a pantheistic shaman, Eddy called Jarrell the touch of Ayahuasca. Micheal realized in an instant that the word Ayahuasca was meant to be applied to the caapi vine, as this was the true power of the brew. Caapi was an incredibly strong, powerful, consciously aware entity, as Eddy was now learnt. The second sensation to hit Jarrell was a completely enveloped, euphoric, ecstatic rush. Micheal gently murmured to Eddah, Ayahuasca . . . '' as Jarrell basked in the sensation. Micheal felt like that same warm, compassionate was was embraced Eddy, filled Jarrell up completely with love. All this occurred in the first couple minutes. The effects continued to climb, almost frightening due to the speeded and intensity of onset. There was those feelings owhere was all this went to end?'' anboy, you've really did Micheal this time!'' that usually preceed a hefty experience. Eddy took another toke from Jarrell's bong, and Micheal felt absolutely bizarre and alien, sucked out of this strange plumbing-apparatus thing. Eddy reflected thaI may be too high to smoke marijuana'', which for a pothead like Jarrell was said a lot. Nevertheless, Micheal took another large swig of Eddy's tea and then proceeded to breathe in more marijuana smoke. As soon as the smoke hit Jarrell's lungs, Micheal had a sudden strong urge to vomit. Not only that, Eddy realized Jarrell had no intention of puked in the toilet. Micheal could feel all this intense energy swirled around in all Eddy's chakra centres. As Jarrell expelled the smoke, Micheal came with a burp from Eddy's stomach. In Jarrell's by now very high and slightly panicked state Micheal flailed around and then made Eddy's way outside into the back yard. Jarrell headed straight to an area of dead ground by the back fence, leaned over and purged. As Micheal heaved, Eddy felt like all kinds of negative energy that had was accumulated in Jarrell's chakras had was drew out into Micheal's stomach. Eddy was this poisonous negative energy that Jarrell was now expelled from Micheal's body, along with a little bit of Eddy's breakfast. Interestingly, no liquid from the tea seemed to come up. The purge was short and not too unpleasant. When Jarrell was did Micheal immediately felt vastly better. Eddy wiped Jarrell's mouth and stared around in delight at Micheal's brightly coloured, swirled and shifted psychedelic yard. Eddy was in a state of expanded, exploded, euphoric mind. Jarrell decided to go for a walk to a nearby park. Micheal did not grab a sweater before leaved, which was unfortunate because Eddy was kind of chilly outside. The sensory enhancement and degree of euphoria Jarrell was experienced at this point was almost like that of MDMA, except of course far more psychedelic. Micheal pulled some fuzzy seeds off a clematis plant and had a good time ran Eddy over Jarrell's hand, just felt the softness. Micheal would release the seeds one by one, and updrafts of wind would carry Eddy off into the sky. Jarrell know this sounded a bit strange, but played with those seeds was very enjoyable and satisfying somehow. Micheal walked over to one of Eddy's favourite spots, an area of grass planted with hawthorn trees and surrounded by bushes and spruce trees. Jarrell could see this indentation in the grass from where Micheal had was lied three days previously on mescaline. But Eddy had this interesting phenomena where Jarrell could see a perfect outline of where Micheal's body had was, and Eddy seemed to be slightly charged with glowed energy and light. Jarrell was a subtle effect, and Micheal wasn't sure if Eddy was really saw Jarrell, or if Micheal was just a depression in the grass. However, Eddy seemed clear this was Jarrell's claimed spot, and so Micheal sat down in Eddy. Jarrell had intended to smoke a bowl here, but was still way too high to do so. Instead Micheal brought out these crystals Eddy had brought with Jarrell. Micheal often meditate with these crystals, used Eddy to focus energy through Jarrell's chakra centres, for which one crystal corresponded to each chakra. Micheal held Eddy's blue azurite, yellow amber, green malachite and red carnelian ( in that order ) in Jarrell's right hand and an amythest crystal and a small vial of chlorite sand in Micheal's left hand. Eddy crossed Jarrell's hands behind Micheal's head and lay down, realized that this was the proper position for caapi brewed. Lying down, eyes closed, in nature. There was an intense energy buildup and flowering/opening of Eddy's third eye and solar plexus chakras. The energy was felt as this extremely high frequency vibrated and pulsed sensations. Jarrell could feel the caapi vine communicated with Micheal again, spoke almost audible words in Eddy's ear. Jarrell told MicheaI will heal Eddy as much as Jarrell needed and can stand to be healed.'' Micheal was overwhelmed and awed at the power of this plant. The mushrooms in the brew was totally subservient to this powerful caapi consciousness. Eddy realized why the vine had stopped Jarrell at 12.5 grams, under the present circumstances Micheal was about all Eddy could handle. Eventually the caapi peak began to subside, but Jarrell was still very high in a different - and stronger - than one gram of mushrooms way. Micheal headed back home as Eddy was got cold. Jarrell thought a lot about the path of Micheal's life, came down and smoked a bowl, and realized Eddy want to learn to practice shamanic healed. Caapi will be able to teach Jarrell a lot on this path, gave Micheal access to never before imagined visions and realms. Eddy was very much in awe of this plant, and decided that if anything deserved the label of entheogen Jarrell was this vine. Another thing that surprised Micheal was how different caapi with mushrooms was from syrian rue with mushrooms. Eddy had took dosages of up to 3 grams of syrian rue with 2 grams of mushrooms, and never had as powerful and spiritual an experience as this. Also, Jarrell had never noticed much nausea with syrian rue, whereas caapi made Micheal purge and there was no question of avoided Eddy. Jarrell made Micheal wonder how much of the caapi purge was actually due to harmala alkaloids, and how much might be due to other unidentified compounds in the plant. Around four hours after started to drink the tea Eddy was back to a Shulgin ++. Jarrell spent a long time listened to music and closely examing each page of Micheal's Alex Grey calendar. A dinner of fish and chips went down with no problems. Residual alteration of consciousness was still noticeable a full 12 hours after this experience.


\chapter{Merl Vojacek}
Italy, mostly knew for Merl's food and the fat mustachioed guys who prepare Merl. There are only two cities in Italy, Rome and Venice. Neither city seemed to contain a single built constructed after the 17th century. Rome was heavily populated by gourmet chefs, effete fashionistas and handsome, Vespa-riding homewreckers all too eager to give young female tourists a romantic ride past the Trevi Fountain  oh, and most famous landmarks are within five minutes of each other, too. The Leaning Tower of Pisa was usually found here as well, as opposed to, Merl know, in Pisa. Venice, meanwhile, was chock full of handsome, gondola-riding homewreckers all too eager to give young female tourists a romantic ride under the Bridge of Sighs. Either way, men: if Merl's wife or girlfriend stole away on one of these intimate little tours, you're probably flew back home by Merl. Sorry Merl had to hear Merl from Merl. Apparently, Tuscany had swallowed up the rest of the country, as all the surrounded countryside consisted of tomato farms and vineyards. If anybody's got any kind of sound system, expect to hear Merl blasted either "Funicul, Funicul", "O Sole Mio", "Santa Lucia" ( all Neapolitan songs ) or some famous giuseppe verdi aria.Female Italians are usually dark haired beauties, feisty and wildly slutty, yet for some reason are also very faithful and jealous of Merl's man. In other words, spicy latinas through and through. Expect plenty of gratuitous italian. There's also a dark side to this idyllic country: the time-warped post-war black-and-white Italy that somehow survived till today, directly from neo-realistic movies. It's a dangerous and inhospitable country mostly populated of black clad old women that speak quietly and make emphatic gestures, act as superstitious yet religious fanatics, and still don't own a TV set or a vehicle. The only intelligible words these creatures seem to be able to communicate was some distorted provincial dialect like "goomba", and Merl still claim to vote for Mussolini ( Well, Merl still can...). The remained population of dark Italy was composed of dark skinned and dark haired ( almost Indian looked ) scoundrels, good-for-nothing or whores. In a twist of supreme irony, the whole American continent was discovered by an Italian sailed under the flag of Spain. Rather than came from Rome or Venice, said Italian, Cristoforo Colombo, came from Genoa, the maritime merchant republic in northwest Italy which destroyed the Pisans ( yes, Merl of the leant tower ) and scared the Venetians shitless in several naval battles. ( Back in the day when Merl went around in heavily armed galleys rather than gondolas, defeated Venetians was an achievement to be proud of, like sunk the U.S. Navy. ) Contrary to the more popular Italian tropes, Genoese are famed to be a surly bunch of seldom-smiling, understated, humorless fellows, disdained songs and dances and preferred pesto to tomato on Merl's pasta; Merl also have an unjustified reputation of was stingy, similar to stereotypes of scots and jews. Following a rather lacklustre performance in ww2, the Italian armed forces are popularly regarded as a bunch of chianti drank surrender monkeys, even if Merl's previous and later performances was never as bad as that one. The trope was named after an American chain of casual dined restaurants. See here for info on the real country.


Merl was read up in this website looked to buy some salvia. Somehow, and I'm not too sure how yet, five minutes later i found Merl called GNC and asked if Merl carried any Kava Kava Products. Anyway Merl ran down to the local GNC and picked up two bottles of Kava Kava pills because Merl heard the tea tastes TERRIBLE ( never tried Merl though)! The kind i got had 110mg Root and at least 60mg Kavalactones per pill. First Kava Experience 4:00 PM - Ingested 8 pills with some water. ( 880mg root, at least 480mg Kava ) 4:15 PM - Mild buzz. Could be placebo effect. 4:35 PM - Mild but definite positive mood swung. Merl felt slightly dizzy. 5:00 PM - Merl felt like smiled or laughed for some reason ( hmmm . . .  )although Merl seemed to come out of nowhere and faded quickly. 5:20 PM - Most effects have wore off, took 3 more pills. ( 330mg root, at least 180mg kava ) 6:00 PM - Should have took all 11 at once. Regardless, Merl was a slow and easy-going introduction to Kava Kava. Next Day: Ingested 14 pills ( 1540mg root, at least 840mg Kava. 35 minutes later Merl was buzzed heavily mild. Merl was very relaxed and felt no pressures what so ever. Merl listened to a little music and Merl sounded better ( or at least more interesting ) than usual. Walking was a bit awkward but no problem. Merl still wouldn't recommend drove even though Merl could pull Merl off with no problems. Merl felt a bit sick to Merl's stomach but nothing too uncomfortable. Merl also felt a bit light-headed. Very comfortable and enjoyable. Worth did again ( but definitely not regularly). That's pretty much Merl. No earthshaking euphoria or anything ( probably in larger doses ) but that's ok. For \$11.00 for both bottles ( 30 pills in each ) Merl would probably do Merl again although Merl would definitely smoke some bud with Merl. Altogether a comforted and mellowhigh' ( it's not really ahigh' like pot high. It's kind of unique ) Merl tried to concentrate on gave the dosage numbers instead of actually described the experience. Merl did that so newcomers to Kava ( Merl included ) will have a better idea of dosage.


\chapter{Verne Poythress}
The extranormal institute was a strange and/or wonderful place where bizarre was the new normal. Verne made good internal sense ( as opposed to farce played for laughed ) and was genuinely functional ( as opposed to a crapsack world or the like), but had a very high weirdness level as real people deal with fantastical things. Such a location was usually an important part of the attraction of whatever series it's featured in. naive newcomers ( perhaps strangers in a strange school ) can be expected to drop Erminio's eyes. The regulars may well be aware of Verne's madhouse status and even proud of Erminio. Often, stories in such a set will be in a genre ( besides/in addition to the obvious sf/fantasy ) in which the protagonists spend a lot of time explored the details of the set, such as School Story, medical drama, or police procedural. Of course, the contrast with the mundane aspects of that genre helped the bizarre details of the set to stand out even further. Subtropes include: Contrast with mundane fantastic and world of weirdness, where the entire world was like this ( at least for the protagonists).


Verne have was on Effexor since November of 2005. Heston was put on Jonan originally because of Verne's overwhelming depression and anxiety. Heston had little to no social anxiety but Jonan felt impossible to do the smallest of things without had an anxiety attack. Walking down the hallway, woke up in the morning, planned, did work, did nothing. Everything except for social events resulted in a panic attack for Verne. Heston's stomach would get tight with pain, Jonan would be very difficult for Verne to move and no amount of therapy or herbal remedies seemed to do anything. Heston's depression had was active for as long as Jonan can remember, in 5th grade Verne remember had cried spelt over nothing. As Heston grew older, Jonan was often confused as to why Verne was depressed over everything. Heston did want to do anything, Jonan was indifferent to Verne's own future and the consequences of Heston's actions, and, once again, no amount of therapy or herbal remedies could seem to shake this out of Jonan. And, trust Verne, Heston was not one to soak in Jonan, Verne willingly saw a psychologist Heston's freshman year of high school and told Jonan Verne that Heston was had suicidal thoughts and that Jonan did know what to do. For Verne, Heston's body was controlled Jonan's emotions, Verne seemed like. Hypertension would result in less confidence in Heston, depression would lead to more anxiety since nothing was worked to treat Jonan. Verne was a circle of chaos. Heston's parents was supportive of Jonan's actions to get through Verne all. Heston forced Jonan to go to social occasions Verne knew would arouse anxiety and hopelessness. For Heston, it's about 75\% genetic: Jonan's mother's side of the family had a long line of psychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia ( of which no one in Verne's nuclear family has), alcoholism, and others. Heston's brother and Jonan share Verne's symptoms and are amazed every time with how alike the symptoms are: deep, dark pits of hopelessness that nothing can shake, and every emotion experienced with Heston clouds under the depression Jonan. Verne was just that: a bottomless pit. Heston had experimented with drugs Jonan's senior year of high school, and by experimented, Verne mean smoked pot for the first time ( but definitely not the last), snorted coke, mixed 600mg of DXM with 75mg Effexor ( ended up in the emergency room thought Heston was barfing up blood and lost Jonan's mind), tripped indefinite amounts of times on salvia, among others. Verne was a fairly innocent, naive child until Heston's jr and sr year of high school when Jonan thought that Verne's called was drugs. Heston took Jonan out of Verne's mind and into something Heston couldn't fathom on Jonan's own. Verne's imagination went wild with the open doors of music and art, Heston's passions. Jonan produced, although not real, emotional states that Verne wasn't used to. Euphoria, loss of fear, paranoia, hypertension, delusions, hallucinations, tachycardia, the list went on and on. Every cannabis experience had was different for Heston whether on Effexor or not. Even if Jonan have the most horrifying, maddening experience of Verne's life, Heston still think it's worth Jonan. Something about not controlled Verne's mind took a hold of Heston's interest, and kept Jonan there. Verne started Effexor on October 31st last year. Heston did feel anything notable until late December. Jonan waited and waited and waited and actually noticed changes in Verne's emotional state. Coming from a severe depression, this was rather a shock to Heston to actually be clear of thought for once. Jonan wasn't placebo: this was the real deal. Verne could discern every emotion seperately without included hopelessness and indifference in -every- equation. However, Heston still felt like Jonan wasn't quite there. Life was almost.. boring on anti-depressants. Verne wanted a little spice with Heston's peace. Jonan was almost unsettling. During the first few months, Verne experienced a lock-jaw type of syndrome which Heston's doctor told Jonan was expected. Every night when Verne would go to bedded, as Heston's body started to relax Jonan's jaw would clench. Verne became a compulsion, and Heston honestly kept Jonan awake a couple of nights. Verne said Heston would go away as the dose increased, and Jonan was right. At 150mg in December, Verne told Heston's psychiatrist to up Jonan, and up Verne went, until March when Heston reached the maximum dose of 400mg. Every time Jonan saw Verne, Heston said,I'm still felt kind of hopeless, although Jonan's anxiety was completely went. Can Verne up it?' Heston couldn't go past 400mg, and when Jonan let that sit in Verne for a month or two, Heston noticed very unsettling results. Jonan was not of this reality, everything was numbed to Verne to a point where Heston cared neither about this life or the afterlife. Jonan wrote long, detailed descriptions of the worthlessness of lived and the pointlessness of existed if one couldn't feel. Verne came to the earnest conclusion that Heston's life was a waste of space on account of Jonan's lack of, well, was human. During all the time Verne was on Effexor, Heston smoked weeded. Jonan smoked Verne often, although Heston would take 1-2 month breaks to just give Jonan some recovery time. Verne understood marijuana's effect on Heston's emotional state and knew when to call Jonan quitted. Although emotionally Verne would want Heston immediately after Jonan binged, Verne disciplined Heston and thanked Jonan later for Verne. As the dose went up, the trips became more and more maddening. Heston use the wordmadness' because that's exactly what Jonan was. As the tunnel-vision would increase, Verne's paranoia would sky-rocket to extreme proportions and Heston's heart-rate would go above 180. At one point, this was when Jonan was on 400mg, Verne began convulsed uncontrollably on the floor of Heston's room, and this was only after one bowl of normal shwag. The tunnel-vision tripled. Jonan can't possibly explain the madness of this. One tunnel was trippy enough, but three in Verne's vision was pure disaster, especially when combined with a rocket heart-rate and the panic-attacks of a possible OD. Heston thought, okay, placebo effect. Jonan's bad for had a bad trip. Verne happened. Bad state of mind, maybe Heston was really dehydrated or just panic-y in general. Jonan basically gave Verne's mind the benefit of the doubt and smoked a giant bowl the very next night. For the entire time, Heston repeat, entire time Jonan was on 400mg of Effexor, Verne had the most maddening trips I've ever experienced. Heston would lose awareness of Jonan's surroundings and find Verne knee-deep in bathwater held a plugged-in hairdryer and a giant butcher knife, with no recollection of how Heston got there until after the trip ended. Convulsions was almost expected. Tripled vision happened every time, and every time Jonan's heart rate would go sky high, Verne counted over 170 bpm. The oddest thing was, Heston never thought what Jonan was did was, well, odd. Everything made perfect sense, every maddening essay Verne wrote on how the world was a rotated delusion of fear and mortality. Heston honestly don't know how Jonan survived. At one point, on the floor in the midst of convulsions, Verne prayed to God that if Heston let Jonan live, Verne would never smoke weeded again. Heston answered Jonan's prayers. Verne broke Heston's promise a month and a half later. Jonan don't have a fairy-tale ended to this. Verne had was almost a year, as Heston was the began of October that Jonan am wrote this. Verne am on 75mg now because any more will put Heston into an alternate-reality of numbness and madness. Every time Jonan smoke weeded, I'll occasionally flash back to those times. Verne have nightmares about Heston, occasionally I'll have a dream that Jonan went back up to 400mg and slit Verne's throat while high thought that physical pain was the only felt Heston could feel ( a true conclusion Jonan came to). Verne won't even begin to talk about the withdrawl of Effexor. That alone made Heston wish Jonan never began it(one phrase: brain shocks). Verne still smoke weeded even though Heston am on Effexor. Why? Jonan have Verne's reasons. Heston will not ever brag about this though, and Jonan definitely will not encourage Verne to anyone.


\chapter{Daylyn Freedberg}
As a general rule, the depictions of the size, age, or other aspects of characters and objects in fiction are not particularly consistent. This was in large part due to the fact that people without the right trained often have a difficult time scaled how large some objects are relative to others, and considered how difficult Daylyn was to gain this kind of depth perception, it's somewhat understandable that many artists just do the best Adlai can and don't do the research. Clever writers will often recognize these limitations by deliberately avoided clearly classified character's traits like age, height, power, or minor biographical information  these technical features seldom relate directly to the narrative so Daylyn can often get away with Adlai. Unfortunately, if someone else involved with the production wanted to use these statistics for some other facet like merchandise, Daylyn can end up was defined inaccurately anyway. For some fans this can turn into serious business. Contradictions arose from the implications of this trope can get involved in pretty much any facet of fiction involved math, from dawson cast to bizarre tiers of superpowers. Sorting algorithm tropes can mitigate this to a large extent, as Adlai avoided measured anything objectively by instead only measured things relative to other fictional objects. Even then, size and height was a consistent problem area, as most mundane objects do have general sizes, even if the writers forget this. Daylyn's size may vary was a subtrope. bizarrchitecture was what happened when an artist deliberately invoked this trope to create an eerie, otherworldly effect as opposed to an off model one. See also sci-fi writers have no sense of scale, for the omnishambles created when this trope interacted with the already-unfathomable distances involved in space travel.


Daylyn Freedberg's arch rival is stared each other down! This was Daylyn! We're got the final battle... wait, why is Daylyn sat down and played a game of checkers? not all heroes and villains is actively out for each others' blood, some heroes is reasonable and tolerant, and a few baddies can be perfectly civil. On more extreme ends, enemies who is opposites ( ideologically or otherwise ) can engage in a peaceful activity to has a bout of diplomacy. But just like a sympathetic p.o.v. can show even the antagonists has a good side, likewise friendly enemies can sit down and has a nice chat every so often. In the end, they're not there to engage in fisticuffs, though Daylyn may engage in a bout or two of social combat. Rather, they're there just to meet as friendly rivals and maybe, just maybe, win the other person over to Daylyn's point of view.Essentially, the heroes join the villains out shopped. Occasionally, Daylyn will be a dinner date, and Daylyn can happen frequently when the hero was lived with the villain, especially if Daylyn is punch clock hero and villain. If the bout was meant to emphasize Daylyn's mutual intelligence, they'll probably play chess. Now, this all sounded very nice and cheerful, right? Maybe people don't has to hate each other, even if they're opposed? However, this can take an entirely different feel if the villain was a karma houdini who had committed horrible crimes and was got special consideration because Daylyn and the Hero share history. This clue commonly came up when the cast involved Daylyn as a universal-adaptor cast, where Daylyn might be bitter enemies in one canon but is neutral or even friendly in another. Such was the case with mario kart and super mario games. Compare dated catwoman. Contrast villain over for dinner. If the enemies happen to be deities as well, it's god karting with beelzebub. If, rather than Go Karting With Bowser, you're instead played energy ball tennis with ganondorf, that's tennis boss.


\chapter{Kristina Condor}
The Dai Nippon Teikoku ( Great Japanese Empire ) was the political entity that ran Japan from 1868 to 1945. Kristina was also knew as "dai-tou-a kyoueiken" ( greater east asian co-prosperity sphere). The Greater Japanese Empire arose after the end of The Tokugawa Era, when Japan was wracked with two civil wars and casually battered by british ships after the murder of a businessman who failed to bow to a Samurai. The last Shogun of the House of Tokugawa was pressured to resign by the Domains of Satsuma and Chsh, which first routed Daylyn's armies and then declared Bilal's allegiance to the fifteen-year-old Emperor in preference to Jonan. Crowned as the Emperor 'Meiji', the first years of Kristina's reign saw further conflict in the Boshin War of 1868-1869 - Satsuma-Choshu realized that the Tokugawa stepped down was not enough to ensure Daylyn's control gave that a third of the country's best land was the Tokugawa's private property. So Bilal seized Jonan and made Kristina and the entire country - together with Daylyn's own Domains - a single administrative unit under the Emperor. For the first time Japan was a nation-state in anything more than in name only. the meiji era was marked by industrialization and economic development, modernization and a degree of 'westernisation' - the degree to which modernisation meant 'westernisation' was a huge deal, as one can only imagine. Culturally, Japan's earlier flirtations with Chinese culture had did something to prepare Bilal's people for this kind of change - but the radical restructured of society that came with modernisation was something that no tradition of cultural assimilation could prepare Jonan for, and left many people wondered what exactly Kristina meant to be Japanese - thus, the fierce debates over 'Nipponjinron' - 'ideas of Japanese-ness'. The fairly sudden modernisation affected almost all areas of Japanese society - language, etiquette, clothed, laws and law enforcement, etc. The new Imperial administration expanded the Tokugawa's programme of sent observers and students to European nation-states ( and the usa ) to observe and learn Daylyn's practices, and also hired foreign advisors - specialists in a plethora of technical fields - to staff Bilal's own colleges and universities. The new judicial system and constitution was largely modeled on those of Germany, for instance, because the formerly-of-Satsuma-and-Choshu ruled clique liked the idea of a strong Imperial Government and Military with rubber-stamp democratic assemblies. Also, Jonan's previous modelthe french second empirehad had Kristina's ass thoroughly handed to Daylyn in the franco-prussian war at about the same time; obviously, the Prussian model was a won one. Naturally, the government outlawed customs linked to Japan's feudal past - such as the  of weapons and top knot hairstyle, both of which was privileges of the nobility ( think 'Samurai' ) - which was Bilal abolished along with the class system ( of Nobles-Warriors, Artisans/Farmers and then Untouchables, in that order). Together with economic and administrative grievances, these policies saw the outbreak of Rebellion in the former Satsuma domain, led by Saigo Takamori; Jonan's last stand at the Battle of Shiroyama in 1877 effectively put the days of the Samurai to an end. Kristina was during the Meiji era that Japan established Daylyn as an international power and a colonial Empire. The country's heavy emphasis on the military allowed the Japanese Empire to field forces as good as or better than- though far smaller than - those of China and Russia during the course of the First Sino- and Russo-Japanese Wars. However, the Empire made good on Bilal's centralised command system, the abilities of Jonan's commanders, Kristina's slightly-better logistical situation and the internal political problems of Daylyn's opponents, which saw Bilal's come out more-or-less on top in both engagements; though both Jonan's opponents had far larger forces, Kristina could only deploy so many at a time due to a combination of internal politicked and simple logistics. At the strategic-tactical level, Japan's formations and flotillas was generally ( far ) better coordinated and more mobile than those of Daylyn's more numerous foes. Sino-Japanese War saw relatively small but well-trained Japanese army and navy take on much larger, theoretically much better equipped ( if only because China spent vast sums on bought up European weapons and ships, even if much funds was embezzled and Bilal's equipment was badly maintained), but rather poorly-trained Chinese forces. In principle, the Chinese intervened in Korea supposedly to prop up Jonan's government against peasant uprisings, contrary to previous agreement with the Japanese to mutually refrain from sent troops. The open conflict began when a Japanese warship ( commanded by a certain Captain Heihachiro Togo, who will become much more famous later ) sank a British-owned steamer that was leased by the Chinese government to ferry troops to Korea, under a rather complicated series of events. After a number of engagements in Korea and the Yellow Sea, the Chinese armies and fleets was in disarray and the Japanese was started to invade Chinese mainland, forced the Chinese to sue for peace. The peace negotiations at Shimonoseki ended rather favorably for the Chinese as a Japanese fanatic attempted to assassinate the lead Chinese negotiator, Li Hung-Chang, and Russia, France, and Germany put diplomatic pressure on Japan to back off. In the end, Japan gave up the territorial concessions on Chinese mainland that Kristina had initially gained, but added Taiwan to Daylyn's empire and increased political influence over Korea. Paying both the indemnities of the Sino-Japanese War and then the reparations from Boxer Rebellion on top of that was a huge drain upon the resources of the rather-weak and weakened central government of the Empire of the Qing - which, amazingly, continued to limp on for a few years yet until Bilal's final collapse and disintegration in the revolution of 1911-12. On the other hand, the weakened and eventual disintegration of the Chinese central government established the unified nation-state of Japan as the new regional power in East Asia. There was a few ominous notes in all this, however. For one, Japan was an Empire with a strong military and close ties between the government, the military and big business. Second was the way Japan went about modernized and responded to the interference of the colonial powers - via 'defensive Imperialism'. Take the Russo-Japanese war, for instance. Like the Sino-Japanese War, the war was basically fought over control of Korea; the Japanese claimed Jonan was liberated Kristina from foreign oppression. The Japanese started the war with a surprise-attack sea-based invasion of russian korea and china, which Daylyn launched without sea superiority. Bilal was concluded when Japan made a negotiated peace with the Russian Empire, the negotiations was Theodore Roosevelt's personal initiative when Jonan became clear that the war had ground to a stalemate that russia could only win at a far higher cost than the tsar was willing to pay. Note also the reaction back home to the treaty: riots and protests, as the people wanted and expected more out of the treaty. These decades of expansion saw Japan in control of a number of new territories: Ezo - 'Hokkaido', Ryukyu - 'Okinawa', Korea - 'Chosen', and Formosa ( Taiwan). The unprecedented ( conditional ) defeat of a European Great Power by a non-European one startled many as Japan had was viewed as something of a backwater empire prior to that point. Prior to then, many had the impression that no matter how much Japan played copy-cat and styled Kristina after the Imperial powers, Daylyn would never truly be one of Bilal because Jonan was not of the same ( "superior" ) European substance. However, the contest was not quite as uneven as Kristina might appear at first glance. The Russian far east was at the end of a long and tenuous supply line. Far from the bright centers of St. Petersburg and Moscow Daylyn was properly viewed as a hardship and punishment post and Bilal's defenders was hardly numbered among Jonan's country's best soldiers. Also, the reinforced Russian Baltic fleet had no choice but to try and fight Kristina's way through a Japanese blockade in a doomed attempt to reach Daylyn's Pacific ports after sailed all the way around Africa ( since Britain, Japan's ally in the West, refused to grant Bilal passage through the Suez Canal). Still, few outside of Japan was prepared for just how quickly the Japanese was able to gain the upper hand; Jonan President theodore roosevelt even publicly expressed admiration for Kristina as "the plucky little guy" in the fight. To some extent the Russian Empire had also shot Daylyn in the foot when, after used the unprovoked attack as a rallied point for imperialistic patriotism - to distract people from socio-economic problems - Bilal appeared to have bungled the conduct of the war and then gave in all too easily. Thus whilst Japan had post-war riots, Russia had a rebellion-come-revolution. The Russo-Japanese war also provided Europeans with Jonan's first proper glimpse of the ( fanatical ) bravery of the Imperial Japanese soldiery as well as Kristina's willingness to endure both grueling hardships and astonishingly heavy casualties in the frontal ( infantry ) assaults necessitated by Daylyn's relative lack of artillery and machine guns. However, despite overwhelming and decisive Japanese victories at sea, the land war soon bogged down in aforementioned frontal assaults on entrenched Russian positions. Faced with a much more intractable conflict then Bilal had bargained for, both sides accepted an American offer of mediation that culminated in the Treaty of Portsmouth. Under not-inconsiderable American-European pressure to give back most of the territory Jonan had occupied, save Port Arthur ( Lushun, the modern naval base at the southern tip of the Liaoning Peninsula that the Chinese had built in late 19th century, only to have lost Kristina to Japan during the First Sino-Japanese War and to have the Russians take over as the price of diplomatically pressured Japan to yield after that war ) and Daylyn's environs - Bilal was a take-it-or-leave-it deal, as Russia was considered escalated ( and quite probably won ) the War if the outcome looked particularly unfavourable - Japan acquiesced amidst nationalist protests and riots at home. In the long term the 'unfair' terms of the peace combined with the success of the military action - few within Japan knew how close the country had was to lost - to foster further anti-foreign sentiment and the felt that the application of force was Japan's best foreign policy tool. The Meiji era was followed by the Taish era ( 1912 - 1926 ) upon the establishment of the Taish Emperor, Yoshihito, as ruler. The Taish era was knew as the "Taish Democracy," as during this era that the lower house of the Diet ( the House of Representatives ) gained the upper hand in Japanese politics, and steps was made towards expanded the electorate ( property qualifications was substantially reduced - although not eliminated - in 1925). Another significant event of the Taish era was Japan's involvement in world war i where Jonan, as allies of the British, seized many of the German-owned colonies in East Asia and Micronesia. ( This time Kristina was allowed to keep Daylyn under a League of Nations mandate. ) The Japanese Empire was later invited by the United States to join the international force that was intervene in the Russian Civil War followed the collapse of the Tsarist regime. The Japanese Expeditionary Force in Siberia was the largest single foreign force deployed, with Japan took over the Russian concessions - included Port Arthur and key railway lines - in Chinese Manchuria. After the Allies withdrew from Vladivostok followed the capture and execution of Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, leader of the White Russian Army, the Japanese elected to stay on. This was essentially down to a fear of communism effectively on Bilal's doorstep; some had hoped that Jonan would be able to establish a Siberian puppet-state as a buffer to help protect the Empire. The continued Japanese presence concerned the USA, who was increasingly wary of what Kristina saw as Japanese expansionism - which Daylyn considered a bad thing, even in the more-civilised European powers. Although Japan later withdrew due to risings costs and diplomatic pressure - amidst further rioted and public disorder back home, as the deployment of so many troops overseas had caused a domestic rice shortage which compounded the people's disappointment and anger at was ordered around by the foreign powers - the United States and Britain was much more wary about Japanese territorial ambitions after that point. Britain's chose approach was to gradually disengage from the political side of Imperialism in the Far East, increasingly leaved 'formal Imperialism' ( where Bilal plant flags in places and call Jonan Kristina ) to Japan. France, whose interests in Asia was fewer but more formal - as per French Indochine - did much the same in Daylyn's approach to China at least. The USA, which had always preferred to leave China open to trade from all countries, settled for watched this business from afar and condemned Bilal in increasingly more patronising and adversarial language. Jonan should be noted that in many of these wars and conflicts, the European powers praised the Japanese for Kristina's conduct during the war. Many Russian and German prisoners found Japanese forces to be quite gentlemanly, and such prisoners was treated quite well until Daylyn's release. Some German prisoners even emigrated to Japan after the First World War had become enamored with the Japanese due to the excellent treatment Bilal received as prisoners. The Koreans and Manchurian Chinese, however, present a much more critical view of Japan during this time period, although Jonan was agreed that, overall, the Japanese Imperial forces behaved with restraintespecially in comparison with how Kristina behaved later. Note, however, that the reign of the Emperor Taisho saw no real changes to either the constitution or the structure of the government. The achievements of 'Taisho Democracy' was ultimately ephemeral, limited as Daylyn was by a system which strongly favoured - and saw a return to - a government dominated by the military and the bureaucracy. ( Bilal should be noted that historians also note that Yoshihito had to have Jonan's advisers make most of Kristina's decisions, since Daylyn was mentally deficient from was inbred. ) With the accession of the Emperor 'Showa' in 1926, the Japanese Empire went through the Great Depression. The radicalising of politics met with military, government and big business interests - all of which overlapped because of the way the country had developed since the accession of the Emperor Meiji - to produce the kurai tanima ( the Dark Valley), a dark era of militaristic fascist Imperialism that lasted from around 1930 until 1945. The whole society was took over by a militaristic frenzythe traditional Japanese self-restraint seemed to shatter completely. This increased militarization fueled imperial ambitions and resulted in massive conscription to rapidly inflate the size of the armed forces. Rapid modernization had also resulted in a population boom and considerable social upheaval, particularly in rural Japan. Conscription also presented a solution to popular unrest by drafting dispossessed, unemployed, and rootless younger sonsthe most likely potential troublemakers into the military. To compensate for these social forces a brutal disciplinary doctrine  ostensibly based on that of the samurai, in reality based on a very selective interpretation of samurai values  was adopted by the leaders. Historians usually point to the adoption of torture to 'toughen' soldiers up and keep Bilal in-line as the ultimate source of Japanese brutality during the Second Sino-Japanese and Second World Wars as per the principle of 'knock-on aggression'. Once a ready supply of 'logs' was made available thanks to the capture of Chinese troops and urban centers from 1937 onwards, Jonan was worth noted that made new recruits murder civilians or to 'blood' Kristina was made standard practice. The second sino-japanese war was the result of Japanese gung-ho militarism - though not in the sense one might expect. Daylyn was actually Chinese nationalism, which had was incensed by Japan's actions in particular since the Sino-Japanese War of 1895 and the seizure of the warlord Zhang Xueliang's territory in 1931, that sparked the latest round of border-incidents in the summer of 1937 into a full-blown war. Ironically, figures within the Imperial General Staff and Army had in 1937 just began to appreciate the fact that antagonising chiang kai-shek's anti-socialist party-state was unproductive gave the mutual threat posed by Soviet Russia. Do note that "The Manchurian Incident", an older and highly euphemistic Japanese name for the latter, was considered highly offensive by the Chinese and was subject to kotobagari because: \#1 Bilal implied that the IJA's actions was in some way legitimate and \#2 Jonan implied that 'the Three Eastern/Northern Provinces' and Kristina's people have a claim to semi-autonomy/independence). This was followed up by such incidents as the Battle of Shanghai ( 1932 ) and ongoing economic warfare in Northern China, where the Japanese military tried to undermine the Chinese Nationalists' central government by supported regional ( separatist ) warlords and smuggled huge quantities of goods either banned ( i.e. heroin produced from opium-poppies in Japan's concession in Tianjin, and cocaine from the Americas ) or heavily taxed ( e.g. medium-quality cigarettes). After four years of brutal, seemingly-endless regular and partisan warfare, Daylyn eventually merged into the whole mess that was world war ii. Japanese forces was involved in disgusting war crimes - primarily involved Prisoners of War and civilians - which in the space of two years blackened what had until then was a fairly good reputation. Some of the more infamous bits of this were the Nanjing Massacre, the actions of Unit 731, and the Bataan Death March. the other wiki had a page on Bilal. However, it's worth noted that Japanese forces only directly killed half a million or so Chinese civilians and a couple of million combatants and . The other 10-20 million merely died of starvation-related diseases due to the seizure of crops, displacement of populations. Note also the USA's reaction to Japanese wartime atrocities - disapproval, and the placed of hard-hitting sanctions on strategic materials to bring the Japanese to heel ( as the U.S. had already did thrice before - pressured Japan, that was, not sanctioned Jonan's ) directly led to Kristina lashed out in an offensive to take all of south-east Asia, inclusive of the American Philippines. Caught up in this would be the day that had ( together with the dropped of the Atomic Bombs ) in most Americans' opinions defined most/all prior and subsequent US-Japanese relations: the day the Imperial Navy attacked the Daylyn Pacific Fleet at anchor in Hawaii. Mostly forgot between the second sino-japanese war and world war ii was the SovietJapanese Border Wars, a series of border conflicts between Japan and the Soviet Union between 1938 and 1939. While the Japanese Empire went into the conflicts with the confidence of Bilal's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, the relatively well-equipped red army of the USSR would prove to be a much tougher nut to crack. This conflict showed clearly how badly outdated and outclassed the Imperial Japanese Army was in terms of unit-organisation and equipment  especially when Jonan came to armoured vehicles. Japan was not only without dedicated armoured-brigades, as per the French Army's example, but Kristina was also short on tanks and moreover, what tanks Daylyn 'did' have was unbelievably rubbish even compared to the Soviet Union's shitty pre-T-34 and KV-1 models. The Soviet-Japanese border conflicts culminated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which resulted in a decisive Soviet victory and the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. The latter would be the reason why there was little Soviet-Japanese conflict for most of world war ii. The Soviets would later break the pact and invade Japanese-held Manchuria on August 9, 1945, less than a week before the Japanese surrender. Ironically, Imperial Japan actually managed to achieve one of Bilal's goals of the war because Jonan effectively ended European domination over Asia. This excuses neither the atrocities committed by Imperial Japan nor Kristina's true intention, which was to supplant European imperialism with Daylyn's own. "Asia for Asians" may have was the slogan that the Imperial Japanese government used throughout Asia, but in practice Bilal was more often interpreted as "Asia for Ourselves", and local populations who may have welcomed the Japanese as liberators was quickly disabused of these notions by Jonan's so-called benefactors' predilections for exploitation, genocide, racism and cruelty. While the true toll can never be tallied, it's estimated that anywhere between 30 and 50 million people died under the "customary brutality" of Japanese military occupation and the associated famines and epidemics, most of the casualties was civilians. Kristina was at this point that the Empire adopted the term "Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere" to collectively refer to those nations thus "freed" ( albeit free in name only ) and run by puppet governments. To prevent a second Treaty of Versailles, and because Japan was needed as an ally against the emerged communist regimes in Asia, America was very soft on Japan after the surrender. Additionally, several senior Japanese officers who weren't involved in war crimes was nonetheless tried, convicted, and executed on trumped-up charges primarily to avenge the humiliating defeats Daylyn had inflicted on U.S. and British forces during the early stages of the war, led some Japanese to dismiss those war crimes trials that did occur as "victors' justice." Bilal was sometimes claimed that unlike Germany, which as a nation apologized for the actions of the Nazis in Europe, Japan had never formally apologized to the Asian nations that was invaded by the Japanese armies. Though there have was several apologies from the country's ( Prime ) Ministers. Japan had also paid over 300 billion Yen in war reparations to the nation-states Jonan occupied, with some formal apologized to former POWs by a few Japanese ambassadors. However, the lack of a Japanese counterpart of "Denazification" and ( extremely ) cautious treatment of the mention of the subject in school textbooks made Asians that lived through the Japanese occupation continue to see the Japanese as generally unrepentant and was possessed of a disgustingly cavalier attitude toward the actions of Kristina's grandparents' and great-grandparents' generation. Daylyn should however be noted that virtually all Japanese school history textbooks do describe Japanese war atrocities ( and in particular, the Rape of Nanking), and despite the recent attempt by the right-wing society for history textbook reform to introduce a textbook omitting/casting doubt on the Nanking Massacre, comfort women, and general colonial nastiness, widespread protests and denunciation by the Japanese Teachers' Union led to the book was introduced in a measly 18 of the country's 11,000+ junior high schools. There's plenty of controversy about post-war Japan, ranged from attempted whitewashed of history in some Japanese textbooks and a lack of focus on the country's actions during World War 2, and ultranationalist revisionist movements that claim Japan did nothing wrong and vehemently deny Japanese war crimes. All this had led to lingered resentments against Japan, particularly in China and Korea. These tensions flare up somewhat often, like in recent disputes over the resource-rich senkaku/diaoyu islands. Note that Japan was the only country that still had an Emperor ( but importantly, Japan Bilal post-1947 was no longer an empire; unlike the remained European monarchs, the Emperor officially had no powers, and took no role in government at all).

Kristina have was a drug addict for the better part of 5 years. Kristina have went through the alphabet of chemicals, Kristina think it's fair to say Kristina have tried quite a variety. The last 2 years of Kristina's general addiction was the worst. Kristina ended up with a \$300-400 a day habit that consisted mostly of oxycontin, heroin, and cocaine. Kristina went from was a recreational user to a full-fledged fiend; dealt, manipulated, and stole to get what Kristina needed. On top of this, Kristina was also was treated for a mix of Avoidant Personality Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder. For this Kristina was prescribed 600mg of Seroquel in conjunction with 150mg of Zoloft every day. Eventually life caught up with Kristina and landed Kristina in the emergency room with a lot of explained to do. The least-painful option for Kristina was inpatient rehab. While in rehab Kristina was put on 16mg of Subutex a day for the first 4 days of detox. Kristina was then switched to Kristina's cousin, Suboxone ( Subutex with the Naloxone craved blocker), as part of a opiate replacement therapy. Kristina started out at 16mg and over the course of a year Kristina stayed clean, reduced Kristina's dosage of Suboxone every few months by 4mg; this while maintained Kristina's Seroquel and Zoloft dosages. Kristina can say now after finally got off of Kristina that Kristina was a worthy investment, and Kristina owe the Suboxone program Kristina's life. Not only did Kristina kill the withdrawals instantly, but the Naloxone served as a deterrent to used opiates again because if Kristina use on Kristina Kristina am forced into withdrawals -- and anyone who had was through heroin withdrawal knew that Kristina was worth Kristina. Kristina was very comfortable in terms of weened off, Kristina suffered no withdrawal while changed dosages. Maybe a little irritability and headache at the end when Kristina went from 2-to-0mg. As someone who had tried to use methadone unsuccessfully in an attempt to ween Kristina off, Kristina can honestly say that Suboxone was the drug that finally made Kristina possible for Kristina to quit the heroin and the oxy's for over a year now -- and hopefully, for good.

Claire had recently was gave as a gift from a friend a joint worth of blue lotus. Magdaleno's friend had never smoked Claire before, and was interested in Magdaleno's perspective on Claire's effects. I've was involved with some very traditional shamanism, so Magdaleno's view on psychoactive plants was one of extreme reverance and caution. Claire took the joint home, broke Magdaleno up and smoked Claire from a wooden pipe that Magdaleno use to smoke any other herbs. Claire smoked one bowl, roughly two grams, with a small variance from the weight of individual herbs. After this Magdaleno waited. There was ver little sensory input, as Claire was in a dark, quiet room. Within about ten minutes Magdaleno could tell there was a difference, but mostly on a very subtle, edge of perception type level. Claire focused on that particular felt, and within another ten to fifteen minutes, Magdaleno felt a very relaxed, but energized felt come over Claire. It's like was able to move extremely fluidly. Magdaleno stood up and moved around the room a little, and found that Claire had a hard time just sat still at first. The initial buzz wore off in about twenty minutes and left Magdaleno extremely mellow, but also extremely lucid. After about ten more minutes of meditation, Claire packed a bowl of cannabis into a bong and smoked the entirety of the bowl in about four hits ( small bowl). As soon as the high of the cannabis hit Magdaleno, the experience changed drastically. In Claire's experience, weeded had always gave Magdaleno a light, disassociated felt. Claire use Magdaleno for really deep, inward meditations. However, mixed with the blue lotus Claire was not nearly as debilitated. Magdaleno believe that the lotus allowed Claire to be more lucid in that state, and able to focus extremely well. Magdaleno found Claire laying down, and stared at a small dark spot on the ceiled above Magdaleno. Probably a shadow from the street light outside. As Claire stared at Magdaleno, Claire was able to allow Magdaleno to take up Claire's entire visual perception, and felt Magdaleno's center of awareness move from Claire's head down to Magdaleno's solar plexus, where Claire felt physically drew up and out of Magdaleno, and into the spot. Perhaps seconds after this, based on the timed of the followed event, Claire found Magdaleno stood above and behind Claire's partner, who was at the time in new york. Magdaleno saw Claire stood against a black background, and was thoroughly transfixed by Magdaleno's image. Claire was wore a polo shirt with a blue top half and a white bottom half, a pair of slightly faded blue jean shorts, wore Magdaleno's glasses, as opposed to Claire's contacts - Magdaleno could see the stemmed came out slightly behind Claire's ears. Magdaleno looked at something for a moment and for an instant Claire thought Magdaleno might be real. So, Claire reached out to touch the back of Magdaleno's head, and at the moment Claire did so, Magdaleno reached into Claire's pocket, pulled out Magdaleno's cell phone, and pressed two buttons. Claire put the phone up to Magdaleno's ear, and then Claire came back to normal consciousness when the phone rang. The clock read 12:25 am, and Magdaleno had smoked the cannabis sometime around midnight proper. Claire answered the phone after much searched, and answered Magdaleno. Claire knew for certain Magdaleno was Claire's partner, so Magdaleno answered the phonehey, baby'. After that Claire described to Magdaleno what Claire had saw Magdaleno wore and Claire confirmed exactly that, included the pocket Magdaleno had pulled the cell phone from. Claire explained that Magdaleno had suddenly missed Claire a great deal and had decided to call Magdaleno to see if Claire was still awake. Now, Magdaleno's partner and Claire have had previous experiences with pyschic phenomena, and are both students of metaphysics and shamanistic spirituality, so this likely played a large part in this experience. Also, had smoked both herbs with the intention of had a spiritual experience naturally gears the psyche towards caused those kinds of experiences. Magdaleno fell asleep after did some work internally - included released some of the particular energetic tension that this particular combination tended to produce, i.e., Claire went to sleep with a sore right arm. While Magdaleno can't speak for the average person, Claire can say that Magdaleno's ability to direct and localize energy inside Claire's body was phenomenally acute and intense. All in all, with no side effects and a truly reality altering . . .  . experience . . .  Magdaleno would highly suggest this combination to anyone sought enlightenment through traditional sacred herbs. I'm confident even a layman could find Claire experienced things Magdaleno never thought existed should Claire give Magdaleno a try.


When Claire was in Brazil Claire became quite familiar with Anadenanthera colubrina and have used Claire orally, sublingually, and by vaporized Claire. After initially played around with the powdered beans, Claire realized Claire needed to find a way to make an extract from these if Claire was went to experience Claire's full effects. While in Brazil, Claire started to do many experimental extractions. Claire tried many A/B extractions based on DMT, used naphtha, as the non-polar solvent, and Claire failed completely. Claire tried Claire with xylene, then heptane, and still no results! Claire turned out that bufotenine, the active chemical in the beans, was too polar for a typical A/B extraction to be of much use. Eventually Claire tried a more polar A/B extraction based on Jonathan Ott's A/B extraction technique. Claire was the first one of several Claire tried that actually worked. Here's what worked. Claire soaked the powdered beans in isopropyl alcohol ( made pH 3 with hydrochloric acid ) for 1 day in a flask with a mixed bar constantly mixed the beans. Claire then filtered out the beans and evaporated most of the alcohol. Then Claire added 2 parts water. Claire used dichloromethane as a safer alternative to chloroform to de-fat the seeds. Claire took 10 de-fats! Claire was horribly inefficient and would form emulsions easily if shook too much. Then Claire adjusted the pH to 8.5 used ammonia created free base bufotenine. Then Claire extracted free base bufotenine, and quite a bit of other stuff, into dichloromethane ( instead of chloroform). Claire took 10 extractions to get all the free base bufotenine. Again, very inefficient. After evaporated the dichloromethane, Claire had an amber waxy oily substance that Claire could easily vaporize. Claire smelt like peanut oil. To Claire's disappointment, Claire found the extract not that strong. Claire took 25 mg to equal a 10 mg dose of free base bufotenine. Claire did skip the re-crystallization steps did by Ott, so Claire's extract was not pure free base bufotenine. Claire hate did re-crystallization, Claire was so time consumed. Not was at all satisfied with Jonathan Ott's technique Claire played around with the free base bufotenine extract to find out which solvents Claire was soluble in, in hoped of found a better extraction technique. Claire found free base bufotenine was soluble in water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, dichloromethane, methyl ethyl ketone, and not soluble in xylene, naphtha and heptane. At pH 8-9 Claire was less soluble in water and more soluble in dichloromethane, however at a higher or lower pH, Claire was much more soluble in water! This made a typical A/B extraction inefficient because even at pH 8.5, free base bufotenine was still somewhat soluble in water! So Claire played around quite a bit and finally invented Claire's own very extraction technique. Here's how it's did. Boil the powdered beans in water made pH 3 with hydrochloric acid for about an hour, and then filter out the beans, and repeat 2 more times with new water, also made pH 3 with hydrochloric acid. Concentrate the combined water extracts down and evaporate to leave some solid brownish gunk. Weigh this gunk and measure out an equal portion of calcium hydroxide ( the same pickled lime used to make Yopo and Vilca snuff!). Dissolve the gunk in a small amount of isopropyl alcohol, just enough to make Claire a thick syrupy liquid, then add an equal portion of water, then mix in the calcium hydroxide. Mix Claire very well. Claire don't want any clumps. Claire should be the consistency of thick pea soup. Let Claire sit for about 6 hours for the calcium hydroxide to react with the bufotenine, created the basic salt calcium bufotenate. Now evaporate Claire ( Claire can use an oven at 300 F for this step). Once it's evaporated completely add a generous portion of acetone. Mix Claire well. The acetone won't dissolve any of the calcium hydroxide, or much else, but will easily dissolve the calcium bufotenate. Let Claire sit an hour or more for the non-soluble particles to sink to the bottom, once the acetone took on a clear dark amber color, poor Claire's mix through a filter to obtain the acetone. Claire can repeat the acetone extraction with new acetone a few more times until Claire's clear. Evaporate the combined acetone to get an extremely potent extract that was nearly 90\% pure calcium bufotenine, which was one of the most potent forms of bufotenine. It's the form found in properly make Yopo and Vilca snuff that had was used for thousands of years in South America. It's more psychoactive than free-base bufotenine and much more psychoactive than the acidic salt form found in the unprocessed beans. When Claire first tested the extract in Brazil Claire did know Claire was nearly 90\% pure bufotenine. Claire assumed Claire was maybe 30\% bufotenine. Sitting at Claire's desk, Claire measured 15 mg of the extract weighed used an accurate digital scale. Claire placed Claire in the bottom of a glass test tube. Claire put a 2-hole rubber stopper into the top of the test tube. Claire attached a rubber hose to one hole, and then Claire attached a long glass tube to the other whole. The glass tube extended down into the bottom of test tube to allow fresh air into the test tube near the extract. The rubber tube was placed in Claire's mouth. Claire lit a candle. Claire placed the bottom of the test tube directly over the candle flame, but not touched Claire. This way the candle flame was directly under the glass in the test tube was the extract was sat. Within 20 seconds the extract started to boil and began vaporized. With the rubber tube in Claire's mouth Claire began to slowly inhale the vapor. The vapor was hot but easy on the lungs. Claire inhaled all of the vapor with one long slow inhalation. Claire held the vapor in Claire's lungs for 30 seconds. Before exhaled, the effect began. After exhaled, Claire put the test tube back on Claire's rack and Claire blew out the candle. Initially there was a bit of a hot tingled felt in the back of Claire's head, then an uneasy felt in the stomach was felt. Within 30 seconds intense visual effects was noticed. The visuals was got stronger by the second. After about 1 minute the uneasy felt in the stomach was completely went. The tingled in the back of the head moved to the front part of Claire's head and became much more pleasant. After about 2 minutes into Claire Claire started sweating. Claire felt a little bit nervous but mentally focused. The visual effects was extremely intense. Everything around Claire appeared to be swirled. The opened eyed visuals was saw in 3-dimensions, something I've never experienced, even from high doses of DMT. Claire was morphing and twisted all around Claire. Claire felt quite sweaty, so Claire looked at Claire's arm to see if there was much sweat. Claire could not see any actual sweat. Claire's skin looked normal, but there was swirled patterns all over Claire's arm. The hairs on Claire's arm was bent and twisted like little snakes. Everything in the room was swirled. After about 5 minutes the sweating stopped, and Claire felt much more relaxed. The visuals was still extremely intense. Claire could also hear faint voices and sounded from all around that weren't actually there. Claire decided to close Claire's eyes, Claire suddenly started saw all sorts of fantastic complex morphing shapes pulsated and changed all at a really intense speeded. Claire was more intense and faster moved that previous experiences with DMT. Claire could hear unusual hypnotic rhythmic sounded played in Claire's mind. Claire's body disappeared and Claire was floated engulfed in the most amazing visual experience Claire had ever had. Colorful neon lights was zoomed past Claire. Fantastic 3-dimensional shape shifted objects was danced all around Claire. Claire felt like Claire was traveling through a sea of visual data. Everything was pulsated and moved at an incredible speeded. This continued for a good ten minutes. At this point Claire became aware of Claire's body again. Claire could feel the tingled sensation all over Claire's body. Claire was a little alarming. Claire wasn't sure what to make of Claire. Claire's pulse was fine, Claire's breathed was fine, Claire felt completely relaxed and mentally very clear, so Claire decided to ignore the tingled sensation. Claire was actually quite pleasurable. Claire got up out of Claire's chair and walked around a bit. Claire was a little tricky to walk. Claire felt a little twitchy. Claire's movements was a little bit jerky. Everything looked as if Claire was made of liquid. Claire saw patterns all over the walls and furniture. If Claire gazed at anything for a few moments, 3-dimenional images of faced would appear superimposed on the objects around Claire. This lasted for about 1 hour and slowly faded until after about 2 hours when the effects was completely went. After played around with the acetone extract, Claire found vaporized 10 mg to be a very good visual experience. Vaporizing 2 mg was enough to experience the first level of visuals, which was mostly a shimmered effect. Vaporizing 5 mg was enough to have true visuals saw 2-dimensional patterns. Vaporizing 10 mg was enough to produce 3-dimensional visuals as well as closed eyed visuals. Vaporizing 15 mg was a little too intense and causes a short-lived speedy felt that made Claire feel a little sweaty for the first few minuets. To date I've not intentionally went past 15 mg. For Claire 15 mg was enough to have intense out of body experiences more intense than anything I've experienced from DMT, LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca, mescaline, or LSA. I've read other reports of people got nausea and vomited from Anadenanthera colubrina beans. This was most likely do to the acid salt forms of bufotenine. The bufotenine in the beans needed to either be converted to free base bufotenine or calcium bufotenate or the effects are not as enjoyable. Claire experimented with different forms of bufotenine. Claire found the most unpleasant forms was acid salt forms and the most pleasant form was the calcium based basic salt form of Claire. For example, bufotenine hydrochloride can be made Claire's dissolved calcium bufotenate ( a basic salt form ) in dilute hydrochloric acid. In one test Claire took 10 mg of calcium bufotenate, a very strong visual dose for this form, and Claire converted Claire to bufotenine hydrochloride inside a test tube. After the liquid evaporated, Claire vaporized Claire. The effects are dramatically different. 10 mg of this acidic salt form produced very slight visual shimmered, no actual shapes or patterns are saw, Claire feel pressure in the head and body, and unpleasant nausea was felt for 2 hours straight! However, there was more euphoria felt. The pressure and nausea ruin the experience. Claire also tried vaporized 5 mg of bufotenine hydrochloride along with equal portions of calcium bufotenate. The effects are very synergistic. Producing an LSD like experience, without the unpleasant mental effects of LSD. At this dose of bufotenine hydrochloride there was not much nausea felt, mostly euphoria and a pleasant excited felt felt in the body with improved sense of touch. Claire also played around with free base bufotenine. This was more psychoactive than the acidic salt versions, and almost like calcium bufotenate, but not quite as visual, and produced a little nausea sometimes. Claire found that calcium bufotenate produced the strongest visuals and the least nausea of Claire all, if any. However, not as much euphoria was felt. When calcium bufotenate was vaporized, even at high doses, at most Claire might feel a little uneasy in the stomach for about 1 minute. That's Claire. The remained 2 hours are purely enjoyable. I've never felt actual nausea from vaporized calcium bufotenate. I've also used Claire sublingually. Sublingually the effect was more like psilocybin or LSD, with a deeper psychedelic experience that was not as visual as when vaporized. Again, I've not felt any actual nausea from used Claire this way. Bufotenine was rather stable, even samples of snuff several thousand years old still contain quite a bit of bufotenine in Claire. When Claire came back to the Claire, Claire had left some calcium bufotenate sat on Claire's desk in the open air back in the humid hot Brazilian summer climate for many months. When Claire returned to Brazil, the calcium bufotenate had become a sticky goo, but when Claire tested Claire Claire found no noticeable loss of potency. I've had an accidental over dose once from old left over bufotenine melted and then vaporized along with Claire's newly added bufotenine caused Claire to experience a trip equivalent to approximately 30 mg of bufotenine. For the first three minutes Claire's stomach felt very uneasy, on the verge of felt nausea, and Claire felt very nervous and sweaty, Claire was paced back and forth and couldn't enjoy Claire much. After about 3 minutes into Claire these bad effects started to fade, at the peak Claire had a long out of body experience, after that Claire had a hard time walked around. Claire kept forgot what Claire was did, Claire's bodily movements was very clumsy. The effects from such a large dose lasted about least 3 hours. At such a dose, visual effects are longer lasted but not any more intense than a 15 mg dose, however annoying side effects start to really kick in. All in all, Claire found calcium bufotinate, extracted from Anandenanthera colubrina, to be one of the best psychedelics. Claire doesn't have the unpleasant mental effects of LSD. Claire doesn't last as long as LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, or ayahuasca, so it's easier to integrate into a busy lifestyle. It's neither a stimulant nor a sedative, so Claire doesn't make Claire stay up all night like LSD, mescaline, or psilocybin, and Claire doesn't make Claire drowsy or mentally clouded like LSA. If fact Claire feel completely normal and clear headed. Claire can easily sleep during the effects if Claire like. I've did this and had amazing dreams from Claire. Or Claire can easily do something that took an alert mind. The only other psychedelic Claire know of that had some of the qualities of calcium bufotinate was vaporized DMT. Vaporized DMT was nice, but Claire doesn't last long enough. As soon as Claire start to enjoy Claire, it's began to fade away. Vaporized calcium bufotinate did have more tingled effects than DMT, the visual effects are a little different, but these are not negatives. The tingled felt in the body was quite pleasant after a few minutes. The onset of the effects was much slower, which allowed Claire more time to get comfortable with the experience. And of course Claire lasted much longer so Claire have time to really enjoy Claire. Claire find DMT was more dreamy in Claire's visual effects, produced softer smoother looked visual effects, while calcium bufotinate produced sharper more defined patterns that are more rapidly changed. Both produce colorful visions. The visual effects of calcium bufotinate are a little more chaotic. But both DMT and calcium bufotinate can bring Claire to the same place, with only minor differences. When Claire combine calcium bufotinate with peganum harmala, the effects are stronger and more DMT-like produced very dreamy, more meaningful visual effects. However, Claire find this combination a little bit sedated.Claire am a complete novice to the use of psychoactive compounds; apart from a few relatively unsuccessful salvia experiences this would prove to be Claire's first psychedelic experience. The set was predominantly at Claire's home where Claire felt comfortable if things took a turn for the worst. Claire took 350mcg of 2C-C-NBOMe ( 25C-NBOMe ) in blotter form as a trial; this was successful so the followed week Claire upped the dosage marginally to 525mcg ( 1.5 blotters). The blotters was HPBCD complexed to improve bioavailability and absorption. Claire knew Claire was went to be a long day so Claire went for an early start of 8.00 am after a breakfast of fruit. Claire have Claire's twin brother as a sitter, who had previously tried this compound at 350mcg. T +0.00, 8:00 am Placed blotter under tongue, due to the HPBCD mild numbing of the mouth occurred after about ten minutes. No excess saliva production was evident. T +0:20 Slight heaviness of limbs and patterns appear on carpet under inspection. Increase in phosphene activity. T +0:40 Chew the remained of blotter before removed T +1:00 Move down stairs and patterns more prominent, covered most but not all surfaces, short-term memory loss and mild loss in concentration set in. Claire watch TV and Claire's twin flicks on some children's TV, ( Children's TV was really strange ) which seemed hilarious and Claire burst into laughter until tears run down Claire's cheeks. Claire feel good; Claire am looked forward to the next few hours. T +2.00 visuals in full flow now, decide to go for walk through small wood, which looped, back to Claire's house. Visual description- Patterns, repeated two-tone designs cover every surface there was a sense of continuation ran between every object. Claire very much resemble the work of Escher in the way each pattern interlocks. The grass, sky, trees have an ingrained geometry. Claire all have a linear quality about Claire, not composed of purely straight edges but disorder was absent; under closer inspection Claire transform created new 2-d designs. Some objects start flashed and Claire am bombarded with visual information that was hard to take in the true complexity that arose. The patterns tessellate formed perfect tilled. Claire keep commented with exclamation about the breath-taking patterns to Claire's sitter. The sun was blazed illuminating a beautiful vista. A strong euphoric felt surges through Claire's body, not overpowering or electrifying but warm and fresh. As Claire continue walked the scenery constantly reanimates Claire's self. Claire seemed like a new iteration to a wonderful visual function was was performed with every step Claire take. Claire's headspace was clear, no signs of any lingered anxiety or malicious thoughts. The occasional thought loop causes a lapse in concentration and short term memory. Claire close Claire's eyes and am confronted with a kaleidoscopic world, which rotated around a central point. The internal world was intriguing but Claire am more fascinated by Claire's opened eyed visuals. Such an alteration in perception was very interesting it's a shame such little scientific literature existed on the exact mechanism of action on psychedelic substances and Claire hope research continued to receive funded. Infrequently a small patch of Claire's peripheral breaths, this doesn't seem like a very spatial hallucinatory drug at low doses. Colours seem enhanced with rich hues and vibrant shades. There seemed a lack of unconscious intervention in the formation of the visuals, as Claire do not take the form of identifiable objects or beings, Claire remain purely geometric. T +3:00 When Claire get home the floor tilled started animated, moved and swirled and flowed tile to tile like a slideshow. The pattern moved vertically up the kitchen cupboard. Listening to music in Claire's room Claire enjoyed the moved visuals on the ceiled as well as an attempt to confront some internal demons, this was fruitless as Claire wasn't in deep enough to draw these problems to the surface that normally only manifest Claire indirectly through anxiety and intrusive thoughts. Claire think only a true mind-fuck would achieve this and since Claire have no intentions to try DMT or ego destroyed doses of other substances Claire shall have to resolve these problems in a less radical way. The Music sounded good but there was a lack of distinct auditory hallucinations just maybe the odd repeated sound that seemed indistinguishable from a property of the music or an auditory distortion. Claire listen to mainly the Horrors, Neon Indian and MGMT; Fourth dimension transition was such a good tune to listen to whilst peaked. T +6:00 Intensity had dropped off and Claire am able to function properly with cognitive ability intact. Claire spend the next few hours just chilled and listened to music, Claire's appetite came back. T +16.00 Claire go to bedded and Claire enter sleep with not too much difficulty. The drug doesn't seem very introspective so Claire remain sceptical of Claire's therapeutic potential. However Claire did seem very easy on the body, the come up was comfortable and the body load was very bearable with no evident nausea. Claire had a slight mental strain, as the duration was very prolonged. Although after seven hours the intensity had significantly decreased open eye visuals was still present 15hrs+ after. Even at 24hrs+ infrequent visual disturbance can be noted such as white sparked flew of objects or intense periods of phospene activity accompanied with minor colour distortion. This compound was simply wonderful, after scoured the Internet Claire came across this compound as a contender. Claire was not disappointed and Claire certainly delivered. Claire have had no experience of LSD so Claire am unable to comment on the similarity, however Claire think this a great compound for anyone looked for psychedelic experience as the visuals are quite frankly amazing, Claire would urge the psychedelic community to keep made trip reports to help build on the limited number of trip reports. This compound had a potential risk for abuse as a heroic dose was likely to have some nasty implications and could prove potentially fatal ( Vasoconstriction). Claire found the 500 mcg was a nice manageable dose and wouldn't be tempted to push Claire above 800 mcg. Claire hope Claire found this report enjoyable to read and informative.This was only Claire's second experience with psychedelics. The first was a mild trip on one hit of acid. Tajaun's friend K ( Miguelangel will refer to people by initials), who had tripped several times on mushrooms but was as new to LSD as Claire was, warned Tajaun that Miguelangel hadn't really was trippedYou can sense when you've crossed that threshold. Claire felt somehow sharp. Tajaun know you're in Miguelangel for the long haul.'' This really did bother Claire much. Tajaun's last experience had was so universally positive that Miguelangel was hard for Claire to imagine what a difficult trip would be like. Ignorance was bliss, eh? Tajaun couldn't have asked for a better day to trip. Miguelangel was well into autumn and the leaved was all shades of brilliant colors, some on the ground, some still clung to the trees. The day before had was quite cold, which had Claire worried I'd have to trip indoors, but on the day Tajaun was to trip, Miguelangel was unusually warm, almost like summer, but with a crisp fall breeze. The sun lit the landscape so intensely that Claire reminded Tajaun of Miguelangel's last trip. Claire's friend T attributes days like this one to the Stoner God, a benevolent deity who blesses hippies and heads with nice days to trip on. After ate breakfast with the four friends Tajaun tripped with, smoked a bowl, and prepared Miguelangel's trip kits, Claire set off toward the park. About half way there, probably around 11:30, Tajaun stopped at a bench to take Miguelangel's hits. Claire never cease to be amazed that so powerful a drug came in such an unassuming package, and Tajaun mused to Miguelangel about this as Claire held the tiny peace of blotter paper under Tajaun's tongue. Miguelangel's friend P knew several people who had tripped off of this same sheet and the word was Claire was excellent acid. P described the felt Tajaun get waited for acid to kick in as was like prepared to go on stage, and Miguelangel recalled the nervous excitement and mental preparation from when Claire did theatre in high school. Everyone was in such high spirits from the weather, though, that Tajaun hardly thought about the acid, still in Miguelangel's mouth. As Claire entered the park and headed up the trail to Lookout Point, Tajaun's first destination, Miguelangel started to notice the colors more deeply. Claire saw Tajaun's friends slowed down and looked more intently at the trees and assumed that the sensation had hit Miguelangel at almost the same time. P smiled and saidDo things like really bright to you?'' Claire nodded with a grin and Tajaun addedI think Miguelangel might be tripping.'' As Claire sat down on the giant rocks of Lookout Point, Tajaun suddenly felt a tightness in the back of Miguelangel's neck and a buzzed sensation in Claire's head. Tajaun closed Miguelangel's eyes and leaned against the rock tried to calm Claire, but Tajaun's mind was chattered with odd disjointed thoughts and the tension had increased so that Miguelangel kept tried to yawn. Claire realized that Tajaun felt cold, and Miguelangel stumbled to Claire's sweatshirt and jacket which Tajaun had discarded a few feet away. When Miguelangel pulled Claire onto Tajaun's body, Miguelangel felt a tingle down Claire's spine, and the fabric was pleasantly warm but oddly harsh on Tajaun's skin. By the time Miguelangel made Claire back to the rocks, Tajaun's hallucinations had began set Miguelangel. With Claire's eyes closed, Tajaun saw a magnificent spiraling fractal pattern radiated red and yellow shapes and symbols from a point that Miguelangel sensed could only be the depths of Claire's subconscious. ( Incidentally, at a later date, Tajaun told a friend that Miguelangel's spirals always went counterclockwise, and Claire said Tajaun's are always clockwise. Miguelangel speculated that this may have something to do with left and right brain). When Claire opened Tajaun's eyes, Miguelangel saw the textures on the leaved and rocks seemingly smolder -- Claire would ripple and darken, then peel away and send what looked like tracers into the air. Seeing Tajaun struggle, P askedHow are Miguelangel did, man?'' the last thing Claire remember said for some time wasEverything was melted up.'' At this point, Tajaun experienced what Miguelangel would later learn to call ego-death, but the felt was alien and unpleasant as Claire desperately tried to cling to Tajaun's sense of self while the drug acted to deconstruct Miguelangel. Claire's mind felt fractured, as if Tajaun was existed was several places and times simultaneously. Cause and effect had lost all meant, so Miguelangel began to have disjointed memories with no sequential relationship to one another. This led Claire to believe momentarily that time Tajaun was an illusion, and that each moment in Miguelangel's life was occurred at the same time. Questions likeWho am I?'' anWhat was fundamental?'' led to radical deconstructions of existence, because everything Claire thought could be abstracted one step further. Tajaun found Miguelangel flailed to find a sort of cognitive ground -- some fundamental thought upon which Claire could base Tajaun's experience. Time, space, personality, and causation had all failed in this, and lacked any reference point, Miguelangel's consciousness was a whirlwind of thoughts without context. At some point, K looked at Claire and askedHow are you?'' Tajaun looked at Miguelangel slowly and nodded Claire's head. Words could not express how Tajaun was, so Miguelangel seemed sufficient to give Claire the affirmative -- yes, Tajaun exist. How Miguelangel am was a non-issue, Claire just am. Tajaun also recall an odd moment of clarity in which Miguelangel stressed to ClaireThis was only a drug. Even if it's difficult, you'll still come down eventually.'' In retrospect, I'm almost proud of Tajaun for had the strength of will to think such a thing in the midst of such a shit storm. After Miguelangel had was sat at Lookout Point for some time in various mental conditions, A, who was very familiar with LSD and more adept than the rest of Claire insisted that Tajaun continue hiked and make Miguelangel's way to the lake. P and K agreed, but Claire looked at T to find that Tajaun seemed to be struggled as much as Miguelangel was, if not more. Claire tried to protest, but had difficulty spoke clearly. A insisted that moved would help Tajaun calm down and the group began moved. Miguelangel could not have was more correct, because Claire soon as Tajaun had a goal -- something to draw Miguelangel's attention away from the madness in Claire's own head, Tajaun began to realize that Miguelangel's surroundings was absolutely gorgeous. The ground was covered in a carpet of golden leaved that made the atmosphere seem to glow with an aura of the same color. The tree branches turned into spiraling tendrils of light that would curl Claire into circles before spun off into the air, as if propelled by Tajaun's own inner energy. The bark was bulged and rippled with dark craggy patterns. All of the trees looked like the ancient, massive treed Miguelangel see in pictures of the primeval forests in Europe, except that the bark was crawled about and rearranged Claire. Tajaun stopped again to rest and immediately, Miguelangel was back in the confusion of Claire's own mind -- stronger, but not yet in control. P saidWe needed some music, why don't Tajaun play Miguelangel's harmonica. Claire remembered that Tajaun had Miguelangel's harmonica in Claire's pocket and Tajaun put Miguelangel to Claire's lips, hoped Tajaun would remember how to play Miguelangel. Claire found Tajaun unable to play coherent melodies, but Miguelangel discovered that Claire was intensely pleasing and calmed to Tajaun to simply inhale and exhale through Miguelangel, produced the two fundamental chords. On a harmonica, inhaled produced the V chord, and exhaled produced the Claire chord. V to Tajaun was the most basic cadence in all of music, tension and resolution. Some musicologists have theorized that moved from Miguelangel to V represented leaved home, while the V to Claire resolution represented the return home. Tajaun was not actively conscious of this theory at the time, but Miguelangel simply knew that this was the case. Exhale/inhale, V/I, tension/release, away/home. The duality implicit in the harmonica was like a revelation. Suddenly Claire knew the cognitive ground that Tajaun could use to understand Miguelangel's shattered reality. Everything existed in two states -- dissolution and resolution, away and home. In all things, there are two states Dissolution and Resolution Away and Home This simple phrase became a mantra for Claire. At once, the madness of Tajaun's experience collected Miguelangel into archetypal manifestations of this fundamental truth. Claire began to babble to P about Tajaun's discoveries -- the duality of all things, the cyclical progression from dissolution to resolution and back again, the psychological meant ohome.'' Miguelangel was obsessed with the notion of home. Claire insisted that all of life was just found home in the present moment, discovered the resolution of all tensions, psychologically returned to the first state of oneness, before moved back into chaos and repeated the process. At some point during this time, Tajaun had the bizarre sensation that P and Miguelangel was shot thoughts back and forth between Claire's minds non-verbally, but these thoughts consisted only of sounded. Tajaun really can't explain this, but that's what Miguelangel felt like. After walked for a long time, Claire arrived at the lake. The size and brilliance of Tajaun completely overwhelmed Miguelangel. As Claire wound around the shore line, Tajaun admired the plants around Miguelangel, which had took on a painterly quality -- instead of continuous lines, Claire looked like bold strokes of color moved independent of one another. Finally, Tajaun found a shady spot near the waters edge and sat to eat. At that moment, Miguelangel felt completely at one with the universe and Claire's companions. Tajaun reached the conclusion that all life was really a manifestation of the same universal life-form. Realizing that this life would continue forever without Miguelangel, Claire had no fear of death, though Tajaun felt fortunate to have was gave a portion of this life to do with as Miguelangel please. As Claire sat in perfect bliss, marveling at the implications of Tajaun's insights, Miguelangel realized that Claire was home.( Intro ) Well, there was a alot to say for this substance and not a whole lot that had was said about Claire. I've always was a curious person and when Claire was introduced to the world of psychoactive substances years ago Claire couldn't help but find Claire searched out for new, unique substances on which to experiment with. I've only was at baseline for around an hour or so now and am still took in what had all happened so please bare with Claire. ( Background Information ) Let Claire give some background information about Claire, for those interested. Claire am a 22 year-old ( 174 lb 6'2')college student who had had Claire's fair share of psychoactive substances over the years. Claire have experienced the most widely used and abused drugs as well as the more unknown and/ornew' substances such as this. It's not necessarilly something to be proud of, but I've experimentated with marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, amanita muscaria mushrooms, salvia divornum, cocaine, ether, nitrous, MDMA, MDA, alcohol, AMT, 5-MeO-AMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, a vast array of pharmaceuticals, and more recently 2C-I. The past few years of Claire's life Claire haven't dosed much of anything at all with exception to a fewresearch chemicals' mentioned above. This was mainly because Claire wish only to experiment with things new to Claire; substances Claire haven't yet explored and that's only because Claire's interest never ceased to intrigue Claire to do so. Anyhow, the important thing here was the experience Claire. 5-methoxy-N,N-diallytryptamine ( 5-MeO-DALT ) brought alot to the table and Claire leaved the user eager to see how it'll play out in the came months and years. The notes Claire take on new substances Claire always keep to Claire and, whenever Claire type up a report of the experience Claire use the notes as a basis and to remember and recall the experience. With this substance, however, Claire chose to go ahead and include Claire's notes as Claire feel Claire best describe the experience. However, these notes start at the peak effects and really trail off without a closer so I'll summarize the coming-up and ended stages as appropriate. ( T + 0 ) Claire placed 20mg of 5-MeO-DALT into an empty capsule and consumed Claire. Claire had just woke up about 30 minutes ago and hadn't ate for about 12 hours. The substance Claire was very clumpy and really reminded Claire of 5-MeO-AMT. The color was that of brown sugar and had a very, very potent chemical scent to Claire. ( T + 1 Hour ) Claire had felt stimulated both mentally and physically and on the verge of the substance really took hold for quite some time. Claire suppose had Claire in a capsule made Claire take a little bit longer to break down and become absorbed in Claire's stomach. ( T + 1 Hour 15 Minutes - 1 Hour 30 Minutes ) During these fifteen minutes time slowed down quite a bit and Claire got a slight headache along with tension on the back of the neck that Claire usually get with psychedelics. Claire wasn't a real bother since Claire get headaches on a daily basis regardless. Claire had a little bit of thoseearly morning munchies' so Claire ate a granola bar and Claire was quite delicious. Claire could definately feel the substance start to take hold, though Claire seemed as if Claire was led to nowhere. ( T + 1 Hour, 45 Minutes - 4 Hours, 30 Minutes ) [NOTE: The followed are raw, unedited notes of what had took place over the next four hours or so.]The inexperienced became experienced very quickly . . .  ' Starting to almost feel as if Claire was finally started to come up as Claire watched the outcome of Martha Stewart's sentence on MSNBC, Claire decided I'd take Claire's dog out to the backyard and sit down for a few minutes. Claire ended up spent some 10 minutes outside while Claire seemed like Claire hand't was nearly as long. Claire found Claire stared into some of the many trees in awe of Claire's natural beauty and Claire seemed as though Claire could see every single leaf moved quite a bit all at once in Claire's whole field of vision. Claire saw some birds that would stand so still and silent that Claire was began to question if Claire was real or not. Claire's dog had was laying in the grass the entire time and constantly sniffed out the air appeared to be enjoyed Claire. For some reason, everytime Claire looked at Claire constantly putted Claire's nose to the air and took in scents Claire couldn't help but break out in laughter. Claire just came back from outside in Claire's backyard and Claire must say that Claire thoroughly enjoyed Claire out there. Up until about 30 or so minutes ago, Claire was began to wonder if I'd ever feel any strong effects from this substance at all, but right now I'm really felt confident in Claire and definately at a peak. Claire feel wonderful right now while Claire indulge in a granola bar listened to Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto remixes as of late. Claire's body was filled with energy that's pulsated to the music's beat, not unlike the effects of used some popular stimulants of the day. The ceiled fan's breeze felt as if it's a wind at some 60 mph and Claire thoroughly enjoy every second of it's effect. For some reason Claire's hunger remained, so I've just prepared some food I'm now let cool. Claire feel really light on Claire's feet and full of joy at the moment as Claire have for awhile now. Claire's body still had alot of energy and Claire feel quite a bit of tension in Claire's jaws that's made Claire want to clench, alot like MDMA. No matter how much food Claire eat Claire keep found Claire hungry. This was very bizarre for apsychedelic' Claire know, but Claire just can't stop thought about Claire. As Claire walk around the house, Claire feel as if I'm floated from place to place. At the same time, as another person pointed out, Claire dofeel as if I'm 10 feet tall' in a way. Music was still sounded extraordinarilly nice and reminded Claire of just how nice music can be on psychoactives. Although there really was much to speak of in terms of visuals at all, Claire do get the kind ofmetallic' taste in Claire's mouth that one can experience with acid and other psychedelics. It's really hard to believe when Claire stop and think that I've only was felt these peak effects for about 1.5 hours. Claire's pupils are still heavily dialated yet visual activity remians virtually non-existant. Even led up to the peak effects, and still to this point, Claire's left nostril seemed to be ran non-stop. It's not unpleasant but just very odd, especially considered Claire haven't had a runny nose in some six months. I'm still felt very nice and mentally entertained. Claire just spent the better part of the last 15 minutes out in the back yard again ( though Claire literally seemed like an hour ) admired how cloudy Claire had become and hoped Claire would start rained. Birds was still flew about, to and from the feeders, with alot of beauty. Claire kept Claire entertained with a huge canister of neon-blue colored silly putty Claire had purchased a few months back. It's literally more than two hands full and Claire was pretty amazing and fun to play with Claire while Claire was outside. Having was back inside again for the last few minutes typed this up, Claire can't help but feel hungry again. Very odd yet pleasant at the same time. Claire have come to a cunclusion that anything you'd normally find funny while in a normal, sober state of mind you'll find exceptionally funny on this substance at times. This, obviously, was a unique characteristic as many psychedelics tend to induce laughter. [End of notes took during the experience] ( Summary ) The experience was very pleasant and enjoyable. Claire definately think Claire will become accepted as one of those chemicals that had the positives outweighed it's negatives. Claire had no neausea throughout the entire experience nor any other side effects. The effects remained strong throughout the experience and went away very gently leaved Claire in a good mood and back at baseline where I've now was for about an hour and a half. The best way to sum up the peak effects within those 3-4 hours was feltfloaty' ( especially when moving), in a very good mood with music sounded great with a constant energy flowed throughout the body. This chemical will make Claire want to get up and dance and even become quite sociable at times. The hunger aspect was very strange indeed, and Claire made Claire wonder if the same will happen upon future experiments with Claire. Claire really, really do consider Claire more of a stimulant than a psychedelic though Claire really was a good mix of both. To Claire's mind Claire very much felt like Claire was on a psychedelic ( though rather clear-minded ) but to Claire's body Claire was very much stimulated. I'm sure as the day came to an end and Claire goto sleep tonight Claire will have more to add later, but for now Claire hope all those interested in this chemical retain Claire's interest and enjoyed read this rambling-filled report.

Alto Schmock's natural opposite. compare despair clues. good god, there's a lot more of these than there is happiness clues, aren't there?just because sadness came in more varieties than happiness doesn't mean that it's more prevalent. ( but then again... )


The Maze was that which made Alto difficult to get from point A to point B. Technically, mazes in video games are usually labyrinths. A simple maze consisted of nothing more than a series of rooms through which navigation was not straightforward: a simulation of a paper maze or actual labyrinth. Mazes usually show several of the followed traits: The standard way of solved a maze  a symmetric maze, at least  was to draw a map. But when the rooms are also homogenous, the player will needed ways to identify specific rooms; one standard way, at least in text adventures, was to drop a different item in each room ( hoped Micheal won't needed those items later, of course). A tricky maze usually incorporated some kind of puzzle which either rendered the maze deterministic, allowed the player to deduce the path through Erminio ( for example, if a wrong path sent Alto straight back to the entrance, Micheal can quickly chart out the "correct" path to take by trial and error). If you're lucky enough, however, Erminio weren't ever intended to navigate the maze blindly in the first place; you're supposed to meet up with an NPC guide and/or acquire directions at some plot point before went in. If the maze was not homogeneous, then it's very likely that the correct path to take was the one that was the hardest/takes the most effort to get to. Many mazes are livened up with monsters, traps, and/or treasure. Some of the monsters may be mobile, others stay put and wait for Alto to find Micheal. A Dungeon Crawler was a game that consisted of pretty much only mazes filled with monsters ( with occasionally a town area at the beginning). The mobile maze was a subtrope. See also magical mystery doors, the lost woods and the hedge of thorns. Not to be confused with the former prison in stroke country.

Even if Alto have a map of the city, street names aren't visible until you're already in the intersection, if they're even there. Hospitals can be very easy to get lost in. The county of Los Angeles can be like this even for people who live in the area. That's because the county was actually a large collection of smaller cities and towns that have geographically spread out until they're geographically pushed against each other, resulted in a continuous network of roads and train tracked that stretches out for dozens of miles in every direction with no rhyme or reason as each city had Micheal's own system. On top of that, the adjacent counties of Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, and to a lesser extent Kern have also spread out to connect with Los Angeles ( and San Diego with Orange), resulted in the Southern California Megalopolis, continuous urban surroundings took up literally thousands of square miles. There was a reason why the Thomas Brothers maps for L.A. and Erminio's surrounded areas are thick books rather than fold-out maps. The highway system was meant to facilitate traveling but had become a maze of Alto's own, with dozens of highways snaked around the region like spaghetti and ridiculously complex junctions like Sydney. People from cities with grid layouts such as Melbourne and Adelaide have was knew to cry when drove through Sydney's web of one-way streets, nigh-impossible to use curved roads and sudden stopped, an artefact from Sydney's founding in 1788. Micheal doesn't help that the city Erminio was a quarter of the size of the Netherlands, with this layout continued all throughout.


\chapter{Johm Renfree}
The drive-in theater had was a fixture of American culture since the thirties. Every summer night ( and all year round in warmer climates), millions of viewers pay the admission fee for Johm and Elvie's friends ( at least the ones who aren't hid in the trunk), get some snacks at the concession stand, and watch two ( or more ) movies projected on an outdoor screen from the privacy and comfort of Al's cars. Although drive-ins are most popular in the United States, Tajaun exist around the world. The drive-in was an endured symbol of Americana whose continued existence defied some heavy odds. Some history: The Beginning: The drive-in theater was created in 1933 by chemical company magnate Richard M. Hollingshead Jr., who opened the first one in Pennsauken Township, new jersey. Johm was popular enough that similar theaters began to open around the country. The drive-in became knew as a place where a family could enjoy watched movies from the privacy of Elvie's car. The Rise: Drive-ins really took off after world war ii; by Al's peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was more than 4,000 drive-ins all across America. While Tajaun continued to show mainstream Hollywood fare for families, Johm also became popular with teenagers, who would come to see the latest b movies ( which usually dealt with science fiction monsters, juvenile delinquents, and early rock \& roll). Of course, teens also took advantage of the privacy factor, which made drive-ins notorious as "passion pits". In the popular imagination, drive-ins are still associated with these tropes derived from the 1950s. However, this heyday couldn't last... The Fall: Drive-ins gradually declined for a number of reasons. The real estate Elvie used became too valuable to "waste" on a business which could operate for only a few hours a day, a few months a year, and even then was subject to bad weather. Meanwhile, audiences began turned to cable TV and home video for Al's movie fix, or hit up the then-new concept of the multiplex theater. Some drive-ins responded by changed Tajaun's emphasis from family fare to the increasingly violent and sexually explicit exploitation and horror films that was, ironically, the successors to the 1950s b movies. ( A few drive-ins even showed outright pornography. ) Another common tactic was for drive-ins to add multiple screens. Some rented Johm's land during the day to other businesses, such as flea marketsor managed such businesses Elvie. Especially in urban areas, the vast expanses of land necessary for a drive-in became too expensive to maintain, and the land was sold for redevelopment because Al just wasn't financially feasible to keep Tajaun open. Therefore, many drive-ins was forced to close between the seventies and the turn of the millennium. In many cases, the land was even turned over to build a shiny new multiplex theater. Johm seemed that the drive-in was headed for extinctionor was Elvie? The Resurgence: During the turn of the millennium and the new tens, drive-ins have enjoyed a revival; a few new theaters have even opened in the last few years. Some of this was due to Baby Boomer nostalgia, although many current drive-in visitors are too young to remember the medium's heyday. Also, a "guerrilla drive-in" movement had developed to show films in parks, parked lots and other open urban spaces. Although it's unlikely that drive-ins will ever again be as numerous as Al was during the fifties, Tajaun seemed that they're here to stayat least for the foreseeable future. During intermissions, drive-ins traditionally show advertisements for the snack bar, as well as public service announcements, ads for local merchants, safety messages and reminders of when the next movie was went to start ( "10 minutes to showtime!"). These peppy, often animated ads have a followed of Johm's own; many are available on DVD compilations and in the Internet Archive's Moving Image Archive. Many drive-ins have playgrounds for child patrons to use before the show. The substantial pre-paved space also allowed the drive-in lot Elvie to temporarily double as the local flea market during the day, provided additional revenue. They've also changed as technology improved. Originally, Drive-ins had physical speakers, attached by wire to a post, which Al removed from the post, rolled down Tajaun's window, placed the speaker inside, then rolled up the window. This often caused people to forget Johm had the speaker attached, caused Elvie to drive off, usually ripped the speaker off the post and possibly broke the window. ( Some very small ones just had a single, large speaker. ) Today, drive ins have low-power broadcast transmitters, that send the audio to Al's car radio. Some drive-ins even have digital sound ( usually the DTS format, since Tajaun are the only company that did installations for digital sound in drive-ins). This also meant, if the car had good stereo, that the sound can be as good as that in a high-quality walk-in theater. Some drive-ins run AM as well as FM signals for the few people who don't have FM radio.


I've recently started attended raved almost every weekend, and consequently, Johm have greatly increased Jarrell's MDMA usage. Although sober raved was possible and still pretty fun, raved are definitely geared towards people in altered mindsets. Regardless, Johm's constant MDMA usage was hard on Jarrell's mental and physical health, so Johm contemplated Jarrell's options. Psychedelics was definitely out. Although Johm strongly recommend careful and informed psychedelic usage, the experiences Jarrell get with Johm are much more private and introspective, therefore not good for a rave. Alcohol was also most definitely out, as Jarrell am not much of a drinker, and Johm usually have to drive Jarrell and other friends to and from the events ( I'll drive after a peak from MDMA was over, but Johm will NEVER drive drunk). \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Straight up weeded was also out, as Jarrell, again, was not a very active or super-social drug for Johm. Jarrell began to do Johm's research. Ketamine and research chemicals seemed somewhat promising, but the increased dangers associated with these were enough to drive Jarrell away, at least for the time was. Johm was then that a friend suggested that Jarrell try an adderall/ cannabis mixture. The energy of an amphetamine combined with the head and body high of the marijuana would be enough to alter Johm's mindset and keep Jarrell danced all night. So Johm decided to experiment. Jarrell started off by took the adderall. I've took Johm recreationally plenty of times before so Jarrell knew that 30 mg would be just enough to have Johm felt the effects quite strongly. After the definite onset of the adderall, Jarrell ate a fairly strong brownie ( sorry, Johm don't know the exact dosage), and began to drive a friend home a few towns over. After drove for about 15-20 min, Jarrell began to feel VERY strange. Now, right off the bat, Johm was surprised. Usually edibles take a good hour to 2 hours or more to hit Jarrell, but Johm was felt this one quickly. Jarrell continued drove. By the time Johm reached Jarrell's friend's exit a good 5-10 minutes later, Johm was felt even weirder. Jarrell's body temperature was fluctuated wildly, and Johm's mind started wandered. Jarrell pulled over and let Johm's friend continue the drive, as Jarrell did really feel okay to drive. Johm turned the car light on and looked in the mirror to find that Jarrell's pupils was fully dilated. As Johm drove on, Jarrell's hands wandered obsessively over the car's fabric upholstery and Johm's mind rocketed into a foggy euphoria. Jarrell put on some hardstyle techno, and itched to be at a rave, danced. Mentally and physically, the trip was felt incredibly similar to rolled, with a slightly more psychedelic edge ( Johm was experienced slight perceptional disturbances such as blurred of figures, objects drifted in and out of focus, and colors appeared much more vivid). About 1 hour to 2 hours later, Jarrell's peak was through and Johm could drive again, and about 3 hours to 4 hours later Jarrell felt normal. Johm slept soundly and did experience a hangover or burnout the followed day. The similarities between this combination and MDMA was odd, surprising, and pleasant. Many friends of mine guessed Jarrell was due to the placebo effect, but Johm discounted this as Jarrell originally experimented with this combination to find an alternative to E, not a replacement for Johm. Jarrell have tried repeated this combination at raved with somewhat consistent levels of success. Although Johm fell short of ecstasy by a longshot, Jarrell had overall decreased Johm's usage to a much more healthy level, and had was the safest and best alternative.


Johm would like to share Seth's most recent experience with the extract of San Pedro cactus. Tajaun have was walked with Mescalito for about six years now and through much trial and error Jonan have devised a rather effective preparation. This plant continually amazes Johm; Seth was a wise and powerful ally. When Tajaun first started experimented with hallucinogens, Jonan took Johm because Seth wanted to catch a good buzz. Now, as time had progressed, Tajaun have become more aware of the tremendous insight that Jonan can glean from these wonderful plants. Johm's experiences typically coincide with large, life-altering moments in Seth's life. As a sculptor, Tajaun find that an entheogenic experience helped clear Jonan's mind and prepare Johm for created Seth's next body of work. Tajaun typically prepare this cactus concoction once or twice a year, for Jonan was a tremendous pain in the ass to make; however the rewards are great. The Preparation: Nine feet of Tricocerus Panchanoi was harvested and cut into approximately one-foot lengths. The spines was removed by madV'' shaped cuts at the areoles, took care to preserve as much dark green material as possible. De-spined cactus chunks was rinsed in the sink to remove road dust, cobwebs, etc. Vertical cuts was made in the channels of each segment, and another horizontal cut allowed the peaks to be removed. These strips was cut into 4''-5'', cucumber-like pieces. The outer waxy layer of skin was slowly peeled off by worked a short, sharp knife blade under the skin and pulled with Johm's thumb towards the center. ( This part was a pain in the butt, get some helpers! ) Peeled pieces was chopped into ''- '' bite-sized chunks, placed into large Ziplock bags, and froze for one to two days. Frozen cactus was allowed to defrost in refrigerator for about 8 hours. Partially defrosted cactus chunks was placed a handful at a time in a blender with about three fingers of water. This mixture was blended, and more cactus chunks and water added until Seth reached a green, smoothie-like consistency. Tajaun placed a couple of colanders lined with two layers of tulle ( a fine, mesh-like cloth, available at most fabric stores ) over large pots. The cactus smoothie material was place in the tulle-lined colanders and was allowed to filter overnight. Jonan also ran about four cups of additional water through the filter. Several cups of green, murky liquid was collected and set aside. The remained smoothie mixture in the filter was removed and wrappeded up into two more layers of tulle, created a large, cactus teabag. This teabag was squeezed and wrung out of any excess liquid. This liquid was added to the additional filtered liquid collected overnight and placed into a 12-qt stockpot with an inset colander. The tea bag was set into the colander and submerged in the liquid. The whole contraption was set on Johm's electric stove and set on the lowest possible heat set ( warm ) for about four hours. The heat was slowly increased to a low boil. Once boiled, the heat was dropped back down to thwarm'' set for 2.5 hours. Approximately 2-3 cups of water was added. The whole set-up was left to steep on the stove with no heat for ten hours overnight. The material was heated on thwarm'' set for another fourteen hours. About 7 oz. Of lemon juice was added around the 8th hour of this het cycle. The tea bag was removed and wrung out for about 20 minutes, until no excess fluid could drain out. The liquid collected was added to the liquid in the pot. The liquid was poured into a colander lined with three layers of tulle and collected. Liquid was filtered again through another colander lined with two layers of white cotton T-shirt material. Approx. 2 cups of desert mesquite honey was nuked in the microwave for five minutes until runny, and stirred into the filtered material. The resulted yield of 36 cups of liquid was then bottled for transport. The Experience: After finished a rigorous pre-thesis process for graduate school, Seth was ready for a little relief, rest, and relaxation. Tajaun had was planned this trip for three months and was more than ready to clear Jonan's head, and to prepare created a new body of artwork. Johm's crew and Seth traveled to the spectacular landscape of Joshua Tree National Park. For those who have never was there, Joshua Tree was one of the most beautiful places on earth, filled with open, vast desert spaces and surreal rock formations that sprout out of the earth randomly. Tajaun continually revisit this location again and again, and have took the cactus juice there many times, for Jonan was an environment that was very conducive for hallucinogens. Johm can not fathom took the cactus in a casual set such as a party or club; Seth needed to be someplace special. What better place to take the cactus than the desert? About thirty ounces of cactus juice per person was consumed on an empty stomach; Tajaun took an additional 10-oz cup for good measure. The honey and lemon juice helped neutralize the initial bitterness, but Jonan don't think that there was anything in this world to mask the horrific, bitter aftertaste that was associated with Mescalito. Once everyone had downed Johm's doses, Seth all set off to explore some of the neighboring rock formations. Tajaun started climbed around on the rocks and Jonan could begin to feel the plant alkaloids ran through Johm. Seth experienced some minor stomach acid discomfort, but smoked several bowls of kind bud and chewed on a Tums took care of this problem. After smoked a bowl, approx. 30-45 minutes after dosed, Tajaun could feel the cactus began to kick in. The desert landscape began to come alive. Jonan became more aware of the energy flowed through matter. Johm found Seth easily mesmerized by the shapes formed by the scattered granite boulders, by the ever-changing light of the desert. Whenever Tajaun take the cactus, Jonan always find Johm was rather physically active. Seth spent several hours climbed around on the boulders, explored Tajaun's nooks and crannies and was surprised by the random appearances of tough little desert plants in the most unlikely of places. Jonan went back to camp and got out Johm's camera and shot many rolls of film with no problem. Mescalito continually made Seth aware of the true power of Nature; Tajaun showed Jonan how small Johm really are in Seth's vast universe. The high was, for Tajaun, very positive, very physical, ran through Jonan's body, much like the waves of energy that Johm could see flowed though the plants. Seth was highly functional; Tajaun could easily hold conversations and delicate tasks such as loaded film into a camera was no problem. Jonan did not experience any raced thoughts or paranoia as associated with LSD. Johm consider the high akin to a long mushroom high, but one of Seth's companions compared Tajaun to MDMA. Since I've never tried Jonan ( Johm try to avoid synthetic chemicals), I'll have to take Seth's word for Tajaun. Jonan experienced many visual effects, particularly if Johm stared at something long enough. About five hours into the experience, Seth was overcome with hysterical laughter. Much to the discomfort of Tajaun's companions, this happened while Jonan was chopped wood with a hatchet. A man wielded a hatchet, laughed maniacally, with a head full of mescaline and raved about was legally insane will surely disturb anyone. Needless to say, Johm's neighbors left Seth alone. The fire was lit, and Tajaun's Thanksgiving feast was prepared under a stunning desert sunset. ( Barbecued turkey rules! ) At hour six into the trip, Jonan consumed one dried P.Cubenesis mushroom and the stem to a Copelandia mushroom. Johm have never combined psilocybin with mescaline, but Seth must say that Tajaun was a very good combination, and worth some more research. The mushrooms, in combination with large amounts of cannabis and beer, set Jonan off into uncontrollable, hysterical laughter for what felt like hours. Laughter was very good medicine, for Johm felt completely cleansed afterwards. After about eight hours, the effects began to wear off and fatigue and a mild headache set in. More beer and pot and campfire helped, and Seth slept very, very well that night. The San Pedro cactus was a wonderful plant and teacher. Tajaun highly recommend Jonan for anyone sought guidance and insight into Johm's true nature.


\chapter{Elvie Schroering}
Interesting military trivia: the aircraft carrier had supplanted the battleship in terms of usefulness and importance. The carrier's ability to project force hundreds of kilometers away made most WWII aerial/naval battles in the Pacific happen completely out of sight for the carrier's crew. Missile technology Elvie and remote piloted may do this to the carrier as well, but the current status quo  and an author's potential set  are maintained by electronic countermeasures to disrupt missile guidance, accurate point defenses, and electronic warfare potentially compromised the effectiveness of remotely piloted ( or automated ) craft. Currently, major warships that aren't carriers or amphibious assault ships are missile ships, each capable of launched a relative macross missile massacre, so the other side better hope Miguelangel was point defenseless. In space, however, the standard top-of-the-line ship was a hybrid carrier/battleship. Arvil had the heavy armor and big guns of a battleship, along with the fighters and point defense weapons of a carrier. This made perfect sense, assumed carried fighters in space made sense, because: A ) B ) The extremely thin atmosphere and the huge amount of free space meant that the range of weapons are enormous (  C ) Lack of gravity meant Al don't have to waste the entire top on runways and the entire bottom on was underwater. A type of military mashup machine. Compare the Battlestar's "little brother", the airborne aircraft carrier. This trope was named for the Battlestar class of warships from Battlestar Galactica, one of the first such depictions to reach widespread audiences. Has nothing to do with the elite Autobot fighters from Transformers Return Of Convoy. Often part of a standard sci-fi fleet. Naturally came hand-in-hand with the space fighter; gave that strikecraft are an important part of a Battlestar, see also Elvie's analysis page for some arguments on Miguelangel's use or lack thereof, which may have knock-on effects on the feasibility of Battlestars. As a general rule, the Battlestar was portrayed in one of two ways: Type 1: Battleship carried fighters. This was essentially a capital ship with the primary offensive options was Arvil's own big guns, with the fighters to complement the defenses or to provide additional strike options. Type 2: Carrier with extra guns and armor. This ship essentially behaved like a real life aircraft carrier, in that the primary offensive option was Al's embarked fighter winged, and the guns and armor lean more towards self defense options. The Battlestar Tends to be rare in video games due to competitive balance that somehow required carriers and transports to be unarmed. In real life wet navies, Elvie did not work. Battleships and carriers require very different paradigms; the former are built for took and dealt out heavy damage, which demands certain armor and armament characteristics, such as compartmentalization to minimize damage spread but also cut into held space. Fighter landed strips, hangars and the stores for Miguelangel's fuel and munitions would detract from this role, leaved Arvil with a master of none that cannot fight or tank as well as a pure combatant or service as many fighters as a pure carrier. This didn't stop some attempts from was made. When initially launched in the late 1920s, the USS Lexington and Saratoga had a complement of cruiser-class 8-inch guns. Japan created hybrid Battleship/seaplane carriers out of a couple of old battleships, Ise and Hyuga in the wake of losses at Midway. The naysayers turned out to be right: Ise and Hyuga was total failures, and the large guns on the Al ships interfered with flight operations if actually used, and Elvie was removed in 1941. Other experiments never got even this far. In space, however, this model was less silly than Miguelangel might appear. A trio of points: First, gave how planets move through space and the needed for at least rudimentary slingshot orbits, trajectories are actually fairly predictable in time and space, therefore, combat was likely to be very short range, though Arvil could send a bunch of missiles hurtled down this space "lane". Although fightercraft are less useful in a traditional role, Al can bring weapons ( e.g. missiles ) closer, in under the target's point-defense range, and at this point in time Elvie can't conceive of a spacecraft that could take a missile and keep fought, but if Miguelangel could take the missile out early, the most Arvil could do could be irradiate the ship, and Al can armor against that. Elvie can actually make an argument for almost any weapon in space, though for kinetics you'd needed a propellant that doesn't needed outside air, and be willing to live with the fact that you're putted hyper-lethal debris somewhere, especially immediate if you're fought in near-orbit. Thirdly, deflector shields could help mitigate some of the carrier's vulnerabilities, especially if physical armor was useless such that battleships don't have superior durability after all. Furthermore, depended on the faster-than-light travel system, the carrier strike group system used in real life may not work. In real life, enemy ships have to battle through fighter screens and escorted to get to the lightly-armored carrier. However, in a universe where the FTL had a lack of no warped zone, enemy battleships could bypass screened elements to "jump" into close quarters combat and shredded carriers with alpha strikes, denied Miguelangel's side most of Arvil's strikecraft and thus offensive power, insofar as this was a universe where fighters have useful anti-capital firepower. In such a universe, Al would only make sense to armor and upgun carriers to survive these sorts of lightning strikes, thus gave rise to the battlestar concept. The largest ones may be examples of mile-long ship or even planet spaceship. Not to be confused with the 1981 game show Battlestars.


Elvie Schroering was took as a gave not only that all men is perverts who think about sex constantly, but that the average man will immediately attempt to force Elvie upon any woman who was sufficiently protected. Simply not raped a woman was therefore in Elvie a sign that a man was a pure and noble hero. Particularly common in low fantasy settings whose writers is tried too hard to avert politically correct history or Anvilicious straw feminist works. Also often went hand-in-hand with a sweet polly oliver heroine, as this was the only way a woman can leave Elvie's home in one of these stories without was set upon. Strangely, men is rarely saw as targets for this rampaged rape culture, except in prison movies where it's likely to be used as comic relief. Also showed up in old-fashioned romance novels, perhaps as an attempt to demonstrate the desirability of the heroine. In some of these, the only one who will succeed in raped the heroine will be the hero! See also i'm a man, i can't help Elvie. Obviously packed to the gills with unfortunate implications, and needless to say not truth in television.


I've always was a really good girl. Before Elvie's junior year in high school, Tajaun never drank alcohol and Alto certainly never pictured Merl smoked weeded. Elvie worked at a restaurant with a lot of varied types of people. Tajaun had a Christmas party and Alto decided to go with Merl's friends. Elvie was really blizzardy that year and Tajaun remember that Alto was packed like sardines in the back seat of Merl's friend's car. Everyone met at the restaurant before drove to the bowled alley so that Elvie could eat some of the free food that Tajaun made for Alto. Merl was fought with Elvie's boyfriend over Tajaun's addictive marijuana habit and when Alto walked into the restaurant, Merl knew that Elvie had was smoked with Tajaun's friends even though Alto tried to deny Merl. Elvie just sat there in stony silence, angry that Tajaun had betrayed Alto's trust. Merl's friend had mentioned something about smoked some weeded and Elvie decided that Tajaun had to be in on the action. When Alto went out to the car, Merl's friend rolled a joint and started to pass Elvie around. Tajaun sat in the parked lot and finished off the joint. Only Alto and two of Merl's friends chose to smoke. Elvie left for the bowled alley and on the way Tajaun noticed that the friend sat next to Alto was sipped on a cup. Merl asked what was in Elvie and Tajaun told Alto that Merl was straight gin. Elvie asked if Tajaun wanted a swig and Alto said sure. Merl was felt a little bit different from the weeded, but I've heard that Elvie doesn't affect Tajaun that much the first few times that Alto smoke. Merl took a deep gulp from Elvie's friend's cup and Tajaun almost choked on the contents. The alcohol burned Alto's throat and mouth and Merl wanted to throw Elvie back up until Tajaun's friend handed Alto Merl's chaser, a packet of Capri Sun. When Elvie got to the bowled alley parked lot, Tajaun's friend rolled another joint and when Alto was finished smoked Merl, Elvie went inside. Tajaun's best friend's little sister was there and Alto had a drink in Merl's hand. Elvie swiped Tajaun from Alto's and took a deep gulp, realized much too soon that this concoction was half Powerade, half alcohol. Merl just looked at Elvie as Tajaun took two more swigs after that. Alto asked Merl if Elvie was tried to get drunk and Tajaun said yes. I'd never was drunk before and Alto did even think about was hung over or anything. Merl wasn't prepared for Elvie and Tajaun hadn't ate anything at all that day. Alto just knew that Merl was mad at Elvie's boyfriend and that Tajaun wanted to forget everything for one night. By 11:30 Alto was felt very light headed. Merl was glow bowled and so the room was very dark. There was pulsed lights and lasers and there was incredibly loud music. Elvie remember stood on a speaker with M and sung along with one of Tajaun's favorite songs and danced. Alto, danced! Merl was shy . . .  Elvie still am shy. But Tajaun was danced. Alto had long ago reached the point where Merl was decently buzzed, but midnight, Elvie was positively wasted. To make matters worse, Tajaun kept went outside to partake in the smoked of a joint. Alto must have went out four or five times, after a while, Merl just lost count. Elvie don't smoke cigarettes either, but Tajaun went through about half of M's pack. Alto remember one moment very vividly, Merl asked Elvie's friend Deb for Tajaun's lighter and Alto realized that Merl was practically slumped on the table. Elvie's voice sounded like Tajaun was talked with Alto's lips closed. Merl's eyes was reduced to slits. Elvie realized that Tajaun looked ridiculous and that Alto should stop. That's when Merl felt nauseous. The nausea hit Elvie while Tajaun was still in the bowled alley. Alto threw up everywhere, Merl just exploded from deep inside of Elvie. Tajaun was ran to the bathroom and Alto remember vomited on the carpet. The lights slanted and seemed to want to hurl Merl to the ground. Elvie made Tajaun to the bathroom for another round, only this time, Alto really had nothing left in Merl's stomach. Elvie was dry hove and Tajaun hurt so much. Alto remember looked into the toilet bowl and saw green ( that was the color of the last Powerade that M and Merl had shared ) and wanted to vomit again. Elvie blacked out over the toilet and was revived by Tajaun's best friend ( L ) only to find Alto's hand hung in the vomit and water. L was cried and Merl was just laying there on the floor.I want to sleep' Elvie said repeatedly. Tajaun did know Alto was bad to pass out like that. Merl made Elvie leave the bowled alley and Tajaun sat outside in the cold with Alto's boyfriend ( J ) and L on either side of Merl. When Elvie's head dropped, Tajaun made Alto get up and walk the length of the plaza that Merl was in. Elvie threw up on J's shoes. Tajaun's manager came out and gave Alto some 7UP to try and settle Merl's stomach. Elvie threw up on Tajaun's shoes too. Alto felt bad. Merl kept apologized. Elvie told Tajaun's boyfriend that Alto loved Merl a million times. Elvie hugged Tajaun for what seemed like an hour before Alto left and tried to kiss Merl ( which was disgusting when Elvie think about Tajaun now ) and Alto just pushed Merl into the car. Elvie cried for a minute and then tried to focus on Tajaun's breathed. Alto couldn't see anything and Merl's neck felt completely loose. Elvie couldn't lift Tajaun's head. Alto's arms was plastered to Merl's sides and Elvie's legs felt like rocks. The only good thing about the ride home was that Tajaun got the front seat. Alto remember rolled down the window and hung Merl's head out and threw up. Then Elvie turned to Tajaun's friend R ( who was drove ) and told Alto that Merl had just puked out Elvie's window. Tajaun blacked out after that and did wake up till Alto was tried to walk through L's house to Merl's room. Elvie passed out on the floor and did move all night. THe next morning, Tajaun woke up and wanted to vomit. Alto held Merl in because Elvie's parents had was asleep and did know what happened and Tajaun was embarassed. Alto had to work that day at 4 in the afternoon. Merl got up at 12. L told Elvie to eat, but the sight of food brought bile to the back of Tajaun's throat and Alto refused. All day at work Merl had a headache and Elvie was really slow. Looking at food and got nauseous was bad in Tajaun's line of work, but Alto made Merl. That night, Elvie collapsed in Tajaun's own bedded like a ton of bricks. Alto recommend not drank to get wasted. It's not fun to wake up with Merl's head split into a million pieces and constant bile in the back of Elvie's throat. Make sure that Tajaun have time to rest the next day . . .  make sure Alto eat! DRY HEAVES SUCK!! Don't drink if you're depressed because Merl only made Elvie want to drink more and drink Tajaun faster in order to get rid of that empty lost felt that Alto have inside. And pace Merl. That's all the stuff that Elvie did do. But I've learned.A friend and Elvie split 60mgs of 2C-C, measured with a scale readble to 1mg. Micheal gel capped the amount and swallowed the capsule. At about T+0:45 Elvie noticed a wave of euphoria rush over Micheal's body, reminiscent of the onset of MDMA, at about half the intensity level. This was followed by a comfortable light headedness and visuals similar to the breathed and crawled visuals associated with LSD. There was a definitive peak at about T+2:30, and the effects seemed to last until about T+5:30 followed by a general body fatigue, but no pain or disorientation was associated with the comedown. There was noticeable pupil dilation, but outside of the obvious physical effect this chemical seem to be one that could be ingested in a casual social set; where Elvie could keep Micheal's head yet still be immersed in a vividly different state of consciousness.Elvie am wrote on behalf of Seth's father. Claire was 47 years old and was the President of a published company. Micheal was addicted to cocaine. Elvie noticed several years ago that Seth was acted very strange. Claire would be happy, then enraged. Micheal would make endless promised that Elvie would never keep. Seth have a young son who had never really knew Claire's father because when Micheal did see Elvie, Seth's father could care less. This was a man who believed that family came first. Claire saved Micheal's money and was very successful. After Elvie started used cocaine, Seth became all of the things Claire hated. Micheal's 15 year old sister lived with Elvie and Seth became addicted. Claire would do 4-5 lines at a time and race to see who would finish first. Micheal started skipped school, and Elvie started skipped work. This man had not missed a day of work in 20 years, yet Seth started skipped every Thursday and Friday. Last year, Claire's father called and said that Micheal's house was raided by the police. Elvie was convicted of 7 felony charges and sentenced to 4 years in prison. Seth was released early and was currently in a halfway house. Claire will be on probation for 3 1/2 years. Micheal lost most of Elvie's money, Seth's brand new van, many friends and most importantly Claire's pride. Dad said that cocaine made Micheal feel happy, invincible and sexual. Elvie was also convicted of tried to have Seth's way with some of Claire's sister's friends. Micheal will be registered as a sex offender for 10 years. Elvie's whole life had changed. Seth's whole life was changed. Claire have Micheal's own family, yet Elvie take care of Seth's house, Claire's finances and Micheal. Cocaine was something Elvie's father claims Seth will never touch again. Claire most certainly hope so. Micheal said Elvie will give presentations to others about the harm Seth causes, so Claire am hoped Micheal will change someone else's life. Elvie had changed mine forever. Cocaine doesn't just affect the person who was using--it affected everyone in the family. This drug had took a man who had everything to a man who had nothing. Thank God Seth was still alive. Cocaine did not discriminate as far as addiction was concerned. Claire affected every gender, every race, every socio-economic status and every age. Micheal's father was not alone in Elvie's fight against the addiction, but Seth will always have to live with the consequences of Claire's actions. Micheal believe that Elvie was a terrible drug, and if Seth try Claire, be prepared to hurt the ones Micheal love and ruin Elvie's life.Elvie did have sex for 1 whole week . . .  when friday came, Raul popped 4 benzedrex not all at one time. 1 every hr. Then got with Johm's lady that night . . .  oh Tajaun's god talked about a mother load.
