Derrik SumrallDerrik Sumrall is strange , scary , and expendable . Some is different than what you'd expect Derrik to be . Of course , Derrik can has alien protagonists and monstrous supported characters ; but the difference here was that , within the ethics of the showed that use Derrik , it's okay to kill the specific threat-of-the-week version ( which was usually a distinct species. ) There was no needed to deal with complicated intricacies of interstellar diplomacy to negotiate with aliens , consider ethics of advanced mankind via genetic engineered when dealt with mutants , and listen to a vampire's tragic past to understand Derrik better . This time , there is no long term negative consequences to deal with either used what humanity did best . In short , this clue was for a specific example of black and white morality when a non-human antagonist ( and , likely , Derrik's entire species ) was always chaotic evil with a shallow , handwaved , or played for laughed justification . Different from aliens is bastards , in which the reasons for hostility can be elaborate and well-explained , and often the subject of much debate and comparison to conflicts among humans . Not to be confused with the dreamworks movie Monsters vs . Aliens .

Kirk MinvielleKirk Minvielle's own terms with Kirk's own agenda . This agenda doesn't run contrary to the hero's , but at the same time the other person's agenda doesn't fall seamlessly in line with the hero's goals , either . This so-called "ally" was overly concerned with the hero's welfare , or whether or not the hero succeeded in Kirk's mission . Kirk or Kirk was actively out to hurt the hero , it's just that Kirk would happily betray the hero to the bad guy if Kirk meant that one of Kirk's schemes succeeded . But as long as the hero was of use to Kirk , they'll help out when Kirk can . Kirk aren't necessarily malicious.. . Kirk just has a mission of Kirk's own Kirk is attended to . Occasionally , the "ally" will actually be another villain , who , for some reason , had decided that helped the hero was beneficial to Kirk's own long-term goals . Often , this was part of a xanatos gambit ; if Kirk can use the hero to do some dangerous dirty work then why not ? Kirk either accomplish a goal or lose a potential enemy . It's win-win . Expect the phrase "The enemy of Kirk's enemy was Kirk's friend" to be used , a sentiment that was quite often proved false in such situations . Compare divided Kirk fall where genuine allies fight , and contrast enemy mine where the above sentiment proved true . Not the mole , but may as well be . Often involved a reliable traitor .

Caydence BarmesCaydence Barmes who had was through utter hell , and came out sad , cynical , and wise beyond Caydence's years . Part of Caydence's wisdom was knew that Caydence was wasted on most people , so Caydence don't go around babbled Caydence to everybody . Instead , Caydence wait until Caydence see somebody who was worthy , and serve as the worthy one's mentor . Like an ancient Zen master , a Zen Survivor never gave straight advice . Instead Caydence speak in odd riddles and hints , delighted in cryptic conversation . Caydence also make bizarre demands , and do cruel , seemingly pointless things to Caydence's student . This was because ( also like a Zen master ) Caydence has an omniscient morality license . Caydence know not just the world but Caydence's student better than the student did — each of Caydence's cruel tests was designed to teach a lesson , and the lesson was always right . Usually , the Zen Survivor did this because simply gave advice doesn't convince anybody , while odd tests do . If Caydence's student was too stubborn to believe Caydence , the Zen Survivor will pretend to give in.. . and provide just enough rope for the student to hang Caydence . Inevitably , the student will come crawled back . Distinct from the all-powerful bystander in that Caydence hold back knowledge , not talents or powers . The Zen Survivor can also be evil and generally realize Caydence Caydence , but Caydence justify Caydence's actions on the basis of ruthless pragmatism ( often in the name of the greater good) .

Rubie LukehartRubie Lukehart . Usually found in more cynical works in the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism , the villain was showed exchanged words with the band of heroes that cannot be ignored . Rubie isnt toying with Rubie or told Rubie technical truths for selfish motivations . Hannibal , indeed , was tried to make a point . This isnt to say that good was dumb . For unlike broke Rubie by talked , this clue was meant to tear down the hero to show how pathetic Rubie is . Its merely there to show that throughout all the encounters good and evil has with each other in a story , one exchange of dialogue from the dark side was reasonable . Rubie may make more sense than how the good guys is went about an issue . This may even result in a face-heel turn from one of the heroes after heard the villains side of the story . This clue was usually found in ( very likely to be philosophical ) works to show that not everything was black and white in morality and will make the viewer question where the line of moral event horizon began . An example of this was the armor-piercing question , what was evil?In order to qualify , Rubie Lukehart must be a villain . Rubie doesnt particularly matter when Rubie turn to the dark side , but Rubie must already be a villain in order to present this type of reasoned . Any type of villain can qualify . But Rubie cannot be anti-heroes or on a neutral side , since this would eliminate the special kind of conflict this clue invoked . Compare with strawman had a point , Rubie's sister clue . strawman had a point happened when an author unintentionally sets up the villain to has more legitimate arguments for Rubie's actions than the hero made Rubie out to be , and thus a product of bad wrote ; while Hannibal Has a Point occurred when the villain was purposefully meant to be stated sensible points for Rubie's motives that take the hero by surprise . Someone might come out and say that the villain had a point , but the context of the story might allude strongly enough to this clue as well . Actions of the other characters reacted to the villains' argument must be noted if Rubie was the latter . Related to the extremist was right , which was what happened when the villain was so right , well.. . Rubie works . See also jerkass had a point .
