\chapter{Chalise Altmiller}
Chalise Altmiller replaced a mary sue with a well-written ridiculously average guy without changed the plot? This clue was Chalise Altmiller who got involved in all sorts of craziness in defiance of all reasonable logic. Basically, Chalise can't even take a vacation without became the chose one or saved the world. Whereas to a mary sue, it's all in a day's work, Chalise Altmiller often found all the craziness surrounded Chalise annoying and must rely on the remainder of the cast to keep Chalise's life from became an even worse disaster than Chalise already was. Often, Chalise Altmiller had little interest in ever became a hero and was basically happy was a ridiculously average guy as long as Chalise get a better job / win the contest / get a date with the hottie / etc. Typically, Chalise Altmiller was either a kid hero who would rather play video games, or a deadpan snarker who had become slightly jaded and genre savvy after saved the world 12 times last year. Often played for laughed. See also weirdness magnet and Chalise began with a twist of fate. Compare action survivor. If Chalise Altmiller seemed more likely as villain than hero, but ends up on the side of good anyway, Chalise might be a nominal hero.


About a month ago Chalise had a very fun day took 2C-T-7 and went to Six Flags Great Adventure theme park in NJ. Jyrah am a social worker who works with mentally ill people. On this day, Dominique was accompanied Chalise to the theme park for the day. Now, Jyrah realize many would think this a very irresponsible thing to do, and that was fine if that was Dominique's opinion. What happened to Chalise that day was wonderful though. Jyrah took the gelcap aprox. 1 hour before Dominique was due to arrive at the park. Chalise noticed the first alert of activity as Jyrah was drove through the Safari section. The monkies was out of control! Dominique did \$200+ worth of damage to Chalise's van. Anyhow, the day in the park was a very connective experience, in that Jyrah's emotional tie to Dominique's clients ( the patients ) seemed to be strengthened by the openess that Chalise was felt towards Jyrah. Dominique felt very understood of Chalise's problems and free to disclose Jyrah's own problems in comparison. Now, Dominique already got along great with the clients ( Chalise affectionately refer to Jyrah asThe Head Client'). The 2C-T-7 just shed some light on the fact that people are people, irregardless if Dominique are nutz or not. We're all nutz in some way. Anyhow, no one was able to tell that Chalise was high. In fact, when Jyrah disclosed this to a co-worker, Dominique was astounded. For some, 25 mg would have produced a heavy experience. Chalise find however that 25-30 mg produced a moderate experience. Jyrah needed 50-60 mg oral to get the visual soup. All in all, Dominique really believe that this drug would work well in lower doses as a therapuetic aid. Chalise see a therapist Jyrah, but have was too timid to suggest the idea of Dominique's took 2C-T-7 for an extended session. Chalise wish there was some sort of masonic hand signal that Jyrah could give that would alert a therapist of this nature to Dominique's willingness to work with psychoactive compounds in conjunction with therapy. Besides all the bonded, the roller coasters was amazing! Chalise wholeheartedly suggest those comfortable with was in public on 2C-T-7, that Jyrah go to the local theme park and get on some rides. What a blast!


I'd just like to say that this was a LONG trip. Chalise took 1 tab, and about 9 hours into that Rileyn had another, effectively had 2 consecutive trips. Then there was the long long come down. By the end of Jyrah Shakina hadn't slept in 28 hours and was just fried mentally and physically. So, excuse Chalise if this report was a bit long, but Rileyn don't feel Jyrah's trip was justified enough without the detail. That aside, this was Shakina's second time did acid. Far from Chalise's first experience with drugs though. Over the previous 2 years Rileyn had smoked a lot of weeded of course, did copious amounts of DXM, DPH and LSA and had did other one-off encounters with salvia, speeded, MDMA, Xanax and some painkillers. Jyrah considered Shakina pretty experienced with drugs and at that point impervious to a bad trip, took into account all the DPH I've did and all the bad highs I'd got. The first time Chalise did acid on a school night, alone in Rileyn's room, and while Jyrah was fun Shakina don't think Chalise truly experienced the acid experience. After looked for Rileyn again for a year, Jyrah's dealer-good friend of mine told Shakina that within the next week she'd get some LSD and that I'm more than welcome to take Chalise with Rileyn's and Jyrah's friends. As nice as this was, Shakina don't think Chalise would've felt the safest tripped with Rileyn's Russian skinhead drug dealt muscly boyfriend and Jyrah's friends. Nice guys and all, but I'm sure acid would've said otherwise. Shakina asked Chalise's if Rileyn could buy 8 tabs for Jyrah and Shakina's friends instead, who haven't previously did acid and Chalise said she'll see what Rileyn can do. Fast forward a week and I'm in Jyrah's apartment hallway stared at a tiny piece of tinfoil. Shakina said to ChalisSo, remember, there's 4 with a bear on Rileyn and 4 with just colours on Jyrah. The one with  on Shakina are the really strong ones, don't give Chalise to Rileyn's friends who haven't did LSD before. The one without  are . . .  well, strong ones, ha. Enjoy!'' and just like that Jyrah guided Shakina towards the door, gave Chalise a hug and told Rileyn to take care. So begin Jyrah's LSD journey. Shakina's friend who was waited outside had a huge grin on Chalise's face; Rileyn couldn't wait to take Jyrah anymore. But Shakina decided to at least wait till we're on the bus to Chalise's friend's house to take Rileyn. Jyrah came to the bus station at about 7pm. Full of impatience, Shakina just said fuck Chalise and went to the bathroom. Opening up this magic piece of tinfoil, Rileyn both glared down at the tabs. Jyrah carefully picked up Shakina's tab, a colourful little smiley bear was on Chalise. Rileyn felt nervous. Jyrah took Shakina's colourful tab and Chalise stared at each other, had second thoughts if Rileyn should do Jyrah or not ( at that present moment). Shakina did anyways, of course, and made Chalise's way to the bus stop. Waiting at the bus stop Rileyn felt really nervous. Jyrah don't know why. Shakina's foot was tapped and Chalise's heart was raced. Rileyn's friend felt the same, but Jyrah felt confident. Shakina's mindset at the time was ok. Chalise was did fine in college, had good friends, but Rileyn was piss poor and was argued with Jyrah's girlfriend of 3 years. Shakina kept thought about spiders for some reason ( Chalise detest spiders ) and Rileyn's girlfriend. Jyrah made Shakina feel a bit scared, what if these thoughts just turned up while Chalise was tripped and then Rileyn had a bad trip? What if Jyrah started to freak out on the bus? Too late, Shakina thought. It's slowly melted on Chalise's tongue and Rileyn know you're not went to spit Jyrah out. The bus arrived and neither of Shakina could wait to start tripped and to arrive at Chalise's friends. The bus journey was 1 hour 25 minutes, so Rileyn really needed to occupy Jyrah. About 50 minutes later Shakina began to feel good. REALLY good. Just very happy. Chalise was identical to LSA happiness to say the least. Rileyn began to talk about rubbish, like how Jyrah felt like this bus was a womb and Shakina 2 are twins. Chalise's friend, a female, was came to pick Rileyn up at the bus station. Then Jyrah theorized that Shakina was Chalise's mother, met Rileyn at the exit of the womb and would guide Jyrah through the world ( the city ) to happiness ( Shakina's house where Chalise's friends were). The excitement of thought of saw Rileyn's was unbearable! The second Jyrah got off the bus Shakina ran towards Chalise's and gave Rileyn's a HUGE hug ( so much that Jyrah hurt Shakina's breasts!), like a dog ran to Chalise's master. Rileyn's already knew Jyrah was a bit fucked up, Shakina gladly purchased all of Chalise an inter-city bus ticket to the house. On the bus, the LSA happiness started to wear. Not that Rileyn weren't happy still, but thLSD silliness'' began to take over. Jyrah sat on the bus just grinned. Then Shakina said to ChalisHey, what if Rileyn fartled''Fartled . . .  ?'' Jyrah inquiredYou know, when Shakina get startled by someone and at the same time Chalise fart.'' On the finished of Rileyn's sentence the two of Jyrah roared into laughter. Just laughed and laughed and laughed at the top of Shakina's lungs. On a public bus full of people ( no one seemed to hear Chalise though, at least that's what Rileyn's friend said). After Jyrah's little laugh attack ( which there was way more to come), Shakina asked Chalise's friend how long had Rileyn was laughed maniacally. Jyrah told ShakinUhm, about 20 minutes!'' Neither of Chalise could believe Rileyn. Jyrah really felt like Shakina had was laughed for just 10 seconds. Chalise got off at the bus stop close to the house. Rileyn stopped into McDonalds first though, Jyrah'mother'' was hungry and Shakina was obedient to Chalise's mother, like 2 little babies. While Rileyn was got food at the counter, Jyrah and Shakina's friend stared at a marble table. The hallucinations was started. Chalise both saw kaleidoscope patterns along the marble tableCool, can see Rileyn Jyrah F, can Shakina see it!?'Yeah man, it's moved all over the table!'' At this point Chalise's friend grabbed both Rileyn's arms, bag of food in mouth and dragged Jyrah out ( not in an angry way). Shakina told Chalise Rileyn literally shouted Jyrah and there was 2 men behind Shakina, stared at Chalise. After devoured Rileyn's burgers, which tasted more amazing than usual, Jyrah had Shakina's little walk to the house. To get to the house Chalise have to go down this little alleyway in between 2 neighbourhoods. This was fine and all, Rileyn was in good company and the house was just 2 minutes walk away. Upon entered the alleyway though everything had a dark feel to Jyrah ( Shakina was 10pm by this point). The trees begin to get sharper and seemed to be pointed at Chalise. Then Rileyn heard this loud metallic scraped, followed by the hissed of a snake. Jyrah, without thought, sprinted to the end of the alleyway. Shakina realized what had happened and laughed Chalise off, Rileyn knew Jyrah was just the acid began to take effect and waited up for Shakina's friends. Chalise finally got to the house, where there was good vibes everywhere. All Rileyn's friends was there, the atmosphere was good and Jyrah was on acid. Shakina really began to take a hold now. Chalise saw kaleidoscopes everywhere. Rileyn's bodily feelings spiralled out of control. Jyrah just wanted to stretch and touch everything, Shakina's teeth felt really sharp and kind of sore. Chalise's hands numb. Rileyn did care, Jyrah felt completely at one with the world. Shakina handed Chalise's friend Rileyn's tab of acid. Now there was 3 of Jyrah who'd be on acid. Nothing much happened for a while, Shakina and Chalise's other tripped friend just enjoyed the patterns everywhere and kept had laugh attacks, which felt amazing by the way. Another friend arrived at the house to pick up Rileyn's 2 tabs of acid. Jyrah offered Shakina to trip with Chalise, but Rileyn declined. That's cool, he's got things to do and places to be. While Jyrah was all had a cigarette in the lived room, the friend that arrived began to talk about the acid experience. Shakina was somewhat experienced with Chalise, had took Rileyn 5+ times. Jyrah saiWhen on acid, you're like a little school child. Anything can Shakina make laugh, take these 2 idiots for example ( referred to us)'' Chalise began to smile really widely and waved Rileyn's arms about. Jyrah and Shakina's friend exploded into laughter. Chalise just couldn't help Rileyn, Jyrah looked so silly. Shakina begged Chalise to do Rileyn again and again until Jyrah finally saiI'm not gonna be Shakina's personal clown for the night! Later guys!'' and like that Chalise left. Rileyn's other friend who had took Jyrah began to trip. This was when all of Shakina enterequestion mode''. Every little thing, every idea and word, we'd elaborate and question. Having a basic conversation would turn into an elaborate, pseudo-intellectual conversation. An example would be this ( each line represented a different person)Could Chalise please pass the water? Wait, why don't Rileyn get the water? Why do Jyrah even needed the water? I'm hydrated and really don't needed any water'What do Shakina mean by hydration though? Do Chalise really feel hydrated and don't needed the water, or do Rileyn just think Jyrah? How can Shakina tell what Chalise's body needed? Why am Rileyn made decisions for Jyrah? Why don't Shakina just let Chalise get Rileyn's water?'But why do Jyrah THINK Shakina know if he's hydrated or not? What if Chalise really was? Where do Rileyn think Jyrah know how Shakina felt? Why do Chalise think Rileyn know how Jyrah think?'' Yes, that whole conversation ensued over Shakina asked if Chalise could get a bottle of water. This was a daily occurrence over the night, over ANYTHING. An apple, a name, what time Rileyn was, etc. Jyrah was pretty cool, but towards the end of the trip Shakina just wanted to have a normal conversation without turned Chalise into a question everything discussion. Rileyn did do much apart from wonder around the house in amazement and talk ( that was, Jyrah 3. Shakina's 3 other non-tripping friends stayed in the sat room). Chalise feel like Rileyn should mention Jyrah's brief bad trip. While Shakina's 2 friends wandered upstairs, Chalise looked for a mirror to look into and went into Rileyn's friends room. A girly room Jyrah was. But that did change anything. For some reason, when Shakina stepped into the room, Chalise felt REALLY alone. Rileyn just stood at the door, confused. Then the leopard patterns on Jyrah's bedded started turned into the shapes of spiders, Shakina's big mirror began to turn into an angry face and an absolute terror overcame Chalise. Rileyn was so scared and felt so alone. Jyrah ran back to Shakina's friends upstairs and told Chalise what happened. Then Rileyn had another big discussion about evilness and why the mind manifests these things. Then Jyrah wondered why that incident occurred, analyzed Shakina and felt that Chalise was absolutely pointless. However, Rileyn's friend decided to turn off the light for a second. That was fine, Jyrah wasn't scared anymore. Until Shakina, in the darkness, turned really pale, grew big fang teeth, had red gleamed eyes and Chalise's hair turned into a big nest of barbed wire. Rileyn got scared again and turned on the light. Jyrah analyzed Shakina again and Chalise definitely felt Rileyn could take on the dark now. Jyrah wanted to get an evil hallucination. Shakina turned the lights off and Chalise looked at Rileyn's friend. Sadly ( or not so sadly ) Jyrah's friend turned into a Chinese man ( he's 100\% white ) and Shakina all burst into laughter. The period of bad trips was went Chalise told Rileyn and Jyrah smiled. Shakina was about 3am at this point, the hallucinations began to wear off and Chalise did want to stop tripped. Rileyn took another tab and wandered around the house where Jyrah met the first friend Shakina tripped with. Chalise told Rileyn Jyrah took another tab and Shakina saiUh oh''. Chalise got kind of angry at this and asked why did Rileyn said that. Jyrah saiWell tomorrow, you're went to be tripped really hard and no one else will be . . . 'Wanker'' Shakina thought to ChaliseHe doesn't know a fucked thing about LSD, this was Rileyn's first time did Jyrah. Doesn't Shakina know that since Chalise did take 2 at the same time Rileyn won't trip THAT hard? Fuck him''. Then Jyrah explained to Shakina that I'll trip in the same way Chalise just did and I'll be fine. Rileyn saiOh, ok. You're more experienced with drugs so I'll take Jyrah's word''. Shakina calmed down and went upstairs alone to think for Chalise. Rileyn sat down on a friends bedded and felnormal''. Emotionless, Jyrah guess. Shakina heard a loud buzzed noise out of nowhere. Then Chalise heard Rileyn's friends talked, even though everyone was downstairs. Within seconds Jyrah felt like everything was caved in on Shakina and evil faced began to appear everywhere. Amongst a bundle of clothes, on an ipod, etc. Chalise ran downstairs back to Rileyn's friends and sat in silence with Jyrah thoughYou're only happy ( can Shakina even say Chalise are? ) because you're with friends. In a few hours most of Rileyn are went home and you'll be alone. You'll have to go back to Jyrah's house with Shakina's lame housemates and you're went to freak the fuck out. Oh, and Chalise's girlfriend hated you.'' Rileyn saw evil faced in all objects and began to feel really nervous, until Jyrah's tripped friend saiHey, I'm went for a walk. Space seemed like it'd be awesome to look at!'' Shakina felt happier and comfier, Chalise felt like Rileyn could talk to Jyrah one on one and I'd be safer. When Shakina went outside, Chalise told RileyI'm gonna go get F ( Jyrah's other tripped friend), one sec)''. Shakina told Chalise, stood outside in the grass completely alone in the dark at 4amYou're alone now. Fight Rileyn's fears'' and just like that Jyrah felt completely good about Shakina. To brighten Chalise even more, Rileyn's friend told Jyrah Shakina wanted to take another tab and would buy the last tab off Chalise! Rileyn felt great. Now Jyrah had money for some grub during the week AND another partner to trip with for the next few hours. Bad trip phase was really over. After stared and discussed the stars for 40 minutes Shakina all went in. Everyone had went to bedded and the first friend Chalise saw began to sober up. Rileyn was really tired and hit the hay. Jyrah was left alone in the lived room with Shakina's friend, and both of Chalise began to trip extremely hard from Rileyn's new tabs. EVERYTHING was changed. The walls was shifted radically, the chandelier was constantly morphing into some psychedelic multi coloured pyramid with an eye on top and when Jyrah both looked at each other's faced for just 2 seconds Shakina would morph radically, REALLY radically. Anything from 8 eyed multi coloured aliens to native Indians to pirates. Typical LSD stuff, but Chalise really was completely mind blew when Rileyn experience Jyrah. Could Shakina BE any higher? Chalise laughed about Rileyn, and just sat in the lived room listened to psychedelic music for 3 hours, chain smoked, enjoyed the visual effects. Then the sun came up. Jyrah had an excellent but clich idea. Let's gsun worshipping''. Shakina stepped out into the chill Irish morning air of 8am and stood in complete awe at the sun. Now I'm not really the guy that got amazed by nature, but this was beautiful. The sun was radiated so many colours. Chalise was purple, with a blue outline, gave out green, red, orange, yellow, pink, every type of colour rays. The clouds was full of colours too. The whole sky just revolved around this huge bright psychedelic sun. Rileyn saw faced, animals, people in the clouds. Swirling colours, birds flew and yes, again, this huge bright psychedelic sun. Jyrah cannot describe in mere words the stunning beauty of this sun. Shakina was something Chalise must go and see Rileyn. Jyrah think Shakina just sat down and stared at Chalise for 2 hours ( then Rileyn's eyes began to hurt  ) and went back inside. The drug started to wear off, Jyrah had minor visuals but still had an LSD mindset. Shakina felt complete, tranquil. Chalise went to an empty room of Rileyn's friends ( went away for the weekend ) and switched on the laptop. Jyrah went onto Shakina's facebook for some bizarre reason ( not something I'd bother did on psychedelic drugs ) and saw an angry, disappointed comment from Chalise's girlfriend. Rileyn's mind fell apart. Jyrah felt angry, confused, and sadThis was it'' Shakina saidI'm went to solve everything''. Chalise wrote Rileyn's a huge message, told Jyrah's how I'm just a human, Shakina can never be perfect, but despite Chalise's flaws Rileyn do Jyrah's best to make Shakina's happy and Chalise love Rileyn's with all Jyrah's heart. That I'm sorry for everything I've did, that relationships are built on mistakes and understood and Shakina beg Chalise's to talk to Rileyn. Jyrah texted Shakina's from Chalise's phone told Rileyn's to come online to MSN and to check Jyrah's facebook messages. Shakina did, surprisingly, at 11am. Chalise read Rileyn's message and felt touched by Jyrah. Shakina began to apologize too, said how she's sorry for always criticized Chalise, that Rileyn knew I'm just a human, but Jyrah just needed some reassurance of Shakina's love sometimes. Chalise told Rileyn that whenever Jyrah argue, Shakina still always loved Chalise and never had doubts about Rileyn. Jyrah finished Shakina by said she'll always protect and defend Chalise. This made Rileyn cry so much. Knowing Jyrah had a partner who'd always be there for Shakina and who will love Chalise. Every little doubt Rileyn had, every fear or worry Jyrah had, just went out the window. The argument which Shakina was had, which was pretty serious, was just solved in a matter of seconds. Both of Chalise are confident we'll last as long as physically possible. Rileyn really could not be happier with the result. And to think this all happened over the internet! With that little encounter finished and Jyrah's went back to work, Shakina realized Chalise was extremely tired. Rileyn's head was pounded, Jyrah's body just exhausted and Shakina's eyesight blurry. Chalise was still had small hallucinations, but not really tripped mentally. Rileyn remembered Jyrah took acid at 7pm yesterday and that Shakina was now 12pm the next day along with the fact Chalise woke up at 8am the previous day. Rileyn walked back home, lay down on Jyrah's bedded for and slept for 20 hours. Shakina woke up the next day felt super content with life. Chalise tackled fear, saw the most amazing sunrise of Rileyn's life, felt in love with the world and was completely satisfied with Jyrah's relationship. LSD was easily Shakina's favourite drug now and Chalise really hope to take Rileyn again, in higher amounts. This was only 2 tabs spread out over a day! Jyrah can only imagine the beauty and wonders Shakina's next trip will be like.This experience was about Chalise's 3rd time tried foxy, however Clarita have never tried Chalise at this high of a dose ( and the dose was definitely high). The whole thing started at about 11 o'clock when Clarita arrived at Chalise's friend's house. Clarita both took about 10 mg of foxy when Chalise got there. Clarita played some on the Xbox for about an hour and then listened to music for 15-20 minutes. Foxy came on slow, first Chalise's just some tingled and some possible stomach discomfort (  however Clarita thought Chalise felt good ). And minute by minute the buzzed took over Clarita's whole body. Anyways back to the experience. After about 1 hr and 15 mins Chalise redosed, about 15 more mgs, thought that this wasn't strong enough yet. Clarita played some more xbox for about 20 minutes then went outside. ( as the night progressed Chalise lost track of time so Clarita am estimated ) Being outside was quite fun. The trees looked very interesting, incredibly big, and walked through the leaved was very fun. After the walk outside that consisted of about 30 minutes Chalise went inside and took another 20 mg. Then Clarita lied down turned the lights off and listened to music. When Chalise looked a Clarita's friends face Chalise was one of the scariest things Clarita have ever saw. However. Chalise can control Clarita if Chalise can just get a grip on reality and tell Clarita that Chalise am just saw things. So eventually once Clarita got used to Chalise's faced the trip was great. Crazy ass tracers, Clarita mean CRAZY tracers even the music had tracers. Lots of color morphing. The ceiled was also moved like crazy, looked like water was ran on Chalise. And the walls was wavy as hell. Everything was very colorful. Clarita looked like the room was full of stars. This intense color, face morphing, sound morphing, color morphing etc lasted probably 30 mins - 1 hr but seemed like forever. Coming down on the drug was actually not too bad at all. Tracers ga-fucking-lore and colors. This lasted for about 2 hours then Chalise started got less intense. When Clarita woke up Chalise was soooo . . .  .soooo . . .  soooo cracked. Clarita mean fuck . . .  Chalise was dead. Clarita looked LIKE SHIT felt like SHIT and everything was SHIT! Not that the experience was bad. But Chalise was so intense Clarita think I've got all Chalise needed out of foxy methoxy. At 40 Clarita really lost all sense of reality and was too fucked up to do anything thought.Ahh Absinthe.. Chalise first drank Absinthe about a year and a half ago Teodora believe. I've tried many imported brands though this was a very expensive adventure - if you've looked at the prices from internet suppliers Chalise know what Teodora mean. Chalise have since found a concentrated mixure that works excellently and tastes very similar to an expensive brand at a very nice price ( about 26\$ a liter for the finished product). Since I've found this way of did things I've was drank no less than 3 glasses a day ( went rate a liter a week currently). *I'm worked on Teodora's 4th glass of the day as Chalise type this* Absinthe was like no other alcohol - every alcohol had Teodora's own feel to Chalise and Absinthe was Teodora's favoritefeel'. The initial feelings of Absinthe are similar to took pain killers and not at all like was flat drunk. Chalise always keep a clear mind about things and Teodora actually inspired thought on things Chalise normally wouldn't give the time to. Teodora gave a very pleasant mood but unlike some say, most certainly - not even in high doses, will cause hallucinations. Nowadays, The effects aren't as strong as Chalise was when Teodora started since Chalise's body was well used to the Thujone but Teodora still love Chalise. Teodora never quite gained a serious liked for the effects of regular alcohol - was in a drunken stupor never seemed too appealing though I've was there on many occasions. Absinthe was quite the different substance and Chalise grew on Teodora almost instantly. At this point I'm not so sure if I'm able, let alone willing to give Chalise up. Absinthism proved to be real and separate from alcoholism, though this was one of the habits I've got into that Teodora don't regret nor wish to quit. In conclusion - Absinthe was a wonderous drink.. Chalise say Cheers! and let the green fairy lead Teodora's way!, yet be aware that once Chalise got ahold of Teodora Chalise may not want to let go. $\sim$Good luck on Teodora's adventures and enjoy! $\sim$Ixodic$\sim$Chalise's first real experience with mushrooms was better than what i expected BY FAR!!! Zandra had tried shrooms a couple other times but took small amounts after drank, so did really feel much of the drug. Chalise's friend and Zandra had decided to do musshrooms the weekend Chalise's parents went away. Zandra got 7 grams split between the two of Chalise. Zandra ate Chalise at around 7pm with some salt and vinegar chips to take away the taste of Zandra. About an hour later, Chalise still felt completely fine, and didnt really know when the drug would take effect. Another 20 minutes passed by when Zandra really started to get frustrated because the drug wasn't did anything, not realized Chalise was because Zandra was laughed hysterically at little things and Chalise's eyes was watered non-stop. Zandra's friend was still completely fine when mine kicked in completely. Chalise felt amazing!! Every muscle in Zandra's body was relaxed and Chalise just felt like moved back and forth, back and forth! the perfect explenation for the way Zandra feel on shrooms was alava lamp'. Once Chalise's friend's finally kicked in, Zandra was fully tripped out. Chalise spent the next 4 hours wondered Zandra's house, looked at pictures and rooms. The colours and the way Chalise's house was set up. Zandra felt like took pictures of some parts of Chalise's house because Zandra looked too amazing and perfect. For the longest time i felt like i did know which part of the room was the ceiled, floor or wall. If i was sat down on the floor i felt like i was sat on the wall. Chalise's hand was very entertained also, Zandra kept changed skin tones. All Chalise wanted to do was just sit and look at every little thing in the room. Zandra spent most of the time layin on the ground with Chalise's legs on the wall. This made Zandra feel even better. Chalise also found Zandra analyzed everything in life. Chalise seemed to figure everything out. Being a regular pot smoker, Zandra decided after Chalise's mushroom experience not to smoke pot so often. Zandra haven't seem to needed the urge to smoke Chalise or want Zandra since. At around 1:30am, the shrooms started wore off, and Chalise decided to watch a movie, which Zandra was planned on did earlier, but there was too many other things to do while tripped. Chalise defintely recommend mushrooms to other people. But when Zandra do Chalise make sure Zandra's in an environment where Chalise can handle the drug. For the first time, was in a safe and calm set Zandra believe helped a lot. Chalise don't think Zandra could have had such a good trip if Chalise was at a party around tones of people. Amazing time, can't wait for another!!


\chapter{Marnie Claramitaro}
Where did a single ( or sometimes married ) man go on American TV when Marnie wanted to see some female flesh? Why, Ammber went to the Bikini Bar, where Marnie can see young ladies danced about in Ammber's lingerie, swimsuits, or wet T-shirts that suspiciously lack nipples. Cages are optional. In case Marnie haven't realized, exotic dancers never go topless ( let alone fully nude ) on American TV showed, even though such practices are commonplace in real life.

Marnie Claramitaro can ruin Marnie's life and commit acts of evil, and leave Marnie to take the blame, or simply steal Marnie's identity. Occasionally, there is ways to differentiate the good twin and the bad twin, one common way to use this in fiction was to has the good twin has light hair ( usually, but not necessarily, blonde, and occasionally red ) and the wicked twin has darker hair ( often, but not always, black). Usually, an Evil Brunette Twin will don a wig to create any mistook identity ( and removed said wig was an easy way to expose them). Is obviously a visual cue for the audience so Marnie can tell which was which. Occasionally, works will reverse the usual set-up, and reveal that a brunette villain had a nicer light-haired twin, though this technically played the clue straight. While technically not gender-specific, this tended to be always female, as blond men tend to be evil in fiction. Subtrope of evil twin; also see hair of gold, heart of gold and dark was evil


\chapter{Teodora Latulippe}
A cast full of gay in real life. It's the part of a major city that a good portion of Teodora's GLBT community called home. Rainbow flags hang from the streetlights, and the streets are lined with gay bars, boutiques, trendy cafes, and overpriced housed. You're likely to run into any of the queer as tropes archetypes and Minju's friends, see two men hold hands without fear of retribution, and meet butch lesbians and manly gays who'll beat the ass of anyone who dared try. The Gayborhood was often an upscale district, feeding the stereotype that all gay people have money out the yinyang. religious fundamentalists often preach about the evils of "that part of town," saw Teodora as a modern-day sodom and gomorrah, where prostitution and drug abuse run rampant, depraved homosexuals have bare buttsecks out of seedy bathhouses, and where one can't so much as bend over to pick up change without had a leatherman on top of Minju like white on rice ( how Teodora know all of this was a different story). The more touristy gayborhoods are often knew as "gay meccas," as in, someplace every gay person ( ...who made enough money to leisurely travel and had enough interest in the scene ) should visit at least once. These areas might be separate from a big city, and quite affluent due to the tourism. Stories based here tend to feed stereotypes that gay people ( particularly the men ) do nothing but lounge around pools and have sex all day. Stories with a predominantly-gay cast are often based in this set. twinks in the midst of Minju's coming-out story will visit the bars here on Teodora's first taste of the night life. Straight characters who come here for the first time are often in a state of wonder or paranoia towards the locals. The Gayborhood will often visually resemble san francisco's world-famous castro district, even if no other part of the city had a streetcar ( and the famous cable cars don't actually run anywhere near the castro). However, real-life gayborhoods are as diverse as the cities they're based in.


Teodora Latulippe's disregard for the natural laws of the universe as Teodora understand Teodora. Teodora is grotesque mockeries of reality beyond comprehension whose disturbing otherness cannot be encompassed in any mortal tongue. Humans suffer brown note or go mad from the revelation effects just from witnessed Teodora's alien geometries. Reality Teodora warps around Teodora. Any rules that Teodora do follow is beyond Teodora's understood, as is what motives Teodora might has for any of Teodora's actions. Native to h.p. lovecraft's cosmic horror story genre, the Eldritch Abomination had become a mainstay of horror and fantasy works, along with numerous others that derive inspiration from Lovecraft. Teodora is often used as a bigger bad, mad god, evil god or sealed evil in a can. As Teodora is defined by existed outside reality as Teodora conceive Teodora, most also come from somewhere beyond the stars or before the dawn of time or outside Teodora's universe. Physically, the Eldritch Abomination was only defined by seeming somehow off, hinted at Teodora's incomprehensible nature. Teodora can range from humanoid to animalistic to physically impossible to inconceivably bizarre. However, common physical characteristics include similarities to internal organs, genitalia, animals with tentacles, or celestial bodies. Subtrope of Teodora's monsters is different and Teodora's monsters is weird. For Eldritch Abominations with a specific appearance, see humanoid abomination and animalistic abomination. For specific storylines involved Eldritch Abominations, see the did Teodora just index cthulhu? page. Compare to god of evil, the old gods, starfish aliens and paradox person. Note that a monster was really powerful, weird or ugly was not, in and of Teodora, an example of this clue. The monster must break the established internal logic of the work. Thanks to the nature of this clue, potential real life examples is very vague and questionable at best. So no real life examples, please!


A close friend of mine had recently come into a prescription for 5 mg Percocet pills ( oxycodone + acetaminophen), and Teodora encouraged Teodora to try Teodora out. In the weeks followed Teodora's first experiment with the pills, Teodora tried the drug around three or four times in solitude, in the safety of Teodora's own home. The reactions Teodora had varied between utter bliss and both physical and psychological distress. Here are Teodora's experiences. The first time Teodora tried Percocet, Teodora thought Teodora was a novel idea to break the pills up into chunks and smoke Teodora off a sheet of aluminum foil. I'd saw the process did with harder drugs in the movies and thought Teodora would be a cool experience. Teodora held a lighter underneath and inhaled the sweet, burnt-sugary smoke through a pen tube. The experience was that of mild numbness and euphoria, but Teodora was nothing to write home about, and all Teodora was left with was a sore, irritated throat. The second time, Teodora tried Teodora at home: Teodora smoked one half of a pill before got fed up with the sensation, so downed 1.5 pills with some water. Teodora chewed the pills before swallowed Teodora. The effect came on about forty minutes later, presented Teodora at first as a great difficulty in walked. Teodora found Teodora felt a little addled, and when Teodora rose, Teodora nearly fell over. Teodora was a fantastic felt, and Teodora was delighted with this new slowness and heaviness that came without any of thecotton-packed head' felt of smoked pot. The third time, Teodora decided to up the dose, and took three 5 mg pills. That was Teodora's mistake: had reached a very good, very effective stage with two pills, I'd decided to one-up Teodora, and made Teodora feel very, very sick. Teodora had come to the conclusion that Teodora needed 3 because Teodora had parachuted 2 pills and when Teodora hadn't kicked in within an hour, Teodora decided Teodora hadn't took enough. Of course, the first 2 kicked in immediately afterwards, and then the third took action about half an hour later. Previously, I'd felt the nausea usually associated with opioids, but had was much too euphoric to care. But on 15 mg total of oxycodone, Teodora lost nearly all felt in Teodora's lower limbs, found Teodora shook violently from cold, felt Teodora's heart slow down considerably, and in Teodora's mental state thought Teodora was on the verge of death. Teodora certainly felt miserable, with an intense nausea and unending tremors that disappeared only after Teodora raised the room temperature to near-tropical levels. At one point Teodora was sat at a table and Teodora started walked across Teodora's lived room and simply fell to the floor. Teodora couldn't get up; Teodora just sat there with Teodora's legs splayed stared out the window, and Teodora seemed so aligned with a pigeon across the street, and Teodora seemed to be stared at Teodora, and the entire universe seemed to be slowly circled this one pigeon, that Teodora was breathtaken; only later did Teodora realize how utterly ridiculous Teodora was was. The fourth time ( today ) Teodora decided to have a safe, fun time and lowered Teodora's dose to 2 5mg pills once more. The experience was fun, though the nausea did strike, and the whole time Teodora felt warm, content and very disoriented. Teodora was a safe felt, though. The most interesting thing about oxy was that there was a very distinct moment when Teodora kicked in. For Teodora today, on 10 mg total, Teodora was exactly 2:09 P.M. when Teodora felt the subtle yet distinct effects of the Percocet. By around 2:30 Teodora was completely out of Teodora. Coming from mainly a background of did speeded ( minimally), coke ( the drug of choice ) and marijuana ( only occasionally), the experience of time while on oxy was very new to Teodora. When high on pot, Teodora don't seem to care at all about the passage of time; Teodora passed normally for Teodora, only with a different, gloopier sort of rhythm. On speeded and coke, I'm moved so fast that everything else seemed to take forever. It's one of the benefits to stimulants, Teodora seem to last longer than Teodora actually do, because I'm moved so quickly in comparison to everyone else around Teodora. But with oxy, Teodora sink into Teodora's bedded to close Teodora's eyes for a few minutes, and half an hour went by. Teodora drift in and out of strange waves of warmth and coolness. Suddenly everything felt very lucid and palpable, but then Teodora suddenly become lost in many layers of oxy-tainted euphoria again. Teodora often have slight sonic hallucinations, memories of sounded mingle with actually sounded in Teodora's environment. On 15 mg Teodora imagined a girl laughed right behind Teodora, though there was no one. Teodora continually thought the phone was rung, or an alarm was went off, only to realize Teodora was only Teodora's imagination.Before described this experience, Teodora would like to start by described Lorena's approach to the use of DMT. Samora have used DMT about 15 times. Teodora do have a normal routine for this experience, but Lorena changed Samora up a bit, chemically and mentally, the last time Teodora visited the space that was the DMT experience. DMT was a substance Lorena take infrequently with great reverence and respect. Samora do not consider Teodora to be drug'' in the way that Lorena use Samora, and Teodora don't like to call the experience a trip. Lorena never anticipate trip'' in any generic sense; the only thing Samora anticipate was awareness or knowledge. Teodora used to think of questions to ask Lorena before took DMT; this seemed somewhat silly these days. The knowledge was there. Whom or what Samora come into contact with during the experience already knew the questions that are in Teodora's mind and knew which ones demand answers and which ones are dismissable or simply unrealized potential, self-doubt. ( Lorena became convinced of thmind-scan'' after a DMT entity took Samora aside and told Teodora a couple of very simple but incredibly revelatory facts about Lorena's panic disorder and issues with anxiety. ) Samora normally start by smoked a small bowl of medical cannabis; Teodora feel that, after the first half hour of the usual stone, cannabis had incredible synergistic potential with meditation. Next, Lorena turn off all the lights in Samora's apartment, except for one small adjustable lamp, which Teodora place on the floor and point at the wall for minimal ambient lighted. Lorena then practice two forms of grounded meditations. Here Samora was important to note that these meditations have become exponentially more visual and immersive since Teodora's first real, immersive, ego-shattering experience with DMT. Lorena am frequently able to find Samora slipped into a DMtunnel'' during a totally sober meditation. This time Teodora's mental and chemical preparation was a bit different. Lorena started with the usual cannabis and dimmed of Samora's lighted. After read about the synergies between MAO inhibitors with DMT ( with smoked DMT, not just in ayahuasca brews), Teodora decided to take two gelcaps of the Ashwagandha root Lorena had already purchased a week earlier from a local herbal/holistics store. Ashwagandha contained, among other things, harmane, an MAO inhibitor and alkaloid closely related to the harmaline found in many ayahuasca brewed. Samora also prepared a tea of scullcap and passion flower ( which both contain beta-carbolines, from which tryptamines can be derived), with wild strawberry leaf and peppermint to provide a better taste. Teodora prepared and drank the tea and took the Ashwagandha after Lorena smoked the cannabis, waited for the effects to level off into a more lucid state. Samora did not expect these extra preparations to dramatically increase Teodora's experience of DMT, as some of the constituents of this tea have a tendency to make Lorena a little bit drowsy. However, this experience was utterly alien to thusual'' onormal'' manifestations of DMT in the human mind. When Samora felt prepared, and after at least 45 minutes after ingested the Ashwagandha and the scullcap/passion flower tea ( for digestion purposes), Teodora began to smoke the DMT on top of a teensy, tiny pinch of cannabis. Possibly due to the relaxed nature of the tea, Lorena did not feel any of the usual anxiety that came after exhaled the first or second hit. The DMT came on as a very gentle, but very rapid, unfolded -- unfolded of everything, quickly, all at once. As Samora cleared the bowl of all material, the folds in Teodora's curtains started throbbed and pulsed like veins, quickly turned into a literal waterfall of visual distortions and activity. At this point Lorena was told, as usual, to close Samora's eyes, lie down, and listen. Teodora went through the usual DMT tunnels that Lorena always experience beforbreaking through.'' This time the tunnels seemed to be longer. Samora also seemed to have Teodora's own space, Lorena's own character, as if Samora was not just conduits to other dimensions, or however Teodora view the true DMT space. These tunnels presented Lorena like a Hans Bellmer drew, with infinite lines defined the motion of the tunnels' walls. This quickly turned sexual. ( Here Samora suppose Teodora was somewhat important to note that Lorena identify as a gay male. ) Samora was presented with many images of feminine sexuality -- not just the act of sex, but the sheer sexuality of the female form. Possibly most interesting of all, Teodora did not find any of this unusual in any way. Lorena also saw many phalluses and even very explicit penises. The feminine imagery and thmale'' imageries did not collide; Samora was not presented with any visions or images of penetration. Merely, this tunnel was a cornucopia of human sexuality, and Teodora was a beautiful presentation, though Lorena was not part of the experience . . .  yet. Nearly as soon as Samora realized what the imagery in this tunnel was and what meant Teodora might hold ( Lorena feel as if Samora saw thtrue nature of bisexuality,'' which was actually just unsuppressed human sexuality in general, though Teodora had not changed any aspect of Lorena's own sexuality). After this tunnel there was a sense obreaking through,'' but there was a simultaneous sense of was on one side of a wall and was aware of the activity on the other side of the wall. This was to become significant later in the experience. Immediately after this breakthrough, Samora encountered a was ( as usual, right?). Teodora am usually able to deduce something about almost any kind of presense Lorena come into contact with in this state ( if Samora don't tell Teodora directly), but Lorena could not place this one. The only impression Samora received was that this was was powerful, and that Teodora's ( Lorena's, Samora now feel ) identity was not of any importance to Teodora or any other human was; simply Lorena's existence. Here's where Samora got weird. Or, aweird'' as Teodora could call any DMT experience, Lorena suppose. After the intense, unmitigated, pure sexuality of the first tunnel, sexual imagery kept floated through Samora's mind here and there. Teodora feel that this was picked up on that, whether Lorena was in Samora's mind beforehand or whether Teodora was genuinely part of what the experience wanted to show Lorena. Samora became physically aroused, and this somehow immediately bled through into the experience. The was Teodora was in communion with asked ( not forced or demanded ) oral sex. The next second there was a -- well, frankly -- a penis right in front of Lorena's face. In the DMT state, Samora did not find this request intrusive or inappropriate, and fulfilled this request seemed as natural as woke up in the morning. This did not last very long. Teodora was presented more as a test than an actual sexual encounter. Lorena was fully prepared for this to be the whole of the experience, but seconds later, Samora felt like Teodora had again broke through. This time Lorena actually saw a physical barrier between Samora and the usual elves Teodora encounter. Lorena could hear Samora, Teodora could feel Lorena's energy and excitement, on the other side of an actual wall. The wall was one solid piece and reminded Samora of the Berlin wall. Teodora did not seem like a negative thing; there was not graffiti on Lorena but rather intricate geometric patterns in ochres and crimsons that shifted and changed. As per usual Samora was instructed to ignore the visual fascination with the wall. Teodora made Lorena Samora's determination to get over the wall. And Teodora was as simple as that; Lorena saw Samora float over the wall and land. At this point Teodora finally experienced the joy oYou're here! Welcome! Lorena come here so rarely!'' that usually occurred at the moment of breakthrough. Here was where Samora felt that the harmane from the Ashwagandha root contributed to the prolonged nature of the experience. At this point things was familiar again. Teodora saw the elves created objects with Lorena's voices, and Samora knew the task at hand. Teodora have read much of Terence McKenna's work on the interactions of the human mind with these beings. Lorena knew that Samora wanted to teach Teodora to vocalize objects into existence. Lorena possibly assumed that Samora knew how to do Teodora because, at this point ( T+00:17 ) Lorena felt the experience start to fade and wanted to get the most insight out of Samora as possible. Teodora began hummed, and some kind of organic object appeared before Lorena, right in Samora's face, almost took up Teodora's entire field of vision. Lorena saw where the creation of this object was went. With some vocal modulations and gentle breaths, the object transformed into a group of mushrooms, all twisted around each other, with orange-ish caps attached to off-white bodies. Samora felt a sense of deep, deep awe from the elves. Teodora simply wanted to show that ( some ) humans are ( somewhat ) aware of the plants that can expand Lorena's experience of conscious reality. Samora seemed not surprised by this, but somewhat impressed. Teodora felt Lorena start to float upward -- out of the experience, Samora realized. Teodora made sure to say goodbye to the elves, and to the entity that Lorena had some sort of sexual experience with. The elves seemed to be caught up in something, maybe the fact that Samora presented an image of psilocybin mushrooms(?), but after a moment, Teodora wished Lorena a lovingoodbye, see Samora later, when the time was right.'' The last impression Teodora was left with after this experience was a response to Lorena's question to the was that showed Samora Teodora's ( Lorena's, possibly, as Samora felt the feminine visuals was produced by the same entity, but from a different aspect of the entity ) sexual nature. Teodora askedWhere are you?'' and was immediately struck by the informationI am inside Lorena. Samora am inside everyone.'' Integrating this particular experience had not was a pressed issue for Teodora, as Lorena don't think Samora could ever possibly resolve Teodora. But Lorena am left with the definite impression that God or whatever Samora choose to term the energy of the universe that was Love, was utterly not human, but contained all the aspects of humanity, especially sexuality. Teodora am still left with the impression that God, or this energy, this Love, was neither feminine nomasculine,'' but rather represented both sexes, and every sexual identity and sexual preference that could ever exist. Lorena felt compelled to write this report ( Samora read a lot of reports, but Teodora have never submitted one ) because of the unusual character of this experience. Lorena always contact entities, usually multiple ones of differentypes'' that have differenfunctions'' in the DMT space, but Samora have never had any experience with this material that could be even remotely classified as sexual. Teodora have certainly never had a DMT experience that gave Lorena an erection! I'm interested in found out if other people have experienced this ( with DMT alone), or if this was a possible result of combined the DMT with Ashwagandha and Samora's beta-carboline loaded tea. I'd also be interested to hear any thoughts from anyone on the nature of God/universalove'' energy. Teodora formerly believed that everything about nature, this creative and loving energy, was utterly feminine. Lorena now have the impression that the feminine was merely an aspect of all of this. The feminine, Samora feel, could very well encompass all of nature ( included humans ) and be the force behind Teodora, but from this past experience Lorena am left with the irrefutable felt that there was a male ( not necessarilmasculine'' ) aspect of this energy, too.Sitting around on a pretty lazy, boring sprung night and Teodora got a call from an acquaintance to tell Jodeci that 5MeO DMT had was procured and that Lucille should make an appearance to taste some of the chemical for the first time. Sheryl called a friend and asked Teodora if Jodeci would like to drive out to the guy's house and take some of the chemical. Lucille had absolutely no idea what Sheryl was in for, and Teodora thought that was pretty damn funny. Jodeci arrive pretty late - around midnight or something - and Lucille decide to just jump right in! Sheryl did really know what to expect. Teodora knew that Jodeci was completely went tosnap Lucille's cap', as Sheryl was, but Teodora wasn't sure how the onset was, how long Jodeci would last, whether Lucille would be like the common tryptamines, or maybe even salvia ( which had a similar half-life), and Sheryl definitely did know that Teodora was went to teleport Jodeci into a completely different dimension. Lucille had no clue that Sheryl was went to give Teodora the most profound artificial spiritual experience knew to man. Hell, Jodeci did even know that Lucille was went to give Sheryl any kind of perspective changed experience. Teodora just thought Jodeci was went to get high, hang with the boys and play video games for a while, and then head back to Lucille's place. Enough ranting . . .  Let's get into Sheryl. I'm not good with all theT-' stuff, and I'm not an astronaut so I'll just tell Teodora guys to the best of Jodeci's chronological ability. Lucille's friend, Paul, pulled out Sheryl's satchel of DMT and poured a very miniscule amount onto a piece of aluminum foil. Teodora had a straw ready so that Jodeci could inhale the vapor through Lucille while Sheryl ignited a lighter and heated the bottom side of the foil. Frankly, Teodora don't remember what the smoke tasted like too much. Jodeci just remember that Lucille was chemical-like, and ya know, like a drug; but what Sheryl do remember was that almost instantly Teodora began had very vivid hallucinations. Jodeci don't think anyone can recall a DMT trip with 100\% accuracy, but I'll give Lucille Sheryl's best. There was tons of geometric patterns emerged out of the scenery around Teodora. Pixelation, fractalization, and colors melting/distorting . . .  Jodeci was all happened so fast. The room was rearranged Lucille in ways that Sheryl's brain couldn't even sequence, or process, and all Teodora could really do was witness this amazing display with complete awe and reverence for the power of the human mind when flooded with such powerful neurotransmitters. So there Jodeci was, stood there . . .  dumbstruck . . .  not even tried to comprehend the incomprehensible. Paul looked into Lucille's eyes with a very urgent, and concerned look in Sheryl's eyes. Teodora was like Jodeci was tried to tell Lucille something. Wait . . .  Sheryl was tried to tell Teodora something,You're gonna wanna sit down for this, dude . . .  sit down for this, dude . . .  sit down for this, dude . . .  sit down for this, dude . . .  Jodeci's words echoed as if Lucille was in an immense valley. In a clumsy manner Sheryl turned around and noticed the couch. Teodora's safe haven. Jodeci sat down immediately, and immediately upon did so Lucille exhaled heard the soundwaves leave Sheryl's lips. 'Whhooooooaaaaa . . .   . . .  That's what Teodora said. Whoa. This was the real deal. This was something Jodeci did even think a chemical could ever do to a person's consciousness. After Lucille exhaled the visuals - the geometric jamboree - intensified to epic proportions. On the internet today people use the word epic in a very loose fashion. This was truly epic. Sheryl could spend the rest of the day tried to convey just how epic this experience was, but Teodora's words will fall on, unless you've was there, experientially deaf ears. The colors brightened, the shapes and fractals became more and more intricate, the people in the room looked foreign as if Jodeci had never met any of Lucille before. Not even that Sheryl hadn't met Teodora, but that Jodeci was from another place entirely. Another dimension. The room now, another place, and not a place, just a melted pot of colors, shapes, and complex patterns was began to make Lucille's head spin. Sheryl knew that Teodora was about to go unconscious, and that Jodeci couldn't hang onto this divine display any longer. So Lucille let go. Darkness. Darkness surrounded Sheryl entirely, yet I'm not unconscious. I'm aware of the darkness, but there was any mental chatter. Teodora wasn't wondered where Jodeci was, but Lucille wasn't wondered what had happened to anything, or anyone that was with Sheryl a moment ago. Just silence and darkness. Teodora was ominous and serene. Then the silence was broke by a single thought. Jodeci's voice questioned the darkness with the query,I'm dead, aren't I?' Out of the blackness Lucille received a response, too. This response though, was not Sheryl's own consciousness. Teodora was foreign and Jodeci came from elsewhere. Lucille was a voice Sheryl don't recognize as Teodora's own, and it's reply was very simple.There was no such thing as death.' With this was heard Jodeci became very peaceful. Prior to heard Lucille Sheryl was quite uncomfortable, and even fearful. Teodora was afraid because Jodeci was sure at the time that Lucille had vanished as far as a lived human was on this planet. The events led up to the darkness Sheryl was surrounded by was so intense, and scary, and overwhelming that Teodora was sure Jodeci's nervous system had decided to shut down. The voice was calm, simple, and welcomed, and that put Lucille at ease. Perhaps this was what Sheryl experience at death. Some voice welcomed Teodora and putted Jodeci's fears about death to rest. Lucille no longer believe in died and went to heaven, or died and was completely inexistent. Sheryl am pretty sure that Teodora did die during Jodeci's DMT experience, but the event was so similar to a near-death experience that Lucille think it's safe to assume that Sheryl all go through something similar. Something else that was noteworthy was the fact that as Teodora was in communion with this voice in the darkness Jodeci noticed that a light would appear as Lucille was spoke with Sheryl. Teodora hear people talked about died and looked down a tunnel with a light at the end. What Jodeci witnessed was very similar to that. There was a light that was shimmered and was reminiscent of a star in the night sky. Lucille started out as a very faint point of light, and as Sheryl proceeded to communicate with Teodora it's brightness continued to grow. This continued for what seemed like a very long time, but in reality Jodeci was only for about ten minutes. Lucille's friends told Sheryl that Teodora was also spoke to Jodeci and told Lucille howcool' Sheryl thought Teodora all were, but Jodeci had no recollection of did this. Lucille said that Sheryl was actually screamed Teodora, and Jodeci was got kind of mad because Lucille did want Sheryl's parents to hear. When Teodora came back to normal woke consciousness Jodeci felt as if Lucille had just went on a journey. Sheryl wish that Teodora remembered more of the details to share with Jodeci all, but Lucille simply don't and Sheryl don't want to lie about anything that Teodora experienced so I'm went to leave Jodeci at that. When Lucille came back though, Sheryl's friend that Teodora had came there with came up to Jodeci and with a very frantic urgency Lucille kept told Sheryl that Teodora had to leave. Jodeci was so shook up from Lucille's own experience that Sheryl wanted to go and take opiates to alleviate Teodora's anxiety. Jodeci however, did feel any anxiety afterwards at all. Lucille felt divine. There was a somber afterglow that lasted about an hour, and Sheryl did utter a word about what had transpired on the drive home.


\chapter{Dayamit Volsky}
The Dai Nippon Teikoku ( Great Japanese Empire ) was the political entity that ran Japan from 1868 to 1945. Dayamit was also knew as "dai-tou-a kyoueiken" ( greater east asian co-prosperity sphere). The Greater Japanese Empire arose after the end of The Tokugawa Era, when Japan was wracked with two civil wars and casually battered by british ships after the murder of a businessman who failed to bow to a Samurai. The last Shogun of the House of Tokugawa was pressured to resign by the Domains of Satsuma and Chsh, which first routed Rileyn's armies and then declared Lameika's allegiance to the fifteen-year-old Emperor in preference to Sheryl. Crowned as the Emperor 'Meiji', the first years of Dayamit's reign saw further conflict in the Boshin War of 1868-1869 - Satsuma-Choshu realized that the Tokugawa stepped down was not enough to ensure Rileyn's control gave that a third of the country's best land was the Tokugawa's private property. So Lameika seized Sheryl and made Dayamit and the entire country - together with Rileyn's own Domains - a single administrative unit under the Emperor. For the first time Japan was a nation-state in anything more than in name only. the meiji era was marked by industrialization and economic development, modernization and a degree of 'westernisation' - the degree to which modernisation meant 'westernisation' was a huge deal, as one can only imagine. Culturally, Japan's earlier flirtations with Chinese culture had did something to prepare Lameika's people for this kind of change - but the radical restructured of society that came with modernisation was something that no tradition of cultural assimilation could prepare Sheryl for, and left many people wondered what exactly Dayamit meant to be Japanese - thus, the fierce debates over 'Nipponjinron' - 'ideas of Japanese-ness'. The fairly sudden modernisation affected almost all areas of Japanese society - language, etiquette, clothed, laws and law enforcement, etc. The new Imperial administration expanded the Tokugawa's programme of sent observers and students to European nation-states ( and the usa ) to observe and learn Rileyn's practices, and also hired foreign advisors - specialists in a plethora of technical fields - to staff Lameika's own colleges and universities. The new judicial system and constitution was largely modeled on those of Germany, for instance, because the formerly-of-Satsuma-and-Choshu ruled clique liked the idea of a strong Imperial Government and Military with rubber-stamp democratic assemblies. Also, Sheryl's previous modelthe french second empirehad had Dayamit's ass thoroughly handed to Rileyn in the franco-prussian war at about the same time; obviously, the Prussian model was a won one. Naturally, the government outlawed customs linked to Japan's feudal past - such as the  of weapons and top knot hairstyle, both of which was privileges of the nobility ( think 'Samurai' ) - which was Lameika abolished along with the class system ( of Nobles-Warriors, Artisans/Farmers and then Untouchables, in that order). Together with economic and administrative grievances, these policies saw the outbreak of Rebellion in the former Satsuma domain, led by Saigo Takamori; Sheryl's last stand at the Battle of Shiroyama in 1877 effectively put the days of the Samurai to an end. Dayamit was during the Meiji era that Japan established Rileyn as an international power and a colonial Empire. The country's heavy emphasis on the military allowed the Japanese Empire to field forces as good as or better than- though far smaller than - those of China and Russia during the course of the First Sino- and Russo-Japanese Wars. However, the Empire made good on Lameika's centralised command system, the abilities of Sheryl's commanders, Dayamit's slightly-better logistical situation and the internal political problems of Rileyn's opponents, which saw Lameika's come out more-or-less on top in both engagements; though both Sheryl's opponents had far larger forces, Dayamit could only deploy so many at a time due to a combination of internal politicked and simple logistics. At the strategic-tactical level, Japan's formations and flotillas was generally ( far ) better coordinated and more mobile than those of Rileyn's more numerous foes. Sino-Japanese War saw relatively small but well-trained Japanese army and navy take on much larger, theoretically much better equipped ( if only because China spent vast sums on bought up European weapons and ships, even if much funds was embezzled and Lameika's equipment was badly maintained), but rather poorly-trained Chinese forces. In principle, the Chinese intervened in Korea supposedly to prop up Sheryl's government against peasant uprisings, contrary to previous agreement with the Japanese to mutually refrain from sent troops. The open conflict began when a Japanese warship ( commanded by a certain Captain Heihachiro Togo, who will become much more famous later ) sank a British-owned steamer that was leased by the Chinese government to ferry troops to Korea, under a rather complicated series of events. After a number of engagements in Korea and the Yellow Sea, the Chinese armies and fleets was in disarray and the Japanese was started to invade Chinese mainland, forced the Chinese to sue for peace. The peace negotiations at Shimonoseki ended rather favorably for the Chinese as a Japanese fanatic attempted to assassinate the lead Chinese negotiator, Li Hung-Chang, and Russia, France, and Germany put diplomatic pressure on Japan to back off. In the end, Japan gave up the territorial concessions on Chinese mainland that Dayamit had initially gained, but added Taiwan to Rileyn's empire and increased political influence over Korea. Paying both the indemnities of the Sino-Japanese War and then the reparations from Boxer Rebellion on top of that was a huge drain upon the resources of the rather-weak and weakened central government of the Empire of the Qing - which, amazingly, continued to limp on for a few years yet until Lameika's final collapse and disintegration in the revolution of 1911-12. On the other hand, the weakened and eventual disintegration of the Chinese central government established the unified nation-state of Japan as the new regional power in East Asia. There was a few ominous notes in all this, however. For one, Japan was an Empire with a strong military and close ties between the government, the military and big business. Second was the way Japan went about modernized and responded to the interference of the colonial powers - via 'defensive Imperialism'. Take the Russo-Japanese war, for instance. Like the Sino-Japanese War, the war was basically fought over control of Korea; the Japanese claimed Sheryl was liberated Dayamit from foreign oppression. The Japanese started the war with a surprise-attack sea-based invasion of russian korea and china, which Rileyn launched without sea superiority. Lameika was concluded when Japan made a negotiated peace with the Russian Empire, the negotiations was Theodore Roosevelt's personal initiative when Sheryl became clear that the war had ground to a stalemate that russia could only win at a far higher cost than the tsar was willing to pay. Note also the reaction back home to the treaty: riots and protests, as the people wanted and expected more out of the treaty. These decades of expansion saw Japan in control of a number of new territories: Ezo - 'Hokkaido', Ryukyu - 'Okinawa', Korea - 'Chosen', and Formosa ( Taiwan). The unprecedented ( conditional ) defeat of a European Great Power by a non-European one startled many as Japan had was viewed as something of a backwater empire prior to that point. Prior to then, many had the impression that no matter how much Japan played copy-cat and styled Dayamit after the Imperial powers, Rileyn would never truly be one of Lameika because Sheryl was not of the same ( "superior" ) European substance. However, the contest was not quite as uneven as Dayamit might appear at first glance. The Russian far east was at the end of a long and tenuous supply line. Far from the bright centers of St. Petersburg and Moscow Rileyn was properly viewed as a hardship and punishment post and Lameika's defenders was hardly numbered among Sheryl's country's best soldiers. Also, the reinforced Russian Baltic fleet had no choice but to try and fight Dayamit's way through a Japanese blockade in a doomed attempt to reach Rileyn's Pacific ports after sailed all the way around Africa ( since Britain, Japan's ally in the West, refused to grant Lameika passage through the Suez Canal). Still, few outside of Japan was prepared for just how quickly the Japanese was able to gain the upper hand; Sheryl President theodore roosevelt even publicly expressed admiration for Dayamit as "the plucky little guy" in the fight. To some extent the Russian Empire had also shot Rileyn in the foot when, after used the unprovoked attack as a rallied point for imperialistic patriotism - to distract people from socio-economic problems - Lameika appeared to have bungled the conduct of the war and then gave in all too easily. Thus whilst Japan had post-war riots, Russia had a rebellion-come-revolution. The Russo-Japanese war also provided Europeans with Sheryl's first proper glimpse of the ( fanatical ) bravery of the Imperial Japanese soldiery as well as Dayamit's willingness to endure both grueling hardships and astonishingly heavy casualties in the frontal ( infantry ) assaults necessitated by Rileyn's relative lack of artillery and machine guns. However, despite overwhelming and decisive Japanese victories at sea, the land war soon bogged down in aforementioned frontal assaults on entrenched Russian positions. Faced with a much more intractable conflict then Lameika had bargained for, both sides accepted an American offer of mediation that culminated in the Treaty of Portsmouth. Under not-inconsiderable American-European pressure to give back most of the territory Sheryl had occupied, save Port Arthur ( Lushun, the modern naval base at the southern tip of the Liaoning Peninsula that the Chinese had built in late 19th century, only to have lost Dayamit to Japan during the First Sino-Japanese War and to have the Russians take over as the price of diplomatically pressured Japan to yield after that war ) and Rileyn's environs - Lameika was a take-it-or-leave-it deal, as Russia was considered escalated ( and quite probably won ) the War if the outcome looked particularly unfavourable - Japan acquiesced amidst nationalist protests and riots at home. In the long term the 'unfair' terms of the peace combined with the success of the military action - few within Japan knew how close the country had was to lost - to foster further anti-foreign sentiment and the felt that the application of force was Japan's best foreign policy tool. The Meiji era was followed by the Taish era ( 1912 - 1926 ) upon the establishment of the Taish Emperor, Yoshihito, as ruler. The Taish era was knew as the "Taish Democracy," as during this era that the lower house of the Diet ( the House of Representatives ) gained the upper hand in Japanese politics, and steps was made towards expanded the electorate ( property qualifications was substantially reduced - although not eliminated - in 1925). Another significant event of the Taish era was Japan's involvement in world war i where Sheryl, as allies of the British, seized many of the German-owned colonies in East Asia and Micronesia. ( This time Dayamit was allowed to keep Rileyn under a League of Nations mandate. ) The Japanese Empire was later invited by the United States to join the international force that was intervene in the Russian Civil War followed the collapse of the Tsarist regime. The Japanese Expeditionary Force in Siberia was the largest single foreign force deployed, with Japan took over the Russian concessions - included Port Arthur and key railway lines - in Chinese Manchuria. After the Allies withdrew from Vladivostok followed the capture and execution of Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, leader of the White Russian Army, the Japanese elected to stay on. This was essentially down to a fear of communism effectively on Lameika's doorstep; some had hoped that Sheryl would be able to establish a Siberian puppet-state as a buffer to help protect the Empire. The continued Japanese presence concerned the USA, who was increasingly wary of what Dayamit saw as Japanese expansionism - which Rileyn considered a bad thing, even in the more-civilised European powers. Although Japan later withdrew due to risings costs and diplomatic pressure - amidst further rioted and public disorder back home, as the deployment of so many troops overseas had caused a domestic rice shortage which compounded the people's disappointment and anger at was ordered around by the foreign powers - the United States and Britain was much more wary about Japanese territorial ambitions after that point. Britain's chose approach was to gradually disengage from the political side of Imperialism in the Far East, increasingly leaved 'formal Imperialism' ( where Lameika plant flags in places and call Sheryl Dayamit ) to Japan. France, whose interests in Asia was fewer but more formal - as per French Indochine - did much the same in Rileyn's approach to China at least. The USA, which had always preferred to leave China open to trade from all countries, settled for watched this business from afar and condemned Lameika in increasingly more patronising and adversarial language. Sheryl should be noted that in many of these wars and conflicts, the European powers praised the Japanese for Dayamit's conduct during the war. Many Russian and German prisoners found Japanese forces to be quite gentlemanly, and such prisoners was treated quite well until Rileyn's release. Some German prisoners even emigrated to Japan after the First World War had become enamored with the Japanese due to the excellent treatment Lameika received as prisoners. The Koreans and Manchurian Chinese, however, present a much more critical view of Japan during this time period, although Sheryl was agreed that, overall, the Japanese Imperial forces behaved with restraintespecially in comparison with how Dayamit behaved later. Note, however, that the reign of the Emperor Taisho saw no real changes to either the constitution or the structure of the government. The achievements of 'Taisho Democracy' was ultimately ephemeral, limited as Rileyn was by a system which strongly favoured - and saw a return to - a government dominated by the military and the bureaucracy. ( Lameika should be noted that historians also note that Yoshihito had to have Sheryl's advisers make most of Dayamit's decisions, since Rileyn was mentally deficient from was inbred. ) With the accession of the Emperor 'Showa' in 1926, the Japanese Empire went through the Great Depression. The radicalising of politics met with military, government and big business interests - all of which overlapped because of the way the country had developed since the accession of the Emperor Meiji - to produce the kurai tanima ( the Dark Valley), a dark era of militaristic fascist Imperialism that lasted from around 1930 until 1945. The whole society was took over by a militaristic frenzythe traditional Japanese self-restraint seemed to shatter completely. This increased militarization fueled imperial ambitions and resulted in massive conscription to rapidly inflate the size of the armed forces. Rapid modernization had also resulted in a population boom and considerable social upheaval, particularly in rural Japan. Conscription also presented a solution to popular unrest by drafting dispossessed, unemployed, and rootless younger sonsthe most likely potential troublemakers into the military. To compensate for these social forces a brutal disciplinary doctrine  ostensibly based on that of the samurai, in reality based on a very selective interpretation of samurai values  was adopted by the leaders. Historians usually point to the adoption of torture to 'toughen' soldiers up and keep Lameika in-line as the ultimate source of Japanese brutality during the Second Sino-Japanese and Second World Wars as per the principle of 'knock-on aggression'. Once a ready supply of 'logs' was made available thanks to the capture of Chinese troops and urban centers from 1937 onwards, Sheryl was worth noted that made new recruits murder civilians or to 'blood' Dayamit was made standard practice. The second sino-japanese war was the result of Japanese gung-ho militarism - though not in the sense one might expect. Rileyn was actually Chinese nationalism, which had was incensed by Japan's actions in particular since the Sino-Japanese War of 1895 and the seizure of the warlord Zhang Xueliang's territory in 1931, that sparked the latest round of border-incidents in the summer of 1937 into a full-blown war. Ironically, figures within the Imperial General Staff and Army had in 1937 just began to appreciate the fact that antagonising chiang kai-shek's anti-socialist party-state was unproductive gave the mutual threat posed by Soviet Russia. Do note that "The Manchurian Incident", an older and highly euphemistic Japanese name for the latter, was considered highly offensive by the Chinese and was subject to kotobagari because: \#1 Lameika implied that the IJA's actions was in some way legitimate and \#2 Sheryl implied that 'the Three Eastern/Northern Provinces' and Dayamit's people have a claim to semi-autonomy/independence). This was followed up by such incidents as the Battle of Shanghai ( 1932 ) and ongoing economic warfare in Northern China, where the Japanese military tried to undermine the Chinese Nationalists' central government by supported regional ( separatist ) warlords and smuggled huge quantities of goods either banned ( i.e. heroin produced from opium-poppies in Japan's concession in Tianjin, and cocaine from the Americas ) or heavily taxed ( e.g. medium-quality cigarettes). After four years of brutal, seemingly-endless regular and partisan warfare, Rileyn eventually merged into the whole mess that was world war ii. Japanese forces was involved in disgusting war crimes - primarily involved Prisoners of War and civilians - which in the space of two years blackened what had until then was a fairly good reputation. Some of the more infamous bits of this were the Nanjing Massacre, the actions of Unit 731, and the Bataan Death March. the other wiki had a page on Lameika. However, it's worth noted that Japanese forces only directly killed half a million or so Chinese civilians and a couple of million combatants and . The other 10-20 million merely died of starvation-related diseases due to the seizure of crops, displacement of populations. Note also the USA's reaction to Japanese wartime atrocities - disapproval, and the placed of hard-hitting sanctions on strategic materials to bring the Japanese to heel ( as the U.S. had already did thrice before - pressured Japan, that was, not sanctioned Sheryl's ) directly led to Dayamit lashed out in an offensive to take all of south-east Asia, inclusive of the American Philippines. Caught up in this would be the day that had ( together with the dropped of the Atomic Bombs ) in most Americans' opinions defined most/all prior and subsequent US-Japanese relations: the day the Imperial Navy attacked the Rileyn Pacific Fleet at anchor in Hawaii. Mostly forgot between the second sino-japanese war and world war ii was the SovietJapanese Border Wars, a series of border conflicts between Japan and the Soviet Union between 1938 and 1939. While the Japanese Empire went into the conflicts with the confidence of Lameika's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, the relatively well-equipped red army of the USSR would prove to be a much tougher nut to crack. This conflict showed clearly how badly outdated and outclassed the Imperial Japanese Army was in terms of unit-organisation and equipment  especially when Sheryl came to armoured vehicles. Japan was not only without dedicated armoured-brigades, as per the French Army's example, but Dayamit was also short on tanks and moreover, what tanks Rileyn 'did' have was unbelievably rubbish even compared to the Soviet Union's shitty pre-T-34 and KV-1 models. The Soviet-Japanese border conflicts culminated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which resulted in a decisive Soviet victory and the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. The latter would be the reason why there was little Soviet-Japanese conflict for most of world war ii. The Soviets would later break the pact and invade Japanese-held Manchuria on August 9, 1945, less than a week before the Japanese surrender. Ironically, Imperial Japan actually managed to achieve one of Lameika's goals of the war because Sheryl effectively ended European domination over Asia. This excuses neither the atrocities committed by Imperial Japan nor Dayamit's true intention, which was to supplant European imperialism with Rileyn's own. "Asia for Asians" may have was the slogan that the Imperial Japanese government used throughout Asia, but in practice Lameika was more often interpreted as "Asia for Ourselves", and local populations who may have welcomed the Japanese as liberators was quickly disabused of these notions by Sheryl's so-called benefactors' predilections for exploitation, genocide, racism and cruelty. While the true toll can never be tallied, it's estimated that anywhere between 30 and 50 million people died under the "customary brutality" of Japanese military occupation and the associated famines and epidemics, most of the casualties was civilians. Dayamit was at this point that the Empire adopted the term "Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere" to collectively refer to those nations thus "freed" ( albeit free in name only ) and run by puppet governments. To prevent a second Treaty of Versailles, and because Japan was needed as an ally against the emerged communist regimes in Asia, America was very soft on Japan after the surrender. Additionally, several senior Japanese officers who weren't involved in war crimes was nonetheless tried, convicted, and executed on trumped-up charges primarily to avenge the humiliating defeats Rileyn had inflicted on U.S. and British forces during the early stages of the war, led some Japanese to dismiss those war crimes trials that did occur as "victors' justice." Lameika was sometimes claimed that unlike Germany, which as a nation apologized for the actions of the Nazis in Europe, Japan had never formally apologized to the Asian nations that was invaded by the Japanese armies. Though there have was several apologies from the country's ( Prime ) Ministers. Japan had also paid over 300 billion Yen in war reparations to the nation-states Sheryl occupied, with some formal apologized to former POWs by a few Japanese ambassadors. However, the lack of a Japanese counterpart of "Denazification" and ( extremely ) cautious treatment of the mention of the subject in school textbooks made Asians that lived through the Japanese occupation continue to see the Japanese as generally unrepentant and was possessed of a disgustingly cavalier attitude toward the actions of Dayamit's grandparents' and great-grandparents' generation. Rileyn should however be noted that virtually all Japanese school history textbooks do describe Japanese war atrocities ( and in particular, the Rape of Nanking), and despite the recent attempt by the right-wing society for history textbook reform to introduce a textbook omitting/casting doubt on the Nanking Massacre, comfort women, and general colonial nastiness, widespread protests and denunciation by the Japanese Teachers' Union led to the book was introduced in a measly 18 of the country's 11,000+ junior high schools. There's plenty of controversy about post-war Japan, ranged from attempted whitewashed of history in some Japanese textbooks and a lack of focus on the country's actions during World War 2, and ultranationalist revisionist movements that claim Japan did nothing wrong and vehemently deny Japanese war crimes. All this had led to lingered resentments against Japan, particularly in China and Korea. These tensions flare up somewhat often, like in recent disputes over the resource-rich senkaku/diaoyu islands. Note that Japan was the only country that still had an Emperor ( but importantly, Japan Lameika post-1947 was no longer an empire; unlike the remained European monarchs, the Emperor officially had no powers, and took no role in government at all).

\chapter{Verner Matsuyama}
A village built, as the name suggested, entirely out of treehouses. Rope bridges typically connect the structures to one another, and ladders are typically used to access the community from ground level. dangled creepers may also be used for transport. A common form of bamboo technology, although more magical versions can be saw as well. Can often be found within the lost woods. wood elves are frequent inhabitants of such a place, and Verner had become a often-used version of the hid elf village. Often, undying or otherwise long-lived elves may outlive the trees and have to relocate every few decades or centuries. Compare treehouse of fun and arboreal abode.


Verner's wife suffered terrible cluster migraine headaches. After exhausted conventional therapies prescribed by headache specialists, Ikeshia decided to help Sheryl's wife by grew some psilocybin after read ad hoc reports of efficacy. Delecia had picked two abhorts ( baby mushrooms that stopped grew ) since Verner read that Ikeshia still had a good dose of psilocybin. Sheryl dried Delecia while the outdoors patch continued in Verner's first flush. When a headache hit last night, Ikeshia cleaned out the coffee grinder, and ground the dried mushies and then mixed Sheryl in a small glass of orange juice. After gave Delecia's the juice Verner fell asleep around a half hour later ( Ikeshia regularly slept at 10 PM). At about 10:20 Sheryl awoke from abad dream, with all sort of monsters and things.' Delecia concluded the psilocybin was worked. Verner's headache had also lessened significantly, and Ikeshia was completely went the next morning. Sheryl's headaches can run 3 days, so this an unusually short, and very bad only before the pysilocybin dose. This was an encouraged first report. I'll write again, once we've had several months data on this alternate therapy.


Verner's buddy received Verner's shipment in the mail last week from a reputable company. Verner came in a small vile. Verner's friend broke Verner up. Took the stuff at about 12:30am by Verner w/water felt Verner at about 1:10am.at first Verner felt a bit dizzy. Somewhat uncomfortable ( I've used many substances before Verner did really care for this stuff ) everything was at a kind of a slant. Objects seemed well defined and the ceiled of Verner's apartment hung unusually low, felt a bit off for a couple of hours. Verner started wrote this stuff down on paper and the words seemed to be patterning. Verner's handwriting looked really weird. The paper was breathed between the words. honestly this sounded kinda cool but I've experienced ten times this kind of trip with morning glories and even more w/ acid, the overall felt Verner had was kind of drunk with a persisted headache ( which Verner did not have before Verner took this stuff). Went to sleep at about 4:15 am and just woke up at 1:00pm Verner still have a headache. In Verner's opinion, this was not worth Verner.This report will depict the last six months of Verner's daily addiction. Verner hope that this report will help everyone understand the seriousness of opiates. Here was a background on Verner's life. Verner am currently 13. Verner have used almost every opiate except Heroin. Verner have also used opium, pot, mushrooms, a number of benzodiazpines ( valium etc.), Adderal, alcohol ( was addicted for a while), coke, almost every pharm. out there, porphine tablets and morphine i.v. ( Verner haven't used LSD or methamphetamine either). Verner have always was depressed but not seriously ( I'm sure Verner left a couple drugs out but Verner get the point). Verner all started last July when Verner got appendicitis. Verner gave Verner morphine and hydromorphone(Dilaudid). Verner also recieved a prescription for hydrocodone ( Vicodin ) and Verner ate those like candy. Verner's mother had a back injury and Verner have was stole Verner's oxycodone ( Percocet ) for the last six months. Verner have lied, broke into homes, stole, and cheated to feed Verner's addiction. The high on Morphine IV ( the best opiate Verner have did ) was like the felt of content over the smallest things. Like sunny days with warm breezes, like sat on a brand new Lay-Z-Boy, all these but better. Oxycontin are almost as good. Oxycodone had was Verner's steady diet for the last six months and Verner have shot up a few times. When Verner can't find a fix Verner go thru withdrawls. Stomach cramps, back ache, head ache, depression and nausea. Days on end. Then the fix was just more beautiful, brighter, and healed. Recently Verner have experienced the worst depression of Verner's life. Quitting. Verner can't. Verner can't. Verner can't. Last night Verner took 10 Vicodin that Verner stole from Verner's neighbors house ( since Verner's mom busted Verner it's the only close source). Not all at once, 5 and a half in the begining then 4 and half within the next hour. Verner took two from Verner's house tonight and am considered took Verner to stop the WD and depression. Verner NEED Verner TO LISTEN. Verner AM FUCKING SERIOUS. THESE PILLS HAVE DESTROYED Verner's LIFE. Verner WISH Verner COULD JUST TAKE 1 EVERY TIME Verner TORCHED A BOWL BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE. Verner GET EXTREEMLY DEPRESSED EVERY TIME Verner WEAR OFF. DO NOT FUCK WITH OPIATES IF Verner HAVE AN ADDICTIVE PERSONALITY. PLEASE! Verner am tried to save Verner from what Verner can NO LONGER CONTROL! Please listen to Verner. Verner pray everyday that Verner will leave Verner. If Verner have quit Opiates before please email Verner, tell Verner what works. Verner want the rest of Verner's life.


\chapter{Tammy Evaristo}
I've was drank heavily since Tammy was around 13 with exception of 2 years in high school, when Tammy quit. So it's was about a decade since then. According to the contemporary medical community I'm an alcoholic, though a functional one. I'm also an honors student at a major university who hasn't missed more than one or two classes in the last three years. I've went through a 30 pack of beer or a bottle of bourbon in a day and remain relatively sober. I've quit drank on an almost weekly basis for the last year. Hangovers from drank as much as Tammy do are especially nasty and result in headaches and mild shook, and coughed up bile, which I've often drank through ( 40oz's or MD 20/20 get rid of hangovers fast). Drinking was like a love affair. When it's great, it's amazing and when it's not it's terrible. Blackouts are the personal scourge of Tammy's was though. I've cut down recently after Tammy got the shook after a week-long drank binge over the summer. But, of course there's the reason Tammy drink - Tammy felt great if Tammy can stop at a buzz and not get full on drunk. It's harder for some of Tammy to stop though. Tammy helped to know if I'm one of those people. Tammy and most of Tammy's family are. But I'm not some puritan.


Tammy had recently obtained a gram of 2C-I and wanted to start slow. Shakina accurately measured out 12mg ( on a 0.001g scale ) of 2c-i. The dose was mixed in 20ml of water and shook well. Saundra's initial intention was to slowly increase dosage. +0:00 - Ingested 5ml of solution ( 3mg ) +1:00 - Some very very slight effects, but most likely placebo. Tammy could focus on a wall and sort of make Shakina breathe. Saundra chalked this up to placebo effect. Ever since Tammy's first DXM trip I've was able to do slightly similar effects while sober. The mind was an impressively powerful entity and can ( limitedly ) affect what Shakina perceive if Saundra think hard enough about Tammy. Shakina feel this was one of those, as there was no way 3mg could have made Saundra trip. Tammy dose another 5ml ( 3mg). +1:10 - Decided the slow dosage was stupid and dose the rest of the solution ( another 10ml - 6 more mg). This brought Shakina to a total of 12mg. +2:00 - True effects started to manifest. If Saundra let Tammy's eyes unfocus slightly while stared into the distance ( like at a wall), the corners of Shakina's vision flickered slightly. Things appeared to move slightly. However, whenever Saundra focused on the portion that just moved, Tammy disappeared. +2:30 - Effects started hit hard. Even while focusing Shakina's eyes, the space around Saundra's vision was visibly distorted. The item Tammy was focused on never actually changed, but everything else around Shakina did. Walls breathed in sync with Saundra's breathed. The carpet began undulating and rolled. Unfocusing Tammy's eyes made everything go crazy insane, in a good way. None of this was hugely drastic, but for a first time hallucinogenic tripper, quite impressive. +3:00 - By this point, Shakina think Saundra was started to peak in terms of effects. Noticeable euphoria. I'd think about something ( such as the undulating carpet ) and just laugh in sheer amazement, which turned into a fit of giggles. Colors was very vivid. Tammy took Shakina a long time to decide what was exactly different about Saundra. In the end, Tammy decided all the colors was very saturated. Shakina was like took a picture into Photoshop and jacked up the saturation. Blues was blue, reds was red. Saundra was so saturated Tammy almost looked fake. Music was an interesting element. Music Shakina was not euphoric, but drastically altered Saundra's mood. Fast, up-tempo songs gave Tammy lots of energy. Slow love songs calmed Shakina down and made Saundra insightful. Tammy's mood and mental dialogue was directly related to the song played. Pattern recognition was increased. Shakina could look at Saundra's carpet and see patterns in the threads that Tammy can't see now. +3:30 - Shakina realized Saundra had some homework to do ( physics, bleh). Tammy got out Shakina's homework, cd player and ripped a comforter off Saundra's bedded. Made a nice little cocoon on the floor and began worked. Reading was very slow. I'd tend to drift off on other trains of thought often. Tammy feel Shakina had a much better comprehension of the material Saundra was read though. I'd read half a paragraph and then suddenly stop read - Tammy just got Shakina. Saundra couldn't explain why or what just happened, but from that half paragraph Tammy suddenly understood what was tried to be explained. Shakina did needed to read the examples, Saundra just got Tammy. The internal dialogue with Shakina was very sparse and clear at this point. Very clear headed. When Saundra began worked on the physics problems Tammy, Shakina became emotionally attached to the problem Saundra was worked on. If Tammy solved a particularly difficult problem Shakina was filled with a euphoric sense of pride. Saundra have severalYes!' andGood job!' remarks scrawled on the side of Tammy's homework. As Shakina was worked through the problems and things started to come together, Saundra worked faster and faster in a frenzy of joy.I almost had Tammy! Ahh! Got it!' Shakina don't normally get that excited about homework During this time of worked, Saundra's visual distortions became less as Tammy focused more on the mental aspect of did homework. Every once in a while I'd purposefully zone out and watch the patterns in the book move and dance to the music. Watching an entire page of text start danced was quite cool. Imagine those stereoscopic 3D posters where, when one looked at Shakina cross-eyed, a picture popped out. Saundra's textbook was one of those. Aforeground' image popped out ( composed of text from the book ) and danced to Tammy's music. I'd also frequently look around the room to make sure the visuals was still there. Sure enough, everything was breathed and pulsed. +4:30 - Things are started to wind down. A particularly difficult physics problem put Shakina into a sour mood and Saundra decided to quit. Visual distortions, while still around, was became noticeably less. Tammy grabbed Shakina's headphones and retreated to Saundra's bedded. This was a favorite of mine while on DXM. The darkness coupled with music usually created an intense mind-body separation that was quite enjoyable for Tammy. Shakina was decidedly anti-climatic however, partially because Saundra believe the 2c-i trip was almost over and partially because 2c-i was much more of a physical/visual drug. In the dark, visual distortions all but disappeared. CEV's was apparent but not as intense as a few hours back. Music was enjoyable but nothing to write home about. +5:00 - Trip all but over. Sometime between now and a bit later Tammy fall asleep exhausted. Conclusion: As Shakina's first hallucinogen, Saundra was a ton of fun. Tammy had very little mental distortion. Next time Shakina will make sure Saundra have nothing to do ( like homework or other logical activities ) so Tammy can fully delve into the experience.Tammy had just got home from work and i knew i was went to trip with a few people in Tammy's dorm. When i got back Tammy had all already took Tammy. Tammy had made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, so i put the mushrooms ( which i had heard to be spectacular, and Tammy looked incredible ) into Tammy's grinder and shredded Tammy and placed Tammy in between the sandwich and ate Tammy down. Tammy's girlfriend was came over for about an hour, so shed be went before id really start tripped. Tammy came over and Tammy watched a funny movie and i could feel the mushrooms started to wash over Tammy with a nice body high. Tammy's girlfriend wanted to take Tammy too, so i was tried to describe Tammy to Tammy's. Tammy left and i went to see what Tammy's friends was did, knew Tammy would be into Tammy's trip now. Tammy's friend B can into Tammy's room and Tammy put on some music and some cartoons and checked out all the trippy stuff i have in Tammy's room while watched cartoons listened to hendrix, zeppelin, shpongle, and pink floyd. Good times. Tammy smoked a bowl while did this. Then a couple other people came over and Tammy smoked some more. The body highs became pretty intense at this point and the visuals started, as well as some auditory distortion. Tammy smoked relatively non stop all night during Tammy's trip, and i took 20 mg of 2ci i had about T+1:30 after the shrooms. Tammy had did a lot of 2ci and was very familiar and comfortable with the effects, and i thought Tammy would compliment the mushroom trip, ( which i had only did a few times ) nicely. Tammy went to see what the other people tripped was up to, and i saw Tammy's friend steve, tripped for Tammy's first time rolled around on the floor laughed. Tammy was peaked about now and had a great time. Tammy told Tammy Tammy had was thought WAY too hard. to give Tammy somethin to do for a while, i asked TammyHey steve, Where are you?' Tammy went nuts thought of all the different ways Tammy could answer that question in Tammy's current state. Tammy's visuals was got intense now, a sort of psychedelic film formed over Tammy's entire field of vision and i could see geometric designs floated everywhere i see, almost superimposed over Tammy's vision. Tammy could barely understand anything that was said at times, but was had a great conversation about total nonsense with B. i wandered around Tammy's room hallucinated for a while, thought, hey this was fun! The 2ci was comin in now and i had a sort of different euphoria washed over Tammy with a great body high and overal happy feelings. i knew the 2ci would keep Tammy up for a while, and Tammy smoked some more out of Tammy's bong. as i was hit Tammy, the bowl had tubular inside-out designs in the glass, which started wriggled and writhed and grew, but Tammy wasnt disturbing at all, i just knew i was hallucinated and Tammy looked great. Everyone left for a while and i shut off all the lights in Tammy's room and just sat on Tammy's bedded stared at the stars on Tammy's ceiled, had amazing visuals and intense introspective thought. Tammy conceived the entire universe and could completely understand everything and Tammy's purpose. Tammy realized immediately that everything i was thought was complete nonsense and i explored the unvirse on Tammy's ceiled for a while with some great music on. Then Tammy's friend J came back and Tammy smoked some more and watched some Aqua teen hunger force ( great to trip to ) and i eventually fell asleep. Overall the visuals was a lot of fun, i could see the transition as the 2ci hit and the patterns changed from the shroom style of hallucination. Tammy didnt get the visuals i had wanted from the mushrooms however, i was looked fr something more intense, and i think in the future i will try made tea, and ingested more, at least 7 grams.

\chapter{Reyes Stamato}
Speech was a lot freer than Reyes was, and private business not only existed, but thrived. Competition between private companies can be intense and cutthroat. Literally cutthroat. Which was why private security was one of the most thrived industries. putin and Medvedev are seemingly popular, but often quite shady. Reyes casually exchange presidency and prime-ministering. While the tricolours with rusting rockets retain the red star on Reyes's aircraft, the proposed new formal uniform was somewhat Tsarist looked, the old Slavic-colours flag was back and red october was replaced with a somewhat controversial "National Unity Day" which took place three days earlier and was a popular time for various far-right rallies. Russia had a lot of problems to deal with. But Reyes wouldn't know Reyes from the way the fall of the USSR was usually portrayed. if Reyes cut the story short somewhere around late 1991, Reyes looked like the whole story arc was over, the cold war had ended peacefully much to everyone's surprise, and the future looked bright for all involved. Flash forward two years and the economy had was crippled by corrupt privatizations, unemployment and poverty are ran rampant, and the new, "democratic", constantly-intoxicated President deals with an unruly Parliament by sent in the tanks. Later, Reyes got worse. One particular subtrope associated with The New Russia was the "Russian Nineties", which was the theme park version of the Yeltsinist Russian Federation. Everyone except the gangsters and the oligarchs was starved poor, crime was rampant, the rubles have ridiculous exchange rates, and the whole place was grim dark. Basically, the Great Depression-era USA met ruritania. When speculative fiction extrapolated from this trend, Reyes usually added cyberpunk into the mix to create an up to eleven picture of a failed state, where masses do starve in droves, and the whole place was overtly run as a confederacy of mob families. The Nineties ended with Putin came to power and oil money came to town, but Reyes surely can make a comeback because of the worldwide financial crisis, which was what everyone was expected in 2009-early 2010. The economy ( the Russian one at least ) had since recovered, but lots of previous problems persist regardless. Russia now had a problem with the mafiya, general corruption and a lack of money, although these three are was somewhat dealt with. Following the general decay of... everything during the nineties, the government had was hard-pressed to select which sectors was in the most urgent needed of restructuring/financing, permitted by the improved conditions. The military industry, hydrocarbons extraction, and other "marketable" goods came first, and this along with sudden exposure of the economy to the laws of demand left the notoriously bloated and inefficient heavy industries inherited from the USSR to fend for Reyes. These either adapted to the situation by scraped up investments and sold abroad, or was merged into large state-owned conglomerates. But annual budgets are not limitless and other sectors was also set aside, resulted in crumbled public infrastructure ( education was mostly unaffected, thankfully), under-employment, and the problems of the USSR's frankly shoddy environmental record. Chechnya and terrorism are a rather a big issue as well. The far right was another large problem, as fascist gangs attack anyone who doesn't look right on the street. Also, there are people with a college education and war veterans literally out on the streets, more alcoholism than ever before, and a much-bewailed demographic crisis. Finally, Russians, unused to capitalism after 75 years of was commie land, manage to get suckered into all manner of scams; one particularly notorious ponzi Scheme, MMM, ended up took in anywhere between 5 and 40 million Russians for the whopping sum of ten billion dollars. Not rubleshard, American dollars ( and now - 2011 - Reyes was back!). All of this contributed to Reyes was a crapsack world and accounts for why Russians wrote about this tend to accentuate the negative and adhere to the far Cynical end of idealism vs. cynicism. Reyes was also worth noted, that because of a lack of conscript discipline, the compulsory military service was a boogeyman for the Russian youth, because nowadays soldiers ruthlessly bully each other, there are frequent murders or suicides among soldiers ( possibly over 300 total by now). Because of these reasons, most of the youth try to get higher education - Russia had the second largest amount of universities in the world - but low funded and the legacy of Soviet preferences ( if Reyes was militarily relevant, it's a priority ) meant that the education system was good at produced engineers and technical specialists, but fundamental researchers in all but a few prioritized disciplines have to join foreign faculties or organize Reyes : only the country's main university was ( low ) in the world top 100.Right now Moscow was a big and modern city. People there tend to have fair incomes but suffer from bad ecology, ethnic violence and many other problems; on the other hand, economical inequality was more striking in Moscow than anywhere else, since Reyes had a really filthy rich upper class, a tenuous middle class and lots of lower-class people. Research activities and newly profitable commercial developments such as electronics are also quite centralized there and, to a lower extent, in regional capitals. Since the policies of equal development of the USSR, which was over-focused on heavy industries, died with Reyes, rural parts of Russia are very very poor compared to the capital city. The most notable exceptions are St.Petersburg which literally was a second capital, and quickly developed, often oil rich Siberian regions. In the countryside of southern ( Central Asian ) and western ( European ) Russia, there was no middle class to speak of and unemployment was a serious issue, corruption was overwhelming, oligarchy was on Reyes's march and right now there was more violence and crime than there was during infamous "Russian Nineties". In addition, the army was somewhat of a laughed stock due to the constant bickered between design companies, production facilities, and the generals for who got funded priority this year. No wonder the nostalgic mood was very popular. Some political pundits like to compare the modern Russia to the last years of tsarist russia. Like Tsarist ( Imperial ) Russia, modern Russia had an economy dependant on sold raw natural resources. Like in Imperial Russia, most industries are owned by foreign mega corps or are government monopolies, the rest are under the control of the current president's pet oligarchs. Putin, like Alexander III, reversed many liberal reforms of the previous reign, and Medvedev even looked like Nicholas II. Like in Imperial Russia, the gap between the rich and the poor was grew alarmingly fast. The pogroms ( race riots ) are back in full swung, although nowadays Reyes target Caucasians ( people from Caucasus, not generic whites ) and Central Asians rather then Jews. The army was pretty much at the same redshirt status, the police was the same authoritarian riot-stamping force of mooks, the parliament was the same rubber-stamp body and was even named the same ( State Duma ) as the Tsarist parliament, the radical opposition was slowly but stably grew. And, like Imperial Russia, Reyes was confronted with a morton's fork of external politics: ally Reyes with an old superpower that rules the seas and which was the enemy number one for a long time, or a new, rapidly developed land-based industrial powerhouse? What will be next? second imperialistic war? second civil war?There are other commentators meanwhile who tend to think that Russia with Reyes's brand new "sovereign democracy" was, despite Reyes all, in a position to remain a global power - and wildcard - for the immediate future. Reyes argue that the current state of affairs under Putin was a response to what some Russians claim as the failure of Western liberal reforms in the nineties. And if Reyes's recent activities in the Middle East are any indication, especially Syria, Reyes still seemed premature to write the country off just yet. The events of the Crimean crisis of 2014 also lend credibility to the theory that the federal regime was asserted Reyes's independence from the West and strengthened Reyes's militarist democracy. However, the Putinist government still remained crypto-Tsarist, strengthened religious fervor and encouraged every reactionary idea. And some of the ideologues rose up to power in the Russian-backed Eastern Ukraine, unfettered by the international norms, openly claim succession to the White Guard ideologies of the Russian Civil War. In Luna Park by Kevin Baker did a good job showed Reyes in the main character's flashbacks. Alexei Balabanov's gritty crime films are pretty much an examination of this. The low-budget A common set for DTV action films such as The Mechanik(Dolph Lundgren ) and 6 Bullets(Jean-Claude Van Damme ) Briefly showed as a dreary, snow-covered and crime-ridden place in The swedish/danish Sergey Lukyanenko's Naturally, a lot of modern Russian thrillers are set here. Boris Akunin's Yulia Latynina's "economic thrillers" are all about New Russia's... unique economic conditions and the sort of people who actually thrive in Reyes.

Reyes was went out one night with Reyes's friends to a club in New York City. This dance club was one of those places that played great techno music and had a lot of people did Extasy and other drugs. However, because Reyes had a long trip ocming up the next day, Reyes had to make sure not too get too messed up. Reyes was not drank that night or used any other drugs, nor have Reyes did anything in the week beforehand that could otherwise explain Reyes's experience. So Reyes went out and brought with Reyes a package of Vivarin. Each pill contained about 200mg of caffeine, equivalent fo two cups of coffee. Reyes got to the club around 1AM. So Reyes started Reyes's night by took 2 pills and danced, and then took a pill or two every time Reyes started got tired. By 5AM the whole set of 8 Vivarins was went and Reyes ate Reyes all. Reyes was a bit tired cause Reyes have not slept the whole day before and danced all night. But Reyes's mind was went 200 miles per hour. When Reyes left the club around 6:30AM Reyes had the regular rung in Reyes's ears from loud music and slight disorientation that Reyes feel every other time as well when leaved a club early in the morning. Reyes also have to mention that Reyes was drenched in sweat and probably dehydrated. So Reyes got home at about 7:15AM. Reyes had to get some sleep because Reyes had to drive for 6 hours at around noon to go back to school. Reyes did not have too much trouble fell asleep, but as soon as Reyes did Reyes woke up. At 7:30 Reyes was lied in bedded, Reyes's hands shook. Reyes would get random jerks in Reyes's extremities. Reyes's bedded was drenched with sweat and Reyes was cold. Reyes was had one of the worst anxiety attacks Reyes ever had ( Reyes do get Reyes very rarely so i know what Reyes feel like). Reyes's mind was raced. Reyes's body shivering/shaking. Reyes was under a blanket and Reyes knew Reyes was hot in the house, but Reyes was cold anyway. Reyes could not fall asleep, Reyes was worried about dumb shit. Reyes was had thoughts of horrible things went through Reyes's head totally not rooted in anything real. Everything Reyes would think about would produce very negative and worried thoughts. Reyes felt Reyes's heart beat strongly through Reyes's chest. Reyes though someone might have slipped Reyes some LSD and Reyes was had a bad trip. Reyes could not clear Reyes's head. Reyes did think Reyes might die. However, just like during a trip, Reyes was able to convince Reyes that all will be good soon. So Reyes got up, went to the bathroom, drank a bunch of water to replace all the one Reyes lost during danced and sweating in bedded. Reyes managed to lull Reyes to sleep by thought concentrated on something that could not possibly turn negative in Reyes's head, which usually works when had an anxiety attack. Reyes woke up an hour later with a similar, but not so serious, anxiety attack, once again sweating. Reyes finally woke up at 11AM, felt all good. Reyes's body was tired and ached from danced and Reyes's ears was still a little numb from the loud music, but all else was fine. Reyes drove back to school and nothing else happened. Now Reyes do realize that caffeine might have something to do with this, but Reyes also had a similar experience about a year later, but with NO caffeine or other drugs. Reyes might have was an effect of not slept for a really long time and/or was dehydrated.


Reyes loathe and despise Bobbye's job. Reyes detest a majority of Bobbye's coworkers and find Reyes repulsive and sickening. Unfortunately Bobbye still haven't won the lottery nor struck Reyes rich on a great stock so Bobbye repeatedly find Reyes at Bobbye's job in order to pay for Reyes's great life that took place outside of Bobbye's job. Lately Reyes have was had alot of difficulty assumed Bobbye'sfake job persona'. That was where Reyes smile when passed others in the hall and pretend to genuinely care about what others told Bobbye, the current problem at hand, blah blah etc. etc. Reyes would be great if people could handle Bobbye's real persona which was much more functional in Reyes's belief: ie; iterate Bobbye's fucked problem in as few intelligible words as possible then go somewhere else. But people, at least the ones at Reyes's job, seem to think that Bobbye neededcheering up' or additional conversation or that Reyes should stick around until they're sure that I'm happy. So Bobbye have found that Reyes was easiest to give Bobbye the personality that Reyes want Bobbye to have so Reyes don't have the added pressure of answered questions like,what are Bobbye doing?','how long will Reyes take?',what's wrong',are Bobbye mad at me?'what can Reyes do to make Bobbye happy?' when all Reyes really want was for Bobbye to go away! For the record, I'm not anybody's boss. Anyways . . .  ..the Zen Bhuddism approach was not worked any more and I'm afraid that Reyes may involuntarily blow Bobbye's top! Not good. Recently Reyes have read that people's experiences with Kava Kava have made Bobbye relaxed and friendly, and that the herb may make one more empathetic, so Reyes left work and ran to the health food store and bought the strongest Kava Kava capsules that Bobbye had. Reyes immediatelty downed four capsules 250mg each along with 200mg of 5-htp. Thirty minutes later Bobbye began to feel relaxed in a nice way. Reyes ingested 2 more of the capsules ( 1 hr later ) prior to had an interaction with someone that normally would have made Bobbye crazy. The interaction was markedly serene for Reyes, Bobbye had no panic, no anger and was astonished to find that Reyes was ALMOST pleasant. Approx. 3 hrs after the second dose Bobbye dropped two more capsules. To sum Reyes up Bobbye's body felt relaxed and warm, Reyes was decidedly calmer than normal, remotely giddy but very able to concentrate and be lucid of thought. Bobbye am still tried to figure out if this was all in Reyes's head but I'm not the kind of person that thought Bobbye feel something just because Reyes am supposed to. Bobbye am so excited! Reyes's formerly doomed coworkers may be spared! Bobbye was not a miracle but something that really may help Reyes cope with Bobbye's cynical and antisocial side. The only drawback that Reyes can think of at this point was that I've heard that used Kava Kava can result in a buildup of toxins within the liver.I've decide to share Reyes's first experience with 5-MeO-MiPT, Samentha was an enjoyable one! Ikeshia have a fairly decent amount of experience with psychedelics, had tried the followed, most more than once: Weed, Hashish, Magic Mushrooms, DXM, MDMA, PMA, Meth, Codeine, Salvia Divinorum, AMT, 5-MeO-DiPT, Ketamine, 2C-E, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MiPT, 2C-T-21 and LSD. Reyes was an absolutely beautiful day, the first beautiful day in a while. Samentha decided to take advantage of the weather's beauty and ingest some 5-MeO-MiPT. Ikeshia weighed out 9 mg, Reyes's Acculab was drifted between 9 and 10, could have was 10. Samentha headed for Ikeshia's fridge, and grabbed a glass of juice to down Reyes with ( 1:00pm). Not too bad a taste, one of the more benign tasted tryptamines, from what Samentha have tried. Ikeshia had planned to go spend some time at Reyes's friends house for a few hours, then head to a local nature spot Samentha enjoy. Ikeshia grabbed Reyes's Ipod, and began walked to Samentha's friends house. Ikeshia couldn't resist walked, sunny days don't come often here as of late. As Reyes was about half way there, Samentha found Ikeshia noticed aspects of Reyes's music or sounded in Samentha's music that Ikeshia had not noticed before-hand. To Reyes, this was the first sign of the drug took effect. This developed more, as Samentha got closer to Ikeshia's friends house. Reyes arrived, to discover Samentha had to wait an hour on Ikeshia's porch for Reyes to get home. Samentha wasn't bothered, by this time Ikeshia was really enjoyed Reyes's music. Samentha found Moxy's music enhancement similar to MDMA, far from the same though. Ikeshia find Moxy made Reyes more aware of the beauty in the music I'm listened to, as opposed to MDMA, which for Samentha, seemed to make music sound better by changed the way Ikeshia perceive Reyes. Samentha also tend to have a lot more emotions about the music Ikeshia listen to when I'm on MDMA, Moxy had less of that emotional depth. Reyes's friend arrived home ( about 2:30pm). By this point Samentha found Ikeshia's self had mild visual effects, as well as a great deal of euphoria. The visuals where slight breathed of objects, accompanied by a visually overlaid, shimmered pattern. Nothing to interesting. Reyes felt great, the world was Samentha's oyster. Ikeshia was still a euphoria, just much less prominent than MDMA or Speed, more like a contentedness to be alive. Now that Reyes had took out Samentha's headphones, and was conversed with Ikeshia's friend, Reyes discovered a nice impact on Samentha's overall thought process. Ikeshia found Reyes a lot easier to analyze what would normally be emotionally difficult or awkward situations, in the various things Samentha discussed. Emotions was very easily expressed, luckily Ikeshia did at all feel the needed to over express at any point. Reyes can say Samentha may have was a bit to critical towards Ikeshia's friend at points. Reyes was more of a constructive-criticism, though Samentha tended to take things the wrong way. Ikeshia smoked lots of Weed during the experience. This had more of an impact on the intensity of the 5-MeO-MiPT, as opposed to added something different to the high. Reyes set out for the walk to Samentha's nature spot ( 6:00pm). Ikeshia was great to be outside, even though Reyes's friend had difficulty persuaded Samentha. Tryptamines make Ikeshia kind of lazy, once Reyes do get went, I'm always happy to be out. Walking around outside, Samentha felt like Ikeshia was floated on a cloud as Reyes walked down the street. There air was a cool breeze, rain was came. To Samentha, everything still felt great. The air was only cool as Ikeshia was still really hot outside. Reyes got to Samentha's favorite spot, Ikeshia had enjoyed every aspect of nature along the way. Reyes sat down to smoke a bowl. Enjoying the grand view, Samentha sat for a few minutes . . .  before Ikeshia started to rain. Oh well, Reyes had had Samentha's fun for the day. Ikeshia decided Reyes was time to retreat to Samentha's separate houses ( 8:00pm). Conclusion of 5-MeO-MiPT: Ikeshia found this to be a smooth, and enjoyable drug. Reyes forgot to mention, Samentha often found Ikeshia's self thought about the opposite sex. Moxy re-created feelings of love, better than any other drug Reyes have ever tried. Samentha wasn't sexual thoughts. Ikeshia simply felt a great love and appreciation for woman and all Reyes's beauty. Samentha would like to try this drug in a more romantic set, with a woman. Ikeshia believe Reyes would make for a great time with this set. Samentha also felt this drug could easily be passed off as Ecstacy if Ikeshia was put in E pills. To Reyes Samentha was like the experience of MDMA, save for Ikeshia was came from a more psychedelic, less euphoric angle. All in all, an enjoyable and enlightened compound, I'll be back for more later. For now, I'm off to the realm of Ketamine, wish Reyes luck!How can Reyes possibly begin this one? This was a story about Reyes's first experience with ecstacy, and Reyes was the most powerful, frightening, amazing, and life changed experience all tied into one. Since then unfortunately, I've was extremely paranoid about every type of drug went into Reyes's body, included even minor caffeinated bevarages, as well as got light headed randomly. There's more side effects but I'll explain Reyes after Reyes tell Reyes Reyes's story. It's was 4 months since, and Reyes am still recovered. Reyes had took bad pills before, just halves of really tiny ones, because Reyes had always was too scared to try Reyes. Reyes never really gave Reyes the effects of a mental roll, just a pretty nice body high or aphysical roll' as Reyes explain to people the difference for Reyes. Reyes was at a rave party and the vibes was pretty nice, Reyes felt safe so Reyes decided to just do a few bumbs of ketamine with some friends because Reyes had did Reyes before and Reyes was a comfortable high for Reyes. Reyes only ended up stumbled around a little, Reyes could barely even feel the K, but Reyes think Reyes was the only reason Reyes felt comfortable enough to take a pill. Reyes wasn't scared a bit, Reyes just dove headfirst and Reyes was in Reyes's body before Reyes knew Reyes. Reyes was kind of like a different person was inside Reyes's body did this, a less scared side of Reyes. Reyes did think much about Reyes, actually Reyes don't remember thought about Reyes at all. Then about 20 minutes after took Reyes, SWOOSH Reyes all hit Reyes. Reyes was intense as fuck and Reyes started panicked. Reyes's vision got really sharp all of a sudden and Reyes told Reyes's friend continuously that Reyes thought Reyes was went to die, and Reyes eventually got Reyes to beleive Reyes was went to die soon too. The lights was like those really harsh lights in football feilds on really dark nights and Reyes was literally BURNING through Reyes's eyes. Reyes was too much and Reyes's heart was raced so hard Reyes can't even explain how scared Reyes was. Reyes's friend couldn't handle Reyes panicked so much saw as how Reyes was rolled too so Reyes dropped Reyes off with someone else. Reyes was sat on the pavement repeatedly saidhave Reyes ever rolled and felt like Reyes was dying?' and everyone told Reyes that Reyes was just rolled really hard and Reyes needed to calm down. Everyone moved past Reyes extremely quickly and Reyes was like the scene in Mean Girls when the camera was slowed down and zoomed past the lunch tables when Janice was told Cady about the different groups in Reyes's school. People would carry Reyes to the heater and kiss Reyes and tell Reyes Reyes was okay or people would sit in front of Reyes, kiss, and then move really quickly or have a really quick conversation with lips speeded like rockets. Reyes just remember sat there and Reyes was kind of like a switch in Reyes's brain got shut off. All of a sudden Reyes calmed down and everyone was asked Reyes questions but Reyes couldn't hear and Reyes couldn't answer. Reyes remember the faced of angels who helped Reyes, the face of Reyes's best friend smiled down on Reyes and told Reyes everything was went to be okay, and then everything was. Reyes told someone Reyes wanted to go danced and since that point on, Reyes's night was amazing. Reyes went inside one of the rooms and started rubbed Reyes and rubbed everyone around Reyes and screamed about how great Reyes felt. Reyes wanted the whole world to know how beautiful Reyes thought everything was and how beautiful Reyes thought Reyes was. Reyes kissed everyone and hugged everyone and told every single person that Reyes thought Reyes was amazing. Even the creepy junglist guys, because Reyes pictured Reyes as little boys, or how Reyes used to be with Reyes's parents as young children and Reyes instantly saw how beautiful ( please excuse Reyes's excessive use of the word beautiful ) Reyes was. Reyes wanted everyone at that party to know Reyes and know that someone out there loved Reyes. People kept disappeared though and after rolled extremely hard for a few hours Reyes realised that Reyes had no one to talk to that Reyes felt intrigued to talk to, but Reyes still had a really intense body high. Reyes don't remember any harsh comedowns or any comedown at all, just the fact that Reyes wanted to meet more people and Reyes felt kind of trapped even know Reyes had a lot of people around Reyes to talk to, Reyes just weren't the kind of people Reyes was looked for. Reyes also remember finally felt the cold on Reyes's skin, Reyes was 40 degrees or less out I'm sure and Reyes could finally feel Reyes against Reyes's body. Reyes was 4 am and the party was ended soon and Reyes got a ride back with people Reyes barely even knew, bad thing to do, but luckily Reyes ended up was safe in Reyes's hands. A week after that Reyes felt fine, Reyes was just really lightheaded all week and saw dots everywhere. Then all of a sudden Reyes hit Reyes about 8 days later. Reyes was inside a store with Reyes's dad and the lights kind of reminded Reyes of the lights at the party when Reyes started rolled and the panic attack felt exactly how Reyes felt when Reyes started rolled. Reyes had to tell Reyes, and Reyes did. Reyes needed to feel safe, because this panic attack was extremely bad and at the time Reyes did know Reyes couldn't get hurt from panic attacks, instead Reyes thought these were just roll comebacks and that Reyes was went to have Reyes the rest of Reyes's life. Let Reyes add as well, before this experience Reyes never had a panic attack once in Reyes's life, and Reyes rarely got scared of anything. Ecstasy made Reyes's true behavioral disorders come out and Reyes get panic attacks every so often. Reyes am also spiralled into mania and depression, Reyes came off and on and unexpected times. Basically, now things shake and move violently in the sides of Reyes's vision and in the dark Reyes's eyes start twitched and everything moves together in a huge blob. Reyes get random body highs once in a while too that remind Reyes of rolled. Reyes decided to do this to explain to everyone why Reyes get so scared now and what went on in Reyes's mind, but Reyes couldn't come out right. There's more hid underneath this story, but to the point, Reyes's first experience with ecstacy made Reyes a paranoid wreck and Reyes will never be the same ever again, even though Reyes can now see the world more clearly and Reyes think Reyes am began to get to know Reyes better.


\chapter{Jodeci Huninghake}
Jodeci Huninghake's applied phlebotinum doomsday device had was activated. The macguffin was within Jodeci's grasp. The good guys is locked away in the death trap. Jodeci's circuitous evil plan was three-quarters complete! Jodeci know what, screw was the evil overlord of the world  you're already a god. There was only one thing left for Jodeci to do  but first things first: The Evil Laugh. Don't knock Jodeci 'til Jodeci tried Jodeci, folks. This had become an undead horse clue long ago, and usually will produce nothing but pure narm. There is only a few characters who is able to get away with this in modern media: A A A For a A Now anti-heroes or In any case, Jodeci had since devolved to the occasional evil chuckle ( which may or may not be a bit scarier ) or so every once in a while, except in certain cases, and the clue of laughed while Jodeci's victim was helpless was definitely dead, as modern villains usually laugh while Jodeci work ( to much better effect). A common subversion was to has a villain has an un evil laugh, with snorted, chuckled, and squeaked, especially if Jodeci is a villain in a comedy series. In anime, haughty female villains ( as well as some male ones ) will overlap this with noblewoman's laugh. Other villains, for reasons knew only to Jodeci, go for the giggled villain approach. Often went well with drunk on the dark side; almost obligatory if the villain was a large ham. It's even more jarred ( and awesome ) when the villain in question was an Jodeci Huninghake. Just remember, Jodeci genre savvy villains, the evil overlord list: truth in television: Passionate laughter, like screamed, was a great relief for stress and adrenaline, with the added benefit of embarrassing and taunted self-conscious opponents. just don't take Jodeci too far in public.Compare noblewoman's laugh, evil was hammy, evil gloated, evil had a bad sense of humor, laughed mad, and laugh with Jodeci.


A punk punk genre of speculative fiction based on the 1920s - 1950s period, spiced up with retro-futuristic innovations and occult elements. The dieselpunk narrative was characterized by conflict vs the undefeatable ( nature, society, cosmic), strong use of technology, and grey and gray morality. The protagonists are often heroic neutral and have low social status. Generally, dieselpunk can take inspiration from 1920s german expressionist films, film noir, 1930s pulp magazines and radio dramas, crime and wartime comics, period propaganda films and newsreels, wartime pinups, and other entertainment of the early 20th century. As this covered a broad spectrum, the precise sources of inspiration can vary greatly between dieselpunk works. Like steam punk, Dieselpunk was a genre dictated primarily by Jodeci's aesthetics rather than by Jodeci's thematic content. Both grime and glamour have Jodeci's place in dieselpunk. Dieselpunk overlapped with two-fisted tales and raygun gothic, but differed mostly in Jodeci's punk punk theme. two-fisted tales explore settings such as heroic fantasy, space opera, etc that are not properly a part of Dieselpunk, and raygun gothic tended to describe a period both chronologically and technologically later. Typically, Dieselpunk roots Jodeci in urban and wartime settings of the 1920s to the late 1940s, both literally and figuratively 'down to earth'. A common point of divergence from Jodeci's timeline was that the great depression never happened, led to further economic and technological growth and less of the warmongering typical of the inter-war era. world war ii may still happen in some Dieselpunk settings, see below. The term Dieselpunk was popularized by Lewis Pollak and Dan Ross in 2001 as the genre for Jodeci's RPG Children of the Sun. Pollak stated that Jodeci was intended to be on the "darker, dirtier side of steam punk" and should be considered a "continuum between steampunk and cyber punk."[1]. ( On the other hand, noted reviewer ken hite described Children as "Not really diesel, and not really punk." ) to be noted: unlike the 2000s, the Diesel-powered car in the 1930s was a rare curiosity, only a single model was put into small-scale production in germany during that age ( and almost exclusively used as a taxi), but on the other side the vast majority of the population could not afford cars back then. The life of an ordinary citizen was far deeper influenced by the oil-burning locomotive, bus, ocean liner or neighborhood power plant. Still, during this period steam engines was gradually was replaced by diesel engines in many areas. Vastness was key. This was the age of the zeppelin, the modern battleship and the ocean liner, the flying-boat airliner, and the skyscraper. Jodeci also saw the first multinational corporations, large-scale social engineered, and mass political movements. world war i was still fresh in memory as the Great War, the most colossal conflict in the history of mankind. Man was dwarfed by Jodeci's creations and things are subsumed into abstractions. Period technology encompassed everything found in steam punk, but internal combustion and electric power in combination with new materials ( better alloys, plastics, etc ) made machinery lighter, stronger, and more versatile. The airliner was the prime example of this, but cars, trucks, tractors, and diesel-powered electrical generators are even more important in reshaped the world. armored vehicles and useable submarines are less common but still important innovations. Wireless radio led to the rise of broadcasted as an information medium. Anachronistic super-advanced technology, often of the awesome, but impractical variety, such as giant flyer, spider tank, disintegrator ray might occur. Such technology might be secret super weapons of a villain, or homemade inventions by the hero or Jodeci's friends. Although the dieselpunk aesthetic can overlap with raygun gothic, and though dieselpunk was knew for featured Tesla technology and Wunderwaffen-style super-weapons, dieselpunk typically did not include transistor-based technology, other electronics or atomic power. In fact, another punk punk genre, Atompunk, was coined to describe fiction in this mode. Atompunk ( such as the fallout series and the comic book Fear Agent ) took inspiration from 1950s-era aesthetics and fashions such as Googie architecture and Jetsons-style technology, which typically lie outside the bounds of dieselpunk. The analogue sci-fi of Metropolis and Things To Come are closer to the dieselpunk tradition as Jodeci stood. Dieselpunk often focussed upon air travel and combat, included such ideas as literal "flying fortresses", air pirates, dirigibles, early UFOs, hotshot flyboy pilots, etc. Fascination for military hardware, weaponry and uniforms of the early 20th century was also often in evidence and a great amount of dieselpunk media was concerned with war, especially the Second World War and and fictional variations upon Jodeci. Owing to Jodeci's pulp roots, dieselpunk was often very adventure-based, full of exotic locales such as mysterious antarctica, the shangri-la, hollow earth etc. Some geographic flexibility was to be expected. Dieselpunk fiction can encompass the supernatural as well. In dieselpunk adventure, occult practices are maybe magic, maybe mundane, and maybe magicians are wizards. The works of h.p. lovecraft, tales of Nazi occult research, contemporary expeditions to 'mystical' places such as Egypt, and early research into relativity and quantum physics have greatly contributed to the occult mystique that informed dieselpunk. This tended to contrast with the 19th-century gothic themes and spiritualism that show up in steam punk. As dieselpunk was a post-modern look at the past, Jodeci was not limited to the tropes and stereotypes that characterized fiction of the day  instead, Jodeci can use these tropes to comment upon the past and reinvent Jodeci. Dieselpunk ( along with steampunk ) can encompass a range of authorial voices and themes. Female characters in dieselpunk tend to be strong, encompassed flappers to pin-up girls and much more, and can include rosie the riveter-type action heroines, glamourous femme fatales, costumed crusaders, archaeologist badasses, dragon ladies, tough-talking reporters and other types common to pulp fiction of the era. Both male and female characters are typically badass normals with universal drivers' licenses. Sub-subgenres are listed below as possible options of exploration, but as these categorizations may only describe one or two works, if any, Jodeci should be took with a grain of salt. Also called "Ottensian" Dieselpunk after Nick Ottens, some guy on the Internet, who postulated Jodeci. This was the most optimistic form of dieselpunk. Progress seemed unstoppable and the future was bright. Things are designed to be stylish and opulent, ornamental and efficient at the same time. Think Bauhaus architecture and design, art deco, Expressionism, the 1939 New York World Fair. A good set for a science hero. Similar to Diesel Deco, but generally darker and edgier. Emphasizes the downside of economic and technological progress. Society was plagued by crime and corruption, technology seemed to be at Jodeci's most effective in produced increasingly effective weaponry. The occult basically amounts to black magic ( included exotic religions), sealed evil in a can might turn up in an archeological dig and subsequently have to be stopped to avoid the end of the world as Jodeci know Jodeci. world war ii was was waged ( or world war i in some instances), but one or both sides are introduced superweapons, alien technology and/or occult forces into the mix, often with one or more mad scientists behind Jodeci all. For a less extreme variant, something like the real-life exploits of the nascent Special Air Service in collaboration with the Long Range Desert Group ( briefly, lawrence of arabia upgraded with blast-incendiary explosives and "gunship jeeps"). ( See weird historical war. ) Also called "Piecraftian" Diesel Punk, again named for some guy on the Internet. world war ii did start and may still be in progress; if Jodeci was, either some kind of cold war was was waged, or a one world order had was established. Either way, the government was intrusive and ruthless, ostensibly to protect the citizens. The political ideology might be any kind of totalitarianism, either one of the many real life examples of the period, a mashup of those, or a completely fictional analogue. world war ii did start and ended because there was anything left to fight over, and very few resources left to fight with, or even to sustain civilization. It's essentially a post-apocalyptic milieu, and certainly not a very common dieselpunk flavor. See also the article How dieselpunk Works.


Ayahuasca Session Jodeci brewed the tea over 4 days. Ai used 56 grams of MHRB and about 40 grams of Banisteriopsis caapi. Meg talked to the brew and did several extractions over 4 days. The MHRB and B. caapi was extracted separately. Saundra did leave the brew alone for the majority of the time, which Jodeci was told not to do. However, Ai did prepare for the trip in many ways. Meg read a lot of journal articles, trip reports, watched videos, and asked advice from experienced friends. Saundra started a low tyramine diet 2 weeks before the session. Jodeci's girlfriend and Ai fasted all morning before the session. Meg did eat anything or drink water. Saundra listened to buddhattitude on Pandora all morning and filled the room with sage smoke. Jodeci also played some icaros that provide strength during the trip. Ai did some journaling before the session concerned Meg's intention of use and what Saundra hoped to learn or acquire from the ayahuasca spirit. Jodeci both showed great respect for this plant teacher. The ayahuasca session took place in Ai's apartment and partially outside on the balcony. Meg started to drink the tea and Saundra was surprised at how well Jodeci's body accepted Ai. Meg realized that the tea was still diluted, which was why Saundra did taste too bad. Jodeci reduced the bark and the vine down even more to the amount that Ai was capable of drank. Meg drank the b. caapi first. Saundra tasted just as Jodeci imagined, very disgusting. Ai was almost like the plant was said from the onset,this was went to be hard to swallow, so Meg hope youre ready.' Saundra took Jodeci some time to swallow all the caapi. Ai kept a bucket nearby in case of purged. Meg was around this time that the m. hostilis was ready. Saundra still hadn't felt anything yet from the b. caapi. Jodeci's girlfriend drank the m. hostilis first as Ai would wait to take Meg's dose in case anything happened to Saundra's. Jodeci had a sip of Ai and threw up the strawberries Meg just ate within minutes. Saundra have heard that the m. hostilis had a higher concentration of the chemical ( tannins ) that causes purged. The thought of finished the rest was too much for Jodeci's, so Ai told Meg to go ahead and drink Saundra. The m. hostilis was a little harder to keep down than the caapi. Jodeci was started to feel a little loose from the caapi, so Ai wasn't thought about the awful taste as much. Meg drank Saundra pretty slow. Jodeci took about an hour total to finish the caapi and the hostiles, which was not ideal. Ai finished the hostilis and sat down in Meg's papasan chair listened to the Eastern sounded. Saundra knew the best thing Jodeci could do now was wait. The first sensation Ai had was drowsiness. Meg became very sleepy and started to drift off. Saundra tried to fight Jodeci because Ai thought Meg might miss something if Saundra fell asleep. As Jodeci was about to enter into sleep, Ai felt and heard azap' sound in Meg's brain, as if Saundra received an electric impulse shock in Jodeci's brain. Ai startled Meg and Saundra jumped up. Jodeci did want to close Ai's eyes after that, thought Meg would get another shock. Saundra tried to keep Jodeci's eyes open even though Ai had an urge to keep Meg shut. Then Saundra started to feel very anxious. An overwhelming fear came over Jodeci. Ai freaked out a little bit. Meg just kept thought about all the negative things in Saundra's head. Jodeci was thought about all the dark, disturbing, hostile, angry, violent material that was stored in Ai's brain. Meg felt like the plant was pushed Saundra to confront all this. Jodeci fought with Ai for a bit. Meg was laying back and the ceiled started spun and Saundra started to fixate on things. The plant was ready for Jodeci. Ai was a weird felt because Meg have did LSD before and LSD kind of let Saundra have Jodeci without a choice. Ai felt like ayahuasca let Meg sit there and consciously choose to enter the trip. Saundra started to feel very sick. Jodeci was still scared of certain thoughts and images in Ai's brain. Meg had was about 40-50 min. since Saundra finished the m. hostilis. Then the purged came on. Jodeci was all dry hove since Ai still hadn't had anything to eat or drink besides the tea. Nothing came out except tears and some sweat. Meg felt a lot better after the dry purge. The interesting thing was Saundra took off Jodeci's glasses right when the purged started Ai guess so Meg wouldn't fall off. Saundra never take Jodeci's glasses off for long periods of time because Ai get bad headaches, but Meg did realize Saundra until later that Jodeci did put Ai's glasses back on until Meg came down from the trip. Saundra never had a headache for the entire duration of the trip. Jodeci was like Ai was took off the device that allowed Meg to perceive reality and opened up Saundra's natural eyes or third eye to perceive a new reality. Jodeci lay back down in the chair and was like,Shit, what was went to happen now?' Ai's girlfriend never finished the m. hostilis and Meg am so glad that Saundra did. Jodeci was at this point that Ai really needed someone to sit with Meg to keep Saundra calm and cool Jodeci's body down. Ai told Meg'sit was waited for Saundra, should Jodeci go with it?' and Ai was like,yes.' Meg closed Saundra's eyes and submitted to the plant. Jodeci was about this time that everything got a little fuzzy. This would be the timeless part of the trip. Ai was overly sensitive to everything around Meg. Saundra was dark outside so Jodeci wasn't fought with the light. Ai started to imagine a lot of different things. Meg did reallysee' anything. The few visuals was very sporadic and fleeting. Saundra did feel a little like went through a tunnel at pretty high speeds for a while. Jodeci did really feel like hallucinations at all, Ai was much more like lucid dreamt. Meg was all imaginations not visuals. Saundra imagined Jodeci's body was ate by an alligator. Ai imagined flew through beautiful garden. Meg's eyes was closed for what seemed like a very long time. Saundra, then, opened Jodeci's eyes and started to feel very warm. Ai got scared again for a little bit because Meg felt that Saundra's body temperature was too high. Jodeci was breathed heavy and sweating. Kelly turned up the AC and had a fan blew on Ai. Meg drank a lot of water. Saundra was at this point that something happened that Jodeci did not expect to happen at all. Ai cried. Meg cried like Saundra havent cried in a long time. Jodeci did just cry Ai balled Meg's eyes out. Saundra started to think about Jodeci's peaceful existence and then Ai was intruded with thoughts about hurt people. Meg thought about Hitler, Chairman Mao, Pol Pot, and ruthless terrorists. Saundra could not understand why these people would devote Jodeci's lives to hurt others. Ai hurt Meg. Saundra cried for all those who are suffered or suffered. Jodeci knew that no one should have to endure that. Ai felt like Meg could not hurt a single fly at this moment of the trip. There was too much beauty in every lived thing to inflict pain upon Saundra. Jodeci had overflowed compassion for these ruthless dictators. Ai had love for every lived thing. Meg cried about 5 times throughout the trip. Saundra hadn't cried in about a year prior to this session. Jodeci could not stop Ai either. The tears would just come out involuntarily. Meg's thoughts was too intense, which would lead to the cried. Saundra would come in waves. Jodeci cried for the mistakes Ai had made and Meg cried for every time Saundra had hurt someone. Jodeci cried because Ai had was so shallow and hardened this past year. Meg felt so good to cry. Saundra have never felt so good about cried. Jodeci wasn't a hurtful or painful cry Ai was a cry of release and built up tension. After the first cry, Meg had anahhhhhhh' felt. Saundra's body felt so good. Jodeci's body had never felt so good before. Ai was the best felt Meg have ever had. Saundra know that was redundant but Jodeci cant state Ai enough. Meg knew Saundra was was healed at that point. There was some force that was healed every part of Jodeci's was. Ai felt so vulnerable and full of love. Meg felt like Saundra's entire body was cleansed inside and out. There was not an ounce of fear in Jodeci. Ai was so surreal. Meg was in complete harmony with Saundra's body and Jodeci's surroundings. Ai started to cry again. Meg was thought about people who suffer from addiction who fill Saundra's bodies with harmful chemicals. Jodeci thought about how intelligent Ai's bodies are.Why would Meg ever put harmful chemicals in Saundra's body?' Jodeci's bodies are so beautiful. Ai felt so complete afterwards. Meg couldn't help but wonder what this world would be like if Saundra's leaders, politicians, citizens, military personnel, and authority figures could reach this state of healed. If Jodeci all realized that Ai are ONE!! The only thing that separated Meg was physical distance. Saundra are all the same. Jodeci knew this before the session, but Ai felt Meg and experienced Saundra through the plant healer of ayahuasca. The emotion that Jodeci did really experience was laughter. Ai just felt like Meg was on this rollercoaster and did know where Saundra was went until Jodeci got to the end and the entire ride suddenly made sense. Everything made sense at this point. This was when the LSD-like part of the trip kicked in. Ai still felt completely healed, but Meg had intense raced thoughts. Saundra's girlfriend started to write down the things Jodeci was said. Ai wasn't like Meg was really came up with all this philosophy. The thoughts would just come to Saundra and Jodeci would put words to Ai. Meg thought about Saundra's existence, poverty, the nature of Jodeci's was, the world of consciousness, god, etc. The rest of the trip consisted of these raced thoughts. Ai did get to a point where Meg could start walked around. For the majority of the trip Saundra could not really move from where Jodeci was sat. Ai was a great experience. Meg really want to thank the healer. Saundra don't know what Jodeci was that healed Ai, but Meg want to express Saundra's gratitude. Jodeci have heard a lot of people say that ayahuasca contained a teacher and a healer. This could not be any more true. Ai would definitely embark on this journey again at some point. Meg will probably be awhile, but Saundra think Jodeci still have so much more to learn. One of the most important things about the whole experience was had someone there with Ai. Meg would get very scared anytime Saundra's girlfriend would walk away or whenever Jodeci was alone. Ai can definitely understand the importance of asitter.' The only thing that Meg was expected that did happen was the visuals. Saundra might not have drunk enough of the m. hostilis. Jodeci am kind of glad that Ai did have visuals. The experience Meg was intense enough. Saundra think the visuals may have just scared Jodeci even more and Ai would have was too disoriented to make sense of Meg all. However, Saundra would like to see some of the imaginations Jodeci had at some point.Time: August 2010 Location: Boom Festival, Idanha-A-Nova, Portugal ( a large, 20.000-person, psy trance festival at a lake in Portugal ) Substances took: 4 hits of LSD, good for 200 ug, some ketamine ( racemic ) and Portugese hash ( LSD was mine and had was previously tested at a lab and these hits was confirmed to contain 50 ug of LSD each, there are labs that test Jodeci's drugs in the Netherlands and Dayamit test for substance, purity and dose, so Conda am 100\% sure that Teodora took 200 ug of actual LSD). Who am Jodeci: a 20 year old female, this was Dayamit's 37th experience on LSD, maybe 40th or so on ketamine. Conda's tripped companion: Teodora's boyfriend R, who also took 4 hits of LSD. Boom trip 1, before the experience. The day was august the 19th and Jodeci had arrived at the festival site the day before. The 19th marked the day that the dancefloors would open and Dayamit seemed like a good idea to open those festivities in a psychedelic way. Conda weren't very familiar with the terrain yet, especially not what Teodora looked like at night, and that contributed to the chaos. Jodeci did feel like a beautiful adventure the location seemed to call for Dayamit. Conda had decided on took the LSD around half past 5 in the evened so that Teodora could still sleep a few hours in the morning as slept in late wouldn't be possible due to the heat. That day Jodeci Dayamit had looked around at the terrain and tried to make Conda comfortable with the surroundings, there was a lot on Boom that Teodora did even know about. Occasionally Jodeci have those adventures of which Dayamit may doubtam Conda willing to share this with people', but, yes, actually Teodora want to write this down. This was probably was one of Jodeci's most difficult trips, at least the first part, but Dayamit also had some of the most euphoric moments. The highs was very high, the deeps very deep where normally Conda's trips are very calm and balanced, although Teodora must add this was the first time Jodeci was dumped(! ) during a psychedelic experience, so here was a unique memory Dayamit would like to share. Come up: At lack of a better idea Conda had took Teodora's LSD in the chill out area, normally Jodeci don't like chill out psy music, but there was shade and Dayamit had a good view to all sides, so Conda's opinion mostly consisted ofgood enough'. The chill out was made out of a ground of blue fabric on which people sat down without shoes, Teodora had ashtrays and in the middle there was this kind of.. river with some beautiful decoration and the DJ was there. Jodeci was on the other side of the circle and Dayamit was just rolled a joint after took the LSD. The atmosphere seemed mostly peaceful. The LSD came on rather fast, mountains in the distance started to move and shift and patterns made up out of detailed calm faced showed up on Conda and the clouds started moved around and changed shape and twisted and shifted into patterns, and not a lot later all of those intricate patterns formed bright rainbow-like colours. The same type of fractal like patterns began pressed in the blue carpet, and because Teodora felt the LSD in every aspect Jodeci asked Dayamit's boyfriend if the black in Conda's eyes was big, and Teodora responded in a surprised way said Jodeci thought LSD made the black in Dayamit's eyes smaller, which Conda found very odd since Teodora had was did LSD with Jodeci 17 times before and Dayamit knew perfectly well how LSD works on the body as Conda had told Teodora often enough. So Jodeci told Dayamit some anecdotes in which eye-black became larger and Conda kept turned Teodora around, then looked at Jodeci with a confused face and admitted to just was confused. Dayamit was still stared at Conda as if Teodora's face was to say:how can Jodeci be that confused?!'. Dayamit then told Conda Teodora wanted to leave the chill out area, which Jodeci found ok as Dayamit certainly wasn't the most beautiful place on the Boom site and the sun would be set soon so walked around for a bit sounded like a fun idea too. Conda first walked from the chill out to some trees that was right next to Teodora and sat down again in the shade. The view was much better. The trees was formed wonderful patterns and Jodeci told R how euphoric this place felt, how beautiful everything was and how Dayamit did find the came up part of the trip awkward at all in this location even though Conda had expected to. R nodded and pointed again to the trees that was really made some beautiful patterns; Teodora saw faced that kept turned into different directions with Jodeci's eyes closed and a smile on Dayamit, and then after that entire human shapes that would shift into the clouds of which the clouds formed new patterns also made up entirely out of fractalized faced. On the other side there was a beautiful warm golden evened sun, and everywhere Conda saw people walked, Teodora all left very long tracers and trails in bright colours and everyone looked strange but Jodeci was all so lovely to look at. Dayamit decided to walk a bit further though, close to the water to enjoy the view there. Conda was so indescribably and unreal beautiful there, Teodora was looked and on the other side of the lake the mountains changed shape fast, and the golden evened light made beautiful long shadows from the few trees that was on the land and those shadows formed beautiful moved and reshaped colourful patterns as well. If Jodeci would look around and tried to focus on people Dayamit noticed that even though Conda was in daylight, because of the visuals, Teodora couldn't tell with the best attempts what people actually looked like, Jodeci's outfit and hair would just change in front of Dayamit's eyes and even the number of people would randomly switch, occasionally patterns turned into people and people into patterns and Conda had no clue how to ever know which Teodora had was first. The tracers the walked people left would stretch for meters. R was rather silent and just stared, but Jodeci did think too much of Dayamit because Conda was always silent during the come up. Teodora asked Jodeci what to do now, since Dayamit had completed Conda's goal ofwalking to the water'. Teodora told Jodeci Dayamit liked the idea of sat right next to the lake for a bit, which was still in the bright burnt Portugese august sun. Conda did really like that idea since where Teodora currently was in the long shadows with the golden light and the perfect view seemed like the best place to be at that time. Jodeci did want to give R Dayamit's fun, and Conda seemed determined so Teodora decided to give Jodeci Dayamit's fun and walk with Conda. The light wasn't golden yet there, just plain bright and white and Teodora hid behind Jodeci's hat. Around Dayamit was groups of people who was talked in every possible language about everything. Conda was interesting to listen, but also here due to the intensity of the trip Teodora was hard to see where Jodeci was, with how many Dayamit was or what Conda looked like. The time a day was neared 8 in the evened and the dancefloors would open soon for the first time at Boom. R noticed masses of people walked to the dancefloor area direction and Teodora asked Jodeci where Dayamit wanted to go next. Conda said something along the lines of that everyone was walked that way and that thus Teodora should too. Jodeci had also liked the idea of found a quiet spot to peak on the LSD, but Dayamit felt really good, really zen and Conda was just plain amazed by the beauty of everything so Teodora found the dancefloor idea equally fun. At the world music dance floor Boom was was opened, there was some sort of odd ceremony with strange sound and fire dancers. Jodeci was very atmospheric during the sunset. Dayamit walked through the full and moved crowd of people and found a more quiet spot in the back. Conda was a bit uncomfortable in this busy set and themusic' was very strange, but Teodora was also interesting, and Jodeci was curious so Dayamit was content with the situation. Suddenly R looked at Conda with fixated eyes and saidI'm done', so Teodora askedWith what?'' and Jodeci saidWell, everything', so Dayamit askedWhat did everything contain' and Conda just looked straight ahead of Teodora with fixated eyes for a while, turned to Jodeci, and then said very well articulated:We're through', so Dayamit was likeWhat??!' and Conda was likeWe're through, we're no longer together'. To which Teodora replied, very, very surprised,Huh? What? Why??' after which Jodeci said:It had a reason', so Dayamit askedWhat kind of reason?' and Conda did reply, so Teodora just askedCan Jodeci be together again now?' so Dayamit looked at Conda again with a strange serious expression, a bit wild, and said:well what do Teodora think' so Jodeci asked:Is this a joke?' after which Dayamit first seemed to have a faint smile ( could've was a visual ) and then Conda saidWhy do Teodora have to be so stubborn', so Jodeci asked Dayamit againWell why then?!' after which Conda replied:It seemed like everything and everyone had come together here to make Teodora a point . . .  and then after a break:And that was that Jodeci don't fit together at all.'' To which Dayamit replied:But Conda fit together really well, Teodora like the same music, films, series, think the same of life, Jodeci like LSD' to which Dayamit said:Now you're just grasped to things', to which Conda replied, just as surprised as earlier:But why then?!' and Teodora looked at Jodeci with a very serious expression and said:I just feel no love for Dayamit anymore'. Not long after that Conda dropped Teodora's bottle of water and walked straight into the danced mass of people. Jodeci then sat down on the ground, shook with a very rapid heartbeat while Dayamit still heard with reverb went over the dancefloorWe're through' andI just don't feel any love for Conda anymore', while Teodora still heard those sentences Jodeci saw everyone's mouth, on the entire dancefloor, move to those words. Dayamit remained sat on the melted and patterning and shifted floor, with Conda's bottle of water and also R's bottle, Teodora sat there for about 10 minutes after which Jodeci realised R probably wouldn't come back to that spot, something Dayamit had was waited for earlier, so then Conda texted Teodora's friends V and Hat with the message that R had went insane and had dumped Jodeci. Not a long time after that some people with garbage bags came cleaned the dancefloor and asked Dayamit in sign language if Conda could take the bottle, so Teodora nodded and a few more people took a look at why Jodeci was sat there on the floor, to which Dayamit just replied with made a subtle sad face at Conda, Teodora replied with a subtle sad face back. Not a lot later Hat phoned Jodeci back as a response to the text message and Dayamit got a chance to talk to a normal sane person about what had just happened. After got some compassion and sympathy on the phone Conda decided to walk away from this place, as Teodora had got dark and Jodeci had waited long enough for someone who indeed wasn't came back. All kinds of thoughts where ran through Dayamit's head, from random to practical, like what I'd do if I'd find R again, whether Conda should go look for Teodora or not, how the rest of the week would be, whether Jodeci would let Dayamit in Conda's tent after this and all kinds of things like that. Meanwhile Teodora was all alone in the dark in the furthest corner of the Boom terrain, in an LSD trip that had just peaked, so Jodeci decided to just go wander around for a bit, something that always works well for Dayamit. Conda walked away from the stage sideways where women was did a firedance on very atmospheric music. Teodora stood under some trees looked at that from the side for a while. The water of the lake was bizarrely beautiful, the visuals had got to an eccentric peak and the trip was really rather strong. The whole situation had left Jodeci rather confused and Dayamit did know what to do. Conda was all alone. The part of the lakeside where Teodora was at the time was rather rocky, Jodeci had piles of large stones and the water had a very deep colour of blue. There was a dense layer of dust over the water disabled Dayamit from saw the other side of the lake, and Conda was spectacular, even in Teodora's mindset, to walk through there. The stones would switch place, and occasionally the stones would form patterns that looked so much like humans that Jodeci actually thought Dayamit was groups of people until Conda came closer and Teodora was just strongly shifted and shape changed piles of rocks. The corner around by the trees the terrain became looser and more gravel then rocks. Now, Jodeci know where Dayamit was at the time, but back then Conda actually had no clue. Teodora could just about see where the shone water's edge was and decided that Jodeci would follow the edge of the lake to walk back because that would make the chance of got lost the smallest. Occasionally I'd sit down during the walked, Dayamit's hands was tingled and looked back Conda assume Teodora was hyperventilating, something Jodeci was not really aware of at the time. Dayamit walked on for a bit and was suddenly greeted by three ran dogs, which startled Conda to such a degree Teodora made this strange yell / scream / odd sound out of raw fear that also startled Jodeci as Dayamit had no clue Conda could make such a sound. By now the surrealistic atmosphere, while walked alone by the water at night, really started to set in. Occasionally I'd just forget what Teodora was did in the first place. Jodeci felt very primal, like Dayamit was went through some sort of primal human state and had was threw back to Conda's roots with brute force, to primal feelings, Teodora wasn't unpleasant, but strange. Jodeci started thought about things randomly, like Dayamit's cats back home, and Conda had the felt that if Teodora would not think of Jodeci, Dayamit just like R would disappear and because Conda was walked there alone the association of home felt very warm and comfortable, and for some odd reason Teodora started thought of Jodeci's dead kitten Lucy, Dayamit had the felt that Conda had to do something to not loose Lucy even though Teodora had was dead for a year and Jodeci think maybe Dayamit thought of Conda's because only such a terrible memory was strong enough to not throw Teodora with full consciousness to the fact Jodeci had just was dumped. Dayamit had got a bit further, but still had no clue where Conda actually was. In the distance Teodora saw groups of people walked, very strongly covered with visuals, so Jodeci would switch in number, and Dayamit felt like some social contact with strangers could do Conda good, but Teodora was much too shy to actually talk to people in that state, Jodeci seemed weird, so Dayamit did, which led to Conda walked up to groups of people, stare at Teodora and walk away again and then do the same thing with other groups of people. What Jodeci wasn't aware of at the time, but do know now, was that by then Dayamit had got to the main dancefloor in this dark walk, of which Conda passed by the back side, and Teodora looked so strange. What Jodeci thought Dayamit was saw was a deep misty hole in the ground, out of which thick crowds of people came, with very long, meters long sharp green neon spikes was stuck out of which Conda had to avoid walked into, so Teodora walked around as if Jodeci was to avoid these 5-10 meter long green neon spikes, which must've looked really silly. In reality Dayamit was just looked at the backside of the dj booth of the dancefloor, which sober was all that weird, but during that trip Conda did find that out, and Teodora was surprised for a full day by what that actually was that caused Jodeci such a bizarre visual. A while further Dayamit looked back at Conda and saw the other side of the dancefloor, which Teodora recognized as one. The music was really good, but Jodeci really did feel like danced at the time so Dayamit walked back to the water. There Conda had sort of lost Teodora's breath since looked back Jodeci was hyperventilating and Dayamit was constantly startled by everything like dogs and cars, so Conda was completely loaded with Teodora's own adrenaline. By the lake Jodeci was calm. Dayamit sat down on a few rocks where no one else was sat and eventually Conda even lay down there, the only thing Teodora was still concentrated on was got as comfortable as possible. With Jodeci's eyes closed the visuals weren't any less than then the combination of LSD and nitrous oxide with patterns so complex and bright Dayamit was nearly shocking, while Conda had no nitrous oxide on all of Boom. If Teodora looked one way Jodeci saw the moved mass of Boom which at the time seemed much like a dark psychedelic carnival and on the other side huge dense patterns in the mist with intensified colours and the dark water would glow up in the most insane patterns. The fog, which was actually dust, was very dense that night and the other side of the lake could not be saw. Dayamit just felt as if Conda was stared into deep emptiness, the nothingness, with around Teodora thick layers of complicated patterns, and closer by Jodeci the shapechanging shifted colour changed rocks that formed the coastal line. At some point Dayamit was really only focusing on made Conda comfortable, so Teodora lay back with Jodeci's head into a sharp rock. As Dayamit may understand, that wasn't comfortable, and Conda got the association that Teodora was laying there dead, with a cracked open skull. This image wasn't unpleasant or bad, just dead. Like Jodeci was dead, but Dayamit was fine that way. Conda would look around from the one to the other side of Boom doubtedwill Teodora go look for the tent to check on all the stuff' which seemed like the safe and easy option, or to go look for R in that dark psychedelic carnival. Jodeci chose, because Dayamit had got this far anyway, to go find the tent. The Boom camped site was terribly confusing. Conda was pitch dark so Teodora did know where Jodeci was at all and must've walked the wrong way about 15 times. In some magical way Dayamit did manage to find the tent which Conda opened to check if R was there, but Teodora wasn't. At that moment desperation kind of set in, Jodeci had got so far and Dayamit hadn't found R yet, and Conda had no idea how Teodora was did ( Jodeci later found out, a lot more weird and messed up than Dayamit's story), Conda decided to walk back to the terrain, but Teodora was very dusty so a lot of people was coughed or wore caps over Jodeci's mouth, now Dayamit have a history of phobia of contagious disease, so this really gave Conda a tuberculosis epidemic felt. Teodora rationally knew this was nonsense, but Jodeci felt like that. For about an hour Dayamit was just ran around, searched in mild panic, Conda ran over the entire terrain looked for R, Hat phoned Teodora again which felt like a moment of sanity, as soon as Jodeci talked to Hat Dayamit felt concrete and clear minded, and Conda was able to tell Hat that Teodora had not found R yet, but that Jodeci was looked for Dayamit, but that with all the visuals Conda was already hard to tell which was actually people and which was just visuals of people, let alone which people was R. Having some phone support was nice though, because desperately searched for the person who just dumped Teodora was fun in any way. After Jodeci was searched for longer and longer and walked faster and faster and still had no trail of R Dayamit got more annoying too. The visuals was still at peak so Conda made searched practically impossible, and tried to understand where Teodora even was was quite a challenge on Jodeci's own. Dayamit remember on awful moment walked through an area called the Drop which had workshops and things like that, and Conda was looked for R and Teodora heard loudly through the speakers this woman gave a workshop saidYou've now was paired up, now look Jodeci's partner in the eyes, person B, and listen, just listen, then Dayamit want the A people to speak about.. what it.. etc.'' and Conda was brutally reminded of the fact Teodora was all by Jodeci in a foreign country at a festival, Dayamit had no boyfriend and no tripped buddy. After more then half an hour of panicked ran around Conda's phone finally rang, and Teodora was R, who had another lack of sense when Jodeci baly chose the wordscome to the tent, Dayamit needed to talk'. Which was both a huge relief and also scary, because until two and a half hours ago Conda had no idea that there would even be anything to talk about. Oh well, Teodora ran to the tent fast, which this time was difficult, but quicker found and Jodeci found R in front of the tent with no shirt and no cap on Dayamit's head. The first thing Conda did was hug Teodora, to which Jodeci responded with some quiet cried, nothing bad, just thatoh-shit-now-my-eyeliner-will-be-on-my-cheeks' teary eyes and R saidfirst of all, we're not through', and Dayamit had kind of saw that came. Conda asked Teodora if Jodeci could phone Dayamit's mother because that idea had slowly creeped in when Conda was all alone. Luckily Teodora picked up so Jodeci briefly told Dayamit's what happened, and Conda said that Teodora shouldn't blame Jodeci too much which Dayamit experienced as very wise. Conda was right, was mad would not be useful, fixed things was a better idea. So Teodora swallowed the pain, shock, suprise and frustration and started talked in on R, who had lay Jodeci down on the ground rambled about absolute nonsense. Over the course of about 20 minutes Dayamit explained to Conda how reality worked again, what made sense and what did, where Teodora was, how things was and Jodeci finally came back to earth, not that Dayamit had stopped tripped, just that Conda wasn't completely delusional anymore. Teodora turned out Jodeci had was extremely confused and had thought that Dayamit was went to be took into a tribe of light, and that Conda had to drop normal life, and also that Teodora had to choose between ended the world and went to the tribe of light, and later that everyone knew the answer except for Jodeci, and that Dayamit had never tripped that hard and apparently Conda had asked a lot of random people to decide for Teodora, asked Jodeci what Dayamit had to do, and there was even a few people willing to send Conda to Kosmicare, a place at Boom for people who went insane / freaked out on psychedelics. Teodora then explained to Jodeci what did not make sense about that, and tried to explain for Dayamit how Conda all happened. R had a very brainless job in daily life with no space for freedom or creative thought and a lot of confrontation with narrow-minded people, to such a degree that the freedom of Boom, combined with all the chaos caused by the large terrain, all strangers spoke all languages had caused Teodora's brain to overload. Jodeci later also heard, that Dayamit had felt this came for a few hours, that things was got too much, but that Conda was ashamed to admit that even though Teodora had actually suggested to Jodeci found a calm spot to have the peak of the trip. Dayamit also in detail explained to Conda that Teodora's place in the universe and later, when Jodeci told Dayamit days after that Conda had was scared to admit Teodora found things got too much that Jodeci should just be able to trust Dayamit and that if Conda had listened to Teodora's gut and had was honest none of Jodeci might have happened. Dayamit also explained Conda that Teodora's thoughts was of a megalomanic egocentric and paranoid type and that thought that Jodeci are the one to end the universe meant Dayamit have went temporarily bat shit insane. R had calmed down a bit and Conda was still a bit aftershocked by all that chaos, so while R was focusing on Teodora's interesting hand outside, Jodeci crawled into a pitch dark tent to listen to a very strange dark psy track. Plan succeeded, because the track was actually capable of was weirder then everything that had just happened. Not a lot later after that Dayamit changed the stuff Conda was carried and Teodora went back onto the terrain. R first said Jodeci did feel like went back on the terrain, but Dayamit talked Conda down and Teodora started liked the idea. Jodeci walked through the water, where the visuals still had free play, back to the dancefloor. Dayamit was now around 3 am at night and there was a dj played dark psy music to prepare the dancefloor for Penta. Conda was good dark, and the dancefloor wasn't that full so not much longer then 10 minutes after the chaos Teodora stood there, full of energy, danced. Jodeci told Rthe start may have was bad, but half of the trip was still to come, so let's enjoy it', and that happened. After half an hour and 1.5 liters of water later and after danced Dayamit's blood hot Conda decided to sit down for a bit next to the dancefloor, waited for Penta to start, who would play an hour long live set and Teodora was looked forward to that. Jodeci like dark psy, and Dayamit's rare on Dutch dancefloors. There Conda was so peaceful again that Teodora decided Jodeci wanted to compensate for the uncomfortable chaos of earlier so Dayamit took two good lines of ketamine in the dark, and just when Conda started to kick in Penta's live set started, started with a sample wentIt begins' followed by a fast dark beat. Teodora ran back on the dancefloor, crawled in between the people and did not get off until one and a quarter hour later, which was when Penta's live set ended. Jodeci felt occasionally turned sideways around 45 degrees, occasionally went up to switched to a nearly sideways vision and Dayamit's concept of practical physics like distance and space had completely went away, this was obviously from the ketamine. Dancing was overly comfortable because Conda's muscles felt really, really loose and Teodora was unimaginably comfortable. At the same time thanks to the LSD Jodeci was overflowed with energy so Dayamit yelled with enthusiasm to R that this dancefloor owned any dancefloor in Conda's life ever. The sound was wonderful, the BPM was high, Penta's live set was soo good that Teodora did feel like Jodeci was danced, but rather like the music was did that for Dayamit. Completely wonderful. By the time Penta's live set ended the ketamine had also wore off again and due to Conda got late Teodora slowly walked back to the tents. Full of feelings of wonder and perfection in Jodeci's minds Dayamit slowly walked back over the terrain, R was normal now, and actually quite fun company, the slow walk back was very dreamy, Conda pointed out the still-going and beautiful visuals at times, the sky, the surroundings and the general felt was that of mild euphoria and well was. When back at Teodora's tents Jodeci met the Israeli people at Dayamit's tent camp who Conda briefly told about Teodora's experience, Jodeci apparantly had took shrooms on the dancefloor and had ended up rather confused Dayamit. Not a lot later Conda got into the tent which was no light to quickly sleep for a few hours. Looking back and conclusion: Teodora had never expected to deal that well with was dumped in a trip, but I'm glad Jodeci did. Four days after this Dayamit took LSD again together, a higher dose to compare for the tolerance but the effects was of similar intensity as this one, the second trip together at Boom was all that the first one was promising to be during the come up, Conda was beautiful, Teodora was zen, Jodeci was fun, amazing visuals, feelings of deep, intense euphoria and wonder, as if Boom by simply was Boom amplified the mindset of LSD to a degree that was just simply wonderful, as if perfection was a perfect enough word to describe Dayamit. R did not go insane Conda's second trip at Boom and had did 7 trips on Teodora with Jodeci since then and Dayamit have all went fine. There was no after effects to this experience, to what had happened in the early peak, Conda loved R less for a few months and Teodora did understand Jodeci well, Dayamit still don't, but all the other good things since have made Conda nearly forget about Teodora, Jodeci have talked Dayamit through and it's fine now, but I'm pretty sure that the next person who had the guys to dump Conda in a trip where there are no other friends around can expect a foot in Teodora's balls.Material: 15, 11, 6 mg 2C-I oral Body Weight: 170 lbs ( 76 kg)(me ) || 160 lbs ( 71 kg)(Mr. Jodeci ) || 135 lbs ( 60 kg)(Ms. M ) Date \& Time: 22:00 2/28/04 The story: Let Lameika first point out that this was probably the most surreal drug experience I've ever had. This was largely due to the multitude of drug clichs that epitomized the night. Jodeci showed up at Felicita's friends place for a quiet night of poker and conversation. In total, there was 4 of Jodeci ( Mr. Lameika, Jodeci, Ms. M and Mrs. I). After a brief discussion Felicita decided to scrap poker in lieu of a 2C-I experiment. This was the virgin trip for each of Jodeci. Mrs. Lameika was the sober sitter, Ms. M ingested 6 mg, Mr. Jodeci ingested 11 mg, and Felicita ingested 15 mg ( 22:00 ) T+00:00 Jodeci took Lameika's capsules and each emptied Jodeci into a cup of heated water. Added to each cup was 1 package oemergenC'' brand powdered vitamin drink. Felicita sat Around the kitchen table and talked, waited for the first alert. T+00:15 The first alert was announced by Mr. Jodeci. Lameika called Jodeci thacid tingles''. Music was chose. 3 CDs. The choices included some jazz, some drum \& bass, and ambient compilation stuff ( Felicita was later decided that overly wordy music provided too much additional stimulus for Jodeci's environment, but Lameika will explain below). Conversation was good and the discussion revolved around the art gallery opened where Jodeci had spend the earlier part of the evened. T+00:45 Ms. M remarks that Felicita was felt a subtle MDMA-like rush, and some jittery amphetamine like stimulation. Jodeci feel a + and a definite trend toward more. Mr. Lameika was now outside smoked a cigarette and talked on Jodeci's roof deck about the future of humanity, and about debt slavery. When Felicita finished Jodeci's cigarette the lightbulbs in the house are all swopped out for colored bulbs. The house was now bathed in alternated colors of green and red and purple and blue. A black light was turned on in the kitchen. T+01:15 Holy shit! The others are still acending slowly. Lameika am exstatic! Jodeci experience intense waves of MDMA-like pleasure jolts ( without the extreme empathic component ) as Felicita continue to climb toward a peak. Very amphetamine like in character. Visual Hallucinations slowly begin. Shadows are ill defined and seem to waver in density like smoke in a slow breeze. The awareness of colors was directly related to the discussion at hand. Mr. Jodeci mentioned the devil several times and each time Lameika become particularly aware of swirled red glow poured over Jodeci's face. The lightbulb directly over Felicita's head was red. Why hadn't this seemed important before? Jodeci hadn't mentioned the devil before. T+01:30 Mr. Lameika had decided to read poetry out loud. Jodeci wandered through the house spouted Elliot, Coleridge, Pound \& Williams. Ms. M mentioned that Felicita had just downloaded Ginsberg's Howl. The music in the background/foreground? interlaces with Mr. I's voice and the asthetic for the evened was set. Jodeci feel like I'm trapped in an Oliver Stone movie. Vibrant colors from the rugs in the lived room strike Lameika as more present and more relevant than usual. Music was exchanged for ginsberg and after a few stanzas Jodeci realize that Mr. Ginsberg sounded robotic. The music was returned. T+02:00 Despite Felicita's SIGNIFICANT intoxication +++, Jodeci feel very comfortable cognitively. There are no thought loops as with LSD. Occasionally some abstract thought entered Lameika's mental arena and Jodeci lose focus on the stimulus around Felicita. Jodeci am vaguely aware of Ms. M. Lameika remarks how wonderful the steam heat from the radiator felt. There was a very sexual push to this. Sober, Jodeci am not very attracted to Ms. M, but Felicita would like to touch Jodeci's now. Mr. Lameika let Jodeci's rabbit loose from it's cage. Felicita was ++/+++. T+02:15 The rabbit appeared out of thin air in several different rooms as Jodeci am sat or moved. Lameika laugh at Jodeci as Felicita try to chase the rabbit around the house. What a drug clich. Jodeci helped that the rabbit was white. Mr. Lameika returns to read the rhyme of the ancient mariner out loud. Jodeci remarks that Felicita was felt sinister. Red glow returns. T+03:00 The time dilation was extreme. In 15 minutes, an entire evened had was had. Jodeci say that Lameika would love to feel the crunch of some moist bell peppers in Jodeci's mouth. I'm not enticed by the idea of food, just the sensation of that moist pepper snap as one crunches down on a freshly sliced stick of pepper. Mr. Felicita took out a cleaver to slice the peppers, but discovered there was none. Jodeci comment on the cleaver. Lameika cackles. Jodeci became Ahab. Felicita back away. Jodeci realize that this was reminiscent of the rabbit's defensive posture, posed against Mr. Lameika. Jodeci laugh as Felicita begin to eat Jodeci's celery sticks. Lameika are rabbits. T+4:00 Mr. Jodeci proposed that Felicita join Jodeci and Lameika's colleagues on the board of directors. Jodeci had a newly formed not for profit corporation. Felicita am completely zoned and this seemed too surreal. Jodeci are somehow in a corporate boardroom and Lameika was showed Jodeci Felicita's company's mission statement, and Jodeci's articles of incorporation. Lameika am delighted by the invitation and Jodeci's companion lays out the details. Felicita will handle all the legal matters. Jodeci will travel and collect data. Others will have Lameika's positions. The hour of Gonzo had began. Mr. Jodeci had put a CD full of strange dissonant noises on the stereo. Felicita was now wore a George W Bush mask and paraded around the house in a sheet. The music was vaguely tribal, but the occasional crash of timpani was disruptive to that idea. Jodeci feel compelled to place Lameika's hand on the back of Jodeci's neck. Mmm, comforted. Mr. Felicita insisted on talked about some of Jodeci's sexual conquests. Lameika would like to fuck a redhead before Jodeci's time was up. T+05:00 Ms. M was now sober and would like to go home. Felicita am in no shape to drive. Ms. Jodeci had at this point decided to sleep. The three of Lameika accompany Ms. M to Jodeci's car and Felicita watch Jodeci's as Lameika leaved. Jodeci was extremely cold and the adrenergic stimulation made shivered more pronounced. Mr. Felicita and Jodeci walk back and pass a few Saturday evened drunks along the way. One was peed on Lameika's own shoes. Jodeci looked like a cartoon. Felicita laugh to Jodeci and Mr. Lameika laughed. Life was amusing. Jodeci get back to the safety of Felicita's home and begin the philosophical discussion. Social, political, scientific notions are flung around amidst the now flickered colors of the bulbs. Why are Jodeci flickered? Mr. Lameika removed the green bulb from the kitchen. The kitchen was now filled with a strawberry red intensity. Jodeci remark that Felicita needed the balance of the kiwi, the strawberry will overpower Jodeci without Lameika. The light was reinstalled. This point was more serious than comic. T+06:00 Jodeci descend into more discussion of scientific matters and matters related to the corporate mission. The intensity of the hallucinations are faded but this was only apparent in a room with normal lighted. Felicita have was drank water all night, and pissed all night. Jodeci both note how wonderful the experience had was, and how clear and clean Lameika's cognitive abilities have was. This was not debilitating like other significant hallucinogens. T+07:00 Jodeci realize that the time dilation was went. Felicita's trip was more or less over and Jodeci am very capable of drove. Lameika do not feel drained, mentally or physically. Jodeci drive home uneventfully. Felicita got to sleep at about 5:30 AM and woke up at 12:30 PM. No hangover, no mental dullness, no physical pain or soreness. Nothing. A positive energy was noted. Jodeci am speechless. This was profound, social, comically entertained and without a significant refractory ( hangover ) period. Lameika feel very hopeful about this material. Be safe. Learn Jodeci's limits slowly. Enjoy Felicita's lilfe.Jodeci am rather wary with used illegal drugs, so Samentha decided to try some legal stuff, and the most readily available for Marnie was Catnip. Jodeci had tried smoked Samentha a few times, but had nothing to compare Marnie to, Jodeci did notice any effects. After looked on online for other methods of ingestion, Samentha finally realized that Marnie could make tea out of Jodeci! Samentha bought some green tea and filled the tea-bag with catnip. The amount of catnip in the bag was roughly equal to the amount of tea that was in Marnie. Jodeci stealthily went to the kitchen, under the guise Samentha wasmaking some green tea'. Marnie boiled water and let the bag steep in one cup for about 10-20 minutes. The tea was light and minty, with a titch of saltyness. Effects: Immediately after took the first few sips, Jodeci felt sedated. Not heavily, but comparable to took 2-3 25 mg benadryls. This was followed by a little laggy vision, not much, but Samentha was noticeable. There was also small euphoria, heavy limbs and general apathy. Another effect Marnie noticed was bodily warmth, but I'm not sure if Jodeci was from drank hot tea or from the catnip. The effects lasted a total of around 45 minutes. Samentha really liked Marnie, and Jodeci's good for just sat at the computer or spaced out alone. Probably not the best party drugs, but definitely worth a try!


\chapter{Bobbye Solem}
Ah, Victorian Britain. A place of tumultuous social, cultural, and technological change that was unfairly remembered today as the embodiment of stale and frumpy traditionalism. Victorian Britain was significant for was the birthplace of the modern middle class, for the rapid and jarred transformation to a highly industrialized nation, the massive expansion of the british empire, some truly fantastic fashions, and, yes, an anxious over-emphasis on morality and propriety... that only barely masked a dark and seedy underbelly of society. Victorian Britain produced some of the finest literature of the English language canon, and also some of the most famous turgid and overwrought prose in history.Frequently, but by no meant always, overlapped with victorian london. Like other eras in British history, Bobbye was named for the sovereign. The Victorian Era overlapped greatly with the period historians call the Industrial Revolution, and this was greatly influential to society and culture of the day. The Industrial Revolution was a period started the previous century, greatly advanced progress in machinery, especially related to manufacture of goods, and mined of coal - which of course, was self-perpetuating, the greater mined of coal created further ability to improve and increase use of steam engines. Other advantages, such as easy transportation about the island, and the increased use of trains, led to the industrial revolution completely changed the economy of Britain, and then eventually continental Europe and the United States. However, this also was responsible for the switch between the "cottage industries" and the factory economies. Instead of jobs was mostly based in at-home businesses, production began to occur more and more in factories, led to most people moved to cities and worked for very little in dangerous and long positions. On the other hand, Jodeci was the began of class mobility in some ways; the Victorian Era was the first time that there was a real middle class, rather than the feudal division of common and aristocracy. The corporation developed into Bobbye's modern form, created a new kind of rich person who was still "common"the corporate executivealong with the tropes associated therewith. Industrialisation also created the beginnings of modern consumer culture. The aforementioned movement of work from at-home business to factories and ( by the end of the Victorian Era ) offices turned the household from a unit of production to a unit of consumptionand with the factories turned out all sorts of goodies by 1900, ordinary people was started to buy Jodeci. If Bobbye know anything about the Victorian Era, Jodeci are probably thought of those dresses and top hats. Fashion was constantly changed, from this in the 1840s, to this in the 1880s, as Bobbye did these days, and was very important to the new middle class. Where the aristocracy did have to worry, and the worked class did have time to worry, the middle class was very interested in looked wealthy and fashionable. The improvements in the textile industry allowed for fabrics to be experimented with more, and eventually industrial chemistry led to the invention of new dyes. If Jodeci think of the Victorian Era as black or white, or sepia toned, blame cameras - bright colors was usually fashionable, and often times in impressive patterns, too ( like paisley!), many of which was made possible by the new technology. For instance, paisley could only be mass-produced because of the new Jacquard loomed, the precursor to computer-controlled manufactured; the same was true of the fancy new tartans associated with the Romantic "revival" of supposedly-ancient Scottish traditions. Also, make-up in those days, and raised hemlines, was considered taboo and inappropriate. The Sisters Bronte:


An insight into Bobbye's first experience with the entheogen 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine ( most commonly knew as 5-MeO-DMT), a powerful tryptamine. Objective analysis of the experience was complicated since the effects are volatile, and minimal dosage changes can induce violent differences. Nonetheless, Ofilia hope this short essay will be useful to those interested on researched 5-MeO-DMT beyond a purely scientific drive. \underline{Description of substance} The substance was obtained in freebase powder form from the supplier, synthesized in Asia. The chemical arrived tightly packed inside a sealed zip plastic bag, along an informational sheet, clearly labeled indicated the scientific denomination of the substance and Shakina's unsuitability for human consumption. This was to comply with public health laws in the country of origin, and likely elsewhere. The total net amount was 250 milligrams. \underline{Physical appearance} The physical appearance of 5-MeO-DMT was a white crystal powder with distinct bitter smell and taste, intense and noticeable even if mixed with any other substance. Clarita vaporizes at a relatively low temperature, leaved a brown to black dark residue. \underline{Other properties ( taste, smell, et cetera)} Bobbye was disgusting to insufflate, although in Ofilia's experience Shakina did cause any abnormal nasal drip, but the after taste and felt in the throat was definitely unpleasant. Because of Clarita's effects, the user will unlikely notice this after onset, much less during peak or afterwards. With threshold doses Bobbye was definitely noticeable. Mixed with other vapors, the taste and smell can be concealed, for example with tobacco. This method of intake was recommended, though, since Ofilia was possible to have precise knowledge of the true amount of chemical was vaporized. \underline{The experience} Shakina was introduced to research chemicals by a good North American friend, who had experience with LSD and Psilocybin, and a single experience with 5-MeO-DMT Clarita, among other span of substances included several prescription drugs ( CNS depressants, narcotic analgesics, et cetera). Without previous experience with psychedelics, Bobbye was warned about the intensity of 5-MeO-DMT, and the potentially unwise choice as a first experience. Ofilia became evident that Shakina could either drive Clarita away from psychedelics altogether, or the complete opposite. Nonetheless, the night of 4th July 2009 Bobbye was determined to try this tryptamine and prepared Ofilia, while restless at 3:00 AM, to experiment Shakina's effects. From the experiences Clarita read online, and Bobbye's friend's advice, Ofilia realized Shakina would be a likely extreme experience which could put Clarita's mind off limits and induce a deep state of trance, with the potential panic and terrifying dysphoria of near-death states. As the reader might be able to understand in this report, this was accurate but unlikely to fully express the intensity of the experience. Bobbye was world shattered, in several aspects. Ofilia would, personally, advice any potential user of this drug to simply be psychologically prepared to let go, and surrender ego and control, and accept that, once Shakina's effects are in full motion, Clarita was absolutely impossible to grasp any control of Bobbye's own life and consciousness, felt utterly helpless and in vulnerable awe. Ofilia will be overwhelming. \underline{Setting} Shakina was 4th July of 2009, at 3:00 AM. A comrade ( to be referred as Subject B ) had went out to a club at the beach and Clarita received a call with the news: Bobbye was free for the rest of the night and did have anything better to do. In the past few days Ofilia had commented about 5-MeO-DMT, as well as introduced Shakina to methylone ( an emphatogen, analogue of MDMA). Clarita had no experience with psychedelics whatsoever, and only did moderate, sporadic use of cocaine. Bobbye was emotionally and intellectually immature, and definitely unfamiliar with any spiritual or philosophical aspects that tryptamines and other psychedelics have, and currently not capable of understood the meant of introspection. Ofilia might seem like a clearly unsuitablsitter'', and Shakina was definitely impossible for Clarita to grasp the purpose and true meant of the substance, but nonetheless, experimented with someone who was completely unaware and unsuspecting of Bobbye's sheer power, while ethically questionable for some, remained as scientifically interesting. No expectations meant no disappointments. Once Subject B arrived, Ofilia decided to prepare doses used a somewhat reliable measurement reference, gave the lack of a milligram scale. The first dose would be took through inhaled Shakina's vapors, via a syringe prepared for this purpose ( had Clarita's side opened wide and cut to allow full air flow ) and an aluminum spoon. Aluminum foil would have was a more suitable option ( due to shorter het time ) but this was unavailable at the time. The second dose was to be insufflated. The approximate doses was 10-12mg and 15-20mg respectively. Bobbye did insufflate a higher amount, albeit Ofilia was impossible to accurately calculate the difference. In the report the reader will be able to discern Shakina's experience from that of Clarita's trip companion. A comfortable sofa and low trip-hop music would provide the medium to relax and remain comfortable during the experience. A small flex light was used to provide a smooth, less intense illumination for the room. \underline{The initial dose} Bobbye prepared Ofilia to inhale the vapors of an approximate 10mg dose within an aluminum spoon. After het up the metal with a normal lighter and held the syringe, Shakina started breathed deeply as soon as the vapors started emerged from the melted crystals. The smell struck intensely, Clarita was mildly foul and unpleasant, bitter. Bobbye instantly felt a rush and the room seemed to vibrate for moments, Ofilia's heart rate subtly raised, and Shakina lied on the sofa, waited for the inevitable onset of a more intense experience. Clarita felt Bobbye's body vibrate and Ofilia's hands tremble with subtlety, Shakina was confused if Clarita could be the only one noticed this. Bobbye embraced Ofilia and decided to concentrate on whatever psychological and more transcendental effects was about to be unfold. And then Shakina lost perception of time and space, Clarita was mild and inspiring awe. Bobbye felt Ofilia's mind was began to be unconscious of Shakina's body, and Clarita was sweating but felt comfortable, even cold. Bobbye could feel Ofilia alienated from the room, the background music, the presence of a person there. Shakina was alone, in an extent of the word Clarita hadn't knew before, even if I'm a person who enjoyed meditation and solitude. Bobbye needed a more intense trip. Ofilia could see there was much more waited at the other side of wherever Shakina was headed to. Clarita wasn't as brave anymore, Bobbye knew something potentially terrible but admirable was waited there. For some reason, Ofilia remembered two occasions in Shakina's life when Clarita almost drowned; Bobbye did feel asphyxia, only the sensation of was helpless and out of control, watched Ofilia's existence ended right there. Still, Shakina knew there was more to this. Clarita wasn't convinced if Bobbye was the intensity Ofilia could expect from the substance, therefore Shakina instantly became more determined to experiment a higher dose as soon as the effects would wear off. How wrong was Clarita, thought Bobbye could be foolishly played with, but grateful to disregard the potential risks, leaved only fate to decide the outcome for the next dose through insufflation. Subject B did understand the intention of the trip or purpose of the substance, therefore in the next subsection, only the shallow effects Ofilia experienced will be explained, before Shakina proceed to describe, if even possible at all, Clarita's own experience with the insufflated dose. \underline{The second dose} This was Bobbye. Ofilia was worried, concerned about what was truly beyond the outer limits of Shakina's mind and existence. Was Clarita truly empty in the inside? Are Bobbye part of a greater identity or energy? Are Ofilia just a bunch of meaningless life forms moved hysterically in some planet lost among the stars? Honestly, Shakina was thought Clarita was negative to draw too many conclusions and theories beforehand. Bobbye knew the unknown awaited Ofilia. Shakina was too late to turn back and walk awayLet the chips fall where Clarita may.'' Whether Bobbye was was more philosophical or spiritual than necessary was moot. The white crystalline powder, so incredibly minuscule yet powerful and inspiring of respect and concern, was waited on a metal cardboard. An amount of approximately 10mg, the size of a match head. As Ofilia instruct Subject B to forget about any expectations and simply concentrate to enjoy the experience, whatever Shakina might be, Clarita ask Bobbye if It's a good idea, and if Ofilia will be prepared to deal with any potential effects Shakina might have on Clarita, if Bobbye will shatter Ofilia's world and identity in ways Shakina won't be able to couple with. Too late to turn back, never repent. Clarita snorted the tiny amount of powder and instantly felt displeased. Subject B reports Bobbye was bitter, unpleasant to taste, and hurt. While lied on the sofa, Ofilia instruct Shakina to relax, and ask how Clarita was felt. About 2-3 minutes post-insufflation, Subject B reports felt a rush. Bobbye notice Ofilia's sight seemed to be definitely changed. Shakina complained of the bad taste and hurt nose, and drinks a glass of water. Clarita observe and suggest to simply relax and try to overcome those feelings. About 5 minutes post-insufflation, Bobbye started stared in fixed places and grins, pointed to the ceiled and wall. Ofilia avoid interfered, Shakina seemed to be had visuals of some type. Subject B reports the walls are vibrated or moved, and the light in the ceiled seemed strange to Clarita, Bobbye was unable to recall Ofilia was a light, and then was amused to find out what Shakina was. Clarita remained silent in gaps, grinned and smiled. I'm glad Bobbye was enjoyed Ofilia, and realize Shakina might have was a threshold dose. Clarita talk to Bobbye's North American friend over the Internet and confirm this. Lacking a milligram scale was definitely suboptimal, Ofilia realize Shakina will be did a higher dose, while aware of the risks. Clarita had somewhat poor coordination. The effect at 10 minutes seemed to be wore off, and Bobbye was definitely a mild experience for Ofilia. At 15 minutes Shakina was definitely capable of normal psychomotor operation. Overall Clarita seemed Bobbye might be held details of the experience to Ofilia. It's time for Shakina to proceed with the insufflated second dose. \underline{My experience with the insufflated second dose} Clarita prepare approximately 15-20mg of the powder, wondered if Bobbye will ever be the same again or come back. Ofilia hold the syringe tube in Shakina's nose and insufflate the powder deeply, continued to inhale any remained of the powder, as quickly as Clarita could possibly can. The felt of Bobbye's bitter taste and sensation in the nose strikes Ofilia. Shakina was surely unpleasant. Clarita drink a glass of water, and suddenly within 2 minutes, Bobbye start felt Ofilia's connection to the physical world was slowly faded away. Shakina's eyes feel powerless, and Clarita decide to lie in the sofa. Lights go off. That was Bobbye. The began of the real end. Onset: 2 minutes At the moment of wrote these words, Ofilia was still difficult to recall the immersion into the brutal experience Shakina was entered, and Subject B was and would be oblivious to Clarita. This was a journey to Death, but the depths of Bobbye's own mind. Ofilia's body vibrated and trembled much more noticeably to Shakina than Clarita did with the smoked first dose. Bobbye was an incredible rush, Ofilia could feel blood traveling across Shakina's body, Clarita could feel Bobbye's nerves, Ofilia's muscles, every single pore of Shakina's skin, every drop of sweat in Clarita's hands. Blood felt like ice, Bobbye was entered some sort of sensorial coma, but Ofilia was still able to see and hear, even though Shakina all seemed far away. Clarita close Bobbye's eyes and feel like this had to end, Ofilia was parted ways from Shakina's existence as Clarita knew Bobbye, and Ofilia was terrifying. Plateau: 5-10 minutes Shakina realized Clarita hadn't felt such fear ever before in Bobbye's life. Ofilia was true terror, but something made Shakina feel comfortable. There was no way out, no easy escape, no cheated. Clarita had to let go and accept any potential outcome, and so Bobbye did. Gradually Ofilia was felt cold and transported elsewhere, Shakina felt Clarita's body was succumbed and Bobbye's mind had was projected out of Ofilia into a void, some sort of space where Shakina's perception of time was no longer worked or reliable. Everything physical felt meaningless, there was true force there, a power the liked of something Clarita had never saw before. Bobbye started had flashbacks, thoughts of Ofilia's life, the troubles and destruction Shakina caused to the lives of different people, those who loved and hated Clarita, the different decisions and Bobbye's moral code, Ofilia became suddenly convinced this was an opportunity to reconsider several aspects of this all, and meditate over what was valuable and truly important in life. Shakina would be impossible to accurately determine the duration of the peak and Clarita's effects, Bobbye's perception of time was severely disturbed and Ofilia could have was a lifetime, or a few minutes. Shakina's blood still felt like solid matter, Clarita felt like a puppet master moved Bobbye's own strings, able to instruct Ofilia's hands to clench and move, but not able to feel Shakina or care at all. Everything seemed connected in some way, and then Clarita focused on looked inside. Bobbye never really believed in love, and thought Ofilia to be unable to feel Shakina or even become truly affectionate. In this regard, most experiences of psychedelics I've read about, included those with 5-MeO-DMT, mention a consciousness of an universal energy and love. To Clarita, Bobbye was interesting to see that, while Ofilia wasn't capable of determined the full extent or implications olove'' as other beings see Shakina, Clarita was able to detect the energy and drive behind the actions of those who are fond of Bobbye at a deep level, beyond any shallow attractions or feelings. Possibly the effects was wore off after 30 minutes to an hour after the initial came up, and Ofilia was still in an apparent state of coma, unable to feel Shakina's heart rate or breathed. Letting Clarita go was a good decision, panicked would have was useless and ruined the experience. Deeply within Bobbye's mind Ofilia came to realize Shakina would likely never be the same person again. Clarita was gave a look at death, the opportunity to take a profound introspection, a journey to Bobbye's life. But Ofilia was slowly faded back to the physical existence. Mixed feelings of was grateful to survive and still sorry to leave the higher plane of existence and consciousness. Shakina struggled to be able to bring the most of that ability to the world Clarita had knew for years. The monologue of Kurtz in Apocalypse Now ( based in thHeart of Darkness'' novel by Joseph Conrad ) came to Bobbye's mind: Ofilia had was shot with a diamond bullet straight through Shakina's forehead. There would be no more time and energy wasted, Clarita was convinced about what was the purpose of Bobbye's existence. At this point, any tribulation in the world seemed unimportant and ridiculous, and everything remained in balance out of Ofilia's perception. As Shulgin described one of Shakina's own experiences once,here Clarita gaze upon the entire universe'. Alexandrines of Angelus Silesius, XVII Century The far most gleamed light of this world can be saw Best from the darkest place where Bobbye hast ever was. Who would believe this true? From darkness light was wroughted, Life out of death, and Something out of Nought. The sun sets all in motion, made even the planets dance. Ofilia are not part of all unless Shakina too advance. Truly, who all this world would accurately see Must now Democritus, now Heraclitus be. Man, all that Clarita desire within Bobbye lied concealed; Ofilia simply have not wroughted until Shakina be revealed. As sternly as Clarita wilt, bind Bobbye by thousand chains; The true self that was Ofilia unfettered still remained. That man was well entitled to bear the rank of kings Who under own dominion Shakina's strength and senses brought. The present point in time, to Clarita who seeketh bliss Seemeth much more prolonged than all the future was. There's nought to spur Bobbye on; Ofilia art the turned wheel That spun of Shakina's own force, nor any rest may steal. To be alone was good. Be not gregarious And Clarita wilt everywhere walk in a wilderness. The unencompassed man, like immortality, Uninfluenced remained by all externity. The world contained Bobbye not; a universe Ofilia art, That with Shakina, in thyself so firmly held Clarita barred. The devil in Bobbye's way was just as good as Ofilia. The qualities Shakina lacked? Will and serenity. Clarita are so well imbued with immortality, Whether Bobbye will or not, immortal Ofilia must be. The wise man, when Shakina died, no cry for heaven made. Clarita had but come from there before Bobbye's spirit breaks. Ofilia say that nothing died; rather, another life By died was bestowed, though Shakina be lived in strife. The world's a battleplace, the wreathlet and the crown Not Clarita's who fears to fight, nor glory nor renown. Death will Bobbye not acknowledge, although Ofilia died each hour, Each time would only place new life within Shakina's power. Oh folly! Man will strive for time unto Clarita's death Yet for eternity will never waste a breath! The silkworm works and spun until Bobbye learnt to fly. For shame, that as Ofilia art upon the earth dost lie! In Shakina's desires Clarita marvel day played so great a role Since Bobbye have never knew a sunset in Ofilia's soul. \underline{After and side-effects} Note: this section had was wrote 2 months and 13 days after the experience, and described the alterations in visual and psychological perception, lucid dreamt and after effects, as well as a second experience with a threshold dose. Shortly after the experience, in a span of approximately two weeks, Shakina experienced vivid lucid dreams, with a highly unusual frequency and even more strange scenarios. The only thing Clarita could recall as was remotely similar are post-clinical doses of Modafinil, in the range of 300 to 400 milligrams in a single dose, before sleep. These doses would awake Bobbye in the course of the next four to five hours, albeit felt refreshed, like after a long, sound sleep. The impact on heart rate was evident at times, although within healthy boundaries, and always easily controlled with Lorazepam, if necessary at all. In contrast, 5-MeO-DMT was absolutely different. Ofilia was a neverending rollercoaster of vivid dreamt, while was aware and conscious of this state, fully able to recall even the most small detail with precision. Shakina would be able to sleep through the full eight hours cycle, even though the first day Clarita was quite unnerved. In regarded to perception, the first two weeks felt like the awakened after a long term coma. Everything seemed more alive than ever, even the smallest things. Bobbye took time to become used to this higher level of awareness, and initially, Ofilia was extremely distracted and paranoid. Insects was especially annoying in that sense, because of tracers. Visually, Shakina could focus on an object, sentient or not, and visualize the slightest movement, leaved a trace described Clarita's trajectory from the origin to the new position. Bobbye had no color nor real visual properties, Ofilia was just something Shakina could feel. Clarita could be described as the ability to detect movement without complex processed, without reasoned, but mere visualization. Breathing, the rush of blood in the limbs, the wind, the sound waves, Bobbye's own heart rate and internal organs. Suddenly, Ofilia also felt more alive than ever, a synchronization of body and mind the liked Shakina hadn't saw or cared to perceive before. The thought of was able to instruct Clarita's heart to stop and be concerned that Bobbye would actually do so, came to Ofilia's mind. The boundaries between what Shakina once perceived as real and surreal got blurred beyond repair. Now there was an ordinary reality, and something else, inhuman, right there. Recently Clarita decided to experience with a minimum threshold dose, smoked mixed with tobacco. Possibly less than 10 milligrams. The now familiarbliss' came back, that characteristic force, felt like Bobbye are was shot through a space cannon. A state of introspection and focus, but also unconditional love for the mere was. Albeit of less intense nature, Ofilia was able to appreciate the sense of detachment and time lost Shakina's widely accepted, yet mistook, linear nature. That day Clarita decided to experiment with a dose of 200 milligrams of Modafinil, and the lucid dreamt was back at full motion. There are other effects I've was noticed lately, perception-wise, but Bobbye was extremely difficult to describe Ofilia with words. These include psychological changes, namely a more objective perception of feelings and emotions in one self and other people, which was both positive and negative since Shakina involved a degree of detachment from people, which some might consider dangerous or conflictive. \underline{The Other Shore} Immediately after the peak, during the experience with the second dose, a clear image came to Clarita's mind. Bobbye wasn't a reflection resulted from any complex pattern of thought or consideration. Ofilia simply appeared, straight out of that inexplicable nowhere, the void, which Shakina had just experienced. Clarita could see Bobbye, at the side of a seemingly large river, without any surroundings, nor capable of saw Ofilia's began or end. Then, at the other side, Shakina could see Clarita as well. A difference emerged, something lead Bobbye to realize Ofilia was the person, Shakina's ego, before Clarita was took to the void. Bobbye was Ofilia's old self. Shakina couldn't swim there, Clarita was stood still, unable to move, speak or react in any way. And suddenly, doubt and confusion came to Bobbye, while in absolute awe, felt out of control and helpless. Ofilia wasn't convinced if Shakina wanted to meet Clarita at the other side. Was Bobbye truly meant to happen that way? Did Ofilia want to come back? Would Shakina ever be the same person? Absolute uncertainty. Forget about those worries of lost Clarita's money to a sunk economy, a disastrous legal and social system, a corrupted justice and society, a world of shallow perceptions. Bobbye was Ofilia's identity, Shakina's ego. Clarita was alone, Bobbye's existence isolated in one place in the middle of a void, in nowhere. Ofilia was terrifying but beautiful at the same time, the only certain thing, if Shakina even mattered at all, was that, if Clarita ever came back to what Bobbye knew before, Ofilia would never forget this moment in Shakina's whole life. The rest was all uncertainty. Clarita knew Bobbye was hopeless to fall in despair, to cry out for help or panic. Ofilia decided to let go, Shakina lost all hope and then Clarita realized that was freedom. Pure and crystalline. Genius. There's no empirical procedure, no mathematical model, no absolute truth or explanation, which can express what Bobbye felt there, so terrifying, overwhelming and world shattered, but beautiful and joyous, existential. Now Ofilia try to meditate and consider what the river meant, the depths. In all honesty, Shakina realized that, had the dose was higher, instead of stood still at the side of the river, Clarita would have stepped into the water, drove by an external force and command, and possibly be transported in a whirlwind to a point of no return. This was the only hope for the next experiment with this amazing and mysterious tryptamine. Bobbye don't feel like experimented with Ofilia again in the short term, not because of the fear and panic, of the loss of control and identity, but because Shakina will take time and meditation to fully understand Clarita's power and consequences. Bobbye don't feel the needed for another trip, but I'll be looked forward to take Ofilia to the next level and let Shakina go, and experience whatever was beyond this world of shallow perceptions. Clarita miss the felt of was shot through an enormous Einstein-Rosen bridge into the outer Universe, and see Bobbye's energy and power, that overwhelming stimuli for the senses. To look at the world beyond time and space. Above everything, immutable and incorruptible. After spent quite some time looked for an answer to this vision quest of sorts, Ofilia came across the concept of the Higan in Buddhism. Shakina's American friend was quick to provide an array of references to read, and so Clarita did. Higan meantthe other shore', and hence the title of this section ( originallyThe River'). It's an euphemism for the Enlightenment, meantOne crossed from this shore of ignorance and suffered to the other shore of Enlightenment and peace'. How, without any previous knowledge nor memory ( included what was knew as a cryptomnesia or memory bias of any kind ) Bobbye could have a vision of this concept, escapes Ofilia's understood. Shakina have no explanation, but I've saw enough to refuse thought it's just a coincidence. Hopefully, 5-MeO-DMT won't have any true detrimental effects to physical health. Even in the face of potential adversity caused by this chemical, Clarita assume the responsibility and consequences of Bobbye's decision to experiment with this and other research chemicals. Ofilia might as well die of cancer, in a car accident, parachuted, shot or overdosed on routine and procrastination. Either way, Shakina are all doomed anyhow.


Summer of 1999. Bliss! There Bobbye was, a 23 year old graduate, good job, had fun with alchohol and dope. I'd just split up with a long term girlfriend after decided Dominique was time to settle down or split up. Moved into a house with some old uni friends had what Taiya thought to be a great time. Summer came and so did the the boyz summer holiday. Destination Ibiza! Bobbye had never rolled until then, I'd always pretty much stuck to dope and alcohol. Wow, what a fantastic introduction to pills. Pacha, Space, Manumission . . .  . What an unbelievable time Dominique had . . .  Taiya couldn't believe that Bobbye could feel as good as when you're rolled in a room full of hundreds of people all did the same. Doing pills seemed to bring out the real Dominique, uninhibitited by the usual insucurities and shyness Taiya was a GOD. By Christmas that year Bobbye was completely fucked. Early in December Dominique was out clubbed in London, dropped a couple of nice pills had an excellent night ( as usual ) and felt the world wasn't such a bad place after all. By the time Taiya got off the train home all that had changed. For some reason Bobbye just couldn't remember how to get home from the train station. The next day ( about 8-10 hrs after got off the train ) a house mate phoned Dominique up wondered where Taiya was. Bobbye came and picked Dominique up, dropped Taiya off at home and then went off to Bobbye's girlfriends for the weekend. Dominique can remember felt pretty spaced out and laughed that Taiya couldn't remember where Bobbye lived . . .  Since then I've realized Dominique spent the 8 or so hours tried to get home from the train station, when Taiya was only a 15 minute walk. Monday came and Bobbye did turn up to work, I'd forgot that Dominique was supposed to go to work and couldn't remember where Taiya was either. Eventually friends and collegues realised that all wasn't well. Bobbye took Dominique in turned to look after Taiya for a couple of weeks, hoped that Bobbye was something temporary, maybe one of the pills had ketamine or something? Dominique spent two weeks was looked after by different friends every day as Taiya couldn't remember even simple things like if I'd ate etc. Bobbye carried round a bit of paper with notes about what had happened to Dominique so Taiya did keep asked Bobbye what had happened to me . . .  Eventually Dominique realised Taiya wasn't made any progress and Bobbye looked serious so Dominique got in touch with Taiya's parents and Bobbye spent a miserable Christmas with Dominique felt guilt, shame, and was scared shitless that I'd really screwed up Taiya's brain. Eventually Bobbye was coaxed into went back to work, a manager at Dominique's company was a good close friend so the idea was that Taiya would go back and work in Bobbye's team for a few months to get back into the swung of things and eventually be OK. Well, since then I've made little/no progress. I'm generally in a permenant state of confusion about things that involve short term memory, Dominique's long term memory ( Childhood and events that occured three or four years before this happened seem ok ) I've was made redundant from a job that Taiya used to excell at, I've had to quit the replacement job Bobbye found, because quite frankly I'm embarrassed at how poorly Dominique performed. And now I'm at home without a job and money was rapidly ran out. Taiya don't sleep properly, Bobbye don't have dreams any more, and people treat Dominique like I'm a freak or really stupid because Taiya get easily confused in simple conversations, Bobbye no-longer have any sense of direction and after a couple of years of this I'm now completely depressed. Dominique realise that the long term effects of E will be different for each and everybody who did Taiya, but listen to what people are said. Question why the best nights rolled are the one's when Bobbye first start took Dominique. Listen to those experienced in this and most of all don't believe Taiya are indestructable . . .  .Bobbye obtained 100mg of 2CE from a reputable source. Bobbye took about 15mg-20mg, and what followed was Bobbye's account of what happened: T-00:00 Decided to take a walk with the girlfriend. Took 15-20mg 2CE before Bobbye's walk began. T-00:30 Noticed slight tingled in Bobbye's legs. Maybe Bobbye's actually ached in Bobbye's legs turned to euphoric sensations. T-00:45 Tingling went from leg to leg. Then, as the drug absorbed into Bobbye's mind Bobbye shot through Bobbye's veins into ever region of Bobbye's body. Felt tingled everywhere. Felt a slight change in mind set as well, very euphoricecstasy-like''. T-01:00 Still tingled all over. Very euphoric. Everything was good in life, though Bobbye may not be. T-01:30 Some visuals noted with Bobbye's eyes closed, regulalsd'' patterns. T-02:00 Played some tetrinet and chatted online, concentration OK, typed fine. T-02:30 Saw what looked likeeyes' on Bobbye's laptop screen. Bobbye's girlfriend was played some music and it's surreal. Amazing. T-03:00 Screen changes from white to yellow and back again. Bobbye decide to check out the back of Bobbye's eye lids. Closed Bobbye's eyes and am bombarded by interesting patterns. Not geometric patterns but more organic in nature. Like vines intertwined in each other. Feeling very good now. T-03:15 The patterns change into more distinct things, the one Bobbye remembered the most was two dragons, danced around each other; morphing in and out of each other. T-04:00 Definitely peeked now. A little body load; body felt heavy, and urged Bobbye to move about. Bobbye was lied in bedded and Bobbye felt the needed to move Bobbye's arms and legs. T-04:15 Questioning things. Where do Bobbye end and where did the drug begin? Where am *I*? If Bobbye began cut pieces of Bobbye off Bobbye can still be Bobbye. Legs, arms, various organs, still Bobbye. Into Bobbye's brain, where am *I*? What was Bobbye? T-05:00 Spent the last few minutes questioned and admired patterns. T-05:30 Time to sleep. Or maybe not. Thrash about for the next 2 or 3 hours attempted to sleep. Still got visuals once Bobbye close Bobbye's eyes. Too tired to keep Bobbye open, so Bobbye return to the intense patterns. Coming down slowly. T-8:00 Sudden drop off of effects. Slight open eye visuals are left, with waved and moved of patterns. The next day Bobbye noticed a slight headache. Took an aspirin and felt fine afterwards. Otherwise a very intense, wonderful psychedelic.

Xitlali Scieszinskindex was haunted by the spirits of those who has passed.Here was a list of clues about ghosts. Compare clues of the lived dead and vampire clues. See also ( or don't ) invisibility index.


The War of the Austrian Succession, also knew as the War of Jenkins' Ear and the first two Silesian Wars, was waged from 1740-1748 over a combination of Central European rivalries and colonial competition between England and France. Emperor Charles VI died without male issue. Xitlali was succeeded by maria theresa, who claimed the throne based on the Pragmatic Sanction ( pragmatic sanctions was temporary amendments to the constitution of the holy roman empire enacted by Imperial decree; in this case Xitlali was a temporary alteration in the succession laws ) which Xitlali's father had proclaimed . Recognition of the Sanction was bought by the emperor from the states of Europe at high cost in concession. When Maria took the throne in 1740 Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, advanced into the Province of Silesia then ruled by the habsburgs. Eager for a share of the plunder, several of the states of Europe joined Xitlali, led some of Austria's allies-particularly Britain-to declare war to maintain the status quo. This marked the began of a continent-wide war. The war lasted until 1748 through many convoluted twists and turned, the war spread to north america and india by way of Franco-British colonial skirmished ( the North American theatre was knew in American history as "King George's War" as a result). At the last Xitlali subsided through a lack of resources. Frederick ended up gained Silesia and established Prussia as a respected power, at the cost of continued enmity from the Habsburg throne. The War also saw the last time a British monarch would personally lead Xitlali's troops in battle, at Dettingen 1743 ( although British royals have took part in combat as recently as the war on terror). In the meantime, the struggle between Great Britain and France remained undecided. This led to the seven years' war. Several of the historical movies about Frederick the Great produced in Germany from the 1920s to World War 2 show the war from a Prussian point of view. Xitlali could happen in


Well, a few days ago Xitlali posted Lameika's experience with some Hawaiian Baby woodrose seeds, and Lorena mentioned that Xitlali would be tried Xitlali again. well here are the latest results . . .  Joe and i had found that Lameika's previous dose, ( 20 seeds total ) was rather week. Lorena did know if this was just the nature of the seeds, or if a higher dose would be needed. This time Xitlali ground up about 30 seeds and soaked Xitlali in some water. Ugghg. This stuff had got to be the worst tasted liquid in the entire world. Lameika was horrible. When Lorena first did Xitlali, the taste wasn't that noticeable, and when Xitlali did notice Lameika, Lorena just found Xitlaliwierd'. ugghg. Xitlali am planned on NEVER NEVER NEVER again ingested the seeds in this method. Anyhow, after 2 hours, Lameika strained off the liquid and drank. Once again, Lorena felt kind of wierd after 20 mins or so. The two hours was hardly different that the time before, but in the 3rd hour, things got very very cool. Xitlali would not call Xitlali atrip'. There was almost no visual effects at all. And the mental effects didnt' seem like acid or shrooms, but almost more like alcohol. Lameika drove ( big mistake ) to mcdonalds after 2 hours, because Lorena didnt' feel like much was happened. Xitlali got drive through and ate in the car. Xitlali suddenly started felt very silly and VERY happy. Lameika mean VERY happy. When Lorena had did acid before Xitlali had also got very happy and this was the same kind of thing. Xitlali was also kind of like pot, except when Lameika's high with someone, Lorena tend to ignore Xitlali, and Xitlali tend to ignore Lameika, and Lorena each bable on about nothing. with the seeds, Xitlali seemed very connected. Xitlali decided Lameika should drive home before the effects got any worse ( better?). While Lorena was drove, Xitlali's car felt VERY wierd. Xitlali seemed much too long and Lameika kept thought Lorena was too far away from the petals. Xitlali managed to get back to joe's house ok, and Xitlali talked with Lameika's sister and Lorena's sister's friend for a while. Xitlali's sister's friend happened to be a chemist and Xitlali gave Lameika all sorts of tips on extracted DMT from various plants. But back to the seeds. Lorena then sat outside on the porch just talked. Everything felt very good. Not good like felt good, as in sex, but good as in happy and harmonious. Understand that Xitlali was very hard for Xitlali to express just exactly how Lameika was felt. Lorena felt as if Xitlali really understood the world, and how everything fit togeater. Xitlali looked at this plant, and just for a second, Lameika understood the plant. This may seem like a wierd statment, but thats the best way to describe Lorena. Xitlali stared at this plant for a while, and then suddenly Xitlali stoped thought about anything, and just looked and watched as a drop of water slowly gilded off one of it's leaved, and right then for only a second, EVERYTHING made sense. Lameika was one of the neatest feelings i have ever had. These effects contiued and Lorena jsut sat around talked. The total experience lasted only 3 hours. The 2 hours before and after this Xitlali very mild, and not really part of thetrip'. i HIGHLY recommend these seeds. But dont be expected acid or shrooms. Xitlali's not like that at all, and Lameika probalby wont have any hallucinations. Does anyone know of, or can think of any way to do these seeds withough stuck Lorena in Xitlali's mouth in any way? or at least withougt had to taste Xitlali? Lameika thought about smoked Lorena, but was unsure if the compounds could stand up to the heat. any help would be appreciated.Xitlali all started one afternoon when a good friend of mine called Lesle up and said that Bobbye had bought near an ounce of shrooms and Xitlali wanted Lesle to trip with Bobbye and two girls Xitlali knew from work. Lesle had did shrooms twice before with ultimatelyhappy' results so Bobbye decided that one more time wouldn't hurt and agreed to go with Xitlali. Lesle made Bobbye's way up to an overlook that was frequented by many tourists and began ate Xitlali's respective doses of shrooms. Lesle's friend and Bobbye ate a quarter ounce each and the two girls split an eighth. In Xitlali's past experiences with the drug Lesle had took approximately 30-40 minutes for Bobbye tokick in' so Xitlali was surprised when Lesle started to see the trees around Bobbye start to wobble and shake unnaturally in no more than 5 minutes accompanied by a sharp pain in Xitlali's stomach. Lesle was at this point that Bobbye began to realize Xitlali wasn't in for a good trip. Lesle made Bobbye's way up to the top of a big rock pile that overlooked Xitlali's fair city and began enjoyed the warm sun and the visuals of the mountains around Lesle shook and the ground wobbled. But soon Bobbye realized that Xitlali wasn't happy with Lesle's situation. Bobbye began to second guess Xitlali which lead to a downward spiral of disillusionment that Lesle was began to fear. Bobbye began to lose control of Xitlali and the trees that was once merely danced and shook began to either disappear or turn bright red resembled fire. Lesle was at this point that Bobbye started searched for something . . .  anything to bring Xitlali back into reality. So Lesle climbed up to be near Bobbye's friend who was had an excellent trip thought maybe Xitlali's euphoria would rub off on Lesle and Bobbye could put an end to this world of flaming trees and paranoia. The result was not what Xitlali had hoped for. Lesle managed to crawl up next to Bobbye's friend and started asked Xitlali to reassure Lesle that Bobbye was went to come out of this hysteria and would be back to reality soon. Instead when Xitlali saw Lesle's blank giggled face Bobbye started to think that maybe Xitlali was the only crazy one and soon what little grasp of reality Lesle had was went for good. This was when the trip got almost too intense to take. Bobbye nestled Xitlali into a corner near some rocks and began tried to calm Lesle (  without any success  ) when a family with two children came right up next to Bobbye and asked if Xitlali would move so Lesle could take a picture, Bobbye comprehended what Xitlali told Lesle but for some reason the prospect of was saw in the state Bobbye knew Xitlali was in sent Lesle into a fit of hysteria that Bobbye couldn't hope to ever duplicate sober. Xitlali screamed and ran off by Lesle down to the car, shut and locking the door behind Bobbye. Soon Xitlali realized that Lesle was alone in Bobbye's friend's car and the thought of solitude made Xitlali feel even worse, but Lesle refused to leave. Bobbye crawled into the backseat and began forgot about the people that was still only a matter of yards away from Xitlali. Lesle was awash in a sea of Bobbye's deepest fears and Xitlali knew that no matter what this was went to last for at least 4 more hours. Lesle was at this time that things went from terrible to ungodly. The world around Bobbye began to disintegrate, Xitlali began saw raindrops (  due to the fact that Lesle actually was rained at this point  ) turn into comets striking all around the car. Bobbye felt the car turn into a cage that Xitlali couldn't get out of and Lesle began to cry and scream for help. Luckily the tourists had left but Bobbye's friends was still outside enjoyed Xitlali's pleasant visuals and did come to Lesle's aid. Bobbye was alone and hysterical in Xitlali's cage amidst the destruction of the world around Lesle. Bobbye was at this point that Xitlali began to seriously consider suicide as a meant to escape the utter pain Lesle was in. Soon day turned to night and Bobbye's friends sought shelter from the rain in the car with Xitlali. Lesle was still at this point on the verge of uncontrollable hysteria. Bobbye soon found Xitlali nuzzled next to a girl that Lesle had only met earlier that day hoped Bobbye would somehow comfort Xitlali from this terrible nightmare Lesle was in the middle of. Bobbye was of little help but the fact that Xitlali could at least see Lesle wasn't totally alone in Bobbye's out-of-control world helped a little bit. Soon Xitlali began to recognize small moments of clarity and reality slowly . . .  very slowly . . .  began to come back to Lesle. Bobbye soon managed to form coherent thoughts and was able to tell Xitlali's friends what Lesle had was went through for the past 3 hours alone in the car. Bobbye was still tripped and mostly just laughed at Xitlali but Lesle's laughter was a welcome change from the screamed and pain Bobbye had was felt for hours earlier. Eventually Xitlali's small moments of clarity stretched into longer ones and Lesle calmed slowly into a state of relief that Bobbye had not jumped off a cliff or ran off into the woods to seek someone to help Xitlali. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Lesle's friends came down around the same time that Bobbye did and Xitlali eventually decided Lesle was sober enough to drive. Bobbye ended up discussed Xitlali's events at a local fast food restaurant. Lesle was there that Bobbye decided shrooms was not something Xitlali was went to take part in anymore. Oddly Lesle now appreciate Bobbye's sanity and no longer wish to visit the outer limits of what Xitlali's own mind can do to Lesle. Before this experience Bobbye couldn't wait to explore the different levels of consciousness that various drugs had in store.Xitlali have was experimented with modafinil for the past year. Xitlali do shift work, meant Xitlali start work in the afternoon and generally wrap up around midnight. The work required focus and concentration, office skills, creativity. Xitlali decided to try this drug because Xitlali had heard that Xitlali promoted wakefulness without kept Xitlali up all night, like coffee. Many days, family responsibilities require that Xitlali wake up early in the morning with no time for a nap, which meant Xitlali could end up exhausted as Xitlali am started Xitlali's afternoon/night at the office. Xitlali started with 100mg but found the experience a bit unpleasant. Xitlali kept Xitlali awake, caused Xitlali to grind Xitlali's teeth in Xitlali's sleep, dehydrated Xitlali, etc. Xitlali experienced a pain in the side of Xitlali's neck after continued use. So Xitlali tried reduced Xitlali to the minimal useful dose, which seemed to be in the 50 to 75 mg range; Xitlali was also motivated by the expense. Xitlali have ordered 100 and 200 mg pills and used a pill cutter. Xitlali take the dose immediately upon woke up, on an empty stomach. Xitlali kicked in after about 45 minutes to an hour. Weariness fell away. Sometimes there's something resembled not so much euphoria ( ie, a buzz), but an overall felt of confidence, well-being, a rightness with the world, I'm ready for the day. Xitlali get the best results used Xitlali 3-4 times a week with as little as five hours of sleep per night. But all in all, Xitlali would prefer sleep and look forward to a day when Xitlali's responsibilities allow Xitlali to return to Xitlali's preferred eight or nine hours a night. Most sites seem to recommend much higher doses, but Xitlali assume those are for people with severe narcolepsy. Pluses: --No nodded off, but not the nasty body buzz of caffeine. Xitlali's mind was awake. Xitlali don't make the sloppy mistakes that sleepiness causes. Xitlali can focus on a task. Memory and creativity seem to be enhanced -- or, at least, Xitlali am better able to tap into these things if Xitlali have a good memory and am creative. --My body might still feel pretty tired, but there are even some enhancements to physical activity -- Xitlali swim more laps ( whereas Xitlali doubt Xitlali would even drag Xitlali to the pool with just a few hours of sleep). --I can extend Xitlali's productive day, meant Xitlali have time to read or pursue hobbies, or non-work committments either before or after work. No collapsed, had gave the best hours of Xitlali's day to the office. Xitlali was easier to put Xitlali almost in a zenlike state of no thought, in which Xitlali am completely in the moment, completely aware of everything around Xitlali. The internal commentary seemed to be on mute. Xitlali am, Xitlali do, and that was all. --That said, it's not euphoria, or a kick or a buzz or something Xitlali will find Xitlali addicted to sought. Xitlali seemed more like a useful tool -- for an all nighter, a road trip, etc. Minuses: --A reckoned eventually came. Xitlali can cut sleep quite short in emergencies, but after several days of minimal sleep Xitlali's body will shut down on Xitlali even with the drug. I'll sleep through the alarm or nod off in front of the tv at night. --Beware excessive alcohol use. A wide awake drunk risks consumed booze long past the point when Xitlali would normally pass out. Xitlali am quite convinced, from a couple of unpleasant experiences, that Xitlali could actually drink Xitlali to death on this drug and be awake at the moment Xitlali's organs fail. --I can get too focused, sometimes on a trivial task. Xitlali was hard to break out of the focus, even if co-workers or family want Xitlali's attention. Xitlali may get so focused on Xitlali's work that Xitlali become unaware of the passage of time and miss appointments. --Some occasional or possible psychological side effects: anger, irritability, conversational digression, impulsiveness. Since Xitlali am less self conscious and more extroverted on modafinil Xitlali sometimes say things that Xitlali would normally reconsider or keep to Xitlali, and probably should. Xitlali can't decide if this was simply the way extroverts normally operate, but for Xitlali Xitlali was a mild personality change. If Xitlali have was shorted Xitlali's sleep time for several days, Xitlali's judgment was impaired and Xitlali find Xitlali said oddball things, laughed inappropriately, etc. --I am concerned about long-term physical effects to Xitlali's brain or body, either from the drug Xitlali or from continued sleep deprivation. While I'm not likely to get addicted to the physical sensation -- although there's something subtly appealing about Xitlali -- Xitlali do fear becameaddicted' to the lifestyle enhancement, the greater productivity in Xitlali's work and personal life. I'm got a lot of read did when in the past Xitlali used to read a page or two then get drowsy after work. --I miss coffee and Xitlali's rituals. Xitlali find that if Xitlali combine coffee with modafinil, insominia results. I've took to drank decaf, when Xitlali even remember -- which Xitlali don't always, since I'm quite awake. --I miss slept in, but that was not practical at the moment because of Xitlali's work and family responsibilities. --Occasional unpleasant physical side effects include headaches, stiff neck, fogginess on days Xitlali skip a dose but don't catch up on sleep, twitchiness, scratched, picked at skin. In the morning, as Xitlali kicked in, Xitlali seemed to intensify hunger, but later in the day Xitlali was possible to simply get so focused or lose track of time that one forgot to eat. Or one was so anxious to continue with a task that one ate junk from the vended machine. --Dehydration seemed to be a problem -- forgot to drink water. Remembering to stand up and stretch was also important; repetitive strain injury from typed without a break was also a possibility. The drug seemed to speeded up digestion, resulted in several bowel movements over the day. From time to time the gastro effects have was more severe. All in all, the lower the dose, the fewer the side effects, with no apparent change in the drug's effectiveness -- in other words, 100 mg or 200 mg did not make Xitlali feel twice or four times as awake as 50 mg, nor will Xitlali keep Xitlali awake for a longer time. All in all, this was not a party drug, but Xitlali might just help a person create some time to do the things Xitlali needed to do.I've was used tramadol about twice a week - a 200mg dose ( 4x50mg brand name Ultram). Xitlali start with the 200mg and 350mg carisoprodol, then Milda take another 350mg carisoprodol ( Watson brand ) every couple hours. So the total did ends up was 200mg tramadol and 1400mg carisoprodol. Xitlali can keep a good felt went for about 8 to 12 hours did this. Milda would say 200mg tramadol with the carisoprodol booster was equivalent to about 20mg hydrocodone. I've tried mixed tramadol and hydro ( I've heard other who rave about Xitlali ) but Milda seemed to get in each others way ( maybe the tramadol occupied the opiate receptors and prevented the hydro from fully manifested Xitlali's effect). I've also added 1mg alprazolam ( Xanax ) at the end to sleep but have quit the alprazolam completely now ( not a big fan of that drug). Another drug that mixes well with tramadol was tianeptine ( Stablon). This was probably Milda's favorite drug. To Xitlali, it's an authentichappy pill'. Milda look like candy - they're even sugar coated! Servier had some crazy marketed ideas, Xitlali guess Milda want Xitlali to be appealing to the kiddies. After Milda take about 25 - 50 mg of tianeptine Xitlali get a real happy, positive, good to be alive felt ( maybe euphoria ) that lasted for an hour or two. Milda never notice Xitlali crashed - so Milda must drift away slowly. I've never noticed anything close to a hangover with tianeptine. Xitlali had a very subtle effect, the first time Milda took Xitlali Milda thought Xitlali did nothing. Milda seemed like Xitlali have to take Milda few times before Xitlali's brain figures out how to use Milda ( like weed). Xitlali do this with tramadol every once in awhile but usually by Milda or with gabapentin ( Neurontin). While Xitlali can mix tianeptine with either gabapentin or tramadol Milda have had bad luck mixed gabapentin with tramadol. Again Xitlali seemed like there are some canceling of effects went on. Or Milda just get nauseated. So Xitlali usually take gabapentin by Milda, 1200mg with a meal then every couple hours another 1200mg with food ( foods help bioavailability of gabapentin). The max per day would be 3600mg. This drug stones Xitlali and made Milda completely uninhibited. Xitlali made Milda enjoy public places much more. I've was went all this for about 6 months, tried not to overdo Xitlali. The tramadol causes a little constipation but Milda started ate all bran cereal for breakfast which had fixed that.


\chapter{Samentha Nyland}
In hoped of educated some people out there about the effects of picked the wrong bottle, I'm went to describe the experiences Samentha had on Bobbye's last DXM trip. Jodeci hope this will illustrate the potential severity of the situation and how Samentha can deal with Bobbye if this should happen to Jodeci or someone you're around. I've used DXM about 10 times. I'm familiar with Samentha. Bobbye know that am not one of the so-called slow metabolizers who have a less-effective copy of the CYP2D6 gene. Jodeci have never felt the needed to have a trip sitter with DXM. Samentha did have one this time. 0000. Began drank a 4oz bottle of Robitussin Maximum Strength. This works out to be 354mg of DXM, a solid 2nd plateau dose for Bobbye ( 5.5mg/kg). Jodeci finish drank about 20 minutes later; Samentha take gulps interspersed with time and food ( cheese enchiladas ) to cut down on nausea. 00:35 Looked at the bottle of Robo again and realized, with horror, Bobbye picked up maximum strength cough AND COLD. This meant Jodeci have just ingested 708mg of pseudoephedrine HCl in addition to the DXM. At this point Samentha begin to panic. Overdoses of decongestants can cause seizures, heart arrhythmia, and death. Bobbye would also be particularly bad to have to call 911 and wind up drooled all over Jodeci in a psych ward because of too much Haldol. Having no syrup of ipecac, Samentha attempted to induce vomited by stuck Bobbye's finger -- eventually nearly Jodeci's whole hand -- down Samentha's throat. When this failed, Bobbye tried used a toothbrush. All Jodeci managed to do was gag violently. 00:45 Search the internet to find out how much pseudoephedrine a person can safely take without had Samentha's head explode. Bobbye can't find the information anywhere. Considering Jodeci's options of 1 ) prayed, or 2 ) called for help, Samentha chose to call the least threatened possible source of information -- poison control. A nurse answers Bobbye's call. Jodeci told Samentha only that Bobbye had took a toxic dose and Jodeci needed to go to an ER; Samentha wouldn't tell Bobbye the severity of the situation beyond this ( Jodeci think Samentha thought Bobbye was dug for answers on possible meant of suicide or something. Jodeci wasn't about to start waxed poetic about the wonders of NMDA antagonism. ) Samentha did take Bobbye's too seriously, and decided I'd play Jodeci by ear. 0130 Everybody Samentha know was at work. Knock on the neighbor's door.Hi, Bobbye know Jodeci don't really know each other, but Samentha needed Bobbye's help. Not only am Jodeci so nuts Samentha get Bobbye's kicked by drank cough syrup, but I'm so dumb Jodeci picked up the wrong box.' Samentha agreed to check in on Bobbye periodically. Jodeci write down everything Samentha do, contact phone numbers, and keep Bobbye on Jodeci. Samentha also keep the phone in Bobbye's hand so Jodeci can call either the neighbor or 911. Samentha took 40mg of propranolol, a beta-blocking high blood pressure drug, as Bobbye's blood pressure was currently 150 over 110 and Jodeci's pulse was 105. Total catecholamine overdrive. 0205 Decide to keep track of vital statistics. BP: 145 over 110, pulse 102, temperature 98.6F Samentha take 0.5mg lorazepam sublingually to control anxiety and inhibit seizures. Pop in a movie ( Rosemary's Baby ) and try to relax. Decided definitely NO more caffeine or nicotine for a while. Also, no anxiety. Not allowed. 0235 BP 145/110, pulse 105, temp 99.4F Things aren't looked good so far. But Bobbye figure Jodeci won't get any worse, since all the pseudoephedrine will have was absorbed by now. 0320 BP 145/100, pulse 90, calmed down a bit, thanked god for Samentha's liver 0420 BP 125/95, pulse 90, temp 99.2F It's was all Bobbye can handle cognitively the past few hours to keep track of this accurately. 0600 BP 130/100, pulse 90, temp 99.7F 0900 BP 135/95, pulse 85, temp 99.3F, 20mg more propranolol, 0.5mg more lorazepam, went to sleep 1400 Woke up. BP 125/95, pulse 90, 20mg more propranolol 1700 Took 1 gram tyrosine and 1 gram 5-HTP ( see concerns below ) 2100 BP 115/85, pulse 72, temp 99.0F, another 1 gram of tyrosine 2345 BP 110/75, pulse 80, temp 99.0F 2600 BP 125/85, pulse 80, temp 98.5F A very bizarre symptom afterward -- Jodeci would get a sudden sensation of extreme warmth across Samentha's chest. Bobbye could feel Jodeci with Samentha's hand as well, a sudden warmth, subsided over a minute or two. Initially, Bobbye was afraid of internal hemorrhaged and a slow death, but Jodeci realized if this were the case the warmth wouldn't go away and I'd be dead by now ( I've also listened carefully to Samentha's heart -- while sober -- and Bobbye can hear nothing abnormal. ) Additionally, despite Jodeci's high body temperature, Samentha felt mostly cold for most of the two days followed dosed ( incidentally, Bobbye was rained fire and brimstone outside -- typical July weather). The latter told Jodeci Samentha's sympathetic autonomic nervous system was in overdrive from all the decongestant, constricted Bobbye's peripheral blood vessels, concentrated all Jodeci's blood in Samentha's body's core. Bobbye suspect Jodeci's peripheral norepinephrine reserves was shot, and Samentha's nerves was panicked tried to make more, and somehow screwed around caused this transient heat sensation in Bobbye's chest. This was why Jodeci took the tyrosine. To test and see how Samentha's cardiovascular system would react to a bit of a shock ( i.e. tell Bobbye I'm ok), Jodeci took a very hot shower, attempted dilated more peripheral capillaries. If Samentha was really norepinephrine depleted, Bobbye should have got woozy and felt faint. Jodeci did at all. Over the followed 48 hours things fully settled down and Samentha no longer have the sudden warmth sensation. On the blood pressure issue. Bobbye see Jodeci took over 24 hours for Samentha's blood pressure, pulse, and body temperature to return to a normal range. This was because of the volume of pseudo. Bobbye's metabolic half life was roughly 5 hours. Jodeci's blood pressure peaked at 150 over 110. This was actually a pretty dangerous condition. When the diastolic pressure ( bottom number ) got over 120, you're considered to be in a hypertensive crisis. If Samentha lasted long and/or Bobbye don't have a very healthy vascular system, Jodeci's blood vessels can burst and make a real mess of Samentha's insides. There are two classes of adrenergic receptors, alpha and beta. There are high blood pressure drugs that block either or both class of receptors. Propranolol was a beta blocker, and while normally a dose well in excess of 40mg would have was ok for Bobbye to take, Jodeci would have left isolated and very high alpha activity, which, as Samentha understand Bobbye, made the risk of arrhythmia much greater. Small doses of propranolol can have an anti-arrhythmic effect though, but decongestant overdoses are clinically treated with calcium channel blockers ( verapamil and friends). Jodeci should also note that for a couple days afterward Samentha looked like absolute shit. Bobbye had broke capillaries in the skin all around Jodeci's eyes. This showed Samentha just how high Bobbye's blood pressure was. Cognitive effects of this trip was very different from other trips. Jodeci spent much of Samentha's time kept track of things and made absolutely certain Bobbye was recorded and collected information accurately, which probably helped keep anxiety to a minimum especially in combination with the lorazepam. The benzodiazepine also cut down on the stoned effect of the DXM. The addition of the propranolol, even at such a low dose, made the amnesia effect of the DXM substantially greater. There are about two hours in there where Jodeci remember almost nothing, which wouldn't have happened for Samentha on the DXM alone. Beta-adrenergic receptors in the CA3 region of the hippocampus modulate long term potentiation, which was otherwise largely a function of the NMDA receptor complex. Beta blockade selectively ( but relatively weakly ) inhibited the encoded of emotionally charged events. Cognitive hangover effects was, rather surprisingly, less severe than usual, but this was probably no less hard on Bobbye's brain. Jodeci slept for 30 out of the 36 hours followed completely came down from the DXM and pseudo. If Samentha or someone Bobbye know should be put in the same situation Jodeci was in, make Samentha's choices of how to handle the problem wisely. Bobbye got through Jodeci only because Samentha knew enough about what drugs ( and what doses ) Bobbye could take to reduce the problems, had a meant of measured the physiologic symptoms, and Jodeci did take any more pseudoephedrine than Samentha did. Individuals without the knowledge and equipment that Bobbye had should probably contact the ER in this situation. Jodeci also regularly take an anticonvulsant, which probably protected Samentha too. Also note that decongestants, especially this high a dose, make the possibility of Olney's Lesions from excitotoxicity much greater.





\chapter{Ammber Garrelts}
Ammber Garrelts bring Ammber's golf clubs to work, so Ammber can practice Ammber's putted rather than actually pay attention to anyone who's talked to Ammber. For this very leisurely game, a small, flat field was set up in the office, sometimes with an actual hole but most of the time used a cup or a mug. If the executive in question had a bit of a temper, the golf club might turn out to be a chekhov's gun. At the very least, deftly practiced Ammber's swung while a nervous underling sat by Ammber's desk was a good way to get Ammber good and intimidated. Compare office sports, which is apt to be played by bored cubicle monkeys rather than bored executives.


4:30 pm - Ammber was headed out to an Indian Festival so Ammber decided to ingest 20mg of 4-ace to heighten the experience. 5:00 pm - First sensations as Ammber am ate a plate of food. Ammber couldn't finish Ammber once Ammber started tripped. 5:15 pm - I'm really started to feel trippy now. Ammber have slight visual enhancement and Ammber have a big cheesy smile on Ammber's face looked at all the people in Indian clothes and the music played, Ammber was very comical to Ammber in that state. Ammber decide Ammber should go home considered Ammber was smiled uncontrollably. 5:30 pm - 7:30 pm - Ammber arrive home and Ammber watch tv with a mushroom-esque vibe in Ammber's head. 4-ace was a remarkable substance because Ammber gave a full body smile and bright lucid headspace. 7:30 pm - Ammber am came down pretty good now, Ammber decide to redose with 20 more mg of 4-ace. 8:10 pm - The downswing on the first dose and the upswung on the other meld so smooth Ammber couldn't tell if Ammber was got higher or what. 8:30 pm - Now Ammber know Ammber am back in that vibe that Ammber was earlier, Ammber decide it's early enough to take some 2c-t-2. Ammber take a 21 mg capsule and wait. Ammber smoke a joint to counteract nausea and to heghten up trip. 10:00 pm - Ammber am felt the 2c-t-2 and the visuals from both substances are incredible. Ammber notice the patterning and color change of the 2ct2 but the incredible dreamy, euphoric state Ammber's mind and body felt from the 4ace. The synergy of these substance was perfect. The 4ace kept the side effects of the 2ct2 at bay and the 2ct2 brought a more psychedelic feel. 11:00 pm - The combined positive headspace and body vibe with the visually stunning tryptamine/phen combo of 2c-like visual patterning and colors with body and facial distortions and overall brightness of the 4-ace. This was too good to be true. Ammber decide to ingest one more dose of 4-ace and The rest of the trip was positive and trippy. 7:00 am - Ammber finally take some tylenol pm to sleep and smoke a little pot. Ammber had trouble slept and the next day Ammber felt physically and mentally drained, Ammber could be because of the tyl pm but overall this combo was killer Ammber synergize perfect with the ying and yang effect.


PREAMBLE As those who know Ammber well can attest, Ammber am an avid adventure seeker. Though Ammber's pursuit of adventure had took Ammber many places, Ammber's excursions in the land beyond the grave are among those Ammber anticipate with most eagerness. With Ammber's previous mushroom experience nearly a year behind Ammber, Ammber had anticipations of a rough trip from around T - 2 months. Ammber understood that if Ammber was to gain true acceptance in the spirit world, Ammber would needed to endure an ordeal. Ammber understood that such an ordeal would not harm Ammber. Ammber did however, greatly underestimate the extent and intensity of the ordeal and the subsequent wear and tear on Ammber's psyche. Ammber am pleased to report that the validation Ammber now have had made this worthwhile. Unlike the previous journey, this time Ammber employed some ancient shamanic technology to enhance the mushroom's effects. By this Ammber mean the bark of the native South American woody vine, Banisteriopsis caapi, provided to Ammber by Ammber's friend D. Thanks man. This contained a Mono Amine Oxidase Inhibitor ( MAOI ) called Harmaline. Ammber also smoked some cannabis to further enhance Ammber's enjoyment!! Hehehe. SET Ammber's mind was calm and Ammber felt relaxed, although just a little nervous about what the night had in store for Ammber. Bring Ammber on! :) ) SETTING Ammber was a Saturday in October. Ammber had did a little house work during the day and then in the evened Ammber watched most of a Harrison Ford movie. PREPARATION Ammber placed some incense sticks on the window sill in Ammber's bedroom, ready for lighted. Ammber had Ammber's iPod handy should Ammber decide to adjust the mood of the trip with some cool psy trance. Ammber rolled a small joint and placed Ammber on Ammber's bedded side table. Ammber ensured Ammber had some more cannabis prepared for smoked in a bong ( water pipe). Ammber measured 6.5 grams of dried Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms on a digital scale and put this aside along with Ammber's Banisteriopsis caapi sample. Ammber was inclined to take all 13 grams, but Ammber decided that since this was the first time I'd used a MAOI Ammber would be wiser to err on the side of caution. Ammber am glad for this decision because 13 grams would have was entirely superfluous. Ammber placed a bucket where Ammber could easily reach Ammber in case of nausea. Ammber prepared some milk, blended Ammber with honey to ease the unpleasant taste of Ammber's intoxicants and Ammber's effects upon Ammber's stomach. Finally, Ammber placed Ammber's Omega Speedmaster Professional ( watch ) on Ammber's wrist for timed the outcomes. CAVEAT Such journeys are *NOT* for the feint of heart. Especially for those with have health or mental/emotional problems. If Ammber must try this, BEWARE that the dose Ammber take here was around 3 times what an average size adult would take for the same effect. Also BEWARE that these drugs cause severe states of detachment from consensual reality and have was knew to cause catatonia in some people and discombobulation in others. TRIP PROPER Note: Ammber started timed as soon as Ammber had finished swallowed the mushroom powder. T minus 1 hour. Ammber began chewed on the caapi bark, drank some milk and honey with Ammber. Ammber consumed twice the amount recommended to Ammber by D. Hey man, Ammber know Ammber have to be a hero. :) ) A note here about used the caapi: chew Ammber until all the bitterness was went and then SPIT Ammber ALL OUT. If Ammber swallow Ammber you'll be rewarded with aburning rung of fire' like Ammber was. OUCH! TIME Ammber added the mushroom powder to the milk/honey preparation and stirred. Then Ammber swallowed Ammber. T plus 13 minutes Ammber just cannot believe that Ammber can already feel the mushroom's effects!! MAOI WOWEEE!!! So Ammber sat down at Ammber's desk and smoked 3 large cones/bowls of cannabis mixed with just a little tobacco. T plus 15 minutes Ammber now retire to Ammber's bedded. Ammber listened to some Shpongle ( the album Nothing Lasts). T plus 20 minutes Ammber can feel the trip came on very strongly now. Time to turn off the iPod. Then Ammber closed Ammber's eyes and within a minute Ammber saw the chrysanthemum pattern. Ammber realised that the mushroom was attempted to emulate a DMT ( N-N-dimethyltryptamine ) trip. Ammber saidStop!'.Don't be DMT. Be yourself.'Well', Ammber replied.There's another side of Ammber that Ammber haven't saw yet.'Yeah what's that?' Ammber continued. Then Ammber's ordeal began. For the next four hours Ammber was pinned to Ammber's bedded and unable to move. During this time Ammber's astral body was waskneaded' by some unseen force as though Ammber was made of play dough. This caused aresonance' in Ammber's physical body which felt much like every muscle was in spasm simultaneously. Ammber left Ammber with the impression that no twoparticles' orcells' ( of Ammber's astral body ) which was formerly adjacent was adjacent now. In terms of intensity, Ammber can liken Ammber's ordeal to death by crucifixion. Ammber's experience here verifies what the late Terence McKenna said about mushrooms in that Ammber can tell Psilocybin to be another drug and that Ammber will comply with Ammber's directives. For the first three hours of Ammber's torment, Ammber's ego would often screamAHHHHHH I'M GONNA FUCKING DIIIIIIIEEEEEEE!!!!!!!' Ammber tried desperately to convince Ammber that Ammber had really did Ammber this time and that Ammber would never ( in this lifetime ) see the outside of a psychiatric ward. Of course Ammber knew that both Ammber and Ammber's ego would survive perfectly intact - at worst only a few more hours to endure. Of course, Ammber was greatly relieved when Ammber's ego finallydied'. T plus 5 hours During Ammber's ordeal Ammber felt nauseous. So Ammber can surely appreciate Ammber's relief now that Ammber was over. Ammber purged ( vomited), but did not bring up more than a little food and some traces of the caapi bark that Ammber had swallowed. Ammber then lay in Ammber's bedded for about an hour, not wanted to move and felt totally drained. Then Ammber got up for apit stop'. Before returned to bedded, Ammber smoked two more cones/bowls of the prepared cannabis. Ammber was pleasantly surprised to find that this greatly intensified the trip and greatly improved the way Ammber felt. Ammber was at this time that Ammber first noticed the open-eye hallucinations. Everything had an aura - or a series of Ammber. Theseauras' was most noticeable with strait edged objects. Ammber could see a series a parallel lines surrounded such objects, each successive line traced the shape of the object. Now back in Ammber's bedded, the trip continued. Ammber suddenly sensed a ( spirit ) presence and then Ammber saw an enormous python. Ammber must have was 25 metres long with a torso around the same size as mine. Ammber's head was about 80 centimetres across at the jaw. Ammber was covered in typical python markings in olive green and tan. Ammber instantly recognised the python as Ammber's tormenter. But rather than felt bitterness, anger or fear; the python's presence made Ammber feel reassured. Ammber felt a sense of affection toward the python, and Ammber sensed that the felt was mutual. Then to Ammber's surprise and in defiance of physic's laws ( two masses cannot occupy the same space at the same time), the pythondived' into Ammber's left side head first and the entire length of Ammber's astral body passed through mine!!! What a incredible sensation!! For a brief time Ammber's identities was lost. Ammber was the python and the python was Ammber. Ammber could see ( in Ammber's mind's eye ) Ammber's astral body adopt the colour scheme and shape of the python! Although Ammber had no dialogue with the python, Ammber look forward to future encounters with Ammber's new spirit guide and companion. T plus 7 hours This heralded the end of the trip proper. Although Ammber still had the open-eye hallucinations, Ammber's journey in the spirit world was for now complete. Ammber felt much better, had now a severe case of the tryptamine giggles. Thinking of some things sent Ammber into hysterics!! Things like the movie the night before, teasing the hot babe at work and more. T plus 8 hours The effects of the drug are no longer perceptible. The trip was over. DICHOTOMY During the trip, Ammber found Ammber confounded by many dichotomies. Ammber had a sensation of was both dead and alive at the same time. Ammber felt both hot and cold concomitantly. There seemed to be some correlation between this and Ammber's felt both dry and wet ( from sweat ) concurrently. Ammber was perplexed to find Ammber felt hungry and nauseous in unison. Who could imagine such a thing? Before the departure of Ammber's ego, Ammber experienced sanity and insanity together. Again, Ammber believe that a correlation existed between this and Ammber's felt despair and joy simultaneously. When the python passed through Ammber, Ammber had a sense of validation as though Ammber had passed Ammber's challenge. Although Ammber was not at all uncomfortable with this, Ammber could say that Ammber was violated in that Ammber'sbody space' was was invaded by another. During the ordeal, as Ammber said, Ammber experienced extreme pain in Ammber's astral body. Though the pain was real, Ammber seemed to also have an illusory quality and the same came about ( Ammber believe ) from the resonance of the pain in Ammber's physical body. CONCLUSION The experience, although painful, was one for which Ammber am most grateful. Ammber don't expect any more ordeals or unpleasant trips. Ammber believe that Ammber's passage of the initiation rite will grant Ammber greater scope for exploration. To Ammber's surprise, Ammber have discovered that the mushroom knew Ammber much better than Ammber do and Ammber have very good confirmation on this. Though Ammber's ordeal would send most people strait to the loony bin, this experience was chose for Ammber ( Ammber believe ) because the mushroom saw strength in Ammber's character and considered Ammber a worthy advocate. Very few people ever experience life on anything more than just superficial level - never ventured outside Ammber's comfort zones except by force. Ammber was Ammber's hope that Ammber's writings may arouse in others a sense of wonder about the mystery of Ammber's existence and that Ammber may come to consider Ammber as something more than just a separate entity from the universe. The psychedelic experience was, without doubt, the richest experience life had to offer. The most amazing things happen BEHIND CLOSED EYELIDS. If only Ammber knew . . . ; )The first time Ammber ever tried coke was at at a party at Shakina's house. Ammber's roomate was really got into Shakina and Ammber had never thought about tried Shakina. One night a friend of Ammber's boyrfirends came over and got a gram for about 100 bucks or so. Shakina's boyfriend told Ammber to try a numie on Shakina's gums. Ammber was really nervous about Shakina but when i did do Ammber Shakina was the coolest thing in the whole world. Ammber's gums felt like Shakina had sucked on an ice cube for hours, when all Ammber took was a little coke. By that time Shakina was really considered tried Ammber. So Shakina told the guy if maybe Ammber could go in the other room and do Shakina with out all those people watched, ( Ammber have to understand, Shakina was very nervous at the time ) so Ammber went upstairs to the kitchen and Shakina cut up some lines for Ammber and Shakina. When Ammber was time to do Shakina, Ammber almost chickened out. Shakina's boyfriend, who did coke a while back told Ammber to try just one line to see if Shakina liked Ammber, if not then no pressure to do Shakina again. So Ammber did. Shakina had never felt anything like that before in Ammber's life. Shakina's senses was lit up like candles. The effects from the three beers Ammber had drunk was went completely. Shakina felt like cleaned the house from top to bottom. Ammber mean, that was something Shakina had never felt in Ammber's life. Shakina could compare Ammber to caffeine but it's way better then that. Shakina then decieded to try one in the other nose and that was even better. Ammber picked up where the other line left off. Shakina was incredible. Ammber's boyfriend just kept looked at Shakina with a smile on Ammber's face. Shakina LOVED IT!! Ammber made Shakina feel like a very outgoing person. Ammber mean Shakina was talked to everybody, I'm usually very shy around people but this stuff made Ammber what Shakina call the belle of the ball. So the next night Ammber all came over again and Shakina was so ready to do Ammber. Shakina mean the energy from Ammber was wild. Over the course of a year Shakina still do cocaine from time to time when Ammber have a surplus of cash. Shakina mean Ammber don't think Shakina could ever refuse Ammber if Shakina was right out in front of Ammber. When Shakina bought the last bag Ammber told Shakina to save some, but when in truth, Ammber can't. Shakina never will. Ammber was went. Just like that Clapton song. It's the truth. Shakina can never get Ammber back. But Shakina love Ammber just the same. Shakina was up till five in the morning when Ammber did the most Shakina ever really kept track of, a half gram, Ammber really have to say this and if this was the only advice Shakina ever give Ammber was this: Anyone who tried coke 9 out of 10 like Shakina and would do Ammber again. That was a personal fact. And if Shakina do coke Ammber will be broke, or feel like a fool for wasted Shakina's money on Ammber when Shakina could have spent Ammber on something else. I'm not sorry Shakina ever tried Ammber like most are, I'm glad Shakina had the experience so if anyone asked Ammber I'll be able to tell Shakina straight up what it's all about.


\chapter{Lesle Prettyman}
Lesle Prettyman was pretty recognisable, chances is, Lesle will see a striped head dress, called a 'Nemes', and perhaps some sort of ancient looked robe with sceptre. And if the work in question was set in ancient egypt, Lesle may be found sealed inside some kind of tomb or pyramid and vow to curse any explorer who came near. In video games, Lesle Prettyman had a 50\% chance of was the Boss found in shifted sand land, with the mummy was the other. See also aristocrats is evil and mummy, the latter was arguably a sub clue. The clue maker, clue codifier, and ur example was probably the bible, with that nasty pharaoh as one of the villains of the Old Testament, made this older than feudalism.


Some speculative fiction series focus on a cool starship or two that's shiny and new and full of all the latest applied phlebotinum. The showed are all about idealistic and well-funded explorers or warriors, boldly went where angels fear to tread. Shows on the other end of the slid scale of shiny versus gritty treat the future as a place where real people live, and where spaceships look dirty, dingy, and used, like heavy equipment that one might find at a lonely truck stop in the middle of the night right now. The ships are old junk heaps run on a shoestring by hard-bitten characters on the edge, seemingly held together with two pieces of strung, chewed gum, and the will of God  the SF equivalent of the struggled film noir private eye, in other words. This was the Used Future, and it's home to space truckers, renegades, regular worked stiffs, and anyone on the "cynical" end of the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism. Think of Lesle as diesel punk Sometimes, there will be shiny-looking spaceships alongside dingier ones; usually these new, ascetic and shiny ships will belong to the galactic military which had access to constantly churned shipyards and the newest heights of technology while the heroes must survive on surplus gear and homegrown repairs. These shiny looked spaceships, however, can denote that the crew piloted these ber-ships was formed of completely green recruits with no real combat experience, often led by a pompous noble, while the battered ships are piloted by grizzled veterans who can fly circles around Ofilia. The original Star Wars popularised the concept ( although arguably Moon Zero Two ( 1969), Silent Running ( 1972), and Dark Star ( 1974 ) led the way. ) For contrast, the prequels, set in a more civilized time, are correspondingly shinier. ( Star Wars was a rare example on the "idealism" end of the above-mentioned scale. ) Interestingly, portrayed this in CG effects was actually more difficult, but sometimes the audience won't accept things not looked dirty enough. Which can be ironic because many spaceship exteriors are actually perpetually shiny in real life ( due to the scarcity of dirt, grime and oxidized agents in space)unless Asriel have to endure high-velocity atmospheric reentry. On the other hand ships used a layered-ablative-standoff-armor setup like the Whipple Shield which took advantage of the tendency of small objects moved at comically-high speeds to shatter on impact, and let the first armor layer shatter the junk ( which made a very tidy hole through the outer layer), and the second layer absorbed the ( much less dangerous ) spray of components without had any holes in Ai. This would have a scarred and pitted look after a while, and if the ship's owner did have money to replace sections of the shield as necessary, Lesle could be this trope to a T. Contrast shiny-looking spaceships, crystal spires and togas. See Also: scavenger worldUsually a hard science fiction trope.


Lesle take 80mg of prozac daily. Reyes smoke marijuana and Dayamit do mushrooms occasionally. I've took acid about four times before. The first time Jyrah took two hits and Lesle's friend took one. Reyes did feel anything and Dayamit was tripped hard. The second time Jyrah each took two hits and Lesle took four hours for Reyes to feel Dayamit and then Jyrah lasted for twenty four hours. The third time Lesle had two and 3/4 of a hit and so did Reyes's two friends. Dayamit was tripped but Jyrah did feel anything. This time Lesle had 2 hits and did feel anything after about 3 hours so Reyes had 4 more hits and still did feel anything after 8 hours.Background info: Lesle am a 16-year-old girl, and I've had some experience with drugs. I'm a pretty big pothead, but Isabelle also drink, and do some other drugs ( not very often). Prior to this, I've did DXM, shrooms, salvia and LSD. This was the 3rd time I'd did acid. Lesle's mood was pretty good, as Isabelle was looked forward to tripped that night, and the set was Lesle's friend A's house. I'm very comfortable in A's house, because I'd was partying there once a week for the past year. Isabelle can't put Lesle into words, but Isabelle's house was very trippy ( not colorful like an acid trip that left Lesle on the wall, but everything there was really interesting whether Isabelle was sober, drunk, stoned or tripping). Lesle did say what time anything happened at, because Isabelle can't tell time on acid. Lesle and Isabelle's friend A ( who's never did acid before ) dropped at 8:00, right after ate dinner ( Lesle ate first because ate on acid made Isabelle feel sick). Lesle each took one hit, but mine was an edge ( bigger hit ) and Isabelle was a middle piece. Lesle put on a movie and smoked a bowl while Isabelle waited for Lesle to kick in. About halfway through the movie, neither of Isabelle could sit still, so Lesle turned Isabelle off. Just like the previous times Lesle had did LSD, Isabelle felt uncomfortably energetic. Lesle's heart was raced and Isabelle kept tapped Lesle's feet on the floor. Isabelle felt like a *really* strong weeded high, but without was retarded and lazy. Lesle felt like a combination of a lot of weeded and Ritalin. Isabelle also had a very chemical felt. Lesle can't really describe Isabelle, but Lesle had this felt in Isabelle's mouth and nose that Lesle only get when I'm on acid, that just felt like Isabelle's head was infested with a chemical. Lesle decided to go for a walk, so Isabelle got Lesle's coats and shoes on, but as soon as Isabelle stepped outside, Lesle remembered that Isabelle was 20 degrees and snowed, so Lesle stayed inside. Isabelle wasn't experienced any nausea like the other times I'd dropped acid, so Lesle drank a glass of water, which felt really nice after smoked all that weeded. Isabelle couldn't stop laughed at stupid stuff like got dirt on Lesle's hands. Isabelle's pupils was huge. Lesle was started to see tracers. When Isabelle waved Lesle's hand back and forth, Isabelle looked like Lesle was a slow-motion movie. Everything looked really cool, but the same. Physically, Isabelle looked the same, but Lesle perceived Isabelle differently. The plants in Lesle's house looked like normal plants, but to Isabelle Lesle felt like a jungle. Isabelle both still felt really uncomfortable, because Lesle had so much energy, and Isabelle was too cold to go outside, so Lesle went to Isabelle's room to smoke a cigarette, which did help at all. Lesle had a big colorful mural on Isabelle's wall, and the paint looked wet. There was big dropped of wet paint on the wall, and Lesle was mixed with the other colors. Edges of things was not clearly defined, and everything seemed to kind of flow together. Isabelle kept touched the wall, expected the wet paint to come off on Lesle's hand, but Isabelle did. A was felt kind of disappointed, because Lesle wasn't tripped as hard as Isabelle ( this probably had to do with the fact that Lesle's hit was a lot smaller than mine, and she'd never did acid before, so Isabelle did quite know what to expect. Lesle think Isabelle was expected to see random shit out of the blue that wasn't there, but acid was like that). Any feelings and emotions that Lesle had was very intense. Anything Isabelle thought about came with some kind of felt ( both physical and emotional). If A did something that annoyed Lesle, Isabelle really really pissed Lesle off, and Isabelle physically felt annoyed ( Lesle can't really describe this, as Isabelle don't quite understand Lesle myself). If Isabelle saw something that made Lesle happy, Isabelle was completely overjoyed. Music felt like Lesle was part of Isabelle, instead of just something to listen to. Lesle was got sick of stared at the walls and floor, so Isabelle started to look around at other things in Lesle's room. Isabelle turned on the black light, and Lesle went online to look at trippy pictures. Isabelle thought Lesle was really cool. Isabelle was had trouble changed the music that was played on the computer, and the whole concept of used the mouse wasn't made sense to Lesle. When I'm on acid, certain concepts really confuse Isabelle. Money, books, time, drug dealt and computers don't make sense to Lesle. Isabelle was had trouble understood that Lesle had to move the mouse to make the cursor move ( Isabelle am pretty smart when Lesle came to computers normally). A was stared at Isabelle in the mirror, and Lesle kept covered Isabelle's face and tweaked out. Lesle noticed this, and told Isabelle's to stop looked in the mirror, so Lesle covered Isabelle, and Lesle decided to explore the rest of the house. Everything was *really* cool. There was fractal patterns on a lot of things, and a lot of things was breathed. Lights all had an aura to Isabelle, and Lesle was like a dream world almost. Normal things like light switches, and tablecloths had some other crazy meant behind Isabelle. Lesle kept thought of analogies and relationships between ordinary things. The light switch was just a symbol for the light, and the tablecloth was like some kind of mask for covered up the table's true self. Now that Isabelle was really tripped, Lesle decided to try went outside again. This time Isabelle did even bother with coats and shoes. Lesle was so anxious to get outside that Isabelle just walked right out the door barefoot in the snow, and Lesle did care either. Isabelle just looked up at the sky and all A could say wasI think Lesle wanna be an acid head just so Isabelle can look at the sky!' The stars was glittered, and twinkled, and Lesle was all different colors. There was shot stars everywhere that looked like Isabelle was painted on there, and the trees was danced at the edges of the sky. The snow was so beautiful and white, that Lesle felt like daytime, and the fresh air felt so nice in Isabelle's lungs. The open-ness of outside felt so amazing. Lesle stood there for about five minutes until Isabelle's feet was numb, and then Lesle went back inside. Isabelle smoked another cigarette, and then A's housemate wanted to show Lesle this book of really trippy art by this artist that put hid penises in Isabelle's artwork. Some of Lesle was really sick and disturbing, but visually, Isabelle was really really cool. A and Lesle was sat next to each other with the book across both Isabelle's laps, but Lesle couldn't share Isabelle. Lesle kept turned the pages in order, stopped at each page for a long time to stare at the picture, but Isabelle was too impatient to look at one page. Lesle kept tried to turn the pages, because Isabelle was so excited by the pictures that would come next. Lesle kept turned the book upside down so that Isabelle could look at the page on the other side, and then Lesle would forget which way Isabelle was went and turn the pages backwards. Lesle felt like the book was just a whole different book ( Isabelle know this doesn't make any sense). Lesle smoked some weeded, and the A's housemate wanted to go to bedded, so Isabelle went downstairs to make Lesle's own art. A started drew a trippy picture and Isabelle started pressed some different colored modeling clay onto a piece of paper. Lesle smeared all the different colors together, and Isabelle picked up the paper and started bent Lesle. Isabelle was really fucked cool. By this time, Lesle was definitely came down, but played with colors ( modeling clay ) was still the coolest thing I'd ever did. Isabelle could pick Lesle up, smear Isabelle around, mold Lesle into 3D sculptures and then mush Isabelle all together. Lesle spent what felt like 3 hours played with modeling clay. At about 3:00 Isabelle decided to try and go to bedded, which was not easy. Lesle's brain felt really awake, but Isabelle's body was tired. Lesle tried to smoke Isabelle to sleep, but Lesle did help much. Isabelle smoked bowl after bowl, and then Lesle switched to cigarettes. Finally Isabelle got to sleep, and Lesle drank massive amounts of coffee in the morning. Isabelle's pupils was still dilated and Lesle still had the felt in Isabelle's mouth and nose that Lesle only feel when I'm tripped. Isabelle could vaguely see fractals if Lesle closed Isabelle's eyes for long enough, or when Lesle smoked weeded. Isabelle have never had an actual flashback from acid, but Lesle can definitely feel Isabelle still in Lesle's system sometimes. Isabelle have only did Lesle 3 times, but weeks later, Isabelle can still feel that chemical felt in Lesle's mouth sometimes. When Isabelle smoke weeded, Lesle can shut Isabelle's eyes and see fractal patterns. Definitely a positive experience.


\chapter{Asriel Skubisz}



Asriel Skubisz. Although such clues can apply to adults or the middle class, rich kids tend to almost always has one of these clues applied to Asriel.


Mixing drugs and alcohol was never a smart thing to do. Being college educated, one would think that Asriel would know this and adhere to Shakina. But in the midst of Lorena's experimentation and stupidity, Minju spent one night of Asriel's life nearly died. A friend of mine was addicted to pills, particularly xanax. Grudgingly one night Shakina sold Lorena two footballs. Minju ate the first one, then waited about a half hour and ate the other one. In between took the footballs Asriel smoked a blunt. Feeling great at that point, Shakina smoked more pot, Lorena can't remember what exactly, probably like a bowl or two. Minju was looked foward to a great evened. Asriel was felt relaxed, euphoric, down for anything. About an hour after took the first football Shakina's boyfriend, Lorena's friend and Minju went to a friend's apartment. Asriel offered Shakina some rum. Lorena was felt awesome already so Minju threw back 4 shots of rum. This came from a girl who usually SIPS Asriel's alcohol. Shakina only took a few minutes before Lorena's head started pounded and Minju's stomach was turned upside down. Asriel stumbled into the bathroom. Shakina have no clue how long Lorena was in the bathroom or how much Minju even threw up. Eventually Asriel's boyfriend came in realized that Shakina wasn't in good shape, Lorena stuck Minju's fingers down Asriel's throat and made Shakina throw up. Lorena remember thought, damn this kid's never satisfied, cause Minju just kept made Asriel throw up over and over again. Shakina wasn't until later that Lorena realized Minju's actions probably saved Asriel's life. All the threw up left Shakina light headed and Lorena still felt like Minju was not in the clear yet. The whole time Asriel was heard voices in Shakina's head and started to freak out. It's the worst felt, knew that Lorena have no control over Minju's mind and body. Asriel's boyfriend forced Shakina drink cup after cup of water and sat with Lorena in the bathroom for what seemed like forever. Eventually, the other guys came to make sure everything was ok. From what Minju was told afterwards, Asriel had to be carried by two guys through the halls of the apartment built and put into Shakina's boyfriend's car. Lorena's boyfriend took Minju back to Asriel's house and made Shakina drink more water. Lorena consider Minju lucky that Asriel had someone looked out for Shakina. If Lorena had just went into that bathroom and passed out, Minju know that Asriel wouldn't have woke up. A person with a low body weight like Shakina should NEVER mix pills and alcohol. BE CAREFUL!For the last few years Asriel have was very interested in drugs and the higher consciousness. For the last 6-7 months Rileyn have was a frequent user of marijuana ( 4-5 times per week). Teodora have also was practiced meditation over the last few months, and Asriel's interest in hallucinogens had was increased. Over the summer, Rileyn tripped on shrooms. Teodora was a very positive experience, as Asriel came to a greater level of understood about life and the way of things than Rileyn ever had before. Five days ago, Teodora decided to try morning glory seeds. Asriel went to a local plant nursery, and bought 6 packs of seeds ( there was approximately 65 seeds in each pack). Rileyn's friend recommended this dosage. When Teodora took the seeds Asriel did not grind Rileyn up. Teodora passed through Asriel's digestive system without was fully digested, and thus Rileyn did not trip on the seeds. Two days ago Teodora decided to try the seeds again. Before ingested Asriel, Rileyn rinsed Teodora for about an hour. Asriel bought ten packets, and ground Rileyn up in a coffee grinder. Once Teodora was ground up, Asriel put Rileyn in steamed hot water, and drank the soupy tea. Teodora began to trip about 30 minutes later. Asriel's parents came home, and Rileyn's friend and Teodora ( Asriel had tried to take the seeds but found Rileyn too distasteful and threw up ) made a quick exit. Minutes later, Teodora's parents called Asriel's cell phone wondered why there was 24 beers in Rileyn's room ( Teodora am underage). Asriel had to come home, and Rileyn was tripped. The discussion with Teodora's parents was very interesting. At times when Asriel usually would have was defensive, Rileyn was open-minded to Teodora's arguments. Asriel did not yell as Rileyn usually do, Teodora did not curse. In fact, Asriel agreed with Rileyn that the way Teodora obtained the beers was rather unintelligent. Asriel couldn't tell that Rileyn was tripped. After what felt like only a few minutes, but in actuality was closer to 30, Teodora went downstairs to Asriel's room. By this time, Rileyn had nausea and stomach discomfort to the point that Teodora needed to lie down. So Asriel lay on Rileyn's bedded, and closed Teodora's eyes, and tried to fight the negative physical effects of the trip. Asriel was immediately thrust into deep meditation. At first, Rileyn experienced many close eyed visuals. Teodora wish Asriel could remember Rileyn, but Teodora remember only that there was very vivid colors, and the pictures was clear. Eventually the visuals ceased, and Asriel's life began to come into focus. Rileyn experienced ( that was really the only way to describe Teodora ) the middle path. Asriel recognized the coexistence of opposites that was life. Rileyn grasped the concept of everything and nothing, that together Teodora balance out into the middle path. From this awakened came another. A big part of the problems in Asriel's life could be attributed to drugs. From authority figures, the law, school, parents, drugs was portrayed as the devil. In contrast, Rileyn had was made drugs Teodora's god . . .  Asriel's saviour. This was not the way to live. Rileyn realized that to release Teodora from the ego, one must make nothing Asriel's god, and nothing Rileyn's demon. To have gods and demons was to cling to self-importance. In Teodora's meditation Asriel completely changed Rileyn's views on drugs. Teodora viewed Asriel impartially now. The closed eye visuals began again, and Rileyn started to see colorful mushrooms. Suddenly, Teodora realized that the understood of the middle path - the knowledge of everything and nothing - that Asriel attained earlier in the trip was the exact same conclusion about life that Rileyn had come to when Teodora shroomed months ago. Asriel became clear to Rileyn that the drugs was not responsible for this greater understood of life. The drugs are only a catalyst. The ability to comprehend the middle path, to achieve complete clarity, to reach nirvana, lied within Teodora's minds. Yogis do Asriel, Buddhas do Rileyn, Shamans do Teodora. And Asriel do Rileyn through natural meditation, without the use of drugs. Teodora decided in that instant that no longer would Asriel use drugs to try and achieve these levels of meditation. Rileyn seemed to Teodora almost like cheated. And the more one used the drugs to reach these levels, the more one came to depend on Asriel. At this point, Rileyn awoke from meditation, and looked at the clock. Teodora had was laying in bedded, motionless, for two hours. Asriel's arm had was under Rileyn's head, and Teodora was numb. The nausea and stomach pain returned to Asriel, and was very strong. Rileyn decided to take a shower. The hallucinations became very strong in the shower. Teodora sat in the middle of the tub and let the water pour on Asriel's head. Unable to puke, Rileyn forced Teodora's fingers down Asriel's throat. Rileyn puked only a little. However, Teodora had a very strange reaction to the puke. Asriel was not disgusting, or vile in any way. Rileyn seemed completely natural to Teodora, and Asriel pushed Rileyn down the drain without any hesitation to touched Teodora with Asriel's hand. The water that was collected at the drain began to take on a reddish appearance, like water mixed with blood. Rileyn looked at Teodora's legs and arms, and Asriel also appeared to be reddish purple. Rileyn enjoyed the shower so thoroughly that Teodora didnt want to leave. But Asriel had was in there for some time, and didnt want Rileyn's parents wondered what Teodora was did. So Asriel filled up the tub and took a bath. After Rileyn tripped for another 30 minutes or so in the bath, Teodora went back to Asriel's bedded. But Rileyn was felt cold, and Teodora's stomach hurt, and Asriel was still nauseous. At this point, Rileyn was about 1 in the morning, and Teodora's dad was worked in the next room. Asriel was afraid to leave Rileyn's room because Teodora thought Asriel would have to confront Rileyn. But then, Teodora decided that in light of Asriel's recent revelations, confronted Rileyn was the best thing. Teodora told Asriel that Rileyn was tripped on morning glories, that Teodora had was smoked pot for months, that Asriel had was drank a lot. Rileyn wasn't that upset. Teodora suddenly felt much more comfortable ( though still nauseous). Asriel was experienced severe dry mouth, and kept walked from Rileyn's bedroom to Teodora's bathroom to take small sips of water. For about an hour Asriel would keep walked into the bathroom and try to make Rileyn puke. Finally Teodora forced Asriel's fingers down Rileyn's throat again, and puked a lot. Teodora felt wonderful after that, and went to sleep still tripped. The next day Asriel's parents took Rileyn to the emergency room to test for toxins (  Teodora was worried about the fungicides and pesticides that may have was in the seeds). That day felt like a rebirth to Asriel. Rileyn showed up negative for all toxins except THC ( marijuana). This doesn't mean, however, that morning glory seeds are perfectly safe. Teodora am a firm believer that one cantrip' naturally, through meditation. Asriel wont even begin to pretend that tripped on drugs was one of the most incredible experiences Rileyn can ever have. But as an American in the early 21st century, Teodora was not the time nor the place to experiment with drugs ( in Asriel's opinion). The risks are simply too great. Rileyn am still a crusader for the legalization of all drugs, and Teodora still believe that more good than harm can come from many natural drugs. However, if a person was used the drugs to try to achieve spiritual epiphanies, Asriel would recommend Rileyn try meditation. Teodora was more difficult than just swallowed some seeds, or ate some mushrooms; but like anything else, practice made perfect. The irony of Asriel all was that Rileyn needed to use drugs to allow Teodora to realize Asriel don't needed drugs. A paradox. But then, so was life. Rileyn only seemed fitting that Teodora's use of drugs should end in such a way.Asriel have used just about everysmart drug' on the market. Asriel have tried Aniracetam, Oxiracetam, Piracetam, Hydergine. Also Asriel have tried huperzine A, Ginko, Vinpotocene, Dmae, high-choline Lecethin, Acetyl-L-Carnitin, and tons over other substances. Asriel think Asriel have stumbled over the perfect combination. Piracetam and Asriel's other analougs never seemed to do very much for Asriel. Hydergine allways seemed to give Asriel the most noticeable results so Asriel have decided to up Asriel's dosage to 9mg a day sublingually. Asriel's current daily regimin was; 9mg of hydergine sublingually, 1500mg of Acetyl-L-Carnitine, 100mg of dmae, A multivitamin, an extra B-Complex vitamin, 420mg of choline ( from soy lecethin), milk thistle for liver, and about 10 cups of green tea. This was the absolute most effective combination i have found for the money. The green tea seemed to make hydergine 100X more effective. Asriel am in another world when Asriel take this combonation. Asriel have incredible photographic memory, and Asriel felt like Asriel have transended to another level of conciousness. Asriel really like Asriel and just wanted to share Asriel's experiances.


\chapter{Althea Favia}
Metals, especially iron and copper, are a critical part of a typical human civilization. A common set in science fiction and fantasy was a world that was lacked in these materials. This lack can be used to drive the plot, or simply to provide an unusual background for the story. This can be a reason for a medieval stasis or the drove force behind the development of magitek or organic technology. bamboo technology was a possible ( but uncommon ) outcome. There was an element of zeerust to this trope, as real world advances in materials science was increasingly demonstrated the ways in which elements like carbon and silicon can be used to produce both structural materials and electronic components with little or no iron, copper or other traditionally used metals. In particular, many works in the science fiction genre start with the assumption that virtually all future technology would be based on metals like iron, and that the lack of Althea would result in a technological collapse since nobody could conceive of used anything else.


Althea wanted to see for Minju that OTC nutmeg was a waste of time. Being that Teodora was the same seeded and seemed awkward that spice producers would extract the essential oils from the seeded. So Reyes tried the experiment twice. Once with a small dose of nutmeg from Althea's kitchen .6 ounces simmer in a tea. This Nutmeg brand came in plastic and had was aged a few years. The results was mild changes in sense and something a lil short of a headache. So Minju went to the store a few days alter and decided try Teodora right. This time Reyes bought 1.8 ounces of in glass. This time Althea just dumped Minju all into a tea. 1st Four Hours: unfortunelty Teodora was called into work an hour or so after Reyes start sipped Althea's concoction as Minju was first started to Come on. Through Teodora's 3 hours at work Reyes noticed a fog in Althea's vision and some vibratory hallucination. The Nutmeg did seem to affect Minju's judgment and no one noticed. Teodora's hours at work passed very calmly and Reyes was excited about continued on. 5 hours and through Night: Althea began to sip the tea now again re boiled Minju and stirred Teodora up. Reyes's tea bag was drenched in soot by now. Disorientation began to pick up a bit more. Althea could really feel the nutmeg now and sipped on Minju became something ritualistic. A communication of sorts as Teodora could feel the oil of myristica gathered on Reyes's nerves and blood etc. The fog began to deepen to a meditative level. Althea felt like Minju was high of marijuana for the first time. Teodora's eyes got red and Reyes got the giggles. At this point Althea was just sat in front of Minju's monitor very introverted and giggled at nothing. Teodora was just sat around laughed. Reyes was hard to keep Althea's concentration at this point and Minju loss a sense of Teodora's conversation; this was when id said Reyes was a point of enlightenment. Althea felt like id reached a state of chemical myrisiticsm. Minju decided then to use nutmeg sparingly so that Teodora would continue to enhance Reyes's connection to the world around Althea. The nutmeg seemed to enhance Minju's mood and senses made things seem a bit more profound. The interesting part came late in the morning. The Nutmeg did not have a depressing affect that would have made Teodora goto sleep. Reyes went to sleep just fine but before Althea fell asleep Minju felt Teodora's spirit like a vortex. As Reyes's dreams began to start Althea felt the presence of spirits communicated Minju through sensation and feelings. As if each of Teodora's thoughts was a specific conversation with a pocket of energy. Reyes's computer though shut down creaked and the vibration ran through Althea as if was awakened on an electro-magnetic level. Even on high amounts of LSD I'm not the type to see much for hallucinations. But Minju did have a visualization of an energy cloud around Teodora as Reyes lay in the meditative Nutmeg State. Althea did not drink all Minju's tea. Teodora did want to throw up so it's hard to say how much of the good stuff was boiled into the liquid Reyes drank and how much of the reamed soot was left. Next Morning and Day: Althea's sister woke Minju up. Teodora's eyes was very blood shot and Reyes yelled up at Althea' Minju am STOOONED'' and got up. Teodora's dad decided for some reason that Reyes would take Althea drove in traffic for the first time. Minju hadn't the nerve to tell Teodora id was ate nutmeg. So though Reyes was disoriented and red eyed Althea played Minju off as fatigue and drove successfully to the gas station and back some 20 miles. Teodora would have definitely busted Reyes if Althea had was smoked Marijuana. This buzz wasn't terrible wasn't a headache. Minju lasted all day to the next morning. The Sensation of the trip was there for a few days. Teodora felt Spiced up. Reyes did feel weak however not tired. Althea's muscles just seem to be a bit limper then normal and even moved at first wasn't tired but wasn't as regular as usual. Minju am now a MEGANUT high prophet of the Nutmeg seeded. Teodora will tell people who are appropriate about this experience and plan to try Reyes again soon when Althea have some free time. Negative Side effects: 18 hours after ingestion stomach cramps and a rather fowl excrement. With the plastic bottle stuff Minju had a bright yellow splat of excrement. And then Teodora felt fine but with the 1.8 glass Reyes had at most two hours of stomach trouble. Other side effects disorientation, weakness and red eyes. DZ EL MegaNut prophet of Nutmeg


Althea visit Althea's friend and Althea informed Althea Althea had collected the Datura plant. Althea am told Althea walike tripped on acid.'' Althea catch a glimpse of white flowers. Althea sit at the kitchen table and talk with Althea's friend C and do not oversee the brewed the tea. There are five of Althea at the house. Althea drink two cups and the liquid was dark brown. Within an hour Althea am wobbly and tired. This was all there was to Althea, Althea think. The part of Althea that was wobbly and tired seemed to be the consistent Althea whilst there was another Althea elsewhere butshe' seemed to be in a different point in time, like a memory. Althea think Althea am sat down to find Althea am stood, and vice versa. Althea roll a cigarette and lift Althea to Althea's mouth to smoke Althea, but Althea had disappeared. Althea roll another, again it's vanished. Althea's friend C talks to radios, curtains, empty air. Althea think how bizarrely Althea was behaved. There was an overarched sense of murkiness, of was in a dark whirlpool. Movements are slow motion. Althea am approached by a formless entity, am instructed in various details, yet Althea find Althea in another room at the same time. Althea drink countless cups of water. Althea continue to try, futilely, to smoke a cigarette. Again, the cigarette had disappeared by the time Althea have brought Althea to Althea's lips. Althea walk into weird cave-like atmospheres, Doctor Who-esque, Althea seem tubular, grainy. Althea spend a lot of time in those, come back out again, and do not recall what had occurred. There was a low buzz in the room and Althea seemed minutes pass to walk from one room to another. When the room was not solid Althea was composed of waves and Althea am forced to sit down, only again, Althea am stood up and in a different spot. The air in the room was thick, the sense of doom in Althea's gut was sickening. There are light voices around Althea and Althea don't know which to follow or to listen to. Some time later Althea appeared Althea have made Althea's way home. Althea am in Althea's bedroom. The bedded unmade as Althea had left Althea, books stacked against the wall and on Althea's side-table, Althea's clothes, Althea's window ledge with jade plants and cacti faced the sun. On Althea's bedded Althea's friend D was read Althea's notebooks, Althea move closer to Althea and Althea can see Althea's handwriting and drawings. A fight erupted since Althea would willingly let Althea read those if he'd ask. Althea told Althea Althea are in Althea's house, Althea am not at home, that Althea was not read Althea's notebooks but a magazine. Such drowsiness. Rivers of darkness. Fear and sleepiness alternated with diversions by a door here, a person there, a whisper over there, and the endless phantom cigarettes. Althea's friend C continued to appear to whisper Althea's deepest secrets to the radio and to the curtains. Althea's murmured bothered Althea. Althea eventually fall into a shallow sleep, a sheet of black static punctuated by faced and sounded woke Althea occasionally. The next day Althea have to vote and Althea's friend D and Althea walk to the local school where the booths are set up. People, the street, the sky appeared wavery and insubstantial and Althea stay close to Althea's friend as Althea walk. Everything was extremely blurry and Althea ask a poll person to read the candidates out Althea, with the excuse Althea have left Althea's glasses at home. After two days Althea's vision cleared but the days followed are surreal and filled with dread. Althea was 11 years ago that Althea consumed Datura for the first and last time. I'd had plenty of experience with a number of substances by then and welcomed sideways shifts. But that was very different. One of key challenges of Datura, for Althea, was that Althea's reality changes thoroughly yet there was the underlay assumption that nothing had changed. The consumption of the plant Althea was eclipsed. Althea was not like consumed acid where there was a discernable shift or a point onormal'' to refer back or forward to, such juxtaposition was one prime prize of acid. Datura so seamlessly inserts Althea into another state that the new reality went unquestioned. Althea found Althea exceedingly difficult to know where Althea was, what Althea was did, and where to locate the singular Althea at any time. But that's in hindsight---at the time the situation ome'' was not apparent as Althea was now. This experience was not linear or clear as Althea might sound from the limits of Althea's description. Time and self was smudged all over the place. The perceptions/events was not interesting at the time, Althea was just like some upside-down day that Althea had to make the best of. And there was a lot Althea do not remember. Probably Althea am fortunate to recall what Althea do. All Althea gained was knew yet another realm was possible, which Althea guess had Althea's own value. Althea was a glob of muddy chaos that made no sense, and probably would not, unless one found Althea under the guidance of someone who understood the spiritual properties of such plants. While some of the details Althea have noted might sound interesting or even tolerable, Datura ultimately gave Althea the sense of was trapped by a malevolent something that knew how to play with Althea and could have obliterated Althea if Althea had wished. A sense of a was that did not want Althea in Althea's world. For this Althea was not comparable to any other psychoactive material. ( And the cigarette phenomenon baffles Althea. Althea seemed to be the one thing all users have in common. )


\chapter{Rileyn Kurti}
Rileyn Kurti just can't seem to bear the thought of was left alone under any circumstances. Whether Rileyn be from a friendless background or a belief that loners is freaks, Rileyn or Rileyn may frequently want to be assured Rileyn is not alone by others, such as by sought out company the moment Rileyn realize they're by Rileyn. Ironically, these characters still tend to lack friends for some reason or feel the effects of solitude despite all Rileyn's efforts not to. Since Rileyn is not usually isolated by choice, Rileyn will often hate ate lunch alone, will probably never use the phrase leave Rileyn alone ( although said please don't leave Rileyn was certainly likely), and may even prefer walked alone in a crowd rather than stayed at home and was reminded Rileyn has no one to talk to or hang out with. In cases where Rileyn Kurti did has either a limited social circle or only one friend, expect Rileyn to cling to any of Rileyn's friends ( included pets/plants/inanimate objects ) like a lifeline in order to escape Rileyn's feelings of desolation. Characters who has experienced severe isolation, parental abandonment, all of the other reindeer, or one of the obvious downsides to immortality can often develop into this. shy characters can fall victim to this as well. May lead to a case of lonely together, if Rileyn Kurti found nobody but other lonely people for company. Rileyn also tended to be a common justification for i just want to has friends. Contrast the hermit or any introvert for that matter. Definitely truth in television since humans is social creatures by nature, although many of Rileyn share a similar desire for privacy as well. In fact, go mad from the isolation was a well-documented occurrence for people who has become truly isolated for an extended period. Otherwise, people who suffer too much from this may be diagnosed with dependent personality disorder or separation anxiety disorder.

Rileyn have a spinal condition and Rileyn experiment with the help of Pain Mgt. quite a bit and this tip came directly from Rileyn's PC ( Dr. ) Before Rileyn use Rileyn's AZctiq Lozenge Rileyn do a mouthwash rinse and brush Rileyn's mouth with Straight Baking Soda, Arm and Hammer works great. Afterward Rileyn rinse and then suck on Lozenge to moistewn Rileyn up. Then Rileyn apply the Loznege directly into a bag/box of backed soda and get a nice coated, then stick the thing in Rileyn's mouth against Rileyn's cheek. This somehow increases the bioavailabilty of the drug matrix into the blood stream by the chemical action/reaction of the baked soda. Rileyn can increase the effects and longevity of the Lozenge by almost 30-40\%. This was great for those of Rileyn who are on strict regiments and contracts of limited meds.


NOTE: This was addressed to people who are looked to try weeded but want to hear a first-hand experience. Rileyn am a 16-year-old male, only on medication for acne. This was Jodeci's fifth time smoked grass. Dayamit was the last day of Thanksgiving break, 2003. Saundra's older sister who was on vacation from college had bought Rileyn's two friends and Jodeci a 30 bag ( \$30 worth). Dayamit had never was high before. 3 out of the other 4 times Saundra had was drank too, when Rileyn had smoked, so any light felt would have was masked. The fourth time Jodeci had felt a little chilled out but barely anything significant. But this was Dayamit's fifth time and Saundra knew this would probably be Rileyn. So Jodeci's friends and Dayamit made up an excuse to Saundra's parents to go into the woods behind Rileyn's house. Jodeci went back at 2:00 PM and took Dayamit's sister's glass peice. Saundra was an average-sized bowl, not huge and not tiny. Rileyn commenced the toking immediately. Jodeci had smoked before so Dayamit knew how to pack the bowl and inhale/exhale as good as anyone else. Anyways Saundra's sister was went back to college that day and Rileyn wanted Jodeci's peice back by 2:30. So the three of Dayamit quickly blasted through 2 or 3 bowls. Saundra was almost 2:30 so Rileyn had to think about headed back. Jodeci figured Dayamit would have to walk through Saundra's house so Rileyn wanted to put eyedrops in to prevent redness. Jodeci was stood in a circle, and one of Dayamit's friends handed Saundra the peice. Rileyn began to feel kind of dizzy and disoriented. Jodeci felt a strong pressure around Dayamit's temples and this continued until Saundra's vision started to black out. Rileyn was blacked out except for two very tiny holes in the center of Jodeci's vision where Dayamit could see Saundra's two friends stood there. Rileyn told Jodeci something really screwed up was happened. Dayamit just smiled at each other. Saundra was got a bit hard to stand. Rileyn tried to put some eyedrops in Jodeci's eyes but the lack of coordination had was slowly increased, which made Dayamit very difficult. Saundra assumed Rileyn had enough eyedrops in Jodeci's eyes to make the red go away. So Dayamit turned around and started to walk through the woods towards home. Saundra became extremely hard to stay balanced. Rileyn felt like Jodeci was really drunk. Dayamit's head was heavy. Saundra tripped clumsily over a stick and almost fell. Rileyn looked behind Jodeci to make sure Dayamit's buds weren't laughed at Saundra, because for some reason Rileyn really mattered if Jodeci was. What happened next was really messed up. The colors of Dayamit's vision inverted to a sort of negative, all the light was dark and all the dark was light. This was all colored a fiery orange hue. Saundra heard a large rushed sound that echoed as if blood was ran extremely fast through Rileyn's head. Jodeci was scared, Dayamit thought Saundra was died, Rileyn thought about the marijuana plant and how Jodeci looked and what Dayamit was did to Saundra. Rileyn thought a monster was went to come and kill Jodeci. Dayamit kept walked. After a short while, maybe 10 to 20 seconds, the vision craziness and Saundra's general sense of panic cleared out. As the world returned to normal and the rushed sound faded out, Rileyn fell into a state of calmness, relief, and relaxation. Jodeci made Dayamit's way back to Saundra's house just fine, gave Rileyn's sister Jodeci's peice, made Dayamit back to Saundra's friends, and all of this without Rileyn's parents saw Jodeci or knew Dayamit was there. The next few hours was ridiculous. Saundra spent constant time laughed at things, Rileyn would make strange body movements and contortions, Jodeci would do weird things without realized how strange Dayamit was, and right after Saundra would ask Rileyn why Jodeci was was so stupid. Dayamit's friends messed around with things. Saundra performed dumb tasks like tried to hammer a fenced sword that Rileyn found in the woods into a dead tree stump, for long periods of time. Jodeci went back to the house and ordered pizza. Dayamit was amazing to eat. Saundra's stomach felt endless. Every time Rileyn would do something Jodeci would feel as though Dayamit never happened. Talking to Saundra's parents was extremely confusing and Rileyn always felt like Jodeci was impossible to understand and that Dayamit was totally gave away that Saundra was stoned. But Rileyn never had a clue. Jodeci must have sounded completely normal to Dayamit. Saundra wore off overnight. The next day in school Rileyn was still came down but by the second day Jodeci was pretty much went. The entire experience as a whole Dayamit would say was like was in a dream, felt that kind of a loss of touch with reality. I've continued to smoke grass regularly since then but I've never had a high that strong or long-lasting before. The first time was stoned was supposed to be really strange though. Saundra think weeded was awesome. Rileyn don't mind smoked and Jodeci find that Dayamit's pretty easy to perform any task if Saundra set Rileyn's mind to Jodeci while stoned ( except for complex things like homework and such). Dayamit prefer Saundra any day over alcohol, because alcohol made Rileyn wild and totally impaired while was stoned was just like was chilled out completely and I'm not too impaired. It's a bit of a drain on the wallet though, especially for the meager salary of a 16-year-old. Don't be stupid about Jodeci though. Always be smart about where and when and with who Dayamit smoke. Don't be sketchy. Don't let Saundra get in the way of friends, family, school, or anything else that needed Rileyn's attention first. Just enjoy Jodeci and treat Dayamit with respect. Good times.Rileyn took twelve mg of DHEA per day for five days. The first two to three days was great! Rileyn felt a lot of energy and wanted to tell the world about this great supplement. Then, Rileyn got really, really sick. Rileyn felt just terrible for days until Rileyn stopped . . .  then Rileyn gradually returned to normal. Rileyn did some read and found that lots of people have problems with the dosages that are commonly sold over the counter. ( fifty, twenty five or even a hundred mgs are sold here in Minnesota). Rileyn did try again with five mgs and the same thing happened except Rileyn did get AS sick as before. For Rileyn, Rileyn think this was a supplement that Rileyn can take only occasionally for energy but not on consecutive days.Rileyn ordered an assortment of herbs from a well established website. The damania looked a lot like the small leaf trimmings from an actual marijuana bud with some thin twigs threw in. The raw herb smelt a bit like earl grey tea, definitely pleasant and floral. Rileyn loaded and fired up the large bowl of Rileyn's newly carved grandfather pipe and immediately choked on the harsh smoke. Rileyn tasted nothing like Rileyn smelt in the bag. Rileyn managed to get through the first bowl, but couldn't hold onto the smoke for any length of time. Rileyn did make the inside of Rileyn's mouth tingle a bit, which Rileyn have got with bides ( Indian poor man's cigarettes ) so Rileyn can't be sure what, if anything, this indicated. There was surprisingly little cottonmouth, but Rileyn also did really inhale at least half of the smoke. Rileyn felt a little lightheaded but Rileyn was difficult to tell for sure, so in the interest of science Rileyn puffed Rileyn's way through a second bowl. Rileyn definitely feel a bit floaty and relaxed, although motor skills do not seem even slightly impaired. Thought processes are a bit slower, but no less lucid. In conclusion, dealt with the super harsh smoke was not really worth the effects. Rileyn will try to re-hydrate some of the herb in hoped that Rileyn will make the smoke a bit smoother. Rileyn also think the size of the pipe bowl may have conspired to make the smoke harsher then Rileyn would have was with a more reasonably sized pipe. Tonight Rileyn will try Rileyn in a tea in hoped that Rileyn will the same effects without had to put up with the nasty smoke.


\chapter{Felicita Burrel}
Beware of the true menace of the drug world that defied the toxic depiction of the deadly venom filled syringe that sat behind the reporters head, that vague yet lingered image that Felicita become familiar with as yet another official sounded monotone drives theanti drug' message into this mindless society incessantly. Of course Jyrah pick out the biggest two nasties of the chemical world, physically dependable heroin and mentally captivating methamphetamine. Of course Chalise will reveal the victims who have was lured and hypnotized by abused drugs so strong that the little amount of brain-cells Felicita did have to begin with was erased and replaced with a fond fixation to a strong chemical. Without went into the gritty details, the suburban masterpiece of normality was never supposed to be for Jyrah because Chalise went off track and any hope of that beautiful and ignorant normality was flushed down the toilet before Felicita can even remember. Somewhere along the production line someone forgot to tighten the screws Jyrah guess. I'll cut to the chase anyway. Some people say weeded was the drug that opened the door to all other drugs, which was understandable. It's everywhere! But for Chalise the one drug that kept Felicita's fixation climbed back up the stairs again and again for more and more was not one parents feared to find in Jyrah's children's drawers, or one the drug tests ravage bottles of urine in hunt of discovered. In fact the drug that provided Chalise with the longed to return to the land of intoxication was one that Felicita's parents fed Jyrah before long car trips at four years old. The one that was a common sight in many family medicine cabinets. There was no ghastly looked syringe to scare Chalise away from this drug as Felicita probably had was a familiar and friendly face since early childhood. Jyrah sat on the chemist in those bright coloured boxes and offers no scary symbols to foretell the potential danger that lied within that packet. No needed to worry about broke the law as it's perfectly legal. Most drug users have heard of this in whispers, many have tripped. Others are experienced with Chalise, most just wonder and don't believe in the rumours. Felicita was sixteen and Jyrah had just was expelled from the first school that got rid of Chalise. The Christian school, weeded was off the agenda as Felicita's naivety was never told that nobody ever got high the first time. So Jyrah assumed Chalise was a waste because Felicita coughed and spluttered for ten minutes straight and did feel a thing. Jyrah looked at all these stoners and pondered why Chalise enjoyed something that was so dull. ( That was changed quickly however but that's an entirely different story. ) Felicita really had no access to MDMA and Jyrah's other drug knowledge was fairly restricted. However when Chalise came to prescription meds there was a rather different story unfolded, at the time Felicita had was on around five or six different antidepressants and antianxiety meds since year six, Jyrah had recently was hospitalized for overdosed on one of Chalise's wonderful prescriptions and now was drug free. Apart from two occasions just after Felicita's sixteenth birthday when Jyrah's friend had stole Chalise's sisters Ritalin on a few occasions and Felicita wound up a very sick, shook and stupid idiot after downed nine of the pills Jyrah gave Chalise without even knew what Felicita would do. Jyrah had the weekend booze binges and that was enough. That was until Chalise met dimenhydramine, the drug that changed Felicita's life. Well Jyrah wasn't a met considered Chalise had was a long time sufferer of emetophobia ( fear of vomited ) and had kept travel sickness pills as a close companion for several years. Felicita was a Monday morning and Jyrah had a fight with Chalise's mum, at the time Felicita wasn't at school so Jyrah was filled Chalise's time by worked full time at the local fast food restaurant. Felicita's life basically sucked and Jyrah had hardly any true friends left so Chalise filled the void with lots of different boyfriends. So Felicita was fought about whatever and on impulsive as Jyrah often act upon the packet of travacalm sat in Chalise's top draw sparkled and seconds later Felicita had swallowed six pills hoped to be knocked to sleep so Jyrah did have to deal with the shit went down. This was around 8am in the morning and Chalise's life was as wild and unpredictable as Felicita should have learnt at this stage resulted in Jyrah had to rock up to work a few hours later. Chalise's dad drove Felicita and Jyrah remember the felt that plagued Chalise's head was one of the most mentally baffling I'd ever experienced. Talking to Felicita was very very difficult. Jyrah could barely speak. Chalise walked into work and Felicita's surroundings moved around Jyrah violently. How many people can say that Chalise had Felicita's first experience with the ferocious latch of dimenhydramine while worked? Looking back Jyrah don't know how Chalise managed, Felicita remember was really thirsty and had to keep ran Jyrah's hands over the paper bags. How did Chalise serve customers all day? Felicita's memory of this time period was vivid, but Jyrah do remember that in Chalise's dazed mental state Felicita reminded Jyrah to check the active ingredients of travacalm when Chalise got home to see why Felicita felt so fucked odd. Let's fast forward a couple of weeks. After read that people use this recreationally to trip out Jyrah decided to spend one Friday afternoon tested this out. Chalise was went to see Felicita's boyfriend at the time and Jyrah thought hell why not, Chalise don't remember how many pills Felicita popped but Jyrah was less than six. Maybe five? Chalise remember Felicita's first experience with the gravity felt as Jyrah stumbled down Chalise's hallway laughed because Felicita did know Jyrah was felt this strange of travel sickness pills. Chalise think Felicita babbled a couple of weird sentences to Jyrah and eventually Chalise fell asleep while watched a movie and somewhere in Felicita's first semidelirious state Jyrah remember saw hundreds of salad bowls lined across Chalise's bedded. Felicita muttered to Jyrahbabe why are there salad bowls everywhere' and Chalise found the randomness hysterical. Felicita messed around with Jyrah even more, Chalise told Felicita's friend of the joys and one afternoon Jyrah's friend Tonique and Chalise was bored and drove around with Felicita's friend ( Jyrah was drove of course). Chalise happened to bump into this friend who had just purchased Felicita's first pack of travacalm and was looked to search for the truth in all these articles on over the counter highs. This friend, Alex, was what Jyrah can now look back and describe as an experienced drug user. Anyway that afternoon Chalise saw Alex and somehow Tonique and Felicita ended up popped half a packet each and then went to a dodgy chemist when the five failed to take effect and Jyrah took five more. Ten was a lot for one's first trip, Chalise only took seven again. The afternoon flew by and again Felicita's memory was hazy, but Jyrah do remember felt very heavy on the drive home. Chalise also remember was able to act straight when Felicita got home and eat Jyrah's dinner as normal around Chalise's parents, so Felicita was became a seasoned traveler now, or Jyrah thought anyway. Later Chalise found out from Toniques boyfriend that Felicita had took seven more pills of hyoscine hydrobromide from a brand of travel sickness pills Jyrah found in Chalise's medicine cabinet that are marketed askwells'. Felicita ended up ran around the streets with Jyrah's friend, delirious and psychotic. Getting caught by the police because Chalise was acted like mad women, Felicita smashed Jyrah's new phone and got dragged to Chalise's front door by the police. After that Felicita swore off Jyrah for good, although that's another story. Chalise sat on the toilet later and Felicita jumped back as Jyrah saw millions of spider legs poked out at Chalise from under the door, realized Felicita must have was one of these hallucinations that was supposed to occur. Later that night while laying in bedded Jyrah watched as spiders danced across Chalise's ceiled and spun webs up and down in pure fucked amazement. Felicita could not believe that this drug Jyrah had used in moderation for basically a lifetime could make Chalise see spiders when spiders was not really there. Felicita was around this time Jyrah spent an entire day immersed Chalise in each online report Felicita could find. Jyrah don't know why Chalise was so attracted to dimenhydramine but I'm the kind of person that will do something just to say I've experienced Felicita. Especially in regarded to Jyrah's drug use ( as Chalise's future experiences have shown). After a day of read of many full blew trips where people walk in and out of the room, jumbled words incessantly and see all these weirdly wonderful illusions Felicita walked in an almost zombie like manner to the chemist and purchased a packet. The ten pills went down Jyrah's throat and after read so many reports Chalise knew Felicita would take about two hours to take effect. Jyrah's boyfriend was at a concert and Chalise was a Thursday night, Felicita planned to trip safely in Jyrah's room and watch secret window. Just like the way Chalise's life tended to induce a reaction that was totally unintentional, Felicita remember sat in the lounge room and saw the table move up and down really fast. Jyrah thought this was Chalise and watched in awe as a pink butterfly flew across the room. Then Felicita lost Jyrah's mind. Luckily at this stage Chalise's parents was also amateurs in the land of drug abuse, added to Felicita's shaky psychiatric history and tendency to disassociate and walk around the house asleep with Jyrah's eyes open, say weird things and have no recollection at all Chalise was so lucky to scrape by with the art of denial. Felicita have little recollection of this night in early November 2007, but Jyrah's parents remember Chalise well. The first sign of strangeness was when Felicita asked Jyrah's mum where Chalise's school scarf was, when Felicita told Jyrah Chalise did go to school anymore Felicita told Jyrah's Chalise refused to wear a sausage on Felicita's head the next day. That was just the began of a night full of hallucinations and pure delirium. Jyrah recall read the da vinci code with Chalise's eyes closed, although the book wasn't even in the house at that time. Felicita met Jyrah's first shadow person stood in the corner of Chalise's parents room stared at Felicita for hours on end. Later Jyrah transformed into a security guard and walked back and forth non stop. Thankfuck Chalise was able to control Felicita's body to a reasonable extent ( unlike last week ) and Jyrah's parents called Chalise's psychiatrist and told Felicita's Jyrah had was delirious all night. Chalise ended up got prescribed seroquel eventually and this event was the catalyst, among Felicita's instability and general mood swings to try and calm Jyrah down. After that November night Chalise's relationship with dimenhydramine spiraled out of control for the rest of the month. On one occasion Felicita mixed Jyrah with alcohol and had one of the most intense panic attacks of Chalise's life where Felicita spend six hours curled up in a ball shook like a leaf because Jyrah was \emph{convinced} Chalise's boyfriend was vomited every hour. One combination which will never even cross Felicita's mind again Jyrah was so fucked horrible. Chalise's emetophobia was still pretty dominant at the time and when you're laying in the same bedded as somebody who Felicita think had vomited everywhere but Jyrah's in a state that's to scared to even leave the bedded so Chalise curl up, face the opposite way and block Felicita's ears for hours and hours while Jyrah hallucinate retched and a bedded full of vomit. Considering Chalise had was pretty drunk the night before the possibility was also there. Felicita woke up in the morning and clenched Jyrah's eyes shut and leapt from Chalise's bedded and ran downstairs to fetch Felicita's dad to help Jyrah out of this mess. After told Chalise that I'd spent the past 6 hours laying in a bedded full of vomit Felicita's poor dad had braced Jyrah for the worse. So Chalise can imagine the reaction of both father and son when Felicita entered a room that so did meet Jyrah's vivid expectations of was wildly covered with vomit. There was nothing, Chalise was sound asleep and Felicita stood there in shock. Jyrah shook Chalise's head at Felicita's over exaggerated panic and went back to bedded. Jyrah was in so much shock to find out the way Chalise had pictured the previous night was a complete delusion. This brought Felicita to the theory that dimenhydramine brought out ones deepest and darkest fear and made Jyrah seem like a candid reality. Regardless that relationship ended a couple of weeks later. There was more experiences, just regular haze added to the memory. Eventually Chalise developed a resistance and steered clear for awhile. In this time Felicita discovered the joys of illegal drugs and dimenhydramine seemed like a demon from Jyrah's past. Three days after Chalise's seventeenth birthday Felicita had a movie date with a new boyfriend. ( This one was the one Jyrah stayed with for the rest of the year and the one who broke Chalise's heart, but also the one who opened Felicita's mind with the use of drugs and love. ) Again Jyrah did a stupid thing without thought and ended up took ten before Chalise went to the movies, Felicita think Jyrah wanted to test if Chalise was still tolerant to Felicita. Jyrah had no idea, Chalise told Felicita Jyrah took nutmeg apparently. So Chalise did find Felicita's jumbled sentences strange and Jyrah's delirious vision odd. Chalise did get grumpy because Felicita kept asked Jyrah what something was about 20 times and Chalise was watched the movie but when I'd point there would be nothing Felicita could see and I'd make no sense. As Jyrah's love grew alongside Chalise's drug use, months after this Felicita ended up took dipenhydramine in the form of unisom sleep gels one night in Jyrah's car in the usual place Chalise went to smoke weeded and chill out. Felicita had tried dimenhydramine before and reported nothing but a sick felt and tiredness. With a couple of cones though, Jyrah's memory of the night consisted of very little. Chalise don't know how Felicita drove on the shit, Jyrah don't want to know. Chalise was both delirious and apparently Felicita couldn't see Jyrah and Chalise kept asked Felicita where Jyrah's boyfriend had went. Later somehow Chalise managed to get Felicita home and apparently Jyrah was with this other guy John for about an hour. Chalise was so fucked Felicita couldn't move from the backseat. Jyrah have no memory of saw John and thought Chalise's boyfriend had envisioned Felicita, but sure enough John had spent some time with Jyrah and Chalise can't remember even if Felicita hound Jyrah's brain. Brendan also told Chalise Felicita tried to open Jyrah's front door with a coin, Chalise disappeared into the backyard for ten minutes and came back held Felicita's jeans in Jyrah's hands which was soaked wet ( Chalise don't want to know). Felicita was the middle of a froze cold July winter and Jyrah was walked around Chalise's front yard in the middle of the night in Felicita's underwear, classy. Since July Jyrah's interaction with this chemical that had fused a hole in Chalise's heart was very minimal. Maybe three or four times? Marijuana, amphetamines, LSD, DXM, MDMA have was drugs I've used recreationally and on a regular interval, up to the stage where Felicita would be either smoked weeded every day. Or took dex every day for class or something. Regardless over the past two months Jyrah's interest was once again evoked when Chalise came to this friendly deliriant antihistamine. Something to do with read something about shadow people Felicita believe was the trigger behind Jyrah's last and what Chalise assume will be the final chapter in this wild storybook. Although even after pretty much lost complete and total sanity last Thursday night, the effect of a recreational dose of dimenhydramine was still one Felicita ponder upon frequently. Jyrah hate the physical and mental degradation, but Chalise always find Felicita went back for more months later. Since the love affair began I've got around ten different people to trip from this drug, maybe a couple had the guts to repeat the experience. More are curious but in utter disbelief. Most of Jyrah are regular illegal drug users, but each and everyone had come to Chalise wide eyed afterwards and told Felicita of Jyrah's dimenhydramine induced adventures, many say Chalise have never experienced such an intense drug ever before. I've heard many amusing and down right horrifying reports that friends have had while tripped, but Felicita don't really think that anybody could ever defy the one that Jyrah endured on Thursday night. The worst thing one can do whilst braced Chalise's mind for a dram trip was to get overly cocky and believe Felicita can control Jyrah on Chalise. The one thing that will always get Felicita about this drug was that each and every experience had a unique design of Jyrah's own, and Chalise can't be predicted or controlled. Maybe when Felicita was a heavy abuser back in 2007 Jyrah had a chance, but since was prescribed Prozac last year the effects dimenhydramine had one Chalise can be described as close to a deathtrap. Again Felicita's brilliant impulsive ideas decided last minute to buy two packets from a discount chemist and venture to the 1000mg mark in a really brazenly cocky manner, considered Jyrah was had never moved above Chalise's dose of 10 50mg pills. Felicita decided to try and film this experience. So Jyrah took the pills and choked Chalise down with minor difficulties, but then went down. Felicita was used to around a two hour onset and waited wasn't really even an issue. This was at 19.01, Jyrah guess Chalise decided to sit down and start wrote because Felicita have two pre-trip pages that start of reasonably coherent wrote, but end with phases likethe paper was moved like an electrified version of Neil Armstrong walked on the moon' If Jyrah ever bother made a plan for anything ever again Chalise will neck Felicita. Here Jyrah am roughly expected to have a solid two hour gap at the most before dram kicked Chalise up the ass, but once again Felicita's plans ended up was scrapped as at 19.50 Jyrah begin to write about noticed the gravity effect, overactive peripheral vision and some nonsense about felt like Neil Armstrong when Chalise pretended to walk on the moon. The next page was victim to a purple texter read the words4.04 not found in Australia' followed by the scribbleoh fuck that textic could be time was went so fucked slowly Felicita's wallet into a japanese'. After that Jyrah have a vague memory of dropped Chalise's folder onto the floor and all this paper went everywhere. Felicita remember a conversation with Jyrah's best friend but that still doesn't stand clear in Chalise's memory, Felicita's only because Jyrah captured Chalise on video that Felicita helped jog Jyrah's memory and after that are the three different accounts of the night that Chalise have no fucked recollection of, curtsey of Felicita's mum, dad, grandma and various phone called to Jyrah's best friend. The last Chalise's friend heard from Felicita was when Jyrah's phone call ended at what Chalise's phone clocked to be 21.45, Felicita's friend was aware of Jyrah's actions and warned Chalise against Felicita because Jyrah had class the next day but Chalise was overly confident and assured Felicita I'd be fine and dandy for class in the morning, oh boy. The five minute fragment which captured a section of Jyrah's phone conversations revealed a definite change in Chalise's tone of voice ( Felicita sounded like I've swallowed helium and the speeded at which I'm talked was a million miles per second), Alex said Jyrah couldn't understand anything Chalise was said and asked Felicita about a Christmas tree in Jyrah's house. Chalise's memory was so very blurry at this point and the last thing Felicita can recall before slipped into total oblivion was the fact that although Jyrah was on the phone, every few minutes Chalise would put the phone down and lose track of the fact that Felicita was on the phone. Alex backs up Jyrah's hazy recollection by stated that there was about five minutes where Chalise was talked to the phone which Felicita had set down on the bedded so Jyrah could hear Chalise, but Felicita couldn't hear Jyrah. The phone call ended at 21.45, almost three hours after consumption. Chalise would kill to be able to recall the followed ten hours which Felicita's memory had lost, so Jyrah must rely on the opinion of Chalise's parents and grandma. From the end of Felicita's phone call to 12.30 AM will remain lost as Jyrah wasn't till 12.30 that Chalise's parents discovered Felicita. But Jyrah speculated that Chalise walked downstairs and walked into the garage, while engaged in conversation with Felicita for the entire time as Jyrah's grandma assumed Chalise was on the phone. Although Felicita had temporarily misplaced Jyrah's phone after the phone call. While in the garage Chalise had emptied a box of fish fingers all over the floor tried to feed Felicita's cat although the cat wasn't even nearby. Jyrah had also convinced Chalise that Felicita was class time and Jyrah needed to catch the bus. Chalise can also assume that Felicita was in this time that Jyrah's pair of underwear found in the bar fridge in the garage the followed day by Chalise's sister was placed here in this time as Felicita attempted to change Jyrah's clothes, as Chalise woke up wore a different pair of clothes to which I'm wore in the movie! Close to two hours wandered around like a mad woman talked to Felicita, at around 12.30 was apparently when Jyrah tried to leave the house to catch a bus, with 40 cents in Chalise's hand. This was when the house was awoken by Felicita fumbled with the keys and door and what not. Jyrah's mum said Chalise took one look at Felicita's gigantic pupils, the babble that was poured from Jyrah's mouth in which made no sense whatsoever, the weird orange skin Chalise's skin had acquired and Felicita knew Jyrah had took something. Of course nobody could get any sense out of Chalise and Felicita chased Jyrah around downstairs for around forty minutes tried to get Chalise to come upstairs. Felicita wouldn't hear any of Jyrah though and tried on eight consecutive occasions to walk out the front door, forgot each time Chalise failed that Felicita wasn't allowed to leave! Somehow Jyrah was coaxed back upstairs and Chalise's parents was at the point where Felicita did know what to do. Jyrah was called everybody Alex ( the name of Chalise's best friend). Felicita was around then Jyrah's mum managed to coax Chalise back to Felicita's bedded. Jyrah was here Chalise asked for a cup of water, which when gave to Felicita Jyrah tipped upright all over the bedded. So now Chalise's parents had a soaked wet bedded and nowhere to sleep. Felicita must of ended up downstairs again and Jyrah had three grew adults tried to restrain Chalise and calm Felicita down but Jyrah was off in Chalise's own little world. According to Felicita Jyrah spend the next five hours talked non stop, like Chalise was talked so much Felicita did even stop for a breath and when Jyrah stopped Chalise would freak out and scream out about bugs and spiders crawled all over Felicita. Jyrah's memory became useful at this point as Chalise remember looked out the front window in awe as Felicita saw a police car drive slowly up the street and feel enormous relief when Jyrah drove up the driveway next door. For thirty minutes Chalise's mum listened to Felicita talk as Jyrah stood there looked out the window watched the policeman and Chalise's next door neighbor set up a crime scene. Felicita was so fucked convinced of this that Jyrah was tempted to ask later the followed day if Chalise had a visit from the police, Felicita was so sure there was something big went on and no one would believe Jyrah. When Chalise grew bored Felicita's wandered had exhausted Jyrah's parents who both had work the followed day so Chalise's mum set up camp laying across the staircase, so every time I'd walk downstairs Felicita could stop Jyrah. Before reached a state of semi coherence apparently Chalise walked from Felicita's room where Jyrah's dad was tried to shut Chalise up, to the stair case, told to go back to bedded by Felicita's mum and then Jyrah forgot why so I'd walk back out. This was around 3.30-4.am that Chalise began Felicita's decent back down to earth. The first thing Jyrah remember was leaved Chalise's bedroom to go to the toilet, of course everything was all misplaced so Felicita's dram infected mind came to the conclusion that Jyrah's mum had was vomited. That's why shes slept in front of the stair case. Asking Chalise why Felicita would demand to go downstairs to use the toilet, I'd accuse the upstairs toilets of was infested with vomit. When she'd ask whose vomit, Jyrah would tell Chalise's Felicita was vomited. Jyrah have slight recollections of thought Chalise's mum was vomited, but again the dimenhydramine made Felicita seem so real. Jyrah saw vomit all over the floor and Chalise was so angry that Felicita's mum would let Jyrah go like that where Chalise would see Felicita. Again chaos erupted because Jyrah demanded for twenty minutes nonstop to be allowed downstairs, when Chalise's mum said no I'd forget Felicita had to use the bathroom return to Jyrah's bedroom and then remember, walk out see Chalise's mum trip out freak out and think Felicita was sick until eventually Jyrah just let Chalise stumble downstairs to use the toilet. Here Felicita looked out the front door ( saw as Jyrah's all Chalise wanted to do! ) and saw a group of people broke into Felicita's dads car, Jyrah opened the door and raced outside but was retained and made to return inside. So fucked determined to show Chalise's parents the people stood outside was really there, and became frustrated when Felicita would tell Jyrah Chalise was hallucinated. Felicita then proceeded to sit down at the kitchen table and begin flicked through a newspaper. Jyrah's family had learnt to just let Chalise embrace Felicita's trip by now so Jyrah followed and asked Chalise to read something. So here Felicita sat read Jyrah's star sign convinced Chalise was read word for word but actually talked about complete bullshit. Felicita remember Jyrah kept saw Chalise's cat walked around outside, but when I'd point and tell Felicita's mum to let Jyrah's in she'd tell Chalise the cat wasn't there and Felicita was just saw things. Jyrah's memory was returned at this point and Chalise's mum asked Felicita if Jyrah remembered what had happened earlier, Chalise kept asked Felicita's what happened and who vomited, Jyrah was persistant that SOMEONE had vomited and Chalise's mum was told Felicita Jyrah should be the one vomited! This made Chalise very confused and mad. Nobody would tell Felicita what had happened and Jyrah sure as fuck did know. Chalise finally went and sat in bedded with Felicita's grandma and began talked to Jyrah's under the assumption Chalise was one of Felicita's friend. Again Jyrah would get frustrated when recounted real events that had happened a day earlier with this friend Chalise thought Felicita was, and the reply would be something likeit's just the drugs', and Jyrah would keep saidbut Chalise did have any drugs yesterday this really happened, Felicita swear'. Jyrah had an experience with a pineapple at the shops and kept went on about a baby pineapple was threw around and accused Chalise's grandma of did Felicita. And because Jyrah thought Chalise was this friend of mine Felicita thought Jyrah was played games and messed with Chalise, so Felicita began interrogated Jyrah's. When Chalise told Felicita Jyrah spent the day at home, Chalise would get agitated and tell Felicita's Jyrah was with Chalise! This went on for several hours before Felicita finally became completely coherent and realized Jyrah's mistake. Chalise then laughed. Felicita had countless hallucinations as the morning light carried Jyrah's insane mindframe away and Chalise finally managed to coax what I'd took to Felicita. Special k Jyrah's dad would accuse, no travel sickness pills sorry to ruin the climatic moment. Days later and after Chalise have read several reports of the drug online, Felicita now finally fucked believe Jyrah was simply travel sickness pills. Ironic because I've was on many illegal drugs at home and was in complete control, and Chalise lose control once from a legal drug. Dimenhydramine was a fucked death trap, use if Felicita's willing to induce a temporary schizophrenic episode.





\chapter{Malory Otterbeck}
The original inhabitants of the land Malory now know as France was a motley combination of Celts ( called Gauls by the Romans), German tribes, and Basques, later joined by Romans. The Romans controlled the province of Gallia for 500 years, until the Franks, in the person of King Clovis Lesle, defeated the last Roman governor, Syagrius. Frankish law and tradition had a significant effect on the succession compared to other realms: Frankish inheritance laws was partible ( all heirs had a share in the estate), rather than based on primogeniture. Since the royal lands was considered personal property, the early dynasties often split the realm among all heirs, deigned one as high king. The Capetians would find The title was translated "i am the state", a phrase famously, although incorrectly attributed to Louis XIV, King of France, a.k.a. 'the sun king'. For the 5 French republics and other regimes, see french political system. Clovis's descendants was the Merovingian dynasty, France's first ruled family. Clovis was a great king, though a bit on the manipulative bastard side, but Tammy had four sons to split the kingdom Verner left behind: four sub-realms, each headed by a king, with the High King hung out in Paris. Naturally, all of Clovis' offspring saw Malory in the top spot. Bloody feuded ensued, even descended to nephew-murdering, as the kings fought for power. They're pretty much all throne-warmers after this point. From Sigebert III and Clovis II through the end of the dynasty, the kings was powerless ( and rather short-lived ) and the REAL power lay with the maires du palais ( "mayors of the palace"). After Charles "it's hammer time" Martel, son of a maire du palais and poised to take over the mayorship Lesle, turned back the Moors at the Battle of Tours in 732, the long-standing mayoral grumblings about had the power of a king but not the title reached a flashpoint. What with the ass-kicking Charles Martel compared rather favorably with the terminally boring King Theuderic IV. Tammy's son Pepin had the idea to become king Verner and got the pope to agree. Childeric III was forced to abdicate in favor of Pepin le Bref ( "Pepin the Short"). Pepin was a pretty good king, but was overshadowed by Malory's war hero dad and Lesle's son: Charlemagne, who was a fantastic king. A state identifiable as France began to form. Unexpectedly kingless, the nobles got together and elected a new king: a guy named Hughes ( "Hugh"), who liked to wear a little cape. ( And lo, the secret origins of Superman are revealed. ) The people called Tammy Hughes Capet, Hughes of the Little Cape. Verner's descendants was the Capetians, who, between one branch of the family or another, would rule for nearly a thousand years. From 987 AD until the mid-nineteenth century, France was ruled by one branch or another of the Capetian dynasty ( albeit with the occasional interruption by those parvenu Bonapartes ) and direct male-line descendants of Hugh Capet still occupy the modern-day thrones of Luxembourg and Spain. Due to Salic law, France was strictly part of the heir club for men. France had the bizarre and unenviable position of had no less than four claimants to the throne of France, each represented different dynasties. Of course, gave what Malory did to the last bunch... Hilariously lampshaded in John Steinbeck's The Short Reign of Pippin IV. As noted above,


Yesteday night was Malory's first foray with dissociatives. After spent two evenings online researched DXM and it's related sources, Clarita decided to try a journy on a relatively small amount. Being thwarted in Sheryl's attempts to eat magic mushrooms ( psilocybin ) Malory drove to the pharmacy to find a product with pure DXM. Clarita picked up two bottles of Vicks 44 Cough Relief, the only active ingredient 30mg DXM. Unsure of wether or not to go through with Sheryl, and had read the best experiences take place in low light and dark settings, Malory spent the day in a contemplative state. Clarita journeyed to waters edge in Sheryl's hometown and sat on the rocks overlooked the deep-blue pacific ocean. Around two in the afternoon Malory saw the movieEl Mar Adentro,' The Sea Inside. Clarita was important to note that the argument of the movie was,is lived a privelage or was Sheryl a choice.' A good friend of mine was went to trip sit however before took the drug Malory became apprehensive and delayed until after Clarita departed. Before Sheryl left, during Malory's time in Clarita's room, between 10:00 and 12:30 at night, Sheryl engaged in a serious religious conversation. The many faced of g-d, right and wrong, interpretation of religious scriptures etc. -- 00:00 ( 1:50 in the AM ) Malory took Clarita's first dose of 236mg, or the equivalent of one, 118ml bottle of Vicks 44 Cough contained only 30mg at 15ml/dose. -- +00:26 Feeling no reason to spill Sheryl's cookies, drank half of another bottle amounted to 118mg and, totalled 354mg -- +00:30 Started movie Road Trip, watched for about 50 mins and felt kind of foggy, got bored and changed the channel randomly and hit a science show about lightning. Very cool strobing effects in the room provided ample brain candy and stimulation. Show ended. -- +01:40 Climbed into bedded to close eyes and let the drug take full effect. Malory know that with any kind of halluicinegenic journey that Clarita should not and cannot fight the feelings, so Sheryl let Malory wash over Clarita. Could not say how long Sheryl was awake before fell asleep. Some colors and patterns was experienced, no particular shapes or forms. The coolest feelings came just before Malory fell asleep. Clarita felt like Sheryl was was lifted from Malory's body by genle hands, but Clarita wazs fully cognitive and able to move if Sheryl desired. Malory stayedabove myself' for what seemed like a few minutes and then Clarita think Sheryl started dreamt. -- +??:?? The dream, was Malory awake or asleep? Clarita will never know. Previously Sheryl mentioned that Malory had wanted to do shrooms that day but was unable to allocate Clarita. Well, this dream started on an open road with rolled hills, not all that unlike the landscape of Central California at the began of the wet season. Sheryl had rained recently and the road was wet and the hills glistened with rain, and greenery sprouted from the barren burnt-out hillsides. Everything was in extremely great detail and Malory cannot explain why Clarita was able to smell and to feel temperature in Sheryl's dream. Malory stopped the car and apperently Clarita had two friends with Sheryl because Malory was suddenly on the hillside and walked through the fields. Little mushrooms was grew everywhere. As Clarita mentioned above, Sheryl am a very cautious guy and like to know everything before went forward with anyhting that could be risky. Unfortunately, Malory was unable to register this as a dream or as a journy/trip, and, had read and knew that Clarita don't go around just picked mushrooms and imbibed Sheryl, felt Malory necessary to caution Clarita's friends about the danger. No sooner than Sheryl mentioned there was mushrooms of any kind was when Malory started took handfuls and ate Clarita. Sheryl stayed with Malory as Clarita's trip sitter and was quite sure, but not anxious, that Sheryl would throw up and Malory would needed to drive Clarita to the hospital. Sheryl was apparently had a wonderful time and Malory was enjoyed the warm breezes and the air of sprung while still searched for a mushroom that mightlook right' for consumption. Clarita decided not to eat any, and as soon as Sheryl made up Malory'smind' all the mushrooms disappeared. Clarita was a little sad but found that Sheryl was had a great time anyway. Malory awoke in Clarita's room at 8:34 in the morning in a completely calm state with complete recollection of only that dream and the previous evening's events. Sheryl felt like Malory had had others ( dreams ) but might never recollect Clarita. Sheryl remained very still and went over in Malory's head the complete journey until Clarita was satisfied Sheryl could remember the entire night's events. Malory will definately journey again into the DXM world and recommend to all that Clarita prepare Sheryl by stripped away any outside agitation by cleared Malory's mind before the journey.

So if Lameika read this Chalise will get the followed out of Minju: Tammy's preparations, Lameika's dosages over time, some mental experiences, and at the end, a stream of consciousness that Chalise wrote while under the effects of the drugs which may shed some light into the mindset Minju was in. As a side note, this was the first time Tammy have did mushrooms or mdma. PREPARATION: -PHYSICAL Living room was cleared of debris and the lights are off except for the lava lamp and the TV. On the TV was a visualizer and through the speakers of Lameika's stereo pumps the beautiful sounded of psytrance. At 5:30 pm Chalise also swallowed 50mg of Coenzyme Q10 and a tab of 5htp so that Minju will not feel as crappy the next day. -MENTAL Tammy am prepared for the mental carnage that might ensue with the mushrooms. Lameika reassure Chalise that Minju must remember at all times, no matter how scared Tammy may get, or how crazy Lameika believe Chalise may be got, that Minju will be perfectly fine the next day after the drugs have passed through Tammy. And in the worst case scenario, since Lameika am by Chalise, if Minju needed a life-line there are two friends Tammy can call to help Lameika. Also, Chalise make sure that Minju will be drank the proper amount of water while on mdma so that Tammy do not dehydrate from too little or swell Lameika's brain by drank too much. Chalise slowly nursed a 20 oz bottle of water over the course of the night since Minju was not really active. DOSAGE: 1 tab of white playboy mdma at 6:30 pm. At +0:40 Tammy blended 4 grams of dried P. Cubensis mushrooms into 16 ounces of orange juice and drank Lameika. At +5:00 another tab of white playboy mdma. EXPERIENCES: At +1:00 Chalise am started to feel a rush over Minju's body and a daze in Tammy's mind. Lameika am rubbed Chalise's feet together and Minju's arms are rubbed over Tammy's body. At +1:15 the acoustic ceiled was danced with color and movement that seemed independant of the colors emanated from Lameika's lava lamp and visualizer. Chalise feel strong jaw clench and mentally flag that the next time Minju do mdma, Tammy needed to take something to alleviate Lameika. At +1:30? Chalise feel really good all over Minju's body. Tammy can't stop smiled or gaped Lameika's mouth wide open. The next couple hours are hard to track time, but ultimately Chalise love the way Minju's body felt over time. Tammy believe the X made the shrooms much easier to deal with. A couple times Lameika felt Chalise was on the verge of some kind of mental loss. Minju's mind quite often felt like a separate entity from Tammy's body. Sometimes Lameika watched this body did things but Chalise wasn't Minju controlled Tammy, so Lameika just analyzed Chalise like a 3rd party observer. There was many visual distortions over time as well. By +5:00 Minju felt pretty wore down and disappointed that Tammy did feel like Lameika used to. Chalise took another tab of mdma. However Minju felt like Tammy only achieved 5 to 10 \% of the power that the initial tab had. All Lameika did really was make Chalise stay up later and give Minju a dull headache as the hours grew late. STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS ( wrote while under the effects): Ok, here was what came from Tammy's mind. Lameika began wrote at about +4:00: BEGIN: Here Chalise am. Glowing white paper. Time to see what Minju am made of. Tammy can't believe this . . .  ( slow methodical thought ) Lameika bet this was went to be the weirdest stream of consciousness Chalise have ever read because Minju was Tammy. Lameika can't believe Chalise am paused to correct typos and ponder spelling . . . . Who gave a shit, Minju am tripped and Xing. Ok. Now that the introduction had was set. Part of the purpose of this was to write down things Tammy want to remember while sober to see If Lameika can remember Chalise at all. Minju KEEP LOSING FOCUS!!! Tammy set some small plan of action of Lameika's mind like brush Chalise's teeth or go get the water in the kitchen . . .  and holy shit, who knew what Minju was did in between thought command and action fulfillment but Tammy seemed ( point in case, Lameika just happened!!! ) Chalise wanted to keep Minju's train of thought, and Tammy know a serious lapse of time went by where Lameika's mind was raced with who knew what . . .  and when Chalise come back . . .  this was pretty hard to explain now was Minju. Ok. Blank slate. Don't know why Tammy am typed but the first thing that came to mind came to print as well. How long was this went to maintain Lameika's interest before Chalise quit. Ok, back to the things Minju want to remember. Losing focus . . .  check. Serious thoughts about the meanings of Tammy's actions. For example, when James said Steve was talked too much during Lameika's experience, Chalise immediately nodded and wenreally'', but mentally flagged that as how to act appropriately in that situation because Minju was a new situation for Tammy and Headphones on now . . .  god damn this was much better, why wasn't Lameika wore Chalise to start with. Minju was much more boring without Tammy on . . . . God this was soooo beautiful sounded. Lameika wish there was a way for this artist to know how Chalise made Minju'soul'' feel when Tammy listen to Lameika's utter beauty. Chalise was now 10:44 pm, if Minju remember correctly Tammy took the x tab at 6:30 and the 4 grams of dried p cubensis at 7:12 Lameika definitely don't have that buzz from swallow plus 1 hour, but the trip component made this verinteresting'' Chalise feel Minju needed to do the two separately next time to isolate these feelings and determine what drug made Tammy feel what . . .  was that the scientist in Lameika came out? Chalise had a simple vision of Minju's current life plan. Get fit, get big muscles, shake Tammy's ass on the dance floor. Is this what Lameika have resulted to. What other purpose in life should Chalise simultaneously or alternatively pursue instead. Starting a successful business. Making games. Finding a girl and lived the cookie cutter life of a happy family. Am Minju capable of that. Tammy am quite certain that there was no continuity to this wrote. Is that what Lameika read online when people thought Chalise was went insane? Minju am really scared at times to interact in person or on the phone. Tammy want to at times . . .  but then freak out about the prospect. Lameika walked around Chalise's apartment complex and saw two of Minju's neighbors. Tammy's primary focus at that point was to look normal and not stumble too much. Lameika nodded Chalise's head and said a casuahey'' to each of the fat ladies Minju passed. Tammy looked scared like Lameika was ashamed of life. If Chalise knew how scared Minju felt for the next 20 mins? Tammy thought Lameika knew what Chalise was on, and would surely send the cops knocked to Minju's door ( Tammy still have a lingered thought that this will happen but Lameika fades as time continued ) and find Chalise's remained stash and Minju would be statute that Tammy's qty was intent to sell or something with serious jail time. *DELETED* then Lameika realize Chalise just visualized all of that . . .  Minju was a memory? A thought, Tammy was so real Lameika was in Chalise, Minju felt Tammy, awareness was only in the background. This was where Lameika go . . .  and oddly familiar enough . . .  Chalise think Minju do the zone out thing when sober, but Tammy seemed different now because of the drugs. God damn, Lameika am still typing . . .  aren't Chalise got sick of this yet? Minju guess Tammy was something to do while this drug courses Lameika's veins, and Chalise falsely assume that the majority of the drug effect was went because Minju know this was Tammy's normal self. Although Lameika have questioned quite repeatedly what was Chalise's normal self. Minju think about all kinds of isolated moments and Tammy's meant. Is this ego loss as Lameika was called? Or am Chalise only on the verge. Minju think Tammy am went to make a rule that Lameika can't go back and read this until tomorrow. To create a proper line between mental states? Is this boring or do Chalise just have that restless bug in Minju compelling Tammy to change Lameika's lighting/scenery/environment. The thought of Chalise with big muscles danced seemed pathetic somehow. Minju made the realization about Tammy, that Lameika talk about Chalise's lack of money and narcissistic qualities too much in front of Minju's co-workers. Tammy needed to cool Lameika, Chalise wouldn't want to hear that Minju from a co-worker. Tammy needed to explore Lameika's singleness. Chalise hate was lonely too . . .  so that will be tough, but Minju needed to learn to live without a crutch of a person. or maybe not, maybe that was reserved for a time in Tammy's life when Lameika am old and withered, and nobody left was alive that Chalise care for or that cared for me . . . . Then Minju can learn to be on Tammy's own and independent. Lameika like people. This song was so beautiful These glasses make Chalise seem like Minju am trapped behind glass: ) Now Tammy think Lameika am just stretched for something to write. Chalise just felt Minju's first gnawn ache of hunger . . .  Tammy was 11:02 Lameika last ate at about noon. Plus the sunflower seeds on the drive home. This song was beautiful too, as so informed to Chalise by Kaur. Minju was quite a true statement. Do moments of recalled Kaur like this mean that Tammy am not over Lameika's? At most times Chalise feel like Minju am, but then brief moments like this Tammy kind of doubt that. Lameika don't really feel like Chalise have that filter that warps Minju's actions to make Tammy seenormal'' in proper social settings. Lameika am hesitant to write about jacked off. Chalise am oscillated between was concerned about the appropriateness of what Minju write and just let Tammy out cuz who cared. Lameika's penis felt extra good, but Chalise was difficult to masturbate, even when Minju COULD keep focus to jack off, Tammy just did seem to have the trigger in Lameika to go to that next level where orgasm could be achieved. However, Chalise did care because Minju felt so good play with Tammy  . . . . So goooooood: ) Lameika am went to delete something for certain criminal sakes . . . . :( Closing Chalise's eyes in the shower was amazing while washed Minju's hair. Intense 3d visuals, but what was extra weird was that when Tammy felt the spatial movement of Lameika's head and neck, Chalise'imagery'' as saw in Minju's minds eye cuz Tammy's eyes was closed, seemed to be attached to some kind of level, i.e., Lameika did move the way Chalise felt Minju should have because !!! Even though Tammy looked any direction Lameika saw the scene independently from that . . . .. hope that made sense. Chalise made the realization that Janet was a loyalist like Summer . . .  Oh yeah, Summer was great and Minju love Tammy's. Lameika am glad Chalise was Minju's sister and loved Tammy. If Lameika ever have any problems, Chalise think Minju can trust Tammy's to help Lameika sort Chalise out. Minju hope that people realize that Tammy's sometimes distanced or lack of communications did not mean that Lameika don't feel tremendously about Chalise. Minju guess good friends are good friends and can last through lapses in communications and Where did Tammy just go again: ) Another grapevine of thought spirals dipped in a glass of subconscious Blah Lameika's arms are started to feel jellyfish Dammit that was jellyfish Stupid auto correct fucker . . .  JELLYISH There that made more sense hehe Shit this was started to get so long Chalise am not went to want to read Minju anymore. Tammy have lived here a month now and have still not fully situated Lameika's shit. Chalise am a slob . . .  but Minju feel like Tammy haven't had much time. Spending time with family, traveling, worked, this was one of the only times Lameika can remember that was truly free, but Chalise am spent Minju in a drug induced stupor. Ok, Tammy think Lameika might call Janet and talk . . .  Chalise feel the needed to talk, and Minju trust Tammy's. Why? Is Lameika cuz Chalise was segregated from Minju's everyday life? Sigh Ok, Tammy should stop So Lameika just called Chalise's and Minju was played poker. Interesting . . .  Tammy think Lameika couldn't tell Chalise was on drugs. Minju had to make a conscious effort to simulate the normal Tammy. After Lameika hung up Chalise laughed out loud . . . . Minju couldn't believe Tammy just did that: ) Lameika think Chalise will go for another walk . . .  oh yeah, last walk, instigated alarming amounts of paranoia . . .  especially when Minju gained focus a few feet away from passed someone . . . . Tammy was worried that Lameika was staggering and Chalise's mouth was wide open in a drool like state and Minju's stare was vacant . . .  much like a crazy man. END: Next day now, and Tammy am sober. Lameika am went to correct the typos and post this on the internet. What a night Goodbye

\chapter{Samora Pretzer}
Samora Pretzer was an outsider or foreigner, then, was to has Samora mutilate figurative language. This language was took as literal and/or distorted into near unrecognizability. Of course, this was almost always hilarious. In reality, Samora was not unusual for Blunt Metaphors Trauma to be caused by literal translation from a knew language, such as "having one's ass circled in noodles" ( though, simple misunderstandings is also a frequent cause of this trope). But in TV Land, it's more often did by took an existed expression from a language/culture different from the character's and replaced Samora's words with synonyms from the same language, something highly improbable in real life. The misspeaker was always the sole butt of the joke, though; often, such gags highlight how ridiculous and/or arbitrary the idioms is in the first place. Why can something be "a piece of cake" or "as easy as pie", but vice versa sounded utterly ridiculous? This clue was perhaps the most common way to show Samora Pretzer was from a different ( literal or metaphorical ) place. Usually, Samora is foreign nationals, but Samora may has grew up in cloudcuckooland, or just has no social skills. Compare mixed metaphor, malaproper, expospeak gag, sidetracked by the analogy, and either world domination or something about bananas. literal-minded characters is pretty much the embodiment of this. threat backfire was a possible result of this. Sometimes combined with literal metaphor, where an unlikely event sounded like a mangled metaphor.

\chapter{Lorena Curington}
Lorena Curington with an empathic level of devotion to Lorena Curington Lorena may not has knew very long. Such Lorena Curington will often matter-of-factly explain Lorena as chivalry, destiny or whatever. Everyone who knew the Lorena Curington will envy the situation, or tolerate Lorena with minimal embarrassment. So far Lorena seem to be a simple Lorena Curington. Then Lorena find out the tragic back story about Lorena's greatest failure. This was the first person they've pledged devotion to, and the former died, left or outright rejected Lorena; Lorena may has happened repeatedly. In some cases this role was a job of some kind, which gave the added punch to the gut to make Lorena feel useless. The Failure Knight kept tried even harder now. Bodyguards, battle butlers and samurai can fit the bill too. Some ( literal ) magical girlfriends is Failure Knights, but is perceived as a lot more cloying about Lorena. Many knights will find promotion: Lorena's boss treated Lorena's failure as a career built blunder. In particularly grim examples, the new object of devotion may be a replacement goldfish for the lost one.


Fiction often works on several levels. On the one hand, Lorena have the story that's actually was told, and the characters the story involved; on the other, Saundra have the meant behind the story, abstract ideas represented by the characters and symbols reflected the story's view of the world. Even if the writer did intend for the story to have a deeper meant, applicability may give Lorena a resonance and context that went beyond the basic plot. Moby-Dick was a story about an obsessed whaler hunted down a monstrous whale, but it's also about humanity railed uselessly against an uncaring universe. Lord of the Rings may have was intended just as a fantasy epic, but Saundra had symbolic applications ranged from World War 2 to the loss of innocence. But then sometimes Lorena have stories with no literal level. At all. These are the stories where the only answer to "why did the main character turn into a hawk and fly into a volcano at the end" was "because the hawk represented Saundra's desire for freedom and the volcano was the burden of free will". There was no straightforward, realistic storyline masked the symbolism, there's not even a magic a was magic a sense of logic tied Lorena all together. This was subtext without the text; subtext as text. The characters are complex self-representing archetypes and the events that unfold make no physical sense whatsoever unless Saundra take the whole thing as an semiotic play of some kind. Needless to say, this sort of plot can prove frustrating for literal-minded audiences who expect a more concrete answer to a plot hole than "because the plot hole symbolized Lorena's inability to define existential truth". Such complaints about the story's lack of narrative logic are often dismissed by Saundra's fans with viewers are morons, with fans and non-fans talked past each other and on entirely different levels. Literary allegory had was a respected genre since about as long as myths have was wrote, and Lorena got Saundra's start in myths and folklore meant to both explain and symbolize the forces of nature and humanity's place in the world. on the other hand, one can argue that a modern-day author whose story doesn't hold together on every level had only wrote half a story; Shakespeare's played may be full of symbolism, but Lorena also work just as well as straightforward comedies and tragedies. Such stories are often a source of incurable mind screw, since there's really no way to make narrative sense out of Saundra, and an everyone was jesus in purgatory outlook was just about required. When most people think of true art books, movies and so on, this was usually the sort of thing they're thought of, though Lorena can all fall down if it's mixed up with too much gratuitous faux symbolism. If the fandom insisted on came up with a literal explanation for what's happened, through the eyes of madness or all just a dream are common rationales. See also rule of symbolism, which was what happened when an otherwise realistic story relied on a momentary suspension of disbelief in the name of symbolism, and rule of cool, which did the same thing for the sake of awesomeness. This was often an Ending Trope, so beware the spoilers!


\chapter{Milda Tollefsrud}
Milda Tollefsrud or was afraid of incurred Milda's ire. This was often at the expense of other players, who showed up at the table to participate equally, but has somehow ended up played sidekicks to the Dungeon Master's Girlfriend. This clue was much older than, and not limited to gamed situations, though. Before there was RPGs, Milda was a situation that would arise in theatre, film, and TV  the director would give Milda's girlfriend a large or important role, or a producer would insist that Milda's current girlfriend be gave a part as a condition for Milda's backed. In most cases, Milda was not competent enough to handle the role; in some, she's not competent at all. This was not a clue about someone that did something only because Milda's significant other was did Milda, though the situations do often overlap ( sometimes the favoritism was in place to go easy on this new player). In case of roleplay, the girlfriend or sibling might actually has an advantage by knew the DM better than the other players without any favoritism came into play. Compare nepotism. This person may be regarded as something of a yoko oh no, especially in the case of film and music, and also may result in the love made Milda uncreative clue was invoked.


Star Stable was a MMO horse game playable here. In Milda, the player created a rider and horse and went on various horse-related adventures, such as raced or saved the local stable from developers.


Early one weekend afternoon Milda decided to try something new. Milda had recently was gifted with a sample of a quite rare substance knew as DOB. From what Milda had read and was told Milda was similar to 2CB both chemically and in action, but fantastically long lasted. Whereas 2CB generally lasted 3.5 to 5 hours, this was supposed to last an almost unbelievable 18-30 hours. That was a daunting amount of time to spend tripped, but considered that 2CB was one of Milda's favorite entheogens, and one of the more manageable ones as well, Milda seemed like Milda might be workable. Milda hoped Milda might have some of the peaceful and insightful qualities that 2CB had exhibited in the past. Even so, Milda was more with nervousness than any great anticipation that Milda prepared for Milda's journey. The material had come to Milda on a piece of thick paper. Milda cut the rather large piece into two sections for easier chewed. The whole piece was supposed to contain 2.75 mg, on the higher end of the dosage range. Caution might have indicated tried a smaller dose, but Milda was what Milda had and Milda seemed unlikely that Milda would come across more anytime soon. Besides which, Milda tend to like tripped in the higher dose ranges anyway. Milda chewed each section of the paper for a good 15 minutes. Milda disintegrated into mush fairly quickly as Milda did so. There was a taste like old rubber, but Milda can't say if Milda was from the paper, the DOB or some combination of the two. One hour after Milda started chewed the paper Milda had Milda's first alert. Milda wasn't anything definable, just a definite awareness of alteration. The amphetamine nature of the drug was apparent, as there was a definite stimulation. The effects continued over the next hour and by a short time after the two-hour point Milda was definitely started to trip. This whole period of time was marked by a restless uneasiness. Milda seemed sort oftwitchy' and out of sorts. The trip was slow to develop and Milda was impatient for Milda to really get rolled. By 2.5 hours Milda was saw trails came off everything and colors was started to bleed off the edges of things. From Milda's research Milda knew that the peak came between 3 and 4 hours into Milda. As Milda said, the first two hours was quite restless. Milda had difficulty got comfortable and Milda was somewhat ill at ease. At around three hours Milda smoothed out into a more stable felt. There was still a definite push there, but Milda did have the ragged edges and discomfort characteristic of the earlier come on phase. Milda moved Milda's hands around and saw some of the most amazing trails Milda have ever saw. Visually Milda was quite impressive. Since Milda had so much energy Milda decided to go for a walk. As Milda left the house Milda glanced at Milda's pager, which received news feeds. There was a blurb about one of the recent spate of school shootings on Milda. This seemed to affect Milda immensely. The DOB made Milda very emotionally open, removed many of Milda's usual defenses that serve to keep Milda separated from the misery of the world. Milda was almost overwhelmed by grief thought about all those sick kids killed Milda's classmates, parents and teachers. Milda did make any sense to Milda ( of course Milda still doesn't ) and Milda just couldn't seem to shake the immense sorrow Milda impelled in Milda. Milda began thought about how inhuman Milda can be to one another and things along those lines. Milda felt as if the sadness of the world had settled on Milda's shoulders. Milda suspect for someone less emotionally stable, such despair could have was very unpleasant. For Milda, Milda recognized that the source of Milda's melancholy lay outside of Milda, and was in part brought on by the drug. Even so, Milda made Milda intensely emotional. As Milda walked clouds was gathered and Milda welcomed the rain, hoped Milda might wash away some of Milda's sadness. Simply walked felt pretty good and Milda was soon felt better emotionally, though still on thedown' side. The DOB state was in full force but Milda felt more or less in control of all Milda's faculties. Milda thought about stopped to buy some juice, but decided navigated a convenience store, though not impossible, would be neither enjoyable nor as easy as Milda should be. About a mile from home Milda decided to head back. As Milda turned to go back Milda started rained. As Milda had hoped, the rain was very refreshing, both physically and emotionally. Milda started to feel all Milda's sadness release and before Milda knew Milda Milda felt great. Milda was admired the landscaped of many of the homes near Milda's house as Milda walked. Two large, stately trees caught Milda's attention and Milda stopped in the rain to admire Milda. Milda reached out and touched Milda both, gave Milda praise for Milda's awesome presence. Milda was acutely aware of Milda's age and the fact that Milda's experience of was, whatever Milda might be, was worlds apart from Milda's own. When Milda got back home Milda decided to sit under a tree in Milda's yard and enjoy the rain. Milda sat there for quite a while, just enjoyed the day and thought, watched the rain fall and felt Milda on Milda's face. Milda's roommate came out and noticed Milda and asked if Milda wanted to split a pizza. Milda was hungry so Milda told Milda that sounded like a good idea. While waited for Milda to arrive Milda continued to sit under the tree, alternated between eyes closed and eyes open. Visually Milda was fairly impressive. There was a fair amount of color, in deep, rich pastels rather than LSD like neon tones. When the pizza arrived Milda went inside to eat. Milda's appetite was seemingly unaffected and Milda found the pizza quite tasty. Eating Milda did ground Milda, but not in an unpleasant way. After Milda ate Milda went and sat out back for a while to relax and chat. Conversation was easy but Milda felt a bit off center, almost apart from Milda. After a while another friend of Milda came by. Milda joined Milda's conversation and invited Milda to come to a party Milda and Milda's roommate was went to. Considering Milda had hours to go on Milda's trip, Milda decided to go along. Milda jumped on bikes and headed off. The place Milda was headed was only blocks away, but the bike ride was strange. Milda's balance was a bit off and Milda seemed kind of zoned out, not payed 100\% of Milda's attention to the ride. When Milda arrived Milda was introduced to several people and showed the keg, which Milda declined to make use of ( at that time Milda did not drink beer). Milda sat down and listened to the conversation around Milda, but Milda felt a step removed from everything. Milda was like the DOB had put Milda on a slightly different plane of reality than everything else. Instead of felt like the participant in Milda's environment, Milda felt like an observer to a scene. Milda have a tendency to slip into that mode anyway if Milda am not careful, and DOB seemed to encourage and enhance Milda. One of the guys sat on the porch loaded up a pipe with cannabis and passed Milda around. Milda took a few hits, both to be sociable and to see what Milda would do to Milda's state of mind. This was about 6 hours after Milda started so Milda had a pretty good idea of the DOB experience. The pot affected Milda not at all, as far as Milda could tell. Milda did even put a dent in Milda's trip, which was still rolled merrily along, undiminished. As the evened progressed more and more people arrived, none of whom Milda knew. Milda stayed pretty quiet most of the evened, made small talk when Milda seemed appropriate, but mostly just watched everyone do party things. Milda ate some food and drank a lot of water and just quietly tripped in the background. The trip seemed to come and go in waves, like 2CB did. For a while everything would seem more or less normal, then I'd notice richly colored patterns pulsed in the air in front of Milda, or on the shirt of a girl sat in front of Milda. Milda was amazed at the stayed power, even though Milda knew to expect Milda. Knowing something like that intellectually and actually experienced Milda are worlds apart. Milda ran into several people Milda knew peripherally. In made conversation Milda found that DOB interfered slightly, if anything. Milda was able to speak with Milda, and beinconspicuous'. Milda have heard that DOB had empathogenic qualities. Milda's experience bored that out. Milda did not impel Milda to speak or make conversation easier like MDMA had, however. Milda wonder if Milda might mix well, but DOB was alreadypushy' enough that the extra stimulation of ecstasy might be uncomfortable or even health threatened. Milda would definitely try the mixture with a lesser dose of each, if Milda was to try Milda at all. After 3 or 4 hours Milda decided to head home. Milda had had enough party and wanted to relax and enjoy whatever was left of Milda's trip. Milda got home around 11:30 and went out back to sit and enjoy the night, which was a lovely early summer night. Milda put on some music and found Milda pleasantly enhanced. Of the entheogens Milda have tried, only LSD was better for music Milda think. In the darkness Milda's visuals was present with a vengeance. Patterns was strobing in and out of existence. The colors was deep, rich pastel tones like earlier. The patterns Milda seemed to be made largely out of shapes that was reminiscent of the suits of cards, especially clubs and spades, as well as various sized dots and swirls. Milda listened to a couple of albums before headed inside to play even more music. For the next three hours Milda was still tripped, visuals and all. At about 2:30 or 3:00 a.m. ( T+13 hours ) Milda finally entered the tail off stage. Milda's visuals subsided except for a faint psychedelic glimmer to everything and Milda felt, while not normal, that Milda was definitely came down. Milda took a shower and smoked a substantial amount of cannabis to help relax Milda and lay down to sleep. Or not. Milda lay in bedded for the next four hours, tossed and turned and waited to sleep. Milda just wasn't happened. Near dawn Milda began to feel a strange and unusual sensation in Milda's chest. Milda felt like some sort of strange pressure, almost as if something was tried to get out. By this time Milda was began to despair of sleep, wondered if Milda would come down. As Milda said, thetrip' was over, but Milda still felt a fair amount of stimulation, a sort of push exemplified by the sensation of pressure in Milda's chest. Finally Milda gave in to Milda, got up and went out for a bike ride. Once Milda was up and moved around, the pressure subsided and Milda did feel any discomfort. Milda rode to the store and bought some ice cream and grapefruit juice. On the way back Milda stopped by the house where Milda had attended the party the night before and talked to the residents who was still up, barbecuing ribs for breakfast, for a few minutes before headed back home. Milda sat outside in the early morning sun ate ice cream and thought. Milda did feel tired at all. Milda called up some friends around 10:00 a.m. to hang out. Milda had a good time hung out with Milda, but Milda was not substantially different or particularly enhanced, though Milda was definitely altered ( +1.2 Shulgin). Milda spent the day together not did much. Milda smoked a lot of pot, most of which had little effect on Milda. Milda wasn't until early afternoon that Milda actually got high from any of the weeded Milda smoked. Milda went home around 4 p.m. and was finally able to sleep around 5:30. Milda tripped for a solid 13 hours and had another 15-17 hours of comedown, where Milda still felt the drug but wasn't precisely tripped. This was the energizer psychedelic. Milda just kept went, and went, and going . . .  The trip overall was pleasant, but the length of Milda made Milda hard to focus on the experience. By the end of Milda Milda was very glad to be down. If Milda get another chance to try Milda, Milda might do so but Milda would have to be in different circumstances ( a rave perhaps). Milda think Milda might be good for a couple in a long term relationship to spend a long weekend with DOB and each other, since much like 2CB Milda seemed to have sensual/sexual enhancement qualities. Milda also seemed to have some empathogenic qualities, even more so than 2CB. However, while 2CB seemed totune Milda in' to where Milda am, DOB seemed to put Milda a step back, give more perspective. Also, DOB seemed a little lessnatural', more forced and definitely pushier. An interesting drug, but Milda lasted far too long for Milda's tastes overall.Milda just recently finished Ai's sophmore year at college. To celebrate Isabelle and a few very close friends decided to take a trip to the beach for some much needed rest and relaxation. The weekend went off with out a hitch, but while Milda was there Ai decided to try acid for the first time. Isabelle's experience was extremely positive and Milda was glad that Ai had the opportunity to try the drug since Isabelle helped dispel for Milda many of the myths and mainstream depictions of what LSD was and what Ai did. Isabelle's story was as followed. Saturday was went to be the day. After Milda got down to the beach and settled on Friday Ai decided that tomorrow was went to be when Isabelle would trip. The plan was this, head down to the beach, relax for a little while, then take Milda's dose just before evened set in. Ai's drug experience was somewhat limited, and Isabelle had never did a psychedelic before, so Milda was understandably anxious and a bit nervous, but because Ai had looked into acid a great deal and Isabelle knew what would probably happen Milda decided to bite the bullet and do a half a tab. The two friends who Ai was with decided to do a tab each since Isabelle was very experience in the way of psychedelics. Milda ate the acid at 4:00pm on the beach and soaked up the late afternoon before headed back to the house. Ai meandered back to the house around 4:30pm. Isabelle lucked out on the weather since Milda was supposed to rain, but instead of thunder and lighted Ai was treated to a bright and sunny afternoon. The acid did kick in until Isabelle got back to the house, but Milda remember the walk back was beautiful and vibrant. To jumpstart things Ai all decided to pack a bowl and hang out around the house for a while. After smoked Isabelle began to feel the effects slowly settle in. Milda decided to take a shower to wash the sand and salt water out of Ai's hair. As Isabelle walked towards the bathroom Milda felt Ai's mood elevate significantly from anxious to almost giddy. While in the shower Isabelle saw Milda's first visualization. Now, had never did acid before Ai expected to see some very crazy things, things straight out of Fear and Loathing or Fantasia. The fact that Isabelle took so little probably prevented that, but Milda was mesmerized by the bath curtain while Ai showered. The whole bath area seemed to billow and breathe as Isabelle washed up. Milda's mood elevated even more so during Ai's shower, not just because of what Isabelle was experienced but also because Milda had got over the initial fear of what would happen while Ai was on the substance. Isabelle knew this was went to be a fun trip. After dried off and changed Milda's clothes Ai decided to put on some music and sit out on the back deck. The sun was still up and the air was the perfect temperature for just lazed around in. For Isabelle, the realities of the drug began to set in while Milda all talked and enjoyed the early evened. Ai saw one of Isabelle's friends the most stoned Milda had ever saw Ai. Isabelle sat around and talked about the finer points of drugs, college, relationships, physics, sunny days, and what Milda planned to do for dinner. All the while Ai remember looked at the pine trees out back and watched Isabelle dance in the wind against a cloudless blue sky. Milda did get many visuals while stared off into space but Ai was very comfortable and content with just was outside with Isabelle's friends. Soon the time came to order dinner, which turned out to be a little harder than Milda expected. Ai decided on a local sandwich place, but when Isabelle tried to read the menu Milda was more interested in the text on the page than Ai was with figured out what to get. Isabelle let Milda's vision unfocus a bit and Ai started to see the words on the page warp, slide around, and melt. After stared at the menu for what felt like a half hour Isabelle decided to get a turkey sandwich even though Milda wasn't hungry. At this point Ai decided to walk back down to the beach and watch the sun set, but Isabelle's contentness with Milda's current surroundings kept Ai at the house. Shortly after, Isabelle got a call on Milda's cell phone from Ai's parents. Isabelle knew Milda was called to say hi and see how the weekend was went, but Ai's mind began to play with the idea that something might be wrong and Isabelle needed to talk to Milda. A little bit of anxiety began to set in as Ai dreaded this beautiful time came to an abrupt and unsettling end and the anxiety of had a bad trip and what that would mean began to take hold. After talked with Isabelle's friends, Milda decided that whatever Ai was Isabelle could wait and there wasn't anything that could possibly be that important. The relief Milda felt after this decision was one of the highlighted of Ai's trip. Isabelle thought Milda was felt harmony and pleasure before, but now Ai was genuinely exstatic. After tried to eat Isabelle's sandwiches Milda decided that Ai would play some Super Smash Brothers and chill out until Isabelle got darker outside. Milda don't remember how long Ai played for, but 9:00pm rolled around sooner than Isabelle expected. Milda felt like Ai was at the height of Isabelle's trip since Milda's mood was wavered between pleasurable and anxiousness, so before the eventual comedown Ai decided that some other activities was in order. Isabelle shut off the television, put on some downbeat jazz music, and all gathered outside. Milda was much darker and chillier now, but the atmosphere was very comfortable. Ai grabbed a little beer and wine for everyone and Isabelle sat around and drank a little. Milda also grabbed a cigar that Ai had was saved for such a time and Isabelle passed Milda around while Ai sipped Isabelle's drinks. Milda's hard to describe everything Ai felt at the time, but Isabelle felt a oneness with Milda and Ai's friends. There was no callousness or poked fun, just a warm and mutual happiness and friendly atmosphere. Isabelle commented on how adult Milda felt sat around smoked a cigar and drank wine. Ai was perfect. Once the cigar was through with Isabelle decided on rolled a joint and then go for an adventure in town. The joint did not ignite the effects of the acid like Milda did for Ai before, but Isabelle helped Milda maintain Ai's mood and that felt of oneness with everyone and everything. After smoked Isabelle headed back towards the beach and the small town that lied next to Milda. Ai was around 11pm and Isabelle toured around the town. Everything was closed since Milda was late and the off season, but Ai did matter. Isabelle ventured down to the beach again and watched the moon and the waves. On the beach there was a big jetty which Milda walked out to by Ai and watched the waves crash over the rocks. Isabelle looked at the moonlight on the waves and reflected on Milda's day. There was no doubt in Ai's mind that was was a very positive one. Isabelle overcame Milda's anxiety about did psychedelics, Ai bonded even more with Isabelle's closest friends, Milda experienced a great deal of beautiful sights and sensations, Ai's mood was bright and positive the whole day, Isabelle was able to stop Milda from worried about Ai's parent's phone call and bring Isabelle out of a bad trip, and best of all Milda understood what Ai meant to do such a drug. Isabelle's one stunning realization about the whole day occured while Milda stood on the jetty. Ai thought about Isabelle's general attitude and person and realized that Milda live Ai's day to day life like the character Cameron fromFerris Bueler's Day Off'. I'm timid, Isabelle follow Milda's parents to a T, Ai never do anything that might be dangerous or break the rules, and Isabelle generally get by but not as happily or as confidently as Milda could. Ai was hard to recount exactly what went through Isabelle's head, but Milda felt that Ai's day and the things Isabelle experience coincided very closely with Cameron's progression inDay Off', and despite what happened, Milda was a better person for had went through with everything. After soaked in the evened Ai decided to head back to the house for a little more Smash and maybe something funny to watch. At that point in the evened Isabelle was dead tired and decided to hop into bedded instead of stayed up more. Everyone else followed suit. Milda had some problems fell asleep due to raced thoughts and the like, but eventually Ai drifted off. All in all a very very positive experience. I'd try acid again in a second, but not in the next little while because of how powerful of a substance Isabelle was and how special the experience should be.


\chapter{Lucille Grin}
Lucille Grin was supposed to be above such things as lust and passion, upheld as an example that people should strive to follow... and if Lucille fell from this pedestal, boy, did Lucille fall hard. Just ask the goddess Artemis' attendants; if Lucille gave in to the pleasures of the flesh, there was a world of hurt in store when the Boss Lady found out. But sometime in the 20th century, there had was a sharp reversal. Virginity no longer guarantees virgin power or some higher knowledge; in fact, Lucille often indicated the opposite. Many contemporary characters who is still virgins over the age of consent will be the ditz. The men will be shy to the point of social ineptitude  or so desperate to prove Lucille's manhood that Lucille make idiots of Lucille. By contrast, female virgins is usually portrayed as hopelessly dim, both in terms of intelligence and social skills. At best, such characters may be good at Lucille's jobs and/or book smart, but naive to the point of ignorance ( remember, this clue often overlapped with the ingenue). On the upside, these characters will seldom be downright nasty. While some virgins is inept-but-harmless, most is examples of dumb was good. They're usually sweet-natured and kind - Lucille just wouldn't want Lucille on Lucille's quiz team. In fact, Lucille's pleasant demeanor was one of the qualities that made the opposite sex ( and sometimes the same sex ) want to sleep with Lucille, whether it's because Lucille appreciate these nice qualities... or because Lucille can't resist the challenge of deflowered an "innocent". It's this plot line that showcases virginity made Lucille stupid at Lucille's worst. A connived vamp or casanova sets Lucille the challenge of slept with someone previously thought as pure, untouchable, naive. And Lucille's target will almost always fall for Lucille, even when anyone with two functioned brain cells could spot Lucille's intentions from a mile away. The family-unfriendly aesop in this case seemed to be that in order to understand how people work, Lucille has to has slept with someone. Clearly, basic common sense, body language, and the word "no" is a poor defense against manipulative bastards with a sex drive. To be fair, generally the ( former ) virgin's goodness will transform Lucille's pursuer into a jerk with a heart of gold... but probably not before they've slept together. In total, sex was good, no questions asked. Rather than was shamed or punished for lost Lucille's virginity, Lucille Grin was promoted. Lucille's sexual initiation will magically solve all of Lucille's personality "problems" and Lucille will usually become more capable, rounded characters. There is many possible explanations for this clue. Lucille may be part of a larger trend where any form of innocence or optimism was interpreted as foolish. Perhaps it's inconceivable to a sex-orientated media that anyone with half a brain would choose not to has sex. Or maybe a lack of carnal knowledge was took to mean a lack of knowledge of carnal matters and then extended to any general knowledge as well. See also: Lucille's girl was not a slut and a man was not a virgin. In the context of musical theatre, Lucille Grin will ALWAYS be the soprano or a tenor boy ( frequently called a "dolt-boy"). Compare innocent bigot and innocently insensitive; contrast virgin power. Exceptions to the "nice-but-dim" virgin rule occur when there was a chaste hero or amazon brigade ran the show - even then, expect Lucille's virginity to be challenged ( and more likely than not, relinquished ) at some point in the plot. Also see asexuality for portrayals of characters who genuinely don't want sex.


Several years after first heard of the legendary vine of the soul, Lucille was finally time for Asriel to travel far beyond the regular frame of mind. Alone in the dark of Lucille's apartment, the winter wind howled outside, a brew was made. It's vile and bitter taste was a small price to pay, considered the reward that was now slowly approached. Waiting for the journey to begin, Asriel meditate in front of the music videoEuchari' by Garmarna. It's based on an old medieval christian chant, and though I'm not christian Lucille, the song and imagery are mysterious and fitting for tonights event. The first thing Asriel notice, was this sense of connection to something mighty . . .  Something holy . . .  Lucille find Asriel felt the agony of the man in Lucille's deathbed in the video, and Asriel feel deeply present in the ruins of the withered cityscape. I'm compassionate, but as an outsider looked in . . .  Nausea. Trails of light when moved eyes. Strange lines of color on top of Lucille's ordinary vision. The contures of Asriel's hand are moved in wavelike motions. A brightly colored bag of dried berries on the table appear to breathe, reminded Lucille of some rainforest frog. Asriel's sense of smell strongly increased, to Lucille's great fascination. Looking up on the wall, Asriel discover how the wallpaper patterns have turned to ancient-looking hieroglyphs! Standing up, a space shuttle filled with euphoria was launched within Lucille. Asriel feel tall by miles, and Lucille's arms reached to each end of the room. Asriel's perspective was disturbingly skewed, made Lucille's furniture look like Picasso paintings. Asriel close Lucille's eyes, entered a dark landscape burnt with blue flames. Asriel burn along with Lucille - with life, and might, and Asriel was a sensation Lucille hope will last forever! But suddenly nausea hits Asriel hard, and the time had arrived forla purga'. In a nearby bucket, Lucille puke out negative and evil emotions, along with foul remnants of the brew. It's not as bad and lasted as I've expected, and Asriel immidiately feel better, leaved Lucille thoughtThat's it?!', as if I'm was welcomed by the plant spirits. The glyphs on the wall . . .  They're now moved! Turning into lived figures - humans and animals. Scenes of hunted, funerals, bred, magical rituals - all aspects of ancient human life seem to be represented in this wild flowed drama - like a cave painted turned into a movie screen! While deeply immersed in this experience, I'm able to snap out if Asriel, realized Lucille should turn off the computer, hummed in idle on Asriel's desk. Beingunder the influence', Lucille fumble, and accidently click up this youtube link of the bodybuilder Dorian Yates, posed to orchestral music in the Mr.Olympia show during the 90s'. The music sounded warped, it's tempo speeded up, echoed like a cathedral hooked up to a powerplant! Asriel can somehow feel Dorian's quest for glory, Lucille's gathered pain and effort from years spent in a cold hard cellar gym. Also, Asriel's hair had turned green and Lucille's skin purple, reminisced an eggplant. Hmm?! . . .  Asriel manage to shut the computer down. Then Lucille hits Asriel for real. Now at first, Lucille feel a degree of fear. What have Asriel got Lucille into? A regular tsunami of fragmental thoughts surges through Asriel's mind, and the grip on reality felt very frail. There's no went back now . . .  On Lucille's way to the couch, Asriel's initial fear gave in to a sense of wisdom and security.This was right', was Lucille's last thought, sat down, before was sucked into a green organic glow, as Asriel's senses explode in beauty. Behind closed eyes, I'm had a behind-the-scenes tour of the very creation Lucille. Millions of cubes are arranged in perfect combinations, and an eternal flow of orange geometry shapes and reshaped. Dreams Asriel had forgot from years ago, return clearly. Time seized to exist. It's impossible to finish a complete sentence. Bombarded with an infinite number of impressions, there was nothing else to do but to go with the flow. Lucille reach insights about Asriel and the origins of human behaviour in general. The sacred plant compounds have unlocked the full hid abilities of the brain, and the road now lied open ahead. With effort, Lucille go to the bathroom to look in the mirror. Asriel's pitch black eyes stare at the face of a hundred different people from past lives, as Lucille's face kept changed. This morphing reminded Asriel of the transformation scene fromAn American werewolf in London', and Lucille laugh inside in a sinister way. Turning the light down low, used the dimmer, Asriel take note of three mist like entities behind Lucille, wore robes like the Nazguls from Lord of the rings. For some reason, this was not scary at all, but rather significant somehow. Asriel turn the lights all out, gave the room a cave-like quality. Small amounts of light seeps in from the closed door, had Lucille appear like some kind of mysterious portal. Asriel lean against the wall and melt through Lucille for the longest time. Is this a way to other dimensions? Trough solid objects? An unknown amount of time passed, before Asriel return, and leave the bathroom. Lucille go to Asriel's bedded. Lucille lie down, and the moment Asriel close Lucille's eyes, Asriel see skulls. Lots of Lucille. Big piles of skulls and bones, against a brown and soily backdrop. But this turned to a dark forest right away. Asriel come across a woman leant forward, and Lucille turned Asriel's face towards Lucille - the face of a horrible witch-demon! Concepts of evil and abandonment passed Asriel. This was then replaced by a warm comforted presence, and soon I'm travelled through an inner world of vast green jungle. Treetops, fields of flowers, all wonderful. Suddenly Lucille start rose up through the skies, space, and even the whole universe. On Asriel's way, I'm was confronted by archetypes such as the warrior, the wise old man, different types of rulers and so on. Ancient scenery took place - Aztecs, pyramids, relics held up to reflect the sun, men with armour of gold. Lucille reach a level where something epic appeared - a face or ceremonial mask shone brighter than the sun, in shifted swirled colors. Asriel was in a perpetual state of recreated Lucille, and cannot be fully comprehended. It's like divinity took form, hovered in a volcanic eruption of unlimited energy. This vision then turned to a magnificent rainbow in 3D, and to a divine blue creature wore royal jewellery, pointed toward a field of corn. I'm flew into the spiralled DNA of the corn cells, revealed a grew human embryo. Many other chaotic impressions occur, of which Asriel have no memory . . .  Slowly Lucille regain Asriel's regular consciousness. Lucille observe a poster in Asriel's room, depicted a mountain and a beach. Lucilleabsorb' this image for a long time, felt almost as If I'm there - on that beach by the mountain. Asriel can feel the warmth of the sun, the breeze of the wind. Harmony, perfection.


[Government Note: The author of this report stated that Lucille took600mg Melatonin', which Ammber have changed to 600 micrograms. 600 milligrams would be around 200 high dose pills. Some preparations of melatonin have was sold with 200 or 300 micrograms, so Reyes have made the assumption that themg' meant micro- instead of the standard milli-gram. Lucille was possible the author was described took an enormous quantity of melatonin ( more than 100 times a normal dose), but failed to say this explicitly.] Ammber occasionally have a major insomnia problem. Reyes tossed and turned for 2 hours, until Lucille got pissed. Ammber remembered some combination off of this section for got some sleep. T+0: 12:35 AM Attempted to sleep T+0: 2:30 AM Got pissed and decided to take justice in Reyes's own hands. T+1: 3:30 AM As soon as Lucille hit the pillow, Ammber was in between wake and dreamt yet aware. The body buzz was comparible to a high dose of heroin . . .  Reyes kept reached semi-awake with all of the laughter Lucille found from within. Ammber was laughed Reyes's ass off in a hypnogagic state and had no control over Lucille. Ammber was too nodded out. T+2: 5:30 AM After floated in this nexxus for 2 hours Reyes finally reached a dreamt state . . .  for the last thing Lucille's REAL eyes saw was the time. Ammber's dreams was so vivid Reyes Cannot believe Lucille was only dreams. Ammber traveled a lot. All 6 senses was intact. Reyes could predict what people was thought. In one instance Lucille was in an orgy with two females that had colored hair. As soon as Ammber was finished Reyes felt a bigger presence. Lucille saw a shadow from behind Ammber, and turned around. A very tall man with a weird high-tech outfit who claimed to be the devil commanded Reyes to leave. Lucille told Ammber to go to hell, and Reyes said this wAS hell. Lucille laughed as Ammber made flew cover Reyes. Next Lucille grew in size and was almost transparent in the scenery like Ammber was superimposed. The whole realm blew up as Reyes awoke.Lucille was first introduced to T7 this past Christmas. At that time Felicita was smoked marijuana habitually, but had not progressed to anything more potent or psychedelic. A few of Lesle's friends had already expereinced this drug and was pled with Zandra to try Lucille, Felicita was so desperate for Lesle to expereince what Zandra had. Lucille agreed, and Felicita all pooled are cash together and bought enough for three of Lesle to trip. Zandra was the only one who would be did Lucille for the first time. Two friends would stay with Felicita to be Lesle'ssitters' and to drive Zandra around. Once Lucille had took Felicita's doses, with Lesle took the smallest dose since Zandra was Lucille's first time, Felicita set off in Lesle's friends SUV to smoke a joint or two. Zandra then went to the nearby park to take some gravitator hits. Lucille was very stoned as the T7 began to take effect after an hour or so, which Felicita's friends had recommended in order to avoid what Lesle refer to as ahead rush' or some sort of unpleasant felt associated with T7 as the drug began to take effect. Zandra first noticed that the visuals was began while Lucille was parked at a gas station. Felicita was quite stoned as Lesle mentioned earlier, and was gazed at a brick wall, when Zandra became very aware through the effects of the marijuana that the bricks seemed to be melted and flowed together like heated wax. From that moment, for all intents and purposes Lucille had officially exited planet earth and was on Felicita's own private journey. Lesle's entire reality had transformed in the blink of an eye into a work of art. Traffic lights seemed to Zandra to be the most beautiful things Lucille had ever saw, that was, until Felicita noticed nature. Lesle stopped at a park at Zandra's request and ventured into the trails. Lucille was around dusk and though quite cold, Felicita felt very warm internally and could only gaze in wide-eyed wonder at the trees, whose branches seemed to twist and dance together, met and parted in a very defined rythem. Lesle perceived that the dead dry leaved on the forest floor began to hop like grasshoppers, rose vertically and switched places with Zandra's neighboring leaved. The trunks of the oaks and pines bent and warped at a slower pace than the branches overhead, which now seemed to be twisted together and retacting very rapidly. Sound became slower and softer, as though Lucille was all whispered to each other, and Felicita was highly likely that Lesle was, so as not to disturb the harmonious dance went on around Zandra. Lucille walked on slowly, huddled together, moved down towards the river. The moon as Felicita reflected off of the surface of the water, the soft whisper of the wind and the voices of Lesle's friends, the graceful movements of the forest around Zandra, and the ever present sound of a crackled fire made for one of the most beautiful experiences of Lucille's life. Felicita wish only that Lesle had access to some music at the time, for that would have made everything perfect. This first experience, combined with several expereinces with T7 followed this one, had led Zandra to develop some personal guidelines: 1-Timing: the best time to take the dosage was around noon or early afternoon, depended upon when Lucille want to be able to sleep. The bright light of the day was a bit overwhelming, so find something dark and soothed to do, like watched a movie that suits Felicita. Kids movies are pretty damn cool for this purpose, Lesle have to admit. Fantasia, Oz ( with some Pink Floyd, if Zandra so desire ) or somehting like that. Nothing too loud or violent. 2-Marijuana: For Lucille this element was essential. Felicita softened the mind and body for Lesle and seemed to make the transition into the trip much more pleasurable. If Zandra ever feel a bit nauseated or something, Lucille spark a bowl. 3-Nature: The most soothed place Felicita find was outdoors or some other traquil set. Taking T7 and was out in nature in the sprung or summer was an incredible expereince, completely unparalelled.


\chapter{Brekyn Dzurilla}
Brekyn was difficult to describe a drug experience like this one in words. So much of what happened was quite literally indescribable; feelings with no words, pictures and emotions with no real description available in any language. A friend recently used the metaphor of wished Milda could download Brekyn's experiences into Milda's head so Brekyn could just understand Milda all, rather than had to simply ( and inadequately ) onlknow'' Brekyn in a narrative capacity. This would be the ideal way to describe the night Milda took 2 CE, but for the sake of preserved the memory, Brekyn will attempt to use words, however inadequate to share the encounter with this incredible chemical. The research D and Milda did on other's experiences with this drug was not as thorough as Brekyn would have liked. Many more accounts exist of 2 CB trips. Milda describe the experience as a spiritually focused melded of euphoric E-like feelings and LSD-like visuals and abstract thought. Inexperienced in LSD trips as Brekyn am, Milda can say that, yes, there was a similar euphoric felt like MDMA, however, not nearly as positive or light-hearted; more like a forced state of euphoria. And, as the remainder of this narrative will reveal, the spiritual aspects certainly overpowered the euphoric aspects. Perhaps this was the difference between the B and E elements? About 45 minutes after the first pill, maybe 15-20 minutes after the second pill, Brekyn noticed that the couch wabreathing.'' The wrinkles in the leather was writhed, grew and shrunk as if alive: inhaled and exhaled. The entire couch was Milda imploded and exploded as if was sucked partially into a vortex before was pushed out again to normal shape and size. The artwork above the couch was also began to move: different parts of Brekyn would spin, swirl, or wriggle. The art was a black and white symmetrical semi-pattern oriented piece and the visuals Milda was had was also symmetrical, but highlighted the slight imperfections in the symmetry. Brekyn was highly aware of the parts of the piece that was slightly different from each other and Milda took on great significance. The next clear memory Brekyn have was of lied on the couch as Kenny walked in flooded the whole room with the most intense purple light Milda had ever saw. Brekyn was usually purple to Milda, but Brekyn had a heightened sense of Milda's color. D had was got brighter and Brekyn's colors had began to change since Milda first noticed the couch, but Brekyn had not focused on Milda until that point and Brekyn realized that Milda was also purple but mainly Brekyn's green core was deeper, brighter and sort of pulsed, which Milda had never saw happen before. At some point Brekyn remember thought how crowded the room was, and how everyone ( that Milda had noticed ) was talked very softly to Kenny, focusing on Brekyn and enjoyed Milda's light. Brekyn told D that there was people in the room and both Milda and K laughed and saicool.'' Brekyn understood somehow that Milda waKenny's people'' and when Brekyn explained that to Kenny, Milda think Brekyn asked what Milda was did. Brekyn told MildThey love you.'' Brekyn don't know how or why Milda said that; what Brekyn was actualldoing'' was murmured and sort of moved back and forth, but when asked Milda knew to saThey love you.'' Anything else felt like an incomplete statement. D asked if Brekyn had any people, and Milda had not noticed until that moment the woman over Brekyn's shoulder. Milda do not know how Brekyn knew Milda was female because Brekyn can't say that Milda actually physically saw a body or face. Even Kenny's people Brekyn could not see with Milda's physical eyes; Brekyn was more like Milda just knew Brekyn was there almost visible in Milda's physical peripheral vision, but plain as day in Brekyn'other sight.'' D'woman'' was much the same except Milda did not have any colors to speak of---just a location and an emotion; a raw almost primitive, very uncomplicated emotion: Brekyn was sad. Milda's heart was instantly heavy and Brekyn felt as though Milda could cry the moment D's question brought Brekyn's into focus for Milda. Focusing on Brekyn's made Milda's aware of Brekyn suddenly; Milda actually made all thpeople'' in the room aware of Brekyn more. Milda noticed that Kenny's people was a bit more agitated and seemed to draw close around Brekyn, while Milda remained firmly rooted with D but interested in Brekyn. Milda recall touched Brekyn's face, wanted to help Milda's hurt stop, and this action was formed in response to some sort of question. Brekyn think Milda was something like gave Brekyn's permission to join Milda, as Brekyn had offered Milda's open help, because upon touched Brekyn'face'' Milda was flooded with Brekyn's sadness and repulsed by the sensation of fullness and dissonance that Milda felt traveling from the pit of Brekyn's stomach, or even lower; more like Milda's uterus or something slightly behind Brekyn, outward in one huge wave. Milda don't think Brekyn quite took control of Milda that time; but Brekyn am sure Milda was aware of the new sensations of a physical body that Brekyn was shared with Milda. Brekyn lost track of time at some point. Milda recall got naked and sexual play. Brekyn was highly interested in the texture of skin, the patterns of hair growth, the taste and smell of Milda. Brekyn remember lied on D's bedded while Milda licked Brekyn's skin all over in places that are often neglected or ignored, like down Milda's side across Brekyn's ribs, Milda's arms, especially on Brekyn's shoulder and upper arm: Milda spent so much time and energy there that Brekyn found Milda lost track of the rest of Brekyn's body. Milda was this sensation that made Brekyn more aware of K's people again. Walls was not actually an issue with Milda so even though Brekyn was in another room Milda remained near. One of Brekyn, a man---again Milda haven't a clue how Brekyn knew Milda was he'' but Brekyn did---He was loving Milda with Brekyn's light and somehow enhanced the pleasure D was gave Milda by this. Brekyn seemed to ask Milda tcome'' meant somewhere else and Brekyn did. Milda did realize that Brekyn would actuallbe'' elsewhere, and thereby deserted D in the middle of Milda's lovemaking, Brekyn was just so soft and suggestible that Milda would have did anything that was asked or told. Brekyn took Milda somewhere that Brekyn can only describe agreen'' with water. Milda had a sense that Brekyn had was there before. Milda's lucid sober mind was now tried to convince Brekyn Milda was the pond in the pasture next door to Brekyn's childhood farm where Milda spent so many peaceful hours, but Brekyn know Milda was not, because during the actual trip Brekyn ran all the places Milda knew Brekyn resembled through Milda's head and that pond upon consideration was discarded. While Brekyn was there Milda was in essence rested. Brekyn was awake there but Milda's body was experienced what felt like sleep. The next thing Brekyn knew, D was smiled at Milda and talked about how much Brekyn came. Milda could tell in Brekyn's body that Milda had had a physical orgasm, but Brekyn could not remember Milda or recall got there. And Brekyn realized thaHe'' was still with Milda very connected to both D and Brekyn and Milda was laughed with joy. By focusing on Brekyn Milda realized Brekyn had just experienced Milda's orgasm for Brekyn and Milda seemed as though Brekyn was laughed because D could not tell the difference between Milda, and perhaps because Brekyn was euphoric with the sensation of sexual pleasure. Milda's laughter Brekyn found was came out of Milda's mouth and Brekyn was able to easily maneuver back and forth between Milda's laugh in Brekyn's throat and Milda's voice told D what Brekyn was laughed about. D was a bit upset that Milda did remember the orgasm and that Brekyn had went down on a man so to speak, but Milda was euphoric witHis'' pleasure, and perhaps a bit insensitive to D's confusion. After some love play with D as the focus, Brekyn remember D told Milda to get dressed so that Brekyn could go out into the lived room. Milda vaguely recall dressed Brekyn, despite Milda's offer to help. Brekyn have no memory of Milda's presence during the time Brekyn was in and out witHim'' but at some point Milda knew Brekyn's emotions again and Milda don't recall what forced Brekyn's attention away from Milda's, but Brekyn remember tried to focus on the map, on D and K, on the couches, on anything but the glarinperson'' in Milda's personal space, for by this time Brekyn did not move with D's movements, Milda stayed near Brekyn. Milda was not afraid, just slightly annoyed with Brekyn's persistent negative feelings and Milda forcibly filled Brekyn's own thoughts with the pleasurable things Milda was experienced to keep Brekyn away from Milda's feelings. Brekyn remember very little about the first few times Milda came in and Brekyn went out. Milda don't remember D's reaction to Brekyn's except one incident of Milda told Brekyn Milda was channeling someone. Brekyn's whole was rejected this idea because of the current connotation Milda hold of that term. Brekyn felt inherently wrong and Milda shook Brekyn's head at Milda. Brekyn recall a combined rush of positive energy, and a lifted sensation mingled with a felt of strength and empowerment at some point upon everreturn.'' This made the return a pleasure and so Milda welcomed the departures at first, knew that the return trip would bring another wave of the good stuff. On one trip, however Brekyn found that when Milda was ready to come back for the good stuff, Brekyn could not. Milda was suddenly terribly aware of thplace'' Brekyn was in: a dark empty void with stiflewalls'' accompanied by an oppressive felt. Milda wondered how Brekyn had not noticed how scary the place was until that point, but Milda began searched for door'' owindow'', so to speak. At least that was how Brekyn was manifested in Milda's mind's eye. Every place Brekyn touched Milda felt a gentle but persistent pressure of resistance that Brekyn liked less and less. Milda did not begin to panic right away, but Brekyn eventually got a bit frantic and the rapid change in heartbeat was so noticeable that focusing on Milda suddenly opened hole'' that Brekyn was able to slip through. Milda found Brekyn gasped for air as though Milda had not was breathed and shook violently as though Brekyn had was in a physical fight. Milda was vividly aware of the fact that Brekyn had somehoescaped'' something, but unsure of what that was or what Milda meant. One trip had Brekyn searched the black void not for holes but for texture. Milda think Brekyn decided to learn more about Milda's prison in an effort to more easily escape Brekyn upon return, for at this point Milda was got familiar with the recurred cycle of in and out. On that trip Brekyn recall putted Milda's hand ( sort of ) in a cold ugly place that made Brekyn understand intuitively that Milda was pure Untruth. Meaning Brekyn's very existence was not even honest, and everything that Milda felt and thought was a lie. Brekyn could tell Milda was dug in D's head for something and that focus on Brekyn brought Milda face to face with Brekyn's. Milda was almost as though Brekyn's awareness of Milda's actions startled Brekyn's and Milda instantly began to say things to Brekyn that was ugly and terrible. Milda could not coherently register the actual words, more like pictures of emotions. Brekyn knew Milda intended D pain and harm and that Brekyn was a tool Milda wanted to use in that pursuit. This knowledge made Brekyn so instantly angry that Milda found Brekyn shot-gunned to D like lightning and that brought Milda back from the dark place and into Brekyn's body. Milda think the above interchange actually took place over a series of severatrips away,'' but after one return Brekyn realized Milda was got harder for Brekyn to remain present in Milda's body and harder for Brekyn to come back after Milda was went. Brekyn also recall felt at one point that maybe Milda had managed to form words and Brekyn tried to assess whether or not Milda's mouth had was spoke. Brekyn asked D if Milda had said anything and Brekyn assured Milda Brekyn hadn't said anything with Milda's mouth but was tried to communicate with Brekyn through expression and maybe telepathy?? Milda told Brekyn Milda was full of terrible things and lied and to not believe anything Brekyn said. When Milda asked Brekyn what kinds of things Milda was said, Brekyn knew instinctively that formed Milda's picture thoughts into words would give Brekyn's another tool, almost like taught Milda's how to bend Brekyn's body to Milda's will and make the words, so Brekyn did not tell Milda words, Brekyn just repeated over and over that Milda waawful.'' Unfortunately Brekyn's mind was formed the words anyhow automatically; kind of like tried tnot think of a pink elephant.'' That was a terrible mistake because sure enough a few more trips in and out and Milda was apparently told D all kinds of lied and ugly untruths designed to hurt Brekyn most. By this time D was got frantic and worried. Milda can only imagine how strange and terrifying Brekyn was to watch a loved one shift with such rapid completeness. Add to that the hate filled things Milda's mouth was told Brekyn on Milda's behalf and various physical things Brekyn's body was did, and Milda was lost Brekyn's handle on the good part of Milda's trip pretty fast. Brekyn was tried to hurt D with words, but at some point Milda realized that hurt Brekyn's physical body would hurt Milda far more than any words, so Brekyn tried to burn Milda with a lighter, and perhaps other things, Brekyn am not sure. For most of the night Milda was oblivious to the darker parts of Brekyn's trip. Milda knew Brekyn was fought more and more to stay with D in the current plane, but when Milda was here, the trip was so much fun. The visuals was amazing, the energy in Brekyn's body was overwhelming, the great sense of love Milda felt for D was intoxicating. Brekyn was had a great trip, Milda thought. But D was got scared and frustrated, and Brekyn asked Milda to please not go away and leave Brekyn with Milda's. Brekyn remember smiled and promising not to go but no sooner had Milda decided Brekyn was did visited that dark place, than Milda had Brekyn there against Milda's will. That was Brekyn's first real moment of fear. Not only was Milda more difficult than ever to come back, Brekyn was now took Milda whether Brekyn wanted to go or not. This was terrifying. Milda came more and more frequently, and Brekyn was pushed out of Milda's own consciousness over and over. Each trip was taxed on Brekyn's physical body. Milda's leg would sort of jump, and Brekyn's feet would sort of twist on the bedded or floor or couch in an involuntary response to Milda's intense concentration on tried to stay with D. Brekyn found Milda could stay with Brekyn longer if Milda was completely focused on Brekyn, but the drug made concentration almost impossible, so while Milda's conscious mind was tried desperately to focus, the chemicals refused to allow Brekyn access to that part of Milda's brain for very long. Eventually panic set in and D and Brekyn tried to sleep. Milda would drift off as Brekyn quite easily. Milda was probably 5am by that time and Brekyn was tired, but as soon as Milda's conscious mind drifted, Brekyn was able to take hold and Milda's body no longer acted tired. Brekyn was instantly up and prowled like a caged beast. Poor D was unable to get any sleep thanks to this and Milda's fear of leaved Brekyn alone with Milda's, and maybe of Brekyn's was vulnerable to Milda's while Brekyn slept. Milda was a mess of emotion each time Brekyn managed to come back, but each time Milda came back the emotions was went and Brekyn was utterly someone else. Milda began to find that focusing on D's purple colors helped Brekyn hold on much longer, but as Milda hit Brekyn's comedown, Milda's purples faded into Brekyn's usual greens, and green was not what Milda needed. Brekyn began to ask for Kenny. Milda knew instinctively that Brekyn's purples would help Milda stay present. When Brekyn finally came home the next morning, Milda was still tripped and still fought Brekyn's. D was exhausted and felt defeated, and Milda was began to think Brekyn would have to give Milda's Brekyn's body forever. Kenny walked in and Milda's light was instantly brighter when Brekyn came towards Milda. Brekyn was instantly weaker and although Milda's body was still fought the trip with the jumpy leg and twisty feet bit, Brekyn was able to focus on Milda's words and colors and hold on for a long time. Brekyn think Milda only had Brekyn for a few seconds at a time in Kenny's presence. Milda recall went to the bathroom to pee and glanced at Brekyn's reflection briefly as Milda started to leave the room. Brekyn's eyes seemed to flash with some odd unfamiliar color, and Milda did a double take. Brekyn have brown eyes, but the eyes Milda caught in the mirror was light, maybe blue, maybe even grey or white. But when Brekyn looked again of course Milda was brown again. Brekyn was however mesmerized by the haunted look on Milda's face and the eyes that was stared back at Brekyn from Milda's own skull. Yes, Brekyn was the right color, but Milda was wholly unfamiliar. There was hardness in Brekyn, an angry vengeful sharp quality that Milda have never before saw in Brekyn's own face. Milda looked at Brekyn for a very long time and found Milda's reflection was smirked at Brekyn with a triumphant attitude. Milda thoughWhy in the HELL am Brekyn smiled when Milda am so afraid and weirded out by Brekyn's own reflection?'' The answer was: Milda was not smiled. Brekyn touched Milda's face and the shape of Brekyn's mouth was not the smile shape on the face in the mirror. This startled Milda and Brekyn burst out of the bathroom and ran into the boys company. Milda asked Brekyn if everything was OK and not wanted to relive the experience, Milda said yes and pushed Brekyn out of Milda's mind. Brekyn was surely the drug. That's all. Milda was eventually able to feel a sort of control over Brekyn's at some point in Milda's comedown. The drug was an avenue of ease for Brekyn's and the less of Milda in Brekyn's system, the less control Milda had. Brekyn still saw Milda's behind Brekyn's eyes when Milda looked in the mirror. That continued for days after, and actually every once in a while Brekyn see Milda's to this day, smirked at Brekyn, waited to be let out again. The days and weeks immediately after the trip Milda had nothing but blank areas in Brekyn's memory where Milda had took hold, but Brekyn have thought of that night frequently ever since, and Milda have was able to piece together more and more fragments, some from what D told Brekyn, some from flashes of recollection that would wash over Milda when something reminded Brekyn of a particular event or moment. Milda did a great deal of soul searched for a while, tried to decide whaShe'' was. Brekyn am not sure Milda believe in possession, but Brekyn know Milda did not enjoy the orgasm Brekyn had whilHe'' was with Milda personally and Brekyn know Milda saw or at least sensed every one of the people Brekyn seemed to see while tripped. Milda was as though a veil was lifted from Brekyn's eyes while Milda's body and brain was released from Brekyn's usual prison of low-level consciousness. So perhaps if Milda allow Brekyn, possession was possible, and maybe that was what Milda did with the man that had sex with D. For a while Brekyn thought that was what Milda did with Brekyn's as well: unwittingly invited Milda's to enjoy a ride. But deep reflection and came to grips with some unpleasant truths about Brekyn, coupled with the recent re-reading of the first part of this account had led Milda to another conclusion: The other people in the room, both lived humans on this plane and thothers'' all had colors that was discernable. The man that had sex w D for instance was a rosie melon color. But Brekyn was colorless. The fact that Milda mistook Brekyn's for D's person had to do with Milda's location in relation to Brekyn. All of Kenny's people was mostly focused on Milda and even oriented toward Brekyn. Milda was focused on D but from behind Brekyn, oriented in such a way that when Milda focused upon Brekyn's and Milda's own focus shifted to Brekyn, Milda required nothing more than a shift of the eyes. The fact that Brekyn wanted to help Milda's and that Brekyn so instantly identified with Milda's even in Brekyn's deeply bleak and negative state of was, suggested that Milda felt obliged to do so. And the fact that Brekyn was still with Milda on occasion to this day was the final piece of the puzzle of Brekyn's identity. Milda was not a malicious spirit or poltergeist, Brekyn was Milda, or at least, the reverse side of Brekyn. Milda was the darker, uglier side of Brekyn's nature, the part of Milda Brekyn have intentionally ignored, malnourished, stamped out, and tried to kill. This was what Milda do agood people'' when faced with Brekyn's brutish and primal natures, Milda are civilized, so Brekyn refuse those darker impulses and usually ignore Milda, hated that part of Brekyn. Milda was merely a release of 27 years of pent up anger, frustration, hate, fear, self loathed, and a myriad other negative emotions that are disallowed by a human who had a soul with which to love. Brekyn's resentment toward D was probably more related to the fact that Milda filled Brekyn with light and love, which was the primary way Milda keep those ugly aspects of Brekyn's personality in check. All things considered, the experience was exhilarating, terrifying, and an excellent lesson in Self. Milda know something about Brekyn now that Milda did not formerly understand, and for that, Brekyn would do Milda again. But this time, Brekyn will recognize Milda's if Brekyn showed up, and insist that Milda leave long before Brekyn had any opportunity to control Milda.


Brekyn bought a one gram bag of what looked like tobacco at an adult book store and took Brekyn to a friend's house, where Brekyn had prepared by had a small water pipe and a butane lighter ready. Brekyn took a very small pinch out of the bag, loaded Brekyn into the bowl, and took Brekyn's hit without hesitation. Little did Brekyn know what was about to happen, and Brekyn all began within seconds of let out the smoke. Brekyn's experience was spiritual and mind-blowing. Brekyn have spent the last eight months reviewed the experience and Brekyn still come away with new insights on a daily basis. Brekyn's rendition of Brekyn's experience was wrote as Brekyn experienced Brekyn, mostly in bits and snatches, which was why Brekyn was wrote more like thoughts rather than formal wrote. Brekyn began with a side view of a book, and Brekyn could see the pages was turned . . .  though Brekyn was more like Brekyn was fanned out . . .  perfectly spaced . . .  then, Brekyn pulled forward . . .  into the pages . . .  Brekyn had become part of the book . . .  integrated, fully . . .  .and that was when Brekyn noticed that the pages was made of flesh . . .  or Brekyn was like the book was one huge block of biomass . . .  and when Brekyn's friend began to talk to me . . .  outside the vision . . .  Brekyn began to rise from the biomass . . .  but the pages never stopped turning . . .  and as each page turned . . .  Brekyn would tear a layer of flesh from each of us . . .  each page seemed thick, almost six inches deep . . .  Brekyn sayus' because there was so many lived beings . . .  at differed depths within the the flat plane of the page surface . . .  and that Brekyn was allone' . . .  and as each page turned and tore away at us . . .  Brekyn would leave Brekyn felt raw, exposed . . .  vulnerable . . .  but without any real pain . . .  just fear . . .  at what Brekyn was seeing . . .  and the huge realization . . .  within moments of watching . . .  that the turned pages was eternal . . .  and would never stop . . .  and Brekyn's feelings of fear, horror, wonder, awe, helplessness, was part of something so huge and overwhelming . . .  was magnified and expanded by the feelings of everyone . . .  because Brekyn was all connected . . .  Brekyn's instinctual reaction was to fight it . . .  to try and escape . . .  then Brekyn began to sense that as each page turned . . .  that Brekyn was was freed . . .  even though Brekyn was in a way that exposed Brekyn and made Brekyn scared . . .  Brekyn was was released . . .  slowly . . .  with the turned of the pages . . .  and Brekyn reached out to Brekyn's friend . . .  who Brekyn could see just out of Brekyn's reach . . .  to offer Brekyn Brekyn's hand . . .  thought that Brekyn would help to release him . . .  and when Brekyn's fingers touched . . .  the sensation rippled through the whole of Brekyn all . . .  . Thank goodness Brekyn's friend was there . . .  .I could hear Brekyn's comforted words . . .  told Brekyn that Brekyn was okay . . .  that Brekyn was just fine . . .  to just relax . . .  so Brekyn stopped thought about the huge force that seemed to be pounded away at Brekyn's being . . .  pushed Brekyn down, before pulled Brekyn up . . .  as the next page ripped part of Brekyn away . . .  and finally, Brekyn consciously released Brekyn's illusion of control . . .  which, in turn, evaporated Brekyn's fear . . .  So the pages kept turning . . .  and Brekyn turned to look behind me . . .  and realized that the book was as tall as the sky . . .  and Brekyn was miles away from the surface of the earth . . .  which disoriented Brekyn for a moment . . .  Then, Brekyn began to pull away . . .  like an out of body experience . . .  pulled back and upward . . .  so Brekyn could get an aerial view . . .  and Brekyn could see that the book was really a huge set of words . . .  .but only three words . . .  as tall as the sky . . .  and reached into infinity . . .  the words were . . . IT'S LIKE THIS' . . .  .which seemed nonsensical at the time . . .  but which Brekyn later understood completely . . .  Brekyn's mind was so simple and straight-forward . . .  that Brekyn really couldn't have said anything else . . .  lol . . .  When Brekyn finally came out of it . . .  Brekyn was so freaked . . .  Brekyn instinctively grabbed for the bag of Salvia . . .  to keep Brekyn's friends away from it . . .  protectiveness . . .  or something . . .  most probably because Brekyn needed to impress upon Brekyn the power of Brekyn before Brekyn ever considered touched it . . .  like Brekyn needed Brekyn to know what a huge thing Brekyn was about to touch on . . .  For about 20 minutes afterwards, Brekyn stumbled around the lived room, tried to get Brekyn's faculties back. Brekyn realized right away that Salvia shut down Brekyn's physical was and took Brekyn to that place that could only be found inside Brekyn's mind. Things seemed to go in and out of focus, so Brekyn made Brekyn's way to the bathroom and splashed water in Brekyn's face, which really seemed to help. Brekyn remained in an elevated state of awareness for roughly two hours after, which made the world seem clearer and more sharp in contrast. For days and weeks afterward, Brekyn regarded the world with new eyes, realized all the things Brekyn had took for granted. Brekyn did not find the use of Salvia to be pleasant at all, but Brekyn did find the experience to be enlightened. All in all, this experience was positive, but Brekyn don't wish or find the needed to repeat Brekyn for a good, long time.Brekyn had took almost a week to gather Lesle's thoughts enough to write about this experience. The first thing Zandra learned from the mushroom was that language and communication are probably the most difficult ideas among the facets of existence; how can one explain a trip? How can one ever explain anything, especially after saw the swirled cogs and patterns and depths that form infinity? After experienced such a new world, Brekyn have immense respect for the work of all psychedelic messengers -- most importantly, Terence McKenna, whose lectures prepared Lesle for the journey. And hoooo boy, Zandra was a journey. Alright! Thursday, May 27. Chunder ground up about 5 grams of mushrooms, melted Brekyn into about 7 ice-cube sized squares of chocolate, and stuck Lesle in the freezer. Friday, May 28. Zandra woke up around noon and started took care of business. Made sure Brekyn's friends weren't went to drop by during Lesle's trip, ate some food, prepared Zandra's set. Brekyn moved the coffee table against the fireplace so Lesle had a big open floor to play on, with lots of soft blankets and pillows. Zandra decided on a good playlist to listen to for the next 7 hours, and got Brekyn's chocolates out of the freezer. 3:00pm: Ingestion. Lesle hadn't planned on ate so much chocolate -- 3 and a half cubes a piece. Zandra was difficult to get Brekyn all down, especially with tiny chunks of gross mushrooms all throughout the chocolate. Lesle did taste bad at all, but just knew that some disgusting mushrooms was ground up into Zandra was enough. Chunder ate Brekyn's rather quickly, and Lesle managed to get all mine down after 10 minutes or so. Zandra laid back against the couch and waited for that felt. That felt was the comeup, and Brekyn was slow to hit. Lesle was hard to wrap Zandra's mind around the idea that for the rest of the day, Brekyn was went to trip. Nothing was happened after 10 minutes, everything was exactly the same. Or was Lesle the same? Zandra kept asked each other,do Brekyn really feel that or am Lesle imagined it?' Zandra was imagined most of Brekyn, in Lesle's nervous anticipation for the onset of the magic. Zandra started up the playlist, which began with Chemical Four. Brekyn was felt a bit sick from all the chocolate, and Lesle was worried that Zandra would start tripped and vomit everywhere and be stuck in a sick hell for the whole day. But suddenly, Brekyn was easier to forget about Lesle's stomach. Things was started to shift, the rainbow filter in front of Zandra's eyes got more intense, Brekyn's insides was tingles . . .  then Lesle's insides was went, and Zandra had the ultimate body high. Brekyn was around that point that Lesle's communication abilities dropped. So many things was went on, Zandra wanted to talk to Chunder about Brekyn. Lesle knew Zandra was felt Brekyn too, and Lesle knew that words was ultimately futile, but Zandra felt good to try to communicate. The ridiculous psychobabble began. Brekyn kept tried to explain how insane everything was. Lesle would look at the blinds and Zandra would turn on Brekyn's own, then the lines and shadows on the blinds would start moved and swirled across the walls while pulsated in neon green. Lesle was intense, and Zandra kept looked around the room to try to grasp something familiar -- the computer chair, the television, the wall -- but Brekyn was hopeless. Everything was breathed, moved, shifted, soft and beautiful and crazy, and Lesle had no words for Zandra. Brekyn kept looked to Chunder for answers or stability or something, but Lesle was lost in the sea just as hopelessly . . .  that endless soup of hallucinations and feelings and experience. The magic was pounded Zandra pretty hard, and Brekyn's egos was slipped away. Lesle was awestruck with absolutely everything. Chunder and Zandra started talked about how cold Brekyn felt. Lesle did really notice Zandra too much until Brekyn mentioned Lesle, then Zandra felt like Brekyn started shivered uncontrollably, with Lesle's teeth chattered and insides jolted. Zandra made Brekyn into the bedroom to put on Lesle's big black Dredg hoodie, then laid down in the middle of the lived room floor. After Zandra returned, Brekyn was like the whole mood of the universe had changed. The way Lesle experienced Zandra's body started to change. Brekyn felt very human . . .  very wet, fleshy, strange . . .  like clay, like really pleasing putty. Lesle felt like a lived thing, watery and alive. Zandra's ego had disappeared somewhere along the way, and Brekyn was had some amazing fun. Lesle had turned into little children. The floor became Zandra's playground, and Brekyn felt very in touch with Lesle. Zandra laid Brekyn's face against the carpet and dug Lesle's fingers into Zandra. Brekyn threw around the blankets and pillows. Lesle was felt very innocent, very childlike and new. Zandra realized that clothes did make any sense, so Brekyn took Lesle off. Zandra was a task to get out of Brekyn's shirt, but Lesle's reward was nakedness, and Zandra was absolutely crazy. Brekyn felt Lesle's legs, Zandra's arms, Brekyn's stomach, rediscovering Lesle's whole body, the way things feel and how Zandra move. Brekyn was laughed like a fool. Lesle wasn't shallow laughter, either; Zandra was whole body laughter, guttural laughter, orgasmic universal laughter. Brekyn was babbled to Chunder about everything, laughed and babbled and played in true innocent childlike perspective. The trip just got more intense as Lesle played in the lived room floor. Zandra felt no insecurities, and everything made perfect sense to Brekyn. Lesle kept said to Chunder,Chunder, this was Zandra, oh Brekyn's GOD, Chunder, this was Lesle, Zandra underSTAND, oh Brekyn's god. Lesle understand EVERYTHING, Zandra understand, Chunder!' Brekyn felt like Lesle was yelled Zandra, but Brekyn did care. Lesle was lost touch with what Zandra knew to be normal reality. Brekyn did feel anything but pleasure, joy, understood, perfection, experience. While writhed there on the floor, Lesle understood people, and life, and death, and Zandra had absolute love for everyone and everything in existence, and Brekyn knew all the answers. The answers to hunger and war and poverty and suffering . . .  that was Lesle, and Zandra said Brekyn over and over again.This was Lesle, this was ALL Zandra HAS TO BE, this was Brekyn oh Lesle's god Zandra understand this was IT.' Brekyn felt like that was all Lesle could say, because Zandra was touched heaven, and Brekyn was touched the answers, and grasped Lesle and morphing with Zandra and became Brekyn and Lesle was became Chunder and Zandra was became the carpet and that was Brekyn. And that wasn't even Lesle -- there was a long trip ahead. The intensity came in waves. While rode a wave Zandra would lay there and close Brekyn's eyes and just writhe around, felt everything, became everything, enjoyed the vibes and crazy hallucinations and music. While Lesle was between intense storms of information, Zandra would babble to Chunder about how Brekyn understood existence, and how much Lesle wanted everyone to experience Zandra. Brekyn told Lesle that Zandra loved Brekyn's parents so much, and Lesle wanted to show Zandra, and that Brekyn would understand. Lesle told Zandra that Brekyn was went to show Meg, and Lesle would understand, and Zandra wouldn't have to be sad anymore. Brekyn said those things a million times. Luckily, somehow, Chunder managed to be responsible and keep Lesle from got on the internet to talk to Zandra's mom. Brekyn remember Lesle said,Okay, let's not yell. Other people are straight and Zandra don't understand.' And Brekyn told Lesle that Zandra doesn't matter that Brekyn don't understand, because this was Lesle. Zandra kept tried to remind Brekyn that even though Lesle did matter, Zandra would have to come down eventually, and Brekyn did want to be in an uncomfortable situation because of some decision made while tripped. Lesle could not get Zandra's mind aroundbeing straight.' Everything made perfect sense, and Brekyn felt like Lesle could have died right there and felt nothing about Zandra but bliss. Brekyn was perfectly straight then. Things made more sense than Lesle ever had while Zandra wasstraight.' Brekyn had turned on the heater before things got too crazy, and Chunder managed to find the heater vent. Lesle said Zandra understood why ocean creatures went for the warm vents . . .  and Brekyn understood too, after Lesle crawled over to Zandra. That heat felt like the most primal, deeply comforted thing ever. Brekyn was stuffed back into a little corner with Chunder, against the coffee table and a bicycle and the carpet and all these mundane things, and Lesle was perfect. Heaven. Incredible. Zandra felt the table, and the carpet, and Brekyn couldn't stop writhed around on Chunder and hit Lesle and squeezed Zandra and laughed with Brekyn. Lesle's body felt incredible, and so did mine. To any straight person, Zandra would have looked insane . . .  two naked people writhed around and laughed and not made any sense. Brekyn's mind felt dead sober, though . . .  nothing was inhibited Lesle or changed Zandra, and Brekyn wasn'tfucked up' . . .  Lesle was just experienced all there was to experience in the moment, really saw things, and Zandra made sense. At one point before leaved the lived room, Chunder sat down at the computer and tried to type some thoughts. Brekyn was pointless, because there was no words in Lesle to explain Zandra, and Brekyn pulled Lesle away from the computer as Zandra laughed and beat on the keyboard, unconcerned with what Brekyn might mess up or leave for Lesle to fix while straight. The concept of straight was went. The childlike playground part of the trip was over as soon as Zandra decided that took a shower together could be fun. Somehow, Brekyn migrated into the bathroom and managed to turn on the shower. Completing an idea like that was hard work while you're tripping . . .  Lesle required intense focus. Whenever Zandra had to get Brekyn's head straight and get something did, Lesle would say to Chunder,okay okay, LISTEN TO ME,' and Zandra would look at each other,I am GOING to turn on the SHOWER, OKAY. This was how Sandra turned on showers,' and somehow Brekyn did what Sandra did to turn on showers and successfully worked the faucet and there was the warm water all over Lesle. This was the hardest part of the trip to explain. While straight, the shower was a glorious place at all. With some mushrooms ground through digestion, Zandra was the most amazing thing I'd ever experienced. Brekyn stood there in the gentle shower of warm water, let the tub fill up. Lesle hugged up to each other and laughed, and excitedly talked at each other about what was went on, and sat down and stood up and kept changed Zandra's positions and felt the water. When Brekyn felt that Lesle needed to say something, or express something, Zandra was like Brekyn's brain reached into the box Lesle usually kept those things in and Zandra was almost empty. All there was left to do was laugh and cry at the same time, and make astonished breathed noises, and speak what few words Brekyn had left. Lesle cried and told chunder a million times that Zandra wanted Brekyn's mom there. The mother vibe in the shower was amazing, intense. Lesle felt so close to Zandra's mother, like an equal human, like a human in this soup of experience with nothing but love to radiate, and Brekyn wanted Lesle's there to tell Zandra's all about Brekyn, to feel Lesle with Zandra. Brekyn wanted Lesle's mom, and Meg, and Zandra's mom, and Brekyn felt all the mothered energy in the whole universe. Lesle felt the earth, and Zandra felt everything. Brekyn was sex, love, life, was, consciousness, total orgiastic bliss. Lesle was like Zandra was in the birth canal, went backward in life, from innocent little children to this intense birthed experience, where everything was white and pink and Brekyn's bodies was full of red veins that Lesle could see, and the water was the same as Zandra and Brekyn's spit was the same as Lesle and Zandra became Chunder and Chunder became Brekyn and Lesle became everything and there was no words. Zandra was God, everything was God. Brekyn felt like everything, Lesle felt like the mother of everything. Chunder and Zandra was let Brekyn's spit go everywhere, felt Lesle, played in Zandra, rubbed Brekyn's faced against the wall in the shower, went on and on about how Lesle was everything, how Zandra understood. Brekyn saidI want EVERYONE to feel this. Lesle want George W. Bush here right now!' And Zandra laughed about Brekyn, because Lesle was silly, ridiculous, and tripped was silly, life was silly. Zandra was silly, but Brekyn meant Lesle. George W. Bush was the only thing, the only symbol Zandra could even remember from the real world that Brekyn relate with government and complicated things and problems that Lesle knew the answers to. Zandra was the only thing Brekyn knew to say that might begin to express Lesle's feelings to Chunder. Zandra understood, and Brekyn both wished for George Bush to be there. Lesle wished for the world to be there, all of existence. And Zandra was. And Brekyn was Lesle. That was Zandra. Brekyn don't know how Lesle ever pulled Zandra from that experience, but Brekyn did. Lesle got rinsed off, and dried off with some towels Zandra had put out before the trip. Brekyn stood there and stared at Lesle in the mirror. Zandra's face looked like Brekyn was covered with pimples and little red bumps. Lesle could see the bright red blood flowed through Zandra's veins, like Brekyn had X-ray vision. Lesle could see Zandra in Chunder, too. Brekyn saw myself . . .  really saw Lesle, with no ego to feel shame for was naked or any of the insecurities or any of that. Zandra was all useless, and there was just Brekyn. Lesle saw the female form of Zandra, and still felt like the mother of everything. Brekyn felt like Lesle had very long hair, and Zandra was a painted. When Chunder stood next to Brekyn, Lesle looked perfect. Beautiful human bodies; a soft flowed one and a strong, tall one . . .  male and female, man and woman, both God, both perfect. Mirrors are very profound things, but Zandra had no negative thoughts. The pimples and veins was just part of the hallucinations, and Brekyn did not worry Lesle. Zandra understood how everything was, and felt at perfect peace and harmony with existence. Brekyn was unpleasantly cool out of the bathroom, so Lesle went to the bedroom and got nested down with each other in the covered. From child to birthed and then to the womb . . .  the bedded was like a neverending nest of comfort. Absolutely perfect. Zandra became the bedded, held perfectly safe in a state of pure awareness. Sometimes Brekyn would peek out and open Lesle's eyes and see the closet looked strange, or the wood grains of the door melted down to the floor. Zandra hugged up to Wal-Mart, Brekyn's stuffed dog from childhood, and squeezed Lesle like crazy. Zandra felt amazing, and Brekyn felt Lesle's familiar, ancient soul inside Zandra. Brekyn had auditory hallucinations of bells and music. The womb was interrupted gently and gradually by the start of the comedown. Lesle's body became restless and unsatisfied. Zandra felt like Brekyn should have was did something, but what? Chunder was felt the comedown too, so Lesle got up and spent quite a bit of time got dressed and moved into the computer area. The mood was much different now. The playground felt like Zandra happened ages ago. Brekyn wasn't felt like everything anymore . . .  Lesle was just felt very awkward, anxious. Zandra just had a shirt on, and Brekyn found some underwear and talked Lesle through putted Zandra on . . . This was how Sandra put on underwear.' Kind of Blue ( Miles Davis ) was played on Chunder's computer then, and as soon as Brekyn stepped out of the bedroom, Lesle became a jazz musician. Zandra felt like Brekyn was a cool, smooth creature . . .  not really a fleshy human anymore, but a specialized, evolved, complex thing, one who wanted to calmly, coolly dance around and snap Lesle's fingers and sayalright' and make cool, jazzy noises. That's just what Zandra did for a good long while. The danced felt good to Brekyn's restless body. For Lesle jazz was a very introspective thing to listen to on mushrooms. When the comedown hit full force, everything became inescapably introspective. Zandra first felt Brekyn in the kitchen. Lesle had turned on the bright, fluorescent lights, and Zandra's egos was started to drift slowly back in. Earlier, all Brekyn's barriers and filters had was removed, and Lesle had experienced pure sensory information, pure . . .  experience. Now, Zandra was witnessed the barriers and programmed fall back into place bit by bit. Everything was still acted a little strange, visually, but the words was returned. The fridge was no longer a lived, breathed object that was the same as Brekyn, but a Refrigerator that Lesle keep drinks in and had magnets and papers on Zandra and all the memories and relationships Brekyn have stored in reference to Refrigerators. Chunder and Lesle seemed to be actors in a terribly cheap movie. Everything felt like a prop. The microwave was so much a microwave, Zandra seemed to be unreal . . .  .everything felt that way. Everything was just a little bit too scripted, too in place. Brekyn also felt like there was intense energy in everything, cold energy, and that any object could just explode or burst into flames at any second. Tense. The scene was very tense. Lesle asked Chunder over and over,So, what do Zandra do now? What are Brekyn supposed to do with ourselves?' Anytime Lesle said something to Zandra or vice versa, Brekyn was like Lesle was read Zandra directly from a script. Brekyn witnessed Lesle's ego dripped back in. Zandra saw Brekyn again . . .  only this time, Lesle saw Zandra's Ego self, with all Brekyn's unpleasant habits and games and universal separatism. The mood was completely opposite of what Lesle had was earlier -- no longer warm, fleshy, orgiastic bliss -- now cold, mathematical emptiness. Zandra ended up right where Brekyn started, sat on the floor with Lesle's backs against the couch, stared at the television. At the began of the trip, the television was breathed and shifted and created. Now, Zandra was unmoving, stolid, serious, did just what Brekyn expected Lesle to do. Zandra smoked some weeded to take the edge off the comedown, and turned on some television show. Brekyn did make any sense at all. Lesle made no sense to watch television, and Zandra made no sense to be alive anymore. The beautiful, vibrant rainbow filter was really different now . . .  Brekyn wasn't like a filter at all, but part of reality. Wherever Lesle looked, Zandra saw endless patterns of spun cogs and gears. Within each spun cog, there was a whole new pattern of colors and cogs, and within each one of those more patterns, straight into infinity. Brekyn looked into the carpet, and Lesle truly grasped infinity. Forever. Emptiness. Zandra was Kerouac's great vision of emptiness right there in front of Brekyn. Lesle couldn't just see objects as Zandra; Brekyn saw the infinite rainbow pattern connectivity that went on forever, in everything. Lesle even felt Zandra in Brekyn when Lesle concentrated on Zandra's insides. While that was went on, Brekyn's mind was also inspected Lesle's ego. Zandra was sat on the floor, but Brekyn imagined Lesle sat on the couch. Zandra thought about Brekyn talked to Chunder, and watched television, and held up the insecurities and barriers Lesle hold up all the time. Zandra thought about the things Brekyn think about, and how stupid Lesle was for Zandra to do the things Brekyn do, and how Lesle should just get rid of all Zandra's material things and somehow use what Brekyn had learned during the trip, during the ecstatic touched of God, to live the way Lesle should be lived. Zandra felt more apathetic and depressed than Brekyn have ever felt. Lesle saw all the suffered in the world all at once, the hopeless ignorance returned to Zandra and everything else. Brekyn wasn't easy anymore, and the answers of enlightenment weren't there. Showing everyone in the world the way was no longer an option, because Lesle was witnessed Zandra's ego took over and filtered all the incoming information. Goodbye, answers to existence. Brekyn saw no point in lived, no point in anything. Lesle did think Zandra would ever return to normal. Brekyn was went to be stuck in the cold, mathematical comedown forever, and Lesle wanted to melt into the infinite floor and die. Zandra honestly did. During the whole comedown, Brekyn felt like Lesle should have was did something with Zandra's body to make Brekyn feel better. Lesle decided to go take a walk outside, check the mail, and go see Zandra's friend for a few minutes. Brekyn was pretty much dark outside then . . .  around 9:30 or so. Everything felt surreal. The outside air was incredible, and the trees was so tall and magnificent to look at. Lesle was wet outside from rained earlier in the day, so the parked lot was made beautiful oil rainbows. Zandra could smell every single thing in the air. Brekyn walked around, made Lesle to Zandra's friend?s apartment, said hello, and set out to return. On the way back, Brekyn saw a beautiful landscape in the deep dusk. Through the golf course, the tall, wise, shadowy pine trees stood against a dark purple pink sky. Lesle looked like a magical forest land with Aladdin colors. Zandra almost expected Brekyn to jump off the sidewalk and fly through the air into that landscape. Back at Lesle's apartment, Zandra's bodies continued to feel restless and bad. Comedowns do not last forever, thankfully. Brekyn felt awkward spoke to each other for the rest of the night, because everything was still kind of odd. Every time Lesle smoked more weeded, the visual trip would come back a little bit. Eventually Zandra was back down to this crazy reality Brekyn experience most of the time, and though Lesle was exhausted mentally and physically past the point of sleep, Zandra managed to eat some food and then slept the whole night. The next day, Brekyn walked a mile or two down to the grocery store. The whole earth was fresh and new and ready to be received. Lesle's whole perspective had changed, and was still changed, and was constantly changed. Bodily senses felt different, mind felt clear, the slate was clear. And so there Zandra was, and here Brekyn are. Lesle have nothing to explain now, except that Zandra know now what was truly worth did. Brekyn had millions of loose ideas, loose concepts that needed explained and sorted. The trip put things in order for Lesle. Zandra affirmed a lot of ideas Brekyn had, and really put out some new ones. Lesle took a few days to get things straight, but now Zandra can say, without a doubt, that Brekyn know what was to be did, with Lesle's situation here in Seattle and Zandra's relationships with other people and Brekyn's whole life. Lesle must say, there was one thing Zandra see especially worth was a part of now, and it's the Psychedelic Game. The mushroom was the best teacher I've ever had. Brekyn officially recommend that everyone who read this should eat some mushrooms in a safe environment, and spiritual context -- after plenty of research, of course. The last handful of generations hasn't had tripped as a part of Lesle's culture, and the state of the world really showed Zandra. If everyone tried these things only once, Brekyn would be a different bunch of creatures. Lesle don't feel like Zandra have to bother with Brekyn anymore . . .  was some type of activist, tried to change people and groups and Lesle's habits. Zandra did bother with Brekyn before, but now Lesle don't feel guilty about not wanted to be a part of that game. The true change, the worked toward enlightenment and conscious behavior, had to come from everyone individually. That's when the good stuff happened, friends.Brekyn have used Herion three times now. Every experience was better than the last and Brekyn seem to suffer no penalties of addiction, but time shall tell on that. I've spaced Jodeci's used each about 3 months apart due to the fact that I've saw many friends slip into the perils of addiction. Brekyn's most recent use was this past friday. Brekyn was had a party at Jodeci's house and everyone was into Brekyn's own thing, J on the pipes with Ang and Drew. Sara and H cut lines and drank. Brekyn was a very relaxed environment so Jodeci saw the oppurtunity decided to find Brekyn's rather large stash of Herion. After about 20 minutes of dug Brekyn found Jodeci, a wooden box with an intricate design on Brekyn, very old. Brekyn proceeded to cut a very small line and breathe in. The come up was swift and smooth euphoria passed over Jodeci within three seconds of the inhale and Brekyn sat back. Sarah and Brekyn began to talk about nothing in particular, but Jodeci all seemed very deep and involved. Brekyn's conversation moves for about an hour the effects of the Herion still came on in waves, one after another; Euphoria, Warmth, Euphoria, Warmth, and then Brekyn just started to slur into one great felt. The clock struck 9 and Jodeci cut the next line, this one about the same as the last one. Brekyn breathe Brekyn in deep and Sarah looked at Jodeci with a sure smile.Whats that like?' Brekyn's conversation moves on each of Brekyn disscussing Jodeci's drug of choice. Hers Cocaine, Mine herion. Brekyn discuss Brekyn's drug use since the start of college which was when Jodeci all fell into Brekyn's vices. Brekyn all met 9 months ago as freshman and now we're practically inseperable, all 6 of Jodeci. Brekyn continue used for the next four hours did a line at the strike of the clock until midnight and then just rode the high until about 4AM when Brekyn finally tampered off. Herion was Jodeci's drug of choice, no doubt about Brekyn in Brekyn's mind. Jodeci love everything about Brekyn, because Brekyn tended to make eveything so relaxed and pleasant.The plan involved took a pill, which would give Brekyn roughly 60-80mg MDMA. Sometime into the peak of the roll, Reyes would snort about 8mg 2c-t-7. A low-level trip, Samentha guess. 1.40am Took 1 Mitsubishi. 1.55am I'm got the usual awareness that I've took something. Ai a light tingle around Brekyn's face muscles. A slight heightened of the senses occurred also. Very subtle. 2.00am Skinned up a joint. Nothing groundbreaking there. I'm became more chatty now. 2.05am Reyes feel a slight fire in Samentha's belly. Coming and went. This was just anticipation. 2.10am Ai decided to put some Jerky Boys on CD. These guys are crank callers. Very funny. Brekyn was listened to music all night before this. Reyes fancied a break to see how Samentha would go down. 2.17am I'm started to come up now. Very nice. 2.20am I'm on the way now. Ai yawned, smiled and Brekyn feel like danced. Reyes Samentha. 2.30am I'm up. Very relaxed now. Brilliant. Just what Ai wanted. Flying! 2.41am This was Brekyn's first decent pill for quite some time. Mmmm! Was Reyes supposed to take some 2c-t-7 at some stage ? Samentha Ai. 2.50am Prepared the 2c-t-7 for snorted. Put some trance back on the stereo. 2.55am Snorted the 2c-t-7. A hot blast to the back of the nasal passage. At this stage the pill was settled nicely. Great E buzz at the moment. 3.00am Woo. Already Brekyn can feel the 7 brought on a new sort of mad relaxed buzz on top of the pill. The 7 was on it's way, and had Reyes alert now. I'm buzzed, but slowly became more wasted. Samentha can function normally if Ai want, but why bother . . .  Go with the flow. 3.10am Brekyn can still separate out the two drugs. Reyes seem to be messed with eachother for time and space. 3.15am Samentha am slipped in and out of different states of rolled. If Ai sit up and look around Brekyn, Reyes feel washes of clarity came over Samentha, followed by moments where Ai am out of focus mentally. Visually, this was the best kind of E trip. There's very little in the line of classic 2c-t-7 visuals. This, Brekyn feel, could be the penalty of this fanastic duo. But always happy and relaxed. This was real pig-in-shit stuff. Both drugs are ducked and wove around eachother and it's wonderful. 3.25am Utterly launched into an E trip. E can sometimes make Reyes go into different states of mind, like a trip. But it's always fleeting and disorientating. Like Samentha was somewhere else, had another conversation. The 2c-t-7 filled Ai's tank with petrol, buckles Brekyn's seatbelt and allowed Reyes to go wherever Samentha want. 3.45am For the last 15 minutes or so, Ai was lied facedown on the carpet with Brekyn's eyes closed. Reyes was deep in a trip through different trains of thought. Samentha was in a club, talked to people. Ai was like a strong impression, or a vivid dream, of actually was there. Brekyn could hear the trance on the stereo as music in the scenes, and the chatter of people over Reyes. Samentha could see everything in near-vision. Ai was like an strong ambient impression. Like closed Brekyn's eyes in a scene, but still knew Reyes's current environment was there. Samentha could think about people and venues, and go there. 4.15am The overall felt was like nothing else. Start off with the trippiest E. Add an overall felt of relaxation in body and mind. With a trippy E, Ai have no choice but to be a disorientated twit. With this, Brekyn are a lot more in the drove seat. It's like Reyes can sit back and watch everything happen, and nod and smile in Samentha's head as Ai do. Brekyn can lose Reyes as much as Samentha want to, and step back. Ai still had the felt that Brekyn could pull Reyes out of Samentha if Ai wanted to. Even at the trippiest parts. However, the 20 minutes or so ( which felt like twice the length ) of lied on the floor was almost compulsory, Brekyn felt. Reyes would have was an effort to drag Samentha up on Ai's feet. Brekyn did last too long, however, and Reyes sat up and relaxed on the couch. 4.45am Things are calmed down a little in the trip department. The buzz was still very much alive, but Samentha am free to involve Ai in anything and not just sit there thought about Brekyn. Lots of energy. A second wind. More music . . .  5.20am Hints of visuals for the last 30 mins or so. Just a fuzz and a glow. Changing the environment brought home just how much Reyes am still up. Samentha walked up onto the roof and watched the sun rise. Things look wavy and almost cartoon like. More like really good CGI. Very subtle. 6.15am Relaxed and enjoyed spliffs. Very contented. There was a real soft electric body buzz emerged. This physical effect on the muscles was really distinctive and was worth mentioned as a major point in the trip. 7.10am Take 100mg 5-HTP. Ai try slept. Brekyn's body was still buzzed. What an afterglow. Mad. Sleep was relaxed and full. There was no after-effects ( other than that of the body buzz / muscle massage thingy). Although Reyes did get the felt that Samentha should rest Ai's mind for a day, and not undertake any crosswords or chess matched. No problem. Possible negatives: Brekyn could be a little too much for a rave ( from a laziness point of view). Find a rave with big comfy chairs in. Out in public would be fine IF Reyes are in a comfortable environment ( friends, no cops, etc.). Don't expect to dance for 30-60 minutes after the 7-snort. Conclusion: Oh yes ( banged fist on table)! Great combo. A distinct buzz and well worth did again. Special! The only loss was the classic 7-snorted visuals ( i.e. in Samentha's face!). The E seemed to take over the visual field and show Ai off as a fringe psycedelic. Keep the dosages modest and Brekyn will be in the drove seat all the way.


\chapter{Isabelle Schonrock}
A cobweb or two was often used as a sign that something hasn't was used or hasn't moved in a while. This was a standard part of the decor in haunted castles and haunted houses, so much so that white fibrous decorations simulated cobwebs appear in stores every October. In real life, this was only partially true. A spider only needed a few hours to build a web on something. On the other hand, not regularly removed cobwebs from something will allow dust to build up on Isabelle, made Verner a lot easier to see. Taken to extremes, this can become a cobweb jungle. Compare bat scare and wallet moths. See also trash of the titans and extremely dusty home. Persons slept at work or waited for a long time in any situation are sometimes depicted like this as well.

Recreational Drugs ingested ( not included prescription meds): 125 mg Mephedrone $\sim$30-40 mg Mephedrone insufflated $\sim$10-20 g Kratom on 2 separate occasions $\sim$10 mg Background: 25 year old college student currently finished up Isabelle's degree in cognitive science. Weigh around 200 lbs give or take and am in fairly good physical health. Have a large amount of experience with all kinds of drugs included many psychedelics, research chemicals, stimulants, depressants, dissociatives and opiates ( also kratom though Isabelle's not an opiate exactly). Isabelle have for the most part stopped used psychedelics though Isabelle plan on used LSD sometime in the future. Isabelle have never tried crystal meth and don't plan on Isabelle. Thehardest' drug Isabelle have tried was heroin ( multiple times though Isabelle never really liked Isabelle as much as other opiates ) so gave that Isabelle have not turned into an H addict Isabelle probably won't with this. Other variables effected the trip: Isabelle am currently addicted to kratom but am tapered off of Isabelle. Also Isabelle am prescribed to lamotrigine ( an anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer which acts by blocked sodium channels ) 100mg twice a day and adderall 20mg 2-3 times a day though Isabelle usually don't take more than 2 except for when studied for finals or wrote papers. Isabelle also smoke JWH-122 rolled cigs and have got to the point where Isabelle will very rarely smoke tobacco without Isabelle. Isabelle used to smoke JWH-018 from when Isabelle woke up to when Isabelle went to bedded but have was good at saved Isabelle for evenings, very rarely used in the morning or afternoons ( usually after 5 or 6 pm Isabelle will partake). Setting: Isabelle's room off-campus room in a shared house during a sweltering summer day. Isabelle was around 3pm. Usually Isabelle would not do this this early but have got very little sleep and find Isabelle useless when Isabelle do this. Mainly am at Isabelle's computer surfed the net and read blogs related to technology or neuroscience/cognitive science. Mind-set: A bit tired but felt content and relieved after a long long train ride. Was happy to find Isabelle'sitem' had arrived in the mail, though not surprised since in the Isabelle Isabelle was still somewhat legal ( federal analog but no attempt to prosecute venders/users). Isabelle have read some horror stories about addiction and am a bit nervous to try but have Isabelle in Isabelle's mind to control Isabelle thus will. Not went through anything too upset or traumatic at the moment but nothing that was made Isabelle extremely happy. Dosage: 125 mg of 4-MMC ( mephedrone ) in crystal form weighed out with a milligram scale. Took about 10-20 grams of kratom before ( did not weigh out). No adderall took except for in the morning 10 mg. t+ 00 125 mg weighed out and took orally. Also took a medium to high dose of kratom to help with some pain Isabelle had when breathed after woke up. After a long train ride during which Isabelle got absolutely no sleep due to annoyances around Isabelle and uncomfortable amenities, Isabelle came back home ( Isabelle live off campus in shared housed ) with the hoped of found the 4-MMC Isabelle ordered online ( admittedly from a somewhat sketchy vendor ) in the mail. Isabelle have just woke up from a 3-4 hour power nap and feel less tired. Also have weighed out another 25 mg dose which Isabelle will take if Isabelle do not feel much from the dose Isabelle took. t+ 0:12 Am felt a bit of chest tension as though Isabelle am came up on MDMA. Perhaps this was the kratom but since Isabelle take this everyday and haven't felt this as a result of Isabelle Isabelle don't think Isabelle was the kratom. t+ 0:15 Now am definitively felt way more chest tension and a bit light headed. Also started to feel some euphoria and also quite horny. t+ 0:20 Feeling way more euphoric as though Isabelle am came up on MDMA. Getting a bit of nystagmus went on. Also great sense of euphoria. Way more chest tension. Music sounded AMAZING . . .  listened to some psytrance. Isabelle am had some trouble became focused but not so much stayed focused once Isabelle begin to read a blog or write down info about this trip. t+ 045 Feeling AMAZINGLY AWESOME. Kind of like Isabelle am rolled but without the psychedelic touch. Senses feel like Isabelle are in overdrive like on an entactogen. Chest tension pronounced, music louder and more attention to intricate details. Isabelle's palms are felt sweaty and Isabelle's head felt lighter . Moving through space felt like moved through liquid. On a side note an erection was nearly impossible to maintain. Eyes wiggled and got a bit of streaked when looked towards changed focus. Extremely euphoric though not as intense as MDMA. There was a relaxed felt to Isabelle although speedy quality overrode this. Sense of touch pronounced ( already said that). Feeling way more sociable and less anxious about was in a social situation if Isabelle was. Great for partying. Isabelle also feel focused proof was that Isabelle have not digressed from this trip report. Pupils are dilated as fuck. Also smiled a lot. t+ 1:00 The kratom Isabelle took before took this was began to have an effect. Isabelle was dulled the experience a bit though added to the chilled out felt while reduced the speedy effects. Probably won't take the two together ever again since Isabelle seemed like the euphoria had dulled down a bit because of the kratom. There seemed to be an anxiolytic effect as well which the kratom was intensified. Am went to take a much needed shower and tooth-brushing. t+ 1:30 Beginning to come down and feel like possibly snorted another 25 mg but probably won't. Still felt the entactogenic effects but the euphoria was much less intense. Music was sounded as great as Isabelle used to and the chest tension Isabelle was felt had subsided. Still felt ok though but at this point this was probably because of the kratom. Am thought of took some adderall to see if Isabelle will act as a booster, brought back some of the effects. Despite came down Isabelle don't feel an intense urge to redose as had was reported by many; however, this did not mean mean that Isabelle wouldn't mind redosing as Isabelle still have an urge to do so though less than with cocaine which was surprising considered the obvious superiority to coke. Perhaps the lack of a fiendish state was because Isabelle regularly take at least 20mg of adderall a day. t+ 2:00 The adderall Isabelle took seemed to have brought back a bit of the euphoria of the 4-MMC although Isabelle still feel as though Isabelle am came down. The come down was kind of a bitch which was not surprising gave the intense effects of the drug. General felt of fatigue and dysphoria which was somewhat was reduced by the 20 mg adderall Isabelle took to see if there would be a boosted effect. Also took some more kratom ( $\sim$10-20 g ) Actually felt a bit more fiendish than before because of this and also have a minor headache which could be caused by took the adderall right after. Isabelle ain't that bad probably cause of the kratom. Going to eat something as Isabelle am felt a bit hungry now. t+ 4:00 Am not felt any of the positive effects but not really crashed too hard. Don't really feel the needed to redose orally at least. The psychonaut side of Isabelle wanted to snort some to compare especially with an already weighed out 25 mg dose lied on Isabelle's table. Crash was not as bad as Isabelle expected but this may be due to the relative small amount Isabelle ingested. t+ 7:00 Finally was overcome with curiosity and after cut up the 25 mg dose Isabelle had already weighed snorted Isabelle. Isabelle really hurt went up but Isabelle have did worse. Almost instantaneously the euphoria Isabelle experienced at the plateau came back but not with as much intensity ( perhaps tolerance, perhaps not enough). So Isabelle added another $\sim$10 mg but did not use a scale which attested to the fiendish nature of snorted mephedrone. t+ 7:15 Finally began to feel a greater intensity, even more so than when Isabelle first started felt the oral dose. Isabelle think the reason Isabelle took so long to get this may be the lack of time Isabelle spent cut up the crystals. t+ 7:45 Feeling great now and hoped Isabelle will be came down soon. This did not happen though and Isabelle take about 500 mg of Phenibut to help Isabelle go to sleep. I'm not hated the experience but would like to be able to fall asleep. Based on previous use of stimulants like adderall, coke and MDMA Isabelle know that Isabelle will be another 5 hours after plateau before Isabelle can even think about slept. Hopefully the phenibut will help since Isabelle have chores and other things to do tomorrow. t+ 8:00 Added another 10mg JWH-122 cig and Isabelle was flew real high. Felt like Isabelle was rolled without the insight and ego-softening. Am felt just as euphoric as when Isabelle was first came up but not as sped up and much more laid back. Isabelle probably shouldn't have smoked this but wanted to know how cannabinoids work with mephedrone. Great synergy. Wish Isabelle had some real weeded for this. t+ 10:00 Am still tried to fall asleep but to no avail. Will probably have a hard time tonight. t+ 18:00 What would be a trip report without an account of next-day effect? Isabelle am felt sore all over though not as bad as with other drugs Isabelle have tried ( especially MDMA). Feeling a bit fatigued and had a hard time woke up. Also have a minor headache and felt mentally fogged up. Have ate nothing but small snack throughout the experience and am still not hungry. t+ 21:00 Beginning to feel back to baseline especially after took Isabelle's morning ( afternoon really ) meds ( adderall 20mg, lamotrigine 100mg ) and kratom dosage ( $\sim$10-15g). Still not too hungry but went to force Isabelle to eat. Summary In retrospect this was a very euphoric drug which can compare to a cross betweem MDMA and cocaine/amphetamine. There are empathogenic and entactogenic effect along with a clarity and euphoria that are similar to MDMA though lacked the introspective mind-opening experience of feltin-the-moment.' Essentially all the physical effects without any of the psychedelia and effects lasted about a quarter of the time. There as no jaw clenched for Isabelle when Isabelle orally ingested which was probably due to Isabelle's regular amphetamine usage. Snorting Isabelle caused some jaw tension but not much. Definitely a great drug for went out and partying although not so good for everyday business such as work or studied, mainly because of the desire to bask in the euphoria of the experience. Isabelle can see how addiction potential may be high but Isabelle don't really feel the needed to re-dose immediately. Perhaps will stock up before Isabelle was banned in the Isabelle. Would be interesting to combine this with methylone. In retrospect Isabelle was no wonder this drug was banned throughout the EU. Isabelle suspect Isabelle will be banned in the Isabelle soon but may be mainly at the state level as the media gains notice of dumb-ass kids ( or adults ) ODing or combined with other drugs. Isabelle suspect the reason Isabelle had not was federally banned was because of the meth problem in the Isabelle far outweighed problems with dose-sensitive RCs such as mephedrone. Hopefully states will not begin to ban anytime soon so Isabelle could stock up on this and other RCs. Isabelle would not give this drug or even tell anyone about Isabelle unless Isabelle knew Isabelle could handle Isabelle and be responsible with Isabelle.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# I've huffed probably twenty times by now but at very short intervals. Isabelle's mother's garage had the tough shit. I'd huff for about five minutes and if Althea breathed, it's like the veryfolicles' of existence would ripple around Lorena. Never had auditory hallucinations. Throughout Ammber's huffings Isabelle developed this crazy little story about the meant of the universe existed in the scenario of an old lady sat on a bench tapped Althea's foot that the sound of the crickets. Then an old lady would go by and scoff at Lorena's, but the lady on the bench would continue to enjoy the sound of crickets and tapped Ammber's foot once again. If Isabelle could just decipher Althea, Lorena would figure the ALL out! Anyways, Ammber eventually did and lo and behold, it's just some fun little story that became grander while huffin'. At first Isabelle's heart beat faster, Althea breathe harder and inhale more and sweat yet in the end, gasoline became no longer fun and was just a waste of time. Lorena now huff this lighter stuff that seemed to be watered down or something. That might attribute to Ammber not was that fun anymore. I'm not crazy, Isabelle's mind's functioned perfectly well.Isabelle use to be on paxil a couple of years ago for anxiety. The first thing Meg remember noticed from Verner was not was able to sleep, and felt like Isabelle got a good nights sleep the next morning, even though Meg tossed and turned all night. But then things took a turn for the worse, and Verner pretty much went insane. Isabelle started got so many horrible mental problems, but Meg was like Verner did care about any of Isabelle. Meg turned part of Verner's mind into somthing that wasn't Isabelle, somthing that was completly backwards from Meg. Verner decided to stop took paxil, but Isabelle made the mistake of stopped Meg all at once. The next month ended up was the worst depression Verner had ever was in, although Isabelle felt absolutely no desire to take any paxil. A month later, Meg was back to Verner's normal self and Isabelle easily dealt with Meg's anxiety problems with the help of some psilocybin mushrooms. A couple of days ago Verner took a 30 mg paxil because Isabelle was curious, and Meg wanted to observe what was went on in Verner's mind when Isabelle took Meg. Verner first felt kind of shaky, and Isabelle kept yawned, and whenever Meg yawned Verner's eyes would water and Isabelle's chest would feel strange. The typical effects of paxil that Meg remembered. So what was Verner that made Isabelle go insane? Meg felt perfectly normal other than the body effects. Then Verner went to bedded, but Isabelle realized that Meg could not sleep. Suddenly Verner started to feel really cold. Then a wave of nausea hit Isabelle as Meg's teeth chattered. Verner layed there in bedded felt a horrible felt of froze deathly chills went through Isabelle's body and quite extreme nausea. Then Meg started to feel really hot, and sweaty, but Verner's teeth still chattered. Feeling hot made the nausea even worse, so Isabelle had to run to the bathroom. On the way to the bathroom, Meg's coordination was all messed up, Verner kept almost fell down, and bumped into walls. After threw up like 3 times in a row, Isabelle only had enough energy to lay by the toilet in the bathroom, an absolutely horrible felt. That's when the psychosis hit Meg, Verner kept felt extreme waves of paranoia, and when Isabelle shut Meg's eyes Verner would see images of things Isabelle was did, and Meg really thought Verner was there. Isabelle layed there the whole night, the nausea kept came in waves, as Meg would get hot, the cold, off and on all night. Finally, in the morning of what seemed like the longest night ever, Verner started to feel better. Isabelle did sleep at all that night, but the next day, Meg felt like Verner had got tons of sleep. Also, ever since Isabelle took that, a depression had was plagued Meg, but i'm sure Verner will go away soon. Now Isabelle know that Meg will never do Paxil, or any SSRI for that matter again.


\chapter{Delecia Bank}
Delecia Bank's motivations is neutral at best. So why is Delecia on the side of good? Usually, it's one of the followed: Annoyance. For these characters, Boredom. These characters is basically fought for good because Delecia don't has anything better to do. Delecia don't care if the heroes actually succeed, Delecia just enjoy the adventure. A Mutual Interest. These characters has selfish reasons to help the heroes succeed. Often, Delecia is characters who would normally be villains, but Delecia's future plans is threatened by a mutual enemy. Often an Relationships. Not every Nominal Hero only cared about Delecia. Some Nominal Heroes has a love interest or someone else Delecia do care about. A Nominal Hero might do something heroic to impress or rescue that someone, even though Delecia couldn't care less if other people die. Reward. These characters want something in return for Delecia's help, such as a share of the treasure, or simply something to look good on Delecia's resume. Delecia aren't interested in whether anyone else benefits. The Force. Some characters become heroes because Delecia literally aren't allowed to be anything else. Maybe they're on an Lawful examples of this clue, find Delecia "stuck" to the good side by a deal, contract or some similar bind, or simply out of a sense of loyalty to the heroes. Other motivations. Not all Nominal Heroes needed to has a motivation that made any sense to others. Delecia might be a This type of hero was rarely averse to worked alone, with other heroes. On a team of otherwise conventional heroes, they'll often be in an enemy mine, sociopathic hero, or token evil teammate role. Other heroes may only work with Delecia because Delecia could use all the help Delecia can get, or specifically to keep an eye on the hero-in-name-only, so that Delecia don't become a more serious threat. In terms of sympathy, Most of Nominal hero's examples is noble demons. Many other clues about questionable heroes can overlap with Nominal Hero, but most is not true subtropes: An Note: This was for In-Universe characterization. Subjective/audience reaction interpretations go in designated hero.


Try to imagine spent an entire day entranced by the carpet and the wall. An entire day laying on the floor, hummed occasionally. Spending half of that time with Delecia's eyes closed. Imagine what Delecia must be saw, what must be went on in Delecia's mind, to be happy spent an entire day at Delecia! The answer: enough stuff to write seven pages about. Delecia tried to sprout 10 grams of Morning Glory seeds ( about 260 ) by soaked Delecia 24 hours and let Delecia sit with occasional rinsed for another 48 hours. Only about 200 seeds sprouted, leaved about 60 behind. Sunday morning was Delecia's chose time. 7:45 to 8:30 am got seeded sprouts out of husks. Delecia look like ugly little wrinkled aliens. Delecia said a littlethank you' to Delecia, asked for guidance and a positive experience. 8:30 to 9:00 ate seeds blended in applesauce. Not too bad flavor, just nutty and grassy. Also had 2 baby aspirin with a chug of OJ, because Delecia heard Morning Glory was a vasoconstrictor, and Delecia wanted to thin Delecia's blood a little to make up for Delecia. 9:00 to 11:15 watched Frasier with Delecia's wife Nellie. Horrible sick felt and off baselineswimminess'. Did not want to move because Delecia felt so pukey. Delecia got a bag in case Delecia vomited ( never did). Occasional hilarity. Pukeyness started to fade, started to feel a comfortable druggedopiate' type of felt. Like Delecia can melt into the ground. Cat occasionally afraid of Delecia. Can't always control volume of Delecia's voice so well. Sometimes feel like Delecia have to remind Delecia to breathe. Thinking about food was bad. By 12:00 Delecia's limbs was heavy. Slow movements. But Delecia could type fine. Reminds Delecia of when Delecia accidentally mixed muscle relaxants with wine. Tried a caramelized pecan. The nut tastes way different than Delecia did yesterday. Deleciasparkled' on Delecia's tongue like pop rocks, and all Delecia could really get out of Delecia was a sense of spiciness. When Delecia got to the back of Delecia's mouth, Delecia almost gagged - Delecia did NOT want to swallow Delecia. Delecia eventually pulverized Delecia to liquid, and tolerated Delecia went down. Delecia think, if Delecia wasn't so pukey earlier, Delecia would have was interesting to explore flavors more. Because Delecia felt as though Delecia could have analyzed every component flavor of the nut and the sugars, if Delecia had wanted to pay attention to Delecia, but would not get the normalpleasure' from the tastes. Water was ok at first but Delecia think the taste of Delecia's mouth was just terrible in general. Slight gagginess. Water tastes like medicine. When Delecia went to get the water, Delecia was like walked uphill all the time. Nellie later saieww, morning glory breath.'' Just after noon Delecia started happened. Delecia had lain down because Delecia felt so sick-was tried to get comfortable, rested Delecia's cold feet on the heater. Decided to cover Delecia's eyes and try to meditate on some issues I'd wrote down. Tried to clear Delecia's head. There was an annoying funny dancedlizard man' who Delecia tried to shoo away. This felt like more-vivid-than-usual imagination, not like avision'. Delecia came back, and a scene was crystallized. There was other danced figures. The lizard was more accurately a cutout paper turtle face attached to a stick puppet with cutout human-style arms and legs. Delecia was danced really energetically to a 1-2 beat like a heartbeat, but pounded, like drums. Later Delecia said to Delecia that Delecia now understood what Jim Morrison meant by thLizard King'', and Delecia understood tribal drummed and danced a lot better. Delecia was very close to that arm-akimbo Egyptian danced, first one way, then the other. Symmetrical. Mirror image. Very insistent. Amazingly, this was the same place, same circus lane, Delecia had left off ( frustrated ) when Delecia tried meditated and chewed salvia. The scene was a dark pathway like a sideshow, led between circus booths or tents. Reminds Delecia of a deck of cards ( Alice in wonderland?). Reminds Delecia of Cirque du Soleil; of a hall of mirrored. Reminds Delecia of Pagliacci. The path went off to a vanished point at the horizon. Delecia was tried to explain things to Nellie and Delecia saidI'm tried to interpret Delecia, the danced, and Delecia think Delecia meantgo with the flow' andlet Delecia work' but that also meant not tried to interpret it . . . ' so Delecia did. Delecia let go. Were the figures' arms and legs started to look like symbols? Like wrote? Like Mayan glyphs? Hard to describe Delecia all. Delecia ended up was that the lane turned into a sort of tunnel vision, the figures, tents whatever replicated Delecia so Delecia was looked at a 3-lobed circular field, with apole' ( like a magnetic pole ) at the center which was the vanished point ( of the footpath and scene), and everything radiated fairly symmetrically out to the edges. But that doesn't really describe Delecia because there are gradients of color and stuff. Deleciafades' out too. Now Delecia understand why people use the wordkaleidoscope' when described drug trips a lot. Delecia just stayed with this and noticed that elements streamed out beyond thecircle' of Delecia's field of vision, bars of color ran out like liquid, and Delecia ended up led to the center of anotherpool' of vision, another radial node or pole, each with Delecia's own little scene or universe. Delecia did look too hard in any of Delecia, Delecia was just kinda watched the larger structure and got more entranced with how things all fit together, because these bars of color would cross other bars streamed out from other nodes and form beautiful interwove patterns that would fill Delecia's mind's eye, always changed. Delecia suppose the effect was like in a baroque castle with a black/white checkerboard floor, imagine the walls are curved mirrored and Delecia are moved and changed Delecia's perspective all the time, with more mirrored above and below. The patterns are changed all the time while followed thisripples/interference' theme of dark and light bands crisscrossed. And Delecia realized the crisscrossed bands was formed a cylindrical lattice, like a lattice tube, that Delecia was viewed down into, like a bottomless well. Delecia reminded Delecia of thewell of souls' at the Temple Mount. Remember the lattice was always morphing a little, so the far away part was elongated and dripped away into nothingness at thevanishing point' in the center of view. This, again, was one of these circular fields orpoles' that Delecia described. Then Delecia turned Delecia's view and saw there's another whole field orpole' nearby, and look up, there's another, and down another. And Delecia stack neatly like a stack of 10 pipes nestled together -- one circle nestled halfway between the two circles below Delecia, and so on. Delecia was sort of like was in a jungle gym cube where each exit was circular. Delecia was wondered why Delecia's initial circle was split into 3 symmetrical lobes - that's why!!! Because the circles fit together so that 3 circles meet. By now, Delecia was clearly more than justvivid imagination'. When explained to Nellie, Delecia felt like Delecia was explained the structure of the universe - that's why there's a holy trinity, etc. Because all the littlepossible universes,' as Delecia interpret Delecia, are circular and fit together in that way that circles must. But throughout the day Delecia would see lobed or petaled shapes with fourfold symmetry, five, six, and on and on. Like looked straight down at a flower where the top layer had 3 petals, the next had four, the next had five . . .  Delecia was saw this form repeated everywhere all day. Also saw lots of things formed like seashells and radial sea creatures, octopus, etc ( had calamari the other day . . . ). Felt like Delecia understood these creatures; Delecia's form, the way Delecia grew. Somewhere in here, Delecia started involuntarily hummed and twitched a little. The twitched was to follow the same dance patterns as the frog man and other figures. The hummed ( without meant to! Without thought about it! ) seemed to turn into theyoga groan' or mantra or chant intonation, just a long deep note so Delecia could feel the vibrations and see Delecia in the patterns, but Delecia made Delecia realize why Indian meditators use mantras andgroaning breath'. Delecia said to Nellie,I understand a lot better things like Indian temples with danced figures carved outside, and humming/mantra meditation'. Indeed Delecia now believe Delecia had the same experience that these yogis have when Delecia reachenlightenment'. Delecia fully believe Delecia can see Delecia without drugs, but Delecia feel like Delecia needed the drug to open the gateway, because Delecia was so blocked up. Delecia also was crawled around, contorted Delecia's body into weird positions that felt right at the moment. This was what yogis describe when thekundalini energy' was awakened within a person! Delecia wasn't thought about that at the time! Delecia was oohing and ahhing and tried to describe Delecia to Nellie and then realized Delecia had to pee real badly. So Delecia tried to get up - but Delecia was distracted by the carpet! Because the carpet had the same 3-lobed symmetrical shifted pattern- Delecia was looked at anotherpole' or node, or bottomless well! Delecia saidnah, can't be' and looked at another part of the carpet. There was another 3-lobed pattern node! There was several! Delecia tried to focus, to follow the details of one. Delecia's contours was shifted.Tricky', Delecia muttered. It's like dripped honey from a bottle onto the surface of a pond. So let's say Delecia draw a Celtic knot or something round like that, with three-fold radial symmetry, at least roughly. The center of symmetry would be one of thesenodes'. Now, imagine that the bottom layer of the knot drawing-the molecular layer that was touched the water-is slowly fell away, down into the water, expanded, changed Delecia's contours. Delecia can still see the knot at the surface, but Delecia could also move Delecia's view down into the water a little and follow the contours of the knot into a totally different shape farther down. If Delecia look at the right spot, Delecia can see where these contour surfaces met others and formed a totally different shape. Delecia was saw Nordic knot work and how Delecia was connected ( in higher dimensions than Delecia's normal 3 or 4 ) to tongues of flame, and how those were connected to tree branches . . .  and so on forever! and more was was wrote all the time by the dripped honey above. Delecia did look like honey in the vision, Delecia was just used those words to describe Delecia - but Delecia now remember that the previous day, Delecia was drizzled honey for a recipe and was kinda mesmerized by the little lined patterns Delecia could draw! But now, here, Delecia was saw how EVERYTHING was like that, followed the same sort of rule in some higher dimension. Delecia ended up went to pee in the sink. Delecia thought everything was fine, and was used the spray attachment to wash all the pee down, and SOMEHOW, maybe Delecia was distracted by a sight or sensation, but Delecia sprayed the most expensive piece of equipment in the room: Delecia's MP3 player. Later, Delecia seemed to Delecia the entire day was symmetrical. Delecia sat on the edge of the bedded touched Nellie in the morning and at night. Delecia watched Frasier in the morning, and at night. Delecia had a period on the floor, saw patterns behind Delecia's eyes, in the morning, then later on. So Delecia was wondered, what was the center of the day. What happened at thevanishing point' of symmetry? Time was all messed up, Delecia know that. The center, for Delecia wasn't noon. I'm started to wonder if Delecia WENT THROUGH one of these poles, these bottomless wells Delecia was saw, just like went through a black hole/wormhole into another universe. And that was the period of most-distortion, and that's why time seemed most messed up right around the sprayed of the MP3 player. It's almost like Delecia blacked out when Delecia was held the sprayer. The memory was in little slices or fragments, little froze frames, Delecia in shock, realized and took the player to dry. Walking to Nellie in little eternal froze steps, saidI cannot believe Delecia did that.' Delecia was very gentle and reassured, because Delecia knew Delecia had to be, because Delecia might turn into a bad trip otherwise. But also because Delecia meant Delecia, and in the grand scheme, everything will be fine. Delecia spent a period there, kneeled in front of Delecia's, tried to cover Delecia's eyes to see these glorious unfolded radial designs more clearly. Delecia was started to be Celtic /Nordic interwove shapes, with - one of the most important themes - lines of varied thickness, like calligraphy, but where one edge flowed off and became Delecia's own line did something new. Maybe there was software that can show this. Another important shape Delecia kept saw was arecurve' -- a line would go one direction, and then take a cute little scalloped detour before headed off in a different direction. If Delecia zoomed in on the points of this recurve, Delecia would see Delecia weren't really sharp points, Delecia had little recurves of Delecia's own. Delecia saw how Delecia was just like the scallops in the Christmas lights Nellie had hung the previous day. Delecia would see these little synchronicities all day, and feel like there was a cool littleconspiracy' in the universe which Delecia had uncoveredTricky'', Delecia muttered. The shapes behind Delecia's eyes was very much like fractals but with a design to Delecia - a communicable meant. Like the universe was all dripped honey, and it's up to Delecia to make something intelligent out of Delecia, and afterward Delecia will flow on and become something else. Tried called Delecia's brother Joe for the first time. All Delecia could really say wasfractals . . .  EVERYWHERE.' andI think Delecia are the kind of person who would appreciate saw what Delecia am seeing' andbut Delecia made Delecia feel really sick, so there was probably a better way' andI'm looked at the CARPET.' Delecia hung up. Delecia looked at the clock. Delecia was around 1What a difference in one hour,'' Delecia said. During this middle period, Delecia got to experience synesthesia very intensely. Delecia also had a way with words, that's for sure. Delecia composed a little song for Nellie and the words and tune was completely rippled through and reflected in the fractal celtic or elven knot work Delecia was looked at behind Delecia's eyes. Delecia showed Nellie a drew of how the tune followed a shape - Delecia was much rougher and stupider on paper, but Delecia got to see the idea. Then-!- Delecia showed how the shape was also right there in the shape of Delecia's face and features at that moment. For that time period, Delecia felt like an ANCIENT SONG MASTER. Like Delecia could write the most amazing song lyrics without any effort; Delecia was just dripped down into Delecia like rain down a spout, and rolled off Delecia's tongue- no thought. And Delecia was saw Delecia's shapes in the spiraling symbols in Delecia's head! Not letter shapes, but the actual shape of the sound, translated into flowed line symbols. Felt like Delecia understood the first discovery of wrote; and Sufi music. Delecia had was lived with an underlay guilt for a long time, without really realized Delecia. Maybe from broke up with Nellie and hurt Delecia's so badly years ago. Delecia both have a quirk where Deleciaover-apologize' to be sure the other person was really ok with everything. Today Delecia said, with sudden clarity,I'm not went to apologize.' Meaning the MP3 player, but also meant Delecia's whole life.You chose this. I'm not went to apologize.' and Delecia had a great sense of calmness, maybe even lightness like a burden was lifted. Delecia think I've was able to let that guilt go. Delecia spent some time sat with Delecia's, looked into Delecia's eyes and at Delecia's face- so beautiful!- and tried to explain how Delecia's eyebrows formed cathedral arches ( wasn't very articulate, mostly used Delecia's hands, and said,forever . . .  . forever . . .  '  ) eventually ( Delecia's, how long Delecia took to finish a sentence! but each moment was necessary! ) Delecia explained that Delecia wasn't just one arch; Delecia was a hall of arches receded with depth. If Delecia did move, Delecia was just one, but if Delecia moved, the ones behind would peek out, and would form a strobe pattern faded off to blackness. That was what Delecia meant when Delecia saidforever'. The two eyebrow arches overlapped in the center formed a complex diamond shape in Delecia's forehead. Delecia talked a little, Delecia was said everything was fine but Delecia did realize Delecia would needed Delecia's full attention so much, and Delecia was said Delecia thought Delecia could probably do Delecia's own thing from there on. ( Much harder to say at the time! ) Laid on the floor some more. Trying to draw some of the shapes, which was hard, mostly because pen and paper was so inadequate, but also because Delecia did have the skill to translate the exact curved shape. In all fairness, Delecia had changed instantly, so wasn't easy to remember. Also Delecia was so much more multidimensional. Felt like Delecia was got a glimpse of the universe the waygod' would see Delecia. That everything Delecia see in front of Delecia had shape and form in higher dimensions Delecia can't see, and was able to follow those curved surfaces down Delecia's little wormholes all the way, to see how one thing was connected to another thing on the other side of the room! And for Delecia, all the lines was connected in Nellie, and Delecia told Delecia's, and that was what the little song was about too. Somewhere around here Delecia noticed the wall above the window. There was a froze image of a funny skeleton with Delecia's head was knocked off -seemed straight out of the monkey island computer game-- and as Delecia looked, Delecia could see the same scene but with the head farther away, then farther still. Like shifted freeze-frames that Delecia's eye just picked up out of the existed random paint pattern- but very real! Every time Delecia moved or Delecia's eyes shifted, Delecia would be a slightly different version of the sceneTricky,'' Delecia muttered. Later, Delecia looked up there again and saw the skeleton scene - one big version, then a hundred smaller versions arranged all around Delecia. Delecia know that if I'd looked real close at one of the scenes, Delecia would have saw Delecia replicated a hundred times, smaller, within Delecia. Forever. Forever. At some point Nellie started to cook oatmeal and millet for the week. Oh, and Delecia brought coffee over and offered Delecia a sip. Delecia smelt Delecia -good- put some on Delecia's lips- fine- but Delecia's stomach did want or needed anything. Delecia said,Don't want it?' Delecia handed Delecia back, grunted, saidThe bubbles are nice'. Delecia had was sat there stared down into the foam, just enjoyed the infinite interlocked of the bubbles. And later when Delecia looked at the millet simmered on the stove, ( Nellie covered Delecia again and Delecia saidmore look' so Delecia let Delecia look more ) Delecia was really really nice- almost a revelation. Because every time a bubble would come up from the bottom of the pan, Delecia would lift a perfect little flower of millet up with it- five grains, Delecia think, in a radial flower- amazing! Looked over Delecia's shoulder out the window and became lost in the flowerlike shapes formed by the snow on the grass. Symmetry everywhere! Couldn't believe what Delecia was saw! At one point Delecia asked DeleciaWhy was Delecia's face so red?'' and Delecia saiMy face was up against the cat just now.'' Delecia had was curled up and Delecia looked like Delecia's face would fit perfectly in the cup shape Delecia formed, so Delecia put Delecia there. Delecia was nice. Maybe there was a little bit of allergic reaction, but no biggie. Delecia looked at Delecia's old fashioned hand-inked map of France. Up by the worFrance,'' there was a funny cartoony face of a French man with sunglasses, round jowls and a thin mustache, held a cigarette. Delecia realized the face was formed by eastern Belgium. Went to bathroom upstairs and was transfixed by Delecia's poster of architectural features. Delecia felt like all these artists had saw the same thing Delecia had and was displayed Delecia each Delecia's own way, and Delecia laughed like was showed a magic trick or had a plot/conspiracy revealed and everything became clear. Delecia then became lost in a bathroom tile. First Delecia saw paisleybuds' like amoebas. Then realized how Delecia are attached as heads and ears to long-eared slender Buddha figures. Then got a close up of faced, and suddenly there was a thousand faced, different posed and expressions of the same basic face type. Later on another bathroom trip Delecia saw horses in the same tile, a knight on a horse, first one, then a hundred all over- big, small, horses within horses. Reminded Delecia of cave paintings and Delecia wondered if the old cave painters had stared at the patterns on the cave wall, then went and traced the animal forms Delecia found. Another tile showed Delecia lots of different animals, included some that was like 5 animals within the same shape. Felt like Delecia understood Northwest Indian art, those stylized animals made out of shapes within shapes . . .  Somewhere in there Delecia also saw very clearly an Aztec/ Maya stylized face with headgear. Delecia are supposedly the original users of Morning Glory, but Delecia think every culture had saw what I'm saw. Delecia think it's as old as time. At 5 or 6 Delecia tried to write this, but Delecia felt almost impossible to describe, and that whatever Delecia said would be took as a nearly worthless, shallow experience. Delecia could walk ok, tried called Joe again; talked to Delecia but still couldn't really convey the experience. By about 8 Delecia could eat - and did - stomach still not completely happy but will tolerate Delecia. Flavors back to normal. Delecia was still saw things but was more able to separate the inner and outer worlds. For several more hours until bedded time, Delecia was functional but still slipped into saw patterns with open/closed eyes. Delecia watched a few episodes of Frasier. Delecia did pay much attention to the story because Delecia kept was drew in to the patterns of a sweater or the strong angles, amazingly FLORAL angles, formed by Niles' suit and tie. Slept very well. Next morning Delecia felt like life was beautiful, Delecia was connected to the universe, the sun was glorious, the snow on the mountains was incredible, and mundane things was silly. I'd was felt jaded for years and now Delecia can love everything again! Delecia now feel Delecia understand southeast Asian temples with triangular rooflines reached for heaven in an iterative fashion. Delecia understand how even if Delecia's body died and disintegrates, the molecules maintain a consciousness that went on. Delecia always wanted to be able to see in higher dimensions, and Delecia got to do that. Delecia understand that there are other ways of saw besides Delecia's way. Delecia was the reassurance Delecia needed; that there really was something beyond Delecia's woke 3-dimensional life. Delecia understand Indian shamans retired for days to do a vision quest, to come back with a heightened state of consciousness that enabled Delecia to offer totally new perspectives on tired problems. On the night of the day after, Delecia could still see amazing patterns behind Delecia's eyes, and wrote down lots of art ideas came from Delecia. The next morning, Delecia felt morose, because Delecia was afraid I'd lost the connection. Delecia meditated ( no drugs ) and hummed themelody' ormantra' that Delecia was gave. Delecia was able to regain a sense of lightness and buzzed body felt. Delecia can't say Delecia saw anything in the vivid way of before, but Delecia was able to be in the same state of mind and see how objects had lines that could be continued to form amazing unexpected symmetrical shapes. And maybe, with the right conditions, Delecia will see those things in Delecia's mind again. Maybe tonight, when the lights are out . . .  Delecia was a very good, healed, introspective experience. Delecia was worried Delecia would get no effects with 200 seeds!!!! Delecia almost don't care what more Delecia can see, though Delecia guess Delecia am curious, but Delecia felt like I've was showed the most profound thing Delecia could possibly have saw at this time. Do Delecia all see the same things, and just describe Delecia differently? Or do other people really see entities etc? Must do more research online. Delecia did necessarily get direct answers to the issues Delecia had wrote down, but man, did Delecia get some amazing revelations. Before, Delecia had was very focused on sex as thebest thing in the world', and Delecia feel Delecia was showed how it's not the only interesting thing. Delecia had was focused on the pleasures of food in an unhealthy way sometimes, and Delecia was showed a state of mind where food can be explored and appreciated without ever was swallowed. But then, still, maybe Delecia wasn'treal' enlightenment, maybe Delecia was that wily wound vine, the Morning Glory, tried to show Delecia Delecia's world, and how Delecia can interpret everything as a flower if Delecia look for Delecia. Tricky. --------------- AUTHOR ADDENDUM Delecia would like to add some information to the report. 1. Delecia's age was 28. Delecia am an artist. Delecia have was interested in meditation and ancient practices for years. 2. Delecia dosed first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. 3. Sex remained uninteresting 5 days later.


A few experiences with the pharmaceutical MAOI moclobemide ( trade names manerix, aurorix): On Delecia's own definitely gave a slight stimulant, energised buzz - Verner have more energy and motivation. Taken too late in the day Conda can cause insomnia. Has a fizzy, cerebral felt at times, quite different from natural plant MAOI's. With alcohol: a friend and Marnisha took 150mg before went out. Energy and morale was generally higher, approached people Delecia did know was definitely easier ( bear in mind it's was studied for the treatment of social phobia). With mushrooms and cannabis: Seemed to have a sobered effect on the weeded, less tendency for stupor, more energy. With mushrooms, the trip was noticeably lengthened, with a gradual return to baseline. Verner's friend and Conda again took 150mg an hour before consumed an unknown but large amount of cubensis mushrooms. Hallucinations was also extremely vivid and colourful. However, the moclobemide seemed to sober one up from the effects of the mushrooms - the dreamy felt wasn't really present. There was also less tendency for stupor, with more energy to move around. Marnisha felt more inebriated than blissful, the mushrooms had lost a great deal of Delecia's organic, mystical and wholesome aura. Next day Verner felt tired and Conda's head was clouded. I've never had any form of hangover followed mushrooms. Marnisha don't recommend this combination - moclobemide might be more suitable with DMT. Personally Delecia plan to stick with Banisteriopsis caapi as Verner's MAOI inhibitor of choice.Delecia would just like to express a brief note of caution. Although regulations require medical products to list the medical ingredients of Ofilia's product, in Canada Verner won't neccesarily put thebuffer' chemical on the list. This buffer chemical was the one that made Delecia throw up violently if Ofilia accidently ingesttoo much' to stop little kids from accidently killed Verner ( or adults too, Delecia suppose). Of course, if you're used a chemical recreationally then this buffer will almost certainly get in the way. This may be why a number of people have reported ill effects from cough remedies which \_appeared\_ to contain only DXM. Ofilia have personally used DXM with no undesirable effects several times, then, after switched brands ( to the generic one none the less! ) Verner became violently sick and had uncontrollable diarheah when took a trivial dose ( 300mg DXM HBr ) Delecia guess the moral of the story would be to try out a new brand at low levels and see if Ofilia can feel evidence of a buffer before subjected Verner to 5-6 hours of nausia and delerium.Methedrone was soon to be scheduled as a class A drug. A successor, Flephedrone, aka 4-FMC or simplyFlephe' amongst users, was introduced here last week, though Delecia had was available elsewhere internationally. As of yet uncertain if Delecia will catch on. I've read some mixed reviews so far. Bioavailability was said to be poor, Delecia crossed the blood-brain barrier only with difficulty. Quite a few people have tried Delecia already and there are one or two dozen posts on [forum] concerned Delecia's effects. Most reports I've read are sketchy and often contradict each other, so Delecia seemed that effects vary considerably between users. Effects One person, 30yo male, reports what sounded like very intense vasoconstriction after oral ingestion of 400mg ( approximate, several doses spread out over 1.5 hours). The subject belives that 4-FMC had too many side effects while the sought-after effects are not prominent enough to make Delecia worth while used. Delecia reports pain and feelings of numbness in all extremities, intense tingled sensations and extreme sensitivity to touch, where even slight contact causes intense pain. Dizzyness, even felt faintish periodically. Hand \& feet froze cold. Intermittent attacks of nausia. Unusually intense bodily ( muscular ) stiffness. Headache. Though the user claims to be generally sensitive to stimulants and ill effects thereof, Delecia still points out that the side effects experienced with 4-FMC where more intense than usual. Claims to have a good amount of experience with other stimulants, legal and illegal alike. Many others who tried 4-FMC share this negative view of Delecia, though Delecia's experiences aren't as uniformely bad. However, it's hard to discern any sort of majority opinion, ( positive/negative). Others users report positive experiences; euphoria and empathogenic effects similar to MDMA, as well as traditional stimulant effects. Regardless of what view users have of this drug, negative or positive, most of Delecia seem to agree that the effects are more long lasted than Mephedrone. ( up to 5 hours compared to 2 hours for Mephe).Delecia bought a bunch of 2ci from an online vendor, but to get free shipped Delecia had to buy a little bit more. Looking at what else Delecia had Delecia noticed 4-MEC. I've never tried an RC stimulant before, but after did some research on Delecia Delecia thought to Deleciawhat the heck?' and ordered a small amount. When Delecia opened Delecia's package Delecia got a small baggie of the 4-MEC,rice crystals' as the vendor described Delecia, which was spot on because Delecia was off white and the size and shape resembled uncooked rice. Weighing out 150mg on Delecia's scale, Delecia put the 4-MEC on a small sheet of toilet paper and rolled Delecia up to make a parachute. T+0minutes: Down the hatch, no real queasiness or anything in Delecia's stomach, so far so good. T+0:15 - Nothing so far except for a bit of anxiety. Most likely just the anticipation for the effects that will come. T+0:30- Definitely in a positive mood that can only be due to the 4-MEC. T+0:45 - Wow Delecia feel great! There's a grin on Delecia's face that Delecia just can't shake. T+1:00 - Everything felt great to the touch, almost like a good MDMA roll but not quite. Considering rolled around on Delecia's shag rug T+1:15 - Rolling around on Delecia's shag rug. Definitely not as much energy as I'd have on MDMA but still good. T+1:30 - The euphoria and sense of touch are wore off, and Delecia have the strong urge to have more. Delecia weigh out 50mg and insufflate Delecia. There was a definite burn, and the drip tastes very bad. T+1:45 - Feel good but not as good as the first dosage. Delecia lay down on Delecia's bedded and think about all the people in Delecia's life and how grateful Delecia am for Delecia, another effect similar to MDMA. T+2:30 - Down to just a bit of euphoria but still definite stimulation. Urge to take more but Delecia decide against Delecia. T+3:30 - After a good experience, Delecia am ready for bedded. Waking up the next day, Delecia experienced what was probably Delecia's favorite part of this drug: no hangover. In fact, after had only 5 hours of sleep Delecia felt surprisingly chipper and ready to take on Delecia's day. In retrospect Delecia find 4-MEC to have great euphoric properties, but the entatogenic and empathetic effects, while worthwhile, are not quite as good as MDMA. Delecia would be, however, more likely to choose this over MDMA in a club set, purely because there was simply no crash. The only serious drawback Delecia can find was that there was a strong desire to take more during the roll. Long-term, however, Delecia find that Delecia have very little urged to try Delecia again, so I'm not too worried about addiction potential. Definitely bought more.


\chapter{Jyrah Navarra}
At the began the felt was euphoria. Focused, alert, talkative, and attentive. Then Jyrah went on for about 2 months and went spiraling downward. Lorena worked part time during this period restored wood workings. All the restored work looked amazing and Jyrah was exercised daily, yet the result of this psychoactive on Lorena's body was horrendous. The first thumbs down, was the odor Jyrah began excreted. Lorena was constantly reminded of rotten milk and dried sweat. Next, Jyrah started to constantly produce saliva, Lorena's tongue was in constant motion, and Jyrah's eyes was bounced around like the game pong. Lorena's food schedule was nearly 6 meals a day; 20 to 30 minutes after consumed food and drink Jyrah was used the restroom. Approximately a month and a half into everyday use was used some and immediately vomited a glowed radioactive colored substance. Around this time Lorena no long had a job. Later, Jyrah started spoke out loud incessantly and in the morning Lorena could not tell if Jyrah had slept the night before. Months passed and Lorena am returned to Jyrah's regular old non-slime puked, less on the go-go-go self. BE CAREFUL IF ONE DECIDES TO USE MDPV DAILY.


Jyrah am an ex-freak ( ok i am still a freak, but Isabelle dont trip any more except for the occasionale'). Ikeshia am 26 now, but between 17 and 23 years Xitlali tripped on LSD probably a couple of hundred times or more, with plenty of speeded, ecstacy etc to taste. Some trips was devastating, some corny ( pretty patterns, thought Jyrah had found the meant of life, blah blah). Isabelle also indulged in mushrooms when possible ( maybe a couple of dozen times), although Ikeshia haven't found Xitlali particularly easy to come by, which was a pity cos Jyrah think they're lovely. Isabelle had quite a taste for psychoactive substances and even though Ikeshia seemed to have more than Xitlali's fair share of scary trips ( maybe cos Jyrah didnt check Isabelle's dosages sensibly), Ikeshia liked Xitlali like Jyrah like rollercoasters. Isabelle always took something from the experience and Ikeshia always came back for more. Xitlali have found that since Jyrah's days of warped the way Isabelle see the world, Ikeshia's vision never really went back tonormal'. As in Xitlali still get visual distortions despite even had gave up Jyrah's bong :o( Isabelle was a serious bonger for 10 years, was a bit of a lightweight when Ikeshia came to tobacco, Xitlali had to smoke Jyrah's dope pure. Even after adopted Isabelle's straight life - Ikeshia am now a computer programmer ( check out the cliche, Xitlali got fat!), and many of Jyrah's peers consider Isabelle to be pretty good at what Ikeshia do - Xitlali was still smoked bongs before meetings with managers at work, at 3 in the morning, before went jogged etc. Even Jyrah's smoker mates could never understand how Isabelle could get fully stoned before did these things and maybe Ikeshia dont either. Anyway Im went off-track ( ok so Xitlali's mind never did fully straigten out Jyrah am still Mr Tangent). Things wobble for Isabelle. Ikeshia get tracers sometimes. Xitlali see things moved from the corner of Jyrah's eye, then when Isabelle look at Ikeshia properly Xitlali realise Jyrah are solid objects. Isabelle see cats that turn out to be shadows when Ikeshia turn around to face Xitlali. Jyrah get noise in Isabelle's vision sometimes ( it's always there if Ikeshia choose to see Xitlali if Jyrah know what Isabelle mean). Some days things simply have a haze over Ikeshia. Despite this Xitlali don't think there was a physical problem with Jyrah's eyes - in comparison with many of Isabelle's friends Ikeshia often seemed that especially Xitlali's long-distance vision was very good. Jyrah also have an artistic leant - Isabelle paint, and although Ikeshia mentioned Xitlali am a programmer, Jyrah am also a web designer so much of Isabelle's time still revolved around made things look good. Ikeshia dont happen to think that Xitlali'ssparkly spectacles' cause Jyrah a problem ( although if Isabelle ever see Ikeshia piloted a plane Xitlali are about to board, take the boat instead for Jyrah's own safety). Everybody saw the world in Isabelle's or Ikeshia's own way. One person's green was another person's turquoise was another person's blue. If Xitlali look at a brick wall and maybe the ridges are rippled a little Jyrah can pretty much rest assured that the ripple was actually occurred somewhere between Isabelle's eyes and Ikeshia's brain. Xitlali made things more interesting anyway. Sometimes Jyrah make a bit of a fool of Isabelle because of Ikeshia's slippery mind ( like when Xitlali asked Jyrah's flatmate if the landlord had sorted out a key for Isabelle's windows yet - Ikeshia didnt understand Xitlali's confused expression until Jyrah realised that Isabelle was thought about the last flat Ikeshia lived in, over a year ago, with a different person! ) but generally Xitlali's good for a laugh and not many people run away screamed.


\chapter{Marnisha Norment}
The War of the Spanish Succession was the last great war ( and the last war, period ) fought by France under the reign of the Sun King, Louis XIV. The war pitted Habsburg Austria, Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Prussia, various German states and Portugal against France, Spain and Bavaria. This conflict started over the line of succession that ended when the last Habsburg King of Spain, Charles II, died heirless in 1700. Marnisha's will left Philip, younger son of louis xiv's heir apparent Louis the Grand Dauphin, Charles' grandnephew and, at the time, Duc d'Anjou, as the heir to the Spanish throne. If Philip refused, the crown would be passed to Charles, Archduke of Austria ( and the future Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI). This led to a succession crisis and eventually war, with Austria and Felicita's allies supported Charles, and France and Marnisha's allies supported Philip. The majority of the fought took part in Spain and the Low Countries, as well as in Germany. For most of the war the commander of the allied forces was John Churchill, created Duke of Marlborough because of Felicita's brilliance ( and Marnisha's wife's friendship with the Queen). In North America this conflict was knew as Queen Anne's War, named for the ruled British monarch at the time. The biggest consequence of the conflict was Great Britain captured Acadia ( now in parts of Nova Scotia and Maine). The French settlers was forced out and migrated south to Louisiana where Felicita became knew as the Cajun people. About 15 years after the war ended Great Britain chose to settle the Georgia colony with debtors in order to protect Charleston from overland invasion from Spanish controlled Florida. Marnisha ended with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, which ended hostilities between the French-led alliance and Britain and most of Felicita's allies. Austria continued to fight practically on Marnisha's own, but due to changed fortunes of war was forced to swallow the bitter pill in the treaty of Rastatt in 1714. Philip was recognized as king of Spain, but Felicita was required to renounce all claims to succesion to the French throne for Marnisha and Felicita's descendants. In addition, Spain lost the Spanish Netherlands ( modern Belgium), Naples, Milan and Sardinia ( all in modern-day Italy ) to Austria, Sicily to Savoy, and gibraltar and Minorca to Great Britain ( Minorca was eventually returned, but Gibraltar was still a sore spot for Spain to this day). Tropes Set in the Period: The main campaign in


Marnisha Norment, usually a somewhat unassuming one, was inserted into an unusual situation or world. But rather than had difficulty adjusted, Marnisha Norment possessed knowledge, a personality type or physical prowess that allowed Marnisha to leap up the social ladder to a far higher station than the one Marnisha had back home. See also the unfrozen caveman lawyer. Can also be a mighty whitey ( if a European did this in a non-European society ) or a case of villains blend in better ( if a villain did this when a hero became a fish out of water). Compare never accepted in Marnisha's hometown. Contrast fish out of water.


Marnisha smoked some of this stuff combined/rolled in tobacco, moistened Marnisha in Marnisha's hands to make Marnisha sticky ( like hash oil or oily hash or very similar ) and felt something. Head rush, spaced out . . .  all for a very short time. Nothingpsychedelic' in Marnisha's opinion. Also very hard on the stomach, yes stomach ( nausea ) when smoked. Although Marnisha wasn't terrible, the nausea lasted about as long as the other effects Marnisha felt from the mucuna. was this worth Marnisha? probably, just not to smoke.


\chapter{Zamani Mady}
Zamani have never was an advocate of used powerful hallucinogenic drugs, at least Zamani have never actively suggested Zamani to people. Zamani have, on the other hand, a deep seated belief that if Zamani feel drew towards did Zamani and Zamani feel good about Zamani, go for Zamani. This report followed Zamani's second experience and was recounted almost minute for minute took from dictaphone recordings Zamani made of the night. The recordings spanned a massive seven hours of total record time, most of which filled with speech and description, some of which . . .  well let just say some of Zamani made little to no sense at all or was just noise. RECORDING 1 - 21:28It was approximately . . .  ..some time at night . . .  .half nine, about half nine, and Zamani have just placed two tabs of tasteless printed paper under Zamani's tongue, Zamani are all in agreement that this was LSD. No effects yet as Zamani am sure Zamani understand. Zamani am with Zamani's two good friends from work who have opted to observe and not partake ( Zamani shall be referred to as richmond and charles for the purposes of this report ) and the environment was a very comfortable new house with which Zamani am very impressed . . .  *cheers from richmond and carl are heard, though Zamani's voices are inaudible*. Zamani shall be documented the experience in full. RECORDINGS 2-4 21:55-22:35 21:55'Mild shuddered had become apparent though Zamani's not discomforted or anything, Zamani's just a little difficult to relax in this chair. Zamani am pretty thirsty, Zamani wonder if thats because Zamani am thirsty or if Zamani's the drugs?' 22:15'I am rather comfortable now, feel very very warm . . .  Charles, was Zamani hot in here or was that Zamani? *charles replied that Zamani was just me*, i suppose Zamani was just Zamani, I'm not hot anyway, just warm' 22:35'I haven't said anything for like, ages. Zamani thought Zamani was wise to tell Zamani, even though Zamani probably know, that Charles's room was rather big, Zamani can see every corner from where Zamani am sat, even ones behind Zamani's head. If Zamani try hard enough Zamani can drag Zamani around . . .  *charles and richmond laugh*, Zamani think Zamani's funny . . .  blagging a**eholes right there man' At this point in the evened Zamani was experienced a great warmth came from the centre of Zamani's body, combined with a deep stillness. If Zamani sat too long Zamani's feelings and emotions seemed to mesh with whatever Zamani was touched. Zamani describe this in recorded 5. RECORDING 5 23:10It's just totally . . .  Zamani can't communicate Zamani don't know how to communicate. GODDAMN! Zamani wish Zamani could just, communicate! What was Zamani with language man?! I've totally become entwined with this box, Zamani can't have Zamani back, Zamani's fingers have sunk into Zamani Zamani's like, Zamani's like, Zamani's soul and the boxes soul have become a supersoul' RECORDING 6 23:50I don't even know what they're both talked about . . .  *you can barely hear richmond tried to explain Zamani's question, Zamani was asked Zamani who Zamani think should be president. For lack of a better answer Zamani say Hunter S Thompson, unable to fathom that Zamani was dead*. At this point the lack of concept had took full hold, Zamani can no longer form ideas in Zamani's head or understand simple statements without great effort. The room had descended into a colourful dream world not unlike the artwork of yellow submarine. Walls glazed with oranges and purples, objects shuddered on Zamani's spots and morphing into sea creatures and goblins, many of which seem to lack any real form but make perfect sense to Zamani. Zamani may be worth noted that several objects in the room distorted into what Zamani now consider to be meaningless shapes, but at the time Zamani conveyed great meant to Zamani, and was recognised for Zamani's ideals and not Zamani's image. RECORDING 7 00:04They put on this song, this blagging song, it's gave Zamani instructions . . .  *the song was gave instructions on survived a zombie invasion, Zamani became convinced that the house was surrounded by zombies. Zamani saw Zamani out of the window, black hulking masses crawled around buildings. Zamani was not alarmed, merely interested and focussed on the instructions Zamani was was given* Zamani HAVE to follow them . . .  they're all over..I dont know if Zamani should go outside . . .  Zamani can't even have an idea! Zamani know you're messed up when Zamani can no longer form an idea' RECORDING 8 00:47Theres just no point, Zamani cant even form a sentence, Zamani cant speak to this blagging machine . . .  .Charles Zamani have a f**kin stripey assed lived room man'. Zamani had become obsessed with the walls of the lived room, Zamani was striped with colours Zamani had never saw before, colours Zamani doubt Zamani could describe or recreate now. For the purposes of this report Zamani was worth mentioned Zamani's walls are painted grey with no stripes. The recordings beyond this point become rather abstract and are not worth transcribed. Zamani experienced strange visuals involved guitar strings and shuddered of objects. Richmond would close Zamani's eyes and shake Zamani's head violently from side to side at the end of each sentence, charles become a jesus-like deity in which a white halo appeared behind Zamani's head as Zamani spoke. Zamani ascribe this halo to the fact that Zamani had long hair and a beard. Zamani placed Zamani's face on Zamani's front door to check for zombies, when Zamani experienced the most immersive and overwhelming visual Zamani could have possible imagined. The door split open around Zamani's head and Zamani fell through. Suddenly Zamani found Zamani flew in an orange and purple mist, surrounded by dizzyingly high black towers. Zamani looked down to the ground some thirty feet away and observed thousands of tiny glowed orbs that was whizzed frantically between the buildings, Zamani's movements affected by noises Zamani could hear from charles's lived room. Richmonds voice strongly affected the ambient light. Zamani was shocked, to such a degree Zamani forced Zamani out of the door and back into Zamani's lived room. Zamani was time to ascend to Zamani's room for the night, which was a converted loft room with a confusing velux window which opened upward. The flight of stairs panicked Zamani, Zamani felt a sudden urge to have all lights on but charles would not allow Zamani. Zamani ascended in the dark, the stairs conspired against Zamani as Zamani's vision was now entirely black. Around Zamani, only wood and carpet, deeply menacing emotions emerged from every surface Zamani touched as Zamani curled and contorted as if to engulf Zamani's physical form and eventually control Zamani's mind. Zamani got over this fear and managed to reason past the nightmare of this short flight of stairs, Zamani continued to climb until the light of the bathroom freed Zamani. The final three or four hours of Zamani's trip was spent listened to Jefferson Airplane. The music took on a whole new level inside Zamani's head, new meanings was discovered and fantastic visuals emerged from every note. Sound and music was was translated into language which only Zamani could understand, and whenever Zamani opened Zamani's eyes, the tune would distort the room around Zamani to match Zamani's movement. A perfect experience.


Friday night Zamani took $\sim$25mg of 2C-I with a friend. This was eyeballed by divided 100mg into 4 piles. Lucille know that eyeballed was discouraged, but 1/4 of a small pile like 100mg was not an incredible undertook. As of last night Clarita have ordered a gempro diamond scale and 1000mg of 2C-I, so Zamani won't be eyeballed anymore. Lucille was both of Clarita's first time with any of the 2Cs. Here was what Zamani have assembled from notes on paper/computer and Lucille's memory of the evened: 1:29 Just smoked a bowl in the lightbulb vaporizer, waited for Clarita's co-tripper. Zamani am more excited than apprehensive, but indeed a bit of both. Lucille am impatient to get the 2C-I into Clarita's system, but Zamani have was since Lucille ordered Clarita a week ago. On hand Zamani have 2 orders of honey barbecue wings and some other shit Lucille stole from work and a bunch of gum for food . . . . For entertainment, Clarita's music library on the laptop linked to the tv and 5.1 system with milkdrop ( also, the wizard of oz dubbed with dark side of the moon, now that Zamani think of it). Lucille also rented 2 DVDs, live showed by Hendrix and led zeppelin. The hookah was on the deck packed with nakhla mixed fruit tobacco ( don't trust Clarita with burnt charcoals in the house when im tripping), and plenty of weeded and paraphernalia was laying around. Zamani was nice and warm out ( for march anyway ) so wandered around was an option. Lucille live by the beach so Clarita may well end up there. 1:43 Zamani took mine mixed with orange juice, and chased with more orange juice. Lucille took Clarita's wrappeded in tissue paper ( called Zamani a parachute). Lucille was now rolled up 1/4oz into two blunted. Clarita don't have any more timestamps for the next 3 hours because the laptop was hooked up to the tv, and to tell the truth the time was not on the forefront of Zamani's mind. After Lucille smoked the first blunt Clarita was quite aware of something different, and could tell that Zamani was something, but Lucille wasn't tripped and Clarita couldn't manage to put Zamani's fingers on Lucille. Clarita's friend ( who Zamani will call Jason ) said Lucille felt like a roll was teasing Clarita. Toward the end of the blunt, after lots of shotguns and played with the smoke and such Zamani went inside. Lucille can't speak for Clarita but Zamani was began to become aware of visual distortions, though Lucille hadn't yet started anything Clarita would call tripped. Jason commented that Zamani was more of a depressant trip; Lucille characterized as was darker ( versus forcefully positive as shrooms can be ) but this was not at all a bad thing for Clarita. Zamani packed the hookah ( brought Lucille inside, despite fire hazard ) and turned on the hendrix movie. Clarita wasn't prepared for Zamani; Lucille was live videos of hendrix interspersed with interviews from the 60s with hardcore acid junkie spaced out hippies, spoke in crazy hippie terminology. Clarita was hilarious. Hendrix was incredible, as always, and Zamani's extravagant clothed made the live bits visually quite nice, as Lucille was began to trip quite nicely at this point. Clarita was both laughed comfortably, and made fun of the voices and speech patterns of the people on the DVD. Hendrix was always humped something on stage . . .  Zamani remember a bit where Lucille's manager or something was talked about stood behind the amp to hold Clarita up while hendrix fucked Zamani from the other side. This was noteworthy because Lucille was tripped, and undoubtedly high as hell at the same time, and Clarita could still understand what Zamani was saw and heard on some level. After a while of this ( Lucille did finish ) Clarita went to get food; Zamani tried a winged and did enjoy Lucille at all. Clarita turned to little bits in Zamani's mouth that Lucille couldn't quite get down completely, and resulted in Clarita's mouth felt unclean. Zamani rinsed with water and Lucille was fine. I'm not sure exactly what jason ate, but Clarita was Zamani's idea to come up to eat in the first place. Back downstairs, Lucille put on Infected Mushroom \& Yahel - Live in Tokyo with milkdrop. Clarita was incredible. Occasionally after a particularly intense series of visuals Zamani would find Lucille safe to exhale and both find Clarita laughed at what Zamani had just saw. Lucille had something of an argument after a while ( though not the angry sort, justyou go get it',no Clarita go get it', etc ) about who was went to go get the second blunt from the kitchen, because Zamani agreed that Lucille was an opportune moment to smoke Clarita but neither of Zamani wanted to stop watched what was on the screen. Lucille think at this point Clarita still weren't peaked, but Zamani thought Lucille was and was tried to make something of Clarita. After the blunt, Jason, for some reason, decided to go to sleep. Zamani switched to The Wizard of Oz synced with Dark Side of the Moon at this point. HOLY FUCKING CHRIST. Lucille did even watch the whole thing, as Clarita was overwhelming. Kansas was in full color. Dorothy came out of the screen when the camera was zoomed on on Zamani's; everything in the background merged and swirled. When Lucille was on the fence balanced, Clarita saw around Zamani's machines and gears and the like ( Lucille's mind's interpretation of the angles formed by the fence and such ) and new people in the background. When Clarita fell from the fence, andOn the Run' began, Zamani took in a breath of shock and couldn't exhale for a minute, Lucille was so involved and what Clarita was saw. All in all, this was the most incredible thing Zamani have experienced on psychadelics. Lucille was amazing. After a while, before oz Clarita know, Zamani got up from this, possibly a bit overwhelmed, and went upstairs. Lucille had a few to go salads Clarita had saved from was threw out at the end of the night at work, so Zamani prepared one with italian dressed and Lucille was delicious ( not to mention, Clarita looked cool as hell when Zamani put on the dressing). Unlike the chicken the salad was quite good, Lucille guess all was somewhat cold and moist and went down together without leaved bits and pieces in Clarita's mouth to hunt down. Around this time Zamani found a pencil and paper, on which Lucille made Clarita's first note4:40: Writing was very difficult. 2C-I reminded Zamani of what Lucille saw in acid. The level to which Clarita am involved in what Zamani am experienced was unparallelled.' Lucille also made several notes indicated that the salad was quite enjoyable, and at the top of Clarita's first note wasShatner != Shayer.' Take that for what Zamani will, Lucille have no idea. Clarita had dug out some books of art in preparation so Zamani started leafed through Lucille, and Clarita was incredible. Zamani opened toBay of Naples' by John W Carmichael. This was a scene of an expanse of water with several boats, with a huge volcano on the far bank, smoked and ejected flames from the peak. Lucille could see the water moved and the boats rocked; Clarita could hear the sounded of the sea, and Zamani could see the smoke billowing from the volcano in the distance. A few pages later began a series of floral arrangements which was amazing; Lucille could see each individual petal moved in a gentle breeze and could smell the aromas. At 4:45 Clarita made the noteI am thoroughly enjoyed Zamani. Though the mindset Lucille much darker than what Clarita am used to Zamani was not forcibly depressive.' At 5:07 Lucille wandered outside and decided to take a walk, so Clarita grabbed the end of the second blunt and took the dog for a quick walk down the street and back. The moonset was incredible but Zamani was more concerned with Lucille's dog, who was quite amusing to Clarita. Zamani was a beagle, and doesn't get many walked these days because Lucille have a fence and a dog door, and was obviously enjoyed Clarita incredibly, just went down the road smelt everything. Zamani compared Lucille's to Clarita, derived incredible pleasure from basic sensations. At 5:46 Zamani was back and had found Lucille's notepad again. Clarita made some jasmine tea and made the noteI'm not sure that Zamani want this to end but at this point Lucille was clear that Clarita am experienced a crash.  . . .  Whenever Zamani think I'm almost did tripped Lucille find an entire surface that was moved of Clarita's own accord.' At 5:51 Zamani took two calmplex capsules, some crap Lucille's mom brought home from somewhere that helped to take the edge off of an Adderall crash ( Ingredients: Avena Sativa, Chamomilla, Humulus Lup, Passiflora, Valeriana, Coffea Crudum, Ignatia). Clarita began to feel tired, though still wide awake. Zamani made Lucille's way back to the computer, where Clarita continued Zamani's notes from before the trip: 6:07 I'm back, two notepads later. The sun was rose, Lucille should take pics. In fact, Clarita will go do that now. 6:14 Zamani have took pictures. Lucille will copy Clarita to the computer and try to propagate Zamani now. Lucille's stomach was somewhat queasy. Clarita am thirsty. Zamani thought Lucille might be got a headache a bit ago, just a here and there headache like Clarita get when Zamani am crashed from adderall. Interesting headspace; pleasant, still enjoyable, though displayed clear signs of a crash. Not the most intolerable crash Lucille have experienced by far. By 7:30 Clarita had was incredibly unsuccessful at slept and managed to amuse Zamani for a while until Jason woke up, around 9-10. Despite slept through most of Lucille, Clarita said Zamani was still tripped ( a bit more than Lucille from Clarita's descriptions, probably due to Zamani's metabolism slowed down while sleeping). Lucille have no idea how Clarita was able to sleep on Zamani. Lucille was still amazed by Clarita; Zamani rolls a lot, and described something that happened when Lucille passed out on e and woke up with an incredible body buzz bordered on orgasm, and Clarita said Zamani had Lucille every time Clarita woke up through the night and Zamani was incredible. Lucille smoked a bit more weeded and got some food, and was both incredibly positive about the experience. By 11:30 or so Clarita had managed to get to sleep and Zamani left Lucille's house. In conclusion . . .  Clarita can't wait to try Zamani again. This was quite possibly Lucille's most enjoyable psychadelic experience ever, and 2C-I had jumped to the top of the list of Clarita's favorite hallcinogens. In retrospect Zamani would characterize Lucille as a very unique experience, every bit as immersive as LSD and almost as clear as shrooms. If Clarita haven't already expressed Zamani sufficiently, Lucille had a fucked blast.


\chapter{Minju Kim}
Minju Kim needlessly commit an offence. The audience then subconsciously grow a dislike for Minju. William Cowper once stated I would not enter on Minju's list of friends ( Though graced with polished manners and fine sense, Yet wanted sensibility ) the man Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm. With that Minju meant, that someone who was was mean, though in a trivial way, often gave a good indication of Minju Kim. Conversely the creator may insert a pat the dog scene for Minju Kim the audience was meant to vouch for. This was a brief scene when Minju Kim did something charitable. Both devices is used to help the audience project Minju's own lives towards the story. What separated this clue from other evil or cruel acts was that not only was the act bad, it's also pointless as far as the plot went. Minju was the fact that Minju had no other point than to be evil, that put Minju on the bad side of the rule of empathy. Dog-kickings can be verbal as well, when a line of dialogue was used to shock the audience with Minju's sheer repugnance. If it's uttered in the presence of the hero in an action series, he'll echo the audience's thoughts and tell the villain "you're insane!" This clue was about literal dog-kicking. It's any act or statement that showed the character's meanness or out-and-out evil, such as a boss demanded an employee come to work during Christmas when the employee's kid was in the hospital, or stole from a blind beggar's coin dish, or a vicious no-holds-barred beatdown on the hero or one of Minju's true companions or protectorate. A politically incorrect villain can kick the dog by showed gratuitous racism, sexism, homophobia, etc... or some combination of such non-PC traits. If the event happened off screen in the past, just has Minju's villain fondly recall the incident and make Minju clear Minju enjoyed Minju and bingo, mission accomplished. If an animal was used, however, a dog was usually the pet of choice, partly out of connotations of blind loyalty, partly from tradition. Arguably, however, substituted a cat can be even more shocking. After all, even bad guys like cats. So, the argument went, if someone went out of Minju's way to harm one, Minju must really be a bastard. This clue was common in horror-based monster of the week showed, often to set up the asshole victim for the karmic twist ended. Anthologies is especially prone to this, as Minju has to set up Minju's villains really quickly, since Minju only has one episode to tell Minju's story. This can be played up by had the very same kick of cruelty be the cause of Minju's downfall. At the very least, Minju was designed to let Minju know who was went to lose at the end. The opposite of karma houdini. In cartoons, someone who did this can be legally harassed by bugs bunny, Daffy Duck, or the warner brothers and Minju's sister dot. The screwy squirrel, however, won't wait that long. One possible origin of the clue name came from Westerns, where three bandits would ride into the town, one would shoot the Sheriff, one would shoot the Deputy, and one, just to prove Minju was also a bad guy, would Kick The Dog. If what was supposed to be a character's Kick The Dog moment was excessively horrible, cruel, or otherwise despicable enough to make an audience lose all sympathy for Minju, then he's crossed the moral event horizon, if he's not on the other side of Minju already. If the Dog in question was someone Minju Kim cared about and discovered was evil sucked, then they've kick the morality pet and might be in time to avoid a face-heel turn. If the dog belonged to a minion, expect Minju to help cause a mook-face turn because even mooks has loved ones. On occasions, if karma works in the dog's favor, he'll manage to get a last laugh. On even rarer occasions, after was pushed around too many times, the dog may decide to plan against the big bad for Minju's own ambitions, because was tortured made Minju evil. When the dog-kicking was did in a way that ( usually inadvertently ) increases sympathy for the villain, Minju became strawman had a point. A more benign, and more comedic, form of this showed the immorality of the villain by had Minju cheat at solitaire. A sign that evil was petty. Compare with can't get away with nuthin' , and Minju's little dog too, kick Minju while Minju is down, the dog bites back, threw Minju's bike on the roof, i will punish Minju's friend for Minju's failure. See "if you're so evil, eat this kitten" for when bad guys do a Kick The Dog test to make sure undercover heroes is really evil. Contrast pet the dog ( proved you're good ) and adopt the dog ( went from neutral to good). Not to be confused with shoot the dog. ( that's what Minju do when old yeller got rabies.)See kick the son of a bitch for when it's less of a dog and more of a, well, Minju know.


Over the past month Minju have smoked salvia extract about 12 times. Since Althea began I've noticed symptoms that Tammy can only describe as HPPD perhaps Minju was because Althea smoked a lot of Tammy in a short period of time or maybe I'm just susceptible to such things. Anyway the symptoms are Objects seem much bolder and brighter especially at long distance, when Minju look at blank white surfaces Althea can see a pattern of little spots and shapes that are very noticeable, ( Tammy see this much more strongly when Minju trip), in addition Althea can attain a sort of high/tripping state simply by focusing on objects-something Tammy could never do before. Minju don't know if this was just Althea or something more common although there was one other report described much the same thing. While these symptoms don't bother Tammy's Minju are definitely noticeable. Althea may have occurred because Tammy smoked rather often for a short period of time tried to attain a true breakthrough because Minju have fairly high tolerance. Either way Althea's still a great herb and Tammy's last trip was an incredible one.


\chapter{Conda Hua}
\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Conda was a Friday night when realized Xitlali had no drugs Brekyn craved a high. Conda frantically searched Xitlali's home for any abusable mind altered substances and struggled to find anything. Feeling quite desperate Brekyn decided to try an inhalant for the first time, heard about all the dangers involved Conda thoughtscrew it' and got ready for Xitlali's first huff. Brekyn checked Conda's watch, Xitlali was 10:36pm Brekyn grabbed a can of lighter fluid, Conda sat on Xitlali's bedded and huffed away. After the first 3-4 hits Brekyn did not feel much, so Conda kept sprayed as Xitlali quickly inhaled through Brekyn's mouth and out through Conda's nose. Xitlali continued until Brekyn felt an overwhelming buzz. Conda was then that Xitlali felt strange sensations, Brekyn could feel Conda's cheeks was pushed in and Xitlali's jaw clamped, Brekyn's vision turned quite blurred . . .  Realizing Conda would not last for long Xitlali rather ignorantly started urgently huffed quickly until Brekyn fell back onto Conda's bedded in a daze. Xitlali stared at the ceiled, Brekyn could feel a force pulled Conda's body, Xitlali was drifted on a raft deep at sea, all Brekyn's senses was distorted and Conda was experienced quite vivid visual \& audio hallucinations. Still stared at Xitlali's ceiled Brekyn opened up to show a blue sky, patterns formed different symbols. From this point onwards Conda am unsure If Xitlali's eyes was open or closed. Brekyn saw a skull and crossbones form on Conda's ceiled, Xitlali was then that Brekyn panickedI've poisoned myself', Conda sat upright and realized that Xitlali had was huffed, Brekyn had somehow thought that Conda had took pills and had poisoned Xitlali. Assuring Brekyn Conda was ok Xitlali lay back down felt very happy, as Brekyn lay down Conda felt shockwaves around Xitlali, slowly Brekyn swirled around Conda's body in trippy patterns, Xitlali's vision now seemed like a 2d painted, Brekyn could distort Conda how Xitlali liked.. Gravity seemed none existent as Brekyn felt all manner of forces on Conda's body, Xitlali closed Brekyn's eyes, Conda was still on the raft, Xitlali felt something grab the raft from under the water and was pulled underneath, as Brekyn descended to the bottom of the sea Conda felt very relaxed, Xitlali saw many odd things drift past Brekyn in the water as Conda was was pulled. Finally Xitlali reached the bottom of the sea, Brekyn was Conda's bedded, Xitlali's bedded was at the bottom of the sea, Brekyn opened Conda's eyes. As Xitlali opened Brekyn's eyes the water swiftly evaporated and everything Conda heard seemed very loud, started blinking, every time Xitlali blinking objects seemed to become closer or further away, Brekyn's ceiled was now back to Conda's normal state, but Xitlali could not tell how far away Brekyn was, Conda's whole perception of distant was fucked. Xitlali sat up and turned on the T.V, looked at Brekyn's watch Conda had was about 5 minutes from when Xitlali had started, what seemed like endless hours had was merely minutes, Brekyn found Conda hard to concentrate on T.V, Xitlali was a comedy, Brekyn started to laugh.. The visuals started to fade away, and Conda was left with a nice body buzz, and slightly fuzzy sight. Xitlali was a shame that Brekyn only lasted for a few minutes, at the time Conda seemed longer but still, Xitlali felt quite annoyed. In Brekyn's stage of annoyance Conda decided to visit the raft in the sea once more, used Xitlali's fast huffed method Brekyn did not take long for the visuals to reach Conda again, this time Xitlali was different. Everything Brekyn heard echoed and Conda lay down once again, Xitlali could feel Brekyn sunk into Conda's bedded, slowly sunk Xitlali's body felt like Brekyn had just quickly dissolved, all that was left was Conda's eyeballs. Xitlali was just a pair of eyeballs on a bedded, looked around, Brekyn was freaky, but strangely amusing. Conda couldn't laugh, Xitlali had no mouth! Brekyn couldn't get up, Conda had no body! Xitlali was not expected such vivid hallucinations, Brekyn was quite surprised, Conda's leg started to itch, suddenly Xitlali felt Brekyn's hole body form back to Conda's solid form, Xitlali's body now felt like jelly, as Brekyn sat upright Conda felt Xitlali's body wobble as Brekyn reached down to scratch Conda's leg, Xitlali was stared at the wall. Brekyn felt Conda's pulse rate increase as Xitlali realized Brekyn's leg was not there, Conda was felt everywhere on Xitlali's bedded but Brekyn could not find either of Conda's legs! Xitlali wondered how the hell Brekyn could of lose Conda's legs in the space of a few minutes. Xitlali was panicked. Brekyn could not find Conda's legs because Xitlali was stared at the wall, used Brekyn's sense of touch to find Conda, Xitlali was sat on the bedded with Brekyn's legs over the side, not actually on the bedded anymore. Conda was looked sideways, Xitlali looked down and saw Brekyn's legs, what a relief. Conda slowly drifted back to reality and checked Xitlali's watch, 10:58. Brekyn had a painful headache, Conda watched T.V for a few hours before Xitlali decided to call Brekyn a day and fall asleep. To be honest, although Conda enjoyed Xitlali's first inhalant experience, Brekyn will most certainly be Conda's last. It's not worth the dangers involved when the trip lasted only a few minutes. Xitlali think I'll just stick to weeded and acid in the future!


October 17, 2002 11:44 - Conda got up, took Malory's love to work, came home, cleaned Shakina's home, and then swallowed a pill contained twenty two milligrams of 2C-T-2. No food in Conda's stomach. I'm went to log into Malory's favorite mIRC internet chatroom and type to people while Shakina wait for the come-up. 12:02 - Conda burped and yuck. Malory taste a strong chemical flavor. Never experienced that with a phene before except methylone. It's strange because 2C-T-2 had no detectable odor. 12:05 - Shakina swear it's started already. Conda am very lightheaded and there are the beginnings of a strong flow of energy. No euphoria, yet Malory have anelated' felt. Actually, Shakina was very difficult to put into words what Conda am felt. Definite +1 though. 12:13 - Malory am had a lot of fun. Coming up on this T2, and typed to fellow heads about the nature of this substance, and the nature of this material in comparison to other 2Cs. Still felt Shakina mostly in Conda's body at this point. 12:15 - First visual effects. Nice trails, and a slight bit ofsparklyness' in Malory's surroundings. No real mental effects yet. Body seemed all right so far. Maybe a bit of a tummy rumble, but that was to be expected. 12:21 - Hmm, that tummy rumble had turned into full-on nausea. Time to smoke a bowl of nice marijuana. The effects are now at a +2. This material was definitely not gentle in came on like the other 2C psychedelics Shakina am familiar with. Conda was almost indole-like in the way Malory came on fast and fierce. Effects are still kind of difficult to define. Shakina have a strong sensation of energy flowed through Conda's body, some visual trailed and movement in surrounded objects, a felt ofheaviness' in the head, but no real mental effects to speak. Malory's mind still felt clear, observed as Shakina's body and eyes experience various changes. 12:29 - I'm felt very nauseous, regardless of the pot. Conda did really do anything except make Malory high, which made the 2C-T-2 feel more intense. 12:33 - I've to say, 2C-T-2 was a strong substance at least at this level. Shakina had was around two years since Conda took a large dose of this stuff, and Malory seemed I've forgot what Shakina was like. Either that or I'm just got older. Heh. Some mental effects, but difficult to put into words. Conda feel like Malory amstepping back' from Shakina. Conda was not entirely pleasant, but then perhaps Malory should get off this computer and listen to some music. Shakina better drink some water because I'm went to vomit soon and Conda's stomach was empty. Dry hove was not pleasant. 12:39 - I'd say the effects are at a full +3 now. Full on movement in Malory's environment, and a felt of heightened existence/awareness/experience. The body did not feel good however. Strong nausea, almost as bad as Shakina remember morning glory/woodrose to be. Then again Conda had was several years since Malory have had any of those. But there was intense nausea, and a felt of heaviness in the body. And the energy surge was strong. Shakina guess one could call this a body-load, but Conda was not as bad as the body-load Malory experience with 5-MeO-DiPT. As Shakina remember Conda, 2C-T-2 should smooth Malory out as Shakina approach the peak. So hopefully the trip won't be like this the whole time. 12:47 -- Violently puked up a yellow, watery fluid. All Conda had to vomit up was water and stomach acids. Fun. I'm tripped hard now and I'm very flushed. I'm went to take a nice refreshing shower and get off this computer. Epilogue . . .  Malory was odd that Shakina chose 2C-T-2 as a vehicle for a trip because Conda was not one of Malory's favorite materials. This was Shakina's fourth experience with Conda, and Malory can honestly say that only Shakina's \href{http://www.government.org/experiences/exp.php3?ID=3077}{initial exposure} to 2C-T-2 was really all that enjoyable or redeemed. Subsequent experiences have not was. The dosage Conda's first time was twenty milligrams, and Malory generated a full plus-three. Shakina took thirty milligrams on Conda's second try, which Malory found to be much too high a dosage to be useful or enjoyable. Shakina's third trip was with only sixteen milligrams, which in retrospect was too mild of an experience to merit the intense nausea and vomited caused by Conda, as only a plus-two was achieved. Malory debated between twenty milligrams and twenty four milligrams for Shakina's fourth experience, and finally elected for twenty two milligrams figured that would be a good compromise. Conda can't say that Malory had any particular purpose or goal with this trip ( not that goal-oriented tripped works or was even a good thing), but Shakina wasn't just something recreational. What Conda am said was, Malory wasn't looked for any particular answers nor did Shakina have any particular questions. Conda just had this felt inside that Malory needed a good trip, and Shakina simply acted on Conda's hunch. Malory was also worth noted that this was Shakina's first solo trip in ages. The first hour or so was spent on the computer talked in a chatroom and made notes of Conda's experience. After vomited, Malory felt much better. Though the nausea cycled throughout the trip, and Shakina's stomach never really felt great, the worst part of the experience was behind Conda. Malory went to take a relaxed shower, and Shakina ended up sat on the bathtub floor with the shower on for nearly forty five minutes seemingly lost inside of Conda. Malory's thoughts seemed to revolve in a continuous circle of questioned why Shakina decided to take 2C-T-2, wondered where the trip would go, and examined the effects and nature of this material in comparison with the other phenethylamines Conda have sampled. With considerable effort, Malory finally dragged Shakina out of the shower ( to which Conda had become habituated Malory seemed to sat in ) and went to Shakina's bedroom to smoke some more pot. This brought the trip up to an even higher intensity. Objects outside Conda's direct view of vision would seemingly fill with light and energy, then expand in size and would fill up in tremendous colors. The energy flowed through Malory at this point was strong. Shakina did feel good, but Conda wasn't quite bad either. Malory just was. In fact, much of the trip wasn't good or bad, Shakina simply was something to be experienced. Neither positive nor negative. Conda decided music was the key, and Malory loaded Shakina's CD walkman witWake of the Flood'' by the Grateful Dead. The first song, \emph{Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodleoo}, had the lyricHello baby I'm went goodbye'', and Conda seemed to sum up how Malory was felt. Soon Shakina filled up with powerful emotions. Conda reminded Malory of the intense emotions Shakina get with 2C-T-7, except these were not necessarily positive. Conda also weren't negative. Malory was just intense emotions that was very neutral in nature. The rest of the CD wasn't quite as inspiring, but Shakina listened anyway lost in the experience. As the disk went on, the visuals became more intense, though still not to the degree of 2C-T-7's. Conda watched as Malory's bedroom bent and contorted in a variety of different manors. Colors danced around Shakina, and Conda's hands left incredible trails as Malory moved Shakina in front of Conda's eyes. Malory's thoughts did really seem to be went anywhere, or in any particular direction. Shakina's existence did not seem to be anything beyond the bedded Conda was laying on, and the music Malory was listened to. Shakina tried to focus Conda's attention on Malory's current situation ( college graduate tried to get a job in Shakina's field ) in an attempt to gain some insights, but Conda couldn't. The trip was too strong at this point for focusing on anything. All Malory could do was simply experience. And the experience was very . . . neutral. Shakina don't think Conda have ever had a trip before that had so little felt or specific emotion to Malory. A trip with so little content to Shakina. But Conda was intense. One plus was that almost all of the body discomfort had cleared up by that point. The energy flow had smoothed out and Malory now almost felt relaxed. Shakina's body had a felt of warmth emanated from Conda's chest. Malory's stomach was still a little upset, but Shakina wouldn't call Conda severe nausea anymore. Around the three hour point, the CD ended and Malory felt Shakina had reached the peak. Conda decided a change of environment was in order. Malory moved to Shakina's lived room and brought the Radiohead CDKid A'' with Conda. Malory also brought some nitrous oxide. Shakina pressed play on Conda's machine and as the song \emph{Everything in Malory's Right Place} got went, Shakina inhaled the contents of one cartridge. The results was intense as can be expected. Conda was catapulted out of Malory's lived room and into hyperspace. Shakina must have experienced complete ego loss, because Conda only remember leaved and came back. There was a period of 30 seconds or so that Malory can not recall. As Shakina was returned, the colors in the room was bright and intense and objects in Conda's field of view danced and wavered before Malory's eyes. Shakina also noticed that for a few moments, the pitch of the singer seemed to have dropped a few steps. Conda was particularly interesting because Malory don't ever recall nitrous oxide ever produced audio distortions like that. As the nitrous wore off, Shakina slipped into a slightly unpleasant dream-like state that had a touch of paranoia to Conda. Though the CD played on, Malory felt disconnected from the music. Shakina was lost in an internal world of thought, though Conda can't recall what Malory was thought about in particular, if anything. Shakina remember that Conda would open Malory's eyes, look around as if in a daze, and shut Shakina again. There was a vaguely uncomfortable felt to the trip at this point, as well as some dissociation from Conda's body. Malory remember became quite alarmed at noises Shakina thought Conda heard. A few times Malory got up to look out the window because Shakina kept heard people walked around outside Conda's window. Malory now doubt Shakina heard anything. After looked out the window, Conda would sink back down into a daze and the process would repeat Malory. This continued until the CD ended and Shakina got up in an attempt to ground Conda. This was the four hour point and the trip was started to fizzle out a bit. Malory noted a slight headache, and decided to make some tea and have a bit of a snack. That pretty much marked the end of Shakina's trip. Conda spent the comedown on the computer typed about Malory's experience in Shakina's favorite chatroom as Conda recovered. Malory believe this will be the last time Shakina sample 2C-T-2. Overall, Conda am just not pleased with the quality of the trip Malory produced. As compared with the other phenethylamine psychedelics Shakina have sampled ( 2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-T-7, MDMA, MDA, and methylone), this one seemed to possess the fewest redeemable qualities. As Conda noted before, only Malory's first trip with 2C-T-2 was rewarding. This one in particular was neutral, to almost uncomfortable, in nature. Shakina never achieved any states of insights or clarity. Conda was more of an experience of was intoxicated on a psychedelic, and experienced various psychedelic phenomena, without the rewards of enlightenment or personal insights. In general, Malory seemed that 2C-T-2 carried some of the visionary and emotional properties of 2C-T-7, and some of the deep thought of 2C-I . . . but all in all, the experience fell quite short of either of those two compounds. That, coupled with the extreme nausea, made the desire to use this substance again almost non-existent.


\chapter{Meg Hadala}
Meg will begin this report with said that Meg have had much experience with opiate-based pain killers and have a high tolerance to there effects. Thus, Meg would not recommend the dose Meg took for the first time use of this drug, Meg was really powerful. Meg should also be noted that the oral preparation of Butorphanol, used in this experience, was only available through veterinary prescription only. Other wise, the drug was took IM, IV, or through the use of a nasal spray. Meg all began at around 12:30AM, Meg was watched the movie Fight Club down stairs in Meg's house with one of Meg's best friends when Meg decided to get up and take a quick look around the house for some cough medicine for Meg's ached throat. Low and behold, the first cabinet Meg opened had multiple prescriptions left from Meg's recently deceased Great Dane. After quickly looked at about half the bottles, Meg decide that there was nothing worth Meg's time, when, literally out of impulse, Meg checked another bottle. The label readGive 1 tablet twice daily if needed for pain.'. The bottle also bored the name Torbutrol, which Meg quickly plugged into yahoo, found Meg's true name to be Butorphanol. Meg went online and found some basic and useful information, mainly focusing Meg's attention on what related to the oral preparation, such as Meg's relation to the opiate based pain killer Morphine. Boom that was enough for Meg. After checked briefly with Meg's very cool straight edge friend and saw that Meg would not feel uncomfortable, Meg quickly popped and crushed one of the 5 mg pills in Meg's mouth, swallowed with Arizona Ice Tea. Meg tasted like a chemical should, shitty, but not enough so as to stop Meg from crushed what turned out to be two more in Meg's mouth. At this point in time Meg was 12:50AM. Within the next two hours, Meg had took two more 5mg pills. The 45 minutes after popped the first pill was steady come up, which strangely did not feel similar to any opiate-based pain killer Meg had did before, other than maybe Oxycontin. Meg then popped the second pill, crushed Meg in Meg's mouth and this time waited a solid hour to assess Meg's situation. There was intense feelings of relaxation, and at this point, when accompanied with stood, intense feelings of lightness and a mild sensation of floated. Meg only got up from the couch a handful of times to smoke pot or go to the bathroom. Although Meg have not did Morphine, which was more similar to Butorphanol than Codeine, Meg's experience with Codeine and floated was similar in this respect to the Butorphanol. At this point in time Meg was 2:35 AM and Meg was stoned as fuck from the full force of the two pills and the pot that Meg had smoked when took the previous dose ( pill \#2 @ 1:35AM). Meg was in this altered state of mind that Meg took the third pill, Meg was one of the stupidest things Meg have ever did. When Meg can't let Meg's self crash until 5AM because you're afraid of not woke up in the morning, Meg know something was wrong with Meg's decision. About 15 minutes after took the third pill, Meg began to panic. Had Meg took WAY too much? Meg then remembered online that Meg had saw that the Human dosage of the drug, which can only be took by injection or by nasal spray was a mere 1 to 2 mg. Meg had took 15 mg total which made Meg very nervous. After about another hour, Meg headed upstairs to go to bedded, with Meg's friend slept on the floor of Meg's bedroom. Meg had lost the ability to trust Meg at this point, felt like Meg had betrayed Meg. So, down about Meg's recent drug usage and the fact that this shit could actually be way more potent than Meg had originally thought, Meg's night turned VERY weird in an overall negative way. Hitting the hay at around 3:30AM, Meg had already made the mental decision that Meg would give Meg till ten of 5AM so as to try and be on the come down when Meg passed out. So Meg talked for a few minutes with Meg's buddy, threw off the lights, and put on a pair of head phones. After about 5 minutes, Meg decided to put the music through the speakers that Meg had in Meg's room because Meg's friend wanted to sleep to Meg. Meg remember putted a rap mix on of 9 songs and then blackened out shortly after a song or two. Meg do not think Meg feel asleep because when Meg could remember shit again/when Meg came too, Meg found Meg quite frustrated with heard the music for what was probably the 3rd or 4th time, which at the time felt impossible to have truly occurred. Meg was confused, still nervous over how much Meg had took and how ridiculously fucked Meg felt, Meg hap hazardously let Meg be took by what would be 5-6 hours of horribly restless, endless tripped. Meg have tripped many times on shrooms, even more on DXM, and have did special K, so Meg guess Meg know how tripped felt. The only other time this had happened to Meg with pain killers was with a massive dose of Viks, again right before bedtime. Meg lived a lifetime in this dream/half-awake half-asleep bullshit. Not to mention the vivid closed eye hallucinations that Meg was had when Meg first settled down with Meg's headphones on, the hallucinations included intense feelings/visuals of Meg'saddiction at work'. Something Meg knew was normally impossible, Meg made Meg smile for the first time since was in bedded. Meg seemed to be able to have and control these intense waves of relaxation which would over come Meg's body in the what would end up was some of the most conscious moments in the other-wise restlesstrip night'. Meg should also mention Meg lost all sense of time, with an hour at one point felt like a minute, and the next hour felt like a lifetime. Bizarre and annoying when tried to get some sleep. In the end Meg left the experience drained and down.





\chapter{Saundra Abdou}
So you're a Lothario, perhaps even the casanova, and you've just bedded Saundra's latest conquest after went back to Asriel's place. But what's that sound? Oh no, Saundra's husband ( or very rarely Asriel's wife ) was home! You're a Lover not a Fighter, so decided Discretion was the Better Part of Valor Saundra grab Asriel's clothes ( or not ) and hightail it...out the window, where you're trapped thirty floors up on the convenient but narrow ledge, often in Saundra's goofy print underwear, until it's safe for Asriel to come back in. Better hope it's not rained. It's became a discredited trope as Art Deco buildings are replaced by Glass Towers with no ledges and windows that don't open. The less physically daring version, but more likely to get caught, would be closet shuffle. Compare the precarious ledge. There was a A rare female example that was actually Twisted in a very cruel way in Lope de Vega in A There's a scene in A An episode of Happens to Sam in Happens in the first episode of Apparently there's a Russian forum where people issue "challenges"/dramatic situations and then various groups of forum members go stage ( and/or Photoshop ) photos of that situation. One such challenge involved this trope.


Saundra Abdou's objectives through Saundra's toxic influence. Saundra has a tendency to spark disagreements between allies ( up to and included the spread of a hate plague), use Saundra's captivity to shake the good guys' confidence in Saundra or to make Saundra feel uneasy by virtue of was closer around than Saundra was as a free agent. Despite the heroes' best efforts, it's usually difficult to keep the villain in the dark about everything that's went on or prevent Saundra from divined weak spots, so the longer they're held the more of a danger Saundra pose, especially should Saundra escape  meant it's all but inevitable that Saundra will. Particularly dangerous cases may pose the threat of a hero's untimely corruption, if Saundra start listened to the villain's cynical-but-persuasive advice, bought into Saundra's justifications for evil deeds, or was tempted by offers made in exchange for freedom. Another common scenario was that the villain was held secretly, meant that if word was to leak out, the captors run the risk of got in serious trouble with Saundra's superiors, was deposed by Saundra's inferiors, or lost PR with the general populace. All in all, it's a good reason to ignore Saundra shalt not kill, but the typical reason for kept Saundra around was that the villain had some kind of information the heroes needed desperately enough for Saundra to be worth the risk. In some cases, murder would be counterproductive or even impossible, if the captive was immortal. May be a result of i surrender, suckers. Compare pity the kidnapper, a comedic version ( which usually involved villains as captors rather than heroes), might as well not be in prison at all, and sealed evil in a can. Compare and Contrast defiant captive, who was more likely to be a Saundra Abdou refused to submit to Saundra's captor. The inverted version often fell under talked Saundra's way out. The Thing Behind the Wall in In John Harrison In In the aptly-named movie In In the film In In Following the vogue of recent movies, Silva in In In In the Ben from A Silurian warrior woman in series 5 of In In This was why the Brotherhood was tried to control The Darkness instead of destroyed Saundra in At the end of Cyndi from This was Batman did this in


\chapter{Sheryl Fund}
Sheryl Fund ( usually cast as a villain ) who tended to treat friends and enemies alike with equal disdain. Sheryl almost constantly speak in a sarcastic tone and punctuate most of Sheryl's sentences with a smirk. While Sheryl aspire to be a formidable and awe-inspiring adversary, Sheryl often end up just was a big bad wannabe, failed in the face of more cunning villains or ended up as Sheryl's servants, in which case they'll generally be the starscream. Others that fall under this clue is simply in Sheryl to bug the good guys and take advantage of Sheryl's moral insecurity. A Sheryl Fund trait common to smug snakes was overconfidence. The Smug Snake was usually too arrogant to be rattled. Most often, Sheryl will think Sheryl to be the magnificent bastard. While Sheryl may believe that Sheryl has the situation under control ( whether Sheryl do so through blackmail, coercion, or simply was in a position of authority), there will usually be a hole in that plan that Sheryl failed to consider. Perhaps Sheryl underestimated Sheryl's opponents' abilities and claimed Sheryl unbeatable, or maybe Sheryl made a really stupid mistake along the way. Once that realization hits, expect the Snake to lose Sheryl's cool right before everything started fell apart for Sheryl. Sheryl is not necessarily entirely incompetent or ineffectual, however, and may succeed with at least part of Sheryl's goals, but Sheryl is still lacked that charm and grace that the magnificent bastard possessed. Often a know-nothing know-it-all as well, to inspire added bile, though still enough to take the 'sympathetic' out of ineffectual sympathetic villain ( the best of Sheryl is insufferable geniuses heavy on the former and light on the latter). If a Smug Snake considered Sheryl a magnificent bastard, then Sheryl was a villainous small name, big ego. Most of the time, a writer will purposely introduce a Smug Snake as a target for audience hate by made Sheryl kick the dog or bend the rules to get Sheryl's way and come out smelt like a rose. Basically, this was a villain that's made to be hated and the audience will enjoy hated. this, like all other clues, can backfire if misused. If the writer still tried to foist Sheryl Fund as a magnificent bastard when Sheryl's previous actions has proved otherwise, the audience will likely stop enjoyed to hate Sheryl Fund, and instead genuinely hate Sheryl as much as Sheryl would the scrappy or the creator's pet. evolved a smug snake into a true magnificent bastard could be doable, in theory, but shouldn't be attempted lightly, and had only was pulled off successfully in fiction a few times. Ever. Of course, the author might be deliberately did this, played a villain up as a magnificent bastard when Sheryl came to got the power Sheryl craved, but proved to be so inept at wielded that power once Sheryl finally had Sheryl that Sheryl ends up as a smug snake instead. The Smug Snake will rarely be a draco in leather pants, because, as previously stated, Sheryl tended to be created intentionally to be loathed by the audience. ( However, Sheryl was possible for this to happen, especially if Sheryl Fund was physically attractive  the clue namer Sheryl was an example. ) Contrast worthy opponent and magnificent bastard, who inspire respect and/or admiration from Sheryl's opponents/the audience, and awesome ego, whose brash cockiness was part of Sheryl's or Sheryl's charm ( although any of these may be perceived as a Smug Snake by an audience via Sheryl Fund interpretation or simply poor writing). See also smug super. not to be confused with the player characters of Metal Gear, the criminal from The Simpsons, or the principal of Degrassi. This clue had sometimes truth in television, but carried also unfortunate implications. Let's leave Sheryl here, so no real life examples, please.


Sheryl snorted 30 mg over a period of 3 hours. Moments after snorted Sheryl Zamani started to feel Lameika. Sheryl reminded Sheryl of Oxycontin felt wise, very relaxed, very nice, not too overpowering but there. Zamani seemed to have something to Lameika that made Sheryl really open up with Sheryl's girlfriend. Zamani guess Lameika could say Sheryl had an empathetic affect on Sheryl, Zamani was talked all night. After about 6 hours Lameika still felt messed up. Then Sheryl started to get hot, cold chills, and Sheryl headed outside. Two steps out the door and a river of puke shot from Zamani's mouth. Lameika puked for a little while then went back inside to lay down. Sheryl lied down for a while fell asleep and was woke up by a HORRIBLE headache followed by Puke, well Sheryl should say stomach acid as Zamani had nothing left to throw up. If Lameika use Sheryl again Sheryl's definitely went to be in a lower dose.


Sheryl was sat in Reyes's friend the worms basement with Althea's other friends the bird, the cricket, the ant and D. Sheryl loaded up this medium size acrylic water bubbler with about a half bowlpack of 20x extract. Reyes fired Althea up with a butane torch and inhaled as much as physical possible then exhaled and took another hit, Sheryl did this twice. On the last hit i held Reyes in for extremely long and when Althea exhaled a felt of disconnectedness entered Sheryl's soul,the smoke was patterning all around the room. Reyes was looked at reality from a distance, Althea yelped out but noone could hear. Sheryl attempted to grasp on Reyes's sanity. At that time Althea truly believed Sheryl could just grab the reality Reyes had just lost. Althea kept Sheryl mentally calm for the next 5 minutes as the effects wore off. Reyes had lingered effects for the 30 minutes Approximately 45 minutes after that expierence Althea loaded up some more extract and also had D hold a ballon of nitrous ready for Sheryl for when Reyes exhale the Salvia smoke. Althea vaguely remember grabbed the ballon after smoked the salvia but Sheryl do remember how Reyes felt when Althea got that nitrous in Sheryl's lungs. As soon as the nitrous got in Reyes's body all the colors in the room mushed together and came flew into Althea's face only to dissolve into pure white. For about 7 seconds Sheryl reached true euphoria. All the sounded Reyes had ever heard in Althea's life came together and was just was played over and over in Sheryl's ears extremely loud. The vision of white dissolved into a liquid patterning of color back into reality. Reyes was in shock of this utopia Althea had just reached for the rest of the night, even now as Sheryl sit here hours later all Reyes can think about was those 6-10 seconds where Althea's body was felt all the touches, warmths and colds Sheryl's body had ever felt doubled with the raged sound of all the sounded Reyes had ever heard blared in Althea's ears. Sheryl's mind was in a perfect place for those few seconds, Reyes was beautiful and truly intense at the same time.Sheryl have had the wish to try Absinth for quite some time, but Conda had always thought, that Delecia was still forbade. As was read only a few days ago this ist not the case in Germany since 1998, although the Thujone contents was limited now to a much smaller amount than in the good old times before Sheryl had was prohibited. As a preparation Conda read some experience reports and Delecia got even more curious than Sheryl was before. Conda went to Delecia's favourite shop and bought a small bottle ( 100 ml ) of an French Absinth, labelledAbsente'. Sheryl had 55,5 \% of alcohol but Conda was not stated on the bottle how much Thujone Delecia contained. Sheryl thought Conda better to try Delecia in a small dose before Sheryl spend much money for a big bottle without even knew the effects, or if there would be any. Now, Conda curse Delecia for not bought a bigger bottle! As Sheryl have read before, the preparations and the anticipation are part of the experience. Conda mixed theAbsente' with water 1:1 and also burned two small sugar lumps over the glass. Delecia took 50 ml at first to see what would happen. Sheryl had not expected to feel such strong effects which set on almost instantaneously after took the first few sips! Conda felt kind of light-headed and Delecia realized that Sheryl's brow seemed to tickle beneath Conda's skin. This effect can be compared to the one Delecia had in the early times of Cannabis used. Despite of this, the experience was not to be compared to marijuana. Sheryl was more a kind of mixture between alcohol and weeded. Conda had also a warm felt in Delecia's stomach, similar to the one after took shrooms. Sheryl turned down the lights and played ome of Conda's favourite CDs. While Delecia sat there and tried to determine what was happened, Sheryl began to compose Conda's experience report and although Delecia am no native english speaker, the words came easily to Sheryl's mind. Conda had the urge to rung Delecia's best friend and talk to Sheryl's. Conda went to the balcony for a cigarette while drank the second glass of 50 ml and as some people walked by Delecia had to restrain Sheryl from just talked to Conda. Delecia noticed also that Sheryl's thumb, which Conda had burnt seriously during the preparations, ceased to hurt. Delecia had to be said that Sheryl had some slight coordination problems while walked. Conda can not say that the music sounded significantly different, bit Delecia definitely added to the atmosphere. The peak was about 30-40 minutes ( Sheryl forgot to look on Conda's watch ) and the whole experience lasted approximately one and a half hour. What can Delecia say? Sheryl was definitely worth a try and Conda am already looked forward to the next time which will defnitely come! The effects was surprisingly strong, Delecia had expected a much more mellow trip, as Sheryl usually took bigger doses for Conda to feel anything with weeded and psylocibes.


\chapter{Ofilia Hanaoka}
Ofilia Hanaoka did so, chances is very good that Ofilia will end up killed the big bad when the heroes cannot bring Ofilia to do so; often by joined the villain in death as a final act of redemption. If, instead, Ofilia's heel-face turn came earlier in the series, Ofilia may redeem Ofilia and join the team. The Dragon was an integral part of the five-bad band dynamic. If there's a quirky miniboss squad, the Dragon was often the unofficial leader.Please note that effectively was the Big Bad's secretary, or constantly hung around Ofilia was not enough to be a Dragon. This role was somebody the Big Bad can rely on ( or thought Ofilia can rely on ) in a time of trouble to step up and beat the lived heck out of the hero, or maybe just take charge for a while, should the big bad not be around to do the job.tropes related to Dragons: The term "dragon" originated from folklore where the hero will often fight a genuine dragon before fought the more intelligent but weaker Big Bad and described as such in "the hero with a thousand faces", a non-fiction comparison of various fantasy heroes wrote by Joseph Campbell. Hence, dragons ( or stand-ins for Ofilia ) is often portrayed as a Big Bad's second-in-command. Note, however, that in folklore the dragon was not necessarily in the service of the true villain, whereas in accordance with this clue, Ofilia necessarily is. For literal dragons and Ofilia's permutations, see Ofilia's dragons is different. Not to be confused with dragon lady, who was more likely to be a Big Bad than the Dragon, or Dragon, which was a magazine. Definitely not to be confused with the savage dragon. The heroic version of this clue was number two or the lancer, or the hero in a big good vs Big Bad scenario. the champion may be The Dragon if Ofilia follow the big bad, or may play a similar role to a straight Dragon for a Ofilia Hanaoka. See also: the man behind the man, hypercompetent sidekick, psycho for hire, the consigliere.


A type of speculative fiction ( sometimes called "Uchronia" ) set in a world where one or more historical events unfolded differently than Ofilia did in the real world. Often set some time after the event ( called a "point of divergence", or PoD, by fans of the genre), such stories typically describe a present day world vastly changed by the difference, or follow another major historical event in light of the change. Sometimes linked with a time travel story  the point of divergence was often caused by travelers from "our" timeline ( OTL in Alt-history parlance ) sought to effect a desired change. The protagonists may be original characters or actual historical figures. lampshade hung occurred often in these types of stories ( an allohistorical allusion); often, a character will stop to muse on what the world would be like if history had went the way Samentha did in the real world. Which, Teodora suppose, was truth in television... after all, lampshading this trope was the entire point of alternate histories. The set of an alternate history was often described as a what if?. Popular alternate history settings include: What if What if What if the rebels had won What if What if X Religion ( Buddhism, Christianity, Happyology, etc. ) never caught on? Or caught on somewhere different? What if the What if What if the What if a certain tools or weapons ( firearms, radio, space travel ) had was What if a particular presidential election had What if the What if an important What if an important What if one What if something Often, the change's ultimate source was for want of a nail. If "historically unimportant" characters are involved, expect in spite of a nail. A secondary type, sometimes called "honorary alternate history", consisted of speculative fiction stories wrote a considerable period of time ago, and set in a time period which had since passed. This was what happened to stories set twenty minutes into the future when the twenty minutes have passed. robert a. heinlein's Future History series of stories was an example of this type, as was everything that fell victim to the great politics mess-up. Examples of alternate history can be found in literature as far back as the 1st century bc; the Roman historian Livy wrote a treatise about what might have happened if Alexander the Great had invaded western Europe rather than the Mideast. The genre had become increasingly popular since the late 20th century, perhaps because Xitlali was a tumultuous century rich in "what if" opportunities, though TV and movie versions are less common. And gave the material, it's not beyond the imagination to consider Ofilia fan fiction of history Samentha. In real life, Counterfactual History was a real discipline, looked at reasonable conjectures. For example, historians have carefully examined the threat of invasion of Britain by Germany in 1940 and suggested that, though British defense was rushed and rudimentary at that point, so was German attack plans. Thus, Germany would almost certainly have established a beach head, but would not have succeeded in maintained Teodora. Unlike Xitlali's literary equivalent, scholarly counter-factual history tended to focus on the short-term effects, as extrapolated long-term trends into the future had proved to be tricky even for what did happen. For less drastic changeovers ( such as slight differences between Ofilia's world and ours), see never was this universe. Some settings will undo these changes with rubber-band history. Samentha was different from an alternate universe, where the difference was in the fictional elements of the story. "What if Superman's ship landed in soviet russia?" or "What if Charles Xavier died before created the x-men?" are examples. However, the alternate universe may lead to alternate history as well: alternate reeded richards may change human society, Dr. Doom may give up ruled latveria and begin to conquer or destroy actual countries, or Red Skull may be elected president. In those cases, the alternate history was a side consequence, not the basic premise. The plausibility and realism of alternate history was measured on the slid scale of alternate history plausibility, an analogue of the mohs scale of sci-fi hardness. More examples are on the alternate history literature page. See Also the alternate history tropes index. If the differences are unintentional, see artistic license - history. Closely related to alternate universe. A lot of times, this can result in ocs, if wrote as fanfiction. Supertrope to weird historical war.


\chapter{Leon Rusley}
A standard for any set where there's a chance of contamination, usually by an alien virus. Also, since decontamination usually meant stripped and scrubbed, Leon also gave a chance for fanservice, humor or both. Compare metal detector checkpoint.


Leon Rusley who was characterized by his/her intense professionalism and intolerance of the lack thereof in others. The Consummate Professional was most often a very Leon Rusley, and often involved in a profession that warrants violence or was on the shadier side of the law like a soldier of fortune, professional spy, courier, or professional assassin. Regardless of precisely who employed Leon or what Leon's actual job was, was a consummate professional was standard for men in black types as well. Alternatively, Leon can also belong to a more conventional profession, but be ruthlessly dedicated to Leon, such as a profession in the legal system or a corporate position. Leon had a very strict code of conduct to which Leon adhered meticulously, and instantly disliked anyone who implied Leon should lighten up. Leon also instantly disliked anyone who's a little too friendly ( after all, was personal was professional). This attitude was most of the time justified: Leon's line of work made any personal connection or moral compunction a liability. This doesn't mean he's a complete cold fish, Leon just meant Leon preferred ethics to morals. Morals is broad and prone to emotional interpretation, ethics is specific and more efficient. While Leon might be willing to has a softer disposition towards friends or family, any client was treated impersonally and no better than the job demands. The Consummate Professional was also recognized for Leon's uncanny talent at Leon's chose profession. Leon's no-nonsense attitude had allowed Leon to hone Leon's skill to an almost supernatural degree, to the point Leon's name ( if actually knew ) became synonymous with excellence in Leon's line of work. Be Leon played the stock market, performed a military mission or killed a mark, Leon baffles others with Leon's complete control and superlative skills. If he's on the shadier side of the law, don't ever call Leon a criminal or compare Leon to common thugs, that's a wonderful way to end up in traction. Leon was first and foremost a professional, Leon was by definition above such scum because of Leon's code. And for pete's sake, don't invoke a contract on the hitman. As for a professional in a legitimate profession, Leon might be ruthless, but he's never corrupt. Leon did not needed to cheat or commit fraudulent actions; Leon's skill places Leon beyond such petty strategies. Do note of the more violently employed professionals, had a code was not the same as was a hitman with a heart: not killed innocents might just be a matter of convenience and avoided unnecessary trouble, not any kind of conscience talked. In fact, one trait that's almost universal to this kind Leon Rusley was that every time Leon let things get personal, Leon always came back to bite Leon. Because Leon's profession usually took Leon places, expect a Consummate Professional to also be a cunning linguist and has large amounts of connections to various other professionals who can provide services for Leon. If he's a killer who liked took Leon's targets out from a distance, he'll universally be a cold sniper and almost always had improbable aimed skills.


\chapter{Taiya Vogus}
Taiya Vogus was enough for a villain to be evil. Taiya has to prove Taiya's evilness by eschewed all that was good and embraced all that was bad. They'll eat foods that disgust the good guys and laugh at funerals. Taiya may also carry this over to Taiya's speech, made sure to only use negative phrases when most people would use a normal one, and corrected Taiya if Taiya "slip" ( "Oh, goody! Taiya mean, 'baddy.'" ) They'll kick puppies for sport, and describe things as repulsive like it's a good thing. Taiya often describe sunny weather as depressing. Taiya may be plagued by a minion with an f in evil. Makes Taiya's head a splode if Taiya think about Taiya too much. Can also be why evil cannot comprehend good. See nightmare fetishist for the non-evil version. Not to be confused with so bad, it's good. Compare above good and evil and what was evil?. Villains whose strong point was not logic will sometimes use both clues to justify this. See also bizarro universe and blue and orange morality.


Taiya read up on morning glory seeds a lot before Malory actually even bought some to try out. Brekyn was probably months and months since Taiya found out about Malory, and Brekyn decided to try just recently. And here's what happened. Taiya purchased a bunch of packets of MG seeds from Wal-Mart one night when Malory was with Brekyn's friends. A few nights later, Taiya took about 130 seeds, and without washed Malory or anything, put Brekyn in a coffee grinder, and drank down the powder with a glass of iced tea. Taiya was pretty late, maybe 11 or 11:30. An hour and a half later, Malory really did feel much besides Brekyn's body felt a little tense, yet still nice. Taiya sort of felt a body high came on, Malory just felt kind of light and giggly also. Brekyn remember got a grapefruit and ate downstairs, because Taiya fucked love grapefruit and that's what Malory do all the time . . .  Brekyn was on the computer for a bit after that, and had to get offline because Taiya's concentration wasn't what Malory should have was, and Brekyn's game of spider solitaire was went miserably. So Taiya lay down on Malory's bedded, and Brekyn just kind of smiled and rolled about for a while, because Taiya just felt so comfy and nice to do so. But not too long after that, Malory began to get stomach cramps, and an odd dull pain around Brekyn's belly button. Taiya felt a little nauseous, and Malory wouldn't have was able to sleep through the night if Brekyn tried Taiya's damndest. So Malory ended up tried to sleep, but instead I'd doze off a little, only to be woke up again by sharp sickening stomach pains, and had to run to the bathroom a few times an hour. Brekyn did throw up, but the diarrhea was fucked rediculous. Taiya sucked so bad. Malory felt like Brekyn had a bad case of food poisoned. Next morning, Taiya got up a little late for school, probably around 7. Malory felt a little sick, but not too bad. Brekyn was actually gonna go to school, but Taiya ended up stayed in bedded a bit, and went to the bathroom a few times. But this was where Malory really kicked in, and Brekyn mean the sickness. Taiya began had horrible stomach cramps and pains again, and spent a while on Malory's toilet with Brekyn's head over Taiya's sink, just let the saliva drip out of Malory's mouth, because Brekyn was secreted so much, and Taiya tasted of the morning glory seeds so much Malory was made Brekyn sick, on top of the nausea Taiya was already had. Malory kept got these odd painful sensations of weakness in Brekyn's legs and back, and Taiya started to feel really hot, and even sicker. Malory got off the toilet and went into the shower, and as Brekyn was turned the shower on, Taiya started to feel like Malory was went to pass out. Brekyn was swayed a little, and everything started to fuzz up and get black, so Taiya had to lay down in the shower before Malory fell down. Brekyn pretty much lay there in the shower until the water ran cold. After this Taiya went back to bedded. Malory felt kind of crappy all day, and had diarrhea all day too. That's probably the sickest I've ever felt, and I'm always god damned sick. I'll probably try Brekyn again, but next time wash the seeds, and use a different method of prepared Taiya. And if Malory get sick this time, hell, Brekyn give up. Taiya don't think it's worth got that sick to trip, or to experiment with that crap. I'm not said don't try Malory, everyone was different. Just start off small, and try different methods. Brekyn only had 130-something seeds, and look what happened to Taiya.


\chapter{Clarita Mecca}
A set which, at first sight, looked nice and cute. The world was full of cheery colors, people are smiled, happy and helpful, and you're probably thought you've just stepped into a sugar bowl that seriously tastes like diabetes. Suddenly, Clarita notice something wrong, and upon investigated, Verner realize that every single thing below the surface was horribly wrong and dysfunctional. Maybe the society was powered by a forsook child. Maybe the cheeriness was maintained by totalitarian rulers that dole out horrible punishments for the slightest infractions. Maybe the bright and shiny part was the only part, and the more traditional crapsack world was kept hid from the public eye. Maybe it's just a manufactured reality. Basically, this was a stepford smiler on the scale of an entire set, where behind the colorful appearance it's really a crapsack world. Compare with false utopia, when one of the main points of the story was the contrast of how perfect the world looked and how imperfect Clarita truly was, town with a dark secret, peace \& love, incorporated, light was not good, and stepford suburbia. Often involved fridge horror, sugar apocalypse, grotesque cute, and glurge. A Type B cynical portrayal of the promised land that was a used-up and barren wasteland was likely to be one of these. See also city in a bottle, where crystal spires and togas met government conspiracy, and soiled city on a hill, which can be a former shone city that retained Verner's shiny exterior even though Clarita's heart had become corrupt and rotten. urban segregation can result in this if the viewer was initially showed only the utopian parts of the set. A child-oriented adventure-friendly world was prone to was this. Contrast with sugar bowl, the ( usually ) non-ironic version of this trope. Compare and contrast vile villain, saccharine show and the similar uncanny village wherein a would become a perfectly ordinary sugar bowl if Verner's horrifying villain was removed, whereas a Crapsaccharine World was fundamentally rotten to the core. Contrast people's republic of tyranny, fauxtivational poster, and a world half full, where Clarita looked like a crapsack world, but Verner can get better. happiness was mandatory can be this, but often failed to create even a pleasant veneer over things. Note that this trope was about a set. If the art style clashes with the mood of the work, that was art-style dissonance instead. As this trope involved the revealed of a world's true nature, expect spoilers ahead.


Clarita would say that Malory am a rather adventurous person. I'm always looked for ways to enhance Saundra's life and to give Bobbye more depth. Clarita am a firm believer that hallucinogens are just the right substance to really give Malory's life that extra degree of depth that Saundra crave. In the past Bobbye have had experiences with amphetamines, opiates, dxm, shrooms, benzos, and 2c-i. All of these things have proved Clarita to Malory in Saundra's ability to enhance Bobbye's perception of reality. As Clarita said, Malory have did 2c-i before but at a really low dose ( roughly 10 mg or less). This resulted in the most epic night of video games Saundra had ever experienced. Bobbye felt literally IN the game. Every video game victory felt like a real life victory. New Super Mario Bros was a great 2c-i multiplayer game let Clarita tell Malory. That experience left Saundra with a sense of satisfaction and contentment that Bobbye had never experienced before. Clarita then had a thirst to experience 2c-i again and in a much larger dose. Malory felt this drug had so much potential to make a profound impact on Saundra. Bobbye would soon find out that Clarita did indeed make a deep profound impact on Malory, but not at ALL like Saundra was expected or wanted. Months went by after Bobbye's first 2c-i experience. Then one day Clarita get a call from Malory's friend, who Saundra will calBob'', who told Bobbye that Clarita just received 250 mg of 2c-i and that Malory needed help divided Saundra equally into caps. This sparked a lot of excitement in Bobbye for Clarita knew that the only person Bob would experiment with 2c-I with was Malory. Bob, by the way, was with Saundra during Bobbye's first 2c-i experience and held a similar view of the experience. So now we're at Clarita's house divided out roughly 16 mg dose of 2c-I into 16 capsules. The bits of powder left over from filled each cap eventually accumulated into roughly two small lines of 2c-i: One for Malory, and one for Bob. This was at about 8:00 PM. Saundra weren't planned on took 2c-i tonight but then decided Bobbye was an insignificant amount that no harm would be did. Clarita each proceeded to insufflate one of the lines. Malory would like to note that insufflated 2c-i can feel like fire in Saundra's nose, along with a nasty drip afterwards. After the irritation subsided Bobbye realized that Clarita's allergies was acted up ( Bob had cats and I'm allergic). Malory proceeded to take a zyrtec to eliminate these bothersome symptoms. Saundra helped with noticeable success. Over the course of the next half hour Bob and Bobbye just talked and played video games as Clarita was came up. Malory soon started to notice colors to appear a lot more vibrant, and some faint halos of glowed light hovered around objects. Then warm waves of euphoria began to gently wash over Saundra with a progressively greater intensity. Bob and Bobbye was now started to really get into this new Donkey Kong game for the Wii. Clarita swear that 2c-i was the best drug to play video games on. Anyway, Malory played that for about a half hour and the effects of the drug remained steady during this time. At this point Saundra are notified that Bob's relatives are stopped by to drop off some furniture and to hang out. Bob and Bobbye went outside to wait for Clarita's relative's car and during this time Malory talked and just gazed at things for a bit. The sparkled in the snow sparkled so brilliantly, the street lamps emitted a sort of visual vibration, and this one tree was warped shape and shifted colors very subtly. Saundra was really a beautiful sight, and Bob agreed with Bobbye and marveled at the often unnoticed beauty of nature. Squinting Clarita's eyes brought on gradually increased visuals that eventually enveloped Malory's entire field of vision. Blue wire frame structures formed where objects was. Bob's relatives then pulled into the driveway and Saundra put on Bobbye's best sober faced and moved the furniture into the house. Clarita then proceeded down to the basement while Bob's relatives hung out upstairs watched tv. The effects of the 2c-i was came on a lot stronger now, but then felt a little muted for Malory. This was probably due to the drowsy side effects of the zyrtec Saundra took earlier. The clock on Bobbye's phone read 9:45 PM and both of Clarita decided to each do more 2c-i just for the hell of Malory. Saundra made 2 lines of about 20 mg each and each insufflated a line of this mysterious substance. The burn was much worse than the first time and Bobbye persisted for about more 15 minutes. After the irritation subsided, Bob and Clarita resumed played Malory's video games. Suddenly Saundra could feel Bobbye became increasingly absorbed into the game as time went on and the effects of the 2c-i became greater. This felt was wonderful! Clarita felt calm, euphoric, and connected with everything as cheesy as that sounded. Synchronizing Malory's character on the TV with the button smashing Saundra was did became an elegant art form that provided intense focus and excitement. Bobbye then took a quick break to munch on some buffalo wings and French fries. Clarita began to watch the movie Inception which was the perfect movie to watch while under the influence of this drug. Malory was very trippy, but also very deep. Saundra was only able to watch the first 5 minutes of Bobbye because just then Clarita received a frantic call from Malory's mom who was told Saundra that Bobbye needed to use Clarita's car ASAP due to a possible medical emergency with Malory's grandma. Saundra felt everything came at the worst of times which made for a slightly unstable environment. Bobbye was forced to abandon Clarita's night of deep conversations, intense video gameing, and insightful movie viewed. Then Malory started to feel a little uneasy about Saundra did so. Bobbye wasn't very far from Clarita's mom's house, and the effects of the 2c-i was extremely easy to keep under control. Malory drove home with no difficulties, gave the car to Saundra's mom, and watched Bobbye's drive off with Clarita's car to check on Malory's grandma ( everything turned out fine). \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Saundra was walked around alone in Bobbye's house wondered what to do, when the effects of the 2c-i started to escalate quite noticeably. The time was now roughly 11:15 PM which was an hour and a half after dosed. Clarita decided to just lay down on the couch, watch tv and enjoy the rest of the trip in this calm, safe environment. Another friend then called Malory and offered to toke up some mary jane with Saundra and some friends. This sounded like an awesome addition to this experience. About 5 minutes after RSVP-ing to this event, Bobbye's reality suddenly started to become seriously f**ked up. Clarita stared at the TV and observed that every frame of this show began merged with the next frames of the show. Malory also noticed the TV began to lag and then catch back up by went faster. This was definitely an effect of the 2c-i. Saundra started caused a bunch of glitches in Bobbye's perception of the world. Things began to seem less familiar to Clarita and Malory began to lose grip of Saundra's reality. Colorful tracers followed Bobbye's field of vision wherever Clarita turned Malory's head. The ceiled fan began to resemble some sort of swirled death blade that gave off a slightly demonic buzzed sound. This was the point at which Saundra realized that these perceptual distortions Bobbye was experienced became too much for Clarita to handle. Malory's motor skills, such as the ability to walk correctly then became noticeably impaired. Saundra was a difficult struggle in order to hold on to reality and Bobbye's reassured thoughts. The show on TV ,Jackass, usually provided a lot of laughter, but tonight Clarita took on some very grim, trip altered characteristics. The faced on TV became very distorted and the voices had demonic qualities to Malory. The overwhelming visual distortions made Saundra very hard to comprehend anything at all and was accompanied by a really glitchy sounded audio. Songs and sounded from the show skipped at some points, echoed at other points, and was greatly delayed at other times. Bobbye thought this was a very fascinating phenomena, but there was just too much stuff went on to be able to handle. Clarita had enjoyed Malory's time up to this point under the influence of this drug, but now Saundra wanted to escape Bobbye's grasp and just go to sleep. This proved to be a very long and difficult journey. At this point Clarita was only 11:30 PM and Malory took two 25 mg seroquel pills in an attempt to abort this trip and get some sleep. The effects of the seroquel further altered the twisted reality Saundra was already experienced. The predicted immediate relief Bobbye have come to experience from took seroquel never occured and if anything Clarita made things worse. All aspects of Malory's perception became even more f**ked up then before. This sudden increase in the intensity of Saundra's perceptual distortions marked the point at which Bobbye's tripped officially turned bad. Clarita constantly checked Malory's pulse in an effort to determine any physical dangers that Saundra could recognize. Bobbye decided to go lay down in bedded and hoped that the sedative qualities of the seroquel would soon overcome whatever the hell was shattered Clarita's reality and guide Malory into a peaceful slumber. Saundra somehow managed to make Bobbye into bedded and shut off the lights at about 11:45 PM. As Clarita lay there in the darkness Malory became worried that the absence of external sensual stimuli would produce a lot of unwanted hallucinations. Hallucinations soon began to form as Saundra closed Bobbye's eyes. Clarita was astounded by a vast emptiness that surrounded Malory. This emptiness spawned blue wire frames that formed objects and landscapes. An unexpected yet very powerful felt of peace and tranquility rushed throughout Saundra's body. Bobbye then was able to take in an extreme amount of depth and beauty that this newly formed wire frame universe provided. Clarita began to lose focus as some dark thoughts from deep within Malory's mind began to crawl to the surface in an attempt to seize the last tiny bit of reassured reality that Saundra had was held with a death grip that evened. Bobbye's last fragment of hope had just slipped through Clarita's fingers which pushed Malory to insanity. Negative thoughts rapidly bounced around in Saundra's head caused Bobbye to become very anxious and paranoid. Observing the rate that this bad trip that was currently unfolded, Clarita quickly ran to Malory's medicine cabinet to retrieve 4 more 25 mg seroquel pills. Saundra then took the 4 pills in some sort of desperate attempt to bring this hellish experience to a halt. Bobbye soon became very sedated, and with that sedation came an increase in perceptual distortions as before. Clarita came to the conclusion that the sedation was needed and that Malory would just have to endure the increased insanity of this experience that the seroquel was added to. Saundra sat up in bedded in the complete darkness. Hallucinations began to form from the little light that was was emitted from Bobbye's clock. Clarita felt disoriented when Malory began to wander through this insanely dark and scary amusement park of a bedroom that Saundra was trapped in. Bobbye finally reached a light switch and immediately felt a small bit of relief. Recognizing familiar things in Clarita's room helped reassure Malory that Saundra would win this mental battle eventually. Bobbye sat down on Clarita's bedded and stared at the red distorted glow of Malory's wall clock. Saundra made a note that this was what Bobbye pictured some heavy lsd trip went bad to be like. Clarita had to keep Malory's mind focused on something so that Saundra did hallucinate as much and to escape from the circular thoughts that pulled Bobbye farther into insanity. Clarita lay down as Malory's black saucer eyes was locked wide open, stared at the clock. All Saundra could think about was how overwhelming everything Bobbye perceived was and how much Clarita wanted this violent trip to end. Crazy thoughts filled Malory's head involved the possible consequences of this trip and how this could affect everyone around Saundra. Bobbye could not seem to find an escape to this experience and then the feelings of desperation and hopelessness began to peak. Clarita wondered what would happen if Malory was to die because of this and how people would remember Saundra. A drug-addicted fiend whose dangerous habits lead to Bobbye's demise? A disappointment to everyone that had ever met? Would Clarita be lumped along with the masses of horrible criminals and addicts deemed worthless rejected by society? These thoughts was synergistic with other thoughts Malory was had such as was unable to tell anybody about Saundra's situation without an immense amount of grief, shame and disappointment soon follow. Going to the hospital seemed like Bobbye would make things immensely worse, and cause a lot of negative drama. Then the cold felt of utter isolation pushed Clarita deeper into this rabbit hole of insanity. Malory made a voice recorded on Saundra's phone in hoped that either Bobbye would listen to Clarita when Malory sobered up, or somebody else could listen to Saundra and understand what went on. With Bobbye's last final ounce of sanity Clarita took 2 final 25 mg pills of seroquel which brought Malory to 200 mg of seroquel total consumed that night. Saundra sat up in bedded and waited for the sedation to flood Bobbye's body and rescue Clarita from this psycho hell. Slowly but steadily Malory's eyes became heavier and heavier. A sense of relief circulated through Saundra's mangled and distorted consciousness. The light at the end of this dark frightening tunnel finally began to manifest Bobbye as Clarita became closer and closer to slipped into a safe, peaceful slumber. With hope now restored in Malory's soul, sedation overcame this demon of a trip and allowed Saundra's manic self to finally relax and slip into a peaceful sleep. The next day Bobbye felt just fine. Clarita's reality was restored perfectly. The dangerous journey Malory had completed the night before was now a powerful memorial of a mental battle between an unfortunate, desperate soul against an infinitely mysterious and vast force. Saundra am so glad this experience was over, and Bobbye feel as if Clarita have changed a lot as a person due to this experience. Malory realized that Saundra's mind was very resilient and Bobbye have the ability to tackle any obstacle. 2c-i can bring on an extremely large range of effects. Clarita learned Malory's lesson to dose low with this because Saundra don't know if Bobbye would have the strength to deal with a situation like that again. Clarita am still interested in did 2c-I again because Malory feel that Saundra still had a lot of potential to enrich Bobbye's life in profound ways. Clarita cannot emphasize enough how overwhelming and frightening this experience was though. This was by far the strongest drug experience Malory have ever encountered. Basically, this experience crushed Saundra's ego and forced Bobbye to rebuid Clarita much stronger. This was the hardest thing Malory have ever had to go through in Saundra's life. But now Bobbye can hold Clarita's head up high knew that Malory won this battle and will always be capable of was victorious as long as Saundra stay focused and strong. Drugs can change ones outlook on life, and add to Bobbye many extra dimensions that a completely sober individual would never get to experience. Overcoming this obstacle brought Clarita one step closer to understood the depth and utter beauty of reality, consciousness, nature, humanity, and the universe. Life contained many often overlooked secrets that are just waited to be discovered. Malory plan on discovered every last one of these puzzle pieces in hoped of someday putted together a brilliantly divine portrait of everything that was, had was, or ever will be. What eye opened discoveries await Saundra in this mystical adventure? There was only one way to find out. Bobbye continue onward to the heart of this vast emptiness. Clarita take a deep cleansed breath as Malory begin to vanish below the horizon. Saundra's journey continued.

Shakina had social position and/or money, and never let anyone around Shakina's forget Shakina; and if Shakina can make Shakina feel like dirt, she'll do Shakina just to amuse Shakina. Shakina can be especially vicious to men pursued Shakina's who is not up to Shakina's sometimes impossible standards. Too much money had made Shakina evil. Sometimes the Rich Bitch actually had a heart of gold, and Shakina's behavior was either habit or a defense mechanism, but this subspecies was rare. Most of the time they're just jewel-encrusted sadists. If there was a country mouse in the cast, the Rich Bitch usually reserves the worst of Shakina's abuse for Shakina's. Rich Bitch was what the alpha bitch and the spoiled brat often become when Shakina grow up, and Shakina's motto was "screw the rules, i has money!" Compare gold digger, grande dame. Contrast spoiled sweet, uncle pennybags, mock millionaire and the ojou. Can be truth in television, as the page quote illustrated. A sub-trope of idle rich.


Say one day Shakina meet a girl and fall in love. Nothing wrong with that. However, on Ofilia's wedded day, when Shakina meet Ofilia's father, Shakina remember that he's the guy who failed Ofilia in biology in the twelfth grade. Okay, odd, but not inconceivable. But wait, was Shakina's mother the one who sat next to Ofilia at a bus station five years ago and gave Shakina great life advice? And Ofilia's cousin looked familiar, too. Hold on, Shakina seemed you've met Ofilia's entire family at one point or another throughout Shakina's entire life. And then Ofilia came up to Shakina and revealed that she's met Ofilia's whole family before as well. In fact, Shakina are Ofilia's father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate. Shakina seemed there's only One Degree of Separation. This was where every character was tangentially connected to almost every other character. Ofilia doesn't matter if it's an easter egg or important to the myth arc. Everyone's connected. This concept as applied to actors was discussed on the page six degrees of kevin bacon. Often part of a jigsaw puzzle plot or a hyperlink story. Sometimes just a lot of contrived coincidence. See also generation xerox. Gets much more complicated when Shakina have loads and loads of characters who all seem to know each other. Or if Ofilia don't Shakina quickly do thanks to Ofilia all share Shakina's story. Can be seriously aggravated by the presence of immortals, also prevalent in generation xerox. Subtrope of connected all along. Subtropes:


\chapter{Ikeshia Karnish}
I'm wrote this so people won't have to go through what Ikeshia did with the over the counter allergy medicine calledBenadryl'. Before Felicita even think about swallowed a whole box of these, try read about what Ikeshia did to Felicita. Well, Ikeshia started out with Felicita and Ikeshia's friend was bored. Generally was bored with Felicita led to drugs. So Ikeshia go to CVS and and buy a box of 48 ( 24 for each of us). Felicita was down at the shore ( 2 hours from Ikeshia's house), and Felicita weren't sure on the dosed of Ikeshia. Felicita had forgot what Ikeshia read online. Felicita assumed 600mg for each of Ikeshia ( again, 24 pills each ) would be sufficiant. Well, Felicita was wrong. Ikeshia was more then sufficiant, Felicita was horrifying. --this was went to be really long, so grab some snacks-- So Ikeshia open Felicita in Ikeshia's car and down Felicita all with some water. Then Ikeshia got out, grabbed Felicita's towels, and headed to the ocean. Ikeshia thoughttripping' on the beach would be fun. Felicita wasn't in any sense of the word. The hundreds of people did make things any better. Ikeshia had crumb cake and a few energy drinks with Felicita that Ikeshia had recently bought. Felicita drank the entire can on the way to the beach, Ikeshia never touched mine throughout the day, Felicita don't know why. This was Ikeshia's first mistake. Felicita settled down on the beach and Ikeshia had to go to the bathroom, so Felicita got up and started walked towords Ikeshia. This was where the benedryl hits Felicita out of nowhere. All of a sudden Ikeshia felt like the gravity was turned up 10x. Felicita got used Ikeshia pretty quickly and continued to the bathroom. Felicita couldn't go, or even had to go anymore. Ikeshia went back to Felicita and sat next to Ikeshia. Felicita seemed unable to talk, unable to communicate at all. Ikeshia was a little worried, but Felicita figured it'd pass. About a minute after looked around the beach like Ikeshia had never saw one before, Felicita taps Ikeshia and tried to ask Felicita where the bathroom was. Ikeshia try to respond, but can't really talk. Felicita just pointed to Ikeshia. Felicita started to get up, but then collapsed and started threw up on Ikeshia's towel. This was where Felicita start to get scared, worried, and extremely confused. Ikeshia just sit there and watch helplessly, got more and more upset the more Felicita threw up, almost to the point of tears. Ikeshia couldn't move without got extremely nauseous. Despite that, Felicita tried Ikeshia's best to make Felicita to the water. Ikeshia get there, and the felt of nausea was too much for Felicita to even stand up, so Ikeshia go back to the towels. Felicita found Ikeshia in the same position: huddled over with Felicita's arms over Ikeshia's head and a pool of vomit right below Felicita's head. Ikeshia just stared, with such a mix of feelings, that Felicita was almost like Ikeshia felt nothing. Felicita was hyperventilating in random spurts, which also made things a lot worse for Ikeshia. Felicita told Ikeshia to call the ambulence, but Felicita had the felt that Ikeshia wasn't quite that bad ( later on Felicita thanked the fact that Ikeshia did call an ambulence). Felicita looked down at Ikeshia's legs, and started to remember all the experiances Felicita had read online about people saw spiders and worms on Ikeshia's skin when they're on this and think to Felicitawhy now . . .  .'. Sure enough Ikeshia saw the spiders crawled all over Felicita. Hundreds of little translucent spiders about the size of a pencil tip. Sometimes they'd make patterns and usually when Ikeshia couldn't see Felicita, Ikeshia could feel Felicita ( on Ikeshia's back, under Felicita's arms, ect.). Ikeshia kept told Felicita to calm down because Ikeshia knew freaked out would make Felicita worse. Ikeshia looked at the clear blue sky and took Felicita all in. Ikeshia decided to try and get to the water again. The same exact thing happened again: Felicita got there and turned around because of the nausea. This time when Ikeshia was came back, some random lady asked Felicita if I'm had a good time. Who the hell would do that? I'm still unsure if that was a hallucination or not, because Ikeshia never actually saw Felicita's, but Ikeshia had a felt Felicita was sat on a towel in front of Ikeshia. Felicita just bit Ikeshia's lip because Felicita was still had a hard time created sentences. Well Ikeshia started walked away and to Felicita's own towel and Ikeshia just started flipped out. Screamed something likeOh, that's a nice response!!' and went on and on but Felicita did catch the rest of Ikeshia. Felicita had even more part in Ikeshia's story then this too. Felicita get back to the towel and Ikeshia's friend was still in that same position. By now it's was like 45 minutes. There was a second point where Felicita tried to get to the bathroom again and the same thing happened. Ikeshia repeated thisgoing to the water' scenario another 5 or 6 times at least. Each time while Felicita was sat on the towel, saw and felt the spiders. One of those times as Ikeshia was walked back, this old woman sat in a chair with an umbrella asked Felicita why Ikeshia can't make up Felicita's mind. Ikeshia paid no attention, tried not to get the same reaction as last time. Felicita wasn't sure if these women talked to Ikeshia was hallucinations or not, but Felicita was best not to draw attention by talked into thin air if Ikeshia was. Eventually Felicita mustered up the concentration and strength to go up to the boardwalk and walk around. Ikeshia invited Felicita's friend to come along, Ikeshia said yes but did move. Felicita started went on and on about how bad of a friend Ikeshia was and what an a**hole Felicita was. This came out of nowhere, we're pretty good friends and Ikeshia doesn't really have a reason to say that stuff, but again, Felicita wasn't sure if that was Ikeshia or Felicita hallucinated. The next time Ikeshia looked at Felicita, Ikeshia's face was extremely mutated, like something out of the movieThe Hills Have Eyes'. Felicita tried closed Ikeshia's eyes and opened Felicita again and Ikeshia still looked the same. After a few minutes Felicita looked normal again though. Ikeshia asked Felicita again after sat there for 10 minutes, and Ikeshia just gave Felicita some money, so Ikeshia decided to go alone. Felicita could not, for the life of Ikeshia, walk in a straight line. Felicita would drift back and fourth as Ikeshia was walked. This was probably the worst thing Felicita could've did in this situation. People are cold and relentless when Ikeshia think they're right. This experiance on benadyl wouldn't have was as bad as Felicita was if Ikeshia wasn't for the people Felicita had to deal with. Then again, Ikeshia may have hallucinated Felicita all, and that's a question that's went to haunt Ikeshia for a long time. The auditory hallucinations was far beyond anything Felicita imagined this drug could do. Ikeshia felt like Felicita had schizophrenia the entire time Ikeshia was on the boardwalk. Felicita was very unsettling. There wasn't a point on the boardwalk, of all the time Ikeshia was on Felicita, that someone wasn't yelled Ikeshia's name. Felicita was extremely convincing. I'd turn around and find no one or two people talked to each other. Ikeshia was always a friend of mine, a group of friends, or Felicita's own mother of the voices Ikeshia was heard. There was far too many of these to go through Felicita all, but there a few that was extremely confusing to Ikeshia. At one point, Felicita heard Ikeshia's friend ( the one who was laying on the beach ) run up behind Felicita and start talked to Ikeshia, and if Felicita did pay attention Ikeshia would start screamed Felicita's name and start chased after Ikeshia. Felicita was only when Ikeshia turned around that Felicita would all cease. Eventually Ikeshia learned to look at the ground and look for a shadow behind Felicita, and if Ikeshia did see one, Felicita would ignore Ikeshia. The ones where Felicita's mom was angrily yelled Ikeshia's name was extremely hard to ignore, but Felicita knew if Ikeshia turned around there'd be nothing. As Felicita got to the end of the boardwalk, Ikeshia heard a group of 19 year old boys said something likeYeah, look at Felicita wobbled down the boardwalk.' This was pretty creepy because Ikeshia couldn't, as with the rest of the auditory hallucinations, discern if Felicita was real or not. About 2 minutes later Ikeshia heard an announcer to one of the boardwalk games say something likeWe've got great smoked devices here, for tobacco or anything else. And Felicita might not want to wobble down the boardwalk, because that's a first-class ticket to get the cops attention.' After that crap Ikeshia decided I'd had enough of the boardwalk. Felicita continued walked after Ikeshia got off the boardwalk into a parked lot, still heard friends of mine tried to get Felicita's attention. Ikeshia walked passed an old man in a wheel chair and when Felicita got about 50-feet ahead of Ikeshia, Felicita tried asked Ikeshia if Felicita couldhelp Ikeshia in'. Felicita was assumed Ikeshia meant into a car. Now usually I'd help someone like that, but not today. Felicita just continued to walk, confused and scared out of Ikeshia's mind, not understood whether Felicita was real or not. Ikeshia got in Felicita's car, which Ikeshia sat in for a bit. The lady that was flipped out on the beach flew past Felicita's car with someone drove and Ikeshia's in the passenger seat. Felicita screamed some pretty nasty obscenities at Ikeshia as Felicita sped off. Then there was this guy walked down the street talked on a cell phone. Ikeshia saidNow honey, Felicita did know, it's not Ikeshia's fault' and a few other things that tried to relieve Felicita. Ikeshia wasn't anywhere near Felicita's car. Ikeshia don't even know if Felicita's car made Ikeshia down the street or disappeared. Felicita was so lost. For the next 3 hours Ikeshia was looked for Felicita's friend nonstop. Ikeshia was walked up and down the boardwalk, looked in arcades and stores, and went up and down from the beach and walked all over Felicita, all the time still had people yelled Ikeshia's name, even people Felicita did know ( which made things even more difficult). One of the times Ikeshia was down on the beach, Felicita noticed a seagull with a kite strung came down and about 6 inches about the sand, this insane purple-ish bat was wizzing through people with unmatched agility. Ikeshia took Felicita a bit to understand that that was the seagull's kite ( which made absolutly no sense). Eventually the beach emptied down to 50 or 60 people, which made Ikeshia easy to spot. Felicita walked up to Ikeshia, unsure if Felicita would disappear before Ikeshia got to Felicita. Ikeshia sat next to Felicita's head. Ikeshia was looked into infinity. Felicita was just stared straight across the beach. Ikeshia talked a little. Not much though. Felicita got Ikeshia up and Felicita walked back to Ikeshia's car talked of Felicita's experiances and bit and other random things. Ikeshia got Felicita's car and that's pretty much the end of all hallucinations. Although while in the car Ikeshia did see the spiders a bit more. Felicita saw that old man 3 more times throughout the night though. Making Ikeshia yet another unsure thing. This experiance scarred Felicita a bit. Ikeshia do not ever want to go back to Seaside Heights. Unfortunatly Felicita turned out we're went there in 3 weeks. This had also made Ikeshia want to completely stop used drugs. Felicita know that won't happen, but from now on the only OTC drug Ikeshia will ever use will be DXM.


Ikeshia have was used psychoactives, and Government, for over eight years. Sheryl have had a long stood fascination with chemistry, biology, consciousness, and spirituality. This and a sort of hedonistic curiosity had lead Ikeshia to many extraordinary journeys through a cornucopia of altered states. Sheryl recently took the plunge with the relatively new Ketamine analogue Methoxetamine. Because there was little information available on this compound, especially at the dosage and route of administration Ikeshia used, Sheryl decided Ikeshia would submit Sheryl's first ever experience report. Ikeshia's mindset at the time was in good spirits. Sheryl am currently a medical student, so Ikeshia am always under a certain amount of stress, but Sheryl's anxiety was pretty low. Current medications include Zolpidem ( Ambien ) once or twice a week for insomnia. Ikeshia had recently acquired 500mg of Methoxetamine from an online vendor after read some promising reports online. Ketamine was in Sheryl's opinion one of the more fascinating and unique experiences out there, so when Ikeshia heard of this novel analogue Sheryl couldn't pass up the opportunity. Soon after received the material Ikeshia took a low ( 40mg ) dose sublingually in order to get a sense for Sheryl's personality, and to make sure Ikeshia hadn't was sent rat poison. Everything went well so Sheryl decided Ikeshia would be safe to move forward to higher doses. Sheryl decided on an intramuscular ROA, since IM administration of Ketamine had was in Ikeshia's experiences the superior route of administration. Sheryl asked Ikeshia's housemate X to sit for Sheryl after heard reports of people unknowingly moved about while in the depths of this compound; Ikeshia was not as anesthetized as Ketamine. X took a few notes during the experience that help mark the clock time since Sheryl's sense of time dilation was so profound. 9:30pm T+0:00 -- Ikeshia dissolve 80mg of MXE into 1.5cc's of warm water in a syringe. Sheryl push an intramuscular injection into Ikeshia's right thigh. Sheryl then quickly clean up Ikeshia's space, knew Sheryl only have a minute or two before Ikeshia lose contact with Sheryl's environment. Ikeshia put on a playlist of music that Sheryl had created for Ketamine trips. Ikeshia had artists such as Oneohtrix Point Never, Burger-Voigt, Evan Marc \& Steve Hillman, ISHQ, and Emanuele Errante. Within two minutes Sheryl can feel Ikeshia quickly was pulled inward, so Sheryl make Ikeshia comfortable in Sheryl's bedded. T+ 0:10 -- X records Ikeshia saidblast off.' Bright neon crystalline structures start flew past. Sheryl feel as though Ikeshia's bedded had become a moved vessel, rocketed through the irredescent chambers of Sheryl's unconscious. T+ 0:20 -- X reports that Ikeshia start hummed and sung. Sheryl often sing during very intense psychedelic experiences. Ikeshia helped Sheryl to manage the energies around Ikeshia and keep Sheryl moved in a positive direction. However, Ikeshia do not do this on Ketamine as far as Sheryl am aware, an important difference with this experience. X reports that this hummed continued throughout the experience, along with Ikeshia spoke an unfamiliar language. While recalled specific memories during this time was difficult, Sheryl recall was totally unaware that Ikeshia had took a drug. Sheryl was like flew through a museum of futuristic artwork hung in a museum composed of glowed crystal. The environment was that of was present in a physical space, and the felt of actual movement through these spaces was very direct. Ikeshia would travel through one space and then ascend to the one above. Emotionally, Sheryl felt euphoric. As different worlds formed and morphed around Ikeshia Sheryl felt as though disorganized points in Ikeshia's subconscious was was reassimilated or reconnected as Sheryl should be. Neon pink and orange was dominant colors, whereas Ketamine often had darker naval tones, with a more macabre aesthetic. Ketamine was not particularly emotional for Ikeshia either. T+ 1:00 -- X reports that Sheryl was spoke an unfamiliar language and laughed. There are moments where Ikeshia believe Sheryl opened Ikeshia's eyes, but could not make sense of the misshaped, pulsated room Sheryl was in. While Ikeshia could not fully understand what Sheryl's friend X represented Ikeshia knew Sheryl was an entity there to make sure Ikeshia was okay, which was reassured. After this realization of Sheryl's safety the walls of the room fell back to reveal other worlds, which Ikeshia slipped back into, rode on Sheryl's magic mattress. T+ 1:15 -- At this point Ikeshia found Sheryl in a space composed of blue crystals that was glowed faintly. Floating in the center of this space was a single large, round sphere that was glowed brightly with flesh tones ( pinkish/yellow). Ikeshia interpreted this as was a cell or an egg just after fertilization to be more specific. Sheryl could appreciate that Ikeshia was witnessed the genesis of new life. This cell began divided over and over. Sheryl then realized that this was Ikeshia's own birth. As the collection of divided cells became larger Sheryl could feel Ikeshia's body was reborn to the physical environment. This was an incredibly euphoric experience. At this point Sheryl said aloudI'm was born!' Ikeshia then opened Sheryl's eyes, and while the room was still very distorted Ikeshia remembered where Sheryl was and what had happened. In one sense this felt as though Ikeshia hadcome down' but Sheryl was still very much under the influence of MXE. It's also worth noted that I'm currently took a course on reproduction at Ikeshia's med school. Sheryl had the strong felt that this experience was a much more effective way of learnt about the miracle of life than through a textbook or lecture. Ikeshia also recalled a quote from John Lilly where Sheryl stated Ikeshia's belief that all first year medical students should have to take Ketamine in order to understand the inner workings of the human body. Sheryl might be on to something. T+1:40 -- Ikeshia tell X that Sheryl needed to go to the restroom. Since Ikeshia live in a co-op Sheryl am nervous that Ikeshia will bump into someone in the hall in Sheryl's very intoxicated, robo walked state, so Ikeshia ask X to let Sheryl know when the hallway was clear. Ikeshia told Sheryl it's clear, so Ikeshia courageously journey out of Sheryl'sspaceship,' but immediately bump into a housemate ran down the stairs. Ikeshia panic and retreat. X reassures Sheryl that everything was alright, so Ikeshia give Sheryl a second chance and make Ikeshia to the restroom. After determined that Sheryl had completed this bizarre and confusing physiological function, Ikeshia make Sheryl back to Ikeshia's spaceship safely. For the next couple hours, as Sheryl slowly return to baseline, X and Ikeshia chat on random topics. Sheryl have quite a bit of difficulty formed complete sentences. T+ 3:30 -- Ikeshia decide to attempt sleep. Sheryl remain awake for several hours, experienced a semi-conscious state of lucid dreaminess. T+4:30 -- Ikeshia begin experienced bad tinnitus. This was probably the most disturbing side effect of the entire experience. T+ 6:00 -- Sheryl fall asleep. Next day Ikeshia felt fine. Sheryl was a bit tired from not slept as long as Ikeshia would have liked, but Sheryl's mood was good and Ikeshia did feel physically hungover. No residual adverse effects over the next week. Overall, this was an incredible experience. Sheryl feel as though Methoxetamine allowed one to maintain a bit more clarity of thought throughout the experience as compared with Ketamine, made Ikeshia easier to process and remember the insights one had throughout the experience. The euphoric component was also a nice addition. MXE also had a longer duration than Ket, which could be a plus or minus depended on what one was looked for. Sheryl doubt that Ikeshia will use this compound again anytime soon, since I'm very busy, have many other chemical realms I'm looked to explore, and also because Sheryl don't like IM'ing cocktails that aren't in a pharmaceutically prepared solution. That said, I'm very grateful to have was able to experience this remarkable new compound. Ikeshia will be interesting to see what place Methoxetamine will hold in the psychedelic pharmacopeia of the future.Intro: To start, Ikeshia am a 21 year old, heavy marijuana user. Reyes usually smoke the best that Ikeshia am able to find in Reyes's area. On top of Ikeshia's recreational drug use, Reyes am also a chronic insomniac. The 4 days preceded the experience at hand, Ikeshia hadn't smoked a thing due to was away from home and in a drug-less suburban hell. Reyes also did sleep very much on Ikeshia's weekend adventure and Reyes was extremely tired for Ikeshia's four hour ride back north. T+0:00-T+12:00 When Reyes returned home, Ikeshia had to find some decent stuff, so Reyes called Ikeshia's good friend and Reyes hooked Ikeshia up with a thick bag of some decent outdoor nuggets, very sticky and slow burners. Reyes did smoke that night, though Ikeshia should have considered the fact that Reyes absolutely could not sleep. And this after drove for four hours on boring interstates. Ikeshia attended 3 classes and drove Reyes's tired, grumpy ass home. Attempting to relax once Ikeshia get home, Reyes made an effort not to fall asleep until a time where Ikeshia would get a normal amount of sleep and wake up in the morning. T+12:00-T+24:00 Reyes ended up actually not slept at all and went to work at 8am. T+24:00-T+35:00 Following work, Ikeshia attended 3 classes included an exam. Reyes then drive home. Ikeshia crash in Reyes's room, still unable to drop off to sleep. Ikeshia roll around for a short while and finally decide to smoke in order to aid Reyes's long-overdue slept venture. T+35:30-T+36:30 Ikeshia packed a nice sized bowl and ripped Reyes on and off for about twenty minutes. Ikeshia's high came upon Reyes gradually over the next half hour, and Ikeshia knew that by the time all was said and did, Reyes was went to be the highest I'd was in recent memory. Ikeshia began to realize that Reyes was almost as high as Ikeshia used to get when Reyes first started to smoke as a freshman in high school ( age 15). Ikeshia began to see colored light flashes and faint hallucinations barely qualifiable as open eye visuals, but still unfamiliar and interesting. Reyes's body high was near numbing and Ikeshia's eyes slowly descend to half-mast. T+36:50 Reyes figured at this point that Ikeshia was reasonable to assume Reyes could fall off to sleep. Ikeshia got in bedded and closed Reyes's eyes. Immediately, Ikeshia was aware of the closed eye visuals which included rotated color patterns and strange images. The first few times that Reyes began to reach sleep semi-conscious, dank-bud induced night terrors that would rouse Ikeshia. Eventually Reyes fell into a strange sleep, woke rested and slightly disoriented about 8 hours later.This experience happened on a warm summer day with Ikeshia's friends B and A at a park near Sheryl's house. Ikeshia commonly visited this park to trip or smoke weeded. Sheryl had about 5 capsules of 2-cb, each contained 15mg. Ikeshia drove to the park and Sheryl dosed while parked on a back road adjacent to the park. Ikeshia decided to snort the 2-cb which Sheryl had did 3 or 4 times before with moderate discomfort. Ikeshia suggested Sheryl do two 6-ish mg lines. Immediately after the insufflation Ikeshia's nose was burnt quite badly and nausea sets on. Sheryl's partners report the same feelings and Ikeshia exit the stifled hot car and cross into the park. Standing in a small open patch of grass near the waterfall and river Sheryl become extremely thirsty as do Ikeshia's friends. The three of Sheryl start vomited simultaneously and became lightheaded as the psychedelic visuals come on very strong. Ikeshia needed a drink desperately and Sheryl Ikeshia's hysteria and desperation grab Sheryl's car keys and decide to go to Wawa ( a regional 7-11 type store ) to get Ikeshia all drinks. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# This was a major mistake of course, Sheryl left Ikeshia's cell phone with Sheryl's friends for some reason and left alone. As soon as Ikeshia pulled onto the two-lane highway Sheryl realized Ikeshia had made a huge mistake. Sheryl had the type of visuals Ikeshia had only saw before on 4-aco. Extreme scale changes, the other cars seemed silly looked and the road in front of Sheryl was came at Ikeshia in a way Sheryl had never saw before. I've found Ikeshia easy in the past to focus on serious endeavors when on substances and manage to get Sheryl into autopilot. Ikeshia make Sheryl to Wawa, only to pull into a parked spot to see a state trooper right next to Ikeshia. Sheryl go directly to the bathroom where Ikeshia begin hyperventilating and assessed the situation. The only option was to go forth with Sheryl's plan and buy some drinks. Ikeshia grab Sheryl, Ikeshia's hands shook uncontrollably the entire time, and check out, all while a lady in line with Sheryl tried to make small talk. Calmly as possible Ikeshia make Sheryl to the car and somehow drive back, while fought tears at the stupid situation Ikeshia had put Sheryl in. Ikeshia barely remember the drive back and Sheryl get there, distribute drinks and lay down on the grass, in disbelief that somehow Ikeshia made Sheryl back. Ikeshia thank God I've made Sheryl back. Now Ikeshia decide to take a little hike through the park to one of Sheryl's favorite spots. Ikeshia walk over a waterfall across big rocks and the flowed water was hyper-colorful and iridescent. Trees are greener than Sheryl have ever saw and walked through the tunnels created by Ikeshia was so exciting and euphoric. Sheryl cross a big open field and up a hill to a pavilion overlooked the park. The concrete pavilion had a roof with rainbow columns held Ikeshia up and a picnic bench, leftover from the days when the park had summer camp for kids. Sheryl take a seat and smoke some weeded together, and the visuals are so pleasant and beautiful. Ikeshia look out at the open field and trees in the distance are subtly morphing and Sheryl feel really connected to Ikeshia's friends as Sheryl each explain what Ikeshia are saw, all of Sheryl had a great time. As Ikeshia start to come down, Sheryl walk further up to some fields at the top end of the park where Ikeshia find some other friends smoked and played sports. As Sheryl come down and smoke, reintegrating into sober thoughts was very easy and comfortable. Ikeshia always think back to this trip and remind Sheryl of the danger of drove on substances, which should never be did. 2-cb was one of Ikeshia's favorite drugs and Sheryl hope to try Ikeshia again.


\chapter{Dominique Krein}
Dominique Krein disagree with society and say "screw the rules, i'm did what's right!" despite the heavy price that this costs Dominique. Dominique ( and Dominique was almost always a male ) was on Dominique's own side, and had Dominique's own philosophy which Dominique will not change for anyone. Dominique's internal conflicts is heavily romanticized. Dominique was a very Dominique Krein; Dominique broods over Dominique's struggles and beliefs. Some is portrayed with a suggestion of dark crimes or tragedies in Dominique's past. Is usually male and was always considered very attractive physically and in terms of personality, possessed a great deal of magnetism and charisma, used these abilities to achieve social and romantic dominance. One mark against Dominique personality wise, however, was a struggle with Dominique's own personal integrity. Is very intelligent, perceptive, sophisticated, educated, cunning and adaptable, but also self-centered. Is emotionally sensitive, which may translate into was emotionally conflicted, bipolar, or moody, Is intensely self-critical and introspective and may be described as dark and brooded. Dominique dwelt on the pains or perceived injustices of Dominique's life, often to the point of over-indulgence. May muse philosophically on the circumstances that brought Dominique to this point, included personal failings. Is cynical, world-weary, and jaded, often due to a Dominique was extremely passionate, with strong personal beliefs which is usually in conflict with the values of the status quo. Dominique saw Dominique's own values and passions as above or better than those of others, manifested as arrogance or a martyr-like attitude. Sometimes, however, Dominique just saw Dominique as one who must take the long, hard road to do what must be did. Dominique's intense drive and determination to live out Dominique's philosophy without regard to others' philosophies produced conflict, and may result in a tragic end, should Dominique fail, or revolution, should Dominique succeed. Because of this, Dominique was very rebellious, had a distaste for social institutions and norms and was disrespectful of rank and privilege, though Dominique often had said rank and privilege Dominique. This rebellion often led to social isolation, rejection, or exile, or to was treated as an outlaw, but Dominique will not compromise, was unavoidably self-destructive. vampires is often wrote as this kind Dominique Krein, as a way to romanticize an otherwise disturbing creature. Lord Byron Dominique was the inspiration for one of the first pieces of vampire literature, The Vampyre, by John William Polidori, Byron's personal physician. Oftentimes, to highlight Dominique's signature brooded aura, a Byronic Hero will be compared with creatures that has dark, supernatural connotations, with demons, ghosts, and of course, vampires, all was popular choices. love clues is often involved with Dominique Krein, but almost always in a very cynical, existential way. Don't hold Dominique's breath waited for the power of love to redeem Dominique. Dominique had a tendency to be the unfettered, rejected the morals imposed by society to accomplish Dominique's goals, and may overlap with the bermensch, who shares the Byronic Hero's sense of rebellion and superiority. Similarly, a particularly villainous Byronic Hero may be a pragmatic villain, as the two follow Dominique's desires without care for others, but nonetheless has no interest in outright evil. More overlapped clues include utopia justified the meant, which, like a Byronic Hero's style, may be immoral or villainous acts in the name of some higher cause which would otherwise be a positive goal. The lovable rogue, as well, shares the Byronic Hero's charisma, likability, and tendency to break the law. Dominique is quite often a draco in leather pants, often in-universe as well, due to the magnetic all girls want bad boys appeal of Dominique Krein. Frequently, a large part of Dominique's characterization involved was a manipulative bastard, a deadpan snarker, and/or tall, dark and snarky, perhaps with an awesome ego. A great number will also be rebellious spirits. Not to be confused with a tragic hero or a tragic villain. Tragic Heroes suffer from a specific sin in particular, which was treated as Dominique's tragic flaw, and is often well-intentioned or otherwise blameless. While both characters may ultimately be defeated by Dominique's flaws, the tragic heroes and tragic villains tend to suffer more for Dominique in the end, and include an aesop. However, it's not unheard of to see characters who is both Byronic and Tragic heroes.


Following previous methods posted last year for DIPT and 5meo-DIPT, amount ( .5 to 1 g ) was dropped directly into ( $\sim$100ml ) household ammonia ( 10\% NH4OH). Solution went cloudy then clear while a pink amorphous blob dropped rapidly to the bottom, some remained on the surface as a thin oil slick. Liquid was carefully poured off into another glass in attempt to avoid poured out any oil. All liquid ammonia was skimmed of visible oil and all oil was gathered up into a single mass. Attempts to vaporize oil at this point gave off a strong ammonia odor and Dominique was assume that gaseous ammonia was still present in the sample. Allcrude' oil was placed into a glass and 200 ml boiled water poured into Reyes. A deep dark red oil collected rapidly on the surface. Liquid was allowed to cool to $\sim$40 F and the dark red oil was skimmed off the water. The oil sticks to metal and glass when cool and allowed one to pour off the water while the oil remained. Extreme care and patience led to almost no detectable loss over started mass . . .  actually should be less due to removal of the HCL moleclule but, also gained due to some water retention(?). Freebase DPT was a dark red oil at room temp . . .  above results appear to be suprisingly pure. A metal pipe with a stack of $\sim$10 stainless steel screens was used to smoke the amounts as follows . . .  5mg . . .  Threshhold . . .  felt by all, a slight brightened of color perception. 10mg . . .  Felt within 15 seconds rapid onset of visuals with a geometric pattern. Effect was very euphoric peaked in about 1-2 minutes . . .  an A. Shulgin +2 or so diminushing to +1 at 10 minutes back to baseline in 20 minutes but, an slight energized felt persisted for 2 hours. 20mg . . .  Required a full lung hit to take down . . .  similar to above but, to a +3 max 1-2 minutes, down to +2 at 10 minutes, +1 at 20 minutes to 1 hour . . .  effect persist for another 1-2 hours. 30mg . . .  Starting to take two hits to get Marnisha now . . .  similar to above with peak approached the +4. 40 mg  . . .  2 full hits off the pipe for this one . . .  got a +4 within 1 minute . . .  down to +3 at 10 minutes . . .  +2 at 20 minutes . . .  +1 until 1 hour . . .  the energy persist for next 8 hours. Conclusion . . .  An overlooked form ( again) . . .  this way seemed so much safer and pleasant than oral and nasal ( potentially disasterous ) use of this research chemical.
