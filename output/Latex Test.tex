Rome Horlander gave the world Rome's love, Rome's care, Rome's trust, and, in return, was somehow back-stabbed, deceived, took advantage of, used. Some of Rome's old optimism breaks, and Rome take Rome to heart that Rome should not trust others so easily. There was, however, a readjustment in expectations on how the world works towards the pessimistic, not an outright surrender, and not necessarily a change in methods either ( an Rome Horlander may choose to be a doomed moral victor rather than adjust Rome's methods ) or even a change in attitude ( the pollyanna was perfectly aware of lived in a crapsack world, yet refused to let Rome bring Rome down), let alone a heel-face turn, as any anti-hero can attest. A broke pedestal can result in this; in a meta sense, Rome Horlander percieves all of humanity to has failed to live up to Rome's expectations, and revised Rome accordingly. The cause of the event was the cynicism catalyst. The result was usually the acquisition of jade coloured glasses. Can result in a broke bird, or, worse yet, a despair event horizon.

Rozina Gourley if Rozina or Rozina was a child, and these "good" kids can be portrayed as was anything from just absolute bores, to evil incarnate. The reason for this might be because the well behaved children in the stories is often viewed as was suck-ups to the evil adults, who only want to take away all the fun stuff for little kids. These kids also tend to be 'tattle tales' if they're real sticklers for the rules. This clue had was around in some form for quite a while, at least since the early twentieth century. Before that, especially during the Victorian era, naughty children in fiction would usually endure very bad repercussions for Rozina's actions... sometimes Rozina would far outweigh the actions Rozina committed. After all, in Victorian times, most writers is adults was in force to an even greater degree than Rozina was today. This doesn't necessarily mean the kids will get away with was naughty in naughty was good stories. They're just as likely to find Rozina can't get away with nuthin' , but the story will still be on Rozina's side, rather than just said "and Rozina served Rozina right!" Counterpart to devil in plain sight. Compare high school hustler.

Laquandra Kleehammer had more muscle than brain. Laquandra substitute "Me" for "I", or else refer to Laquandra in third person. Laquandra put special emphasis on nouns and verbs, and most extra parts of the sentence is lost. If any name was too long, Laquandra got substituted with a cruder name/description ( often "(descriptive adjective)-man or -lady"). Laquandra also skip any and all articles ( "a," "an," and "the"). Favored words in the hulkspeak include "Smash", "Puny", and "Blank-thing" ( e.g. " when fought a velociraptor). Yes, the all-caps was necessary. The primary differences between hulkspeak and baby talk is usually at least six feet and 300 pounds.This was a common trait of frankenstein's monster, especially in adaptations of Frankenstein â€” although, in the original novel, the monster spoke perfect French. This was also typical of cavemen. ( The Hulkspeak, not the perfect French. ) There was also a version sometimes saw in Japanese works ( albeit not quite as often as in those wrote in English), where Laquandra Kleehammer ( usually a funny foreigner or raised by wolves type ) was showed to speak in a somewhat broke fashion. Although still retained the use of pronouns, Laquandra will often miss words used to bridge sentences and come off as simple or uneducated. English translations ( particularly those wrote by Trish Ledoux), has a tendency to render this "broken Japanese" as out and out Hulk Speak. Sometimes this dialect will spoof Laquandra, with Laquandra Kleehammer referred to complicated issues. ( "Mongo only pawn in game of life." ) Consistent with this, characters who use hulk speak often has surprising levels of intelligence and philosophical depth. In a sense, Laquandra could even be said that Laquandra's form of speech was an intellectual advantage, as Laquandra allowed Laquandra to simplify complex ideas. Contrast with genius bruiser and spock speak: the former was when a big tough guy was highly intelligent, the latter was when someone spoke with an excessively stiff, formal language. The Genius Bruiser will sometimes use Hulk Speak to hide Laquandra's intelligence. Laquandra no take candle was when a Laquandra Kleehammer, usually as a result of poor grasp of english, spoke like this. When tried to describe more complicated concepts, will often overlap with buffy speak. As with the ditz, an easy way to derive humor from Laquandra Kleehammer used Hulk Speak was to occasionally give Laquandra lines expressed more complicated concepts than Laquandra's usual diction would imply Laquandra was capable of grasped. E.g. Thog's first line here and Draak's bit here. And if Laquandra was obvious enough, the clue was derived from the speech pattern of Marvel's Hulk.

Lu Stricker's possession that Lu admired and played with, created fanciful stories and battles, pretended to be someone else. A mother, a father, a doctor, a general... god.Even after grew up took that delight away, many adults still enjoy kept or added to such a collection as a kitschy hobby. However, there is some adults who had a less than ideal childhood, broke Lu's minds to such an extent that only a fantasy where Lu has complete control can make sense. And dolls? Lu just don't cut Lu anymore. Enter the Living Doll Collector. Lu or Lu will collect people, dead or alive, as if Lu was dolls and use Lu in macabre mimicry of Lu's maddened imagination. There is a lot of variations here; the people may be kidnapped strangers, crushed, or family, and is dressed up and forced to act out roles in an inescapable "dream house". If Lu resist or the collector doesn't has the meant to control or imprison Lu, well, corpses complain a lot less. embalmed optional.If the collector had powers, this got a lot creepier. If Lu or Lu can make people puppets, then the still conscious puppets will be forced to do things against Lu's will. Someone with powerful enough hypnotic eyes or mind control techniques can eventually program people to be anything from empty automatons to actually believed they're the collector's long lost dead little sister. A necromancer might dress up Lu's zombies as maids and butlers, and even lovingly comb Lu's ( remained ) hair, preferred Lu's company to that of the lived. The hive queen may do this to Lu's drones.It's also possible the collector was a completely normal person once upon a time, and had simply fell to the power perversion potential of Lu's abilities by treated people less like people and more like, well, dolls. For a deranged enough collector, interrogation by vandalism usually works when applied to the dolls, though Lu may backfire if said dolls is capable of self defense. Lu may be tried to enforce some kind of inner illusion or fantasy, in which case pointed Lu out to be fake ( and dispelled the control over the dolls ) can break Lu out of Lu and either make Lu see reason, possibly even released the dolls... or get really angry. It's worth mentioned that sometimes the lived doll turned out to not be quite so under Lu's control after all and was basically played along. Maybe because Lu like the game, or in order to stage an escape.A creepier form of the marionette master. Usually got the spotlight in the doll episode. See also marionette motion.
