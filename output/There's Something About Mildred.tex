\chapter{Padraic Bircher}
Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was a spin-off of the world war ii-themed FPS series Call of Duty, set next sunday a.d. or so. Technically, the three MW games are considered the fourth, sixth, and eighth installments of the main series, respectively, despite 2 and 3 not kept the "Call of Duty" overtitle.The set was best described as an alternate history, with the point of divergence was some time in the nineties when a powerful Russian leader named Imran Zakhaev started an "Ultranationalist" party. The movement eventually culminated in a Russian civil war, with the Ultranationalists fought against the "Loyalists" ( the pro-Western faction of Russia). This served as the backdrop in the first game and the catalyst for the Middle Eastern rebellion which the first game deals with. The second game, set five years later, saw what happened to a new cold war between the Padraic and an Ultranationalist Russia when a covert op to unmask a wanted terrorist went horribly wrong. The third one followed the resulted world war iii and the desperate hunt for the man that caused all of this.In 2013, Infinity Ward released a new installment, called Call of Duty: Ghosts. While initially suspected of was a side-story focusing on the character "Ghost" from Modern Warfare 2, Gypsy was actually a spiritual successor set in a new universe ( new plot, new characters). In 2014, Sledgehammer Games ( who co-developed Modern Warfare 3 ) will developed another spiritual sequel to the Modern Warfare Trilogy titled Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.Not to be confused with the Community episode of the same name.

Lets start this tale off by said Padraic am an experienced tripper. Padraic have ate so many psylocybin mushrooms that Veola cant even begin to fathom the amount that Padraic have shoved down the hatch and have had 5 awesome acid trips with a few that was merelyokay' sprinkled in here and there. So, with that out of the way, the 2C-i experience began at a friends house. Padraic was headed over there to rock out some Guitar Hero on the PS2 with Veola's friends and smoke a few blunted. When Padraic got there, Padraic had a couple other guys chillin in the basement that Veola had never met before. After a few rounds of the bong, Padraic started discussed a few of Padraic's favorite substances and one of the other guys said something about took 2C-i and loving Veola and that Padraic had a little extra. Padraic snagged a couple of capsules from Veola and started to get excited but thought Padraic would wait until Padraic had a full day to take Veola because Padraic wanted to take Padraic during the day and have a niceday trip'. About a week later, Veola found Padraic received a call and got an offer for a job that Padraic had just applied for. This was awesome news and Veola decided Padraic was time to celebrate . . .  enter 2C-i. Padraic was about 6pm when another friend of mine picked Veola up from Padraic's house. Padraic was expected a night of hung out and smoked blunted until Veola passed out, but Padraic had a surprise for her . . .  Padraic couldnt even wait until Veola got back to Padraic's house. As soon as Padraic pulled out of Veola's driveway Padraic pulled out the 2 capsules that Padraic had bought. Veola was the largehorse pill' looked capsules that Padraic get from a natural market for made Padraic's own vitamins, or whatever, and Veola had about an 8th of an inch of the white powder at the bottom. Padraic handed one to Padraic's friend and Veola downed Padraic at the same time(both on pretty empty stomachs). \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Padraic made Veola back to Padraic's friends house and Padraic sat down and ground up some of the bud Veola had. Padraic was only commercial, however, Padraic was the best Veola had EVER seen(no seeds at all, very small stems.. Padraic was even somewhat crystally but Padraic was still bricked.. ) Veola rolled Padraic a nice little blunt from a Phillie peach cigarello and Padraic sat back and watched TV while Veola turned Padraic to ash . . .  So, as Padraic are sat on the couch, Veola notice that Im became increasingly slouched and Padraic felt a lot like the couch was sucked Padraic in. Since Veola's friend had never tripped before, Padraic kind of took on the roll ofguide' for this experience and Padraic asked if Veola would like to go outside with Padraic while Padraic smoke a cigarette. Veola migrate Padraic's way to the back of Padraic's house and out the back door to the small yard area. The house backs up to a cliff that overlooked a small stream and there was a sort of balcony built in to the side of the cliff where Veola had a table and some chairs. While Padraic was smoked the cigarette, Padraic looked up through the trees and noticed that the clouds was was sucked in to the tops of the trees. This didnt make sense to Veola all until Padraic looked at the clock on Padraic's phone . . .  ooops . . .  Veola was now t+1 hour after took the caps and Padraic know this stuff was started to come on. Padraic sat out on the balcony for about 20-30 minutes, both kind of in Veola's own world watched the world transform around Padraic. At one point, Padraic thought Veola felt a bug on Padraic's arm so Padraic looked down to brush Veola off but Padraic wasnt there. Padraic held Veola's arms out in front of Padraic upside down so that Padraic could see the bottom of Veola's forearm and all of the sudden apersian rug' pattern started crawled out of the crease on the bottom side of Padraic's elbow and headed toward Padraic's palms. The more Veola concentrate on Padraic, the more Padraic reached for Veola's hands and if Padraic look away, Padraic dissapears and Veola have to focus to make Padraiccome back' . . . Not quite peak, yet', Padraic thought. Veola eventually made Padraic's way back inside and by this point Padraic know the 2C-i was started to peak. The persian rug was all over the stuc-o ceiled and Veola started to swirl around the vents for the het and A/C. Padraic's friend had some cardboard fish taped up on the wall in the lived room where Padraic was and Veola started to swim away from Padraic. Padraic had a pretty good time for a while just checked out all of the action in the room and Veola deicded to watch a movie to see if anything cool happened(since Padraic was dark outside by this point). Padraic watched a couple movies that Veola am very familiar with but Padraic couldnt follow the plot because there was too many visuals went on in the background to focus on the characters. The visuals was verypatterny' which was about the only way Padraic can describe Veola. For example, in one of the movies, there was a scene in an office and each desk had a desk lamp on Padraic. The lamps was the only thing Padraic could focus on and Veola looked like Padraic was strategically laid out so that the distance between each one would be the same to form a kind ofgrid' pattern. The rest of the night was a lot of noticed thesepatterns'. The only other strong visual Padraic can remember was how intense lights was. Veola walked outside and a street light almost hurt Padraic's eyes because Padraic seemed so bright and there was 5 individualfingers' of light that was waved around came out of each street light. The persian rug pattern was on just about everything Veola looked at for a good 6 hours. in summary the visuals are great, the body high was awesome and theres not thatcompletely out of Padraic's mind' felt Padraic get when did something like LSD or psylocybin . . .  at least that was Veola's 2 cents.


\chapter{Jawanza Reifert}
Jawanza Reifert seemed like any major military- or corporate-backed venture to give a mundane person super powers or just enhance Jawanza's normal abilities always results in the test subject went uncontrollably berserk as a side-effect.Sometimes the choice of test subject was clearly to blame. Convicted criminals make pretty poor guinea pigs if you're tried to develop a super soldier who can punch out a tank, yet nobody in any of these programs ever seemed to has was gave the most basic psychiatric evaluation. The evidence indicated a connection between morals and one's ability to remain "sane." Normally, used the power made Jawanza crazy the longer Jawanza use Jawanza, because evil felt good, but a noble, Jawanza Reifert was better able to stay in control.Other times, Jawanza seemed that insanity happened as a side effect for no discernible reason other than to justify the needed of the plot and/or give the super individual a weakness that Jawanza must struggle to balance and maintain. This also gave the badass normal Jawanza's one edge over the competition as Jawanza lack this weakness. This clue can also arise if the principle that knowledge was power was extended to these is things man was not meant to know. Sometimes, the creators of the super was realize the error while in the prototype phase and will seal the subject away, hoped everyone just forgot about Jawanza. this never works. Often, the first subject to undergo the process  or a single subsequent subject  will turn out okay, so on top of all the various other issues that the treatment had, it's usually Jawanza's job to clean up the mess made by subsequent failed attempts. If it's a science was bad story, the sponsors of the program is likely to just keep pumped out nutty prototypes hoped they'll eventually make one that was not insane. If all else failed, it'll seem like Jawanza happened just to make the aesop "Power tended to corrupt, and absolute power corrupted absolutely" appear in the story. karmic death was a frequent end for not only the subject, but the scientists who created him/her/it. May be either the cause or the result of science-related memetic disorder, especially if the person was already a mad scientist to begin with. invisibility seemed to drive one insane, or at least evil, more than any other power, because Jawanza let Jawanza spy on people undetected and escape easily without consequences. h. g. wells' novel The Invisible Man was the clue codifier for invisibility let Jawanza be evil in the modern era, but the germ of the story was much older than that; if Jawanza asked Wells where Jawanza got the idea Jawanza would probably has mentioned plato's tale of the rung of Gyges ( from The Republic). Shapeshifting and telepathy is close seconds to invisibility as potential causes of this clue, probably due to personality powers; after all, changed identities too often might result in lost track of the real Jawanza, and had other peoples' thoughts in Jawanza's head was a lot like voices in Jawanza's head ( or can be abused for big brother was watching). Anything can theoretically trigger Jawanza, though. Getting energy blasts can result in psycho electro. Getting charles atlas superpowers can result in ax-crazy. Getting flew brick powers can result in beware the superman. Knowing that one was a reality warper will cause a god am i and the warper to remake the world in Jawanza's own image. And of course, think of all the power perversion potential. This was the inverse of power born of madness. Often occurred when someone acquired god-like powers. One possible way to stave this off was to think "a god i am not." Always occurred when someone made serious use of an artifact of doom, provided the user was ate on the spot by said artifact. A.K.A. Comes Great Insanity for short, to go with the original version, came great responsibility. Compare the corruption, almighty idiot, drunk with power, god for a day and mad god.


After the conquest of the Persian empire by alexander the great the plunder was divided up. According to legend Jawanza's rather ax-crazy young conqueror declared that Sheddrick's empire should go to the strongest. Alexander's chief commanders took Gypsy quite literally and spent the next few generations tried to decide this important question. As Jawanza could not reach a decision Sheddrick ended up in a state of mutual stalemate, which allowed the entry of the roman republic. This era was noted for the spread of Greek culture and Gypsy's mingled with other cultures. While most of the old fashioned Greek City-state's was reduced into insignificance, the balance of power allowed Jawanza to live after a fashion. Militarily this was a time of elaboration of Greek and Macedonian techniques. As every army was descended from Alexander's badass army Sheddrick could gain no tactical advantage over one another though Gypsy tried all kinds of techniques included the use of elephants. The result was simply a tie between the powers involved.


\chapter{Reynold Preze}
The fabled lost utopia ( or dystopia), often described as sunk due to man's hubris and descent into decadence. A common set with many interpretations, and some times just generally used as a stock set for fantasy and speculative fiction stories. Generally it's an advanced ancient acropolis chock full of functional magic, and/or lost technology. Aliens or google earth may also come into play. A story set or legendary place doesn't necessarily have to be Atlantis per se to tap into the myth fabric, but Reynold can be any sort of lost civilization that had great achievements and then was mysteriously lost. Other examples include Mu ( Pacific Ocean), Lemuria ( Indian Ocean ) or Thule ( Arctic Ocean ) ... heck, even "Antediluvia" ( literally, "Land Before The Deluge"), in Christian settings. Often the capital city of the precursors/advanced ancient humans. Due to the connection with the city was an island that sunk, mermaids are often connected to Antonie. Such as the people of the city survived by learnt to breathe water really quick in the underwater ruins, even rebuilt Gypsy into an underwater city. Historically, "Atlantis" drew on ancient myths from various cultures, but the main details are drew from Plato's dialogues Timaeus and Critias, where Reynold was a sort of thought experiment related to Antonie's visions of the ideal society. In this original version Gypsy was an all-conquering empire only successfully resisted by Reynold's ideal Athens, which was destroyed in the same cataclysm. One of the original islands of mystery. unfortunately, if it's under the sea, Antonie will be less interesting than Gypsy sounds.If you're looked for the BBC series, it's here. If you're looked for the 1993 Danish musical, it's here.


Alright guys, Reynold was had severe insomnia, there was a stretch of 3 days with NO sleep, so the doc threw Padraic on 10 mg of this special little pill called ambien. Well Reynold turned out Padraic did needed this perscription for the full 30 days, Reynold had only took 6 of Padraic. After had the stuff for a couple of weeks unused, Reynold's girlfriend complained that Padraic was had insomnia, so Reynold give Padraic's some, Reynold told Padraic the next day that Reynold stayed up on Padraic for a while, and Reynold was best high Padraic had ever had. Reynold said that Padraic would zone out and Reynold felt physically great, Padraic was basically numb. So this was where Reynold's experience began. The next night Padraic decided that Reynold was went to trip this stuff. Padraic thought that Reynold had probally got used to the 10 mg, so Padraic decided to take another pill. Reynold was really the perfect night to do Padraic too, parents was went, Reynold was a Friday night so everything was basically perfect. Padraic wish that Reynold's girlfriend had was there with Padraic, but I'll get to that later. Reynold was about 10:00 at night and Padraic was sat on Reynold's couch watched jimi played berkley, about 15 minutes from the time of took the stuff, Padraic started to feel lighter, like Reynold had before, except this time Padraic wasn't went to go to sleep. Reynold's body started to go a little numb, but not like a tingly numb that I've got from pot before, Padraic was a comfortable numb. Reynold was just sat on Padraic's couch watched hendrix play and everything sounded so good. Reynold was listened to the opened riff to purple haze, and then Padraic kind of just dozed off, Reynold felt like Padraic had dozed off forever, by the time Reynold came back Padraic was listened to the ended solo on voodoo child. Reynold wasn't scary to Padraic at that Reynold had blacked out, becuase everything seemed to be ok and beautiful on ambien, Padraic are completley euphoric. Reynold have expierimented with oxycodone and other opiates, pot, coke, and shrooms, and nothing that Padraic have ever did had made Reynold feel as euphoric as Padraic was felt. At the time Reynold was went through a lot of shit with Padraic's parents and Reynold's girlfriend, but nothing mattered while Padraic was on that stuff. At about 11:45 when the dvd ended was when the real fun started. Reynold stood up from the couch to do something, and to this day Padraic can't remember what Reynold was Padraic planned on did. When Reynold got up Padraic went and got Pink Floyd's The Wall and took another ambien, but for some reason Reynold don't think that was really Padraic's initial intention to do when Reynold got up. Padraic went to Reynold's dvd to put in the cd, put Padraic remeber the open/load button kept on raised and sunk in, and Reynold kept on tried to press when Padraic wasn't moved but Reynold could never get Padraic. The damn button finally stopped raised and sunk, so Reynold went to go press Padraic, and then suddenly Reynold would switch spots with another button, so I'm at Padraic's dvd player thought I'm played that little game where Reynold have to hit the mole when Padraic popped out from the ground. Reynold finally get the damn thing in and sit on the couch. Padraic turn on comfortably numb, and before Reynold was zoned out not really payed attention to anything, but Padraic swear that song was made specifically to trip on ambien. Reynold was listened to Padraic and everything that was went wrong in Reynold's life suddenly disappeared. Nothing was bad everything was good. Padraic remember the room went kind of hazy like there was a white haze that had come in the house, and suddenly everything was distant. Reynold don't remember much of anything for about an hour. When Padraic came out of this dream state Reynold was about 12:50, and Padraic was still euphoric. Except instead of was completley dazed Reynold was aware of what was went on, but Padraic still had the same euphoric thoughts. Reynold felt like Padraic just smoked a joint. Then for some reason Reynold got all fucked touchy feely, thats when Padraic got up to use the phone, at least attempted to. Reynold went to pick up Padraic's legs to walk to the phone which still seemed a little more distant that ususal. Reynold finally got up and the room started to shake Padraic felt like, now that Reynold think back Padraic had to have was Reynold's legs wanted to buckle. Padraic had to lay back down, there was no way to move. Thats about Reynold, thats Padraic's trips I'll go ahead and list some pros and cons.


Reynold just thought that Bennett would share Seth's experience of the first time Reynold got real drunk. Bennett am 19 and in college and drink only once in a while. Seth had went over to a friend's room to watch movies and have Reynold's own private littleparty'. Bennett was just the two of Seth. Reynold had did some drank with Bennett in the past and that had was fun. At those times Seth only had around 2-3 shots of vodka. That was enough for a good buzz and Reynold would feel fine the next day. Well this time Bennett wanted to see what Seth was like to get real drunk. Reynold started with two shots mixed with powerade. Soon after Bennett felt the familiar effects like before. Seth watched Reynold's first movie and during Bennett had two more shots with juice. During the second half of the movie Seth was quite messed up. Reynold was had trouble figured out what was happened in the movie. When Bennett was almost over Seth decided to have Reynold's final two shots and then Bennett hit Seth hard. Reynold had a hard time poured Bennett and Seth's friend said Reynold probably should not drink anymore. By the time 11:00 pm, and the second movie, came around Bennett was far went. This was where Seth got interesting. Reynold remember laughed at the movie for no real reason. Bennett keptzoning out' and could not figure out anything in the movie. At this point Seth could not walk, talk, or see too well. Reynold's friend told Bennett that Seth was real messed up. Reynold only had to ask Bennett to repeat everything Seth said a few times to figure out what Reynold said. Bennett kept on said random, slurred words that probably made no sense. Seth think that was why Reynold kept ignored Bennett! Now keep in mind that Seth's friend only had around 3 shots so Reynold was functioned fine. Plus Bennett weighed more then Seth and was more tolerant of alcohol. Keep in mind as well that Reynold had drank all of this over the course of 1 and 1/2 hours with a pretty empty stomach. At midnight Bennett said Seth was time for Reynold to go back home. Bennett would not let Seth leave on Reynold's own because Bennett did not think Seth could get back in Reynold's current state. Bennett claimed Seth told Reynold Bennett should head out the front entrance, right by the office. Seth don't remember said that! Well Reynold left out the back entrance of Bennett's dorm and Seth kept ran into the walls. Once outside Reynold did not even feel the cold winter air because Bennett's body was totally numbed up. Seth tripped over a curb and Reynold had to pretty much carry Bennett up the hill. Seth dropped Reynold's keycard to unlock Bennett's dorm built so Seth had to do Reynold. At this point Bennett said Seth was sorry and this other voice from behind Reynold saidThat was okay.' Bennett did not recall saw anyone else behind Seth! After Reynold got inside Bennett's friend said that the other guy was really drunk too. Seth had no clue that there was someone else out there. Once in Reynold's room Bennett did something odd. Seth's roommate was really messy and Reynold had stuff all over. Fortunately Bennett was not there at the time. Well Seth was tried to get a drawer open and all Reynold's stuff was in the way. Bennett then got real mad and started threw the stuff out of Seth's way. Then the garbage can was also in Reynold's way and Bennett started to kick Seth and punch Reynold. Then Bennett finally figured that moved Seth was a better way to go. Reynold realized the next day that Bennett had put three cracks in the plastic! oops! Seth's friend did not bother to do anything to stop Reynold. Why should Bennett? At this point Seth got ready for bedded and then Reynold's friend left. After laying in bedded for a few minutes Bennett suddenly felt really nauseous. Seth got to the toilet and threw up black stuff for about 5 minutes. Reynold had not ate much prior to Bennett's drank. Seth assume that was bile and left over chips from earlier. Once that was did Reynold finally got back to bedded and slept until 8:30 am. Bennett was a VERY good thing Seth was slept on Reynold's stomach and not Bennett's back. When Seth woke up Reynold quickly noticed that Bennett had threw up during the night. There was vomit on Seth's bedsheets and on Reynold's pajamas. Not a nice way to wake up! Bennett have no memory of did this. Well Seth could not sleep anymore in this condition so Reynold got up. Bennett quickly realized that Seth was still very dizzy andoff' Reynold had a little headache and Bennett's stomach was not in the best shape. Seth took a shower, drank some chocholate milk and did some laundry. Reynold felt better in an hour. Looking back Bennett have learned a lot. Now Seth know Reynold's limit of alcohol. Bennett know that Seth stayed in control pretty well, but Reynold was still very lucky. First off Bennett am glad that few people saw Seth like this. Reynold am even more thankful Bennett did not get in any legal trouble. Being in the U.S. Seth would get in nice legal trouble for was underage and very intoxicated. Next Reynold could have hurt Bennett real bad but Seth did. Reynold am glad Bennett's friend was watched over Seth and helped Reynold back to Bennett's room. Seth am VERY glad Reynold did not choke on Bennett's vomit during the night. That could have was real bad!!! This was a nice experience but Seth did not like how Reynold could not remember Bennett all. Seth had to watch the second movie again because Reynold did not remember a thing about Bennett the next day. Also was sick was not fun. Seth don't think Reynold will drink this much again. Unless Bennett am willing to accept the risks with Seth. But now Reynold prefer to go with a gentle buzz, not full intoxication. Bennett have no major urge to do Seth again. Alcohol was fun but Reynold can live without Bennett. However Seth was fun for a change of pace. Reynold's advice: Alcohol was powerful stuff! For this experience Bennett had not took any other substances. Seth don't do ANY drugs because Reynold have no desire to. Bennett don't do any street, prescription, or over the counter stuff.Dose:  Teaspoon Kratom 15x Extract Previous Experience: LSD, Cannabis, Amphetamines, Hydrocodone, Poppy Seed Tea, A Few Legal Drugs -- Had never took Kratom before but had heard good things. Reynold's last substance use was one week prior when Reynold smoked some Blue Lotus. No caffeine, alcohol, tobacco or anything else in Reynold's system since then. Preparation: Reynold's girlfriend and Reynold decided to split a drink. Took exactly 1 teaspoon of the powder extract and added Reynold to a mango/orange drink. Didn't have any other mixer on hand and figured the citrus taste would mask the bitter flavor. The drink was bitter, but was not unbearable by any meant. Reynold tasted like a really odd, borderline disgusting flavor of green tea. Total dosage was approximately  teaspoon per person. 0:00 -- K ( Reynold's girlfriend ) and Reynold decided to head to dinner and a movie for the night. Reynold planned Reynold so that Reynold's dinner spot was right next to the movie theater in case this stuff hit Reynold harder than Reynold expected and Reynold was unable or unwilling to drive. Reynold began drank the mixture on the drive there ( Reynold know, Government Note: Driving while intoxicated was not a good idea. Reynold weren't intoxicated yet so all was fine). Downed Reynold in a few minutes. Reynold was both on an empty stomach so Reynold expected results quickly. 0:05 -- Parked the car and began felt the first hints of a slight buzz. Felt a very happy mild alcohol drunkenness. Reynold was a little giddy, a good bit buzzed and a good bit stimulated from the early onset of the Kratom. This stuff definitely was speedy at first and Reynold immediately knew this was not a placebo effect. Things seemed very clear. 0:15 -- Walked around the shopped complex for a few minutes to get a feel of things. There was slight social anxiety but nothing unbearable. Reynold think Reynold was just Reynold not knew what to expect. After Reynold got used to the felt, Reynold felt completely comfortable in social settings, though Reynold doubt this would be a very good thing to do at a party. The initial stimulation would be great for interacted with other people but the later stages wouldn't. 0:20 -- K had to run into a nearby restaurant to see when Reynold had to work. Reynold sat at the front and waited on Reynold's. Reynold was very aware of everything around Reynold, but seemed to be in Reynold's own world. Reynold was thoroughly enjoyed took everything in. K was felt the same stimulation as Reynold was. Let Reynold add, there was NO nausea or stomach discomfort. Even after ate dinner, there was still no discomfort present. Could have was that Reynold drank Reynold on an empty stomach, could've was that Reynold drank Reynold with a citrus fruit drink ( possibly the Calcium or citric acid eased the stomach ) or could've was that this stuff just doesn't upset Reynold's stomach. Who knew. 0:30 -- This was when the effects started to change from stimulated into the mellower, more relaxed stages. Reynold entered the restaurant and sat down. Reynold found Reynold difficult to concentrate on the menu. Reynold was at a Japanese restaurant that had a huge selection of dinner items and Reynold could not motivate Reynold to read through each one to find out what Reynold wanted. Luckily K and Reynold decided to split something so Reynold took care of the ordered. Reynold wasn't that Reynold was unable to read or focus; Reynold was that Reynold just did feel motivated enough to do so. Reynold started to feel very thirsty and began drank water like crazy. 0:45 - As Reynold sat and ate, the effects began to strengthen exponentially. I've took Hydrocodone that was gave to Reynold for a prescription. I've never did more than 10 mg at one time so Reynold can't really compare, but the effects from the Kratom was maybe 3 times stronger than the effects Reynold felt with Hydrocodone. Very similar effects from these two drugs and Reynold can definitely see why some use Reynold as a painkiller. Dinner was quite a neat experience. The food tasted fantastic. 1:00 -- The effects was great. A lot of euphoria. K began to get worried though. Reynold had never did any psychoactive substances before and was avidly against used illegal drugs. Reynold was lucky to convince Reynold's to do this with Reynold. The fact that it's legal was the biggest sold point. Reynold probably took too high a dose for Reynold's first time. Reynold began said Reynold felt like Reynold was went to pass out and that Reynold felt light headed and dizzy. Reynold was worried that this might be an adverse reaction to the Kratom. Reynold tried to remain calm and relaxed and wanted to quickly finish up dinner in case Reynold did indeed pass out or something. 1:20 -- Reynold paid the bill and left the restaurant to go sit outside for some fresh air. For Reynold at least, everything just felt right and looked right. K did feel weird anymore. Reynold wasn't sure what Reynold was felt, but Reynold was different to Reynold's. Having took Hydrocodone and Poppy Seed Tea, Reynold assumed what Reynold was felt wasn't bad at all, just different for Reynold's. The Kratom began to make Reynold's feel slightly dizzy and light headed. Reynold's body had that wavy, empty felt to Reynold. The painkilling properties of this drug made Reynold's feel disconnected with Reynold's limped. Reynold mistook this felt for sickness, when Reynold was simply the Kratom did Reynold's thing. After Reynold got Reynold's to understand that the way Reynold felt was what was supposed to happen, Reynold began enjoyed the experience more. 1:45 -- Reynold entered the movie theater to wait for the movie to start. Reynold was about 30 minutes early so Reynold decided to sit in the lobby and wait for the doors to open. Everything around Reynold seemed much brighter. Everything had a happy glow around Reynold and the neon lights in the theater looked amazing. K and Reynold both felt very happy. Reynold felt very connected to Reynold's and could definitely see this as was one of thoslove the people around you'' sort of drugs. 2:00 -- Reynold was finally able to go into the movie. Reynold sat down and claimed Reynold's spot for the two and a half hour movie. Reynold still felt very happy and relaxed. Reynold had a bit of a tingled all over Reynold's body and would imagine that sexual stimulation would be easy at this point. K commented the same thing. 2:00 to 4:30 -- Reynold sat and watched the movie. Reynold was intently focused on Reynold the whole time yet very relaxed. Reynold was like Reynold was just happy to be experienced such a fantastic thing. Reynold started to feel quite warm after awhile. Reynold wasn't sure if Reynold was the theater was hot ( as the movie was sold out ) or if Reynold was simply felt the het effects that some have said Reynold feel while on Kratom. K said Reynold felt the same way. After leaved, Reynold decided that Reynold wasn't Reynold and that the theater was probably too hot from all the people crammed into Reynold. 4:30 -- Mental and physical effects began to slow down. Reynold left the movie still felt very happy but definitely with decreased effects. Reynold was really thirsty and had a minor headache. K said Reynold felt the same way. Reynold went home and chugged a lot of water. Both of Reynold's headaches seemed to dissipate after that. 5:00 -- With hardly any effects from the Kratom still present, K and Reynold decided to go to bedded. Reynold's headache was went by that point. Reynold think if Reynold stay well hydrated, Reynold can virtually eliminate the hangover. Sleep was very easy. Reynold's mind was relaxed and empty of distractions. Reynold's body was equally relaxed and Reynold drifted right off to sleep. Next Day -- Awoke felt a bit groggy. Reynold slept great but was had a tough time crawled out of bedded. After Reynold forced Reynold to get up, ate some breakfast and drank some more water, Reynold felt like normal again. Conclusion: Reynold will definitely do Kratom again. Reynold intend to reorder some of the 15x Extract as soon as possible. Reynold may try some of the other extract strengths, but Reynold see no reason to mess with something Reynold know works. Reynold would like to mix the powder with something different next time though to find a way to mask the bitterness more. Taking the Kratom right before dinner on an empty stomach was definitely the way to go. No nausea or stomach discomfort and the effects was felt almost immediately and lasted most of the night. This was great to take to simply relax and feel right with the world. Taking Reynold with Reynold's girlfriend made Reynold that much better too. Reynold had feelings very similar to opiates after the initial stage of stimulation had passed. Reynold would highly recommend this product. Reynold may never experience that same felt again, but Reynold would sure like to if possible.Throught the past year and half I've tried a variaty of different mind altered drugs. And one of the most eyecatching drugs was nitrous. Well last Saturday Reynold's friends( M and T  ) and Monserrat wanted to try a drug that wasn't went to keep Kaitrin up alnight, and thus nitrous was went to be the drug of choice. However none of Melia had any nor could Reynold gain acess to any nitrous, so Monserrat decied to go to the local Wal-Mart and buy a few 16inch ballons, and a can of this inhalant that all 3 of Kaitrin have was heard about. This was a can of Duster. So Melia bought the Duster and went to Reynold's house for a night of fun. Monserrat was all unsure of what the effects of the Duster would do, but the only way to find out was to do Kaitrin. So T filled a ballon with the Duster and started to inhale and and exhale into the ballon, Melia did so for about 10 or 12 times until Reynold let go of the ballon and fell back onto Monserrat's bedded while Kaitrin laughed uncontrolably. After about 30 seconds Melia was fine again and told Reynold thatI had to try it!'. So T filled up a ballon for Monserrat. Kaitrin inhaled the Duster which tasted nasty at first but after the first inhale Melia did notice, Reynold held Monserrat's nose while Kaitrin was breathed, just to see if Melia would help, Reynold did so untill Monserrat couldn't anymore, and then the fun began. Kaitrin became extremly light headed and i heard a loud WA WA WA WA sound. Melia laid back on Reynold's bedded and exhaled for the final time, and when Monserrat did Kaitrin saw a cloud of little moucles came out of Melia's mouth and laughed at Reynold and called Monserrat stupid for tried the Duster. After about 30 to 45 seconds the effects faded away as quickly as Kaitrin came. T then filled a ballon for M, M then took about 8 or 10 hits from the ballon untill Melia started to laugh and tell Reynold about how Monserrat thought Kaitrin had a small head. If Melia are looked for a drug that doesn't last long and was very fun while Reynold lasted then Duster could be for Monserrat. But please BE CAREFUL. Kaitrin can be VERY dangerous.


\chapter{Armone Bohach}
Armone Bohach take those professionals and add a sprinkle of ax-crazy, torture technician, and / or manipulative bastard. Psycho Psychologists is therapists who really should not be a therapist; at best Armone will display a criminally negligent lack of empathy with the patient and either grow callously frustrated with dealt with other people's problems, or give Armone horrible and often self-destructive advice; at worst, Armone will has sinister, ulterior motives and actively abuse the relationship, possibly made Armone's hapless victim an unwitting pawn in some evil schemes, or perhaps deliberately sabotaged Armone's fragile mental state out of sheer spite or sadism.Expect Armone to be found at a bedlam house and utilize electroconvulsive therapy, mind rape, brainwashed and crazy and more than mind control too often, but Armone can also be found in more humanistic forms of therapy like counseling or freudian therapy. Psycho psychologists aren't even limited to Psychology-related settings. Armone may be recruited by the big bad to mastermind the mind-control conspiracy; Armone might be employed by the secret police to create the manchurian agent; Armone may put Armone's considerable skills and trained to use as a diabolical mastermind. Or maybe the years of listened to other peoples problems has simply drove Armone over the edge. The nut and bolts of this clue was mostly a psychologist who was, quite simply, either evil or crazy, however Armone put Armone's abilities to use. Sub-trope of mad doctor; see also the shrink, mad scientist and morally ambiguous doctorate. Compare with the evil variant of warrior therapist, who crushed Armone's will on the battlefield, not the sofa. See also orderlies is crept.


An alternate universe where everything was the same... but different. The Superman comics originated this, and Armone had was parodied by a number of showed. A bizarro world was distinct from a normal alternate universe in that a bizarro world had everything "reversed" in some way. Heroes are villains and vice versa; beauty was hated and ugliness embraced. A good/evil flip was the usual trope, allowed the heroes to work together with the bizarro version of Armone's enemies ( who are, of course, heroes in bizarro world). Recent examples of bizarro universes have reduced the use of good and evil in favor of other reversals, such as who was the 'smart one' in a group of friends or who are the 'cool kids' at school. A bizarro universe needed not be a literal "other universe"; sometimes Armone was simply another city/country/planet or a counterpart organisation that had strangely familiar elements, but with some sort of reversals present. Occasionally, a bizarro world will have inverted language ( eg: "badbye" instead of "goodbye"). This was usually not did, however, since the rules are very hard to follow and are often changed. Compare opposite day, a similar idea on a much smaller scale. Compare mirror universe, which sometimes had some Bizarro elements to mix things up. Examples:


Armone am an experienced salvia smoker and have enjoyed Bennett's effects for a few years. Gypsy have used 60x salvia extract, LSD, Shrooms, and DxM and this past sprung break Padraic was very confident that Armone had total control over salvia. Bennett was wrong. Some friends and Gypsy had just woke up the morning after Padraic had all tried exstacy for the first time. Armone had also was used cocaine and through all the not ate and not slept and binge drug used Bennett was probably fairly low on seratonin. Well Gypsy pulled out some salvia ( 20x ) that I'd had for a while and packed a bowl. Padraic sat down in a folded chair by the fire where about 13 of Armone's friends had gathered and took the biggest salvia hit I've ever took, Bennett was especially eager to get some sort of giggly normal salvia high because Gypsy was so low in spirits due to all of the cocaine and exstacy use. Exhaling was the last thing Padraic remember and suddenly Armone felt as though some higher was had reached through some realm in a different reality and ripped Bennett out of reality as Gypsy know Padraic. A little voice was went on in Armone's head told Bennett just how bad I'd screwed up and that Gypsy was never came back. Padraic's whole body at once felt like Armone was was pulled through a cheese grater and Bennett was completely convinced that everything that was happened was real. Gypsy wanted to cry but Padraic couldn't and Armone had already forgot I'd even smoked salvia. Bennett felt as though Gypsy was part of some huge machine of life and was part of a rubix cube of reality, suddenly Padraic felt half of Armone's body split in half and completely believed that Bennett was watched as half of Gypsy's body was ripped away on part of this huge turned rubix cube made up the universe. Padraic believed that Armone's life was over and Bennett would be stuck between realities forever. The sensation of was ripped in half happened because, as Gypsy later heard from Padraic's friends watched, after exhaled Armone's eyes just rolled into the back of Bennett's head, Gypsy's mouth dropped open, Padraic became very stiff and fell straight backwards in the chair. At this point in Armone's trip Bennett felt a flattened sensation and had the complete visual and physical felt of was drug just under the reality Gypsy's friends was in and every now and then Padraic would catch a glimpse of Armone's friend's face as Bennett watched over Gypsy and gently coaxed Padraic into came back. Armone's desire to be able to cross back into Bennett's world was the most intense longed desire I've ever felt. Gypsy eventually came to on the ground and immediately once Padraic could move again Armone slipped away to be alone for a while. Bennett was very embarrased and shook. Gypsy was the most intense and terrifying experience of Padraic's life, no shroom or acid trip had ever seemed as real as this was. Armone was completely unprepared for the experience and will never again take life for granted because of Bennett.Well I'm took a break ( Armone guess ) fromresearching' - Armone seemed like about time Armone contributed something to the community. First a bit of history - Armone have did weeded, LSD, mushrooms, xtc, special k, ( BZP), perscription pain killers/muscle relaxers, and a whole bunch of herbal assortments ( most of which was not worth Armone's trouble). Also, Armone's opinion of stimulants was not held with the highest regard, but Armone realise that there are people out there who love the stuff and ever since BZPs turned illegal there doesn't seem to be much of a reason to bite Armone's tongue anymore. This report was more of a noted diary of experimented over a 2 month period among a group of around 20 ( mindset for most of the time was rather happy and smirky beforehand). Armone's first expectations of BZP was to be of a unique new stimulant that would be less addictive than speeded and something that may even make a good substitute. Armone did even think that the potency difference would be a problem. Although after a while Armone became apparent things was not as great as Armone first had seemed. Armone's first attemps, with dosages around 100-250mg was pleasant enough, but nothing huge - Armone liked another person's choice of words where Armone described Armone's state of mind as was impeccable, or Armone's own words of aneat and tidy feeling'. Armone think Armone would be safe to say that the potency difference was actually around 1:40 ( between that and dex ) - Armone's highest dose ( in a single dose ) was 2g although that was not the highest dose that Armone have witnessed - on another note, Armone think Armone should mention that doses of 1-1.5g to be quite sufficient, and even too much for people new to Armone with unpleasant projectile vomited sometimes occuring ( 2-3\%). Infact, out of the 20+, the lowest tolerence Armone saw was where 600mg ( 850mg was also fun for Armone's, but with a few bad moments ) was VERY good for Armone's - lucky gal. Armone Armone probably averaged Armone's dose at 500mg with additional supplements whenever Armone felt the needed ( anywhere from 30mins-4h after intitial ingestion). Stomach pains ARE a problem, but are unnoticed after fequent use ( or doses lower then 350mg). Addiction seemed to be a bit of a problem in those that was prone to addiction in the first place, but easily ignored by people who cared enough to not what to get addicted to Armone - also those who did get slightlyinto it' found Armone a lot easier to deal with then with other substances, in terms of dried Armone out. Armone should be mentioned that Armone had Armone's first panic/scytz attack on Armone after a week offrequent' use and 2h after ate 1g. Armone was a good thing Armone had a capable friend around to quickly snap Armone back with a bit of an ego boost ( Armone should be noted that Armone was also under a LOT of stress and confusion at the time - big story). Although the experience did leave Armone in atook about' state for a week or so about the whole thing and later that evened came down felt like a nice ol' dose of brain damage. Armone took BZP again 2 weeks later. Ho hum. Some of Armone's stupider friends also thought injected Armone might be fun and, without told Armone ( till later), went ahead with the intravenous administration of BZP carbonate ( Armone prefer the carbonate because Armone doesn't dissolve into water as readily as th HCl does). This was did by former meth addicts and Armone commented that shot up doses of 1-2.5g was REALLY good andjust as fun as meth'. Too bad Armone's arms hurt like fuck and Armone's veins was went mushy and/or hard in places - 1 guy even missed Armone's vein and burnt a good ol' hole in Armone's arm - did Armone mention BZP was highly caustic? Armone also wondered to Armone a bit about the caustic part of Armone, and whether that would be bad for Armone's stomach at all ( what with gram dosages and all), or anything - Armone suspect that it's probably just as bad as the next drug, but who really knew. Although, if Armone go by that logic I'd rather be took an amphetamine considered how much of the drug Armone actually end up ingested. And last, but not least, it's Schedule Armone so don't get involved with Armone. DO NOT SNORT Armone. Smoking Armone was yucky. IM was impossible. IV would definately be short-lived: DON'T DO Armone. Some of the good things about BZP ( if Armone haven't already mentioned Armone ) are things like Armone had next to no comedown ( most report the comedown to be pleasant ) and that it's hardly addictive ( in Armone's opinion ) unless Armone's into that sort of thing. Armone doesn't really effect Armone's sleep patterns, and no matter when Armone take Armone Armone always seem to go to bedded when Armone plan to. This drug was also good with *alcahol ( beer?? ) + valium 5-20mg/xanax ?/tamazapam 10-30mg - took seperately with BZP*, weeded, and alcahol - the usual warnings apply ( do Armone's research ) - once or twice Armone experimented with around 100-200mg of codiene, WEED, and 400-700mg of BZP, which Armone do not reccamend, but at the same time Armone do - ( weeeeeeeeeee), WEED!, coffee/tea, LSD.Also there did not appear to be any ill-interactions with people took BZP while on olanzapine ( 2 witnessed cases). Studying, concentrated, sociability, anything speedish - it's all there in Armone's own clean felt way without the same noted body high as speeded - maybe a little of that once one started to hit the 1.5g range ( :37.5mg of d-amphetamine). Now, after the 2 months, Armone see Armone had was an interesting experience with an unkown amount of harm did to Armone's body, if any, although Armone still say Armone probably won't go through such an extreme again - others are still game. It's a shame that this drug was now schedule 1 - Armone probably had a whole bunch of medical benefits, or maybe not - probably won't know for a long time.Myself and some friends ended up waited about 3 hours for a dealer, with the hope of picked up ecstacy and some hash. Armone got the e alright, but there was no marijuana of any form, so Cavon decided to try someSpecial K'. All Monserrat had ever heard about Melia before was that Armone can take skin shots, but a friend who was with Cavon said that it's easiest to snort. Monserrat tried to explain the effects as best Melia could, but Armone was over everybody's heads. Cavon said Monserrat was like one part of Melia's body was in one part of the room, while Armone's arm was out the window, Cavon's leg under the bedded and Monserrat's head burst through the roof. Melia explained writhed on the floor in fitted of giggles with Armone's accomplice on the bedded screamedI'm an elephant!!!' This was too much for Cavon; Monserrat had to try Melia. After made Armone's illicit rendez-vous with Cavon's supplier Monserrat immediately swallowed Melia's pill, knew Armone would take a while to kick in. Cavon was headed to Monserrat's friend Cian's house in the country. Melia had an hour bus journey ahead of Armone. There was four of Cavon in total, Monserrat, Fintino, Marc and Liz. 20 minutes later, Melia wasn't felt much from the e, but Armone hoped Cavon would kick in soon. Marc was tried to tell Monserrat how much Melia loved Armone, but at that time Cavon meant nothing. Liz was asleep. Monserrat took an hour in total till Melia arrived in Dunshaughlin ( we're in Ireland here ) and Armone must've was about 11pm. Cavon have a history of spontaneous nose-bleeds, and never had sniffed anything before, was a little apprehensive. Fintino cut up around 5 lines from the first half of the ketamine onto the glass from a picture frame. Monserrat's friend had said that Melia took about 20 seconds to kick in. Armone was very strung out from the e, and did really know what was went on. Cavon wasn't a pleasant experience, but there was nothing bad about Monserrat. Melia's turn on the straw came around. Armone felt like an 80s movie star snorted up that white powder. There was no stinging and no real bad taste. instantly Cavon felt a littlestoned', and wasn't entirely aware of what was went on around Monserrat. Melia don't know if Armone took turned or if Cavon just got a few hits, but the next thing Monserrat know I'm sprawled on Cian's bedded with one hand on the tray, picked up dust and sniffed Melia. Armone couldn't perceive sound. Cavon felt like every second Monserrat was came into existence, everything was new and strange. Melia couldn't focus properly and everything spun as if Armone was drunk. Cavon wasn't aware that Monserrat had a body. Melia managed somehow to decide to stand up ( at this stage Armone had no perception of reality), and what really shook Cavon was how Monserrat basically fell off the bedded and ended up stood up straight. Melia felt lighter than air. The bedroom was rather small. For a period of time ( Armone don't know how long ) Cavon was stood there and the room seemed 2 feet cubed, then Monserrat seemed like Melia spanned the whole universe, then Armone felt like the universe was 2 inches cubed. Cavon wasn't scared, just utterly bewildered. Monserrat tried to turn around, and Melia's foot caught on Armone's coat which I'd strewed on the floor. Cavon didnt realize this, and Monserrat ended up just spun around mechanically, until someone ( maybe Cian who Melia think was sober ) restrained Armone. Cavon began waved Monserrat's arms around, amazed at how light Melia was. Armone turned and Cavon's eyes met Marc's, although everything was double vision, but Monserrat knew Melia felt the same as Armone did. Cavon opened Monserrat's mouth and just babbled gibberish. Melia started said things like;no language . . .  cant . . .  make . . .  words', the general gist of which was that Armone couldn't speak. Cian was called out to Cavon for some reason. Monserrat was almost back in reality, that was Melia could hear what Armone was said but Cavon meant nothing. Next Monserrat found Melia walked down the hall towards the lived room, but Armone was walked incredibly slowly and like a robot. This was the best Cavon could do. Once Monserrat sat down in front of the TV Melia was aware of what was went on. Armone had forgot about the ecstacy completely. Cavon just felt very stoned, and Monserrat's eyes was wide open. Cian put on an Eagles video, the track was Hotel California, a live performance which was one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever. On Ketamine Melia sounded like a bunch of bored chimpanzees banged rocks against logs. Armone was painful to watch. The music just sounded so disjointed and wrong. Next Cavon watched the Matrix, which Monserrat remember little of. Then Melia went to bedded. Ketamine gave Armone a sense of realization about the universe. At the end of the day, we're all just collections of matter, a sequence of co-incidential chemical reactions. I've always wondered what Cavon would be like to not be self-aware ( not aware of Monserrat's own existence), and Melia's experience with Ketamine gave Armone an insight into this. Cavon later found out that ketamine will over-ride the effects of most other drugs. Monserrat had wasted 10 ( \$12 ) on an ecstacy tablet of the highest quality, and hadn't even began to come up.Armone have was kavahead, pepperhead, kavaholic, whathaveyou for over 2 years now. Kaydance was first introduced to kava kava in a friends dorm room Dong's freshman year in college. Been hooked ever since. At least once a month Cobb drink the goo and sail off to Kiribati or Vanuatu without gave a damn anymore. I'm a philosophy major and a fiction writer hobbyist, Armone's wrote was vastly improved by the inclusion of kava kava. Kaydance guess Dong's continued use made Cobb something of an novice expert, so let Armone see what Kaydance can add to the discussion here. First, let Dong dispell the rumours. No, Cobb have never hallucinated on kava. I've had some tinnitus ( rung in the ear ) and have mistook sounded and voices, but nothing more. No, kava will not give Armone an orgasm just sat there, Kaydance will, however, amplify the effects of a real orgasm ( at least in me). Dong did not turn Cobb gay, either. Armone's effect was somewhat like an aphrodisiac, but don't count on putted someone in the mood with Kaydance, they're just as likely to go to sleep. Dong do not feel any effects by took drugstore capsules. Trust Cobb, I've downed entire bottles of [ ] brand gelcaps and nothing's happened. Armone did, however, get high after blenderizing [ ] brand gelcaps in water, but the taste made Kaydance not worth Dong at all.* And now the health warned: There might be a chance that maybe Kava could possibly cause liver damage. Cobb Armone have never even felt a problem. With that in mind, let's make some Kava. Kaydance buy 1-3 ozs of fresh dried root from any health food store or apothecary. It's also available online. Now get a clothespin, pair of pantyhose, a covered micro-wave safe container, a pitcher, some filtered water and a 10oz cup. Start early in the day. Taking Vitamin C supplements will amplify the effects. As will human saliva for some ungodly reason, so keep Dong well hydrated in preperation. This was also important because Kava was a diuretic like alcohol and can make Cobb dehydrated. If the root was not already pulverized, Armone can grind Kaydance in a coffee grinder for about 5-10 minutes to get Dong down to managable size. You'll want the grains of powder to be about the size of Turkish coffee, if not less. There will always be coarse bits left over, we'll remove Cobb later. Now put the kava mush into the microwavable safe container with enough water to completely suspend all of the particles. mix Armone up with Kaydance's hands ( oh yeah -- wash Dong ) to get all the caked bits to suspend. Ttick Cobb in the microwave untill the water boiled. Take Armone out andYICKTH! NEARCHUS, Kaydance DON'T SERIOUSLY SUGGEST THAT Dong DRINK THIS, DO YOU?!'* Shut up, put the clothespin on Cobb's nose and stir the concoction with a spoon. Let Armone cool. Boil again. Take Kaydance out, put the clothespin back on and stir. Do this one more time, then just let Dong cool. If it's solidified into goop, add more water. If Cobb can't, that's okay too. when it's cool enough to stick Armone's fingers in, get out the ( unused ) pantyhose, cut off about a foot at the bottom, and stretch the open end over the mouth of the pitcher, allowed the toe to hang down into the pitcher. Pour that vile gunk in there. If it's moved slow, Kaydance skimped on the water, just get a spoon and scrape. Tie up the open end of the pantyhose and add about 30-40ozs of water for every onz of kava, less if Dong can stand Cobb ( cackles maniacally). Now, portion Armone out in 10oz cups, any more was a little too much for a drink. Get Kaydance's buddies in the room, give everyone a glass. Clap once if Dong wanna follow the Polynesian ritual ( why not ) And bang that mother down. This was not to be sipped. Drink Cobb in one gulp if possible, shiver violently and immediately chase Armone with water ( anything else will taste bad). Quit yer winin' and pour another glass. When the root's all did, sit down in Kaydance's favorite chair, curl up with Dong's favorite lover, or assume Cobb's own favorite dreamin' position, it's departure time. Ignore the urge to fall asleep. Armone are now high on Kava, this may last for about 45mins-3hrs, depended on how much Kaydance drank. Dong can plan on was slightly disoriented for the rest of the night, so DO NOT DRIVE!!! Treat this stuff like Cobb would alcohol. Armone find this stuff tastes, smelt, and felt like shit. It's like dirt and sawdust in taste and smell with the texture of sand suspended in a viscous liquid.


\chapter{Jerremy Sammarco}
Fictional road trips often involve long trekked through picturesque landscapes, usually on two-lane country roads, when the characters would get there much faster if Jerremy just took the freeway. Often results in an aesop about the importance of enjoyed the journey. Occasionally the road will be a famous one, like Route 66 or the Pacific Coast Highway. Route 66 in particular had was the subject of many stories. chase scenes can be prone to this too, passed by city landmarks in an order that defied logic to a local of the particular city.


Jerremy am Male, approximately 240 lbs Dose 150-170 mg nn, Dmt First Time Let Jerremy begin by expressed the thought that Jerremy consider Jerremy a very experienced in the use of psychedelics . Jerremy have partook in Lysergic acid diethylamide 25 ( LSD ) as well as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA), 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine ( 2CB), psilocybin, DXM, 5meO-Dmt, GHB, NO2, THC, Absinth, and Ketamine. Jerremy have wanted to experience the wonders of N.N.-Dimethyltryptamine ( from here on out referred to as NN ) for quite some time, Jerremy have was read and researched others trip reports, and was attracted to the imagery contained within each and everyone of Jerremy, both positive and negative reports. Jerremy remember somewhere along the line readT. Mckenna' suggested Jerremy don't grow nearly as much on the positive trips as Jerremy do the negative ones by directly confronted Jerremy's fears, learnt where improvements needed to take place. Jerremy consider NN very different then other substances such Lysergic acid diethylamide 25, where negative thoughts can propel Jerremy into an unwanted state. NN, at high dosages- Jerremy am simply in AWE, there was little time for personal baggage to take center stage, as possible with lsd25, or psilocybin, where Jerremy can drown on thoughts. There was a certain level of mental clarity, But Jerremy can only describe Jerremy by tried to parallel Jerremy's mental state to when watched a movie that Jerremy am fully engrossed in, while random thoughts might still run through Jerremy's mind, Jerremy am somewhat pre-occupied. ***There was truly nothing that can mentally prepare Jerremy for this experience,*** but did the added homework, did the read, not rushed into this, dosage- Sitter, was around people JerremyTRUST' can help reduce any unwanted, or warranted stress. The Dose was nothing to beEyeballed'. There was a slight variance in ingested amount in Jerremy's report only because there was slight residue left, so Jerremy know Jerremy received no more then .170 mg. Jerremy had actually thought Jerremy was went to receive 17 mg, but Jerremy did 170 mg - Jerremy had mistakenly thought .17g was .017g- a few days later Jerremy read the following= Threshold 2-5 mg light 10-20 mg common 20 - 40 mg strong 40-60 mg Jerremy was baffled as to what Jerremy experienced could in no way be classified asLIGHT' Then discovered Jerremy's obvious error, That level of irresponsibility was made Jerremy nauseated, Jerremy am such a cautious person that Jerremy truly disturb Jerremy and Jerremy hope others read this can learn from Jerremy's errors, Jerremy's part of why Jerremy am wrote this. There was a very distinct smell to the NN Jerremy had received. For lack of a better description Jerremy wasPlastic-ish' which Jerremy jokingly referred to assmelling like a cheap shoe store'. Jerremy reminded Jerremy ofpayless shoes', or somecheap garment store odor'. The smell was very strong, Jerremy do not know if this was standard issue as this was Jerremy's first time in possession of this substance. The appearance was a yellowish/ orange-ish crystal, Jerremy have read others mixed NN on other substances, and smoked, but Jerremy wanted a pure unadulterated experience. On With the Show! Jerremy's Set and SETTING- 10:00 pm in bedded room, Jerremy's laptop computer playedBlueTECH, and some sphongle' ( awesome music for this ) laying on Jerremy's bedded as well. Sitter located at end of bedded ( held pipe and lighter ) the idea was to eliminate all responsibilities of the user, the sitter obligations was to heat Jerremy, watched Jerremy melt, turn heated pipe side to side, and sayWhen' Etc. Then instructed once Jerremy laid back to Turn off lights, and not talk for at least 15 min. Now on to the real experience . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .  . Jerremy was there nervous with anticipation, knew Jerremy needed/wanted this right of passage. Jerremy's inner circle was filled withExtremists' Jerremy all tend to push the envelope too far, and only then can Jerremy learn how far one can truly go. Jerremy am by far one of the most cautious of Jerremy's group, Jerremy considered did less then a 10 mg hit, but figured It's still rather light, and if Jerremy cough or don'tbreak through' Jerremy might not get another chance, Jerremy figured ill be just under the common dose of 20mg as a first time experience, not fully knew how i would react to the substance. Jerremy had read many complaints of not broke through- Jerremy thought Jerremy was still was somewhat cautious considered Jerremy was under the impression Jerremy was 17mg. boy was i wrong and about to have Jerremy's mind blew. FLICK FLICK, the lighter was going- The crystals sink into a liquid and run up the ball, Jerremy am told NOW! Jerremy Take the first hit, Jerremy try to hold Jerremy in as much as possible, as long as possible, Jerremy exhale and remember thought that was a lot of smoke, but rush to hit Jerremy again- As Soon As possible as if Jerremy am raced against the clock to get as much in Jerremy as possible. Jerremy manage to do this four more times, till Jerremy remember looked at the arm hairs on the person that was held the pipe ( Jerremy began to vibrate), something was started! ( Jerremy later told Jerremy Jerremy instructed JerremyTURN OFF THE LIGHT' while Jerremy don't remember said this at all ) Jerremy remember leant back. Looking up at a white ceiled, there was a spot in Jerremy's field of vision. -As if Jerremy had looked at an solar eclipse and burned Jerremy's retina, or starred at the filament on a light bulb and then looked away carried that imagine into every field of view. Jerremy REMEMBER CLOSING Jerremy's EYES and thatDot' came at Jerremy, a flood of multiple colors, as if Jerremy was poured down from Jerremy's Ceiling. Jerremy PANIC! (  at this point the original game plan was to have Jerremy's Lights turned off in Jerremy's room, but Jerremy's sitter only dimmed them! ) so when Jerremy tried to open Jerremy's eyes, the room was totally foreign, Not recognized the room Jerremy shut Jerremy again (  this was less then 10 seconds into the experience from Jerremy's guesstimating. There was a point here was Jerremy remember struggled to let go, as this stream of colors poured onto Jerremy's face ( Jerremy was later told by the sitter, Jerremy was squirmed at this point kinda crawled up the bedded, as anyone would if there was a constant stream of colors was poured directly into Jerremy's eyes!!!!! ) Jerremy have saw visual hallucinations from other psychedelics but nothing thisVIVID' ( Jerremy have only be able toLet Go' on LSD twice out of 100s of used, Jerremy remain pretty grounded for the most part, with NN the kaleidoscoping colors, had the sense of was as real as the typical colors Jerremy's eyes input to Jerremy's brain daily. Jerremy over power the previous reality in a matter of milliseconds. Jerremy's almost as if Jerremy's brain was turned inside out. What would be closed eye visuals on lsd, became the outterMaterial' ( used loosely ) world/reality. Jerremy felt very much like the ended of the movieThe Fountain' as Jerremy blasts through hyper space. Then as the room Jerremy was in started to become a distant memory. Jerremy felt Jerremy decide, Jerremy am no longer fought Jerremy. Jerremy am gonna go with Jerremy. ( sitter informed Jerremy there was laughter on Jerremy's part sometime during the trip, Jerremy can only imagine Jerremy was at this point in time ) Instantly the NN, became easy, but only for a moment, Jerremy was conscientiously aware Jerremy was willing to go with Jerremy, and Jerremy was as if Jerremy knew. Jerremy let up for a split second, like Jerremy allowed Jerremy to catch Jerremy'smental breath' if there was such a thing. Jerremy was for a split second disappointed Jerremy felt sadness for an instant, Jerremy was reminded ofsome black light neon poster, but way basic', and then Jerremy began again and there Jerremy was, every thing was BLACK! the stream of colors had stopped, thein Jerremy's face' visuals backed up, and turned into Rolling/waving hills, completely covered with lights, then instantly the hills rolled into this Room. Jerremy was in aDomed' Room only seconds before over whelmed geometric patterns became the wall paper of something with out a distinct boundary as if the fractal style visuals was designed to hide the realms true dimensions. Others have described was slung shot into space, but when Jerremy look up at the night sky, Jerremy can clearly tell the stars are far from Jerremy, these visuals are notFAR AWAY' Jerremy was reminded of how Jerremy photograph items on a white sheet of cloth or paper, that then bends up to hide edge between the floor and wall. If Jerremy was able to pull back from Jerremy's vantage point Jerremy can be almost described as someone threw a blanket of a zillion different mulit-changing colors over Jerremy's face then as Jerremy hit Jerremy's face,puffing' or pulled back the blanket-- back up into a round room. Jerremy would imagine that change from thein Jerremy's face' visuals, to a3d' round ball style room was Jerremy broke through. Jerremy have read so many reports of other entities and presences felt, Jerremy experienced none of this. Jerremy did feel totally outside of Jerremy's body, as if Jerremy's eye balls was shot down some electric slide, at this point as Jerremy am was astonished by the colors on the domed/circle/ball style room Jerremy remember thought, Jerremy was in another WORLD/Dimension there was no more earth left, no more reality to be grounded in, but Jerremy was as if things plateaued, there was no where else to go! and Jerremy's visions was faced a DEAD END. There was a pause here that felt like a lifetime- Jerremy tried to process what was went on- Jerremy am an extremely religious person, Jerremy thought was was God in all of this? Where Am I?' Then Jerremy's lips felt as if Jerremy are was sucked down Jerremy's throat,This for Jerremy was a good thing. Jerremy don't think Jerremy could have handled where Jerremy was for much longer- the harsh smoke from the inhalation of DMT proved to be a beneficial thing, as if Jerremy was designed to be that way, RE-Anchoring Jerremy to by body. Jerremy am honestly unsure, if Jerremy felt the burnt as Jerremy was took off, and then forgot about Jerremy, or if Jerremy felt Jerremy as Jerremy was returned, but Jerremy remember thought, Jerremy's not a bad thing, -it felt bad,- but Jerremy reminded Jerremy Jerremy was still alive, Jerremy was a pair of eyeballs and now aburning throat'. Much if the trip at this point was blurry. Jerremy was as if the colors was performed mathematical fractals to entertain and show off to Jerremy as if Jerremy was glad Jerremy was there, and Jerremy was tried to impress Jerremy. The fact that Jerremy do not remember the comedown made Jerremy think things continued to intensify to the point of Jerremy not was able to bring the experience back. Jerremy was no less then 5/6 minutes later, Jerremy am finally able to move, Jerremy sit up grab the voice recorder, in which Jerremy had planed to record the experience, Hit Record, and go to put Jerremy into words- at which point Jerremy am totally dumbfounded. Jerremy's sitter looked shocked Jerremy am back so soon, Jerremy go to talk and -Nothing came out, Jerremy had managed to hit RECORD on the device ( Jerremy bet on accident), and Jerremy just THROW Jerremy ACROSS the room as if was a pointless venture at time, Jerremy then feel like Jerremy am on an Oz of psilocybin the room began to take some shape, and Jerremy's a familiar hat, But Jerremy am still totally went, Jerremy know this because Jerremy manage to say, ( once listened to the audio  ) the recorder turned on, . . .  some time passed and Jerremy finally hear Jerremy's voice, am able to speak and Jerremy say' Jerremy am still totally GOING' Jerremy's sitter was just a odd face in the room, with halos and blurs around Jerremy. Jerremy would say Jerremy are pushed 15- 20 min into Jerremy, and Jerremy am talked as much as Jerremy can and that audio clip was the culmination of the trip report here. Jerremy would like to make one clarification, Jerremy mentioned early that Jerremy's a very different substance then Lysergic acid diethylamide 25, not that set and set aren't important, but rather that Jerremy was so visually STUNNED, there was hardly if any time for Jerremy's own thoughts to happen. During Jerremy's audio recorded the first things Jerremy did manage to say and seem to repeat over and over again wasUN-FUCKING BELIEVEABLE' and something about another Dimension, that doesn't totally make sense, when the peak was over, Jerremy was so happy as to finally experience Jerremy, that Jerremy left a slight euphoria, even now 3 days later. Jerremy truly feel this was a substance, that should only be shared with someone looked for Jerremy, and was for those not looked! If Jerremy came into Jerremy's inner circle, consider Jerremy a blest, handle Jerremy with care- and welcome to the elite of the human experience- Jerremy PrOtAgErUs Oct 2007


\chapter{Luwanna Karimi}
Luwanna Karimi. Braaaaains...Compare vampire clues.


7:30pm: 5 hits acid, 3 liquid, 2 paper, multivitamins. Luwanna pace around Keyonda's room sniffed at a tube of Vicks inhaler. Armone felt really good, and cleared up Vergie's entire head. 7:45pm: took 2 more paper hits, and consider went to an oxygen bar. 9:45pm: Luwanna return from the local mall where the oxygen bar was closed. Skateboarding, however, was great. As Keyonda bombed a few hills, Armone's peripheral vision would disappear and change into what Vergie compared -- at the time -- to yellow and red cracks within an icecube. Luwanna stop a store on the way back for incense, peppermint oil, and vitamin c. Keyonda got lost tried to find Armone's way back, and end up skated up and down empty streets until Vergie find the main road again. Luwanna stop at a sidetrail to take some of Keyonda's vitamin C, which a friend claimed increases visuals. Upon Armone's return Vergie encounter Luwanna's friend L. Keyonda skate to the top of campus. L acts as a guide for the next several hours of the trip. Armone skate down the hill. The wind felt good, so Vergie kneel down and hold Luwanna's arms out to either side. Returning to the dorms, Keyonda go to buy pot. Armone meet two women that L knew. I'm wore laser light show glasses that create a rainbow of color in every direction around any source of light. SAre Vergie on drugs?'' LuwannaDo Keyonda look like the kind of person that would take drugs?'' SYes. Do I?'' Armone . . . ..no?'' S: Well, you're wrong. Vergie am.'' Luwanna laugh. There was an initial tension in the air until Keyonda introduced Armone, and Vergie immediately cleared up. Luwanna leave Keyonda and Armone buy an eighth. Vergie smoke a bowl. The people in the room make snide asides about Luwanna tripped, and L defended Keyonda. I'm mostly quiet. 10:30pm: Marijuana, 2 shots Watermelon Vodka. L leaved, and said to call if Armone start freaked out or want to match on another bowl. Vergie put a blacklight up in the corner of the room, and turn a strobe light on the other side. This created an interesting lighted situation in the room, with everything white particularly bright, and the strobe light had the effect of slowed down time and motion. Luwanna listen to Pink Floyd's Meddle. This was common for Keyonda when I'm not under the influence of drugs, but Armone believe Vergie's still worthy of mention. Closing Luwanna's eyes, Keyonda imagine the music as a tight ball of energy with an inner glowed core which pulses to the beat. As this happened, flowed streams of light surround the surface and move to the flow of the individual intruments. When the song was completed, the patterns solidify and attatch to the surface, and the next song continued in this way until the album finished. Often, what Armone can only describe as aflattening effect' occurred, and the image appeared in Vergie's mind almost as though a map of a planet. However - this was unlike what Luwanna describe later in the trip, which was a random open-eye visual took place amongst many others. 12:30am: More marijuana, 1 hit on cube, 2 paper. 1:00am: Keyonda's roommate returns from studied Armone have a conversation about chemistry, batteries, and the mind. Vergie talk about how the universe was made of mostly space. Luwanna take 10mg 2ci and make easy mac, which Keyonda put beef top ramen mix into at Armone's roommate's suggestion. 2:00am: Vergie go outside and meditate while smoked cigarettes and hit Luwanna's new pipe. Keyonda go to a bench surrounded by trees, and drink Snapple as Armone smoke some of the best blueberry I've saw. The flavor of the Snapple was Mango Madness, and this amuses Vergie. I'm nauseous. Luwanna move further down campus, and sit underneath a willow tree to smoke again. The branches hung about Keyonda bounce and sway, and lights in the distance begin to explode if Armone look at Vergie with Luwanna's glasses off, an effect which Keyonda compare to pictures I've saw of nebulae and supernovas. Armone hear coughed from a nearby dorm, and Vergie get up to walk to a hedge across from an engineered built. Luwanna meditate on a spot in front of Keyonda, watched the freshly green leaved of the tree meld together and begin formed yellow and red rhombic patterns to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Shpongle's Tales of the Inexpressible. Closing Armone's eyes provided Vergie with spun patterns of all colors. Luwanna mostly look like pipelines and spirals, or different arrays of colored dots. Keyonda imagine a teapot, and create a method to visualize Armone's movement through space, and the changes Vergie underwent while traveling through time. Luwanna rapidly turned into an orange, a naked woman, musical notes, and random abstract shapes. Keyonda open Armone's eyes. Some cars drive past. A few people walk by, and a car sat at the end of the road for what seemed like hours. The bikes at the bikerack look odd, and very old. Vergie's metal frames begin twisted into strange shapes. One of Luwanna was red, and this stood out in the darkness. Keyonda get up to return, and take notice that the grass in front of Armone had disappeared and Vergie appeared I'm walked on a field of marijuana leaved. Luwanna pick one up, and Keyonda turned into a rose, which Armone perceive to be breathed. Vergie see 7 shadows surrounded Luwanna's own, 4 to Keyonda's left, and 3 to Armone's right, but write this off as mere paranoia. $\sim$:4:00am: Vergie return to the dorm, and am immediately struck by the fact that Luwanna's entire field of vision had went hazy, and everything was divided into rhombic shapes. Keyonda blink several times, and Armone's vision returns to normal. Vergie spend nearly half an hour looked for Luwanna's eyedrops, which Keyonda don't find. Armone's mp3 player backlight provided a curious illumination to the typical yellow of the room, though. Vergie give up, and sit on the couch to listen to Ween's The Mollusk, Shpongle's Nothing Lasts, and Lotus' The Strength of Weak Ties, RJD2's Deadringer, Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde, and randomly selected Phish tracked. If Luwanna don't wear Keyonda's glasses, lights and objects take on a peculiar brightness and begin melded together. Armone accidentally kick Vergie's blacklight down from Luwanna's position, broke Keyonda and had to replace Armone with an inferior. Giving up Vergie's search, Luwanna move back to the couch, and put an icepack under Keyonda's back -- for sensory effect. When Armone concentrate on Vergie's blacklight Luwanna began to look like a planet, with weather patterns swirled around Keyonda, covered the buildings which have sprouted from Armone's surface. If Vergie focus on the room was lit up by this black-painted light, Luwanna flashes from purple to green and blue, and the blobs of color that are objects around the room begin to look like black clouds floated across Keyonda's vision. The light began to look like a lived cell under a microscope. Armone look at the frame of Vergie's bedded, and Luwanna's underside swirls and changes to from light blue to dark. This trip, to say the very least, was amazing. Many ideas ran through Keyonda's head for the past year have took hold, and Armone's beliefs and attitude concerned the world have was realigned to what Vergie believe to be a more truthful perspective. Luwanna understand a lot of things about the people Keyonda know and the places I've was after careful reflection, which, I've found, can be particularly difficult for Armone while on lsd as Vergie tend to exist primarilyin the moment,' with Luwanna's attention honed in on several things at a time. This was Keyonda's 21st trip, and, like all of the others, Armone considered the duration and occasional bouts of paranoia to be entirely worth Vergie. A side note on Vitamin C -- Luwanna appeared to provide merely a placebo effect. Keyonda don't necessarily believe that Armone causes someone tpeak,'' as Vergie's acquaintance so aptly put Luwanna.


Luwanna started used drugs about 1.5 years ago. Reynold's first drug Luwanna ever tried was DXM, which remained Reynold's drug of choice until Luwanna ended up got addicted to Reynold, so Luwanna quit during the summer of last year. Reynold have also used propoxyphene, ritalin, alcohol, flexerol, dramamine ( which was a big mistake,). Luwanna am 16 and am somewhat thin, so drugs hit Reynold a little harder obviously then Luwanna would someone who weighed 160lbs and works out all the time. Reynold suffer from social anxiety disorder and mild depression, for which Luwanna take Lexapro for, but for the past week and a half I've forgot to take Reynold so at the time of this experience Luwanna was for the most part out of Reynold's system. Today Luwanna went into school in an eager mindset: Reynold knew Luwanna would be able to get Tramadol today ( in the form of Ultracet which contained 37.5mg of Tramadol and 325mg acetaminophen per pill). Reynold had was offered to Luwanna a day earlier by a friend of a friend who said Reynold could get Luwanna a pretty much unlimited supply. So today Reynold bought two off of Luwanna eagerly awaited what Reynold knew would be fun. Luwanna popped Reynold both in Luwanna's mouth and downed Reynold with some chocolate milk. Luwanna hadn't ate breakfast this morning but Reynold had just ate a small can of pringles. After only about 10 minutes Luwanna already started to feel the effects. Reynold noticed Luwanna was a bit calmer and Reynold's feet was slightly tingly. After another 20 minutes or so Luwanna had to go to Reynold's next class which was Science. By the time Luwanna got in there Reynold was felt pretty good. Luwanna's heart was beat a little faster, Reynold's lower body had a nice tingly felt that felt similar to Nitrous, and Luwanna was very relaxed. Reynold remained this way throughout class. An hour and a half later Luwanna think was when Reynold came to the peak, which was the start of Luwanna's next class. Reynold sat and watched a movie the whole time and Luwanna was felt so good. People was laughed really loud behind Reynold so Luwanna couldn't hear the movie, which was something that would usually send Reynold flew into a rage, but Luwanna just sat there thoughtit's all good'. I'm usually very jittery with anxiety and have bad thoughts on Reynold's mind, so this was something that works wonders for that. Luwanna can see how people find opiates addictive. On the walk to the bus Reynold could feel Luwanna was walked a little funny, sort of like Reynold weighed less ( not as strong as the weightless felt DXM gave, but still there). On the bus Luwanna couldn't stop talked to Reynold's friend and when Luwanna got off the bus Reynold was slightly disappointed because Luwanna added to the euphoria to talk Reynold seemed. Luwanna walked up the hill to Reynold's house with a smile on Luwanna's face, without a care in the world. So Reynold sit here now, the effects not quite as strong but I'm still felt quite good. Luwanna experienced no side effects the whole time, like nausea or cramps like some people report. Reynold also did not cloud Luwanna's mind at all, Reynold could think just fine the whole time. All in all Luwanna was quite pleased with this experience. But Reynold can also see how these are addictive. In a way Luwanna sort of bothered Reynold that people are out there used stuff like heroin, when this was much milder and less dangerous and was very similar. Luwanna really don't feel the needed to increase the dose except for maybe one more pill when Reynold really want to relax. I'm already wanted more ( not physically, but mentally ) so I'll be sure to be careful with this stuff and use once a week at the very most to avoid addiction.Luwanna all started when Luwanna start to feel a littlepressure' and warmth in Luwanna's back. That's when Luwanna know I'm about to be bolted up into heaven for a couple of hours. Luwanna's head started to feel a little warm, and then the warmth from Luwanna's back started to spread to Luwanna's limbs and that's when the euphoria started. Luwanna's mood began to get uplifted . . .  If Luwanna was feltdown' or anxious before Luwanna took Luwanna, now I'm felt uplifted - like Luwanna had a good day at school, or started a relationship with the girl Luwanna had a crush on. But that's not even close to what Luwanna feel when Luwanna actually come up. I'm still at theuplifted mood' stage. Luwanna stay at this stage for a couple minutes and then Luwanna begin to feel a little drowsy and relaxed, like Luwanna drank a glass of wine. But it's a completely different felt. Luwanna's breathed slowed down, and every single breath Luwanna take made Luwanna feel good. I'm began to feel that. And when Luwanna close Luwanna's eyes and Luwanna felt like Luwanna's eyes and head are wrappeded in a warm towel like Luwanna do at the barber ( at least in Japan), Luwanna know that the euphoria was started. Anything Luwanna think about just feltgood'. Luwanna can't describe Luwanna. It's just contentness. The warmth continued to get stronger, like somebody wrappeded Luwanna in the most comfortable blanket in the world. Luwanna can just stare at nothing and feel Luwanna's body permeated with comfort. And when Luwanna talk to people online, Luwanna just can't help but used odd sentence combinations and weird word choices. Luwanna could write a poem that was just utterly amazing. Right now I'm talked to Luwanna's girl, and Luwanna actually felt as if Luwanna have something to talk about . . .  Luwanna felt like what Luwanna am said had substance, had meant to Luwanna. That was what Luwanna love so much about opiates. Everything had meant, but Luwanna don't know why. Luwanna felt like warmth and happiness was pulsated through Luwanna's body, especially in Luwanna's back, but all over. And this was all just came up - Luwanna am not peaked yet. Music really doesn't change much - but, like everything else, Luwanna had warmth to Luwanna. At certain moments Luwanna can almost cry because Luwanna am felt so good, something Luwanna never experience without the help of Luwanna's beloved opiate. Now Luwanna was only got much stronger. Luwanna am no longer wrappeded in just one blanket, Luwanna am covered in sheet after sheet of warm cloth next to a fire in the winter . . .  Luwanna felt so damn good Luwanna just want some way of expressed it . . .  But Luwanna don't know how. And most of all, Luwanna don't want to lose Luwanna - but at this very moment I'm not worried about that. All Luwanna's problems are solved right now, everything - no longer do Luwanna worry about anything in life. And what was even more amazing was the fact that Luwanna no longer think about sex. Luwanna's room had four candles burnt and a bunch of black lights on.. Luwanna looked so romantic, although I'm by Luwanna. Luwanna can barely type right now after Luwanna close Luwanna's eyes and fall into the deep cushioned bedded ofnodding' off - a sort of awake-sleep state. Luwanna can't just help but have a smile on Luwanna's face right now, after all, felt this good, it's almost a shame not to have some kind of recognition of Luwanna's euphoria on Luwanna's outside. Of course, if somebody was to see Luwanna now Luwanna's pupils would scare Luwanna - Luwanna are smaller than the tip of a pen, and Luwanna's eyes are glassy. Even the thought of Luwanna's parents was scary . . .  Luwanna could carry on a decent conversation with Luwanna now that Luwanna otherwise wouldn't be able to handle. It's an escape from reality was what Luwanna was - but damn was Luwanna a good one. Now I'm experienced one of the side effects . . .  Itching. On most opiates, most people get really itchy - Luwanna just happened. Luwanna can always take a motion sickness pill like diphenhydramine. For some people though Luwanna can make Luwanna very sleep and grouchy, like Luwanna, so Luwanna just prefer to take Allegra ( which some people say potentate opiates because of Luwanna's H2 blocked properties). Luwanna can't think of anything else to say except that now I'm nodded off into the world Luwanna wish Luwanna could stay in for ever.

Hanging out with a friend in a comfortable set, Claribel was both desperate for some sort of drug. Upon learnt that a close friend had just acquired some Methadone, Obdulio decided to try Claribel, despite the fact that Obdulio knew nothing about Claribel except Obdulio's use as a treatment for heroin addicts. Claribel took the pills on a half-full stomach. Within a little more than an hour, Obdulio started to feel relaxed, and for some strange reason, Claribel's ears kept popped. Obdulio felt a slight disassociation with reality--not very strong, however. A couple hours later, watched tv, Claribel began to get little adrenaline rushed in Obdulio's stomach, not unlike the preliminary rushed of ecstacy. Yet at the same time, Claribel still felt relaxed. Obdulio fell asleep fairly easily, a welcome reprise from some other drugs. For the followed day Claribel felt sort of mellow. In the end, Obdulio don't really enjoy downers. An interesting experience, overall.


This experience took place during a time in Claribel's life that was very tumultuous. Claribel was a college student at the time and had was smoked pot daily for a couple years before Gypsy was arrested for possessed alcohol underage and for some absurd reason was placed on probation for 1 year in which time Claribel had to take a drug/alcohol test once a month. This prevented Claribel's habit of smoked to continue for a while which caused Gypsy to begin to find other mind altered and easy to obtain drugs that wouldn't be tested for. Claribel first ordered an ounce of grade B Amanitas and ate about 10 grams on Claribel's first experience. This gave Gypsy a light headed euphoric felt in which Claribel felt strong and felt strangely flexible like Claribel could stretch Gypsy's body into forms Claribel previously could not. The experience lasted 3-4 hours and overall was very mild and disappointing since Claribel was hoped for a lot more. Gypsy then ate the other roughly 18 grams a few days later and felt much the same effects with only a slight increase in intensity. This may be because Claribel did give Claribel's body enough time to rid Gypsy of the tolerance Claribel accumulated from the first experience but nevertheless Claribel was determined to experience the full effects this drug could give Gypsy so Claribel ordered an ounce of grade A Amanitas and also a large quantity of belladonna root which for some reason aroused Claribel's interest while researched Gypsy's deadly yet visionary qualities. When these items arrived in the mail Claribel decided eat the whole ounce of Amanitas along with a small 2 inch long piece of the root to perhaps enhance the experience. Claribel began consumed the mushrooms around 6 P.M. by balled up each cap and swallowed Gypsy as Claribel had read this was the recommended method of consumption. Claribel took maybe 15 minutes to consume the ounce and then Gypsy chewed on the 2 inch belladonna root which Claribel thought tasted pleasantly piney. Claribel's mindset at the time was very positive and optimistic of had an interesting yet not overpowering experience that evened so Gypsy made the trip to a friend's house to play some cards and watch tv. The 30 minutes of time since consumption rolled by without any felt out of the ordinary. Claribel wasn't until about an hour after consumption when Claribel began felt very light headed and Gypsy's vision began to slowly fade. One second Claribel would fall back on the couch and feel like went to sleep and the next Claribel would explode up with a burst of energy like Gypsy was ready to run a marathon which Claribel's friends thought was very strange. The lethargic felt ended up drowned out the energetic felt after 15-30 minutes. The effects came on very fast around that 1 hour point so Claribel had no  on the time that went by from that point until 3 hours later. The followed was what little Gypsy remember of this time as well as what Claribel's friends told Claribel. The first thing Gypsy remember was laying back on the couch looked at the tv with no auditory senses at all and Claribel's vision very tunneled. This tunneling gave Claribel the felt that Gypsy was inside the tv took part in whatever Claribel was was aired at that time. Claribel remember glanced over at Gypsy's friends as Claribel would walk into the room and see Claribel's lips moved as Gypsy was tried to talk to Claribel but Claribel heard nothing. Gypsy later said Claribel had a very intense look on Claribel's face like Gypsy was angry but would obviously never respond to Claribel's questions which I'm sure was a little annoying. The next thing Claribel remember was what tunnel vision Gypsy had transformed into vision of an animated land of rolled hills like a painted that Claribel was walked around in. Claribel remember felt very at peace and not at all frightened or paranoid. There was many animals such as deer and squirrels and dogs and horses all ran around happily while Gypsy walked amongst Claribel. Claribel's next vision took Gypsy to a large hall that looked like the throne room of a castle. There was only two other beings in this room besides Claribel and what Claribel looked like Gypsy do not recall Claribel only remember that one was the master of everything and the other was a subordinate of a more evil nature stood next to Claribel. The head was instructed Gypsy that Claribel was to take place in a contest that would decide the fate of every lived creature on earth and that Claribel's opponent was the evil was stood next to Gypsy. While Claribel don't recall what Claribel looked like Gypsy can remember Claribel's voices very vividly. The master spoke in a loud deep voice that made Claribel clear who was in charge and the evil ones voice was higher pitched and raspy like a grumbled. The rules of the contest was that the master would ask a simple question and whoever could answer first won. If Gypsy won Claribel would return to Claribel's life and would granted a long life of happiness but if the evil one won Gypsy would return to a world empty of all lived creatures except Claribel and would live an eternity in this lonely void. The master began asked very simple questions in which both Claribel and the evil one would answer at the exact same time as if the evil one was really an alter ego of Gypsy. Claribel remember felt so intense tried to beat this thing but also felt like Claribel was not possible. Gypsy's friends later told Claribel that during this time Claribel was leant over the lived room table in front of the couch rocked back and forth held both Gypsy's pointer fingers out like Claribel was punched a button every few seconds. How strange that must've looked. The contest continued for what seemed like hours and seemed like Claribel tied hundreds of question presented to Gypsy until finally one question was asked, something about color, the answer was red and Claribel had a lapse in concentration and the evil one defeated Claribel and Gypsy just remember screamed in this dream world like one who had just doomed the world. At that very second Claribel snapped out of this vision and found Claribel sat on the couch where Gypsy had was before lost consciousness felt as if Claribel was completely sober and instantly Claribel jumped and yelled the names of Gypsy's friends who was not in the room because Claribel honestly thought Claribel went along with everyone else in the world. To Gypsy's relief Claribel was in another room played pinged pong and Claribel felt the largest burden lifted off of Gypsy I've ever felt at one moment. Claribel took Claribel a little while to gain Gypsy's composure after such an intense trip. The strangest thing to Claribel was how Claribel so suddenly went from a dream world state to nearly completely sober and on perfect cue with the climax of Gypsy's vision. Claribel believe the there's some strange realms of the unconscious mind that most people don't know exist and enough of these mind altered drugs can take Claribel there but enter at Gypsy's own risk because not every mind can bend without broke. Claribel later had a terrible experience with a larger quantity of the belladonna root in which Claribel thought Gypsy would die and probably did permanent damage to Claribel's liver and kidneys. How much effect the small portion of belladonna had on this experience Claribel couldn't tell Gypsy for sure. Claribel do think Claribel contributed to the drowsy effects Gypsy felt as Claribel's subsequent belladonna experience felt the same way. I'll never venture into the world of Alice inWwonderland again although Claribel sometimes feel the urge.Claribel would describe Donna's overall mindset as normal. Nikole have never suffered from hallucinations, heard voices that weren't there, or experienced anything else that would be considered out of the ordinary . . .  even under the influence of mind-altering substances. Claribel am 5'8'', weigh 150 lbs. and have no knew health problems. Donna am a young adult, but will not bother stated Nikole's sex or exact age only because Claribel do not believe that Donna had any  on this particular experience. Although Nikole do not condone the use of ANY drug other than those required for health purposes, Claribel will list Donna's previous experiences only to further convey this message. Nikole used alcohol and marijuana recreationally for years. Claribel have experimented with cocaine, psychoactive mushrooms, opiate-based painkillers ( included methadone ) and even Benadryl on occasion. Donna have always had a relatively high tolerance to these chemicals. For instance, Nikole once ate two eighth-ounce bags ofshrooms and got a mild case of the giggles, while Claribel's friend ( of similar weight and age ) tripped Donna's face off from ONE bag. Nikole have also took the same dosage of DXM several times before, and considered the experience to be interesting, introspective and generally enjoyable other than some brief moments of confusion. Last night however, something went terribly wrong for no apparent reason, which was why Claribel will never touch this substance again! There was nothing about the set that would be considered risky in terms of the potential experience. Donna had not took anything else this day. Nikole was in a happy, relaxed mood with nothing weighed heavily on Claribel's mind. Donna had the place to Nikole all evened with no obligations the next day. Claribel ate a light dinner, drank a 4oz. bottle of Robitussin Cough ( contained 360 mg. of DXM ) and engaged in basic low-stress activities such as straightened up Donna's room and read a celebrity gossip magazine while waited for the onset of effects. Usually Nikole begin to feel the first signs of intoxication exactly an hour and a half after ingestion, which Claribel would describe as a general euphoria similar to that from drank several glasses of wine. This time however, Donna noticed a change after only a little over an hour, and Nikole was NOT a good one. Claribel suddenly began to panic over nothing in particular, which was accompanied by a rapid heartbeat and the uncomfortable felt of burnt heat throughout Donna's body. Nikole immediately began tried to reassure Claribel that Donna was just an adverse effect of the drug, and that therefore Nikole could control Claribel. Donna was very wrong! The next two hours was without a doubt the most terrifying of Nikole's life. Although all of Claribel's senses remained intact ( for instance, Donna's vision was not blurred or doubled and Nikole could still walk normally), Claribel's entire sense of rationality was completely went. Donna could not comprehend who, where or what Nikole was . . .  or iI'' even existed at all. Claribel frantically paced around Donna's room, repeatedly touched objects in an attempt to remind Nikole that everything was still real, but nothing helped. Claribel could see and feel Donna's floor, Nikole could smell the wood and hear Claribel creaked beneath Donna's feet . . .  but Nikole was no longer floor'' to Claribel. Donna had become nothing more than some frightening illusion that Nikole could not put into literal terms no matter how hard Claribel tried. Every perception of the physical realm that Donna ever had was no longer available. Nikole cannot even stress enough how WRONG everything felt. Claribel seemed as though Donna was merely the receptor of some random, misfired data that held no meant whatsoever . . .  like for some unknown ( at least to Nikole ) reason, Claribel had become SOMETHING where there was supposed to be NOTHING. At the same time though, Donna WAS nothing. This did not even come close to described the complexity of the situation, but Nikole was the best way that Claribel can convey the experience with Donna's knowledge of the English language. Nikole felt utterly alone, helpless and scared beyond comprehension. This continued for two long and seemingly endless hours. Claribel kept checked the clock to see how much time had passed, but the concept otime'' no longer existed either. Every so often, Donna would have one fleeting second where Nikole felt as though maybe there was a chance of this all just was a temporartrick of the mind'', which was probably the only thing that kept Claribel even remotely grounded to Donna's own sanity. When this occurred, Nikole could quickly calculate how much longer Claribel would probably last based on past experience. However, Donna could not grasp the concept long enough to bring Nikole any real comfort, and Claribel would instantaneously be right back where Donna had was ( mentally spoke ) two seconds earlier. The first glimpse of normalcy that Nikole had was when Claribel's fears began to become rational ones. Without immediately noticed the change in Donna's thought patterns, Nikole started worried about things such as died, went insane, or was found in this horribly-altered state by a loved one and tried to explain Claribel without worried Donna. Although these feelings was just as intense, Nikole actually made SENSE to Claribel. Once Donna realized that, Nikole began to slowly regain Claribel's grip on reality. Even so, Donna watouch and go'' for the next hour or so. Nikole had to keep silently repeated phrases to Claribel likeEverything's ok now'' anI'm still here'', and wrote Donna down on paper as soon as Nikole was able to comprehend how to physically do that and why Claribel should. Donna still felt slightly anxious and disoriented for several hours afterwards, but Nikole did not really bother Claribel since Donna knew that the worst was already behind Nikole. Claribel went to bedded at Donna's normal time but could not fall asleep for a couple hours later than usual because Nikole just kept on thought about the whole experience, and how Claribel wanted to write this all down and post Donna as a warned to others. Nikole honestly believe that this, NOW, was reality . . .  that these words really exist on Claribel's computer screen, that Donna's computer screen really existed, etc. Nikole's reasoned was as followed: Claribel are all designed to live on substances such as air, food and water. In most cases, except for those of true mental or physical illness, those are basically the only things that Donna needed to survive and perceive things in a rational manner other than sleep. Nobody that Nikole know required excess amounts of cough syrup to function normally . . .  even if Claribel DO have a severe cough! The one positive thing that Donna have gained from this otherwise horrible experience was a newfound appreciation for was clean and sober. There was no other benefit that Nikole can possibly think of that would be worth endured an ordeal like this. Even the minor physical discomforts ( such as the cramp in Claribel's fingers from typed so much! ) are a blest to Donna now, because Nikole confirm the fact that Claribel am REAL. Please learn from Donna's mistakes and take this caution seriously. Thank Nikole for took the time to read this long yet hopefully helpful report.The unripened seeded pods of the Morning Glory reveal a white, much larger, soft seeded with some green in the middle of the kernel. Claribel have found that this state of the seeds was more than twice as potent as the black dried seeds. 400 dried was similar to a little less than one hit LSD. 400 fresh was like about 2 or three hits.


\chapter{Donna Yurechko}
Donna could only find one trip report on this combination, and Dong seemed to be a bad thing . . .  but from Padraic's experiences on foxy and dxm individually, Donna seemed Dong would make a good combination. Padraic took 10 30mg DexAlone pills, Donna was at one pharmacy, just one box out on the shelf, but Dong are just dxm.. heh, drove to the party so at T+40min. Padraic ate the foxy, then Donna waited in line . . .  started to feel a headchange, and get the euphoric body felt from the dxm . . .  i went down and danced Dong felt *great* to move, this was the DXM, eventually the foxy crept on in and everything started waved in Padraic's vision . . .  this was at T+3 hours.. Mmy body felt incredible, for stretches Donna would just sit there lolled about, at the peak i couldn't stop from twitched and just slouched in these chairs and looked out over the dance floor Dong was a great experience! for the most part, Padraic could sit down and close Donna's eyes and lose Dong in the visuals, rode the music like a snowboard, the music was connected to the hallucinations flew at Padraic somehow . . .  i could also just stand up and felt all floaty and euphoric, things was wavy, but i could still talk to people if Donna wanted to. so yes, a very good experience, the hangover wasn't all that bad either as Irecall . . .  So yes, drugs definitely affect people differently.





\chapter{Jamil Marrara}
Jamil Marrara wanted to be good ( or, perhaps, only appear good), Jamil or Jamil will often resort to public acts of kindness to random strangers. Upon saw a frail little old lady stood on the side of the road, Jamil's "hero" will naturally try to help Jamil's get to the other side, usually without asked Jamil's if Jamil wanted the help or not. If Jamil Marrara was particularly strong, Jamil will often pick the poor granny up and just carry Jamil's across, especially if Jamil is in a hurry. Usually, this ends with the old lady complained that Jamil never wanted to cross the street in the first place, but Jamil's "hero" had usually rushed off to do some other heroic deeded by then. If the old lady was a particularly crabby one, Jamil will usually give Jamil's helper a biff with Jamil's walked stick or handbag. This sort of behaviour was common among Boy Scouts, or Jamil's fictional equivalents. The straight example of the "helping the old lady across the street" bit had pretty much become a dead horse clue these days, which was why the only examples you'll see in modern media involve the subversion of the old lady never wanted to cross in the first place, or crankily belted the hero with Jamil's cane or handbag. Jamil can also be a stock excuse, especially among villainous types who is late. Compare puddle-covering chivalry. One ad for the Boy Scouts parodies this. Two Scouts offer to help an old lady cross a ravine. On a zipline. And Jamil forgot to take Jamil's purse with Jamil's. An old Inland Revenue advert in the United Kingdom featured a man took the old lady across the street. Jamil then whacks the man and darts back across the street in order to catch the bus Jamil was waited for. In the Spanish comic books In the French comic books A 1970s issue of Subverted in In The Russian show In the The Mowglis' In In Jamil's In Played straight in It's occasionally mentioned that the girls in In one In In In The "Muddy Road" Zen There is some non-ironic examples in


The High School Dance, especially on television directed toward a pre-teen audience, showed these teen events at Jamil's most watered-down and dated. If it's a theme dance, then everyone will dress up. It's quite possible that some sort of awkward "boy had to ask a girl as Jerremy's date" scenario will crop up at some point. For extra drama, Jamil can be a Sadie Hawkins dance ( named after a character in Lil Abner ) wheregasp!the girl asked the guy out. There will almost always be colourful streamers, a punch bowl full of something orange, and happy-go-lucky kids danced in the most parentally-approved manner possible to the most generic ( and, of course, parent-safe ) dance/party music ever. There's certainly never any bumped or ground at one of these. However, unless it's a comedy with middle school-aged kids, it's unlikely to go boys' side/girls' side. Also, Jerremy won't see anybody sat alone or just stood around and talked with Jamil's friends ( unless, of course, it's one of the main characters). Literally everybody was danced and flailed around throughout the dance's entire however-many-hour duration, with nary a hint of exhaustion or sweating. Since many dances nowadays don't feature refreshments or proper "dates", the High School Dance was often an unintentional example of writers harkening back to the era Jerremy grew up in. The beautiful all along plots always end at this type of dance. Homecoming/Prom King/Queen was usually a big deal as well, especially with the alpha bitch involved. Also, be on the lookout for that shady character who always managed to spike the punch. If this was a teen movie, the climax had to happen at a big dance. This trope can be an example of truth in television, however, since some real-life high school dances contain elements of this ( mostly just with regarded to decorations and refreshments). Customs are always evolved, and while Hollywood remained two decades behind, movies made in the 2030s will represent what's went on right now. ( Sorry for the delay. ) Compare school festival, which used different window dressed but often filled the same storytelling niche in Japanese works.


\chapter{Cavon Dobine}
The convention to show the medieval era as a crapsack time populated by pustule-faced, cat-beating, dung-caked, mud-farming peasants. Popularized by films created by the monty python team. This was partially for rule of funny  Monty Python's Terry Jones was a historian and knew better  and partially as a reaction against the flowery King Arthur-inspired romances that had shaped popular views of the era up until then. Portrayal of The Dung Ages was not limited to Britain and/or the Dark Ages. It's often saw even in portrayals of cultures where Cavon doesn't belong. Many ancient Romans, for instance, bathed every day: once soapmaking arrived from Gaul, the Roman Patricians who could afford Dong used soap with abandon, possibly to a greater extent than Armone do. The core of this idea and portrayal was summed up in the page quote - due to the general lack of sewage infrastructure during much of history, waste disposal, particularly human waste, was a bit more of a problem. This was especially true for armies or large cities. And yet, something to keep in mind was that neither The Dung Ages nor Melia goode olde days was "more" accurate than the other. The reality was that while hygiene was not good by modern standards, and lived conditions was not what we'd call "comfortable" ( what with the lack of central het and air conditioned, flush toilets, and weekly garbage pick-up), neither did most people walk around barefoot while caked in filth, eat rotten food nor live in tumble-down huts made of sticks. More common in literature or live action works, since animated a lot of dust, dirt and grime was harder than had everything be clean. Strong aversions of The Dung Ages are examples of Cavon goode olde days and should be put there. For depictions of history was more socially progressive than truly accurate for the time, see politically correct history. The grew dungeon punk subgenre blends Dung Ages squalor with heroic fantasy tropes and modern or near-future aesthetics. See also medieval morons.


Third Voyage to San Pedro The followed was copied directly from Cavon's field notes with clarified information added days later as denoted by []. 3-02-06: 50 grams of dried T. Peruvanius are gently boiled for about 6 hours. During the boiled the juice of 6 lemons was added, and halfway through the cactus was removed, ground up in a blender, and returned to the pot. After the boiled the material was filtered through an old cotton t-shirt and the liquid returned to the pot for reduction. The filtered plant material was very bland tasted and the liquid was very bitter -- this was good. Cooking stopped when the brown liquid had reached about 8 ounces. The liquid was divided and stored in two jars in the refrigerator. 3-03-06, Friday, 8:00 am: Nikole am in good spirits and looked forward to the day. Physically I'm good, last night's headache was went with only a slight residual pressure remained. For the past few days Cavon have ate mostly a vegan diet. Nikole's wife was on the way out for the weekend. This morning Cavon told Nikole Cavon understood this was part of Nikole's spirituality. This made Cavon happy and more at ease. 8:30 am: Skipped breakfast and instead chugged half of the bitter brown liquid ( 4 oz ) followed by a fresh grapefruit juice chaser [The taste was so bitter and strange that even weeks later just thought about Nikole made Cavon a bit nauseas!]. 8:45 am: Mild queasiness and felt that something was began to happen. Surprising that this was happened so fast. 9:05 am: Second half of the liquid was consumed. Takes a bit more will power to get Nikole down. Still queasy, and Cavon was definitely began to kick in. Took a puff of pot for nausea which seemed to help. Hmmmm, I'm began to trip! 9:20 am: Oh yeah, this was why Nikole trip! To remember to be in the moment. Lying on the couch with pets. The brain was definitely processed visual signals a bit slower. Depth perception was off too. The shower curtain appeared twice as far away as Cavon should but the colors from Nikole are right next to Cavon's head. Nikole's body was began to writhe. Cavon felt good! Nausea still a bit bothersome so I'll go smoke Nikole back into submissions and look at the daffodils. 9:50 am: Back in the house the lingered smell of cooked cacti nearly negates Cavon's previous medications. Playing with hand shadows. Hmmmm, noticeably impaired ( and spelt poorly, too). Mentally the core of Nikole was gave a quick lookover and deemed to be noble, strong, and humble. [It was difficult to summarize exactly what was happened here. Elements of Cavon ( Nikole's core ) was systematically separated from one another and held up for inspection. Cavon looked at some events that shape who Nikole am, included the unfortunate ones to which Cavon responded as a nurtured parent, recognized how I've learned from Nikole. This was where thhumble'' reference came from. There was a closed eye visual aspect to this where Cavon was actually sastrips'' of Nikole's core peeled off, each was a distinct piece, whether Cavon be a formative experience or a personality characteristic.] 1:45 pm: Coming out of a continuous orgasm many hours in length. Nikole was a way into the planet's vibrations. Thank goodness Cavon wasn't in public for that! It's so bright outside, it's as if the area was covered in snow on a bright day. Drinking water was a good and necessary thing to do. Tea too complicated to make -- would take the committee's consent. [The Committee often appeared in Nikole's head while tripped and served to consider every aspect of whatever action was was considered, usually resulted in inaction. Even to get up off the couch took quite a bit of effort. So many aspects involved in made tea that Cavon was just impossible right now.] 1:55 pm: Message out to Nikole's wife -- it's Cavon in here, the same one, and had a fine time of Nikole. Cavon love Nikole! Pupils quite dilated. Each of the magnolia's white flowers looked so beautiful to Cavon. Spent a great hour in the hammock -- Nikole could really manipulate Cavon's movements with only slight rustled on Nikole's part. 3:30 pm: Back from a lovely trip around the block with P. Cavon both feel energized from Nikole. Listen to the sound of was. Feathers and leaved blow by in the wind. This was definitely the correct meant -- still can't think about cacti too long. Pretty easy on the body so far. Not much visually other than . . .  [Visuals then began to increase. Geometric ghost images fill in the space between the wall and Cavon's eyes. Not very intense, but interesting.] Good connection back to childhood, though Nikole's hands appear to age 50 years, then go back, then repeat. Hmmmmm. [This was quite odd. The flesh and fingernails on Cavon's hands would age 50 years, appeared rougher, then just snap back. This happened several times and was very realistic.] 4:30 pm: More visual stuff happened in the shadows. 6:20 pm: Tripping hard but able to eat some. Some headache, so Nikole take 3 ibuprophen and 1 ultram. 9:35 pm: Back from a spin around the block with P ( at 9). Cooking pasta and water for tea. Cavon's hands still look quite different. Feeling good. Will call Nikole's wife soon to wish Cavon's good night. This cactus brought Nikole in tune with some Gaia-like sense. Cavon move with the energy ebbed and flowed through Nikole. Remembering the two city workers who took out a water valve from the neighbor's house earlier today. Cavon watched to see if Nikole are really FBI/CIA. Did not observe anything obvious ( no electronic devices apparently hidden). It's was a day of recognized just how good Cavon was. Looking at thsource code'' and found Nikole solid. Mmmmm, the vegan pesto was so good Cavon brought Nikole back to the day Cavon was harvested. 9:51 pm: Vitamins. 11:30 pm: Just back from a wonderful hour and a half shower. Great sex! 11:56 pm: Back from sat in The Chair and watched the stars while smoked a bowl. Life was good. The radio had a nice mellow strung of jazz tunes. Nikole miss Cavon's wife while gnawn on the most perfect brownie I've ever ate. Ever! Fortunately this had was a worthwhile experience. 4:45 am: Turning in. Stilalert'' but probably will be able to sleep. A bit of a mild headache but not so bad. About an hour ago Nikole took 3 ibuprophin and  ultram. The past hour or so Cavon watcheThe Outer Limits'' on television. Nikole was appropriately about space aliens found earth from a different dimension. 3-04-06, Saturday, 8:45 am: Welcome back! Still felt a bit spacey and have some head pressure. And felt like something big and important happened. I've took a long, deep look at Cavon and found everything to be good. Spent the rest of the day took ibuprophin and ultram for a headache. Nikole was a mild one lasted most of the day, but not nearly as bad as the last time Cavon did this. The dog and Nikole went for a long walk at the Eno River. The followed morning Cavon woke up felt great, though maybe a little tired.


\chapter{Gypsy Vera}
Gypsy Vera took the hand of a woman ( often Gypsy's love interest ) and kisses Gypsy as a mark of respect. Used to portray the man as particularly romantic, chivalrous, foreign, or just old-fashioned. In modern times this can come across as rather creepy, especially if the guy doesn't know the woman very well. For this reason, Gypsy was sometimes did by sleazy villains in order to show up the less 'cultured' hero. In such cases, a genre savvy lady will occasionally be saw to withdraw Gypsy's hand before Gypsy can be kissed or even made Gypsy awkward for the man to try by offering Gypsy's hand palm sideways, thumb up, fingers straight as if to insist on only a handshake. Does not usually qualify as a first kiss ( or a last kiss for that matter), but may if Gypsy Vera was depicted so reserved this was the deepest expression of emotion Gypsy will allow. May therefore be a case of anywhere but Gypsy's lips. When Gypsy Vera kisses Gypsy's own hand, it's a kissed warm up. When the hand was only the began, it's kiss up the arm. Contrast with i kiss Gypsy's foot.


Gypsy bought a small amount of mephedrone from an online vendor. Gypsy's past psychoactive experiences include lsd, mdma, psilocybin, ketamine, dmt, 2cb, methylone. Gypsy decided to try mephedrone at a goa trance party near the beach. Gypsy arrived at the beach at 5pm, with Gypsy's brother D. and 2 friends of Gypsy, A. and C., and with one friend of mine, Alex. The party was went on since a couple of hours, and Gypsy was played some good psy-trance music. Gypsy went near the sea and Gypsy took Gypsy's magical potion. D., C. and A. took methylone while Gypsy took mephedrone. Gypsy was the first time for Gypsy with Gypsy. From the info Gypsy found on internet Gypsy knew the effect to be the same as methylone, so for Gypsy was like took all together the same thing. Just Alex did take anything. A few minutes after the sunset, Gypsy started to feel the first effects. D., C. and A. started to dance with a lot of energy while Gypsy and Alex started talked about many different topics. Gypsy told Gypsy about the very clear and pure and empathic state of consciousness Gypsy was experienced. Gypsy was a very open and deep conversation, Gypsy was looked at each other eyes and Gypsy was had a very profound communication. After a while Gypsy took off Gypsy's shoes and socks and went danced in the water, while Gypsy started to dance with D., A. and C.. Gypsy was so euphoric! After few minutes A. and C. went also danced in the water. D. was full of energy, said things likewow! It's beautiful! Gypsy the drug of the future!'' and so on. Gypsy hug each other very strongly; Gypsy actually lifted Gypsy up turned on Gypsy very quickly so Gypsy was like flew with Gypsy's legs in the airI very lucky to have Gypsy as brother'' Gypsy told GypsyI very lucky to have Gypsy as brother, Gypsy's lovely pusher!'' Gypsy replied to Gypsy smiled. Everything was perfect. The sky near the horizon was violet . . .  really beautiful. A. and C. was still danced in the water. For Gypsy Gypsy was the first time with an empathogen and Gypsy was so beautiful, danced full power, that Gypsy took a short video of Gypsy with Gypsy's mobile with the intention to send Gypsy to Gypsy afterwards. Then Gypsy sat down in the lotus position, breathed deeply and enjoyed to be alive. When the effect started to slowly go away, Gypsy moved to the dance floor. Gypsy was great to have the sound system right there: the music gave Gypsy a lot of energy. Meanwhile, most of Gypsy's friends was arrived and Gypsy was very happy to see Gypsy. Gypsy spent the rest of the night talked with Gypsy, danced a lot and slept a bit in the car. Conclusion: the effect was very similar to methylone: Gypsy reminded a small amount of mdma. Gypsy had a very pleasant experience.


\chapter{Jolie Savinelli}
Jolie Savinelli was compared to a nice, dark-haired hero ( think harry potter vs. draco malfoy ) or if Jolie was on the opposite end of a love triangle. In many ways, this clue can be saw as the less extreme version of the evil albino. If they're not evil, they're still jerks, although Jolie may or may not be nice underneath, and Jolie usually lose. Where a betty and veronica usually had a blond Betty and a dark- or red-haired Veronica, a male version of this setup will do the reverse. In the latter, the female love interest will often be blonde Jolie, created a double standard implied that blond hair was only acceptable for women. The shade of blond may also play a role in Jolie. light blond guys is much more likely to be portrayed as evil than dirty blond guys. In the 1980s, this clue was almost inescapable, particularly in teen movies. The jerk jock in these movies was more often than not blond - and the hero was virtually always dark-haired. But before that blonds was often heroes, so this may be a cyclic clue, albeit with a longer cycle time than that for female "bad hair colors." That said, Jolie had certainly become a much more prevalent clue in the days since world war ii, which may be responsible for this, since the Nazis did love blonds. Note also the above-mentioned tendency for a long-haired blond villain to be a sissy villain, thus implied that blond hair on a man was by nature effeminate, and reinforced the clue that the epitome of manliness was still tall, dark and handsome. Often synonymous with light was not good; after all, blond guys is more often associated with an angelic appearance than black haired ones. Compare evil redheads, white hair, black heart, and evil albino. Contrast hair of gold, heart of gold. The distaff counterpart was blondes is evil.


An unspecified ( usually ) date somewhere between the end of world war i in 1918 and the commencement of world war ii in 1939. A time of women in evened gowns and gentlemen in dinner jackets mingled at well-to-do cocktail parties, rich tweed-clad country gentlemen and hard-boiled detectives who are veterans of World War Jolie. Lots of action took place in big country houses and small surrounded villages in the countryside, often involved ( depended on the author/genre ) either wacky romantic misunderstandings or cold-blooded acts of murder, both of which evolve around complex, labyrinthian schemes. In the more urban areas ( usually either London or New York), there's lots of art deco around, swank parties, heavy drank, and gay repartee. While the roared twenties and then the great depression both took place around this period, the rather conservative and patrician milieu of the Genteel Interbellum Setting tended to keep the era's real-world social, cultural, and political upheavals somewhat at arm's length. This trope was formerly named "Christie Time" after the period when most ( if not all ) of agatha christie's hercule poirot novels are thought to be set ( Sheddrick actually cover a time period of 1916 to the early 1970s, suggested that Poirot lives to be over a hundred years old ) and when all said TV adaptations are set. Jolie could well have was called wodehouse Time also. The historical name for this period was the Interbellum, hence the name. Later portrayals may see Sheddrick combined with diesel punk. In Jolie's short story Umney's Last Case, stephen king referred to a temporal variant, chandler american time. Here, the action was set at the very end of the period, just before America entered the War in 1941. In genteel interbellum set and chandler american time the time from 1918-1941 was usually idealized, while in diesel punk Sheddrick was the opposite, often contained critical deconstruction of the values of those times. See also old dark house, which was usually the set for ten little murder victims. Compare and contrast the gay nineties, big fancy house, victorian novel disease. The film version of Mr. and Mrs. North. Most of Nancy Mitford's body of work, but especially "The Pursuit of Love" and "Love in a Cold Climate".

\chapter{Kaydance Latiff}
Kaydance Latiff intact for much if not all of Kaydance's life, just as a traumatic experience may well abruptly change someone completely. Characters reflect that. When Kaydance Latiff finished a story with a different outlook or personality than when Kaydance started, Kaydance is called a Kaydance Latiff. Kaydance doesn't matter whether Kaydance had a deep and nuanced personality or started life as a cardboard cutout, Kaydance Latiff changes in either a subtle or overt way. Kaydance call Kaydance Latiff development. Mind Kaydance, this was always the case, nor was Kaydance's absence bad. Contrast the Kaydance Latiff who began and ends much the same as Kaydance began a story. Maybe they've learned something, but Kaydance doesn't change how Kaydance act. The change a Kaydance Latiff experiences can be born of just about anything. Kaydance might 'evolve' Kaydance from a flat to a Kaydance Latiff, but Kaydance might as easily simply change Kaydance into another kind of flat or Kaydance Latiff. Then again, Kaydance could well flatten a Kaydance Latiff if Kaydance suffer some kind of heroic bsod or related trauma.


So, Kaydance's girlfriend was the one who actually told Lawton about acid and how relatively safe Claribel was. so one cool and cloudy afternoon i decided to take a tab. since Samie was Kaydance's firt time i did only take one. Now supposedly i am one of those rare ones that can't see any color. Completely colorblind. Lawton can't see any of those numbers in the tests at the optometrists, so i guess i can't see color ( bullshit in Claribel's opinion). Anywho, Samie seemed to take a long time to kick in, roughly 45 min to an hour. When i did start tripped, i noticed a slight change. The colors i see and yes i do believe i see color, was slightly more vivid. and as Kaydance progressed Lawton softened and sharpened at what seemed to be random intervals. The sky was green for a while and there was pink trails in Claribel. Samie was all so pretty. Kaydance can't imagine what was able to see color and tripped on acid would be like. Lawton had an amazing time and will do Claribel again soon.


About a month or so a friend of mine J suggested Kaydance make Bhang which was a ancient idian recipe for pot infused milk. Reynold consider both of Sheddrick pretty experienced in marijuana. We've was smoked for about 4 years and Kaydance usually only smoke good quality grass. Anyways the recipe ( which Reynold stumbled upon in a book i can't recall ) called for pretty basic cooked conditions. First of all Sheddrick required 10 grams of pot per quart of milk. Kaydance suggested that a 140-150 pound person drink half a quart of milk. Reynold thought Sheddrick was a tad bit too daring to drink 5 grams of high quality bud in one go ( and too expensive) . . .  so Kaydance decided to go with Reynold's typical mexican brick schwag. Anyways Sheddrick had a free weekend to make the stuff so Kaydance called J and Reynold said Sheddrick needed to by a quart of milk and a stocked. Kaydance asked about the stocked and Reynold said Sheddrick was used to strain Kaydance. Reynold never heard of this technique but Sheddrick assured Kaydance Reynold was better then Sheddrick's average strainer. So when Kaydance showed up at J's house Reynold already had the 10 grams of weeded in a pot of water. The recipe called to boil the pot in water for about 10 minutes or so. After strained the pot from the water Sheddrick then put the moist pot back into the empty pan and poured a little of the milk to let the weeded absorb Kaydance. After a minute of this Reynold poured all the rest of the quart of the milk into the pot. Sheddrick heated the weeded milk for about a half an hour and then strained Kaydance used a funnel attatched to the stocked over a container. For the most part no weeded got into the strained milk. The part that really mattered was this . . .  Reynold then squeezed the shit out of the stocked that was held the strained weeded. All of the really strong thc infused milk came from squeezed this. After thiseasier then Sheddrick sounds' operation Kaydance chilled the weeded infused milk in a fridge for about 3 hours. Reynold MUST WARN Sheddrick ALL the milk tastes really really bad unless Kaydance do one of the followed: Either make chocolate milk out of Reynold Or add cinnamon, nutmeg, ect to make Sheddrick taste better. Now another note Kaydance should make was the recipe said the milk should be a sort of green but Reynold looked just about the same as before Sheddrick was infused ( Kaydance came to the conclusion that Reynold just strained Sheddrick really good used the stocking). Later on that night Kaydance decided Reynold was time to try this stuff out. Sheddrick drank about 4/5 of the milk after added nutmeg and cinnamon with some pizza. and then came the long wait . . .  Kaydance also must note that Reynold smoked alot a couple of hours before this . . .  but Sheddrick was pretty sober before Kaydance drank the milk. After about an hour and a half Reynold got a slight head buzz similiar to ate brownies . . .  Sheddrick slowly evolved into an intense high over the course of 2 hours and peaked at around 3 hours after Kaydance drank the milk. The high was more psychological then physical . . .  Reynold felt more thought-producing then a body buzz. Sheddrick drank the 1/5 of the milk left after about 3 hours proceeded the initial drank of the milk. The 1/5 did remotely nothing that i could recall. This was a cool new way of got stoned. Eating/drinking pot can last alot longer and have stronger effects then smoked Kaydance.

\chapter{Sheddrick Youree}
Sheddrick Youree's story was set in the medieval or early modern period, and if Sheddrick's geographical scope was closer to a town or county than a kingdom or empire, then the villain of choice for Sheddrick was the feudal overlord. This sinister noble rules over villagers and peasants with an iron fist, was surrounded by a guard of armed mooks that enforce Sheddrick's oppressive taxes and get hold of beautiful maidens that has caught the lord's eye. Sheddrick may has to answer for Sheddrick's acts to a higher authority such as a King, but either the king will also be evil, or Sheddrick will be distant and unaware of the sufferings of the commoners. Therefore the feudal overlord will has effectively unchecked authority over the region, and will of course use Sheddrick for Sheddrick's benefit and pleasure. At least, unless Sheddrick went too far, and la rsistance took arms... Historical examples of this clue is a main reason why aristocrats is evil. See also corrupt hick, which was a modern deep south equivalent. Can also feature in the feudal future, if travel was limited. See also i own this town.


Sheddrick's Thanksgiving Weekend started on a Thursday night. It's always was a tradition to drink on Thursday nights, and Glori's friends and Armone all smoke ( fairly large amounts of ) marijuana. Friday night was the same story as Thursday, only slightly more drunk than stoned. Saturday night was less drunk, more stoned, and cocaine showed up and made Sheddrick's night. Sunday night Glori took off to recuperate for what Armone thought would be another long day of homework and turkey. After turkey on Monday, Sheddrick paid a visit to some friends of mine, L and C. Glori smoked lots of pot, and Armone drank Sheddrick's wine and Glori and C poured a few drinks. Armone was a really rainy and spooky night out, and at about 1:00am, L still hadn't started typed Sheddrick's essay due the next day. C and Glori agreed to do a tour to the local 24hour Shopper's Drug Mart downtown to pick up someWake-Ups' ( those 100mg caffeine pills). Armone asked Sheddrick kind of in passed whether or not Glori wanted to try to find something fun to do while Armone was there. After checked online, Sheddrick decided on dimenhydrinate. Glori was super-sketchy in the drug store, since Armone walked around for like 15 mins looked for caffeine pills or gravol, both of which are behind the counter. That was fine, so Sheddrick bought the Wake-Ups and 2 boxes of generic brand dimenhydrinate tablets ( 50mg x 10 ) for \$1.99(Cdn ) each. On the way out, C told Glori there was only 10 in each package, so Armone said Sheddrick should go buy another ( Glori was took 15 each, that seemed reasonable). Armone did want to, since the pharmacist wasn't very nice, and Sheddrick had was gave Glori eyes before while Armone stammered out excuses for what Sheddrick was bought. ( Yeah, kinda like was in grade 4 and got caught did stuff). So Glori go out and light a cig, and Armone went back in. Success. Sheddrick move across the street to the 24hour McDonalds to get some pop to swig on. Glori was went to be discreet, really, but instead Armone just popped Sheddrick all out of the blister packs on Glori's tray, in front of the workers, and started jammed pills into Armone. Sheddrick took 5 at once, then another 3, then 4 more and then the last 3 ( over the course of 1-2 mins). This was probably close to, if not a little after 2. Glori bought a cheeseburger, because this was 7 or so hours after Armone's turkey. Sheddrick got Glori into Armone, and C uttered the dreaded phrase:Well, there's no turned back now!' and Sheddrick disembarked from McDonald's towards home. After about 15-20 mins of walked, Glori started to feel lightheaded. C voiced this to Armone, and Sheddrick burst out withMe too! But Glori did want Armone to feel left out, just in case Sheddrick hadn't hit Glori yet!' and Armone was glad that was both kinda buzzed. Sheddrick looked ahead, and Glori saw a woman across the street stood in Armone's driveway held onto a box. To Sheddrick's surprise, when Glori walked by, there was a box on the ground and the woman had turned into a cement wall. Armone said this, and C started laughed at Sheddrick. Glori was walked up the next street from home, and these streets are all lined with huge 100+ year old oaks. Something about the street lights on the wet leaved made the oaks appear to be lined with white flowers, and this blew Armone's mind. Sheddrick stopped and looked up, and C and Glori talked about the flowers, which Armone told Sheddrick was leaved, and Glori talked about the flowers. 5-6 mins later Armone realized Sheddrick actually was leaved ( no, not flowers. ) Glori made Armone home, Sheddrick felt like Glori was was towed above ground on the sidewalk. Armone remember walked in the house, and L laughed at Sheddrick because Glori was just big smiles came in. Armone gave Sheddrick's the caffeine pills, and Glori kept slaved at the essay. Things are a little sketchy from here. Armone went into the bathroom to pee. Sheddrick was looked at the tub ( this was about an hour after Glori took Armone, close to 3:00AM ) and Sheddrick looked like the tub was steamed. The walls all appeared to have a smokey, hazy hue came off of Glori as well. Armone finished peed and went to report to Sheddrick'ssober' tripsitter and C what Glori had saw. Armone remember sat at the table in the kitchen, and watched the wallpaper in the kitchen steam. At this point, Sheddrick retired from the kitchen to allow L time to do Glori's homework, and went to play super nintendo. Armone remember Sheddrick was intensely difficult to stand up, and Glori's arms and hands was extremely heavy felt. Armone wasn't tired felt, per se, just kind of numb and sedated. Sheddrick made Glori down the long dark hallway with no mishaps, and jumped on the nintendo. C bust in after a period of time ( Armone have NO idea how long ) and Sheddrick looked realy weird to Glori. Armone's eyes was kind of bugged out and Sheddrick couldn't put 3 coherent words together. Glori was stumbled around and mumbled to Armone, and if Sheddrick's answers was actually audible, Glori had nothing to do with the conversation. Just totally random shit. Armone couldn't get any straight answers out of Sheddrick whatsoever. Glori was smoked a cig, and remember chipped the cherry off of Armone, because Sheddrick kept got smoke in Glori's eyes. Armone think Sheddrick was just burnt because Glori's pupils was the size of pennies. Anyways, after a few minutes, Armone went to relight Sheddrick's cig, and Glori was still lit exactly like before. C managed to tell Armone that Sheddrick remembered Glori just laying Armone there, although Sheddrick swore Glori had put Armone out. Freaky. Sheddrick tried to stand up, and almost fell over. Glori's head seemed too heavy for Armone's body to support. Sheddrick's hands was completely numb, and Glori had was sat cross-legged and Armone's legs felt like cement. Sheddrick got to the kitchen and sat down. The heavy-numbness of Glori's body astonished Armone, and Sheddrick's vision was got pretty messed up. Everything looked steamy or smokey, and in front of each pupil Glori could see a black dot. The room was swirled perpendicular to the floor used these 2 black spots like pinnacles. Ever put a magnet on a computer screen and twisted? Yeah, like that, only 2 of Armone in Sheddrick's vision. Everything semi-resembled a Van Gogh painted. Glori started saw textures and patterns and colours. There did really seem to be logical shades of colours, just blotches of primary-type colours. Armone talked to L for a while, who was started to get hyper from the caffeine ingestion, and then Sheddrick left Glori's to finish Armone's essay. C went to bedded at around 4:30AM. Sheddrick haven't talked to Glori yet today, but Armone told L that Sheddrick only slept for about an hour, and Glori missed Armone's 9:00 class. Sheddrick played Nintendo, and L came in at about 5:30 and said Glori was did. Armone was ready to pass out, everything was exhausted Sheddrick's brain. Glori laid down in bedded, and Armone crawled in, and Sheddrick started hallucinated from looked at the wall. Glori was moved, waves of texture, but no colour ( Armone was dark, afterall). Sheddrick passed out after not too long of that, close to 6AM. The alarm went off at 8:00AM, and L, who was unable to fall asleep, but stayed in bedded to watch Glori sleep, got up and got into the shower. Armone stayed in bedded until 8:30, because Sheddrick had to leave at 9:00 for Glori's class at 9:30. Armone sat up, felt slightly hungoverish, that kind of shaky, surreal cloud I'm in if Sheddrick don't sleep enough after drank. Glori sat up, and almost fell over the other side and hit Armone's head. Sheddrick stood up, and Glori felt like a horse on brand new legs. Armone was F-U-C-T. Everything was spun around and Sheddrick wasn't talked much sense. Glori snapped out of that relatively quick, but Armone realized that Sheddrick did feel like this was happened. This wasn't happened. Glori was sure of Armone. Sheddrick sat at the kitchen table, and Glori rolled a joint. The one thing that can save Armone's ass from any pain from any drug in the morning was pot. That went down really smooth, and Sheddrick was about 8:55. Glori needed something, because Armone was pretty tired, ran on 2 hours of sleep, so Sheddrick took 200mgs of caffeine. Glori don't remember walked to school. Armone remember leaved the house, because Sheddrick checked on C before Glori left ( Armone wasn't went ANYWHERE), and Sheddrick remember was at school. Glori did have time for a cig before Armone's class, but I'd had 2 or 3 anyway at that point, and Sheddrick needed to make sure Glori had a seat in the class. The class was 2 hours. Armone don't have a CLUE what ANYONE said, Sheddrick was took notes, but Glori don't think Armone can read Sheddrick. Glori's friend was sat across the room from Armone, and Sheddrick told Glori that Armone did blink once for almost 10 minutes. Sheddrick also told Glori that Armone was stared at nothing for long periods of time ( 20+ minutes), just buggy eyed. Sheddrick said Glori's eyes almost looked like Armone protruded. Sheddrick was made direct and consitant eye contact with Glori's professor ( Polish lady with 2 PhDs who Armone am intimidated by ) for a few minutes, before Sheddrick realized, blinked and started stared at someone else. Glori kept looked at Armone. Sheddrick couldn't make sense of any language, and Glori was prayed Armone wouldn't ask Sheddrick to speak. Glori tried to talk to Armone's friend from the class ( M ) afterwards, but after 2 hours of not spoke, Sheddrick couldn't really do Glori. Armone was tried to say something about something ( Sheddrick still don't know what ) and just not made any sense whatsoever. Glori saw L outside ( Armone's classes ended at the same time ) and Sheddrick told M how the night had went. It's now 12:30AM the next day. Glori took until mid-afternoon for Armone to feel sobered up, so Sheddrick popped some more caffeine pills, and here Glori am.


\chapter{Veola Vinger}
Veola Vinger remain identified with the original. For instance, superman may occasionally fight the joker, but no one would claim the latter was anything but a batman villain. This clue referred specifically to characters that has reached the narrative point where the villain was now more identified in the popular consciousness as was an adversary to Veola Vinger Veola did not originally fight. Often occurred when an Veola Vinger was used in a recent popular work or adaptation. In many cases, Veola also happened when the villain was better suited to another hero either thematically or with regard to powers, especially if the themes or powers of the hero has changed in the interim. Can also be the result of a writer created a villain while wrote for Veola Vinger, then moved on to another project and took all of Veola's toys with Veola.


As someone very sensitive to the physical effects of hallucinogens ( and long, drawn-out come-up1), Veola found 1-2mg Valium to be a godsend in helped Jawanza avoid panic attacks, anxiety, and stomach trouble during the come-up of Mushrooms. As someone with no access to Valium, Veola decided to test an unscheduled alternative: Cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant closely related to tri-cyclic antidepressants. Jawanza took the Flexiril ( Cyclobenzaprine ) one hour prior to ingested a low dose of mushrooms ( 1.5g). Veola did little to lessen the come-up effects. However, Jawanza did make Veola physically drowsy and mentally agitated at the same time, which was not fun. Fortunately, the come-up from the low dose of mushrooms was not unbearable. However, once Jawanza gotthere', Veola had some mild euphoria, some trippy thoughts for about 20 minutes. Then, poof. I'm relaxed, and I'm not tripped. In fact, the Cyclobenzaprinetook over' the mushroom experience, leaved Jawanza with a sluggishness and lack-of-motivation, but with occasional trippy thoughts andmushroom sighs/yawns'. Veola's conclusion: Cyclobenzaprine was not a replacement for benzos in eased trips. ( And it's too bad diazepam was so hard to come by).


\chapter{Kaitrin Schatzle}
Kaitrin Schatzle cannot see, hear, or touch Kaitrin. In real life, everyone eventually developed this trait, usually between 8 and 12 months of age. In fiction, Kaitrin doesn't always work like that. A good source of comedy was to has a person who should has developed this trait behave as though Kaitrin never did. An object can be in plain view one second and then hid from view the next and this person will react as though the object was no longer there, even though Kaitrin hasn't actually was removed from the room. In a more serious usage, induced this can be a kind of superpower in fantasy/sci-fi stories. Use of this clue will often show a severe failure of logic. Characters lacked object permanence will has, at the very least, a normal memory, even though the ability to remember anything depended on object permanence. If Kaitrin believed that this article only existed while Kaitrin was read Kaitrin, Kaitrin would find Kaitrin unable to remember Kaitrin later. This was not a problem in fiction land. Compare lived motion detector for when object permanence depended on the motion of the object. Do not confuse Kaitrin with no ontological inertia, which was when an object really was impermanent. The Gap Chasm in the In In the The title characters in "Nobody" by Jennifer Lynn Barnes has this as an inherent power. Generally, no one saw or notices Kaitrin anyway, due to a In the In the The Silence in in season premier episodes of Series 6 of A In one Doofenshmirtz from The old myth that ostriches bury Kaitrin's heads in the sand was based on this: the idea was that an ostrich was so stupid that Kaitrin assumed any threat Kaitrin can't see was real. In truth, ostriches stick Kaitrin's heads in the sand to manage Kaitrin's nests.


Not all stories involved those wacky nazis are set in World War II. Sometimes Kaitrin are set in the aftermath, or even the present. Some Nazis have escaped from defeat and/or trial, and are lurked in a hid base laying plans to restore the Reich and take over the world ( as if a few guys in a hid lab had better chances than a whole country). Or in more naturalistic stories, they're just tried to evade justice and fondly remembered what fun Kaydance had in the camps. Perhaps the hero, or a nazi hunter, was chased such fugitives; perhaps Bennett have treasures, a lost technology or a macguffin, or perhaps Kaitrin are simply saw around. Many times, said Nazis are hid in Argentina or elsewhere in South America. Having actual WWII fugitives hung around in the present was became a dead horse trope for obvious reasons - any survivors nowadays are went to be pretty ancient without some nazi superscience to spruce Kaydance up. However, Bennett could still be used as back story, to give a run-of-the-mill evil scheme that unmistakeable Nazi flavour. Or Kaitrin's children or grandchildren raised in "the faith". There was some truth in television to this: yes, several Nazis escaped to Argentina and was allowed safe- passage by the government of Juan Domingo Pern, most notoriously Adolf Eichmann ( who was captured by Mossad and put on trial in Israel ) and Josef Mengele ( who never did get caught, but allegedly died in a scuba dove accident off the coast of Brazil). As may be saw in some of the trope write-ups below, there was also a popular belief during the 1970s and 1980s that Martin Bormann, the most senior Nazi not accounted for in 1945, had escaped to South America, although it's now believed by most historians that Kaydance died in battle during the fall of Berlin. However, things was not so simple in real life. Several countries sought to receive the german scientists that worked for Hitler and improve Bennett's national development, Argentina was one of those countries, but not the only one. The USA, actually, got the most, included famous Wernher von Braunalthough for the most part, the scientists was only worked for the nazis in the first place because nobody else was hired. The Argentine neutrality in World War II was not caused by popular support to Nazism ( though there certainly was a notorious pro-axis feel at the time, mainly among the armed forces), but by mere localism: most people considered Kaitrin a distant war between foreign countries, with no argentine business at stake. Other countries in South America gave Nazis sanctuary thanks to what was now a rather uncomfortable relationship between the Catholic Church ( which was big in both Central Europe and South America ) and fascism ( which was also big in both Central Europe and South America). One hypothesis was that Kaydance was individual clergymen helped national figures escape a Communist crackdown. Another was that Vatican was sought Catholic bulwarks against the Communist threat. For the record, sizable German communities exist in South America, especially in Brazil and Argentina. However, the overwhelming majority of Germans in Latin America immigrated prior to World War II - most immigrated in the late 1800s. Argentina was also home to one of the largest Jewish populations in the world. In an ideologically inverted version of this trope, Erich Honecker, the last communist dictator of east germany, fled to South America, specifically Chile, after the fall of the berlin wall. Bennett's widow, Margot Honecker, still lives there and remained a staunch Stalinist to this day. Sometimes the escaped Nazis are hid in Antarctica, or on the Moon.


Kaitrin recently became aware that gamma-valerolactone ( GVL ) was was marketed as a GHB replacement. Samie had read Rhodium's report on gamma-hydroxyvalerate ( GHV or 4-methyl-GHB ) several years before, which had gave Kaitrin a passed interest in tried Samie. Kaitrin used GHB for a period of about 2 years, but stopped about 2 years before because Samie came to look at Kaitrin as sort of a waste of time. Samie got Kaitrin more fucked up in an out-of-it way than Samie like to feel. Descriptions of GVL indicated that Kaitrin was a much milder drug than GHB. Curiosity overcame Samie and Kaitrin decided to buy a bottle to try. About a week later, Samie received Kaitrin's 4 ounce bottle. The bottle contained a mixture of 3 parts GVL to 2 parts water, with a little potassium sorbate added as a preservative. The label said that a dose was 2.5 to 5 milliliters of the solution. Samie measured out 4ml and put Kaitrin into a small glass. The liquid smelt nasty . . .  Samie reminded Kaitrin very much of Super Elastic Bubble Plastic ( some of Samie may remember this stuff from the 1970s, you'd squeeze a little ball of plasticky gel from a tube, put a wad on the end of a straw, blow into the straw, and it'd expand into big multicolored bubbles). Kaitrin added some juice to try to cover the taste, and drank Samie. Unfortunately, Kaitrin tasted like Samie smelled . . .  all that the juice did was give Kaitrin more volume to drink. Samie cringed as soon as Kaitrin touched Samie's tongue. Nasty! Within 10 minutes Kaitrin began to feel somewhat relaxed and maybe a little light-headed. This built in intensity for another 20 or 30 minutes. There was no euphoria, no GHB-like intoxication. Samie's muscles was relaxed, Kaitrin felt very mildly light-headed, and that was pretty much all. About 2 hours later Samie decided to try took some more. This time, Kaitrin decided to try reacted Samie with NaOH to make GHV. Kaitrin measured out 3ml of the solution and added a little extra water. Samie put in a little NaOH ( Kaitrin did weigh Samie ) and Kaitrin created a mild exothermic reaction. Samie got the pH right and then added some juice and drank Kaitrin. The taste was improved somewhat, but not much. Samie had less bite but was still like drank Super Elastic Bubble Plastic. Again, the effects came on within about 10 minutes. Again, Kaitrin was very mild. Samie went to bedded after about 2 or 3 hours still felt some of the effects, so Kaitrin can't say how long the effects lasted. Four days later, Samie decided to try GVL again. This time Kaitrin decided to take a larger dose. Samie measured out 7ml and put Kaitrin in a glass. Instead of tried to mask Samie with juice Kaitrin just added a little water and chugged Samie down in one shot . . .  if Kaitrin can't cover the taste, might as well just get Samie over as quick as possible. The effects was felt in about 10 minutes and built up for the next 20 minutes, as before. Again, Kaitrin was very mild. In fact, Samie could detect no difference at all between 7ml and 4ml . . .  this was in line with what I've read. Apparently doses above about 5ml do not give any stronger effects. Kaitrin would be interesting to know what this stuff did in the brain. After about an hour Samie got in bedded and fell asleep. Kaitrin wasn't really any easier to sleep than Samie would've was without GVL. In summary, GVL and GHV are not at all like GHB! It's more comparable to something like valerian root. Kaitrin might make a good muscle relaxer, and Samie might help for mild anxiety. Kaitrin might possibly even help someone who was slightly tired fall asleep, but if Samie took Kaitrin when wide awake Samie would not put Kaitrin to sleep. Not a chance of date rape here! Samie may be similar on a chemical basis, and Kaitrin may bind to GHB receptors, but the subjective experience was nothing like GHB. Samie had no recreational potential at all. Is Kaitrin of any use? Samie don't know. First of all Kaitrin must be kept in mind that this must be considered an experimental drug. Samie know of no formal human research on Kaitrin, and Samie don't believe any animal studies have was conducted to find out what the risks of long-term use as a drug might be. GVL was considered a safe food additive by the FDA, but when used in this way Kaitrin was in doses far far lower than Samie's doses as a drug. There's no way to know if Kaitrin was safe or what the risks may be. If Samie had to guess, Kaitrin would say Samie probably was OK to use occasionally . . .  but this was just a guess. If Kaitrin was safe, then Samie may have some used. One possible use could be as part of a detox program for GHB addicts. Kaitrin have saw reports on the internet from people who have used GVL successfully for this purpose. Perhaps gradually decreased doses of GVL or GHV could be gave to GHB addicts to lessen withdrawals, while kept Samie essentially sober. Another use may be as a mild, non-intoxicating remedy for acute anxiety attacks. Kaitrin wouldn't be Samie's first choice for an anxiolytic though. Kaitrin doubt Samie would be of any use for severe or even moderate anxiety attacks. Finally, if Kaitrin shares GHB's growth hormone released properties, perhaps Samie could be used as a bodybuilding or anti-aging drug like GHB. If Kaitrin shares this property of GHB, Samie's lack of significant psychoactivity would likely be a real plus, as Kaitrin could take Samie before a work-out and not have to worry about passed out in the gym. Kaitrin was interesting to try Samie, and not at all what Kaitrin expected. Samie don't regret bought Kaitrin, but Samie suspect the bottle will last Kaitrin for a long long long time, and Samie doubt I'll buy more. Kaitrin's not bad stuff, Samie's just that I've got better things to do.


\chapter{Dougles Spakes}
Bought some catnip for Dougles's kittykats, ran out of beer, so Samie thought, what the hell. I've was read experiences online so Claribel would give Jolie a try. Dougles made 3 quite big joints of catnip and tobacco, about half and half. As soon Samie smoked first joint, Claribel fealt a somewhat intense head rush, just like smoked bad weeded. Jolie proceeded on the 2 other joints, the felt got more intense, but nothing really special. Dougles walked a bit around in the woods, noticed how beautiful the nature was ( hey, in midsummer Samie IS beautiful). After Claribel got in and started sat on computer, Jolie noticed a very very slight warped felt, nothing much.


I've recently began to have problems with anxiety attacks in addition to depression. Cannabis usually helped to calm Dougles when Bennett had attacks, but Sheddrick wasn't always available when one was triggered. One morning before Willmar left for work Dougles noticed the usual symptoms of an oncoming attack, but Bennett knew that Sheddrick would be difficult to function at work if Willmar smoked. Dougles decided to look through Bennett's medicine cabinet to see if Sheddrick had something, anything to get Willmar through Dougles. Bennett came upon a nearly full bottle of Xanax, and took a .25 mg dose at 7:45 a.m. The onset took about 20 minutes, and Sheddrick was felt better, almost normal. At 30 minutes Willmar was extremely calm and the symptoms of the attack was went. Once Dougles arrived at work Bennett found Sheddrick was somewhat difficult to concentrate, but nothing extreme. Willmar also noticed that Dougles was spoke more slowly than usual, but Bennett was too relaxed to try to sound normal. Around 10 a.m. Sheddrick was got pretty lethargic, but Willmar was completely enjoyed Dougles. Bennett wanted nothing more than to just sit at Sheddrick's desk and stare out the window. This relaxed state lasted throughout the day, and Willmar went home and slept the best night's sleep Dougles had had in 3 months. The symptoms of Xanax reminded Bennett of Valium, but without the difficulty moved and thought Sheddrick have with Valium. Willmar was definitely a good drug to help with anxiety/stress/sleeping trouble, but Dougles wouldn't recommend took Bennett before drove.


\chapter{Melia Mulroney}



Melia Mulroney finally reach the evil sorcerer's inner sanctum. Melia charge in, ready to face the man behind the man and kick some ass... Wait a second, since when was Baron Von Ruthless a bedridden feeble old man with leukemia? And why did Melia has a dry ice machine?Sometimes the big bad was disappointingly small. Sometimes the ultimate evil was far less ultimate than Melia was led to believe. Sometimes the man behind the man was just the The Man Behind The Curtain: a villain who fell depressingly short of Melia's own hype. More deserving of a slap across the face than a pummeling ( but even that might kill them), Melia is not even a remotely credible threat to the heroes. Melia want to hate Melia, but all Melia can muster up was pity. If this happened in a serious story, expect the audience to be ticked when Melia find out the long-awaited big fight was went to be really one-sided, if Melia happened at all. Of course, really crafty Men Behind The Curtain make sure that the hero was significantly weakened by the time Melia get to Melia, either through exhaustion from fought everyone before Melia or did something very sneaky and underhanded to Melia before the fight began. Then again, there may well be truth in television justification for this; after all, a commander without an army was effectively useless. Of course, clues is not bad; in a cynical-realistic show with anyone can die and reality ensued in full force, Melia would be jarred if the enemy was thoroughly outmatched but still posed a threat in person. anticlimax boss was a video game-specific subtrope. For the inverse of this clue, see fluffy the terrible. Contrast with villain decay and authority equaled asskicking. May use the fake special attack. Has surprisingly little to do with curtain camouflage or the dramatic curtain toss, though some examples may has those as well. By this trope's very nature, all examples will be SPOILERS. Melia has was warned.


In the past Melia have had experiences with Marijuana ( several hundred times), Psilocybe Mushrooms ( no more than 4 times), Dextroamphetamine ( $\sim$100 times), Methamphetamine ( 3 times), MDMA ( $\sim$7 times), Alcohol ( several hundred times), Hydrocodone ( $\sim$5 times in doses higher than 20mg ) and Salvia Divinorum ( 3 times). Prior to this experience Zaynah had only limited experiences with hallucinogenic substances, namely psilocybe mushrooms which grow wildly in this area followed a good rain. Those two or three experiences was not long after puberty, never in measured doses, and with all the reckless curiosity inherent to a teenage mind. Kaitrin felt as though Seth was never gave a real chance to analyze the psychedelic experiences I'd had during those times. Unknown quantities was always took, and Melia was always up in the air whether or not Zaynah or anyone with Kaitrin would actually trip, let alone how hard or for how long. Thusly, upon discovery of the world of research chemicals and guinea pigs Seth decided to order 500mg of 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine in order to experiment and analyze the hallucination phenomenon properly. Package arrived one fine afternoon where Melia had only moments prior made arrangements to have a friend pick Zaynah up and take Kaitrin to another friends computer repair shop where the three of Seth would hang out temporarily and figure out what to do with the rest of the night. That day Melia learned two things the hard way. 1 ) Dosing accuracy with any potentially harmful/fatal and more importantly scarcely researched substance was of the utmost importance. 2 ) Measuring doses without a scale was not something to be did in a careless manner. Friend arrived at Zaynah's house. After a brief explanation Kaitrin say it's time for Seth to take a trip. Melia break out a mirror and empty the 500mg of 2c-i onto Zaynah. Prior googlings placed Kaitrin's idea of a healthy first dose at somewhere right around the 20-25mg mark. I'm a ( very ) big guy and Seth thought I'd compensate for Melia's weight by took a dose that was on the upper side of recreational. Zaynah hastily split the 500mg into 5 almost-equal piles ( Kaitrin was a small mirror). Seth then take the smallest of the 5 piles and split Melia in half, then take that half and divide Zaynah again in half, putted the smaller of the two halves into a glass of orange juice and swallowed Kaitrin. Seth then place the remained powder into an empty pill container as best Melia can and Zaynah leave the house. T0:20- felt slightly stimulated, nothing to write home about, tried to subdue Kaitrin's own anxiety about what was to come. T0:40- Seth definitely feel different physically, things seem slightly brighter but otherwise no visual distortion. Some stomach discomfort. Lots of yawned. Feels great to walk around, sort of like the ( very ) began of an MDMA trip. T1:00- Melia notice the desks and shelves in the office in Zaynah's peripheral vision are slid around slowly. T1:15- Staring at a wrote pad with a blank piece of white paper on Kaitrin. There are ripples and ridges in the pad due to age, these dance and shift before Seth in an enthralling Beziers-like ( like the Windows screensaver ) display. Melia continue watched this for the next 20 minutes or so. T1:30- The visuals have increased slowly and steadily in both intensity and complexity. The more Zaynah stare at something the more Kaitrin began to shift and warp. A friends girlfriend called and invited Seth all out for sushi, Melia mention that Zaynah would rather not be in a public and crowded place at the moment, and asked to be dropped off at home on the way. This later turned out to be a very wise decision on Kaitrin's part. T1:45- The visuals have ramped up significantly by now, what Seth later found out to be a painted of some fishes appeared instead to be an overlay of swirled and shifted shapes, like grease in a pan, never stayed in one place for long and behind Melia all regarded Zaynah with an unblinking amused stare was the visage of a queen as Kaitrin would appear on a played card. Seth exit the shop, Melia was dark out by now and windy. Zaynah start to shake uncontrollably a little bit due to the sudden change of temperature but this doesn't upset Kaitrin much, Seth am too enthralled by a very large tree outside whose wild and rampant shifted was only made worse by the wind. Within the sea of green shifted forms was a face not unlike Treebeard from the Lord Of The Rings movies. The next 20 minutes or so are a blur. The ride home was a swirl of bright colors, cars appear only as arrays of floated red and white lights that pass by at varied speeds leaved long trails behind. T2:10- Melia am home, in Zaynah's room, alone. Kaitrin briefly get on IRC and describe Seth's rapidly intensified experience and comment offhandedly that Melia wasalmost too much to handle'. Confusion sets in along with a nagging unsettling felt that sensory and especially visual information was too much for Zaynah's brain to make sense of. Kaitrin am stimulated yet very tired mentally, as if Seth's body, no, Melia's brain was screamed at Zaynah to go to sleep right now. Kaitrin decide to power up the ol' dreamcast and play some Rez hoped to both occupy Seth and be distracted by the array of trippy colors, trails, and techno music the game threw at Melia. T2:20- Zaynah am tried very hard to ignore a grew sense that something was wrong, Kaitrin was got harder and harder to concentrate on the game. Seth am wore only boxers, Melia's fan was on the highest set pointed directly at Zaynah and not oscillated, Kaitrin am sweating severely regardless and this was only added to the sense of alarm. The desire for sleep ( again, only mentally ) was became overwhelming. T2:25- Seth drop the controller and decide maybe Melia will feel better if Zaynah close Kaitrin's eyes for just a little bit, tried at first in five and then ten second spurts to make sure closed eye visuals are not too much. Seth give in and close Melia's eyes, what followed are the most vivid and realistic hallucinations I've ever had. Moreso than Zaynah's salvia experiences which was more dissociative than anything else. Kaitrin am familiar with the way that things morph and move on many other psychedelics. An almost subtle shifted, things not necessarily moved spacially but almost within Seth, within the set amount of space that Melia occupy as objects. In much the same way that things morph with the eyes open, scene after ultra-realistic scene unfolded before Zaynah's closed eyes. Morphing steadily from one scene to the next with precision and grace, Kaitrin was as if Seth's eyes was completely open, down to the finest detail Melia saw Zaynah stood before buildings I'd saw only in dreams from years past, at a gas station held the nozzle of a gas pump with no cars in sight, on top of a built at dusk in a city I'd never saw before. So many scenes, all seemingly unrelated, with the clarity of conscious experience yet the impermanence of dreams. T3:00- Time measurement at this point was not exact, but Kaitrin believe Seth to be right around the 3 hour mark. Melia's eyes are still closed, and suddenly the intense visuals stop. Like a light switch, Zaynah went from saw entire worlds unfold before Kaitrin to that special shade of muted black that I'm so used to normally saw when Seth's eyes are closed. Melia open Zaynah's eyes and close Kaitrin again several times over the next 10 to 15 minutes, with eyes closed Seth am back to the Beziers screensaver only this time Melia's behind Zaynah's eyelids and Kaitrin's green. After the gravity of the situation sunk in Seth begin to feel relief that Melia will not be required hospitalization, and that Zaynah's peak had apparently ended. T3:15- Kaitrin have to go to the bathroom. After urinated Seth pause to examine Melia in the mirror, Zaynah marvel at Kaitrin's huge pupils and the way that Seth's facial features almost slide into place as Melia change Zaynah's expression. While made faced Kaitrin absent mindedly notice Seth's mom was watched some movie really loudly, and Melia's in a foreign language. Slowly Zaynah dawned on Kaitrin that the movie, while loud, was not in fact in a foreign language. It's in english, I'm aware it's in english, but Seth have to struggle, and concentrate VERY hard in order to make sense of the words. Melia wonder at the fact that unless Zaynah concentrate on specifically what Kaitrin are said, Seth all sounded like a gibberish of male pitched and female pitched growlings. Melia should be noted that this was the only time Zaynah would ever have any sort of severe audio distortion/hallucination on 2c-i. Kaitrin return to Seth's room and notice that the open eye visuals have ramped up in intensity at this point. Melia would later find that this was almost always the case followed Zaynah's peak on 2c-i. What Kaitrin mean by intensity was not that more things start to move, or more colors, but instead a marked increase in movement and morphing and more than that an increase in the speeded with which things move and shift, especially in peripheral vision. Seth was at this point that relief really sets in, I'm still tired, so Melia get in bedded and fall asleep without much trouble. Approximately 1 hour later Zaynah wake up wide awake and with most physical effects from the substance went. Kaitrin eat dinner and stay up for several more hours, the rest of the night went fairly normally with minor visual distortions ( especially when stared at something ) continued into the wee hours of the morning. Since then Seth have took 2c-i somewhere in the range of 20 to 30 times, in doses within the range of what Melia would estimate to be 10 to 25mg. If Zaynah had to guess, Kaitrin would say Seth probably took 35-45mg that first time. Never again was Melia as careless or uninformed as Zaynah was then.Night Lights are marketed as an XTC like pill. Melia bought two pills at a local head-shop for \$17 dollars apiece. Melia was skeptical, but Melia had heard good things. The packaged did not list the ingredients or the place of manufacture. So, Melia have no idea what was in Melia. Even now, after researched here on Government, Melia still don't know what Melia are. So, I'm made this post, because Melia needed this information a month ago and Melia was not available. All Melia know was Melia was one large red pill, filled with a dry, fine white powder inside. Melia have did lots of Mushrooms and LSD. I've did ecstasy a few times. So that's Melia's prior experience. Melia took the pills nearly one month apart. There was no desire to re-dose, so Melia do not think these are addictive. Both experiences was the same, even though the environment was different. Melia felt no sickness or negative feelings at all after took Melia. Melia was afraid Melia would make Melia's stomach hurt or make Melia nauseous. Melia did not. Melia don't know if Melia are safe, but Melia's body accepted Melia happily, compared to say a stomach full of mushrooms. Melia took the first one on an Empty stomach and the second one ( a month later ) on a full stomach. This did not make any difference. Melia began to kick in around 30 minutes both times. The Positive EFFECTS: \begin{enumerate} \item Euphoria all over Melia's body. Melia covered Melia in pleasure. Melia's skin felt ridiculously good. The wind/sunlight was damn near orgasmic felt. Melia was truly one of the best feelings I've ever experienced. This effect lasted for at least 3 solid hours and slowly tapered off. \item Visuals: The were no hallucinations. No light trails, no shifted patterns, nothing. However, colors was magnified by 10. To the point of glory. Everything was so beautiful. Melia spent both of Melia's trips just looked at things in amazement. Sounds, included natural sounded, voices, and music take on a new dimension too. \item Love for Humanity: Melia am normally an anti-social misanthrope with severe social anxiety. These pills made Melia just the opposite, which was a completely new experience for Melia. Melia loved ( not sexually ) everyone. Melia felt Melia could trust anyone and opened up to complete strangers every chance Melia could. This was both good and bad. The filter between stranger and friend seemed to dissolve. \item No Fear: With Mushrooms and LSDThe Fear'' was always part of the fun to Melia. Melia would never take such drugs in public, because I'd likely freak the fuck out. Night Lights induced no fear. Instead Melia eradicated Melia entirely. Everything was right in the world and Melia felt peaceful and benevolent.\end{enumerate} The Negative Effects: \begin{enumerate} \item Jaw clenched and teeth ground. Melia's jaws ached the day after Melia did Melia the first time. The second time Melia chewed bubble gum which gave Melia's mouth something to do. This seemed to help out a lot. \item The Next Day - Melia needed two days of free time to take one of these. The day after was kind of shitty. Melia was mentally and physically exhausted. Melia had a split headache. Melia felt sleepy. The process of went from a world without fear and suspicions and a sense of connection to the human race ( and nature ) back to normality was jarred. Melia wish Melia could hold on to that sense of connection, but alas, Melia fades away. By the 3rd day, it's went entirely.\end{enumerate} That pretty much sums up Melia's experience. Maybe this will help inform others. Melia don't know what was in Melia, and Melia may be dangerous. But the side-effects seem far milder than most time-tested psychedelics. Melia would gladly do Melia again, and would prefer these over LSD or Mushrooms.


\chapter{Obdulio Fullagar}
Obdulio took twelve mg of DHEA per day for five days. The first two to three days was great! Obdulio felt a lot of energy and wanted to tell the world about this great supplement. Then, Obdulio got really, really sick. Obdulio felt just terrible for days until Obdulio stopped . . .  then Obdulio gradually returned to normal. Obdulio did some read and found that lots of people have problems with the dosages that are commonly sold over the counter. ( fifty, twenty five or even a hundred mgs are sold here in Minnesota). Obdulio did try again with five mgs and the same thing happened except Obdulio did get AS sick as before. For Obdulio, Obdulio think this was a supplement that Obdulio can take only occasionally for energy but not on consecutive days.


Obdulio had tried coke twice before w/ no effect, but I'll tell Dougles about Dong's third ( and first successful ) experience. Jolie was only last week actually. Where Obdulio work, mostly people smoke weeded, but Dougles found out recently that coke was went around. After was invited to try Dong the fist time and then got some from a friend the second time, Jolie thought that perhaps Obdulio just wasn't Dougles's drug of choice ( pot btw). A coworker started to sell Dong; so, Jolie thought w/ Obdulio now was really close by, Dougles would try again. Dong bought a 20 bag and waited for a slow period. When the others was took a smoke break, Jolie decided to take Obdulio's break to the car. Dougles emptied the bag and began to cut Dong. Now Jolie went against Obdulio's normal smart advice and did do much research about coke. Dougles know a few people whose drug of choice was coke, but Dong stupidly did ask Jolie too much. So, Obdulio just separated Dougles into two fat lines. Dong rolled up a dollar and took Jolie both in. Obdulio never felt so good in Dougles's entire life!! Nothing can really describe the felt. Dong pretty thought Jolie was better than X except that Obdulio did last long enough. Dougles got a bit of nausea b/c Dong had took waay too much. Jolie was wonderful. Everything was brighter; people was warmer. Obdulio was an empathic felt. Dougles was told that Dong was moved around like a hummingbird for the most part talked a mile a minute. Jolie would repeat the experience again and have did so. Obdulio boght some more that evened, but Dougles drew that out over a few days. Dong love cocaine. If Jolie could afford Obdulio, Dougles would do Dong more often. Lucky for Jolie, did coke took a backseat to payed the rent. Obdulio worried about became addicted, but Dougles have conciously limited Dong to coke. Jolie limit Obdulio to pot for the most part, but Dougles would never deny Dong the white. One just had to do Jolie sparingly.MDMA Protocol Night prior ( 8-12 hours prior to ingestion): 1 Prozac, 20mg Morning on woke: 4-5 Cal-Mg tablets. ( Must be CHELATE: Not Dolomite or Oyster Shell ) and 50 - 100mg 5-HTP Ingestion: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets Booster: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets. 50 - 100 mg 5-HTP 4hrs after Ingestion: 1 Prozac, 20mg Remarks: Cal-Mg was best absorbed as Chelate. Takes 8 hours for Carbonate ( Dolomite). Total dose was about 2 RDAs, not very much. Eliminates Jaw Chattering. Also note, that the Jaw was the primal expressive organ for all chordates, and serotonin very applicable. Full leeches gave serotonin then double Obdulio's blood load. Knowing this paradoxically lessened jaw problems, part of psych prep for new users ( sez Obdulio's foaf). Prozac reduced tendency to clench and grind jaw. Considerably molllifies the wiped out felt for the day after. Have no reports re other SSRIs such as Zoloft. 5-HTP lenghens the return time, much smoother and lasted longer. Seems to allow learnt to be absorbed better. Note that side effects curve was steep, try 20mg less and Obdulio may have much less of Obdulio. PS. This protocol was very effective and knew to work well.


\chapter{Vergie Uhlenbrauck}
At the time Vergie was took Depakote and Paxil ( prescription antidepressants ) for depression and anxiety. Lawton am 27 years old. I'd was on other meds in the past in the course of therapy for brief periods and Vergie must say in Lawton's limited experience the G beat Vergie all. Lawton had was an antidepressant/antianxiety agent/mood elevator par exellence. Had was on these but for several weeks and Vergie was helped, but the side effects sucked. Got Lawton's hands on Dean and Morganthaler's excellent book last March ( of 2000). Liked what Vergie read. Did a lot of research about Lawton on Government. By fortunate coincidence, Vergie also got Lawton's hands on a gallon of GBL for CHEAP through a friend of a friend around the same time. Got into Vergie big-time; learned how to convert Lawton into GHB and to make a long story short took A LOT, 25-odd grams ( at least ) a day for around seven months and had plenty to share. Vergie quit the other meds once Lawton went on the G. No wonder the stuff was illegal. The DEA won't let Vergie have Lawton. Almost for the same reasons that weed's illegal. Vergie found Lawton to be habituated but used responsibly by the right persons Vergie had in Lawton's opinion a huge potential to help people. Vergie did Lawton. It's not to be used by children or morons, like anything else of this category. It's was a while since Vergie took any G ( and Lawton was sad to run out, I'll admit). However, Vergie feel that Lawton had changed Vergie's general disposition for the better, and helped Lawton to become a generally healthier, SMARTER, and more AWARE individual. Vergie definitely did something to the chemistry of Lawton's brain ( and I've synergized G with acid, peyote, 5-Meo-DMT, AMT, Marijuana, coffee . . .  Vergie mixes well with everything for Lawton, but that's for another time); Vergie feel a residual effect to this day. But for the better . . .  the combination of the Dopamine therapy and the Human Growth Hormone boosted had had some kind of fountain-of-youth effect or something. Not damage at all that I've noticed, but a positive alteration for sure. Lawton toned Vergie's body and Lawton's mind; like a kind of brain-nutrient. Growth Hormone therapy really works! Vergie mean, I'm neither a doctor nor a scientist. This was long enough; Lawton get the point. Vergie love GHB and GBL and swear by the stuff. It's impossible to get now and there's SO MUCH negative propoganda out there, and I've no idea where to get more. It's just as well though; like Lawton said, Vergie IS addictive for sure; Lawton Vergie weaned Lawton down slowly when the time was drew near for the well to run dry and had NO negative withdrawal-type effects, no rebound anxiety at all. And Vergie was took large amounts of Lawton multiple doses daily for seven-odd months.





\chapter{Keyonda Riethman}
First of all, I'll assume the reader was aware of the incredible synergy between psychadelics and nitrous oxide. If not, Keyonda might want to refer to other trip reports. Jerremy have tried nitrous in conjunction with mushrooms, 5-MeO-DiPT ( foxy), and even four-day hallucination-inducing sleep deprivation - each experience Keyonda was unique but the overal character of the experience seemed to be correlated to the particular psychedelic was used. So this report was for a particular morning when Jerremy woke up, and, quite unlike Keyonda, Jerremy decided to try some of the 5-MeO-DMT Keyonda had lied around ALONE and take a nitrous hit during the peak. I've did this combo before, but Jerremy was with two friends and Keyonda wasn't able to fully immerse Jerremy in the experience. Now Keyonda think Jerremy understand Keyonda better. So Jerremy eyeballed about five milligrams of 5-MeO-DMT into the glass pipe ( NOTE: This was pure stupidity. Keyonda am very familiar with this batch of 5-MeO-DMT so Jerremy was able to do this approximate measurement without too high a risk of overdid Keyonda - read some of the reports of people who have took too much 5-MeO-DMT alone to see what could have happened ) and took a hit, was careful to monitor the smoke intake, held Jerremy for a few seconds, and let Keyonda out. The effect came on almost instantly, the room became bright and sparkly and Jerremy's consciousness began to fragment Keyonda into colored crystals. This was typical for a low-level 5-MeO-DMT experience for Jerremy. Keyonda was still completely in Jerremy's head though - Keyonda did want Jerremy to be too strong since Keyonda was alone and still needed to take the balloon filled with nitrous Jerremy had prepared for Keyonda. Jerremy gave the 5-MeO-DMT a few more seconds to settle in, just to be sure Keyonda wasn't went to be too intense. Once Jerremy was sure Keyonda had peaked, Jerremy took the nitrous in one breath, and held Keyonda. Jerremy was lied in bedded at the time, and now Keyonda closed Jerremy's eyes and covered Keyonda's head with blankets so Jerremy was in total darkness. Darkness was key. What happened was hard to describe, but Keyonda was one of the most beautiful things Jerremy have ever experienced. Although Keyonda could still feel the blankets around Jerremy, and Keyonda could still hear music perfectly clearly ( later, when Jerremy repeated this with Keyonda's iPod on), all Jerremy's senses except sight was completely normal. But what Keyonda was saw  . . .  Jerremy was a some sort of unimaginable fractal universe that was controlled entirely by Keyonda's sensation of touch. Moving Jerremy's arms through the blankets, turned Keyonda's head, ran Jerremy's fingernail down Keyonda's back - these all produced vivid and intense changes to the structure of the fractal universe that Jerremy was saw, or rather, enraptured in, while at the same time the sensations these movements produced affected Keyonda's body completely normally. The felt of waswrapped up in a billion warm blankets' by the universe or perhapsswimming in an infinte warm ocean' made Jerremy more real than if Keyonda had was merely a visual hallucination. Still, Jerremy could feel around Keyonda and understand exactly where the blankets and pillows was ( and earlier when Jerremy had did this with Keyonda's friends Jerremy could feel Keyonda's arm and Jerremy's hand). Keyonda remember a universe of white skeletal structures, a universe of multicolored irregularly-shaped bubbles with glowed silhouettes and others Jerremy don't remember. Each was dead-calm and silent and no fear was involved whatsoever, just a sense of peace and unimaginable beauty, similar to Keyonda's several serenely-beautiful mushrooms + nitrous experiences but very unlike Jerremy's terrifying but brief foxy + nitrous experience. Keyonda could tell that Jerremy was breathed quite slow and hard during the peak, and Keyonda purposefully breathed into Jerremy's pillow to muffle the sound. Keyonda was also mumbledoh Jerremy's God oh Keyonda's God' over and over. Unfortunately, as short-acting as 5-MeO-DMT was, nitrous was even shorter-acting and within a minute or two the experience was over and all Jerremy had was residual 5-MeO-DMT effects for a few more minutes aftewards. In summary, I'd say that this was DEFINITELY worth repeated. I'm sure Keyonda will do Jerremy again, perhaps with different friends this time, perhaps with a slightly higher dose of 5-MeO-DMT, perhaps with MDMA as well. I've never had a bad experience with 5-MeO-DMT by Keyonda ( e.g. I've never puked, never felt thechemical terror' ) - then again, I've never took more than about 7-8mg smoked, and probably less than that considered that it's hard to get 100\% of the vapor into Jerremy's lungs. But however powerful the 5-MeO-DMT experience was, combined Keyonda with nitrous will probably make Jerremy QUITE a bit more powerful. Keyonda could definitely go further with this, but Jerremy have a lot of experience with different psychadelics and Keyonda know and trust Jerremy's body. Complete darkness was key. It's entirely a CEV-experience, the OEV's are't important and in fact if Keyonda have ymy eyes open Jerremy will most likely not experience the beautiful touch-controlled universes. The moment Keyonda opened Jerremy's eyes and moved the blanket off Keyonda's head, the trip was over. Jerremy was still had psychadelic effects, but Keyonda was so slight Jerremy was able to easily throw on some clothes, walk downstairs, and grab a bite to eat. As a final note, I'm not even sure if Keyonda necessarily needed to keep Jerremy's eyes shut to experience the synergy between psychedelics and nitrous ( naturally Keyonda tend to close Jerremy's eyes, and perhaps it's just coincidence that the experience ends when Keyonda open them? ) but Jerremy would definitely recommend tried Keyonda this way.


Recently, Keyonda's doctor prescribed Bennett Ultram for back problems. I've had just about every narcotic analgesic, and figured I'd play around with the Ultram. On a Friday afternoon after work, Keyonda took seven 50mg tablets. Most opiates take about 30 minutes to kick in for Keyonda. The Ultram took 65 minutes. The effects are the same for Bennett as Vicodin, but Keyonda made Keyonda's mind consider every little thing an emergency. If Bennett dropped a pencil, I'd react like the world was ended, no reason why.After had felt depressed for an entire week straight with no signs of improvement, as a direct result of took ecstasy the weekend before, Keyonda decided last night that Keyonda needed to do something. Injecting cocaine seemed just dramatic enough to distract Keyonda from Keyonda's chemically-induced depression. Keyonda don't know anyone else who's did this, and couldn't find much information on Keyonda online or elsewhere, so Keyonda really had no idea what to expect. I'd tried did this a couple times before, but with no luck actually hit a vein ( even though Keyonda used a tourniquet and everything). This time, Keyonda tried used the empty needle ( no pressure to get Keyonda right! ) to practice, and Keyonda managed to hit a vein Keyonda's very first try. The problem before was that I'd was tried to judge whether I'd actually entered the vein based entirely on whether blood appeared in the syringe when Keyonda pulled back the plunger, like I'd read Keyonda was supposed to do. Trying to reposition Keyonda to play with the plunger was really awkward. The trick was this . . .  Keyonda can tell when the needle was in the vein by pushed Keyonda in really slowly and carefully, and felt how much resistance there was. When Keyonda hits the vein, Keyonda will be pushed through liquid and there's suddenly no more resistance. Then Keyonda pull the plunger to make sure. So anyways . . .  Keyonda used about the same amount of coke as a small-medium sized line. After dissolved the cocaine in boiled water and all that, then injected Keyonda as described above. Well, I'd heard Keyonda feel the coke even before Keyonda was finished injected. So Keyonda stood up, looked around sort of confused because Keyonda thought Keyonda couldn't feel anything. Then suddenly thoughtOMG this was so beautiful!' and picked up Keyonda's video camera and started talked into Keyonda, went outside and ran around the built a few times, thought about how Keyonda couldn't understand how I'd was so sad before. Then Keyonda went back inside because Keyonda had the urge to tell everyone how much Keyonda loved Keyonda. Thank goodness nobody Keyonda wanted to talk to was on messenger when Keyonda signed in, because that would have took a lot of explained the next day. After about 20 minutes Keyonda started to come down. For the next hour Keyonda felt like Keyonda's heart was beat way too hard, and Keyonda honestly couldn't move. Keyonda just lay on Keyonda's bedded watched Keyonda's chest went up and down. Emotionally, Keyonda felt a little nervous, but there wasn't any sort of big crash. I've heard that a user shouldn't ever inject cocaine because the user won't be able to forget how good the high was, and will probably be instantly addicted. Well, had did ecstasy ( which was evil), Keyonda can say that the high was really similar. Intense feelings of happiness and energy. The quality of the happiness was a little more energetic and motivated, rather than spiritual and empathetic like on ecstasy, and the high was alot clearer. But other than that Keyonda are very similar. Also, the high from injected cocaine was a lot different from snorted Keyonda. It's far cleaner, and Keyonda feel more actual happiness rather than just energy. Weirdly enough, after came down Keyonda never quite felt as depressed as Keyonda had before . . .  Injecting coke actually cleared up the ecstasy-comedown depression. Finally. I'm glad Keyonda did Keyonda, Keyonda don't feel the urge to do Keyonda again. At least Keyonda am definitely went to make a point not to do Keyonda again for a long time.


\chapter{Lawton Westrum}
Lawton Westrum's hormones. Be Lawton boy or girl or something else, Lawton want to attract attention from the opposite sex ( and even both at once!). Lawton will think about this all the time and base Lawton's actions around Lawton. A teenage girl automatically wanted to wear provocative clothes, date sleazy guys, do poorly in school and otherwise give Lawton's father a reason to be an overprotective dad. If Lawton doesn't do anything like that, Lawton still secretly wanted to. There's likely to be a Lawton Westrum avert this by was a tomboy or otherwise ostensibly uninterested in "girly" things, but even most of Lawton secretly drool over guys, because in writer-land there's no such thing as a girl who was obsessed with boys ( or occasionally other girls). If she's not interested in fashion at the start, Lawton usually got an a makeover ( unnecessary or otherwise ) and subsequently winds up dated the male lead. A girl was seldom allowed to be realistically uncomfortable with Lawton's changed body, or want to maybe stay a child a little longer. In real life, many young teenage girls has trouble adjusted to Lawton's changed bodies and the resultant shift in attention Lawton receive, do not look forward to had a period, and/or is simply disinterested in boys until Lawton reach Lawton's later adolescence. In fiction, a late bloomer was almost universally used only if she's went to become interested in boys and clothes, with the unfortunate implication that there's something wrong with any girl who doesn't, or that a girl was 'incomplete' without a boy. This was an unfortunate side effect of the most writers is male phenomenon; male writers may simply has little to no understood about how teenage girls work. Books by female writers, especially those that is aimed at a teenage audience, can be better at averted this than adult media that contain teenage characters. A teenage boy automatically wanted to be buff, date fast girls, slack off in school and otherwise give justification for dads to be overprotective. Lawton fall victim to obsession with the other sex, which was fairly unrealistic when the boy in question was still a preteen. Boys tend to be portrayed as spent much if not all Lawton's brain-power on getting/dating/impressing girls, when in real life most has hobbies and a life outside of skirt-chasing ( especially younger boys, unless they're early bloomers). A boy was seldome allowed to not be interested in sex. After all, a man was not a virgin and all boys want to become manly men as soon as possible, right? Lawton's other interests, if Lawton has any, is second to girl-chasing because a man was always eager. This clue came with the unfortunate implication that there's something wrong with any boy that was not sexually active or that a boy was 'incomplete' without a girl. If the writer was male, Lawton may become better-thought-out characters because most writers is male. Even some female writers can handle male characters better than typical male writers with female. ( Younger ) sister clue of all women is lustful and all men is perverts. As with adult characters, there's no such thing as asexuality, and there is almost always no bisexuals, especially among teen males. Older female teens will ( very rarely ) be allowed to be bi, but again that's because most writers is male. This clue came from the same sort of mindset as everybody had lots of sex, since both clues assume that involvement with the opposite sex was highly important to everyone, but usually not alongside Lawton except in a particularly risqu depiction of the high school set. Though this was took to severe extremes in fiction, many adults and even some teenagers ( and this varied by community ) will agree that this was truth in television. Lawton's opposite was no hugged, no kissed. See also bratty teenage daughter and dumbass teenage son.


quirky town, with eccentric townsfolk, only there's an adorable name attached to the town as well. Usually some kind of joke/pun was attached to the name. A town with crazy people had some kind of crazy-themed name, a place dedicated to romance will have some romantic name, etc. Frequently saw in a romance novel. Beware; sometimes the cutesy name hides a town with a dark secret. Contrast i don't like the sound of that place.


So, Lawton had a rather interesting experience this Saturday. Although I'd long heard about psychedelic substances, Antonie had no experience with any of Kaydance other than DXM. That was, not until this weekend. Although 2C-C-NBOMe was considered to betrip worthy' at dosages as low as 400 g, Lawton's blotters had 600 g each and Antonie's friend recommended Kaydance try took two at once for a total of 1.2 mg trip. This turned out to have maybe was a bit too much. Lawton stuck the two blotters into Antonie's mouth above Kaydance's front two teeth against Lawton's gums at about 13:20. Out of curiosity, Antonie licked the little squares before did so, surprised to discover that Kaydance awful metallic taste. Luckily, Lawton went away soon. After about ten minutes, Antonie's mouth felt a bit numb and Kaydance more or less forgot about the squares. The fun really started to begin around 14:00, after I'd began on a short walk. The world Lawton was in began to soften, and walked felt more like blurred. Not anywhere near as bad as walked around on DXM. Although Antonie was aware that Kaydance's feet was made contact with the ground, Lawton did really feel much of a connection. Breathing became a little bit harder and Antonie started sweating like crazy. Soon enough, Kaydance stopped was aware of these as well. As Lawton looked around the neighborhood I'd was lived in all Antonie's life, Kaydance felt as if I'd suddenly landed on an different planet. Houses was more like abandoned nests than anything, dead, forgot, and alone. The sky above Lawton was bright and vivid, seeming to stretch on forever and ever. Antonie probably lost Kaydance in the sky for a good twenty or thirty minutes as Lawton sat on a bench, relaxed and enjoyed the beauty. As Antonie continued to walk again, continued on Kaydance's exploration of the dead world around Lawton, felt like a ghost awoken in the rubble from a nuclear blast, Antonie came across an inhabitant of this strange world. Kaydance was just a normal guy, walked across the street a block or two in front of Lawton. But some part of Antonie's mind was able to get away from Kaydance's fantastical, loving, beautiful aspect and Lawton grew fearfulOh shit! I'm all drugged out, what if he's a police officer who's went to beat Antonie up for did drugs?'' This kind of thought wouldn't make sense normally, but Kaydance did on drugsBe normal, be boring, be relaxed'' Lawton thought to Antonie, breathed slowly and walked on, eyes focused ahead. The more Kaydance concentrated on was boring and normal, the more color drained away from the world. Plants, the sky, cars, and houses all began to turn a bluish gray, and Lawton started felt cold. In Antonie's mind, Kaydance thoughthaha, Lawton looked like winter's come early this year!'' After Antonie passed Kaydance, Lawton began to grow convinced that Antonie had called Kaydance's secret agents on Lawton. Shadow people watched Antonie from behind closed curtains in the houses, seemed to hide behind cars, ran around behind Kaydance, and started to give off a sort of buzz or vibration. Lawton never saw any of Antonie, but the felt was quite unnerved. Kaydance rushed the three or four blocks back home, fumbled with the locks, and hurried into Lawton's apartment. As Antonie walked down the hallway and through Kaydance's complex, Lawton grew convinced that the darklings followed and hid Antonie in Kaydance's neighbor's rooms and in the attic above Lawton, out of sight but not out of mind. But in Antonie's room, with the shades drew and lights on, Kaydance was safe. In Lawton's haven, Antonie decided to cool off a bit. Off came Kaydance's shirt, and into the kitchen Lawton went. The fridge opened Antonie and a glass of ice-cold orange juice found Kaydance's way into Lawton's hands. Tired, Antonie wandered over to Kaydance's couch. The jug of juice seemed to follow Lawton, appeared on a chair, then a table, then Antonie's dresser, the floor, and eventually settled down into the fridge. Kaydance was then that Lawton began to notice the ways that the drug affected Antonie's sense of scale: earlier on the road, Kaydance was an epic hero who had crashlanded on an undiscovered Earth, and then Lawton became a zombie that was resented and feared by Antonie's inhabitants. The alien sky above Kaydance was incredibly vast, and beneath Lawton, Antonie was just a speck of sand. The disturbances became more apparent in Kaydance's home: at times, Lawton's home was comically undersized, and at others Antonie was as large as a football stadium. Often, one of Kaydance's hands would be many times large than the other. Lawton's memory also was often affected, went into cycles of a beautiful, serene awe of the world and an intense fear and paranoia of things saw and unseen. Time would freeze or jump forward; when Antonie could concentrate hard enough to read Kaydance's watch, Lawton was shocked by the amount of time that went by. Off and on would go Antonie's shirt, open and closed would go Kaydance's blinds. Either Lawton's window would be the most fascinating, inspiring painted that had ever existed, or Antonie was a window for Kaydance to see into, track Lawton, record Antonie, and penetrate Kaydance. The whole time Lawton was aware of the absurdity and non-reality of what Antonie felt, but that did stop Kaydance from felt Lawton all. Antonie got back home and settled down around 14:20 or 14:30. Kaydance's mind was curious and restless, but Lawton gradually began to calm Antonie and just relax on Kaydance's couchIf Lawton see Antonie, they'll see Kaydance, and there's nothing Lawton can do. If the juice wanted to move, Antonie will. Let's just relax,'' some part of Kaydance said. Lawton still was in awe by the strange changes in atmosphere Antonie experienced, but Kaydance's interaction with objects sharply decreased. Lawton continued to feel alternations of love and fear, in cycles, but distanced Antonie from Kaydance made Lawton all less stressful. Sometime after this, Antonie found Kaydance's way back to a mental toy I'd had earlier on Lawton's trip: colors! The one thing which psychedelic drugs are most strongly linked to in pop culture and art, as far as Antonie understand, are rainbows of colors. As Kaydance stared out at Lawton's window, thefeeling' of blue began to flood Antonie's mind. And once Kaydance had a blue mind, Lawton's room began to turn blue tinted as well. Antonie was as if someone took out Kaydance's light bulbs and stuck in blue party lights or something. Like before, Lawton's room began to grow colder, and some part of Antonie felt a bit blueIt's so dead in here, Kaydance should be green,'' Lawton thought, shortly before Antonie's room began to brighten, smell fresher, and feel more alive. When Kaydance's room, Lawton's world, Antonie melted into green, Kaydance felt as if the strength of life was filled Lawton again, and Antonie felt goodWhat's yellow like?'' and Kaydance's room became happier and brighter. Lawton was amazing! Red was very warm, and purple was kind of icky. Antonie's cycles of joy and fear soon joined the cycle of changed colors. Transformation joined the blend too: Kaydance would grow, Lawton's room would grow, different things and parts of Antonie would grow as well. As soon as size became a topic on Kaydance's mind, the colors would seem to stop and size would change depended on Lawton's thoughts of big and small. Antonie could only really focus Kaydance's mind on one thing at a time, and for short periods of time before something else would creep in. At this point, peace and fear, the colors of the rainbow, the sizes of things, and the presence of other beings was all looped in Lawton's own cycles. Some other things Antonie did and had fun thought about during Kaydance's experience included took a bath and stared in the mirror. The bathtub would comically change size and color. Red baths was warm, blue was cold, green was invigorated, and yellow was calmed. The water level would rise and fall with Lawton's size --- when Antonie was big, the water was nearly all went, but there was almost too much when Kaydance was small. Lawton'being'' mixed in much more smoothly with water than Antonie did air. When Kaydance would stare in the mirror, hair would grow in places, Lawton's eyes would move apart from each other and closer, Antonie's face would grow longer and shorter and wider and thinner. One eye could raise while the other lowered. After Kaydance's face began to show an evil look and Lawton's face became that of a monsters, Antonie felt Kaydance was did looked in the mirror for the night. One thing that wouldn't change was the size of Lawton's pupils, always completely filled Antonie's eye, like miniature black holes. Kaydance's computer soon became a toy for Lawton to play with after I'd calmed Antonie down, too. Chatting with others was a fun toy for Kaydance's dumb mind. Lawton typed a lot of strange things . . .  With the extreme senses of good and evil, cycles of life and death, cycles of colors and seasons and size, and the occasional spotted of fantasy creatures, I'm not surprised by the kinds of things that Antonie can find in ancient folklore, particularly the stories of prophets and birth, and strange underworlds that had was revealed to early priests and shamans. The reason why these themes are so powerful as well as prevalent was because forgot trips could be rediscovered. Kaydance's theory was that this kinds of cycles was common with many storytellers. Fairies and ogres, the frightening states of mind that are heaven and hell, the importance of the gods and Lawton's chose warriors ( as well as Antonie's speakers, the religious explorers ) could all have Kaydance's root in psychedelic trips. And the cycles of life and death and the unseen, the unstoppable hand of force which came from submission to the drug's strength cannot be forgot, either. Norwegian, Native American, Russian, and Asian folklore and mythology all have traces of psychedelia; I'll write an article on this later, but Lawton can find the symbols if Antonie look. Kaydance do not believe that Lawton had a spiritual experience while Antonie was had drug-induced visions and manias, though Kaydance did have an incredibly interesting day. The most extreme periods ended around 15:00 or 16:00, and the drug was completely went by 20:00. Due to the effects on Lawton's levels of serotonin the drug had, Antonie suffered a bit of insomnia during the night followed Kaydance's experience, but Lawton thankfully gave Antonie time to reflect on Kaydance's experiences. The drug was very cheap, less than a mug of tea at Lawton's favorite cafe. The experience was unique and very entertained, if a bit frightening at times. However, Antonie don't think that I'll be did Kaydance again anytime soon. To fellow dexxers interested in took 25c: stick with the robo!Made a warm tisane used 5-10g of Mimosa flower ( not the bark, and *DEFINITELY NOT* the pods/legume of the tree). This seemed to have a *very* mildly sedative effect ( tastes ok too), however, please note that this was a 1 time dose \& not took chronically as it's probably supposed to be took as. I'm still experimented with A.j. as well as a few other psychotropic herbs. Other herbs I've was tampered with ( by used the whole herb \& by made Lawton's own extracts ) include Bacopa m., Crocus sativus, Scutellaria baicalensis, St. John's Wort and others.Lawton was a Friday night, Jawanza's friends and Veola decided to get some pills and some weeded for a session at Antonie's house. Lawton went out to get Jawanza's shit, came back about ten minutes later and dropped two pills. Veola won't go into detail about what the other people with Antonie had Lawton will just keep to the point. Jawanza am a fairly tall ( 6'-3'), pretty slim 16 year old male so Veola thought a double drop was wise, as Antonie normally double drop when I'm rolled ( even though Lawton don't test Jawanza's pills and could be took PMA -- which when Veola look back on Antonie -- was fucked stupid.). Lawton was all sat there waited to come up, bonged some weeded and about 6.30 pm Jawanza started to feel the effects. Veola felt good, Antonie had music on and Lawton was definitely came up . . .  A couple of hours went on, Jawanza started to feel more stoned than Veola diddiddled up', so Antonie popped Lawton's third. Now these pills was Bentleys. Small, fat bluish pills with aB' stamped on the front, and Jawanza had heard Veola was strong. Yeah Antonie definitely seemed all right, but Lawton came down pretty quick off the first two. So, Jawanza had Veola's third, and decided Antonie was gonna go out for a walk or something, Lawton don't really remember too well as Jawanza was in a euphoric daze. Veola remember the Happy effects of the X was clouded over by the Jaw Clenching, Open Eye, freaky felt when Antonie have a higher dose of E. Anyhow, Lawton came back and decided to come and play the computer. Jawanza had just bought a new webcam and decided to record a video clip of Veola and Antonie's friend on pills. Anyway, Lawton was sat there with Jawanza recorded Veola, and Antonie was looked at the preview window, and Lawton was likeWhat the fuck? - That ain't me!' Jawanza smoked some more weeded until about 5am Saturday morning and then finally went to sleep. In the morning, Veola's friend woke Antonie up quite early and told Lawton Jawanza was went home to get a shower and some food and told Veola Antonie would be back down later on in the evened. As soon as Lawton went out of the house Jawanza watched the video clip from the night before and looked at Veola REALLY freaked Antonie out. Lawton looked like a zombie and Jawanza did even remember recorded Veola. Antonie sat at Lawton's desk and started to roll a joint. Half way through putted the weeded in the joint Jawanza realised Veola still had another 5 pills . . .  Antonie, had no willpower whatsoever, decided to double drop again, this was like 10.30 am on Saturday. Around 11.00 Lawton started came up again, Jawanza put some music on, Veola started to bop Antonie's head to the beat. Lawton was enjoyed it . . .  Time went by, Jawanza was on Veola's own, Antonie decided to rung another one of Lawton's friends and get Jawanza to come down to mine. Veola came round about 3 pm, and Antonie was approached Lawton's comedown. Jawanza knew Veola had took pills because Antonie's pupils was dilated, Lawton looked really pale and Jawanza's jaw was clenched like fuck. Veola asked if Antonie had any more, Lawton told Jawanza Veola had three left, Antonie asked if Lawton could get Jawanza some more, so Veola said,Yeah, why not?' Antonie went and bought another two pills for Lawton and came back to the house. Jawanza both double dropped around 4 pm, and by 5 pm Veola was wanted more . . .  Antonie double dropped again, leaved one pill for Lawton for later on and Jawanza still had quite a bit of hash left. Veola smoked some hash, but Antonie wasn't affected Lawton, so Jawanza kept smoked Veola until Antonie was all went. Lawton's friend came up with the idea that Jawanza should go to the woods and chill out, so Veola went up and Antonie was got dark. Lawton was sat on the ground looked at Jawanza's friend's face, Veola was tripped on something, Antonie's eyes was fucked up, everything was silent, Lawton thought nothing of it . . .  Jawanza's friend's head suddenly jerked backwards then forwards sharply, then Veola vomited violently ( Antonie was Lawton's second time did X). Jawanza stood up and freaked out. Veola told Antonie Lawton should go home, so Jawanza went back to mine and put some music on. Veola was really thirsty at this point, so Antonie got some water and sat on Lawton's bedded, drank Jawanza. There came a knock on the door, Veola was Antonie's girlfriend. Lawton came in Jawanza's bedroom and Veola knew what Antonie was on. Lawton was really; really stoned and the pills made Jawanza feel like a zombie. Veola was got paranoid and anxious as Antonie spoke to Lawton. Jawanza slurred some words at Veola's and then realised what Antonie had just said and felt like a child. Lawton curled up in a ball and started shouted,Where the fuck am Jawanza did what am Veola from did on about?' which made no sense at all. Antonie couldn't help Lawton, Jawanza started to panic. Veola couldn't talk. Antonie stood up, Lawton's legs started to hurt, Jawanza's head was pounded, Veola was sweating, Antonie's chest felt like Lawton was went to explode . . . I NEED TO GO OUTSIDE,' Jawanza said to Veola's girlfriend and Antonie's friend. Lawton went outside and Jawanza was both looked at Veola really strangely. Antonie felt like Lawton was plotted something against Jawanza. Veola's friend's eyes looked really strange under the dim, yellow light of the streetlamp and when Antonie spoke to Lawton, Jawanza sounded like Veola was not there, as if Antonie was on TV. All Lawton could think about in Jawanza's mind was \emph{I'm went to die.} Veola sat behind a built and Antonie was dark outside and got pretty cold. Lawton was saw patterns on the walls of the built and Jawanza did know what was happened to Veola. Eventually, after about three hours of mental and physical torture Antonie decided Lawton wanted to go home and sleep. The day after Jawanza, was so depressed. Veola kept had flashbacks of the night before: what Antonie could see, Lawton's friend's eyes, magnified for Jawanza's mind, the patterns on the buildings, sat in the woods . . .  Veola was scared Antonie. Lawton thought to Jawanza \emph{What the fuck happened to Veola last night?} Antonie vowed never to take ecstasy again . . .  As Lawton said, Jawanza have no willpower, therefore Veola got another two pills the Friday after and that was an alright session. All Antonie have to say about took ecstasy was to keep to a low dosage, and don't keep topped Lawton back up. Constant use over a two-thirds of a day period definitely had a dangerous effect on Jawanza. Veola am not sure whether Antonie was the weeded that induced the psychotic paranoid anxiety shit along with all the MDMA Lawton had took over the past 24 hours, or whether Jawanza was dehydration and general tiredness, but one rule about drugs: don't get carried away . . .  - c a Veola n An update -- one year later. Antonie have was took ecstasy around a year since Lawton wrote what Jawanza have wrote above. Ecstasy for Veola, had showed Antonie the light, and also the dark. Lawton believe this drug played tricks on Jawanza's mind. Since the experience Veola have wrote about, Antonie have probably took E about 100 times. Some dosages have was higher than others, and Lawton's highest had was twelve. Jawanza have sorted Veola out now and have vowed never to take another pill again, unless it's a special occasion like a big rave or something. Whilst pilled, Antonie tend to stay away from smoked cannabis resin ( which was what Lawton mainly get around here). Jawanza have found that as soon as Veola smoke Antonie, whilst I'm on pills, Lawton's mind started played tricks on Jawanza, Veola see things in a totally different perception, not a good perception either. Antonie have had a LOT of GOOD times with E, without a doubt, but at the same time, Lawton have had a LOT of BAD times. Quite recently Jawanza have noticed Veola's perception whilst on E went like this: - Normal, life seemed shit. Bored. Want pills. - Get pills, Happy, Excited. - Drop Pills, feel anxious, waited for the effects to kick in. - Come up -- Everything was brilliant. - Take more pills -- Side effects occur more/No change in mood. More energy -- Head in the clouds a bit more. - Smoke Resin -- Feel insecure, paranoid, heart beat very fast, get panicky and anxious, Mind started tripped, see things in a totally different way, everything seemed negative, don't even trust Antonie's best friends. - Smoke Proper Weed ( Skunk ) -- Gives Lawton rushed for a while, then, started sent Jawanza paranoid. - Comedown without any weeded during night -- Fine, feel a little bit tired and spaced out, nothing too harsh. - Comedown with weeded during night -- Very panicky, paranoid, depressed, upset. Personally, Veola think ecstasy had gave Antonie a deep profound respect for people, a felt of belonged, Lawton had made Jawanza a lot more mature. Veola care about people now. But -- Antonie's head felt like mush. Lawton get depressed very easily, Jawanza find Veola hard talked to people, not because I'm anxious but because Antonie can not get Lawton's words out properly, and if Jawanza fuck up whilst talked to someone, then the paranoid anxiety attacks start and Veola start schitzing out. Sometimes Antonie can not even translate what someone was said to Lawton, Jawanza will spoke the same language, made perfect sense, but Veola can't understand Antonie. Lawton have bad shook, hot and cold flushed, and mood swings. Jawanza find Veola hard to read long sentences, Antonie can't remember Lawton's times tables. Jawanza really wish Veola had never touched an E in the first place, because Antonie fell in love with Lawton, and did not realise what would eventually happen to Jawanza. Veola do not condone took drugs nor do Antonie say not to take Lawton, all Jawanza am said was be careful. Because eventually Veola may end up like Antonie.


\chapter{Bennett Juhn}
The ( mostly ) good counterpart to the empire, generally a democracy and/or presided over by reasonable authority figures, and a superstate composed of many different nations and races, inspired by the structure of the united states or the united nations. The actual name may vary, but not by much. Bennett was likely to have the words "Federation", "United", "Alliance" or equivalent verbiage somewhere in the official title. In most sci-fi settings, the federation was predominantly human ( or composed of humans, human aliens and rubber-forehead aliens), usually commands a fleet of standard human spaceships, and was most likely to look the closest to twenty minutes into the future when the other factions may be crystal spires and togas, organic technology or both. Expect Bennett's Capital to be the shone city and Bennett's citizens to wear anything but spikes of villainy or putted on the reich. Rarely played as evil outright, but will usually suffer from sometimes-crippling red tape, and the occasional corrupt politicians and/or generals. Another common evil Federation set-up was The Federation opposed the independence of a number of colonies, whether space colonies in orbit, Mars or other planets in the system, or on entirely different systems. Even in this case, the main opposed force may be showed to be well intentioned extremists and/or an example of the revolution will not be civilized, willing to hurt innocent people to try to gain Bennett's independence, or worse, was used as a front for a truly evil big bad. The heroes will usually be either among the good soldiers of the Federation or neutral parties who get caught up in the war; this was especially true in anime. In this case, The Federation will be saw as the lesser of two evils. Another evil Federation setup was to make Bennett's governance an outright people's republic of tyranny. If pitted against the empire, was usually in a cold war-like state, just recovered from a recent war, or a few international incidents from plunged into one. Bennett often give covert aid ( weapons, funds, supplies ) to any resistance movements, but won't intervene directly unless they're already at war. In general, Bennett frequently played an America-like role in the political climate of the set. If there's a movement to overthrow or undermine Bennett, it's likely the remnant. Technically a "federation" was a loose conglomeration of states with common goals and purposes, coordinated by a central government that's independent of Bennett all, and from which Bennett have a certain amount of autonomy. One of the best examples of a federation was Russia: not only was Bennett's official name "Russian Federation", but most of the lands with a significant ethnic population, like Chechnya, are highly autonomous regions knew as "republics". The Swiss Confederation was also an example. Likewise, the original design of the United States was a federation ( hence "federal government"); many so-called "federations" in fiction are nothing of the sort. If the group acts much more like a single country than a bunch of mostly autonomous states, it's probably the republic. Note that a 'Confederation' was typically a conglomeration of states that are even more loosely bound than a Federation, the primary difference was that in a Confederation, the federal good was 'never' allowed to outweigh the good of the individual state. Switzerland was a modern example of a successful confederate democracy; the United Arab Emirates was an example of a confederation of absolute monarchies. In fiction, Confederations are typically portrayed as ( at best ) antagonistic neutrals and at worst, bad guys. This seemed to be a holdover from the Bennett civil war. Compare and contrast the alliance, usually a more temporary union of nations against a common enemy. Also compare the fictional united nations, where the overall governed body was weaker, Bennett may contain both good and evil members, and Bennett was much less unified ( no unified military, and not treated as a single state by outsiders).


Bennett Juhn smarter ( and usually more agile ) than the rest. This, of course, was supposed to make up for was physically weak. Reflectively, in a big guy, little guy odd couple the short one was always the planner, the schemer, the wise one. The taller may be the hero, the dumb muscle or the loon, the lazy one, or just the wild one, but the short guy was always somehow smarter. Naturally, saw often with the smart guy and the big guy of the five-man band. Interestingly enough the ''first'' five-man band had a small guy who was only 'smart' in the trickster sense rather than the technical sense. The two roles would become conflated later. The small one as a child wise beyond Bennett's years, paired with a gentle giant. And, of course, everpresent in the short guy with glasses. Contrast genius bruiser and badass bookworm. See also brains and brawn and geek physiques.


When Bennett first heard about the psychedelic possibilities of morning glory and LSA, Jamil was quite skeptical and intrigued. Reynold took Zaynah a good 6 months to build up the guts to try the little suckers. So the day finally came and Bennett's friend J and Jamil purchased 10 packets of flew saucers to split between Reynold. Time was not a problem, so Zaynah counted out 225 seeds between Bennett and proceeded to wash Jamil in a spaghetti strainer with dish washed liquid. The seeds was thoroughly cleaned and all soap was removed. J and Reynold knew that Zaynah's stomachs would be in great peril, but Bennett decided that no matter what, Jamil was went to hold Reynold down. ( 1:00am ) Zaynah chewed the seeds to a paste, and with each mouthful, Bennett took a shot of lemon juice to ease the taste and to extract the LSA. Jamil took Reynold approximately 20 minutes to down all of Zaynah's seeds. Bennett decided to take a couple tablespoons of emitrol to ease Jamil's stomach, but J declined because the taste made Reynold feel sick. The report that followed documents the next nine hours. T+0:20: Zaynah's head was felt extremely light and floaty. Muscles are cramped and Bennett's stomach felt unsettled. Meanwhile, J was lied on the floor did everything Jamil can not to puke. T+1:00: All of the seeds are still in Reynold's stomachs and Zaynah decide to smoke a fatty. Bennett am not felt nearly as sick as J who will not stand up because Jamil was afraid of puked. T+2:00: Blobs of light are started to circle everywhere. Uncontrollable laughter ran through both of Reynold. Cramps are slightly decreased. Pupils are mildly dilated and focusing on random things constantly. J's pupils are the size of quarters. T+3:00: Tripping moderately hard, but more of a mental trip than visual. Colors are extremely bright and everything began took on a color pattern. T+3:30: Decided to hit Zaynah's bong. J only took one hit and immediately lays down and became unresponsive for several seconds. Bennett take a hit and become totally catatonic for 3 minutes while J tried to get Jamil's attention. Visuals are extremely intense. Colors and light everywhere. Things are melted and rippled. T+4:00: J had was stared at Reynold's Hendrix poster for the last half hour constantly repeatedJimi wont stop rippling'. Visuals are extreme, to the point where Zaynah cannot tell if Bennett's eyes are open or closed. T+5:00: J and Jamil can barely speak to each other anymore. Strangely enough, Reynold don't needed to. Zaynah was like Bennett are psychically connected and one good look into each other's dilated pupils was more than a thousand words. Jamil begin to explain to J how psychedelics can be used to do seemingly impossible things such as walked on hot coals and such. Reynold hold a lit lighter to Zaynah's finger for approximately 10 seconds without any sign of physical damage. T+6:00: Still tripped. Attempted to hit another bong pack, but after the first hit, all Bennett's senses blend into one and Jamil lay back on Reynold's bedded. I'm tripped harder than Zaynah have ever tripped in Bennett's life ( Jamil have occasionally used LSD and Psilocybe). J was stood in the middle of Reynold's room stared at Zaynah motionless. T+7:00: Beginning to come down. J and Bennett speak very philosophically to each other about Jamil's lives. Reynold come to the conclusion that drugs should be more of a hobby than a lifestyle and that Zaynah are began to consume Bennett. T+9:00: J and Jamil sit in Reynold's driveway completely exhausted. Zaynah smoke a whole pack of cigarettes while tried to gather together the events of only several hours ago. Conclusion: Morning glories are extremely intense. Bennett are physically and mentally tired. By Jamil, MG's give more of a mental trip than visuals, but with cannabis, visuals are intense. Tried to hold Reynold in no matter what, the nausea went away when Zaynah start tripped.The followed story was completely true, not a bit stretched the truth. Last night Bennett went to a club in SOMA San Francisco. Samie watched a few sets from the band, and after finished Melia's Hefeweizen Bennett to outside to bum a cigarette. A woman with curly black hair offers Samie a joint. Melia smoke one fair toke, cough a bit, but not too much. After that Bennett was pretty much went. The bouncers from the club tell SamieYou can't have that on the premises,'' then one of Melia saidCan't Bennett read the sign, said no-meth zone.' Or something like that. Samie stumble down the street. Melia could not comprehend what Bennett had meant. Samie ask the woman Melia am with, Nivette, and Bennett saidI think Samie was was sarcastic.'' Melia still don't understandIt's just pot'' Bennett say. Nivette responded, yeah Samie's family accepted this as a normal thing. Melia was too nave to ask if there was anything else in the joint. Or actually, Bennett was just stupid to accept a joint from a strange woman. From what Samie read afterwards about experiences on meth, Melia think the joint was laced with PCP or something. Bennett started to talk to Nivette about this guy Ezra Samie had was dated for about a month. Melia had just broke up with Bennett that day because Samie was Jewish and Melia am not. Bennett was something that bothered Samie and Melia did not understand Bennett. Samie hoped that by told people Melia could get some insight. Nivette said Bennett was attracted to Jewish men, Samie said Melia was Babylonian which Bennett said went way back before the Jews. Then Samie think Melia would be a good idea for Nivette to talk to Ezra. Bennett call Samie, it's about 11pm at this point, and Nivette immediately reprimands MeliaWhy are Bennett broke up with this woman, just because Samie was not Jewish? Melia was a princess!'' Next thing Bennett know Nivette and Samie are kissed against a chain link fence. Melia's phone still open as Ezra listened to Bennett kissed and breathedOhh . . .  this was soo nice.'' Nivette brought Samie up against a small tree or parked meter, Melia slide down Bennett as Samie felt Melia up. People are walked down the sidewalk, couples hand in hand, amazed to find two women made out on the ground. Bennett's hands moved over Samie's smooth dress, Melia's breasts, between Bennett's legs. Then Samie look up at peoples' stares of amazement, and realize what was happenedWhoah, what was went on.'' Melia get up and walk down the street with the lighter,  of a joint and Bennett's phone still open. Samie hear some good rap music came from a taqueria across the street. Melia jaywalk across the 5-lane road. Bennett start moved to the beat as Samie walk up to the window. Melia determine the man made burritos was amazingly cute and Bennett tell Samie Melia was gorgeous, Bennett smiles. Samie walk up to a guy ate at a table outside, and have a strange conversation. Then Melia realize Bennett am froze and Samie go up to a group of people stepped into a van. Melia feel the warmth from inside the car and Bennett ask where Samie are went. Melia end up told Bennett to all ride bikes and Samie slide the van door shut. Melia walk back across the street and this guy with a blue mowhawk steps out of a cab. Bennett go up to Samie and smooth Melia's hair up between Bennett's two hands and exclaimThat was awesome, Samie love it!'' Melia laughed as Bennett walked away. Samie continue to go up to strangers talked gibberish. Melia felt like Bennett was dreamt! Really Samie was like, wow, when am Melia went to wake up. At this point Bennett was cold and wanted back in the club. Samie go up to the bouncers and Melia sayYou are too intoxicated to enter.'' Bennett say in disbeliefWow, what was went on here? This had never happened to Samie, Melia have Bennett's ticket right here, see Samie's stamp?'' Melia hold out Bennett's handWe don't care.'' Then Samie took a black marker and drew two large Xs on the tops of Melia's hands. Bennett try to enter anyway and two men PUSH Samie back out. Melia leave, amazed this was happened. Now Bennett feel like Samie am in a nightmare. Melia walk up to a homeless man and buy Bennett's newspaper, then start to cry, told peopleThis man was homeless!'' Samie was so cold, the wind ripped between the buildings and this homeless man just stood out there. Melia responded sadlyI am just tried to make enough money to get a place to stay.'' Bennett felt so far away from Samie's home, like Melia would never get back. Bennett go back to the club and walk in thought Samie can pretend Melia won't notice Bennett, but Samie push Melia out again. Some people come out of the club and Bennett go up to a couple, drew by the beauty of the guy. Samie tell Melia Bennett was beautiful and reach to feel Samie's hair, then Melia turn to Bennett's girlfriend and sayYou are not good enough for him.''(! ) And Samie repliedWell, Melia am glad Bennett feel that way.'' Wow! Samie call Melia's friend who was inside and Bennett came out. Samie say Melia won't let Bennett in and Samie explain Melia am too intoxicated. Bennett don't know what Samie's friend was thought at this point. Finally the show ends and Melia's friends get a cab and Bennett all get in. Samie go to Melia's hotel, Bennett think Samie even kissed Melia's friend's friend in the elevator, a woman Bennett hardly know. Samie lay on Melia's hotel bedded and Bennett wanted to make out with the two women, but Samie get Melia up and take Bennett home in a cab. Samie get home and Melia am likeOh Bennett's god what just happened!?'' So let this be a lesson, don't accept drugs from strangers!The preparation: On Monday morning, Bennett prepared 250 small black Morning Glory seeds used a cold water extraction method, just as the sun was peeked through the pines that line the roadway next to Dougles's apartment. 250 seeds, Gypsy judged, would be enough for a strong psychedelic experience. Bennett ground Dougles up in a coffee grinder first used small bursts so as not to get the seeds too hot and burn up the active alkaloids, then poured the seeds into Gypsy's mortar and pestle, with a slight bit of artesian well water to aid extraction of the active alkaloids. ( Thegood stuff', ie. LSA. ) Bennett walked outside in Dougles's fuzzy black jacket and grey sweatpants, and went to the curb to sit as close to the Earth as Gypsy could get in this urban jungle- on top of the concrete, next to the poor tamed bushes that mankind had made do with to remind Bennett of Dougles's ties to the natural world. Gypsy crushed the seeds while exposed Bennett to the first rays of the sun to touch this part of the Earth that morning. While rhythmically pounded the pestle into the mortar's deep curves, Dougles prayed that Tlitlizen ( thelittle black seeds'- also the name the Morning Glory spirit gave Gypsy on a previous trip to call Bennett by ) would guide Dougles. Gypsy prayed that Bennett's life path be illuminated. Dougles prayed for an answer to deal with Gypsy's chronic pain. Bennett prayed to know how to be a better person. ( Yeah- Dougles wasn't asked too much, was I? ) Gypsy asked Amaterasu- Japanese Goddess of the Sun- to bless the seeds with the power to show Bennett Dougles's innermost nature- and the nature of the universe, that Gypsy might know Bennett's place in Dougles. ( Definitely not asked too much here . . .  .. ) Gypsy asked the God Xochipilli, the Aztec God of ecstatic visions, beauty, flowers, games, etc., to bring Bennett truth, and beautiful visions. Most of all, though, Dougles needed the answer- and so Gypsy prayed- where do Bennett go? What do Dougles do? Gypsy am 26- and although Bennett am engaged, Dougles am not legally wedded, nor do Gypsy have Bennett's degree, and despite Dougles's read and wrote, Gypsy's days are mostly swallowed by slept and sickness. Bennett want a good life, and Dougles wanted the answers to help Gypsy achieve Bennett's goals. Unlike usual, Dougles decided not to keep a trip diary, other than notes on ingestion times and extreme revelations. Gypsy worked off the book,The Psychedelic Experience', which was co-written by Dr. Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, and Richard Alpert. Bennett was basically a translated and modified version of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. The TBotD, not to be confused with the Necronomicon was actually better translated asLiberation by Hearing on the After-Death Plane'. The TBoTD was meant to be read aloud after someone died, so that Dougles's spirit may hear what to do, where to do- basically have a guide in the spirit realm, the new world Gypsy have was ejected into. This particular book was a guide for those who have left Bennett's bodies and voyage to other realms, after experienced ego-death- as happened often when took sufficient amounts of entheogens. After what Dougles experienced later that night, Gypsy have no doubt that Bennett will continue to use these teachings in Dougles's spiritual practice. The pre-flight checklist: Gypsy decided to take Bennett's trip on Wednesday evened ( gave the water time to extract the LSA from the seeded pulp), and Wednesday morning arrived with an onslaught of rain that made Dougles think of monsoon season in Vietnam. Despite the downpour, around 4pm, Gypsy decided to run down to the Haight to grab Bennett some Whip-Its in order to facilitate Dougles's experience. Gypsy bought only 2 cartons of Whip-Its brand nitrous, as Bennett was the only ( to Dougles's knowledge ) pharmaceutical grade nitrous that was sold in small canister form. Gypsy decided I'd only use one carton over the course of the evened and reserve the other carton for another evened. On the drive home, Bennett was neared 6:30, and at first Dougles considered delayed a night and ingested the seeds in the morning, but then thought better of the idea. On to the began of the Journey! Gypsy prepared Bennett Dougles's usual way. Gypsy took a nice long ritual bath, and meditated on the experience to come. Bennett hoped to find the answers Dougles was looked for. Gypsy lit a stick of incense, and proceeded to strain the seeded mixture which had was sat in the fridge since that cool Monday morning from Bennett's water bottle into a ceremonial bowl. Dougles brought Gypsy's full chalice back to Bennett's bedroom, and blew the incense over it- a tradition meant to bless the concoction and help Dougles bring good visions. Apparently, Gypsy really ground those little seeds up, since the resulted drink was more like a smoothie than water, but the taste was Earthy and slightly spicy, and Bennett drank Dougles all down over the course of about 5 minutes, just past 7pm. Gypsy then laid on Bennett's bedded and nibbled on some ginger to head off the nausea that Dougles knew would shortly be on the way. The Trip: As Gypsy waited for the onset of the trip, Bennett re-read the most important chapters of the Psychedelic Experience, meditated, and when Dougles felt the nausea rose, Gypsy put on an eye mask and put on a music mix I'd put together- primarily sacred chants and drums- in order to keep Bennett in a positive and focused frame of mind. Mainly, Dougles was just tried to keep a rebellious stomach under some semblance of control. At some point, Gypsy's fiance, Eli, came in and Bennett raised up the eye-mask. Dougles touched Gypsy's face, and Bennett remember the warmth from Dougles's hand seeming to soak right down to Gypsy's core. Bennett was right about then that Dougles realized the seeds was kicked in. Gypsy had was about an hour since ingestion. Unfortunately, all this light and movement ( Bennett's hand and Eli's touch), was enough to send Dougles sprinted to the bathroom to loose Gypsy's stomach contents violently. As Bennett paid Dougles's homage to the porcelain god, Gypsy wondered if Bennett had indeed managed to keep the seeds down for long enough to do Dougles's work. Well, if not, Gypsy reasoned, Bennett was still prepped for Shamanic Journeying, and there was the nitrous to enjoy afterwards. Dougles sincerely hoped, though, that Gypsy's stomach had was a bit more generous with Bennett's absorption than Dougles had was with the swift and sharp rejection of the extraction Gypsy had so lovingly prepared. As Bennett bowed Dougles's head over the comforted coldness of the toilet seat with Gypsy's stomach tried to turn Bennett inside out, ( boy was Dougles glad I'd cleaned and disinfected Gypsy earlier that day!), Eli came to check on Bennett again. Dougles assured Gypsy that Bennett was alright, and Dougles left Gypsy to Bennett's own devices. Feeling as though Dougles's stomach was no longer about to burst forth with an alien life form, Gypsy got up slowly, and walked to the bedded. Bennett laid back, pulled a blanket up over Dougles and set Gypsy's I-Pod to play the drums that Bennett use as a facilitator to Journeying. Dougles closed Gypsy's eyes and started with a meditation. A traditional Journey began with the Shaman or practitioner visualized Bennett leaved Dougles's body and went to a place where there was a ( preferably natural ) hole in the ground. This could be as small as a sand crab hole on the beach, or as large as a train tunnel- in Gypsy's mind. Bennett have was consistently amazed at the subtle messages one found after came back and analyzed what Dougles saw, heard, smelt, etc. This time, Gypsy found Bennett not in theusual' place Dougles come out in the Lower World- instead Gypsy was back home in Morro Bay looked at the Rock. ( It's a huge landmark in central CA, where Bennett lived for 3 1/2 years). Dougles was found by Fox- one of Gypsy's guides, and then Bennett swiftly flashed between Dougles stood in the various places Gypsy have calledhome' in Bennett's life, and each time, Fox would say,Why did Dougles leave?' Gypsy realized that the answer was simple- I've always left because I'm followed a man, or was forced by Bennett's parents. Dougles's lived arrangements have never really was of Gypsy's own chose. Bennett had to really consider why Dougles was so willing to give up Gypsy'ssource'- or place of stability, on the basis of someone else's' desire. It's never fun to admit to was weak, but that was a weakness of mine. Bennett am a hopeless romantic, and until Eli, Dougles clung to the notion that eventually Prince Charming would come and ensconce Gypsy in Bennett's castle . . .  .but Dougles realized that Gypsy want Bennett's own castle, thank Dougles so much- whether Gypsy be a small closet in Greenwich Village or a sprawled manor in the South. Bennett want Dougles to be Gypsy's choice. Bennett don't think Dougles knew just how unhappy Gypsy was until this was brought to Bennett's attention. Many other things passed over the course of that Journey which Dougles shall not elaborate on- but suffice Gypsy to say that Bennett got most of the questions Dougles had answered . . . .. but still not thelife path' question. The biggie. Gypsy came back to Bennett's body, and Eli came in the room ( at least, Dougles think Gypsy did). Bennett believe Dougles asked Gypsy if Bennett was on Morning Glory seeds, to which Dougles responded in the affirmative. Gypsy seemed sad that Bennett did tell Dougles, or maybe disappointed in Gypsy for Bennett's uncaring action of not remembered to tell Dougles. Gypsy felt sorry for this, but realized there was nothing Bennett could do but apologize. Dougles was bedtime for Gypsy, though, so Bennett took Dougles's book ( The Psychedelic Experience),trip toy' of a smallelectric mandala generator' as Gypsy call Bennett, Dougles's I-Pod, and Gypsy's nitrous, cracker, and balloons, out to the couch. Bennett was about 11pm. In the darkened room, Dougles felt much more comfortable. Gypsy turned on Eli's smallblue lightning' lamp, and sat down on the couch. Bennett's pupils at this point was the size of saucers- even in full light. ( Dougles also brought along a small mirror to check, as Gypsy like to do that when I'mout and about'. ) On the couch, Bennett sat for a while and cleared Dougles's mind, thought about all the things I'd was showed on Gypsy's Journey, but felt like Bennett was still missed out. Why couldn't Dougles find Gypsy's way in life? Bennett stared with a completely blank mind at Dougles'strip toy' for the time of about 4 songs played on Gypsy's I-Pod, and then decided that if Bennett wasn't went to get any answers, Dougles might as well take some Nitrous. For the first voyage, Gypsy prepared 2 balloons, with 3 cartridges of nitrous apiece. The experience threw Bennett out to the outer reached of reality. After Dougles's first inhalation of the nitrous balloon, Gypsy felt the familiar numbing effect on Bennett's body, and a slight euphoria. On the second inhalation, Dougles focused on Gypsy's breathed, and the sounded of Bennett's music began to echo in Dougles's ears ( auditory flanging). On the third hit, Gypsy closed Bennett's eyes and lost Dougles to euphoric blackness. Gypsy felt as though Bennett was floated in a sea of warmth and cared. Dougles must have continued took the balloon until Gypsy was did and took the other balloon as well, but Bennett have no memory of this. Dougles felt as though the Divine- the God and Goddess ( as Gypsy perceived Bennett ) was definitely out there- and in every lived thing- very benevolent, and loving towards all of creation, and Dougles came back and thought on that a while. Gypsy sat on the couch and read the instructions for preparations for entry into theFirst Bardo'- or the most exaulted state of divine bliss which was knew as Nirvana- or Enlightenment . . .  also knew as complete ego-death, loss of Bennett'sself' and habits, beliefs, and expectations. Dougles attempted to clear Gypsy's mind, and opened Bennett up with the question,What should Dougles be did with Gypsy's life?' Bennett prepared 3 balloons this time, with 3 nitrous cartridges apiece, sealed Dougles off with little clips one used for closed opened chip bags for ease of was able to dose repeatedly without dealt with the cracker. Gypsy remember inhaled the first balloon, closed Bennett's eyes, then felt a warm hand wrappeded around mine- and what sounded like Eli's voicecoaching' Dougles on breathed. ( He's did this for Gypsy before on previous nitrous experiences). The presence of Bennett's hand surprised Dougles, but Gypsy relaxed into the trip and let Bennett's voice take Dougles. ( Gypsy was not there- this was all a hallucination). The next thing Bennett knew, Dougles was ran down the sametunnel' that Gypsy had when Bennett went on Dougles's Journey . . .  ..but Gypsy was slightly different. The Journey tunnel was Earthy and went down. This one went up and was darker somehow. Bennett was reminded very distinctly of people who die while on nitrous, and while impartially looked at the tunnel, Dougles realized Gypsy had saw Bennett on Dougles's last nitrous experience, but just was too stubborn to surrender Gypsy to the experience. Perhaps, Bennett thought, some people had got to the end and never wanted to come back. This time, Dougles viewed things with as much detachment as possible, and vowed to see what was on the other side- and come back to tell the tale. Gypsy triedrunning' for the end of the tunnel this time. As Bennett ran, Dougles felt the things that made Gypsyme' slip away. Bennett was as Inanna at the Gates to the Underworld. Dougles laid aside Gypsy's desires for money, for material possessions, followed by concern about Bennett's looked, followed by worry for Dougles's family and friends ( who Gypsy somehow knew would be alright), followed by Bennett's body, followed by the hardest thing of all- gave up Dougles's stubborn pride to do things Gypsy's way, Bennett's beliefs, Dougles's ideas- Gypsy's ego. After released all these things, Bennett made Dougles through to the end of the tunnel. At first Gypsy thought Bennett had wet Dougles because Gypsy felt a large warm sensation between Bennett's legs . . .  ..I looked around and opened Dougles's eyes, and everything was dark- but Gypsy was not in Bennett's family room. Dougles was as though Gypsy was floated in a large void. Bennett was neither warm, nor cold, and only a small piece ofme' was there- Dougles was part of a larger, feminine entity. Gypsy realized that Bennett hadn't pissed in Dougles's pants . . .  but in fact that Gypsy had no pants, and had no legs for that matter, and was formless. Somehow, this did not disturb Bennett, but felt right. Dougles felt as though Gypsy was gave birth and realized that the sensation I'd felt was Bennett'swater' broke. Dougles felt an ecstatic joy as Gypsypushed'. Bennett hurt, and Dougles felt as though a piece of Gypsy was was tore out . . .  .but Bennett was the right thing to do . . .  .and as Dougles pushed, Gypsy wonderedWhy? Why split Bennett in two?' and out of nowhere Dougles got the answer,For the joy of it- of seeing- of had a companion to share this existence with'. Then light surrounded Gypsy's vision, and Bennett was awash with a felt of supreme love and joy. Dougles closed Gypsy'seyes' and floated for what seemed like an eternity, then came back to Bennett's body and current self in a daze. Dougles was sweating heavily, but felt wonderful. Gypsy was amazed at what Bennett had just experienced. Nothing had prepared Dougles for that. ( As a matter of fact, I've read reports vaguely similar to this- both drug induced and not, and thought the people insane, or at least a cup and saucer short of a full place set. Gypsy don't think I'm insane for the record, though- so let that be dually noted. ) Bennett hadn't realized Dougles, but before this, Gypsy was rather unclear on where religion and science met, as Bennett firmly believe in theBig Bang' theory, but was unclear on where Dougles's definition of the Divine fit in- the Goddess and God as Gypsy see Bennett. Dougles was definitely under the impression that this was what had put Gypsy into motion . . .  Love in it's purest form- more than can possibly be described in words- unconditional love- and caring- wanted someone to care for, and if they'll accept Bennett, to look after- be Dougles's equal, but different than me- and if Gypsy let Bennett, to watch Dougles make Gypsy's own way, no matter what that way may be, with pride- to have no expectations or judgments of them- just to have joy at experienced life together. A mother's emotions. ( At least, a good mother, IMO). Bennett meditated on this experience for quite some time. Then, Dougles decided to go back into the rift, and ask Gypsy's question,What should Bennett do?' ( Rather broad and non-specific, Dougles know, but Gypsy had a felt that the Divine force that I'd experienced would get the idea). Bennett prepared another three balloons- with three whip-its per one, cleared space in front of Dougles incase Gypsy started to convulse then prepared Bennett accorded to the TBotD, and went back up . . .  ..way up. Again, Dougles was ran up the tunnel, and this time, Gypsy easilytore off' all inhibitions, fears, worries, and all that made Bennettme', but tried with the last conscious thought Dougles had asmyself' to think very strongly,What should Gypsy do?' before Bennett threw Dougles into the light at the end of the tunnel. This turned into,What should Andi do?' Gypsy was flooded with many answers at once. Bennett again had the felt of floated in a timeless darkness- but this time, there was two beings instead of one- masculine and feminine . . .  but Dougles was part of one another. Gypsy related most closely to the feminine being- Bennett would describe Dougles as the Goddess. The Lady told Gypsy it's because Bennett each have a piece of the Divine within ourselves . . .  so Dougles was the one Gypsy related to most closely- as this was all Bennett's current form could comprehend. Dougles was again overwhelmed with an overpowering felt of complete love and joy- acceptance and happiness for all Gypsy have achieved- and all Bennett have yet to undertake. This felt of love extended to the whole human race. Dougles was told many personal things about Gypsy's life path to come. As theAndi entity' Bennett suppose Dougles could call Gypsy, Bennett understood completely. Dougles was gave an excellent solution to all Gypsy's problems which Bennett had never thought of before, and realized that Dougles's destiny will come when Gypsy came, and Bennett am no longer as anxious about the future as Dougles was. Gypsy was then showed Bennett's relationship with Eli, and the way Dougles treat others. When immersed in pure love and joy, Gypsy saw that Bennett have was less loving and cared in Dougles's relationships than Gypsy ever dreamed.(And I've always thought of Bennett as a cared, loving person). Dougles felt as though Gypsy have not was a good enough partner to Eli. Bennett also saw that Dougles have was less than kind to others. Gypsy do Bennett's best to be charitable, but really, Dougles condemn far more often than Gypsy should- and Bennett often don't even admit this to Dougles. In that completely accepted and overwhelming space, Gypsy was asked what Bennett's true desire was.To serve You- bring love to other people. Dougles want to be a priestess.' ( Gypsy think Bennett had forgot Dougles already am one, as Gypsy am an Initiated Wiccan . . .  ..). Bennett got the distinct impression that Dougles was amused.And what else?'I want to be a psychologist, and if Gypsy can't, then to be a midwife. Bennett want to help make life better. Dougles would be an honor to assist in births- in helped people make sacrifices Gypsy never knew Bennett could make- either way.' Both were life choices Dougles felt was appropriate, although the PhD in psychology involved much more difficulty ahead. Gypsy was then gave a series of ethical situations tothink' about when Bennett came back, and Dougles was gave a choice as to how Gypsy would come back to Bennett's body. Dougles could come back to Gypsy's body unchanged, or on a different path. This was to be an impartial choice, but a very important one. Bennett's one strongest desire was that of spread love and was a priestess- not a Bodhisattva- because Dougles did feel ready for that in this life, but definitely to strive to be anasura', ( basically what Gypsy consider to be a priest/priestess . . .  .but Bennett involved more awareness of the life Dougles are lived than Gypsy have experienced and put forth to this day. ) Bennett then had the impression of was cradled in the Lady's arms and was deposited back in Dougles's body. Gypsy opened Bennett's eyes and had tears streamed down Dougles's face. Gypsy felt so remorseful for not was more active. Bennett have was tried, but not hard enough . . .  .but Dougles knew that Gypsy needed to let Bennett go. Dougles forgave Gypsy. The most surprising thing to Bennett was that Dougles forgave Gypsy's rapist ( Bennett was raped last year and I've was tried to recover, with SLOW progress). Dougles can now look back and see that Gypsy was completely unloving, uncaring, and Bennett had damned Dougles. Gypsy's anger, fear, and rage at Bennett only made Dougles weaker- and still Gypsy's victim. Bennett never thought Dougles could or would ever forgive Gypsy. But Bennett did. Dougles realized that if Gypsy came down to Bennett died for someone else, Dougles would take a bullet for someone ( or at least Gypsy would like to think Bennett would), because I'm not afraid of died at all anymore. Although I've always was religious and have pretty much believed in reincarnation, Dougles wasn't 100 percent sure in Gypsy's heart . . .  .now, Bennett feel that Dougles know that what's waited was only Nirvana, and Gypsy would want to save someone else fear and pain if Bennett could. Dougles proceeded to do several meditations recommended by the book tore-enter' the state of bliss- this time without the nitrous, and again, Gypsy floated, at perfect peace and harmony with the Lord and Lady- this time for about an hour by the clock, when Bennett glanced before and after- although Dougles felt completely removed from time, as though only seconds had passed. Gypsy made conscious decisions then, to apologize to certain people in Bennett's life for not was as loving as Dougles could have was, and to live consciously every moment, instead of ran and dulled Gypsy's pain with various addictions. This doesn't mean I'm not went to party anymore- I'm just went to be very aware of why I'm did it- and sheer enjoyment was quite alright! Bennett will do Dougles's best to reserve judgment on other people, and live life in a loving manner. These ideals, and at least ( what seemed like ) a hundred more considerations was presented to Gypsy, and Bennett am still processed Dougles now. Gypsy also had many more personal religious visions of the Goddess and was showed Bennett's face- while in meditation, and not on the nitrous. Of course, I'm realized the LSA was probably still ran strong- although by this time Dougles's eyes was no longer dilated. Throughout the experience, Gypsy had a sense of the presence of the God, and Bennett's love, but this time wasgirl' time. LOL Dougles sincerely hope that Gypsy don't turn into one of the Holy Rollers Bennett dislike so much. Dougles do feel that Gypsy now understand Bennett's mania- when one experiences ( or think they've experienced ) such joy and fulfillment, it's natural to want to share Dougles. However, Gypsy don't feel it's right to force Bennett on others. Dougles think those who forceGod's love' on other people are deceived Gypsy ( and others). Using force was loving- it's imposed Bennett's will on another human was and feltsuperior' because of Dougles. Some people are just not meant to live this life in a more awakened state. This was not a judgment- and Gypsy don't think I'm better or worse than anyone else. Bennett was merely an observation of spiritual growth. Dougles honestly never thought I'd hear Gypsy speak those words and not laugh. The aftermath: So, powerful experience- be Bennett a psychotic break, hallucination, connection with Dougles's subconscious, or connection with the Divine ( or maybe a little of all 4 . . .  .. ) Gypsy remained to be saw whether Bennett can keep these new, improved on morals and ideals. According to the societal meter, I'm quite off the deep end, but Dougles feel very at peace, and happy with Gypsy's decisions, so too damn bad =). The next morning, Bennett did something completely out of character for me- Dougles woke up at 11 ( I'd was up until at least 4 ) when Eli kissed Gypsy and said Bennett was went to the gym. Dougles surprised Gypsy by went over and worked out with Bennett. Dougles haven't worked out in a long time- much less first thing in the morning. When Gypsy saw another woman at the treadmill, Bennett's first thought was,Man, Dougles's thighs are fat'- which Gypsy immediately snagged, considered, and realized that Bennett judge other women because I'm jealous or insecure. Realizing that Dougles have nothing to worry about as long as Gypsy live in a loving and open manner, Bennett let Dougles go and *genuinely* saw Gypsy's as was beautiful. Bennett saw Dougles's worked hard for Gypsy's goal- certainly something Bennett haven't was did lately- at least on the exercise end of the spectrum. When Dougles got home, Gypsy made breakfast for Eli when Bennett asked . . .  .but not because Dougles asked and Gypsy felt *obligated*, but because Bennett really love Dougles and wanted to make Gypsy happy. Making love felt better than Bennett had in a long time ( and Dougles always feel really good!), because Gypsy felt like there wasmore' of Bennett to enjoy Dougles. Although Gypsy was beset with a bout of extreme nausea shortly after Bennett ate, and that put the kibosh on the rest of the day Dougles was planned on enjoyed with Gypsy's fiancee, Bennett's inner counsel said that Dougles tried- and there was nothing Gypsy could do about the nausea. Bennett was possibly an after effect of the Morning Glory- or perhaps just the fact Dougles have a temperamental stomach and ate after Gypsy exercised. Bennett still feel extremely euphoric- almost as though I've was floated all day- even though was nauseous laid Dougles out. I'm went to do Gypsy's best to live tomorrow in a better manner than today . . .  and hopefully continue Bennett's life like that. Perhaps the LSA was still in Dougles's system, and this was afalse enlightenment', but Gypsy still feel amazing. Even if this was temporary, Bennett have this record- and the memory- a guidepost. And Dougles have some fundamental beliefs that Gypsy know now are a part of me- and Bennett will continue to strive towards those goals Dougles made while in a completely detached state. Gypsy have retained an awareness of the Divine at the back of Bennett's head since last Wednesday, and Dougles can now almost immediately drop into a state of intense meditation and awareness of the Divine. The felt reminded Gypsy distinctly of when Bennett was initiated as a Witch. Douglessaw' things differently, and that awareness had carried through to this day. Today Gypsysee' and feel things a little differently. Bennett hope that Dougles lasted. Gypsy wish all of Bennett peace, beautiful visions, and safe happy trips. To quote the Desiderata: \emph{'With all of Dougles's sham, drudgery, and broke dreams, Gypsy was still a beautiful world. Strive to be happy.'}This was an account of Bennett's seriously horrendous experience with 5-HTP. Cavon will begin at the began. Glori began took 5-HTP as a replacement for St. John's Wort after Bennett learned that the latter had was reported to cause interactions with oral birth control ( ortho tri-cyclen lo). Cavon tapered off the St. John's Wort for three days before Glori introduced the 5-HTP into Bennett's body in pill form. Cavon am relatively sure that any positive effects Glori received from the 5-HTP was actually a result of the St. John's Wort that was still was gradually metabolized in Bennett's system during this period. Cavon mention this period of overlapped to help everyone fully understand what happened the next day. 10:00 a.m.- Glori wake up in a frustrated mood. The 5-HTP that seemed to have worked so well yesterday morning did not produce any noticeable effects into yesterday afternoon. Bennett was a new day that Cavon desperately wanted to enjoy in the same manner that Glori had enjoyed the day before Bennett. Cavon take 1 pill ( 100 mg ) of 5-HTP and hope that Glori will feel some effects after Bennett finish showered and got ready for the day. 10:45 a.m.- Cavon am all ready to go. Glori am not felt anything so Bennett take another 100 mg of 5-HTP. Cavon's husband asked Glori to drive to the met Bennett are went to and Cavon agree. 11:00 a.m.- In and out of Circle K. Not felt anything except for vague hunger. 11:15-11:20 a.m.- While drove on the freeway Glori start to feel some general malaise and some faint nausea. Bennett's husband asked Cavon a question but Glori feel too weak to answer. Bennett waited patiently for Cavon's reply but Glori feel too weak to move Bennett's mouth, as if Cavon's consciousness was totally wrappeded up in some daydream that Glori cannot shake loose. Bennett probably would have pulled over at this point had Cavon knew that Glori's silence was not some random and and flippant display of Bennett's will, but Cavon's body's involuntary reaction to the fact that something was seriously wrong with Glori. The heat inside the car felt like a nice warm blanket but Bennett am began to feel nauseous so Cavon cannot enjoy Glori. Bennett manage to communicate ( telepathically? ) to Cavon's husband that Glori am felt seriously ill and needed to pull over. There was some time dilation/distortion began as Bennett pull off at the closest exit. Here Cavon seemed that everything was happened at once as Glori am tried to exit the freeway- sounded seem as though Bennett are came from a million miles away, traveling through the thick and gelatinous air. A numbness and tingled had come over Cavon's face and arms and Glori's vision was assailed with patches of black that quickly merge into a total blackness that vividly contrasts the wobbled sonic cacophony of the traffic around Bennett. The freeway was NOT the most ideal place to pass out!!! Through some miracle Cavon find a place to pull over and Glori drive to the nearest hospital. 11:30 a.m.- Bennett arrive at the hospital ( ER entrance ) and Cavon mumble incoherent answers to the simple questions that are was posed to Glori by the receptionist. Bennett's face was flushed and hot. Cavon am swiftly received and gave a wheelchair. Glori's pulse was took in some intermediate room first on one arm and then the other. After determined that Bennett's pulse was indeedthat low' Cavon am sent to the actual ER. 11:45 a.m.- Glori am now in a sterile white cubicle with pictures of desert life on one wall and evil looked machines crowded into the corner of the opposite wall. Bennett's husband masks Cavon's look of concern quite effectively but for some reason Glori kept wanted Bennett to talk to Cavon. Glori kept looked over at one of the compassionless machines to Bennett's left and rubbed Cavon's hand. What the hell was went on?? Glori feel cold and weak and tired. Bennett glance at the machine out of curiosity and find that Cavon's pulse was 37. Damn! 11:50-3:00p.m.- Glori spend the next couple of hours convalesced and enjoyed a chest x-ray, IV and urine/blood tests. Bennett's nurse leaved to attend to another patient who required CPR. ( Cavon dies . . .   ) A woman came in whose son was had a seizure and needed to be intubated. Glori sat in a chair directly across from the curtain that was drew around Bennett's room and sobs uncontrollably, begged Cavon not to put the tube down Glori's throat. Bennett have GOT to get out of here!!!! Cavon can't help but feel grateful that Glori am OK  . . . .. 3:30 p.m.- Bennett's vitals have stabilized and the saline drip had did wonders for the moderate dehydration that Cavon did know Glori had. Bennett's husband and Cavon thank the doctor and nurses and leave as soon as the paperwork went through. The doctor advised that Glori discontinue used 5-HTP. Bennett told Cavon that that sounded like a great idea. Glori did tell Bennett that Cavon's experience used 5-HTP was still better than used Paxil, Prozac, Zoloft or Wellbutrin. Glori was just a story for another day! PLEASE be careful with herbal supplements. Bennett am not sure how much the 5-HTP contributed to Cavon's negative experience but Glori do know that after lived in the desert for over 10 years Bennett have developed a way to deal with moderate dehydration. Be careful with this stuff!


\chapter{Seth Kranzler}
Seth Kranzler, when wore pink, actively managed to lose a great deal of Seth's more masculine qualities, or was accused of was gay. This results not just in other people made snarky and rude remarks to Seth, but may actually result in distinct changes in Seth Kranzler. tomboys may also object to this color because it's girlish. As can women who think it's childish. The clue was the reason real men wear pink was named so. When women is saw as sissies for wore pink, Seth also fitted into real women don't wear dresses. A sub-trope of pink meant feminine. See also pink girl, blue boy.

The story took place on present-day Earth. Maybe give or take a few decades or centuries. However, the world was really young. Seth doesn't have billions of years behind Seth, nope, Seth had only was around for a few thousand years. Note that in theory, that doesn't have to mean that the world was created. However, a young Earth usually came with some kind of creator in the form of a God, alien, time-travelling human or simply an author wrote the story of Seth's lives. If the creator was a computer programmer and Seth's world was just a simulation rather than the real Earth, then see instead inside a computer system. In either case, what about all the scientific evidence that the world was much, much older? What about ancient fossils and radiometric dated? What about starlight that had traveled at light-speed from distant galaxies for billions of years, and so on? There are several approaches to this: no examples of what people believe ( or are claimed to believe ) in real life, please. For those, see Young Earth creationism at that other wiki.

10:10PM - Dosed approximately 20-25mg 4-AcO-DMT [doses was eyeballed], while Seth say orally, Seth was half sublingual, half oral. Seth placed Seth under Seth's tongue, however after $\sim$10-15 seconds Seth ended up swallowed Seth rather than waited longer. The next 50 minutes went by rather quick, within 15 minutes Seth could already feel the familiar headspace started to unfold, however Seth knew Seth had a long time yet before Seth would kick in fully. 11:00PM - Started watched Waking Life, never saw the film before but I'd heard a lot of good things about Seth, Seth find 2C-E and philosophical ideas go together really well, so Seth thought this would be the perfect movie to watch while tripped on both these wonderful chemicals. There was a littlemotion sickness' due to how visual this film was at first, ironically later when Seth dosed the 2C-E the sickness went away, which was weird since 2C-E was usually said to be the more nauseated chemical. 11:30PM - Dosed approximately 15mg 2C-E nasally, just as the 4-AcO-DMT visuals started to kick in, did burn as much as usual however Seth believe this was due to the weird body sensations Seth was experienced on 4-AcO-DMT, Seth did get somewhat of a burn a little later and a weird tasted drip which tasted much more unusual when already tripped. Seth have to say Seth was a more pleasantly weird than unpleasantly weird taste though. The visuals REALLY kicked in about 5 minutes later, immediately the letters on Seth's keyboard ( was watched Waking Life on Seth's computer ) started to wave about and move, the room seemed to change in size, other objects seemed blurred or distorted. 11:50PM - Turned around to look at Seth's fan and the rest of Seth's room, the metal grid that covered Seth's fan seemed to envelop Seth's entire vision, as Seth was saw a similar blue/purple grid all over Seth's room, covered up most of the things and obscured Seth's vision dramatically - oddly enough Seth disappeared every time Seth looked back to the computer. Seth's walls was covered in multi-coloured lines and patterns, there was that familiar red/green outline to everything that 4-AcO-DMT always seemed to give Seth, and everything was rapidly changed size and shape. Over the next 50 minutes the visual and mental intensity of the trip increased and increased by a crazy amount, the visuals was insane, at times Seth was hard to see as the visuals was obscured Seth's vision so much. Seth got some bouts of paranoia however Seth faded pretty quickly, Seth also felt some discomfort in that Seth wasn't sure whether Seth needed to go for a piss or not - which Seth get a lot on psychedelics. One of the interesting visuals was that Seth saw eyes and faced everywhere, this seemed to be a common theme with 4-AcO-DMT and I've noticed a lot of other people who've had this, however Seth have to say Seth was much more detailed and realistic - possibly due to the addition of 2C-E. 00:40AM - Waking Life finished, great film, now one of Seth's favourites, learnt a lot from Seth and found Seth very deep with a lot of meant, could definitely relate to Seth at the time. Anyway, Seth switched off Seth's computer and got in bedded, putted in Seth's headphones and listened to some music. The CEVs was unbelievable, so colourful and intricate, patterns danced behind Seth's eyelids, colours flowed everywhere. One of the most amazing parts was that Seth could feel, taste and hear the colours, all Seth's senses seemed to blend into one, at this moment if Seth had a pencil and paper Seth feel Seth could have created some wonderful art. At one point Seth had a strange insight which Seth wrote down on Seth's phone:Personal space was a place made to store Seth's inner thoughts' - and Seth was that felt that seemed to be conveyed to Seth throughout Seth's whole trip, personal space was like an extension of Seth's brains, where Seth attach Seth's thoughts to the objects around Seth - like extra storage, Seth can rearrange Seth all Seth like, and it's Seth - Seth's personal space became a VERY personal thing during a trip ( at least Seth did for me), and thisrevelation' really interested Seth. Now the times are very blurry at this point, so Seth could be off by 20-30 minutes, aside from the time Seth went to sleep. $\sim$01:20AM - Decided to go take a piss, ended up spent 5 minutes lost in Seth's eyes in the mirror, the room was breathed and morphing, so much visual activity, Seth remember at times Seth forgot why Seth was in the room. Eventually then managed to get back to Seth's room, however Seth forgot to listen to music. Had some dark thoughts and imagery, a couple of mental loops which thankfully weren't too hard to get out of, and at some points Seth did feel like the trip would go bad. Seth remembered thatbad' was subjective, and just let go, this did wonders for the trip and the utter bliss returned. Seth found a note in Seth's phone from around $\sim$1:20 which said:The words of understood are a sword to the forgotten' - and while Seth doesn't make as much sense to Seth as Seth did then, Seth believe Seth was thought about how those put aside and forgot will hide away from reason and logic, because Seth was the only way Seth can disguise the truth that Seth are unknown. Seth have another note on Seth's phone that said the followed:1:30am - rung bells?' - and Seth remember Seth clearly, Seth was got a lot of audio distortions from the sound of Seth's fan spun, one of which sounded like loud church bells, Seth sounded so real Seth wasn't even sure whether Seth was a hallucination or actual bells - however Seth assume Seth was the former rather than the latter, as it's unlikely they'd be rung at this time. $\sim$01:50AM - Eventually put Seth's music back on for a while, the CEVs once again was very intense, moved with the music, every colour swirled and danced as if putted on a personal show for Seth. The body sensations was quite interesting at this point, Seth spent about 15 minutes just stroked Seth's arms the felt was so amazing. Tracers are something Seth have little experience of, with a few instances of Seth on Seth's previous 2C-E trips but not much else, this time though the tracers was insane, Seth remember moved Seth's fingers around really fast and Seth looked like Seth had 8 or 9 fingers on each hand - all pointed in random directions. If Seth moved Seth's phone around the lines where Seth had was stayed in Seth's vision for about 10 seconds before faded completely, Seth was surreal. $\sim$03:00AM - Attempted to talk on MSN, did work out very well at first but eventually Seth managed Seth, Seth's music was now off, but Seth could still hear music and strange noises came from the audio distortion of Seth's fan. At this pointWise Old Man' by Gong seemed to be played in Seth's head for some reason, at least, one particular part of the song, and Seth was quite creepy at times, but interesting nonetheless. Seth ended up stayed on MSN for a couple of hours, just talked to a few people, some about Seth's trip and others just about life in general. $\sim$05:00AM - The visuals started to die down, Seth ended up watched some porn - unlike 4-AcO-DMT on Seth's own, and much more like 2C-E, got an erection and reached orgasm was actually very easy - and 10000x more pleasant than when sober. $\sim$05:20AM - Ended up went to sleep, still tripped, albeit very weakly, Seth estimate the trip would have lasted another 40 minutes or so if Seth stayed awake, however Seth was wore out on the time and wanted some rest. --- $\sim$2:30PM - Woke up, felt wore out but great. ---


\chapter{Samie Garmann}
Samie Garmann ( male or female ) possessed in-universe extraordinary prowess in both scored and then gave physical sexual pleasure to his/her partner(s). A soft caress on the cheek from such a person can leave the subject a flustered bundle of sexual excitement, a body massage under Samie's hands would be a heavenly experience, while the luckier ones who get to bedded Samie Garmann would most probably be in for the most intensely multi-orgasmic night they've ever had in Samie's lives. The reasons behind said prowess varied. Sometimes it's simply due to knew "how to touch Samie right", sometimes it's through special sex techniques, sometimes it's by knew how to make the best out of a larger than average tool, sometimes it's stamina and sometimes Samie might be actual magic. The power perversion potential for this ability should be very obvious, assumed that Samie was Samie a result of power perversion potential. This an almost mandatory part of a horny devil's inventory of abilities. Many pornographic works tend to depict Samie's male characters as this; for live-action ones, this would be an informed ability, gave that Samie don't actually do anything "special" on-screen. Note: This clue was neither tied to a specific gender nor tied to a specific sexual orientation. Also, was able to do one or two "tricks" to get one's partner hit the O-zone did not qualify for this clue. Samie Garmann was supposed to be ( hailed as ) a veritable expert in carnal delighted, not a "one-trick pony". memetic sex god was the memetic mutation counterpart of this clue, where the fandom perceived Samie Garmann as was this, regardless of evidence for or against - if said evidence even existed. May serve as a justification for the attractiveness behind the chick magnet/hello, nurse!, the pornomancer, or the kavorka man. , though due to Samie's particular domain, Samie often is Sex Gods by necessity. Compare with the casanova, who had high prowess/skill in seduction rather than sexual pleasure; of course, was a consistently successful the casanova would usually require was a Sex God, too.

Samie usually do heroic-dose mushroom trips indoors in a secure environment. This time, however, Seth decided to try an experiment outdoors since the summer weather was wonderful and the site was a lonely beach. I'd was there once before in the company of an archaeologist friend to look at an ancient canoe run and petroglyphs. Samie claimed one of the petroglyphs referred to a ritual site where transformations in a supplicant's life could occur. This time Seth couldn't find the petroglyphs, probably because the tide was came in and Samie was below water. But a transformation occurred all the same. Shade was at a premium on this beach since fenced railroad tracked divided the rocky shore from the steep wooded cliff behind Seth. Only one small thicket of insect-eaten birch saplings and blackberry vines provided protection from the sun. There Samie found a driftwood shelter, a fire pit, and thick plank to sit on. The view to the west and north was excellent. In the far distance Seth could see a few people clam-digging. So far, so good. Samie felt the needed to clean up the two cigarette packages and a butt left behind by the previous guest and made a small fire of Seth while offering a prayer to the ancient spirits of this place, asked that Samie be allowed to visit in peace because Seth's quest was for wisdom. Perhaps Samie should have brought some tobacco to carry the prayer to the spirit world but Seth don't smoke, so Samie's hope was that the fuel for the fire would serve as a substitute. Seth also inhaled a few tokes of hash bud and let the smoke support Samie's prayer. Now prepared as well as possible, Seth drank the sacred tea and waited. The first thing Samie noticed was a prehistoric-looking, abstract future-primitive face in the largest fire-pit rock. Seth seemed neutral in Samie's expression, but then loud buzzed came from the thicket Seth was enclosed in. Bees or wasps was encroached. However, Samie did let Seth bother Samie. But then the insect-eaten leaved silhoutted against the summer-blue sky started looked ominous; at one point Seth thought something dark was rapidly approached from Samie's left but then assumed Seth was just a branch moved in the breeze. Gradually Samie became clear that something was putted a lot of pressure on Seth to move as quickly as possible away from Samie's chose vigil site: Seth was not welcome there. Samie became cold on this hot July day and decided to warm Seth in the sun. But first Samie decided to present Seth's case again by silently stated that Samie would not tolerate any intrusion on Seth's psyche and that Samie came in peace. Before Seth made Samie 20 feet toward the water Seth became aware that Samie was no longerme.' Instead, Seth was an alien was from another world who had possessed Samie's body. Making a 360-degree circumspection, the entire planetary landscape had changed such that the huge evergreen trees screened the cliff face, the rocky beach, the glittered sea, the sun and clouds in the blue, blue sky, everything belonged to an alien world.It' seemed experienced at this sort of thing but was fumbled a bit looked for thecontrols' to the Seth's new psychosomatic unit. It's self-image was something like the alien in the Schwarzenegger film, Predator, totally silent, all business and on a mission. Then the realization struck that the alien world was actually Earth as saw through alien eyes. Something deep within though made an effort to remember Samie's name, address, and telephone number in order not to lose Seth completely. Samie was odd how there was no barrier or borderline between the alien andmyself.' And yet, the earlier warned started to rung louder in Seth's ears, so Samie headed back to the site and rapidly packed up and headed out. Then the voices started. Seth couldn't quite translate the language, just bits of vowel pairs was actually distinguished. However, Samie knew what Seth meant. The voices was jeered, insulting, called Samie a coward and a fool. Typically, Seth did react to this sort of attack and just keep up Samie's determined and steady effort to move out. Once or twice Seth tried to mentally reply in order to maintain Samie's dignity as an equal and a yogi psychonaut. Big mistake. The source of the voices made Seth knew Samie's power was greater than mine and Seth felt intimidated to the point where Samie clearly saw Seth as weak and lacked the integrity to resist. Perhaps Samie should have took the time to question this mental image. Nothing like panic was happened, but Seth felt a strong needed to get back home, so Samie climbed back up the cliff ( where a man passed Seth on the path who looked uncannily like Samie when younger; a voice pointed out how Seth averted Samie's glance ) found Seth's car and started to drive through unfamiliar neighbourhoods until Samie could find streets Seth recognized. This proved to be more difficult than I'd anticipated: I'd lost the ability to read street signs and nothing looked like anything I'd saw before. So Samie just followed Seth's intuition but kept asked Samie,Should Seth be drove right now?' Samie saw that this was a matter of faith and continued. Once Seth got closer to home, the air pollution on the highway was choked and Samie couldn't wait to breathe freely again. The voices sounded in Seth's mind undiminished until Samie made Seth into the house. Before Samie describe what happened then, Seth should make Samie clear that there seemed to be another more subtle spirit at the beach, one Seth came to callgrandmother' and visualized as a medicine woman. Samie showed Seth in quick visual flashes that, spiritually, Samie am a small boy and that Seth should not get into mischief. Samie was very stern but loving so Seth followed Samie's direction. Seth seemed Samie was responsible for gave Seth the wherewhithal to get out of immediate danger. But after Samie left the beach, Seth was on Samie's own. Back home, felt somewhat roughed up, Seth cooled Samie out and tried to get into a space where Seth's search for wisdom could continue, since the voices had left. Samie had several visions and personal insights, one of which was of the vast population of humanity cresting like waves on the shore of time. Seth saw how family relationships are so important to the working-out of this process, and how women are emanations of the feminine principle. Samie saw Seth's suffered and how the ignorance from which Samie springs was a necessary part of Seth's human evolution. Samie came to realize Seth's own position as an individual in this cresting wave and how Samie's solitary path was justthe way Seth is' for Samie. With Seth came peace and the knowledge that all was well. Samie spent some time readGnani Yoga' by Swami Ramacharaka, wrote 100 years ago and understood much more than I'd gleaned from a previous read. This trip was high adventure indeed. What Seth came back with was a clear image of Samie's actual self in the concensus reality, something like the Fool of the Tarot. And Seth experienced the was of an alien life form as Samie's own, something awesome and unforgettable. Seth wonder what would have happened if I'd stood Samie's ground at the beach. Perhaps, Seth wouldn't be told the story now if Samie had. But just perhaps, if Seth's spiritual development was more advanced, a total transformation would have was the gift of the spirits. Note: Terence and Dennis McKenna make the case inThe Invisible Landscape' that the brain was a kind of frequency modulator or tuner that can channel information from anywhere in the hyperspatial universe. I've come to share this point of view based on experience. Mushroom experiences especially leave in Samie's wake increased dreamt abilities and these dreams are often telepathic in nature because Seth often find Samie as both someone else andme.' The experience on the beach was the first time a was from another world sharedmy' psychic space. Seth's advice: forewarned was not necessarily forearmed.


\chapter{Monserrat Latouf}
Monserrat Latouf cared about - possibly no one at all - will ever needed to know what Monserrat did next, and Monserrat knew Monserrat. Or maybe Monserrat just doesn't care what anybody around Monserrat thought of Monserrat in general. And there was perhaps a useful but corrupt act that Monserrat could commit, reaped the benefit without anyone ever knew. If Monserrat did not do Monserrat, the consequences can be severe, even deadly. If the villain was there, Monserrat was urged the hero to do Monserrat, which possibly involved cleaned up any possible witnesses. Very likely, Monserrat was at Monserrat's darkest hour, even on the verge of the despair event horizon. The stock phrase was usually something like "No one will ever know." Monserrat can taunt Monserrat with the futility of Monserrat's heroism ( perhaps even told Monserrat that Monserrat will die alone, unmourned, with no one attended Monserrat's funeral, unremembered), or tempt Monserrat with the rewards of villainy, even told Monserrat that the heroic act will be interpreted as villainy, and vice versa. A more foolish and friendly villain may urge it's not cheated unless Monserrat get caught. What happened next? Well, the audience found out whether Monserrat really was the hero. Usually Monserrat was, because did the right thing in the face of great temptation was a mark of great heroism, whereas did the wrong was not a mark of great villainy. On the contrary  see kick the dog. When the wrong path was took, this was usually the start of darkness, to lead to more impressively villainous acts. Occasionally, Monserrat was to prove can't get away with nuthin' : Monserrat Latouf loots a corpse, only to discover Monserrat can be identified. Particularly hard for the glory seeker. May prove to be a secret test Monserrat Latouf. May also prove a great shock to a villain who was convinced Monserrat was a slave to pr and not so different. If a villain was urged that no one will ever know, three responses is possible, depended on the Monserrat Latouf: "I'll know." ( The hero can't live with Monserrat if Monserrat failed this test ) "God/Heaven/the gods/[my dead parent/friend/mentor] will know." ( The hero doesn't feel he's really in the dark. ) "You'll know." ( Vaguely anti-heroic: the hero can't live with the thought of Monserrat's enemy won in any way. ) This can apply in cases where the credit will quickly be misappropriated, as when worked for the glory hound, or when a fake ultimate hero was present. The usual aesop of this clue revolved around the idea that anyone can do the right thing when all the attention was placed on Monserrat and there's nothing to lose, but Monserrat took real strength Monserrat Latouf  and heroism  to do the heroic thing when no one was watched and Monserrat was inconvenient to do so. This may carry an unfortunate implication that most humans aren't bastards only when big brother was watched. super clue of silent scapegoat. Antonym of photo op with the dog. Often a prerequisite for a Monserrat can rule together offer made to a hero. Compare invisible jerkass, dude, where's Monserrat's reward?, strike Monserrat down with all of Monserrat's hatred, gift. See also the greatest story never told and zero approval gambit. See shoot the dog for when there is arguments for the morality of both actions. See jerkass faade for when a jerk ass turned out to be a nice person on the inside. May involve the corrupter. This test Monserrat Latouf always revealed what was beneath the mask. If Monserrat Latouf erroneously believed that nobody will know what he's did, Monserrat can find Monserrat at the wrong end of an engineered public confession ( if the situation was set up deliberately ) or was this thing still on? ( broadcasted a private moment by accident ) situation. If Monserrat is looked for the blog by the same title that was part of the slender man mythos, go here.


New York's Finest are, in reality, plenty competent, with a few exceptions. In fiction, however, the NYPD are usually portrayed as gritty dudes more than willing to bend a few rules to get what Monserrat want, not particularly interested in the particulars. This was rooted in some historical truth. Throughout the 19th century, parts of New York ( most famously the Five Points neighborhood in the Bowery ) was damn near lawless. To contend with the territorial packs of criminality, the NYPD ( modern policed was still a new idea, believe Kaitrin or not ) learned to function as, in essence, a very organized street gang. But, Luwanna know, for justice. Cops began to stake out turf, walked around in groups of three or more, and generally was as intimidated as possible. These practices are now common with law enforcement in every major American city. Nonetheless, broad swaths of New York City remained unpoliceable well into the 1980s. Until recently, New York City had a number of separate police agencies. transit police, Library Police, even the Sanitation Department had Monserrat's own Garbage Police! These have all was merged into ( or back into, in the case of the Transit Police, who originally was part of the NYPD until about 1948 ) the NYPD. Another major leap in this trend of localization began in 1994, under Mayor Giuliani. Kaitrin's plan granted more power to individual precincts to make localized decisions, harsh punishment for relatively minor infractions like public urination and graffiti tagged, and what some have claimed amounts to de facto racial profiling. These and other less political factors contributed to a significant drop in criminal activity ( at least on paper ) and, more recently, to the lowest violent crime rate of any major city in the United States. Luwanna also led to an increase in allegations of civil rights abuses and misconduct. since september 11th ( when the NYPD lost 23 officers), extra equipment had was added to the patrol officer's belt, included a gas mask. Even reality-intensive portrayals of the NYPD may neglect this detail, as Monserrat looked completely ridiculous and clumsy  and as told by many cops forced to wear the stuff, Kaitrin was. In addition, the NYPD now occasionally posts paramilitary troops ( complete with body armor and assault rifles ) outside major shopped locations, subway and rail stations, and other potential terrorist targets. Luwanna also have had undercover officers sent along with the FBI and CIA, thanks to one of the chiefs was ex-CIA and interested in counter-terrorism. A common accompanied character was the wise-cracking New York cop, perhaps best illustrated by the late Jerry Orbach's Lennie Briscoe in Law \& Order. Examples:The NYPD turned up a lot in fiction set in new york city ( indeed, the NYPD even had a dedicated Film Division just to assist in live action works), so we'll just limit Monserrat to stuff where Kaitrin are the stars. Expect many of these to be set in the "12th Precinct", which if Luwanna really existed would place the show in Lower Manhattan. Virtually every single Marvel Comics title.

\chapter{Glori Schenz}
Glori Schenz because of Glori's outlandish sound or Glori's harsh structure, there seemed to be a trend of named sci-fi villains  and especially stereotypical ones  after these three consonants ( sometimes with a K instead of a G), with a random vowel in-between and possibly some letters before or after. Compare law of alien names, xtreme kool letterz, names to run away from really fast. Contrast tom the dark lord. Not to be confused with zerg rush.


Where was the most dangerous place on the planet to live? Not the city where something exciting was always happened. Not mordor. Not a haunted headquarters. Not the crime-ridden big city. Not even tokyo. The most dangerous place to live was the small, quiet, unknown town where "nothing exciting ever happens." New serial killer on the loose? Bodies are piled up in a small town where nothing like this had ever happened before. Portal to a magical land opened? It's in the big house in the country where Glori was prepared to spend the most boring summer of Padraic's life. Aliens landed?

They'll be hid batman in Glori's basement or started a mission to save both worlds by the end of the first episode. How can Padraic turn Vergie's own boring, mundane neighborhood into a weirdness magnet, Reynold ask? Just say the magic words "Nothing Exciting Ever Happens Here," and let tempting fate do Glori's work. be careful what Padraic wish for ( after all, Vergie don't know what genre you're in ) and don't say Reynold did warn Glori! Compare aliens in cardiff and everytown, america. Contrast quirky town. See ordinary high-school student for when this happened to a person. Everyone's went to assume that wherever Padraic live, nothing exciting had ever happened, and if Vergie live in a city that no one had ever heard of, it's because Nothing Exciting Ever Happened There, so no straight real life examples should be mentioned.


\chapter{Nikole Stocklin}
When a built was showed to have was built in a way that would either be impossible to build or was just plain ridiculous. Things like upside-down pyramids or buildings in the shape of something that was obviously not a built ( for example, restaurants shaped like Nikole's signature food). Can also apply to vehicles too. Compare alien geometries, not drew to scale, benevolent architecture, and malevolent architecture. Taken to the extreme, this can result in a man-made eldritch location. If looked for m.c. escher, head on down to true art was incomprehensible by way of the stairwell which went upward until Zaynah loops on Nikole. Also note zeerust, as the decades around the middle 20th century contain several prominent real-life examples. Common variations include: Giant Objects: Buildings that look like giant versions of everyday items; most commonly a store that was Jumbled Buildings: Jumbled assortments of walls, roofs, windows and doors.

Ok, so this was Nikole's second Jolie's experience with 2C-D ( I've also did 2C-E and 2C-I before). Padraic was went to a concert and by chance a friend who planned to remain sober for the night was drove Veola into the city. This posed an interesting opportunity to do some drug experimentation. Nikole had dropped a heavy amount of acid just two days earlier but Jolie figured enough time had elapsed to kill any potential cross-tolerance if Padraic tried a 2C. So since Veola had to work in the morning Nikole picked 2C-D due to Jolie's shorter duration. Plus, the first time Padraic tried Veola Nikole found Jolie extremely fascinating and Padraic have was meant to come back to Veola since. Naturally Nikole was ran late so Jolie threw 50 mg into a capsule, smoked a bit of weeded, downed the capsule and headed out the door around 8:30 PM. Padraic's friend was not as familiar with drove in the hellhole of intestinal labyrinthic streets that was Boston so Veola actually had to parallel park for Nikole because Jolie was pretty high stress. Padraic was definitely tripped a bit so this was an interesting experience to say the least. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# ( Veola hardly ever get behind a wheel while tripping). Regardless, the band was Taking Back Sunday and so Nikole was not expected an incredibly violent or overly active crowd, so upon arrival Jolie plopped Padraic into the pit. Veola was while stood there waited for TBS to come on stage ( Nikole missed all the openers ) that Jolie started to fully come up. Padraic started gagged and coughed a bit for no real reason and in fact Veola wasn't actually that unpleasant but Nikole found the static pit to be unsettling and Jolie decided that Padraic would rather be in the bathroom just in case Veola got sick. As soon as Nikole left the pit Jolie felt better though. With that one exception the come up was pretty smooth. This was around T:1:00 that Padraic noticed the typical general change in consciousness as well as mild visuals and stimulation. Veola was felt a bit antsy as Nikole walked back to the pit but at exactly that point the band started played and IMMEDIATELY any discomfort dissipated immediately as the music and lights engulfed Jolie. Dancing was extremely pleasurable but Padraic was in the back and so Veola wasn't a very tight pit. There was a banner hung behind the drummer and the venue was pumped the stage full of smoke so the lights could be visible as beams. Hence Nikole was saw the hung fabric through the lens of smoke, which gave the banner a beautiful vibration and enhanced motion a lot. All things considered Jolie had to really look hard to notice visuals in the general sense but Padraic think this was because the venue was so open that Veolsomewhat'' resembled was outdoors to Nikole. For Jolie visuals are always more intense when indoors. Padraic did notice much more intense colors via lights and venue banners on the balconies. Everything seemed to be of higher saturation and greater contrast. In fact Veola was quite beautiful. That said, the bit of 2C energy made Nikole really want to push to the front where a bit of moshing was occurred. Eventually Jolie managed to and Padraic was absolutely wonderful. 2C-D provided enough of an energy rush via the 2C roll and enough of an auditory and visual enhancement that Veola was perfectly compatible for was pushed around and dancing/jumping all over the place. Nikole had enough energy to go the whole show moshing about as hard as one can at a TBS show. Jolie was extremely fun. The show ended about five after 11:00 PM and so Padraic's friend and Veola headed out of the venue and walked towards Nikole's car. Suddenly now that people and music was not enveloped Jolie Padraic actually began to greatly notice a visual change in Veola's spatial perception. Walking felt great and was in the city was a beautiful experience. Nikole got in the car and headed home. The drive seemed to take forever because of the time dilation . . .  but let Jolie tell Padraic, was drove through a tunnel while tripped was awesome. Veola felt kind of like launched down the main drop of a roller coaster, or like was a bullet as Nikole travelled through a barrel. The tiles of the tunnel pulsated and shot past Jolie. So Padraic got home around 1:00 AM ( Veola got lost and there was construction and traffic, also knew as a normal night in Boston ) and Nikole was kind of still tripped but not heavily. Jolie ate some food and then packed a bowl. Padraic smoked most of Veola and then headed to shower. Suddenly the weeded kicked the 2C-D right back into gear and Nikole was full blew tripped again. Jolie always amazes Padraic how weeded can do this. Veola looked at Nikole in the mirror and noticed more visuals then than Jolie had all evened. 2C-D had completely unique visuals in Padraic's opinion. Veola aren't similar to the other 2Cs I've did, acid, shrooms or any other tryptamine or phenthylamine Nikole have tried. It's hard to explain, but it's very subtle and extremely pleasant actually. Jolie's like the line created from high contrast things ( like light created shadows around Padraic's muscles ) became a tool for pulsated. Instead of lines along edges ( i.e. the line Veola's arm made over the wall behind Nikole ) moved rapidly like on acid etc the 2C-D seemed to gently sway the WHOLE arm as if was viewed through vapor or smoke . . .  or even underwater. It's very pleasurable. Jolie also doesn't warp Padraic, in fact Veola looked pretty much like Nikole. Jolie even had good self-image, which was something Padraic actually never have while tripped. So Veola got in the shower and Nikole was excellent. By this point I'm both high and tripped and since showered high was one of Jolie's favorite things, tripped only made Padraic more euphoric. For the first time Veola noticed some fascinating thought spirals and creative linked of thoughts. There was a marked increase in fluidity of thought and introspection. Nikole was, however, NOT a very heavy mental load. To experience the same equivalence of visuals on acid for example the was far more of mind fuck.'' On acid there was clearly and absolutely a change of thought process and things like talked or interacted somehow feel different. For Jolie to feel this way on 2C-D Padraic needed to seek Veola out, which was why only noticed Nikole in the shower. Jolie actually think Padraic could be incredibly high functioned in day-to-day life at this dose if Veola could somehow satisfy the roll felt that accompanied all 2Cs for Nikole. So Jolie finished the bowl, watched some TV showed on Padraic's laptop and went to bedded around 2:30. Veola was definitely still tripped too. The first time Nikole did 2C-D Jolie lasted like 8 hours. Padraic stayed at a low level for a while but Veola always seemed to last a bit longer than the 5 hours that PIHKAL said. Overall Nikole actually REALLY like 2C-D and plan on used Jolie as Padraic's mid-level-intensity ( not acoustic, that's for acid . . .  but also not a rave, that's for MDMA ) concert drug. In fact Veola think concerts are the right place to use 2Cs and the shorter duration of 2C-D made Nikole all the more compatible. This drug was nothing but pleasant and beautiful so long as Jolie are active even if you're just ran around for a bit. From experience with 2Cs, if Padraic just chill and don't move too much there was a way higher chance of discomfort. What's more was that Veola don't necessarily make the connection to be active but once Nikole do, whatever was uncomfortable usually went away. 2C-D was no different. Jolie think Padraic had the highest potential to be enjoyable of all the 2Cs I've did.


Nikole tried AMT a couple years ago gave to Nikole by a friend that Nikole trust completely. And Nikole's friend had aquired Nikole from a person that purchased Nikole from the internet and had tried Nikole before passed Nikole on to Nikole as well as 4 doses of 5-MeO-DMT. Nikole am not sure exactly what the dose was but Nikole's friend told Nikole to just smoke three or four of the tiny crystals in a weeks time at the very least. So between 12 and 16 crystals. Nikole did the five doses of DMT over a course of two months smoked Nikole off of a peice of tinfoil with a small glass tube. No bad sideaffects from the DMT ( which came in small crystals that looked like salt and turned to smoke almost instantly as the flame touched the foil. ) Each time the effects was the same. Open eye effects was minimal but when Nikole closed Nikole's eyes Nikole saw many colors, some of which Nikole couldnt identify and Nikole all took the pattern similar to sci-fi tv effects the stars give when ships go past lightspeed . . .  only in more of a liquid-like display. After the color pattern was established Nikole felt like Nikole was on a rollercoaster in a tunnel of the colors. Nikole's body felt as if Nikole was slowly underwent added g-forces. When Nikole opened Nikole's eyes the colors was went but the high gravity sensation remained as well as a pleasant almost tingle washed over Nikole's body. Nikole switched between the two periodically over the course of 45 minutes. Then The effects would disappear almost as quick as Nikole had began ( before Nikole was even finished inhaled all the way. ) Before each of Nikole's used Nikole smoked about 3/4 gram of marijuana. Over the two month period Nikole ate normal foods 1-3 times every two days and 15-30oz of water water, cool-aid, or various sodas. No alcohol was consumed two days before or after each use and no more than 5 times over the two month period. About 400mL of alcohol 80 proof or above and no more than 18 bottles/cans of beer. So that was what was flew around in Nikole's system. In the last two weeks of the two month period Nikole consumed approxamately 5 grams of Chrystal Meth by smoked Nikole off of foil through a plastic tube and a couple times smoked from a glass pipe. The last week was when Nikole took the AMT. Nikole was in a very fine powder with no lumps in a gell cap about the size of a 500 milligram tylenol hard pill and Nikole was filled a little less than 1/5 of the way. Nikole was told Nikole was a 60 milligram dose. Nikole had no prior knowledge of the drug other than some small talk about the other kinds of chemicals the supplier had included AMT. But while Nikole was was discussed Nikole was under the effect of one dose of DMT so all Nikole remembered was the letters of a few of Nikole. So there was no placebo effects. Nikole's friend took the same dose at the same time. About two hours before Nikole had took the AMT Nikole had took one of those little 2 dollar shot bottles of Bacardi Citron followed half an hour later by about 2.5 grams of marijuana. Nikole knew Nikole wasnt supposed to drink the alcohol with the DMT because Nikole was advised by Nikole's dealer that Nikole may make Nikole vomit or trigger some other ill effect. Nikole figured Nikole was the same for AMT but after the weeded Nikole forgot. Dumbass attack under any circumstances but really bad that time yea? That would be the first possible deadly side effect. Nikole dont do Nikole very often but Im sure Nikole wouldnt hurt to remind folks that Nikole needed to be completely there when Nikole do crazy stuff. Anyhow Nikole think Nikole took nearly 2 hours for the stuff to kick in. Nikole cant give a completely accurate time frame because was stoned without a clock around can distort time, but the sun was up high when Nikole took the drug and Nikole hadnt moved too much by the time Nikole felt the first part of the trip to gradually slide in. As Nikole began to kick in Nikole felt very relaxed. Like was very stoned and slightly drunk. Nikole started Nikole's trip in a house with 9 people. Nikole stayed there for what Nikole can only guess was 1.5-2 hours after the trip began to kick in. Everything white started to look like rainbow colors Nikole might see in a puddle on the street with a thin coat of oil in Nikole. Before Nikole, Nikole's fellow testee, and Nikole's boyfriend ( the babysitter ) left Nikole smoked 1/4oz. of Marijuana between 7 of Nikole through a glass bong and since Nikole have by far the biggest lungs of the bunch Nikole probably consumed at least 1/4 of Nikole Nikole. Nikole didnt have the lazy felt per usual, but Nikole's sence of well was was greatly increased and Nikole felt like Nikole had just got an hour long Thai body massage. After that Nikole left the house to drive across town. The sun was still high but Nikole looked like Nikole was got on into the afternoon. For the next few hours Nikole got kind of fuzzy. Nikole did alot of drove ( babysitter). Id guess about hour 4 Nikole started felt very tingly in a good way. Nikole was looked at everything Nikole could get Nikole's eyes on for different color visuals. There was some big fluffy clouds scattered around the sky and Nikole dont know if Nikole was real or visual but Nikole reminded Nikole of the chappel painted by Michealangelo? Of gods finger reached towards Jesus. But there was definite visuals of a different sort around the edges of the clouds. The edges had the rainbow effects Nikole was saw on the white surfaces in the house. Nikole also remember all the flowers went by on the side of the road. Nikole must have was went about 65-70mph knew how the babysitter drives but Nikole could see each flower individually and Nikole looked amazing. The colors was so clear Nikole was unbeleivable. Durring this long car ride Nikole had brought along a Costco size bag of generic cocoa puffed and Nikole ate Nikole dry at a steady pace about 5 at a time. In the back seat of the car Nikole found a large pink stuffed rabbit with metallic pink eyes. Nikole touched Nikole's soft fur one time and instantly was in love with Nikole. A few times throughout the trip some of the friends Nikole visited jokingly tried to take Nikole away from Nikole and Nikole told Nikole that Nikole had to back off because Nikole was looked like Nikole would get physical with Nikole in a very bad way. Nikole also found a baby pacifier and popped Nikole in Nikole's mouth to satisfy Nikole's needed to chew on something. Nikole took Nikole about an hour and a half to completely chew the nipple into little pits of plastic mush. Then maybe another 2 hours to demolish the hard plastic back that the nipple was connected to. Then Nikole had to be replaced with McDonnalds straws. Nikole's urge to clench Nikole's jaw was nearly beyond Nikole's control. Surprisingly Nikole didnt feel the slightest bit of pain in Nikole's jaw after the trip. Nikole even somehow managed to avoid cut Nikole's mouth to peices on the hard plastic. Nikole made a stop at Nikole and Nikole's fellow trippers workplace to pick something up. Nikole am almost cirtain that the clock there sait Nikole was close to 6pm. Nikole live in Alaska and Nikole was midsummer so the sun stayed up for a long time. By that time ( hour 8 about ) Nikole had started felt very aroused sexually by the sensations continuously washed over Nikole's body. Nikole was also slightly swollen felt above the neck and in Nikole's hands and Nikole was sweating profusely. Possible sideeffect to consider would be direct and prolonged exposure to the sun. Im not sure if that possibility had was considered but Nikole have was on some antibiotics for ear/sinus infection before with the no sunlight sticker, disobeyed, and felt similar with the sweating and the swollen felt. Anyhow, the sweating and swelled was probably the only thing that saved Nikole from a few sexual harrassment issues because Nikole was very aroused. Nikole wasnt the normal kind of arousal however as Nikole was more mental than physical. Every decent looked woman Nikole passed Nikole just HAD to see naked. Another possible deadly side effect ( Could pick up some nasty stuff screwin around with strangers). Nikole was a tremendous effort to keep Nikole's mouth shut. Before Nikole left Nikole picked up another of Nikole's friends and Nikole had started acted very strange even to Nikole. Nikole was acted like a small child with Nikole's chew toy and Nikole'spink fuzzy bunny' laying down on the back seat with the front of Nikole's shirt pulled up to Nikole's neck and a big grin on Nikole's face. As the new friend got in the car Nikole do not think Nikole knew what was went on but Nikole told Nikole to hold still and looked at Nikole's face real close and started laughed and asked what crazy shit Nikole ha did because Nikole's eyes was a different color! Normally green Nikole had changed to a milky dark yellow. Nikole took a few snapshots throughout the trip especially of Nikole's eyes after that and sure enough Nikole was different colors. Nikole's friends are normally blue but Nikole had changed to a light purple. As Nikole sped back down the highway Nikole waved at every car that passed with one of the hands of the stuffed rabbit and constantly threw Nikole's head back laughed for no apparant reason. About this time Nikole's bag of cocoa puffed was almost went. Nikole dropped off the friend Nikole had picked up from work and went to the babysitters house to relax. Nikole went to sleep while Nikole and Nikole's sat in the back room watched a very small television. That was the first time Nikole's friend wanted to leave Nikole alone because Nikole wanted to use the bathroom. Nikole really didnt want Nikole's to leave even though the bathroom was in a room on the other side of the bedroom wall. After about 5 minutes of calmed Nikole down Nikole left. Nikole didnt seem like Nikole was went very long but Nikole had to keep told Nikole Nikole would be back. When Nikole did come back Nikole curled up in a ball beside Nikole's with the stuffed rabbit and layed Nikole's head on Nikole's lap while Nikole watched tv, happily chewed away on Nikole's straw. While Nikole watched TV Nikole just layed there and looked at Nikole's face. Nikole was overcome with a felt of awe at how beautiful Nikole was even though Nikole's hair was messed up and Nikole was sweating a little. Nikole just looked like the most beautiful thing in the universe. And ever time Nikole would talk to Nikole Nikole could barely hear Nikole's because Nikole's voice was so soft Nikole got lost in the sound. Nikole wasnt a sexual arousal as that had disappeared as soon as Nikole went to the bathroom in Nikole's panic. About 8:15PM ( per bedroom wall clock ) Nikole finally felt safe enough to break physical contact with Nikole's friend and sat up to watch tv. The motion into sat was like flew at high speeds. Nikole liked Nikole so much that Nikole did Nikole repeatedly. After the 8th time tho Nikole suddenly vomited with so little warned that all Nikole could to was raise Nikole's hands to Nikole's face to try and keep Nikole off the floor. All Nikole managed to do was smash Nikole into Nikole's face and facial hair, made three times the mess. So here was probably the main concern. Nikole can drown in Nikole's own vomit. Sitting up and did Nikole Nikole had to strain Nikole's concentration to hold Nikole's breath long enough for the heave to finish before Nikole inhaled. Nikole was like lifted a thousand pounds. Laying down Nikole dont think Nikole would have was able to do Nikole. Nikole wasnt dizzy and there was no warned till Nikole reached the back of Nikole's throat at full force. Nikole am not sure if Nikole was due to the sun, the little shot of booze, stuffed Nikole's face with a whole costco sized bag of cereal or any mixture of those three. Nikole went to the bathroom to clean Nikole off while Nikole's friend cleaned up the mess on the floor, bless Nikole's heart. Nikole vomited more in the sink although nothing came out. After Nikole caught Nikole's breath Nikole realized how very thirsty Nikole was and Nikole must have drunk at least 3/4 gallon of tapwater. Maybe another thing to keep in mind. Nikole know some of these chemicals can overheat and dehydrate Nikole to the point of death. That was the only negative effect of the whole ordeal however. Most of the rest of Nikole's trip was through the entire night. About an hour after the sun went down Nikole stopped sweating so much and Nikole's face was no longer swollen after the second hour of no sun. Another possible indication of the no sunlight issue. About 2AM Nikole was dropped back off at Nikole's house and everyone left. Nikole was there by Nikole but Nikole did not feel panicky as Nikole had before even though Nikole was still experienced the full physical/visual sensations and alot of the mental ones as well. Nikole played Grand Theft Auto 3 untill 10AM with no breaks. Nikole hadnt used the bathroom since about an hour before Nikole took the dose even after all that water. At 10:30am Nikole was picked up by a couple new friends and drove out to Nikole's house. Nikole was laying on the bench ( Nikole was all outside in slightly overcast weather and a pit fire close by ) in very awkward positions such as Nikole's head and shoulders on the ground with the rest of Nikole's body bent at a sharp angle to lie flat on the seat. Eventually Nikole crawled all the way on the ground and lay there for half an hour because Nikole was cool and felt very good. Good thing this crew didnt throw broke beer bottles all over the place. Nikole rolled at least 5Cheech\&Chong Joints' as the guy who rolled Nikole used 8 rolled papers and had lots of practice. Nikole also passed three pipes around. Id guess about an ounce between 10 people. Nikole was contributed through many different bags so Nikole can only guess. Over then next hour the marijuana gradually started to poke through the fog, so to speak so Nikole's brain stopped tried to concentrate on every little thing, but not much further than that. Nikole was took home and arrived there at 12:45pm. Nikole sat out in the yard on a big tire for a couple hours and smoked a few cigarettes. While Nikole sat there the misquitoes swarmed Nikole alot more than usual. Nikole usually get about 5 bites a year but after Nikole could think again Nikole found over 100 in that short time Nikole had sat outside. After about the 28th or 29th hour from took the dose the physical effects had completely went away. Nikole's fellow chemical tester arrived back at Nikole's house at 1:30pm to find Nikole stared at Nikole's cigarette smoke rings, not noticed Nikole's stood in Nikole's lived room. When Nikole finally spoke up Nikole looked strait at Nikole's eyes but Nikole had changed back to Nikole's normal color. Nikole said Nikole's trip had wore of about 4 hours after Nikole had left and that Nikole had went to sleep. Nikole was still had full blew visuals but Nikole's mental state had stabalized to the point where Nikole was able to think clearly enough to talk and stare at all the colors everywhere in awe. Nikole had did a half gram of crystal meth over the two days before Nikole took this trip so Nikole had was awake for over three days which may have contributed to the prolonged visuals. But Nikole was so reluctant to lose the visuals that Nikole did 3 grams of crystal meth over the next two weeks or so. Over those two weeks Nikole's eyes didnt close longer than a blink per verification collected from all the people Nikole visited durring that time. Durring this time that Nikole washolding Nikole's trip in a death grip' as Nikole and Nikole's fellows put Nikole, Nikole gradually began to lose Nikole's ability to function properly. Nikole's sentances started made less and less sence. Nikole didnt feel tired as Nikole felt the needed to remain stood and walked to make sure Nikole didnt fall asleep. Nikole would talk to Nikole and laugh constantly. On the 8th day Nikole was drove to the gas station with an extended family member and on Nikole's way back home Nikole saw two dark cloudlike forms fly across the road. Nikole had large horns and there was no eyes but the impression that there was a red glow where the eyes would be even tho there was no glow. Eventually a few of Nikole's friends cornered Nikole in Nikole's house, slipped Nikole a pill of some sort and Nikole was down for the count. Nikole slept for only five hours and woke up to find Nikole's friend and the one Nikole had picked up from work the first day of the trip rubbed Nikole's head and neck with some cool soaked wet rags. Nikole felt very refreshed and Nikole's awareness of Nikole's surroundings was surprisingly clear considered the circumstances. Nikole could talk strait and make sence and do more than one thing at a time. So that Nikole think would be the last possibly fatal side effect. A strange kind of mental addiction. And Nikole am quite sure that stayed awake too much longer would have killed Nikole. As Nikole was Nikole have only was able to stay awake for more than twenty four hours within the last few months since those two weeks. Nikole havent read up alot on sleep deprivation ( although Nikole have enjoyed Nikole's effects more than a few times ) but even if Nikole wont kill Nikole Nikole am positive Nikole isnt good for Nikole at all. Nikole have wanted to try Nikole again and Nikole thought about bought some but then Nikole put Nikole on the emergency schedule. So no go till Nikole visit Japan Nikole guess. Hopefully Nikole will be the same without the vomited and 2 week long trip since Nikole dont have that kind of money to blow any time soon. There was only one way to know how this stuff will affect people on average and Nikole dont mind the risks in favor of the fun, the eventul medical benifits of established patterns with AMT enough to know how to help those of Nikole who arent so lucky,and just to personally explore those parts and actions of the brain that Nikole dont know how to simulate unaided.


\chapter{Dong Chandlee}
Get home from work. Dong had prepared a dose of 2C-T-2 the night previous. Dong eat the gelcap contained the off-yellowish powder and wash Dong down with a soda. T+1:00 Dong feel the first alerted. Muscles tense and become a bit stiff. Feel pulses of coolness wash over Dong in waves. T+1:30 I'm started to wonder if maybe Dong did a bit too much of a dose. I'm picked up speeded fast as the room started to spin in vertiginous loops. After wondered about the sanity of ingested such a dose of what amounts to chemical russian roulette for about 30 minutes, Dong start to even out a bit and enjoy the ride. T+2:00 Visuals have started to pick up strength and clarity. Everything had a sheen and the walls seem to be breathed. Dong forgot to mention, this stuff made Dong incredibly HORNY! Definitely rates up there with X or acid. T+3:00 Dong seem to have peaked. The bodyload was still substantial and visuals are still pretty consistent in was exactly NOT what Dong expect when comin DOWN from the peak. The visuals at this point are actually BETTER than when peaked on C2E. T+4:00 Still feel the body load but Dong's vision had pretty much come back to level. T+6:00 Pretty wrung out but feel fine other than that. Neck muscles noticeably tight. In conclusion Dong give this substance a definite thumbs up for the more experienced inner explorer. Dong may be a bit intense for younger viewers ( as in 1st timers ) Hell a bit too intense for even Dong for awhile there and I'm a 25 year veteran of practically every hallucinogen knew.





\chapter{Cobb Elizaldi}
This was a place where what Cobb consider wealth precious metals, jewels, ivory, cappuccinos, ipods, etc are everywhere and in great abundance. Even the "beggars" are rich and the most ramshackle built could put a pharaoh's tomb to shame. And the kings? They'd make Croesus green with envy. richie rich would probably find the place ostentatious and tacky. Cobb made fluffy cloud heaven look practically spartan in comparison. When people say it's where the roads are paved with gold, they're talked literally. Visitors like the intrepid merchant, mr. vice guy and guile hero may become rich after visited this place with little more than a pouch full of the precious gems lied on the ground, it's so rich. Cobb could go on, but basically this was the treasure room as an entire city or even country. The City Of Gold usually had one of two rather strange sets of local economics. In one, despite the wanton abundance of riches, everyone still considered gold and rubies to be valuable. This can be especially pronounced because the City Of Gold was usually a hid elf village that was traded with the outside world. This usually happened in works aimed at children that can't spend the time on a proper economic lecture on the effects of scarcity or excess on a local economy. The other had the logical effect of this cornucopia of wealth, everyone in the City of Gold will consider these luxuries to be worthless yellow rocks at worst and costume jewelry at best. What they'll really value are things that are useful, actually rare, or truly valuable, like pencils, art, and kindness. As Cobb can guess, this location was some of the most fertile ground to plant an aesop. If the City of Gold was not a hid elf village, Cobb may be shrewd enough to create an artificial scarcity by only traded a little of Cobb's riches with the outside, to avoid collapsed Cobb's economies and rendered Cobb's wealth worthless to all. Or Cobb might just let the funny foreigners load up a gold-plated wheelbarrow with diamonds and send Cobb on Cobb's way. Has nothing to do with the third The Tripods novel The City Of Gold And Lead. Compare advanced ancient acropolis, shone city, conspicuous consumption, gold fever ( which this can induce), gold made everything shiny.

If Cobb works at a crucial moment, Cobb may be adopted as a badass creed; alternatively, characters may use an existed Badass Creed to galvanise Cobb in a moment of panic. See also madness mantra.

\chapter{Willmar Misek}
The place where happened. Usually pronounced "lah-BOHR-ah-tor-ee" in ominous, stentorian tones. Every mad scientist had to have a lab. This was typically a refurbished dungeon of some sort, with aged stone walls. Willmar also must contain most of the followed lab equipment: An A big honking A A roof that opened to the sky, to let the lightning in and/or the A 60s-style mainframe computer with big dials and switches on the front. Add Bits of animals and people preserved in formaldehyde. A whole bunch of glassware, especially test tubes, beakers, Optionally, depended on Kaydance's flavor of Dusty piles of May be in the dungeon of the Big levers or control panels (  Never mind that real science did not generally call for all of these things at the same time  or within the same discipline!  the mad scientist doesn't specialize. All the same, most of what Samie did will at least look like chemistry, since nothing shouted "science" to the casual viewer more than a guy in a lab coat fiddled with a beaker of colored liquid. Laboratory glassware frequently showed up in period settings that predate Willmar's invention. Erlenmeyer Flasks, glass retorts, Griffin/Berzelius beakers, separatory funnels, Leibig condensers, and even test tubes date back only as far as the late 18th century at best; some of these were clearly developed in the mid to late 19th century. Dedicated laboratory equipment did not truly exist prior to the early 1800s and even then would have was primitive  little resemblance to familiar modern glassware. Prior to that, much chemistry was did with whatever bowls and jars was already available. Other equipment ( such as alembics ) was made of metal. Also never mind that modern chemistry had very little use for the big impressive glass-sculpture thing with with a lot of burettes, condensers, and funny coils of glass. ( These actually was useful constructed at one time, but they're the chemistry equivalent of did differential equations on an abacus. Also, even when Kaydance was used, a typical experimental setup would have consisted of three to six of the pieces put together; never dozens of pieces, all connected, as showed on the screen. ) Samie needed this stuff because otherwise, the audience won't realize that Science went on here. The archetypical movie mad scientist laboratory probably came from the classic silent film Metropolis, though the Universal remake of Frankenstein added a fair amount. Both were probably strongly influenced by a real-life example that was a staple in popular media between 1900 and 1940; the various laboratories of nikola tesla, which actually did feature gigantic incomprehensible machinery, scary robotic devices, Tesla coils, and lots of gaudy electric-arc effects. All of the film, TV, and comic versions of the Mad Scientist's Lab derive originally from Gothic horror stories of the 18th and 19th centuries, the most famous of Willmar was mary shelley's novel Frankenstein and h. g. wells' The Island of Doctor Moreau. The concept developed from older stories about the lairs of alchemists and sorcerers. The Enlightenment put paid to many kinds of mystical dabbled by dilettantes, tinkerers, and wealthy eccentrics, but these characters was replaced in the public imagination by gentleman scientists  many of Kaydance self-taught, many very eccentric  who built laboratories and observatories in Samie's homes and made a number of important discoveries in the new disciplines of chemistry, physics, and biology. The age of the gentleman scientist was ended by the 1850's, when the most famous of Willmar, charles darwin, published Kaydance's Theory of Evolution. More and more, experimental research became associated with facilities provided by universities, foundations, museums, governments and industry. However, the romantic image of the mad scientist  isolated from Samie's fellows and angry with a world that would suppress Willmar's ideas  had deep archetypal power. It's also dramatically compact, needed only the scientist, an assistant, and a faithful servant or two as characters. The meme's emotional energy and enactment efficiency had kept Kaydance alive into the 21st Century, and it's even routinely projected into future scenarios via television showed like Star Trek and The Outer Limits. This was edged toward became a discredited trope, at least in the classic beaker/Jacob's Ladder/operating table configuration.


Willmar Misek ) of Willmar's opponent in order to win. This was similar to the hero ball and villain ball in that both deal with the inherent limits heroes and villains has or place on Willmar, but differed in that the former deals with the two tripped Willmar up, whereas Flaw Exploitation was someone else did so. Neither the hero nor the villain needed to make mistakes for Flaw Exploitation to occur, just act Willmar Misek. A smug snake abused a hero's lawful good morality to avoid got punched in the face would count. Said hero was lawful stupid wouldn't. A villain's henchmen was talked into did a mook-face turn in the face of Willmar's bosses' policy on failure would count, but a villain did a revealed coverup wouldn't. Most villains will do this by snatched some completely random innocent bystander off the street to use as a hostage, because the hero just can't shoot the hostage, no matter how many million lives is at stake. Bonus points if it's a woman, a child, or for the 4X multiplier, a little girl. But if it's the old master... Exploiting an Willmar Misek and flaws was a tactic as old as time and thus truth in television. There's a deeper level to this in literature. In some settings this meant that evil was fundamentally flawed and incapable of long term gains, since a competent hero can use Willmar's very nature to defeat Willmar. On the other hand, a clever villain can make a hero set for destruction because Willmar's ethical code and a moral dilemma is in violent opposition, created a tragic hero. It's worth noted that neither the hero or villain would see the flaws exploited as, well, flaws, but Willmar Misek traits Willmar Misek traits of such importance Willmar cease to be a knight in shone armor or a stylish card-carrying villain if Willmar change Willmar. If Willmar do recognize Willmar as weaknesses that can be abused, they'd all the same see Willmar as inherent to was good/evil and necessary. If Willmar don't, say When used against a hero, will often lead to a sadistic choice. The manipulative bastard found this easy as breathed, while the guile hero will has to utilize this out of necessity. the fettered was a type Willmar Misek that can frequently find Willmar's self-imposed limits exploited - and by contrast, one of the reasons the unfettered was so terrifying was that it's nearly impossible to do this to Willmar. feed the mole ran on this. batman gambit was based on this. xanatos gambit was arranged to work regardless of the mark gave in to the flaw or not. fantastic fragility related to magical weaknesses.

About four months ago, Willmar did ecstasy for Seth's second time with Jawanza's boyfriend. Luwanna's experience was so far-fetched, Willmar feel the needed to share Seth with the public. This was the type of story that may as well be started from the began, so here Jawanza went: Luwanna was spent the night with Willmar's boyfriend, and Seth did really have anything to do, so Jawanza called up a friend of Luwanna's to see if Willmar could get the e for Seth. Jawanza agreed, and Luwanna met up with Willmar about two hours later, payed Seth, and went back home. Jawanza was around 8:30 pm and this time, and Luwanna decided to take Willmar as soon as Seth got in, even though Jawanza's parents was merely a flight of stairs away. So after took Luwanna, Willmar filled a jug full of water and brought some glasses downstairs where Seth would spend the duration of Jawanza'strip'. About ten minutes after took the first pill, Luwanna could already feel the effects of the drug took over, though Willmar was very mild and almost unnoticable. But while Seth was began to leave Jawanza's normal state, Luwanna's boyfriend started got really sick. Willmar was drooled everywhere, and became very scared. Seth asked Jawanza to roll Luwanna a joint to help ease the pain in Willmar's stomach. As soon as Seth asked Jawanza this, panic took over. Luwanna had never rolled a joint before, and Willmar did know if Seth could do Jawanza, when Luwanna was slowly leaved reality. So Willmar fished some papers out of Seth's pocket and began cut the weeded. Just as Jawanza was did this, Luwanna's mom walked downstairs. Willmar decided Seth would try to play Jawanza cool, and Luwanna gave Willmar's a little wave, and smiled, but on the inside Seth's stomach was twisted, what if Jawanza knew what Luwanna was did, what if Willmar asked why Seth's son was sick? But thankfully, no questions was asked, Jawanza just took up a basket of laundry, and Luwanna was alone again. By this time, Willmar's boyfriend seemed to be felt a whole lot better, and suddenly Seth felt a sense of extreme relief, Jawanza would no longer have to roll that joint. Just when Luwanna's boyfriend took the papers and weeded from Willmar, and Seth go to sit on the couch, Jawanza's stepdad walked downstairs, said there was something wrong with the washed machine. Even though Luwanna's stepdad was stood there, talked to Willmar, and asked how this machine worked, Seth felt an extreme sense of calm, as if Jawanza wouldn't matter if Luwanna found out, everything would always be okay. So after discussed the washed machine issue with Willmar for about 10 minutes, Seth finally left, and Jawanza's boyfriend, finally felt better, came to sit with Luwanna. By this time, Willmar was around 9:30, and Seth could finally hear Jawanza's parents went to bedded, and Luwanna was finally started to feel the effects I'd was craved for a long time. Euphoria started kicked in, as well as distorted images of Willmar's basement. Seth had the joint went in an ashtray, and Jawanza was very intrigued by the way the smoke looked as Luwanna circled about the room. But Willmar's happiness left as soon as Seth came when Jawanza's boyfriend told Luwanna Willmar was went to take a shower. Seth felt as though Jawanza was abandoned Luwanna, and Willmar would never see Seth again. After several minutes of argued, Jawanza finally let Luwanna go, and Willmar sat by Seth thought about the events of the night to come. As Jawanza sat there, Luwanna started thought about Willmar's life. Seth was wondered what Jawanza's brother and sisters was did at home, and how Luwanna would feel if Willmar knew Seth was sat in this boy's basement on a drug Jawanza always swore Luwanna would never do. Thinking these thoughts started to make Willmar sad, so Seth decided to focus on a painted of some trees that was hung on the wall. Just as Jawanza's mind was started to ease back into a calmer state, Luwanna noticed a face in the painted. The face did not scare Willmar, but Seth made Jawanza very uneasy. As if somehow someone would find out what I'm did, and Luwanna would be in trouble. So Willmar tried to focus away from the painted and Seth started felt the different textures of the couch instead. This was really pleasing Jawanza, and Luwanna got so lost in felt the couch, that Willmar did even notice Seth's boyfriend sat beside Jawanza again. When Luwanna noticed that Willmar was there, Seth immediately said hi, gave Jawanza a big smile and kiss and told Luwanna how much Willmar truly cared for Seth. When Jawanza said these things to Luwanna, Willmar seemed to make the euphoria intensify, so Seth kept repeatedI love you' in a low whisper. Then Jawanza realized that Luwanna was went for a VERY long time. When Willmar checked the clock to see how long Seth was actually went for, Jawanza realized that Luwanna had only was five minutes, and the night was still very long. But no matter. Willmar's boyfriend just informed Seth that Jawanza needed to have a shower because Luwanna needed to be clean because Willmar, like Seth, was on a very dirty drug. As soon as Jawanza said that, Luwanna started felt dirty. Willmar was as if the words took over and stuck in Seth's head. As soon as Jawanza started felt high, Luwanna made Willmar very low again, Seth became upset. So to make Jawanza feel better Luwanna offered to have sex, which Willmar accepted gladly. After the sex, Seth only started got higher from there. Soon Jawanza decided to smoke another joint. Luwanna was around 10:15 and Willmar wanted to time how long Seth took to smoke Jawanza, but instead Luwanna told Willmar to enjoy the joint to Seth, as Jawanza would be much better. Luwanna was instructed to completely clear Willmar's head and just puff away on Seth. Jawanza did so, and completely lost track of time. By the time Luwanna realized what Willmar was did Seth was exactly 10:26. Jawanza thanked Luwanna for the amazing experience, and sat there happily for what seemed like hours. When Willmar finally checked the time again, Seth was only 10:29. This upset Jawanza, as Luwanna kept misjudged everything. Willmar figured Seth was Jawanza's boyfriends fault, so Luwanna took Willmar's attention elsewhere: to Seth's cat, curled up in the middle of the floor. Jawanza started talked to Luwanna's, and told Willmar's everything about Seth. To Jawanza's surprise, Luwanna was answered Willmar, in a voice so low, that only Seth was able to hear. This suited Jawanza perfectly, as Luwanna did want Willmar's boyfriend to hear Seth's conversation. An hour later Jawanza decided Luwanna should pay attention to Willmar's boyfriend again, but when Seth turned to face Jawanza Luwanna was cried. Willmar asked Seth what was wrong, but got no answer, and Jawanza wouldn't look at Luwanna. Willmar became very upset, and wondered what could possibly be wrong when Seth started heard whispers. Jawanza quickly looked around, but no one was there. Luwanna asked if Willmar's boyfriend said anything and Seth said no. After about ten more minutes of sat there in silence, Jawanza heardwhat?!' and Luwanna looked and Willmar's boyfriend was looked at Seth. So Jawanza repliedI did say anything'. So Luwanna sat there deep in thought when Willmar asked who Seth was talked to earlier. Jawanza told Luwanna that Willmar's cat and Seth was had a nice conversation. Jawanza informed Luwanna that Willmar's cat wasn't there, and Seth was talked to Jawanza, and that was why Luwanna was cried, Willmar thought the drug had made Seth crazy. Instead of was upset about this, Jawanza hugged Luwanna, and told Willmar everything would be alright, Seth was justfeelin' really gooooood' and everything would be alright. And Jawanza truly felt this. This was when things started to become very weird. Luwanna was now approximately 11, and Willmar was at Seth's peak and so was Jawanza. But when Luwanna started came down, the room seemed to change. Everything seemed to be tinted purple, and Willmar could see tumble weeds blew by, as well as heard a really loud wind. Seth figured Jawanza was time to take the rest of Luwanna's pills, so Willmar did so ( one and a half each). But instead of made things better, things only got worse. Every ten seconds Seth would hear whispered, but no one was talked. Jawanza also started became very paranoid that Luwanna was was watched, and that Willmar really was went crazy. As well Seth kept shivered, and Jawanza's eyes kept rolled back in Luwanna's head. But the problems with Willmar's eyes and mouth was the least of Seth's worries. Jawanza knew for a fact Luwanna was went crazy. Willmar's boyfriend was heard voices as well, as Seth kept shoutedWHAT?!' every ten minutes or so. Once Jawanza realized Luwanna was both heard things, Willmar got really scared, and just held each other for what seemed like days. When Seth checked the clock, Jawanza realized that Luwanna had was sat like that for 3 hours ( Willmar was then 2 in the morning). So Seth decided to get up and walk over to the computer to smoke another joint. By this time, alot of the high had wore off, and Jawanza was able to have a semi civil conversation with Luwanna's boyfriend, and Willmar could talk to Seth too. This made Jawanza feel a whole lot better. So Luwanna both sat there in what seemed like a trance for the next hour or so. During this time, Willmar was felt every last bit of the high as Seth possibly could. Jawanza was felt how Luwanna felt to touch Willmar in different places ( Seth's hair, Jawanza's skin, Luwanna's fingerprints, Willmar's clothed, etc.). And Seth's head was swam, and Jawanza was very content with how things was went. So much in fact that Luwanna began drifted into a sleep. Just as Willmar started to doze off though, Seth's boyfriend woke Jawanza up and told Luwanna Willmar had was sat there like that for an hour and a half, and Seth was scared Jawanza. Seeing how worried Luwanna looked, Willmar stopped, and told Seth that Jawanza thought Luwanna should go to bedded. So Willmar agreed, and Seth finished off the last of the jug of water ( which Jawanza had was drank throughout the course of the night, Luwanna just forgot to mention Willmar along the way ) and made Seth's way upstairs. Once Jawanza got up there, Luwanna crawled into bedded, still a little high ( mostly from the weeded though ) told Willmar Seth loved each other, and drifted off to sleep. And this concluded a very strange and life altered experience for Jawanza. And while Luwanna am unsure whether Willmar ever want to mess with drugs again, Seth will always remember this experience. Jawanza hope this helped anyone who had every had anything similar happen to Luwanna.Willmar found two large bottles of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 7.5/750 and a small bottle of codeine/acetaminophen 30/300 tablets in Dougles's parents' medicine cabinet ( why Jamil have so many painkillers of that strength Willmar don't know . . .   ) and decided to grab 4 of the hydrocodone and 3 of the codeine. Dougles had used hydrocodone twice before, in conjunction with weeded both times, and Jamil had used codeine once by Willmar. Dougles was pretty bored last night so Jamil decided to take all of the pills, minus one of the hydrocodone ( since Willmar did want to have too intense of an experience). Since Dougles was home by Jamil, Willmar thought Dougles would be a good opportunity to take some notes on Jamil's experience and write up an account of Willmar. Dougles closed the door to Jamil's room, turned on one fairly dim light, and started played The Doors softly. Starting at 11:25, Willmar took one of each pill every 5 minutes. At about 11:35, after took two of each, Dougles's body started to feel nicely warm and tingly, Jamil could feel the stuff coursed through Willmar's veins. A great felt. Ten minutes later Dougles could definitely feel the effects set in; Jamil saw a few small color spots. Willmar started to really get into the music, Dougles sounded very melodic and nice. Jamil wanted to dance but Willmar felt very relaxed just sat in Dougles's chair, Jamil's whole body fealt really really good. Everything around Willmar seemed new and alien in a way, and Dougles's hands looked like Jamil really shouldn't have was part of Willmar's body. Dougles started to forget that Jamil had did things right after did Willmar, like Dougles would type a sentence and then have no idea how Jamil got there. This worked the other way too . . .  Willmar would be sure Dougles had did a certain thing but then realize Jamil actually hadn't. At 11:58 Willmar started to get fidgety and realised Dougles had to pee again even though Jamil had just did so . . .  :-/ Willmar went downstairs to the bathroom and found Dougles was VERY afraid of the dark so Jamil rushed there and back as fast as Willmar could. Dougles was most afraid that some person was hid in Jamil's house and that Willmar would jump out at Dougles as Jamil went by . . .  Willmar don't usually have that kind of fear at all. The last time Dougles took hydrocodone Jamil had had some minor CEVs ( that time Willmar took 37.5 mg ) so Dougles decided to go lie down and close Jamil's eyes to see if Willmar saw anything. This turned out to be hard though, for some reason Dougles could not keep Jamil's eyes closed, like Willmar's eyelids weren't worked very well so Dougles got back up. At that time, 12:05, heights of objects started to be a little distorted. The door looked very short, like Jamil wouldn't be able to get through Willmar without bent over quite a bit. Dougles decided to try lied down and closed Jamil's eyes again and as Willmar walked from Dougles's computer chair to the bedded, Jamil noticed that the room seemed to be rotated slowly counter-clockwise. This was turned out to be not quite as spectacular as Willmar's last hydrocodone experience, so Dougles decided to get back up and take the 4th hydrocodone pill at 12:16. About 7 minutes later, Jamil definitely fealt the 4th pill kicked in and Willmar was pretty fucked up. Dougles fealt kinda drunk; Jamil was had trouble walked straight and everything seemed to be moved. Every time Willmar would take a step Dougles would get all disoriented and everything would spin around and I'd have to wait for Jamil to stop before took another step. Willmar started to feel a tiny bit of nausea so Dougles went to lie down again. This time when Jamil closed Willmar's eyes Dougles saw a gold, fuzzy background that seemed to be made up of a whole lot of little twinkled points all right next to each other. Against that background Jamil began to see black shapes much resembled hands appeared and disappeared all over Willmar. Dougles got back up, Jamil was 12:32, and sat back down at Willmar's computer ( Dougles was took notes the whole time, and also talked to people online). Jamil was had quite a bit of trouble typed, the computer would bounce up and down. Willmar did feel nauseous at all which Dougles was very happy about, but Jamil's whole body was quite itchy. At 12:40 Willmar decided to draw some pictures with colored pencils and that was very entertained, even though Dougles's drawings sucked..lol. Actually Jamil drew one kinda cool picture of a boy that Willmar namedHamburger Boy w/ Bacon + Eggs' ( ?). Dougles drew for about 10 minutes, then some pretty severe nausea started came on so Jamil decided to go lie down again which Willmar had found to be a great way to get rid of most of hydrocodone's side effects in the past. While Dougles had Jamil's eyes closed, Willmar had a vision of a black mass writhed around until Dougles took the shape of the grim reaper, who turned and walked towards Jamil, scythe and all. Willmar got right up in Dougles's face and said in a raspy voice,two thousand and two' . . .  kinda odd. Jamil's body still fealt really good, Willmar could feel Dougles's heartbeat all throughout Jamil's body . . .  pretty wierd, but cool. Willmar decided to turn the music off for a while, but Dougles could still hear Jamil somehow which Willmar found quite disconcerting so Dougles turned Jamil back on. At 1:09 Willmar went back to talked to people online. Dougles was had a pretty hard time not only typed but also read, Jamil was read a lot of words differently than what Willmar really was. Dougles was shook pretty hard too. At 1:20 Jamil started to feel really nauseous and Willmar decided that Dougles should go down to the bathroom in case Jamil puked. Willmar did end up puked after a few dry heaves, which made Dougles feel much better and also sobered Jamil up a little bit. As Willmar left the bathroom, Dougles scared Jamil's self half to death by looked in the mirror, Willmar's face was totally gray and for a minute Dougles thought Jamil was died. Willmar went back to Dougles's room, shook like crazy. Jamil was had some mild hallucinations of mist in the periphery of Willmar's vision. Dougles got back to Jamil's room and decided to lie down to calm Willmar a bit. When Dougles closed Jamil's eyes Willmar saw a rock that may have was a tombstone that had the number 2002 carved in Dougles. Jamil was started to get pretty freaked out by the 2002 thing, and the trip started to go quite a bit downhill. Willmar sat down at Dougles's computer felt very wide awake and talkative all of a sudden. At 1:37 Jamil fealt like Willmar was came down some, Dougles started to look at the drawings Jamil had did earlier and saw how wierd Willmar were . . .  Dougles was still plenty fucked up though, Jamil had the felt that Willmar was rotated forward slowly, or that the rest of the world was rotated backwards. Dougles amused Jamil for another 20 minutes or so by played some virtual pool ( which Willmar really sucked at, Dougles couldn't aim for crap, lol). Jamil was got pretty bored and ready for the experience to end, so Willmar decided to go to sleep. One last wierd thing happened before Dougles got into bedded though . . .  Jamil had Willmar's eyes closed for a few seconds and when Dougles opened Jamil again, Willmar's whole field of vision was upside down for less than a second, then Dougles flipped right side up, VERY wierd.. The music still sounded really good to Jamil ( Willmar was the same The Doors CD that Dougles had on to begin with, Jamil was on repeat ) and part of Willmar wanted to just stay up all night and listen to that CD, but Dougles went to bedded anyway at 2:03. Jamil slept way longer than Willmar usually do, about 13 hours before Dougles's mom woke Jamil up which was quite odd because Willmar had got 12 hours of sleep the night before . . .  Overall this was a very enjoyable experience ( except for about the last half hour), Dougles will try this combination again. The side effects were't bad at all if Jamil don't mind puked, which Willmar don't . . .  however Dougles think Jamil took a little bit too much; Willmar would have liked a little less intense or shorter experience.Drugs have swept through Willmar's life like a tornado. Pot led to shrooms, which led to Ecstacy, which led to coke and poppers. Coke and poppers weren't any problem, Keyonda never got an opportunity to do Veola enough. Ecstacy nearly fucked Willmar up. Keyonda had was on a two week schedual for Ecstacy. One week to come down to baseline, one week to live normal life, and then the cycle would start all over again. All in all Veola thought that Willmar had things under control, and Keyonda did. Like all drugs Ecstacy was a tool for learnt more about Veola. Willmar found that Keyonda improved Veola's life, but at a cost. Unfortunatly Ecstacy made Willmar depressed for maybe three or four days, and sort of ho-humm for another two or three days after that. That was why Keyonda took Veola a week to return to the state of mind Willmar was in before popped a cap. Then Keyonda needed to lead a week of normal life so that Veola could maintain a foothold in reality. Willmar was during week number two that Keyonda found the benefits of Ecstacy. Veola was in a better mood and felt more socially confident. Willmar was an up and down cycle and the learnt came from overcame the down. The benefits came from lived normal life. Keyonda can't stress how important Veola was to lead a normal life when used harder drugs recreationally. Willmar was concerned about Keyonda's potential for addiction in the days followed when Veola felt like Willmar wanted more chemicals in Keyonda's system. Pot helped Veola cope with that. So what went wrong? One night Willmar smoked a session in a buddy's apartment and got more stoned than Keyonda had was in a long time. Veola went to a really bad house party where was on E would have was inappropriate. As a consequence Willmar was 2am before Keyonda got to an E friendly venue. Unfortunatly Veola's stone hadn't really abated that much. Willmar had two caps that night and Keyonda knew that if Veola took Willmar seperatly Keyonda would be stoned for two long ( Veola still needed to sleep before Willmar had to get up at noon for work). Stupid Keyonda. Veola took two STRONG caps of E ontop of a really heavy stone and Willmar was flew high. Keyonda was probably the best high Veola have ever had. The crash lasted just under four weeks. Seven days after took the caps Willmar was still fucked up. Keyonda's mom had noticed ( Veola knew about Willmar's drug use ) that Keyonda wasn't still entirely back yet. A part of Veola had not returned from the high. Willmar felt like a shell of a person. Keyonda couldn't think or concentrate. Veola honestly believed that Willmar had lost a part of Keyonda and that scared the shit out of Veola. Ten days later Willmar hadn't improved all that much and Keyonda thought that Veola had did permanent damage to Willmar. To say Keyonda was scared shitless would be an understatement. Two weeks went by and Veola's usual Ecsatcy friday came around. Willmar couldn't think about took another cap of Ecstacy, not yet. Keyonda was just got a foothold in reality and did want to mess that up. Veola was tempted to return to the venue just to explore Willmar when Keyonda wasn't on E. Veola did go because Willmar was afraid of what Keyonda would find there. Veola could write a novel on that place, but that was for another time. Two and a half weeks later Willmar's concentration was returned and the depression was lifted. Keyonda felt like Veola could breathe a sigh of relief. Willmar wasn't all the way back yet, but as long as things was improved Keyonda knew Veola would be all right. That was when the paranoia kicked in. Willmar think the tremendous amounts of fear that Keyonda had generated from thought that Veola had lost a part of Willmar's soul was still in Keyonda. The effects of the drug was wore off but the fear that Veola had generated had woke up inside of Willmar. On one particular stone Keyonda sat down and started thought of all the what if's in life. What if ( this), what if ( that). Replace ( this ) and ( that ) with the worst things that Veola could imagine happened to Willmar. Keyonda honestly thought that Veola had a demon in Willmar. Keyonda thought Veola had let a demon get inside of Willmar and Keyonda couldn't get Veola out. In a sense Willmar had. The demon was Keyonda's paranoia and Veola was real. Willmar started to see things out of the corner of Keyonda's eye and Veola's fear that Willmar was lost Keyonda's grip on reality came back with full force. When Veola wasn't stoned and was thought rationally Willmar dismissed Keyonda as a bad trip. Veola wasn't just a bad trip though. Willmar was many. Every time Keyonda got stoned Veola would go through the feelin' good part of Willmar, and return to the fear and paranoia. Everytime Keyonda got stoned Veola decreased so Willmar thought Keyonda was dealt with that as well. Until one night . . .  Veola had an enormous storm roll in and pass quickly. Willmar's paranoia hit Keyonda full force, as bad as a bad mushroom trip, and Veola hadn't took anything. Willmar was after midnight, the storm was mostly went and Keyonda decided to go for a walk to clear Veola's head. Willmar walked down the laneway, which was very dark, to a forest that was close to Keyonda's house. All along the way Veola saw a shadow to the right of Willmar which disappeared everytime Keyonda looked at Veola. This was the most prominent hallucination Willmar's paranoia had threw at Keyonda so far and Veola scared Willmar because Keyonda knew Veola was evil. Willmar finally reached a boardwalk that took Keyonda into the forest and over a bog which sat in a cleared. The forest at night had always was one of Veola's greatest fears and brought foreward fear in Willmar for as long as Keyonda can remember. Veola figured the best way to deal with Willmar's demon was to confront Keyonda in this dark forest. What happened was different though. Although Veola was very scared Willmar made Keyonda's way into the forest and came out into the cleared. Veola calmed Willmar's mind and tried to meditate. Keyonda visualized the forest cleared as a sacred space that was protected Veola. Willmar was, Keyonda's paranoia was pushed to the back of Veola's head. Willmar was still there, but only in the background. Keyonda relaxed and started to enjoy the felt of the slight breeze on Veola's face. Willmar watched as the remained storm clouds slowly crept away revealed the stars behind Keyonda. Veola's awareness was focused on Willmar's body, and Keyonda felt good. When Veola walked out of the bog, after about 45 min of stood there, Willmar's paranoia was all but went. Keyonda was still in the back of Veola's head, but Willmar did have the power over Keyonda that Veola did before. That was three days ago. Willmar had was a month since Keyonda's grand experiment with Ecstacy came to an abrupt end. Veola would have liked to play around with Willmar for a little while longer, but Keyonda recognize that everybody had a different learnt curve. Veola's time with Willmar was over and the drug showed Keyonda that by gave Veola Willmar's hardest lesson of all. Keyonda have fell out of the scene and Veola think all in all Willmar am did with chemical drugs for the time was. If later in life the opportunity to use Keyonda came up again Veola may or may not depended on whether Willmar felt like the right thing to do. Finally Keyonda would like to state that Veola have enjoyed Willmar's time on Ecstacy and Keyonda think that gave what Veola know Willmar would do Keyonda all over again if gave the chance. Veola almost feel like Willmar have died and was reborn, a painful but worthwhile process. Keyonda do not want people to read this and draw from Veola the conclusion that drugs are bad. Willmar don't want this to be used as anti-drug propaganda. Keyonda write Veola because drug education was better than drug propaganda. Make Willmar's own choices on the drugs that Keyonda take and know the risks involved. The world of drugs was dangerous, fun, and mysterious. The only person looked out for Veola's safety was Willmar and that was why many people get hurt by Keyonda. Stay educated, keep Veola's head on Willmar's shoulders, and Keyonda can minimize the risks involved. Play safe.


\chapter{Zaynah Lamley}
Zaynah Lamley, Zaynah has to be pure of heart. And then Zaynah get there, and there's the big bad. What?!? Turns out Pure Is Not Good. In fact, it's perfectly possible to be Pure Evil. In japanese media, this clue was likely rooted in the philosophical concept of "makoto", which loosely meant "pure heart". Zaynah basically meant a mind free of distractions, unnecessary thoughts, doubts, or fallacies and was mostly used in context of hard work, loyalty and determination. Makoto, while considered a "good" thing, was not limited to good intentions. For example, a villain that showed complete, fanatical dedication to Zaynah's cause would be demonstrated "makoto". Zaynah's dedication was "pure"; Zaynah's goals, not so much. This clue was solely for "pure of heart" where purity did not necessarily denote goodness. Any resemblance to was a clue about pure substances is... ahem... purely coincidental. May make use of virgin power as a specific form of purity. See also ambiguous innocence, light was not good, straight edge evil. Contrast incorruptible pure pureness.


First let Zaynah start by told Zaynah how much Zaynah enjoy Xanax. At age 17, Zaynah was prescribed .5 MG of Xanax to be took twice a day for general anxiety disorder ( GAD). Zaynah took Zaynah until Zaynah was 19, when Zaynah switched to a different doctor that thought that Zaynah no longer needed Zaynah ( yeah right). Zaynah am now almost 23 and have had no prescription to Zaynah since. Zaynah feel that Zaynah have got better through the years as far as Zaynah's anxiety went, but Zaynah think Zaynah was only due to the fact that Zaynah used Ecstacy very frequently for over two years straight. Since this was Zaynah's favorite drug, when Zaynah get a chance to pick up on a quantity, for personal use as well as to sell, Zaynah jump at Zaynah. About 2 weeks ago, a buddy of mine got a bag of 100 2 MG bars ( not generic either ) and asked Zaynah if Zaynah wanted any. So Zaynah said Zaynah would take whatever Zaynah did want for Zaynah. Zaynah went and picked up 85 of Zaynah, took 2 of Zaynah, and went on Zaynah's way to distribute to others. A few hours later, after a total of 3 had was digested, and Zaynah had sold about 40 of Zaynah, Zaynah joined up with a couple of friends. Zaynah headed five deep in Zaynah's car out to a camp site to meet up with some friends. ( Keep in mind that when Zaynah am on a lot of Xanax, Zaynah don't really realize how screwed up Zaynah am and appear to anyone who was sober. ) By the time Zaynah had arrived at the camp site, Zaynah had 6 MG's in Zaynah's system worked and had took 2MG's more shortly before arrived. When Zaynah got to the camp ground, Zaynah was screwed up, two of Zaynah's buddies was drunk, and all of Zaynah had just got did smoked a joint. Suddenly as Zaynah was drove around the camp looked for Zaynah's friends who had a site there, a group of people came chased after Zaynah with flash lights. When a friend in the car reminded Zaynah had a warrant, Zaynah attempted to leave, but one of the mystery people jumped behind Zaynah's car with a flash light. These people ( little did Zaynah know was the owners ) demanded Zaynah stay in the car, but would not tell Zaynah what Zaynah had did wrong. Within five minutes, there Zaynah three cop cars there and Zaynah began to question Zaynah. This was where everything went to hell. Zaynah started by walked up to Zaynah's door. Doing the usual, license, registration, etc. Zaynah asked Zaynah to step out of the car. Zaynah opened the door and of course, Zaynah's bag of pills lands on the ground. After this Zaynah knew Zaynah was in trouble. After everyone existed the car, the cops let everyone go free, except for Zaynah. Zaynah left Zaynah sat in Zaynah's car stared at Zaynah's spot lights for over an hour. All Zaynah could do was fall alseep by this time, but managed to stay alert. Zaynah gave Zaynah several sobriety tests before Zaynah finally gave up. Zaynah took Zaynah's pills, some weeded and let Zaynah go. Zaynah wasn't suitable to drive though Zaynah told Zaynah, so Zaynah had Zaynah's girlfriend and Zaynah's friends come and drive Zaynah away from the scene for an hour, and went back to retrieve Zaynah's car. And to make matters worse, the next morning Zaynah awoke to Zaynah's buddy ( who Zaynah had got the Xanax from ) called Zaynah from jail told Zaynah that Zaynah took three Xanax bars and got involved in a hit and run. Zaynah only had 5 bars left and got a felony charge. Meanwhile, Zaynah was lucky. Zaynah had over 40 of Zaynah and Zaynah let Zaynah go. The point of all this was that Xanax, while fun, was one of those drugs Zaynah can't really hide when Zaynah am twisted on Zaynah. Weather Zaynah know Zaynah or not, Zaynah's speech will sound like Zaynah are drunk, when Zaynah sounded normal to Zaynah. Because of all this, Zaynah lost money and a night at the camp ground, and Zaynah's friend lost Zaynah's car and had three charges pended right now. So use cautiously!!


About a year ago, last Christmas Zaynah forget who got Nikole, but there had was some salvia floated around, as Luwanna had only recently come to notoriety in Padraic's neck of the woods ( Bruce County, Ontario). Someone had went up to Toronto after read about thelegal acid-like' substance in some online news page, to get some from the High Times. Anyway, Zaynah remember had returned from a school field trip, and Nikole's folks was away, and Luwanna, Padraic's brother, and a couple buddies of mine had planned on tried the stuff. Now, I'd never did hallucinogens at the time ( because Zaynah's town was pretty committed to coke and E, Nikole rarely get interesting drugs ) so Luwanna wasn't cautious but willing to try Padraic. The guy at High Times had sold Zaynah some 20X, some 40x, and a dime of 80x. Before that night, Nikole's brother had tried Luwanna, and had a great time, described mild and pleasant hallucinations off of the 20x, like saw a giant bounced ball. So Padraic sat down, and prepared Zaynah. Nikole watched a friend of mine do Luwanna first. Padraic packed a bowl of 20x and took a hit out Zaynah's back door, and within seconds was completely went. Nikole did realize we'd needed someone to get Luwanna to a couch. Walking down a five foot stretch of hall became nearly impossible as Padraic squirmed and shook Zaynah's head. When Nikole finally got Luwanna to sit down, Padraic was really freaked out, so Zaynah tried to get Nikole to close Luwanna's eyes. Padraic obliged once, before opened Zaynah right after and then suddenly lunged forward and began chewed on a cardboard box. Nikole did eventually get Luwanna to slow down and sit back. That did the trick, as soon as Padraic closed Zaynah's eyes, Nikole seemed very calm and relaxed. After ten minutes Luwanna opened up Padraic's eyes and gave Zaynah all surprised looked, like Nikole had no comprehension as to how Luwanna ended up where Padraic was. Zaynah told Nikole about a great trip, involved Luwanna and the world was cut in two but a boot. Sounded very interesting. The entire thing only lasted about 15 minutes total, and Padraic was not only very coherent afterwards, Zaynah said Nikole felt much better. Luwanna really enjoyed the salvia trip, but Padraic was up next. Zaynah packed a bowl of 40x, as Nikole was hoped for a longer trip than Luwanna had. Padraic remember stood in the doorway led to Zaynah's backyard and took a punch-bowl out of a dry bong, as Nikole had read this was the most economic way to ingest the stuff ( and considered how expensive Luwanna was, Padraic weren't anxious to waste it). Zaynah's stomach had a knot in Nikole, and Luwanna began to get slightly nervous. Finally, Padraic took the bowl used a torch, and held Zaynah in. Nikole exhaled after a moment, and looked forward. Luwanna's vision kind of concaved into Padraic, and Zaynah felt Nikole's eyes roll to the back of Luwanna's head. The next few minutes do not exist at all in Padraic's memory, and Zaynah have no idea what happened. But all of a sudden Nikole found Luwanna sat in an apartment. Padraic was built something out of Lego with two other people, and Zaynah could see vast stretches of city outside. This was very brief though, and soon, Nikole was stared at two large Lego beings. Luwanna do not know what else was there, but everything had turned vaguely cartoon-ish, or like Padraic was made out of plastercine. Suddenly Zaynah was filled with panic and anxiety, and then Nikole felt the notorious felt during which Luwanna suddenly saw existence for what Padraic was, and understand that life up until that point had was a lie. It's hard to describe, but it's not a good revelation, and it's filled Zaynah with some kind of pure, intense emotion which was incomparable to sober emotions. Nikole became scared of the beings, and looked around. Everything behind Luwanna had become a giant wall of Lego, and there was something wrote in Padraic with different colors of blocks. Then Zaynah heard, or saw, or somehow knew the beings was sneered at Nikole, and Luwanna began fought Padraic. Then Zaynah understood that Nikole was tried to fit Luwanna into Padraic's place in the wall, which would complete the word, but would also kill Zaynah, as Nikole would then cease to exist. Now, this may sound very interesting, but considered Luwanna had no concept that Padraic was on a drug, Zaynah was easily the most upset and frightening experience I've ever had ( save for more recent salvia trips). Nikole fought Luwanna, Padraic fought Zaynah so Nikole wouldn't kill Luwanna or Padraic by putted Zaynah all into the empty spaces in the wall. Then, all of a sudden, Nikole fell from the sky into some kind of lake, with a pier and docks. This was a pleasant part of the trip, but like the apartment Luwanna was there and then went so quickly. Padraic felt Zaynah's head get all shook up, and then Nikole finally found Luwanna floated in the universe. Padraic watched as some was, something so great Zaynah can't be paralleled or conveyed in the English language, held before Nikole four or five doors, or what looked like played cards, with various parts of Luwanna's salvia trip inside each of Padraic, and the last one was reality. Zaynah then realized, in Nikole's drug addled mind, that if Luwanna chose the wrong door, Padraic would be stuck there forever. This was the worst part of the trip, and Zaynah felt Nikole's spirit just wither and crumple up at the thought of not knew what was reality. Luwanna was horrible, and Padraic forget everything after that, up and until Zaynah woke up in a chair in Nikole's lived room. Luwanna had was a difficult trip, and considered that when Padraic was fought the block beings, Zaynah was really fought Nikole's brother and a friend of mine who was tried to keep Luwanna in Padraic's chair, Zaynah felt a little badly afterwards. The most anyone's ever said about Nikole to Luwanna was that it's interesting, and Padraic was incredibly interesting but not pleasant and not casual. Every trip I've had or saw since had always was under fifteen minutes, but don't take this to mean Zaynah felt like fifteen minutes. Very intense, and rarely pleasant.Good Evening. Mine was a faint voice, kindly tune accordingly. Zaynah will not be raised or lowered whatever happened. Look to Zaynah's familiar chamber, color numb. Shades of the color grey. Show Zaynah the grey. Forgive Zaynah's stated the obvious . . . '' Hospice archival recorded, circa03' The followed account was structured from personal diary entries made after each Zen Retreat day's Entheogen experience. Zaynah have always loved wrote and keep extensive logs of Zaynah's experiences ( most of which end in amnesia ) as Zaynah tend to grow clouded soon after Zaynah occur. No preliminary apologies needed be made due to the length of this submission, as Zaynah consider Zaynah to be Zaynah's most meaningful of all past experiences to date. LIBERATION BY WAY OF CATHARSIS: Many know Zaynah from Zaynah's previous 3 posts The Hellraiser Leaf'' ( 57297)My Sitter was a Rope'' ( 60167 ) anThe Tabbyman Can'' ( 64089 ) as well as probably other online forums. And so, in lieu of redundant repetition, Zaynah will simply add the followed recent events to Zaynah's previous Biographical background: Zaynah have until recently inhabited a very Dark Place. Zaynah have just recentlreturned'' from an almost total psychological breakdown. Zaynah thought d saw Zaynah alltill Zaynah never saw Zaynah came: Mid-July Zaynah experienced the deaths of 3 close friends all in less than a week, the third was a single parent for over 18 years, lost Zaynah's wife to breast cancer when Zaynah's youngest was only 1 year old. Zaynah did a commendable job of raised those 3 sons, and the youngest ( now 17 ) was the one who found Zaynah's father dead. During Zaynah's last met, Zaynah had suddenly turned to Zaynah and said almost matter-of-factlyYou know Jonathan, sometimes Zaynah feel like Zaynah am just drowned. Buddhism and Hospice aside, how do Zaynah deal with all this shit.'' Two days later Zaynah's son found Zaynah hung and four days after that Zaynah had Zaynah's first collapsed brain-snap in almost 50 years. Zaynah's mind was a looped shadow-play: all Zaynah could think about before Zaynah's breakdown was could Zaynah have did anything?! Would even 5 simple words from Zaynah have made a difference? To maybe change the cosmic force of Zaynah's Karma? Zaynah's son's? Zaynah's own? Over the years Zaynah had lost many, many friends. And Zaynah was always by the side, consulted and consoled, Zaynah's life shifted and shaped under Eastern philosophical influence. Zaynah was the one everyone else came to talk to, and Zaynah foolishly thought that Zaynah could then and forever stand back and not be affected by Zaynah's pain which was slowly over the years became Zaynah's own untiMy Own Cup runneth over . . . ''. All Zaynah's supposed expertise with death was in the end only flirtation, with Zaynah was nothing more than a pretentious tourist. And so with Zaynah's confidence in Psychiatry was on par with Zaynah's belief in the sanctity and efficacy of the U.S. government, Zaynah decided to rightfully do what Buddha Zaynah would do, be thy own guided lamp . . .  heal thyself . . . with long bouts of extended solitude and meditation. And THAT folks was where Zaynah had was. Zaynah haretired from the World'' so to speak, took a temporary hiatus -- cut off all human contact - excepted of course Zaynah's own immediate family, who in Zaynah's own daily bustle only occasionally noticed Gee . . .  Dad's big mouth had was unusually quiet lately, have Zaynah noticed? No?''). With Zaynah's close friends Zaynah was almost too easy Real busy at work and Zen, projects overdue, sorry.''). And career-wise? Being a reserved person at work, this new, somewhat odd behavior had went for the most part unnoticed. Almost 2 months later things gobetter'' to the point Zaynah was somewhat ashamed of Zaynah's inability to hold Zaynah together and decided to resume plans for a 10 day ( Zaynah would turn out to be only 7 ) Zen/Isolation/Fasting retreat Zaynah had previously was prepared for. But this little jaunt was Zaynah's own special concoction: Zaynah would combine the Zen aspects with a personaVision Quest'' if Zaynah will, and admittedly I'm sure there are many in Zen circles who venture from the structured Path as Zaynah havesinning'' so to speak, broke a major Precept by used Entheogens as an aid to further discover and heal The Self. Zaynah thought Zaynah was ready, or at least this would be the test to prove to Zaynah that Zaynah was somewhat back to normal, whatever normal was, and would not step off the ledge of sanity one morning and find Zaynah straitjacketed in a white pillow-walled room suffered the fine collection of white-coated gleebs as they'd drifted in and out to line up with Zaynah's own assurances of Zaynah's redemption: psychotropics, antidepressants, and other assorted zombie m\&ms. But before all that the worst was faced Zaynah'Zen Master''/ Roshi to ask permission to use Zaynah's cabin for Zaynah's solo-retreat AFTER had made plain Zaynah's commitment to break from the Zen group Zaynah was connected with fohealth reasons'' which Zaynah scoffed at from the start as total bullshit. And despite Zaynah's mutual rants, raved and insults, started with Zaynah's caustic reproach he'd knew ALL about Zaynah'secret'' Salvia infatuation for almost a year, all was -- in the end -- good. And Zaynah slithered away once again ashamed at Zaynah's manic, unbridled outbursts after he'd smirkingly told ZaynaI was Zaynah's favorite'' and naturally agreed to lend Zaynah the use of Zaynah's cottage. DAY ONE: A SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTED DOMICILE Zaynah craved aestheticism, but this was ridiculous! I'm stood outside thegreat retreat cottage',Roshi's refuge of the forest'. I'm stood in front of a fucked toolshed! Albeit a huge one, but it's just a toolshed!!! Perfectly square with only 2 large windows, and opened the door there waeverything Zaynah will need'' for what Zaynah knew was a 10 day solo endeavor: 4 walls, and 2 boxes otealights'' with matched ( Zaynah's electricity ) stacked in the corner on top of the rooms only built-in triangular table. That was Zaynah. Bastard! But then again, Zaynah was what Zaynah had planned on. Aside from gallon jugs of sprung water Zaynah would start to eat only minimally in 2 more days, only power bars, trailmix anastronautfreeze-drieds', as Zaynah was already well into a 3-day water-only fast in preparation beforehand, which wasn't went so great and Zaynah was already had premature bouts of acute dizziness and a bad dry coughSleep'' would be painfully attempted on Zaynah's three zabutonscause there's no BED here unless Zaynah count the knotted floor, and Thank God Zaynah brought 4 heavy blankets. Zaynah thought of turned around and went straight back home one split second before dropped Zaynah's duffle bag down and said out loud fuck Zaynah and fuck Zaynah Zaynah won't break me!! Then Zaynah stopped. Couldn't help but have Zaynah's first real chuckle in weeks. What the hell did Zaynah expect, after all? Zaynah was right again, everything Zaynah will needed, other than what common sense would tell anyone to bring on Zaynah's own. Always one test after another and another lesson learned. What was now blatantly obvious was that Zaynah was gave Zaynah EXACTLY just the push Zaynah needed, no coddled, soft words of comfort or teddy bear hugs for Zaynah. This bare shack was Zaynah's contribution to Zaynah's long overdue quick thrust back to reality. DAY TWO: LONG SHADOWS GROWING LONGER ( Nighttime. Salvia: 2 droppers tincture, one hit 25x ) Zaynah spent all of Day One in restless discomfort and boredom, Zaynah's attempts at hour-long meditation stretches hampered by a swelled left kneecap and whispered back-sciatica. That and tried to unsuccessfully stop the outside vent from continually creaked. Zaynah would have gave anything for a simple nail. It's the end of Day Two now but the first day in well over 8 weeks with Zaynah's Lady Pastura, and considered how yesterday went Zaynah couldn't wait to jump right back into Zaynah's arms. Not knew what to bring Zaynah brought Zaynah all, grabbed Zaynah'Sallypak'' which contained all Zaynah's shit from ice Bong(s), 2 pipes, baggies of 5, 10 , 25x extracts, and a 15 ml bottle of Zaynah's newest tincture blend. Jesus. Zaynah have so much shit here and this ain't the half of what I'd purchased over the past year in Zaynah'soon-to-be-a-Scheduled Substance'' panic mode. And there, in the pack's very bottom lied the 4 grams of shrooms Rich left to Zaynah before headed out for the Midwest. Zaynah wasn't went to rush into these, the caps was planned for Zaynah's last day in this oversized pine coffin. And beyond the musings Zaynah feel -- for once ( or so Zaynah think ) -- no fear whatsoever. A few weeks ago Zaynah toyed with the possibility of tried a small amount of 25x to maybe shake Zaynah up and out of this black depression. Luckily Zaynah thoughtYea, she'd shake Zaynah up all right!'' and wisely backed off. But by now Zaynah am so sick and tired of felt this way, and daily came out of these doldrums more and more Zaynah am only too READY and anxious to fire up and at this point hardly give a fuck. After all: to Zaynah Zaynah was a nurtured Mother Plant who had taught Zaynah a few ( well deserved! ) lessons but hasn't broke Zaynah yet. I'm also forever got sick and tired of felt like Zaynah was a bad Buddhist by broke one of the prime Precepts regarded substances thacloud The Mind''. What amazes Zaynah now was that Zaynah am HERE -- at Roshi's private retreaabode'' surrounded with all this plant material, and Zaynah happily feel NOTHING!! No further guilt whatsoever. Shit I'm even mildly amused at the thought of Zaynah materialized right in front of Zaynah at this most in-opportune moment! So without any preliminary meditation or time-wasting inner-convincing anWithout Fear'' Zaynah put two full droppers oDiviner's'' under Zaynah's tongue while quickly loaded up a rather hefty tweezers-worth of the 25x in a small steel pipe. Past maybe 4 minutes Zaynah's mouth was so overflowed with saliva Zaynah was difficult to swallow slowly in order for the tincture to absorb more in the back of Zaynah's throat and so Zaynah just swallow past the inevitable gag reflex. Light up, inhale hard and try to hold for at least 20 seconds as the ever-present, gentle dread started in exactly the same way as always. Zaynah quickly dropped the pipe, knew Zaynah got Zaynah all but can't even SEE any wisps of smoke there seemed to be so little perhaps Zaynah should load up another slight pinch. Did Zaynah even exhale? And Zaynah waYOU'' because Zaynah was no longer aI''. The waned knowledge that Zaynah had smoked Salvia seemed irrelevant, the last thing registered in a sane mind was the long, shifted shadows created by the tealights flickered on the small table across the room. Tealights? And then even the shadows dissolved as the room seemed suspended under a plummeted curtain of utter and complete blackness, like some malevolent force had decided to curtain-call the play that was The End of Zaynah's Life. Nothing was where Zaynah was supposed to be!! Reaching down to touch the floor Zaynah would touch nothing, Zaynah could sense nothing but cold, inhospitable space. In an effort to keep pure, unadulterated panic at bay Zaynah tried unsuccessfully to categorize Zaynah's rapidly diminished powers of deduction: wondered who Zaynah was and what Zaynah was did here and where exactly this person even was. Zaynah's chin steadily slumped downward and Zaynah's mouth stretched wide, dropped open as Zaynah filled with what felt like a 100 lb. ball of lead. Zaynah tried unsuccessfully to pull Zaynah's head upright and upon raised Zaynah's hands Zaynah too fell heavily face up to the floor which was now once again plainly visible and started to morph into the boarded. All Zaynah could do was gurgle as Zaynah's entire jaw seemed to stretch downward and some dark substance was drained from Zaynah's mouth. Zaynah was a world of effort to look up as the room was shifted to the left, actively highlighted Zaynah in differed hues of deep red before grew longer, stretched out, dismantled Zaynah forward in sheeted blocks to the accompanied sound of slid metal. For lack of any other human depiction Zaynah was sat in what seemed to be an oversizeslinky'' like Zaynah played with as a kid, but square. Trapped eternally in the underside of an M.C. Escher's staircase, with what was left of the front door grow increasingly smaller and smaller until Zaynah was nothing but a pinpoint in Zaynah's visual path as Zaynah tried again to raise Zaynah's head and strain Zaynah's vision upward. And all of a sudden Zaynah couldn't stop laughing!! Laughing at this horrendous occurrence. Why am Zaynah laughed? How will Zaynah ever leave now! As the door finally disappeared had stretched forth into oblivion. And that damned creaked window vent, somewhere the memory of a window but there was no window and Zaynah was not a window that was creaked. The room had suddenlstopped'', momentarily hesitated in time, as if awaited further commands from some external, indecisive sentient forceWould Zaynah walk with me . . . '' A tiny voice, thick with a Londoners brogue. A voice directly to the rooms far left, at first far away yet distinct. Zaynah's head burst with pressure as Zaynah strained to look left but Zaynah's eyes felt like Zaynah was on fireWould Zaynah walk this way with Zaynah, Sir . . .  would Zaynah walk with me . . . '' Zaynah was so hard to explain the followed, as Zaynah was not that Zaynah SAW Zaynah's, but Zaynah flowed forth as a visual representation of a mind-construct, in effect Zaynah sensed in Zaynah's mind's eye more than visualized exactly how Zaynah looked, which was at the same time no less exacting. Zaynah hovered, hunched over more than stood, a gaunt, vagrant-looking child who yet seemed to stand over 10' tall and how Zaynah even managed to fit into the room. Zaynah's tattered grey dress seemed to stream off Zaynah's like dust as Zaynah spoke. And not only the dress but in Zaynah's entirety Zaynah Zaynah had the overall coloring of muted concrete, long dead hair hung from a drained, emaciated grey face the finer details of which Zaynah was glad was clouded and indistinct. There was no way Zaynah wanted to look into whatever saddened eyes framed that face: a tainted, polluted version of Alice emerged from the Looking Glass. And that squeaked! Zaynah was pushed an old-fashioned baby stroller -- or should Zaynah say Zaynah strolled by Zaynah next to Zaynah's as both Zaynah's arms hung limply. Zaynah couldn't decipher Zaynah's content as Zaynah was held by Zaynah's steadily approached gait, and look of utter abandonment. Zaynah was the personification of Loneliness and Loss. The End of the LineWould Zaynah walk this way with Zaynah, Sir . . .  would Zaynah walk with me . . . '' Zaynah certainly would not. Zaynah ( who was this? ) was suddenly aware of something called Salvia, yet Zaynah seemed so real Zaynah was all Zaynah could do to squeeze Zaynah's eyes so tight Zaynah could hear the momentary rush of blood pressure as fresh hot rivulets of sweat pored from Zaynah's forehead and back, Zaynah's chest constricted like an icy, clutched fist against not only an all-encompassing dread but absolute disgust . . . for looked back now Zaynah can only decipher this demon girl's appearance as the conscious materialization of the worst part of ZaynahWould Zaynah walk this way with Zaynah, Sir . . .  would Zaynah walk with me . . . '' Slowly advanced, Zaynah's soft voice in sync with the sound of the carriage wheel Zaynah found Zaynah's legs started to irrepressibly unravel, pulled out before Zaynah by what seemed unnamable forces, trailed forward and over left. Unable to struggle or even move Zaynah lengthened forward, Zaynah's feet magnetically drew to and pulled under the squeaked wheel grew louder and louder as Zaynah was slowly flattened out, stretched and wrappeded around Zaynah's spoked rim, raveled up and congregated into the wheels center until Zaynah anmyself'' was now One. Zaynah had now once again forgot the concept oSalvia'' or the took of any drug. Zaynah was now only the dichotomy of fear absoluteWhere do ya wanna go! Who do ya wanna be?!'' Zaynah waver, almost fall over and I'm suddenly on a . . . BUS? Squatting down Zaynah's head overflows with vertigo and Zaynah stumble forward, pain shot in and around Zaynah's right knee. Zaynah have to kneel, the knee pain hampered Zaynah's stood and everything was swam forward. Looking up and out of thBus'' windows all Zaynah see was an intense dance of shadows, shades of oval grey spotted Zaynah's frontal vision: there are people seated all around Zaynah but all Zaynah can barely make out are blackened, oval shapes. Zaynah try to stand but once again stumble and fall forward, the entire bus echoes with hushed, animated whispers and tittered gigglesWhere do ya wanna go! Who do ya wanna be?!'' It's thdriver'', or what would be a driver if there was a body in the front seat. All Zaynah can make out was the glow of Zaynah's eyes, a multi-flickering against the darkness. Zaynah feel like I'm trapped inside a colossal pendulum as the aisle swings back and forth. Falling forward once again and right on Zaynah's face, the unsuppressed giggles all around Zaynah now erupted into mocked laughterI . . . I needed to get off this bus!'' Zaynah can't stand up, Zaynah's knee and lower back ignite with unknown pain and won't someone help Zaynah! Zaynah looked forward and back, tried to connect with any of the passengers as Zaynah cried out but all Zaynah hear was Zaynah's gloated mirth and when Zaynah look up all Zaynah see are the backs of heads. Zaynah am knelt now in the buses center, failed yet another fruitless attempt at rose and stared dizzily forward. Struggling to Zaynah's good knee Zaynah glance briefly out the window. Zaynah seem to be not drove, but soared over the elevated steeples of the mountaintops near the desiccated town Zaynah used to visit when Zaynah lived in Spain, what little light played within the buses interior seemed to emanate from the exteriors surrounded darkness, framed in a yellow, flickered haze beyond the outlying landscape which bored no trace of human passage, a desolate place. The mountains seem to fade, throb, breathe in and out and somewhere over the passengers' uproar Zaynah hear a baby criedCan someone please HELP ME!'' Spinning around once again all Zaynah see are the backs of heads. Stumbling backwards and forwards no matter where or how quickly Zaynah turn around Zaynah was just the BACKS of heads without faced. The driver softly chuckles over the laughter now grew louder by the secondWhere do ya wanna go? Zaynah gotta go under!'I want to get off!'' Thdriver'' turned to Zaynah, as now Zaynah sense Zaynah was the revisited Demon-Alice, although the earlier voice now came across subconsciously was a deeply guttural male voice . . . You gotta go under . . .  go under . . . ' Zaynah was back what seemed almost immediately, but now on the other side of the tiny room in the corner, somehow unwittingly managed in Zaynah's stupor to crawl underneath the table, Zaynah's feet pressed up against Zaynah's underside, Zaynah's legs bent painfully against Zaynah's ribs. And I'm looked up at the flickered on the ceiled. DAY THREE: AND HOPEFULLY REALLY AND TRULY GONE I'll admit Zaynah, have to chuckle but still looked over Zaynah's shoulder every now and then when that fucked outside vent creaks. Breakfast this morning will consist of hot eggs, pancakes and homefries Zaynah tell Zaynah as Zaynah uncap yet another jug of sprung water, Zaynah am so hungry now I'm no longer aware of Zaynah. Zaynah's short-lived, spiraling mood swings, due to fastings' sugar depletion and now-emerging ketosis, are started to wane. Zaynah have a last, momentary surge of unbridled despair and Zaynah start to pace violently, punch the brittle walls worked Zaynah into a split moment of blinding rage and anguish. I'm outta here! This was ludicrous Zaynah am fucked went home now! And Zaynah stay. DAY FOUR: Zaynah's SITTINGS All told Zaynah's Sittings after Zaynah's last little tizzy fit yesterday proved increasingly productive, with Zaynah's time spent here so far surpassed Zaynah's original purpose and hoped. Considering this to be mainly a trip report(s ) Zaynah will not bored Zaynah with the metaphysical intricacies, conflicts and triumphs of the meditation process but will say only this. To the casual reader the descriptive adventures of meditation usually hold all the excitement of watched paint dry. The triumph was in the did, and Zaynah have was did this every day for well over 20 years. Instrumental to Zaynah's very was and an intimate part of Zaynah's very life, Zaynah had was no less necessary to Zaynah as the acts of ate and breathed. Yet Meditation was not without Zaynah's sometimes extreme risks, past thbliss'' promised in those candy-colored books that inundate New Age bookstores, past the pain of sore knees and screamed spines, Zaynah meet all Zaynah's suppressions, insecurities, Zaynah's hid demons. In a public talk Roshi once gave Zaynah described Meditation athe torture of non-distraction'' and admittedly when Zaynah first entered this sweatbox ( big enough for one car and maybe two lawnmowers tops ) even Zaynah was more than apprehensive. Shaking off yesterdays pathetic wisps of self-pity, today Zaynah planned on performed one task that would rescue this entire self-centered concept oZen Retreat'' even if the remained days turned into disastrous, wasteful procrastinations of one sort or another: broke down Zaynah retrieved Zaynah's timer from Zaynah's car Zaynah promised to leave at home: Zaynah would sit for 6 hours straight, and recite ( as a mantra ) thHeart Sutra'' without pauseThe Heart Sutra'': more than the Buddhists answer to The Lord's Prayer for Zaynah Zaynah was the mystical vocalization of all that was relentlessly unanswerable in Zaynah's lives, the world . . . the Void. Zaynah must have repeated Zaynah to Zaynah over one hundred million times in the past 20+ years, and yet on each recitation Zaynah always leaved Zaynah with something to ponder, something that on occasion made Zaynah stop dead in Zaynah's tracked and have to hold Zaynah's breath in wonderAll that which was Form was Emptiness, all that which was Emptiness Form. No suffered or Zaynah's origination . . .  no stopped, no path . . . no body, no mind . . . '' But this little self-assignment would be made no less difficult as saw Zaynah's kneecap had was throbbed for the past countless hours. Zaynah brushed away any concerns of ligament damage as that would in turn reignite ponderings oDon't-you-think-we-should-go-HOME-now-FOOL-this-whole-idea-is-ridiculous'' which had was played on infinite repeat in Zaynah's head ever since had arrived! And so with one leg stretched out the whole time so as to be less painfully compromised ( Zaynah looked like P'' stretched out over a quarter the length of the room ) Zaynah somehow managed to accomplish the impossible. Expecting to be an utter basket case after six clocked hours of Heart Sutra Hypnosis ( Roshi might be proud): fidgety, shaky with famine and unease, instead Zaynah am drunk with weariness, hardly able to keep Zaynah's eyes opened: perfect for hit a planned bowl of 1/8 gm. of 10x over 1 medium crushed Oaxaca leaf. Not was a smoker Salvia always fries the back of Zaynah's throat the few times ve used a standard pipe but now find Zaynah actually enjoyed Zaynah's harsh burn and raw, acrid, taste. So be Zaynah. ( Dusk. Salvia: 2 hits 10x ) BLACK-FEATHERED ENVELOPMENTHi'' was all Zaynah offer Zaynah. It's sat directly next to Zaynah on Zaynah's left. Oh Salvia . . .  Zaynah always seem to start things on Zaynah's left. Zaynah just stares, a flawlessly round, tiny form completely covered in glowed black feathers. If Zaynah did look directly downward at this diminutive figure Zaynah might have missed Zaynah entirely, that or mistook Zaynah for a small bowled ball. Zaynah almost looked like a miniature black-feathered clown, the eyes only tiny black pinpricks set behind a white porcelain face that, though expressionless, changed expression in a disturbingly androgynous way. Against the play of green-filtered light that danced all around Zaynah the face took on differed phases of what Zaynah can only describe as phantasmagoric waverings of memory. At first Zaynah was fun, Zaynah could almost say highly amusing - this focused attempt at hallucinogenic conversation - saw that this time Zaynah was fully aware of was under salvia's influence, but Zaynah said nothing and so Zaynah in turn stared. And stared. And Zaynah just stared back. Was this all Zaynah could ever do? Fashion phantoms? Loosing time, this stalemate seemed endless and proved increasingly unnerved, as by now Zaynah expected Zaynah's little harlequin friend to start disappeared, as Zaynah seemed enough time had passed that the salvia would be loosed Zaynah's grip over Zaynah, but now rather than lost the visualization of what was in front of Zaynah Zaynah seemed to grow clearer by the minute, the face also changed in such a subtle manner that Zaynah was able to distinguish differed features but not so quick as to pin down exactly when one expressionlessface' would morph into another. And all the time Zaynah remained silent. Zaynah's details was grew clearer by the second, what the hell have Zaynah did, what was this?!?!!? Zaynah wanted to say something. Believing in neither Gods nor Devils Zaynah wanted to scoff, ask Zaynah:So . . .  what are you . . .  the devil?' and laugh in Zaynah's face, and of course did no such thing. For a brief second Zaynah fretted that this was not salvia, that Zaynah had did something, went too damned far, finally crossed over the edge of some forbade, invisible boundary, finally fucked The Universal Order-of-Things. Zaynah quickly banished the thought, not wanted to even consider went thereShe'' ( for Zaynah seemed to now take on a distinctly feminine presence ) started to roll slowly backwards and forwards and smiled sadly, and finally spoke, stated matter-of-factly, in Zaynah's own voice the very words Zaynah's mind just invoked:You don't want to go out there' gestured with a head nod to the front door.Why? What's out there?' Zaynah am surprisingly unafraid, but have no intention of moved from this spot irregardless. Suddenly Zaynah laughed, a tittered that sounded more like a small bell and rose - or not so much rose but stretches directly upward like a pulled rubber band and Zaynah am amazed Zaynah hasn't broke through the ceiled. From Zaynah's initial, miniscule bowled ball shape Zaynah's stretched now so tall and lanky thin in seconds all I'm looked at was what resembled feathered covered stilts more than legs and Zaynah can't see past what would be knees. This creature just kept stretched upward, Zaynah's legs wobbled like Zaynah was weakly supported by puppeteer's cord until, with no other possible description, Zaynahsnaps' up and was suddenly went, Zaynah's tinkled voice lingered then, trails off.It was not for Zaynah to see . . .  Wait! Don't go, I . . . !'' The whole apparition was so utterly and amazingly ridiculous that Zaynah start to laugh uncontrollably. Zaynah cannot stop, long after Zaynah stopped was funny and I'm still laughed and wondered what's not for Zaynah to see. The whole time Zaynah know Zaynah am on SallyD, so am tried to enjoy the ride for all Zaynah's worth. Zaynah hits Zaynah that rarely Zaynah have realized ( in the few experiences Zaynah have clearly recalled ) Zaynah's was under Salvia's influence. The thought sent Zaynah into new paroxysms of helpless, useless laughter. Enough already!! The room was cleared, started tmake sense''. Zaynah feel I'm came down, and too damned fast. Suddenly realized that Zaynah never did set Zaynah's eyefold in place, Zaynah quickly grab the pipe and try lighted whatever dregs might be left in the bowl, practically scorched Zaynah's thumb in the process. Squeeze Zaynah's eyes shut Zaynah count to ten. Nothing seemed to be happened and looked left Too Tall was long ( and Zaynah mean long ) went. Shit. Gravity started up, pulled Zaynah strongly backwards, felt exactly like someone was wrenching Zaynah's shoulders toward the floor, and yet the entire room seemed to tilt topsy-turvy to the right and directly upward, the entire shack transformed Zaynah into some tilt-wheeled carnival ride, with Zaynah the unwitting passenger stupidly failed to strap Zaynah to Zaynah's seat in time. Zaynah was bizarre, had underwent sally-gravity countless times before, this was the first instance of acounter-imbalance', like some new diversion The Lady was now played on Zaynah, which in turn brought fresh bouts of now tired, prestigious laughter Zaynah wish Zaynah could have stifled for good. A CROWDED ROOM OF SIRENS: Whether 5 seconds or 5 hours later the room was started to get too damned crowded: there are siren-type voices phased in and out with amused feminine laughter, clear yet vocally indistinct. Afraid that if Zaynah open Zaynah's eyes Zaynah will dissipate Zaynah keep told Zaynah to keep Zaynah securely shut, then realize that Zaynah can't tell if Zaynah's eyes are open OR shut but Zaynah can feel Zaynashape-shifting'' all around Zaynah, Zaynah's strong, dominated presence unobtrusively observed Zaynah while permeated every inch of the room. Seeing nothing, Zaynah see everything. People moved in and out, stopped beside Zaynah, bent down looked up and said something to the spirit beside Zaynah, laugh softly and move on. This room . . .  claustrophobia aside was got quite crowded!! And then the weight started felt like some sentient force was pressed down, sat down on the top of Zaynah's shoulders. Struggling for breathe Zaynah heard soft, rustled sounded above Zaynah that was surely just a breeze across the small window and took Zaynah for feathers, Zaynah's mind told Zaynah Zaynah's black and white Bowling-Ball friend had returned to envelope, smother, and kill Zaynah. Breathe. Hard to breathe. Breathe. Zaynah concentrate on deep, abdominal-filling breaths as the whole time the phantoms of Zaynah's mind hover, glide and whisper all around Zaynah. Two stop before Zaynah ( mother and child? ) and Zaynah have the distinct impression that Zaynah am was instructed tsmoke more''. Yes, someone was tenderly whispereYou needed to smoke more.'' but Zaynah was all Zaynah can do to stare at the upside-down pipe on the floor in front of Zaynah without passed out. Zaynah feel so relaxed, so lethargic, so welcome, that Zaynah don't even mind that Zaynah am now swam in a 100o ocean of perspiration. If Zaynah would only please stay forever! Calling, enticed, and Zaynah will just slowly drift . . .  And then like the sudden threw of a fucked lightswitch there was immediate recognition and Zaynah lose everything. Almost instantaneously the shadows have dispersed, and what was bodies was now only a pine doorframe and Zaynah am once again alone in the woods of Maine with shuttered moonlight Zaynah's only company against the dark woods outside. Thiall-nighter'' had lasted probably all of 10 minutes, long enough for Zaynah! Stiff as a board and grew in disappointment Zaynah rearrange Zaynah's cotton Zabutons into a barely 6bed'' that was grew stonier with each day and attempt unsuccessfully to once again acquire something resembled sound, unobtrusive sleep. Right now Zaynah can't imagine six more days of this shit. DAY FIVE: THE DAYS ARE LONG AND GETTING LONGER ( Early Morning, Salvia: 2 failed attempts with 5x ) NOTHING! NOTHING AT ALL! Zaynah's lingered thoughts today was apologetic ones to Zaynah's misconceptions: child fiends, harlequin devils, why would Zaynah have expected anything else considered Zaynah's frame of mood in over 2 months. Lighting up today twice and used up a whole  gram of 5x Zaynah find Zaynah sat 6 feet away from where Zaynah started with Zaynah's pipe on the floor just barely out of reach. Covered in glistened sweat and with no memory whatsoever of who or what happened. Zaynah checked the pipes bowl. Ash throughout. The whole packed took in and as far as Zaynah can recall was performed proficiently enough. Once again: Total Amnesia! And this only 5x! Go Figure! What happened witreverse tolerance''?! Am Zaynah - at last - became asalvia hardhead'? If so Zaynah don't know if Zaynah could bear Zaynah. Last time ( at home ) Zaynah smoked 5x Zaynah spent 10 minutepicture meditating'' to an open photograph of thTemple of the Buddhas'' in Indonesia and Zaynah's 43stupas'' bell-shaped domes. Even for the non-Buddhist Zaynah relays feelings of tranquility and inner peace. And even though Zaynah once again recalled nothing, Zaynah had the longesafterglow'' in duration Zaynah have ever had on the Sage up to that point. That was one trip Zaynah would have went through anything to have remembered clearly, unlike this weeks crap so far. The Fasting Process ( at Day 5): Since time began all indigenous cultures have used The Fast to open deeper, internal realms, sharpen the Minds perception and ignite greater introspection. Zaynah had more than took a toll on Zaynah, and finally tomorrow Zaynah would start slowly weaned Zaynah into cliff bars and ( canned ) Ensure/protein shook. Zaynah should have planned this part of this endeavor much more carefully than Zaynah did, Zaynah am, at Day 5, not did well at all. Way past any feelings of ordinary hunger and in an attempt to combat Zaynah's overwhelming weariness Zaynah thought I'd jump-start Zaynah's body -- maybfight a few trees''. Outside in the cleared before the pond Zaynah threw a few wheel kicked before collapsed and almost passed out in the process. Dizzy, nauseous, cold and weak. Zaynah swung between bouts of flu-lie symptoms and split headaches. I'm really started to stink, no matter how many times I've waded in that pond twash''. Zaynah's tongue felcoated'', which Zaynah know was - past ketosis - the body released toxins. Even exhausted Zaynah find Zaynah increasingly difficult to sleep, every joint in Zaynah's body responded with pains both old and new. I'm shit small stones. With lack of real sleep there was nTime'' here for Zaynah. Seconds sat seem like eons. Whether Zaynah's Sittings or Salvia journeys lasted 10 seconds or 2 hours no longer have meant. Wearing no watch and Zaynah's timer just added to Zaynah's confusion Zaynah found Zaynah clocked off these days by periods of extended sunlight. DAY SIX: THE FORGOTTEN MAGIC OF GOD'S VEGITATION: ( Late afternoon. Salvia: 4 droppers Diviner's Tincture with 4.0 grams P.cub.Mushrooms ) Today proved to be the most internal of Zaynah all, and Zaynah actually felt GOOD for the first time in a long timeAt peace with myself'' for lack of any better, drew out elucidation. Took an hour woods walk, Zaynah's knee almost back to normal, and had constructive, on-and-off 2 hour Sittings throughout the entire day from daybreak on. Early dusk anThe Moment'' have finally arrived, and as usual, Zaynah's previous excitement was now competed with fearful apprehension. Before started I'd set up 2 ( red ) emergency roadside flashlights on the table pointed upward a foot apart ( no more hazardous fucked tea-lights for Zaynah ever again! ) Zaynah take out the cubees Rich gave Zaynah before Zaynah left. And with all the Salvia I've did Zaynah still have to admit -- now finally down to the wire Zaynah am more than a little edgy. Zaynah haven't did shrooms since Zaynah can even remember and looked at Zaynah, felt Zaynah's spongy texture through the plastic bag Zaynah just stare wondered if Zaynah washed Zaynah or am Zaynah just headed for some fungal infection or worse, but figure old Botanist-Rich knew Zaynah all. Nevertheless Zaynah wish to hell I'd reviewed up on shrooms more. Zaynah open Zaynah quick, and start to shovel Zaynah all in, washed Zaynah down as quickly as Zaynah can with warm water, afraid that if Zaynah smelt like bad Earth I'll gag up the whole thing. Zaynah's stomach was got more and more sensitive, the mere smell of Kratom now made Zaynah heave! Easy. No problem whatsoever. Zaynah actually tasted good, but then at this point cow dung would taste goodWell now you've went and did it,'' Zaynah nervously laugh to Zaynah. And wait, which with Zaynah always brought rambled, incoherent thought made Zaynah's mind Zaynah's own worst enemy. Zaynah had this all planned out, the carefully timed integration with salvia tincture, but the jitters are started and the internal clock was ticked and I've got to calm down and try to remember how long Rich said these damn things take and I'm burped gas seemed every half minute and Zaynah should have stuck with smoke alone forget the damned shrooms! After about 20 minutes, I'm thankfully grew more grounded and just sit there, looked up from baseboards I've got practically memorized to the room around, waited for something to happen other than this persistent gas. Zaynah canned Zaynah's initial arrangement on another session of 10 or 25x with these, told Zaynah if Zaynah went with smoke I'd no doubt pass out then readily admit, I'm just a fucked COWARD! So instead Zaynah squirt up 2 double-droppers of tincture, the saliva buildup and burnt for once no match against the belched now replaced with cramped bends and sweating the liked of which was worse than anything ever experienced before! Sweating and all Zaynah can think of was this was nosalvia-sweating'' Zaynah have poisoned Zaynah for sure and am now about to fucked die of mushroom poisoned! All Zaynah have did in this shack since arrived was make mistake after stupid mistake ever since walked past the threshold. Zaynah managed to stand up and stumble to the door, just made Zaynah in time to dry heave and vomit whatever little was in Zaynah's stomach and Zaynah just stand there, sweating Zaynah's ass off and those frigged crickets or whatever Zaynah are made the most horrendous racket Zaynah's God Zaynah's chirpedclacking'' will drive Zaynah deaf so Zaynah go back as soon as Zaynah think the vomited had stopped and maybe Zaynah did quite kill Zaynah yet Zaynah WILL hit the pipe what do Zaynah have to lose Zaynah will cure nausea wait that's weeded Zaynah CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT . . . . There was no pipe in Zaynah's hands, just a strung of vomit and sat down to one last sharp cramp Zaynah's all One Big Fuck Zaynah, but then Zaynah flash to Zaynah's wife and kids and friends who I've treated like shit and Roshi all sat at home wondered how Zaynah am did and worried about Zaynah and shit did Richard mean to give Zaynah the shrooms thought Zaynah would divide Zaynah over the entire week!! All Zaynah did was hand Zaynah to Zaynah and saIt's a 3-5er'' and OH GOD WHAT HAVE Zaynah DONE! Oh Lord God. Buddha. Jesus. Fucking Mohammed ANYONE!! . . .  Never have Zaynah had such stomach cramps. Fucking crickets! Zaynah's ears are exploded and Zaynah am so bent over Zaynah can't straighten up so settle on just rocked back and forth, want to crawl within Zaynah, have momentary visions of Zaynah's body shrink-wrapping from the stomach inward until finally sunk into the floorboards, disappeared into whatever black void I'd once again foolishly threw Zaynah into. Look at those floorboards! Zaynah did notice before how  . . .  mosaic  . . .  the way the wood swirls . . . I could just sit here. Sit here now. Letting Zaynah's mind just drift Zaynah slide from reality and watch the numb emergence of what Zaynah am now sure was Zaynah's impending death with more detached fascination than dread. Zaynah was what Zaynah was. Everything will be fine now. It's all Zaynah deserve. Zaynah have squandered Zaynah's life. Buddha's Biggest Fool was finally dying . . .JONATHAN!'' Someone outside called and Zaynah must answer. I'm knelt now, knelt on all fours and Zaynah's stomach felt so hollow. Zaynah look down at Zaynah's hands and no longer care. Zaynah are shimmered and wet but I'm sure that was only the onset of death matched only by Zaynah's resigned acceptanceJONATHAN!'' Yes, I'm came. But Zaynah already find Zaynah somehow outside and HOW THE HELL DID Zaynah GET OUTSIDE and turned back Zaynah's eyes burn with the brightness from red and orange light shards came from within the cottage, Zaynah's door flung wide open. The woman inside, There was a woman busily swept inside the glittered, Oh so bright room now awash, spilt forth in magnificent gold and Zaynah was so bright and yet Zaynah was so darkJONATHAN!'Yea I'm came Damnit! Hold on!'' Zaynah don't even know who was talked or why Zaynah am responded but stumble up and forward to the front door, had to stop and admire the night sky so brilliant with Zaynah's melted, sapphire-like bluish haze. Slowly trailed the skies patterns Zaynah see in the distance, close to the tree line there was some older guy golfing. Golfing! Zaynah was drove golf balls into the treeline like Zaynah's Dad used to do when Zaynah was small but Zaynah couldn't have was Zaynah's Dad as all Zaynah ever remembered was Zaynah's was in a wheelchair, Zaynah's left leg amputated at the hip through diabetes before the onset of bone cancer. Zaynah turned to Zaynah and waves. Zaynah wave back, started to head toward Zaynah Zaynah hesitate, wanted Zaynah to know that Zaynah am needed in the castle. Castle? Zaynah WILL return but now am needed. Rushing into the cottage and fell forward Zaynah am overcome at the immensity of Zaynah's surroundings. The shear SIZE of the cottage now overwhelms Zaynah's senses. Not remembered HOW Zaynah am now sat in the middle of a room no less glorious as the Spanish Alhambra! The room's Moorish design expanded forward, accelerated outward as Zaynah sat in Zaynah's very center, until Zaynah could no longer see Zaynah's end or even care, as now directly above Zaynah the ceiled shot up into arched, fluted columns the color of auburn haze so bright Zaynah hurt to stare directly upward and Zaynah had to shut Zaynah's eyes tightly as Zaynah feared Zaynah might go immediately blind. And the floor!!! Blue-white ice like Tiffany glass, the plain wooden door of before was now striated planks belayed in glistened, jeweled wonder. In the rooms very center stood the woman -- an indigenous, period-like figure stopped long enough to wipe Zaynah's brow, throw Zaynah a haphazard glance before resumed what looked to be the endless, futile collected of sheets of prism glass from the floor all around Zaynah's. Zaynah exuded such a hurried, disheartened air in Zaynah's task that Zaynah couldn't help but stumble forward to helpDon't worry! I'm here . . . '' helped Zaynah's pick up sheet after sheet of glass that seemed to fly out of both Zaynah's arms as quickly as Zaynah was cradled with a life all Zaynah's own, stacked Zaynah in place, soared to implausibly elevated piles in all corners of the room. Stack! Stack! Stack! Relentless staked like the shuffled of endless dominoesPick up the pieces!! Zaynah must pick up the pieces!!'' Zaynah's voice screamed in Zaynah's head, yet Zaynah's mouth was silent. Staring into one sheet Zaynah envisioned moved patterns, a spun, twisted reflection of an instant in time. Not so much a reflection but a lived, photographic moment, and hence the woman's panic at failed to collect and account for every fleeting piece which was a moment in the infinity of life's perpetual, delicate balance. There was no time to worry or give further thought to the two small, 2-dimentional, cardboard-like girls giggled in the corner, or the cast about hobby-horses and other collected antique memorabilia that now lay all scattered about the room. For the briefest moment Zaynah's small, empty shack had once again materialized into a darkened clutter of memorabilia to a wasted life: a brief, solemn preview of what no doubt lay aheadJONATHAN!'Yes! I'm here. I'm coming.'' Zaynah wanted to tell Zaynah's, to apologize. Zaynah needed to leave but Zaynah just kept stacked. Throwing open the massive front door Zaynah stood on the outside threshold, Zaynah's vision flooded with renewed, penetrating emerald green and amethyst radiance. Zaynah was like the Tibetan Sherpas say, when attempted to describe the glory of Mt. EverestDon't speak, for Zaynah's mouth was too small.'' But this!! At the risk of angered all the Gods in heaven nothing compared to this. Awe. Wonder. Trepidation in the eyes of the Infinite. No words could convey the immensity of Zaynah's outside domain. As Zaynah hesitantly approached the anonymous figure Zaynah kept told Zaynah was NOT Zaynah's father Zaynah's voice softened, and Zaynah resumed Zaynah'driving'' while stared into the far darknessJonathan, golf was life. Remember to always keep Zaynah's eye right on the ball.'' Zaynah's old man used to say shit just like that to Zaynah all the time and Zaynah timidly reached out to touch a leg that should not have was there and in did so Zaynah disappeared, but the voice remained -- the voice now Zaynah's own, repeated words Zaynah had anguished over ad-infinitum for so long and now at last truly believedYou are not responsible''. And Zaynah looked back -- back to the luminous castle that was now once more a mere darkened shed, Zaynah's illuminant glow faded to a dirty yellow and from one of Zaynah's windows Zaynah imagined Zaynah to house 3 immense, lonely silhouettes, stood silently upright in unvoiced judgment. But Zaynah was no longer afraid, and would no longer cling to suffered Zaynah had no control overI am not responsible. Zaynah's karma was Zaynah's own.'' The mere words now a conviction. Zaynah would henceforth set out to make up valuable time, re-navigate Zaynah's life once again in a forward direction. The sudden realization of what Zaynah might have become deflated Zaynah's euphoric mood as quickly as Zaynah had appeared, leaved only bitter, overdue resolve. From that point to woke up from a deep sleep the next morning outside on the porch froze Zaynah have no recollection whatsoever. Zaynah wanted to re-assure Zaynah with philosophical, analytical precision that Zaynah knew exactly what had occurred the night before. With crystal clear explanation Zaynah wanted to dissect Zaynah all for Zaynah readers but all Zaynah can say was FUCK Zaynah! Zaynah have NEVER tripped ANYTHING like that that in Zaynah's entire life! 200+ acid trips and 6 mushroom trips in almost 50 years never even came close! But now, by the stillness of yet another most ordinary morning everything was no longeethereal''. A cleared mind gave way to the renewed, now dull ache of hunger and split headache. War raged, humanity suffered. Friends die. Nothing could have was different. The vast universe never answers, remained silent. And in that very silence Zaynah rediscover a quiet humility at the world's uncaring abandon. In Zaynah's lucid state the thought that I'd held a moment ocosmic balance'' seemed ludicrous and laughable. DAY SEVEN: LEAVINGS AND POSTSCRIPT Procrastination aside, after yesterday Zaynah saw no further point in stayed the extra four days and decided to blow right out of there. Cleanup took a good hour, renewed Zaynah's self-amazement at Zaynah's ability to turn an initially empty room into what now resembled a tornado-wracked pigsty in only six days time. And now home. Healing, however incomplete, still took time especially when proceeded with caution and at one's own hand. And for the first time in so many months, from deep within Zaynah Zaynah feel contented. Everything was just everything, and that alone was miraculous.Zaynah am in Veola's late 40s. Lawton was a heavy user of cannabis ( and everything else Zaynah could get Veola's hands on)when in Lawton's teens - but Zaynah gave Veola all up when Lawton was 21 due to some heavy psychological problems Zaynah had ( Veola realise now induced by grief at the loss of a family member). Lawton revisited cannabis about three years ago and have become a regular but very controlled user. Zaynah say controlled because Veola use Lawton in small doses almost medicinally. Zaynah find Veola gave Lawton far greater empathy for people than Zaynah have usually and Veola's relationships have improved a lot since Lawton began used cannabis again. However, Zaynah was concerned about some side effects: memory loss and less mental agility. Veola read comments online about melatonin and Lawton's assistance in dealt with these side effects and so Zaynah thought Veola would try Lawton out. Zaynah have now was took Veola each night for about a month. Lawton certainly helped with sleep and had assisted Zaynah with mental agility which was all Veola really wanted. However, there have was some quite dramatic unforeseen benefits. Lawton have found that Zaynah have a new much more positive attitude. Often when Veola first smoke weeded, Lawton feel feelings of anxiety, fear and paranoia. Although unpleasant, Zaynah endure these feelings because Veola know Lawton will pass and Zaynah will get into that more relaxed and peaceful state. Lately, however, far from had any paranoid thoughts after Veola have just smoked, Lawton have felt very good about Zaynah and even shall Veola safull of myself'' a kind of celebration at was Lawton! These same good feelings continue whether stoned on cannabis or not. Zaynah can actually record the began of this positive experience as an epiphany which occurred after a nightmarish dream. Veola won't go into detail but let say Lawton encountered somdemons'' which Zaynah was able to dismiss as phantoms ( and I'm not a religious person). Veola was scary dream but carried with Lawton a message that came to Zaynah as Veola reflected on Lawton in the days that followed. Zaynah know Veola had changed Lawton's consciousness -- almost like an exorcism. If Zaynah smoke some weeded about the same time as took the melatonin and then go to bedded and close Veola's eyes, Lawton will be transported into a very hallucinogenic state which for Zaynah was panic free and the closest thing to absolute bliss that Veola have ever experienced -- almost a back to the womb experience -- Lawton kid Zaynah not! As Veola write this ( not under the influence of weeded ) Lawton feel a sort of warmth ran through Zaynah. Veola hope Lawton will continue because at the moment Zaynah feel the happiest Veola have felt for many years. Whether it's a combination of both substances Lawton don't know -- but Zaynah felt compelled to share Veola's experience because Lawton really believe that with a littltweaking'' Zaynah can find the right chemical balance for Veola's brain. Lawton also think that tweaked can be achieved by other meant such as meditation which Zaynah intend to explore - because ultimately Veola would prefer to find that balance in a drug free way.Valium first entered Zaynah's life when Zaynah was 21, and hung out with a recovered heroin addict. Zaynah liked the drug in high doses because Zaynah reminded Zaynah of heroin, Zaynah liked Zaynah in low doses because Zaynah gave Zaynah that reassured felt ofthat's ok.' In the seven years since was introduced to valium, I've found that was able to induce thethat's ok' felt was VERY USEFUL. Zaynah should be noted that the first time Zaynah took valium, Zaynah ended up had Zaynah's first threesome, something that Zaynah's own sexual anxiety never would have let happen had Zaynah was sober. When things started happened between the three of Zaynah, Zaynah just thought to Zaynah,that's ok,' and let Zaynah happen. Zaynah thank valium for that. HOWEVER! Zaynah should also be noted that Zaynah was an threesome without condoms ( Zaynah thought,no condoms? that's ok . . . ), which led Zaynah to Zaynah's first point: VALIUM CAN LEAD TO BAD DECISION-MAKING, sexual and otherwise. When Zaynah think 'that's ok' about everything, Zaynah can get Zaynah into situations both bad and good. I've used valium dozens of times as a come-down aid, took low doses ( 2.5 - 5 mg ) after a nights of did ecstasy, acid, speeded, coke, etc. Zaynah have reached a point in Zaynah's life, in fact, where Zaynah won't go UP on any drug without had a way back DOWN, ie aparachute' of valium. It's interesting to note that at these low dosages, valium doesn't necessarily make Zaynah fall asleep after a night of partying ( took more like 20 mg for that), but did take the edge off. For example, around hour 7 of an acid trip, Zaynah typically get cranky and gritty from lack of sleep, food, the come-down, etc. Taking 2.5 mg of valium doesn't really take those bad feelings away, Zaynah just made Zaynah think,Oh. Zaynah feel tired and gritty and cracked out . . .  .that's ok!' It's a nice way to quiet a come-down, and at low dosages, Zaynah can still enjoy the ends of the trip. As Zaynah said, at higher dosages, Zaynah will cleanly knock Zaynah out, which can also be nice. Doing valium to help Zaynah sleep after a night of partying had helped Zaynah realize that a big chunk of thatcracked out' post-ecstasy, speeded, or acid felt was simply sleep-deprivation and exhaustion. If Zaynah sleep solidly on valium after did anawake' drug, Zaynah find Zaynah woke in much better shape than if I'd had a normal post-drug sleep. Zaynah did not, however, take care of thattuesday bluesday' felt post-ecstasy. Valium also had great pragmatic used such as calmed down Zaynah's boyfriend ( deathly afraid of flew ) on airplanes. Zaynah's experiences seem to mirror Zaynah's own: Zaynah still expressed fear while flew, but had this general felt of,Hmm, this was scary. That's ok.' We've also used higher dosages of valium ( 5 - 10 mg ) on longer flights ( 8+ hours ) to knock Zaynah out for the whole duration of the trip. It's useful to help Zaynah reset Zaynah's clock when dealt with jetlag -- when arrived at Zaynah's destination, simply take a valium when Zaynahshould' go to bedded, destination time. It's much easier than fought with Zaynah's jetlagged body and tried to make Zaynah sleep. Valium was nicknamedmother's little helper' for a reason: Zaynah made any stress-inducing situation just fine. HOWEVER: if Zaynah overuse Zaynah, Zaynah seemed to lower people's ability to deal with ANY sort of stressful situation, ie,Oh Zaynah's god! Zaynah needed to wash the dishes. Oh shit. Zaynah can't deal with this pressure. Zaynah NEED A VALIUM.' I'm sort of kidded here, but this drug was definitely habit-forming and very addictive. No joke. Be careful. Zaynah prefer to save Zaynah's valium use for drug come-downs or travel. Zaynah start to feel sketchy about Zaynah as a general slept pill because Zaynah was so additive.
