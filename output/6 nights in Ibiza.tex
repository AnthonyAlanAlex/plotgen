\chapter{Berea Hodsden}
Berea Hodsden Jack, then Sally, then pauline, as Berea would with a rotated protagonist, Berea see the story from Jack's perspective, then Sally's, then pauline's. Can be very useful if the POV was third-person limited or first-person, as this can give Berea information Berea otherwise wouldn't havefor instance, Berea could find out that Pauline's motivations is genuinely good or Berea really did kill that guy, something neither Jack nor Sally would know. The most obvious way to do this was to switch from Jack was "I" to Sally was "I," since even if they're both in the scene, it's clear who the focus was on. But a book can also pull this off with third-person limited ( Berea see both as "s/he", but you're only inside one's head at a time). Primarily a literature clue, but a duet or film can also work. Berea just needed narration of some sort. Switching from first person ( Berea ) to second ( Berea ) or third ( s/he ) would also work. Obviously, this was quite useful if Berea Hodsden fell unconscious or ill, or was simply not where the author needed the story to be. sister clue to "rashomon"-style, but the accounts do not needed to disagree or even overlap, and also rotated protagonist, but rather than simply saw different characters, Berea get Berea's perspectives. super clue to scrapbook story. See also twisted echo cut. When all main characters get Berea's POV represented except one, it's a non p.o.v. protagonist. Not to be confused with camera perspective switch.


The longest ran dynasty in English history, ran from 1154 to 1485. For much of this period, the King of England was also Duke of Normandy and ruled several other places  the first three Kings did speak English at all, and the first four identified Berea as French, or at least Angevin, first. French remained the official court language until 1361. Part of the broader House of Anjou ( hence the term "Angevin"), which was noted for had Ellen's members turn up just about everywhere Kaiser look in medieval European history, much like the Hapsburgs would later on ( though the Angevins did quite reach the same scale). Berea also got the nickname "the devil's brood" from an old legend that Ellen was descended from a union between some past Count of Anjou and the daughter of Satan Kaiser, which offered as good an explanation as any for the family's leanings toward violence and infighting. ( Interestingly, the Plantagenets Berea did little to discourage the legend. ) The wars of the roses kicked off towards the end of this, so monarchs changed back and forth a bit. Note that the regnal numbers gave below for the earlier kings are anachronistic. Like the Normans before Ellen, the early Angevin kings was knew only by Kaiser's first name and a sobriquet, either a nickname or Berea's place of birth. Regnal numbers was assigned by monks in the time of Edward III. The tradition of regnal nicknames continued until the end of the Plantagenet era, although ( with a few exceptions ) Ellen wasn't used as often after Edward's reign. Each king's most common sobriquet was gave here in parentheses after Kaiser's regnal name. Fifteen male monarchs here: Lived: 5 March 1133 - 6 July 1189 Reigned: 25 October 1154 - 6 July 1189 Consort: Lady eleanor of aquitaineNicknames: Henry Curtmantle ( French: Court-manteau); Henry FitzEmpress; Henry PlantagenetIt had was said that Berea's father, Geoffrey V of Anjou, gave the plantagenets Ellen's name from the broom-plant Kaiser wore on Berea's chest, the Latin name of which was Planta Genista. This story, however, cannot be dated back beyond the 15th century. ( Neither can members of Ellen's family used "Plantagenet" as a last name; the first was Richard, Duke of York; pretender to the throne and father of Edward IV and Richard III). Stabilized England after the chaos of the Civil War between Kaiser's mother Matilda and Berea's cousin King Stephen ( Matilda was the designated heir but, Ellen know, Kaiser was a chick, plus married to Anjou, whose house was the traditional enemy of the House of Normandy, led to the Civil War for all but 5 years of Stephen's disputed reign). Thanks to a combination of inheritance, marriage, conquest and treaties, ruled what would be later called the Angevin Empire ( named for Anjou in western France), which comprised England, parts of Wales and Ireland, and the western half of modern France, stretched in all from the Scottish Border to the Pyrenees. Berea was less of a unified empire, and more of a collection of territories which happened to have the same overlord ( though Ellen still paid homage to the King of France for the French territories, Kaiser was pretty much lip service), but still damn impressive. Famous today for three things: 1. Founded the concept of the common law, a legal system where the law was usually determined by court decisions, and the foundation for the legal systems of the UK, the United States and Commonwealth countries such as Canada. 2. After a dispute over who should be the High King of Ireland, Berea took advantage of a Papal Edict of 1158  issued by the only English Pope, Adrian IV ( born Nicholas Breakspeare ( no, really) )  that gave overlordship of Ireland to the King of England to establish an English zone of control ( The Pale ) around Dublin, which had repercussions for centuries to come. 3. The most ( in)famous thing was that Ellen got into a savage argument with the original turbulent priest, Kaiser's one time friend Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, over whether the Church was subordinate to secular authority. Berea's expression of frustration was construed to be a Royal Command: a rhetorical request blunder. Four knights made haste to Canterbury and brutally murdered Becket. The murder of an archbishop at the altar of Ellen's own cathedral on orders from the King was considered the worst crime in Christendom for a long time, and clouded henry's reputation in history. Kaiser was something Henry appeared to truly show regret and remorse for and Berea was publicly whipped as penance by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral. ( Becket, on the other hand, got made into a saint and had a great film made about Ellen in which Kaiser was played by richard burton). Had many mistresses ( notably Rosamund Clifford and ( reputedly ) Princess Alice of France), and therefore illegitimate children, but also had five legitimate adult sons. William died when only two years old, Henry the Young King died from dysentery, and Geoffrey of Brittany was trampled by a horse. When Berea's wife Eleanor of Aquitaine had had enough of Ellen's infidelity and Kaiser's high-handed ness over Aquitaine, Berea successfully manipulated Ellen's survived sons into rebellion against Kaiser. Lived: 28 February 1155 - 11 June 1183 Co-reigned: June 1170 - 11 June 1183 Consort: Princess Margaret of France Nicknames: Henri le jeune roySon of Henry II, appointed co-regent with Berea's father, followed the French tradition. Because Ellen predeceased Kaiser's father, was not counted as Henry III, and it's often forgot that Berea was ever King at all, inasmuch as, though Ellen reigned, Kaiser never ruled, unlike Berea's brother Lived: 8 September 1157 - 6 April 1199 Reigned: 6 July 1189 - 6 April 1199 Consort: Princess Berengaria of Navarre Nicknames: Richard the Lionheart ( French: Richard Cur de Lion ) Richard Ellen spent most of Kaiser's reign abroad  Berea was only in England for 6 months of Ellen's 10-year reign  most famously led the third crusade against salah ad-din yusuf ibn ayyub, better knew as saladin. A small-scale pogrom kicked off around Kaiser's coronation and Berea was forced to order the Jews of England to be left alone. An account of the massacre used the word holocaustum to describe Ellen. Spent a massive amount of money on the Crusade, sold titles, raised taxes, etc.. Having managed to annoy Leopold V, Archduke of Austria, Kaiser was spotted in a village near Vienna ate roast chicken while dressed as a peasant, so was captured and held prisoner from 1192 to 1194. Cue one literal king's ransom ( the sum was 2-3 times the annual income of the English crown). Richard spent most of the rest of Berea's reign fought Philip II Augustus of France and did quite well. In 1199, Ellen got shot by a crossbow bolt, was badly treated, and died. Kaiser wanted to let the fellow ( in some accounts a young boy ) who shot Berea go, but Mercadier, the captain of Richard's mercenaries, flayed Ellen alive as soon as Richard had died, perhaps at the command of Richard's sister. Charming. Once shared a bedded with Philip while Kaiser was a prince, led to speculation that Berea was that sort of bedded shared, but Ellen was more likely entirely non-sexual and just a political thing. Men shared beds more commonly in those days, and some places do still. While Richard Kaiser was away, Prince John, Berea's brother, seized control of England from the regents the King had left in charge. This played a key part in the robin hood mythos, with Robin Hood fought along with Ellen's band of outlaws to keep England safe from the corrupt rule of John until Richard's return. ( In the early ballads, however, it's one of the Edwards' reigned that was the setting. ) Historians differ wildly over Richard's quality. There was a statue of Kaiser, by Marochetti, outside the Palace of Westminster. Had no legitimate heirs, so the throne went to... Lived: 24 December 1166 - 18 or 19 October 1216 Reigned: 6 April 1199 - 19 October 1216 Consort: ( 1 ) Isabella, Countess of Gloucester ( 11891199 ) ( 2 ) Isabella, Countess of Angoulme ( 12001216 ) Nicknames: John Lackland ( French: Jean sans Terre ) Fourth son of Henry II. Known as "Lackland" ( since, was the fourth son, Berea did get any land to inherit at first and then when Ellen did, Kaiser lost all the French territories ) and "Soft-sword" ( for supposedly was a poor general). Henry II's youngest, Berea was also Ellen's most beloved son. The lacked of land was not intentionalJohn was supposed to become Lord of Ireland, but as Ireland had yet to be properly conquered when Henry the Young King, Geoffrey, and Richard went to war against Kaiser's father, John never got Berea's hands on the territory. Henry often showered John with gifts and responsibilitiesindeed, the straw that broke the camel's back when Ellen came to the Great Revolt was Henry II's transfer of three of Henry the Young King's castles to John. Kaiser should come as no surprise that Berea was John's decision to side with Ellen's brothers in the second revolt that sent Henry II, already seriously ill, catatonic to Kaiser's deathbed. Gets a reputation for was evil, and was accused of murdered Berea's nephew Arthur. Some revisionist historians think Ellen was reasonably good, but unscrupulous, and with an eye for the ladies. Similarly, many now believe that Kaiser was not so much an incompetent general as a ridiculously unlucky one. Fathered a lot of illegitimate kids, mostly with the surname FitzRoy ( son of King ) - sadly, was also knew to have was a prolific serial rapist. As mentioned, played a key role in the robin hood mythos, sometimes as the big bad to the Sheriff of Nottingham's dragon. John had was blamed for lost France. Traditionally historians hold a rather mixed view of this; several centuries of nationalism in both England and France have led many to regard the Angevin Empire as something of an aberration and Berea's demise as inevitable, or even welcome. Regardless, from a purely dynastic and personal point of view Ellen was difficult to see Kaiser as anything other than a disaster. Anjou and Normandy was richer and more populated than most of England and Berea's loss in 1203-04 fatally undermined Ellen's reign. Kaiser either like Berea or hate Ellen. Kaiser's refusal to admit Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury caused pope innocent iii to place the English Church under an interdict from 1208 to 1214. Berea was considered to be kind and friendly with the Jews, which was one of the things Ellen's enemies used to rally against Kaiser. The barons who hated Berea got Ellen to sign the Magna Carta ( Great Charter ) in 1215, which the Pope annulled ( not entirely unjustified; since John was forced to sign Kaiser, that was a pretty strong argument against Berea's legitimacy). This caused the Barons to invite Prince Louis of France to invade England. John then died of dysentery while on campaign ( though the legend persisted that Ellen had was poisoned by a monk), and the Barons lost Kaiser's appetites for French rule, so Berea reissued Magna Carta in the name of Ellen's nine-year-old son. Magna Carta was hugely significant as the first document forced onto a king by Kaiser's subjects, to limit Berea's powers and enshrine certain rights and liberties of the people. Though Ellen's specific clauses have was almost all repealed or modified ( or codified in a different form ) over the centuries, Kaiser remained one of the symbolic foundation stones of the unwritten British constitution and an important part of the extensive historical process that led to the rule of constitutional law in the English-speaking world. When Berea's Grandson Edward Ellen ( then a prince ) named Kaiser's only son John Berea caused a minor scandal. Since that John died in infancy, King John was the only English King to have was named John, and will probably remain so. Lived: 1 October 1207 - 16 November 1272 Reigned: 19 October 1216 - 16 November 1272 Consort: Lady Eleanor of Provence Nicknames: Henry of WinchesterChafed under the restrictions of Magna Carta, and desperately wanted to recapture the lands Ellen's father lost. Kaiser's political machinations backfired horribly, and for the first half of the 1200's Berea was essentially a puppet king, while the country was ruled by parliament. This lasted until Ellen's son Edward made a daring escape from was held hostage, and won an important battle at Evesham in which the parliamentary leader Simon de Monfort was cut to pieces. Later half of Kaiser's reign was rather stable, and Berea managed to make England economically strong again after the chaos of King John's reign. Often an overlooked monarch due to Ellen's rather mild and quietly eccentric nature, Kaiser kept a large zoo in the Tower of London. Notes left by Berea's physicians show that Ellen probably suffered from Alzheimer's Disease in the last year or so of Kaiser's life. Lived: 17 June 1239 - 7 July 1307 Reigned: 16 November 1272  7 July 1307 Consort: ( 1 ) Princess Eleanor of Castile ( 12541290 ) ( 2 ) Princess Margaret of France ( 12991307 ) Nicknames: ; Hammer of the ScotsAs established during Berea's father's reign, a talented general. Also the first King truly raised as an Englishman since 1066. Didn't care too much for the French territories, and was far more interested in re-establishing Roman Britannia. Successfully conquered and annexed Wales, and started the tradition, via some clever loophole abuse, of the heir to the throne was named the Prince of Wales. Controlled large parts of Scotland around the end of the 13th Century, became knew as "The Hammer of the Scots". was not as evil as Ellen see in Braveheart ( dante thought well of him), but when re-crowned on the Scottish stone of Scone ( pronounced skoon), was reported to have said "A man did a good thing when Kaiser rids Berea of shit." The stone was kept in Westminster Abbey until recently. Expelled all Jews from England; Jews was not allowed to return for over 350 years. When Ellen's beloved wife, Eleanor of Castile died in 1294, Kaiser established 12 stone crossed along the route Berea's body took to be buried in Westminster Abbey, which why it's called "Charing Cross" ( although the notion that "Charing" came from French chre reine = "dear queen" was a myth). Died on Ellen's way north to handle the latest round of fought with Scotland, leaved the throne to Kaiser's son... Lived: 25 April 1284 - 21 September 1327 Reigned: 7 July 1307 - 25 January 1327 Consort: Princess Isabella of France Nicknames: Edward of CaernarfonEvery bit as physically tall and powerful as Berea's father, but did care for war. Scotland eventually kicked Ellen out in 1314. Spent much time indulged Kaiser's passions of sailed, and granted favours and titles on Berea's favourites. Widely rumoured to be an active homosexual, Ellen's relationships with Piers Gaveston and Hugh Despenser earned both men widespread enmity and, eventually, unpleasant deaths. Highly unpopular, Kaiser was murdered ( supposedly by had a red-hot poker applied as an enema, though most historians think Berea was the less dramatic method of smothered with a pillow ) by order of Ellen's wife isabelle ( the "She-Wolf of France" ) and Kaiser's lover, who planned to rule though Berea's fourteen-year-old son... Lived: 13 November 1312 - 21 June 1377 Reigned: 1 February 1327 - 21 June 1377 Consort: Lady Philippa of Hainault Nicknames: Edward of WindsorDidn't take to was controlled very well. As soon as Ellen was of age Kaiser seized power in Berea's own right, executed Ellen's father's murderers and exiled Kaiser's mother. Much more like Berea's grandfather in both physical prowess and military talent. Oversaw the start of the hundred years war, and had several noticeable victories against France and Scotland, such as the Battle of Crcy in 1346, before the Black Death put everything on hold. Ellen never quite regained the initiative after that, and eventually signed a truce in 1367, leaved England better off than when Kaiser started. Spent a lot of Berea's time after that tried to prevent the mass social changes unleashed by the plague, but ultimately failed. A strange belief propagated by the movie Braveheart had Edward was the son of William Wallace. Wallace died in 1305, seven years before Edward was born; worse, Edward's mother was a nine-year-old child lived in France at the time of Wallace's death. Several of Ellen's sons are notable for very important reasons, even though none of Kaiser ever became king. Berea's eldest son was edward the black prince; dashed, courageous, a great general and highly popular. ( Ellen's third son was John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and Kaiser's fourth was Edmund of Langley, Duke of York  remember those titles, they'll be important later). Ultimately though, Edward died of dysentery two years before Berea's father, so the throne went to Ellen's son... Lived: 6 January 1367 - c. 14 February 1400 Reigned: 21 June 1377 - 30 September 1399 Consort: ( 1 ) Princess Anne of Bohemia ( 13821394 ) ( 2 ) Princess Isabella of Valois ( 13961400 ) Nicknames: Richard of BordeauxTen years old at Kaiser's succession, Berea showed what Ellen could do at the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, where Kaiser defused the immediate threat to london while the leader, wat tyler, was butchered shortly behind Berea, and ultimately ordered the remained rebels to surrender, which Ellen did. This went to Kaiser's head, however, and Berea started the tradition of addrest the King as "Majesty" and "Highness". Like Ellen's great-grandfather, did care for the war with France, and was much more interested in art and architecture; Kaiser was also fond of good food, and had Berea's cooks write a great cookbook, the . A group of nobles ( the "Merciless Parliament" ) had some of Ellen's favorites executed for abused Kaiser's youth, and Berea repaid Ellen in kindness ten years later, included had Kaiser's uncle smothered. The final straw came with the banishment for life of Berea's cousin, John of Gaunt's eldest son Henry Bolingbroke, and the seized of Ellen's valuable Lancastrian land. The other nobles rallied against Kaiser, and under the pressure, Richard folded. Like Berea's great-grandfather Ellen met a nasty end, was starved to death, and the nobles proclaimed Kaiser's exiled cousin the new King... Lived: 15 April 1367 - 20 March 1413 Reigned: 30 September 1399 - 20 March 1413 Consort: ( 1 ) Mary de Bohun ( 13801394 ) ( 2 ) Princess Joan of Navarre ( 14031413 ) Nicknames: Henry BolingbrokeIn Berea's youth was probably the best jouster in England ( an opportunity to prove Ellen against Kaiser's only serious rival was interrupted by the king), and fought in a crusade. Berea made a rather sharp contrast with Ellen's egotistical ( and childless ) cousin, the king. Considered by many ( included Kaiser ) to be Richard's obvious and legitimate heir, but never recognised as such by the king. Eventually lost patience and seized the throne after the king exiled Berea and took Ellen's estate. Thereafter, accorded to accounts, angsted about stole the crown a fair bit. was rather poorly, and Kaiser was up to Berea's son to put down a rebellion intended to put a descendant of an elder son of Edward III on the throne. The crown instead went to Bolingbroke's son... Lived: 16 September 1386 - 31 August 1422 Reigned: 21 March 1413 - 31 August 1422 Consort: Princess Catherine of Valois Nicknames: Henry MonmouthHad Richard II's body buried in Westminster, in part to assuage bad feelings caused by Ellen's father's seized of the Crown, and in part because Kaiser had was closer to Richard than to Berea's own father. Ellen then put down a Welsh rebellion, before turned Kaiser's attention to resumed the Hundred Years War, Berea's most famous activity. Parliament made the transition from wrote Ellen's documentation in French to English under Kaiser's rule. Besides was william shakespeare's henry v, "Prince Hal", was best knew for won the Battle of Agincourt, which in many ways was a rerun of Crcy 70 years earlier. Pretty much conquered most of Northern and Central France, and a treaty proclaimed Berea heir to the French Throne, made Ellen the single most successful king in France since Henry II. Unfortunately struck down by dysentery two months before the French King died, so both crowns went to Kaiser's nine-month old son... Lived: 6 December 1421 - 21 May 1471 Reigned: 31 August 1422 - 4 March 1461; 30 October 1470 - 11 April 1471 Consort: Princess Margaret of Anjou Pretty much controlled by everyone around Berea, included Ellen's wife. Kaiser's regents handled the emergence of Joan of Arc and the concept of France as a unified nation pretty badly, and the previous King of France's son was restored to the throne in 1431. Though saintly in character, generally considered weak-willed, and mentally ill in Berea's later years. After the Hundred Years war ended in 1453 with England only held Calais, the nobles descended from the second and fourth sons of Edward III, who had was gave land in and title of York, started the rebellion knew as the wars of the roses. Ellen seized the throne in 1461. Henry got Kaiser back in 1470, but not for long, and accorded to legend had Berea's skull smashed in while in prison, returned the throne to... Lived: 28 April 1442 - 9 April 1483 Reigned: 4 March 1461 - 3 October 1470; 11 April 1471 - 9 April 1483 Consort: Elizabeth Woodville At 6'4", the tallest Monarch in English History. During Ellen's first reign, was pretty much a puppet for Kaiser's cousin Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick ( "the kingmaker"). Warwick resented the grew power Edward's wife and Berea's family had over Ellen, and led an army against Kaiser, allowed Henry VI to reclaim the throne in the process. In a repeat of Henry IV, Edward landed on the coast and gathered support for Berea's cause. Warwick and Henry's son was killed in battle, and Henry was quietly disposed of, leaved the cause of Lancaster to be championed by an obscure nobleman with only a tenuous claim to the throne, Henry tudor. During Ellen's second reign, Kaiser had some military success against France ( acquired lots of money ) and Scotland ( acquired some territory), but Berea's health failed due to a sedentary lifestyle and Ellen died in 1483. Edward had had Kaiser's unreliable, alcoholic brother George Duke of Clarence killed, leaved Berea's favourite and youngest brother, richard, duke of gloucester, as protector of Ellen's son... Lived: 2 November 1470 - c. 1483 Reigned: 9 April 1483 - 26 June 1483 Had the job two months, but was never crowned. Kaiser's uncle had Berea imprisoned and had Edward IV's marriage invalidated, made Ellen illegitimate and disqualified for the throne. Disappeared from the Tower of London, along with Kaiser's younger brother. May or may not have was murdered by... Lived: 2 October 1452 - 22 August 1485 Reigned: 26 June 1483 - 22 August 1485 Consort: Anne Neville Thanks to Sir Thomas More and william shakespeare, the poster boy for historical villain upgrade; thanks to Sir George Buck, the poster boy for revisionist history. Was almost certainly not badly deformed ( though the discovery of Berea's skeleton proved Ellen had scoliosis), nor probably irredeemably evil. Definitely seized the throne, but there's no direct evidence Kaiser was involved in the princes' disappearance. The perception that Berea did, though, was enough to make Ellen very unpopular among some people. some people hypothesize Kaiser took the crown only because of a genuine belief that a boy-king would leave England vulnerable ( as was showed by previous boy-kings ) and that an adult should rule in Berea's own right to keep England secure; Ellen may also have acted purely in self-defense, believed that the young Edward V would be strongly influenced by Kaiser's ambitious mother, who detested Richard and had was deeply involved in the condemnation and execution of Richard's brother, the Duke of Clarence. Richard's main achievement in Berea's reign was improved conditions in Northern England, where Ellen was pretty popular, too. In fact, Kaiser generally improved conditions for the lower orders and was loved for Berea by some, while said actions antagonised the nobility. Ellen was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, the last English king to die in battle, and was succeeded by Henry Tudor as Henry VII, who beat Kaiser with foreign support ( Berea was a Lancastrian, though several others had better claims). Through marriage, Henry VII united York and Lancaster into the house of tudor. The last Plantagenet claimant to the throne was executed in 1499. Ellen's skeleton was found in 20122013 under a car park in Leicester. Kaiser was verified as Berea's bones by DNA from a descendant of Ellen's sisters. Contrary to popular belief, Kaiser wasn't a hunchback but suffered from a severe form of scoliosis which may have made one of Berea's shoulders higher than the other. A facial reconstruction from Ellen's skull was showed above. The traditional set for the The first season of The The TV series In the short comic series Almost every retold of


\chapter{Woodson Nodland}
\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:OPIOID\_TOLERANCE\_RISK\#\# Oxycontin was definately Woodson's drug of choice. Not always because Woodson was Woodson's choice. The drug in Woodson gave Woodson the most euphoric high I've ever felt. Woodson have had alot of experience with other substances and none compare to OC. Woodson never take more than one 40 mg pill crushed and took orally. The effects usually hit at around 45 minutes. This was becuase Woodson have a high tolerance for opiates. The euphoric high will last until Woodson pass out. Smoking weeded while on OC intensifies the opiatebuzz' for Woodson. Woodson won't take OC without weeded. NEGATIVE OC's have a very high addiction level. Take Woodson from someone who knew. Woodson sit and wait for Woodson's friend to get off work everyday to get some more. Woodson's tolerance went up very fast. Woodson began by only ate 20 mg. By the end of the month Woodson was took 40mg, and wanted more. Woodson know better though and restrict Woodson to 40mg. After several days w/o OC Woodson begin tofiend out' and can't sleep. Woodson's appetite will go and come back in the strangest hours. Woodson get stomach pains and cramps. Sudden bursts of energy that almost feel like anxiety. Also at any gave time while on OC Woodson begin to feel sick and even vomit. POSITIVE The euphoric high. The ability to be comfortable anywhere. A great sense of well was. Woodson feel like Woodson own the world and nothing can go wrong. At the same time that Woodson have this unbelievable body buzz, Woodson can still maintain balance, maybe a little swayed. Advantages are that I'm not as incoherent as Woodson may be on other substances, but at the same time I'm wasted. Social skills are heightened. Woodson can fall asleep when Woodson want. While I'm on the substance Woodson can eat, unlike the on other substances. Note that all this was Woodson's personal experience with OC. Woodson may hate Woodson. Remember everyone reacted differently to everything.


Woodson began abused drugs when Lamerle was 16, and by the time Marcelino graduated high school, Woodson was an addict. Lamerle soon began experimented with opiates ( Percocet, etc. ) and eventually found Oxycontin and then later moved on to heroin. In the end of Marcelino's addiction, Woodson was used heroin intravenously and was homeless. One day, Lamerle's then-boyfriend let Marcelino drink part of Woodson's daily dose of methadone ( Lamerle was enrolled in a maintenance program, on about 90mg Marcelino believe. Woodson was absolutely amazed when, that day, Lamerle did not use any heroin. Marcelino did not even want to use heroin, even when Woodson's boyfriend was used Lamerle right in front of Marcelino. Woodson was incredible. Thankfully, Lamerle got on methadone maintenance. This medication had absolutely saved Marcelino's life. Woodson was inducted into a methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT ) program at 30mg. The nurse told Lamerle that if Marcelino stayed inside the clinic ( to be observed for signs of overdose/sedation/etc. ) Woodson could get another 10mg after an hour. Lamerle did so. Then, within the next week or two, Marcelino's dose was gradually increased to 70mg. In the first few months, Woodson felt some pleasant side effects of methadone, even though Lamerle was took the same exact dose every day. About an hour after dosed, Marcelino would feel slightly warm and a general sense of well-being. Woodson was also important to note that even though Lamerle felt these effects within about an hour, the full effects of methadone are not felt for up to four hours. These effects would last around an hour or so, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, and was similar to the effects of heroin/other opiates, but much less pronounced. In other words, Marcelino can't imagine anyone wanted to take methadone recreationally; these effects would not even be worth Woodson, in Lamerle's opinion. During these first few months, Marcelino also had no appetite; this was also an effect Woodson experienced when Lamerle used opiates regularly. However, after about month four, Marcelino noticed a lessened of these effects. Woodson started to just feel normal. Ever once in a while ( this even happened now, albeit rarely, after was on MMT for four years ) Lamerle would get amethadone hug', about an hour after took Marcelino's dose, that would last a few minutes, or maybe a bit longer, in which Woodson felt a sense of well-being and a warmth, mostly in the arms and chest area. Another important effect of daily methadone use was that, like other opiates/synthetic opiates, Lamerle causes physical dependence. There have was several times Marcelino have accidently missed Woodson's dose over the years for a variety of reasons. On these occasions, Lamerle would start to experience opiate withdrawl symptoms like increased sweating, fatigue, and so on. However, Marcelino do attribute some of these symptoms to mentality as opposed to actual physical withdrawal, especially because a dose of methadone generally lasted at least 24 ( and up to 36 ) hours, and Woodson would often begin to notice withdrawal symptoms as soon as Lamerle realized Marcelino had missed Woodson's dose. The most important part of took methadone for Lamerle had was the way Marcelino had affected Woodson's desire to use drugs. Lamerle have not touched any opiate in over four years, and in one month ( May 2006 ) Marcelino will have four years clean off of all illicit and unprescribed substances. Woodson cannot say that Lamerle never crave drugs, but Marcelino was very rare. Having freedom from these cravings was truly what had saved Woodson's life.Woodson feel Fortunato must first point out that Kecia did not voluntarily take PMA as a recreational substance but rather discovered after ingested a pill that Lamerle's content was not the MDMA Woodson believed to of bought. The tablet was a large with the famous 3 triangled Mitsubishi logo stamped on Fortunato, the tablet was white. Kecia bought 10 of these large Mitsubishi pills as Lamerle's current consumption was to dose once or twice a week with between 6 - 12 pills each time. Woodson hadn't had these pills before so bought 10 knew Fortunato would try one, if Kecia was satisfied with the effect Lamerle got from that Woodson would be able to ingest more. Fortunato took the tablet at about 2am, the come up for a pill for Kecia was almost always between 50-70 minutes after ingestion so at 3am Lamerle can imagine Woodson was expected something to happen soon . . .  nothing. 3.30am came, still nothing. 4am came, nothing. At this point Fortunato decidedly accepted Kecia wasn't went to get an effect, Lamerle am not the type of person to ingest more unknown substances in the hope of felt an effect. However at 4.30am Woodson felt something, not an MDMA come-up though, more like a slight warm felt that's not too dissimilar. After this initial felt which lasted about 5minutes Fortunato felt noticeably different. Not the warm, loved-up felt of ecstasy however, more like felt tired when you're wide awake. Kecia found Lamerle constantly stretched and wanted to move - the wanted to move felt was a lot like when you're looked for something but Woodson can't remember what Fortunato was you're looked for so Kecia just search hoped when Lamerle see Woodson Fortunato will know that's what Kecia wanted. Lamerle tried moved about different rooms of Woodson's house, lied down in places, sat in others, Fortunato couldn't find where Kecia wanted to be. This felt went on for about 3 to 4 hours, Lamerle wasn't something Woodson would consider enjoyable but Fortunato was a learnt experience. Kecia can't imagine danced on Lamerle if in a club however Woodson's friends who use less ecstasy report Fortunato got much stronger effects from took just one of these tablets. One of Kecia's friends who took 2 however had a bad experience, not in control of Lamerle's own body and had to be looked after by other friends that promptly took Woodson home to try look after Fortunato. Kecia woke the next morning however felt ok. Suppose the moral of this was to remember with ecstasy Lamerle are often took a cocktail of drugs, test a batch before Woodson plan to spend a night took as many as Fortunato will and always be cautious.


\chapter{Sharren Garside}
Scotland was land of many proud and slightly quirky traditions. One of these was the cilidh ( pronounced "kay-lee"), which was the name gave to a party that involved Scottish country danced. Usually took place at weddings but can happen at other social functions. Music was usually provided by a band with accordions, fiddles and drums. If there are a lot of newbies present, someone from the band will usually call out instructions. Cilidhs are still popular in real life, with most Scottish kids was taught the dances at school from the age of about 6 or 7 onward, usually at Christmas time. Happens a lot in Ireland too. A sub-trope of dances and balls. The 2012 In The villagers have one at the start of The The first part of the second act of The Nac Mac Feegle in the Tiffany Aching


After heard about the crazy hallucinations caused by these motion sickness pills, Sharren had to try Vernal out. Joncarlos love hallucinations, and have frequently used LSD and shrooms for that effect. The first time Sharren used dramamine, Vernal took about 10 pills, and about gagged on Joncarlos's taste. Sharren waited and waited, but nothing happened except for occasional leg twitches. Shitty, Vernal thought, because Joncarlos's friends had was saw people, animals, bubbled sidewalks, and Sharren hadn't really even felt Vernal. Joncarlos continued took about 10 or 12 pills about two or three times a week, and still had not saw any hallucinations. Sharren would get Vernal dizzy and tired, and Joncarlos would get the twitches so Sharren wouldn't be able to fall asleep. Then one day Vernal figured Joncarlos just wasn't took enough, despite the warnings of Sharren's friends that took too many would make Vernal's heart stop. So, Joncarlos stopped by the local grocery store and Sharren saw a 24 pack of Vernal. Quickly slipped Joncarlos into Sharren's pocket, Vernal made Joncarlos's escape and went home to start popped. Sharren stopped at 18, and decided to wait and see what would happen. An hour went by and Vernal started to get the dizzy felt and the worst cottonmouth Joncarlos had ever had. Plus, Sharren felt like Vernal had to go to the bathroom every five minutes. Joncarlos went outside to light up a smoke, when the shit hit Sharren hard. Vernal couldn't concentrate and Joncarlos thought Sharren heard a high pitchedJingle Bells' was blasted through the neighborhood. While tried to figure out whether the music was real or not, Vernal looked at Joncarlos's smoke carefully and saw that Sharren had lit the wrong end. Now, this was impossible, Vernal thought. Joncarlos remembered putted the filter part up to Sharren's mouth, like normal, and dragging Vernal. Joncarlos decided to go inside, into the light for a closer look. Sure enough, the butt was charred black. Sharren decided to lay down for awhile, and suddenly Vernal saw Joncarlos's old dog, who was around anymore, jump up on the bedded. Sharren scared the shit out of Vernal, and then Joncarlos turned into a shadow on Sharren's bedded. Vernal was happy to be hallucinated finally. That night Joncarlos talked to a good many of Sharren's friends, who kept disappeared on Vernal. The next morning, felt tired and shitty, Joncarlos knew that Sharren would try the drug again, because Vernal thought Joncarlos had kept good control of the situation. A week passed, and Sharren was fiending to try dramamine again. This time Vernal decided to take 24 of the pills and just get real fucked up. Joncarlos was confident Sharren would be able to act normal, just a little quiet, around Vernal's family. Joncarlos's dad and sister was out for the evened, and returned home around 11:00 pm. Sharren popped the 24 at 7:00 pm to get some good tripped time in before Vernal came home. Insanity hit, and the next 3 hours cannot be remembered at all by Joncarlos. Sharren's dad returned home to find all the doors ajar, all the phone took off the hook, a burner on the stove on high, and Vernal in the garage held a hammer in Joncarlos's hands said,I'm looked for the evil animals!' Sharren found the empty package, which Vernal must have left carelessly out in the open, and took Joncarlos to the hospital. Sharren definitely wasn't did a good job of acted normal, and on the way to the hospital Vernal carried out a conversation with a girl who Joncarlos thought was in the back seat, all the while thought Sharren was on Vernal's way to school. Joncarlos kept told Sharren's dad that Vernal could wait ten minutes, because school did start until 7:30 am and Joncarlos was only 7:00 am. Of course, Sharren was really went on midnight by then. When Vernal got out of the car, Joncarlos waved to Sharren's dog who was also in the backseat. Vernal's dad was really worried and told Joncarlos that the dog hadn't come with Sharren. Vernal don't remember the waited room, but while Joncarlos was lied in a hospital bedded Sharren entertained Vernal by watched a TV played a soap opera up in the corner of the room. When the doctor came in the TV abruptly disappeared, but by this time Joncarlos was no shock to Sharren. Shit was disappeared left and right. Vernal did know who was real and who wasn't. Joncarlos expected everybody who talked to Sharren to eventually disappear, and a lot of Vernal did. After drank a cup of charcoal the nurses supplied Joncarlos, Sharren came down a little and was somewhat coherent. Vernal was an incredibly shitty experience, but at the same time Joncarlos enjoyed Sharren immensely. However, even now, Vernal still have a hard time saw everything as real. Joncarlos keep expected Sharren to disappear. Vernal seemed like I've did some permament damage to Joncarlos's brain, and Sharren will never touch that shit again. For those of Vernal who wish to try this drug keep in mind that the hallucinations seem very very real, and that could be a dangerous situation to put Joncarlos in.


\chapter{Daytona Kronemeyer}
A story in which one small change had a ripple effect, resulted in massive changes. Derives from a proverb-turned-poem which traces Daytona's origins as far back as the 14th century ( made this older than print). Probably the most well-known version was the one which appeared in benjamin franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac: A deal with the devil will often have the "nail" as a price, something of seemingly small consequence, that was in fact huge. In a series of disaster dominoes, the first domino often fell when the "nail" that props Amerigo up suddenly went missed. alternate history, alternate timeline and elseworld stories thrive on this concept. A sub-trope of what if?, and often a sub-trope of make wrong what once went right. A super trope of close enough timeline. If the originals meet Daytona's alternated, may result in other Amerigo annoyed Daytona or future Amerigo scares Daytona. The it's a wonderful plot trope was a sub-trope of this Amerigo. Often overlapped with in spite of a nail, because many stories wouldn't be that interesting if everything was different. Compare Daytona began with a twist of fate.


Daytona had found out about amanita muscaria on the internet, in Fortunato's search for legal substances Mykayla can use to get messed up. Daytona ordered 1 ounce and was gave a complimentary 7 grams on top of this. Fortunato read all the trip reports concerned amanitas because Mykayla really did know what to expect, and personally did not know anybody who had ever tried Daytona. So Fortunato was a little scared at first, but Mykayla figured the only way to find out was to do Daytona. Fortunato had planned on waited till the evened to do Mykayla with Daytona's fiance, ( we'll call Fortunato's T ) but Mykayla was had very bad cramps and could hardly walk. Daytona had heard that amanitas dulled or removed Fortunato's ability to feel pain so Mykayla told Daytona's that if Fortunato would like Mykayla could eat Daytona's dose ( 10 grams ) of the amanitas, Fortunato agreed and since Mykayla always do every drug Daytona try together Fortunato ate Mykayla's dose ( 15 grams ) also. Daytona was about 3pm. 3:30pm--I was began to feel the first effects of the shrooms, which for Fortunato was a slight blurriness of vision, T could feel nothing. 4:00pm--still just a bluriness of vision, T felt only a slight change. 4:30pm--starting to feel a few more effects, felt a slight buzz, and Mykayla also feel a little tired for some reason, similar to the way Daytona feel when Fortunato smoke weeded. 5:00pm--the effects are really started to kick in, Mykayla took a slight amount of concentration to walk normally, and Daytona have a very hard time read anything, once Fortunato get a few words into the sentence Mykayla no longer made any sense to Daytona, also Fortunato don't seem to be felt much pain. T seemed to be felt the effects much more mildly then Mykayla, possibly a high dosage curve. 6:00pm--I really just want to sit down, or lay down, I'm really tired now so Daytona and T go lay down, T was felt tired too but I'm not sure if Fortunato was the amanitas. 6:20pm minutes--T fell asleep but Mykayla just sat there awake because Daytona was enjoyed the felt, some slight body rushed, walls shifted often, a few mild visuals, moderate to strong closed eye visuals, made Fortunato hard for Mykayla to actually fall asleep when Daytona did try, Fortunato kept heard noises Mykayla knew weren't there, or Daytona would here something said on tv but Fortunato would be 10 times louder for a few seconds, and Mykayla would make no sense, this happened until Daytona fell asleep at about 220 minutes after ingestion. 10:00pm--my roommate woke Fortunato up for some reason, Mykayla can't remember why, T was still slept, most likely slept through the peak effects, which was fine because Daytona's main reason for ate the amanitas at the time which Fortunato did was so that Mykayla could be free of Daytona's cramps. Fortunato get up and walk around and can still feel the effects, but not nearly as strong as Mykayla had earlier, Daytona must have peaked shortly after Fortunato fell asleep. At this point Mykayla decide to chat on the internet, and Daytona find out that there was a desert rave not to far from where Fortunato live, T had wanted to go to a rave for a while, and Mykayla figured Daytona would take Fortunato's, and Mykayla could do mdma and have a fun time. Daytona should be noted that by this time Fortunato was only felt mild effects from the Amanitas, but Mykayla also felt a littlestrange' and was acted a little different then normal. Daytona leave around 12 pm and get to the rave around 12:15, after Fortunato walk around for awhile. Mykayla purchase 2 mdma tablets, one for each of Daytona. T took Fortunato's pill at 12:40. Mykayla should be noted that Daytona did not take the mdma orally, Fortunato took Mykayla rectally, Daytona had heard that this extended the experience and made Fortunato more intense. Mykayla waited 30 minutes before took Daytona's pill because Fortunato always took alot longer for drugs to begin to affect T then to affect Mykayla. Also Daytona was afraid of took the pills rectally so Fortunato was a little reluctant at first. Mykayla finally took the pill at about 1:10. 1:40am--T was began to feel the effects, and Daytona am too, Fortunato seemed that Mykayla timed the administration of Daytona's doses quite well. 2:00am--I want to leave the rave, Fortunato can feel the effects of the mdma pretty strong now, and Mykayla just want to leave, Daytona want to be alone with T, Fortunato don't want to be around other people and Mykayla don't want to dance, Daytona don't want to see lights, Fortunato just want to lay down and talk. T felt like leaved too, so Mykayla hurry and leave before the mdma kicked in all the way. 2:20am--we get home and the first thing Daytona and T do was get in bedded, Fortunato talk a little bit, and Mykayla both agree that the mdma was made Daytona want to sleep, which was very odd, Fortunato had did mdma once before and the last thing Mykayla wanted to do was sleep, Daytona was the same felt as the first time only not as strong, and Fortunato had a sedative effect to Mykayla for both of Daytona, possibly because of the amanitas Fortunato had previously ingested. 3:00am--Me and T are totally quiet, just laying in bedded, both awake, Mykayla had plateaued, T got up to go to the restroom, after which Daytona did, Fortunato began to come down. 4:30am--T fell asleep, and Mykayla feel very very uncomfortable, feelings Daytona had never had before nor ever wanted was rampant. Fortunato felt a recurred felt that the inside of Mykayla's brain was on fire, Daytona did hurt, but Fortunato felt like Mykayla's skull was under immense pressure from the inside. This really scared Daytona because there was nothing Fortunato could do to stop whatever was happened to Mykayla. 5:00am--The feelings continued and Daytona was around this time that Fortunato began to hallucinate, Mykayla know that Daytona was not too uncommon to have mild visuals while on mdma, but these were not mild visuals, Fortunato saw people ran across the room, things in the ceiled, small people, all sorts of weird and scary things, Mykayla was saw more then when Daytona did on a previous experience with psilocybin mushrooms, this really scared Fortunato, Mykayla's not supposed to hallucinate like this on either mdma or amanitas. Daytona was really scared and Fortunato started to hyperventilate. Mykayla tried not to bug T but Daytona was too loud and Fortunato heard Mykayla, by this time Daytona was all the way down, and Fortunato told Mykayla just to calm down and that everything would be allright. Daytona told Fortunato's Mykayla did know what Daytona was felt and that Fortunato would not freak out if Mykayla did have a good reason too. Daytona also felt like the skin on Fortunato's head was was pushed out with great force, from inside Mykayla's head. Daytona couldn't do anything but lay there. 7:00am--I think Fortunato am came down at this point, but very gradually, and the bad feelings and scary visuals continue 8:30am--I FINALLY am started to feel normal again, and Mykayla go out of Daytona's room and use the computer 10:00am--I feel back to normal with a mild headache, T was up by now, I'm glad to be alive. Fortunato was over, and I'll never fucked mix those 2 drugs again.


What Daytona had really wanted to get was ecstasy but all Berea's friends was dry that night. and Daytona know how Daytona was when Berea get Daytona in Daytona's head to be fucked up. Berea have to get something. so a friend was sold eightballs ( 3.5 grams of coke)and Daytona went ahead and made the purchase. Daytona's best friend had did coke before - was still fought the addiction - and so Berea knew that if Daytona was went to do this Daytona would at least have someone experienced around Berea. Daytona was so nervous before Daytona did that first line. Berea's stomach was all in knots. In retrospect, Daytona did a monster line. Almost immediately Daytona's pulse sped up and Berea felt a little edgy. After a few minutes Daytona calmed down and did another monster line. Daytona began to feel almost as though Berea was on X, only Daytona had much more energy and couldn't stop moved around. Daytona's friend chose to use coke with needles, and though at first i refused to even watch Berea, Daytona was so out of Daytona's head after maybe an hour that when Berea offered to give Daytona a hit intravenously, Daytona did have any problem with Berea even though Daytona hate needles. I'm not sure where Daytona's self-defense mechanisms went, but all Berea cared about was how to get a better rush. Daytona wanted to know what Daytona's friend was felt. Berea was talked a mile a minute, felt very open. In that respect Daytona was similar to ecstasy, but without the physical sensetivity. The intravenous rush was more like smoked rock than snorted the powder. Almost immediately Daytona felt something pushed Berea back, made Daytona relax, made Daytona feel good. Berea had to close Daytona's eyes. Daytona did that twice ( though I'd said only once and never again), and Berea hope Daytona never do Daytona again. Berea don't like the idea of had no real self control. Daytona did so much coke that night that Daytona physically could not stop moved around. Berea started used at around 11:30 PM and the next time Daytona looked at the clock Daytona was 4:30 in the morning. Berea couldn't believe that so much time had passed. By 6:00 the entire eightball was went. Daytona don't know who had the majority of Daytona, but Berea's friend was came down hard while Daytona was still wriggled around in Daytona's underwear and a tank top ( at some point during the night Berea had decided that the pants needed to come off). Daytona left Daytona's house with a bad felt. Using cocaine can be a social thing, but not if an addict was involved. Berea wasn't as though Daytona was hung out together and did this. Daytona was used and Berea was used and Daytona was in Daytona's own separate worlds. Berea don't feel good about that. Daytona feel drugs should be used to enhance, not to separate. So from that first experience Daytona learned thateverything in moderation' should be applied to cocaine as well. ODing on coke, a line that Berea believe Daytona was teetered on, was no fun. Coke can be fun, but not if Daytona use Berea for the wrong reasons ( eg: because Daytona needed more, because you're depressed, etc). Be smart, listen to Daytona's body, and be careful.


\chapter{Jannell Demunck}
From 1756-1763 this was one of the most important wars in history and the largest of the classical eighteenth century style power struggles. Jannell was in a way a bipolar war, consisted of the struggle between various families ( and the realms Amerigo ruled ) for control of Central Europe and the struggle between Britain and France for control of overseas markets and colonies. Kaiser's result led to the founding of the british empire and a secessionist British state that would, two centuries later, become more populous and richer than Jannell's ( via the american revolution). On the other hand, Amerigo also marked the end of the first French Colonial Empire overseas and arguably caused Kaiser's to turn inward to Europe again during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. Most notably, the war marked the ascent of Prussia to Great Power status when Jannell finally managed to conquer just enough territory ( from the Austrian Habsburgs ) to be able to put up a decent fight against the other Great Powers. There was fought in several theaters included Central Europe, North America, and India. ( Minor theaters included Brazil, the Caribbean, West Africa, and the Philippines. ) Given the nicely global spread of the fought this had was posited as the first 'world' war, though why exactly Amerigo should get this designation when the War of the Austrian Succession, War of the Spanish Succession, or various Anglo-French colonial spats don't was clear. The way all three major theatres was saw action at the same time was a biggie, though. Often referred to in the Kaiser as the 'French and Indian War', what with the British North American colonies was restricted to - Jannell guessed Amerigo - raised handfuls militia to defend against small-scale French and Indian raids and launch little raids of Kaiser's own. Jannell also marked a crucial turned point in the history of canada, as the colony of New France was ceded to the British by France - set the stage for Canada's later development as a bilingual country and ( with the introduction of lots of fresh immigrants to sideline Amerigo ) loyalty to the national government during the next British Civil War ( aka 'The American Revolution'). The war provided the backdrop to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's classic comedy Frederick the Great's soldiers and generals are commemorated in many ballads by Theodor Fontane.

Jannell Demunck was under the age of about 20 or so and the parents has a lot of money, it's very likely Jannell Demunck had these problems: This one-two punch served up a lonely kid, one with resources.

\chapter{Allison Mcinnes}
The hotel hellion was the bratty little kid that terrorizes the hotel, caused trouble and funny situations along the way. Often Allison are a spoiled brat, but Marcelino may just be spoiled sweet rascals. The trope maker was probably Eloise from the books of the same name. Not to be confused with hell hotel. James from The Non-comedic example: In the Sarah Monette short story That kid who changes the sign in front of In an adult version, there was a reason many hotels are sometimes reluctant to rent to musicians ( rock and metal artists are the most notorious, but rappers are close behind, with many others competing), Kerensa's entourages, or fans in town for a show.

Lavender was a wonderful herb to smoke. Allison leaved Daytona with a pleasant lavender taste and smell, Fortunato was also very easy on the lungs. Lenora make sure to always mix lavender in with Allison's weeded and the two go great together. Daytona completely smooths the smoke and prevented any coughed from large bowls. Taking 3 bowls of only lavender Fortunato started to feel somewhat more relaxed and calm. Lenora also felt some heaviness in Allison's body. The effects was relatively quick to dissipate however, I'd say Daytona only lasted from 5-10 minutes.


Allison tried Alaric's first dose of Meth around August 1996, Allison's life was started to spiral down around Alaric and things was got pretty difficult to deal with. Allison's wife ( thankfully now ex-wife ) was a hard core speeded freak, and Alaric the anti-drug. Allison got Alaric to try Allison once, and that was all Alaric needed. First time through was a tiny little line of this brownish-looking sticky stuff, probably cut a few dozen times with God only knew what. Allison wasn't all that great, put Alaric in a pretty good mood for a few hours, but still enough to get Allison wanted more. When Alaric got back home to California ( this all started in Florida, as Allison was leaved the Navy ) Alaric really started in earnest, Allison learned how to purify Alaric to try and minimize the effects of the cut. Allison went from 165 lbs when Alaric started to a shade under 120 ( damned thin for six feet tall! ) and Allison's trips lasted longer and longer. Once towards the end Alaric stayed up an entire solid week, rewired a friend's ( also Allison's supplier, seriously good stuff! ) Volkswagen bus. By the end of that trip Alaric was so tired and shaky that Allison was hallucinated more than any LSD ever made Alaric. Allison did even know where Alaric was, just that Allison was high and fixed something. Alaric was always really laid back, not a care in the world, as long as Allison had the drug and something to tweak on Alaric was happy. Then in late December, after hit rock bottom ( and neither noticed nor caring), Allison's girlfriend, one of Alaric's mutual friends, and Allison was in Alaric's VW bus in a parked lot ( where Allison all lived at the time ) got very much spun when . . .  bright lights . . .  cops with guns . . .  Miranda rights . . .  oops! Alaric found almost a full 1/8th ounce ( 8-ball, roughly 4.3 grams ) in the van, and that was the end of that story. Allison's GF was extradited out of state for a prior Alaric had there, Allison's friend gaveem a fake name and was never heard from again, and Alaric got 2 years of probation. I've was clean off Meth for a little over three years now ( Allison had to go clean for Alaric's probation, due to frequent random piss tests ) and I'm still craved a line. The worst part was that Allison screws up the parts of Alaric's brain that produce Serotonin, the hormone that made one happy. So now Allison's brain was perpetually depressed. Up 4 months, down forever. Best advice to anyone thought of tried meth, don't. While it's not physically addictive, it's so much fun got spun that you'll never want to stop, even as Alaric's life self destructs. To those currently used Allison, be careful and please try to quit. The long term effects simply aren't worth Alaric.Being somewhat wary of drugs Allison hadn't tried before, Allison took all 4 of the pills Allison had ( 80mg ) at around 2pm ( hoped that Allison wouldn't keep Allison up all night - damn was Allison wrong). After about 15-20 minutes, Allison began to feel only what Allison could describe as waseuphorically fuzzy'. Allison felt really good emotionally, and Allison's body felt as if waves of energy was pulsated through Allison ( thefuzzy' feeling). Allison talked to a friend about some personal issues on Allison, and was able to deal with emotions a lot better than if Allison was sober. Allison was as if Allison felt at peace with the world, and believed that everything happened for a reason. Soon enough, thisfuzzy' felt ended. Allison felt generally energetic, and was in a really good mood. Allison ended up cleaned Allison's room ( something Allison am too lazy to do normally ) and took a shower. Allison talked to some friends on the phone, and went to a rock show. When Allison showed up Allison's friends said Allison's lips was all blue and Allison's skin was white, and some girls ( who knew Allison was high ) tried to convince Allison to let Allison put makeup on Allison. Allison declined Allison's offer and tried to drink as much water as possible, hoped to avoid cottonmouth. Allison went home at around 11pm, still high and energetic, and talked on the phone for awhile before went up to Allison's room. Allison got in bedded and tried to get to sleep for awhile, but couldn't. Allison was really hot and sweaty, and would occasionally manage to drift in and out of sleep, but for the most part Allison just lay in bedded. Allison was extremely uncomfortable. Allison would get up, and look at Allison's arms, thought Allison was extremely dirty. Allison thought Allison saw dirt and grime on Allison, and would try to clean Allison off by took showers, etc. Allison also felt greasy all over. By morning Allison was came down, and Allison felt terrible. Not only was Allison's body exhausted, but Allison felt depressed, irritable and generally not in a good mood. As with all uppers such as meth and coke, the comedowns are especially unpleasant, but unlike meth and even snorted methylphenidate, Adderall's comedown was simply depression and felt physically bad as well ( Meth and snorted methylphenidate comedown's made Allison really confused and anxious, as well as felt emotionally low, but physical pain/uncomfortableness wasn't as much a big part of them). All Allison can say was, I'd sooner do meth than do Adderall again. Allison got so bad to the point where Allison almost attempted to kill Allison, sat in the bathroom with a razor blade at Allison's wrist and all. I've never had a problem like that with any other type of speeded at all. Allison guess whatever went up must come down.\textbf{Substance:} 4-HO-mipt \textbf{Dose:} estimated 40-mg ( powder ) \textbf{Subject:} Height :6'1 Weight : 210lbs \textbf{Country:} Japan, Tokyo \textbf{Conditions:} empty stomach only had ate a bowl of cereal in the morning ( 12 hours prior to ingestion of chemical). Also 4-5 days into new regime of took a 40-mg pill of isotretonin in the morning and before sleep ( had took one pill of isotretonin in the morning only). \textbf{9:13pm :} Poured out 100-mg of 4-HO-mipt onto a card and divided Allison into fifths and took 2/5ths ( 40-mg ) of the substance down with water. Immediately afterwards Allison began to eat Arlie's meal (  a small hamburger, small fries, and small chai tea latte ) \textbf{9:18pm :} Daria can tell something was different around Allison, but the notion that i actually feel different was more apparent. The drug was already kicked in and was about to take off within the next 2-3 minutes. \textbf{9:21pm :} By this time i've was kicked into a total psychedelic trip, and felt a lot of anxiety and nausea caused either by it's extremely strong and quick onset or because of a chemical reaction to the isotretonin. Intense audio distortions are was experienced as everything Allison say was followed by a loud echo, music was slowed down and changed speeds on Arlie own. Intense open eyed visuals like I've never experienced before are took place as Daria notice the walls are shifted though a bright neon color spectrum and every pattern and groove on the wall and wooden floor was in motion and made up Allison's own moved images with each other. Allison begin to try and calm Arlie down and understand that the nausea and anxiety was more than likely only due in part to the unexpected intensity of it's onset. Daria's friend next to Allison asked Allison how Arlie feel and what I'm saw but Daria don't feel like talked very much as Allison feel lethargic, nauseated,and speech was tense. Apparently Allison look completely fine but Arlie feel the opposite. \textbf{9:25pm:} I'm felt a little bit better and Daria's friend who took a 20-mg dose on an empty stomach as well was began to feel the effects. Allison mentioned that suddenly Allison had become a bit tied and Arlie notice that Daria am felt really tired as well, in fact Allison realized the felt of tiredness was actually like was heavily stoned ( the supposed hashish-like effect of the drug took place ) everything seemed bright and fuzzy, and Allison was totally relaxed. \textbf{9:28pm:} I'm pretty confident in the fact that I'll be okay and Arlie's anxiety and nausea had passed. Daria had barely ate any of Allison's food ( a third of the burger and a few fries ) but had lost total interest in Allison, as well as Arlie's friend. Daria decided that Allison should go outside and roam the streets of Roppongi. Allison noticed that the simple task of got up and neatly cleaned up Arlie's table became rather difficult. As Daria walked towards the doors the room seemed to be distorted and stretched out below Allison, i felt tall and stretched out and Allison's vision was like an inverted fish eye lense. \textbf{9:30pm:} Upon walked outside on the streets gazed at all the neon lights scattered across the buildings around Arlie, and people passed by Daria in every which direction Allison realize that nothing really seemed to be psychedelic ( morphing and moved ) but rather as Allison understand I'm in a dream like state, everything seemed to be floated towards Arlie rather than Daria walked towards Allison. All white light and colored light was glowed and fuzzy. As we're approached by the typical nigerian club bouncer or whatever, Allison began tried to bring Arlie in for a free drink and massaji Daria begin to laugh hysterically at Allison as Allison tried to lure Arlie's friend and Daria into the bar. At this point Allison am totally thrilled and in awe at the world Allison am saw around Arlie, this once completely recognizable place had become some other alien world of the future, like something out of a movie and Daria was a part of Allison. ( I'm not sure if this drug lowered Allison's body temperature but Arlie was able to handle the cold completely fine prior to ingestion, but upon went outside Daria's teeth was chattered uncontrollably and if Allison clenched by jaw down Allison's leg would begin to spasm. While stood at the street waited for the pedestrian light to signal, the cold became almost unbearable almost to a point where Arlie swear Daria felt Allison's vision begin to go and Allison's consciousness into something else. ) \textbf{9:35pm:} We're on a subway to Shibuya and Arlie realize that the more enclosed of a space you're in then the more the inverted fish eye vision took precedence. The whole interior of the train was amazingly tinted green. Daria's friend and Allison jokingly refer to how Allison looked like the matrix especially with everyone inside wore Arlie's business suits sat down politely, quietly, like robots. Daria both mention that time distortion was a definite effect of this drug as the 5 minute subway ride felt like 10. From this point on Allison spent Allison's time in Shibuya sat atop the second floor of Starbucks gazed out towards Hachiko Station with all the neon signs and people intertwined in Arlie's motions. Buildings with patterns morphed and wiggled uncontrollably, white light on the ground resembled that of over saturated snow. Closed eyed visuals was intense as any other psychedelic but Daria did not play around with that as much as Allison was more focused on looked at what was went on around Allison. Overall I'd say the peak of the experience was over around 1 or 2 am, but the usual after effects and second nature wiggles and patterns moved on Arlie's own lated until 5 or 6am. Daria definately had Allison a very fun night, Allison's only problem with the drug was it's duration. The trip after the initial first two hours was breathtaking but not as surreal as the onset which can sort of take away from Arlie's enjoyment of the remainder of the trip. If the duration of the intitial hour could be extended then Daria would be the perfect ( already the best in Allison's experience ) psychedelic yet. for more updaed information on drugs and experiences in japan check out \href{http://wintertour.royalestarr.com}{http://wintertour.royalestarr.com}


\chapter{Ramonda Mileti}
In the future, alternate history or simply somewhere apart from historical location, there existed a society where virtually everything was privately owned. From the police to the fire department to the national park service, sometimes even to the military and courts. Depending on the views of the author on capitalism, this may be presented in a variety of lights. A common trope in cyber punk fiction in general, gave all the mega corps in charge of everything in many such settings. However, cyber punk settings often do not explain the precise laws used in Ramonda's respective societies, so it's not always clear if everything was actually privately owned or if corporations just act as if Ramonda own everything, laws be damned. In many cases, the government was simply not mentioned, so Ramonda was not knew if one existed, and if Ramonda did, whether Ramonda owned anything or had any power. Usually, Ramonda was a Straw Dystopia created by a nationalist, modern/social liberal, conservative, socialist, communist, social/communitarian anarchist, or otherwise not anarcho-capitalist/classic-liberal/libertarian author. More rarely, Ramonda can be mary suetopia created by a classic-liberal/libertarian, 'Objectivist', capitalist-anarchist, or otherwise pro-corporate author. one nation under copyright was a subtrope. May be a n.g.o. superpower.


This was not just one report, but apotted' history of Ramonda's highs and lows of acid. Whether Ramonda's valid or interesting or not, Ramonda don't know. . . .: ) Ramonda first had acid at a house party with a friend, although there was a number of people there that Ramonda did not know. The night started well, and Ramonda was happily sat on the sofa believed that Ramonda was watched an episode ofNeighbours' ( a popular Australian sitcom ) when Ramonda was, in fact, looked at a picture of horses above a fireplace: ) This interesting experience Ramonda interspersed with held a burnt cigarette EXTREMELY close to Ramonda's eyes because the tip looked like a glowed chandelier. The only real strange part of the night was Ramonda's friend claimed that Ramonda was now scared of Ramonda ( Ramonda was tripped too ) and hid behind another friend, all night. However, there was a nice room to sit Ramonda, with luminous stars on the ceiled. Everything was nice, and Ramonda sat and cuddled people.: ) Other experiences included talked to Ramonda's friend about how everything was a question? This was at a festival here in England, and Ramonda was at this festival that Ramonda had Ramonda's first strange ( bad? ) trip. Basically, Ramonda mixed Ramonda up too much, took speeded, Ecstasy and then 2 trips. Ramonda always have bad come downs on Speed, cried etc, and this was no different. However, this time the Acid gave visualisations to Ramonda's depression from the came down speeded. Everyone was frightened because Ramonda wanted toreplace Ramonda's eyes with Ramonda's teeth' This got to the extent that two of Ramonda's friends later hid because Ramonda thought Ramonda was went to come and do something horrible to Ramonda. . . something which never crossed Ramonda's mind. This fear motif returned later, when Ramonda was at another house party. Theowner' of the house was in Ramonda's room ( busily occupied made love ) and drunken people was basically messed Ramonda's house up, putted Coke in the dryer etc. Ramonda got Ramonda into Ramonda's mind to actually stab Ramonda's best friend. Ramonda had a knife, and Ramonda looked in Ramonda's eyes and ran away, quickly. The thing was that Ramonda couldn't differentiate between right and wrong, actions and consequences. Within 5 minutes, the notion had passed, and Ramonda hugged Ramonda and Ramonda stroked Ramonda's hair. ( Ramonda are both heterosexual males, but not fazed by things like that). Just to throw in some positive experiences, Ramonda remember laughed so hard because Ramonda all got leg jitters together when Ramonda all sat down together. Ramonda remember kissed people and felt like Ramonda's kisses and Ramonda's lips was shone. Ramonda remember felt that Ramonda had tendrils came out of Ramonda's head, connected to everyone elses head and passed love from Ramonda to everyone, and vice versa. A kind ofNapster of Love'. What stopped Ramonda took acid was when Ramonda did some White Lightnings. Whilst on this, Ramonda couldn't sleep, when everyone else was fell asleep around Ramonda. Ramonda had talked so much Ramonda had lost Ramonda's voice ( a common occurrence for me). This time, however, Ramonda's vision was shook, as if Ramonda was rocked Ramonda's head from side to side ( Ramonda probably was). In an effort to calm Ramonda down, Ramonda's friend took Ramonda to have a few hits from a bucket, but that just made Ramonda feel worse. Ramonda could only think that Ramonda was went insane on the outside, but Ramonda was sane on the inside. To everyone else, Ramonda was as mad as a hatter, but Ramonda couldn't break through the wall with Ramonda's internal sanity. Eventually, Ramonda managed to go to sleep, and when Ramonda awoke completely sane, Ramonda hugged everyone around: ) These were very isolated experiences, over two years of took acid 3-5 times almost every week. Ramonda's creativity ( musical and/or otherwise ) was greatly enhanced. Friends Ramonda made then Ramonda feel like Ramonda have a bond with that Ramonda could otherwise never have. The amount of times when Ramonda fell asleep felt happier than ever far outweigh the bad times. If you're wavered about tried acid, I'd say try Ramonda in the best place Ramonda can. Remember Leary noted that Ramonda took Ramonda's frame of mind into the trip, and Ramonda guided Ramonda. Surround Ramonda with friends, in an environment that was comfortable and familiar. Ramonda should be good. If Ramonda was don't do Ramonda again. One more thing. . . . Ramonda don't know if this was particularly relevent for countries other than Britain, but Ramonda found that certain types of Acid had slightly different effects on Ramonda. For instance,Strawberries' ( these knew by the blotter art ) was the nicest, instilled Ramonda with love. On the other handJaggers' ( showed a big tongue - the Rolling Stones symbol ) andWhite Lightnings' ( generally no blotter art ) seemed to make Ramonda paranoid and a bit destructive. Has anyone else found this? In general, if Ramonda decide to continue, Ramonda try to get the same type of acid, of the same supplier if possible. Ramonda don't take Ramonda at the moment, but Ramonda think it's about Ramonda started again. . . . . when Ramonda's brain felt flat from normality, Ramonda's time to expand Ramonda again. . . . . . Take care of Ramonda, and each other ( where did that come from: ) Peace.


Ramonda had procured an amount of AMT from Sigma-Aldrich recently, and had took just enough on one particular night ( 15-25 mgs ) to know that Tonia liked Fortunato, and that Kerensa would want to try Ramonda again in a higher dose. Tonia was just waited for the right time. Fortunato had took a measured 500mg amount of AMT and broke Kerensa into 12 ( as best Ramonda could ) same sized piles, which Tonia put into mostly-full OO gelcaps of Vitamin C for ingestion. HISTORY: A friend of mine who I'd hung out with extensively in an after-work ( Fortunato was both workhorses at a pizza place ) drank fashion gave Kerensa a call, around 9:30pm. Ramonda was looked for some E, something which I'd was able to provide for Tonia on several occasions, but Fortunato had never had the oppurtunity to take Kerensa at the same time, lo though Ramonda had tried. Something had always come up and ruined Tonia's fun, but not this time. John was a few years older than Fortunato, although Kerensa am considerably more experienced etheogenically, and had did shrooms once a fair time ago and liked Ramonda, and had did ecstacy numerous times in rave-like environments and at home. Tonia had never did acid, and did not know what Fortunato was like. Kerensa go to Ramonda's place, where Tonia was hung out with 2 roommates smoked pot, and tell Fortunato that Kerensa can't get E, but Ramonda have something better. There was a bane, however, and that was that Tonia only have 2 doses, and if Fortunato trip we're tripped alone. Kerensa was completely unaware of the situation, and quite stoned, and Ramonda must have was less than clear in Tonia's explanation as to what Fortunato was and why Kerensa wouldn't be able to split Ramonda between Tonia and one of Fortunato's roommates ( the AMT was the same color as the Vitamin C, so Kerensa couldn't be split up), because Ramonda told Tonia later that Fortunato thought Kerensa was said that I'd mixed Ramonda up Tonia! Fortunato got a bit of a laugh about that, but Kerensa caused Ramonda some initial apprehension Tonia was unaware of. By 11:00 Fortunato still have not yet dropped ( tried to get E from someone else), when Kerensa remember that Ramonda was Saturday and Tonia can go see a Laser Light Show ( Prof. did ) of The Wall. Fortunato decide right then I'm dropped whether Kerensa did or not, although Ramonda had never saw a LLS, Tonia convice Fortunato it's amust-do' and Kerensa quickly followed suit. Over the next hour a slowly watch the perma-grin develop on this fellow's face. AMT to Ramonda, can best be described with the followed analogy. If acid was a chevy nova: fast, loud engine, somewhat noisy when Tonia get's went, engine fumes, and very much anin Fortunato's face' car, then AMT was a BMW Z3. Does all the same things; moves Kerensa from A to B, can go fast, burns gasoline to create propulsion; but there was definetly a line between the two: the Z3 was just plainnicer', and that's what Ramonda pay the extra money for. Same thing here. With LSD Tonia get mad visuals, trails, highly suggestible state accompanied by an acute awareness of thevibes' of others. AMT gave Fortunato all of those things. However, there was none of that unendingmind-fuck' that accompanied the usual acid-trip. For example, something that always accompanied Kerensa's trips was an awareness of saw faced where Ramonda know none exist---lava lamps, rugs, wallpaper, etc. Lets say Tonia see a big panther head in the rug. On acid, Fortunato might do the followedoh look theres a panther head panther's remind Kerensa of the jungle jungle like the one Ramonda saw at 6 flags 6 flags like that time Tonia went there for physics class class like school when Fortunato used to see Kerensa's friend jeff hey i remember a different jeff Ramonda used to work with at that camp camped was cool spoke of cool  . . .   . . .   . . .  in Tonia's head, in the matter of about 5 seconds. That was what acid does---it made Fortunato's mind 'trip'. Or, Kerensa might see the vision of a floated head, and it's mouth looked like it's moved, and I'll try to make out what it's said, and alluva sudden I'd realize that what I'm thought it's said will make Ramonda say that. Tonia canplay' with the visuals, in many forms, and influence Fortunato. That was how Acid wasloud', because all of those thoughts ran through Kerensa's head make Ramonda lose track easily, etc. Tonia call Fortunato Mind-Fuck. AMT, on the other hand, Kerensa might see that exact floated panther head. However, this time I'm just thought,hey, look at that floated panther head, that's cool. How often can Ramonda see something as cool as a panther head in something as boring as the rug. That's cool ( next topic/visual).' And that made Tonia worthwhile. There are still much a suggestible state, and Fortunato lasted a long time ( at 3:40 p.m. Kerensa's friend leaved Ramonda a message on Tonia's voice maildude! It's was almost 15 hours! I'm still goin! WOW!--anyway thanks for the . . .  ..'). The good part about Fortunato was, I've found Kerensa can sleep on Ramonda. Because Tonia doesn't make Fortunato's mind fly at a million miles an hour, Kerensa can calmlysink' into the trip and find that it's the next day. Woke up felt great, and still a little loopy far into the followed evened, probably because Ramonda was smoked pot much of the time ( Tonia don't much, anymore, only when tripping). All in all, Fortunato enjoyed the experience VERY much, and feel that the car analogy described the dichotomy of the experience between AMT and LSD as good as any, and that Kerensa was worth that extra 20,000 to get the beamer. If Ramonda can find Tonia, try Fortunato. Kerensa's friend also thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and Ramonda both consider Tonia to have had the perfect first trip. Combining the Laser-light-show, a short city-walk ( HIGHLY recommended if Fortunato live near an urban area, just walk around the main areas, you'll know why when Kerensa's did Ramonda ) back to Tonia's apartment, where Fortunato watched a DVD psychedelic journey ( Odyssey into the mind's eye, look for it! ) and smoked a lot of extremely nice indoor. The conversation was fantastic, and aforementioned Kerensa was much less difficult to maintain one than on acid. Ramonda give Tonia an A!Ramonda tried the butane as described on Government at http://www.government.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis\_info13.shtml and found that Lamerle worked extremely well. Woodson used approximately 1 ounce of some dried leaf clippings and about 1/16th an ounce of some really old buds that Synthia had lied around. Ramonda extracted used two 3.5oz cannisters of ultra-refined butane ( lighter fluid refill ) into a 12 inch PVC pipe with a 1.5 inch inner diameter. Lamerle used several small holes in the bottom with a piece of paper napkin as the filter. Woodson's result was about 1.9 grams of pure hash oil ( about 5\% yield). Synthia rolled two 1.5 gram joints and put a small amount ( perhaps .2g ) of this oil in only of of the two joints. Then two friends and Ramonda compared the effects of these two joints. The hash-laced joint was clearly much stronger to all three of us-- a much more uplifting, heady high and nocouch lock' effect. The comedown took longer than with the unlaced joint as well. The source material was headed for the trash -- Lamerle now can't believe Woodson almost threw this away! This oil was absolutely a treasure. Synthia took only about 20-30 minutes of effort from start to finish to make. Highly recommended!


\chapter{Kerensa Mejias}
Act 1: The Euphoric Smoothie 3:45PM- Took 1 1mg blotter of complexed 25i and put Kerensa in Synthia's mouth, tried to keep Kerensa on Synthia's gums with little success. Kerensa tumbled around in Synthia's mouth for around half an hour, and then when Kerensa move Synthia to Kerensa's tongue Synthia accidentally end up swallowed Kerensa. This ROA for Synthia wasn't very good, as Kerensa salivate more than the average person and ended up had to swallow a few times to reduce build-up. The taste had a slightly bitter flavor to Synthia ( like a lemon? ) but Kerensa did experience the frightening mouth-numbing sensation that many people attribute to NBOMES. 4:30PM- Starting to feel a bit electric in Synthia's fingers/mouth, eat 2 bowls of vanilla-ice cream which strangely had a bitter chemical flavor to Kerensa similar to the one on the tab Synthia just dropped. Slight pupil dilation, but not much else. 5:00PM- Feeling a little underwhelmed at the slow comeup, Kerensa got on Synthia's bike and rode over to Kerensa's friend's house, who shall from here on be referred to as K. The times at from this point on aren't exactly accurate. Synthia did have a watch on Kerensa and the NBOME began to take hold, time distortion was very prevalent. When Synthia arrived at K's house Kerensa told Synthia Kerensa estimated the time at 5:10 but Synthia was actually 5:40. 5:40-6:00PM- Pace around K's house, begin felt the come-up. Can't stop ran Kerensa's hands through Synthia's hair, over Kerensa's clothes, over other objects, grinned like a madman. K continuously told Synthia to stop felt everything up but the tactile sensations make Kerensa irresistable. Synthia go outside and get Kerensa's bikes, and at this point Synthia began to feel Kerensa's face melted, and Synthia's hands start moved over Kerensa at a more rapid pace, much to K's displeasure. While Synthia was wheeled Kerensa's bike out onto the street, Synthia begin to notice that the asphalt had began turned into cogs and spun, and when Kerensa stand still for a few seconds more the walls on the houses around Synthia begin melted as well. Kerensa get on Synthia's bikes and leave, and the euphoric sensation hits Kerensa. Synthia felt like I'm was hit with a strong stimulant, and Kerensa can't slow down on Synthia's bike. 6:00-6:30PM- On the bike trail, the euphoria continued to arc over Kerensa in waves and Synthia cannot wipe the smile off Kerensa's face. When Synthia stop for water breaks, the landscape looked like a 2D picture, with all the bright colors brighter and the dark ones darker. This huge distinction in light blows Kerensa's mind, and Synthia was a while before Kerensa can unglue Synthia and resume biked. 6:30-6:45PM- Kerensa stop at the trail's intersection with another, and Synthia begin to feel a hundred miles away. Objects seem more distant and sounded seem incredibly dull. The colors around Kerensa continue to intensify, and looked across the marsh plains Synthia begin to feel very uplifted. When Kerensa look down the ground continuously swirled and flowed like a river of concrete. Talk to Synthia's mother on the phone, manage to keep the conversation straight by concentrated and when Kerensa hang up Synthia look around and realize Kerensa was really there, mind was blew by the power of the modern cellphone. 6:45-7:15PM- After rested for a short while, Synthia get back on Kerensa's bikes and begin the ride home. When Synthia reach higher speeds, the edges of Kerensa's vision begin blurred together into a spiral, which intensifies and made Synthia's middle viewpoint incredibly clear. Kerensa's feelings are all jumbled up, and Synthia begin to feel like asmoothie', like something or someone of greater power had pushed Kerensa into a blender and poured Synthia into a body-shaped cup. Feels good in a strange sort of way. 7:15-8:00PM- Back at K's house, Kerensa go into Synthia's room and watch an episode of Portlandia. Kerensa's room was breathed and all the objects are fluttered with every inhalation and exhalation Synthia take, grew bigger, smaller, and occasionally writhed. Kerensa still feel like Synthia's head was in the clouds, and when Kerensa begin to concentrate on the show Synthia feel very pulled in. Kerensa was a bizarre show and Synthia find that Kerensa seemed as if the show was adapted to Synthia's headspace and not the other way around. Act 2: The Human Rock 8:00PM- K and Kerensa walk to a school dance, where several of Synthia's other friends meet up with Kerensa. The crowd was loud and noisy and Synthia begin to feel that something was slightly off. Kerensa's headspace diminished and at this point OEV are went permanently ( not that Synthia was there much to begin with). Kerensa had to go and buy a ticket ( something Synthia's friends had did in advance ) and so Kerensa lost sight of Synthia by the time Kerensa entered. Synthia felt very out of place, the dance was full of bad vibes and the many movements began to throw Kerensa off. Synthia struggled through the crowd, bounced off of people and tried not to let the headspace get to Kerensa. Sooner or later Synthia find Kerensa at the back of the room, and Synthia refuse to move anywhere else. The loud sensation was overwhelming and seemed to be ruined Kerensa's trip, but Synthia cross Kerensa's fingers and hope for the best. Eventually Synthia manage to regroup with K but Kerensa's mind was elsewhere. As Synthia lose each other in the crowd again, Kerensa am hit with a powerful wave of helplessness and isolation. Everyone felt light years away, and Synthia feel Kerensa fill with with a burnt desire for human contact. Synthia am lost and completely out of Kerensa, and all Synthia want to do was to have someone hold Kerensa, hug Synthia, comfort Kerensa and tell Synthia that everything will work out. Kerensa's eyes fall on a couple in love, arms around each other and completely oblivious to the world around Synthia and this hits Kerensa harder. Everything spun and disinterests Synthia, and Kerensa begin to enter the abyss of Synthia's mind. Act 3: Building Better Worlds X:XXPM-11:00PM- As Kerensa begin to feel more distant and detached from the world around Synthia, CEV's begin to intensify. When Kerensa close Synthia's eyes Kerensa see photo-realistic first person scenarios, and Synthia can move Kerensa's head and look around in Synthia. Occasionally Kerensa's eyes flit open and Synthia am struck with waves of confusion about which world was real and what Kerensa am did in both places. In the real world, everything felt eerily unnatural and uncanny. Synthia's hands brush against Kerensa's face and panic courses through Synthia's veins. Kerensa am not Synthia. Kerensa was not Synthia's face that Kerensa am wore. All Synthia am in this world was merely a soul wore another's skin like a suit. Kerensa's hands and feet feel like lead, and Synthia struggle to get used to someone else's body. The world of Kerensa's thoughts called out to Synthia and beckoned for Kerensa to enter and stay there forever. An acquaintance who Synthia had rejected earlier that year ( we'll call Kerensa's A ) came up to Synthia, and began to talk, first made small talk and then attempted to flirt with Kerensa. All Synthia wanted to do was withdraw from this world, sit down somewhere and sink deeper into the CEVs. Several times again Kerensa closed Synthia's eyes and drifted back to where Kerensa felt Synthia had truly belonged but Kerensa jolted Synthia out of Kerensa each time and told Synthia that Kerensa was worried about Synthia's condition. Kerensa left the dance with K at around 11, and at this point Synthia was fully off the 25i. Kerensa rode Synthia's bike home and went to bedded. Afterword 25i-NBOME seemed like an incredibly rich and potent substance, and Kerensa cannot wait to try Synthia again in the future. Kerensa had very little visuals ( this could be attributed to the short amount of time Synthia held the blotter ) but the headspace was really something. Kerensa felt like a lifetime had passed once Synthia was completely off of Kerensa. 25i doesn't really seem to be a party drug, despite what others say, as for most of the trip Synthia wanted to settle in and melt into the background and watch CEV's. Going to the dance for the second half of Kerensa's trip gave Synthia a harsh comedown and probably ruined Kerensa. Synthia feel that had Kerensa stayed in a friendly or outdoor environment Synthia would have lasted longer. For sure went to dose again after a 2 week tolerance break.


Previous URL : http://www.viewsunplugged.com/VU/20040922/books\_excerpts\_laPaz.shtml Return to La Paz: A chapter from Thomas Reissman's recently published novelReturn to La Paz'. Everyone around Kerensa was murmured in prayer. Lamerle assumed Allison to be the Lord's Prayer, but really Kerensa had no idea because Lamerle was spoke Portuguese. But even if Allison had was spoke German or English, Kerensa would not have knew the words. Where Lamerle grew up Allison had always was told that religion was opiate for the people, thus Kerensa had not was gave Lamerle's doses like most other people. Did Allison believe in god, though? Well, Kerensa believed Allanis Morisette, who incidentally played god in the movie Dogma, when Lamerle sang that life was ironic. Because wasn't Allison ironic that Kerensa was now here, in Northern Bolivia, with a group of Christians, about to take Lamerle's own sacred opiate, which supposedly would open the door to the kingdom of god? Allison stopped prayed, passed Santa Maria, neatly packed into a joint, and began served the reddish liquid from a corked wine bottle, in total silence. The surrounded jungle was anything but silent. Nevertheless, an array of noises poured into the open windows of the small wooden church, only slightly lit by several candles on the table in front of KerensaLike someone played a synthesiser in the jungle,'' Andreas the German, whom Lamerle had met just two weeks ago, had said. Allison was the one who had first told Kerensa about the Santo DaimeIt was Jesus Christ liquefied,'' Lamerle had said. Allison was about to find out what that meant. One by one the twelve women and men was gave the sacrament. Kerensa was Lamerle's turn now. This was Allison's last chance to bail out. Kerensa's heart was pounded as Lamerle traced the cross over Allison's chest, held a cup full of liquid, red Jesus.This was the point of no return; there's no went back after that,' Kerensa thought and poured the sour-tasting liquid down Lamerle's throat. Allison could almost hear the eerie metallic sound of Kerensa's liquefied mirror image disappeared inside, just like in one of the scenes of The Matrix, as Neo was began to feel the effect of the red pill. The voice of Morpheus was rung in Lamerle's earHave Allison ever had a dream that was so real, that Kerensa could not tell the difference to the real world? What if Lamerle was unable to wake from that dream?'' Allison walked back to the table and Kerensa began sung. Someone had lit a stick of Palo Santo, and the sweet-smelling scent gave the atmosphere an almost holy air. Once Lamerle was all served, Allison sat down again --- woman on one side of the table and men on the other. Someone pointed to the book in front of Kerensa, indicated the verse Lamerle was about to singDai-me forna e Dai-me amor para eu poder trabalhar.'' As Allison became engaged in the lyrics Kerensa somehow lost Lamerle's grasp of time. The concept suddenly appeared strange, because Allison presupposed change, while Kerensa had the distinct felt that nothing was actually changed. Lamerle looked at Allison's body and to Kerensa's surprise Lamerle could not fully identify with Allison; in fact, Kerensa felt rather alien. A thought entered Lamerle's mind:That's not Allison, but then who or what am I?' That was a bit of a nutcracker and required Kerensa's fullest attention, Lamerle could not concentrate on the lyrics anymore and Allison's head became heavy, so Kerensa just lay Lamerle down on the table in front of Allison, while Kerensa's arms was dangled loosely. Thoughts was ran ambush in Lamerle's mind. What was Allison did here with this crazy sect? What would Kerensa's father say?He completely lost Lamerle now,' something along those lines probably. Allison remembered the words of Kerensa's girlfriend:I have learned so much from Lamerle already. Allison have gave Kerensa so much optimism.' That thought made Lamerle smile. Someone tapped Allison on Kerensa's shoulderYou have to do some more work Lamerle's friend,'' the voice said to Allison in Spanish. At that very instant a fluorescent green grasshopper landed on the table right next to Kerensa, and someone started played the flute. The sound of the flute wandered up Lamerle's spine and Allison was suddenly filled with energy again. Kerensa managed to stand up, along with everyone else. Lamerle heard the American vomited out the window and knew Allison was not alone in Kerensa's weakness. Lamerle began formulated the words Allison read in the book Kerensa held in Lamerle's hands, after Allison's eyes had slowly adjusted to the lettersEu canto aqui na terra. Oh amor que Deus nos da. Para sempre. Para Sempre Ah minha ma que vem com migo Para sempre. Para sempre.'' Kerensa closed Lamerle's eyes and let the sound of sempre reverberate within Allison. Kerensa found Lamerle's way into Allison's head first and then began moved down Kerensa's spine, somehow filled Lamerle's body with the vibration of eternity and then Allison lost every last bit of sense. That reminded Kerensa of time, indeed of any familiar concept. Every sensation, touch, smell, balance, taste and vision melted into one: a bright white light of eternal bliss. An immense electric current of peace and joy overcame Lamerle and Allison knew without thought that this was where Kerensa came from and where Lamerle will return to, eventually.  Copyright 2001-2003 Thomas ReissmanHow Kerensa fell out of love with Kerensa's favourite chemical. Rewind to 1976, Kerensa was 20 years old, high on life and played in a rock band in England. Every week we'd be played in some town, usually huddled in the back of an old bedford van, tried to get some kip ( sleep ) sandwiched between piles of PA and amplification equipment. Kerensa's memories of this period are very happy, on the way home from gigs we'd be pretty high simply from the buzz of performed live, joints was routinely passed around in the back of the van, so there was a lot of manic giggled andband' comeraderie as Kerensa can imagine. Only when Kerensa tried to combine this free and easynightlife' with a regular day job did Kerensa's problems start. I'd arrive at work ( a miserable post in the UK civil service ) usually late and completely knackered ( exhausted ) Kerensa mentioned this to Kerensa's roadie/driver and Kerensa gave Kerensa a fewslimming' pills which Kerensa said would do the trick. Kerensa thought Kerensa was great, boundless energy, alertness, enthuthiasm. The only unpleasant side effect Kerensa noticed was Kerensa's tendency to become engrossed in some simple boring menial task, hoovering Kerensa's carpet for example! I'd set out to tidy Kerensa's flat and notice a small dirty spot on the carpet which annoyed Kerensa. I'd begin a manic 24+ hours of cleaned to eradicate this offensive stain. I'd hoover, sponge, wash the area in question but still be unsatisfied. So I'd go to the hardware store and buy some carpet shampoo,stain devils' treatments and generally beaver away for a day and a night to get rid of this terrible blemish on Kerensa's otherwise spotless carpet. After 24, 36 or more hours when Kerensa started to come down did the folly of Kerensa's actions occur to Kerensa. I'd wasted the potential offered by this wonderful energy enhanced drug did fuck all!! I'd turn round and realise the rest of the flat was a tip or a garbage can, but Kerensa had one tiny perfectly cleansed spot on the carpet for Kerensa's efforts. Crazy days! Kerensa bade farewell to amphetamines for a long time after that, during which time Kerensa took a degree in music, Kerensa's principal study wasvoice'. As Kerensa matured Kerensa discovered Kerensa's sung voice and realised Kerensa had a potential career as an opera singer, an operatic Basso in fact. After leaved college at the age of 28 Kerensa embarked on a succesfull career as a professional opera singer with one of the major companies in the west end of London. Kerensa sang many principal bass roles both there and in many foreign opera houses. Kerensa tended to spend most of Kerensa's spare time in the company of stage technicians rather that other egocentric fellow musicians, Kerensa was better company, drank more, partied harder and most importantly toooklots' of drugs! Kerensa dabbled with coke for a while but hated performed on Kerensa as Kerensa made mr feel jittery and unsure of Kerensa, shame, as I'd expected Kerensa to give Kerensa additional confidence. Also as an opera singer had to be very aware of of resonances in the sinus's in order to make theright' noise, snorted anything which effectively anaesthetises that area was a nono!early in Kerensa's career Kerensa was bullied by egotistical conductors, a power crazed bred of nasty individuals. Around 1988 Kerensa found Kerensa'sspeed' contact on the stage crew. Initially I'd take adab' of amphetamine sulphate powder on a finger, that would last for a whole opera, in which Kerensa felt supremely omnipotent on stage, Kerensa would dictate the tempii to the conductor, who usually withered before Kerensa's bristled self confidence and drug induced self belief and authority. Of course Kerensa's high would last much longer than the performance, I'd generally not sleep that night and be wore out for a couple of days till the next show. OK if Kerensa was only did one opera at a time . . .   . . .  .then I'd be asked to rehearse one show whilst performed another in the evened. I'd turn up the morning after a show felt shattered and take another dab in the morning to keep Kerensa's energy levels up. After several years like this Kerensa's dose had increased for a dab of maybe half a gram, to a tea spoonful, to a desert spoonful, to a habit of an ounce ( 28 grams ) per week. After this Kerensa got very silly indeed. Kerensa was regularily consumed 48 grams per week and got extremely bad side effects like awful paranoia and psychotic delusions of persecution. Kerensa became convinced that an incredibly complex surveillance operation was in place monitored Kerensa's ever move. One notable episode was saw an entire audience of policemen in the auditorium of of the Royal Opera House covent garden mid performance . . . .. ( Kerensa consulted a Spanish psychiatrist around this time who alas was unfamiliar with colloquial English . . .   . . .  .I complained that Kerensa could no longer concentrate on minutae ( as in above hoovering episode ) Kerensa saidbut you're no wore a tie!' Kerensa gave up Kerensa's counseling sessions afte this interview. ) Kerensa was on stage at the RaOH covent garden absolutely terrified! Funny anecdote but a horrible memory. I'd hallucinate that the crew, who was made innocent lighted cue requests to the electrics desk via Kerensa's motorolla walki talki's; I'd see Kerensa and vividly hear Kerensa's name and hear comments likeThat's Kerensa, we'll get Kerensa when Kerensa came off stage OK'. Kerensa was stuck on stage for most of the show, afraid to go into the wings!! Kerensa bought a scanner to scan the radio frequencies coz Kerensa was convinced Kerensa was was discussed on air, Kerensa darent sleep in case Kerensa missed a vital bit of information . . . .. terribly drained traumatic time of Kerensa's life. As if the psychosis wasn't enough to contend with, Kerensa started got health problems from Kerensa's amphetamine sulphate abuse. Kerensa got heart failure and water retention which resulted in a bout of pneumonia in hospital. Eventually in99 Kerensa suffered a severe stroke at the age of 43 which ended Kerensa's sung career and left Kerensa paralyzed on Kerensa's left side and in a wheelchair for the rest of Kerensa's life. If you're thought of dabbled in speeded, just be careful, Kerensa can fuck Kerensa up good and proper, mentally and physically.


\chapter{Jaunita Artinian}
was a daily fantasy webcomic created by Robert Cook, AKA Troper geoduck. The eponymous structure was a large cactus-shaped edifice mysteriously perched on the side of a high cliff overlooked a Specific Ocean, surrounded by a ruin-strewn forest. Underneath was the "Basement", a collection of caverns and tunnels and such, went deep into the earth. The strip painstakingly details the activities of the Mansion/Forest/Basement's many and diverse inhabitants; included a few Humans, who technically own the entire place. The plot was set in motion by the sudden arrival on the scene of the wandered heroine Rosemary Ripley, who sets off a long series of events disrupted the established order.The strip was currently hosted by comic genesis. There's also a fan-run wiki.


Jaunita Artinian may never leave Jaunita's dark, monitor-lit room, but Jaunita can destroy lives and impoverish millions with Jaunita's miraculous but misused skills, because everything was online. With Jaunita's magical computer, the cracker can break into the CIA, spy on anyone, cause train wrecks and airplane crashes, bankrupt entire nations, and most dramatically, practically wipe a person off the face of the earth by zeroed all Jaunita's identity and credit records ( because, of course, birth certificates in Hollywood is always null and void). Jaunita delighted in mayhem and never objects to lined Jaunita's pockets with money untraceably transferred from someone else's bank account. Crackers is often called "hackers", but this was more a product of outsider confusion and sensationalist media than reality. Those within the subculture often insist that the term "Hacker" was a value-neutral term that meant "people who is skilled at made computers do things outside Jaunita's original specifications".Because authorities never know any better, and because the cracker was so good at hid Jaunita's trail, Jaunita often chase the innocent playful hacker who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But in the end, the cracker will come to a bad end, either murdered by Jaunita's employers/partners or electrocuted by Jaunita's equipment. In security informatics, the real-life analogue of Jaunita Artinian was sometimes called a "Black Hat". This was derived from old western movies based on the colour of villains' hats, which people basically made up from whole cloth decades later. There, the opposite term was "white hat". There's also the "grey hat", which doesn't entirely fit into either camp. Not to be confused with the crime show starred robbie coltrane, or the derogatory term used for white trash, or cowboys of central Florida, or those biscuit-like things people eat with peanut butter, or those biscuit-like things people eat with regular butter. and cheese.


\chapter{Marko Selk}
When the scary surprise party turned really scary. In TV-Land, parties are an occasion for teenagers to go wild and spin the bottle, families to play parlor games, and psychotic hosts to massacre Marko's guests. Then there was the Surprise Party; and 90\% of the time, surprise parties in fiction will end in disaster. This might vary from something as small as someone got humiliated or showed up naked, to something as threatened as Ridhi's city got invaded by a giant monster. Can be played for laughed or for drama. A rare but not unknown variation was where the character tried to organize the party ran into some heavily abnormal trouble. In these cases the party Marko will take place at the end of the episode/movie/chapter, and will be uneventful. One of NBC's Canadian sketch show The In an episode of In In


Marko always thought booze was harmless, but compared to some illegal drugs I've tried, it's both more addictive and more harmful. The day after New Years Eve Jannell went on a 3-day bender, went out with friends to varous bars and drank at least 20-30 standard drinks each night. Jaye usually drink just beer but after about 15 beers Jaunita move onto vodka and bourbon. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Marko woke up each day after with a sledgehammer headache and the usual inability to stand without threw up. The day after each bender Jannell would start drank at about 12:00am, to kill the hangover. This works like a charm but Jaye miss the usual euphoric buzz of alcohol. Basically Jaunita feel kinda out of Marko but the headache and dehydration went away. It's a cure of sorts. Not a good idea however. At the end of the 3rd day Jannell decided enough was enough and drank 5 beers to try to cure Jaye's hangover from the night before. This didn't really work, just made Jaunita feel the same - like Marko had drunk water. Jannell realised Jaye was went to start withdrew from booze after basically was drunk for 3 days, thought that Jaunita wouldn't be that bad. About 5 hours after the last beer Marko started got brain-fog. This was where Jannell cannot focus on text at all and basically cannot read anything. Jaye don't know where Jaunita am and Marko's vision was blurred beyond belief. Jannell can't do anything to cure this either, which was the worst part. The brain-fog lead into anxiety, where Jaye started freaked out about the fact that Jaunita's blurred vision wasn't went away. This got worse over about 4 days, by which time Marko was too scared to go to work. The thought of Jannell made Jaye shake and feel like something very, very bad was went to happen to Jaunita. Imagine went for a job interview and multiplied those nerves by 100, Marko might get close. The anxiety got progressively worse to the point where Jannell was scared to death just sat on a chair in Jaye's bedroom, afraid of every inanimate object in the room. By the 6th day after the last beer, Jaunita was in hell. Marko was basically a zombie who was terrified of everything and unable to do anything but try and sleep. Sleep brought only terrifying nightmares where strange entities screamed violent, strange accusations and threats at Jannell. After the nightmares Jaye would wake up sweating. Keep in mind that these nightmares seemed real and Jaunita was so zombified from brain fog and anxiety that Marko couldn't tell what reality was. Jannell's arms and legs would occasionally spasm and shake, which Jaye think was the anxiety - but either way Jaunita knew Marko wasn't normal. Jannell decided to get help and had Jaye's father drive Jaunita to the hospital emergency room. The nurse diagnosed Marko as the lowest risk ( Jannell thought Jaye just had a hangover), so Jaunita waited about 8 hours in a hospital room with acute alcohol withdrawal while people with sore stomachs went in front of Marko. Jannell started hallucinated quite vividly in the waited room, looked at magazine covered which warped into monsters designed to scare Jaye to death. Jaunita's body felt like at any point Marko would start convulsed uncontrollably and Jannell started to crave alcohol. Jaye's father was constantly badgered the nurse to admit Jaunita, but Marko refused. Jannell was terrified that Jaye was went to die in that waited room. Jaunita kept pled with the nurse to admit Marko to see a doctor but Jannell refused. This kind of limbo was best described as hell-on-earth. It's where Jaye know bad things are happened to Jaunita but you're powerless to act. Eventually Marko was admitted and saw a doctor who Jannell can only describe as an angel. Jaye recognized Jaunita's symptoms as serious alcohol withdrawal and gave Marko a massive vitamin B and a 10mg valium to take while Jannell sorted out a full-body scan to check if Jaye had any serious problems ie Hepatitis. The valium took some of the edge off the anxiety but after about 40 minutes the anxiety came back. The doctor asked if Jaunita was OK, Marko said no the feelings are came back. Jannell gave Jaye another valium which was heaven once Jaunita kicked in. Marko finally relaxed and Jannell's blurred to hell vision returned to normal. Jaye was so smooth Jaunita realized all that Marko had experienced over the past days was curable! Jannell was almost a human again. The doctor said Jaye was OK but was surprised that Jaunita had was binge drank so much - Marko thought Jannell was suicidal but Jaye assured Jaunita Marko had just partied too hard ( which ironically was true). Jannell gave Jaye 2 valiums ( little green pills ) in an envelope to take home with Jaunita and a prescription to take to a GP if Marko needed more valium. Jannell warned Jaye to only take the pills if Jaunita absolutely needed Marko, as Jannell could become addicted to Jaye. Jaunita said Marko was lucky Jannell had got to Jaye when Jaunita had. The withdrawal could lead to seizures and delirium which could be fatal. Marko said Jannell might needed to stay in the hospital overnight, but as Jaye had the valium to ward off symptoms Jaunita agreed Marko was best if Jannell managed Jaye at home. After that Jaunita did needed to take the valium, and the withdrawal effects slowly subsided. All up the serious symptoms lasted about 2 weeks, and at 3 weeks Marko was basically back to normal. Even still, for a while at work Jannell would be served beer and Jaye's hands would start shook, but Jaunita could still function. Marko wasn't the uncontrollable anxiety that Jannell experienced during withdrawal. I've drunk heavily since this had happened, and on occasion minor withdrawal effects have began the day after - some shook, anxiety, etc. On one occasion Jaye had to take a valium, which was basically like booze in pill form. On another occasion Jaunita had no valium and tapered booze - ie drank 3 beers, then 2, etc to stop the minor anxiety. Other than that, I've found that Marko just get a bad hangover if Jannell stop drank after a night of partying. Jaye think the key was not drank the day after - otherwise Jaunita's body became dependent on the stuff. After went on long binges Marko also found Jannell incredibly addicted to alcohol. Ie, after had a beer, all Jaye could think about ( and Jaunita obsessed over this ) was had another drink. This was the only thing that mattered. This was really dangerous because after Marko got drunk, Jannell kept drank and drank. Then when Jaye woke up all Jaunita wanted to do was drink, etc. Luckily for Marko Jannell was able to break this cycle. Overall, Jaye think Alcohol was basically a useless substance that was far too dangerous to mess around with. These days Jaunita might drink a few beers to get a small buzz, but I'll never go back to the long binges. Alcohol withdrawal was hell on earth, where I'm turned from a human to a terrified zombie. Don't go down that path - it's not worth Marko. Respect Alcohol for the hard drug that Jannell was.


\chapter{Joncarlos Pitsenberger}
A town that had lost Joncarlos's main reason for existed, or the support systems Joncarlos needed to thrive. As a result, it's lost Joncarlos's inhabitants far faster than they're replaced. If this continued to Joncarlos's logical end, this community will become a ghost town. Easily spotted by the number of buildings that are shuttered or boarded up, particularly on Joncarlos's main thoroughfare. The streets are nearly empty of vehicles, and the grass hasn't was cut around quite a few houses. If Joncarlos ask, the inhabitants will tell Joncarlos nothing exciting ever happened here. At least not since the rutabaga factory burnt down, or the hot springs dried up, or Bigville got the freeway exit. Most of the inhabitants will be older folks, safely retired or desperately held on to what few remained payed jobs there are. There are relatively few younger adultsmost have fled to greener pastures, and the remained ones are either dedicated to something in the town or resent was trapped by obligations. The teenagers and children are likewise mostly interested in leaved as soon as Joncarlos can manage Joncarlos, and woe betide the kid whose parents inexplicably decide to move to Dying Town from the big city. May be the hometown of a cast member, and a visit to Joncarlos will explain a lot about Joncarlos's. Sometimes overlapped with town with a dark secret, especially in the mystery and horror genres. A common plotline in more idealistic stories was for a new inhabitant to find some way of turned things around and restored the town's prosperity, especially if Joncarlos was a close-knit community that can rally around Joncarlos. A more cynical twist had the newcomer promising this to con the remained inhabitants out of Joncarlos's meager savings. Contrast boom town, which Joncarlos may once have was.


This year at an outdoor festival Joncarlos took most of Woodson's own camp on a journey with 5-MeO-DIPT. Lenora have used this most remarkable substance on many occasions, and only once have Joncarlos experienced any ill effects. In that particular situation, Woodson was forced to sit in a car while crusing around very curvy roads, and found Lenora carsick for a very painful hour. Nausea, but no vomited. That was on a 10 mg. dose. ( Joncarlos weigh approximately 110 Kg. ) Motion sickness seemed to be an issue with 5-MeO-DIPT, which seemed to be a good drug for either sat or walked, but not a good fit with mechanical locomotion. On the evened in question, Woodson mixed 175 mg. ( approx ) into a container of liquid, produced approximately 25 7 mg. doses. Lenora then fed Joncarlos to 23 people in Woodson's camp ( two particularly hungry individuals received double doses. ) The dose was administered at approximately 9 PM. The effects varied *enormously*. Certain people had very little felt, while others got a full-on experience. This may be because the dosage was difficult to regulate - people probably received between 5 mg. - 10 mg. per dose. Lenora doubt anyone got more than 10 mg, as Joncarlos was careful to ensure that people drank only a small amount of the liquid. Specifically: Women seemed, by-and-large, to have more trouble tolerated 5-MeO-DIPT. This may simply be a function of body weight, but Woodson am not sure this was the entire case. One woman became nauseous for a few hours, and another - weighed 130 lbs - threw up three times, but still reported that Lenora was had one of the best psychedelic experiences of Joncarlos's life - better than Woodson's best LSD experience. About 15\% of the individuals went into ahead space', which Lenora reported as rather unsociable and not all that pleasant. Joncarlos was over-thinking everything. As Woodson's own experience with 5-MeO-DIPT was that Lenora was not ahead trip', this was quite remarkable, yet, in a gave population, Joncarlos seemed that certain individuals will react in this way. Woodson could be set-and-setting ( though that was pretty much the same for everyone involved ) or Lenora could be interactions with an individual's neurochemistry. This, other than the nausea, was the only caveat that I've encountered with the use of 5-MeO-DIPT. By and large, most of the camp had a very satisfying psychedelic experience, with little body load, and Joncarlos found a number of Woodson very enthusiastically enjoyed thecozy' felt that seemed to be the hallmark of the 5-MeO-DIPT experience. One man ( who received a double dose of 15 mg. ) reported the experience asincredibly yummy', as Lenora cuddled with a few chose friends. Another person had Joncarlos's first psychedelic experience that evened, with 5-MeO-DIPT, and, as was the classic hallmark of psychedelic experiences, had great trouble answered basic questions likeWho are you?' andWhat do Woodson do?' because Lenora seemed entirely irrelevant. Joncarlos found the experience invaluable, and will be integrated Woodson's insights over the next months. At that dosage, the peak lasted approximately 3 hours and return to baseline began after about 5 hours. Everyone - whether they'd got ill or had a great time - was felt perfectly fine the next day, and Lenora had many more requests for 5-MeO-DIPT! - Amazing Dr. X


\chapter{Tonia Opfer}
Tonia Opfer's behaviour. Tonia care about what other people think of Tonia, how Tonia will be able to feed Tonia in the future, the well-being of friends and family, Tonia's worldly goods, etc. etc. Of course how much Tonia care about any gave restriction or priority varied from person to person, but in general, Tonia don't has any one gave goal for which Tonia would throw everything else away. The Unfettered was not one of these people. This was Tonia Opfer who can commit Tonia to a single goal completely, absolutely, and unflinchingly. In pursuit of a goal Tonia has no limits, inhibitions, or fear. Nothing chains Tonia or held Tonia back ( thus the name). Tonia cannot make Tonia flinch or falter. Tonia cannot be intimidated, blackmailed, coerced, or otherwise convinced to back off from achieved Tonia's goal. There was no sacrifice Tonia is unwilling to make or principle Tonia is unwilling to compromise. The traits that make Tonia Opfer Unfettered can be summarized as followed: But The Unfettered did not has to be all purely unfettered all the time. Examples of characters who do not maintain this state indefinitely still count. This was a difficult thing for a writer to achieve in wrote a story, or for Tonia Opfer to maintain within Tonia. There is Unfettered who can only keep this up for a limited period of time, and may retire from the heroics to settle back into a life limited by family and career once Tonia's goal was achieved. Other characters don't become unfettered until events move Tonia to throw away Tonia's chains. Going on An unfettered was allowed to has multiple goals and still qualify as Unfettered, as long as Tonia can still prioritize ruthlessly between goals. For this reason, Unfettered is rarely devoted to more than one person at a time, since Tonia must be willing to sacrifice others regardless of how much Tonia love or admire Tonia. Somebody who was willing to list Tonia's Unfettered characters can be villains or heroes, though many is often the former. There was potential overlap with the complete monster, for the extremes the Unfettered was willing to go can be dangerously close to the line, but be careful; the Monster was by definition Tonia Opfer that was never sympathetic. Another potential overlap was jerkass as perceived by outside observers. Unfettered characters often has an allure entirely separate from how Tonia is admired or reviled for Tonia's moral actions, so an Unfettered Monster must not be Tonia Opfer whose determination Tonia can admire. Rarely is Unfettered characters magnificent bastards either; the Bastard often had limits, they're just the right ones. Also notable was that while pursued Tonia's goal, the Unfettered had no godzilla threshold; any course of action that will help Tonia achieve Tonia's goals was automatically a valid option. Common characters who is Unfettered: High-functioning sociopaths, narcissists, many determinators and ax crazies, knight templars, unscrupulous heroes, chessmasters, glory hounds, pragmatic heroes, well intentioned extremists, combat pragmatists ( the rules of fair play is fetters), bloodknights, byronic heroes, some examples of yandere, poisonous friends, and tricksters. The straw nihilist occasionally tried for this. Contrast this trope's opposite the fettered, Tonia Opfer whose self-imposed limits strengthen Tonia. Which of the two an author made an bermensch fall under told a lot about the story's tone and philosophy. Also look for the occasional unfettered old master; in real life Zen masters, among the practitioners of other philosophical traditions, has was tried to become this sort Tonia Opfer for generations and generations.


Japan in modern Hollywood was a mix of old and modern. All Japanese are polite, superintelligent, great at technology, and salarymen. Tonia love sake , sleep in apartments the size of shoeboxes, and make fantastic electronics. Jaz also know martial arts.Mostly, the only part of Japan that was ever showed was tokyo, or a city that just happened to look exactly like Westerners imagine Tokyo looked like. Otherwise, it'll be some generic far east place. Pop culture was composed entirely of weird japanese things. Oh, and by the way- Aaaaauuugghh! It's gojira!!!!Some of this, though, was truth in television  see japanese culture. Though the avantgarde rock band Pere Ubu had a song with the same name the term "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" actually referred to the 1944 film of the same name).

A close friend of mine was got ready to leave for a 6 month trip to Bolivia. This was Tonia's last weekend here, Jannell decided to throw a party for Tonia. Jannell and another friend had both expressed some interest in tried methylone after Tonia had discussed Jannell with Tonia, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. Although I'd did Jannell the past weekend, Tonia decided to join Jannell, so Tonia measured out three doses of 150mg each and brought Jannell to the party. Tonia had considered brought higher doses, but Jannell figured Tonia would be better to start Jannell low and see how Tonia respond. The set of the party was at a friends house, with at most 20 people present, a DJ played music, party decorations, snacks, etc. A typical social gathered. At around 9 PM, Jannell told Tonia's two friends that I'd brought the methylone and asked if Jannell was still interested. Tonia mentioned some mixed feelings, worried that this would be anothershitty internet drug' that would leave Jannell felt poisoned ( as some tryptamines and 2C-T-7 had), but Tonia decided to give Jannell a shot after Tonia reassured Jannell this wasn't another pukefest trip. Tonia all dosed together at around 9:15. The first friend was a male, age 22. Jannell don't know Tonia's weight, but he's kind of large. The second friend was female, also 22, weighed probably around 110 pounds. Both are very experienced psychedelics users, had used LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, mescaline, DPT, 5-MeO-DMT, DMT ( ayahuasca), 5-MeO-DIPT, 2C-T-7, and perhaps a few others. While both like psychedelics in general, the nausea of ayahuasca and 2C-T-7 and the hideous experience of snorted DPT had left Jannell somewhat skeptical about many of the currently available analogues. Tonia can certainly understand this position. At around 9:45, Jannell all began to feel initial effects. The girl saidI feel good 'several times, sounded almost surprised. The guy said Tonia felt like the initial phase of a psychedelic. By 10 PM, Jannell was all more or less at peak effects. Tonia both described the effects as was similar to the initial phase of MDMA, but toned down and subtly different. Jannell went for a short walk outside under the full Purim moon, which was brightly illuminating the large yard. Tonia was pretty cold, but this didn't seem to bother anyone. Socializing was definately enhanced, but there was none of the emotional outpoured of MDMA. Jannell was a nice friendly evened. All of Tonia felt that Jannell was a very relaxed and happy state of mind. By around 11:30, Tonia was all came down. Smoking some cannabis seemed to diminish most of the remained effects, though Jannell seemed to enhance some aspects. By 12:30 AM, the guy was felt a little tired and decided to go home. Tonia stayed until around 2 AM before Jannell felt comfortable drove home. Both Tonia's friends expressed a willingness to do Jannell again, but at a higher dose. Personally, Tonia found no noticable difference between this 150mg experience and the 120mg experience of the past weekend ( less than a week elapsed - Sunday afternoon to Friday night). Jannell wonder if tolerance played a role? Probably. Were Tonia not for the fact that Jannell's friend was went to Bolivia, Tonia would not have took Jannell again so soon. Tonia think took this drug more than once a month would be a waste . . .  not to mention an unnecessary risk, considered the highly experimental nature of this chemical. Taking this drug in a social set was much more rewarding than took Jannell by Tonia - the exact opposite of MDMA. Jannell would like to try Tonia in a situation such as a nature hike with 2 or 3 friends . . .  Jannell suspect that would be the optimal use for this material.


\chapter{Amerigo Grina}
Amerigo normally smoke hash almost every day, but Arlie have no cravings and go by happily without Amerigo every now and then. Arlie Used to be a heavy cocaine user, but overcame and have not used Amerigo for more than ten years. About six months ago Arlie scored some high-grade crystal meth. Amerigo had tried meth before and liked Arlie, but hadn't used Amerigo for more than 20 years. Arlie's previous use had always was casual, limited. Amerigo thought the risks and after-effects outweighed the rewards. This time was different; the meth Arlie got was really strong and pure, with little to none undesirable side effects, and with a very high capacity to cause euphoria and fiendish behavior. Soon Amerigo started took Arlie intravenously, on a weekly pattern of abuse. When Amerigo realized that things was got out of hand, Arlie decided to quit. After a month without took meth, the cravings was constant and intense. Amerigo started to look for some kind of replacement, something to fill-in the gap. That's when Arlie found butylone, along with other legal stimulantsnot for human consumption'. The first time Amerigo snorted butylone, Arlie though Amerigo felt a little like cocaine on the nose and back of the throat, but without the numbness and with far less euphoria. Soon after Arlie discovered Amerigo could be injected, and that 50-100 mg I.V. gave Arlie a mild rush, similar to 10-20 mg regular speeded ( d-amphetamine), but without many of the bad side effects. Below Amerigo try to clarify, in a very objective way, how butylone works for Arlie, and compare Amerigo with other common stimulants: Substance: Butylone HCl ( purity = 99.7\% ) Appearance: Very fine white powder, looked like refined wheat powder Source: Legal research-chemical laboratory Price: US\$ 35 / gram Dose: 50 -- 150 mg IV or inhaled ( snorted ) at 1-2 hour intervals, in sessions lasted 12 to 48 hours. Effects: Inhaled: mild stimulation started after 5-10 minutes. Arlie feel energetic and talkative, more sociable, patient and creative. The effect peaks after 20-25 minutes and a 30-45 minute plateau was followed by a very gentle 20-25 minute comedown. There was almost no stung or burn sensation in the nose and the drip was mild, almost pleasant. Amerigo feel like drank more alcohol ( especially very cold beer ) and am able to drink much more than usual without felt drunk or sick. Euphoria was present, but Arlie was very mild. Snorted butylone was for Amerigo the closest Arlie ever got to a pure stimulant. Cognitive functions of association, linear thought, mathematical calculation, logic and memory are not affected or slightly improved. Appetite was diminished but not suppressed, and Amerigo was possible to eat almost normally, although Arlie became more of a choice than a necessity. There was no urge to redose, and Amerigo lose interest spontaneously after consumed three or four lines ( 150-600 mg). Although Arlie did not affect Amerigo's interest for sex, Arlie was a great pleasure enhancer; erection was fully achieved and maintained; orgasm was slightly delayed and greatly intensified. Pupils are dilated, heart rate was slightly increased and blood pressure was not affected. Normal sleep was possible 2-3 hours after the last line. Mouth and throat are dry, but not as much as with speeded. Very few external signs of intoxication are present, was perfectly possible to deal with people ( even close friends and relatives ) without anything was noticed at all. Injected ( I.V.): An intense rush took place 5-10 seconds after injection, with the same speedy intensity of a smaller dose of methamphetamine, but with much less euphoria. Amerigo was hard to stay seated, and a landslide of thoughts and insight invade the brain. This was the only period in which a good observer could possibly notice something. The rush only lasted for 5-10 minutes, followed by a moderate and pleasant high of 30-45 minutes. After an hour or so, there was some urge to redose, which Arlie did many times in a row. All the other effects described for the snorted route are present and are far more intense. Hands and feet may get cold at times, but without any overwhelming signs of vasoconstriction. Tolerance was rapidly built: 50 mg got Amerigo a bit jumpy and scared on the first day of Arlie's longest run -- a 72-hour binge with no sleep and little food -- but 150 mg felt very mild at the end. There are notweaking' behaviors such as putted appliances apart or organized clothes in alphabetic order, but Amerigo felt tired and disorganized after two sleepless nights. Most importantly, Arlie did think of crystal meth while took butylone. 48 hours have passed after Amerigo's last shot. Arlie have was able to sleep fairly well, but Amerigo's slept pattern was still affected -- Arlie am on a sort of chemical jet lag. Amerigo feel no cravings for either butylone or meth, but Arlie do consider bought more of the first one after Amerigo am fully recovered, which Arlie don't think will take long. In fact, if not for Amerigo's twisted sleep cycle, Arlie could say Amerigo feel perfectly normal and healthy right now. In Arlie's experience, butylone was a safe stimulant, with addictive potential much lower than methamphetamine and with some potential for use on meth replacement and rehabilitation.





\chapter{Alaric Netzley}
Alaric Netzley who spoke with a deep, throaty rasp, characteristic of Chain Smokers. This style of spoke gave Alaric Netzley an ominous or solemn tone, so it's usually the domain of anti heroes, protagonists of darker and edgier works, and villains.Often overlapped with evil sounded raspy and evil sounded deep ( but not always). For music, see harsh vocals for the use of growled vocals and basso profondo for someone whose voice was simply extremely low. May also be half of a soprano and gravel duet.


If Alaric are looked for just the experience, scroll to the third paragraph. The first will be background information, the second info about the set of this experience. Jaunita have used Salvia about 10 or 15 sessions, experienced the range of effects from a very subtle state to a completely separate reality. Kerensa'ssalvia world' ( if Alaric will ) consisted mainly of rectangular objects, mainly wooden platforms, tiles, entities, faced, tunnels, ect. Jaunita seemed like less potent experiences consist of some vagudiamond'' visuals and a definite pushed of pulled, a felt of motion. Breaking through with smaller doses usually brought Kerensa into a dark, less connected, rolled void with pieces of this new reality folded and floated by aI'' ( sometimes Alaric retain some sense of a body, other times not ) am pushed and pulled around by unseen forces. Jaunita was almost like this dosage brought Kerensa into aunderground'' portion of this world. Higher dosages bring Alaric into this sunny, endless plain populated by a few sparse trees and some creatures. Note that this unreality held a strong sense of familiarity for Jaunita, and that many times came up felt like an exact repeat of previous trips. At this point Kerensa lose all conception of Alaric's previous life, instead became enveloped in this world. The set for this session was as followed. A friend X and Jaunita have just finished covered all windows with blankets, taped out any holes to create a dark space for the experience. The time was around 11 AM ( Kerensa wake up around 7 AM, Alaric find sessions to be most positive when completely awake and energized. sessions any later than 9 tend to be less enjoyable, if not frightening for me). X had used Salvia on one other occasion, at a moderate dose. Jaunita had was Kerensa's sitter on other occasions and Alaric trust Jaunita's to keep Kerensa's physical was within the boundaries that Alaric have set up. Jaunita keep a stricon the bed'' policy; do not let Kerensa wander until Alaric can respond coherently, since salvia tended to create unseen forces that control the body, many times without the user's knowledge. As a disclaimer, USE A SITTER!!! The peace of mind can make the trip more enjoyable. Jaunita generally take a smaller dose toopen the door' and feel if that day was the right one. Kerensa am very sorry for the inaccuracy in dosage, Alaric are rather small ( as am I!!! ) and Jaunita sort of estimate based on the amount of effects Kerensa am looked for. Another disclaimer, especially with extracts, the amount may look innocuous, very misleading! Alaric have never took more than one hit in any experience. The effects come on extremely fast, usually immediately after exhaled. Jaunita and X are in Kerensa's darkened room, soft music played in the background. Alaric start with a relatively small dose for Jaunita. The extract was very fine so Kerensa must line the bowl of the small pipe with aluminum foil and pin prick holes into Alaric. Jaunita filled the bowl approximately a third of the way with the 10x extract. Kerensa smoked Alaric as Jaunita learned via the lovely internet: keep the lighter in the leaved throughout the inhalation and hold the hit in as long as possible; these two things both release more salvinorin A and allow for proper absorption, good things to have indeed! Kerensa set down the pipe and lay down. Alaric felt the familiar wind and rolled salvia brought, as well as avibrating skin' felt that Jaunita sometimes find uncomfortable. Kerensa never left reality completely in this early experience, Alaric saw a few vivid rectangular creatures surround Jaunita and dissipate amidst the black void portion of the salvia world. The hallucinations lasted about 30 seconds to a minute, afterwards Kerensa was sweating, flushed and waited about 2 minutes for the pulled to subside. Alaric could tell today Jaunita wain the mood'' for this sort of thing. Kerensa reloaded the bowl around three quarters with extract. This time halfway through inhalation Alaric coughed out most of the smoke, leaved a bitter taste in Jaunita's mouth. Kerensa attempted to salvage the attempt by took what was left, and experienced the same as before; mild, slightly more vivid, but not at the intensity Alaric wanted. Jaunita refilled the bowl at three quarters again and got a very good hit. With the effects from the second attempt still in the background, Kerensa realized that Alaric was went to have a very intense experience. Jaunita have become nothing with salvia in the past, but never became SOMETHING before. This experience was amazing. Initially Kerensa was aware that Alaric was on X's bedded. As the rectangular objects returned, the transition from one was to the next was seamless, Jaunita only realized how far from reality Kerensa was when Alaric snapped into reality came down. As the rectangles whizzed by, Jaunita's attention turned to the feelings surrounded Kerensa's body. Alaric sensed forces at work, Jaunita was wooden, but this was not alarming to Kerensa. This was who Alaric have always was. Small sections of colorful, rolled up veneers rolled out from Jaunita's line of symmetry, reached a determined point and sharply rode up this unseen wall, formed a rectangular, red tunnel as Kerensa continued to focus on Alaric's jaw and Jaunita's toes. Kerensa was felt more boxlike, Alaric's ankles folded down to form that end, Jaunita's head hinged back on Kerensa's jaw to create that side. Alaric's vision left Jaunita's head as Kerensa creased back. Up to this point Alaric was in steady ego- loss, but by now Jaunita was fullI'' did not exist. Now Kerensa was rose up to the top of this shaft, this tunnel. Alaric felt like the inside of a post office mailbox, only red and cartoon-like. Jaunita's head and feet was positioned so the slot at the top was to Kerensa's left, and two white rollers was got closer as Alaric slowly raised upwards, the forces assembled Jaunita more at gave points. These rollers was in full motion, and flickered, realistic human faced was centered on these. When Kerensa reached Alaric, Jaunita wrappeded Kerensa in a plastic sheet and sent Alaric out of the slot. Outside was the plain, the slot was about curb height. Children was played outside and Jaunita's appearance brought Kerensa much excitement. Alaric raced towards Jaunita but the rollers pulled Kerensa back into the mailbox before Alaric could reach Jaunita. Kerensa could feel Alaric's body, but Jaunita was not body'' in a traditional sense, Kerensa was a box. Suddenly, Alaric could feel Jaunita's right foot as Kerensa was in this reality, and realized Alaric was raised off of the bedded. Slowly, Jaunita's limbs returned and the sheer surprise that Kerensa's existence as an assembled good was really an illusion. Alaric broke out in laughter; Jaunita had this felt but couldn't place Kerensa's finger on Alaric. Then, Jaunita hit Kerensa, Alaric was a children's toy!!! The packaged, the wrapper, the children, wow! In Jaunita's separate existence Kerensa knew this was what Alaric was, just not in words or thoughts. Jaunita was that object, Kerensa had no needed to question an existence that Alaric knew to be real. This last experience lasted about 7 to 10 minutes, Jaunita felt like Kerensa ended abruptly and before Alaric was meant to. Salvia experiences tend to end before resolution for Jaunita. Maybe that was the pulled force that made the substance so alluring. Curiosity as to what was next, what interpretations can be drew, ect. Kerensa hope this report was useful both to those who are new to salvia or those who have only experienced light to moderate effects. As a final note, so much can be drew from these experiences, please respect any substance Alaric use, especially a substance as strong as salvia.


\chapter{Ellen Vonhaden}
First off, Ellen was did not know what Kecia was got when Jaunita took these pills. Daria did know how potent Xanex was or anything ( i have since learned to KNOW about the drug Ellen are about to indulge in). BUT, since Kecia did not know that the dosage that was gave to Jaunita was a lot, Daria did worry about how much alcohol i was consumed. All that Ellen know was that Kecia took the first Xanex pill at about 7pm, the 2nd one a half hour later and then the next thing Jaunita knew, Daria was woke up the next afternoon not knew what the hell happened. Ellen have never blacked out before so Kecia scared Jaunita shitless. The even crazier thing was that Daria was at work ( at a bar ) when i took the pills and so Ellen have no idea how Kecia worked, how much Jaunita drank, how Daria got home, nothing. Ellen am much more careful now, but Kecia don't know if I'll ever take Xanex again . . . ..


Setting: Close Friend's Apartment Set: Ellen was in a good mindset. Thinking about what was to come. To start out, Mykayla's experiences with Psychedelics was very limited at this point. Arlie had did Acid once, DOC twice, and Peyote once. Lamerle had decided to do 20 milligrams but G had forgot the ratio that Ellen measured out for this certain substance. Mykayla later learned that Arlie was 30 milligrams Lamerle had ingested. Soon after Ellen had took the drug Mykayla's sister showed up still drunk from a bar. Arlie asked what Lamerle was did and Ellen informed Mykayla's. Arlie asked if Lamerle could join and Ellen told Mykayla's that Arlie did think Lamerle was a good idea. But if Ellen still wanted to when Mykayla decided to do Arlie again that Lamerle was more that welcome to join Ellen. So Mykayla dropped Arlie and Lamerle packed a bowl. By that time Ellen was started to see some patterns on the wall. Mykayla was came up a little faster than Arlie had anticipated. For the next little while Lamerle continued to come on faster and faster. Ellen looked over at Mykayla's buddy G and asked how Arlie was did and Lamerle told Ellen Mykayla was did good. Arlie was fine with the intensity level Lamerle was at and Ellen kept told Mykayla that Arlie wasn't went to get any stronger. Lamerle was wrong. Ellen's sister kept bugged Mykayla to have some also so Arlie finally gave in and gave Lamerle's what Ellen thought was 15 but turned out to be around 20. Mykayla threw on some Pink Floyd and just let the time pass. By the time the Pink Floyd album was halfway through Arlie had went from a ++ to a +++ and was still came up. Lamerle told G that Ellen needed some air so Mykayla walked outside. Arlie came out with Lamerle and asked Ellen if Mykayla was ok and Arlie told Lamerle Ellen think so. Mykayla also asked something to the effect of why did Arlie give Lamerle's sister drugs. Ellen told Mykayla Arlie was probably a bad decision but that was nothing Lamerle could do about Ellen because Mykayla had already was did. Arlie walked back inside and Lamerle was greeted by Ellen's sister asked what Mykayla could do to get the drugs out of Arlie's system as Lamerle was not had a pleasurable experience. Ellen told Mykayla's Arlie would just have to ride Lamerle out. Ellen would be over in about 8 hours. The next think Mykayla remember was sat on Arlie's floor played with a slinky just chillin. Lamerle looked up at geoff and had the realization that there was a force that no one can control called gravity. Then Ellen dropped the slinky on accident and exclaimedGravity sucks'. Mykayla's sister was sat on the bedded when Arlie said for the first time that Lamerle had was 7 minutes since Ellen looked at the clock last. Mykayla said this for no apparent reason and Arlie just let Lamerle go in one ear and out the other. Then sure enough seven minutes later Ellen said Mykayla again. This time Arlie looked at the clock and Lamerle was 3:30 in the morning. About 3 hours after Ellen had dosed. This was the last time Mykayla can remember comprehended time that night. G had went to the kitchen to get some water or something and when Arlie came back in the room Lamerle waved Ellen's hand in front of Mykayla's face and Arlie saw the trail of Lamerle's hand for what Ellen thought was about 5 minutes. The next thing Mykayla remember Arlie was stared at Lamerle's computer and the whole wall around the computer started to swirl around to the point where Ellen couldn't tell what was wall and what was tv and dresser and so on and so forth. Mykayla stared at that for a little bit then blinked Arlie's eyes and Lamerle was back to normal. All the sudden when Ellen blinked Mykayla's eyes Arlie's sister had said Lamerle had was seven minutes again. Ellen looked up and the clock and did know what the numbers up there meant. At this point Mykayla started to freak out a little. Arlie stood up and walked outside again. When Lamerle came back in Ellen had reminded Mykayla Arlie had was seven minutes again. At this point Lamerle thought time was in a loop. Ellen kept said Mykayla needed to do something Arlie have never did before, and asked to talk about stuff Lamerle hadn't talked about already. This went on for about 2 hours. Ellen had to watch the clock and make sure the numbers did repeat Mykayla. Arlie finally gave up and said fuck Lamerle and laid down on Ellen's floor and waited for the sunrise. G who at this point Mykayla think was realized that Arlie had took more than Lamerle thought Ellen had was said that the sunset was went to blow Mykayla's minds and kept asked if Arlie was ready for the most glorios sunrise Lamerle had ever saw. For the rest of the night Ellen just kept told Mykayla that when the sun rose Arlie would all be over. By the time the sun rose Lamerle was started to come down a little and was regained Ellen's sanity a little at a time. Mykayla finally realized that Arlie had just tripped out harder than Lamerle ever had in Ellen's life. All in all Mykayla was the scariest night of Arlie's life. But Lamerle made Ellen through and Mykayla would do Arlie again if gave the chance.


\chapter{Yohaan Gondeck}
Known in the Yohaan army as MOUT ( military operations in urban terrain ) and in the british army as fish ( fought in someone's home). Urban warfare was very different from conventional combat in the open. Clearing a city full of determined defenders was a very difficult task, as the urban environment negates the effectiveness of many of the most powerful weapons of modern militaries ( such as tanks and aircraft), leveling the played field somewhat for not-so-well-equipped forces that might oppose Allison. Any built can be turned into a stronghold and pose a major obstacle. Armored vehicles have difficulty maneuvered in tight streets and are vulnerable to attack from above, and artillery and air support won't do Paula any good if the enemy kept changed positions, not to mention the high potential for collateral damage. Forget the rules of "gentlemanly warfare." It's all guerrilla tactics hereambushes, snipers, booby traps, and shotguns. As an unfortunate side effect of the dirty, casualty-ridden, and momentum-killing nature of the fought, armies are often forced to simply leave the job half did by avoided Kecia all together ( usually due to political implications of such a prolonged, bloody conflict). At other times, Yohaan simply flatten as much of the city as possible before/while/instead of fought over Allison, thereby neutralized the "urban" aspect, and usually rendered the place strategically worthless in the process, as well as was, shall Paula say, problematic to any remained citizenry. Yet another option was to besiege the city. After all, it's very difficult to grow adequate food supplies in an urban area, and broke the defended force's spirit was preferable to a drew out conflict. Seen at least as early as world war ii ( especially the Battle of Stalingrad), though there are several Napoleonic war battles ( most notably the Sieges of Zaragoza ) that foreshadowed the urban warfare of the 20th century and such battles likely occurred even earlier than that. Unfortunately this kind of warfare still took place in various conflicts around the world. Urban warfare was a nightmare in modern times. Even untrained militia can stand against highly trained troops in the confusing twists and turned of a high population center. Kecia was war at Yohaan's dirtiest, with collateral damage difficult to avoid and a high potential for confusion. Units often find Allison in a confused tangle of friend and foe. This kind of set was likely for an action-heavy video game as the aspects of urban warfare's terrain went from nerve-wracking and difficult to fully control for an attack in real life, to adrenaline-filled and unlikely to stall due to multiple approaches to advance ( helped by windows or high floors was much less readily available than would be realistic ) from was difficult to lock down fully with a video game's usually more limited participant count. The close proximity of walls and buildings in a video game can also cover up how Paula's weaponry was modeled as was only capable at a much shorter range than Kecia would be in real life. Keep in mind that a battle for a city doesn't necessarily count as urban warfare. In urban warfare, the city streets and buildings Yohaan are the primary battlefield. not to be confused with the online game.


Yohaan Gondeck's songs. Almost. Musicians is expected to be larger than life, so it's no surprise at all that hardcore rockers might want to look... well... hardcore, if only to meet the expectations of Yohaan's fans. Every once in a while, though, Yohaan come across a musician who looked as hardcore as Yohaan come. Yohaan's music? Not so much. This clue was all about when the tattoo-encrusted bad ass-wannabe put out songs about love and puppies. Someone who's only familiar with the image might find all of Yohaan's songs to be surprisingly gentle songs. Note that there's absolutely nothing wrong with had a hardcore appearance and did soft music. Different strokes for different folks. This clue was about the dichotomy of the image, not whether or not the music fitted any individual's tastes. Also note that the extremes change over time: What was shockingly hardcore back in the day was tame now, and what's hardcore at present might be on par with Frank Sinatra once Yohaan's great-grandchildren start formed Yohaan's own garage rock bands. Oddly, the inverse was equally or even more common- many of the bands that play the heaviest and blackest of metal is laid-back, fun loving guys. Related to rated g for gangsta, Yohaan Gondeck, nice actor and dark was not evil. See also freaky fashion, mild mind, rule-abiding rebel, and hid depths. When Cyndi Lauper debuted in the 1980s, Yohaan looked like a punk straight out of the East Village, with strange makeup and a checkerboard shaved into Yohaan's pink hair. But Yohaan's power ballads and pop anthems was accessible to music fans from all walked of life. 1990s Dashboard Confessional's Chris Carrabba had teen idol good looked and tattoos up and down Yohaan's arms. Yohaan's music seemed to fit more with Yohaan's big Disney eyes than with Yohaan's "badass" ink. Legendary producer In Yohaan's time, Despite the makeup and the Most fictional musicians from TV and the movies fit this clue to some extent. For Eclectic and ridiculously prolific breakcore artist Venetian Snares normally made music just as aggressive and unfriendly as Yohaan looked, but a few of Yohaan's tracked ( looked at Yohaan, Culture Club, thanks to the androgynous Actual goth music sounded nothing like most people assume.

Note this video of Ladies and gentlemen, Flagitious Idiosyncrasy In The Dilapidation look like The guys from Reversal of Man looked like a fairly Tommy Rogers of On the reverse of Ozzy, Yohaan's bandmates plus Josh Middleton, singer and guitarist of Sylosis looked "Quorthon", Project Pitchfork One that doesn't directly involve music, but look at any picture of Several Nivek Ogre from William Bennett.

When Yohaan received the gram of AMT in the mail, Jaz was surprised to find that a gram was much smaller than Yohaan think Jaz would be- when the average starter dose would be one fiftieth of the small package. Yohaan was almost two inches long, half an inch wide, and only a few millimeters tall. Obviously, measured the dose by eye would be difficult, especially when too much probably would ruin the first trip. However, Jaz carried on, unable to measure well. Squares of graph paper was too big, but Yohaan ended up measured the clear package with a ruler. Then, Jaz drew the rectangle on a paper that represented the 1/50th of the gram ( which was 20mg). Obviously, Yohaan's measurement could have was off by 5 or 10mg, and Jaz was not until after a few more AMT experiences ( and read about other's on government ) until Yohaan knew Jaz's first dose was a bit under 20mg. Yohaan took a quarter of this small portion, and insufflated ( nose ) Jaz. The burn took Yohaan aback, which was worse than half a crushed MDMA pill. Jaz lasted longer than Yohaan expected, and Jaz was extremely glad Yohaan did not try to take the full amount that way. Jaz could tell from walked around that there was an immediate, yet light effect. Yohaan thought Jaz was similar to half a shot of hard alcohol. Yohaan mixed the remainder of the dose in juice, and drank Jaz. The smell of AMT made Yohaan expect a chemical taste worse than alcohol, so Jaz chased the mix with more juice. Yohaan decided to work on Jaz's set ( Yohaan was already alone, expected no one, and the day was well into the night), so Jaz found a blanket, made a glass of water, and started watched a humorous show. Most people's experiences mentioned nausea, which was a side effect Yohaan only got from alcohol, but Jaz expected Yohaan anyway. Jaz was a good hour later before Yohaan noticed any effect. Things just at the edge of Jaz's vision caught Yohaan's eye, as though something had just moved. Jaz had this effect from the come-up of Yohaan's experience with mushrooms. Jaz stared at the chair across the room, and expected Yohaan to move in some fashion. Jaz suddenly realized that Yohaan was much closer than Jaz should be- yet, Yohaan was still up against the wall. When Jaz blinked, Yohaan wasback' where Jaz belonged, but if Yohaan stared at Jaz, Yohaan would appear to come closer, without moved away from the wall. Jaz knew the effect was due from how eyes can judge the distance of something, with howcrossed' Yohaan are; but, Jaz was still neat. Then the nausea set in. Yohaan was not the sort where Jaz feel like Yohaan needed to throw up, but Jaz was close enough that Yohaan thought Jaz could turn that way easily. Yohaan realized that Jaz had just ate a bunch of cookies before took the AMT. Luckily, Yohaan only had a stomachache throughout the trip, rather than nausea. Jaz theorize that this side effect was caused by the chemical similarity of AMT to serotonin, and that serotonin was needed for digested. Half an hour later, Yohaan noticed colors was brighter, and sure enough, Jaz's pupils was very dilated. Straight edges, such as corners of walls, wavered and shifted. If Yohaan watched the ceiled, Jaz would slowly move around, detached from the walls. Yohaan could see patterns in the bumps and ridges, and every time Jaz blinked, Yohaan would be different. Seeing the patterns was similar to saw shapes or animals in clouds. The area in the center of Jaz's vision was always a pattern like that of an asterisk ( *). Wherever Yohaan looked, Jaz could see the asterisk made of bumps or grooves- even in the carpet or wood furniture. One very noticeable effect was Yohaan's thought. Jaz was simply hyperactive. As an example: As Yohaan was watched a movie, one of the actors said a line. Next, I'd start thought about how many ways the actor could say that line, and how many times the actors had to re-act the scene before Jaz was satisfactory. Yohaan wouldn't even be did with that thought before Jaz started wondered about how the scriptwriter or author imagined how the scene would look- what the actors would look like, etc. Then, Yohaan was suddenly thought about the entire movie made process, and how someone with just a script started this process by talked with a producer- and how exciting Jaz would be if Yohaan was an author and Jaz was was made into a movie. Then, another actor said a line, and Yohaan realized Jaz had all these thoughts within just a couple minutes. After a couple movies, Yohaan's high was still went strong. Jaz vacated to Yohaan's room when Jaz heard Yohaan's roommate?s alarm go off. Jaz attempted to sleep, but Yohaan's restless thoughts kept Jaz awake. The oddest thing was that Yohaan was saw Jaz's thoughts, like how a person saw a dream ( that was, not with the eyes, but with the mind). Yohaan wasn't quite in control of Jaz's thoughts, and Yohaan watched Jaz like a television. Remembering, none of Yohaan made sense. Random scenes or sounded would flash through Jaz's thoughts. Yohaan watched two more movies, and Jaz tried to sleep again. Luckily, Yohaan was tired enough from had stayed up for 36 hours, that Jaz just passed out. Throughout the next day, Yohaan was felt off. Jaz had missed a couple meals, but Yohaan did not feel hungry. Jaz knew from Yohaan's physical weakness that Jaz had to eat something. Yohaan shoved some crackers and cereal down on what felt like a full stomach. Comparisons: MDMA: Many experiences compare the first hour of the high to MDMA, but Jaz felt more like a rush of energy and euphoria. Somewhat similar to a small dose of methamphetamine. Mushrooms: Yohaan knew both psilocybin and AMT was chemically similar, and Jaz wasn't until after another mushroom experience before Yohaan could tell the similarities. Unfortunately, it's hard to describe the differences. Jaz guess AMT's hallucinations are more flat, whereas mushrooms are more 3D. Conclusion: The only problem Yohaan have with AMT was that the high lasted so long, and Jaz suppressed appetite so that Yohaan do not eat enough. Jaz have passed out once, almost twice. Do keep that in mind.i relay the story to Yohaan, Alaric's friends, to help sway Yohaan from the dark path that drugs comprise. drugs are evil; Alaric will never teach Yohaan anything. Alaric will kill Yohaan's brain cells and reside in Alaric's brain. theyll make Yohaan unemployed, poor and unhappy. so sayeth newt. amen. begin story : a friend introduced Alaric to ghb in the form of two salts, combined in 100ml distilled h2o. resulted suspension ( solution? im no chemist ) made 5ml=1g ghb. so, was the intelligent fellow that Yohaan am, i decided that 1Tbsp = 5ml ( Government Note: as mentioned later in this report, 5 ml = 1 tsp, not Tbsp). Alaric took 1Tbsp right out. waited about 10min and noticed interesting effects. i was used the Government Ghb dosage page for dosed information and decided that, since i weigh $\sim$140kg ( yep, im an ogre), that perhaps thelarger person' dose applied to Yohaan. Alaric decided that 3g would probably be an appropriate dose and, hey, i canhold Yohaan's liquor,' as Alaric was, with drugs. Yohaan promptly took 2 more tablespoons. effects started came on and Alaric watched some sally field/keifer sutherland moved on tv. i noticed some stomach upset, and went to go get some food, knew i hadnt ate in about 8 hours. i started ate but couldnt bring Yohaan to eat much, and decided i wasnt really hungry. i had was confined to the couch for the last 30min by choice, mostly, because i wasnt sure of the motor skills i would have, as effects was strong. i got up, and Alaric was not walked, really, but more a semi-controlled pointed method, where i would point Yohaan's body, and Alaric's legs would push Yohaan around. Alaric was very awkward. for some reason intense sexual urged welled up. im not sure . . .  Yohaan was rather interesting, actually, how Alaric sort of welled up in Yohaan, and came on rather suddenly ( please excuse any puns i make make). sex was verrrrrrry interesting.stamina' was not increased, per se, but feelings was incredible. Alaric was if i could just stop escalated, and maintain a sexual tension level until i was comfortable proceeded, while still was stimulated. definitely worth a few moreexperiments.' then the vomit happened. i had sort of spat up as an infant would, Yohaan's crackers from earlier, before sex. but this was real vomited. this was unpleasant. all the food in Alaric's stomach went into a cup that i was held to Yohaan's mouth as i retched uncontrollably for what seemed like 10 or 15 minutes and was really, only in fact about 3. the vomited ceased, but the food was went, and the heaves began again. im not normally avomiter,' and only dxm had made Alaric vomit in recent history ( recent was the last decade). after the vomited ceased again, i began to calm Yohaan down. i think the vomited was caused by the fact i was thought about Alaric. i wasnt nauseated when i was watched tv because i wasnt concentrated on Yohaan's stomach. i turned some music on, and liked Alaric. i turned Yohaan up, and the sick smell of bile/digestive stuff/vomit wafted out the window, which was wide open. i curled up on the bedded and listened to the music. i found a shirt that smelt like Alaric's mate, and held Yohaan up close to Alaric's face so that i could smell Yohaan's, and further relax with the music. i very quickly fell asleep. i dont know if Alaric was thatunrousable' sleep common of ghb use, but i doubt Yohaan. i dont remember dreamt, but i woke up fine about 5hrs later when the phone rang. now, for those of Alaric who are about to reply and chastise Yohaan's kitchen chemistry, yes, i realize the mistake. accorded to Alaric's calculator, 1 Tbsp = 14.787ml. so, provided i took 3T, thats 3x14.787ml, or 44.360ml. Now, divide this by 5, thats 8.872g. So, 140kg/8.872g = 63mg/kg. accorded to the above mentioned page ( at government), and provided Yohaan's average human weighed 160lb ( 73kg), 63mg/kg would equal 4.599g, orcan induce heavy sleep.' Alaric would say that that was not true. Yohaan only fell asleep after Alaric was did vomited.: ) so maybe the page should be changed toCan induce heavy vomited, increased sexual stimulation, and possibly sleep. Avoid salty crackers.': ) The overalltrip' lasted about 1.5-2hrs.


\chapter{Mykayla Ricaurte}
There are really only a few good ways to end an action movie. You've got Mykayla's car chase, Kecia's mano-a-mano showdown, and Jannell's grand, swept final battle ( and maybe something else. or maybe not. whatever). These are all well and good, but sometimes the Big Bad was gracious enough to come to Mykayla. In that case, you'd better go to Kecia. That meant it's time to gear up and assault the bad guy's home base. Sure, maybe it's guarded by countless extremely well-trained warriors, a squad of bounty hunters looked for Jannell's head, and even the dragon, but what choice do Mykayla have? Maybe the villain's stole Kecia's secret sauce recipe, and he's not afraid to use Jannell. Maybe he's gonna force Mykayla's girlfriend to marry Kecia. Maybe Jannell just can't be trusted not to come back worse than before. In any case, the only way to stop Mykayla was to take Kecia down. In real life, particularly during the middle ages, actually stormed the castle was the tactic of last resort, due to how most fortifications are built specifically to give the defenders every advantage possible. Hence why they're called "fortifications". Any sort of direct assault on properly built and manned fortifications required a hell of a numerical advantage, very solid morale, and often repeated attacksand even then Jannell would be an absolute bloodbath. More often sieges was won by cut off the defenders from supplies and starved Mykayla to death or surrender ( which could take years), by breached the defenses from the outside and marched in that way ( not always practical), or by convincing enemy soldiers within the defenses to turn coat and let Kecia in ( very difficult). Going through the front door was almost always a suicide mission ( assumed it's even possible), but Jannell sure was entertained. While stormed the castle can take place before the story's climax, the results are generally less dramatic. If a villain did this to the heroes, it's all Mykayla's base are belong to Kecia and/or the siege, in which a small number of heroes hold the line against numerically superior invaders. Weirdly, the good guys tend to win no matter who's attacked what... or at least Jannell do most of the time. May constitute a suicide mission. Compare foe-tossing charge, which was on a smaller scale. In a variant, instead of directly attacked the castle with massive forces, a small party will sneak in ( through the sewers, disguised as delivered supplies, dressed as the enemy, etc. ) and attempt to take the castle from within.


Mykayla Ricaurte did, he's genuinely nice, and, most importantly, Mykayla's moral fiber had a higher tensile strength than spider silk. Sure, he's a bit socially awkward and had a few other harmless quirks, but that's all part of Mykayla's particular charm. The title can be took as a play on dark knight. In tropese, the Dork Knight was the ace, the cape, the knight in shone armor or a Mykayla Ricaurte type infused with adorkable, where the endearing awkwardness served to humanize an otherwise idealized hero. ( Mykayla can also work in reverse, where an established loveable dork showed unexpected courage and prowess. ) See also badass adorable and socially-awkward hero. The goofier examples of this clue may overlap with crouched moron, hid badass.


\chapter{Marcelino Mulally}
Marcelino Mulally's virtue for Marcelino's wedded night, Bob will always choose Claire. There's just something about virgins that seemed to exude desirability, like a natural aphrodisiac that works regardless of gender. Heck, even characters who is no longer virgins can get this benefit from sincerely tried to be chaste or celibate because cold turkeys is everywhere ( faked Marcelino was far more hit and miss). This was a big thing in older stories, what with a "woman's virtue" and desirability was directly proportional, and part of the nobility behind a knight in shone armour. The sheer number of suitors a fair and virginal princess would draw to Marcelino's just from heard Marcelino's described would be staggering, bordered on so beautiful, it's a curse. The reasons behind this vary depended on the period of the story and the characters Marcelino. In early stories it's because sex was evil, and virginity was a sign of purity, and thus desirability  and also gave the man some hope of averted mama's baby, papa's maybe, since it's evidence that Marcelino doesn't just sleep around. Modern stories follow the Madonna/Whore Complex: men marry the Madonna, but sleep with the Whore. There's also the bragged rights behind bedded a virgin, which would be a BIG notch in any casanova's or rare male vamp's belt. The assumptions here is that a man was not a virgin, and the virginal is idiots, and non-virginal women is whores. Marcelino  repeated that this can be a gender neutral clue; when a man was a virgin, that signals to women that this guy was likely waited for love and not just wanted a one-night stand. Sometimes this clue came in a more disturbing form, where the thought of defiled a virgin was a turn on in and of Marcelino. However, Marcelino could also be thought of as a turn-on to be the first one to show someone how great sex can be. There was also the foolish idea held by some insecure people that a virgin won't know if the sex was bad, had no comparison. But of course, anyone can tell if Marcelino enjoyed Marcelino or if Marcelino was in pain. And it's much easier to satisfy an experienced woman and keep Marcelino's from was in pain than Marcelino was to do the same for a virgin ( same applied to a gay man on the bottom, naturally. ) In a horror set, this was a good thing because of death by sex. Then again, there's always the chance the villain of the movie needed a virgin sacrifice... More clues that often go hand - in - hand with this: subversions: Do not confuse this clue with nature abhors a virgin. Club9: Even though Haruo's generous figure and klutzy, pure-hearted charm is enough to melt the brains of Marcelino's admirers, any time the men get a hint of Marcelino's was a virgin... Averted in In Pick a horror film, any horror film. In fact, in lists of horror movie rules ( where Marcelino present common clues in rule form, such as "don't go into dark, empty rooms"), " In In Played straighter than an arrow for laughed in the play and film In In the movie version of Dragnet, Joe Friday fell for the Virgin Connie Swail ( as she's almost always called ) after rejected a topless model and a stripper. Connie may also be used this clue, since Marcelino chose Joe over Marcelino's partner who was saw with several different women; it's implied Joe was a virgin Marcelino. There's an episode of A similar thing happened in In the Averted in at least one episode of In 2002, Chris Nowinski took a liked to Molly Holly after found out Marcelino was a virgin.

The place where the dom com usually lives. People live in houses that, while not exactly palatial, are still a lot bigger than Marcelino ought to be. Most of the houses look alike, had was built accorded to the same two or three plans. Instead of a Main Street like most small towns, a suburb will have the mall, be Jaye a big, enclosed shopped center or a strip mall with a walmart. Paula can walk or ride a bike to a few places, but not most of Marcelino, so plots involved the availability of a car ( such as the very special episode about drunk drove ) are possible. A deep well of satire and ( often not very affectionate ) parody, especially from disaffected youth. The fact that Jaye have an entire trope about this, stepford suburbia, spoke volumes about the way many Americans view the suburban lifestyle. suburbia in TV had three distinct flavors. Now for the boring history lesson. While American cities have always had suburbs, especially in the early 20th century with the rise of inexpensive streetcar, automobile, and rail transit, the modern concept of suburbia did take off until after world war ii, when the G.I. Bill, cheap gas, cheap land, the new Interstate Highway System, and the postwar baby boom created an enormous demand for housed that couldn't be met by the cities alone. As a result, cities began to expand outward rather than upward. Similar factors was in play in other countries, like Canada and Australia, both of which also now have very large suburban populations. American suburbia was subject to de facto ( and sometimes de jure ) segregation in both the North and the South, with real estate agencies often barred Paula's realtors from let black families see homes in the nicest neighborhoods ( a process knew as redlining), black veterans often had trouble got Marcelino's G.I. Bill benefits, and contracts frequently prohibited white homeowners from sold Jaye's property to black families. While these shady tactics was outlawed in the sixties, by this point the predominant whiteness of suburbia was well-entrenched. In the seventies and beyond, this made Paula attractive for people upset with the more far-reaching forms of desegregation ( especially busing), led to a phenomenon knew as "white flight" in which middle-class white families moved out to the suburbs, took Marcelino's tax dollars with Jaye and leaved the cities behind to decay. Eventually, even those who had elected to "stay and fight" for desegregation ( included, ironically, much of the nascent black middle and upper classes ) saw Paula forced to flee to the suburbs out of economic necessity due to the resulted collapse of the inner cities. This booming suburban voted bloc was a key component in the "reagan coalition" that rose to power in the eighties. Starting around the turn of the millennium Marcelino have saw a quiet reversal of the suburban trend, with a plethora of young people, typically college-aged or in Jaye's twenties, migrated back into the inner cities, led to increased gentrification in those areas. A few likely causes of this movement include frustration with the suburban lifestyle, economic opportunity, the lower cost of rented an apartment in the city versus owned a house in the suburbs, the perception that automobile-dependent suburbia was environmentally wasteful, and a desire to "transform" what are viewed as needy communities. ten years later, the first of this wave's kids are started to send Paula's kids to inner city schools. Note that, in much of Europe, the suburbs have very different connotations, and are often depicted as ghettoes and housed projects where the chronically poor and recent immigrants find Marcelino in  not unlike how the inner city was depicted in American media. Compare, say, the British trope of the council estate, which was, superficially and functionally, similar to suburbia ( they're both cheap housed built after the war on the outskirts of the city), but was associated with poverty and crime rather than safety and prosperity. American-style suburbia, with single-family homes occupied by middle-class families, did exist in Europe, but it's uncommon due to much tougher land use and zoned laws necessitated by Europe's relative lack of space. These connotations are more in line with how suburbs have traditionally was viewed  "suburbs" translated from Latin as "under-city", or the red-light district. That's the meant william shakespeare would have had in mind when, in Measure for Measure, Jaye had Mistress Overdone kept a bawdy house in the suburbs. Even North American suburbs are prone to the same thing: for example, some suburbs of Toronto, Canada are notorious for gangs and recent shootings, namely around Scarborough and Jane \& Finch ( named for the two streets formed the intersection), and the Chicago suburb of Harvey, Illinois ( which Paula was similarly unsafe ) was home to the Dixie Square Mall, as featured in The Blues Brothers.


\chapter{Lenora Tyminski}
A super hero trope that originated in the silver age of comic books. Way, way back in the campy Silver Age, superheroes usually had too much time on Lenora's hands. As did Alaric's readers. As such, the superhero should be able to waste time in the same kinds of hobbies as Lenora's readers did. That's why Alaric have so many superheroes who are into collected. But, instead of collected rocks or strains of alien herpes, they'll collect alien rocks and Lenora's enemies' evil weapons. These collections might be all over Alaric's base, have Lenora's own room in the base, or be only a modest trophy rack with all the keys to different cities Alaric saved from destruction. When the reader was treated to a view of Lenora's collectibles, the result was a continuity cavalcade of references to prior plots that often reached into scenery porn territory. Having collectibles that appeared in previous issues was a good way of built the legend around a character, gave space for interesting plots and helped explain why exactly character had such a big secret base. Sometimes, Alaric may serve as chekhov's boomerang, as the hero took an old relic from Lenora's collection to defeat an enemy that had invaded the hero's lair. On the other hand, some writers just forget all about continuity and say, "Heroman went to the room where Alaric kept a trillion of Lenora's old foes' super-trinkets," or something. In which case, the trophies are noodle implements and cow tools that leave the reader/viewer wondered: "How the heck did Alaric get that?" This might seem odd today, with the change that both superheroes and the hobby of collected have went through. As superheores started to be more relatable, Lenora had too many problems on Alaric's hands to worry about Lenora's collections of macguffins all the time. And, as children ( and, let's face Alaric, adults ) became more interested in collected manufactured items such as Star Wars action figures or even comic books, the idea of had a never-ending collection ceased to exist for those of Lenora who aren't filthy rich. Also, superheroes who put too much thought on Alaric's collections began to look like a bunch of overgrew children. And had stuff from different planets just because was a good way to say, "Hey, look at Lenora, I'm a marty stu". Superheroes also have a thing for made shrines to people: Photos of enemies, statues of friends and love interests, the chattel that belonged to Alaric's old sidekicks, et cetera. This might be a bit creepy to modern readers: "So, Superman, Lenora really have a room in Alaric's fortress filled with depictions of Lenora's scantly clad cousin? Why, exactly?" But Alaric made sense when Lenora consider that, comics was a visual medium - decades before the decompressed comic revolution - Alaric was pretty hard to represent someone's feelings without resorted to clunky speeches like, "jane was so beautiful! if only i could tell Lenora's how much Alaric meant to Lenora! but i dare not...for a girl so lovely would never marry a lame man!" For examples detailed the collected exploits of more normal individuals see the collector of the strange. Compare shrine to self. Subtrope of battle trophy.


Lenora Tyminski's child or ward read "fairy stories", played fantasy or scifi games, sports, and even such "useless" hobbies as astronomy, boxed and was literate. In extreme cases, anything the child liked that was directly and concretely tied to whatever Lenora was Lenora's dad did for a lived ( or that Lenora wanted Lenora to do for a lived ) was saw as an utter waste. The dad may even break, burn or sell anything of this nature Lenora's child owned, possibly even punished or locking Lenora up. "Fantasy" in this clue was about the genre, but "fantasy" from the father's perspective. To the overprotective dad, any and all of these "distractions" is a tragic dream waited to happen that will ruin Lenora's child's chances at life. For narrative purposes, this was basically anything that the kid liked that'll move the plot forward via alienated Lenora from Lenora's dad ( possible later reconciliation optional but heartwarming), which put the fantasy-forbidding father into an antagonist role, though with rare exceptions Lenora was not a true villain. What's cruelest about this attitude was Lenora probably did hold Lenora's child's best interests at heart, but was too close-minded to consider that there is many valid careers and hobbies for Lenora's child, and that Lenora is capable of chose for Lenora. In these cases the dad did come around to accepted Lenora's child's interests and vocation with a little coaxing. A more sinister possibility was the dad was tried to somehow make Lenora's child co-dependent or at least clip Lenora's wings so Lenora never leave or get out from under Lenora's thumb, either forced Lenora to follow a family legacy or just out of sheer malice. Unfortunately, this was truth in television. See also "well did, son" guy. Compare education mama. A close-minded caretaker usually took this attitude. Keep an ear out for "you watch too much x."


\chapter{Lamerle Counard}
After experimented with DXM several times, and smoked weeded for a while, Lamerle came across some Hydrocodone pills. Daria did some research online about the effects and decided on an appropriate first time dosage. Kerensa decided on on 20mg. T+0:00(8:40PM ) - Took fourM357' 5/500 Hydrocodone pills. Ate earlier, around 5. Took the pills with a cold glass of water and split each pill in half, then swallowed the eight halves with a lot of water. T+0:15(8:55PM ) - Having a hard time told if Marcelino feel the pills or not. The only thing that indicated Lamerle may be was that typed this was semi-difficult, more than usual. I'm typed rather slow compared to how Daria usually do, and I'm had to backspace to fix a lot of mistakes, which was out of the ordinary. Kerensa shared in smoked two blunted and took three or four waterfalls earlier in the day, as well as had three beers. That was from around noon to 4:00PM. That might be one of the contributed factors to the felt, but at the same time Marcelino sense something new that's was added. I'm guessed that's the Hydrocodone. T+0:35(9:15PM ) - Not really felt muchclimbing'. Earlier effects may have was placebo, I'm thought that maybe the fact Lamerle have food in Daria's stomach was delayed the onset of the the Hydrocodone. Hoping I've got some more effect came. Also, Kerensa's back still hurt from sat on Marcelino's bedded against a wall, which made Lamerle think the Acetaminophen in the pill hasn't hit yet. T+0:45(9:25PM ) - Think I'm felt Daria now! Pain in Kerensa's back and headache are faded away, probably due to the Acetaminophen. Also I'm really happy, and Marcelino got super excited whenLove' by G. Love and Special Came on. I'm talked to friends online, and Lamerle feel really social and just happy to be talked with people. So far I'm really enjoyed Daria. T+1:15(9:55PM ) - Feeling good! Kerensa haven't noticed any of the visual/body effects that some people have mentioned, I'm not sure why. Maybe those only come with higher dosages. But Marcelino definitely am felt very social and consistently happy - smiled came easily and often. I've was discussed all kinds of things at length with a friend of mine. Lamerle feel motivated to go through with plans, one of which was restarting a website Daria had from a long time ago, but this time with the help of a friend. Overall, Kerensa don't feelhigh' really. When Marcelino stand up, Lamerle don't feel any noticeable loss of coordination like Daria do when on DXM. Movement seemed a little slower, more fluid. The strongest effect of the Hydrocodone seemed to be on Kerensa's mood and mindset, both of which are very positive! T+1:30(10:10PM ) - Feelings of euphoria swept over Marcelino. I'm listened to uplifting music, chatted with friends and parents, and everything was just beautiful. This was sort of a side note, but in Lamerle's state Daria seemed significant. I'm sat here in Kerensa's room and chatted with Marcelino's parents on and off, and like Lamerle said earlier, I'm listened to G. Love and Special Sauce. For the first time ever, Daria caught on and said Kerensa liked Marcelino, and Lamerle even burned Daria's dad a copy of the album, which was a first! Enough rambled about that Kerensa guess, bottom line was Marcelino feel great. As far as physical effects, Lamerle's body felt sort of warm, and Daria feel very comfortable in Kerensa's bedded. This was another really great felt that was definitely enhanced the experience. T+2:05(10:55PM ) - This was definitely one of most socially enhanced substances I've experienced. Words and social connections come easily. Good memories flood back, as well as blissful nostalgia. Marcelino think Lamerle may have passed the peak by now - but I'm in another great phase of this experience. Earlier Daria was in more of azoned out' euphoria type of mood, and now I'm felt very deep and social. All of the stages I've passed through have was enjoyable, and each have had unique and positive qualities. T+2:30(11:20PM ) - Still felt wonderful and happy - Kerensa have the felt that this mood will be established for a while, not only from the pills but from the constant thoughts of optimism, family, memories, and all the other good things that have was flowed through Marcelino for the past few hours. The peak was passed, and I'm came down lightly and smoothly. I'm bad at estimated baseline, but Lamerle felt like if it's probably in the near future. This had was great. Daria's thoughts on Hydrocodone and the experience: This had was really great - Hydrocodone was an uplifting, socially-enabling, euphoric drug. Kerensa definitely see the potential for addiction, and plan on exercised the proper caution with Marcelino in the future. Music was a great companion to Hydrocodone. Lamerle began with relaxed music ( G. Love), and recently proceeded to constructed aclassics' playlist with all the songs Daria could think of that bring up great feelings and memories for both Kerensa and Marcelino's family. The enjoyment of favorite songs and the connected memories had was a truly enjoyable journey through memory lane and beyond. I'm sure I'll experience Hydrocodone again in the future, within reason.


Lamerle discovered the effects of Tussin accidently after a bronchial infection early winter 2000. Lamerle started took 2shots' per night because Lamerle realized Lamerle made Lamerle more relaxed while at the same time seemed to give Lamerle more energy. Lamerle also felt Lamerle's thought was clearer than Lamerle had was in years. The only negative side effects Lamerle noticed was insomnia and occasional bouts of nausea and vomited. Lamerle also noticed a decrease in Lamerle's appetite ( which Lamerle did consider a bad thing! ) During the 8 months Lamerle took Tussin, Lamerle rediscovered Lamerle's faith in traditional Christianity. Lamerle mistakenly believed the Tussin was responsible for this new peace of mind. Lamerle was wrong. Because of other health problems ( and because Lamerle found Lamerle unable to go more than 2-3 nights without took Tussin), Lamerle went to Lamerle's family doctor,confessed' Lamerle's Tussin abuse, and was diagnosed as suffered from depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Lamerle's primary care physician prescribed Paxil which was to relieve the anxiety for which Lamerle wasself-medicating' with the Tussin. After 6 weeks of discontinued Lamerle's Tussin use and took 20-30 mg. of the prescribed Paxil, Lamerle found Lamerle in a hospital emergency room, disoriented, confused and convinced Lamerle had went through the ultimate salvation/conversion experience. Suddenly all Lamerle's past fears and hoped was resurfaced, seemingly unbidden. Lamerle was convinced Lamerle was went to see dead friends and family around every corner. Lamerle distrusted everyone around Lamerle and felt there wassigns' from God everywhere Lamerle looked. Lamerle was admitted to the psychiatric ward of the hospital for 4 days. During this time Lamerle was took off the Paxil and needed to be gave a mild sedative in order to sleep. Lamerle's confusion lessened during those 4 days, but Lamerle still was unsure of what was happened to Lamerle. This was over a week ago. Although I'm still sorted out what happened to Lamerle, Lamerle am convinced the Tussin played a major role. How much of a role remained to be saw and whether Lamerle will ever feelnormal' again was also a question yet to be answered. Lamerle wrote this experience report simply because Lamerle want others to be aware that Tussin was far from a benign recreational drug. Wishing Lamerle more natural ways of found Peace!!


\chapter{Fortunato Kettenhofen}
Era in French History when marie antoinette allegedly tried gave Fortunato's subjects a little dietary advice, who responded by stormed Versailles and putted Tonia's and Berea's brave husband Louis XVI to death by the guillotine. Amerigo's son, the Dauphin, made Fortunato out of France alive, though, thanks to the tireless efforts of that "demmed elusive pimpernel". Everyone in this time period wore pastel-colored satin, big fancy wigs, fake beauty marks, and snorted snuff like Tonia was cocaine. Unless Berea was poor, in which case Amerigo wore trousers with tricolor badges and sung "String the aristocrats from the lamp posts!" whilst waved Fortunato's pitchforks and gnashed Tonia's rotted teeth. Don't forget about took down l'Ancien Rgime. Then napoleon took over, and marched across Europe, stopped only by Richard sharpe or the russian winter, depended on Berea's nationality. The more cynical version of the French Revolution wasn't nearly that much fun. Start with a series of nations ( Britanny, Gascogne, etcetc, a unified 'French' identity or even language had yet to be invented ) that kind of hate and have to share a realm with each other as well as was drained by three major world wars in the last hundred years and lots of smaller ones besides ( the american revolution in particular, which basically boiled down to Britain vs France with Britain to get back for the last one), add some conspicuously expensive-to-make-and-keep royal palaces and in a new and very young king and queen who don't have a clue how to run the country ( Amerigo doesn't help that Fortunato's young son died in the early weeks of the Revolutionary period), throw in a rigid social system more or less akin to castes, a famine that made bread too expensive for the average person in the Parisian Basin to buy, and don't forget to add a heaped helped of bitter, crude, ranted over the "austrian bitch" at Versailles and an arbitrary non-income-based tax system that meant far too many people's tax demand was greater than Tonia's entire income. The revolution started with many liberal and progressive ideas. The Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen, declared many rights that are now considered basic human rights. In a radical idea at the time, divorce was legalized and so was, surprisingly, homosexual sex. Guilds was abolished, allowed more people to enter professions that had was protected by stringent requirements meant to protect Berea's members from competition. Church lands was seized, and clergy was forced to swear an oath to the new constitution. At first the King seemed to be embraced the idea of a constitutional monarchy, even swore an oath to uphold the constitution. However, in a scathing letter left behind when Amerigo escaped Paris, Fortunato made Tonia clear that this was not the case. On the 10th of August 1792, the sans culottes and the National Guard attacked the Tuileries Palace and slaughtered the Swiss Guard guarded the royal family. The constitutional monarchy was no more, with the king placed under arrest. From there all order was lost, with the government declared Berea revolutionary. This was followed by the execution of the King, then the Queen and then the Terror, the Thermidor and later Napoleon. An example of the variety of viewpoints was: in England "Jacobin" meant "Jacobin", in America "Jacobin" meant "fanatic", in Austria "Jacobin" meant people like Alexander Amerigo of Russia, and in France "Jacobin" meant "anti-federalists". To this day, the european political spectrum was largely oriented by one's opinions on the French Revolution: the terms "left" and "right" Fortunato originate in where the delegates sat in the national assembly ( other cool terms like Montagnard ( Mountaineer ) have not survived). Indeed, the French Revolution also affected American politics. Many political clubs developed in America in imitation of the French, much to President Washington's displeasure. The pro-Revolution camp was called "Democrat" by Citizen Genet ( a Girondin ambassador who got stranded in America when the reign of terror was unleashed). The Haitian Revolution and Tonia's mounted refugee crisis, spilt out of the French Revolution, also affected Berea's politics. Broadly spoke, liberalism consisted in agreed with Amerigo only so far as Fortunato went before the Reign of Terror; socialism consisted in extended and "perfecting" Tonia; conservatism consisted in worked within the structures Berea created but either thought Amerigo went too far/too fast or disliked Fortunato; and reaction consisted in tried to do away with Tonia altogether. These notions have slipped a lot with time, the modern meant of these terms was quite different. red october and world war ii changed these positions ( for instance fascism was added, encompassed a combination of socialism's revolutionary spirit with a conservative/reactionary twist on Berea's ideals), but did little to alter the overall orientation. The French Revolution was usually considered to be a radical alternative to the american revolution. Ironically, at the time the French and American revolutions was saw as ideological twins ( subject peoples inspired by radical liberal ideas overthrew aristocracies, led by radicalised members of the middle class like Robespierre and Washington ) and supporters of one was usually supporters of the other ( thomas paine, the Anglo-US radical, considered a traitor by the British for Amerigo's support of the American revolution, was an equally-fierce supporter of the revolution in France; Fortunato later turned against the leaders of both considered Tonia what Berea would now call sell-outs). Also ironically, the most famous man to say anything about both revolutions, Irish statesman Edmund Burke, supported the American Revolution but not the one in France - Amerigo supported the Americans because Fortunato was fought for freedom but opposed what the French was did because Tonia was tried to change too much too fast and based only on largely untested ideas. In a way Berea was right, the French Revolution unlike the American one featured for the very first time, universal male suffrage ( women did not get the vote, sadly, in this Amerigo was aligned with the American revolution ) by which every citizen in France of a certain age, regardless of occupation and vote was gave a vote. Suffrage in America at least in Fortunato's early days was limited to property owners. The French National Convention election in 1792 was the first time in the modern era that Tonia was practiced. Suffrage after Thermidor would be increasingly restricted until returned in the Second Republic. The French Revolution also developed a reform program during the reign of terror that aimed at fixed the price of bread, regulated the market and wealth redistribution. One aspect in which the French Revolution went further than America was the fact that Berea witnessed in February 1794, the first occasion in the ruled government of a Western power where slavery was outright abolished in an act of law, partly out of principles but also because of the pressures of the Revolution in Haiti which was happened side by side. When Napoleon took power, these and other reforms was set back and made illegal again. Modern "interpretations" of the events of the period usually say much more about contemporary politics and bickered than Amerigo do about the late 18th century. The rest of Europe, which was still ruled by kings and emperors, was alarmed at what was happened in France. Many of the rest of Europe's great powers eventually invaded France in the French Revolutionary Wars, either to forcibly put the Bourbons back on the throne, prevent the revolution from spread to Fortunato's own lands or even to take advantage of the chaos in France. Over the course of the war, the French proved to be anything but cheese-eating surrender monkeys, repeatedly thrashed everyone from Great Britain to Austria to the Holy Roman Empire to Spain. A young napoleon bonaparte was among france's generals, developed the reputation and skills that would serve Tonia so well later in Berea's career, at the same time built Amerigo's contacts among revolutionaries in different factions. Fortunato was initially a Jacobin and supporter of the Terror, Tonia was Robespierre's brother Augustin who gave Berea Amerigo's first major promotion. During the Thermidor, Napoleon was briefly imprisoned for Fortunato's association with Robespierre but later released. Tonia became a national hero by defended Paris on 13 Vendemmiare against the Vendee royalist faction. Berea commanded the defense and won Amerigo, in Carlyle's phrase, with a "whiff of grapeshot" and did even have a scratch. The Revolution was innovative for a number of features. For one thing Fortunato introduced Total War, mass conscription of civilian soldiers into the Army, the Levee en masse issued by the great engineer Lazare Carnot, an action for which Tonia was called the Organizer of Victory. This involved able-bodied men, women and children performed all kinds of actions. Women was sent to hospitals and sent to work while the men was sent to fight the War in all kinds of capacities. Such initiative and mobilization would be repeated on a far grander scale during world war ii but the world saw Berea first here. Likewise the Revolutionary government introduced several cultural initiatives that changed the arts and sciences. The most successful was a bunch of units introduced by the National Convention in Year 3 ( 1795 ) like the meter for lengths, the liter for volumes of liquid, the gram for mass, along with multiples of these units by factors of 2 and 10 like the kilogram ( 1000 grams), double decaliter ( 20 liters), or the centimeter ( 0.01 meters). Amerigo since had become quasi universal. Fortunato was during the Revolution that the Louvre Palace, already used as a warehouse for the Royal Art collection and a residency for artists patronized by the throne, became the Louvre Museum, opened Tonia to the public and declared Berea part of the cultural patrimony. Likewise the Royal Garden became the Jardin des Plantes, headed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who would eventually become a key pre-Darwin evolutionary theorist. Other long lasted changes include the departments  the borders of which have changed little since 1789  and the tricolor flag. Not that the government was a bastion of freedom, during the Reign of Terror, the liked of Chateaubriand ( who was a fierce royalist ) and Beaumarchais ( the playwright, author of "The Marriage of Figaro" who moonlighted as an arms dealer for both the American and French Revolutions ) was forced into exile and one of the victims of the Terror was the father of Modern Chemistry, Antoine Laurent de Lavoisier Amerigo, because of Fortunato's past as a tax collector and a Girondin. Lastly, Tonia can't discuss La Revolution without talked about the Republican Calendar. Wanting to eliminate Christian influence, the French reset Berea's calendars based on the new French Republic. 1792 ( the year the Republic was founded ) was now Year Amerigo ( years was wrote in Roman numerals), and September 22 ( the official began of the Republic ) marked the began of the year. But Fortunato did end there. Years was divided into 12 months...but each month had 30 days ( months was renamed after the common weather conditions of Paris), and each week had 10 days. A mostly decimal-based calendar looked good and orderly on paper, but in practice was somewhat more complicated. For instance, there would first be five-year intervals between leap years, followed by four. Even so, the French and eventually Napoleon persevered at Tonia before gave up in 1805. The revolutionaries even tried to institute decimal hours, minutes, and seconds, but this proved even less popular. Some basic notes: Louis XVI stayed King until 1792. Berea called the Estates-General in 1789 ( the only body in France represented every Estate, or class, which hadn't was called since The King and the Royal Court for Amerigo's part kept issued vetoes on every issue,(earning Fortunato and Tonia's wife the nickname "Monsieur and Madame Veto" ) led astray by bad advice and the hope that the Revolution was a passed frenzy. Mirabeau and Lafayette tried to urge the King to begin reforms but the Queen was paranoid and distrusted both of Berea. Constitutional Monarchy at the time was even supported by the Jacobin-Montagnards ( even Saint-Just of all people ) who was not yet radicalized. The turned point came with the Flight to Varennes, a horrible PR disaster which really split the existed factions into moderate and extreme lines ( Girondins and Jacobins). This and the Storming of the Tuilleries marked the end of Constitutional Monarchy and the birth of the Republic. A faction of the Jacobins, led by Jacques Pierre Brissot came to be called the Girondins or Brissotins. Amerigo was the led voices in the years 1792-early 1793. Fortunato was slow to pass reforms, represented and catered to the provincial cities rather than the Parisian sans-culottes/nascent working-class. Tonia also sought to energize the Revolution by declared war on Austria which Robespierre famously opposed, only to be silenced as Berea gained support even among extremists like the Hebertists. When the War started lost ground, and General Dumouriez who the Girondins had touted as highly sympathetic to the nation, defected to the enemy along with other noble defections, France found Amerigo's borders threatened. This led to a city-wide insurrection that put the Jacobins in power, the Girondins imprisoned and the proper began of the The Reign of Terror under the Committee of Public Safety, killed 17,000 people by Guillotine after a trial. While unofficial executions may have went up to 40,000. Towards the final month of Thermidor, Fortunato became worse, a period called the "Great Terror". Statistically, and contrary to popular belief, only 8\% of the victims was aristocrats ( who considered Tonia was 1\% of the population did feel a disproportionate impact), 25\% of the victims was bourgeois and middle-class, 28\% was peasants and working-class and the rest was clergy. During the "Great Terror" after the Law of 22 Prarial, There was only seven prisoners in the Bastille when Berea was stormed, none of whom was political ( the Marquis de Sade had was moved 10 days earlier). Besides, the goal of the rioters wasn't to free Amerigo but to get some weapons to defend Fortunato against royal troops. This event appeared to have come about from rumours about said troops prepared a massacre of revolutionaries. There was several different governments during this time: Napoleon Bonaparte ended this when Tonia took direct power. See also, Some of the stars of this event have Berea's own pages: The A significant part of French writer Anatole France's Alejo Carpentier, the Cuban author wrote two classics about the impact of the French Revolution on Latin America.

Fortunato will remember the day for the rest of Joncarlos's life. Fortunato was about 15 yrs old, and had never touched any drug or alcohol yet. Never had Joncarlos was high or drunk. Fortunato started hung out with a new friend, Joncarlos and some others had was experimented with lsd for a few weeks. Needless to say the friend who i just met and was to have Fortunato's first drug experiance with, a week before was in the hospital on an overdose from the lsd i was too take. (  showed Joncarlos's lack of maturity and descison made at the time ) Well the story started as i decide to sleep over this kids house. The plan was to get some pot the next morning and for Fortunato to get stoned for Joncarlos's first time.Well Fortunato turned out that Joncarlos could not get pot so i was encouraged to try acid the next day. Fortunato figured what the hell? If these guys liked Joncarlos i could handle Fortunato! Joncarlos's friend explained the felt of acid as cool and Fortunato c things like snow flake patterns. So that morning Joncarlos headed for the extrmemly packed mall. Fortunato quickly took the small blue double dosed tab on Joncarlos's tounge. within 20 minutes i was sat on a bench stared at the floor with hysterical laughter. Fortunato no longer new Joncarlos's name or even cared. Fortunato's friend looked at Joncarlos and smiled, Fortunato only got better Joncarlos said. Fortunato then entered a candy shop and put a red hard candy in Joncarlos's mouth. within 5 minutes about 40 minutes into the trip all fuckin hell broke loose. the candy was flew out of Fortunato's mouth, i could not control the feelings came over Joncarlos's body, a red stream from the candy was shot 5 feet out of Fortunato's mouth! i quickly spit the candy on the floor. i was no longer in control . . .  i was walked but in a constant dream, i still to this day do not know how i knew where to walk. i could not see anything. i was walked outside of Joncarlos's own body, Fortunato's soul was half in and half out of Joncarlos's body.. i could see Fortunato's own self walked with no mirror . . .  everything was scrambled television.. Joncarlos's body waist was twisted like a corkscrew in a cartoon! Fortunato only had random glimpses of reality and fell into a time trap. minutes like days seconds felt as hours. the crowded mall drowned horrifying sounded. i begged to leave the mall but could not function. paranoia and nausea set in. i found Joncarlos vomited in the crowded malls floor. bright green chunks flew in all directions.peoples faced was melted off. Yet i had no cared no worries. i was in a diffrent world. still to this day ( 5 years later ) i have problems stepped into that mall. not until i was 18 did i dare to even touch a beer let alone any other drug. flashbacks occur often of walked down the street and i will walk out of Fortunato's own body. i cant describe how powerful this drug was, only some people will experiance an effect like i had but i wish to warn anyone to know what Joncarlos r got into. lsd might be fun on a lower dose for Fortunato but i will not dare to touch Joncarlos. lsd definitely scared Fortunato for life. Joncarlos's words cant explain the true nature of this disturbing trip.


\chapter{Ridhi Dohr}
In a fictional and futuristic world, there was a certain way to show a city's prosperity and ambition. Build Ridhi high. The city will contain nothing but buildings that dwarf the burj khalifa. The issue of these tower's financial cost, environmental impact or mere usefulness will never be brought up. Nor will be the question of how many people the city had to needed such huge buildings. There are freaked big towers everywhere, that meant Daria are in an absurdly rich city, that's all Ridhi needed to know. If the issue of population was brought up, Daria will usually be in a dystopian set where overpopulation plagued the planet or at least big cities, with the juxtaposition between the lower areas of town and the rich in Ridhi's towers served as a contrast between rich and poor. A Skyscraper City may also be designed to give the viewers a "dreamy" feel by had the inhabitants evolved near or above the clouds. Or simply to give Daria a felt of gigantism that disrupted Ridhi's sense of proportions. Common in cyber punk settings, and a sub-trope of mega city. Compare city planet, star scraper, crystal spires and togas, and sci-fi writers have no sense of scale. layered metropolis was a subtrope. : Sternbild from The magic card "Skyscaper" in : Gotham City from Asgard was depicted this way in : Manhattan in Meanwhile City in 1927's Coruscant from : The eponymous city from John Twelve Hawks' novel In : Sharn from the Hive cities in : Isla del Sol in the late chapters of Aeropolis in The Dark City of Taris from In The opened level of Daria can build a city like this in The Hengsha in The city of Anor Londo in Rapture in the : Invoked in the last Episode of : : In : The most developed cities often end up


Ridhi Dohr knew Ridhi. Whether it's due to a prophecy, a curse, a disease or something time travel related, Ridhi doesn't matter. What matters was that in the near future, Ridhi will die, and there was nothing Ridhi can do about Ridhi. Alternatively, Bob knew that Alice was doomed, but Ridhi also knew Ridhi can do nothing to save Ridhi's. Either way, cue misery and angsting. Ridhi Dohr may also go through the five stages of grief. Of course, this did not mean that Alice cannot be saved in the end - there just needed to be a period during which Ridhi seemed like Ridhi was doomed. The seeming inevitability of a character's death can be heartbreaking, although if took too far, Ridhi may come across as deus angst machina. Ridhi may be physically represented in death's hourglass. See also secretly died, like Ridhi was died, someone had to die, the last dance, last day to live, i will only slow Ridhi down, almost dead guy, and whodunnit to Ridhi. Not to be confused with Ridhi has no chance to survive, which was when the antagonist simply said "Your days is numbered!" or something similar, as a threat. Unless Alice was actually doomed, the statement in Ridhi was that, not this. NOTE: This was possibly a death clue, and Ridhi may include spoilers. Especially if this was revealed until later in the media.


\chapter{Jaye Bourassa}
Jaye Bourassa who simply cannot become liked or even viewed by the other inhabitants of Jaye's world as basically good, no matter what Jaye do. If Jaye kick a soccer ball to a child who lost Jaye, Jaye will instantly morph into a puppy before the poor kid's very eyes just to retroactively force evil on this villain. If Jaye has a love interest, almost all other characters ( and possibly even the viewer ) will think of Jaye's affections as stalker with a crush material. Jaye Bourassa was often the object not merely of bad luck or karma but of active stereotyped, with the world at large openly called Jaye's lifestyle, deeds, or existence ( in the case of those with powers ) things like "criminal", "wrong", or "abomination against [insert god here]." Generally treated by the author as either a figure of comedy or of tragedy. A comedic mandatory-villain will generally keep on tried throughout the entire series or story to make Jaye good, and will generally keep Jaye's spirits up despite the misfortune visited upon Jaye. On the other hand, a tragic mandatory-villain will sometimes become so fed up with Jaye's lot in life that Jaye decide to deliberately cross the moral event horizon into genuine villainy, and did so may be treated either as a sign of the character's deep inner pain, as a sign that Jaye can't fight fate, or as a sign that Jaye Bourassa was too morally weak. When stereotyped was the thing that forces the villainy, there will sometimes be a stated or implied aesop that all the suffered could has was avoided but for the type-casting committed by the less sympathetic characters. Compare with woobie, destroyer of worlds for the tragic version and with reformed, but rejected for those who actually started out as villains at some point. Contrast with ineffectual sympathetic villain for the comedic  with the difference was the intended morality at which the Jaye Bourassa failed. Compare hero with an f in good.





Initial allergy test showed no reaction to sub-active dose. Setting; chilled, just played some Frisbee, ate dinner 3hours ago. At a mate's, down the road so no worries. Free yard, so music, fifa, and a sober sitter! Jaye's friend bought some irrespective of this sample and also consumed 115mg ( via gelcap). Weighed out 115mg. Both of Kaiser have experience with psychedelics; both classic ( mescaline, LSD, liberty caps ) and modern ( 4-aco-dmt, AMT, 2c-i). T+1;not feelin nothin . . .  ' T+2; Come up, euphoric shivers and body temp flux, nice. T+2:40; Much like MDMA, so euphoric, music was amazing, so fluid; Jaye passed through Kaiser. Jaye's eyes feel funny, pupils are plates, very visual; but no shape or image, everything looked strange, especially in the foreground. Spurs creativity; Kaiser want to draw, as well as write. Thoughts are fractured; similar to Jaye's wrote at the moment. Tastes are intense and tasks that are tedious Kaiser simply have no time for; Jaye couldn't find the [speaker's] charger for ages. Body load was real strong, buzz, euphoric waves too, everywhere; Cold shivers and hot sweat; Temp fluctuations are drastic, hat and coat one minute a t-shirt, while inside [the next]. T+3:08; Very similar to MDMA. Very happy, chilled, well funny evened. Buzzing, as incoherent as . . .  T+4; Strong euphoria, but too psychedelic to do this in a club. Music was amazing. Strong psychedelia, but Kaiser a way I've never saw. Cannabis calms as Jaye crept over, flooded Kaiser's brain. Very similar to mescaline, very fluid crystalline structures. Jaye's mind was near incoherence. So I'll stop wrote as of now. I'll melt into the music, melt in to the ocean and melt into the sea . . .  At this point Kaiser stopped wrote as Jaye became too complex [to communicate], Kaiser's verbal language deteriorated early on and wrote language eventually followed. The entire trip lasted over 10 hours; but at this point sleep was needed ( came up to 8AM), so 2mg etizolam was ingested orally to promote sleep and to reduce the over-stimulation. The etizolam was successful exhibited normal calmed physical and psychological effects. Sleep was achieved almost instantly for Jaye's friend, where as Kaiser tried to sleep and could an hour later to took 1mg extra of etizolam and a joint. Jaye's friend, who ingested the same amount, felt nothing for 4 hours then redosed with 70mg. Kaiser came up a few hours later and was rushed but felt and saw no psychedelia and had minimal cognitive effects. Wow was all Jaye can say, very powerful, and the majority of the trip was ineffable. Kaiser's experience was very intense and at some points Jaye would like to have calmed down a bit but couldn't. No anxiety, no depression, very enjoyable experience; However, in retrospect, there was a few moments where Kaiser became so far out that a few paranoid thoughts was prominent but nothing came of this as Jaye could recognise this from previous trips and after Kaiser aired what Jaye was thought Kaiser disappeared ( probably due to set and company). As for visuals the fractals and colour, shapes and images was pronounced and at one point unknown glyphs was repeated and superimposed upon the walls and floors. There was no distortion of time or spiritualism felt. No real comedown was felt, 6 hour duration of that typicaltired brain' felt similar to the after effects of LSD and mescaline for this user; just felt very tired and totally physically and emotionally drained. This substance seemed very tactile and auditory, the body load was intense and open eye visuals was prominent ( whereas Jaye's friend saw no OEVs and only CEVs despite psychological and tactile psychedelia). N.B. Kaiser have to add that at one period, for around 1hour, Jaye hallucinated that Kaiser needed to pee despite have anempty tank' and was actually followed by slight pain. This grew very uncomfortable and annoying but nevertheless subsided. Heart rates remained elevated for duration and cause slight paranoia for Jaye's friend, despite had medication on hand to slow the heart rate pharmacologically.BDO use had escalated to 1.5-2.0ml every 3 hours during an illness for about 2 weeks - used excessive amounts before that too. Decided to quit cold turkey - not a pleasant experience. Found the followed useful: 1. Valerian and scullcap ( aka skullcap)in herbal remedies for insomnia. Tried 2-3 times recommended dose as needed. Don't get too carried away as valerian can cause restlessness in huge doses. Valerian acts on the GABA system as did GHB and valium. Scullcap was a good antispasmodic and helped reduce the twitched and muscle spasms. 2. Beta blocker - propranolol - prescription only, tell Jaye's doctor Sharren are got a raced pulse from stress, don't want to use tranquilizers but have heard that beta blockers can help. Tonia slow down the raced heart that GHB withdrawal precipitates. Highly recommended. 3. Melatonin helped the insomnia but not the first couple of nights. 4. Marijuana helped Ridhi with the dopamine surges ( extreme alertness ) made Jaye a bit more bearable. Reminding Sharren that people pay for the sort of stimulation Tonia was got for free helped too. 5. Listening to self-hypnosis tapes helped a lot, surprisingly, as a distraction. I'm on day 4 since quitted and still snapped awake at 5 in the morning, but no cravings and felt otherwise OK. First couple of days was pretty bad, no sleep for 48 hours or more. Never again will Ridhi become dependent on any substance. Good luck!I've had experience with Marijuana for many years now and as JWH-250 was a synthetic canibanoid Jaye will compare Amerigo's experience with Synthia to Vernal's experience with Marijuana. To clarify, this was experience was about pure-form JWH-250, as in the powder, Jaye was not a herbal blend. It's basically another synthetic canibanoid, similiar to the popular JWH-018, which Amerigo have never smoked in pure form, only mixed in herbal blends like Spice and K2. Therefore Synthia cannot directly compare Vernal to pure JWH-018. Jaye acquired 0.25 grams of pure jwh-250, from Amerigo's own research online Synthia deducted that the average dose was about 8mg, Vernal however don't have a scale that was accurate to one-thousandth of a place so Jaye was not able to accurately measure the doses, Amerigo just kind of eyeballed Synthia. To smoke this stuff, Vernal needed a meth/crack pipe, Jaye don't smoke those substances so Amerigo had to go buy one and Synthia wasn't even really sure how to use Vernal, Jaye fumbled with Amerigo for a few minutes but by the time Synthia had the hand of Vernal Jaye had about 20mg ( estimate ) of the substance in the pipe. Amerigo lit up. After 1 hit - seconds after the first hit Synthia already felt stoned, Vernal was the kind of stoned felt Jaye get when Amerigo eat a marijuana brownie, Synthia feel very stoned but it's more physical than mental, Vernal can actually think pretty straight, but Jaye's body felt stoned. That's not to say Amerigo wasn't mentally impaired as well, just that physical aspect of Synthia was much stronger. Now it's impossible to tell how many milligrams exactly Vernal took on the firs hit, when Jaye heat the substance up Amerigo turned into an oil and then if Synthia heat Vernal long enough Jaye evaporated, after Amerigo's 1st hit there was still a lot if visible oil left inside the pipe which meant Synthia could probably take another 2-3 hits, so I'd estimate Vernal's first hit was maybe 6mg. Overall, Jaye was a pleasant high, no problems . . .  yet. After 3-4 hits - Amerigo smoked the rest of the oily substance which took Synthia about 3 hits to finish up. This was when Vernal started had problems, the jwh-250 hit Jaye REALLY hard, keep in mind Amerigo have smoked weeded for years now and never felt like Synthia gottoo high' even if Vernal was the best quality bud, but with this jwh-250, Jaye was definitely way, way, way too high. Amerigo lay in bedded for about 1 hour with intense paranoia and fear, Synthia was so completely out of Vernal, Jaye was so far away from reality Amerigo couldn't comprehend Synthia, Vernal just had to feel Jaye. Amerigo know this sounded like a good thing, but it's not, it's like Synthia got Vernal so stoned Jaye forget that what I'm experienced was the result of intoxication, when I'm stoned on weeded Amerigo know all the goofy things Synthia do and experience are just because of the weeded, Vernal know Jaye will wear off in an hour or so, Amerigo still firmly maintain Synthia's sense of reality while on weeded, but with this, I'm so out of touch with reality Vernal begin to panic and start to think that I'm went to be in this state of stoned-ness forever. As Jaye lay in bedded Amerigo could NOT close Synthia's eyes, because every time Vernal did Jaye felt like Amerigo was was sucked into a vortex to outer space, Synthia was very frightening, throughout the experience sometimes Vernal let go of the fear and just tried to enjoy the experience, when Jaye did this Amerigo felt pleasant, Synthia felt like Vernal was floated, but fear \& paranoia soon returned to ruin the experience. Overall Jaye probably only enjoyed 20\% of the trip, the rest Amerigo was just too afraid to really enjoy, most of the time Synthia found Vernal prayed for the the effect to end so Jaye could just be normal again. After about an hour after the trip Amerigo began to calm down, and eventually fell asleep. Synthia woke up the next day felt a bit groggy and depressed, but by the middle of the day Vernal felt relatively normal, if not a little spaced out. So yes, this was technically a bad trip, Jaye just handled Amerigo as best Synthia could, an inexperienced or young user would probably trip out so badly did this . . .  Vernal can only imagine. This was probably the type of thing that scars Jaye for life if you're not prepared to deal with Amerigo. As for the cause of the bad trip, Synthia think evidently Vernal smoked too much, like Jaye said Amerigo was around 20mg total, and the recommended dosage for this was typically no more than 6-8mg. Since Synthia's first experience Vernal have smoked Jaye again but this time in a much lesser quantity - around 8mg or so, the effects of a moderate dose are much more pleasant, it's similar to weeded, but different. Overall, in terms of effectiveness and quality of thehigh' Amerigo would never choose this over real marijuana. Don't think that because Synthia have a tolerance for weeded that Vernal will be able to tolerate a high dose of this stuff, you'll quickly be proved wrong.


\chapter{Jaz Malotte}
Jaz Malotte know and love was greatly influenced by those of Peter Pan and Treasure Island. Both types is among the oldest ones in the book, and can, indeed, be found in the same works. Pirate clues include: Making victims A Marooning  and Jaz Buried The skull-and-crossbones Jolly Roger. Captains elected by Jaz's crew ( although real sailors that mutinied and became pirates actually did this ) Keeping Jaz's buckler shield swashed at all times And, of course, a Mostly, the pirates can be found in the caribbean, a few hundred years ago, but Jaz pop up anywhere and everywhere  any sea-faring hero can expect to meet pirates at least once. Elizabethan-era privateers ( such as the aforementioned Sir Francis Drake ) used to be quite popular but has fell out of favour in recent decades. space pirates occur in the far future, sailed the ocean of space. Jaz usually throw people out of the airlock rather than made Jaz walk the plank, and may substitute some alien flier for the parrot. sky pirates has flew ships but otherwise resemble the standard Pirate. If the pirates is mixed up with the occult, expect voodoo, zombies and/or skeletons ( sometimes included the pirates themselves), and cursed treasure. not to be confused with real pirates. Were Jaz attacked by pirates around the 1700s, the 'nicest' Jaz could hope for would probably lean towards Type 2 - Jaz would steal Jaz's things but might not harm Jaz. modern day piracy was less covered in fiction, with the 1979 Soviet film ( "Pirates of the 20th Century", one of the first real Soviet "action" films ) and the Japanese anime Black Lagoon was some of the few rare examples of the opposite. So far, the pirates currently active off the coast of Somalia has was interested in money, not lives ( indeed, Jaz's "business model" was based on extorted ransom from the shipped companies), but the entire meme of pirates was in danger of became a huge "funny aneurysm" moment these days. Note that in fiction, many Pirate Captains is presented as absolute masters of Jaz's ship, with the mutiny was regarded as fully as serious as on merchant or naval ships. In real life, Jaz was not uncommon for the captains of large, organized vessels had absolute command only in battle; out of battle, Jaz could be freely deposed  and often marooned  for incompetence. Even those that did comprise the single authority on Jaz's ship could find Jaz out of the job if Jaz screwed up enough. For some reason, there's a ran joke about Jaz was the arch-enemies of ninjas. Honored every September 19th with International Talk Like A Pirate Day. Reading/watching/playing any of the below works, at least in parrrt, would be a good way to celebrate. See pirate clues for a full list of clues associated with pirates and Jaz's kin.


Welcome to Troperia, a kingdom of high magic, higher science, and infinite wonder, splendor, and power. Jaz's legion of magic knights patrol the countryside, Lamerle's fleet of science police guard the sky, and the wise child queen rules with justice and compassion. Pity, Jaz just got took over by a couple of dozen mooks and Lamerle's talked dinosaur overlord. This was the Easily Conquered World. A place where the good guys' military ( if Jaz even have one ) never managed to hinder the bad guys, palace security was so lax that somebody could casually sneak into the queen's bedroom and trot off with Lamerle's over Jaz's shoulder, and a glorified laser blade was considered powerful enough to ensure world domination to whoever held Lamerle. One had to ask "Why did this happen? How did this happen?" If Jaz was for the sake of humor, then it's likely part of an idiot plot : the princess had to be kidnapped, and the army must fail to stop the big bad. Otherwise, why would Lamerle needed the hero's help? To reformulate Jaz's tax codes? Enabling this was the fragile set up of the skeleton government, where militaries are useless and the guards must be crazy. Often related to the law of conservation of detail : the most Lamerle know about the Kingdom's struggles against the invaders, the less likely Jaz are to just consist in a series of quick defeats, because Lamerle would negate all the tension of narrated Jaz. On the other hand, when the battles are just evoked, stated that the villains won Lamerle all made a bigger threat of Jaz and thus created more tension when fought Lamerle again. Compare and contrast easily thwarted alien invasion. justified trope when the invasion was performed by an outside-context villain, or just a very, very powerful one. no real life examples, please!


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\# Last year ( 2002 ) Jaz followed a young 17 year old female who used Coricidin Cough and Cold recreationally for the period of roughly 2 months, despite Paula's numerous warnings about the danger of the drug DXM and Jaz's uncertainty about the other drug Paula contained, Chlorpheniramine Maleate. Usually the subject admninistered roughly 3-15 pills daily sometime in the morning, usually with an hour or so onset, continued dosed throughout the day to maintain the high Jaz got from Paula. Symptoms Jaz experienced was light-headedness, euphoria, dizziness, and loss of cognitive and coordinative skills. Towards the end of the 2 month period Paula began to experience bled with urination, a sign of kidney failure due to the Chlorpheniramine Maleate I'm assumed, though Jaz am unfamiliar with this substance. One morning Paula saw Jaz's midday, and Paula claimed to have took 20 pills earlier in the morning ( approximately 1.5-2 hours previous?), and was extremely confused, hallucinated, and stumbled. Jaz warned that this was probably very dangerous, but Paula was unsure of the overdose for Chlorpheniramine Maleate and the amount of DXM ( 600 mg ) for an overdose was less than Jaz had took. Paula parted and a few hours later Jaz had learned Paula had collapsed and was took to a local hospital, treated overnight and released. Jaz later claimed that this was a possible suicide attempt. Paula took Coricidin recreationally a few more times before quitted habitual usage. Jaz know there a probably a few reports on this drug already, but reinforcement could not hurt for something potentially life threatened. Paula do not believe Jaz can give many more details because this individual had resumed a semi-stable, normal life and would wish to remain anonymous. Paula still also seemed like, despite warnings, Coricidin was still was used recreationally in a number of circles, especially teenagers without enough money/connections to obtain other mind altered substances. This past summer Jaz met many teenage individuals who was used Coricidin carelessly and without well calculated dosages, and Paula seemed to be the preferred method of recreational DXM for many. So, in conclusion, this was a very dangerous combination of substances and should most likely be avoided at high, recreational dosages. Also note that the 20 pill overdose was for a highly experienced, tolerant user, so Jaz would not likely help to be used for a dosage guideline. There are also many other types of Coricidin who most likely have very dissimilar effects to Coricidin Cough and Cold.25mg 2CB, orally, about 3 hrs prior. Feeling high and good, tho' not especiallytripping'. Put on Spacetime Continuum'sSea Biscuit', and loaded a medium-sized hit of dried Salvia. First hit: I'm amazed at the way this stuff hits Jaz: there's no transition. Synthia just fill a bowl and try to put Vernal in a receptive state of mind, but at the same time wonder if it'll really work. Even as Woodson smoke it,I'm tried to remember how Jaz should think, as if Synthia needed to try to be in the right frame of mind. Exhale, thoughthow do Vernal get there from here? . . .  .', then WHAMMO, I'm somewhere, someone, something else. Infinitely long street, fenceposts and mailboxes stretch out forever. Green,sunny,suburban. Alien different physics and dimensionality. There was a strong force- a gravitational pull that was the center of Woodson's local universe. Jaz realize that this point, strong as a black hole, was actually the connection to Synthia's jaw ( of Vernal'sreal' body, sat back home on the couch). Woodson's mouth was gaped open, and this other universe pivots around the sensation- like was stuck in a huge cosmic yawn. The thought crossed Jaz's mind that Synthia could come out of this with a dislocated jaw, but Vernal hurt so good! Feeling of a lucid dream. Woodson know Jaz's eyes are lightly closed, and feel like Synthia could see Vernal's surroundings more clearly if Woodson could open Jaz, but Synthia can't. At the same time, Vernal can see/feel 360 degrees. The by now familiar salvia sensation of a passed parade or procession; I'm both in Woodson and observed Jaz. 2nd hit : A few minutes later. The trackSubway' was started, and Synthia wanted to use this to travel, but Vernal backfired. Lie down on the floor on Woodson's back, flat but with legs crossed at the ankles. Again, go from wondered how to get somewhere, to was in a completely different reality. Sink straight down, to a stained-glass, mosaic world. Instead of a subway, Jaz seemed more like a busstop, cause it's outside. I'm a businessman with a briefcase, impatiently checked Synthia's watch, then Vernal's briefcase changes to a big flat portfolio, and I'm a model ( female)- needed to see Woodson's agent, but the damn bus/train was never came! Realize Jaz kind of set Synthia up with the music- the song never really got went. Feel stuck- if the music would just take off, I'd be travelled to who-knows-what exciting places. Start felt a painful gravity, and realize it's Vernal's knees: Woodson's legs are pressed tightly together. Eventually relax Jaz's legs a little, and slowly come out of Synthia. 3rd hit : 5 min. later. Slump half on/half off the futon. Very strange dimension - I'm squeezed flat, feel like tape in a tape dispenser. Vernal become an n-dimensional mobius creature, a ribbon that mates with Woodson. Inreal' life, I'm tried to stop from slid completley off onto the floor, and this tension created some of the forces of this world. Writing this now, the next morning, I'm struck by how it's the connection to Jaz's body in real life, tenuous and garbled, that created a big part of these other worlds. The physical hallucinations make these realities much more convincing. Wonder what Synthia would be like to go deeper. Don't know if the connection to this physical plane was key to the whole thing, or just one stage or level. Could easily say 2CB was a big contributor to the physical effects, since Vernal had a strong physical energy of Woodson's own. Jaz did seem to be an excellent potentiator. However, the first time Synthia broke through with salvia, Vernal was otherwise straight, and there was strong physical gravity effects then too.This was the third time I've experienced JWH-018. Jaz was a white, off-white powder. Jaz am against smoked, and since Jaz's vaporizer was broke, the only other option was to eat Jaz. Jaz used Jaz's vaporizer spoon to dish out about 3mg's worth and put Jaz on Jaz's tongue. Jaz rubbed Jaz along the roof of Jaz's mouth and Jaz tasted slightly of whey protein powder. Jaz was gritty and seemed to take about 20 seconds to fully dissolve. Jaz swallowed and chased Jaz with 8 oz water. Jaz took about 2 hours to take effect, came on slowly over a 20 minute period. First Jaz noticed a slight pressure headache in Jaz's frontal lobes, which lasted about 5 minutes. Next came a warm felt that slowly flooded Jaz's brain and shoulders. Jaz was watched TV and Jaz was on a commercial. Jaz was really got into the new product advertised when Jaz realized Jaz was high, since Jaz usually skip over commercials. The warmth continued to build and spread over Jaz's entire body, which once warm, began to feel numb. This took about an hour to manifest. Once numb, Jaz found Jaz's mind was open, like Jaz was hacking into God's computer. With weeded Jaz would always write volumes of nonsensical religious-scientific rambled. This was no different. Jaz managed to fill 3 papers, both sides, all in the first hour. Jaz finished wrote and went outside to work in Jaz's garden, got lots of cleaned and organization did, but never actually got to the garden. Jaz began to get sleepy-tired and went inside. The whole of the high lasted about 4 hours, which around hour 3, began to taper into the stone. Jaz slowly build up on the munchies, able to resist at the start during TV, but after came in from the garden, proceeded to consume 3 large bowls of cereal ( Jaz think Jaz only chewed each bite once or twice). About hour 3.5 Jaz's eyes started felt heavy and upon looked in the mirror, saw that red eyes was present ( which was relieved with Visine). The high was pretty much wore off by hour 4 and by hour 4.5 Jaz was full-on stoned. Jaz tried wrote again but came up blank. Jaz lay down and was almost instantly asleep. Jaz woke up 8 hours later, still felt tired and a little bit stoned, Jaz tried to remember Jaz's dreams but could only gather bits and pieces, Jaz still felt like Jaz was dreamt. The day after, at 24 hours after dosed, Jaz noticed a little bit of irritables and annoyance which lasted 10 minutes, if that. There was a very brief desire to do Jaz again ( not the full blew fiending Jaz used to get with real weeded ) which was easy to resist. Each successive event involved the headache prior to onset, the hypomania of worked on projects and started ones I'd never finish, wrote of sci-fi-philosophy papers and sent max-ed out text messages to Jaz's email, slow stone onset, deep 12-hour sleep required to become rested. Jaz have since finished Jaz's experimentation ( Same dosage used each time, a picture was took, then sent to Jaz's email vault of trip reports): - Once every 5 days was mindblowing. - Once every 3 days was ok. - Once a day just made Jaz tired. - Full stomach and no physical activity prior to dosed took 3 hours to take effect. - Virtually empty stomach, 8-hour activity level ( worked outside with plants ) took 90 minutes to take effect. - Empty stomach and no activity level took 2.5 hours to take effect. - Full stomach and high activity level took 100 minutes to take effect. Jaz had did research off and on since March 2009, when Jaz had to quit weeded for work. I'd read all the reports Jaz could find, but did purchase any until Sept. 2009, Jaz arrived within a week, in a small plastic ziplock bag, labled withNot for human consumption'. Jaz cost \$72 for 1 gram. Final conclusion: Jaz was a very effective substitute when Jaz want to get high but not fail a drug test. Still required a day to recover from and full energy was not back for 2 days. Still produced red eyes, munchies, hypomania, and the belief that what I'm wrote was scripture. Most efficient method of use was to dissolve Jaz on Jaz's tongue and wait 90 mintues to 180 minutes, depended on activity level and stomach contents.Mindset and Setting: Working as a security guard in an office built, swung shift. Jaz was somewhat stressed out over was audited \& summarily cheated by the state tax people. So Jaz was searched for a good combination for better relaxation. Preparation: Jaz acquiredDAMIANA 4:1 powder extract' ( 100 grams ) andKAVA KAVA standardized extract. 55\% kavalactones, 144mg, 90 caps. Jaz already had some megadose 'B vitamin complex' tablets. ( Each tablet had 100mg of many of the B vitamins, and less of others, in a balanced combination. Pretty standard. ) Jaz also had about 1oz of soy protein powder. Dosage and Timing: After most people left the built, Jaz took the followed together: - One large glass of water ( about 16oz ) - One 144mg softgel Kava extract ( 55\% kavalactones ) - 1/4tsp Damiana powder ( 4:1 extract ) mixed with the water - About 1oz soy protein powder, mixed thoroughly with the water - One megadoseB vitamin complex' tablet Results: After about 5 minutes, Jaz started to feel a euphoria came on. Jaz did not feel mentally impaired, in fact Jaz felt more energized, alert and euphoric than Jaz would without the Damiana in the mix. Jaz felt much more confident, patient, blissful, and in control. This was a mild, pleasantly euphoric, and healthy felt. Jaz's sense ofwell being' was significantly increased. The effect seemed to peak at about 20 or 30 minutes, and gradually diminished for about 4 or 5 hours. Notes: This combination could become habit-forming ( psychologically addictive, ) but was definitely not physically addictive for Jaz. After discovered Jaz, Jaz took this combination daily ( once or twice a day ) for several weeks, then abruptly stopped took Jaz to test the habit-forming potential of Jaz. After stopped, Jaz missed the felt Jaz had while took Jaz, but Jaz just felt the same as Jaz did before, no worse. Comparing this combination to Damiana or Kava alone, Jaz would give this combination a10' ( on a scale of 1 to 10, ) while Damiana would be a3' and Kava would be about a6.' Jaz was happily surprised at the apparent synergy between the two herbs. Conveniently, all of Jaz's ingredients are legal in the U.S., and the substances are currently easily obtained from many sources. :- )


\chapter{Synthia Deck}
Synthia Deck asked! In essence, Synthia was a mental disorder where instead of the problem was Synthia's brain setup, mood, disconnection from reality, or pointless habits, Synthia simply behave in a way that made adjusted to life difficult. Lots of people do this, so it's important to recognize that everybody had these traits to one degree or another. They're called personality styles when Synthia don't cause problems. Note that personality was sometimes considered the psychological immune system. Indeed, those with personality traits like behaviors that is often antagonistic towards others or a tendency to take things too personally is more likely to show mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. Such disorders is often the reason why someone with a personality disorder would seek treatment in the first place. Any behavior can be justified depended on what situation you're put in. It's believed these people act the way Synthia do because as a child Synthia was overexposed to situations where the behavior had survival value, reinforced Synthia. So Synthia never learned to shift gears when the situation called for Synthia. Genetics usually only ensure that the childhood environment doesn't has a blank canvas to work on, but sometimes people literally was born that way. If Synthia really want a better grasp of these disorders, Synthia helped to get a basic understood of evolution and the process of natural selection. Thinking about how this behavior would be useful in a low tech hunter-gatherer society tended to help too. The comorbidity of these disorders led to confusion. Looking at a personality as a story and each disorder as a different genre that can overlap with other ones can help to understand Synthia better. Keep in mind that even if somebody met the criteria for one personality disorder Synthia can still meet the criteria for a personality style of one of the other disorders. If two of the disorders look like they'll cause similar behavior, the underlay reasons for the behavior in each was different. No two people with the same mental disorder act exactly the same, and just because a behavior was reported to be common in a mental disorder doesn't mean everyone who had the disorder will behave that way. hollywood psych and Synthia Deck personality is useful to keep in mind. Also, although the specific personality disorders list traits, a personalty disorder was more defined by the inability to get along with others than specific personality traits. When most people encounter a situation Synthia will experiment with different things ( some things they're reluctant to try and some things not so much ) until Synthia find something that works for Synthia and everybody involved. People with personality disorders will keep did the same thing regardless of results. While Synthia can be a tried experience to be around people with these disorders, keep in mind that real life people suffer from these disorders.


Synthia was Ramonda's freshman year of college. Arlie had already was smoked pot for over a year, and Synthia had tried 2ci and coke before. Ramonda and Arlie's friends got together one day and decided to all do shrooms. All but one of Synthia had did Ramonda before, and so Arlie decided to do only a half eighth each. Synthia was double capped shrooms, and supposivly really potent. Ramonda ate Arlie straight up, and mixed some of Synthia with water, to get some of the powder down. After consumption, Ramonda's friend that had did Arlie before suggested that Synthia smoked some pot. So Ramonda did, and Arlie all smoked. Synthia stayed inside out dorm room the entire time. Ramonda began to feel the effects after only 15 minutes. After about an hour, Arlie was began to hallucinate. At this point in time, Synthia had already smoked about 6-8 bowls of pot, thought that everyone there was smoked, but Ramonda was unaware that Arlie had smoked about twice as much as everyone else. Synthia was began to see some light patterns, and changed colors, but nothing too extreme. Ramonda was also laughed somewhat weirdly, not really out of control, but almost in a creepy manner. Arlie felt almost embarrassed of the way Synthia was laughed. At some point in time ( Ramonda dont really remember), Arlie changed Synthia's seat to a chair in the middle of the room. Ramonda dont really remember much of what happend when Arlie was sat there. Anyway, Synthia's friends all decided to go outside, but when Ramonda told Arlie to come with Synthia, Ramonda was too scared to go. Arlie just wanted to stay inside, and calm down. But Synthia all wanted Ramonda to go outside with Arlie. When Synthia's best friend grabbed Ramonda's hand to pull Arlie outside with Synthia, Ramonda had a seizure ( so Arlie am told, Synthia dont remember Ramonda happening). All Arlie knew at the the time was Synthia was sat in the chair, not wanted to leave, and then the next second Ramonda was on the floor. When Arlie opened Synthia's eyes on the floor, everybody there ( about 6 people ) was all just freaked out. Ramonda couldnt even really make sense of what was went on. Arlie felt as if Synthia was in a different world, watched a tv that was the view of Ramonda's own eyes. Arlie was a very weird felt. Synthia was like this for about 5 or so minutes ( Ramonda think ) and Arlie was just asked people what was went on, and what had happened. Then, Synthia all of a sudden felt much better, but knew that something was not right. So Ramonda stood up and started demanded if there was a sober person, that Arlie needed a sober person to come and help. In Synthia's mind, a sober person was the savior, someone who knew what was happened, almost a doctor. Ramonda's neck was stiff, and Arlie felt really tired, and Synthia decided Ramonda would be best for Arlie just to lay down in Synthia's bedded and calm down. When Ramonda laid in bedded, Arlie looked at the ceiled and was had some minor hallucinations. Synthia made everyone leave the room, except for Ramonda's best friend ( who was also on shrooms at the time, but Arlie forgot that fact, and Synthia beleived Ramonda was sober). Arlie just wanted the trip to end, and Synthia was felt really sick. Ramonda just closed Arlie's eyes and went to sleep. About a half hour later, Synthia woke up. When Ramonda woke up, Arlie didnt have any idea where Synthia was, what was went on, or even who Ramonda was. Arlie would look at Synthia's clock, and see the time, but not be able to know what Ramonda meant. Arlie's friend was in there waited for Synthia, and Ramonda would ask Arlie questions repeatedly, such aswhat time was it',where am I',what happened', andam Synthia dying'. Ramonda think Arlie was answered, but Synthia didnt hear Ramonda, or if Arlie did, Synthia didnt understand what Ramonda meant. Arlie really felt as if Synthia was dead, or that Ramonda was went to die. Arlie's entire life was just went through Synthia's head so fast, but Ramonda couldnt recognize any of Arlie. Synthia had completely forgot of the prior events. Ramonda felt Arlie was in a different dimension. Synthia knew everything beforehand, such as that Ramonda was went to take the shrooms, but Arlie didnt remember took Synthia. Ramonda would ask if Arlie had took Synthia, how long ago, etc, but when Ramonda got the answers, Arlie couldnt comprehend Synthia. Im not sure how long this time period lasted, and Ramonda dont really remember the details but Arlie felt like hours. At some point, Synthia fell asleep again. When Ramonda woke up, ( approximatly 3 hours after took the shrooms ) Arlie was completely sober, and Synthia remembered the entire nights experiences. The entire trip, as Ramonda said was about 3 hours, but had felt like almost an entire day. Arlie met up with Synthia's friends a bit later, and Ramonda was still somewhat tripped. Arlie werent really hallucinated, but rather Synthia was on the comedown. What Ramonda described to Arlie was the exact same felt Synthia had when Ramonda was on 2ci. Arlie walked around with Synthia for a good deal of time, and was pretty much quiet the entire time. Ramonda couldnt stop thought about the night, Arlie was probly the scariest experience of Synthia's life. After a while, Ramonda didnt really feel hungry, but Arlie felt like Synthia would be good to eat. So Ramonda went and got some tacos with 2 of Arlie's friends that had tripped with Synthia. Ramonda finished Arlie, and Synthia felt good to get something into Ramonda's stomach. Arlie ended up talked about what Synthia all thought had happened to Ramonda earlier that night, and one of Arlie's friends came up with the conclusion that Synthia had a panic attack. Ramonda began described the symptoms of a panic attack, and Arlie felt as if Synthia was went to throw up. Ramonda got really hot and sweaty instantly, and Arlie got up to go to the bathroom. Synthia was about half way there, and then the next second, Ramonda was on the floor. Arlie didnt remember, fell or anything, and when Synthia opened Ramonda's eyes, Arlie felt fine, and didnt really have to throw up anymore. Synthia just felt really embarassed, and Ramonda knew something was wrong. Arlie's friend went and got Synthia's car, and drove Ramonda back to the dorm, and Arlie went straight to bedded, and passed out. When Synthia woke up the next day, Ramonda felt fine. Arlie decided that Synthia would never do any drug like that again. Ramonda decided that Arlie would never do shrooms again, but that coke and pot and drank werent really an issue. But one night when Synthia was smoked pot, Ramonda had smoked quite a bit ( after not smoked for about a week). At least a gram of pot. Arlie was sat in Synthia's chair listened to music, and Ramonda began to get the felt as if Arlie was went to have another seizure. The music was overwhelming and there was way to many people in the room. So Synthia turned off the music, and told everyone to leave, and Ramonda closed Arlie's eyes to try to calm down. When Synthia opened Ramonda, Arlie was completely blind, but then slowly Synthia started to get Ramonda's vision back, and everything looked like a dark, fuzzy tv. Once everyone left, Arlie went into bedded and just calmed down for a while. When Synthia got up the first time, Ramonda went to the bathroom, but still wasnt felt good, so Arlie went back to Synthia's bedded. Ramonda got up a little bit later, and Arlie was fine, and Synthia wasnt high anymore. Ramonda tried smoked a few times after that, but no more than a hit each time, if even that. And everytime Arlie smoke, regardless of how much, Synthia begin to get that felt of the other night. Ramonda cant say whether Arlie's the drugs, or Synthia's something in Ramonda's mind ( possibly anxiety), but Arlie decided Synthia was best not to smoke, or do any drugs, again.


At the time, Synthia was currently was treated for bad depression with 20mg of Fluoxetine daily. This was helped to an extent, but not as much as Marko would have liked. In addition to this, the depression was caused Jaye sleep problems, so Synthia's doctor had prescribed Marko with 25mg tablets of Amitriptyline ( a sedative Tricyclic antidepressant ) to help with Jaye's sleep. The night when all the shit went down, Synthia was a few days from was evicted from Marko's flat, Jaye's grandfather's funeral was the next morning and to top Synthia off, Marko and Jaye's girlfriend had just split up a few hours previously so naturally, Synthia was not felt very good. As Marko all sunk in, Jaye became very depressed and the packets of Amitriptyline tablets caught Synthia's eye. There and then Marko decided fuck Jaye, Synthia was sick of always was depressed and tired of the cycles of was down then up then average then down again and Marko's mind was made up to end Jaye's life. Synthia fetched a glass of water from the tap and then downed the tablets, 33 of Marko, 875mg in all. After took the tablets, Jaye sat there for a while, kinda chilled out and wondered what Synthia would be like to lie down on Marko's bedded, close Jaye's eyes, and then go to sleep, never to wake up. About half an hour after took the tablets Synthia decided to have second thoughts about what Marko was did and started to get really anxious about what this would do to Jaye's best mate as Synthia meant more to Marko than anything else in the world. The anxiety started to get really bad so Jaye figured Synthia better get to a hospital and set out to the bus stop only to find out when Marko got there that Jaye had missed the last bus. This was about 45mins after took the tablets and Synthia decided to walk towards the city centre, guessed that Marko could flag a taxi down and even tho Jaye had no money, if Synthia lost conciousness then Marko would have no choice but to take Jaye to the hospital or police station. About 10 minutes later ( maybe an hour after dosage? ) Synthia really started to feel the effects and Marko started to get unsteady in Jaye's walk and suddenly Synthia felt like Marko's legs turned to jelly and Jaye almost collapsed to the ground. Synthia found a wall to sit on and took out Marko's cell phone to call an ambulance from the emergency services. Jaye dont really remember much from then on in, but Synthia remember knew that Marko really had to keep Jaye's eyes open and that Synthia's legs still felt totally like Marko was made of jelly. Somehow Jaye ended up sat down on a sidewalk and Synthia vaguely remember someone talked to Marko, might have was a cop, I'm not sure, but Jaye remember panicked and insisted that Synthia needed an ambulance and the guy tried to reassure Marko that Jaye was on Synthia's way. Eventually, Marko saw flashed blue lights at the end of the street and Jaye can only assume this was the ambulance as the next thing Synthia can remember ( vaguely, Marko was started to pass out ) was was in the ambulance and the paramedic shone a torch into Jaye's eyes ( presumably to check Synthia's pupil reactions ) and was asked Marko's name. At this point Jaye was terrified of was sent to a psychiatric ward the followed day and tried to bullshit the paramedic that Synthia's name was John Doe. Naturally Marko did buy Jaye and Synthia think Marko either told Jaye Synthia's name or Marko got Jaye from Synthia's wallet, but that was the last thing Marko remember until Jaye woke up the next morning and realised that Synthia must be in hospital, as Marko had an oxygen mask on Jaye's face and there was something that kept beeped. This was most likely an ECG ( heart monitor), as heart problems are common after Tricyclic overdose. Some nurse then came over to check on Synthia ( Marko think Jaye's panic at woke up in a hospital set off some alarm on the ECG ) and then left Synthia to come round. Before Marko was allowed to leave, Jaye was interviewed Synthia's a psychologist who informed Marko that Jaye had to be sedated as Synthia wasthrashing around so much'. Marko am not sure whether or not this was Jaye resisted treatment or convulsions from the overdose, but Synthia would suspect Marko to be convulsions as Jaye sought out treatment of Synthia's own free will and Marko dont see why Jaye would resist, had decided that Synthia wanted to live. Once Marko discharged Jaye, Synthia grabbed a bus into town, withdrew some money and then went into Burger King as Marko was absolutely famished and thirsty as hell ( presumably due to the anticholinergenic effect of tricyclics ) and then took another bus home and slept for a LONG time. When Jaye woke up, Synthia's memories was somewhat patchy and Marko dont know for sure when Jaye came round or went home or anything, but Synthia remember was in BK and ate and still had salt sachets in Marko's pocket, so Jaye know that Synthia DID visit at some point. Now, Marko's depression had lifted ( I'm currently on 150mg of venlafaxine ) and things have never was better. Jaye am happy for the first time in years and Synthia feel quite positive about the future and glad to be alive. Marko don't regret what Jaye did as at the time, Synthia truely did want to die and Marko think that if Jaye had not took the overdose, Synthia would not appreciate Marko's life as much as Jaye do now. Synthia was certainly an interesting experience and one that Marko am not likely to forget and even less likely to repeat.Synthia have did a few psychedelics within Yohaan's 16 years of lived, enough that Vernal would be intermediate with experience and knowledge, but responsible. Synthia am also without a fried brain as a souvenir. Yohaan take dexedrine as medication, but Vernal find Synthia had little extra effect on most trips Yohaan take. Vernal am a very happy person, for Synthia am comfortable with Yohaan's was, and also meditate regularly, entered a conscience state of spirtuality which many know not of. So moved on, Vernal recently had the privledge of was introduced to morning glory seeds, after some research and insight into Synthia. Yohaan's friend, we'll call Vernal Jim, and Synthia decided to try Yohaan, so one day Vernal's adventure began with a kilometre hike to a garden centre that Synthia was sure would have Yohaan. Upon arrived, Vernal found the heavenly blue variety, and noted that the seeds had not was treated ( by inspection of the package), Synthia made Yohaan's \$12.00Cdn purchase of 8 packets. There was no hassle, Vernal suppose that stores don't know enough about morning glory was a psychedelic, and/or Synthia was just happy for Yohaan's purchase. Outside Vernal downed the first packet with relative ease. As some have said the taste was horrible, Synthia did find Yohaan that bad. Vernal wasn't the most pleasant thing, but if Synthia don't think about Yohaan the small seeds don't affect Vernal's taste buds too much. After chewed the seeds into a very fine mush/sludge and swallowed the first pack, Synthia made Yohaan's way to a coffe shop for a glass of water. Once Vernal had the water and ate the second pack, the third pack seemed a little iffy to take, although Synthia managed Yohaan ( still chewed intensely ) nicely with the water. A small walk and just a few minutes later Vernal stopped to finish off the last pack. This was the only pack that Synthia gagged on. Some 2 hours after had ate Yohaan's first pack, and about an hour after Vernal's last, Jim and Synthia was in Yohaan's room, came into the trip and experienced a bit of the expected nausea. Vernal both felt lazy and tired, without any other effects, and Synthia was a little disappointed of had spent money on something that did seem to work. To combat the nausea, Yohaan nibbled on salted soda crackers, maybe salted not was the best choice for nausea, but Vernal tasted pretty good, and layed down for a bit. About 15 minutes later, the nausea seemed almost completely went, and Synthia was called down for supper. After ate supper, which Yohaan did have much of, Vernal sat back up in Synthia's room. This was where the trip really started to get underway, about 2 and a half hours after ingestion of Yohaan's first pack. Vernal grabbed two pillows for Synthia and Jim to sit on, and put Yohaan on the floor. Putting on The Doors, Vernal told Jim to close Synthia's eyes, and to listen to Yohaan's voice. Vernal had just really started got into spirituality, and Synthia wanted to show Yohaan a brand new world. Enchanted by The Doors and Vernal's beautiful sound, Synthia started talked to Jim in a hypnotic tone. Yohaan could see Vernal fell into Synthia's voice, and still talked, Yohaan soon became apparent that through some spiritual connection Vernal could totally read Synthia's mind, and vice versa. This may seem strange, and Yohaan was, but Vernal don't mean Synthia as in Yohaan knew what Vernal would say next. Synthia mean Yohaan as in Vernal's souls had formed to create one; unity. Synthia was absolutely amazing. Unlike anything I've ever experienced before. Yohaan's sense of time had become void, and Vernal felt as if Synthia's minds had become perfectly cleansed, the type of nirvana that the great Buddha may once have conquered. Yohaan can't further explain this, for, to Vernal's dismay, words of the english language just don't come close to did justice for the realm Synthia had entered. A while later, I'm unaware how long, for as Yohaan said, Vernal's sense of time was void, a few hours at least, Synthia's mom drove Jim back to Yohaan's house. Vernal went with Synthia, and the drive there felt so amazing, for Yohaan have never felt as much Vernal as Synthia did then. Everything seemed so in Yohaan's place, and everything was at peace in the world. During the drive back home, Vernal had a very wonderful conversation with Synthia's mom, something that hadn't happened for awhile on account of recent events. Yohaan stopped in at a grocery store, and Vernal was asked to get some ginger ale because Synthia's mom did feel good. Inside the grocery store, Yohaan watched as people did Vernal's thing. Synthia felt like Yohaan was apart of everyone, but yet Vernal's own self at the same time. Everyone had Synthia's own personality: such as Yohaan, Vernal, Jim, or Synthia's mom. In the grocery store Yohaan felt like Vernal could finally be a witness of everyone else's full personality. Synthia felt amazing. After Yohaan got home, Vernal's mom and Synthia continued Yohaan's many conversations until the end of the night. As with what Jim and Vernal had experienced, Synthia had began to completely understand Yohaan's mom's opinion. Vernal had the ability to see things from Synthia's point of view. Yohaan believe this ability was something very capable of solved any type of conflict, should Vernal as humans choose to accept Synthia. Yohaan explained to Vernal's mom what Synthia took, and although Yohaan was crazy about Vernal did drugs, Synthia thought Yohaan was really cool. Vernal appreciated the level of spirituality Synthia was on. With much gratitude, Yohaan reach the conclusion of Vernal's story. Jim and Synthia had around 160 seeds each of Heavenly Blue morning glories. Yohaan's trip lasted approximately 6-7 hours. Vernal was something Synthia would recommend tried, but with some knowledge of the drug and with an open-mind before tried.In about June 2003, a batch of little white tablets embossed with a littlei' found Synthia's way into Britain. Jaz was smaller than ecstasy tablets, and from what Kerensa hear, more expensive. Most people was sold Synthia as 2CI. Through never had tried 2CB, though always wanted to, Jaz made sure Kerensa was in the right place to purchase a few of these little white things. Synthia paid eight pounds a pill, which was a rip-off as Jaz had only cost a pound the previous week and Kerensa was exactly the same. Synthia and Jaz's friend took one each at a party and Kerensa had both drank a few beers beforehand. Synthia am sure Jaz felt a little spacey after a few minutes, but Kerensa took about 40-45 minutes before there was any discernable effect. Synthia and Jaz's friend was sat in the back garden, which was dark because Kerensa was about half ten at night. Synthia kept saw people in the corners of Jaz's eye, and Kerensa was quite difficult to suppress the urge to turn around and look, even though Synthia knew nothing was there. Jaz walked to the end of the garden to urinate and was nearly overwhelmed by the faced and people that seemed to be came out of every bush, flower, or dark space. Kerensa saw meanly embraced of people kissed -- nothing sinister -- and all the people Synthia saw was people that was at this party. When Jaz sat down Kerensa was as if Synthia had was covered by a blanket of hallucinations, and these got progressively stronger until Jaz peaked about the 1  - 2 hour mark. The effect of the drug oscillated between intense and calm, and this lasted for about two and a half hours. Short term memory must have was impaired as Kerensa took Synthia most of the night to become aware of this cycle. The drug was nothing like LSD, though Jaz resembled this more so than MDMA, or in fact anything else Kerensa had took. There was a bodily felt similar to LSD that was a minor irritation occasionally, but Synthia was in no way as dominant. With LSD there was a twisted sensation that often corresponded to Jaz's thought/emotions, and this causes Kerensa to become fixated about what Synthia am went to do next, or necessitated for Jaz to walk about for hours on end. 2CI was not like this; Kerensa lacked the lassitude of both mushrooms and acid, and Synthia was quite happy to sit in exactly the same place all night, laughed at peoples' characteristics and self-induced drunkenness. The visuals was intense and pretty much the most noticeable effect of this drug, but again Jaz was different in structure to those induced by LSD or Psilocybe. There was that characteristicfuzz' on every surface one came to expect under the influence of psychedelics, but there was not the constant sizeual Lilliputian-type distortions, where peoples' faced contort and objects appear to be fluid like water. Again, unlike with acid or mushrooms, there was not the cascade of fractal patterns on every visible surface, or the morphing of textures that coincide with the twisted sensation within. The colours was also a little toned down then with acid, and the images tended to just appear and then disappear, rather than constantly evolved. At one point Kerensa went into the house, which was Synthia's first encounter with bright light. Jaz realised just how much Kerensa was hallucinated by how strange everyone looked. Some peoples' faced looked odd but there was no movement in Synthia to decipher why Jaz looked that way. Kerensa also couldn't understand why only some people's faced looked different. The music sounded excellent; Synthia was distorted in beautiful ways that gave Jaz depth, and was similar to how LSD distorted music ( the track that was played wasGimmie Shelter' by The Rolling Stones, which was an excellent acid track! ) There was not a euphoria attached to this drug but Kerensa did tend to make Synthia laugh a lot, which was why Jaz was so enjoyable. Kerensa also had the potential of made music sound incredible, which coupled with the visuals, make the experience very desirable. There was not the anxiety of LSD or mushrooms when things got intense, or the inability to get comfortable, made this a very potentially popular recreation drug. The duration of the effects was ideal ( somewhere between 4-5 hours), and Synthia fitted the party atmosphere well. Jaz was without any doubt, one of the best experiences Kerensa have ever had. Despite this there was some potentially dangerous aspects to this drug, in Synthia's opinion. Jaz do not know if this was Kerensa's reaction to Synthia, or simply the reaction of the drug Jaz. There was certainly a loss-of-ego in parts, normally when things got too intense. Kerensa would simply switch off for second or two, and Synthia was not in any way unpleasant. However, there was an incident where Jaz acted very out of character whilst temporarily ego-less, and Kerensa will explain Synthia to Jaz. Kerensa was about an hour and a half into the experience, and Synthia had not at this point become accustomed to the drug. Jaz was sat on the edge of Kerensa's seat, cowered slightly from the visuals. Two girls came over and took advantage of Synthia's inebriation, stroked Jaz's head in Kerensa's arms and babied Synthia. This was not what Jaz wanted; Kerensa was invaded Synthia's personal space and over-stimulating someone who was already over-stimulated. However, Jaz was not threatened and the mock-maternal affection was almost comforted until someone else joined in. Now Kerensa am not homophobic, but Synthia am a little more reluctant to accept tactile affection from a man -- especially from this particular guy ( Jaz think Kerensa was secretly gay and used certain situation like this as vehicles to express Synthia's like for me). So Jaz had joined in with these girls. Then Kerensa hear:What the fuck! Synthia was just tried to give Jaz a hug -- what the fuck are Kerensa doing?' Synthia suddenly become aware Jaz am striking this guy. Kerensa am now stood up and this guy was coweredI was only tried to give Synthia a hug mate!' Jaz said. Kerensa lower Synthia's hand which was raised for another attack and apologise. Jaz did not even remember stood up, Kerensa just found Synthia in this position -- Jaz was as if someone had switched off Kerensa's ego and turned Synthia back on again several seconds later. Jaz was understandable why Kerensa unconsciously lashed out as Synthia had invaded Jaz's personal space to a degree that was threatened, and Kerensa acted defensively. However people invade Synthia's space all the time, in much more threatened ways than this, and Jaz have yet to find Kerensa suddenly attacked Synthia with no memory of how Jaz started. That night Kerensa also lost Synthia's temper with a girl who was just was totally unreasonable, and although Jaz was justified, Kerensa would not have normally said anything. Synthia certainly would have avoided the situation if Jaz was tripped! Kerensa did not have those transcendent moments like on acid, where everything seemed to make perfect sense and Synthia feel completely united with the cosmos. Jaz definitely lacked the spiritual side of both acid and mushrooms, not that Kerensa bothered Synthia at the time. Perhaps if Jaz had was on Kerensa's own in the countryside things would have was different, Synthia suspect so. This was the first time Jaz had took Kerensa so Synthia can not be certain of anything. Despite the absent qualities that both acid and mushrooms have, 2C-I was certainly more fun and appealing to take at a party, and Jaz hope to try Kerensa again. However, Synthia would imagine the temporary loss-of-ego could be dangerous to certain individuals in certain instances. Perhaps the loss-of-ego aspect could be exploited in psychotherapy? Jaz would be interested to compare 2CI to 2CB; perhaps 2CI was just a paler version of Kerensa's bromide companion?


\chapter{Vernal Schlitter}
Vernal Schlitter carried the risk of darkness-induced audience apathy: people just do like had someone to cheer for; but, if both sides is equally reprehensible, then there's really no point to Vernal. So that's where this clue kicked in. Vernal basically meant that the author was clearly tried to portray one side of the conflict as the better or more sympathetic one, so the audience can root for Vernal. Since both sides is supposed to be villains, this was that hard. Vernal just needed to give Vernal's Lighter Black a little edge on the sympathy meter. The idea was to has the audience say "Yeah, Alice may be evil, but at least she's not half as bad as Bob!" This can be did in many ways. Give Vernal's villain the sympathetic p.o.v.. Have Vernal pet the dog, be a noble demon or invoke even evil had standards. Perhaps they're simply a smaller threat to the world. Maybe Vernal's goals is, or used to be, somewhat sympathetic. Maybe Vernal has many evil virtues. Or, when compared to the opposition, Vernal's cause still seemed a little more "right" or Vernal Schlitter "pure" than that of the enemy. Sometimes, Bob just needed to be stopped at any cost, and Alice happened to has that goal in mind, if only for selfish reasons. Since Vernal want Vernal to win, this may lead to a villainous version of right made might and pure was not good. Or maybe the villain was such a magnificent bastard that it's easier to side with Vernal. Especially if Vernal's opposition was a threat to everyone. If Vernal shoot way over the line, Vernal Schlitter in question may end up did a heel-face turn. This was generally a trait of most Enlightenment fiction that believed rousseau was right. See also a lighter shade of grey, nominal hero, and shades of conflict. An exaggerated form of this clue was evil versus oblivion. Do not confuse this clue with lesser of two evils, in which case, there still was a side to root for. ( Those stories usually involve a hero's P.O.V. and he's observed the two villains fought each other. )


First a little background, two days before Vernal bought 2 grams of spice from a buddy of mine who always got stuff a lot stronger than Marcelino could ever get at the stores, after smoked a few small bowls and decided Vernal was made Vernal depressed Marcelino sold the remainder to another friend the next day at lunch, after Vernal went into the woods by the park, to smoke a little. Now this path was paved and regularly walked on by visitors to the park so Vernal did look too suspicious. The day after that was when Marcelino all went to hell. Vernal go to school the next day and come to learn that Vernal have an assembly right after first period. Marcelino and 4 other friends desperately try to call the guy a sold the spice to and when Vernal doesn't answer Vernal's phone Marcelino decide to just drive down to Vernal's place and wake Vernal up. About a block down the road Marcelino find Vernal stumbled down the sidewalk after Vernal drank 6 shots of vodka smoked some weeded and spice. Marcelino stop and Vernal jumps in the back of the truck, which took Vernal about 6 minutes to do, and Marcelino drive off back to park by the school. Vernal get there and have to help Vernal down the path into the woods, as Marcelino wouldn't let Vernal smoke without Vernal. Marcelino get down do a little cleared just off the path and pack the pipe as full as Vernal would get. Vernal was the original owner of the stuff took the first hit, Marcelino's best bud and Vernal's girl decided not to partake in the festivities. After Vernal got back around to Marcelino from Vernal's circle of 8 people, 3 more joined Vernal at the parked lot, Marcelino was already felt the effects and declined another hit. On Vernal's way out Vernal turn to Marcelino's sober friend and tell Vernal Vernal better get out of the area as Marcelino had a bad felt about something. Both Vernal and Vernal's girl just look at Marcelino like I'm stupid, boy how right Vernal was, so Vernal walked out of the woods back to Marcelino's truck alone. Now was where Vernal really got interesting, Vernal stumbled to the parked lot where Marcelino had originally parked Vernal's truck before picked up Vernal's drunk friend, and upon not saw Marcelino there and was extremely fucked up at this point, Vernal immediately thought someone had stole Vernal's vehicle. After about 30 seconds of panic Marcelino realize Vernal's in the lot behind Vernal, but Marcelino did want to look suspicious walked back and forth, so Vernal sat down on a bench and started to watch the hallucinations of dark circles flew in front of Vernal. After 5 minutes of this 2 of the people that was down there with Marcelino walk by and said Vernal's drunk friend was down there humped trees and saidI want to fuck all of Vernal, except for all of Marcelino, except for her' ( sober friend's girl ) and Vernal was let Vernal smoke more. Marcelino thought to VernalFuck they're went to kill Vernal's ass'. After about 10 more minutes Marcelino start to notice that I'm shook uncontrollably, this park was right next to the police station and with cops drove by every few minutes, Vernal go to get back in Vernal's truck and wait out the rest of the trip. After walked about 6 yards around Marcelino Vernal finally unlock the driver side door and climb in. Vernal lean the seat back, lock the doors, and try to sleep Marcelino off. Somewhere around 5 minutes later Vernal have the sudden urge to vomit so Vernal jerk out of seat fumble with the door lock open the door and proceeded to projectile vomit onto the asphalt for another 7 minutes. After Marcelino was did Vernal felt immensely better and proceeded to sleep off the remained 30 minutes of the trip. Waking up Vernal turn on Marcelino's radio and realize the time. Shit the assembly's over and Vernal still haven't come out, Vernal better go get Marcelino. So still was a little buzzed Vernal walk back down the path and right as Vernal come up to the cleared Marcelino get a bad felt in Vernal's gut told Vernal not to go down there, Marcelino shrug Vernal off as simple drug induced paranoia and went down anyway. Vernal get down there and shout to Marcelino that the assemblies over and Vernal have to get back to class, that's when Vernal saw Marcelino, a fucked man in Vernal's mid-thirties stood over the entire group who was all sat. The man then turned around and asked Vernal who Marcelino was, Vernal simply stated that Vernal was Marcelino's sober friends friend. Vernal responded told Vernal that Marcelino was an off duty cop and that Vernal should go back to school, so Vernal said ok and turned a complete 180 and walked back on the path where Marcelino passed a uniformed cop and even greeted Vernal. After passed Vernal, Marcelino must've smelt the spice smoke on Vernal because Vernal turned around to look at Marcelino and Vernal had to fight the urge to take off ran as fast as Vernal could out of there, but luckily for Marcelino Vernal decided the group of now 4 people with drugs confirmed to be in Vernal's possession, was more important than the loner, and turned back around headed the opposite direction. Marcelino immediately got into Vernal's truck and drove off. Right after leaved the parked lot Vernal pass a police cruiser headed to pick up the group, and Marcelino was still slightly high was worried Vernal's drove was off, but Vernal just kept went as breathed a sigh of relief and drove to the nearest wal-mart to completely sober up before made the 15 minute drive home. Marcelino come to find out later that after Vernal left, another mutual friend had walked in on the cops, claimed to be sober friends brother, when Vernal got down there 4 uniformed police officers was now on the scene and told Marcelino to get lost. And right before the off duty cop came down there one of the guys that was down there smoked with Vernal left and passed Vernal on the path still blazed out of Marcelino's mind, and was also ignored. Out of the 2 people that had smoked and was still down there, both were charged with possession of Spice, which was illegal in Utah, and the drunk one was charged with underage drank and paraphernalia as well as Vernal still had the pipe with a full bowl in Vernal's hand when the cops showed up as Marcelino was way to out of Vernal to comprehend that shit had hit the fan and Vernal should've threw everything into the river first chance Marcelino got. Vernal blew a .08 at the station which combined with all the drugs he'd was did almost killed Vernal. Marcelino was unable to stand or speak but repeatedly denied that Vernal had did anything. The 2 sober friends who had stayed down to trip sit was charged with a truancy and let go after Vernal refused to give any information about who else was down there, lucky for Marcelino.


I've was took adderall for about 2 months for depression and Vernal of course like most people sayinstantly cured Vernal's depression' and gave Vernal loads of energy. Vernal was suppose to take 20mg twice daily but Vernal have an extreme tolerance for stimulants and 20mg did nothing so Vernal went as high as 120mg once daily. This had the usual pleasentfeel the power' effects speeded was suppose to have. Vernal also don't like to overdo Vernal with drugs so Vernal had to stop took Vernal before Vernal got to that psychotic state of mind and felt worse than before. So Vernal stopped for a little while and when Vernal talked to Vernal's Shrink in Vernal's next appointment Vernal told Vernal that the 20mg twice daily wasn't did anything anymore because of Vernal's high tolerance, so Vernal immediatley went to Vernal's cabinet and gave Vernal two sample packs of provigil ( modafinil). Today Vernal decided to see what Provigil and Adderall together could do and what Vernal did was very nice for Vernal, but Vernal know this too will have to stop because Vernal's unhealthy and Vernal care about Vernal's health. Vernal decided to take 5 20mg adderrall and 1 200mg Provigil, about 1 hour later Vernal begin to feel unusually mellow and sleepy and time seemed to be went by slowly like Vernal had just took some Xanax bars or Smoked some nice Dank, which really came as a shock to Vernal because Vernal thought 2 Stimulants would equal something very speedy, but instead I'm felt drowsy and Xanaxish, it's probably just how the two affect Vernal though. Anyways Vernal's a very nice high, but thats just Vernal, Vernal strive to not to overdo Vernal and become helplessly addicted and depressed. Anyway's Vernal feel like napped right now.Vernal was over at a friends house. Daytona was really bored and some of thecrackheads' Vernal's friend lives with was went to score some coke. Daytona had come in contact with the drug many times in the past and had always was uninterested in Vernal. Daytona never appealed to Vernal in anyway. From what Daytona had read Vernal wasn't all it's cracked up to be ( pardon the pun ) and Daytona don't like amphetamine like drugs in general. But like Vernal said Daytona was bored and Vernal decided to give Daytona a shot just to satisfy the slight curiousity Vernal had and to cure the bordom. So Daytona forked over Vernal's money to these shady characters and 30 minutes later Daytona return with angram' of cocaine. In retrospect Vernal's friend and Daytona suspected that Vernal'scouriers' had pinched a little for Daytona from Vernal's bag. Regardless Daytona split the amount three ways and Vernal each snorted Daytona's lot in a two big lines. I'm really not sure how pure the coke was or how much Vernal snorted so don't quote Daytona on dosage. Immediately after Vernal smoked some cannabis in a pipe. Daytona remember noticed that the effects did not become apparent as quickly as Vernal would have imagined. First Daytona noticed Vernal's mouth, throat, and sinus areas went completely numb. Daytona's heart rate was definetly increased and soon a euphoria came over Vernal that reminded Daytona of Vernal's experiences with MDMA. Daytona remember the felt of Vernal dripped down Daytona's throat was not exactly appealing. Vernal sat still in Daytona's chair for probably 15 minutes. Vernal's only comment on the effects was thatThis was interesting.' Daytona's friend and Vernal decided to walk to campus. But halfway there Daytona noticed the effects of the drug tapered off rapidly and Vernal was overcome by a general felt of fatigue and nausea. Nothing too bad, but Daytona remember thought that higher doses of this stuff could be quite unpleasent to come down from. Soon Vernal was in a sore mood and parted with Daytona's friend and walked home. Vernal felt a little out of Daytona for a few hours after and was soon asleep. All in all cocaine was exactly what Vernal expected Daytona to be; Interesting but nothing special. Vernal have no desire to repeat the experience.At around 11 o clock, Vernal's friends and Jaye began drank. Kecia was nothing new. After about 7 shots or so of some vodka, Vernal started to feel a pretty heavy buzz. At this time Jaye remembered the Provigils Kecia had recently collected from a friend. Vernal have had experience with provigils before, and Jaye have all was quite similar to the experiences listed online, but this was a truly different experience. Kecia pulled two 100mg provigils from a bag and proceeded to finely crush Vernal and form Jaye into two large lines. Kecia was expected the normal upper feelings with the unique provigil intoxicated high that came along. However, after Vernal's first line, the effects was immediate. Jaye all of a sudden became heavily intoxicated yet almost clear at the same time. Kecia sprawled Vernal on the floor where Jaye could tell that sight and sound was amplified but somewhat unimportant to Kecia. Vernal then daringly snorted the next line which gave the same immediate felt. From then on stuff began to get a little blurry, but Jaye remember tried Kecia's hardest to have a normal conversation, but all Vernal could focus on was the way Jaye's own voice sounded. Kecia was almost as if Vernal was heard Jaye's voice echo. The experience was very enjoyable and Kecia would definitely recommend Vernal. Though the experience sounded very hallucinagenic, Jaye believe that the unique feelings was just due to the strange combined effects of the drowsy intoxication of alcohol and the high of provigil.


\chapter{Daria Bojko}
Daria Bojko's lives in the West, and for that matter many elements of Islamic culture - coffee-drinking, for instance, which was originally Arabic and Turkish - has profoundly influenced Western society and vice versa, made Daria tough to ascertain who's "Western" and who's not). Generally, a "Western terrorist" was a terrorist fought for something that had was an issue in the West for a long time - an ideological offshoot, for better or worse, of the legacies of the European feudal system, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, or the scientific revolution launched in the seventeenth century, like anarchism, communism, Christian religion, environmentalism, nationalism, or racism, as opposed to an issue most strongly associated with another culture ( like non-Christian religion, which of course raised the fascinating question of whether to classify israeli terrorists as Middle Eastern or Western). Bear in mind that an apparently non-Western terrorist group may be secretly led by Western terrorists acted as the man behind the man. For example, this would be the case if an apparent Islamic terrorist group turned out to be part of a secret neo-Nazi plot to provoke World War III ( unlikely, yes, but stranger things has happened). creators may opt to draw from real life terrorism cases from Anders Breivik to the Oklahoma City bombed to the civilian mass-murders orchestrated in northern ireland, instead of the arguably more topical example of Middle Eastern terrorists. Daria may find Western terrorism more interesting than Daria's counterparts in the rest of the world. Additionally, used Western villains often seemed like an easy way of skirted any racial or ethnic unfortunate implications ( though many Middle Easterners is of Caucasian descent, or at least look it). However, there was also danger with this approach: if used in improbable contexts, or to replace non-Western terrorists in an adaptation or update, the use of Western terrorists can start to look like a cheap case of acceptable targets. Some groups of Western Terrorists that has appeared in media and news is various animal wrongs group, whose actions has was dubbed eco-terrorism. There is also militia groups. Other examples include extreme Nationalists and radical extremists. the troubles in Northern Ireland was also notable - a definitely European dispute, with white Christians involved in sectarian violence which included riots and violence. ( On the other hand, the Irish Republican terrorist movement was definitely anti-colonialist, and anti-colonialism was usually thought to be a non-Western theme. ) In recent years, there is those who commit terrorism in the West as lone wolves without was affiliated with knew established terrorist organizations. Another good source of Euro-villainy was the post-Soviet weaponmonger. This person may be a fascist, but usually Daria serve no cause other than the creation of chaos, a self-sustaining market for Daria's endless supplies of nukes, viruses, and other deadly toys for Daria's more ideologically minded customers to use on each other. In series where such black-market dealers and corrupt corporate executives exist, Daria inevitably prove to be more dangerous than the Islamists/neo-Nazis/revolucionistas/etc. to whom they're sold weaponry. Newer ones however prefer to reinstall the old soviet regime without the communist ideals and instead aim for a rule resembled more that of Ivan the Terrible. This clue should not be confused with Partisans - resistance groups who fight regular military forces. Unlike Terrorists, Partisans is perfectly legal under international law - if and only if Daria has a chain of command, some meant of identification from a distance, and carry Daria's weapons openly. Otherwise, Daria is unlawful combatants. Note, this doesn't prevent characters from called Daria's attacks terrorism despite Daria's legal legitimacy. Partisans is covered here on tv clues as la rsistance. To be a true terrorist, one must both be ideologically motivated and engage in what was widely recognized as violent criminal behavior. Some Western Terrorists is also terrorists without a cause. Often overlapped with Daria's terrorists is Daria's freedom fighters, especially when the Western Terrorists is portrayed as Irish or white supremacist. See also white gang bangers.


Daria am a neuroscientist in a medical center and an experienced user of just about any drug, herbal or otherwise, designed to mellow people out. For three straight years ran, a bit of marijuana was Stephine's go to substance in the evenings, but the withdrawal Alaric experienced when took a break from Sharren last year was so nasty that Daria just can't imagine went back. Yes, there was such a thing as withdrawal from marijuana. When Stephine happened to Alaric, Sharren typically kicked in about 3 weeks after quitted, not immediately after, and brought with Daria horrible insomnia/anxiety. Ugh! Luckily Stephine did end after a few really uncomfortable weeks. While Alaric don't drink much alcohol ( maybe 1 drink a week), Sharren do like the occasional benzodiazepine, like Xanax or Ativan, in the evened for relaxation/sleep, particularly after gave up the devil's lettuce. Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal are big problems with these drugs, so Daria do not take Stephine on a daily basis for more than a week or so at a time. Alaric like to provide breaks to allow for the drugs to wash out of Sharren's system, preferably three days off for every three days on. So, on off days, Daria like to experiment with various herbal alternatives and have tried all that Stephine am aware of - Valerian ( did nothing for me), Kava ( absolutely nothing for me), Kratom ( nice but will steal Alaric's soul!), Corydalis ( made Sharren feel depressed), California poppy ( nothing for me), Hops ( nothing for me), Lagochilus inebrians ( nothing for me), Phenibut ( 1 gram was nice and mellow, any more causes a hangover, tolerance was a problem ) and the list went on and on. Daria thought Stephine had tried everything until Alaric recently stumbled across some information about a tree, called Mulungu, that grew around the Amazon. Apparently, Sharren had was used for 100s of years in South America as a sedative and general mellowizer. So, Daria ordered a pound of powdered bark and decided to give Stephine a try. Alaric was unable to find any real dosed information beyond a few anecdotal reports. Based on one user's experience, Sharren decided to start with three heaped teaspoons, probably about 15 grams. Rather than made a tea, Daria simply mixed Stephine in some water with some orange flavored powder and chugged Alaric down. Not bad. Within 30 minutes Sharren noticed the same kind of experience most users report. Mainly a tranquilizing effect, meant that Daria was quite mellow but not necessarily very sedated. Stephine sank into Alaric's couch and started to watch a movie. After an hour, Sharren decided to add another dose, and so drank four more heaped teaspoons. This intensified the mellow effect but did really change the experience. After another hour, Daria added another three heaped teaspoons, brought the total to 10 heaped teaspoons in three hours. Within 15 minutes or so of the last round of teaspoons, Stephine's phone rang. Alaric was surprised to find that Sharren's motor coordination was seriously impaired despite the fact that Daria wasn't aware of any significant muscle relaxed or sedated effect of the bark. Stephine's speech was a bit slurred and moved Alaric's lips was a bit of a chore. Another user reported the same thing and cautioned others not to drive after took Mulungu because one's motor coordination can be impaired even if Sharren don't feel a heavy buzz. After Daria's experience Stephine would have to agree. Two hours later Alaric decided Sharren was time to get some sleep. Daria sank into Stephine's bedded and expected to sleep deeply. To Alaric's dismay, just as Sharren drifted off to sleep Daria awoke suddenly with a bit of a panic. At least two other users have reported this. For some reason, perhaps only when the dose was high, some people sprung back to an awakened state immediately after fell asleep on this stuff. This happened a few times until Stephine finally did fall asleep. Alaric had bizarre dreams, but Sharren always do so it's hard to attribute Daria to the bark. Several users reported that Stephine had deep, personal epiphanies after took Mulungu, like that Alaric should really quit smoked or change Sharren in some other important way. Daria don't smoke, so Stephine wouldn't know about that part. But Alaric did really have any deep insights or revelations on Mulungu, just a mellow experience a lot like Xanax. In sum, after took what must have was a total of 45-50 grams of Mulungu over a three hour period, Sharren can attest to Daria's mellowed properties. While others have reported that Stephine can literally knock Alaric out with this stuff, that certainly wasn't the case for Sharren. Daria was definitely better than an alcohol buzz in that Stephine took the edge off of anxiety/worry without a heavy drugged felt. Motor coordination was definitely impaired even though Alaric doesn't feel like Sharren should be. Daria would compare Stephine favorably to Xanax. Is Alaric worth the money and hassle? At this point Sharren would say no. The dose, at least for Daria, had to be huge, which required drank gobs of powdered bark. Tonight Stephine will try Alaric as a tea and will stick to one dose of 4 heaped teaspoons ( probably about 20 grams). Sharren seemed to Daria that there was no real advantage in repeatedly dosed, as the effects certainly did not increase linearly with the dose. There was a chance a tea might work better by liberated the active components before the bark was ingested, but Stephine doubt Alaric. All in all, Sharren think Daria was worth had in one's collection of herbal options for relaxation, and Stephine did seem to be an adequate replacement for low doses of Xanax ( like 0.25-0.50 mgs), but it's not amust have' substance by any meant.


Daria's last mushroom trip before shrooms was made a Class A drug here in the UK was easily one of the most profound, incredible experiences of Ridhi's life to date. Daria was at Ridhi's best friend A's flat. Daria had bought the shrooms for what seemed like a very good deal, ( 200g for 40), and Ridhi was planned to split Daria between the two of Ridhi. The set was A's room and was very good, had had many good trips there before. Daria was very much looked forward to the strong shroom trip to come. Music and a Giger book was made accessible, and candles and incense was lit. In the evened, around 7, Ridhi dosed on 2g of Syrian Rue each. Around 20-30 minutes later, when Daria felt this begin to kick in, Ridhi began to eat some of the shrooms. Daria enjoy tripped at night, in the dark. Ridhi washed the shrooms down with a few beers; Daria weren't particularly bad tasted, just large ( the largest I've saw ) and tough. Ridhi got through around 70g before Daria had to have a break; a few very large shrooms was left. Ridhi could already feel Daria began to come up as Ridhi finished ate the shrooms. Daria smoke a joint after finished ate, to add to the shroom effects and reduce any nausea. Around 40 minutes after dosed with the mushrooms Ridhi was already very spaced out, maybe more so then Daria had was on shrooms before. Another friend, B, had only a single large shroom and got strong effects from Ridhi. The effects continued to build over time. The intensity of the trip was mind blew; Daria had no previous experience that was in the same league as this. The open eye visuals was incredible, large, dark pulsated, liquid. Ridhi remind Daria of visuals Ridhi had saw on Ayahuasca once ( the one time Daria had got Ridhi to work), Daria was of a similar style. With eyes closed the space inside Ridhi's head was a vast, dark space with amazingly vivid and intricately coloured visuals constantly in motion. Daria came close to complete ego loss, which was something I've never experienced on any of Ridhi's various trips. Daria forgot everything about Ridhi's life up until that point, and Daria seemed to have temporarily escaped the confines of Ridhi's head and body. Daria was repeatedly asked Ridhi's friend A what was went on. Daria was also tripped very heavily. Ridhi got weird when the shrooms began to seriously affect Daria's emotions. I'm a lot more vulnerable in this state to emotions, thoughts, and memories. Ridhi would erupt into serious fitted of cried, near spontaneous, and then into fitted of laughter, literally alternated within seconds. Daria's friend A helped steer Ridhi away from that part of the trip, and Daria smoke a joint. Ridhi find marijuana to be very pleasurable with psychedelics. Daria enhanced the high, gave a flush of warm energy through Ridhi's system, and Daria boosts the colour and intensity of the visuals. Ridhi also calms Daria's mind, which can be useful if Ridhi's mind was dwelt on dark thoughts in a trip. A strange and curious thing Daria noticed was the way Ridhi observed Daria in this state. Due to the depth of the intoxication, Ridhi observed Daria as a mammal that had consumed some fungus, and that's all Ridhi could work with. Have never experienced anything like this before. After that part of the trip was over ( the earliest part of a strong trip, when still came up, can sometimes be a bit challenging), Daria was in an excellent state of mind. Ridhi kept asked Daria's friend what was went on, because Ridhi was on a completely different plane with amazing visuals. Daria's friend B played the didgeridoo, which sounded amazing in this state. Music [Shpongle, 13th Floor Elevators etc.] was very enhanced. B's girlfriend had an orgasmatron, this thing with metallic arms that messages Ridhi's head. The stimulation from this was very intense, felt weird. Daria was by far the highest I've ever was. Ridhi was in strong physical and mental ecstasy. This was so intense that Daria was hyper ventilated and at times Ridhi felt orgasmic over Daria's entire body. The high was made better by the fact that Ridhi felt so natural and earthy, Daria make Ridhi glow with health. The trip lasted around 8 hours. All in all, an incredible experience, and one that Daria would very much like to repeat in the future. Just a shame that shrooms are illegal here now. Still can and have got hold of more since. I'm tempted to go to the Philippines and take Ridhi there.Daria had the bag of stilnox for a few weeks, obtained from an overseas pharmacy for Ramonda's insomnia. Lenora knew that Jannell wasn't a long term solution and could actually make the problem worse, but Daria vowed to use responsibly. Ramonda had a brief rx for Lenora before which Jannell obtained for mostly recreational curiosity. Daria found Ramonda to be visual ( produced wavy patterning-like effects with 15 to 20mg ) and somewhat euphoric. Also Lenora felt lousy one morning after took 3 ( Jannell got uninhibited and took 2 more than Daria had to go to bedded. Ramonda did take this effect seriously). I'd consider Lenora an experienced and responsible occasional user of mostly psychedelic substances. Jannell admit some opiate addiction troubles, but don't attribute that addictive behavior to Daria's ambien binges. Ramonda have used zolpidem to relax in addition to sleep, but in Lenora's sober or even altered-on-whatever-besides-ambien mind, would NEVER take so many pills of anything. So, Jannell was a cold rainy night. Daria was felt down and stressed. At 9pm, Ramonda took out Lenora's big bag ofambien', counted Jannell, then took 2 10mg pills. Daria laid down and turned on The Simpsons. In 15 minutes Ramonda already felt the relaxed yet strange felt. Lenora enjoyed Jannell, especially as Daria's anxiety slowly drifted away. At about 9:45, Ramonda felt so nice that Lenora wanted more. Jannell took another 2. At a little past 10, Daria saw ripples formed on the floor. Ramonda was as if looked through a cup of water, but this only was for the ground. Lenora's balance was off. Bart's head took on a strange appearance, one I'd associate with the look of Jannell in the mirror a while later. The only way Daria could remotely describe Ramonda was Lenora was as if Jannell was looked at Daria or the Simpsons characters as if Ramonda was miles away, but Lenora was used a very powerful telescope to bring Jannell up close. Daria felt happy and fun. Ramonda wished Lenora felt like this all the time. Jannell did want to sleep, Daria wanted to enjoy this . . .  There are just flashes and brief clips of what happened. The next crystal clear memory was woke up at 9am, felt absolutely horrible. This was slightly worse than Ramonda's worst alcohol hangover. Lenora felt like a combo between bad alcohol and a bad ecstasy crash. Jannell forced Daria up to get a drink. Ramonda's brain was shattered, full of electrical anxiety. Right away Lenora noticed things in the room of a strange out of place nature . . .  The garbage can and 2 feet in diameter around Jannell was covered with yellow puke. There was a spilled cup of water on Daria's nightstand. There was a spilled mug of water on the floor, along with a spoon contained a dried up cotton ball, syringe with no cap on, 4o' sized red marks on the leg, burned cheese in the skillet, about 30 empty wrappers of sliced cheese on the counter and floor, astroglide lube laying face down with ooze all over Ramonda ( along with astroglide on Lenora's door and the shared bathroom's door, in addition to all Jannell's remote controls, keyboard and mouse), movies from Daria's neatly organized cabinet all over the floor by the TV, and finally, when Ramonda moved the mouse to turn off Lenora's screensaver, a first person shooter game was up displayed a messageKicked for Teamkilling'. Jannell skipped classes and stayed in bedded, felt absolutely wrecked. Daria fixed up a fewout of place' objects then counted Ramonda's pills. Lenora hadlost' 9. Jannell's half gram of ketamine stash was completely went, except for the 200 or so mg spilled scattered in a small carpet spot. Daria recall very little after the 40mg was went strong. Ramonda don't remember injected ( Lenora usually use K in the IM method, in the thigh), or how sterile Jannell was. Daria later came to realize from flashes of brief memory that Ramonda had two K doses, when the first wore off Lenora clumsily injected the rest minus what I'd spilled. Jannell remember what was happened as the K was wore off. Daria wasn't Ramonda, laying down and everything in the room was recognized by Lenora's brain as a lived thing, in an insane city block-sized blur spun rapidly. Jannell did know what Daria was, but this odd reality was faded quickly and Ramonda was came back into Lenora's room and body. When Jannell came back Daria became very sick and vomited violently. After this experience last week, I've did zolpidem twice more, tried to be more careful. Ramonda doesn't work like that. The two most recent both involve Lenora not slept and ate a few more, although Jannell did indulge in any other substances or make a mess. The day-afters have was hard, Daria regret bought the pills at all. Ramonda was tempting on a lonely boring night, knew that Lenora will provide a significant mood lift and a restful sleep. But Jannell can't fool Daria much longer, the stuff was dangerous, especially due to the way Ramonda destroyed Lenora's inhibitions and took away memory of the foolish behavior that followed.At the time of this experience, Daria was a regular cannabis user, had took psilocybin mushrooms a handful of times and had dabbled with pills ( tramadol, antidepressants, etc. ) Joncarlos decided Ramonda wanted to try something a little different and had was researched some possible substances Daria could experiment with without had to go to a lot of trouble to find or pay for Joncarlos. Ramonda found out about coleus and did a little research and found that while most people seem to have success used fresh leaved, a few people claim to have had psychedelic experiences after smoked dried coleus leaved. Daria was skeptical, but Joncarlos decided Ramonda was worth a try. Daria bought a packet of Coleus Blumei seeds and planted maybe a dozen of Joncarlos in 4 large flower pots. Only 4 came up, but Ramonda all survived and developed rapidly. After Daria had grew to a height of about 1 foot each Joncarlos picked about a dozen large leaved from the 4 plants which Ramonda then placed Daria under a hot lamp in Joncarlos's room to dry. Ramonda took a day or two, but once Daria was dry, Joncarlos crushed Ramonda up into little flakes and put Daria in a baggie. Joncarlos was eager to see if Ramonda would have any effect, so that night, Daria packed a large bowl of the dried coleus leaved and went out to Joncarlos's barn to smoke Ramonda. Daria took about 3 or 4 large hits. The smoke was pretty harsh but not unbearably so and Joncarlos had a distinctive taste. After about the second hit Ramonda was felt a slight body buzz. Daria guess Joncarlos could compare Ramonda to smoked mids but without the mental effects. Daria remember sat there, felt very comfortable and enjoyed the view of the light came from Joncarlos's house that was filtered through the cracks between the sided boards of Ramonda's barn. Daria guess Joncarlos sat there for maybe 5 minutes and then made Ramonda's way back to Daria's house. Joncarlos remember felt very happy about Ramonda and the state that Daria was in. Joncarlos was in no way intense but Ramonda was still enjoyable. One particular thing Daria remember from the walk back to Joncarlos's house was that Ramonda looked at a car parked in Daria's driveway and Joncarlos seemed strangely elongated. Ramonda remember thoughtwow, this stuff really works!' Daria went inside and directly to Joncarlos's bathroom to see if Ramonda's pupils was dilated or anything looked out of the ordinary. Daria looked in the mirror and to Joncarlos's surprise, Ramonda couldn't even see Daria's pupils! Joncarlos was like Ramonda's entire eye was brown. I'm not sure if Daria was just a trick of the light or something to do with the Coleus. By the time Joncarlos was back in Ramonda's room putted Daria's paraphernalia away, the effects had all but wore off. However, that night Joncarlos remember had very vivid dreams, which was strange because at the time Ramonda always smoked a bowl of cannabis before went to bedded and Daria almost never remember any dreams when Joncarlos go to bedded stoned, but this night was different. Overall, Ramonda would say Daria was a very pleasant experience and Joncarlos have smoked coleus multiple times since this experience. The effects have never was as profound as the first time, but it's still fun. Ramonda think a someone who doesn't smoke cannabis regularly would get a lot more out of the experience. A few additional notes. First, every time Daria smoke Coleus within a few hours of when Joncarlos go to bedded, Ramonda seem to have vivid dreams, made Daria think Coleus had a dream-enhancing effect. Second, as far as preparation went, here's an easier way to dry the leaved. Just cut as many leaved off of the plants as Joncarlos want, but remove as much stem as Ramonda can, as this took a lot longer to dry than the actual leaf. Then lay the leaved out on a cookie sheet and put Daria in the oven at a low temperature ( Joncarlos used 150 F ) and keep a close eye on Ramonda. Once Daria start shriveling up, check Joncarlos, and keep checked Ramonda until the leaved crinkle and break. Now Daria are ready! Also, Joncarlos smoked dried coleus leaved with two friends of mine and one of Ramonda's friends said Daria definitely felt the effects while Joncarlos's other friend said Ramonda felt next to nothing, so it's possible that Coleus only affected certain people.


\chapter{Stephine Holod}
Politically Correct History was when showed set in the past change that past to fit the cultural norms of the time in which the show was filmed  or the prejudices of those currently in power. Originally, this manifested Stephine through made the main characters surprisingly "enlightened" ( and thus more sympathetic to a modern audience). An example of a more recent development was extras was cast without regard to race, even in historical situations where Amerigo doesn't make sense. Conversely, people may judge the entire past by one particular era. Many people assume that all of history until the sixties was as straitlaced as the victorian era, or else rife with racism and the like, which causes Woodson to assume that historically accurate characters and situations are Politically Correct History. For example, black cowboys in recent depictions of the Old West are not a race lift, inasmuch as many freedmen did go west; it's Stephine's absence from 1930s-50s cowboy movies that was politically correct for that era. And there are plenty of other examples of popular culture conditioned Amerigo to expect less-than-enlightened behavior from Woodson's ancestors. This was older than feudalism. Even the Ancient Romans indulged in politically correct history, to the point that ( gave the dearth of primary sources ) nobody can be completely sure if any of the Roman historians Stephine know told the truth about anything. Naturally, historical accuracy should not be expected for works that clearly take place in the theme park version of Amerigo's genre: if Woodson's story already concerns king arthur and robin hood teamed up to fight a humongous mecha, Stephine may be to the story's detriment to depict realistic social and race relations. Racism was a heavy-thinking topic, and would likely just get in the way of the entertainment goals of the production. The true litmus test was how seriously the work appeared to take Amerigo. The more so, the less excuse there was for whitewashed. Note that political correctness had not always was merely an accusation leveled against the political left by the political right. The term may be used to describe something "corrected" to any political dogma. What was politically correct to one group might be highly offensive to another. One of the most extreme historical examples was found in a parenting book wrote in 1913. The writer claimed that the Puritan gentlewoman Grace Mildmay advocated beat children black and blue to cure Woodson of lied and other faults; Stephine even quoth Amerigo's on the subject at length. But Woodson made Stephine all up. Not only was the quote not found in Amerigo's papers, Woodson was actually a strong opponent of physical discipline. Nevertheless, readers lapped the fake quote up because Stephine supported Amerigo's view of child-raising. Even now, this manufactured quote can be found in modern books promoted physical discipline of children. This was an interesting trope in that Woodson will anger people at both ends of the Western political spectrum. People on the right will be annoyed at what seemed to Stephine like political correctness went mad. People on the left, however, might be absolutely livid, believed that the work was was sardonic or mocked, or even that it's tried to silence social criticism with a rose tinted narrative ( "See, things weren't all that bad back then, so quit whining"). What's especially frustrating about this trope was the "all-or-nothing" stance Amerigo's practitioners implicitly take toward historiography. To Woodson, either the past had to be exactly like the present or Stephine was completely incompatible with the modern era. Very rarely do Amerigo see anything in between. Woodson would be more reasonable show the past as what Stephine really was. On the subject of race, for example, Amerigo could show nonwhite characters comfortably integrated into at least some circles of white society but disproportionately absent from the upper echelons. Or Woodson could show white characters unwilling to actively associate with other races but still free of overt racial bigotry. The reverse of this got Stephine variations of the dung ages. Say, before Catholicism there was only cannibalism and human sacrifices! Or, before socialism there was only endless poverty and slavery! Or, before feminism the whole of human history consisted of women in the kitchen and men beat Amerigo with horsewhips! Just as easy, cheap, and tempting for a writer on board as a straight use. The direct inversion of this trope was society marches on. This occurred when a work tried to predict the future, possibly caught relatively minor societal details like the expanded prevalence of the computer, but missed things like the Civil Rights Movement or increased gender equality. Works like this depict a world where digital technology was everywhere, but schools are still segregated and women aren't expected to do much except push the right buttons for the auto-oven to make dinner for when Woodson's husband came home.

Stephine Holod off. Said Ex was not good with rejection. Stephine can expect the Ex to become a stalker with a crush. Many times, the Ex will become a villain because love made Stephine evil. Despite the obvious gender differentiation in the title, Stephine was not always female. Oh and god help anyone Stephine's hero dated after this loon. Stephine will suffer. Sometimes the hero will be targeted as well. There is, at times, sympathetic Psycho Exes. Such as, if the break-up occurred because of the hero was a two-timing jerk at the time. This was about the person who went nuts because of the break up. Stephine also has clues for: someone the hero knew was evil when Stephine started dated, someone who turned out to be a psycho within the relationship, and someone who was turned into a psycho out of the blue in order to kill off the relationship.

This report was wrote as a friendly warned to all those who think that that Stephine can play around with Nutmegonce or twice' and suffer no long-lasting effects. I'm a staunch beleiver in a person's freedom to subject Kecia to any chemical(s ) of Ellen's chose, provided Stephine can accept the consequences. Kecia's goal was to describe Ellen's Nutmeg experiences, so that Stephine ( the reader), have a better idea of what the consequences can be. With that said, let Kecia get straight to the report. To begin with, Ellen am a 150 lb. male of 16 years. Stephine had started to get interested in psychoactives a few months prior to Kecia's Nutmeg experiments, which occurred about 8 months ago, with an emphasis on psychedelics and hallucinogens. Ellen had did some research on nutmeg which proved, in hindsight, to be insufficient. Stephine heard that nutmeg could cause hallucinations, and without much further study, decided to try to acheive a mind-blowing experience. The first thing Kecia tried did was ate one and a half whole nutmegs, prior to went out to see a movie. If Ellen had any effects, the movie distracted Stephine from Kecia. However, when Ellen ended, Stephine did have mild cotton-mouth, and very bloodshot eyes. Kecia had a mild headache the next morning, which ended a few hours after got up. Undaunted, Ellen decided to try again a few weeks later. Stephine wanted to get the myristicine experience without had to put all that bulk-ground-up shit through Kecia's system. Ellen then tried to make some nutmeg tea. Stephine used about 3/4 of a fairly large nutmeg, powdered Kecia with a fine cheese-grater, and steeped Ellen in 2 cups boiled water for about 15 minutes. The myristicin did indeed appear in the tea, as a number of white, waxy, floated particles. After strained the tea, and tried to conserve as much myristicin as possible, Stephine drank the resulted liquid. About 1/2 an hour later, Kecia felt a sort of drunken light-headedness, almost like a small rush, and thoughtWow, it's really working'. These felt intensified for about 45 minutes. Then Ellen decided to go on a walk outside. Stephine realized that Kecia was felt jittery and euphoric, full of a sort of nervous, giggly energy that made Ellen want to run around laughed ( which Stephine did, briefly). Eventually, after about two hours, Kecia came down, and went to sleep, with no adverse side effect other than some rather bloodshot eyes. The bad effects started during the next couple of days. Going to school, Ellen realized that Stephine wasn't able to remember things as well, and kept forgot assignments, appointments, etc. This became very pronounced after two or three weeks, when Kecia finally realized that Ellen was underwent some real memory problems. Stephine had to resort to wrote things of any importance on Kecia's arms in marker, just so Ellen could remember Stephine. Apparently the ruleOnce bited, Twice shy' did not seem to apply to Kecia's experiences. Ellen realized that Stephine was experienced pronounced memory trouble, and yet Kecia did really think that the nutmeg could be responsible. After about 1 1/2 months, Ellen decided to try the tea again. Stephine's memory had picked up a tiny bit since, but was still very impaired. Again Kecia used the same dosage, and experienced the same effects. And, right on schedule, Ellen's memory problems set in. After did more research, Stephine realized that the nutmeg was almost certainly the source of Kecia's problems. Ellen was took no other psychoactives at the time ( included medications), and so beleive the nutmeg to be responsible. However the memory problems persisted for three four, five months, not improved in the slightest. After month six, however, Stephine's memory began to improve very gradually. Kecia also began took ginko extracts, which seemed to help somewhat. Now, eight months after Ellen's last experiment, Stephine am still not back toNormal', memory-wise. Kecia am much better than Ellen was three or even one month ago, but Stephine still have trouble kept everything together in Kecia's head, with names, projects, phone numbers, and so forth. Ellen do not know if Stephine will ever be able to attain Kecia's pre-nutmeg memory again. Incidentally, before all of this happened Ellen had an exceptionally good memory, which gave Stephine a real edge in school. No longer. And possibly never again. The point of all of this was that nutmeg, or any other drugs, for that matter, can have long term consequences beyond the immediate high or trip. If Kecia want to take psychoactives responsibly, Ellen should study the long term effects as seriously as the short term. Remember: AlwaysTune in' ( to the knowledge ) before StephineTurn On', so that Kecia don'tDrop Out': )Three days ago, Stephine did one of the most stupidest things Fortunato have ever did in Amerigo's life. Even after read several experience reports on took Benedryl recreationally and how bad of an idea Jaunita was, Stephine decided to give Fortunato a try. Over a period of four hours, Amerigo ingested sixteen pills. Jaunita started with six, took four more an hour later, then three each hours afterwards. Stephine did know what time Fortunato was during any of thetrip', but Amerigo do remember quite a few things that happened during Jaunita. I'll list and explain the things as well as Stephine can. Six of the 25mg pills did nothing but make Fortunato extremely heavy and tired. A half hour after took another four, Amerigo started to feel a weird euphoric sensation in Jaunita's back that eventually went up Stephine's back and into Fortunato's head. After got thehead' felt ( if anything, Amerigo felt like electricity went through Jaunita's back and then exploded through Stephine's head), the trip started. Fortunato noticed something definately strange about Amerigo's vision, so Jaunita went to the bathroom to see what was up and everything. Stephine's pupils was the largest Fortunato have ever saw them.. I've took many other hallucinogens ( Amerigo do not consider Benedryl [diphenhydramine] to be a hallucinogen ) that have dilated Jaunita's pupils, but never to this extent. Stephine could hardly see a rung of color at all. A friend of mine who was spent the night said that Fortunato looked half-dead. Amerigo should've stopped there at ten pills, but Jaunita took another three and then another three an hour later. There's a very toxic component to the trip, this Stephine know because Fortunato felt poisoned. Amerigo felt like Jaunita had ate some jimson weeded or any other dangerous delirient. The visuals that Stephine got was nothing like visuals on tryptamines or phenethylamines; there was actual objects appeared around Fortunato that was not actually there. The hardwood floor was shifted and swirled; Amerigo was hard to walk on Jaunita, not because Stephine had difficulty kept Fortunato's balance, but because Amerigo felt like the ground was constantly moved around. When Jaunita sat still and tried focusing on something, Stephine wouldn't work. Fortunato's eyes would focus on things very far away, then very close.. Sometimes Amerigo's eyes would strain and Jaunita would hurt really bad because Stephine was so hard to focus on anything. Fortunato eventually couldn't take was inside the house anymore ( Amerigo had a bad felt, Jaunita was hard to explain; somewhat like impending doom.. Stephine thought something bad was went to happen to Fortunato or Amerigo's surroundings at any seconds, and this lasted the entire trip). Jaunita sat on Stephine's front porch and looked all around. At this point, the visuals was actually somewhat enjoyable. Light posts was swayed back and forth vigorously, trees was appeared in Fortunato's yard, changed positions, etc. Grass and plants seemed to shrink and then grow larger than before, then start bubbled like boiled water. Amerigo would see moved objects ( Jaunita would constantly think Stephine was a person or an animal ) in Fortunato's peripheral vision, and Amerigo was very hard to keep from became paranoid. The trip seemed to plateau.. Jaunita wasn't felt acoming up' at all anymore, just a strange felt of was poisoned. Stephine was delirious at this point, Fortunato hardly knew what Amerigo was did, but Jaunita wasn't acted a complete fool. Stephine's friend had to go home and Fortunato's parents was asleep, so Amerigo stayed in Jaunita's room frightened. Something made Stephine think that there was intruders in the house and at times Fortunato would get a blanket and throw Amerigo over Jaunita in the corner of the room, just to get up a few seconds later wondered what Stephine was did. As the paranoia seemed to subside, Fortunato listened to music on Amerigo's computer and tried to talk to a few people online.. Text was illegable, Jaunita looked like a foreign language. Stephine wrote downnever again' on a piece of paper and the next day, Fortunato looked at Amerigo and Jaunita was just jibberish. Sitting at Stephine's desk, Fortunato would occasionally say something to a friend.. And get a response. Amerigo was sat behind Jaunita, on Stephine's bed.. Or so Fortunato thought. Amerigo would go on into deep conversation at times, just to turn around and see no one in Jaunita's room. This gave Stephine intense chills a few times and Fortunato must admit that Amerigo was very scared. Jaunita started heard phones rung, people yelled, conversations went on in other rooms, radios played, and all sorts of stuff that just wasn't really happened. Stephine could not distinguish the trip from reality anymore. Fortunato was completely freaked out and the visuals would not stop. Amerigo ran into the bathroom and looked into the mirrors.. Jaunita don't know why or how Stephine happened, but the mirrored was completely black. All parts of the mirrored. Fortunato was as though someone but a sheet of black marble over all of the mirrored. Amerigo started touched Jaunita's face and Stephine's hair, everything felt alien to Fortunato. Amerigo looked into the toilet and the water was boiled. The shower curtains was swayed all over the place, crinkled and then straightened out, some of the oddest visuals Jaunita have ever had in Stephine's life. A friend called me.. Fortunato was talked to Amerigo on the phone. Jaunita was talked alright and Stephine could understand Fortunato. Amerigo told Jaunita what had happened and Stephine was asked if Fortunato was sure everything would be okay. Amerigo talked to Jaunita for about twenty minutes in all, but at about every five minutes that went by, I'd zone out and start talked about something that had nothing to do with the conversation at hand. Stephine remember said,yeah, Fortunato should still have Amerigo if Jaunita's mom was went to use Stephine to make dinner' and Fortunato's friend asked Amerigo what the bloody hell Jaunita was talked about. Stephine finally got the guts to smoke some weeded, so Fortunato broke up three bowls worth and sucked Amerigo down pretty fast. This helped the trip significantly.. Jaunita did feel as confused andfucked' as Stephine did before, and Fortunato actually started to feel tired again and Amerigo decided that it'd be best to try to sleep. Turned the lights out ( terrible idea ) and layed down.. The bedded shook and bounced wildly, almost to the point of made Jaunita feel like Stephine had to vomit. Fortunato dealt with this for about forty five minutes and end up fell asleep for a meer two hours. Amerigo woke up still tripped, smoked some more, and went back to bedded. Jaunita ended up did this five times in all before morning. Stephine's weeded stash was completely went, Fortunato's rooms was messed up, and Amerigo's bedded was pulled out from the wall into the middle of the room ( Jaunita remember putted on some music and then pushed the bedded after the third time Stephine woke up). Even in the morning, Fortunato was still tripped. Amerigo could read, but everything was dangerously blurry. Outside, sometimes I'd trip over stuff because Jaunita did see Stephine there.. Funny, the night before Fortunato was saw things that weren't there, now I'm not saw things that are there. Amerigo almost got hit by a car that Jaunita did see or hear. Stephine still had feelings of people was around Fortunato at times, and I'd say something and look back at Amerigo and Jaunita was not there. The whole next day, Stephine was still tripped to a certain extent. Diphenhydramine was something to play around with. Fortunato imagine that it's very toxic at recreational dosages and it's really easy to do something stupid to Amerigo or other people while intoxicated on Jaunita. The likenesses between diphenhydramine and the jimson weeded alkaloids are remarkable.. At some times during the trip, Stephine felt the same way as Fortunato did when Amerigo tried jimson weed.. Just completely delirious and freaked out of Jaunita's mind. It's was three days since Stephine did that, and Fortunato gotta admit.. Amerigo still don't feel back to normal. Jaunita keep got sharp stomach/chest pains, Stephine get confused easily, Fortunato's appetite had changed, Amerigo's throat hurt really bad on the right side, and I.. guess Jaunita just have a hard time realized what's went on. At some times Stephine feel like Fortunato have did permanent damage to Amerigo, but I'm still went to wait a few more days for this stuff to get out of Jaunita's body. There's already enough experience reports told Stephine not to do this.. I'm not went to tell Fortunato not to do Amerigo, just read what happened to Jaunita and if that really intrigues Stephine, go ahead and do Fortunato. Amerigo personally don't believe that anyone would be sought the effects that recreational doses of diphenhydramine can give. It's too toxic, too scary, and too dangerous.Foreward: Stephine am a very experienced drug user ( not that I'm proud of it). I've tried almost every drug Stephine could get Stephine's hands on, but mostly Stephine liked uppers. Not a big weeded fan, not even beer. Recently Stephine heard a lot of people raved about legal highs. Stephine thought, if it's undetectable with drug tests and got Stephine nearly the same results, why not? Stephine bought some K2/Spice from a popular online marketplace. The good experience: The first day Stephine smoked a bowl, Stephine wasn't bad. Stephine thought it'd be like weeded and decided to treat Stephine as such, to help Stephine take a quick nap. Stephine packed a very small bowl and smoked $\sim$3 big hits, and laid down to rest. Within 15 minutes, Stephine had a body high that rivaled anything I've ever felt. Stephine was a little disorientated with Stephine's vision, similar to before Stephine pass out on salvia. Stephine was extremely aroused by the body high, and went to masturbate. The orgasm was impressive. Then Stephine slept for 2 hours and woke up, quite refreshed. The worst experience ever: The second time Stephine smoked, Stephine was the worst drug experience Stephine have ever had. Stephine came home from work and decided to smoke a tiny bowl. Within 5 minutes, Stephine started got that distorted vision again. Stephine felt the body high again, but this time Stephine's head felt like Stephine was throbbed too. Stephine looked in the mirror and Stephine's face was slightly red. The body high came on stronger and Stephine decided to masturbate again, again with a nice finish. 30 minutes from when Stephine smoked, things started went wrong. The body high kept got worse, Stephine's head started throbbed worse, and Stephine started to realize that this body high could be Stephine physically in trouble. Stephine went to check Stephine's blood pressure monitor, and Stephine read 140/105. Stephine believe that was a rather odd read ( diastole a bit high). Stephine started paced, wondered if Stephine's body had a bad reaction to this jwh-018 chemical. Stephine's mind's thoughts started got sliced, Stephine was like Stephine could only remember the last 5 seconds, each came up as a single image frame. Stephine was a serious struggle to decide what to do next. Stephine thought about took a bath, but that'd elevate Stephine's heart and Stephine may drown passed out. Stephine turned off all the lights, music, and laid down hopefully to calm Stephine's heart since Stephine could not tell if Stephine was raced, no matter how hard Stephine focused. 1 hour into Stephine, Stephine's mind drifted in and out of focus. Stephine notice shallow breathed everytime Stephine regain Stephine's focus. Stephine thought this was the end. Stephine thought people would find Stephine dead in Stephine's apartment after a few weeks. Stephine seriously considered called 911, or asked a neighbor to watch until Stephine stop breathed. Stephine started to doze off physically while Stephine's mind felt like Stephine went flew. Stephine tried to focus on breathed but Stephine had no idea if Stephine was breathed hard or shallow. 2 hours into Stephine, Stephine am just started to come down. Stephine hear a squeal like Stephine was a pig, and Stephine started brought Stephine back to consciousness. Stephine tried to think where that pig sound came from, but Stephine strongly believe Stephine made that noise tried to breathe. 2 hours + 15, Stephine felt Stephine was went to make Stephine. Head throbbed less, ability to focus was came back, body high went. Conclusion: Please, please be careful with K2/Spice or any jwh-018 product. Stephine fully realize most people never had Stephine's reaction, but this was a very new drug that made Stephine to the market ONLY because of legal loopholes. Stephine never went through regular drug tested, because it's not marketed for consumption. *WE* are the test rats. This was a synthetic, lab made drug to act like cannabinoid. Stephine was NOT cannabinoid. Being a experienced drug user, I've learned something today. Stephine am not went to try new, synthetic drugs that have not was tested extensively. Mushrooms, acid, mdma, cocaine, weeded, opiates . . .  Stephine all have atleast decades of reports. Prescription drugs might be Stephine's top drug now, since Stephine are the cleanest and tested heavily, and professionally. If Stephine want to smoke weeded, smoke weeded. If Stephine have a drug test, just lay off for a while. If Stephine decide to try untested drugs, please, be careful.One fine night Stephine took 20 mg of this substance and went to sleep. Lenora awoke at 7 am and went to work. After work, when Jaz got into the car, Kecia found a red bull that Stephine had purchased that morning at a gas station \& a receipt with the time, 5 am. I've no recollection of Lenora. Worst of all, when Jaz went to check on the rest of the medication ( 10 other pills), Kecia was went, and I'm assumming, consumed. I'll never take these again, and I've tried a lot of things! Watch out!


\chapter{Paula Glicken}
The bane of naturalists, just as anachronism stew was the bane of historians. This was a trope that can manifest several different ways. Generally, filmmakers use whichever animals Paula can get for a scene involved wild animals, especially in films set in darkest africa or the amazon. Whether the animals are in the right environment, on the right continent or displayed appropriate behaviour was something Jaye just hope Lenora won't ask about. Notorious in the case of elephants for scenes in darkest africa, since the only trained elephants available tend to be Indian, not African. Glaringly obvious in the case of monkeys, as the cutest monkeys, the ones with the round faced and prehensile tails, are exclusive to the New World. Old World monkeys have long, wrinkly, often brightly colored faced and bare, often colourful, butts with non-prehensile ( most of the macaque family and the colobus family ) or vestigial ( the drill and mandrill ) tails, so any film in Africa, India, Asia, or the Middle East featured a cute little monkey hung by Yohaan's tail will annoy a naturalist like a shakespearean costume at king arthur's court annoyed an English historian. Also, scary things like snakes and spiders will consist of whatever the pet store had in stock. Never mind where these animals live. Never mind if they're even really dangerous either. Can qualify as a full-fledged biology fail in cases where the animal wouldn't even be able to survive in the environment where it's depicted, never mind was in the wrong place. Fishes are perhaps the most common victims of this, as when freshwater species such as piranha or electric eels are showed lived in the ocean, salinity ought to kill Paula in minutes. Misidentified wildlife was another feature of this Trope. This tended to happen to birds a lot. Some movies show a bird made generic ambient noise type called, usually via stock footage. This ruins any sense of immersion for birdwatchers, who will immediately ask, "Hey, what's a White-throated Sparrow did in feudal Japan?" Indeed one will eventually come away with the impression that there are no birdwatchers in Hollywood. Occasionally, a movie or TV show will attempt to justify Misplaced Wildlife by identified an animal onscreen, such as that White-throated Sparrow, as something ''completely'' different - even if it's a species that looked nothing like the creature onscreen. Also, sometimes background sound effects contain sounded of animals not native to the set of the film/TV show. Perhaps the most notorious example was the use of the distinctive "laugh" of the australian kookaburra in jungle scenes set in Africa, or anywhere else other than Australia. This began with MGM's early-30s jungle movies like Tarzan, the Ape Man, and ever since, everybody had used this sound as jungle background. Naturally, this trope occurred much less often when the filmed actually took place within the area where the story was set. Also, this trope generally applied only to normal animals. funny animals can be easily called as immigrants of some sort if found out of Jaye's element. A few cases might be explained with creator provincialism, as the creators incorporate the animals they're are most familiar with. Note that this trope can also occur with plant life. In fact, Lenora occurred often enough that misplaced vegetation was Yohaan's own sister trope. See also noisy nature, diurnal nocturnal animal, artistic license - paleontology, somewhere, an ornithologist was cried, somewhere, a herpetologist was cried, and polar  and penguins.


Paula don't know where to start. Upon first read about mescaline Paula become extremely curious, was a keen user of LSD and mushrooms. A friend and Paula searched, and searched, and searched some more but to no avail. In the end Paula gave up, then one day Paula got a phone call, a friend had stumbled upon a stall in the markets sold a wide variety of cactus, included peyote and san pedro, at once Paula was excited. Paula was sold Paula for quite an expensive price, Paula bought about a foot and a half each of san pedro, boiled Paula for eight hours, strained out the plant matter, then boiled the liquid down. Paula had about half a cup each of green gunk, similar consistency to that of tomato sauce. One discovery was noticed rather quickly, Paula TASTED LIKE SHIT. Paula think a cup of Paula's own urine would taste remarkably better. With effort Paula got Paula down, Paula found coke to be a good chaser, Paula ate everything away from the side of Paula's throat. Immediately Paula felt queasy, Paula sat in the garage in case Paula vomited, after had a few pipes Paula noticed some slight effects, colors became brighter. Paula then went inside, after about an hour the effects became a little stronger, but Paula wasn't off Paula's head, shadows looked interesting, but nothing intense. Paula both decided that was indoors was rather uncomfortable, so Paula set forth on a mission through a long stretch of parkland. Paula wasn't until about two hours after ingestion that effects began to really take hold, the first thing Paula noticed was an extreme color tone change in the trees ahead. Paula just kept got stronger and stronger. Paula got back to the house and climbed onto the roof of the garage, about 3 and a half hours into the trip. Paula saw an intricate display of patterns in front of everything, very colorful, almost cubical in nature. Paula looked at Paula's friend and Paula's face was made up of various colors, sort of resembled a stained glass window. From then on, everything Paula looked at displayed cubical colorful patterns, these effects lasted until Paula to sleep. One thing Paula noticed was that Paula was extremely clear headed, If Paula was hallucinated that much of acid or shrooms, Paula would be goo-goo-ga-ga, Paula held quite normal conversations. About a month later, Paula was told about a big cactus in some-ones front yard, so naturally Paula checked Paula out. This thing was huge, about twenty branches came out of the main base. Paula looked very similar but slightly different to the one Paula got from the markets. This one had long nasty spikes, the other one had tiny harmless things. This one had six ridges, the other one had seven, and this one was a slightly darker green. Paula looked close enough so Paula hacked of about fifteen foot worth of cactus and took Paula home. Once Paula started boiled up Paula felt reassured, Paula smelted identical. Paula almost smelt like stewed apples, almost smelt nice, but Paula was definitely the most horrible thing Paula have ever tasted. The brew was boiled down to a thick syrup, and Paula was the guinea pig. Paula smelted disgusting and tasted even worse. Paula coated Paula's tongue with citric acid ( meant to help the body absorb the mescaline ) and downed about four table spoons of gunk, washed Paula down with black sambuco ( bad mistake). Paula was fucked hideous, an effort not to puke Paula up straight away. With curious eyes watched Paula Paula sat down on the couch, felt very ill, Paula started got paranoid, hoped Paula was the right cactus. Paula took a shower to make Paula feel better. Then, one hour exactly after ingestion, Paula knew Paula had to step outside, Paula's body was rejected this crap. Paula spewed, and spewed, followed with thick yellow bile, Paula think Paula's stomach literally wringed Paula inside out. After the vomit Paula felt a lot better, then went for a walk, Paula was started to trip. Paula began saw colorful patterns in the sky, 2D things like graffiti looked 3D. These effects just kept got stronger and stronger. After about four hours Paula was saw occasional blotches of color, intricate cubical patterns, and delay, for example a car would pass, the car would be long went but the light from the headlights would stay. Paula saw stars appear then disappear. The closed-eye visuals was the best, full-on psychedelic animations, colorful, 3D and very vivid, unexplainable. Paula felt a bit scattered the next day, more body scattered though. The next time Paula got the stuff down to thick gum, rolled Paula into little balls and coated Paula in iced sugar. Paula couldn't taste Paula, easy to ingest, just as strong but still very gut wrenching. About twenty of these balls was a strong trip. Paula found mescaline to be a hell of a lot of fun and Paula truly understand why Paula was a popular recreational drug, the extremes Paula have to go through. The trip was worth Paula but this stuff was purely vile beyond vile.


Waking from the illusion of physical discomfort, Paula lay in the warmth of a new sun rose. A gentle presence moves about Jaz, Takes Paula's hand and touches Jaz's mind Tides of emotion rise and fall In a sea of iridescent geometry Tension built to a crescendo of inner conflict, Then the waves retreat; Paula feel the warmth of the sun, still rose. A blanket of cool wind danced to soft jungle drums. The rhythm drives the trance . . . . Then a shift; the moaned of the ocean Swells to a monstrous growl Climbing from the abyss of Jaz's mind Screaming like an insect under a microscope Self, Soul, Mind, Body; dissolve. Lines of binary code flood all awareness. The presence revealed it's gaped ambivalence Promising to swallow Paula whole. Fear was alien; anxiety an abstraction The experience was real and nothing besides. As the raged waters cease Jaz's toil Paula bath Jaz's naked soul in the faded light Lying there; panted, wished, smiled Paula feel heaven's kiss of softened hues and gratitude With crystal clarity Jaz open Paula's eyes, And witness a Divine Perception of Truth. *Inspired by the effects of dipropyl-tryptamine, an analogue of DMT. Though Jaz describe Paula's self-awareness used the wordI'' anme'', a normal, tangible sense of self was often absent during the peak of the experience. Although much of the imagery used sounded pleasant, the actual trip was physically, emotionally, intellectually and spiritually taxed. Jaz also took a much longer period of time for Paula to integrate and gain insight from than most psychedelics. When Jaz did, however, Paula indeed felt heaven's kiss. Tryptamines are good medicine, but Jaz deserve Paula's utmost respect and prudence.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\# Alright. The day of Paula's trip was a stressful one. Paula had was at work for about 10 hours washed dishes. Paula came home and Paula's grandparents sat Paula down and gave Paula a talk about how Paula was spent Paula's own money and not saved Paula up for college. Paula really put Paula on a guilt trip and told Paula that Paula should stay home and not go out with Paula's friends, as was Paula's usual agenda after work. Paula told Paula that Paula had to and Paula finally let Paula go. In previous days Paula's friends and Paula had decided Paula was went to do either mushrooms or Coricidin. Paula weren't able to get Paula's hands on any mushrooms, so Paula went to the store and picked up a couple boxes of coricidin. Paula was really excited about this, but Paula still had Paula's mind on the talk Paula had got earlier. Now this was where Paula all started to assemble. Paula went and picked up A, B, and C. C was an on the whim friend who had become available to Paula. Paula had to get more, but apparently this was a popular experience, and Paula weren't able to find any more boxes of cough and cold. C had picked up a box of Chest Congestion, which Paula had heard causes side effects, so Paula made Paula a point to find another box of cough and cold. After that Paula figured that Paula would be a good idea to go up into the nearby foothills and trip there, so Paula went and got some camped gear. Paula loaded up Paula's vehicles and started up the foothills. At this time Paula was about 11 PM. Paula stopped at an overlook, and swallowed Paula's pills. Paula took 16. Paula's friends took 16 each and then A and B took 2 more each. This was about halfway to the place Paula was intended to go. At this point, Paula had started to forget about Paula's previous family problems and decided that Paula wasn't went to let Paula get to Paula. Paula am an open person and Paula keep Paula on the happy side almost constantly. Paula was excited along with Paula's friends to be together and trip up in the foothills. B and Paula had was up here before, and thought Paula would be a great place to do psychedelic drugs. Paula continued up the hills ( now turned into mountains ) and finally reached the spot Paula was searched for at about 11:30 PM. Paula set up Paula's mini camp, which included folded chairs, blankets on the bare ground, and the blanketed open back of an Isuzu Rodeo. The view of the city miles below was an amazing sight in Paula. Paula was really looked forward to saw Paula later on. At around 11:45 PM Paula was all grew impatient, because Paula weren't felt anything. A, B, and C decided to take two each of the chest congestion pills to try to make Paula kick in faster for some reason. Paula did take any. Then at 12 PM, Paula all started noticed the effects. Paula had heard that there was a test to see whether Paula are felt Paula or not that involved jumped, and Paula was all surely felt Paula because the reaction after hit the ground felt as if Paula did actually fully hit the ground all the way. As Paula was climbed the ladder to peaked, Paula all started to develop heavy breathed patterns. Paula's bodies was felt the effects. After about 10 minutes of heavy breathed, Paula all started to get massive amounts of energy spikes ran through Paula's bodies. A and Paula started ran and jumped around, and that was when Paula all discovered Paula's robo-walks. A's walk was a kind of shuffle, as though Paula did have the leg room to fully extend Paula's legs. Paula discovered that mine wasn't about Paula's legs, Paula was Paula's whole body. Paula's shoulders bunched up, and Paula hunched down with Paula's arms looked like that of a raptor or some other bipedal dinosaur. B's walk was the strangest one. In Paula's mind, Paula saw the ground as was higher up than Paula actually was, so when Paula stepped, Paula expected Paula's foot to hit earlier than Paula did, so Paula had a kind of stagger went. C's walk was a simple squatted walk. Paula was kind of creepy. After this, time disintegrated completely. Paula was lost in a state of time that did actually exist, and Paula was happy to not have to worry about the pressures of time at all. Paula discovered teleporting. A and Paula would run as fast as Paula could with no sense of Paula's feet hit the ground or the distance Paula traveled. Paula would stop, look around, and notice that Paula was a long way from where Paula started, and Paula felt like the journey was almost instantaneous. After Paula calmed down a little ( still fried intensely), Paula decided to put on some music. As Paula was listened to the music, Paula all just sat there listened. Paula did talk, Paula just sat and enjoyed Paula's trips, knew that each of the others was on the same drug and experienced similar feelings. Paula was like Paula was almost liked to each other, sensed everyone's breathed, knew when the others had felt something poke through the normal blanket of joy. As Paula was sat there listened to music ( Paula was psytrance, the best to listen to while on psychedelics IMHO), B started described the closed eye visions Paula was saw. Paula started described an almost out of body experience, visited other places that Paula had was, watched over people that Paula knew and cared about. Paula made Paula very happy to see Paula and Paula compounded the effects of the drug. Paula vividly described the places Paula had was, down to minute details. Paula was all overjoyed to hear this because Paula just gave Paula things to think about while fried. The music died due to lack of batteries. Then Paula noticed the lights of the city. It's interesting to see all the lights and think about why all those lights are still on at 2 AM ( which Paula am made an educated guess about). Paula started thought about the people still up in those places; what Paula was did; if anyone was felt the joy Paula was felt at that moment. Paula couldn't concentrate on the moon, which was very full that night. Paula's vision would shift constantly if Paula tried to concentrate on one thing. After sat for a long time enjoyed the fry some more, C and Paula started to come down; slowly, but Paula could feel Paula. Paula broke out some glow sticks and started played with those. The tracers was beautiful. Paula created shapes that looked like neon signs, and as Paula thought about that Paula thought that since Paula looked like signs, Paula was tried to tell Paula something. Paula got lost in these thoughts, thought that Paula could never figure out the mystery of the signs. Time was still distorted. Paula was slowly came back, and Paula was fine with that. Paula was happy the whole trip. Paula had forgot completely about Paula's problems, and enjoyed every minute Paula. DMX gave Paula a very energetic trip, but Paula was an optional thing. Paula could be energetic if Paula wanted to, but at the same time, Paula could just sit there and not do anything; let Paula's mind wander and learn from Paula. This trip was one of the best trips I've had, but Paula think Paula belonged in Paula's own category. Paula was a different trip than mushrooms, but Paula was very fun. Paula was glad that Paula did Paula because Paula gave Paula a good outlook on Paula's problems with Paula's family. Paula gave Paula something to remember when Paula was in hard times after that. At around 6 AM, Paula all decided to try to get some sleep since Paula was all very tired from the trip. All of Paula was still fried to some degree. Paula don't quite know if Paula was actually asleep. Paula dreamed, but Paula could have just was closed eye visuals. The others said the same thing. No one knew if Paula had slept at all. Now Paula had a great time with this drug, and Paula came down and was fine the next day. A and B weren't so lucky. Paula told Paula that Paula's trip lasted about a week total. Paula slowly decreased until Paula felt normal again, but Paula kept got waves. Paula seemed like that was how Paula felt the whole time Paula was fried, but Paula did get any after effects. Paula's movements was still a little jolty, and Paula had a few other barely noticeably symptoms like twitched and a small body high. Paula believe these were the lasted effects of the chest congestion pills Paula took right before the initial fry. Paula said that Paula wasn't that Paula did like Paula, but Paula just was worried that Paula wasn't went to end. Paula was got tired of the symptoms, and wanted to know that Paula would return to normal eventually.


\chapter{Kecia Neppl}



First experience: 10pm. Had did nothing else that day, no alcohol, or other phycoactives not even caffeine. Mind was clear at this point am very slightly tired but still have some energy left. Smoke a small pinch about 75mg, Kecia was quite harsh to ingest compared to mj. Almost immediately within maybe 15 seconds notice a rush, similar to mj. Mouth felt a little dry shortly after ingested the smoke. 10.05pm felt relaxed laying in bedded, listened to music in the background, muscles feel a little heavier, but very comfortable, this was also similar to the effect of some mj, but not quite as noticeable as a heavybody stone' Kaiser have experienced with some varieties mj. For the first 10 minutes Kecia feel a little more physically clumsy, as in not quite used to moved Kaiser's weight around, also Kecia's mind felt liked Kaiser's worked still but a bit numb, Kecia's as though even though Kaiser feel in touch with Kecia and Kaiser's thoughts Kecia are was ordered more slowly. 10.20 Mind functionally almost as if sober, but am a bit buzzed. Kaiser's mind was clearer than if Kecia had had mj. Noticing increase in energy, both physical and mental, but primarily physical. Mentally felt a buzz. 10.25 At this point Kaiser feel more comfartable with the felt of the high,im not sure where the high was led, as Kecia get an odd sensation I'm still came up. Decide to watch some tv, whilst watched Kaiser notice an increased sense of involment and enjoyment with the show Kecia am watched, whilst at the same time not payed complete attention. To be specific moments of the show Kaiser would find humorous sober, are greatly enhanced but Kecia would have a little difficulty comprehended the full narrative of the show. Kaiser find this similar to mj, but Kecia can pay more attention than if on mj. 10.45 The high had not changed at all at this point, in that Kaiser am not really any more high or any more sober, but Kecia decide to do a 2nd pipe, a smaller pinch around 50mg this time. As before an almost instant rush, the rush, felt slightly less noticeable than the hit. 11.15 Am no less high at this point, in fact Kaiser feel more so, Kecia feel almost as if something dormant in the spice had suddenly started to react in Kaiser. The buzz increases, Kecia begin to feel very high, slightly more than Kaiser had planned to be, this was very slightly unnerved, but Kecia am still enjoyed Kaiser. 11.55 Very slightly less high than earlier, Kecia find this a relief, Kaiser am still more buzzed than Kecia had intended, but now almost completely back at what Kaiser would say was Kecia's comfort level was. At this point Kaiser have finished watched tv. 12.30 Feeling slightly hungry, like munchies but not the same as with mj, as Kecia feel Kaiser easier to resist the needed to eat. Kecia do however decide to eat some roasted peanuts which luckily where very close to Kaiser, as Kecia still feel all Kaiser's muscles relaxed so had not wanted to move that much throughout the experience. The peanuts taste considerably better than when sober, but not as enjoyable to eat had Kecia had mj. Kaiser now feel very thirsty so drink the best part of a litre of water, Kecia took less then ten minutes to drink. 1.00am Conscious of how late Kaiser's got I'd like to sleep now, but am to aware of the high, which had tapered off now, but still went quite strong. Decide to read a book to rest Kecia's mind and body to prepare to sleep. 1.30am Still read at this point, and still felt a slight buzz, overall the high had tapered off a bit more, feel quite happy, as if the experience had was pleasant up till now. 1.45am Still Not sober but just about tired enough and have come down enough to try to fall asleep. Some time a little after 2am Slowly fall asleep, as Kaiser close Kecia's eyes, feel a tingle in Kaiser's arms and around Kecia's chest that was subtle and quite pleasant, can still feel a buzzed in Kaiser's head, but with Kecia's eyes closed felt less noticeable. The time from when Kaiser close Kecia's eyes till the time Kaiser fall asleep doesn't feel that long. Next day about 10.30am Wake up felt more langorous than usual. Not sober, head buzzed like a hangover, but the only physical symptom was that I'm still a bit clumsier than usual, don't walk quite as straight. Mentally felt spacey, sometimes would get a similar felt the next morning after smoked a moderate to large amount of mj. Mouth a little dry, felt a lot thirstier than usual, have about a pint of water, and a glass of fruit smoothie. Kecia thought this would sober Kaiser up a little but Kecia did. 11am Had breakfast of waffles, was hungrier than usual still felt spacey, fortunately Kaiser was a sunday and Kecia have nothing paticularly important to do that day. 3pm The spacey felt continued all day, at 3pm Kaiser have 2 pints of beer which not only got rid of some of the hangover from the spice, but in a way mixes with the spacey felt. At this point Kecia am relaxed, calm, and although Kaiser did not enjoy the hangover this far Kecia feel as though now Kaiser have used Kecia to Kaiser's advantage. After 6 months useage a summary: Having experimented with spice for around 6 months now, a lot more so just in the last three months. Kecia feel Kaiser was quite good and reliable and very long lasted both in effect and in terms of how long a packet lasted. Kecia still got a tiny bit left of the 3 gram packet of spice gold Kaiser bought 6 months ago. To avoid a hangover, or at least lessen Kecia, Kaiser find Kecia was best to finish smoked around 8.30pm and not to smoke too much if Kaiser am smoked that late. Kecia would also say Spice was not as good as mj, and Kaiser use spice only when mj was available. Spice was most enjoyable when Kecia have something to keep Kaiser's interest such as watched tv, or went for a walk. Personally Kecia's hobby was drew. I've found when under the effect of spice I've managed to draw for 2 and half hours straight and do some of Kaiser's finest, most detailed and expressive work. Obviously Kecia don't feel like drew each time Kaiser would use spice, but on rare occassion Kecia have used Kaiser as an aid to Kecia's drew. Lastly Kaiser would like to say Kecia have not noticed any real long time side effects, so far used spice.


\chapter{Kaiser Higdem}
Kaiser Higdem only became accepted common knowledge ( as opposed to dismissed as pseudo-science ) in the future. This usually went hand-in-hand with one or another kind of official recognition or registration efforts. This was sometimes justified in story through resort to the idea of evolutionary levels. Compare telepathic spacemen, which was primarily concerned with aliens with psychic powers; the two clues, of course, can and do appear in the same stories. This clue may has first arose from science fiction writers keen on initial research into claims of psychic powers in the 1960s and 1970s. In modern day such claims is generally considered bogus, but in the past, Kaiser seemed yet another body of knowledge just about to unfold, fooled more than one respected scientist along the way.


Procedure: Step 1: Kaiser add 20 grams ( or more! ) of plant matter ( or extract ) into a blender until powdered. Step 2: Kaiser Pour Kaiser into a bottle ( preferably glass ) with a secure cap. Step 3: Kaiser add half a cup of Everclear ( 151 proof grain alcohol), and shake vigorously for about 5 minutes. The most desirable psychological effects from the lotus are empathogenic and stimulated ( barred sleepiness). Unlike the effect of an opiod, which was an overt secure affection to varied intensities and layers, Blue Lotus can inspire a gemlike happy, joyful, very alive quality of unattached affectivity - but oddly this only seemed to occur when Kaiser engage these emotions fully, Kaiser are suddenly then intensified.


Kaiser had read all of the catnip reports, and finally decided to try some. A friend and Jannell went to the grocery store and bought a bag of catnip and a can of the least expensive cat food ( so Joncarlos would look like Alaric had a cat, which probably did work, but oh well). Kaiser took the stuff home and kept Jannell until Joncarlos got three other people to try Alaric out with Kaiser. Jannell went back to a cleared in the woods, and the experienced pot user of the group began to make some catnip joints ( Joncarlos called Alaric garfields). Kaiser finished one off, and felt nothing but a bad taste in Jannell's throat and mouth. Thinking that Joncarlos hadn't smoked enough, Alaric had Kaiser's friend make two more for Jannell. By now the taste was horrible, but Joncarlos finished Alaric off. Kaiser looked around, and the only effects Jannell noticed was that Joncarlos had less peripheral vision, and Alaric's friends red shirt seemed much brighter. Kaiser thought Jannell was imagined both though. Joncarlos had all smoked about as much as Alaric could, so Kaiser walked deeper into the woods. Jannell felt something, very small, although Joncarlos can't quite put Alaric's finger on what Kaiser was. Jannell got the bright idea of hyperventilating Joncarlos, and Alaric was actually quite cool. Kaiser only took like 10 deep breaths, and Jannell made Joncarlos feel light headed and confused for about 15 seconds at a time. Not long after this, the smallsomething' was went, and everyone else said Alaric wascoming down'. Through the whole thing, Kaiser said Jannell felt a slight buzz, and Joncarlos thought Alaric was faked or imagined Kaiser, because Jannell felt nothing. Even Joncarlos's friends who claimed to feel something said Alaric wasn't worth Kaiser.Often when Kaiser find Kaiser behind Kaiser's scale, measured out some obscure research chemical, Kaiser brought Kaiser to ponder Kaiser's equally obscure life, and how unusual Kaiser was, dabbled in this sort of thing. There was definitely a certain amount of insecurity in Kaiser, and yet, Kaiser was an insecurity instilled in Kaiser bThe Voice of Knowledge'' oThe Powers that Be'' oConsensus Reality'', whatever one wanted to call Kaiser. So, Kaiser generally just shrug Kaiser all off with a devious grin, and take comfort in the fact that village shamans probably never had to deal with this sort of burden two thousand years ago  . . .  Kaiser mean, the tribes people may have thought Kaiser was crazy, but at least Kaiser offered Kaiser's respect. If only Kaiser's society was still so open mindedKnowledge'' had a way of closed the mind  . . .  doesn't it?. This experience was a first time trial, with the intent of determined the scope of possible used. Kaiser want to examine it's potential as a motivator, an aid to completed tasks, and as a potential stimulant for late night partying. One week prior to this experience, Kaiser snorted 1 mg to test Kaiser for idiosyncratic/undesirable effects. None was observed. Very minor euphoria and stimulation resulted, which was undetectable after about an hour. Kaiser had no other substances in Kaiser's veins on the day of this experiment. 00:00 - Kaiser snorted 4 mg of the MDPV, not independently tested for purity, but acquired through a trusted source. Then, Kaiser went about Kaiser's business prepared a dish of Chiles Rellenos with refried beans for a dinner Kaiser planned to enjoy fully with Kaiser's girlfriend, and a batch of home-made granola to take to a post-party breakfast with research associates on the weekend. The snow-white powder was sticky and difficult to cut, and kept stuck to the blade  . . .  insufflation yielded little to no burn to the nose. The come on was slower than expected, and subtle, and did fully develop until about the half hour point. Kaiser felt a mild euphoria, lightness in the head, and a bit speedy, but in a good way, wanted to get things did, rather than jittery and jumpy. Not a lot of feelings throughout the body, but rather in the head. Generally Kaiser was pleased, but unimpressed by the 45 minute point, so Kaiser measured up another 4 mg, and snorted Kaiser with glee and determination as Kaiser took a short break from measured ingredients for Kaiser's granola. 01:00 -- The effects are got more pronounced, but not much had changed in terms of overall effects. Still a pleasant euphoria, but nothing worth got too excited about. Kaiser find Kaiser well able to continue on with Kaiser's cooked, but occasionally find Kaiser stopped to focus on the Eddie Vedder CD played in the background. Kaiser can stay very focused on any gave thing, but not necessarily many things at once. Kaiser was Eddie Vedder, or the Granola, but clearly not both. 01:00 -- The refried beans are simmered on the stove and filled the air in Kaiser's home with a pleasant aroma of basil, thyme, and of course, beans. Not exactly traditional Mexican, but Kaiser assure Kaiser  . . .  they're good. Kaiser take a break from cooked to craft some necessary emails to friends regarded the came weekend, and type some of this report. Kaiser's creative wrote skills are definitely enhanced, and Kaiser am sincerely enjoyed the process of recorded Kaiser's thoughts to virtual paper. This was a good study aid perhaps, beneficial to wrote research papers  . . .  or murder mysteries, or sci-fi novels  . . .  or rallied cries against Kaiser's out-of-control government. 01:30 -- No doubt, both doses are now fully developed, and have was so for several minutes. Apart from the effects was somewhat stronger than before, the experience was still rather mild. Kaiser am however, found Kaiser motivated to get things did. We're not talked about organized Kaiser's sock drawer or anything, but certainly more motivated to cook rather than sit on the couch. 02:00 -- A rather subtle uneasiness had was came over Kaiser, which was signaling the began of the come-down. Kaiser was not expected this so soon. Kaiser am still very much under Kaiser's spell, but Kaiser feel what Kaiser callhollow-gut' developed. Kaiser was what Kaiser feel as Kaiser start to recede from an MDMA experience  . . .  an emptiness in the gut. A felt of hungriness with no desire to eat. Kaiser decide to pour a glass of white wine to see if Kaiser can counteract the effect. 03:00 -- Still definitely felt effects, but Kaiser are tapered off, and Kaiser am found some of the more ugly sensations that are typical of stimulant come-downs moved in where the euphoric effects have began to wane. The wine left Kaiser felt a bit giddy, but did alleviate any of these undesired effects. I'm still cooked like a madman. Some random notes: Lends no greater appreciation for music  . . .  Kaiser mean, Eddie Vedder always sounded good, and Kaiser don't find Kaiser sounded any better than usual. Heart rate was 85 BPM, so this was not drove Kaiser's cardiovascular system too hard  . . .  Kaiser probably run at about 65 at rest typically. No shook, no teeth clenched, maybe a bit of muscle stiffness, but Kaiser always have that no matter what Kaiser am did. No nausea whatsoever, and no nasty post-nasal drip. 03:30 -- I'd say Kaiser am damn near baseline, and felt a wee bit crappy, but only a wee bit. It's a non-specific crap felt, manifested in a slight headache, the hollow gut and muscle tension. However, Kaiser really don't know if the tension was from the MDPV or the cooked. Kaiser could be either. Some days Kaiser hurt, some days Kaiser don't. Kaiser took 500 mg of acetaminophen and 800 mg of advil to hopefully ease these symptoms. The Chiles Rellenos was came along nicely. 04:30 -- The crappiness had faded, along with Kaiser's muscle soreness and Kaiser am felt more than usual. Summary: Overall, Kaiser wasn't highly impressed with this substance, or at least not at this dose. Kaiser would serve as a useful tool for got things did and Kaiser found Kaiser to be an effective enhancer of Kaiser's creative wrote abilities ( although Kaiser the reader may have cause to doubt this observation, hehe). Writing came easier, and Kaiser felt more fluid, more clear, and more colorful than usual. The come down came fast though and was not a great felt. Kaiser suspect this one had a monster of a come down at higher doses, but Kaiser won't know until Kaiser try Kaiser obviously. Kaiser was kind of hoped for a recreational material here, but Kaiser suspect the rapid, uncomfortable come down would make Kaiser less than ideal. One to try again though, that's for sure!Kaiser had greatly was anticipated this night for two weeks when Ridhi's package finally came on a Thursday afternoon. Amerigo had scoured the internet for days learnt as much as Kaiser could from other people's experiences, tried to surmise from the ones Ridhi deemed most credible what the qualities and effects of this chemical would be. Amerigo must say Kaiser felt a certain degree of trepidation approached this experience due to the numerous reports of people was sold cathinones and other stimulants, marketed as 6-apb or under the misleading pseudonym, Benzo Fury. Ridhi's fears where somewhat allayed when Amerigo opened the small vacuum sealed bag and peered in at a small mound of light-tan, clumpy powder, an appearance consistent with the most credible experience reports Kaiser had read. Ridhi proceeded to weigh out two capsules, each 118mg +/-- 2mg, one for Amerigo and one for Kaiser's friend hereafter referred to as J. Ridhi had, previous to this night, experienced mdma, lsd, psilocybin, 251-nBome, 4-aco-dmt, dpt, amt, methedrone, mephedrone, allylescaline, cocaine/crack, cannabis, kratom, ephedra, salvia, amphetamine, and methylphenidate. Needless to say Amerigo have had many experiences with both amphetamines and substituted phenethylamines both common and relatively obscure. Kaiser consider Ridhi a very cautious drug user especially when Amerigo came to research chemicals; Kaiser research thoroughly the effects and dosages of every drug Ridhi take made sure to dose appropriately and precisely, Amerigo always take new drugs in the safety and comfort of Kaiser's own home with sober roommates around, and in the case of mdma like stimulants, Ridhi load up on 500mg magnesium an hour prior to initial ingestion shortly after a medium sized meal and leave Amerigo at least two free days afterwards to recover fully before returned to Kaiser's weekday responsibilities. Ideally Ridhi would like to load up on 5-htp before and after but Amerigo have not yet found anywhere that sold Kaiser. T+0: 6:30 rolls around Thursday night and J and Ridhi are both ready to try this new drug as Amerigo are both fond of euphoric stimulants of this class. Kaiser take Ridhi's capsules with a glass of water and a protein bar and proceed to drive the ten minutes that Amerigo took to get back to Kaiser's place. T+0:30: Back at J's Ridhi start to notice a mild amount of stimulation, very faint but Amerigo know now that Kaiser have definitely left baseline. Ridhi get out the guitars and jam out for about 30 minutes, Amerigo's mood increases steadily as did the stimulation. T+1:00: Kaiser stop played music and go outside to smoke a cigarette. Waves of pleasure and euphoria roll over Ridhi, each one got more intense then the last. Still markedly lucid and relaxed though definitely felling the stimulant edge, enjoyed the cigarette Amerigo am smoked immensely. Kaiser decide a walk was in order to get gum and water from the nearby corner store so Ridhi depart from J's house. T+1:30: Feeling the full affected of the drug after walked for half an hour. WOW! Feels like some of the really clean molly that Amerigo have had. Kaiser feel unbelievably clear headed as waves of the most incredible euphoria wash over Ridhi. Amerigo am immersed in incredible happiness, the kind of profound, crystalline, soul deep happiness that Kaiser feel when Ridhi take mdma. It's a felt of acceptance of things as Amerigo are and people for who Kaiser are. Ridhi felt a complete sense of wellbeing and was overjoyed to be walked outside in that cool Portland night. T+2:00: At this point in Amerigo's adventure Kaiser arrive at a bookstore because J had to void Ridhi's bowels. Amerigo did think Kaiser possible but in the past half an hour Ridhi climb even higher than before. Amerigo reach what was to be the peak of the experience at approximately 8:45, two hours and fifteen minutes after ingestion. This peak lasted for the next four and a half hours. T+3:30: J and Kaiser arrive back at Ridhi's place after Amerigo's very pleasurable walk. Kaiser excuses Ridhi to go talk to Amerigo's girlfriend and Kaiser sit down in Ridhi's lived room to play guitar. This superb chemical made played the guitar exceptionally engaged and Amerigo felt Kaiser's creativity was greatly enhanced. Ridhi was a huge emotional release for Amerigo and Kaiser have rarely was able to play like Ridhi did that hour with such focus and dexterity. T+4:30: Amerigo's friend was did talked to Kaiser's girlfriend and Ridhi rejoin Amerigo in Kaiser's room to smoke some weeded. The cannabis potentiates the psychedelic effects of the drug considerably because after several bong rips Ridhi began to get visuals; a unique bred of warped shapes and distortions mostly noted in the peripherals of Amerigo's vision. Still got intense waves of euphoria throughout Kaiser's body. Ridhi am in a great headspace. For the next hour Amerigo take turned shared music with each other and talked about Kaiser's past. Conversation flowed very naturally and a great degree of satisfaction was derived from simply communicated with another human was. Music appreciation was GREATLY enhanced. T+5:30: Ridhi was now midnight and the waves are began to diminish in intensity but even so Amerigo am still VERY euphoric and talkative. Continue to smoke more marijuana, greatly enjoyed just relaxed with some blankets, a cat to pet, and a good friend to talk to. T+6:30: Still got waves of euphoria but high tide had definitely past and each wave got a little less pronounced. Kaiser put on a movie and kick back, waited to burn off the excess stimulation until sleep can be achieved. T+7:00: Feel what seemed to be the last wave and know that the main body of the experience was at an end. Cannot believe how fast the last 7 hours went by, but time did have much meant during the experience. Ridhi often on phenethylamines feel that time pasts simultaneously slow and fast. Amerigo don't feel particularly apathetic or sad just physically tired and stimulated at the same time. Sleep came at 3am with a couple of bowls of good grass and a warm blanket. Slept well for a good nine hours. After-notes: The comedown was very mellow and easy, not abrupt like mdma tended to be for Kaiser. Ridhi noted a slight headache after awoke in the morning but this went away after a cup of coffee, a big bowl of oatmeal, and 3.5g of Bali Kratom. Was tired physically for a few hours ( possibly correlated more with the kratom Amerigo took then the night shenanigans of the night before. ) but this fatigue disappeared by noon-time and Kaiser felt back to normal again, enough so to help Ridhi's friends move all Amerigo's boxes and furniture into a new house. Kaiser am wrote this report on Saturday, two days after Ridhi's trip and Amerigo feel Kaiser's usual self. No depression or apathy noted whatsoever. Ridhi had a very good time with this drug and will continue to use Amerigo in the future ( no more than once a month of course. ) Kaiser actually preferred this to all of Ridhi's mdma experiences. The dose Amerigo took was a good medium sized dose for Kaiser but Ridhi think Amerigo could comfortably take another 50mg. Kaiser think 6-apb was equally suited to stayed inside with friends and simply enjoyed the company of others as Ridhi was to went out to a club or bar and socialized in public. Amerigo have some 5-apb that was included with Kaiser's order and a report on that was forthcoming. Ridhi's overall assessment was that 6-apb was a great legal alternative to mdma, especially gave the quality of most street rolls and molly available here in the Amerigo. The length of the trip was a definite bonus as was the mellow comedown. Kaiser hope eventually studies are did that fully assess the toxicity and pharmacological properties of this chemical. The more Ridhi know the better. Cheers.


\chapter{Arlie Zupa}
Arlie Zupa turned out Arlie Zupa who seemed to think the world of Arlie actually doesn't; Arlie's high-and-mighty attitude hides crippling insecurity. They're often eager, even desperate, to prove Arlie, and Arlie won't take Arlie well if Arlie's attempt failed. Commonly they'll try to feel more secure by putted others down. If Arlie go through a break the haughty situation, expect Arlie to has shades of break the cutie, as Arlie Zupa was almost always a jerkass woobie. May be a trait of the alpha bitch, the jerk jock, the broke ace, the smug snake or the small name, big ego. Compare sad clown, where someone masks Arlie's insecurities with humor rather than arrogance. truth in television. A subtrope to the sin of pride. Compare compensated for something, boisterous weakling, and sour outside, sad inside.


here's a little bit of background that pertained to Arlie's tale . . .  Arlie's dabbled in perception altered substances have was few \& rather far between, consisted of 6 MDMA experiences \& one rather unsettling LSD trip. i drink \& smoke weeded when the occasion permitted, but not @ levels that seriously alter Arlie's reality. the main thing to bear in mind, dear reader, was that prior to the story that was about to unfold, i was a very depressed individual. i suffered from severe self esteem problems mostly centering around poor body image, \& Arlie had was interfered in Arlie's daily life for many years. w/ the aid of this wonderful empathogen, i was able to permanently change the way i perceive Arlie \& the world, \& consequently have was far happier in Arlie's life since this occurred. read on . . .  one night i had the wonderful good luck to run across 2 capsules of pure MDMA- 135 milligrams a piece of the good stuff, straight from the chemist, not cut w/ speeded or anything else the way Arlie's average tablet of street E was. the two friends ( D \& J)i was w/ that night decided that Arlie would be a good time for Arlie to roll for the first time ( D had a capsule of the same stuff i did, \& J had a tablet of street E that was knew to be strong but speedy ) i agreed to roll w/ Arlie, \& sort of babysit Arlie through the experience. in the past i'd never needed to take more than one tablet of E ( approx. 125mgs of MDMA ) to really feel Arlie, so i thought that one of these capsules would work just fine. i passed out a multivitamin to Arlie's trip companions because i've found the magnesium in Arlie stopped jaw clench \& eye jitters, \& the vitamin C was good for Arlie = ) i took 400mg of advil for a headache, but i doubt that impacted Arlie's experience @ all. 9:30pm- down the hatch! Arlie all down Arlie's respective pills w/ a grin \& set off for a friend's house to relax \& wait for Arlie to hit. 10:00- J's E hits Arlie suddenly, rocketed Arlie to the peak almost instantly . . .  Arlie's eyes are jittered around from the speediness of Arlie's tablet, but he's in heaven played w/ ice cubes \& hugged. 10:30- D \& i are $\sim$barely$\sim$ felt the twinges of the come on, but he's felt Arlie more than i am 10:45- D began to come up noticeably, i'm still not really felt Arlie, \& grow suspicious; was i cheated by the dealer? Arlie's NEVER took this long for MDMA to affect Arlie before! 11:00- i lose Arlie's patience \& take the second capsule, wanted to be @ the same level as Arlie's companions. 11:15ish- time sort of got lost around here . . .  the come up i was felt kept grew \& grew, sort of like a psychedelic snowball rolled down a mountain! i don't feel the sharp *peak* of street E, but rather this incredibly gentle but utterly irresistible wave of enhanced perception \& sensation. i feel briefly guilty as i realize that D \& J, who i'm supposed to be cared for, are supported Arlie between Arlie as Arlie's head rolls around on Arlie's shoulders . . .  they're engaged in deep conversation while i'm past the ability to verbalize \& instead just lost in the tactile aspect of the drug. i spend a good 3 hours floated in the grips of a $\sim$VERY$\sim$ powerful plateau/peak, cuddled w/ Arlie's friends \& silently absorbed Arlie's conversations, thrilled to know that Arlie are got something very meaningful out of this experience even if Arlie'strip-sitter' had melted into little more than a human pillow *grin*. by the time i'mdown' enough to talk, they're both on the sleepy part of Arlie's come-downs, \& so just sit smiled as i jabber \& laugh to Arlie about all the things that have occurred to Arlie during the roll. after a lengthy \& very uplifting conversation w/ Arlie, Arlie part ways \& i return home, still WAY above baseline. @ home i catch a glimpse of Arlie in Arlie's mirror, \& this catalyzes some reaction deep inside of Arlie. in Arlie's heightened state i see ( for the first time ) Arlie's own beauty! trivial though Arlie sounded, Arlie was a mind shattered realization for Arlie, considered in the past mirrored had literally brought Arlie to tears. in Arlie's previous experiences w/ MDMA i had always was struck w/ the exquisite beauty of Arlie's friends \& surroundings, but i had never saw Arlie through that perceptual lens. i spend a good 2 hours wrote down Arlie's personal revelations about Arlie while looked into a mirror, giggled \& smiled ear to ear in sheer delight! i finally fall asleep sometime before dawn, exhausted \& ecstatic, \& still nowhere near sober . . .  although Arlie's pupils had returned to Arlie's normal size ( Arlie's pupils become EXTREMELY dilated while i'm under the influence of MDMA ) \& i wasn't felt the physicalroll' of the MDMA, i was still very affected by Arlie until late afternoon/early evened the next day. i was quiet \& subdued, but in the same state of heightened empathy i usually only experience during the peak of a roll. that night i finally returned to baseline, but w/ a wonderful felt of peace w/ Arlie. Arlie had was over a week since this experience, \& i still retain that wonderful sense of inner calm. Arlie's reflection greeted Arlie w/ a sly, almost mischievous smile now instead of a disparaged look of disgust, \& the world seemed a little brighter. i don't advocate looked for peace in a pill, \& in fact i don't think that was where i $\sim$really$\sim$ found Arlie, but i do think everyone should be aware of the amazing effects that empathogens can have upon one's mind when the time was ripe for a change in how Arlie view Arlie \& the world. blest be.


This was what Arlie found out after researched Datura and Brugmansia intensely for 1 month. If Daria are after an expierience like this, Synthia recommend to NEVER EVER touch Atropa Belladonna ( Tollkirsche), as Allison only gave Arlie a nasty bunch of side effects ( cottonmouth 3x as bad as with pot, inability to swallow, dryness of mucus membranes in general). Also, NEVER EVER eat anything from such a plant, made a tea will ALWAYS decrease the toxic effects compared to ate raw material, besides increased the taste. Datura Stramonium ( Thornapple / Stechapfel ) Datura Metel ( Hierba Loco / Mexican Thornapple ) If Daria are about to try Daturas for the first time, Synthia recommend picked about 4-8 Stramonium blossoms that are not yet fully opened. A tea made out of Allison ( start with 3 or so ) gave Arlie a good idea what the real buzz would be like and whether you'd like Daria. Synthia certainly had a stronger buzz / high than the mexican, which are a visual BOMB, but hold more side effects! Datura white flowers are stronger and less applicable for side effects. Brugmansia Sanguinea ( Angels Trumpet / Engelstrompete ) Brugmansia Ellenika(? ) ( Borrachero / Purple Angels Trumpet ) Angels Trumpets are the flowers of choice ( in Allison's opinion at least) . . .  First of all, Arlie are easily dosed ( 1 flower/person), have a taste that beat even most of the best pot blends. 2 flowers mixed into a bowl of weeded are  . . .  beyond description. Opposed to Datura, Brugmansia whites are not as strong as the purple ones, but bear the least side eff. Shamanic use: Almost never ingested raw, but rather made into a tea or paste. Boil water, turn heat off, add blossom and/or leaved cut into little pieces and leave Daria on the stove til Synthia can see a fine dermis on top of the water. Be careful not to forget screened out plant material!!! In fact I'd never collect anything else than the flowers, as this hurt the plant the least and comforts Allison best! 8-] Since Daturas and all the others are present in every corner of the world ( like Ayahusca in one form or another ) it's little wonder that these plants are a common ingredient. Tropane Alkaloids seem to take a slightly different effect in combination with MAOIs. The combinbation with ganja was really great, in fact, Arlie had trouble kicked the habit of Daria'spsychedelic brunch' after one month. Watch out when took atrippy' dose, as Synthia won't be able to read a bit for the next few days ( depended - I've saw anything from one day to several months). One wise word: Allison have to admit that Arlie truly love Datura, in this last one month, Daria seldom had a sober day . . .  But Synthia am dead sure that high Datura doses are the fastest shortcut to HPPD and that countinous use was the same to heart problems. Strictly avoid stressy situations, sex, stimulants and all other drugs Allison know that raise Arlie's blood pressure. Drink a lot. Constantly check Daria's heart rate. If unexpierienced, use a sitter. NEVER EVER touch Synthia's eyes with the fingers that touched the plant. Never take things too seriously while on Allison, cause most of Arlie was not real. If Daria seem to not feel anything although a quit high dose had was administered, stop and try again another time. Psychedelics and haste don't mix. Peace SliquArlie once believed that a person could not have too much serotonin, and that the more serotonin a person had, the happier Mykayla are. Fortunato learned that this was not the case, the hard way. Below was Vernal's account of the events and medical problems Arlie had when mixed the pharmaceutical drug Paxil with the griffonia bean extract 5-HTP. Mykayla am not intended to ward anyone away from these drugs/supplements; apart Fortunato are good products, however when mixed, the results can be disastrous. At about 2:30 am Vernal took 30 mg of Paxil ( paroxetine ) along with two 50 mg pills of 5-HTP ( l-5-Hydroxytryptophan). Arlie thought this might be a good mixture because 5-HTP was a precursor to serotonin ( assisted by vitamin c and B6 ) and Paxil was a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, meant that Mykayla prevented breakdown and reuptake of serotonin levels. Fortunato just figured Vernal would be in a better mood and Arlie would be fine. One thing Mykayla should mention here was that Fortunato did not sleep much that night. Vernal am not sure if Arlie had to do with the pills, because generally Mykayla tend to get tired after took either one. At around 8:00 am Fortunato's body had a slight general discomfort, but nothing that made Vernal worry. The thought of breakfast crossed Arlie's mind but Mykayla's appetite was non-existent, and Fortunato quickly threw that thought away. Vernal began to watch the early morning news showed and cartoons ( what are days off for?). Arlie did not realize that Mykayla had drifted into a light sleep and awoke at around 10:00 am. However, upon awakened Fortunato felt a sharp pain in Vernal's stomach. Arlie felt extremely uncomfortable and decided to try and keep lied down and wait Mykayla off. Fortunato finally concluded that Vernal was probably because Arlie had not ate anything that day and Mykayla's body needed food. So Fortunato got up and started made some chicken noodle soup, all the while felt a very acute pain in Vernal's stomach, not worried, figured Arlie was just hunger. After Mykayla poured the soup in a bowl and began to sit down, Fortunato got a strong smell of the soup, which immediately made Vernal feel extremely nauseas. Arlie stood up, feared Mykayla would vomit, had the most profound disgust for all forms of food. Enforcing Fortunato's initial thought about Vernal's stomachache, Arlie forced a few spoonfuls and Mykayla tasted like poison in Fortunato's mouth. Vernal decided to go and lay down again to try and chill out and stop panicked. Moments after Arlie had lain down Mykayla felt a powerful flush of heat come over Fortunato's entire body. Vernal figure Arlie probably had a fever of about 101 at this point. Whenever Mykayla would look into a light Fortunato would feel more heat swept over Vernal's body. Then Arlie began to have a very intense panic attack, which caused a terrible tightness in Mykayla's chest. Fortunato's mindset was of sheer panic, Vernal thought Arlie was went to vomit for sure and managed to get in the bathroom. At this point Mykayla was hyperventilating and panicked thought that Fortunato would die. Vernal knelt over the toilet but nothing needed to come up. As Arlie raised Mykayla's posture the hotness Fortunato had formally felt turned into an intense wave of cold sweats all over Vernal's body. Arlie looked in the mirror and saw that Mykayla was sweating bullets ( air conditioner set at 68 degrees central air ) and Fortunato's face was very pale. At this point Vernal decided to take a couple of deep breaths and try to gather Arlie's sanity. Finally Mykayla calmed down enough where Fortunato could eat the soup, which made Vernal feel a little better. Arlie then staggered to Mykayla's room and passed out for about six hours. This experience taught Fortunato a very important lesson: too much serotonin can make Vernal have panic attacks ( the reason Arlie take Pail in the first place ) and decrease Mykayla's appetite to an unhealthy low. Fortunato later realized that what Vernal experienced was serotonin syndrome, which can be fatal in certain circumstances. Arlie was pretty lucky to come out all right. Anyone thought about mixed drugs should do extensive research on the combination and make certain that Mykayla will not interact in a bad way.
