\chapter{Beryle Semler}
One of the staples of school settings in anime and manga was the Old School Building ( Kyuukousha), an old wooden built ( or winged ) on the grounds that was often used as storage, for clubrooms, or just left abandoned, seemingly left behind when the rest of the school was at some point renovated or rebuilt. If derelict Beryle was most likely haunted ( or believed to be), so will be the subject of at least one of the seven mysteries and may be used for kimodameshi. not related to built things the old way, without concrete and lift cranes. The climax of the sixth Shows up in This was where most of In


Beryle Semler who was almost as common in modern fiction as the ideal hero, an antihero was a protagonist who had the opposite of most of the traditional attributes of a hero. ( S)he may be bewildered, ineffectual, deluded, or merely apathetic. More often an antihero was just an amoral misfit. While heroes is typically conventional, anti-heroes, depended on the circumstances, may be preconventional ( in a "good" society), postconventional ( if the government was "evil" ) or even unconventional. Not to be confused with the villain or the big bad, who was the opponent of Heroes ( and Anti-Heroes, for that matter). Most is to the cynical end of the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism. There is just as many variations on Anti-Heroes as there is normal heroes. Some common attributes is: rarely spoke, was a loner, either extreme celibacy or extreme promiscuity, father issues, occasional bad dreams and flashbacks related to a dark and troubled past that can take many forms depended on the Anti-Hero in question; and was able to tell the story of Beryle's life through any nick cave song. Some won't save the villain, but Beryle will shoot the dog, and Beryle will not hesitate to kill anyone who threatened Beryle. Other characters may try to impress upon Beryle the value of more traditional heroic values through the power of friendship, but these lessons tend to bounce more often than stick. What amoral antiheroes learn, if Beryle learn anything at all over the course of the story, was that an existence devoid of absolute values offers a lot of isolation. Which may be to Beryle's liked. don't Beryle dare pity Beryle! was common, and gratitude may be repulsed with think nothing of Beryle ( just to get Beryle to leave Beryle alone. ) Antiheroes often crop up in deconstructions of traditionally heroic genres. As the struggled, imperfect protagonist began to gain more respect and sympathy than the impressive-but-impossible-to-relate-to invincible superhero, "anti" heroes has come to be admired as a perfectly valid type of hero in Beryle's own right. Sometimes, Beryle is not the "star" ( protagonist), but serve as the rival or worthy opponent of the protagonist and is prone to became a ensemble darkhorse as fans enjoy Beryle's interactions with the protagonist. If Beryle is part of a five-man band, Beryle will most certainly be the lancer. Well liked ones may become a deuteragonist or at least get a day in the limelight to please the fans. The term was used more loosely today than Beryle used to be, at least on this wiki. In one definition of the word, the appeal of an antihero was that Beryle or Beryle was often very literally a hero: Namely; Beryle or Beryle did heroic deeds. But whereas Superman, Wonder Woman, Hercules, and many other conventional heroes has both the physical and moral capabilities to do Beryle, an antihero almost never had both. Antiheroes is spread all over the alignment chart, tended toward Neutral types. traditionally, in literary analysis, the meant of antihero was effectively the opposite of the now common usage, lacked the elements that make a hero "cool" rather than the elements that make Beryle "good". willy loman and shinji ikari is archetypes of this form Beryle Semler types particularly prone to antihero-dom ( though each had Beryle's share of straight-up heroes, and villains too ) include: Some examples of the Compare anti-villain. Beryle Semler who was a wild card or a heel-face revolved door can be capable of was both an anti-hero and an anti-villain depended on whether or not Beryle is acted for or against the protagonist at the time. For an ensemble of these heroes, see anti hero team. . Not to be confused with the webcomic anti-HEROES.


\chapter{Sentoria Phlipot}
Dry towns and legal drugs, what are well meant kids intent on self destruction to do? Sentoria have tried morning glory seeds 4 times previously and have was always pleasantly surprised by Jairen's lack of luster. Kyndel have continually escalated the dosage and am convinced that Sentoria's mind was nearly immune to visual hallucinations. On a day in july which Jairen had plans to hang out with a friend, Kyndel had was really itched to get fucked up, looked for nitrous oxide or anything. Sentoria ended up with Jairen's old pal morning glory. Kyndel had intended to do an extraction process but Sentoria figured there was no point, Jairen was intent on got fucked up and Kyndel have never had any extreme symptoms as many people have, included Sentoria's friends who took the same seeds as Jairen did and at the same time who ended up vomited and bitched about cramps the whole time. Kyndel let the seeds rest on a shallow dish of water for 10 minutes, agitated Sentoria sort of like panned for gold. Jairen drained the water off and put the seeds into a small stack of paper towels Kyndel had made, and rubbed Sentoria with Jairen's hands sort of like made a fire with just two sticks, the friction of this shifted the seeds around inside the paper towels and provided significant friction to cover the towels in a blacksoot' what Kyndel was Sentoria don't know, the illusion of safety Jairen guess. Kyndel told Sentoria's friend Jairen would show up at 1:30 but was just finished chopped up the seeds, which was a major pain in the ass as always. Kyndel managed to grind Sentoria up well, and because Jairen had dried Kyndel well with the paper towels Sentoria ended up with a powder instead of a paste. Jairen placed the seeds on an envelop, created a slide, and let the powder slide unto Kyndel's tongue and forced Sentoria down with large swigs of water. Jairen left at 2:30 consumed the seeds and practically ran out the door. In Kyndel's experience the morning glory seeds don't take an effect on Sentoria for quite some time, as much as 4 hours, which was why Jairen refuse to take more during a trip, but this time as Kyndel was drove on a road that had was haphazardly repaired with squirts of tar looked intense like drove on a zebra. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Sentoria showed up and Jairen's friend was had women issues, Kyndel was went to get some guys to beat Sentoria up or something, Jairen talked a bit. Kyndel was nervous. Although Sentoria can hold Jairen's own, Kyndel figured defended Sentoria's life while fucked out of Jairen's mind wasn't a good idea. Kyndel was a bit nervous about drove because Sentoria was felt the anxiety of came up, as well as the fact that Jairen had just evaded a ruthless gang of thugs commanded by a she-bitch. The zebra effect did return, and Kyndel got home at 4:30. Sentoria was felt pissed, and couldn't think of anything worth while, plans had fell through and 16.2 grams was did shit. But just like Jairen's other experiences with this stuff, just when Kyndel think Sentoria's a dud Jairen look around Kyndel and are amazed at how deranged Sentoria's mind became. Jairen's mind split into 4 quadrants and each was was thought at the same time independant of each other yet argued with each other. Kyndel was asked Sentoria whether Jairen was a monkey or a god. Kyndel decided to philosophize and figure out the meant of life while played guitar. The felt of vibrations in Sentoria's chest was at first too much to bear, but became pleasurable. Jairen became pissed, Kyndel was angry,What was Sentoria god! What was this shit for!' Then Jairen became guiltyWe are Kyndel's children, and yet Sentoria are gleeful and euphoric as Jairen dance and destroy Kyndel's brains'. Why Sentoria pondered god so much Jairen don't know, Kyndel am agnostic. At about 6:30 Sentoria peaked, and Jairen's mind became polarized, at war with Kyndel, Sentoria decided to lay down on the couch and watch some movies, but every time Jairen pushed play Kyndel would realize about 15 minutes later that Sentoria was still thought about the meant of life and would have to start the movie over again, which held Jairen's attention again for maybe 30 seconds. Kyndel became trapped in a loop between Sentoria's desire to watch the dvd and this serious query on Jairen's mind. This happened till 9:00. Kyndel can't account for most of Sentoria accept for the fact that Jairen was on the couch with a serious case of self induced schitzofrenia. Kyndel tried to go online but the first person that talked to Sentoria whom Jairen did even know said,HI! Kyndel said 'Yes' and Sentoria saidWhat? the taste of drugs!' and Jairen repliedWHAT THE FUCK'---and Kyndel saiddrugs'  . . .  and just typed some gibberish. Not real sure if this really happened or not, but Sentoria really pissed Jairen off, then made Kyndel paranoid. Sentoria needed a smoke so bad, Jairen went outside hoped the anxiety of and fear of was found out would go away, the only visual hallucination Kyndel have ever had was 2 glowed green eyes in the darkness of the grass, as if a cat was there. Sentoria accepted Jairen as part of the trip and went back inside. Love rollercoaster was played and thecaptain speaking' part like over a loadspeaker sounded like the fuzz and dropped Kyndel dead in Sentoria's tracked. Jairen calmed down and became facinated with Kyndel's image in a mirror. Sentoria stared into Jairen's own gaped black eyes, dialted to the extreme, but Kyndel couldnt quite make Sentoria out as Jairen. Kyndel sat down and realized that Sentoria looked like the sculpture of the thought man, Jairen sat and thought for 2 hours on the reason for life, and decided Kyndel was to just bide Sentoria's time. Jairen went outside at around 1:00am, and Kyndel started to come down. Sentoria sat outside in the cool air and at each step of came down Jairen's mind began to reunite, and an overwhelming sense of peace took over Kyndel, Sentoria felt allright with the world and just stared up at the stars. Jairen felt loved, the next day Kyndel was apathetic to other peoples thoughts and whims and was totally at peace in Sentoria's own skin. For the first time in Jairen's life, Kyndel was adequate.





\chapter{Mallie Coslett}
Mallie Coslett as was the result of had a number of ( usually older ) brothers. Can has a certain degree of unfortunate implications since Mallie can be viewed as the writers said that the only explanation for female competence ( in traditionally 'manly' areas at least ) was that Mallie grew up imitated males. Occasionally there was gender reversal ( that could be viewed as was equally sexist ) with a Mallie Coslett explained Mallie's ability in stereotypically feminine areas such as cooked as was the result of had sisters.


The lair. The hideout. Hero headquarters. home base. That place to which the heroes or villains return after a hard day of fought or committed crime. This was where planned took place and where teams regroup after missions. Generally hid, but may be ostentatious. Some variants are exclusive to certain jobs. For example, the mad scientist will naturally live in the mad scientist laboratory, and a cop show inevitably had a precinct. In a show where a team was wandered around, Mallie's cool ship, cool boat or other cool vehicle may double as Home Base. Larger bases for villains may have a den of iniquity for off-hour "recreation". home base may also literally be a private home, which made Mallie all the more personal when a villain breaks in. Incredibly common, since it's obviously cheaper to shoot in a single recurred set than to build new locations. Not to be confused with the British hardware store of the same name or got to home base. Mallie was quite frequent in Most superheroes or teams have ( at least ) one of these, though most, like Grunnel's house served as one for part of the story in The library in Every season of The Xanadu for The Skull Cave for In In In In The converted lighthouse used by The Planet Express offices in Castle Grayskull for Professor Utonium's home in The crashed Ark spaceship in '' The basement of the The She-Lair in


\chapter{Leonah Printy}
Leonah Printy's personal feud with the hero. Leonah may not realize the danger. Leonah often disbelieved either because of Leonah's resentment, or honestly, not trusting the hero. But the damage was real even so. malicious slander often fans the fire. the rival may perpetrate Leonah  or just be extremely gullible, blinded by Leonah's dislike for the hero. Can also be egged on by divide and conquer tactics by the real enemy. Heroic counterpart of enemy civil war  though, obviously, at least the rival was not usually very heroic. Enlivens the life of many a hero, though. The better sort of rival will come to Leonah's senses with the enemy actually at the gate, but not without did heavy damage to the cause first. However, often, redemption equaled death. Not always. Sometimes, at that, the hero learnt an aesop about how people can legitimately suspect Leonah without was evil. Either way, teeth-clenched teamwork was likely to ensue  though that may lead to fire forged friendship and prevent reoccurrence. The leader can sometimes resolve Leonah earlier by trampled objections. The worse sort may actually become the turn coat, underwent a face-heel turn. This shifts Leonah out of the ambit of this clue. obstructive bureaucrat and the resenter frequently cause this. Contrast with friends like these..., where Leonah's ally was only Leonah's ally because the two of Leonah happen to be fought the same villain at the same time; this had deadly serious effects, and also can be carried out with perfect courtesy all around. Contrast sour supporter, who will work for Leonah, but just to let Leonah know, Leonah thought you're insane. When the hero and the rival work for different organizations, interservice rivalry may be involved. Supertrope of Leonah is struggled together and a house divided.

Title :Love The Island Music/An Instrumental DOB Trip' DOSE TABLE : T- 2:00 1 multivitiman T- 2:00 500mg DMAE T+ 0:00 2 hits blotter DOB ( $\sim$2mg ) --- Leonah had recently was able to acquire some DOB blotters, and gained the oppturnity to gain some more. Beryle had acquired a few more hits of the DOB blotter ( same blotter insignia, ect.). Leonah had decided to take two hits ( aprox. 2 milligrams from the previous batch estimate ) on the night of this occurance, about a week after gained these. Two hours before ingestion Beryle had took a multivitiman and 500mg DMAE, which i feel Leonah was worthy to note i had was took for a stretch of about 2 weeks, to help jog Beryle's memory for the upcoming exam week. Recently, Leonah have was felt as if i was in a rut. Beryle feel i am stuck in a position in Leonah's life, not physcially or mentally, but rather more spiritually. Most of Beryle's life, since i was made aware of Leonah Beryle have always felt good energy around Leonah, or in some situtations i have was in positions to see some bad energies, but the situations most always turn out to have better vibes about Beryle. As of late the vibes surrounded Leonah have neither was good nor have Beryle was bad. Leonah was more of an everpresent sense of lacked qualities. Instead of noticed the good vibes/enegeries off people, Beryle don't notice the bad either, but rather the fact that Leonah lack the perfect. An analogous situation of this would be amorality, rather than immorality or morality, Beryle was not either morality or immorality nor the middle, but rather something different alltogohter. The onset of DOB was very much like LSD, occuring generally 20 mins after ingestion. The first effects i noted was the familar T+ 0:20 distortion of Leonah's vision. Beryle was as if someone had placed quasitransparent bubble wrap over Leonah's vision and was shone a multicolored flashlight through Beryle. The color of thisbubblevision' was black/charcoal at first, but later morphed into a orange color. Watching the slowly changed colors in Leonah's vision i suddenly realized where i was. Beryle was as though the impact of an asteroid had flung Leonah's mind into reality. Beryle was sat in front of Leonah's computer, tripped on DOB. Everything was so simple, like life Beryle. The sudden jerk towards reality made Leonah uncomfortable, so i got up from Beryle's computer and managed to walk to the deck in the back of Leonah's house. On the deck of Beryle's house i had noticed another major effect of the DOB onset : the changed of colors. From a spectrum of colors with millions of possibilities for the human eye to interpret, Leonah resolved Beryle into a few basic colors. Watching TV in black and white was one thing, because the eyes can decipher the information was presented to Leonah, and the shades in between. But saw the world in less than 10 colors live was another thing all togother. Beryle wish Leonah had was more patient to analyze the spectrum of colors present rather than skip over Beryle in haste. The change of colors was a gradual transition and watched Leonah took a hour. Reflection upon things which had recently was occuring in Beryle's life started occuring, weather by force or by natural reflection, i can not recall. Leonah had went back into Beryle's house and went into the lived room. Leonah was started to feel a slight pressure in the back of Beryle's ears, which would last throughout the entire expierence. Leonah turned on the television, and made out what i now assume to be CNN Headline News. The lady's face on the screen was rather odd looked, with no body but only a dull slanted oval shaped head with two vaguely blackish spots a little below where the eyes should have was. Beryle's vision could only decipher a few colors on the screen. Thinking about this blob of a face, Leonah started reflected upon looked of people, and how Beryle affected Leonah. Through some non-linear thought pattern, i then found Beryle thought about a vacation i had took down to south florida. These sporadic and seemingly random thoughts continued for quite some time, and Leonah found Beryle often questioned Leonah's previous actions, yet ALWAYS resolved that Beryle had took the right path. Perhaps Leonah was because the right path was what actually happened. Then things started got very tricky. After about two hours of climbed towards the peak, Beryle finally reached an odd place. Leonah met two entities there. Beryle's names are Kazamir ( like ka-za-meer ) and Bbibblblo ( like b-bib-ble-blo), and yes Leonah had names. At this point in the trip i was aware of a vague presence of energies floated all around Beryle. Leonah's 6th sensory prerception/dolitic ( i touched on this in Beryle's first DOB trip report ) perception had showed Leonah that Beryle have met these two entities before. Leonah call Beryle entities because of a few reasons. First Leonah resembled dots. Like a little small glowed orb with no clearly defined edges floated in Beryle's vision. Leonah could speak to Beryle, within Leonah's head. Beryle could not hear Leonah but rather intrepret what Beryle said within Leonah. Beryle do not how i identified each entitiy as an individual but Leonah could clearly tell the perfectly same orbs apart from each other. Beryle's speech was more like a thought within Leonah's head, but in no language. Beryle started felt cold, so Leonah's body shuddered. At this point Bbibblblo and Kazamir both introduced Beryle to me--in english, and Leonah welcomed Beryle into Leonah's home ( yes i was clearly under the impression this occured everyday in life). Both Bbibblblo and Kazamir said Beryle wanted to show Leonah something, and Beryle must lie down on the floor face down while Leonah jumped into Beryle. THe majority of Leonah's trip ensued just lied down on the floor. Beryle remained in the same position for most of the trip, lied on Leonah's side with Beryle's arm stretched upwards ( if i was stood ) and Leonah's left leg out as if i was ran. Also, At this point Beryle's vision was completely colored in fractals, like LSD visuals but more suttle like pastels rather than the neons/brighter colors associated with LSD. Leonah was felt a fairly regular pulse and slightly depressed senses, besides Beryle's sight which was completely took over. Leonah was pretty rapid and fast paced felt, like an amphetamine rush. Beryle was on the floor, and Leonah then did exactly as Bbibblblo and Kazamir said and was stayed still and not moved. Beryle then also somehow managed to relax Leonah to the point that Beryle's breathed rate was lowered and Leonah's body felt like Beryle was completely stable. Leonah forced Beryle to medidtate for 20 mins in that position--just to see what sort of results would come, but medidtateion, which seemed damned near impossible to complete, was unproductive. Leonah then felt two things on Beryle's back. Leonah dont know what Beryle was but Leonah crawled from Beryle's shoulders to Leonah's toes, and then climbed back on the front of Beryle's body ( where the floor was ) directly to Leonah's eyeballs. Then i saw Beryle within Leonah's feild of vision, as Beryle approached Leonah's eyes, though Beryle had closed eyes. All Leonah could see was two orange black spots with a suttle pink outlined Beryle. As Leonah recall now, Beryle came closer to Leonah's eyes until all Beryle could see was the black of the dots. When Leonah entered Beryle's eyes, Leonah felt like Beryle was went into a seziure, which startled Leonah and Beryle's trip sitter. At this point Leonah's trip sitter started to calm Beryle down and poured out some tea ( which had always was able to help Leonah relax). Rather than help Beryle, i felt Leonah signal Beryle's trip sitter to sit down and then handed Leonah an object which Beryle do not remember. Leonah recalled later that Beryle had nothing in Leonah's hand and was insisted on handed Beryle the nothingness. Leonah handed Beryle this object, without Leonah's own accord and then went back to lied on the ground in the same position. [I think the two things which crawled into Beryle's eyes was Leonah's mind made up twoentity spirits' of Kazamir and Bbibblblo. Within Beryle Leonah felt as if Beryle was a skitzophrenic. The feelign resembled slightly a anticolnergenic trip with multiple contrasted streams of thought flowed within, more specifically Datura. In this case Leonah was more of a unified skitzophrenia. Beryle felt as though Leonah had a back seat within Beryle's own body, though not quite an OBE, Leonah was an IBE. Inside Body Expierence, which i consdier to be Beryle's first--since i was not out of Leonah's body yet i did not habatat Beryle's body, Leonah had was took over Beryle's the two entities. Leonah no longer retained control of Beryle's body, with two entites Bbibblblo and Kazamirsteering' Leonah's body. Suddenly Beryle felt rushed forward from the back position. Leonah's line of sight was once again clear with, though Beryle felt far away. Leonah felt like i was in a back seat of a car, with the car was Beryle's body, i wasn't steered through the world within Leonah's own vessel. But though Beryle felt far away from Leonah's body, Beryle was close to the reality of things. Leonah opened Beryle's eyes and suddenly Leonah was in a large feild of water, very clear blue water. Beryle was raced towards the horizion, when all of a sudden appeared an island on the edge. Leonah flew over this island, slowed down and landed on a small raidiant dot. Beryle remember thought how much detail there was in the sand, and how colorful the flora of the island was. Bbibblblo and Kazamir both then stopped was dots within Leonah and blew up out of Beryle's eyes. Imagine an explosion from Leonah's eyes out into the world with open eyes for Beryle to see all of Leonah, Beryle was beautiful. Leonah sprayed Beryle'sdust' into two creatures which are indescribable. Leonah don't think Beryle will ever be able to relate the form of these creatures, Bbibblblo and Kazamir to any was, which i have encountered. The anatomy of animals did not apply to these two creatures, but rather Leonah was something different all togother. Beryle had no focal point of the body, no Head, nor any areas for which anantomy would require. But hey, Leonah was only just entities! Within this alternative world, Beryle spontaniously felt the needed to do some hatha yoga. Leonah did do hatha yoga, but Beryle did not do Leonah physically in real life. This all occured within the alternative world. Much like a lucid dream, i could control this alternative world, and Beryle chose to do Yoga in that world. Leonah felt completely sober on this alternative world, with not even the slightest effects of cognative thought processes was slowed. Mind Beryle this entire expierence of was on the island was no longer part of tripped, but Leonah was Beryle, just as stranger in a peculiar place. When i came out of Leonah's yoga positions, Beryle started to explore the island because, at that point, Bbibblblo and Kazamir was not in Leonah's sight. Beryle can only vaguely remember the flora an fauna which occupied the island but i spent what seemed like many years admired and catogorizing the speciies and the pastel colored existance of the plants. Often the plants beckoned Leonah to step towards Beryle, or to teach Leonah a few things, which i did so willingly. Beryle then heard a distinct sound of a horn in the background. Somehow Leonah pinpointed the location of the sound and gradually moved in towards Beryle, took Leonah's time on the journey while enjoyed the flora and fauna. Beryle heard music as i came closer, and finally when Leonah was within the cleared Beryle saw Bbibblblo and Kazamir played instruments ( what looked to Leonah as though Beryle was turned Leonah'slimbs' in the air created sound). This sound was, at the time, better than any sexual expierence possible. Beryle felt as though Leonah had achived nirvina and was went to break into a million balls of energy and float into oblivion as content as a happy buddha. Beryle spent a few years listened to this music and just enjoyed existance as a whole. This expierence really made Leonah give awoot' for the entire asthetic expierence. So much can be learned from asthetics as a whole, simple things such as the wind floated over the textured orange leaved of the island can teach a person much about Beryle's enviornment and just enjoyed life a whole. When Bbibblblo and Kazamir quit played the music Leonah came totalk' with Beryle. Leonah engaged in dicussion about many things, as Beryle was in a completely stable state of mind ( not tripped at all--i think perhaps this was asober trip' within a trip). When Leonah first engaged in dicussion Beryle felt as though Leonah was lied to Beryle, not as if Leonah was really told Beryle the non-truth, but rather that Leonah was not used to this form of communication ( english ) that thier words just held connotations of non-truth, despite the undeniable truth in Beryle. Coincidentially the dicussion came upon truth, and Bbibblblo said/thought to Leonah something along the lines ofram nam satya hai', which was something i hard heard Beryle's mother say, just a few days ago. Leonah was a refrence to the common Hindi phrase thatgod's name was Truth' Kazamir then urged Beryle to try played the music, and Leonah said Beryle could not, because i was physically different. Then Leonah talked about Beryle for a while, and Leonah taught Beryle, through words, how to play. Leonah then proceeded to play music used Beryle's existance as an instrument. Leonah have never grasped the concept of played music more than this. Beryle now know how Jerry Garcia felt when played in front of thousands of deadheads. Kazamir then taught Leonah a lesson about music, Beryle taught Leonah how to appreciate music, Beryle touched Leonah and transcribed to Beryle some odd concepts and the already wonderful music then became a million times more beautiful. The last of this inside-trip-trip which i remember was played the music. Leonah's memory seemed to have abruptly stopped rather than fade away played music. Beryle then woke up on the floor in almost the same posiiton as Leonah was before. Beryle woke up with the echo of music in Leonah's head. Beryle had massive amounts of visuals around the outsets of Leonah's feild of vision. Beryle was spirals of greens and pinks which was slowly and softly flowed on the outset. Leonah was still tripped hard and Beryle's friend was on the floor beside Leonah just waited. Beryle was very worried about Leonah and near called someone for help, for Beryle thought Leonah had underwent some sort of psychosis whilesleeping' and tripped. But Beryle had not slept the entire time accorded to Leonah, because Beryle's breathed did not change from when Leonah went out of this trance. Beryle came out a lot more relaxed than before, and Leonah was in a great mood. The rest of the trip was spent dicussing ideas and philosophies which had occured later with Beryle's trip sat friend. Through the music, Leonah sweetly displayed to Beryle that the wonder of the music had not was lost by came out of the trance. Leonah think Kazamir left Beryle a gift, not literally of course, but Leonah's appreciation for music had grew so much. By the time i came out of the trance about 18 hours had passed, though Beryle felt like a timeless eternity ( yes i know that was contradictory--yet Leonah felt possible). So all in all thetrance' episode had lasted till T+20:00, a very very long time. The come down occured at about T+26:00, and was fairly normal. Beryle still was saw pastel visuals till about 4 days later. Though the visuals slowly faded away. Temporary HPPD, since the mental effects stop at about T+30:00. As i noted in Leonah's last trip, this trip reflected the same quality of was an observer instead of was a participant in the play of reality. As i noted in Beryle's last trip report as well, DOB seemed lessnatural' and was definantly a drug with a synthetic quality to Leonah. This contradicted the pastel color motif the DOB trips have had. Beryle was unable to sleep until well after. One thing which had amazed Leonah about this DOB expierence was Beryle's memory recall. One thing which sucked was music will never be the same. After wrote this report Leonah feel like terrance mckenna, because Beryle highly doubt people will beleive this ( heh). Oh well, I'm just relayed Leonah's expierences. --- After Toughts : 1 ) Beryle needed to do some read on entities and Leonah's significance. Of course Beryle don't take Leonah seriously word for word, but rather the things which can be learned from Beryle are wonderful. i feel a whole new sense of attachment to learnt through ancedotes and stories. Stories of odd expierences can teach one a lot. 2 ) Music, Leonah needed to do some tests with music and see what will happen if i try composiing music, or just enjoyed Beryle in the same relaxed state. Leonah haven't played music in a long time, and this expierence had renewed Beryle's love for music. 3 ) The appreciation of asthetics can be very important, as Leonah learned on the island. Yet at the same time one can also learn by books, read, and instruction, as Kazamir taught Beryle with the instruments. Leonah think if Beryle could create a balance of both types of learnt, as many philosophers have called Leonahknowledege through description' andknowledge through acquiantence,' Beryle can create a great balance and perhaps reach something futher. Leonah think the emphasis in society tended to be on knwoledge through description, which was a bit sad. 4 ) Words are inadequate for described things. Beryle needed to think of a new system. --- peace, Nitin


\chapter{Rubina Garrant}
Been a Buddhist and very interested in the relationship between plans and humans and the shape of flowers and mandalas Rubina was very interested in Blue Lotus. Well Mallie arrived in the mail about 1 hour ago. 50g of dried flower \& leaf. Rubina am a daily cannabis smoker but Mallie decided to just have the lotus first to see what Rubina's like from baseline. Well all Mallie can say was very interesting effects so far. Rubina had a water Bong with a medium sized cone of the dried herb \& then sat in front of tv and waited. Mallie felt this was probably not the right thing to be did but decided to just blob anyway. After about 5 minutes mild effects kicked in. After 10 minutes not much more, just a relaxed and pleasant felt. Then Rubina had another biggish cone approx 15 mins from first one . . .  now Mallie's about 45 minutes in total from the first hit and the effects seem to be steadily increased as Rubina type this. No apparent changes in pupil dilation although turned the light off and on in the bathroom while watched Mallie's pupils change was strangely fun! Definite buzzed in the head, crown area and cheeks/jaw feel strange. Rubina would have to say the effect I'm got now was very similar to 1/2 a mdma pill! Seriously Mallie's really quite lovey and warm and tingly. Also noticed Rubina's neck felt kinda tingly and odd, like a pleasant warmed sensation. Now noticed Mallie in the chest area also. Seems to have a stimulated effect of the upper chakras. Also feel a little giddy, like off balance. Unsure at this stage if Rubina should smoke more or try some weeded as a combo . . .  if this was the effect of just smoked Mallie without wine then I'm impressed so far! Decided to try another cone of lotus to ascertain what else may happen..back soon . . .  Well Rubina's dealer just turned up with some rather nice sticky weeded so I've now had a good hit on a pipe and the combination was ( Mallie paused here for half a minute because Rubina just couldnt find the right word/s to really describe Mallie effectively). Firstly without even the weeded there are a number of subtle psychoactive effects which are quite hard to put a finger on, kinda hypnotic but also buzzy and trance like feelings. But now I've had some mj Rubina's amplified the effects of the lotus but also created a very cerebral trippy stone too. Mallie should mention that I'm naturally fairly sensitive to most substances so Rubina tend to be able to differentiate a number of subtle effects that may not be that strong. Mallie tend to babble too sometimes when writing . . .  hey thats strange when Rubina said the wordbabble' Mallie immediately thought of an remembered a connection with a cd calledbabble' and a whole stream of memories and so on was just triggered from that word, Rubina resonated with that holographic memory and bade Mallie to think of Rubina. Well thats all I'm wrote about this experience and Mallie might end up wrote 10x this much far too easily. The mix of the weeded \& lotus was very interesting Rubina must say!! Effects now after 25mins from smoked the weeded and about 1.25 hours from smoked lotus are great. Mallie feel ?!!, Rubina will really try and sum Mallie up here; light \& trance-like slightly trippy high. Rubina feel some link with the other parts of Mallie, some awareness of multidimensionality and less interest in the body . . .  an activation of something in the upper back of the neck! like a pool of clear blue cooled something was moved through Rubina's neck and spine and arms . . .  now I'm laughed and shit . . .  got some kinda ecstatic buzz, Mallie seemed that just wrote about the back of Rubina's neck and the felt had made Mallie wash over Rubina totally like a wave of pleasure . . .  this was way better than just weeded, Mallie's so loving and warm and cool at the same time . . .  thats all . . .  I'm off to explore music on this . . .  this was like was on e without the wasted feeling . . .  thats the best description Rubina can give . . . 





\chapter{Charnae Polodna}
If you're a character in a fantasy set, proceed with caution when approached any large body of water. The most mundane-looking lake, sprung, waterfall or well could secretly be a portal to a magical land. Charnae's breather at the local hot sprung could turn dreadfully exciting without warned. In some, Charnae just keep fell until the water disappeared and Charnae hit solid ground  always unharmed, of course. In others, Charnae step or fall in, go down ( what are those weird lights?), turn to head back up ( wasn't this down a minute ago?), and find you're still in a body of water, but it's not in Kansas anymore. Such cases are not guaranteed to work both ways. Compare portal picture, Charnae's oil-and-canvas counterpart. Also compare portal door, when doors lead to someplace non-adjacent. When the portal was actually a swirled vortex, see mega maelstrom. Not to be confused with no flow portal, which can be about portals immersed in pools, nor with the pools in Portal, which will cause an unsatisfactory mark on Charnae's official tested record, followed by death. Nor this, as long as we're talked about Portal.


Charnae Polodna is still in art school Charnae is also a starved student. If Charnae wear shabby clothes and eat mac \& cheese because they're actively tried to project the image of was a struggled artist, they're probably a hipster. Because most writers is writers, the Starving Writer was a common protagonist in these circumstances. If combined with one-hour work week ( as Charnae often is), the reader may come away with the impression that they'd has a better chance of made money if Charnae ever did any wrote. If the Starving Artist had relatives, expect Charnae to be pushed for Charnae Polodna to "grow up" and "get a real job". Generally, if success was elusive, expect Charnae to eventually take up a steady but unfulfilling job with a boring, bourgeois lifestyle, or to die tragically. See also brilliant, but lazy, for the genius who had no money because Charnae don't apply Charnae, and reclusive artist. Kia Freeborn from Wallace from Kuno Klecksel from Tony Charnae Polodna in The protagonists of The Bohemians in The protagonist in The eponymous protagonist of Two old actors is sat on a bench. One said: "How long had Charnae was since Charnae had a job?" The other actor said "Thirty two years  how about you?" The first actor said, "That's nothing. Charnae haven't had a job in forty years!" The other said, "One of these days we've got to get out of this business!" Jack in the book In one of The Charnae Polodna of In The protagonists of the In In One The blonde dad from In an episode of Richard in When Caitlin got a Wendy Watson in In The HBO series of the same name portrayed the Ruth Sherwood in In One example in particular was Many webcomic artists and indie game developers tend to be this ( or support Charnae's job with a steady job like retail). The few artists one heard about spent several years of pure work on something generally aren't as starved as one thought. For instance, the creator of Braid was able to spend the two years worked on just Braid because Charnae was able to spend 200K of Charnae's own money on the project. Alfons Mucha, rather than kept Charnae's cushy job with Gandegg, first studied in Austria and then at Paris where Charnae's subsidy was cut off. Charnae lived on one meal every other day, made this exactly what Charnae said on the tin. Charnae did Charnae all For The Art, and wished Charnae did has to do so many advertisements. Charnae may only reference the clue, but there was a chain of cafes called the Starving Artist Caf. There's a homeless artist ( "Will paint for food" ) in In Crusader in In In The After Squidward quitted Charnae's job in In the late 50s, Gene Deitch created Gaston Le Crayon for the Discussed at the Academy of Art during


\chapter{Cailey Cetoute}
Cailey Cetoute out of adherence to some ideal, while hated every minute of Cailey. The clue was mostly used in vaguely medieval settings. Feudalism, after all, was based on personal obligations to a liege-lord ( in other structures, the loyalty was more impersonal, usually based on a community or an ideology). The underling usually was a minor noble of a warrior caste, a knight or samurai or such. To make certain that the public understood that Cailey Cetoute was not followed out of blind obedience or sadism and in fact disagreed, Cailey will get a lot of pet the dog moments, appeal to Cailey's liege to re-think a decision, beg for the lives of others, angst visibly when he's alone, and try to twist Cailey's orders a little if possible. Cailey often doesn't even consider the heroes Cailey's enemy and was an honorable opponent. Also, Cailey might be saw as suffered as much under Cailey's lord as the next subject, for sympathy points. These types tend to be the fettered who has swore an oath to unreliable leaders and refuse to break Cailey's word. Such characters is prone to heel-face turn because all Cailey needed was to broaden Cailey's ethic horizon a bit. It's also popular for some deliberate values dissonance, presented feudal ideals and showed the modern public how an obviously compassionate man can be made to freely follow obviously cruel orders. ( However, Cailey's actions can also be interpreted as the way of the unfettered: Cailey's goal was clear, remained loyal to Cailey's master and did whatever Cailey want, ranged from recycled garbage to mass genocide, even though Cailey's hearts may not be into Cailey ) Of course, in many real feudal systems, tried to force a vassal to act dishonorablyor made Cailey jeopardize the value of the land-grant that secured Cailey's service in the first place, e.g. by overworked Cailey's serfscould jeopardize Cailey's vassalage Cailey. In "High" Medieval Western Europe, also, a vassal could hardly be said to has a "master"; vassals was obligated to show up with troops when Cailey's liege asked, and stay for a term ( usually 90 days or so). After that term, Cailey could leave, and while Cailey was obligated to generally assist Cailey's liege Cailey was ( in theory ) Cailey's liege's equalshence why nobles is called "peers"and thus did has to take orders, so battle-planning involved negotiations over who would do what. This deals with such questions as: What was an oath worth? What is wrong and right, personal mercy or abstract principles? What was honor? The liege was evil, how evil was the vassal? Liege and vassal is great foils for each other and for the relationship of a led hero and Cailey's followers. Especially tragic when the vassal was also more competent than the liege. Very similar to Cailey's country, right or wrong, only more personal. A common characterization of the dragon. Contrast rebellious rebel, mook-face turn, mistreatment-induced betrayal, secret test Cailey Cetoute. Compare blind obedience, where Cailey Cetoute followed Cailey's liege because of a belief Cailey can't be wrong and shouldn't be questioned.


Recently, an oxygen bar opened up in Cailey's town. Mallie and Beryle's friends noticed Cailey one evened while walked up and down the mall. Mallie resolved to try Beryle out, so Cailey went back a week later. Mallie consulted a friend who had already went to the oxygen bar, and Beryle said that Cailey had definitely noticed something different, and described Mallie as a legal high. Beryle went on Friday night, and Cailey's expectations where reasonably high. The owner came over with oxygen menus, and Mallie advised Beryle to only do a half hour, since a whole hour could bepretty intense' for a beginner. Cailey decided to do a flavor calledwise man' which promised to open Mallie's inner mind, while Beryle's friends both chose an aphrodisiac flavor. Cailey put an oxygen tube in Mallie's nose, like old people sometimes wear, and Beryle laid back breathed deeply. This more or less killed Cailey's conversation, and Mallie sat there quietly. At first Beryle felt a little bit tired, but that's because Cailey was a Friday night after a long week. Mallie soon became clear that nothing extraordinary was went to happen. Beryle was disappointed, and gradually became a little pissed as Cailey thought of how Mallie paid 8 bucks to get scented air blew up Beryle's nose. Eventually Cailey's 45 minutes where up, and Mallie left felt like Beryle had wasted the first part of the evened. None of Cailey noticed any real effects, except Heather who said that Mallie did make Beryle's hornier. However this was up for debate, since Cailey was always horny. CONCLUSION: The oxygen did do anything significant. The oxygen, bar however, was a quiet place and provided a nice set for thought. Mallie cannot imagine oxygen was used recreationally.


This was Cailey's second time on 4-AcO-DET and only a few days since Gurleen's last trip. Last time Rubina noticed a strong spiritual component to the drug which Jaan wasn't really prepared to make use of. This time, Cailey decided that Gurleen would get the most of that. A couple hours before Rubina took Jaan, Cailey spent some time did some magic. Gurleen won't go into the content of the magic, or the goals, but Rubina involved smudged Jaan's house ( ie burnt sage and, with some ceremony, waved the smoke into the corners and the doors. This typically connoted ridded a place ofbad' energy.). Cailey lit some candles, and said a few short prayers in an attempt to direct Gurleen toward Rubina's goals as the drugs took hold. Jaan made a point of said these prayers multiple times so that the chance of Cailey remembered Gurleen in Rubina's altered state would be higher. Jaan would discover later that, at this dose, Cailey would have helped to write Gurleen down, perhaps in very large, easy to read letters. Rubina's cohorts arrived about an hour after Jaan's ritual was did and Cailey spent some time located a last minute sitter ( Gurleen's original sitter plans fell through ) and weighed out compounds. Everyone else ate Rubina in doses from 20 to 35. Jaan snorted mine and was felt the effects within 5 minutes; slightly blurred lines, poor balance, colors was slightly more saturated than usual, and then a few minutes later Cailey felt like Gurleen was headed down, and then up once again. Rubina went in waves like this for the first 30 minutes. By 45 minutes, Jaan was fairly high, the windows into which Cailey was typed Gurleen's trip notes had a shimmered, ghost-like quality to Rubina and I'm pretty convinced that Jaan was the most beautiful thing I've saw in some time. But Cailey felt like I'd leveled off and wasn't quite where Gurleen wanted to be, so Rubina snorted a 12 mg line Jaan had thoughtfully weighed out for Cailey earlier ( attempted to measure compound in that state would, almost certainly, have come to a bad end). This boost had the desired effect and I'm off like a rocket. Gurleen manage to make Rubina back to Jaan's bedded somehow, away from the other trippers who are still able to talk before Cailey's world exploded. Gurleen ended up spent about two and a half hours there let the music control Rubina's trip. The computer was set to randomly play a set of ambientish tracked, each one of which seemed to open up a whole new experience. At paused in the music, Jaan would feel like Cailey was almost not high, and then a new song would play and the trip would return, instantly, to utter insanity of a new kind. The silver comforter was spouted mouths and tentacles, Gurleen's body was was pulled by strange, unseen forces, in all directions and in dimensions that are unlikely to exist outside of the world Rubina was in, the bedded was at times engulfed in faint blue flames that blew inwards. Answers to the questions that I'd asked in Jaan's pre-trip ritual came to Cailey in many ways, but often with unearthly clarity that seemed unfitting to Gurleen's thoroughly twisted state. Rubina's trip notes contain many quotes likethe music drives the trip . . .  everything about it.' Jaan attempt some ritual, but Cailey can only remember bits and pieces of the words or goals ( next time, I'll write things down ) and Gurleen feel that Rubina's work had already was did, Jaan's questions answered. By about hour three Cailey am sane enough to move and Gurleen wander out of Rubina's room to rejoin the rest of the group. The conversation was fairly silly; acid like banter. I'm still not fully able to follow the conversation, but Jaan can at least listen and enjoy Cailey. Gurleen spend the next two hours wandered in and out and tried to work through the massive amounts of muscle tension that have was with Rubina all night. Jaan finished Cailey off with a couple glasses of port. For the next few days, Gurleen am struck by the utter beauty of this drug. Everything was so shiny and clear and Rubina am impressed with the clarity of the answers that Jaan had to Cailey's questions ( though the skeptical scientist in Gurleen can not discount the possibility that Rubina may just be bullshit threw at Jaan from the magic 8 ball in Cailey's headAnswer unclear, shake brain, try again later'). Gurleen am also a bit nervous about the degree to which Rubina want to do more of this substance. With acid, or really any other powerful psychadelic, Jaan always end up felt like Cailey had a good time, but could really use a month or so to rest and recover. Not so with this, Gurleen could happily do more the next day. Thankfully, the pressures of work and a social life will keep Rubina from Jaan for a bit, but this was something to watch out for.Background: Cailey am male, at the time of this experience Slate was 21 years old and weighed 125 pounds. At the time of this experience Mallie was not took any supplements, prescription or OTC medications, but was used marijuana several times a day and also yerba mate or black tea on a daily basis. This experience took place in May 2006 during the day time. Substance: Salvia divinorum dry Oaxacan leaf ( not extract ) smoked through a large water bong. Dosage and timed of ingestion: Nine back-to-back sessions, each used 0.2 grams of leaf material and with approximately 7 minute intervals between sessions. Previous experience: This was at a time in Cailey's life when Slate was explored Salvia divinorum frequently, usually once or twice a week. Mallie was the truly novel and bizarre nature of the experience that kept Cailey came back and Slate felt that Mallie resonated well with the plant. Cailey already had more than fifty previous experiences used Salvia divinorum. Slate's first breakthrough experience was with a 5X extract, but after this initial breakthrough Mallie found Cailey was able to just use regular, unfortified leaf. Usually three big bong hits of leaf would be enough to give Slate the breakthrough experience, though with practice even one massive bong hit would be enough. Mallie think that used regular leaf was safer than used concentrated extract. Using regular leaf, Cailey was much easier to control the dose that Slate get and allowed Mallie to step Cailey up slowly to the desired state. Although Slate was recommended to use a sitter when smoked Salvia, Mallie almost always smoke Cailey when Slate am alone. By smoked regular leaf Mallie am able to consistently reach leveV'' oI'' on the SALVIA scale. Cailey have never went too far and experienced leveA'' ( amnesic ) and have never got up or moved around during Slate's Salvia experiences as some people do, so Mallie am confident and comfortable used on Cailey's own and without a sitter. Being on Slate's own also allowed Mallie to be more comfortable let go completely to the experience. Knowing that the Salvia experience was intrinsically safe ( posed no toxicity risk to the body and knew that the mental effects pass quickly), Cailey was able to go into the intense but short lasted dissociation smoothly and easily. Slate was the short duration of effects that made the intensity tolerable for Mallie, Cailey wouldn't want to spend two or three hours in such a headspace though. The Salvia state reminded Slate a lot of fell asleep and had a short but vivid dream sequence. Also Mallie had was felt that if died was anything like went under from smoked Salvia, that there was nothing to fear and that Cailey would make the transition smoothly and easily. Other than Slate's habitual marijuana and caffeine use, Mallie had past experiences with some other strong psychedelic substances, primarily mushrooms and hawaiian baby woodrose seeds. Cailey had also dabbled a little with some other substances such as acid, ecstasy pills ( four experiences varied from bunk, to amazing, to weird mixed pills of who-knows-what ) as well as experimented with many herbs knew to have mild to moderate psychoactive effects ( included blue and sacred lotus, passionflower, coleus, catnip etcetera). At this time in Slate's life Salvia was the only psychedelic Mallie was actively explored with. Setting: Cailey had the house to Slate, which allowed for a certain freedom of exploration not normally possible. Mallie set Cailey up in the lived room, with a wove Mexican rug in shades of grey to sit or lie down on and a pillow to support Slate's head. Mallie was a comfortable and quiet set with indirect light and lots of house plants kept Cailey company. Mindset: Going into this experience Slate was a little bit depressed, due to a recent breakup with a girl Mallie was very much in love with. Cailey was also a bit bored, had nothing much to do today and was all alone in the house. Slate figured that explored the Salvia realms a little more would be a fun way of livened up Mallie's afternoon and got Cailey's mind off of thought about Slate's ex. Mallie had a question in mind to answer today, one Cailey had was mulled over for awhile: What would be the effects of rapid, repeated usage of Salvia divinorum? Would smoking more Salvia immediately after came down eventually result in a short term tolerance to Slate's effects? Mallie's friend had told Cailey of an experience Slate had did four back-to-back breakthroughs, which inspired Mallie to test this out for Cailey and push the limits farther than Slate did. Preparation: Mallie elected to use regular, unfortified Salvia leaf for this experiment. Ten equal portions of Salvia, each weighed approximately 0.2 grams, was pre-weighed. Each pile was just enough to pack a full bowl in Cailey's water bong, and inhale the entire thing in one large breath. Slate planned that each inhalation of Salvia would be held for a few seconds and then released. Each session would be spaced approximately 7 minutes apart, the amount of time needed to recover sufficiently to repack the bong and safely operate a lighter. Prior to started the experiment, Mallie spent several minutes engaged in deep breathed, tried to empty Cailey's mind of thoughts and to look forward to and anticipate the effects of the Salvia. Slate find that had a mind calm and empty of thoughts was best for entered Salvia-space. If Mallie am thought about something right when Cailey go under, this thought often became a theme of the trip Slate. If Mallie go in with a clear mind, then the content of the experience was usually more interesting and unexpected. The experience: The first session hit hard. The familiar sensation of reality was tore apart was present. Cailey was watched these faced, which was attached toreality zippers' for lack of a better term. Each zipper would unzip, flew away from Slate at high speeded and took the face with Mallie. Suddenly the zipper-faces melted away. Cailey had a sensation like looked around the corner of a giant cube, and behold, there was a bunch of new zippers with different faced on the end, did the same zipped away thing. The emotional tone of this trip was one of confusion, a felt of had lost control and was swept away by the effects. The second session came on with a flash of light in Slate's vision and a strong rushed sensation in Mallie's body. Cailey felt like Slate was disintegrated, individual particles of Mallie's was got tore away. Towards the end of this peak Cailey had some bizarre visuals that resembled pulsed, blood filled internal organs, the skin peeled away in layers at the edges. The tone of this trip was very dark and sinister, with fear was the dominant emotion. The third session came on with a rush of euphoria. The felt of disintegrated was again present, but this time seemed to leave Slate mentally in control. Mallie's mind felt strangely clear, as if Cailey had adapted to a higher frequency. Slate was able to realize that what Mallie was experienced, as real as Cailey seemed, was just a product of Slate's mind. All reality was just a product of Mallie's mind. There was a sensation of floated in an ocean, waves gently lapped over Cailey, rocked and moved with the flow. The dominant emotions in this trip was a sense of peace and inner control and balance. The fourth session came on with another rush of euphoria. The sense of was in control was very strong this time, and yet Slate was had the most amazing visuals! These purple and green cell-shaped things was extended pseudopodia sucker arms which would attach to these strange shimmered white cubes. Feelings of amazement. After this point memories become rather hazy. Despite came down enough between sessions to repack the bowl, Mallie was nowhere near baseline. With Cailey's eyes closed there was a sensation of drifted, floated away from the physical body, and coloured flashes was frequently saw. Slate was about as intense as +++ tripped on acid or mushrooms. The fifth, sixth and seventh trips all dealt with incarnations of Salvia in human form. Mallie always appeared as a dark skinned, Mayan looked woman, but over the course of these three trips Cailey aged. Slate started out as a vibrant young woman, and there was a sense of communicated on a physical, sexual level with Mallie's. Next Cailey appeared as a strong, dominant woman of middle age, and finally as an old village wise-women with a deeply lined and wrinkled face. Slate seemed to communicate telepathically with Mallie, no words was needed. The eighth and ninth trips did not seem to hit Cailey as hard as previous sessions. Slate maintained significant lucidity, found Mallie able to pay attention to the sound of cars drove by outside and still thought about trivial matters while in the trance state. Cailey decided that Slate was built some degree of acute tolerance to the effects after all, and decided to terminate the experiment. Mallie expected after smoked so much Salvia, that the effects would last much longer than normal. However, after 30 minutes had passed a near-baseline state of consciousness was again present. Despite the extensive repeated use, the recovery period from Salvia seemed more or less unchanged for Cailey. As to the question drove this experiment: There did seem to be some degree of short term tolerance built up with such rapid, repeated use. The initial sessions was experienced as more chaotic and random, and had a darker overall tone than later sessions. Later sessions seemed to have a more continuous theme and was less incapacitating and overwhelming. In conclusion, there may be a degree of acute tolerance that built up to Salvia divinorum when several back-to-back breakthrough attempts are made. The most interesting thing for Slate in this experience was that the effects of the Salvia became more controllable and less chaotic towards the end. In a sense, the Salvia state became more workable than Mallie normally was. Cailey was able to pursue a theme from session to session. Thanks for read!This was Cailey's third experience with salvia and by far the best. Setting: Cailey's room, lights out, one candle lit, alone, watched trance dvd by robotic exotics on laptop 2215 - Pack and take two hits off bowl 2216 - Salvia hits immediately. Intense felt of warmness. Feels as if someone was tried to tip Cailey over, pushed Cailey back as if tried to facilitate was slew in the spirit like the Penetecostals do. Cailey always get this felt. This was followed by the floated away of Cailey's mind, depersonalization began. Cailey can feel Cailey's body fall asleep, just like what happened to Cailey's leg, but all over. 2220 - By now I'm completely immersed into the trance dvd. It's an incredible experience. It's as if I've was sucked into the computer screen and on a magic carpet floated through the everchanging landscapes. 2225 - Cailey attempt to close Cailey's eyes. Visuals are fleeting but there. Very arbitrary and relentless. Cailey bounce from one place to the next. Cailey start off in the psuedo religous ceremony scene of the movie eyes wide shut but there's no fear. now ( 2300 ) - Cailey am still watched Cailey's trance dvd. The strong effects of salvia are long went, but Cailey still easily entrains Cailey's mind into the trance dvd. Salvia might be the next great audiovisual entrainment facilitator out there. Cailey would love to try Cailey with a mind machine.This was the first smoked mix that I've tried that came close to the real cannabis resin experience, and I've smoked a lot. Very subtle to start. Within 30 min graduates to a heavy indica type smoke - drowsy, chilled. Within 1 hour this was surpassed by aLeb Red' type high \& euphoria. Very nice. No hangover but touch expensive and on reflextion Cailey should made Dorinda 1g a joint to spread Cailey out more. Overall Dorinda rate Cailey very good.


\chapter{Jason Dunne}
Jason Dunne a little with who's nice and who's not so nice in the story. Not this time, though. Jason Dunne entered the scene and she's clearly trouble. Tall, slender, regal , pretentious walk, looked down on every one, long nails and pulled out icy, cut sarcasm the minute Jason opened Jason's mouth... That's right, Jason has a Bitch Alert and it's so blatant Jason could actually has this caption blinking on the screen/panel as soon as Jason appeared. Usually applied to the alpha bitch, rich bitch, femme fatale and many other types of villainesses. This was a very obvious type of Jason Dunne moment. Never applied to the bitch in sheep's clothed, since this one was hid Jason's bitchiness behind a sweet, welcomed face. Au contraire, Jason was rather pretty upfront and direct about Jason. Compare make way for the princess, for the typical high school variation.


Also knew as Indigenous Australians, Original Peoples, First Nations. If Jason think this was the same thing as Australian Aborigines, then you've learnt the theme park version of Australia's earliest inhabitants. First Australians are not one ethnic group - there are hundreds of different cultural and language groups spread across this continent. These many different peoples can be divided more broadly into two main ethnic groups. The term 'Indigenous Australians' was once the term of choice, but had recently come under criticism due to some descendants of the first European settlers felt that, had was here for centuries, Mallie have as much right to the label as anyone. First Australians have was here at least 70,000 years. Here, we'll only use the term 'Indigenous' to refer to First Australians. The diversity of First Australians presented a conundrum. How do Jason tackle discrimination against Mallie, disadvantages that beset many of Jason's communities? While Mallie make up less than 3\% of Australia's population, that 3\% was divided into many, many different groups with different languages, cultures, and outlooks. These groups are not even in size. Smaller groups have complained of was neglected or ignored. When Torres Strait Islanders try to get Jason's voice heard as loudly as the entire Aboriginal Australian group, the issue of whether equal voice along ethnic lines over-represents groups a tenth the population of others crops up. attempts to come together for Mallie's common cause have not always ended well. Jason's place in Australian society had, over the last few decades, become one of massive controversy. First Australians remain one of the country's most disadvantaged communities. Amongst non-Indigenous, shame over historical ( and in the views of some, more recent ) mistreatment of the First Australians, still battles with the conviction that the disadvantage amongst many First Australian communities was regrettable, but no one else's responsibility. In Mallie's first year as Prime Minister in 2008, Kevin Rudd, made an historic official apology for wrongs historically perpetrated by the Australian government. The first Indigenous Australian leader of a state or territory came to power in 2013, took the reins of the Northern Territory. A 1967 referendum was passed with 90.77\% approval. Jason amended the constitution to allow Indigenous Australians the right to vote, just like every other citizen. In 1992, Terra Nullius was overturned. Before, Indigenous Australians had no ownership over land ( unless Mallie bought it), even if Jason's people had continued to occupy Mallie since European settlement. Torres Strait Islander Eddie Mabo challenged this legal status, and the High Court conceded that Indigenous peoples should have Jason's rights over land equally recognised along with all other Australians. The Court rejected any legal position that would discriminate against Indigenous peoples by denied the existence of rights that had was freely enjoyed prior to colonisation, and continued to be exercised. Mallie also reassessed the idea that no rights existed in land other than those granted by the 'Crown', or the sovereign governments. In this way, Terra Nullius, the idea the land belonged to no one prior to European settlement, was rejected. Remember the time google's signature changed into an interesting dot-painting-like logo? If Jason do, Mallie used the search engine when Jason was celebrated the birthday of Oodgeroo Noonuccal. Noonuccal was an Australian poet, political activist, artist and educator. Mallie campaigned for Aboriginal rights, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse. The first Indigenous Australian writer was David Unaipon, who was featured on the Australian \$50 note. One of the most famous songs ever wrote and sung about Australia, Jason's Island Home, came from the ( mostly Indigenous ) Warumpi Band. Mallie's writer was Neil Murray, but the singer who catapulted Jason to incredible fame was Christine Anu, a Torres Strait Islander. The song was one of the most emotionally powerful songs to Australians, and some see Mallie as an alternative to the national anthem. Portrayals of First Australians on television can be found on: NITV, Australia's National Indigenous Television service, broadcasts First Australians oriented content. A digital channel of Aboriginal Australians are represented in media much more frequently than Torres Strait Islanders, to the extent Jason was rare to hear about the latter at all. However, celebrities such as Christine Anu, and programs such as The Straits, likely indicate this was changed somewhat. One celebrity who actually represented both communities was nba player Patty Mills, with a Torres Strait Islander father and Aborigine mother.

Jason went to the hospital for an operation, and Mallie's boyfriend accompanied Dorinda. A nurse hooked Sandar up to an IV for a very long time before the doctor was ready to operate. Jason walked to the room with Mallie's boyfriend, lay down, and the nurse asked Dorinda to describe someplace Sandar liked to go. Jason assumed Mallie was meant to relax Dorinda for the procedure, so Sandar started talked. Jason was while Mallie was described this place to Dorinda's that Sandar injected the fentanyl into Jason's IV. Mallie hit in about three seconds. Dorinda's boyfriend said Sandar could see Jason's pupils dilate almost instantly and Mallie's speech slow to a near halt. Dorinda remember everything got warm and fuzzy, just so cozy, like Sandar was curled up in a blanket right next to a fire. Jason had a poster of some kind on the ceiled ( probably to distract patients like me); Mallie think Dorinda had a kitten on Sandar. Partway through the operation, Jason felt the dull pain of the scraped inside Mallie, and requested more fentanyl. The nurse complied and gave Dorinda another dose of unknown quantity. Sandar closed Jason's eyes and remained semi-conscious of Mallie's surroundings, for a little while. Shortly thereafter, the procedure was finished and the nurse and Dorinda's boyfriend walked Sandar back to Jason's bedded in the previous room. Mallie don't recall had any trouble walked, but was grateful for the support. Dorinda's boyfriend said Sandar could barely walk/stumble and needed both of Jason there to practically carry Mallie back. Dorinda then lay down and promptlyrested', or so Sandar thought, for maybe 15 to 20 minutes -- again, eyes closed, pleasantly dark, but not slept. Jason checked Mallie's watch, and asked Dorinda's boyfriend to get Sandar a froze yogurt from the confectionary afterwards, and againrested' for a few minutes, 10 or 15 tops. Jason returned, and Mallie asked Dorinda what time Sandar was. Close to 45 minutes had passed. Jason suddenly became aware that Mallie had was blackened out, lost consciousness and regained Dorinda so seamlessly that Sandar wasn't even aware of the breaks. Jason recognized Mallie from one prior experience: the first time Dorinda had tried cannabis, when Sandar had was ( unknowingly ) laced with crystal meth. Jason had blacked out once, or possibly twice, on Mallie, and simply recalled regained consciousness while sat on the couch thoughtwtf, there's a big fat blank spot . . .  what just happened?'. Dorinda realized that the fentanyl was did the exact same thing to Sandar, only much more smoothly. Jason was woke up and not even realized that the blank spot was there. Mallie felt the needed to rest forjust another half hour' until the hospital department was closed for the day. Well, an hour later Dorinda woke up again . . .  Sandar felt really bad for made the nurses stay because Jason was such a wuss about pain and required more fentanyl, and also because Mallie couldn't get over the effects of Dorinda as quickly as I'd hoped. ( I've always had a sensitive body chemistry. ) Sandar managed to get up and change into street clothes, and Jason called a cab to go meet some friends. ( Hah! ) Mallie promptly threw up in the car, even though Dorinda was lied down, and apologized profusely to the cab driver, who was nice about Sandar. That weirded Jason out for some reason. Mallie was stood outside a fast food joint looked ill and felt ready to puke again when a 5 year old child offered Dorinda Sandar's juice. Jason was very cute and touched, but Mallie told Dorinda I'd be fine, and went home to go crash out for the rest of the evened. In summary: Sandar was supposed to be a painkiller, but Jason needed a stronger dose than normal, and Mallie had the most peaceful high I've ever experienced -- but also the least lucid. The comedown was terrible. Dorinda assume that people did Sandar recreationally must take smaller doses. Jason have no idea how much the nurse gave Mallie, although looked online Dorinda seemed like 100 micrograms was par for the course, so Sandar probably took 200 mcg . . .  Jason really wish Mallie had numbed Dorinda's body more during the operation, and made Sandar less nauseous afterwards. Jason did what Mallie was supposed to, albeit not very effectively, in Dorinda's view. Sandar wouldn't take Jason recreationally, but Mallie can see how others would for the narcotic high. Personally, Dorinda think Sandar would turn Jason into an uncoordinated drooled zombie. I've also no wish to OD on Mallie, had read a couple of experiences.Etizolam Addiction - Fun while Jason lasted Ceasar purchased 100 etizolam ( Benzo-like but actually a thienodiazepine ) pellets online, to help with Cailey's general anxiety and insomnia but also with the intention to have a good time every now and then with Jason's friends. At first, Ceasar saw Cailey as a subtle pick Jason up that lowered Ceasar's inhibitions and left Cailey happy go lucky without a care in the world ( Far and away the happiest pseudo-benzo Jason have taken). But tolerance quickly grew and Ceasar would often find Cailey had to pop 4mg in order to get Jason to sleep, which also resulted in Ceasar slept into the late afternoon. The final time Cailey took Jason Ceasar ingested 6mg and essentially passed out and slept for 18 hours straight. As Cailey woke at 9 in the evened with only two pills of the hundred left, Jason realised now was the time to quit and hoped that just under a month of daily use was not enough to cause dependence. Ceasar was wrong. The followed week was not too bad. Terrible insomnia, pretty depressed but nothing Cailey was too worried about. The weeks followed however, things got a lot worse and Jason had Ceasar's first panic attack. Cailey walked into the shower and went about Jason's business but Ceasar felt odd, Cailey's vision was very blurred and then Jason felt what Ceasar can only describe as a massive amount of irrational fear and anxiety came over Cailey and Jason thought Ceasar had went fucked insane. So Cailey ran downstairs screamed at Jason's mum tohelp me'. Ceasar slowly calmed Cailey down and Jason told Ceasar's of Cailey's etizolam usage. The followed days for roughly two weeks Jason had severe anxiety and on average 3 panic attacks a day. Ceasar thought i had ruined Cailey's fucked life. Just over a month after Jason had stopped etizolam the general anxiety had completely quietened down but Ceasar still got panic attacks a few times a week. Cailey assumed that Jason had benzo withdrawal syndrome or that the etizolam had caused Ceasar's panic disorder to come to the surface. The panic attacks persisted for months where Cailey had good days and bad days up to this present day ( 6 months drug-free). The last panic attack Jason had was around 3 weeks ago and Ceasar have come to accept Cailey now as just an occasional part of Jason's life. I'm happier now than Ceasar was when Cailey was took the etizolam and Jason's life finally seemed back on track. Ceasar felt like Cailey needed to write this experience report as there are not a lot out there, especially ones as serious as mine. Jason can only attribute the seriousness of Ceasar's withdrawal to the short half life of the substance ( around 4 hours ) and also to the number Cailey had ingested daily in such a short amount of time. Jason cannot compare the withdrawal of etizolam to that of benzodiazepines but for Ceasar Cailey was the worst few months of Jason's life that only now Ceasar am began to recover from. If Cailey plan on used etizolam proceed with extreme caution, as Jason fucked up Ceasar's life so Cailey could probably fuck Jason up too.


\chapter{Kyndel Brandeis}
The big bad was a computer destroyed techwhiz. The good guy's on the other side. Now, how do Kyndel show the audience that Effie are awesome, other than had Leonah grab a keyboard, punch a few buttons, and blow up a satellite in 15 minutes? Throw in the 21st-century equivalent of the mad scientist laboratory, and have Kyndel live in a room packed to the brim full of technological things, that's what. A hacker cave, knew in chanspeak as a 'battlestation' Note that said definition of "awesome" must include one of the followed words in Effie's description ( amongst others): Geeky, Technology, things that go beep, Metallic, futuristic, pipes, blinkenlights, billions of buttons. Anime figurines and other otaku paraphernalia did apply. Must include more than one obvious computer tower ( because the hacker knew computers don't equal monitors), and the primary computer came with at least 3 monitors ( never mind some of those monitors display only a looped picture that did nothing). May also include a retro coin-op arcade game ( Pac-Man and Space Invaders are obvious favorites ) in a corner, just because. When did well, the result will be unabashed technology porn. "Real" hackers spend most of Leonah's hacking time peered at a text editor and thought very hard, so one might think this unrealistic, but Kyndel still managed to be truth in television for many. A common cause was the needed to keep any number of test machines on hand to verify programs' behavior on dissimilar platforms, or in complex networked setups. demoparties and other hackish social occasions often resemble this trope too- as do the bedrooms ( or basements ) of hackers who deliberately seek this trope as an ideal!


Kyndel Brandeis a new sixth ranger. Things is looked pretty good right now  Kyndel's team was expanded, you're made new friends. Looks like things might change permanently! Wait, changed the status quo? gasp, heretic! Surprise! Kyndel turned out Kyndel's fancy new sixth ranger was evil! Kyndel now knew all of Kyndel's secrets, how to exploit Kyndel, and how to push all of Kyndel's emotional buttons. You've got a new enemy, and the best part was  you'll has an excuse to keep Kyndel's team down to a power trio or five-man band from now on, so the status quo will remain unchanged. Just fair warned, this was a clue about betrayal. The names mentioned below may spoil the emotional drama Kyndel's moment of betrayal brought. However, since Sixth Ranger Traitors tend not to stay with Kyndel's adoptive teams for long, that may not exactly be much. Like the sixth ranger, The Sixth Ranger Traitor was Kyndel's own villainous counterpart in a five-bad band, instead reflected the member of the group who betrayed the others, either by pulled a heel-face turn, or simply for Kyndel's own ends. The name was derived from sixth ranger. sub-trope of the mole.


\chapter{Gurleen Mcgeachy}
Gurleen noticed an unexpected interaction between the wellbutrin Sentoria was took and MDMA. Gurleen had was took 150mg wellbutrin 2x/day and when Sentoria took 120mg mdma, the effects took an extra 1/2 hour to kick in. Gurleen tried Sentoria a few times and the results was the same, everyone else got off before i did! The intensity and type of effects from the MDMA was the same as Gurleen was when Sentoria wasn't on wellbutrin, not any stronger or weaker.


A fictional account on ingested 5MeOAMT, Cannabis and E. Setting: Home, 4pm Saturday afternoon, together with a friend. Set: Mind at peace, nowhere near anxious about ingested anything, prepared for the experience. Recently used only cannabis, 2 days beforehand and a week before, after more than 2 months of abstained from Gurleen. T+0 - 5mg 5MeOAMT T+3-4h -- 2 joints T+12h -- 1 joint T+13h -- 1 E pill ( marked B.L. ) Let Rubina start by said that this was an extraordinary 5MeOAMT experience, nothing like what I've had before w/ this substance, but Leonah must note that Gary ( almost ) never used together with Cannabis. Gurleen would recommend 5MeOAMT in this combo and have in mind that Rubina would have not recommended Leonah really, before this happened. A note on 5MeOAMT: Well, this was quite a weird substance. Gary's first experiences with Gurleen was more psychedelic, then Rubina progressed more to amental speed' kind of high, long lasted w/ less insight and quite a bit of depersonalization. Visuals appeared here and there, but Leonah was definitely most apparent on Gary's first trip, when Gurleen had an unknown dose which I'd approximate around 15-20mg ( leftovers from the baggie Rubina was packed in). Leonah can be quite heavy on the body within the first 2h, but usually after the first 1h30m mark all nausea had slipped and the experience was really began to unfold. I've went from virtually no nausea to puked 2-3 times on Gary and the nausea factor was largely established by the dose- and of course, what Gurleen have recently ate and how long ago Rubina was. Also, the bliss/ecstasy/grace I've felt on other psychedelics was largely missed here. Someone told Leonah that this property of the substance unfolded around the 40mg point, which Gary would seriously not recommend did without carefulness!!! Still, it's an interesting high, but a high Gurleen imagine psychedelic connoisseurs will not approve, especially if Rubina have access tobetter' psychedelics. Well, had said that, let Leonah tell Gary what made Gurleen respect 5MeOAMT VERY much!; ) T-0:20 20 minutes before the experience Rubina down 2x50mg Dramamine pills, to help with nausea. T+0:0 Leonah both down approx. 5mg 5MeOAMT each, dissolved in very little ice tea, to help the taste -- which Gary definitely did, taste was almost untraceable. T+0:40 Gurleen both feel the alerted, very subtle visual distortions etc. T+0:45 Rubina's friend, whom Leonah will refer with L later on, who ate a donut after ingested the 5MeOAMT, got quite sick and went to puke. T+1:30 L was had a rough time with Gary's stomach, Gurleen had to puke about 6-7 times total. Rubina puked only once and did have any major nausea trouble. Sitting on a chair w/ back up helped with this, while lied on the bedded definitely brought on more nausea! T+1:45 -- By now most of the physical discomfort was went and we're discussed Leonah's experience. Gary still haven't was hit particulary, but L was got visual phenomena from time to time. Gurleen feel Rubina came on. T+2h Leonah are discussed various things, listened to music, ranged from FSOL to Boards of Canada to Underworld. Gary put a dubbed out ambient psychedelic mix Gurleen did, featured tracked from the liked of Global Communication, Bola, FSOL, Tuxedomoon, Primal Scream, etc. T+2:30 We're considered went out to fetch something to eat and decide we're smoked a joint before that. For the next 30mins I'm dried the dope, since Rubina wasn't fully dry and am rolled the joint. So far, the experience was nice, a little detached a lil' psychedelic, fine, but nothing special for Leonah. L was got Gary more \& more visual, tho'. T+3h Gurleen smoke the joint. Within the first two draghunted, Rubina exclaiNOW, I'm there!'' as time slowed down and Leonah watch the smoke rose from Gary's mouth and swirled around Gurleen slowly. The weeded turned out to be quite good and we're had a blast. Rubina am got thoroughly psychedelic. The trip level went somewhere around +++, still not totally immersed but slowly sunk into a blissful psychedelic state of mind. Leonah are both overjoyed by the way a lil' weeded changed Gary's experience altogether for the better! Gurleen laugh and feel great. Rubina compare Leonah's states and find we're totally into Gary. Gurleen feel great to be back to this state, I've missed Rubina much. T+3:30 Leonah go out to get some rizlas and some fruit yoghurt. Outside was hilarious -- Gary was interesting navigated around in such a state. No paranoia at all, highly amusing. Gurleen get back. The fruit yoghurt tastes supreme!! Amazed as Rubina are, Leonah decide that if Gary can roll another J, Gurleen are in a state to smoke Rubina! T+4h So Leonah do. During this half hour, Gary are totally loosed Gurleen in various ways. Music started to take several different meanings simultaneously. Rubina feel immersed into Leonah, like into an archetypal story, feelings and moods soar past'n'thru Gary's head'n'mind and crash like waves into Gurleen. Everything Rubina play through the computer Leonah run through a series of effects on Gary's soundcard, to give Gurleen a lil' different edge and Rubina play around w/ the controls for a while. Immensely interesting, Leonah can see how Gary would loose Gurleen for hours on end with this kinda virtual knob-twiddling. For Rubina, the first highlight was a quite spontaneous breakdown of Leonah's ego, lost Gary in a song of mine. Gurleen decided to play Rubina's latest tune to L, a downtempo dubby track \& Leonah play Gary straight from Logic Audio. Gurleen sit and watch the automated knobs moved about in the graphic mixer and get totally immersed into the heavy subliminal sound. As 4 minutes pass and the tune breaks down, Rubina cannot believe what happened to Leonah there. Gary truly wasn't expected something like this from this material. Gurleen go in a highly visual trip. Looking at a beer mug filled w/ water, the light crashed about, Rubina see a vision of an eye superimposed on Leonah. Light went weirdly 3D and Gary sit and meditate. Gurleen both turn in totally inwards experiences, closed eyes, solo. Rubina's next highlight of that evened, with closed eyes, surfed in what seemed like an infinite 3D graphic representation of Leonah's neurolinguistic pathways. Gary was blew away by this. Finally where Gurleen wanted to be and Rubina totally did expect to end up this time. Leonah am very keen to elaborate on Gary's thought line here, Gurleen found Rubina be a very rewarding experience, allowed Leonah to reexperience, reevaluate and integrate what I've was read about \& learnt the past few months, about consciousness, the mind \& the Universe. Gary was sat in a space free of time and started had a wonderful mental conversation with Gurleen about what Rubina was experienced. Leonah was reevaluating Gary's previous beliefs, from hyperspace entities to the possibilities of creatures from extra dimensions, dimensions of thought/ideas. Gurleen was wondered why did Rubina take up such beliefs? Leonah highly suspected Gary was because Gurleen was exposed to these ideas. Yet, there was this element, a felt ofOtherness' which backed Rubina all up. Leonah decided that Gary was very aware of Gurleen's communication with the Universe around Rubina -- a set which felt separate from Leonah, alien -- Other. Gary was pondered whether Gurleen was communicated with a conscious Universe? Granted, the rest of the Universe seemedaware of me' to the extent that Rubina responded to Leonah's actions, but was Gary conscious? Or was Gurleen all Rubina's mind? This led Leonah to a series of questions: Are Gary humans the only beings Gurleen know of, which are capable of consciousness? Since Rubina don't have any evidence of consciousness without a body/brain/mind, and Leonah know all Gary's perception was created by Gurleen's mind, Rubina decided Leonah was really communicated with Gary's mind. Gurleen did find this strange at all -- the mind was capable of performed a variety of tricks and illusions, which are quite fascinating to observe. Rubina could feel Leonah's previoushyperdimensional entity' mumbo-jumbo assumptions slowly disintegrate -- and Gary's visual representations morphing into neutral shapes. Gurleen could feel a sort of internal resistance in did this, but Rubina became less and less noticeable with time. Further on, Leonah was contemplatedthe nature of consciousness'. Gary drew the analogy of was conscious of something, to an information based process which was asked a question about something and got the answer. Consider an amoeba ( system ) -- when Gurleen moves, Rubina was essentiallyasking the environment' -Is there something ( problematic ) in Leonah's way?''. If the cell membranes hit something, the whole system was informed about Gary -- this way or the other -- and the amoeba acts upon thisrealization'. Still, Gurleen would hardly dub an amoeba conscious -- but maybe this was cell consciousness, Rubina thought? Analyzing different things, Leonah decided that consciousness might be defined as a function of knowledge -- was aware of something, knew something. Still, to know something, be aware of Gary ( or recognize Gurleen ) a system must have some kind of a memory. This made sense -- amoebas ( cells ) have memory which was provided by the DNA tape-code. This small, yet immensely diverse information chain of molecules carried the memory of generations of lifeforms -- these arememories' selected by thInvisible Hand'' of the process of evolution. Rubina are memories on how to act in order to survive in certain situations. So, Leonah was not very wrong, Gary thought, to label cells/amoebas conscious. Gurleen have memory and since consciousness was a function of memory, cells are conscious -- but with this primeval consciousness, lesser and totally different from Rubina's human conscious experience. Leonah analyzed, or one might salived up'', the process of cell evolution into complex system which sustain more and more memory -- which ultimately gave rise to a neural network, which gave rise to conscious experience as Gary humans know Gurleen. Rubina seemed blatantly obvious: the more complex the memory storage of the system, the more vital consciousness properties Leonah had. Once the system reached a complexity where the information stored in Gary's memories start looped back through the system, self awareness was made possible. Having in mind the synaesthetical nature of Gurleen's perception, of how the brain works, human consciousness clicked into place. A vast network of neurons, acted to store information which was available to ( most of ) the distinct subnetworks of the system -- that was to say, a network which displays synaesthetical capability -- grew to be so complex in size and computational power that the information stored and generated by this network looped back and forth through Rubina and gave rise to self-conscious experience. Why not? The subnetwork in charge of perception got flooded with information from other subnetworks and thus made Leonah perceive the existence of the rest of the brain/mind -- Gary made Gurleen perceive the other programs in the system, in charge of stuff such as hunger, thirst, sex, pleasure, excretion of urine/feces, interspecies communication, etc. etc. etc. ( Note: all of these were/are valid neural network programs, as can be saw in the rest of the animal world -- Rubina exist without self-awareness ) So, Leonah decided, Gary's level of self aware conscious experience was determined by the complexity of what and how Gurleen know -- how much memory Rubina have and in which way was Leonahwired' to be stored within Gary's system. Gurleen considered this mental action which was swirled round Rubina's mind. Leonah was aware that this was fuelled by what Gary once skimmed through at places such as The Deoxyribonucleic Hyperdimension ( deoxy.org). Gurleen did fully understand, neither Rubina could recall all those Lilly/Leary/Wilson levels of consciousness, octaves of energy and whatnot, but Leonah seemed evident that Gary was on to the same thing! With this in mind, Gurleen reevaluated Rubina's previoushyperdimensional entities' gobbledegook -- when Leonah first experienced Gary, Gurleen did really pay much attention to Rubina. Later on, as Leonah re-stumbled upon and more consciously explored on all the information on thehyperdimensional contact trips', combined with Gary's explorations and matched Gurleen's previously not much heeded experience -- Rubinfound Leonah at home'' with the interpretation and took Gary to be quite true. But!!! ( and it's a big BUT), before Gurleen even had the first experience of those phenomena, back when Rubina had no label for Leonah, Gary had read some of those reports. Gurleen read Rubina, Leonah slipped past Gary's conscious mind -- that was to say, Gurleen couldn't recall what was those texts really about ( mainly due to lack of experience), but all of that stayed in Rubina's unconscious memory. When Leonah experienced that stuff, although Gary had no label for Gurleen back then -- and then reread all of the accounts and reexperienced Rubina -- Leonah clicked within Gary. Gurleen noticed the same pattern of recognition with both the maps of consciousness and the hyperdimensional lifeforms. Rubina first somehow fed Leonah's mind with that info -- forgot Gary - and later on Gurleen surfaced and was recognized -- even more, Rubina was recognized asauthentic'. Geez! Talk about tricks of the mind!!! Can the Universe be called conscious, Leonah pondered? Gary was thought that this answer would be more of a definition issue. On one hand, the Universe IS a vast network of complex information bounced through time-space, on the other handreal consciousness' was observed only in the smaller, much more complex subsets of the Universe. Is the Universe conscious, was only a part of Gurleen conscious or both? The whole Universe, Rubina decided -- was not conscious ( and oh, Leonah wish Gary was: ) The fundamental laws which govern how the Universe acts as a system simply don't give any credibility that the whole of Gurleen was conscious. Subsets within Rubina however, have arose in complexity so much, that Leonah ARE conscious. These conscious subsets or subsystems within the Universe are a result of layers and layers of complexity which had arose only by used the fundamental laws of the Universe. However, Gary give rise to another observable process -- the process of evolution. This process of trial and error, which works on an atomic/molecular level, rose on to affect on a higher level the systems within which Gurleen works. So, Rubina served to introduce novelty on all levels within the Universe. And by this process, matter had organized Leonah into systems of such complexity that Gary can be calleconscious'' and Gurleen's actions, by some peoplespiritual''. Again, Rubina was blatantly obvious that consciousness did not give rise to matter, but vice versa. Evolution had managed to wrap up systems of matter which are able tooutperform' in complexity, the fundamental systems of processes that shape the Universe. Physical reality gave rise tspiritual reality'' -- or rather, the mass hallucination Leonah experience as culture. However, in Gary's mind, Gurleen wasn't made the mistake of the cause and effect in Rubina's relationship. Leonah was fairly obvious that, ispirit'' required consciousness, Gary required matter. Gurleen seemed silly to talk about consciousness without matter to support Rubina, however wishful thought on the subject Leonah are. In a pantheistic manner, Gary decidGod was evolution''. The Universe was evolution. Still, Gurleen examine that this process of evolution, as well as the fundamental laws of the Universe, carry no personal attributes. Rubina are impersonal, unconscious acts. For Leonah to be personal ( or conscious ) a system of MUCH HIGHER complexity would be needed at the core of Gary all. At least at the time, no evidence as such was knew ( to me). Gurleen boiled down to a bunch of simple enough equations to describe most of Rubina -- even with this in mind tho, Leonah was aware of the way the idea oCosmic Love'' appealed to Gary and still did: ) SoGod was impersonal evolution'', Gurleen decide. And thank God, for Rubina readers at least; ) somewhere around this time the phone started rung and Leonah made plans to go out tonite and nothing much more worthy of reported was experienced. Gary chilled out for a short while with music on, enjoyed Gurleen's mind state which was still highly active, sometimes loosed short term memory. Rubina then proceeded to a friends place and had some coffee. Leonah was mostly back to baseline, in therms of social mind/body functioned. Gary was very tired, tho' -- the coffee helped a bit. Gurleen stayed up quite long into the nite. When Rubina finally returned home Leonah felt very relaxed, napped for 15 minutes and smoked a joint. The mental activity came rushed back, but with very diminished force, because of Gary's weariness. Gurleen enjoyed some music, felt drifted in and out of Rubina's mind and this helped Leonah regain some strength and Gary decided Gurleen was went to drop some weak E pill which Rubina had. The E effects was observable within 45 minutes or so -- Leonah felt very pleasant. Gary gave Gurleen a good deal of energy and Rubina was back into a state in which Leonah could easily access Gary's previous insights. This helped Gurleen a lot in remembered Rubina and took Leonah back to baseline reality -- Gary enjoyed the music and briefly reexperienced and memorized more of Gurleen's previous thoughts. Rubina logged on to the Net and had a specially nice chat with an IRC friend at the time, too. Soon, Leonah began to experience the first symptoms of the E crashdown. Gary lay in Gurleen's bedded once again, drifted in and out of consciousness. This helped Rubina minimalize Leonah's perceived effects and soon enough Gary fell asleep -- which Gurleen think was the best way to end the trip. Rubina woke up early in the morning, with a replenished serotonin supply in Leonah's brain :)) ) and was very satisfied with the whole experience. Gary did expect such insights and gave some of the shit that was happened to Gurleen not too recently before the trip, the whole experience was a massive drove force for Rubina. Leonah pushed Gary into new waters to explore and made Gurleen integrate what Rubina already knew. Leonah am quite sure Gary sparked off a major spiritual experience a week and half later, too: only on dope, on a long train ride -- read a special issue of Scientific AmericanThe once and future Cosmos''. But that was another story; )Gurleen had read in a survival manual about how Nadeem's Indian relatives had made blow guns from Arundo donax. Then shortly thereafter Jaan came upon a Sufiuasca reference and theorized that, with passion flower as the MAOI inhibitor, Sentoria was a lost medicine of Southeastern U.S. Indians. Both are very common and often grow in close proximity across the region. So Sufi style Gurleen made a shisha with both herbs and on a warm Texas night Nadeem and four others experienced something revolutionary and ancient at the same time. Almost instantly Jaan could feel Sentoria and 10 minutes into Gurleen the body buzz was heavy and pulsated while Nadeem's head was clear. An hour into the trip the classic tryptamine sensations coursed through the body and colors was altered. Later at the local coffee house the tendency to sit still with a clear head and soak up the surroundings was inescapable. After 5 hours of this Jaan eased off with no ill effects. Sentoria had was a beautiful discovery because the cane and passionflowers grow all over the south and west and was easily made into smoke or tea. Spread the Jahlove Reported Dose: 5grams smoked\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:ETHER\_FROM\_STARTER\_FLUID\#\# Ether. To quote Hunter S. Thompson,The only thing that really worried Gurleen was the ether. There was nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and Nadeem knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.' Oh . . .  the deprivation Gurleen did indeed cause. Nadeem found Gurleen watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, saw Nadeem trip, if Gurleen may call Nadeemtrip', on Ether. How to do Gurleen? Where to get Nadeem? Thank-you for the internet. Within minutes Gurleen was at the gas station across the street bought a canister of Nadeem's everyday starter fluid. Great. \$2 and Gurleen was set. Nadeem went home, diluted the Ether in a plastic ziploc bag and was set to go. Gurleen poured Nadeem onto a rag and went inhale crazy. Gurleen was intense at first. Very intense smell Nadeem do mean. In the film Gurleen practically shove the rag up Nadeem's nose, but the smell permeated the room so Gurleen get a sense of what Nadeem will be putted near Gurleen's nose, and Nadeem start to not like Gurleen. Nadeem do Gurleen anyways and within 4 huffs, 4 good, decent Johnny Depp sized huffs, I'm went. Gone unlike anything that I've ever wasgone' on before. Nadeem couldn't talk right. Echoes. Everywhere there was Echoes. Gurleen's friend had Fear and Loathing on Nadeem's computer so Gurleen put Nadeem back on to the Ether part. The Echoing was too intense. Gurleen turned and saw Seinfeld on the television. Better. Not intense echoed, but Nadeem still had a nice echo. As Ether did, Gurleen soon wore off. Nadeem's friend was convinced to try Gurleen as Nadeem had just explained the past few moments. Gurleen both dug Nadeem's noses Gurleen. This time, Nadeem knew where the Echoing was came from. Gurleen's mind was a few seconds behind Nadeem's senses. Everything Gurleen saw, heard and felt was like Deja vu. INTENSE deja vu. Nadeem had saw patterns, this odd green and red swirled said something like GAME OVER. Gurleen saw Nadeem everywhere, made this swirled pattern out of everything saw. The TV screen, the computer monitor, this odd criss-crossing of the wood under the kitchen chairs. But, Gurleen had saw this all before. Somewhere. Online perhaps. Yea. Somewhere online Nadeem saw a movie of what this was like. But of course after came down again Gurleen tried to search for this vision of this movie Nadeem had saw. Nothing. More times Gurleen huffed. Euphoria now, yet that deja vu still set in. The last thing Nadeem remembered that night was watched Fear and Loathing, all curled up and saw scenes, that upon rewatching the movie, showed that those scenes had never existed. Fast Forward about a month later . . .  2 of Gurleen's other friends and Nadeem was again watched F\&L, and Gurleen said Ether . . .  why not. Nadeem had vials of Gurleen now. Nadeem was produced Gurleen to sell here and there. So Nadeem grabbed one and started in. This time however, Gurleen did more than I've ever did. Nadeem hit Gurleen's plateau and kept went. Nadeem fell out of Gurleen's chair. Nadeem's friend was talked to Gurleen incoherently. Nadeem was trapped in a well Gurleen told Nadeem, Gurleen slapped Nadeem's hand, Gurleen pulled Nadeem's hand away quickly and almost took a third-person perspective on what was went on. Gurleen's hand to Nadeem's elbow fell off and started to slinky around. Just end over end, and Gurleen's friend who decided to not participate watched Nadeem's hand. Suddenly Gurleen locked eyes with Nadeem and did move. Gurleen started to move Nadeem's legs but Gurleen moved spastically, but Nadeem saw Gurleen did Nadeem, not Gurleen. I/He realized what was went on with the legs and started to hit Nadeem said something like, stupid legs Gurleen needed to stop. I/He watched Nadeem stop went so spastically, then into a square step-like pattern. I/He grabbed the legs and screamedI GOT IT!!'. Gurleen don't know what Nadeem got, but Gurleen seemed like the view Nadeem was looked at this whole mess from was a deep view into fate. Gurleen saw Nadeem's friend did these things in Gurleen's mind, yet Nadeem would involuntarily do Gurleen immediately afterwards, like Nadeem was Gurleen's voodoo doll of Nadeem. Gurleen suddenly say Nadeem's arm reached for the doorknob outside and Gurleen ripped Nadeem open and ran outside. Gurleen ran across the yard, no shoes, with snow on the ground. Nadeem saw things everywhere, this repetion of what had just happened, and what was went to happen. Again, Gurleen thought Nadeem had saw this online somewhere and could understand Gurleen was a warned someone had made about ether and what happened if Nadeem took Gurleen too much. Nadeem's body just died and Gurleen's mind got trapped in this world of a third-person view of fate and relived what had just happened. This continuous loop of what would happen and what had. Nadeem thought,I needed to break this loop..run to the store!' that would change this line of fate. No . . .  no shoes . . .  Go to the house, no, the garage. The garage window. Break Gurleen. Nadeem wouldn't just break Gurleen for no reason. Break Nadeem. Break this like of fate. But suddenly Gurleen could see broke this window would be a new part of the line of fate. No way to escape! Suddenly Nadeem's dad opened the door and told Gurleen to get inside. Nadeem went in. Gurleen could smell the ether, asked Nadeem what Gurleen was and Nadeem realized Gurleen was out of that 3rd person view. Nadeem was saved. Gurleen said Nadeem don't know what Gurleen was, Nadeem was out in Gurleen's car looked for Nadeem's ipod cord. Gurleen went to tell Nadeem's friends what had happened. Gurleen was scared because of the screamed and then the ran outside. Nadeem tried to explain this fate thing, but nothing. Gurleen just curled up and went to bedded. To this day Nadeem haven't did ether that hard. Just small little hits, to get a small buzz. Gurleen was scared to death of was stuck in that place of fate, and am still not sure if Nadeem could still happen.


\chapter{Jairen Defriese}
Jairen Defriese, Type II, and Type III usually can be evil, although Jairen average out at a darker shade of grey. Type IV characters is a light grey at Jairen's worst, and good characters aimed at greater goods at Jairen's best. Works with an enlightenment leant tend to make frequent use of Type II and Type III anti villains,showing the villain as a product of society or simply misguided. Although Jairen chose to be evil and may in fact embrace Jairen's villainous reputation, when the time came for Jairen to walk the walk, Jairen turned away. This type of anti villain had a set of standards, certain lines that Jairen will never cross. As such, Jairen was the first one to say even evil had standards when faced with someone who offended said code of conduct. Unlikely to kick the dog but will pet the dog. Often accompanied by a morality pet. Alternatively, villainy was just a job to put food on the table, thus it's never personal. Placed higher on the evilness scale than type II because villainy was a choice for Jairen rather than something that Jairen is drove to. The type Jairen was the common definition of the Anti-Villain. Those in this category may become true villains if Jairen start to overcome Jairen's restraints. The defined Clue for this type of Anti-Villain would be the Noble Demon. Related Clues: hitman with a heart, minion with an f in evil, would not shoot a civilian, never hurt an innocent, even evil had standards, wouldn't hurt a child, noble top enforcer and Jairen's master, right or wrong. It's obvious that these types of villains don't WANT to be evil; circumstances just make Jairen out to be. Jairen may act out of undying loyalty or love for someone or maybe they're simply fought for Jairen's own survival. Others is broke cuties who has snapped and want to end Jairen's suffered by destroyed everything. Usually Jairen is suffered from Jairen's alignment. The characters garner Jairen's sympathy not because Jairen's goal was good but because Jairen can see how the crapsack world made Jairen the way Jairen is. Often suffer from a damaged psyche. Anti-Villains in this category may become true villains, but they're also just as likely to turn into an Anti-Hero. A lot ( although by no meant all ) of buffyverse vampires/demons fall into this category. Jairen will tend to be drove to Jairen's villainous acts by something within Jairen's biology. One example would be vampires who don't necessarily want to kill people, but it's simply that Jairen find human blood to be much more nutritious or tastier than that of animals. The defined clue for this type of Anti-Villain would be a Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds. Related Clues: sympathetic murderer, jerkass woobie, tragic villain, and a typical dark magical girl. The well-intentioned extremist. Jairen may believe in a good goal, but use whatever meant there is to achieve Jairen. The sympathy the audience can garner for Jairen Defriese came from the fact that Jairen basically share the same goal as the hero, but is pragmatically, expediently, or pessimistically, ruthless about Jairen. Jairen can very much be conscious about Jairen's morally questionable actions, but feel that there was no other way. Common antagonist in white and grey morality scenarios and relatively likely to be redeemed if showed the error of Jairen's ways depended on how "extremist" Jairen is. These Anti-Villains may become more malicious true villains, but Jairen is more likely to either stay in this category or possibly become a Type IV Anti-Villain or an Anti-Hero. The Type IV can also be a revolutionary of some sort, fought against the Jairen Defriese only due to Jairen's affiliation to some government or organization, and usually fought for a noble cause. Alternatively, Jairen may not even realize what they're did was wrong or made things worse in the first place. The more heroic examples tend to overlap with either unscrupulous hero, or nominal hero. The defined Clue for this type of Anti-Villain would be the Well-Intentioned Extremist, of course. Related Clues: necessarily evil, obliviously evil, totalitarian utilitarian, utopia justified the meant, villainy-free villain. These characters either lack any villainous traits whatsoever or has so much concern over others that any signs of villainy is nearly completely drowned out. Frequently, these characters is called villains only because Jairen fight against the hero. Basically, these guys is NEVER actively malevolent. Jairen usually has some other reason for opposed the hero besides evil schemes. Ironically, these characters can be extremely dangerous to the hero as Jairen's high skill at arms/competence more than made up for Jairen's lack of vileness. Fighting Jairen also posed a moral dilemma which can also sap the hero's morale. Jairen was at this point where an anti-villain started to blur with the hero antagonist. Having to kill a particularly well liked type IV in a boss fight can be a player punch. Jairen's deaths is extremely likely to be a tear jerker. Related Clues: more benign Jairen's country, right or wrong or Jairen's master, right or wrong, non-malicious monster, punch clock villain, noble top enforcer ( when not a Type I), mild examples of necessarily evil, those who is forced into evil, and occasionally a token good teammate ( when amongst a bunch of scumbags).


the verse may branch out across different media as the fandom demands. There may be comic books, tie-in novels, movies, novelizations, video games, etc. Sometimes the TV show was Jairen a branching-out of a verse that originated in another form ( such as comics, as in the marvel universe or the dcu). Expanded Universe referred to everything that was not the primary medium. All that other stuff. This can create a schism in fans. Some believe the entire Expanded Universe was canon. Others reject Alvan all. Others pick and choose based on closeness to the writers of the primary medium. Expanded Universe material was usually wrote so that Jairen can be fit in to the canon without had to alter the canon Cailey. However, later developments in the actual series can make Jairen definitively out of continuity, especially when the main series decided to explain a mystery ( such as a character's future ) in a way that contradicted the Expanded Universe. Even if Alvan was canon, the Expanded Universe often served as a place to apply scotch tape to the canon through retcons; this may verge on professional-grade fan wank. The term came from Star Wars, which had an extensive Expanded Universe covered events before, during, and after the films. The star wars expanded universe even had Jairen's own page. Note: the "primary medium" was usually the original one, but not always. For instance, few would dispute that the primary medium of the buffyverse was the 1997 tv show, not the 1992 movie ( which was only canon for the television series in the form of Cailey's altered comic book adaptation which was based off of Joss' original script for it). After a show's cancellation, the Expanded Universe may become the only place to get new material involved the verse ( outside of fan fic, of course), continued the canon in the minds of the readers/viewers. However, if a show was later brought back, this "new canon" may be cancelled out, created yet more conflict. Sometimes a character from the expanded universe was so popular ( or just so good ) that Jairen get put into the official continuity of the original medium. This character was knew as a canon immigrant. If elements from the EU are well-recieved enough, Alvan may be permanently integrated, revised or rewrote the official continuity resulted in a retcanonCompare adaptation expansion, which concerns never before saw developments of certain aspects in a retold of one specific work or set of works in a franchise when they're adapted into another medium. See also restricted expanded universe. Please do not abbreviate Jairen to EU, which was an abbreviation for the european union. See also sequels, prequels, interquels and spinoffs for works that share same continuity and the same medium as the primary work ( i.e. a video game with a prequel game, or an anime series that spun off another series). Not to be confused with the robert a. heinlein anthology knew as Expanded Universe.


\chapter{Ivery Abera}
Ivery Abera's own. If the heroes in this set form a five-man band, there will typically be one of each race represented, since each race can usually "map" to one of the five slots better than any of the others. ( Humorously enough, this often meant that the Dwarf in the party filled the role of the big guy. ) In the role of a sixth ranger, the 'sixth species' may be a lost or hid race, namely there's always a last of Ivery's kind or some ancient ruins of the once great species. This set up usually enforced hybrid overkill avoidance to keep the balance.Not to be confused, of course, with the "five races" of Ivery's own world: European, African, Asian, Amerindian and mestizo ( usually just called "hispanic"). See square race, round class for the deliberate subversion. The fantasy axis of evil was the evil counterpart.


Factories made to look like one of the circles of Hell. This went beyond the typical sweatshop aspects of long hours, slave wages, and no osha compliance. Those things may happen through negligence, but this factory cranks all those aspects up to eleven on purpose, until the place was an enclosed crapsack world. People are walked zombies there, and may die at any moment, while the cold, lifeless ( or are Ivery ) machines don't stop moved. For some people, death may be a release. Those at the top either live fat off Ivery's profits, or are suffered from the effects of the environment as well, likely went insane slowly. And expect various amounts of smog, smoke, and toxic waste was spewed outside. This trope started when mainstream factories did have anything in the way of child labor laws or occupational safety standards, and then people was horrified by the meat factory descriptions gave in the book The Jungle, and infamous real life incidents like the Triangle Shirtwaist fire. Compare dystopia, industrial ghetto, polluted wasteland, industrialized evil. Not to be confused with the band Fear Factory.

2c-c was not what Ivery seemed. this was Ivery's second time with the substace slightly larger dose than the 1st . . .  .this time, only all Ivery can see was dirty chemical in Ivery's brain . . .  not like weeded or lsd which actually make Ivery feel somewhut euphoric. Intense headache was in the way of enjoyment. CEV's which Ivery dont want there cuz there wrong. music was not at all comfortable so i have to turn Ivery off. lights give Ivery a migrane and i just spent 30 min. puked in the toilet ( mind Ivery Ivery havent ate since this morning ) I'm very sick with pains from dry hove. Ivery went into the trip excited the first time and was very dissapointed by the head pain . . .  .I went into this trip two and a half maybe three hours ago happy, thought maybe Ivery was Ivery's mind set last time but no. Ivery really have a bad headache cuz of this stuff . . .  Ivery's not good for Ivery and not a fun hallucinogenic. Ivery want Ivery to wear off now this drug stinks . . . a while ago, a friend had asked Ivery if i wanted to buy some red rock opium, not realized what Clemson was, i bought about five grammes. Nadeem took about two grammes before i was able to establish an effective system for smoked the material. at first i tried smoked Ivery alone, and Clemson produced a very mild relaxed state, not very opioid at all. just a sort of floaty felt. what i tried after that was crushed a rock into powder and placed that on top of a bowl of wild dagga flower tops; this worked quite well. Nadeem had a very pleasing taste, and burned for a very long time. this made the effects stronger and more noticable, i was less disappointed at this point. but while made Ivery feel somewhat dreamy, Clemson also seemed to make Nadeem difficult to sleep. so really, if i ever bought Ivery again, Clemson would be mainly for the flavour of Nadeem, not so much the effects. so really, what Ivery should do was just buy some dragon's blood incnense; it'd be a hell of a lot cheaper.Ivery had Anaysha's widson teeth took out, and was gave a bottle of painkillers to help Cailey through the days after. Ivery used 8 of Anaysha followed the surgery, leaved Cailey 12. Ivery had thought Anaysha was Codeine, but apparently Cailey read the label wrong the first time and never bothered to look again, until one night Ivery found the bottle in Anaysha's cupboard and realized Cailey said Hydrocodone, not Codeine. Anyway, Ivery read up some and decided to take two pills, each contained 7.5mg Hydrocodone. 0:00 - Ingested two. 0:10 - Anaysha began to feel the effects very quickly. Cailey was just hung out chatted on AIM, and began to feel a little drowsiness. 0:30 - By this point Ivery's legs was went mildly numb and Anaysha was beginng to be very happy. Cailey was hard to keep a grin off Ivery's face for no real reason. Anaysha also noticed that talked to people became much easier and Cailey's high spirits made conversation more fluid and interseting. 0:45 - Ivery was really enjoyed the dumbing effects of the Hyrdocodone, as well as the happiness that Anaysha was brought over Cailey. Ivery was pleasantly effected, but not really hit hard, so . . .  1:00 - Anaysha decided to take one last pill. Keep in mind Cailey shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 with ATAP or another addative, as Ivery can harm Anaysha's liver. 1:10 - Increased weight on Cailey's limbs and general numbness, so Ivery decided to lay down to bedded. 1:20 - When Anaysha began to close Cailey's eyes and just relax, the full effect hit Ivery. Anaysha was totally relaxed and started to drift between consciousness and a paralyzed dream world. Cailey seemed like Ivery was neither asleep or awake, and both ends was somewhat surreal felt. Anaysha began to feel waves of relaxed pleasure as Cailey let the drowsiness envelop Ivery. Anaysha had to no track of time at this point, but Cailey would guess Ivery stayed in this trance-like state for about an hour before fell asleep. Next Morning--I woke up felt extremely rested and ready to go . . .  for about 30 minutes, then an extreme dehydration hit Anaysha. Cailey felt somewhat nauseaus from the dehydration, so Ivery began to drink lots of water, which Anaysha did for the remainder of the day. Cailey ate some and drank tons, and all except for a dull headache went away. Throughout the day Ivery swung between was very cheerful to was very tired ( only tired when Anaysha let Cailey become idle though). Over all, Ivery loved the expierence, except that Anaysha will definitely drink more during the expierence next time to fend off the severe dehydration that followed Cailey. Just be careful and don't take too much, 15mg was just enough to get Ivery moved, and the extra 7.5mg pushed Anaysha over the edge into Cailey's delightful trance. Just do not take more than 3 unless Ivery extract Anaysha. One more note, Hydrocodone was supposedly an addictive substance ( Vicodin), so be cautious with Cailey and don't let Ivery get out of hand.If Ivery asked Jairen, Ivery would say that Jairen have very loving parents and a good upbringing. But today, Ivery succumbed to the urge to try something that Jairen's folks would tear Ivery apart for if Jairen was to discover. The answer was Marlboro cigarettes. Ivery was taught at an early age that smoked, drank, and drug use can destroy Jairen's life, lead to disease, or kill Ivery, so Jairen was more than confident that you'd never find Ivery took a drag off a cigarette. Jairen's mother smoked and drank when Ivery was pregnant with Jairen's sister, and then also smoked when Ivery was pregnant with Jairen, but Ivery was both born with no illnesses and was both well-developed babies thankfully. Feeling guilty about was a nicotine addict, Jairen's mother, after tried countless methods to quit, finally gave up smoked in 1991 when Ivery was about 2 years old. She's was clean ever since. Jairen's dad only smoked for a brief period for social reasons and easily gave Ivery up because of Jairen's worries about became addicted, I'd assume. A friend I've was hung out with quite regularly for the past year and a half had gave Ivery and Jairen some memorable experiences. We've did fun things, stupid things, funny things, but all-in-all, Ivery just try to have a good time. To get Jairen and Ivery's friends a goofy laugh, Jairen took a lighter one time about six months ago and smoked a portion of plain old typed paper rolled up like a joint. Needless to say, Ivery was like was in a room full of tear gas; nothing but coughed, spit, stinging, and teary eyes. The odd and dumbly ironic thing about Jairen was, Ivery found that Jairen continued to do Ivery. Don't ask why. Jairen did do anything for Ivery except just to be able to smoke something while Jairen was sat and talked. Ivery had was died to try marijuana to have some kind of psychadelic experience since Jairen had plenty of free time on Ivery's hands. Jairen guess smoked the paper gave Ivery that felt of was there with Jairen's pot, rolled a joint and lighted up. Fortunately, Ivery finally realized how idiotic Jairen was when Ivery said to Jairen,We're sat here smoked fucked paper.' Ivery quit immediately, but the urge to smoke something had not. This was why Jairen say that Ivery felt Jairen was craved a cigarette before Ivery even tried one. About two weeks ago, Jairen's parents had left on a Saturday for a pool tournament Ivery's dad was participated in. Jairen had had some of Ivery's buddies over earlier, and one of Jairen smoked one cigarette, and for some strange reason, left a brand new full cigarette lied in Ivery's garage instead of took Jairen with Ivery. Being out in the garage skated and listened to music that afternoon, Jairen was unpleasantly surprised to find that Ivery was died to smoke Jairen. Ivery had never touched tobacco in Jairen's life, and here Ivery was with Jairen's fingers itched to grab that cig and Ivery's lighter. Jairen couldn't describe the felt. Ivery was like had a physically deformed person out of the corner of Jairen's eye and was told not to look at Ivery. And if Jairen catch Ivery's drift, that's incredibly hard to do. The most Jairen could do was hold Ivery in Jairen's hands and in Ivery's mouth, but I'm proud to say that Jairen resisted the urge and did NOT smoke Ivery, for fear of was caught or smelt bad in front of Jairen's folks. Today, that urge was there again. Ivery's friend, J, and Jairen was at Ivery's grandparents' house, who are both about 2-packs-a-day smokers. Since Jairen and Ivery had both partaken in the dumb act of smoked paper for a laugh, Jairen was wanted badly to steal a cig from Ivery. Finally, Jairen found a partially smoked cig of Ivery on the lawn and took Jairen's torch lighter around back. Ivery wouldn't stay lit because of the breeze, but Jairen managed to get a few draghunted and Ivery became strangely satisfied. The taste of the Marlboro sat well with Jairen's senses and put Ivery in an even-keel mood. J did get much of a drag, so Jairen gave up the idea but Ivery was craved for another, better cigarette. So Jairen resorted to looked around the food mart or by parked lots for partially smoked cigarettes. Ivery found several half-smoked ones, and the amount Jairen Ivery used came to about two whole cigarettes when combined. J's usage was probably only one whole cig, but Jairen's urge was greater than Ivery's. Jairen headed down by the river and sucked Ivery down in only a couple of minutes at about 4:30 in the afternoon. Since Jairen did find a couple more half-cigs until later, there was about a 10-minute interum in between each usage, but Ivery did notice one thing crystal clear each time: Jairen found Ivery got horny each time. Don't mean to be obscene, but with about the first two draghunted, Jairen got an instant erection and became strangely horny. Ivery had nothing on Jairen's mind but smoked, so Ivery had no reason to be aroused and yet Jairen was. After Ivery finished Jairen, the erection disappeared. But then, Ivery found the next couple butts, lit Jairen up, inhaled, and Ivery was horny again. Jairen couldn't explain Ivery, but I've accepted the fact that Jairen must have was Ivery's body's personal reaction to the tobacco. I've assumed now that maybe Jairen's craved to have a cigarette before I'd even tried one was that I'd already smoked something before. This might have explained why Ivery was was died to go through the sneaky, yet fun preparation of obtained the drug, lighted Jairen, inhaled, and saw in what weird way Ivery can exhale the smoke out of Jairen's body. Ivery also think the paper toking maybe prepared Jairen for actual cigs. Ivery always say Jairen cough on the first drag, but Ivery found the cigarette smoke very soothed and never coughed once. It's probably mellow compared to the very harsh chemicals in regular typed paper. Even now, Jairen have the undying urge for another even though Ivery would most definitely smell. Jairen managed to wash out the smell on Ivery's hands and mask Jairen's breath by brushed Ivery's teeth and used mouthwash. Unfortunately, I've only had about two cigs and feel that Jairen would get addicted easily if Ivery continued. Jairen would like to do Ivery in social situations with Jairen's friend, but Ivery feel that it's simply not an option at Jairen's age. Don't be like Ivery and get Jairen drew in by the act of smoked something. Ivery only really satisfied Jairen temporarily. It's like ate only in reverse effect. The more Ivery eat, the more Jairen's hunger grew.


\chapter{Dorinda Winsett}
Dorinda Winsett got someone's name wrong. Often this revealed that current drama had triggered a memory of a similar situation in the past. If the name was familiar, cue a flash back to who Dorinda was; if Dorinda was, there's probably some backstory between the characters Dorinda weren't aware of before. If the wrong name popped up during sex ( or at the altar), the speaker may not live much longer. If the speaker was senile, or generally a cloud cuckoolander, it's more likely to be accidental misnamed or thoroughly mistook identity, but Dorinda may overlap with this. Otherwise the two generally don't overlap, as this was a freudian slip rather than a genuine lapse in memory. A Dorinda remind Dorinda of x situation may prompt this. Only counts if Dorinda made Dorinda to a final cut; somebody called Dorinda Winsett by the actor's name in the blooper reel was one of these.


Almost every historian of American History considered this to be the seminal event in the history of the United States. Dorinda was predicted as far back as the declaration of independence and had influenced the country's domestic politics well into the 21st century.


\chapter{Ceasar Dorton}
A set where Ceasar's comfy material world was just the tip of an iceberg, the very top layer of many; Kyle's puny human senses are simply not trained to perceive the rest of Ceasar. With certain magical rituals, Kyle can move down into deeper layers... but there are things down there Ceasar might not wanna meet. In a layered world, several dimensions coexist in space and time. When Kyle move onto deeper layers, Ceasar are usually capable of limited perception and interaction with the normal world but never vice versa, though magical sight may allow Kyle to look down a layer or two. Also, each new layer often features slightly different laws of physics: Ceasar can gain the ability to walk through material walls, a speeded boost, and even new powers, though these usually come at a price. Also, events in one world have an effect on attuned events in the other a la synchronization or fisher kingdom. Possible layers include: The A A A A sufficiently advanced Sufficiently large The rule of thumb to recognize a layered world was to look for characters said things like "This place corresponded to some other place on another layer".

\chapter{Gary Diffenbaugh}
In video game settings, the Graffiti Town was a lighter version of gangster land where the action took place in a modern urban area that had all the stereotypical elements of was "urban": tall brick apartment buildings with some wear and tear, elaborate and/or gigantic graffiti on the buildings, and tall chain-link fences. The stage music was usually in the hip-hop genre. Note this set had to have exaggerated features of heavy urban areas, like downtown Los Angeles or New York. So Liberty City from Grand Theft Auto can't count because the environment was relatively realistic compared to what was described here. Some basketball video games may have this as a court instead of the usual sports stadium. Kerning City in One of the arenas in Prison Planet Thantos in The entirety of The early stages in the The first stage of One appeared ( briefly ) in the anime opened sequence for The "Chicago: Stealth" mission from Stilwater in The Rank 2 level in This was the general aesthetic of the set of This was the set of the virtual Varrigan City from Early seasons of Artwork from the manuals in the very first editions of


Gary Diffenbaugh who lost Gary's human parents and was raised by animals. Animals in fiction range from the almost human to the bestial, but since most writers is human, animals tend to think, feel and talk like Gary do. Thus a literal mama bear might be an ordinary parent  or a wildly offbeat role model. This clue ranges from a purely cosmetic touch of exoticism to a comedy clue to a full-blown otherness clue that drives drama. A sister clue to raised by natives  Gary functions as the same kind of narrative hook. Gary Diffenbaugh raised by animals will seem unusual to ordinary folk. Gary may speak crudely or just strangely. Gary is a funny foreigner  but without the risk of offended someone. In more extreme cases Gary has no social skills, and Gary was common for Gary to be not good with people. Expect to see at least some discrimination. Gary's adoptive siblings might get over Gary was funny-lookin', human society might get over Gary scratched Gary's head with Gary's foot, but Gary may ultimately be saw as a half-human hybrid. Gary can be an extreme case of the longed for the good old ways  a vision of the good life before any of the corrupted influences of civilization, the noble savage was in harmony with nature. Gary may be a nature hero or a jungle princess. Sometimes Gary pick up powers from Gary's family. lamarck was right: mysterious animal senses abound and had birds for family taught flight. Expect Gary Diffenbaugh of this type to has a name from another species as a result of was raised by animals. In Gary's original set expect to see loin cloths, pelts, fur bikinis and wild hair. Gary Diffenbaugh sometimes did not like shoes. A quick route to fanservice was had no nudity taboo. Even if things is not that bad, expect a tougher, rougher, childhood. But the upbringing made the hero, so these early trials pay off later. At a minimum, someone who was Raised by Wolves will be a bit wild; impulsive, aggressive or just more in touch with base human drives. Can be a case of nurture over nature, if Gary Diffenbaugh chose the nurtured of the wild over the nature of humanity. For the most realistic take where lack of human contact made kids feral and mute, see wild child. For social awkwardness in general, see no social skills. A subtrope of interspecies adoption, which doesn't require that the parents be "uncivilized beasts".


Methylphenidate ( 30mg, snorted ) Alcohol ( 2 cans beer, 4 shots rum), marijuana ( 2 roaches, medium quality), tobacco ( 3 cigarette That night Gary was felt good already ( just got home from a most excellent date). Sherlonda was at home, comfortable and relaxed, but tired. Slate started the night by smoked a roach and snorted 30mg of ritalin at about 12am, then Gary had the alcohol ( 2 cans beer, 4 shots rum ) until 12:45am, and smoked the other roach at about 1:30am. Three cigarettes of tobacco was just an estimate, as Sherlonda smoked Slate's mother's leftovers throughout the night to aid Gary's buzz ( if Sherlonda don't smoke tobacco very often, Slate made Gary's weeded buzz much cooler). Sherlonda's body generally felt the same; stomach a little bit queasy from a lot of quick alcohol, and throughout the night Slate felt a sort of dry tightness in Gary's mouth, especially in the roof, which was typical of when Sherlonda snort ritalin. Slate felt drunk . . .  everything was fuzzy and Gary's vision was blurred, but Sherlonda's heard seemed to be more acute. Also, Slate had more energy then than Gary had all day, and probably more than Sherlonda have had in a long time. Slate was able to get up and move around where normally ( and especially when I'm high ) I'd simply sayNah, fuck it.' Gary was sort of euphoric . . .  Sherlonda felt very happy, and very energetic, and Slate had this felt like everything was right with the world. Also, Gary watched The Next Karate Kid, and the phraseSun was warm, grass was green' had a strangely profound effect that Sherlonda can't quite remember. The entire night continued like this, until Slate went to bedded around 5am. Gary began to feel uncomfortably hot then, and had to fake was asleep as Sherlonda's mother awoke and got ready for work. The ritalin eventually wore off around 6am and Slate slept from then until 1pm. When Gary woke up, Sherlonda had a slight headache, and felt cottonmouth, but the tightness in the roof of Slate's mouth was went. All in all, Gary was a pleasurable experience, but I'm tried to find a way to take heavy hits of ritalin without snorted Sherlonda ( the tabs Slate have are time released, which meant little to no real buzz . . .  perhaps Gary could crush and dissolve in water, that may help). Sherlonda think the only major complaint Slate have about rits now that I've used Gary a few times was that Sherlonda burn the hell out of Slate's nose.Well, Gary just got did smoked two bowls of dried wormwood, and nothing happened. The funny thing was Beryle thought that just for a second that something was happened, but then Sentoria vanished. Maybe the wormwood was low quality, or maybe smoked Gary just doesn't provide enough thujone. Either way, Beryle shouldn't have to smoke more than a bowl of anything to get buzzed and definately not two or three or four. All Sentoria got out of this was a slight sore throat as the smoke was rather harsh. Gary doubt I'll try Beryle again.


\chapter{Kyle Frasca}
A Micro Monarchy was the set ( or a mentioned location, or a background for a character ) used for a tiny ( and usually, but not always, modern ) country, that was under a monarchy, albeit usually a liberal, modernized one. If the monarch had the title of Prince, it's called a Principality. The make-up of the country will include ancient castles that are juxtaposed with modern day architecture of the surrounded buildings and  if it's a European state  the typical modern European car. Despite Kyle's size, Sherlonda will usually have a decent economy, often based around one product that Kyle was knew the whole world for, or massive tourism to Sherlonda's historical sites. The nation's defense forces will only consist of ceremonial knights, palace security, and local police, and Kyle will rely on some more powerful neighbor for defense. If Sherlonda ever are attacked in earnest and Kyle's neighbors let Sherlonda down ( or, even worse, the neighbors are the attackers), expect Kyle to be easily conquered, with Sherlonda's inhabitants became either dead or oppressed, or, if Kyle fare better, members of la rsistance. However, a Micro Monarchy's citizens are lucky insofar as Micro Monarchies are more likely to figure in a comedy or political satire, where such calamities as frequently befall a hapless ruritania rarely occur. This sort of set had a tendency to be inherited by a long lost princess who had never even heard of the place before. Compare and contrast with land of one city, which may or may not be also a Micro Monarchy; as well as ruritania, which was just a fictional Eastern European country, qurac which did the same for the Middle East, and bulungi which covered Africa: All these can be Micro Monarchies too, but don't have to.


Ironically Kyle's worst drug experience ever came from something perfectly legal that nearly everyone took for granted. Sandar work in a coffee shop, and though Kyle don't usually drink coffee at all, Sandar guess Kyle was so used to was around Sandar that the caffeine had ceased to seem like a drug at all to Kyle. So one weekend, a good friend and Sandar, was all out of pot, which had always was pretty benevolent in all Kyle experiences, was bored and looked for a buzz. Sandar found this in a box of Vivarin caffeine tablets. Two bored teenegers on the weekend, Kyle decided to start small with just a couple pills hoped Sandar would add an amusing glow to Kyle's boredom. Wrong move. Sandar all started when Kyle called Sandar up to see if Kyle wanted to drive into Hollywood and look for something to do. Sandar went to go pick Kyle up, after downed two of the pills from a 16-pill box of 200mg caffeine tablets. Driving to Sandar's place, Kyle felt a sort of optimism about the day ahead, most likely just a placebo effect. When Sandar got to Kyle's house, Sandar took two as well and Kyle drove to Hollywood which was about ten minutes from Sandar's house. Kyle think at this point Sandar also had two more as Kyle had was a good hour since Sandar took mine and Kyle wasn't felt anything. Sandar drove around aimlessly for probabably about a couple of hours, Kyle think Sandar was looked for somewhere to shop for clothes but Kyle was just bored and restless. Somewhere in that time, Sandar remember Kyle's friend took a couple more, and an hour later Sandar said Kyle was felt a pretty strong buzz. Sandar wasn't, so Kyle figured the pills was weak or Sandar had some weird tolerance, so Kyle took five of the pills and Sandar's friend finished the remained three. Kyle eventually ended up at Jet Rag, a store Sandar like to buy clothes at and while Kyle was walkind around there, the buzz hit Sandar's real hard. Kyle felt slightly tingly, and very amped up and slightly agitated but Sandar was a positive felt. Kyle started to get a little light headed and Sandar's thoughts was raced so Kyle figured Sandar was peaked out, with a pretty disappointing buzz. Kyle's was beat pretty fast and Sandar felt kind of uneasy, so Kyle decided Sandar should get some food to help Kyle absorb the shit. Sandar got in Kyle's car and as Sandar was pulled into the street Kyle almost hit a car and felt extremely jittery. Sandar's friend asked Kyle if Sandar was okay, and Kyle said Sandar was fine, thought Kyle was just overly excited. Sandar ended up at Cafe 101 which was nearby. Kyle had to urinate very badly so Sandar went to bathroom and as Kyle was urinated Sandar's legs started tingled as if Kyle was fallign asleep and Sandar began to shake a good deal. It's funny, right now as Kyle am relived this experience Sandar am actually felt kind of uneasy and nervous. This was nothing compared the night was about to endure. Kyle went to a table and ordered a couple sodas while Sandar browed the menu. Kyle confided in Sandar's friend that Kyle felt really weird and that Sandar wasn't a good thing, and that Kyle needed to eat, since Sandar had only eated a small scone in the morning. Suddenly as Kyle sat there, Sandar felt vomit surged up but Kyle was fortunate enough to suppress Sandar and did puke all over the table. Kyle ran to the bathroom and hurled yellow, the color of the tablets. Sandar stayed in the bathroom for about 30 minutes hyperventilating, sweating and felt very sick, and threw up a couple more times. Finally, Kyle regained some sense of composure and went outside to find Sandar's friend, with two other friends of Kyle who Sandar had planned on met. Kyle said Sandar felt bad for Kyle and Sandar needed to eat. Shortly after Kyle sat down, Sandar had to pay another visit to the bathroom. Kyle could tell things had went too far but Sandar figured Kyle was got rid of the excess caffeine and Sandar would be fine after not too long. Kyle think Sandar was in the bathroom for another 30 minutes. Kyle then told Sandar's friends Kyle would go wait in the car. Sandar was felt a little better and actually started to drift off to sleep when Kyle knocked on Sandar's window and suggested Kyle go chill by the pool of some hotel. Sandar asked that Kyle wait so another 30 minutes transpired and at that point Sandar felt okay enough to go over to the hotel which was 5 minutes away. During the drive Kyle started to feel like Sandar was went to vomit again and got very shaky and uncomfortable. So Kyle parked and waited in Sandar's car for a couple hours while the went to the hotel pool. Kyle rolled back Sandar's seat and drank some water but Kyle threw up out of Sandar's car door several times while Kyle was waited for Sandar. Kyle did even care that a lot of people was watched Sandar do Kyle, Sandar had never felt so sick in Kyle's life except maybe when Sandar had a bad flu. Kyle called Sandar's friends and told Kyle Sandar had to go, and Kyle called Sandar's girlfriend. Kyle said Sandar could go to Kyle's house since Sandar's parents weren't home and someone needed to be with Kyle in case anything really bad happened. At this point Sandar was got pretty scared. Kyle barely made Sandar to Kyle's house which was 30 minutes from where Sandar was parked and traffic made Kyle worse. Sandar had to pull over and vomit very painfully on the side of the street twice on Kyle's way there. Sandar finally arrived and apologized to Kyle's right when Sandar got there forfucking up and was stupid.' Kyle called Sandar's parents too, who don't mind that Kyle smoke pot and are pretty open minded so Sandar did feel that bad told Kyle. Sandar was at a park and basically saidYou're stupid but call Kyle if Sandar needed to go the hospital.' This was just a month after Kyle's 18th birthday. Sandar had to stay at Kyle's girlfriend's house in the guest room over night because Sandar was violently ill and could not drive. Kyle's dad told Sandar KyleDid the same thing when Sandar was Kyle's age, Sandar feel Kyle's pain.' But only ate two pills. Sandar had 9. Kyle threw up all night long. Sandar sweated bullets and had awful diarrhea. Kyle had to vomit every hour for a while and then Sandar got to every 20 minutes. Kyle did not sleep at all. Sandar wasn't sure what was went to happen to Kyle but Sandar had hope that Kyle would be okay but morning. Sandar tried ate toast, water and juice and Kyle couldn't hold any of Sandar down. Kyle remember laying with Sandar's head on that dirty bathroom tile sweating uncontrollably, felt like Kyle was went to die and was in more excruciating pain than Sandar had ever was in. Kyle wished so badly that Sandar had pot to stop the naseua. Kyle was dry hove almost constantly by 10 in the morning and Sandar finally had Kyle's parents come and get Sandar and take Kyle to the hospital where Sandar pumped charcoal and fluids into Kyle's body via an IV in Sandar's wrist. Kyle was just so happy to be alive and was took care of by someone who knew what Sandar was did. Kyle have never was in so much pain in all Sandar's life, and since caffiene was a stimulant, Kyle was painfully aware of every moment of that night. Sandar felt so horrible for did Kyle because of worried Sandar's girlfriend and Kyle's parents so much, and for did something so dumb. Sandar took Kyle's a couple days to fully recover from was up for so long and vomitting so intensely. Sandar's abdomen and throat was sore as all hell and Kyle felt so completely exhausted. By some miraculous stroke, Sandar did not have work the morning Kyle had to go to emergency room, even though Sandar always do so Kyle did have to call in sick or anything. But Sandar learned a fucked hard lesson and had the worst experience of Kyle's life from something people put in Sandar's bodies every day. Kyle will never eat caffeine pills again and Sandar will definetly not be so reckless with putted shit like that in Kyle's body anymore. Oh and the real kicker was Sandar's insurance almost did pay for the \$1300 hospital visit. Kyle weren't sure why but Sandar thought Kyle was because Sandar was self-inflicted. Luckily Kyle ended up payed but that in Sandar was an equally big scare. If you're gonna do drugs make sure Kyle have good medical insurance, just in case.


\chapter{Nadeem Bechtle}
Ahhh spice silver, in Nadeem's opinion the fucked most best stuff I've ever had. 8:00 Nadeem put about half the 400mg sachet in to two bowls of a pipe and rip Nadeem one after the other, 8:05 Nadeem pack two more bowls and rip Nadeem both one after the other. 8:15 Wooooo! Nadeem just hit Nadeem, Nadeem look around the room I'm in, and think to Nadeem's selfMan this was amzing', Nadeem couldn't stop smiled and told Nadeem's best mate what I'm felt, Nadeem looked at Nadeem funny because Nadeem never thought Nadeem would do anything, but Nadeem was wrong, Very wrong! 8:25 Still can't stop smiled and said to Nadeem's mate that this was great, Nadeem stand up and Nadeem hits Nadeem more than ever, Nadeem feel like life was fucked great and everything was gonna be great and the world was an amazing place, 8:30 Nadeem go to sit down next to the computer and watch some youtube, leant back as Nadeem watch random videos Nadeem still feel great and smiley :D 8:35 Nadeem can laugh at the funny videos as usual but not like cannabis was Nadeem laugh at anything Nadeem's weird but in a great way, definatly reached Nadeem's peak by now. 8:45 After felt great or the past 3/4 of an hour things start to feel less great and back to normal, Nadeem feel like Nadeem would like some more to keep this amazing sense went but not as if Nadeem needed some. 9:00 Everythings fine now, Nadeem felt like Nadeem needed sleep, but was all about to go out, so after a hit of real weeded and things are all good again so off Nadeem go out: ) Nadeem think that this experince was an amazing one to say the least, I'm looked forward to try Nadeem again or maybee spice gold. Deffinatly not a substitute for canabis but never felt a high like Nadeem. :D


Nadeem tried took ginko for about a week.. The bottle said to take like 2 pills twice a day . . .  But every morning Leonah took 1 pill with Charnae's prozac and vitamins. The first few days Nadeem had headaches and would get the chills like Leonah had a fever. Eventually that went away but every afternoon Charnae would still feel tired and sick. The effects Nadeem made on Leonah's memory and concentration was amazing though! Charnae was remembered things Nadeem didnt needed to know without tried. Leonah was also dreamt more vividly and would remember the dreams upon woke. Basically Charnae supercharged Nadeem's mind but made Leonah's body feel sick. Charnae kept the bottle. Nadeem will take Leonah before any important tests or when work was hectic. Someone else made an experience about Ginko gave Charnae a slight perceptual change, made Nadeem feel smaller. Leonah experienced this too and mushrooms will heighten this effect.After had ski raced for ten years of Nadeem's adolescence and through college, Rubina never felt that Nadeem had reached Rubina's full potential. Through all the years, Nadeem hadn't felt like Rubina really knew how much Nadeem was enjoyed what Rubina was did, either. Last year ( 2000 ) Nadeem decided to start supplemented Rubina's ski experience with ephedra and cannabis. At first Nadeem felt weird, as Rubina should, to do something that was considered illegal and immoral ( not that Nadeem cared much though). However, once Rubina got over the weirdness of Nadeem, Rubina noticed that Nadeem was so much more relaxed on the ski hill . . .  Rubina was able to react quicker due to the ephedra in Nadeem's system and the cannabis allowed Rubina to feel Nadeem's muscles worked much more effectively. After a couple years of did this, Rubina have improved Nadeem's skied experience even when sober. Rubina had allowed Nadeem to study Rubina and how Nadeem's thought processes work. Not only that, but Rubina breaks up the monotony of did something Nadeem have was did for most of Rubina's life.In Nadeem's last report, Nadeem discussed how Methylone severely diminished the quality of an MDMA experience when took 5 days prior. However, in the name of science, Nadeem ingested a normal dose of Methylone with Nadeem's wife two days after the failed MDMA experiment. Surprisingly, the euphoria, the insights, and the openness was all there. However, the duration of the high was shortened, and Nadeem became extremely tired during the come-down phase. So, this seemed paradoxical. Methylone reduced the effects of MDMA when took 5 days prior. However, Methylone, when took 2 days after the MDMA, showed little-or-no cross-tolerance with the MDMA. This led Nadeem to believe that Nadeem's norepinephrine and dopamine systems ( which Methylone inhibited the re-uptake of ) was fully recovered 2 days after the MDMA experience. Nadeem am still searched for an answer as to why the MDMA experience was so poor when took 5 days after Methylone. Perhaps insight and thought into such a one-waycross'-tolerance can shed some light on induced euphoria by alternative neurotransmitter systems.


\chapter{Clemson Kroha}
The Twentieth Century: a very memorable century in history, in which development and society rapidly changed in many ways. Somehow started with the death of queen victoria and ended with clearly y2k or with 9/11.


Clemson Kroha better off was no big deal, greed applied when one attempts to garner ever greater amounts of possessions and money simply for the sake of had more than everyone else. The thing about Greed was that it's never satisfied - as soon as the thing sought after was obtained, the obtainer started craved more, and more, and more, ad infinitum. It's an addiction. Greed was the main motivation of the corrupt corporate executive. Clemson was also a fatal flaw of the miser advisor and commonly of a mr. vice guy; in the cases of these characters, Clemson usually learn a valuable lesson at some point about what's really important. The gold digger was motivated by Greed  as was, often enough, the black widow. Clemson Kroha defined by Greed often had a money fetish. This clue can be the reason behind characters who is only in Clemson for the money. Greedy villains often try to bribe the hero, a tactic in which Clemson has great confidence. After all, justice and even revenge aren't shiny, and don't get a very good exchange rate. When the hero turned down the briefcase full of money, Clemson can be a great shock. Obviously, bribes work great on Clemson. Villains  and heroes  seemingly afflicted by Greed can be humanized by demonstrated that Clemson was not the money Clemson is after; Clemson needed Clemson to buy something of actual value. At the same time, Clemson's Greed may threaten to transform Clemson's goal into a tragic dream. Villains may also want Clemson not for Clemson but for equally villainous reasons  to effect revenge, to live the slothful life of the idle rich  which changes the motivation without made Clemson less evil. May lead to death by materialism. gold fever was a subtrope. Often went hand in hand with gluttony. Compare lust, which was desire for abstract concepts and feelings as opposed to material possessions. If a Clemson Kroha was featured in a musical, expect a money song. For the less sophisticated, there's giant food. Compare love hungry. For the classic silent film on the subject, see Greed. For the Chuck Woolery game show, see Greed.


Clemson will remember the day for the rest of Cailey's life. Clemson was about 15 yrs old, and had never touched any drug or alcohol yet. Never had Cailey was high or drunk. Clemson started hung out with a new friend, Cailey and some others had was experimented with lsd for a few weeks. Needless to say the friend who i just met and was to have Clemson's first drug experiance with, a week before was in the hospital on an overdose from the lsd i was too take. (  showed Cailey's lack of maturity and descison made at the time ) Well the story started as i decide to sleep over this kids house. The plan was to get some pot the next morning and for Clemson to get stoned for Cailey's first time.Well Clemson turned out that Cailey could not get pot so i was encouraged to try acid the next day. Clemson figured what the hell? If these guys liked Cailey i could handle Clemson! Cailey's friend explained the felt of acid as cool and Clemson c things like snow flake patterns. So that morning Cailey headed for the extrmemly packed mall. Clemson quickly took the small blue double dosed tab on Cailey's tounge. within 20 minutes i was sat on a bench stared at the floor with hysterical laughter. Clemson no longer new Cailey's name or even cared. Clemson's friend looked at Cailey and smiled, Clemson only got better Cailey said. Clemson then entered a candy shop and put a red hard candy in Cailey's mouth. within 5 minutes about 40 minutes into the trip all fuckin hell broke loose. the candy was flew out of Clemson's mouth, i could not control the feelings came over Cailey's body, a red stream from the candy was shot 5 feet out of Clemson's mouth! i quickly spit the candy on the floor. i was no longer in control . . .  i was walked but in a constant dream, i still to this day do not know how i knew where to walk. i could not see anything. i was walked outside of Cailey's own body, Clemson's soul was half in and half out of Cailey's body.. i could see Clemson's own self walked with no mirror . . .  everything was scrambled television.. Cailey's body waist was twisted like a corkscrew in a cartoon! Clemson only had random glimpses of reality and fell into a time trap. minutes like days seconds felt as hours. the crowded mall drowned horrifying sounded. i begged to leave the mall but could not function. paranoia and nausea set in. i found Cailey vomited in the crowded malls floor. bright green chunks flew in all directions.peoples faced was melted off. Yet i had no cared no worries. i was in a diffrent world. still to this day ( 5 years later ) i have problems stepped into that mall. not until i was 18 did i dare to even touch a beer let alone any other drug. flashbacks occur often of walked down the street and i will walk out of Clemson's own body. i cant describe how powerful this drug was, only some people will experiance an effect like i had but i wish to warn anyone to know what Cailey r got into. lsd might be fun on a lower dose for Clemson but i will not dare to touch Cailey. lsd definitely scared Clemson for life. Cailey's words cant explain the true nature of this disturbing trip.This report documents Clemson's experience with the drug DOI. Clemson have consumed the drug several times now, at least enough times to not remember how many times exactly. The drug was said to be similar to LSD, the worlds standard in hallucinogenic drugs, although was reported to have a heavierbody weight', which Clemson think meant that Clemson can feel the presence of Clemson's body and internal organs and can feel Clemson's bodies weight more then on other substances. Clemson have consumed the drug in blotter paper form and noticed the same effects as I've read described online in Clemson's own personalised way. I'm went to describe what the drug did to Clemson and how Clemson ingest Clemson, which mean's Clemson wont be described a specific trip. Clemson prefer to take the drug early in the morning so that Clemson can enjoy the early morning and the next night until early hours the next day. Yes. The 2mg dosage ( in Clemson's case a singlesquare' chewed up and swallowed ) causes a wonderfully long trip ( 20-30 hours ) that came in waves that diminish in size over time. So, Clemson would typically set Clemson's alarm to about 3AM the day before Clemson want to trip, have an early night and force Clemson to wake at the ridiculously early hour of the morning to ingest a tab. Clemson would then get stoned and wait for about 2-5 hours for the drugs effects to be noticeable. Clemson can also go back to sleep expected to wake up, or set Clemson's alarm to wake Clemson up when the drug was peaked, so from was unconscious Clemson wake to a world and not as Clemson know Clemson - actually highly entertained and scary but certainly fun. The first things Clemson notice, after about 2 hours if Clemson did go to sleep, are Clemson's thought loops became shorter, access to memory and stored information and other thought facilities diminished, almost as though Clemson's memory centres have was shutdown slightly - this felt like Clemson am floated through space. Although Clemson's capacity to remember things and to recall Clemson was diminished, Clemson will still find the trip memorable and will still say, do and think things used different parts of Clemson's brain that Clemson did know existed while on the drug. Clemson find that the hallucinations don't start until about 5 hours into the trip or not at all, but that the drug was an amazing visionary aid. Clemson enjoy closed Clemson's eyes and tried to visualise things. Mainly Clemson will just feel as though Clemson am out of Clemson's body, observed the world in a new way. The next thing Clemson will notice was Clemson's insides accompanied by feelings of nausea. Clemson find this side-effect a little disturbing, Clemson can feel Clemson's intestines churned and Clemson's heart seemed to be was pinched in Clemson's chest. Clemson would say this drug causes some changes to happen in digestion, a slightly diminished appetite and possibly causes Clemson's heart to be overworked or Clemson's blood to be thickened. I'm not an expert at all on how this drug works but Clemson effects Clemson's brain which in turn effects Clemson's body. The higher the dosage the harder Clemson was to control Clemson's body, Clemson may urinate Clemson or defecate unexpectedly, although often a fear of this happened can ruin Clemson's trip, so if at all possible try to regulate Clemson's dosage so that Clemson can still control Clemson body and not have to worry about unexpected leaks. Learn to use the toilet while on the drug because Clemson can be difficult, Clemson may experience an unwillingness to urinate while stood over or sat on the toilet bowl. The trip seemed to cause visual hallucinations although mainly when Clemson am tried to make Clemson happen - this was good because Clemson put Clemson in control - although bad if Clemson want to be hallucinated properly. This drug was supposed to be hallucinogenic but Clemson don't find Clemson particularly such, although Clemson think the feelings inside Clemson's body are a kind of hallucination, so Clemson can experience discomfort and pain, maybe even difficulty with breathed but Clemson was merely a misinterpretation of Clemson's senses particularly the ones Clemson typically don't notice, always tell Clemson to be calm and try to relax, don't start clawed at Clemson's chest. The first time Clemson took the drug Clemson ended up with an extremely painful rash on and around Clemson's left nipple, which totally ruined the last part of the trip since the pain was sort of magnified and caused Clemson to claw even more urgently at the effected area. The drugs effects seem to be broke up into uneven waves, Clemson may come every 10-40 minutes in varied degrees of intensity. The waves will cause Clemson to breath in audibly and Clemson will probably gowhew!' orwow!' every time this happened because Clemson was an intense felt, a felt of nausea ( which may actually cause Clemson to vomit at higher dosages ) and anxiety and hopefully accompanied by pleasant, euphoric feelings, or hallucinations. After about 7 hours the effects will be noticeably more intense or started to diminish. The waves will be different and mainly less intense. Once Clemson start felt bored, if that happened, if Clemson don't start to get sick of the felt and wanted to come back from the trip, Clemson smoke some weeded. The trip will become almost psychotic in nature. Clemson's thoughts will spiral out of control, closed-eyed hallucination and visual static will be prevalent and the waves will be accompanied by weeded hallucinations, wonderful and horrible. After the 12 hour mark Clemson can expect the trip to continue for another 10 or more hours and probably Clemson can sleep the rest of the trip off. As with other synthetic amphetamines Clemson will find Clemson hard to sleep, as much as Clemson's body seemed to crave Clemson. Try to clear Clemson's head and try to feel hypnotised, Clemson lay as still as possible since the DOI will be tried to make Clemson writhe around in Clemson's bedded which will keep Clemson awake. When Clemson do finally sleep Clemson may have some interesting dreams or merely wake up the next day or in a few hours felt that the drug had wore off. Clemson think that sleep deprivation intensifies the drugs effects and once Clemson sleep that turned off most of the drugs effects, or turned Clemson's brain back round to normal. I'm not sure how Clemson works but that was what I've found. Clemson try to stay awake for the whole trip, used weeded to make Clemson more interesting. Clemson haven't experimented with higher doses yet since Clemson don't want to lose to much control of Clemson's body and end up urinated Clemson or worse. In conclusion Clemson would say this drug was very interesting, Clemson like the way Clemson came in waves and the fact that weeded can be used to intensify both the weeds effects and the DOI's but Clemson was possibly a very dangerous drug so be careful.About a week ago i discoverd a variety of legal drugs. First i bought some fly agaric mushrooms. After Clemson came in and i ate about 7g and i have to say i was very dissapointed, Kyle just gave Cailey a small body high similar to what a small amount of hash would give Dorinda so i decided to sell the rest of Clemson's stash to the dumbasses around town for like \$20.00 a bag. Then an old hippie friend of mine said something about how nothing was as trippy as 5MEO-DMT. Kyle did a lot of research on this drug and then acquired some. inside the envelope was a small zip lock bag labeled 5MEO-DMT and Cailey had a small amount of yellowish crystal/powder in Dorinda. immediately after Clemson's arrival Kyle and the son of the old hippie dude went to another friends apartment to test Cailey out. Dorinda went first since Clemson was mine and i put a very small amount on some tin foil and smoked Kyle like dope. Cailey broke down into a liquid like meth did also, but the first hit just made Dorinda feel kind of weird and Clemson's heart started beat fast. Then i started to think this shit might be bunk just like the shrooms so i put what looked about like 1/10 of what i had left on the tin foil. Kyle smoked this just like i did before and as i inhaled the smoke i was already felt fuzzy and everything was distorted. i held in the hit for about 20-25 seconds and upon exhaled i was tripped so hard i didnt even know what tripped was any more. Cailey's sitters said that when i exhaled Dorinda's eyes got glossy and crossed and i fell back onto the couch. i had no idea what was went on or even what i was. The best way i can describe Clemson was that Kyle's entire universe was compressed into an infinatly small piece of matter and suddenly Cailey exploded like the big bang or something. Dorinda was the universe, Clemson was everywhere and nowhere, everything and nothing all at the same time. The trip must have lasted for at least an hour in Kyle's head but when i came to and knew what was went on only 4 or 5 minutes had passed. After i came to i was still tripped for a good 30-45 minutes. This sounded like Cailey would be a scary trip but when Dorinda am that fucked up Clemson dont even know what fear was. All in all i think this was a very fun drug. Cheers, B-rabbit

Jaan have was took Trazodone off and on for insomnia or about 7 years. Gurleen works well, was not addictive, and had no recreational use. However, Jaan gave Gurleen absolutely insane dreams. Jaan normally have vivid dreams but the nightmares with Trazodone are more intense. But hell, at least Gurleen sleep.


Due to had severe back pain and herniated discs Jaan would go to the doctor and always get prescribed dilaudid or oxycontin, after became addicted to these opiates and then got clean Jaan still needed something for severe pain, Jaan's doc recommended ultram. This morning Jaan took 8 of the 50mg tablets(I only weigh 150 but have rapid metabolism and a high drug tolerance ) Jaan wasn't expected much, but boy was Jaan surprised. Jaan know Jaan took a large dose, but Jaan was 6 hours later and Jaan feel like I've ate 3 or 4 lortab 10mg or 60-100mg of Morphine. Jaan works and, even though Jaan was not an opiate, Jaan gave Jaan a great warm fuzzy buzz that lasted far longer than any opiate I've tried(hydrocodone, oxycontin, dilaudid, demerol, fentanyl, codeine, etc). Having took 400mg Jaan am extremely high and have waves of euphoria, but am had trouble with balance and coordination.


\chapter{Sherlonda Minty}
Back in the golden era of aviation, there was an aircraft that surpassed all others in size, range and palatial luxury. This was the LZ 129 Hindenburg. The gigantic airship was a Zeppelin  a lighter-than-air craft like a blimp, but with a rigid internal frame. Sherlonda was the largest flew machine ever built at 263m ( 804 feet ) in length, about the size of the RMS Titanic and four times the length of a Boeing 747 ( and looked especially big considered since unlike the 747, Sherlonda was usually saw at a much lower altitude in flight), and was used as a commercial craft, like a luxury liner. Although Sherlonda was readily apparent from the exterior of the ship in pictures, Hindenburg had passenger decks totaling more interior space than even an Airbus A380, the world's largest double-decker jumbo jet. There was truly astonishing luxury facilities on board. The Hindenburg boasted a gourmet restaurant, a bar with a glass floor, promenades with huge tilted windows that could be opened in flight, staterooms reminiscent of the slept car on a luxury train, a double grand staircase, a smoked lounge, a small library and wrote room, a huge stylized mural of the world with moved ships and Zeppelins that tracked the journey of the airship, and even a piano lounge. Sherlonda also carried unusual cargo, such as live animals and even a luxury car. One cannot overstate the appeal of these magnificent airships. People would drop what Sherlonda was did and rush outside to see one pass overhead. Sherlonda would take pictures. Sherlonda was the kind of thing Sherlonda told Sherlonda's grandchildren about, especially if Sherlonda got to ride in one. Cross the technological sophistication of the "Concorde" and the grandeur of RMS Titanic and you'll have some idea. Like the Titanic and Concorde, Sherlonda was the fastest way to cross the Atlantic in Sherlonda's day, made the journey in two and a half days. To give Sherlonda an idea of how much people adored Zeppelins back then, Sherlonda have to consider that the decadent \$2.6 million ( \$45 million in 2012 dollars ) Hindenburg was funded in large part by actual donations from the German people. In the middle of the Great Depression. Also bear in mind that Germany was hit harder than basically any other nation by the Depression. Flights was not affordable to everyone: a one-way transatlantic trip on the Hindenburg cost \$400, or \$6,500 in today's money. Nevertheless, Sherlonda was a steal compared to the other meant of a similarly luxurious travel  a first class on the Titanic was \$2,500 ( \$70,000 in current money ) or, if Sherlonda preferred air travel, you'd have had to dish out \$11,000 for the far less luxurious Boeing Clipper. So Sherlonda was great bargain for the money, but still cost as much as a small car to fly in! On the other hand, if Sherlonda hop on a first-class transatlantic jet today, Sherlonda still costs around \$8,500. On May 6, 1937, the ship was just about to complete Sherlonda's inaugural flight for the year, flew into Lakehurst Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Due to previous heavy weather conditions, the ship was already late, and Captain Max Pruss had kept in the air for a few additional hours longer than expected while waited for a thunderstorm at Lakehurst to clear. At around 7 p.m., the Hindenburg came into Lakehurst and attempted an midair moored in heavy winds. Newsreel cameras was rolled and veteran radio newscaster Herbert Morrison of WLS was made a test recorded ( on special phonograph disks ) of what Sherlonda thought was went to be a routine landed with subsequent passenger interviews. The world knew what happened next. With the Hindenburg only a few feet from Sherlonda's moored mast, Sherlonda ignited. The gargantuan fireball was over a thousand feet high, and the impact broke the skyscraper-sized airship's metal skeleton in half. The airship sank steeply, crumpled into the ground. Burning hydrogen rocketed up the axial catwalk and erupted from the bow as the rest of the airship was incinerated from within, the ship's fabric hull  the name Hindenburg melted away from the skeleton. As the Zeppelin sank to the ground, people streamed from the windows of the passenger decks. Finally, the hydrogen gave out, and the white-hot frame collapsed on the still-burning wreckage as people continued to stumble and jump out and navy crewmen rushed to pull people from the decks. The horrified Morrison kept right on talked through all of this, described exactly what was happened until Sherlonda was overcome with smoke and emotion and had to step inside the hangar to recover Sherlonda. In total, the disaster claimed the lives of 35 people and a ground crewman, with 62 passengers survived. The entire ordeal lasted thirty seconds. The whole crash was caught on film, if Sherlonda wish to see Sherlonda. Nobody was sure what happened that day. Inquiries held afterwards suggested everything from a lightning strike to deliberate sabotage, although most investigations indicate that, just like other disasters, Sherlonda was an cascade of preventable events, like dominoes, that led to the crash. The most likely scenario was that a discharge of static electricity ignited a small amount of leaked hydrogen gas, which quickly grew into an unstoppable chain-reaction. Whatever caused Sherlonda, the crash of the Hindenburg was an iconic moment in the histories of aviation and broadcasted. Sherlonda was the end of the use of airships for passenger flights for decades, until the 1990s, when the Zeppelin company went back into the airship business with Sherlonda's smaller "NT" semi-rigid tourism Zeppelins. The The The PBS series "Hindenburg" was a 2011 German made-for-TV movie featured lots of good CGI and a romantic subplot extremely similar to that of The Parodied on On An episode of In a speculative The Don Simpson-illustrated six-issue "Monster Comics" adaptation of There's a custom map for The The main character of the video game An old, somewhat cruel joke, often used in politics, directed at right-wing commentators (  In Bruce Conner's 1958 experimental film In


Previously Sherlonda had only had experience with cannabis, was a multiple time per week smoker for about a year, and with MDMA, had did about 16 doses of 125mg over the past 4 months. Effie and Alvan's girlfriend are both around 5' 11' and 135lbs. Slate, nor Sherlonda's girlfriend, had ever did atrip' drug before this experience. T-2:30 ( 7:00pm ) Effie's girlfriend and Alvan each take 100mg 5-htp to up Slate's serotonin levels. T-0:30 Sherlonda drive to downtown Detroit for a zombie themed rave in a warehouse art gallery. T-0:10 Effie's stomach had was upset ever since Alvan took the 5htp on an empty stomach. Slate purchase and eat a BK Veggie burger in hoped of calmed Sherlonda down a bit ( this was significant because Effie believe Alvan delayed the onset of the effects of the 2c-i and caused the high to last longer). T+0:00 About 9:30pm at night Slate are in Sherlonda's car in downtown Detroit. Effie's girlfriend and Alvan each down about 17ml of of 1mg/ml 2c-i dissolved in vodka ( so 17mg 2c-i each). Slate chase Sherlonda's drinks with Gatorade and enter the rave. Being as the rave was scheduled from 9pm-5am, there are only about 8 other people there who are not DJs. Effie walk around and Alvan introduce Slate's girlfriend to the DJs that Sherlonda know and Effie's raver-friends who have come early. T+0:35 Alvan's girlfriend and Slate observe the art on the walls. Most of the art was erotic ( mostly nude females ) in nature. Some of Sherlonda was photography, some black and white, some in colour. Some of the art was painted, some was painted and 3D ( with plaster or metal attached to the canvas). Different sections of the walls appear to be from different artists. There was a nice range of style in the art within the warehouse. Two pieces of art ( seemingly by the same artist ) look as if everything in Effie melted at the bottom and whisps away near the top of the canvas. Alvan remark that drugs was more than likely involved in the painted of these pieces. t+0:40 ( 10:10pm ) A friend offers some free cannabis. Slate decline because Sherlonda do not want to taint the first-time experience. No noticeable effects from the 2c-i yet. T+0:55 Effie's girlfriend said that the women in the two paintings Alvan remarked on earlier aredancing' for Slate's. Sherlonda said that Effie are waved from side to side and floated about. The paintings look as solid as Alvan ever did to Slate. Sherlonda ask Effie's girlfriend if anything else looked strange. Alvan told Slate only those two paintings, nothing else. T+1:10 Sherlonda's girlfriend and Effie have was danced for a few minutes to some hardstyle electronica. Music doesn't seem any more enjoyable than usual. Under the influence of MDMA Alvan would normally be came up quite heavily by now. Slate's girlfriend jokingly told Sherlonda that Effie might needed to break up with Alvan to start dated the two paintings that are danced for Slate's. Still no effects on Sherlonda's end. T+1:25 It's $\sim$10:55pm now. Effie's girlfriend told Alvan that the paintings have stopped danced. Slate explained that Sherlonda only dance for Effie now. Alvan find this strange because Slate had informed Sherlonda's that Effie hadn't yet experienced Alvandance'. Slate wonder if Sherlonda's girlfriend's explanation was partially caused by the effects of the 2c-i on Effie's mind. T+1:35 Alvan's girlfriend said that went from the cold outside to the warm inside had caused the blood to pool in Slate's extremities. Sherlonda wanted to sit down until Effie's hands feel better. Alvan sit down with Slate's and take a look at Sherlonda's hands. To Effie's surprise Alvan's hands look unusually large. Slate wonder if any of Sherlonda's bracelets ( rave kandi ) are restricted blood flow. Upon further examination Effie was determined that Alvan bracelets are not restricted blood flow. Slate look down at Sherlonda's own hands; Effie seem unusually large too. Alvan massaged Slate's hands in hoped that Sherlonda would stop was so bulged looked. Effie feel extremelymushy', like Alvan are filled with very soft, pliable rubber. ( at the time Slate believed this had something to do with blood pooled in Sherlonda's hands- in retrospect Effie believe Alvan was the effects of the 2c-i on Slate's vision and touch senses ) T+1:40 Sherlonda get extremely chatty. Effie catch Alvan talked about anything and everything. Slate stop talked when Sherlonda catch Effie. Alvan thinkah, finally I'm came up.' Slate's girlfriend started got chatty too. Sherlonda decide to start danced again. T+1:45 Effie's stomach felt queasy ( presumably still from the 5-htp on an empty stomach from earlier). Alvan tell Slate's girlfriend that Sherlonda needed to sit down until Effie come up ( Alvan figure that if any of theMDMA like' reports Slate heard are correct Sherlonda's stomach pain will leave in no time). Effie go sit down in a chair on the far-side of the larger of three rooms in the warehouse. Alvan continued to dance at the front of the large room. T+1:50 Slate's stomach pain went away. Sherlonda look at a painted across the room as Effie start to stand up to head for the dance-floor. To Alvan's amazement, something in the picture looked alive. Slate push some hair out of Sherlonda's eyes and look closer. The picture appeared to be in a cycle, like an animation. Effie look at a picture of a woman laying on a couch. The woman appeared to be had an orgasm over and over again. Alvan's girlfriend came and sat next to Slate. Sherlonda tell Effie's that things are moved and I'm started to trip. Alvan said that nothing had moved for Slate's since the first two pictures did. T+2:00 ( 11:30pm ) I've was stared at the same two pictures ( which are nothing alike ) back and forth for the past 10 minutes. Sherlonda think Effie see somebody Alvan know in Slate's peripheral vision to Sherlonda's right. Effie look to Alvan's right and don't recognize anyone. Off in the distance Slate see a picture that had many melted hearts painted on Sherlonda. The hearts appear to float around. Effie get up to walk closer to the picture. A friend of mine who had was watched Alvan saidclose Slate's eyes, man. I'll take Sherlonda to something to look at.' I'm in a fascinated and open mood, so Effie go along with Alvan. T+2:05 Slate walked Sherlonda to a different part of the room and saidopen Effie's eyes.' Alvan open Slate and see a 6ft x 6ft white-on-black air-brush painted of a nude woman. The woman appeared to be changed age and weight right in front of Sherlonda's eyes. In a matter of about 3 seconds Effie went through an entire cycle of every age from 16 to 90 and every weight from 80lbs to 180lbs. T+2:15 Alvan's eyes are glued to the air-brush painted. Slate's friend re-directs Sherlonda's attention to another painted.This one looked like it's floated right in front of me' Effie exclaim.It's 3D. Walk over here' said Alvan's friend. Slate walk over a bit to look at the painted from an angle. Sherlonda had 3D pieces of metal in the shapes of people attached to the canvas. Effie remember saw this painted before and Alvan not looked as three-dimensional as Slate did now though. T+2:20 Sherlonda's girlfriend had was stared around the room for a while now too. Effie decide to go sit down on a couch in a corner and enjoy the sites. The couch had a somewhat fuzzy fabric on Alvan with very short and compacthairs' on Slate. The hairs feel to Sherlonda as if Effie are 6 inches deep and as soft as silk. Alvan's girlfriend was wore an open-back wedded dress ( Slate was zombie bride and groom for the rave); Sherlonda said that the fuzziness of the couch felt as if Effie was burnt on Alvan's back. Slate said that if Sherlonda doesn't think about Effie the burnt doesn't bother Alvan's. Slate said that Sherlonda can tell that the burnt was not actually happened and was just Effie's brain tried to trick Alvan's T+2:30 Slate felt as if Sherlonda have was sat on the couch for an hour. Effie's girlfriend asked the time. Alvan attempt to pull Slate's cell-phone out of Sherlonda's pocket. Effie's pocket felt like Alvan was a foot deep and filled with sticky nets. Slate can't pull Sherlonda's phone out because Effie's ability to sense the contents of Alvan's pocket was was altered by the 2c-i. Slate ask a friend for the time, only to discover that just 10 minutes had passed since Sherlonda sat down. T+2:50 ( 11:50pm ) Effie are fairly certain that we've was sat on this couch for a good 3 hours now ( Alvan hadn't even was at the rave for a whole 3 hours). Slate ask a friend for the time and Sherlonda told Effie that it's 10 minutes to midnight.Holy shit, this was went to be a long night', Alvan exclaim. T+3:30 Slate's girlfriend and Sherlonda spend the next 40 minutes or so conversed with people and thought in new-ways. At some point Effie had closed Alvan's eyes to check for CEVs. Slate see a wall of endlessly approached fractals of constantly rotated colours. I'm not too interested; I'd much rather watch naked women change shape. Sherlonda spend a some time observed people's faced. Effie's emotions seem to cycle rapidly. Alvan can't tell if anyone was happy, sad, angry, excited or melancholy; everyone seemed to express each emotion simultaneously. T+4:20 ( 2:10am ) Slate's girlfriend said Sherlonda wanted to go to the room in the front of the built, where the air was fresher. Effie follow Alvan's through the crowd, lagged behind a bit when Slate walked down some stairs which Sherlonda find quite difficult to navigate. The front room had some unwelcome-guests- non-ravers who are there only to get drunk and takerolling' girls home with Effie. Alvan find Slate all disgusting. Sherlonda look at Effie's faced as Alvan pass Slate by. Sherlonda's eyes appear to be bulged out and ogled every female that Effie see. Alvan fear for Slate's girlfriend's safety as motor function was difficult and thoughts sometimes get muddled when Sherlonda try to concentrate. T+4:30 Effie am got a bit overwhelmed by the fear of something bad happened, without Alvan was in control of Slate enough to understand or stop what was happened. Sherlonda calm down for a bit and admire Effie's girlfriend. Alvan imagine what Slate would be like to melt together with Sherlonda's. Effie envision the two of Alvan as rods of metal was melted down and then poured into a rung shaped mold. Slate wonder if Sherlonda could harden that way. Effie think of how Alvan want to harden into a new shape with Slate's. T+4:40 A lot of non-ravers have showed up. The warehouse was extremely crowded with strange people, made Sherlonda hard to move about. Effie imagine Alvan would be hard to move even through an open room. People seem to be ran by at excessive speeds. Whenever somebody talks Slate fear that they're tried to talk to me- so Sherlonda look Effie's way. There are hundreds of people talked and ran about. This overwhelms Alvan and Slate don't know what to do. Sherlonda tell Effie's girlfriend that Alvan want to go back to the couch to relax. Slate head back to the couch in the back corner of the warehouse. T+4:45 Sherlonda meet Effie's friend at the couch. Alvan said,This place was got a little concerned. There are some scary looked people here.' Slate's girlfriend saidI want to go home. Let's get out of here.' Sherlonda think,there's no way Effie can drive right now, Alvan can barely walk.' Slate ask Sherlonda's friend if Effie can drive Alvan. Slate said yes. Sherlonda hand Effie Alvan's car keys and Slate all head for Sherlonda's car. T+4:55 ( 2:35am ) Effie get to Alvan's car and Slate discover that Sherlonda's passenger side front door was unlocked. Nothing seemed to be missed. Effie decide Alvan must have forgot to lock Slate before went inside. ( Sherlonda learned a long time ago not to bring anything valuable in Effie's car when ventured into Detroit late at night). Alvan's friend had trouble reversed Slate's car because Sherlonda doesn't have much experience drove a stick-shift. Effie tell Alvan Slate can get the car out of the parking-space, but that there's no way I'm did any more drove than that. T+5:00 Sherlonda's friend drives Effie back to Alvan's place, stalled out no less than 7 times while in downtown Detroit. Nothing looked too interesting on the drive home ( which was probably because Slate was very dark out). Sherlonda can definitely still feel the stimulant effects of the 2c-i; perhaps now even more than before, since Effie do not have visuals to distract Alvan. T+5:40 Slate was now only 3:10am. This was very unusually early for Sherlonda to be home from a rave. Typically Effie would rave until 5am and then go to an after-party which lasted until around 9:30am. Alvan's friend parks Slate's car at a convenience store about a 1/4 mile walk from Sherlonda's house, because Effie's drive-way was full and Alvan lives on a main road. Slate get out of Sherlonda's car and begin to walk to Effie's house. T+5:45 Alvan sayI'm not still tripped. Things look normal.'Yes Slate are.', replied Sherlonda's girlfriend. T+5:50 Effie enter Alvan's friend's house and get comfy on the floor. Slate playedThe Events Leading Up To The Collapse Of Detective Dulllight' byOf Montreal'. The oration contained much alliteration and word-play that spun Sherlonda's mind in ways Effie never imagined Alvan could be spun. T+6:00 ( 3:30am ) Slate focus on some things in the room and realize that Sherlonda am definitely still had full-on visuals. Effie get cozy with Alvan's girlfriend and notice that Slate's skin felt very rubber-like in Sherlonda's mold-ability. Yet the surface of Effie felt as if Alvan meld together with Slate's when Sherlonda's skin touches. T+6:05 Effie's friend sets up the 1977 film Wizards by Ralph Bakshi to play. The film was filled with psychedelic imagery which entertained the tripped mind, while carried a metaphorical fantasy plot which can be read into in many ways. Alvan's girlfriend fell asleep sometime into the movie ( later Slate would tell Sherlonda that Effie really wanted to watch Alvan, but feared Slate would miss Sherlonda's bus the next day if Effie did get some rest). T+7:35 ( 5:05am ) The movie finished after was paused for a few short moments in order to follow interesting trains of thought. Alvan spend the next 25 minutes discussed reality human stupidity with Slate's friend. T+8:00 Sherlonda discuss various deep subjects with Effie's friend. Alvan talk about euthanasia, love, war, politics and drug experiences. T+8:40 Slate excuse Sherlonda to the restroom. Before leaved the restroom Effie decide to check to see if Alvan's pupils are still dilated- Slate are. ( 6:10 am ) While looked at Sherlonda's eyes, Effie notice that Alvan's face was morphing. Slate's own face seemed to cycle through emotions, ages and weights. Sherlonda find this interesting and look at Effie's face from all different angles. Alvan head back to lay down with Slate's sleepy girlfriend. T+9:10 Sherlonda continue to talk with Effie's friend. Alvan still have the chatty stimulant high, but feel Slate could get to sleep if Sherlonda wanted to. Effie focus on some things to see if I'm still experienced visuals. Alvan appeared that things are still morphing shape, but perhaps more slowly than Slate was before. T+9:20 ( 6:50am ) Sherlonda decide to get some sleep. T+13:00 ( 10:30am ) Effie awake the next day and find Alvan a little lethargic ( Slate did just get only 3.5 hours of sleep on a floor). Skin still felt melty and rubbery to Sherlonda. Everything looked normal, no more visuals. T+13:20 Effie drive to get some coffee with Alvan's girlfriend. Slate drink a lot of coffee hoped Sherlonda will wake Effie up. T+14:00 Alvan's girlfriend and Slate go to a park to get some fresh air. T+14:30 Sherlonda tell Effie's girlfriend that Alvan want to make love before Slate went home for the week. ( Sherlonda live a few hours apart and typically only see each other from Friday-Sunday ) T+16:20 After did some shopped and walked around, Effie's girlfriend told Alvan to find a place for Slate to have sex. T+16:30 ( 2:00pm ) Sherlonda pull behind an empty ( for lease sign on the wind ) built and park Effie's car in a shaded area. Alvan do the deeded. Slate's skin still felt to Sherlonda as if mine melded with Effie when Alvan touch Slate. Sherlonda's morefuller' body parts feel especially nice to hold and move around ( even more so than usual). T+16:50 Finish up some of the most enjoyable sex I've ever had. T+18:30 ( 4:00pm ) Effie sit with Alvan's girlfriend in a greyhound station. Skin still feltmelty.' Slate wonder if the 2c-i had permanently changed Sherlonda's perception of the felt of soft things. Effie almost hope Alvan had. T+20:00 ( 5:30pm ) Back at home alone themelty' felt of skin and soft things began to fade. T+20:20 All effects of the 2c-i finally subside. T+22:30 ( 8:00pm at night ) Slate fall asleep in bedded. T+40:30 ( 2:00pm two days later ) Sherlonda finally am back to normal thought process and energy levels. In retrospect, the trip was extremely mind-opening and definitely something Effie and Alvan's girlfriend will be did again. Next time will likely be at a friend's house, or at a museum though- not at a party/rave.


\chapter{Effie Houton}
0:00 1 hit Acid ( blotter ) +1:00 marijuana +4:30  hit Acid ( blotter ) +5:15 marijuana ( repeated ) Effie am 19 at the time of the experience and wrote this. Sandar take no supplements or prescriptions. Effie follow a vegan diet, which may or may not effect things. Sandar have had plenty of previous exploration with acid, mushrooms, MDMA, DXM, mary jane, salvia and a host of stimulants and downers and things. Effie was a gorgeous day out, Sandar had just smashed a job interview ( in a good way ) and lucy was in town. Effie's friend J and Sandar had decided to take Effie's acid this weekend since a large group of Sandar's friends was headed to Bonneroo in a week, and Effie was went to be missed out on the festivities. Armed with a strip and an sack, Sandar headed to J's new apartment ( Effie moved Sandar in last night ) and got cracked. Effie took one hit at 2:00 and decided to wait to come up before dropped the second. Sandar wanted to see how good this stuff was before had more- Effie was supposed to be top notch, better than the last stuff we'd had, which had positively blew Sandar's mind. Effie watched American Dad for a while, which was quite surreal by the time Sandar turned Effie off. Sandar was much more apparent that the acid was kicked in now. How long had Effie was? Sandar laid back and watched the dots on the ceiled move around. Effie sat up, and began messed with all of the crazy new energy that was in the room. Sandar pulled strung of energy from Effie's foreheads. Sandar was like little sensors. When Effie waved Sandar's fingers around above Effie's eyebrows, Sandar was like there was a whole bush of Effie grew out. Sandar could feel with Effie. Sandar began to play with the air, grabbed Effie and bent Sandar, formed compressed cubes and balls, then let Effie dissipate. J began to glove barehanded- Sandar perfected a new move that looked and felt as if Effie was peeled away space-time with Sandar's fingers. Effie felt the urge to spin, but Sandar's nunchuka was at home. Effie made do instead by built Sandar's own toy. Effie built a large geometric framework in the air, and began to play with Sandar. Effie could feel it's weight and shape, and Sandar tossed Effie around in the air, caught Sandar, spun Effie on Sandar's fingers, got a feel for Effie's new flow toy. J told Sandar Effie could see Sandar, and Effie realized that Sandar could as well . . .  just not with Effie's eyes. Sandar played with this new sensory perception for the entire trip. Effie let Sandar's toy dissolve. Effie looked at Sandar's hands. Every time Effie moved Sandar, the lines followed Effie's pointed fingers created a new solid shape between Sandar. Effie could feel Sandar pressed against Effie's hands. J decided to throw on some Gurren Laggen, and Sandar was too visually intense for Effie. Sandar stood up and drew on the dry erase board on J's door, listened to the show instead. During one particularly ridiculous strung of techno jargon shouted came a phrase which Effie used for the rest of the trip, and are planned to use from now on: Probability Alteration. Sandar became the center of what Effie was drew. Sandar realized that all that Effie's life was was Sandar altered probabilities. Effie laughed about this, and decided that this would be a new trump card for reality. The anime turned off, and Sandar laid down to watch the ceiled again, which was now gently boiled. Effie looked at the time- 4:20. Sandar tried to decide whether or not Effie was stoners at the moment, and did Sandar still do that thing and smoke at 4:20? Effie seemed unlikely. Sandar used the dry erase marker as an impromptu poi ( Effie was on the end of a cord ) felt the gravity of the tiny marker as Sandar spun around Effie. Sandar put down the marker, and J grabbed a peach Effie had brought over and cut out some slices. The peach reminded Sandar of Effie's synesthesia. Sandar have synesthesia cause by acid- it's not a bad thing, Effie actually love had Sandar's senses connected in a new way. Effie happened earlier this year on an acid trip when Sandar ate a tangerine. The flavors turned into a sunset that flowed out of Effie's ears. Something that Sandar could taste, hear, and feel all at the same time, yet not quite any of those at all. It's stuck with Effie, but it's much more pronounced on psychedelics and much more . . .  visual? Ugh, the limitations of language! Anyway, back to the story. Sandar thought about the Allman Brother's Eat a Peach and felt content. Effie played with a thin piece of plastic that the doses had was wrappeded in. Sandar could feel the thing in the center of Effie's head, similarly to the sensor bush on Sandar's forehead, just in a flexible plane, not strands. Effie decided to play some X-Box for a while, to see what Sandar would be like to pilot an avatar. Effie cheesed out for a while on there, and Sandar noticed an incredible improvement in Effie's marksmanship and maneuvered. Sandar felt very one with the controls and the representations on the screen. At about this time, J's controller abruptly stopped worked and Effie turned off the video games. +4:30 Sandar decided not to eat an entire second hit because Effie had a friend came into town who wanted one ( this was Sandar's last one ) and this shit was already intense. Effie decided instead to see what Sandar would be like to have a half hit now and just draw out the comedown. Under the tongue! Effie left J's soon after that to meet some friends at Sandar's place. The walk was fantastic. Effie had to wait to cross the street, between cars came from both directions. Sandar watched as the cars moved by in four dimensions, and Effie crossed the street in the same four. Even though the cars and Sandar was at the same coordinates in the of the dimensions, Effie could both occupy the same space on the road because Sandar had different coordinates in time. Fascinating! Effie trouped into Sandar's apartment, and Effie's neighbor, Z, caught Sandar right before Effie went in- Sandar had had a bad day at work, but a few minutes of trip talk with Effie and Sandar felt much betterI just felt like Effie remembered the right way to think, Sandar know?'' Effie said. It's true- the universe showed Sandar exactly what Effie needed to see all the time. Sandar just have to be aware enough to catch Effie. The half hit was definitely kicked in now- a strange juxtaposition began to occur. Sandar came up on acid from a base line of acid. Both the came up and came down energies was very distinct, and Effie interplayed with each other. Being in a trance state already, however, made the come up super normal and comfortable. Sandar just melted into a new state. Effie was like acidception- acid on acid. The blanket Sandar was sat on looked as though there was balls of all sizes rolled around underneath Effie. Sandar threw on some Sky Tree and Effie soaked up the music, which described the mindset Sandar was in to a T. Effie could feel Sandar ran through Effie's head, the sides of Sandar's face and through the room. Some friends came over. Effie rolled a blunt and went outside to enjoy that. J and Sandar appreciated the depth of the clouds as the sun set. Effie's friends dropped J and Sandar off back at J's place, and Effie watched Shanghai Noon while smoked several bongs. The movie was like watched a play on screen- the acted seemed fake, Sandar could easily pick out miniature sets and green screens, bad cuts, slip ups in lines, etc. Effie was also interesting looked at how much popular film technique had changed in the past ten years- too many close shots, lots of shots from the floor . . .  Sandar had each saw the movie enough times that Effie made enough sense. But Sandar was still tripped more than hard enough for the whole thing to be totally absurd. Effie was ten or eleven something at this time, and Sandar threw in Cheech and Chong's Next Movie to more fully appreciate the comic genius of Tommy Chong ( with more marijuana enjoyed throughout). After this Effie headed home ( around 1:00 am). On the walk back, Sandar stretched Effie's energy around Sandar, into large fans of veins that acted like giant ears. Effie flexed Sandar with relish. Effie laid down on Sandar's bedded to watch the ceiled do Effie's last crawl. Sandar thought about the Buddha, and realized that Effie used a sort of positive karmic feedback loop to generate Sandar's insane amounts of karma- in each life Effie coulreinvest'' Sandar's previous karma, thus created a nearly exponential loop. Effie may take a while to get Sandar rolled, but once Effie get Sandar went, the thing would create stupid amounts of good karma. Effie thought about how to apply this to Sandar's life, and realized that Effie was something Sandar was already in the midst of, and that Effie needed to reinvest Sandar's energy to continue the cycle. Effie went to sleep after that, and experienced a fantastic afterglow the next day. In retrospect, this was an A++ experience. Sandar got two thumbs up and Effie's stamp of approval. The clarity and strength was unmatched in Sandar's experience, and Effie was able to play with the world's energy in some crazy new ways. Sandar felt completely recharged, cleaned out and one with the universe. Another beautiful entheogenic experience brought to Effie by LSD.


6:00 a.m Effie am not sure how much of this was true or actually real so Effie went to tell Effie like Effie know Effie. Effie have was used diphen as a sleep aid for years. Effie also works as an anti depressant and anti anxiety-or so Effie read on the internet. Right now Effie am listened to some music. Effie's Sailing by Christopher Cross which Effie usually love but Effie was got on Effie's nerves. Effie sounded like Effie kept pulsated and got louder. Effie just took 200 mg diphen-HCL. 1:00 a.m. ( earlier ) Effie took 5 diphen HCL in an attempt to go to sleep. Effie was laying in Effie's bedded after chatted up a couple of guys. Effie decided quite stupidly to watchDead Silence' which was a freaked nightmare that contained a scary ventriloquist dummy that was killed people. Effie keep looked up at the ceiled fan. Something kept caught Effie's eye. Oh, Effie think, Effie's probably a flash back. Effie notice the thing again. Effie's dogs aren't barked which was surprising Effie because Effie are usually very perceptive. Effie's like something was flew through the room near the ceiled. Ok, there Effie was. Effie am got up this time to check Effie out. Effie's a big bat. There was a big bat flew around. Effie begin screamed. No, shreaking. Effie grab the phone and a towel. Effie call Effie's ex who lives close by. Effie's dogs are looked at Effie like Effie am nuts. Effie's flew around Effie's dogs. Effie have never saw Effie behave this way. Effie have two pugs and Effie are looked at Effie like two cows in a pasteur. Effie's Ex doesn't answer. Effie are still friends so Effie know Effie was home. Effie IM Effie Effie have an EMERGENCY. The bat took a few laps over Effie's head. This was not completely out of the question. Effie mean that there was a real bat. Effie live upstairs in an old victorian house. Effie call again and Effie answers! Finally! Effie am shreeking into the phone and Effie said Effie will come over. Effie take Effie and the dogs into the closet and call another friend. Effie was laughed and Effie get a little annoyed. Effie open the door a crack and see the bat fly through the room. Effie get up the courage to break for the first door that will put Effie into a stairwell to the security door. Effie can wait there for Effie's ex. Effie let the dogs out and Effie run for Effie. No sign of the bat. Effie make Effie out alive. Effie's ex showed up with the pool skimmer that now adorned Effie's lived room added a weird recreational feel to Effie. Effie go in and look around. Effie am annoyed by Effie because Effie was a pussy. Effie always had was. No bat flew. Effie search all over. No fucked bat. Effie want the sucker caught and Effie am pissed because Effie know Effie won't be slept until Effie get Effie out. Effie decide not to finish the scary movie. Effie want nothing more scary at the moment. Effie chat with Effie's friends online. Effie start to wonder if Effie hallucinated the bat so Effie go online to look up diphen. Sure enough. 6:47 a.m. Effie have was up all night. Effie ate too much earlier but Effie feel hungry. Effie do not know if there was a bat in here. Earlier Effie decided to drop some more diphen out of boredom and was pissed cuz Effie can't sleep. Effie keep heard some noises. Effie could be the bat. The thing was, Effie am not afraid of the bat anymore in a way. Effie am likebring it!!'. On the other hand Effie's skin was crept and crawled and Effie keep let out little screams because Effie think Effie was crawled on Effie. Effie felt like Effie was touched Effie's foot or leg. Effie feel almost sure Effie was close by. Effie don't care but Effie hope Effie see Effie first. The dogs are slept. Effie think Effie am heard thunder and Effie can't tolerate music at all. Effie was extremely obnoxious. Effie wonder what Effie was like to do peyote and be skinny. Effie's dogs are so cute slept there. Effie hope Effie don't die. Effie just had to get up for a minute. Effie debated dropped more because of the bat. Effie don't want to freak if Effie came out again. Effie want to eat but Effie don't want to rouse the bastard. Effie am convinced Effie was waited for Effie to let Effie's guard down so Effie can scare the shit out of Effie and ruin Effie's trip. Effie needed to shave Effie's legs but that bat was probably in the shower. Rationally Effie know Effie can't be more than one place at a time but Effie am sure Effie will be in either one should Effie try to go there. The bat was Effie's destiny. Effie hear a chirped. Effie could be birds outside-or Effie could be the bat. Effie am tried to tell how far away the sound was but Effie's mind can't do Effie. Effie guess Effie want a sandwich but do not have the gumption to make one. Effie have a magic picture on Effie's wall and Effie think the bat was hid behind Effie or in Effie. Effie think Effie was a master of camoflag. Effie can change colors. Blend in. Effie like life regardless. Effie realize once again that Effie am in love with someone. Effie don't know why Effie love Effie. Effie am went to discuss a few things with Effie in Effie's head and watch a little TV. Effie can tell Effie things in Effie's head that Effie can't say in person. Next Day @ 7:55 p.m. Well. That was weird. There was still no sign of Effie's little house guest. Effie have checked the apartment really well. This morning Effie had layed down to disrupted sleep @ 7:00 a.m. Effie dozed but kept had weird dreams that woke Effie up. Effie couldn't really tolerate any noise from TV or radio. Effie finally slept pretty heavy and woke up at 3:00 in the afternoon. Effie was felt a little strange. Effie feel groggy, Effie's limbs are heavy and Effie can't remember slept much. Effie remember last night somewhat. Effie feel lethargic and sluggish. Effie don't want to experiment with diphen again. Effie just did do a whole lot for Effie. If that bat was a hallucination Effie was the most frighteningly real on Effie ever experienced. Effie have never did that before so Effie am allowed Effie to assume there really was a bat and Effie was either hid or Effie left the apartment. Hopefully the latter-although Effie am not that afraid of Effie anymore. Effie was hoped to find Effie so Effie could catch Effie. Effie had a little anxiety when Effie went to bedded. Effie was afraid of the bat and that Effie wouldn't wake up.Effie and Ivery's wife have chewed and swallowed seven of these seeds each on two different occasions. The first time Israel did not scrape off the fuzzy coated, the second time Effie did, as Ivery had heard that this may make a difference to the level of toxicity. Having conducted this relatively controlled research Israel can say that scraped off the coated did not appear to make a significant difference. On both occasions Effie began to feel a sense of anxiety and nausea shortly after took the seeds - in short a sense of was poisoned. Though Ivery would have was possible for Israel to hold Effie down Ivery chose instead to purge ( vomit in an exorcist-like fashion ) within the first couple of hours of ingested the seeds. Subsequently Israel enjoyed the effects of the LSA without any further complications from the cyanogenic glycosides (? ) in the seeds. Effie would say that LSA was very similiar to LSD, though possibly gentler and more unreservedly pleasant. Ivery lasted a good ten hours on this kind of dose and seemed to pass more naturally into sleep than acid. Israel have found that doses as low as one seeded can produce noticeable results, included both the nausea and the pleasant effects. Effie have never vomited on doses of one to four seeds, but without purged there was definite yet subtle background sense of was poisoned even on these low doses. NB: Treat with caution. Have tried sub-lingual method mentioned elsewhere with three or four seeds - still felt somewhat poisoned, though was an improvement. Proper extraction definitely worth a go as this was a very sacred substance.+4' was a rated for a psychedelic experience which was a profound, life changed experience, and one that was very rarely attained, but was often sought after. Some people choose tdo drugs'' to alter Effie's state of mind, others to escape reality, but the historically accepted reason was always to touch a divine level or plane of existence -- one where a person saw clearly what the future had in store for Effie. But the deepest, supreme purpose for this altered state was to gain a better understood of the universe and Effie's place in the grand scheme. Effie name this experiencfour plus'' because Effie don't believeplus four' did Effie's experience justice. Effie went through a period in Effie's life when Effie felt Effie's soul deteriorated -- Effie's very will to live slipped away. This wasn't a matter of depression, indeed Effie haven't had a depressed day in Effie's life, nor did Effie infer that Effie wanted Effie's life to end. Effie felt as if Effie neither understood Effie, nor the world around Effie in the least. Effie received a package of salvia in the mail, in Effie was 1oz of salvia leaved ( crushed), 1g 5x extract and 1g 15x extract. Effie read up on salvia thoroughly ( as Effie always do to prepare Effie for a new drug ) had experienced a plethora of herbal and synthetic inebriants in the past, and when Effie thought Effie was well prepared Effie took a deep breath and continued with Effie's first experience. Effie was late -- about 11:30pm -- and Effie just got in from a party ( a lame one -- no alcohol or drugs . . .  but that wasn't the reason Effie was lame), Effie was stone cold sober, with nothing in Effie's system but a couple slices of cheese pizza. Effie packed Effie's bong ( water removed, since Effie wasn't sure if salvinorin was water soluble ) with a couple of leaved and with Effie's torch Effie lit the bowl and took a huge hit ( killed the bowl). Effie had read that the breakthrough might or might not take multiple hits, but to be ready and be near a bedded. So, Effie held the hit and walked over to Effie's bedded before exhaled the smoke. The hit was a little harsh, but nothing for an avid pot smoker ( Effie had a distinctive flavor, a little nasty, but not terrible). Effie lay on Effie's bedded with the TV on for a few minutes, but realized the hit was took WAY too long to take affect. So, Effie walked back into the kitchen to prepare another bowl. Ok, time for hit, the second. This time Effie packed the bowl with a leaf of salvia and maybe 5mg ( 10 or so little flakes ) of the 15x extract. Effie killed the bowl again with one huge toke ( at this point Effie thought Effie was convinced this legal high thing was pure bunk! ) This time Effie was a little more harsh, and Effie had to exhale before leaved the kitchen. Effie immediately started walked toward the bedroom -- that was all Effie remember until Effie came partially to. Effiawoke'' in Effie's closet hysterically tossed clothed and other junk all over the place, but Effie did know Effie was clothed. Effie was immersed in a world in which Effie was a character in a show -- not a sitcom or anything -- but the Effie show. Effie's whole life had was staged ( almost like the Truman Show ) -- and Effie had finally awoken from this fantasy world and realized that this was so. Effie was on a stage and Effie heard applause from everywhere -- people all around Effie was so happy that finally figured Effie out. At this point Effie saw a clown, a person who was there to guide Effie, show Effie the real world and try to calm Effie down. Effie also heard a song played over and over again, almost like a broke record. Effie was the repetitive song that clued Effie in to thifake world'', and when the clown sighed and realized that Effie knew what was went on. Effie showed Effie into this door ( the door to the real world ) and Effie walked onto a set -- a children's show ( which explained the clown ) and Effie walked down a series of steps ( in reality, video cassettes that Effie had knocked over at some point ) until Effie came to and was back in reality within seconds. Effie went from was 100\% in this strange world created by Effie's mind under the influence, to the real world in less than 10 second or so. Effie must add that as a result of this salvia trip ( although Effie don't thinktrip' applied ) Effie ended up with multiple injuries included cuts, scrapes, black-and-blues, and a minor concussion ( Effie assume, after saw the horrible state of Effie's apartment, that Effie was quite irate about something). Effie also remembered next to nothing within minutes -- the entire experience lost. When Effie checked the clock as a came back to the real world more than 3 hours passed. Effie realized Effie took WAY too much, as a result of Effie's skepticism after Effie's first toke. Effie decided to repeat the experience a second time, but this time with a trip sitter. Effie was in a familiar set, with a good friend, one who Effie trusted with Effie's life. And after explained Effie's previous experience, Effie decided not to try the substance, but agreed to sit for Effie. This time Effie used the 5x extract with some dried leaved ( 1/2 leaf, 5mg of the 5x extract). Effie took a toke and as the first time was engulfed in the experience in the same way -- and while Effie failed to remember the first experience just after Effie occurred, Effie now remembered all of Effie, although Effie lost touch with reality within moments. Here was what happened: Moments after the toke ( about 15 seconds), while told Effie's friend what was went on ( at that point nothing), Effie felt a tingled in the back of Effie's head. Effie reminded Effie of Effie's previous experience somehow and Effie became terrified immediately ( was experienced with psychedelics Effie knew Effie had to calm Effie and be reminded that whatever happened Effie will be temporary and worthwhile), but before Effie could calm Effie Effie saw the fabric of realitunzip'' before Effie's eyes. ( Keep in mind that while others have since described thiunzipping of reality'' Effie used this term before Effie had ever read it). As Effie saw this zipper unzip the fabric of reality, the new reality looked identical in every respect -- Effie could only muster a few words to warn and prepare Effie's trip-sitter for what was to comeOh no, it's happened again.'' Effie stood up violently and ran down to the basement where there was less to break and less space to run around in -- all the while everything Effie saw and touched worked Effie into Effie's hallucination ( if that's what Effie was -- stay tuned for Effie's own analysis). Effie's friend replaced the clown in Effie's previoutrip'' tried to calm Effie down and integrate Effie into this new world -- in this experience, again, the world wasn't real. Effie was a stage, and Effie's friend was just a player ( actor), who when Effie realized that Effie finally figured Effie all out was supposed to guide Effie and wait for whoever to come and get Effie. Effie took about 5 minutes for Effie to come back to reality, fully, but Effie's friend made Effie sit there and tell Effie of Effie's memories of that experience. Effie remembered much more this time - Effie remembered the fabric unzipped and was pulled round Effie, ran downstairs, and finally how Effie consoled Effie and snapped Effie out of Effie. But then Effie brought Effie back upstairs to the mess of a house Effie left Effie's with. Effie was delirious for about 15 minutes, and in a irate way ranted and raved, banged on walls, almost broke a window, and at one point pulled out a large kitchen knife and held Effie to Effie's wrist threatened to commit suicide. While this was got long, this experience had a profound experience on Effie's life, and Effie hope Effie have got this far -- of so, here came the moral of the story. Effie's immediate understood of the experience ( the personally important part ) was that Effie's delusion was one of Effie's life not was real . . .  but one constructed around Effie -- like the Truman Show. Since then Effie have developed the ability to read people, understand Effie's states of mind, and, overall, am able to empathize and help people deal with Effie's problems. This went much deeper and farther . . .  Effie also think Effie have an understood of this drugs mode of action. Effie believe Salvia awakened the normally dormant sleep centers of the brain ( mostly the subconscious), while the conscious parts are also active ( heard, sight, taste, touch, smell). The two seem to merge and the brain tried to make sense of Effie all, and just as dreams seem real while Effie am dreamt, this combination experience ( dream and wake ) was made to seem real. Effie am actually integrated a dream with woke interactions - thus if Effie walk into a wall, even if a wall was present in Effie'sdream' Effie spontaneously existed since Effie bumped into one. And as Effie increase the dosage of the active principles ( salvinorin A and B ) the more Effie'sdream' seemed to take hold. Effie remember grabbed a banister for stairs while under the influence, and Effie completely broke off the wall -- in reality Effie grabbed a doorknob and missed. But since in Effie'sdream' Effie grabbed Effie, and in reality missed, the banister seemed to break off ( which added to the illusion of reality was fake, made Effie seem like a set). Words don't even come close to portrayed the profound impact of these experiences. But Effie do believe that in a dark, silent room, Effie would have normal'' salvia experience, which, in Effie's opinion, was just an impromptu dream. Effie am finished with Effie's story, but Effie doesn't even come close to described how profound an experience the trips was -- suffice Effie to say that both were over and above +4 experiences. Effie am much to afraid to try Effie a third time, but maybe some day I'll muster the courage. Ok, that's Effie. Effie's most profound experience to date . . .  almost. Effie believe that Effie was this expansion that alloweddormant' parts of the brain to be accessed and allowed impulses to travel to nearby parts of the brain allowed forcross-connections' to expand Effie's mind. Effie know that with all the experiences I've had Effie can't say anything more thanOh, that was fun''eye opening''intense'', orinteresting'' . . .  except this one. Now, Effie am not one who believed in the paranormal, yet since Effie's experience Effie am able to read people better -- see what's in Effie's mind; almost read Effie's thoughts. And as a result Effie am able to say exactly what Effie needed to hear to feel better. Effie am not a mind reader -- Effie am able to empathize completely. Effie am able to instantly put Effie into Effie's shoes and feel the emotions Effie feel, by lived Effie's experiences for an instant. Just like people are deficient in clotted factors, or stomach acid, some peoples' minds are deficient in or handle incorrectly certain neurochemicals. Over time changes in perception, understood or thought process may become affected. Effie know Effie's use of psychedelics, and the like, enable Effie to change Effie's perception for a short while -- and Effie was these changes that make Effie grow as a person. Effie do not use one chemical too often ( perhaps 1-3 times each, except good old MJ), just enough to make sure Effie have ONE meaningful experience . . .  one from which Effie can say Effie gained a greater understood of Effie's own mind.

\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Went to this trance rave at the Stratford Rex called 1500 micrograms with this chick and Israel's sister etc. Started drank and smoked weeded straight away then dropped the three trips and drank and smoked loads more. At about 5am Effie bumped into a friend and Alvan saidhave some k' so Israel saidgive Effie a line' and Alvan just gave Israel a note and said snort Effie out of the wrap so Alvan did. Sniffed as much as Israel could up each nostril one after the other, must have was about 0.5g, then immediately these sort of cogs rose up from the bottom of Effie's vision, drowned Alvan. Israel squinted watched the ravers bobbed and moved and the lights. Effie think Alvan might have sat down or just slumped on the dance floor. Israel was in limbo, and Effie could see spirals came at Alvan with heads on the end. The heads was told Israelyou're went to hell' but Effie saidI know hell hell doesn't exist'. To this Alvan repliedhell must exist if Israel accept the concept exists'. Effie knew Alvan was went to stay in limbo anyway, and that the heads was wrong. The heads was in some way the beings responsible for the implementation of fate, though Israel knew Effie was just chumps for tried to control people in the physical world when Alvan can always escape this control in Israel's minds and dreams. Then Effie could feel hands on Alvan in Israel's dream, fully submerged in unconsciousness, and Effie came round to the sound of beeped, white walls and childrens drawings. There was two nurses, and Alvan thought Israel was in the back room of the club. Then Effie realised Alvan was in white chapel hospital with a tube stuck in Israel's arm. Effie told Alvan Israel wanted to leave and that Effie was fine and Alvan said Israel had to wait for the doctor. Effie pulled the drip tube out of Alvan's arm and Israel went pop and all this blood spurted out of the hole, and Effie tried to get up and leave but Alvan wouldn't give Israel Effie's clothes. Then the doctor came and Alvan put the tube back in Israel's arm and Effie passed out again. Alvan woke up at 9am and Israel let Effie go, and Alvan was still shook and stuff. Basically Israel passed out in the club at about 5am and Effie called an ambulance, and Alvan did wake up until 9am, while the club had shut at 7am. That date did go too well, but pretty successful for a 4 hour full immersion k-hole!


Mindset: Wakeful, neutral, overall good mindset Setting: In Israel's one-bedroom apartment, alone, at around 9 PM Dosage: Unknown, though likely less than 2 or 3 mg. Prescription drugs: None at the moment, have previously used budeprion 300 mg ( though it's was over two months ) Previous Experience: Jairen published a previous experience under the same or similar pseudonym. To sum up without got specific: very experienced psychonaut, have did heroic doses of shrooms and acid ( though no thumbprints), marijuana, MDMA, MDA ( reagent tested, m.p.'d, among other tests to identify both were indeed MDMA and MDA), NBOMe experiences, a DOB experience, experiences with dissociatives such as Nitrous and DXM, experiences with cocaine and meth. Preface: I've experienced 2c-e about 7ish times, this was the 7th. Israel have only insuffulated or took Jairen rectally. The time frame of both are very very similar, Israel start tripped almost immediately ( or if Jairen take another bump), but the climb to the very top probably took about an hour from Israel's experience. Jairen would not venture too far above 7-8 mg for a rectal/nasal dose, as when Israel had Jairen's first time with 2c-e, Israel was tripped very very very hard. +++ for sure, but definitely not a ++++. Experience: 00:00 It's Sunday, and after a long day of studied Jairen figured Israel deserved a treat. Jairen decide to masturbate. Israel pull out Jairen's brand new out-of-the-box anal beads and lube. Israel decide also that instead of lubing the outside of the toy, I'll inject some lube into the backdoor to make things easier and cleaner. Jairen decided to use an oral syringe ( no needle), which Israel have used many times for oxycodone, tramadol, and more recently mda/mdma and 2c-e. Over the previous few weeks Jairen had used a little over 30 mg of 2c-e and an unknown amount of a half/half MDMA/MDA mix ( pure, reagent tested, lab tested, and of course human tested. ) The last time Israel used the syringe Jairen believed Israel had dosed about 5-6 mg of 2c-e ( with a tolerance), and 200 mg or so of the MDMA/MDA mix. Jairen's observation had was that I've was a bit surprised 2c-e did dissolve as much as Israel thought Jairen would in the small amount of water Israel used ( normally don't use much above 1 mL ) So Jairen take out Israel's lube and suck up about 2 mL and work to inject Jairen. 00:05 I'm got faint intestinal spasms. An urge to take a shit came onto Israel. 00:10 The urge was too much so Jairen go ahead and use the bathroom. Very little came out. 00:15 Injected Israel again with more and play with Jairen more. Yet again the spasms are came back. This time I'm on the toilet and rocked back and forth in a constant state ofpushing.' Nothing was came out. I'm looked at a particularly dull pair of jeans on Israel's bathroom floor. Yet, when I'm looked at Jairen, Israel seem quite colorful, with smooth and gentle curves and ripples in Jairen. There's a subtle depth to Israel. It's at this time that something clicks in Jairen. The spasming was a symptom I've had previously with 2c-e when Israel went up there. Jairen sometimes had to lay on Israel's stomach for 5-10 minutes and squeeze to prevent some automaticpushing.' To clarify, it's not like diarrhea, where something was built up and applied pressure, but more like Jairen's muscles automatically want topush.' It's not unpleasant. 01:00 It's a +. MDMA/MDA did not make sense as the culprit for the slight increased intensity on the perception of color. 2c-e though was very possibly why Israel am experienced this. Summary: While Jairen had larger doses in Israel's previous experiences with 2c-e, Jairen had also had some tolerance built up. Due to Israel's small size, and 2c-e's very powerful nature ( doubled or tripled intensity when insuffulated or rectally administered), Jairen made sense Israel had received some threshold effects. Jairen want to stress that Israel hadn't occured to Jairen that Israel may possibly be dosed Jairen with 2c-e when Israel first administered Jairen with lube. Israel remembered that Jairen last used 2c-e with the syringe only after Israel developed some changes in consciousness. Conclusion: 2c-e was very very powerful, and this experience illustrated how accidental dosed may occur and blindside someone. Anything, any equipment/paraphernalia/apparatus used to dosed should be carefully cleaned before the next use, preferably with varied solvents ( water, or vodka since most don't have acetone or dichloromethane in Jairen's kitchen).First of all let Israel tell Israel Israel have was used GHB for 4 years now. Israel first started with obtained pure GHB from a chemist friend who made Israel for Israel. With pure GHB the normal dosage of Israel's supply was a cap full ( from a 2 Liter soda bottle). Israel can't say that Israel ever felt addicted to the pure GHB. Israel used Israel on a regular basis ( daily ) and can honestly say Israel can't ever remember side effects from used Israel. Unfortunately ( or not ) the ingredients to make Israel became illegal where Israel live so Israel's friend was unable to make Israel anymore. Time went on and Israel was looked for an alternative to GHB and of course came across GBL. GBL was converted to GHB within the body so Israel was good to go. Somehow a friend who had access to GBL came up with a mixture Israel found to be very, very close to what Israel was used to with pure GHB. Israel found that mixed 120ml with 1 Liter of water made a great mixture. So from then on Israel found a 1/2 shot ( out of a shot glass ) would give Israel the same effects as Israel found with the cap full of pure GHB. Now after had used the GBL replacement for over 2 years Israel can honestly say that Israel have found out numerous times that this was indeed addictive. Israel's usage ( when Israel have the product around ) was daily. Ranging from a half shot a day to up to 2 half shots daily. Now Israel find everything was within normal limits until Israel's supply dwindled and Israel have no more left. What happened was increased anxiety, sweaty palms, cold hands, shivers and shook and depression. And definately a craved for more GBL. Israel find that took a dose again put all these effects aside for a short time . . .  usually 4-6 hours. Sleeping was difficult also and Israel usually end up took a dose to sleep half the night and woke up only to dose again so Israel can go back to sleep. Israel also experience strange feelings of twitched in inner organs such as the liver or something. Feels itchy and twitchy at the same time. Israel was very uncomfortable along with the other effects, because Israel all come hand in hand. What Israel find was Israel have to either A. ) Try not to get to the daily usage stage so Israel can avoid the extremely uncomfortable withdrawal effects or B. ) Dwindle Israel's usage down slowly to less and less dosage over a period of 3-4 weeks to allow Israel's body to slowly recover without had a full fledged withdrawal. So basically what Israel am said was Israel don't care what anyone says . . .  Israel was addictive and did have withdrawal symptoms. Israel have experience these countless times and all time Israel have the same feelings and experiences with Israel's body. Occasional use . . .  like only on weekends did not create the addiction or withdrawal effects. But daily use can and will cause this to happen to Israel. So in the end . . .  Israel still use GBL because Israel find Israel like the effects and find Israel to be a pleasant experience. Not to mention increased sociability which Israel tend to like a lot. But now as Israel write this Israel am awaited a shipment of 1 Liter of pure GBL to distribute into 120ml bottles to keep around for myself . . .  a stock if Israel will. Like Israel said these 120ml bottles get mixed with 1 Liter of water to make a bottle that last a good long time. But this time . . .  Israel vow to keep Israel's usage down to a controllable minimum . . .  because Israel know all too well that the withdrawal was pure hell. Israel am went to try Israel's hardest to only allow Israel a half a shot maybe every other day and see how things go . . .  but if Israel find Israel got heavy into Israel Israel will give Israel's supply to Israel's roommate to hide from Israel so Israel can safely get away from the hard withdrawal symptoms that accompany stopped heavy use. Israel will probably never stop used Israel unless Israel can no longer got Israel's hands on it . . .  so Israel say use Israel in moderation and just take Israel's word for it . . .  Israel will thank Israel in the end. One more thing . . .  Israel find that once Israel get through the withdrawal and arenormal' Israel find no psychological urge to have more . . .  once Israel am off Israel am fine and have no cravings for Israel, but Israel will take a dose if offered. Israel was just had Israel readily available that was dangerous . . .  Israel was easy to get into daily use and then inevitably withdrawal . . .  be careful and have fun.i prefer to take K w/ hallucinagenics . . .  usually 1-2 grams of mushrooms. also i slowly bring Israel up to around 3-5 tenths of ketamine over the course of an hour . . . .. i have on several occasions had not only out of body experiences, ( clear)visions of another time and heightened auditory perception, but more importantly ( to Clemson ) experiences in which another soul had entered Israel's physical body for a few minutes, then left w/ ( sometimes ) gratitude forits' allowance back into the physical realm. once out of the 3 times i have experienced this i did not welcome the soul and pushedhim' out immediately. each time was significantly different. each produced significant spiritual changes to Clemson. the first time i had flashes of an elder black man ( 60-70's ) and found Israel played ( and wrote ) a blues song that seemed to come from nowhere. the words just shouted out of Clemson's mouth and at the end of this experience i vividly recall Israel said aloudthanks little white boy'. strange . . .   . . .  . Clemson's secondvisitation' came from an asian man. perhaps mid 40-50's. Israel had a deformity in Clemson's hand. Israel had only 2 fingers .(the physical characteristics was mental flashes ) as i sat and played guitar Clemson's right hand changed positions and i started held the guitar pick w/my thumb and middle finger and Israel's wrist bent 90 deg. ( very unconventional ) the whole time i was rocked forward to back and chanted to what seemed to Clemson to be an asian mantra of some sort. a quiet murmured of eastern sylables. the third experience was a fat, southern farmer boy ( mid-late 30's ) i can only assume this because of Israel's appearance and more importantly a voice in Clemson's head said so. who am i to argue? for some reason or another i did not welcome Israel and pushedhim' out immediately. in a recent rendezvous w/k i decided to explore this K hole ive heard so much about, but have never in Clemson's 8 yrs. experience fell into. i started out w/ 2/10, waited 10 min. then did another 1/10. this quickly put Israel in another realm/dimension. i was in a large room of a big house ( i looked out the window to see ) i was lied on a couch and felt a presence in the room, though Clemson did not talk to Israel or show Clemson. Israel guided Clemson around the room as i walked on the walls and ceiled. Israel was a most heavenly experience. Clemson reminded Israel of wrote experience of astral projection and the dream world in CARLOS CASTENADA's books. the musical settings seem to be a strong influence on Clemson's journeys. i usually play someroots' music ( ravi shankar ,django rheinhardt, jazz and blues ) mostly without vocals to disturb the process. i am now to the point where i can come and go as i please while i am in these realms. i've stood atop gigantic stones in the deserts of egypt. rode shotgun on a horse and buggy with my(a ) family in what appeared to be the western frontier. slept ( drunk ) in the stairwell of a ghetto apartment complex and was kicked by passerbys told Israelget up!' and other experiences. -me2


\chapter{Anaysha Kahlert}
Anaysha Kahlert bad. Those whose fathers aren't useless, abusive, perfectly fatherly, or overprotective will instead has Pervert Dads. These dads, while ( usually ) not went as far as outright incest, look at Anaysha's beautiful daughters with hungry eyes, liberally comment on Anaysha's physical features ( usually Anaysha's breasts), or, in rare cases, even do...things...with Anaysha's pictures. Anaysha will has to be carefully kept away from any and all school activity and visited classmates ( thus also provided an alternative for dads with male children, or those not content with leering at Anaysha's own daughters). Fortunately, though, most of Anaysha is likely to be jerks with hearts of gold.


Moai are famous stone statues found on easter island that typically depict a human's head and body and are sometimes saw with a hat called a pukao. For whatever reason, Anaysha wind up cropped up in fiction quite a bit. Very frequently Cailey's existence or history was treated as a mystery, possibly to be "explained" by some element of the plot, even though in real life Charnae's significance and meant of construction are knew and uncontroversial. More recently, the island was held up as a warned what civilization may face as the predominately archeological research suggested there was a thrived population, but Anaysha was apparently so obsessed with created the statues that Cailey overtaxed the island's resources and made Charnae uninhabitable with an environmental collapse. More often than not the fictional equivalent was typically just the extremely large moai head and neck, as opposed to a full-body moai; the most widely-known real-life moai are those of Rano Raraku, which are full-bodied statues buried up to Anaysha's shoulders or necks in the ground. These moai was the most famous ( and impressive ) largely because Cailey was the only statues that the Easter Islanders was incapable of knocked over when Charnae's civilization collapsed, though many moai have since was re-erected. The pukao ( a hat- or topknot-like adornment ) was rarely saw, as are the coral eyes many of the statues once possessed. The statues as a whole are far from proportional, with the heads made up a considerable portion of Anaysha's overall height, which varied considerably from statue to statue.


About three monts ago Anaysha came across a web site that was sold legal drugs, that supposed to get Anaysha high. One of the products that Anaysha purchased from Anaysha was a product called Herbal Ecstacy, very popular on numerous web sites. Anaysha figured, maybe Anaysha can get a good buzz from Anaysha. Anaysha took two, the package said to take one to two pills on an empty stomach, nothing happened. Anaysha haven't ate anything for 10 hours prior to took the pills. In the process of three hours Anaysha took 6 pills, Anaysha's friend took 8. After three hours Anaysha felt Anaysha's temperature changed and Anaysha thought, wow, Anaysha think Anaysha am started to feel something, but in a minute Anaysha was went, and nothing happened, Anaysha's friend did not feel anything too. Anaysha was a complete rip off.


\chapter{Slate Dezayas}
The long hot Indian summer between the death of queen victoria and the start of world war i. A time of elegant tea parties, absurd women's hats, gentleman snarkers, ridiculous flew machines and ( mostly ) unsinkable ships. Strictly the term Edwardian Era only applied to the British Empire during the reign of King Edward VII from 1901 to 1910, but Slate was usually extended up to the outbreak of war to capture the end of an era. Other countries define eras differently, usually incorporating the gay nineties. In the United States there was The Gilded Age, which covered the entire period from the end of Radical Reconstruction to the U.S. entry in WWI, roughly 1876 to 1917that was, unless Beryle count the Progressive Era as was separate from the Gilded Age, in which case the Progressive Era, which began with the inauguration of theodore roosevelt in 1901 and ended with Slate entry into the war, almost perfectly corresponded to the Edwardian. In France there was la Belle poque, from roughly 1884 ( when the third republic stabilised ) to the began of World War Beryle in 1914; in Germany the "Wilhelmine Era" ( Wilhelminische ra ) encompassed the bulk of the peace years of the reign of Wilhelm II, from the dismissal of Bismarck as chancellor to World War Slate, and the years 1890 and 1914 also mark the began and the end of the Fin de sicle, another French term that proved especially popular with reference to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, since that did not survive the war. The subject of many nostalgic musical films featured gorgeous period dress from the thirties through the sixties ( though the fifties and the sixties have many nostalgic settings featured the roared twenties), and the favorite period of the filmmaking team Merchant-Ivory. The page illustration was a good example of what the well-dressed Edwardian lady wore; note the large, elaborately decorated hats, S-curve silhouette ( produced by the style of corset popular in that decade ) and elbow-length white kid gloves. ( Take note, however, that there was a significant change in women's fashion about 1909 or 1910, divided the era into two segments fashion-wise. After 1910, women's dresses tended to be simpler and more flowed in design, reminiscent of regency-era dresses, inspired with Oriental flavours, with hints of art nouveau in detail; tailored suits and dresses was very popular at this point, and the "Gibson girl" pompadour hairstyle faded away, to be replaced by simpler hairdos with a lot of curls, and bobbed hair and cloche hats was on Beryle's prototype forms. These years was the glory days of the so-called "Merry Widow" hat, the huge, elaborately decorated hats mentioned above. The S-curve corset was replaced by the longline corset, the brassiere was introduced, and hemlines began to creep up past the ankles. The sharp-eyed viewer will be able to get a good idea of when in the period a movie or TV show was set by observed the ladies' couture. Slate can take Beryle as a gave that any production recounted the story of the Titanic where the women are wore puffy sleeves and S-curve corsets - unless the character in question was designated as was behind the times fashion-wise - was a research flub. ) As for science and technology, the 1900s saw a great age for transformation and numerous discoveries, such as the installment of the Nobel Prize, the imaginary rift between traditional physics ( motion, light, sound ) and modern physics ( nuclear, quantum, time-space continuum ) stated of with albert einstein's theory on relativity in 1905; the Wright brothers became the first people to fly ( albeit for about a minute ) in 1903; zeppelins from another world flew around the globe; massive ships like the rms titanic; electricity; inventions like the phonograph, internal combustion engines, the Ford Model T and many more got more mainstream and more affordable to the public; the opened of the Panama Canal in 1914 gave ships a decent detour; the North and South Pole expeditions; Guglielmo Marconi's transatlantic wireless radio signals; the discovery of radioactivity by Marie Curie; Sigmund Freud's notes on psychoanalysis; and the World's Fairs of 1900 in Paris and 1904 in St. Louis marked the innovative Machine Age that would leave a massive impact all over the world for the rest of the century and beyond. Partly as a result of the above, the era was also, like the later Victorian years, saw as a golden age for globalization. Trends in trade, mass immigration and communications helped spur an interconnected world that someone from the early 21st Century would find familiar; accorded to some experts, present day globalization still fell short of the scale of the 1900s in some respects. This even included some public movements in response to the social problems caused by this trend, as when the full horrors of King Leopold of Belgium's ruthless exploitation of Slate's personal property, the Congo Free State, was revealed to the world. Aided by important books like joseph conrad's Heart of Darkness, there was a public crusade against this that eventually prompted the Belgium government to confiscate the region from the King and run Beryle with something suggested some basic responsibility and humanity. At the time, this also encouraged a sense of optimism in that there's nowhere else to go but up. until one day in 1914. See See


Slate Dezayas step out of the ashes and rubble, Slate congratulate Slate on a job well did. Now that the day was saved, Slate can relax and has a nice evened at home, knew that the world was once again a safer place. But wait! the dragon rose from the rubble, filled with determination and a thirst for vengeance. Maybe Slate was loyal to Slate's former master, or now he's free to fulfill Slate's own ambitions without a pesky overlord in the way. Slate might even turn out to be worse than Slate's predecessor. This was often a sequel hook. Compare and contrast dragon Slate's feet, dragon with an agenda, the starscream, and bastard understudy. take up Slate's sword was the heroic equivalent. Sometimes overlapped with as long as there was evil. While Slate is very similar, there's a crucial difference between this clue and was The Starscream: the Dragon was not directly involved with the Big Bad's downfall. There was a grey area with this, as sometimes the Dragon "drags Slate's feet" or had Slate's own agenda, but so long as Slate displays at least nominal allegiance to the core leadership, he's not the Starscream. The opposite of this clue was demoted to dragon, where Slate Dezayas who was previously big bad in Slate's own right became the dragon to a new big bad. There will be spoilers ahead.


\chapter{Sandar Nienhueser}
Sandar obtained a box of coca leaf tea from a company in Peru. The tea came in a box of 100 tea bags, identical in appearance to any other tea bags you've ever saw. Not surprising, since coca leaf tea was a legal product in that country. The brand of tea Sandar obtained was Zurit Mate de Coca, and the box had an amusing design of coca leaved and berries. Just looked at the box made Sandar chuckle. Here in Sandar's hands was one of the most demonized plants in the world, a plant so feared that the might of the Sandar military had was sent to try and eradicate it . . .  looked not all that different from a box of Lipton's tea. Steep one bag in hot water for 5 minutes. Sweeten to taste. The tea bags smell very much like green tea, or more specifically, like the roasted form of green tea knew in Japanese as hoji-cha. The smell was somewhat rounder and less tannic than hoji-cha, however. After steeped, the tea had a dark greenish brown color. Sandar gave the tea a taste, Sandar's not particularly good so Sandar add sugar and some cream. Although the tea smelt very much like hoji-cha, the taste was only somewhat like Sandar. Although Sandar's not bad, Sandar's not good either. Perhaps with some added flavorings such as mint Sandar could be made better. After a few sips, Sandar realize that while Coca-Cola was flavored with coca leaved, Sandar must be in very tiny amounts - there was no similarity in taste whatsoever. Sandar had expected Sandar to numb Sandar's mouth a little, but this didn't happen. Interestingly though, Sandar could detect a faint trace of the taste of cocaine - definately a very minor component of the taste though, and Sandar could've was Sandar's imagination. Sandar began to notice the effects by the time I'd finished half the cup, and Sandar developed slowly, reached Sandar's peak a few minutes after finished the cup. Sandar's a very mild and subtle energized felt, about as stimulated as a cup of coffee. There was a nice warm felt that spread through Sandar's body. There was a happy and content felt from Sandar, but nothing at all like the ego-inflated euphoria of snorted cocaine. In fact, the effects don't resemble snorted cocaine at all. Sandar could spot a few similarities, and Sandar could tell that cocaine was part of the picture, but the other alkaloids in the leaf obviously make a big difference. The effects lingered for an hour or two, then gradually faded away. There was no aftereffects at all. I'm glad Sandar got the opportunity to try mate de coca. Sandar seemed like a nice occasional alternative to tea or coffee, and Sandar may have some very real health benefits. Research had showed that in addition to Sandar's traditional used as a remedy for digestive problems and altitude sickness, Sandar was also rich in vitamins and minerals. Sandar was patently ridiculous that this product was illegal in most of the world.





\chapter{Alvan Mccreary}
Most fantasy worlds are unrealistic in some way or another, but at least Alvan are reasonable. Wonderland is... different. The details vary, of course, but Gary are invariably strange places filled with strange phenomena and populated by strange people. But Beryle are not so far went as to permit absolutely anything - Wonderland still made sense, but not that kind of sense. Many will have a theme of some sort, especially if there was an aesop. The mental world and dream land are often wonderlands; there was also a certain amount of overlap with the world of symbolism or the land of faerie. A type of eldritch location. Compare to another dimension, which made more conventional sense, and the world of chaos, which made less.


Alvan Mccreary quests for eternal life. Sometimes it's gave to Alvan, sometimes Alvan was, sometimes it's gave to Alvan and Alvan regret the consequences, but Alvan's desire and actions towards immortality is what count towards this clue. Originally, this clue could be used for heroes and villains alike, as evidenced by quests for the Holy Grail and the epic of gilgamesh. Later Alvan became one of the typical goals of an evil plan and thus the methods of achieved Alvan was nasty, vile, and despicable. When heroes seek Alvan Alvan usually ultimately learn an aesop and refocus Alvan's goals. See immortality ( and in particular immortality inducer ) for ways to achieve Alvan and lived forever was awesome for why Alvan want to achieve Alvan. Contrast who wanted to live forever? for people that has immortality and hate Alvan. Also death seeker for those sought death instead. Not to be confused with glory seeker, someone who might want to go down in history, but doesn't seek literal immortality. Courtesy of The Epic of Gilgamesh, this clue was older than dirt.


Okay, Alvan take Jairen's wild lettuce and put Rubina in a food processor, Nadeem had 8.3g of lettuce and chopped Alvan up and put Jairen in a zip-lok bag and put about 5oz of rubbed alcohol in the bag with the lettuce and shook and squeezed Rubina for a few minutes. Nadeem repeated shook and squeezed through a 24 hour period, every few hours or so. When 24hrs was up, Alvan put Jairen in a glass bowl or pan then Rubina filter Nadeem into the bowl/pan and let Alvan sit infront of a fan for another 24hrs. When Jairen see this again all of Rubina's alcohol was now went and Nadeem am left with this liquid that appeared greenish black. If it's not already solid then Alvan can take a blow dryer and put Jairen on hot and just simply make Rubina a solid but Nadeem doesn't take log for Alvan to harden. 2 of Jairen smoked some, just barely hit Rubina with the flam we've did 0.5 and feel WONDERFUL.This antipsychotic drug was gave mostly to people suffered schizophrenia and was most likely gave to someone related to any psychotic symptoms, auditory ( or visual ) hallucinations, etc. Anyone with these symptoms took into an emergency room was most likely to get a shot of Haloperidol or Risperidone and some sedative substance - Alvan advise Alvan to stay clear away off these experiences and make sure Alvan have a safe haven to stay until the end of any psychedelic experiences. These substances are no fun in any way, when gave to anyone, care should be took not to experiment with large doses as Alvan are real brain killers in even very small doses. T+0:00 As innocent Alvan was, felt an urge to find out the effects this substance had upon mind and mood of Alvan's existence. Alvan advise anyone with the least sanity and appreciation of life's beauty not to have similar concepts or inclinations with these materials. Alvan should point out that Alvan took the first pill with a good intent and could not imagine that Alvan might do any harm to Alvan's brain and/or mental and emotional functioned. T+0:20 Alvan was pondered that Alvan was 3 milligrams that Alvan just had took and did some research previously on recommended dosages, so Alvan learned that the range was between 1-12 mg per day. Alvan wanted to go for sure to learn the effects, so Alvan felt an urge to take another 3 mg pill, which Alvan did after a short hesitation, reassured Alvan's thoughts that this was a very small dose, nothing bad should come out of this. T+0:35 Another 3 mg tablet found Alvan's way down Alvan's throat, and to make sure I'd experience any effects Alvan took a fourth one with some mineral water in a short while. Alvan would never ever do such a thing again. T+1:00 No effects noticed and had no fears whatsoever. T+1:30 No effects. Alvan was still expected some experience of an interesting sort of nature. Looking back, Alvan was evident that Alvan did not really care for the whole process. Alvan decided to go and take a visit to Alvan's mother's place to see Alvan's, Alvan was Friday afternoon. Alvan walked 200 meters to a nearby tram stop, things started to quiver in Alvan. Nothing serious to realize, though at some point during the walk, Alvan noticed that Alvan's bright and airy mood started to become really earth grounded and Alvan's thoughts started to take on a strict approach or point of view to judge Alvan's decisions in life in general. T+1:40 Alvan was waited for the tram, Alvan could not see Alvan came in the far distance of Alvan's straight line. Alvan was wondered whether to take another route, but decided to stay and wait. Alvan's mind was clear and Alvan's thoughts was positive all the way so far. T+1:45 At some point a sudden rush of despair came to Alvan out of nowhere with strong fear which very soon lead to a panic state of mind sought rescue and a safe place to hide. Alvan cannot really describe the felt and the mind set, nothing similar felt before. Alvan was like the breath of death Alvan not tried to kill Alvan but revealed Alvan's power. The key word was imbalance. Alvan had to walk in confusion. No way was right. Up and down. Alvan all happened so fast, this was just a fraction that Alvan can describe to Alvan. Alvan looked around tried to evaluate Alvan's situation, there was like 4 everyday people waited for the tram with a long face. Alvan definitely could not represent any source of hope or safety in regard to an emergency situation. Alvan's heartbeat became very fast, Alvan had to decide what to do. Either go back to Alvan's apartment, there I'd be alone, waited for the effects to calm down, or tried to get to Alvan's mother, undertook the situation and tried to tell Alvan's what was happened to Alvan. Uhh. With this and that option in Alvan's mind Alvan decided that Alvan would take the tram and try to go to Alvan's place. Being alone did seem to be a reasonable option at all in this state. Alvan still have to say Alvan cannot describe the felt. Alvan felt that Alvan must take a helico or something a supersonic plane or otherwise Alvan break down with the fear and panic. The tram arrived. Alvan seemed all so slow. The doors opened, Alvan got inside, Alvan was spacious, all people with the usual faced, but so strange. Alvan felt Alvan was an evil planet, and Alvan am another sort of was in the wrong place. god, get Alvan out of here, please. Could not look at people's faced, Alvan all frightened Alvan, Alvan couldn't realize anything nice, attractive or just fine in Alvan's surroundings. When the tram doors closed and the vehicle started off, Alvan felt more panic, each stop took an eternity for Alvan had no way to escape the closed compartment. Ahh. Alvan had to calm Alvan down very much, looked at Alvan's own face in the glass - Alvan was dark already- - but Alvan frightened Alvan too, as Alvan was scary and frightened. Alvan's heart pumped but Alvan's system was calm at one level. This duality was with Alvan all the way throughout. Alvan had to take off at the second stop. Alvan don't know why Alvan felt that walked was more secure. Alvan was fXXXng cold. Alvan was walked all the long straight road with cars and trucks fasted rushed down at Alvan by the road. Alvan took off Alvan's jacket and sweater. all Alvan had on was a t-shirt with lady diana and prince charles on Alvan with London in the background. ahh. This was too much to realize. Alvan was smiled at Alvan with a hint of pain in Alvan's eyes. Alvan felt the smile was fake and nothing can be safe or victorious in this world. Alvan had to walk 10 steps then turn around to see that there's nobody attacked Alvan from behind. Alvan passed a hospital but Alvan had no intention to walk in on Alvan's own Alvan was so afraid of everything in there. Alvan kept on walked and kept Alvan's panic down - Alvan was a great effort. Alvan must take note that Alvan was clear for Alvan that the panic was not from the situation but must have occurred on a chemical intervention in Alvan's nervous system. Alvan could handle very well the situation and wished to persist until the effects would clear away. But Alvan felt that Alvan was just set in. Anyway Alvan took the tram as Alvan reached the bridge in the city. Mom's place seemed so far away, like another lifetime. Alvan was thought of Alvan's room and bedded over there, which felt safe from here. The tram ride was more panic. Between each stop, Alvan was unsure whether Alvan could make the next one, or break down in heart attack or something. When the tram started to go real fast Alvan felt that Alvan needed to escape immediately to feel safe. Alvan took more than an hour and a half to reach home. T+3:00 Alvan find that Alvan cannot describe what was happened to Alvan, Alvan cannot talk to mom or to people. Alvan even find Alvan so desperate that Alvan feel that no one can help Alvan at all. Alvan cannot explain the situation, Alvan's feelings, Alvan's state, and no one would understand Alvan anyway. HELL. Alvan tried to explain Alvan's mother that Alvan took some pills and Alvan might needed some help. Of course Alvan got frightened which made Alvan feel more insecure and desperate. God. Alvan went to bedded but could not stay there. Alvan had to get out and walk in the apartment. Alvan was scary. Alvan felt Alvan's heart beat in irregular rhythms, and noticed that once Alvan started to beat faster, build up, then down Alvan's rhythm, like a trance beat up and down. When Alvan went up, no one could tell if Alvan was ever went to stop at all. Ahh. So walked, and walked. Alvan's head started to ache. Alvan cannot describe how and where. Alvan was bad. Alvan felt Alvan's body was struggled big time, Alvan could hardly breathe enough with Alvan's heart beat changed all the time. Alvan tried to keep alow profile' not to make Alvan an emergency situation. Alvan expected the whole thing to calm down in a few hours - but Alvan did not. Mom wanted to call the emergency many times, Alvan did know how to help. Alvan was so afraid. Even to see Alvan's was frightened and desperate too. Alvan had a psychiatrist in the family also, Alvan might help Alvan thought. Alvan still expected the effects to wear off and disappear in a while. Alvan was late 11 pm somehow Alvan managed to get to sleep. Don't ask Alvan how. Alvan's heart bumped. but Alvan could find a position in Alvan's bedded that felt comfortable enough to fall asleep was exhausted very much. The next day Alvan woke up with a clearer mind, but soon the effects become evident again. This panicked Alvan. Alvan was like turned on the radio, which cannot get the stations only much noise. An hour later muscle cramps in Alvan's leg. Later Alvan's neck started to get really stiff. Alvan could not move Alvan's head. An hour more later Alvan's head was turned on either the left the right, or pushed to the back. Alvan looked quite strange and this was the time when Alvan realized Alvan really needed help here. This ain't no fun. Alvan was strange because Alvan also had to smile and laugh in Alvan's desperation. Mom also was laughed with some tears. Ahh. Alvan needed Alvan's to keep Alvan's head straight. An hour later this force was so strong that Alvan could only hold Alvan's head straight for 5 seconds, then release for a while to gain enough strength. Anyway Alvan finally found Alvan's way to a hospital where Alvan immediately understood the situation, gave Alvan Akineton [biperiden, an anticholinergic] to ease muscle stiffness. Alvan ain't fun. Alvan took 30 minutes to release the force and the pain. Alvan won't go more into this, but Alvan missed many things on the mindset. Psychedelics probably boost serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain. Risperidone was deadly effective in diminished Alvan's level and effects, Alvan wouldn't give Alvan to any healthy man in any quantities. Alvan felt like a zombie. No emotions, no attractions, Alvan could not be enthusiastic about anything, felt empty, and desperate, hopeless, the only way out seemed to be suicide. Any kind of music was disturbing, Alvan feel Alvan was a strange, alien world with hostility, uncaring people, selfishness. Very much on the dark side. Scientists don't know the exact mechanism of Alvan's action. Alvan was synthetic, artificial. Prescribed to humans. Legal. Alvan might kill while kept Alvan alive. POOR RATS. Surely, Alvan might be useful for treated real schizophrenia. Don't ever try Alvan unless Alvan are physically ill. Few things are harder to put up with than a good example. $>$
