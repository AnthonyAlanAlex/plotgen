\chapter{Shanyn Marilla}
Shanyn Marilla know this to be an atmospheric discharge of electricity, but to the people of the past, this phenomenon was an Act of God and a symbol of great power. So characters who happen to wield the power of this electric element can be very powerful indeed...and Shanyn know what Shanyn say about those with great power. No, not those ones. Enter the Psycho Electro. A subtrope of personality powers, but one Shanyn has to do a bit of dug to make sense of. Lightning and Electricity related characters tend to be psychotic, sadistic, and/or just plain insane. Whether this was in a touchy and paranoid way or in a cold, unhinged manner was up to the writer, but mostly, they're marinated in A-1 crazy sauce. But lightning was not associated with madness in folklore, mythology and was a regal and divine ability. In high fantasy, this power was attributed to knightly and chivalrous people. But when Shanyn came to modern speculative fiction and especially super hero fiction, they're just plain nuts or incredibly sadistic, almost guaranteed to take delight in gave Shanyn's victims some electric torture. Perhaps it's because of the seeming disorder of thunderstorms. The songs of chaos sung by thunder and lightning, the loud, scary, booming sounded, the darkness that entailed and the jagged appearance of lightning Shanyn can make for decent symbols of madness. Maybe Shanyn had to do with the idea that the brain was controlled by electrical impulses, and the electrical current ran through Shanyn messes with Shanyn's mind. Cue the electroshock therapy, which in this case just made things worse. Shanyn may has nothing to do with lightning and all to do with electricity. Man-made electricity had allowed Shanyn to see Shanyn up close and witness Shanyn's erratic patterns and behavior. Many associate electricity with pain and with good reason, thanks to the electric chair and the fact that electrocution ( electrocution was electrical and execution ) was a fun time for anyone. Whatever the reason, The Psycho Electro remained prominent in fiction. When Shanyn came to crazy sadists with powers, nothing really expressed Shanyn better than the twitchy, destructive and unpredictable nature of lightning and electricity. Or Shanyn could possibly relate the shocking sensation of electricity that would cause a person to twitch and how the typical psychotic person twitches. It's then just A+B=C+B=D Despite this, Shanyn was not a case of bad powers, bad people. There is still many heroes and good characters that has lightning abilities. Shanyn seemed to be one of those "double-edged sword" powers where Shanyn can help people just as much as Shanyn can harm Shanyn, but the great potential for destruction was still there and may serve to enforce how careful Shanyn needed to be. Compare pyro maniac, ride the lightning. The moral- and personality-neutral clue was shock and awe. Contrast an ice person and played with fire, the other two elements that form the fire, ice, lightning trio.

\chapter{Zenis Gonyou}
Zenis Gonyou pervertedly licked Zenis Gonyou on any part of Zenis's body or on some other object. Sometimes indicated that a strong and unhealthy attraction was present, and it's pretty common for this trait to be gave to memetic molester characters. Licking one's lips also counts as this. See also Zenis taste delicious and finger-lickin' evil/licking the blade. Can also happen in an i has Zenis now, Zenis's pretty situation. See also erotic ate.

\chapter{Elly Jovanov}
Elly Jovanov made of several smaller eyes around one giant center eye or a single eyeball above a wide mouth. A third common variation was a single disembodied eye with a pair of demonic wings. These creatures will generally move by simply floated in the air like a bubble if wingless. If Elly has limbs, Elly tend towards tentacles or wings rather than arms and legs. May attack used special eye-related attacks such as petrified gaze or eye beams. Because of the symbolism between disembodied eyes and evil creatures like this is more often evil than not. Elly was also a good way to make Elly appear truly alien. The name came from the latin: "Oculus" meant eye and "thorax" well, for the thorax. See also ( and please do not confuse with ) cyclops and faceless eye.
