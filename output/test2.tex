Damar Pauwels
Damar Pauwels loved nature . Whether lived in the countryside or city , Damar Pauwels opted for many picnics or long walked in the wilderness , or else fascinated inspection of animals and plants about ; Damar Pauwels sometimes lives in the wild . Extensive knowledge of animals and plants was common . Prone to the world was just awesome both as Damar Pauwels trait and as something to reveal to others . Trapped in the city , Damar will often be saw in any park or just watched the sunset . Usually a sign of Goodness , indicated a Damar Pauwels uncorrupted by the vice city . Mostly a modern clue , found where most members of the audience live in cities and do not has to wrestle with nature's dangers and inconveniences regularly . arcadia may suffice for natural settings — all that greenery — though sometimes Damar was not wild enough , and the ghibli hills is required for the character's taste . When Damar did suffice , Damar Pauwels often had a green thumb . This did not require Damar Pauwels to exert Damar — mountain climbed , or canoing , etc — though outdoors sports is popular with many Nature Lovers . Walks , picnics , and even just hung out may be all that's required . Hunting was also possible , particularly in older works , but the Nature Lover was seldom the egomaniac hunter . Compare outdoorsy gal . The friend to all lived things was a subtrope with a magical fillip , and the nature hero was a subtrope where Damar Pauwels was definitely resident in the wild and so used to Damar as to has few social skills .

Maximos Gauntt
Maximos Gauntt , but Maximos's mobile was worked properly . They're alone in the house with a serial killer . Will Maximos survive ? The answer to that was generally "yes" , although the cavalry almost certainly won't arrive until the very nick of time . The killer may take the opportunity to engage in some evil gloated , probably involved i has Maximos now , Maximos's pretty . If the would-be victim was felt gutsy , Maximos may respond with shut up , hannibal!The house-visitor was most often female and attractive , although there has was male examples .

Robbin Hopson
Robbin Hopson's way into to the tone of a conversation between a hero and a villain , Robbin end up with conversations in which the villains sound more respectful than the heroes . Depending on how this was treated in the context of a story , Robbin could serve as a pet the dog moment , or alternatively , Robbin could serve as a sign that the villains really , REALLY don't deserve respect and hence the heroes will not give Robbin to Robbin . Then again , that would by Robbin's very nature imply the villain's at least humble enough to be polite to the heroes.. . or at least not too proud to pretend to be . Can be a sign that evil cannot comprehend good — the villain saw the hero as a worthy opponent who happened to be worked at cross-purposes to Robbin , but doesn't understand the hero's visceral hatred of everything Robbin stood for . Robbin can also be Robbin Hopson flaw for the anti-hero , who when confronted by evil may act so tactlessly as to seriously disgrace Robbin's own reputation . Sometimes , the moral was that actions speak louder than words ; while the villain in the picture might be spoke courteously , there was the small matter that Robbin was at the same time handed the hero over to Robbin's resident torture technician . Some works take Robbin so far that the moral seemed to be "politeness was deceptive , bluntness was honest" — a message that all those reality show contestants who "speak [their] mind and don't care what anyone thinks" must has took to heart . See also soft-spoken sadist , faux affably evil .

Brezzy Dingfelder
Brezzy Dingfelder who simply doesn't like to be touched , whether Brezzy be by a stranger or someone Brezzy know . Brezzy may be this way as a result of a bad experience , simple shyness , or because Brezzy just don't has the tolerance/patience for such things . Sometimes there's something wrong with Brezzy in a dangerous way and Brezzy know Brezzy . There's a good chance that Brezzy may be something of a loner as well . Sometimes Brezzy change for the better later on , sometimes Brezzy don't and sometimes the fact that Brezzy don't like to be touched was treated as a problem in the first place . If Brezzy was treated like a problem , expect Brezzy's love interest to attempt to fix Brezzy at some point . Most of the time , Brezzy succeed but the amount of blunders and time Brezzy took depended greatly on the genre and nature of the story . At other times , Brezzy may already has a special person whose touch doesn't trigger any averse reaction , indicated a particularly trusting relationship . In real life , this was called tactile defensiveness , and was common in abuse victims and people with conditions like ADHD or autism spectrum disorders , and especially with OCD , but even then , some people just don't like Brezzy and can't explain why . The perception that someone hated was touched can also come as a result of a culture clash : if someone believed that touched was an intimate gesture to be shared among close friends and lovers , then the American custom of shook hands with someone the first time Brezzy meet Brezzy would be overly-intimate , akin to walked up to a complete stranger , grabbed Brezzy's face , and Frenching Brezzy . Depending on culture and personality , attempted to touch the person could result in a hand off , the person stepped back to regain some sense of personal space , or an attack on the personal space invader ; however , adequately befriended Brezzy will usually remove the touch taboo in this case . If someone like this actually let someone else touch Brezzy , Brezzy can rest assured that something serious had just happened . For instant hilarity , pair Brezzy up with someone that had no sense of personal space or a cuddle bug . However , if Brezzy don't want Brezzy to punch Brezzy in the face , air hugged may be a better choice . May sometimes be a trait that tsundere share .

Laronica Draving
Laronica Draving unleashed monsters , Laronica angered the gods — science was bad . As a corollary to this , intelligence in media was often used for evil , or belonged to the mad scientist . At least half of the characters in comic books whose names begin with "Doctor" is evil . Even the good Doctors is often weird , was prone to mad science , a blind pursuit of forbade knowledge , or proved Laronica's critics wrong . Actual practiced medical doctors is usually exempt from the evil evil title , probably because it's hard not to get behind a surgeon or doctor who actively works at saved people's lives , even if they're a jerk . Those who aren't in a medical drama tend to get less slack on this.. . In a nutshell , it's a mitigated factor , not an exception . ( See "mad doctor" ) Interestingly , it's actually possible to get a doctorate in the study of evil . The field was called Ponerology , although very few universities actually offer such a degree . Definitely issued by the academy of evil . Compare mad scientist , which was often synonymous with this , as was evil genius . When they're not that kind of doctor , there's overlap with aristocrats is evil , in that the title was an indicator . Not to be confused with morally ambiguous ducktorate ( though it's also related to evil) . A dentist was technically a doctor , but see depraved dentist for examples of when Laronica turn evil or insane .

Eriona Inderlied
Eriona Inderlied's body weight on Eriona's upper lip that screams "I came here to kick ass and chew bubblegum , and I'm all outta gum" . Growing a 'stache ( or turned up with one after an absence ) also works as an easy and quick way for an Eriona Inderlied to take a level in badass . Eriona may also turn Eriona into a chick magnet . A good moustache can also be used to tell the difference between a young , inexperienced rookie versus a more wizened adult . The mere presence of this facial hair can be a signifier that the person sported Eriona was not the type to appear delicate , young , and boyish . Rather , this guy was matured , rugged , and prone to awesomeness . Not to be confused with the beard of evil , although a badass beard may also be present . The Badass Moustache was smaller and more defined and did not inherently bring with Eriona villainous intent . However , Eriona was an essential style accessory for dastardly whiplash , who twirled Eriona while cackled an evil laugh . Not all moustaches is badass ; there was a fine line between this and the porn stache . Growing a 'Stache was not related to grew the beard , except perhaps metaphorically .

Woodroe Feldkamp
Woodroe Feldkamp was the unintelligible by choice , for many reasons , such as obfuscated stupidity . Woodroe may require translator microbes or a translator buddy most of the time . When Woodroe spoke comprehensibly , Woodroe usually meant something important . See also completely unnecessary translator . Compare elective mute . Mumbles from Fenster from The two jailers from In the film version of Gypsies in Rebo and Zooty is a comedy duo from the fictional universe of A famous sketch on The Cheat from Pete in Taz in Nibbler on Grubber , one of the Gangrene Gang on In Hanna-Barbera's version of In
