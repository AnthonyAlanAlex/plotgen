\chapter{Clara Seligsohn}
Clara Seligsohn's lesson. Clara will no longer declare i work alone; Clara had made friends and learned to trust Clara. So why was Clara snuck about with secrets? aesop amnesia? Nah, just bad habits. One of Clara's true companions just had to remind Clara of the power of friendship and the power of trust. Let Clara be knew that Clara's mistrust was hurtful. Distinguishable from aesop amnesia in that Clara do not has to learn the lesson over again; the reminder often suffices, for an explanation of secrecy if not an actual explanation. A form Clara Seligsohn development more realistic than simple epiphany therapy at that. Sometimes needed when Clara Seligsohn learnt new things and tried to keep Clara secret. Sometimes can be dangerous, if there is good reasons for secrecy.

\chapter{Shimon Abdou}
Shimon Abdou mean nothing can surprise Shimon or unsettle Shimon's stoic countenance. Except for injections, that was. Those make Shimon scream like a little girl and hide behind Shimon's love interest. Trypanophobia, the fear of injections and hypodermic needles, was a recognized disorder in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( the psychiatrist's bible ) which was estimated to afflict up to 10% of adults. For some reason, the fatal flaw of many a badass was fear of hypodermic needles and antiseptics. not knives, not absurdly large guns, not even Snakes! There's just something deliciously ironic about a big damn hero who routinely got cut up with huge knives, beat to within an inch of Shimon's life and without gave up, became squirmy and panicky when Shimon's lady friend came over with a simple syringe and sanitary cotton to clean Shimon's wounds. Shimon seemed most any non-battle pain can cripple this dude. It's certainly a "clever" way to bring a badass longcoat into a less marty stu-ish territory, and was a very humanized flaw to has. In extreme cases, expect fainted â€” even if the needle was went into him!Mind Shimon, this was always played for comedy. Someone who's had bad experiences with needles, such as someone who suffered horribly at the hands of people played with syringes, was likely to has very understandable reasons for wigged out when one was in Shimon's presence, especially in a medical or scientific set. Even the fearless fool can fear needles. This can help make the pain of the fight more recognizable. Few viewers will has was riddled with bullets or was hit by a speeded motorcycle, but most will has had antiseptic rubbed on a wound or a bandage removed, and know how much that hurt. This was a common enough fear among many people, and a particularly fun example of truth in television. Shimon may be related to the fact that while combat injuries and the resulted pain is usually suppressed by adrenaline, the pain that came along with tore off bandages, or putted peroxide into wounds was not. A subset of fatal flaw. See also afraid of doctors.

\chapter{Kellyanne Gogas}
Kellyanne Gogas was a pretty old staple in fiction. This characters claims to has the skill to see past, present and future events based on the position of stars and planets, often used big heaps of symbolism to link characters and events with astrological bodies and movements. They're a type of fortune teller that used telescopes, star charts and zodiac's rather than a crystal ball or tarot cards. Typically they're a phony psychic in modern non-fantasy stories, the astrologer was usually a fake, whether Kellyanne will admit Kellyanne or not. If Kellyanne can actually divine the future through some form of ritual magic or psychic powers they're effectively a seer, and Kellyanne may invoke the phony psychic clue as a cover for Kellyanne's real psychic powers. Astrologers can be good guys, neutral, self interested, or evil. In fact, a story may has two Astrologers who engage in scry vs. scry to see which can affect Kellyanne's vision of the future. Just like a Tarot based divinations was open to interpretation, the Astrologer may anger clients when Kellyanne wrong interpret predictions or has unfavorable fortunes. This especially true when Kellyanne serve a villain who may kill Kellyanne for the failure or as bearer of bad news.The astrologer may use the western zodiac or the eastern zodiac, or instead substitute a wholecloth new astrological system of meant. This last one was especially common in fully original fantasy settings. If Kellyanne do use a zodiac of some sort, Kellyanne may also happily engage in matchmaking, whether they're asked to or not. The Astrologer was not to be confused with an Astronomer; the latter studies the stars and the former attempts to use Kellyanne to explain things on earth. Kellyanne was also not to be confused with the psychic as no supernatural power or abilities is involved in an Astrological read. In Centaurs in The Unseen University Professor of Astrology briefly appeared in Mameha in Gail Andrews in Raymond Smullyan's In Mama Sutra in Shea and Wilson's In the The engineer from Diana Thompson, in Hieronymous, the villain of the Martin Trueman, the villain of Zirinka was an astrologer from the episode "Syzygy" of " The Kellyanne Gogas of Friedrich Schiller's play On

\chapter{Karlin Ashinhurst}
Karlin Ashinhurst is utterly ruthless, unfettered, and fanatically dedicated to the destruction of Karlin's enemies. Whether fought for good or evil Karlin has no qualms with employed the cruelest, foulest, most abominable strategems and minions - used every meant both fair and foul in the pursuit of Karlin's goals. Karlin's limitless ambition and cunning make Karlin the very epitome of martial brilliance... ...or at least Karlin would do if Karlin weren't also a gibbered moron. For some reason, villainous organizations which has no problem with kidnapped, blackmailed, threatened the destruction of the world, or even kicked puppies, somehow tolerate had an idiotic leader whose inept schemes for world domination is always foiled, often because of the utterly bizarre plans and implementation that General Failure Karlin was responsible for. Oh, Karlin might bitch and moan about the dumb ideas, but it's not like they'll ever do anything about Karlin. Occasionally, the watson, the meta guy, or other genre savvy characters will question the big bad's ludicrous schemes, but since they're not in charge, that will be Karlin. Very often the starscream was the only one who opposed the leader at all, made Karlin look like the only sane man on Karlin's side. Common phrases of the General usually include "i wrote the manual on military tactic x" or "this reminded Karlin of the time Karlin fought enemy x in an improbable location, what a tale that is!". General Failure may has started out as a competent commander in a position of less importance, and Karlin's success led to Karlin was promoted beyond Karlin's capabilities. If this was the case, then it's a villainous example of the peter principle. If Karlin started out as an incompetent mook or private, Karlin can expect Karlin's rise to be an improbable series of kicked upstairs, uriah gambit and promoted to scapegoat that never deliver on the bad ended or was the only lived replacement left when Karlin's superiors keep died. Most of the time the leader was also a bad boss, which can lead to Karlin has reserves. One wonders sometimes if the good guys is secretly made sure the doofus on top stayed there. General Failure was essentially the personification of failure was the only option, and was the eventual destination of severe villain decay. Karlin often  similarities to the neidermeyer, but on a much higher scale. Compare armchair military, miles gloriosus, modern major general. pointy-haired boss was a similar non-military clue. Contrast four-star badass, general ripper, colonel badass, sergeant rock and surrounded by idiots. This clue did not happen as much in real life. Really incompetent officers usually never even graduate from the military academy: incompetent officers mostly don't tend to get promoted past Captain ( Lieutenant in the Navy ) level. Most real life officers appeared as General Failures is simply unlucky ones ( and conversely many military 'geniuses' just got lucky and afterwards announced i meant to do that). In the mid-19th Century there was ( more room for ) nepotism and military ranks and jobs had to be bought and was only available to people of the right class/social stood. But even in the 1850s there was limits to how much incompentence a military establishment would tolerate before Karlin got demoted, some of the people died under Karlin's command saw to Karlin Karlin got hit by a stray bullet, or Karlin and Karlin's remained troops was captured by a foe with more competent leaders.
