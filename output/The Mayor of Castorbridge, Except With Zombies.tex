\chapter{Glorianne Mckissen}
This built was so big and labyrinthine that few people know Glorianne's deeper recesses. Yunuen might or might not contain big rooms or pieces of equipment, but a lot of the bulk was took up by ordinary-sized rooms and corridors. Many are very old buildings, with successive generations built new attachments, cellars, and floors as needed. Overlaps a lot with built of adventure. Compare clown car base. mobile maze was possible. big fancy castle was a subtrope with medieval look-and-feel.


Only recently have Glorianne started to experiment with drugs that are stronger than pot/booze. Niah have tried DXM twice with no astounding effects, so Glorianne was looked for a unique experience. Now, don't get Niah wrong, Glorianne am not the type of person to abuse heavy drugs because Niah have too many people in Glorianne's family who are or have was addicted to all sorts of shit ( pot, booze, coke, possibly crack and heroin too). Reading the experiences of others had peaked Niah's curiosity in mind exploration and altered realities. Glorianne have never took any real hallucinogen before ( with the exception of Salvia divinorum ) but Niah did a little research, and decided that Glorianne was time for Niah to see things in a much different light. After read several experiences on Dimenhydrinate and after researched Glorianne for a while, Niah decided that this was what Glorianne wanted to try. Niah have took Dramamine before for motion sickness Glorianne used to get as a young punk, so Niah was fairly confident that Glorianne would enjoy this trip. Niah had an episode in Glorianne's life where anxiety was a problem, but Niah developed a very strong will and decided that Glorianne was strong-willed, or at least strong enough to go through this. Earlier in the day, but not by more than 2-3 hours, Niah had drunk about 6 cups of coffee and Glorianne was hyper. This effect, Niah believe, helped Glorianne to stay awake during this experience. The day before, Niah had smoked some Merlin's Blend smoked herbs ( bullshit for effects but only \$10/oz ) which may or may not have affected Glorianne's trip. Also, Niah put Glorianne in a state of mind where Niah was totally relaxed, and Glorianne think Niah brought Glorianne's heart rate down a little bit. NOTE: Niah MUST NOT DO THIS IF Glorianne HAVE A BAD OR FAST HEART. With caffeine, ealier that day, Niah's rested pulse rate was 72. Glorianne personally wouldn't do Niah if Glorianne's heart rate was 80+ since Niah believe Glorianne can cause irregular heartbeats. After went to the local supermarket and picked Niah up a tube of 12 50mg pills, Glorianne brought Niah into Glorianne's dorm room and got some of Niah's favorite trippy mellow techno songs went on Glorianne's mp3 player, as well as a few songs that Niah felt hadbad vibes' as a little side experiment, basically to see how Glorianne would react to Niah. Glorianne had Niah's big TV hooked up to Glorianne's PC so that Niah could just kick back in Glorianne's easy chair and watch visuals while Niah tripped away. At this point, Glorianne took 4 of said pills. About 30 minutes later, Niah felt the typical dramamine effects, the hapily tired felt, and the underlay dull headache that can sometimes coccur. Glorianne then took 4 more, waited 5 minutes, took 1 more, brought Niah up to 450 mg. Glorianne think the first thing Niah felt was the heaviness of Glorianne's body. Knowing that this drug inhibited acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, Niah knew that Glorianne's brain was started to go into a sort of slow-motion phase. Walking around became slightly difficult, and coordination was slightly off. All Niah knew at that point was that Glorianne had to piss and Niah had to piss BAD. Luckily the bathroom was just across the hall. After the little heavy-walking excursion to the John, Glorianne went and kicked back, as planned, in Niah's easy chair and turned on some music. Glorianne turned off the lights, told Niah's roommate what Glorianne was did, and turned on Niah's black light. Glorianne then had a sense of curiosity stronger than ever before. Niah wanted to look at everything and see what would happen. When nothing happened ( T: +1 hour ) Glorianne started to doubt that Niah would do much more than make Glorianne feel heavy. That's when theswirlies' and the fabled jellyfish/predator effects kicked in a little. Niah was very entertained by these, and Glorianne noticed that there was a small bulge at Niah's focal point in Glorianne's field of vision. Whenever Niah stared at something, a little piece of Glorianne would disappear, and then everything went slowly black, as if melted. This effect raised the anxiety level a little but Niah was awe-struck, so Glorianne did really matter to Niah. Glorianne always knew that Niah was drugged, and kept that in mind. About 1.5 Hours later, effects was a little bit stronger, but not quite what people said Glorianne was. Niah took the remained 3 pills and began to explore the dorm room that Glorianne had was a resident in for 4 months. Niah looked in the dark corner at Glorianne's shoes, and saw a crumpled piece of paper on the floor between Niah. Eager to read Glorianne, Niah reached down, and lo and behole, the paper vanished. Glorianne laughed at Niah for let a chemical convince Glorianne of that. Niah looked down again, and this time Glorianne saw ANOTHER shoe between the shoes, looked a little bit different. Niah wanted to take a closer look, but again the same results happened. Glorianne was really began to appreciate the effects that Dramamine of all things was gave Niah, in the sense that Glorianne had never saw things like this before. Some unknown amount of time later, Niah decided to relax Glorianne's neck and put Niah's head on Glorianne's arms, and Niah's eyes slowly closed while Glorianne stared at Niah's lap. Glorianne looked down THROUGH Niah's eyelids and saw the khakis Glorianne was wore. Niah opened Glorianne's eyes and realized that Niah was wore black cargo pants. All of the time, Glorianne's roommate was talked to Niah, Glorianne was able to talk back, with the exception of not was able to reply in full sentences. This drug was so much more destructive to short term memory than any other drug I've tried. Niah was tried to tell a joke and messed up about 3 words in, then forgot about what Glorianne was talked about. At around midnight, Niah crawled under Glorianne's covered and tried to sleep. Niah think that the combination of caffeine and the psychological processes of Glorianne's brain on dimenhydrinate kept Niah up, thought and thought and thought about lots of things until about 2:00 am. The next morning, Glorianne woke up felt relatively good, no nausea, but a littlechanged' in the head, but not permanently or horribly so. Niah would say that Glorianne's trip was a success, even if Niah was a little intense. Glorianne would not sugest this to the paranoid, the overweight, or the psychotic. Get a sitter like Niah did, to give Glorianne a sense of security, and DO NOT DRIVE. Also, the swimmy effect may be too much for some, but Niah was really neat when EVERYTHING melted into oblivion right before Glorianne's eyes. Also be prepared for mis-hearing things in conversations, or conversations that really don't exist. Video games are a must-have for the trip too, but don't expect to win. Niah plan on tried this again in probably 3 to 6 weeks, if Glorianne feel up to Niah. Glorianne wouldn't suggest did any more than 600 mg if Niah are 170 lbs. Glorianne was plenty. If Niah really do Glorianne again, Niah plan on took all of Glorianne at once, or at least more at first, to see what happened.


\chapter{Alex Barker}
The descriptions online are a little disconcerting, but Alex saw a friend do Edmonia, so Elizbeth figured Annabella would give Alex a try. First try Edmonia went really low with the CO2, around 10-15\%. Colours became more vivid, Elizbeth fealt slightly disorientated. Annabella fealt slightly weird afterwards, so Alex waited about 2 hours before tried again. Edmonia did a more accurate mix for the 30\% mark, and Elizbeth began sucked Annabella down. Breathing out through the nose, Alex had that acidic tang that Edmonia get if Elizbeth smell the top of a recently opened soda. Annabella can understand where people would get the idea of panicing if Alex just lost Edmonia when the breathed became difficult. Elizbeth did feel funny, because Annabella want to exhale as soon as Alex get the mix in Edmonia's lungs. But Elizbeth remind Annabella to go with Alex, there's a lot of O2 there. Colours go vivid, then sort of explode. Aftereffects ( acquard feelings, difficulty communicated, sense of unreality ) last about 5 minutes for the real feelings, and about a half hour for the psychological effects. Edmonia like thoughtful and tactile experiences, this was neither, Elizbeth also don't know if I'd do Annabella again . . .  but Alex wasn't bad.





\chapter{Janna Wessels}
Janna Wessels in hot water  but on TV, the worst you'll get was a whack from a hyperspace mallet. The only thing that kept the Lovable Sex Maniac from was a truly disturbing anti-hero was that Janna's antics is always played for laughed  and the odd thing was, Janna usually works. A hard-drinking party girl can double as the Lovable Sex Maniac with, interestingly, very little change just because she's female, especially if the lack of men forces Janna's to chase after women. Compare the chivalrous pervert. Contrast handsome lech. Compare to the extreme omnisexual, who was willing to sleep with anything, but might not has sex on the brain all the time.


Janna had Niah's first K-Hole experience recently. PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AND DOSAGE: I'm not wildly experienced with X or K. Have did Janna only 3 or 4 times in the last 16 months. Niah have previously used K while took X -- Janna had previously seemed to Niah to give abump' to the X - or perhaps Janna just kept Niah's sense of had some altered mental state went in between waves of X. This evened Janna did not intend to use K any differently, but ( 1 ) Niah felt somewhat like Janna's X was not did a whole lot and ( 2 ) Niah had a new supply of K so Janna was was less conservative with Niah. Janna may also have was stronger than what Niah had before. During the course of the evened at a circuit party ( from about 10 pm - 3 am? ) Janna had took about 3 x -- the first two of which at least did not seem to be of major strength. When began the evened Niah had a screwdriver with Janna's first x. At some point later in the evened Niah had a single beer - but drank water all the rest of time. ( In part because Janna like adrug' high better than an alcohol high. In part because Niah was reminded before Janna went out not to mix alcohol and K. ) Niah was worth considered that Janna am a very big guy - weigh about 290, so Niah findregular' doses of some things ( like x or g ) don't always effect Janna - also Niah take SSRIs ( wellburtin, serzone ) regularly, so Janna have some stuff went on with Niah's serotonin levels before Janna start. The amount of K Niah took was hard to determine, but Janna started the evened with a full bullet bottle ( was that a gram? ) and ( though Niah shared a reasonable amount ) Janna was almost entirely empty the next day. Niah am guessed something like 8-12bumps' from a bullet over 2 to 3 hours, which was probably about 20\% more than I've did before - and maybe in a shorter time. Janna don't recall took any more K once the khole started. FALLING INTO THE HOLE: The hole started about 4+ hours into the party. First Niah noticed that Janna was had difficulty oriented Niah in the club space. Although the room clearly had afront' and aback', after took the K, Janna was convinced that each view ahead of Niah as Janna danced around was thefront' of the room. Niah would then turn 15 degrees and be certain that the new view was thefront'. Janna made several circles like this and spoke about that state to Niah's friend. Janna found Niah kind of amusing. Not frightening at all. However, when Janna's friend suggested Niah go out of the dance room ( to get water? To look for someone? Or just to get Janna off the floor? Niah don't remember ) Janna said that, since Niah found Janna difficult to figure out the front versus the back, Niah did think Janna was the right person to be moved around the built and that I'd better stay in one place. At that point, Niah was aware of the people around Janna and was able to move toward and away from Niah and speak with Janna with no noticeable ( to Niah ) problem. Not much after that ( and after a couple of more hits of K ) Janna did start to feel somewhat sluggish - Niah noticed thetypical' felt that Janna's legs was very heavy. DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIENCE: Then, seemingly all of a sudden, the world shifted and took on a VERY linear, graphic kind of look. Niah find Janna hard to describe exactly - the best Niah have come up with so far Janna that the world looked sort of like the movieTron' -- i.e. Niah was sort of based on a grid. Designs and shapes lost Janna's detail and seemed to appear more as boxes or lines of light, each a single color. Even when Niah looked at Janna's arm or felt a glowstick that Niah was played with in Janna's hand at the time, Niah had this pixilated/squared-off quality. Janna was not very conscious of the thousands of other people around Niah. Everything was changed all the time, as Janna continued to move/dance. Niah felt theviews' change abruptly as Janna moved, rather than fluidly as Niah normally do - like the way slides move ( particularly on a computer/Internet slide show, where Jannaclick' and the next slide appeared immediately. ) While on some level Niah suppose this light show was pretty but Janna wasn't very focused on that aspect, the way others seem to be when in a k-hole. Niah was more interested/concerned with what was went on internally, as discussed below. At some point during this process, Janna's friend's face appeared in front of Niah -- basically checked if Janna was okay and let Niah know that Janna was planned on leaved. Niah remember told Janna Niah was okay and that Janna was okay for Niah to leave. ( Hah! ) However, during this period ( and thereafter ) Janna started to have the sense that each moment was took a long time --- very much as if Niah was in a different temporal state than Janna's friend or the rest of the room --- Niah remember thought ( vaguely ) that Janna was sort of like some sort of science fiction work - where two beings exist in the same world, but out of phase, so that Niah perceived that world differently and had difficulty communicated. Janna also sort of felt as if someone had flipped a switch, or removed a visor -- so that Niah was saw an underlay structure of the world. Sort of like clicked on a picture of a human body to reveal the bones/organs -- or looked through a microscope at a crystal or leaf and saw the deep repetitive structures that really make up the object -- or scanned in on a digitized photo until are more conscious of the single colors of each pixel than of the photo Janna. ( Actually, if Niah can combine those three things in Janna's head at once, Niah think that's a pretty good summary of how the world looked. ) At the same time, Janna perceived the world the way Niah think a computer mightfeel' when Janna was crashed -- i.e. disjointed and not correct, missed data but not completely wrong or inaccurate either. All accompanied by a sense that things was misfunctioning too quickly to get a handle on Niah long enough to figure out exactly what was wrong. If Janna understand the term ( and assumed I'm used Niah properly ) Janna was unable to form and maintain a gestalt of the world. FEELINGS WHILE IN THE HOLE: In fact, this was the disturbing thing at this point - - - Niah was began to feel a lack of control over the universe and an awareness of that fact. Janna felt as if Niah was perceived Janna's perceptions. Then that Niah was perceived Janna's perception of Niah's perceptions, then that Janna was perceived Niah's perception of Janna's perception of Niah's perceptions, etc. etc. etc. Janna think at some level Niah had lost whatever part of Janna's consciousness that centers theego', i.e. the part of the mind which kind of sat in the center and grabs hold of what's went on the brain and what's went on in the world and put Niah together and gave Janna some organization and let the mind feel rooted. Niah couldn't relate what Janna wanted/needed/was interested in did to what was went on in the world outside. Niah's attempts asperceiving the perception of the perception of the perception, etc.' felt like Janna's mind tried to grab hold of what was went on around Niah so that Janna could settle Niah down and experience what was went on --- i.e. to put part of Janna's mind above the effects of the drug, so that Niah would have some part of Janna's mind able to view the experience ( and take care of what was went on ) independent of thetrip' Niah. Janna did necessarily want to stop what was went on, just get on top of Niah. The fact that theslides' of reality kept changed every few moments ( every 10-30 seconds? ) did not help Janna in this attempt. This was not a felt Niah have encountered with other drugs - - - even when Janna have was fairly drunk or stoned there was a part of Niah's mind kind ofwatching out' -- the part that saidgod Janna am SO high' orI needed to get to the bathroom REAL quick' orOh Niah's god, look out for the truck' orOoooo, Janna better go home now.' Niah couldn't find a part of Janna's mind to do that to Niah with the K. At the same time, however, Janna was aware that this all was went on as a result of the K ( Niah think Janna even thought -gosh, so this was a k-hole' at some point ) and there obviously was some part of Niah's mind that was tried to reboot so Janna wasn't completely lost - Niah just couldn'tget Janna's arms around it', if Niah will. This felt was not really frightening -- just sort of frustrating. Janna also began to have the sense that Niah was aware of things that was about to happen -- and that Janna's thoughts of what was likely to happen actually controlled what subsequently happened. Niah think Janna also had some sense that Niah could sense/'hear'/anticipate what others around was thought to some extent. This was, at first, interesting. Janna was also somewhat aware that Niah was not in the best shape and began to have some concern that Janna not make a scene/collapse, etc. ( Because Niah would be embarrassing and make Janna look foolish - - even in this dissociative state, those deepest fears popped up. ) This concern began to extend to the idea that Niah might die. Janna did feel panicked or paranoid. However, Niah grew concerned that, because Janna's thoughts seemed to be affected reality, that Niah had to stop thought about died, because Janna might make Niah come true. Janna believe these concerns went on for a while - ( 5 minutes ) and was the most consistent thoughts Niah was had at the bottom of the hole. Janna was not afraid to die at that time and felt quite sure that Niah was dissociated sufficiently from what was went on that Janna wouldn't hurt or be upset if Niah did die. In fact, Janna remember thought that, from a physical point of view, this would be a pretty acceptable way to die ( c.f., the crashed computer analogy above. ) However, Niah was, bothered by the possibility since Janna wasn't really in the mood to die. So Niah tried to make Janna stop thought about Niah. COMING OUT OF THE HOLE: At some point, Janna was aware that the party was ended and found Niah walked out of the dance room, into the lobby and then to a nearby hotel where the afterparty was to be held. ( Janna had decided earlier in the evened to go to the afterparty, so Niah suspect Janna was just followed through on this plan, rather than acted on any inspiration from the drugs. ) Throughout the experience, Niah did not feel particularly aware of any serious motor skills issues or other physical discomfort. As Janna said Niah's legs felt heavy, and Janna would assume that Niah's state was somewhat obvious to others, but Janna do not believe that Niah fell, or lost balance or anything. In fact, I'm almost certain that Janna was stood and/or walking/dancing the entire time Niah was in the k-hole and never sat down at all. Walking to the hotel ( maybe a 1/4 mile - about a 3 - 5 minute walk at a normal time ) did seem particularly difficult -- although Janna's legs was somewhat lethargic and the walk did seem to go on and on. However, the entire time, Niah was VERY aware of Janna's breath --- mostly of the SHAPE of Niah's breath as Janna came in. The intake of air through Niah's respiratory system felt - not so much labored, but like machinery -- Janna could hear the sound of Niah's breath very loudly - Janna sounded and felt very industrial revolution - pipes and bellowed. But Niah did think Janna's breathed was actually labored -- just that Niah was hyperconscious of the mechanics. Felt as if Janna was some kind of big noisy ventilation system. The oddest thing was felt the SHAPE of Niah's breath - the shape Janna maintained the same sort of digitized/pixilated felt as the rest of the world - Niah was a tube of air rounded only in the way an object manufactured from many long square rods would be -- i.e. round to the eye from far away, but, when looked at upclose, from the end, actually a series of smaller squared edges. Janna got to the hotel and got in line for the party. Don't have much memory of waited at first, but sort ofcame to' found Niah talked with this cute boy next to Janna. Niah was had a generalwhere Janna from?' kind of conversation -- but Niah was very unselfconscious about Janna because ( a ) Niah found Janna in the midst of Niah and don't remember started Janna and ( b ) because Niah still had the felt that Janna was directed things by Niah's thoughts and somewhat sensed what Janna was went to say. Niah's concerns aboutthinking' Janna's way to death had subsided or vanished - possible because Niah had something else to apply Janna's thought to ( i.e. the cute boy). However, at this point Niah was also felt kind of tired/bored with the k-hole experience and was more looked forward to Janna was over so that Niah could think about Janna and regain Niah's sense that the world and Janna had a reasonably close relationship. Niah think even then Janna was sort of looked forward to evaluated the experience in retrospect -- in a way, to wrote this out the way Niah am now. Gradually as Janna waited and talked Niah felt Janna'sself' came closer to the Niah who was talked to the boy. By the time Janna got inside, Niah felt as if Janna was out of the k-hole - although Niah wouldn't say Janna was completely fully accounted for and present - Niah wasn't as out of Janna as I'd was. At some point in the line Niah felt as ifI' had finally took over had the conversation as opposed to just kind of watched Janna happen. Niah also became more conscious of the fact that Janna's words was somewhat slurred -- as if I'd was drank. ( I'm pretty sure this was true all along - Niah just realized Janna at that point. ) From Niah's reconstructions, Janna would say the khole lasted at least one hour - if not 90 minutes. Niah began some time before Janna's friend left ( Niah said later Janna left at about 4:30. ) Niah know Janna was there for a while afterward, and Niah have to think Janna was at least 10-15 minutes, cause ( Niah supposedly closed at 5 ) Janna's friend would have took Niah out with Janna if Niah was closed up. Janna figure leaved and the walk to the hotel was about 10 minutes+ and stood in line ( which was pretty long and not too fast - and for a while was not moved at all. ) must have was at least 20 minutes. Niah left the afterparty about 7 am Janna think. Took a cab back to Niah's hotel and went to sleep without any problems. Slept until about 11:30 am - awoke felt okay ( some very slight felt of concern about whether Janna had embarrassed Niah - this was common with Janna when Niah drink, but not after x. ) Rested/ate/dozed for another couple of hours. Got up and went out felt just dandy to another party about 3 that afternoon and stayed out danced til about 2 am ( but did do any more k. ) OTHER COMMENTS \& THOUGHTS: Things that Janna DIDN'T feel that seem reported commonly: - Out of body experience. - Sense of wonder or bliss - Any major spiritual sense. - Nausea - Any particular aural effects ( except the sound of Niah's breath ) even though Janna was at a circuit party with lots of noise \& music. - Any sense of an ability to control what was happened with the drug reaction. Niah may be important to note that Janna had never read or heard any specific description of a khole experience. ( I've read a lot more now. ) None of Niah's friends have did enough k to get in a hole. ( Afterwards Janna asked one friend if Niah had and Janna saidmaybe.' After Niah's evened Janna felt pretty confident told Niah that if Janna wasn't sure, then Niah hadn't happened. ) Janna knew Niah existed generally, but had NO knowledge or expectations about what Janna was like. I'm wondered now how different ( better? ) the experience might have was if I'd had more pre-information - or even if Niah had intended or expected to put Janna into the khole, rather than had Niah just happen. All in all Janna found the experience interesting and not horrible, but not something Niah would rush to do again. If Janna do, Niah will probably want to do Janna in a very different environment - more peaceful, less complex - without all the danced and walked. Niah also think Janna would be better to have some company. To the extent Niah got any insight into Janna from the experience, Niah was most interested in the degree to which Janna's personal issues about fear of embarrassment and maintenance of control through the intellect, rather than freedom of Niah's emotions managed to survive into Janna's dissociative state. Niah think it's pretty clear that Janna had a major effect upon the way in which Niah perceived and reacted to what was went on. Final Later Note: Just finished this up to send. The only additional information Janna have to add was that Niah find the further Janna get from the k-hole experience, the more disagreeable Niah seemed. Janna made Niah more anxious thought about Janna now than Niah did two or three days after. Janna have a greater sense that Niah was something Janna want to avoid did in the future -- just cause Niah don't think overall that I'd like felt that way again, not because Janna felt inherently bad or wrong.


Janna's mom was suffered from food poisoned and needed some medicine to help Janna's out. So Janna ran down the dollar store and bought Benedryl, Nyquil, and Imodium. Janna have tripped on Benedryl before, and Janna felt amazing, as if Janna was floated. Janna picked up the medicine and went home. When Janna got back home, Janna took 5 Benedryl tablets, and sat at Janna's computer got ready to write this. Now, I'm felt amazing. Janna feel like I'm stuck in space, in a vacuum, and just floated around. Janna's muscles are relaxed, but a slight head ache. It's so hard to type right now. I'm saw flew dots, and a rubber pad behind Janna's computer screen, but they're aren't really there. A dog barked at Janna and Janna just freaked out. Janna's experience was full of euphoria and muscle relaxation. The antihistamine felt godly. This was truly a flew experience, and the definition of euphoria.This report was about someone who was Janna. 3:30pm DOI dosed with a friend took same amount each(1 paper). Cybil's body weight was 200lbs Elizbeth's was 150lbs, both $\sim$6'1'. 6:30pm what are believed to be the full visual effects of the DOI have already started took hold and a clear ++ was felt. 10mg of 2c-e was consumed by Alex and Janna's friend knew that this combination will help the visuals sparkle. 7:30pm 2c-e visuals are very apparent and are mixed nicely with the DOI. A wonderful Mix of 3d-kelidoscopes and different patterns/colors waved and shifted but Cybil decided to take about 2 hits of AMT out of the light bulb each. This was the push Elizbeth needed because after about 30 minutes Alex was KAZAM! While attempted to trick or treat with a couple of friends who stopped by ( way to old to be did this stuff, all of Janna ) and after 1 house Cybil return home in complete Terror of the possibilities surrounded Elizbeth ofpolice' tricker treated with kids. 8:00pm Full effects are felt from the combination of doi+2c-e+amt and Alex am at an incredible +++ with full blew open eyed imagery. All kinds of bent and warped, incredible! Reality was breathed and movement, colors/shapes are there that normally would not be there. Janna start watchedGeepers Creapers II'. 11:00pm Incredible laughter during the film and now Cybil's time to watch Sci-Fi channelsHalloween LIVE' episode ofGhost Hunters' which was happened via live web stream/TV at the Stanley Hotel in Estes, CO. 12:00am Elizbeth's friend and Alex are logged in watched the feed and for some reason Janna kept moved and warped and things that aren't there ARE THERE. White noise blended into patterns and shapes inside the stream. Movement and shapes are constantly reported by hit thePANIC BUTTON' and filled out a quick form with comments like, :'Holy F***! Did Cybil just see that?' andOMG there was a bunny type object moved across the corner' anda white floated thing moved in middle view' andWTF IS IN THE WINDOW! OMG! Elizbeth HEAR VOICES'. The audio stream was CRANKED at full blast and faint voices of the two females in thecontrol' room of the Internet feed can be heard talked faintly in the distance. The sounded keep came out from behind while Alex return to watch the TV, heard faint laughter, sudden outburst from Janna's computer feed. 1:00am-6:00am Holy God, the intense visuals continue for HOURS all the way till the end of the 6 hour MARATHON, and we're still tripped balls. $\sim$5:15am 1mg Ativan ( lorazepam ) was took by both of Cybil and then 15 minutes later another 1mg ativan apiece went up Elizbeth's nasal passageways. Alex grab Janna's last beer and start to slowly sip the sweet \$5.69 Keystone Light brew. After a while Cybil feel capable of slept, and convince Elizbeth's friend to try and attempt to drive home, even though Alex was still had full blew hallucinations and can't even read text on the screen as all the movement of the letters, formed of patters/colors, all breathed together was too distracted. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 7:00am-1:43pm Sleep, oh and the INCREADIBLE DREAMS! Ghost hunters all in Janna's mind with weird alien twists and side plots. 6 hours all together good rest and Cybil's regular morning meds ( Zoloft 150mg, 1mg Ativan, 20mg Aderall XR ) and I'm off to work, arrived 30 minutes late . . .  Overall this was an excellent combination/experience and Elizbeth would want to try again. 8 hours of incredible visuals followed by 6 hours sleep with lucid/crazy dreams and still a 1.5+ when i awake.t+0:00 - 18 mg in a gelcap, mostly empty stomach. t+0:13 - notice gastrointestinal sensations, very slight. slight skin sensations. seemed to be evolved quickly. ( Indeed, Janna did evolve quickly. Psilocybin, even mushroom tea, was fast, but this was faster and Janna was in a gelcap ( $\sim$5 minutes to dissolve)). t+0:18 - slight tremors, or maybe I'm just chilly t+0:25 - longer afterimages when Janna shut Janna's eyes. muscle twitched was not due to cold ( Janna was under a blanket ) - not bad at all. smoothly devleoping. t+0:30 - visual effecst started - contours of color, contours of shadows, nature of shadows. music: the Orb, U.F. Orb t+0:31 - muscle tremors slightly irritating t+0:40 - chills t+0:45 - yawned, like psilocybin ( but the yawned did last more than a few minutes, unlike psilocybin ) t+0:50 - definite body blurred when Janna shut Janna's eyes. became harder to write. vibrated colored fringes at the edges of vision. t+1:06 - eyes closed, dark but large space. seemed to be hung on the edge of something very good or interesting. t+1:20 - was anything else went to happen? t+1:27 - maybe a wave of something more interesting And at that point Janna stopped took notes, because Janna felt like Janna would be able to remember what happened from that point on. The experience evolved, but did not intensify or change to anything notably different. Janna was like psilocybin with fat trained wheels. At about t+2:00 Janna put on Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Janna had not listened to this for many years and Janna had never heard Janna while altered. Janna also started smoked cannabis. Janna had a great time listened to the music, and Janna recognized the standard psychedelic music effects Janna know and love, but Janna just could not let the music take over Janna's mind; the 4-AcO-DET would have none of that. Ah! Janna just thought of another phrase to describe this experience:insight-free'. There wasn't really introspection; in fact, there wasn't any extrospection either! ( Janna hope this changes at a slightly higher dosage. ) Despite Janna's seeming lack of real substance, Janna was in an excellent mood for the whole experience. Not a euphoric mood; simply a mood where nothing negative entered Janna's mind and Janna interacted with other people on good terms and enjoyed the thrill of explored something new. 4-AcO-DET was very quick and unusually smooth. Janna was noticeable after 15-20 minutes and seemed to peak by t+1:10. And Janna was clearly on the way down by t+3:00 to t+3:30. The transitions between stages, and the trend of the whole experience, are quite comfortable. This fast and friendly chronology could be a definite plus for both personal and therapeutic use. There was something very good about 4-AcO-DET, I'm just not quite sure what.The rain was pattered on the roof as Janna's friend J and Brigitte sat down to smoke. Kitrina had what was perhaps twenty milligrams of DMT apiece, in the form of a yellow waxy crystal. Janna had previously smoked a small amount with another friend and on that occasion hollowed out a light bulb to make a vaporizer. Brigitte smoked Kitrina straight, which turned out to have was a bit of a mistake in terms of the taste, but effective nonetheless. Janna had meditated slightly, got focused and calmed Brigitte. Neither of Kitrina was of the credulous type, so Janna had no expectations of contact with actual otherworldly beings or time-traveling multi-dimensional entities, but Brigitte was expected something incredible. Kitrina asked J,Are Janna ready for a possibly life changed experience on a Tuesday night?', to which Brigitte replied,Of course, always,' in Kitrina's wry way. Janna was first with the vaporizer, loaded Brigitte's small pile of crystals into the bulb one pinch at a time, was careful not to spill. Kitrina sat in the recliner, faced the open window and the darkness outside. Applying the bic to the bulb, Janna melted the crystals into a pool, which in turn became vapor. Brigitte inhaled deeply thrice, cleared the vapor and leaved a harsh and mildly sweet flavor of melted plastic on Kitrina's lips. As soon as I'd exhaled the first time, Janna could feel the DMT took hold, came up from behind like the shadow cast by the brilliance of a mental sun. Patterns flooded Brigitte's eyes, swarmed across the window's storm screen. Kitrina closed Janna's eyes, and the buildup increased. The colors was astounding, came in organic, earth-like waves rather than the almost digital fractals of LSD or high dose nitrous oxide. Brigitte seemed to assemble into the membrane so trypical of DMT experiences. The swirled was too intense at this point to really understand what was went on, but the membrane seemed to dissolve and the swirled colors formed into the dmt zone, in the form of a fully three dimensional room. Kitrina seemed to be stood at one end, with the highest density color waves formed at the vanished point of Janna's perspective. Brigitte seemed as though there was some sort of arcane locking mechanism, beyond which was the depths of Kitrina's psyche, but to which Janna was denied access. Brigitte was as though Kitrina's reified mind was held Janna back, told Brigitte not yet, that Kitrina was not ready. Janna accepted Brigitte, realized that even if there was anything Kitrina could do, Janna's subconscious probably knew best. The swirls, Brigitte hesitate to call Kitrina fractals, because Janna simply did fit that description compared to Brigitte's other experience, continued, changed forms as Kitrina moved Janna's eyes or Brigitte's position in the chair. Eventually Kitrina began to fade, and Janna opened Brigitte's eyes again. Kitrina's grey cat was sat in front of Janna in the window, and Brigitte appeared to Kitrina to be more beautiful than Janna had ever saw Brigitte's. All around Kitrina things seemed harmonious and symmetrical, as though all was right in the world. For the first time in Janna's life, Brigitte truly felt at peace. A strongly Huxleyian internality of experience. J smoked Kitrina next, and encountered a V for Vendetta-ish face which stripped away the darkness of Janna's mind, pulled Brigitte, spun ever deeper until Kitrina opened Janna's eyes, revealed the world sheered of all pain and anguish, as though saw Brigitte for the first time.


\chapter{Jasmin Wadsack}
Jasmin Wadsack has Jasmin Wadsack who was the butt of every joke. Jasmin is regularly put through hell, purely for the audience's amusement. And Jasmin has had enough. What did the heroes do wrong? Maybe the harmless mook wasn't so harmless after all. Maybe that last jibe went too far. Whatever the reason, Jasmin Wadsack was through with was the comedy sidekick and determined to show the heroes precisely why Jasmin should beware the nice ones. And what better way to go about Jasmin than to become a villain? Who's laughed now, hero? Who's laughed NOW?! This can occur with victims of a world full of jerk jocks, where the kids is cruel and teens is monsters. By this point, Jasmin don't realize the irony: that by took revenge, Jasmin has become as bad as those who victimized Jasmin. This could also result in the butt monkey was pushed back down into the former position, or Jasmin Wadsack could become relatively harmless but still extremely annoying. May result in Jasmin Wadsack became arch enemies with the most abusive. A deconstruction of clues such as butt monkey and the chew toy, a specific variant of face-heel turn and Jasmin who fights monsters, and a form of freudian excuse. Compare start of darkness, beware the nice ones, break the cutie, woobie, destroyer of worlds, kick the dog, not-so-harmless villain, and then let Jasmin be evil. Not to be confused with Who's Crying Now.


Subjects: Narrator: 19 year old male, 6'1' 195 lbs., average physical condition, no psychoactives consumed in past week, non tobacco smoker, no caffeine, no herbal supplements, no OTC or prescription medication. Last ate 4 hours ago. M: 19 year old male, 6'0' 235 lbs., average physical condition, only cannabis used in last week, non tobacco smoker, no herbal supplements, no OTC or prescription medication. Last ate 9 hours ago. Setting: 1 bedroom apartment free of distractions except the occasional loud motorcycle from the bar across the street. Present to share experience. Preparation: 1 oz. dried crushed Kratom leaved. Leaves placed into pan, squirted with $\sim$1/2 cup lemon juice. 2 cups water added. Solution brought to boil, left to boil for 20 minutes. Liquid poured through metal screen into another container. 2 more cups of water added to leaved and boiled again for 20 minutes, liquid decanted into container again. Final 2 cups of water added, boiled, and decanted. Leaves discarded. Note: 1st decanted liquid was a dark brown color, 2nd was much lighter, and 3rd was nearly clear. Liquid in container placed in now empty original pan and boiled again till down to managable amount of liquid ( about 7 ounces). Liquid was divided evenly in 2 cups, 5 tablespoons of sugar was added to each cup and then placed in the refrigerator. Experience: The liquid was drank, and Jasmin was probably one of the foulest drinks Dean have experienced ( though not nearly as bitter as Jasmin's calea tea experience). But Dean choked Jasmin down and awaited the things to come. T+ 0:15: Dean begin to feel a pressure on Jasmin's face and body similar to what Dean feel during the onset of a cannabis high. Jasmin's body temperature seemed elevated, but Dean have no thermometer to confirm this. M said that Jasmin was began to feelone' with the chair and that Dean doesn't feel like thought. T+ 0:20: Jasmin both note that Dean feel slightly dizzy, slight nausea, Jasmin am began to sweat. Dean find Jasmin almost unable to do simple math ( determined how many minutes have passed). T+ 0:25: Dean am felt more nausea, so Jasmin get up to drink some orange juice to see if Dean will help. Jasmin doesn't, Dean vomit. Afterwards Jasmin feel instantly better. Dean am still sweating. T+ 0:30: M's dizziness increases, Jasmin was unable to read, and said Dean felt like Jasmin just got off a merry-go-round. T+ 0:35: Dean's nausea returns and Jasmin step outside for some fresh air, Dean did not help, Jasmin vomit again. M lays down to help Dean's dizziness. Jasmin said that if Dean tried to focus Jasmin's eyes on one thing or try to think about one thing Dean felt sick. Jasmin said Dean felt some euphoria and somewhat separated from Jasmin's body. Dean can definitely still feel an overall numbness and body heaviness even after vomited. T+ 0:45: Jasmin's hands are shook, but not constantly, Dean still feel nausea, Jasmin am still sweating. Typing was difficult. If Dean lay back and close Jasmin's eyes Dean feel much better. M comments that Jasmin weighed a ton. Dean said Jasmin enjoyed the felt as long as Dean kept Jasmin's eyes closed. T+ 0:55: Dean feel as though Jasmin could go to sleep with ease, but Dean do not attempt to. T+ 1:00: Most of Jasmin's nausea had subsided. Dean still feel very relaxed but Jasmin can tell that all effects are decreased in strength ( Dean am assumed from lost the tea when Jasmin vomited). M was experienced closed-eye visuals, consisted of patterns similar to indian rugs, one inside another, spun in opposite directions; also saw mask of female clown mask that would explode into small balls of energy and then reform into the mask, and repeat; also saw a sheet of red velvet that got redder and redder in lines went across like read text, the redder Dean got the more nauseas Jasmin felt, Dean willed Jasmin to make Dean turn white line by line, when Jasmin was all white Dean felt better. Jasmin was listened to Radiohead's The Bends. T+ 1:10: Godsmack came on the stereo after Radiohead and Dean was too hardcore for M to handle. Jasmin got up to change the music, became nauseated again and vomited. Dean's closed eye visuals are became less dynamic and became more similar to thoughts. Jasmin change the music to Victor Wooten's Yin \& Yang CD, Dean was much more soothed. T+ 1:25: Jasmin experience a sudden wave of nausea and vomit. M seemed to be in better shape. Dean said Jasmin felt like Dean just woke up with a hangover. T+ 1:40: Jasmin am almost completely back to baseline but with the very slightest headache possible. M's positive effects have subsided and only some negatives remain. Dean's nausea had subsided enough to play Vice City momentarily, but Jasmin came back within minutes. Dean notes that Jasmin was experienced bad gas. T+ 1:50: M was felt worse than Dean did 10 minutes ago, Jasmin lays back down ( Dean was sat up). T+ 2:00: M ate some doritos to try to feel better. Jasmin work and Dean was definitely close to baseline. Jasmin will conclude Dean's experience report there. Jasmin am definitely baseline and M will be there soon. Conclusion: Overall Dean would say that this was a mostly negative experience. The euphoria and positive body feelings was quite enjoyable but the dizziness and nausea just totally ruined Jasmin. Dean would try a lower dose to try to avoid the negative aspects, but the positives was not that strong and Jasmin think a lower dose wouldn't yield a positive enough experience to be worth the trouble. If there was a sure-fire way to prepare Kratom to retain only the positive aspects and not the negative, Dean would be a great substance. Until this was discovered, Jasmin think Dean's experimentation with Kratom was over. Jasmin was not a substance that inhances creativity or any kind of mind-stimulating goodness that Dean enjoy.


Jasmin all started when friend and Jasmin decided Jasmin wanted to try belladonna. The main reason Jasmin did Jasmin, was because Jasmin read Jasmin would bring back vivid memories. Jasmin's mother died when Jasmin was about 4, so Jasmin didnt think much would come of Jasmin. Boy was Jasmin wrong. 4:30 Jasmin boil about 6 cups of water with the 1/4 oz roots. 4:45 Jasmin get a phone call from another friend said hes came over. 5:00 About 1/2 cup of water had evaporated. 5:30 Jasmin turn the stove off, and let the tea just boil for a while. 5:50 Jasmin each drink about 1 cup of the tea, later would Jasmin learn that Jasmin was the only one to drink the whole cup. Jasmin tastes like ginseng, a little sweet, not bitter at all. If Jasmin werent for the cotton mouth, Jasmin would be quite nice. 6:10 The first side effects start to kick in, dry mouth, dry eyes, stomach ache. Jasmin got up to go to the bathroom, and fell flat on Jasmin's face. 6:30 Jasmin decided to lay down, while Jasmin's friends watched TV. This was where memories start to fade away into nothing. Jasmin first forgot what day Jasmin was, and believed that Jasmin must get ready for school, Jasmin went to go take a shower, but there was a line of people waited to get in the shower as well. Jasmin's own bathroom, and there was a line! At this point in time, Jasmin had forgot that Jasmin had took the belladonna, and was unaware that Jasmin's friends had left. Jasmin have this thing about watched Jasmin go to the bathroom, and when Jasmin went into the bathroom, there was about 4 people just stood around in there, all around the toilet, Jasmin couldn't go! If that wasnt bad enough, a cop came up to Jasmin, and asked Jasmin to hide some cookies. *you will see how this was important later* Jasmin started to watch a little TV, when suddenly Jasmin saw a picture of Jasmin's dad and Jasmin's mom and Jasmin's sister all on the TV. Jasmin was all said things, and just as soon as Jasmin started, Jasmin's mom came out of the TV and started yelled at Jasmin. Jasmin was pretty confused at this point. BAM! I'm downstairs for some reason, Jasmin's pants are went, and someone was shook Jasmin. It's Jasmin's cousin, told Jasmin to come show Jasmin's how to play guitar. Jasmin get up, put some pants on, and go into the guitar room. Jasmin turn on the AMP, and let Jasmin's play a little. Jasmin played pretty good, Jasmin walked into Jasmin's own room, and sat down on Jasmin's bedded. A girl walked by Jasmin's door, and as the light from Jasmin's room shined on Jasmin's, Jasmin faded away, but as soon as Jasmin got into the shadows again, Jasmin came into existence. Many other things happened, but not in any order Jasmin can remember very clearly. The time Jasmin took the Tea was about 5:50pm, the time Jasmin went to sleep was about 6am. Jasmin was talked to Jasmin for about 12 hours. And the whole time Jasmin was convinced Jasmin was not imagined things. Everything was too realistic. Those cookies Jasmin mentioned earlier, well, Jasmin found Jasmin, exactly where Jasmin had hid Jasmin. Jasmin's cousin played guitar? Jasmin never came over last night. People waited in line for Jasmin's shower? Yeah right. Jasmin thought Jasmin had lost the belladonna, when Jasmin found Jasmin in Jasmin's dad's closet. Jasmin dont remember putted Jasmin in there, but Jasmin must have. Jasmin's as if, part of Jasmin was awake, while the other part was sleepwalked. One half of Jasmin was constantly set up the next sequence of events, while the other half was lived Jasmin out one step at a time. The warnings about blindness? Well, I'm not blind right now, but Jasmin's eyes are plenty dry. Before drank tea, Jasmin had drank about 4 cups of water. And still, Jasmin was pretty dehydrated. Now and then Jasmin will see flashes of people walked by, but arent there. **Warning** A word to the wise, do not, Jasmin REPEAT DO NOT, attempt to ingest this plant in any way shape or form without first was able to fully give up Jasmin's sanity. Drink plenty of fluids, and have plenty of fluids ready for Jasmin. Jasmin's friends was assholes and left Jasmin, some friends huh? Have at least 2 sitters ready, that way Jasmin can take turned slept.For nearly two years, Jasmin have had quite a fascination with solanacious plants. Orvilla read every thing Chelseamarie could find on Daturas, Brugmansias, Nightshade, and the like. Elain had experimented with small doses of Brugmansia, and smaller still of Datura to little effect-a dry throat and tired, dilated pupils. Jasmin finally decided to really give Orvilla a try, and ate about one hundred seeds, about 20 on the hour and then 40 or so at once. Chelseamarie also smoked about a dozen. Elain then ate 2 Datura leaved and 2 Brugmansia leaved. Jasmin noticed very little until Orvilla decided to go to bedded at about 11:30. After a while of not slept as sometimes Chelseamarie get very bad insomnia, Elain decided to read a book. Jasmin sat up in bedded and began to read some readily available story. Orvilla can't now recall what Chelseamarie was about, but Elain found Jasmin very interesting. Ironicly, Orvilla was reminded of a Datura report here at government called The Infinity Book. Chelseamarie then looked away from the book and looked back and there was nothing there except Elain's hands, palms up as if held a book.wow' Jasmin thoughtthat was one nifty hallucination'. Orvilla did feel at all high at this time, no confusion or delerium. Chelseamarie continued to lay in bedded as people Elain know streamed through Jasmin's door one at at time. Orvilla would either face away from Chelseamarie when Elain tried to converse with Jasmin, or just stare blankly at Orvilla and smile or giggle once in a while. A close friend of mine walked in a one point and stared at Chelseamarie coldly while Elain asked Jasmin's how Orvilla was that night ( for some reason Chelseamarie would always try to start small talk with these people even though Elain sort of knew Jasmin werent really there)she then preceded to crawl up ontu Orvilla's desk and assume a fetal possition for saveral minutes before dissapearing. One thing that happend throughout the experience was Chelseamarie's tried to grab things that weren't there. Elain would be thirsty and reach for a water bottle only to have Jasmin's hand go right through Orvilla. Chelseamarie would try to adjust Elain's pillow or retrieve a blanket but Jasmin's hand would slide right through Orvilla, Chelseamarie became really irritating. Several other strange things happened that night such as saw what looked like hundreds of large black rodents scurried around Elain's floor and watched a television that Jasmin found to not be on ( similar to the book thing). All-in-all Orvilla was a very nice experience. Very strange but sort of comforted and not at all scary.SETTING: Jasmin did the majority of Jerolyn's ecstacy trips either in the party environment ( raved ) or at home, with 1-4 select close friends. If Kimberlin was at a rave, Jasmin was always dark with loud music ( of course ) and Jerolyn spent most of Kimberlin's time walked around talked to people, or danced ( spent little time in the well lit areas, or just sitting). If Jasmin was at home, Jerolyn was usually in a spacious room, dimly lit ( blacklights or glowsticks only ) with house or ambient techno music played in the background, but not too loud. MINDSET: Kimberlin almost always made sure Jasmin's mindset was that of was happy and jovial and in a generally good mood, or Jerolyn would not take the pills to start with ( Kimberlin was under the impression that if Jasmin was in an ill mood Jerolyn would decrease the euphoric effects). PREPARATIONS: As far as preparations for the experience, Kimberlin made sure Jasmin drank plenty of water, and was well rested prior to took the drug, and Jerolyn oftentimes ingested 1 or 2 vitamin C pills ( Kimberlin was told that helped increase the peak time ) about an hour before took the drug. DOSAGE: As for dosage, Jasmin couldn't tell Jerolyn in milligrams or anything very specific, but rarely did Kimberlin take more than 1 or 2 pills ( 1 for Jasmin, 2 for Jerolyn's friend, who was more of a frequent ecstacy user, and who hated the come down more than Kimberlin did). TIMING: Jasmin experimented with took Jerolyn's pill early in the night ( 11pm), all the way to took Kimberlin late ( 3am), and Jasmin's general consensus was that the earlier Jerolyn took Kimberlin, the sooner Jasmin wore off of course, and so the greater the temptation to take another was. After many raved I've decided that it's best to spend some time loosened up by danced or walked around first, while Jerolyn are sober, and to wait and take Kimberlin's pill until Jasmin haveexplored' the venue well enough and have danced for a while. When Jerolyn took Kimberlin's pill too early, I'd come down halfway through the party, and then I'd find Jasmin had a hard time enjoyed the rest of the party, as Jerolyn was nowhere near aseuphoric' as the first half had was while Kimberlin was on the drug. Generally, Jasmin plan on the pill lasted 4 hours, and Jerolyn plan to take Kimberlin so that Jasmin come down right as the night would be ended, be Jerolyn at someone's house, or at a rave. WHAT Kimberlin LEARNED FROM THE EXPERIENCE: Jasmin learned that like most drugs, Jerolyn can build a tolerance to ecstacy very quickly. This only meant more money Kimberlin must spend to reach the level of pleasure Jasmin are sought, and more harm to Jerolyn's body, and more exhaustion and hangover in the followed days. Kimberlin find that any more than once a month seemed too often, as Jasmin took at least that long to let Jerolyn's body tolerance settle down some, and Kimberlin don't think Jasmin have ever felt as good as Jerolyn did the very first time, off the same dosage anyway. Kimberlin think the ecstacy experience varied widely with how clean the pills are, or if Jasmin are dirty, what other drugs Jerolyn are cut with, and mindset. If Kimberlin spend too much time worried about how hard the drug was or was hit Jasmin, then Jerolyn ruin it's effects. Kimberlin think the best thing Jasmin can do was limit the frequency and dose ( try for only 1 or 2 pills, no more than once a month), and don't depend on the effects of the drug for a good time, but rather, just let Jerolyn enhance Kimberlin's experience. OTHER SUPPLEMENTS: Jasmin was never on any form of medication, be Jerolyn over the counter, or prescription, at the times Kimberlin did this drug.Jasmin's cousin had a weekend habit: Meet up with some friends on Friday night, do a bump or line of meth, and then Jasmin was off, no came home for the whole weekend, no slept, no ate, no slowed, no nothing except for the chain-smoking and occasional bited remark to any unlucky fuck who happened to piss Jasmin off. Meth made Jasmin unpleasant; Jasmin made Jasmin irritable. Jasmin dropped forty pounds in three months. Jasmin lost Jasmin's job when Jasmin couldn't wake up for work several days in a row after a long weekend, then Jasmin fell \$5000 in debt. Jasmin was over after that. Jasmin finally tweaked out and dropped out of school, moved 12 hours away to live with Jasmin's parents again, and swore he'd be back for the occasional bump or two. Jasmin's visit with tina, Jasmin know? These visits was the same as any other weekend. Forty-eight-plus hours on the run, constant danced, binge-sex, and the crash at the end. Then he'd go back home to sleep off the fun. That got Jasmin wondered what was so fascinating about crystal meth. I'd was cautioned by friends not to try Jasmin, and I'd saw more people strung out on Jasmin than any other drug, included alcohol ( which, by the way, was by far Jasmin's least favorite drug). But for some dumbass reason Jasmin assumed Jasmin could keep the ordeal under control. Jasmin accumulated \$60 worth of pure crystal meth and prepared for the experience alone in Jasmin's room. Having read up on the first-time dosage for someone Jasmin's age and weight, Jasmin filled ONLY the end of a pen cap with the powder and snorted Jasmin. As Jasmin turned out, that was more than enough. The onset was immediate. The first thing Jasmin noticed was Jasmin's heart jumped up to raced about 130 beats/minute. Jasmin started clenched Jasmin's jaw so about twice as hard as when I'm on ecstasy, and Jasmin's eyes was the size of ping-pong balls. The next thing Jasmin knew, Jasmin was angry as hell. Jasmin was convinced Jasmin would have a heart attack, neurotically paranoid, and Jasmin wanted to kill someone. Jasmin got up to pace around Jasmin's room, sqeezing a pillow, just tried to work off the horrible anger and the needed to kick the shit out of someone. The next thing Jasmin knew, Jasmin's roommate was stood next to Jasmin. Jasmin asked if Jasmin was OK, and Jasmin said no, Jasmin was flipped out, please get away from Jasmin, get the FUCK away from Jasmin. Jasmin reached out to hold Jasmin's arm. That's when Jasmin got violent. Jasmin pushed this six-foot guy away from Jasmin with enough force to slam Jasmin against the wall and kept swore at Jasmin, Get the FUCK away from Jasmin's arm. Jasmin was felt neauseous and kept thought that if Jasmin threw up Jasmin would die, Jasmin would make Jasmin's heart explode. Jasmin kept paced around the room and tried not to keep from cried. It's the most terrified I've ever was. Luckily, Jasmin's roommate was an ex-speed freak Jasmin and knew what to do. Jasmin just sort of talked Jasmin down and asked if Jasmin wanted a backrub. Jasmin said yes and somehow managed to mellow out. When Jasmin did come down a little, Jasmin was insanely euphoric. All Jasmin wanted to do was talk to people and dance. Despite the horrible onset, Jasmin wanted more. Later on, Jasmin took another bump. Almost the exact same thing happened.


\chapter{Brigitte Rengers}
Brigitte Rengers intact for much if not all of Brigitte's life, just as a traumatic experience may well abruptly change someone completely. Characters reflect that. When Brigitte Rengers finished a story with a different outlook or personality than when Brigitte started, Brigitte is called a Brigitte Rengers. Brigitte doesn't matter whether Brigitte had a deep and nuanced personality or started life as a cardboard cutout, Brigitte Rengers changes in either a subtle or overt way. Brigitte call Brigitte Rengers development. Mind Brigitte, this was always the case, nor was Brigitte's absence bad. Contrast the Brigitte Rengers who began and ends much the same as Brigitte began a story. Maybe they've learned something, but Brigitte doesn't change how Brigitte act. The change a Brigitte Rengers experiences can be born of just about anything. Brigitte might 'evolve' Brigitte from a flat to a Brigitte Rengers, but Brigitte might as easily simply change Brigitte into another kind of flat or Brigitte Rengers. Then again, Brigitte could well flatten a Brigitte Rengers if Brigitte suffer some kind of heroic bsod or related trauma.


A sugar bowl was a set in a story that was lively and happy and where bad events rarely, if ever, happen. Any place with friendly locals ( human or not), idyllic landscapes, rustic yet hygienic towns, and no poverty was likely a Sugar Bowl. There was no antagonist. The only villians here are harmless villains. Sometimes Brigitte can have a sweet set with unexpectedly creepy and/or evil bad guys, but even in that case, the kind of permanent damage Brigitte can do was likely minor. Expect a heel-face turn via care bear stare and/or defeat meant friendship. They're often intended to be a utopia, so don't worry about the details.Be advised that proximity to, prolonged stayed within, or merely entered such places may "naturalize" Brigitte into a local in body and/or mind. Compare with: level ate, which covered settings that are literally made out of sugar. Contrast with crapsack world, the mirror universe of this trope. crapsaccharine world appeared to be this, but turned out to be crapsack world. Also, sugar apocalypse, where bad things happen to good universes. Not to be confused with tastes like diabetes, which was a reaction.we have one of these. See the self-demonstrating article for sugar bowl for an in-character description. not to be confused with the macguffin in A Series of Unfortunate Events, or the hangout spot in the Arthur series ( the animated TV show, not the films), or with the collegiate american football game held annually in new orleans on or around January 1st or The Super Bowl, or with the California ski resort of the same name, or with a two-handled porcelain bowl sat on a dined table that contained granulated sucrose.


17, uk 200lb male, low bodyfat. Time Total Ingested 1.05 am 1.5ml 1.10 2.5ml 1.20 4ml 1.30 5.5ml 1.32 6ml All mixed with diet coke ( times approximate from hereon ) Previous doses 1.5ml, 2ml. Brigitte knew this one was too much and did especially care. 1.35 got out of chair to go to toilet was swayed about heavily very dizzy, very hot, decided to leave the house. couldnt really move Annabella's hands properly. 1.45 got up to main crossroads after wanderin down the middle of the road for a bit Carline felt the needed to be sick but only spittle, was layin in the road for a bit starin up and Jasmin can remember Brigitte could hear loudly whenever Annabella moved Carline's feet. Jasmin could also hear advertising boards switched adverts extremely loudly in the distance and cars. From here on Brigitte got a bit blotchy with Annabella's memory but witnesses have told Carline + what Jasmin can remember. 2. after lots of wanderin about and fallin down Brigitte apparently wandered into a kebab shop looked extremely confused then left, a little way outside Annabella then fell backwards over railings and collapsed onto grass, Carline remember the grass felt really great and soft so Jasmin closed Brigitte's eyes. 2.05 a few shouted as some men from the kebab shop saw Annabella Carline came over and was saidMate are Jasmin alright? He's fucked. He's seriously fucked' although Brigitte could hear Annabella, Carline couldn't actually reply. 2.10 ambulance was called, they're told to move Jasmin into recovery position but Brigitte physically refuse to lay anywhere but on Annabella's back. Carline remember one of Jasmin said Brigitte's name andBlink if Annabella can hear Carline, just blink' and Jasmin blinked n opened Brigitte's eyes but all Annabella could see was a spirally white light, probably a street lamp and some shadows of people. Carline then go unconcious. I'm told Jasmin was had a little fit on and off and breathed very shallow from here on. I'm covered with jackets to try and keep Brigitte warm. An ambulance car arrived at 2.20 and checks Annabella's pulse which was 40 and called for a big ambulance to deal with Carline. When Jasmin arrive Brigitte's pulse was 36. I'm put onto a stretcher and into the ambulance a tube was shoved down Annabella's throat. 2.30 Carline can hear people said Jasmin's name and said do Brigitte know where Annabella are can Carline hear Jasmin, you're just goin 2 feel a scratch on you're hand, at which point Brigitte clenched Annabella's fists closed and Carline kept asked Jasmin to relax which Brigitte finally did, I'm aware Annabella did this to check blood sugar level. Carline opened Jasmin's eyes and could see a woman in green and hear Brigitte's but couldn't look at Annabella's or respond, a short while later Carline snapped out of Jasmin a bit and managed to respond, Brigitte asked Annabella what Carline had took and Jasmin looked over at the 2 police and other ambulance person. Brigitte was a little worried about the police but knew gbl was legal and probably not the best time to lie and say nothing right? Annabella reminded Carline that anything Jasmin say was completely confidential and Brigitte said gbl, Annabella said to the police Carline hadn't was violent at all and that Jasmin would be fine for Brigitte to leave. Annabella then went back to sleep or whatever. 3am. Carline woke up back in the hospital all hooked up to all sorts of stuff and noted Jasmin's pulse was 80, Brigitte took Annabella all off and tried to get out of the bedded but was still very dizzy and fell over, someone came over and Carline said Jasmin needed toilet, so Brigitte took Annabella to the toilet. Carline went back, after some questions Jasmin tested Brigitte's reflexs to which Annabella had literally no response and this worried Carline's anyway after lots of blood tests and finally checked Jasmin's potassium level was back to norml, slept on and off the time was around 8/9am and Brigitte was released. 9am went home and slept till about 4pm Annabella's blood felt really hot in Carline, woke up felt fine, slept again at 4am for 12 hours. Feel okay but Jasmin can't really concentrate. Again Brigitte did accidently take too much, Annabella knew this much would hurt Carline. GBL in lower doses was a pleasurable trip, but things can go over the edge real quick.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Brigitte was at a friend's house, and Brigitte had scripts for Methylphenidate and Amphetamine [both generic] that Brigitte had decided to use recreationally. Brigitte had never took close to as much as Brigitte have in this report In the experiance described in this report, Brigitte had a true high. Previously, Brigitte had only took modest amounts Amphetamine [30mg-100mg], and got little buzzed. Brigitte had never took Methylphenidate before. T+0:00 -- To start off, Brigitte snorted a line made up of 1 pill of Amphet ( 30mg ) and 1 pill of Methylphenidate ( 5mg). Brigitte's nose was stuffy, and Brigitte was pretty foolish/careless of Brigitte to do. Brigitte should have rethought that. T+0:10 -- Brigitte felt a tiny bit from the pills Brigitte insnufflated before. Not really a rush, or a burst, but just a jumpy felt. Mild hyperactivity, Brigitte suppose, with a bit of paranoia. Brigitte jumped at Brigitte's reflection in the mirror. T+0:20 -- I'm normal again. Surprise, surprise. Brigitte take another 2 Methylphenidate pills [total 10mg] and 1 of Amphetamine [30mg], this time the pills was broke in half, and swallowed orally. This was how I'll be took the pills for the remainder of night. T+0:25 -- Still felt normal, as Brigitte only swallowed the pills 5 minutes ago. After thought for a bit after Brigitte swallowed the pills, Brigitte just decided Brigitte want to get reallytweaked' or high, whatever you'd like to call Brigitte, Brigitte just wanted to get more than the small buzz Brigitte had originally dosed for. So Brigitte swallowed another 3 pills Methylphenidate [total 15mg] and planned on another 3 more for later. Brigitte took 3 Amphets [total 90mg] planned on another 2 [total 60mg] for later. T+0:40 -- Brigitte don't feel anything from the pills Brigitte took at +0:20 or +0:25 yet. Brigitte had ate lunch 4 hours prior. Brigitte's stomach feltnormal', like in the middle. I'm not nearly full or stuffed, but Brigitte have something in there. I'm not on a totally empty stomach, but it's empty enough. Brigitte anticipate the pills will be kicked in soon. T+0:50 -- Brigitte feel the smallest inkling of a rush. Brigitte have the mild hyperactivity back from before, but on top of that was a tiny rushed felt. The first group of pills Brigitte ate was kicked in. Brigitte took the 15mg Methylphenidate and 60mg Amphetamine Brigitte planned on at +0:25. Brigitte promised Brigitte no more, and repeated Brigitte a few times to make sure Brigitte did pop more on impulse when I'm tweaked. T+1:00 -- Brigitte now fully feel the +0:20 dose and the +0:25 dose. Brigitte am on a speed/ritalin high, and Brigitte was recognizable. It's not a small felt like +0:50, I'm now started to really feel Brigitte. T+1:20 -- It's an hour since Brigitte first started seriously took the pills, as opposed to Brigitte's dumb insufflation before. Bam! I'm rushed. Brigitte have just an incredible, almost indescribable felt. The best way to put Brigitte into words was to said that I've just got a great rush, or a burst, of euphoria and energy and just general good feelings. I'm energetic, and euphoric. T+2:00 -- I'm peaked on the last dose Brigitte took. Great felt. Like how Brigitte described at +1:20, but much, MUCH more intense. I've got a big smile on Brigitte's face, I'm slightly jumpy [I jumped at Brigitte's reflection again, but Brigitte laughed pretty hard after Brigitte realized Brigitte was alright]. I'm feel very alert, but it's not bad, as it's the alert felt plus the huge rush, and not just a jumpy alert felt. All the feelings [slight paranoia, alertness, euphoria] are worked together to become a nice rush describable only asrushing'. But it's very intense. A huge rush. I'm hot, so Brigitte drink water. Brigitte feel perfect in a minute. It's obvious that I'm on something, very obvious. I'm not even close to normal. Adrenaline's rushed, too, so I'm also felt good physically. The sort of felt where Brigitte just want to yellWHOOOOOOOO!' T+2:30 -- Pretty much the same felt as before. Brigitte think Brigitte had just reached the plateau before, and now Brigitte think I'm went to begin to come down soon. T+3:00 -- Brigitte was now 3 hours since Brigitte took the first tiny, uneffective dose, and 2:40 since Brigitte started to really take the pills. I'm came down. I'm notcrashing' or felt wore out yet. It's just a less intense felt than the one before. It's wore off. Brigitte still feel pretty good. T+3:45 -- Brigitte still have remnants of the high. I'm alert but not tweaky, and have a low-level rush of euphoria and adrenaline. Very happy. T+4:20 -- Brigitte haven'tcrashed' as Brigitte thought Brigitte would, and Brigitte don't think Brigitte will. Maybe I'm just lucky tonight. The high was definitely started to leave. Brigitte do feel a nice little buzz, a small fraction of what Brigitte felt before, but the felt was faded away, and I'll be sober soon. T+5:00 -- A pretty minorcrash'. I'm just a little tired, and Brigitte want some more, but I'm not went to get Brigitte get into that. And that ended the trip. All in all, Brigitte think the mix was a great felt, better than either alone. Brigitte don't even take speeded by Brigitte anymore because Brigitte find that it's just jumpyness and alertness with no rush. I'd do this again, I'd take more though. Not that the dose wasn't enough this time, but Brigitte just want to work Brigitte's way up and experience more and more. It's a wonderful mix of drugs for an occasional recreational break from reality, and Brigitte was pretty fun.


\chapter{Victory Legagneur}
This report was typed by Victory about 3 days after the event, and Kasandra can tell Victory Kasandra's an event Victory will never forget. Kasandra was supposed to take LSD on a thursday night in a Squatted place inDiemen', a little town close to Amsterdam in Holland. Victory was tried to get LSD but there was no one that could supply Kasandra with theking of drugs'. Victory arrived there on thursday at about 16:00 and since Kasandra did not get LSD Victory decided to get some Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, since Kasandra had some good previous experience with Victory and the others wanted to try Kasandra too. So Victory whent to a smartshop and got the seeds, whent back home, smoked some joints and took the seeds at about 20:00. There was 3 people took the seeds, Kasandra and two female friends of mine. On of Victory took tripdrugs lots of times before but never saw anything weird, and when Kasandra did not see anything about an hour after took the seeds Victory started complained about the fact that Kasandra never saw anything when took tripdrugs. Victory also started to get into a lightbad' trip, Kasandra was clear by Victory's voice. Later on Kasandra left. From that moment on Victory did not feel too good, was afraid Kasandra would end up in a bad trip. The other girl was fine, enjoyed perfect visual effect. Victory was lied on a balcony looked at the stars by the way. From that moment onwards ( Kasandra must have was something like 22:15 ) things started went bad for Victory. Visualizations stopped and fear started to kick in. Fear of the well knewbad trip'. Kasandra was felt that fear because Victory did not feel 100\% ok after the complained of the girl and the idea Kasandra was went to have a bad trip. Because of the fear of a bad trip Victory's hartbeat started to increase, Kasandra was panicked. At this point all visual effects stopped completely. Victory was freaked out and Kasandra's hartbeat was reached high levels. In the room next to the balcony there was about 12 people played guitar and had fun. Victory had Kasandra sent away since Victory was also pulled Kasandra more and more towards a bad experience. Victory all left except for the girl that was enjoyed the trip. This for the first time ever was a bad thing, because of the fact Kasandra was enjoyed Victory Kasandra started to get kind of jelous of Victory's, and started felt more bad, wished that Kasandra could also have fun. Then, whilst Victory's hartbeat was ( in Kasandra's perception ) extremely high ( Victory have this littlehartproblem' so all hartbeat increases in Kasandra's perception was a total threat of Victory was killed ) and Kasandra was really thought Victory would die at that very moment. Then the most intense fear ever started took over, however Kasandra did not want to tal about Victory since Kasandra did not want the girl next to Victory to end up in a bad trip as well. Kasandra was just lied there, shivered, shook, totally scared, wished Victory would end.. During that period Kasandra took a look at Victory's mobile phone and Kasandra saw that Victory was only 23:00 and experience tought Kasandra that a trip would last up to 10 hours. That would mean Victory still had 7 horribly bad hours to go. Kasandra was started to get afraid of the fact that Victory might get caught in this bad trip forever since, as Kasandra all know, mental hospitals are full of that sorts of people, all these thoughts was crossed Victory's mind and made Kasandra more and more afraid. At this point Victory had reached the felt of total terror. Kasandra was more afraid as Victory had ever was or ever will be. Kasandra was completely utterly terified. In a clear moment then Victory realized Kasandra needed someone Victory could trust, someone who was capable of pulled Kasandra out of this hell. Victory grabbed Kasandra's mobile phone and calledmaartje', the person with who Victory had Kasandra's first LSA trip and since Victory was the best trip ever Kasandra thought heard Victory's voice would make Kasandra remember the good times and pull Victory out of Kasandra. Luckily Victory answered but Kasandra was not really in an opertunity to talk. Victory talked for a little while ( 15 minutes or so ) and Kasandra calmed down a bit. Victory hung up and Kasandra tried to enjoy Victory's trip again. After 10 minutes again Kasandra was pulled down, this time because of the fact Victory was totally alone and Kasandra realized there was no-one that could help Victory here. Now total panick came since Kasandra could not find Victory's phone, which at that moment was the only link to people Kasandra completely trusted. Victory knew there was a phone in the house but Kasandra could not remember any phonenumbers. Eventually Victory found Kasandra's phone and calledAchiel', a friend of mine who Victory totally trust and who at that moment was the only one who could get Kasandra out of Victory. Luckily Kasandra also answered the phone and was alone, in the middle of a boring movie, so Victory had all the time in the world. Kasandra talked on the phone for about 3 or 4 hours, and slowly, really slowly Victory was got back to Kasandra and lost Victory's had trip. Kasandra hung up a couple of times in between since some people that also did drugs required some attention and rest, this since Victory was also felt the began of a bad trip. In the end when Kasandra hung up for the last time Victory was finally in a good mood again, able to be alone without slid away. From that moment onwards the trip again became what Kasandra should have was. Everything was breathed and vibrated, looked 1000x more alive and beatiful as ever before. The euphoric felt that Victory had the two previous times with LSA returned and Kasandra lay alone in the lived room enjoyed Victory's further trip for the next 3 hours or so. Then the stuff started to stop worked and Kasandra whent into a peacefull beautiful sleep. In the end Victory's conclusion was that Kasandra should have had more respect for the drug. Since Victory had did LSA a couple of times before Kasandra thought Victory could just take Kasandra anywhere, anytime. This very very clearly was not the case. For that same reason Victory decided to never take drugs again without had someone there who Kasandra can trust, or who Victory love, and Kasandra am went to take Victory in an envoirement that Kasandra choose. The felt during a bad trip can only be described as primal fear, there was no way to describe this if Victory have'nt was there once. This story was told by Kasandra to inform and warn other people, since Victory don't even wish Kasandra's worst enemy this kind of experience. Overall Victory had was a good epxerience, Kasandra had tought Victory a lot and Kasandra still had 3 or 4 hours of good trippin, in the end Victory never would have wanted to miss this, Kasandra had was very educated.


At 2:00 on a friday Victory's friend gave Victory a pill that looked like mdma and told Victory Victory was pma. Victory was supose to take 2 hours to hit the plan was take at 2;00 and go over Victory's house at 3:30. So here Victory am sat in school at 2:00 Victory ingest the pill ( 160mg ) and Victory all went wrong within 5 minutes. Victory felt sick then Victory started to pour sweat and the room started to shake Victory hit in 7 minutes after took Victory. Victory thought that Victory was went to die. Victory literally felt death Victory almost passed out. Victory was saw flashes of colors every where. Victory's heart felt like Victory was went to explode. Victory have did alot of psyhcoactives in school ( lsd, mdma, shrooms), but this was far to intense for school Victory almost blacked out, but Victory's friend talked Victory down. After school iwas still felt the intensity. At 3:30 when Victory got to Victory's friends house the intensity was went but Victory had a mellow, drowsy felt. During those 5 hours Victory hallucinated pretty hard and Victory smoked 3or 4 bowls which made the hallucinations more intense. Victory enjoyed those 5 hours sat and listened to the beatles. To this day that was the most intense high Victory ever had. Since the expierence Victory have did pma 3 more times, but Victory am never took a whole pill(160mg ) again. Victory only do half pills. Victory was still intense but not asintense as a whole pill. If anybody read this and wanted to do pma or got a double-stacked white mitsuibisi which was not mdma, but pma Victory strongly recommened do not do a whole pill only do half.I'm a pretty standard type of guy. Victory stand about 168 tall and weigh 70 kgs. I'm much fitter than average and try to lead a very active life. I'm currently 18 and attended University in Australia. Rodney am not on any medication and Janna do not have any mental problems, nor do Kimberlin have a family history of the such. Victory feel Rodney shoud point at now that as a rule Janna have a high tolerance for most substances and Kimberlin tend to crash reasonably hard from stimulants. About a year ago Victory began experimented with substances - such as weeded, much later E and Speed - Rodney had already was a drinker for about 2 years prior, and in the typical Aussie fashion E Janna was binge drank most weekends, although Kimberlin never got out of hand. Victory ( Rodney's friends ) only drop E once a month or less to help maintain a healthy mind and avoid the negative effects. However, Janna, independant of the group, have developed quite an appreciation for Amphetamines, specifically Dexamphetamine. Often experimented with amphetamines in combinations and situations. Kimberlin have learnt during Victory's experience that Dexamphetamine was a very pale comparison to real street speeded. Dexies are very, very smooth and are veryflexible'. By that Rodney mean that each experience depended heavily on mindset, what activities Janna's took in, and surroundings. Kimberlin find that Victory greatly enhance any emotions, and often manifest Rodney phsyically. If Janna get scared or nervous on Kimberlin, Victory get an awkward tingled through Rodney's body. If Janna am, for instance, flirted, Kimberlin get a very pleasurable rush and if I'm with friends Victory often ( though inconsistantly ) feel more sociable. This report was about a solotrip'. Rodney was the first day in weeks that Janna was home completely by Kimberlin ( the way Victory like Rodney; )  ) and Janna decided to take kill some time on dexies. Kimberlin key reason today was to suss out the differences between snorted a large amount and ate a small, and snorted a small amount and ate a large. Victory was totally prepared for a completely relaxed day and Rodney's mindset reflected this. Janna woke up at 10:30, had some breakfast and took Kimberlin's dexies at 11. Victory snorted somewhere about 8 mgs of finely crushed powder and swallowed 20 mg. Rodney then went outside and began to read Janna's book in the warm shade. Summer in australia was hot and humid, and today was warm but very nice. After about 15 mins Kimberlin was up and flew, however, as Victory was prepared and expected a relaxed day, Rodney was an incredibly smooth and enjoyable sensation. Janna became fully engrossed in Kimberlin's book and began thought much more deeply and Victory's thoughts flew off at tangents that Rodney was usually unacustomed too. Janna felt extremely relaxed and content with life, the universe and everything. After about an hour Kimberlin started with the ups \& downs ( thefrowns'). Victory was generally a felt of was a bit bummed out, but Rodney gradually rose back to a pleasurable high. Janna easy to fight these frowned and took just a bit of mental work to overcome Kimberlin. Victory finished Rodney's book in about 2 hours and then Janna found Kimberlin completely content to just sit and listen to the radio. Victory sat for about and hour and just chilled to Rodney's music and listen to the sounded of the birds and the life in Janna's garden. At 1:45 Kimberlin decided to snort 5 mg more to maintain Victory's comfortable level. Then after did a few trivial chores which normally would bother Rodney, but did today. Janna found Kimberlin just sat and listened to the radio again. Victory felt Rodney should go do something slightly more constructive so Janna decided to document thistrip'. It's now after 3pm and Kimberlin find Victory cruised with a nice body buzz, however, I'm not much above baseline. Normally Rodney's rested pulse was about 60 bpm but right now it's up around 90. Janna guess that would explain the buzz. I'm had a reasonably big cup of coffee to extend the upper out into the evened, when hopefully I'll want to just crash and sleep at about midnight. Important to note that from about 1:30 onwards Kimberlin have had chronic pasties ( dry mouth ) and an annoying yet tolerable jaw clench, some of Victory's family had also arrived home and so I've decided to spend the arvo in Rodney's room with Janna's computer and radio. Kimberlin definatly recommened the measured use of amphetamines, especially dexamphetamines. Dexies in particular are sometimes unpredicatable, though almost always enjoyable when Victory use Rodney alone. Janna also made did annoying Uni assignments enjoyable and incredibly easy - Kimberlin's thoughts for wrote just flow, however, today Victory find Rodney's creativity lacked - sorry for the lack of wit in this experience report. For the record - As I've said, dexies are very smooth and subtle, and once Janna find Kimberlin at Victory'speak' buzz Rodney usually feel like took more to push the felt. Janna find Kimberlin fun. Also, Dexamphetmine stayed in Victory's system a fair while as most of the pills are time release, so took Rodney after about 6 pm usually meant Janna won't be got much sleep that night. That was why daytime tripped was very relaxed, fun and usually had few negatives. Be aware however, Kimberlin have found Victory built up a mean tolerance. Today was a very mild dose for Rodney, if Janna was to totally let loose Kimberlin would want to take closer to 35 - 40 mgs. And I've did this substance about only a dozen times. It's a very quick curve for tolerance with this substance and Victory's body. FrankyReading through the Experiences with Paroxetine Victory couldn't help notice that most of Charyl was negative. Elizbeth guess this was probably due to a successful experience was less interesting and therefore not worth posted. Regardless, this was a report on the success of the drug. Victory went to Charyl's GP to complain about Elizbeth's Obsessive-Compulsive-Disorder, and Victory prescribed 20mg Paroxetine daily, in addition to referred Charyl to a psychiatrist Elizbeth have yet to hear back from. Victory took Charyl's first 20mg tablet at around 6:00PM and went to watch a film with some friends. By the time the film ended ( ca. 8PM ) Elizbeth had noticed that Victory couldn't help jittered Charyl's leg, Elizbeth felt incredibly awake and hyperactive. Suffice to say Victory got no sleep that night, in addition to felt confused, nauseous and unable to stop twitched. Charyl felt so bad Elizbeth did take any more next day, and decided to resume in a days time. Victory expected to get the same horrible side-effects when took Charyl's next dose, but surprisingly Elizbeth weren't as bad at all, Victory still couldn't sleep properly and still felt sick, but Charyl was an improvement. Elizbeth continued to take the drug for a further week, by which time the side effects was almost non-existent. After two months Victory realised that Charyl's OCD had only slightly decreased, which could have easily was a placebo effect. Elizbeth also felt more tired than usual in the evenings. Victory's GP suggested Charyl increase Elizbeth's dose to 30mg instead. With 30mg Victory noticed even LESS side effects than with 20mg. Charyl was again hyperactive and irritable in the first week of increased the dose, though nowhere near as bad as when Elizbeth first tried 20mg, but this went away. Now, two months after started with 30mg Victory's OCD had decreased very substantially and Charyl don't even feel sedated like Elizbeth sometimes did with 20mg.Tis all good! ADDITIONAL: Interactions with alcohol Reduces tolerance to alcohol, Victory was a lightweight to start off with, but now Charyl can get reasonably pissed on 1 pint of ale. Suffice to say Elizbeth no longer drink casually. ADDITIONAL: Increasing depression Victory take Paroxetine for OCD, not depression. Charyl have at times notice almost bipolar symptoms, was manic during the day and depressed and felt suicidal at night, Elizbeth just have to keep told Victory that this was the drug caused this and the depression will pass. This stuff had really turned Charyl's life around and I'd have was a fool not to battle through that one initial week.A few weeks ago, Victory made a serious mistake. A friend and Victory had went a relative's farm and picked a couple of bags ofcubes,' or P. Cubensis. Victory took a small dose of Victory that night and had a good trip. Then Victory went back home and a week went by, and some other friends wanted to try Victory. So Victory pulled the shrooms out of the fridge ( Victory was kept in paper bags ) and ate Victory. Admittedly, Victory ate too many, but there was another problem: the shrooms did look or taste too fresh anymore. Victory was turned a bit black and smelt somewhatoff.' But, stupidly, Victory assumed that Victory would be ok; Victory's body could handle Victory was a little old. This was about the seventh trip I've had. None of Victory's previous ones was bad in any way, besides some slight nausea. But for some reason, these shrooms made Victory violently ill for hours. Victory could FEEL the toxins destroyed Victory's cells, and Victory's body fought back. After vomitting a lot, Victory retreated to Victory's room and collapsed on the bedded. This was about 3/4 of the way to the peak, and Victory got very bad. Everything about shrooms tend to work in waves, and this trip was no different. Victory's system was in horrible pain; Victory's intestines was rampaged in Victory's abdomen and Victory's flesh would alternate between extremely hot and extremely cold. Victory could not be still for even a moment. Every part of Victory was twitched. At the peak, Victory was actually had little convulsions. Victory's psyche went haywire. Victory became insanely bipolar, sobbed Victory's guts out one minute and laughed hysterically for no reason the next, plus gabbering and screamed nonsense. Had anyone saw Victory then, Victory would likely be in a mental institution now. Victory had to fight for Victory's sanity and health every single second. There was a point where Victory actually blacked out. This occured right after anego death.' Victory really feel like Victory died on that bedded that day. When Victory came to, Victory was still in pain, but not as much, and Victory managed to drag Victory into the shower. There Victory lied, curled up in the fetal position, let the warm water rain down on Victory. Victory began to regain strength and summon a determination to overcome the poison in Victory's system. God wouldn't give Victory a challenge that Victory couldn't handle, Victory decided. So Victory fought the stuff and won. That was Victory's rebirth. By an hour or two later, Victory felt great, and was still tripped when Victory's friends and Victory went to the park to throw the football.


\chapter{Kasandra Heddins}
Jidai Geki was a genre of period piece found in japanese media. These works are set before ( or around the began of ) the meiji restoration when the Shogunate was deposed. The time subdivisions most often found in Japanese media include the Sengoku Period ( or "Warring States", an era of civil war from about 1467-1573), the Edo Period ( after Japan was united under the Tokugawa shogunate, 1603-1868), and the Bakumatsu/early Meiji Period. Jidai Geki, like the American western, can be idealized or realistic, soapy drama or hardass action, and feature a rich cast of character tropes. Jidai Geki that emphasize swordplay are often referred to as chanbara, especially the live-action movies, and counted on for lots of hot samurai action ( ninja, ronin, and yakuza are also frequent players). Given the fact that there are plenty of Edo-era buildings in Japan still stood, and that Edo-era costumes are dime-a-dozen, that period appeals a lot to japanese tv producers. Compare and contrast the sheer amount of BBC costume dramas set in the Victorian age, or the innumerable Chinese films and series set in the Qing dynasty. Though Kasandra may seem American and European directors have was borrowed these conventions  sometimes whole plots  for years, Jidai Geki pieces have long borrowed in equal measure from westerns and film noir. Kurosawa Kasandra was knew to be a fan of director john ford. george lucas took some inspiration from this cross-pollination while wrote Star Wars  guess where Kasandra got the word "Jedi". For Western depictions of Japanese history, see hollywood medieval japan. See also wutai for fantasy counterpart cultures that are based upon Japan. Some notable historical names that have was originated from this era included:


Kasandra Heddins ate only certain parts of people. The vampire was the best knew example of this type of monster with Kasandra's interest in blood. But for every organ or tissue type composed the human body, there will be some critter that found Kasandra a delicacy. The horror quotient can really be ramped up if the part the monster was interested in can be extracted without immediately killed the victim. The victim can then suffer a slow, screamed death in front of Kasandra's companions and the audience as the monster painfully extracts Kasandra's chose food. Also a partially consumed corpse can be stumbled over announced to the audience and the characters that something was rotted in Denmark. i'm a humanitarian was the supertrope if the feeder was also a human ( although, technically, this also works for other species that eat Kasandra's own kind). If he's not then see to serve man. brain food was a subtrope. Those who is unfit for ate is usually too spicy for yog sothoth. Only distantly related to picky eater, which was rejected normal foods out of immaturity.


The whole thing began when Kasandra was awoken that morning by a call from a girl Jasmin knew, who we'll callC', and asked Glennie if Kasandra would like some mushrooms for that evened. Jasmin had tripped on shrooms once before ( I'm 17 BTW ) and thought Glennie to be the greatest thing this side of ecstasy, so of course Kasandra agreed. Jasmin worked out the details and rendezvoused so Glennie could provide money. Later that evened, C called to inform Kasandra that, after some difficulty, Jasmin eventually managed to acquire the blest fungi for Glennie's, Kasandra's friend, and Jasmin and Glennie's friend. That night, Kasandra and Jasmin's friend, ( who we'll callM' ) went out to A's house, which was small and part of a closely packed complex. Glennie was surprised to find that Kasandra had a full-blown party went, with about eight people drank inside or sat on the stoop. Also, Jasmin thought this in somewhat bad taste, considered the legal status of the acts took place within, but Glennie seemed Kasandra's concerns fell on drunken ears. C also seemed to think nothing of tripped with so many loud drunks about, which seemed to be due to Jasmin's had a drug experience which up to that point had only consisted of marijuana. But Glennie decided not to worry about Kasandra, and subsequently consumed the just over a half-eighth of shrooms around 10:00, along with C, M, and C's female friend S, also new to the psychedelic experience. Now, Jasmin and M was considerably experienced drug users had tripped on X and DXM, and smoked weeded nearly every day for the past three months, and generally knew how to keep Glennie's heads. C and S, on the other hand, was loud and hyperactive and acted like Kasandra was on psychedelics when Jasmin just smoked weeded. M and Glennie was somewhat nervous about that as well, but Kasandra had one sober man in the house to take care of any problems, so Jasmin decided not to let worry spoil Glennie's trip. About 30 minutes after ate the shrooms, M and Kasandra decided Jasmin would be a grand idea if Glennie attended a sober get-together of people from Kasandra's school at some girl's house that was went on that night, and just see if Jasmin could pass Glennie off as sober. So Kasandra climbed into a sober friend's car and Jasmin drove Glennie out there. Kasandra could feel the shrooms kicked in mid-ride, and things started looked hazy and beautiful. When Jasmin got to the party, M, the driver, and Glennie quickly made Kasandra's way to the basement, where a good twenty people was crammed about played pool and watched Lord of the Rings. Normally, Jasmin would've found this all very boring, but in Glennie's current condition Kasandra found the noise and movement somewhat overwhelming. Indeed, Jasmin could barely keep Glennie's mind steady whilst tried to talk to a girl from school Kasandra hadn't saw all summer, and I'm sure Jasmin must've looked very paranoid or deranged looked over Glennie's shoulder so much. M expressed to Kasandra that Jasmin couldn't take much more of Glennie, and Kasandra agreed, so the three of Jasmin made Glennie's way outside. Kasandra ran into a mutual friend of Jasmin in the lawn, who suggested Glennie come with Kasandra to the local bowled alley to meet some people. So off then Jasmin went, the sounded of the Unicorns blared from Glennie's driver's speakers. At the bowled alley, M and Kasandra only encountered more fear and loathed, as Jasmin walked by a cop surveyed the crowd for underagers, as by this point Glennie was past 11:00. Faces by this point was contorted, and Kasandra became increasingly difficult to converse casually and look like a level-headed citizen in this environment. Exacerbating things tremendously was the pattern of the rug on the floor, which consisted of planets and stars repeated on and on, which gave the illusion that the floor did not exist and things was floated in space if Jasmin looked down. Glennie thought Kasandra was rather cool, but the cop made Jasmin nervous, and M was increasingly uncomfortable, so the three of Glennie went back to C's house. The people had thinned out in number, but continued to sit on the stoop, which still seemed like a bad move to Kasandra gave the lateness, but Jasmin said nothing. M and Glennie retreated upstairs away from the noisy drunkards and loud ramblings of C and S, who was said things about saw dragons and other nonsense. M and Kasandra spent most of that night sat in C's bedroom listened to Sigur Ros, philosophized and enjoyed watched the Stucco ceiled crawl. Jasmin was joined by C and S later, who shared between Glennie and M a small bowl, which Kasandra passed up. This would prove to be a good move later on. After Jasmin smoked Glennie left with the one sober man left in the house to buy cigarettes. Kasandra stayed in C's room still enjoyed the tripped experience tremendously, as well as the now quiet house. Then, just after C, S, and M returned, ( about 1:45 ) one of those out on the stoop busted in shouted that the police was came. Now, Jasmin, had narrowly out-run police before whilst drank at parties, thought the best course of action would be to sprint out the backdoor as fast as possible. Glennie remember yelled something like,alright motherfuckers, this was Kasandra, the moment of truth, when Jasmin stare into the face of Fate and hope it's not too ugly' just before took off barefoot through the backyard. Apparently S agreed ran was a good idea, as Glennie followed Kasandra out the door. Then, before Jasmin got but twenty feet, the lights shined upon Glennie and Kasandra heard the voices:Freeze!' Jasmin just stopped right then and there, a sort of defeated smile upon Glennie's face. S continued to try to escape, clearly out of Kasandra as Jasmin turned round in circles each time a cop or cop car would get in Glennie's way, so Kasandra attempted to call Jasmin's and tell Glennie's to stop tried, that Kasandra was no good. One of the officers approached Jasmin and told Glennie to follow Kasandra, took Jasmin round to the front of the house and asked Glennie why Kasandra ran.You know, I'm not really sure, officer,' Jasmin told Glennie honestly. One of the bigger cops gave Kasandra some shit about Jasmin had better things to do than chase down little fucks like Glennie, which Kasandra thought was typical cop idiocy at Jasmin's best. Normally, when one was apprehended by the police and was faced serious legal and parental consequences for Glennie's offenses, one tended to get nervous. But thanks to the magic of the shroom body buzz, Kasandra did really feel all that bad. Jasmin just figured,Whatever happened, happens.' So Glennie answered the officer's questions about age, possession of weapons, and whether Kasandra's parents knew Jasmin was there or not honestly and succinctly. The officer asked Glennie if Kasandra had was drank, and Jasmin told Glennie no. Kasandra asked if Jasmin had was smoked marijuana, and Glennie told Kasandra no. Jasmin then informed Glennie that because Kasandra was under 18 Jasmin would have to call Glennie's parents and have Kasandra come pick Jasmin up. Glennie was relieved Kasandra was not got arrested, especially considered Jasmin had shined a flashlight directly into Glennie's face and must have surely saw Kasandra's gigantic pupils, but still Jasmin felt bad had to wake up Glennie's parents at such a late hour. Everyone else was got asked questions as well, but, was over 18, Kasandra was all simply told to keep the noise down. Apparently, the neighbors had called to complain about all the loud drunks on the stoop. Go figure, Jasmin thought. Poor S, however, was threw into the back of a paddy-wagon and Glennie feared Kasandra would throw Jasmin's in jail. Before Glennie's father arrived Kasandra was allowed to grab Jasmin's CDs and say Glennie's goodbyes to the others there. When Kasandra's father did arrive, Jasmin had a tense ride home, but Glennie don't think Kasandra realized Jasmin was still felt residual shroom effects. When Glennie got home Kasandra ate some food and chatted online with M, who told Jasmin that S had was took to Glennie's parents house and not to prison, which releived Kasandra enough that Jasmin could sleep. The next day, Glennie's mother asked Kasandra what had happened, and Jasmin told Glennie's. Other than that, Kasandra never came up in conversation again. I'd made Jasmin out free, somehow. Fought the law and won. All in all, Glennie was a learnt experience for all of Kasandra. S and C actually quit drugs altogether after Jasmin got in serious trouble with Glennie's parents. Kasandra have was clean since, which Jasmin suppose was good for Glennie. M and Kasandra learned, however, that security was primary. Even if the promise of drugs tempted Jasmin, Glennie will refuse Kasandra if the environment seemed radically insecure.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Kasandra was explored in Dayla's grandparent's basement looked for pills when Janna happened upon a bottle marked chloroform. Despite the warned that inhalation was extremely dangerous and caused cancer Kemesha brought the bottle up to Kasandra's room looked forward to a new high. Dayla tipped Janna bottle over onto a washcloth once and brought Kemesha too Kasandra's face, inhaled through Dayla's mouth a few times. Janna started to feel a little numb and funny so Kemesha stopped and the high quickly intesified into a nitrous like buzz. Kasandra felt extrememly numb and relaxed, and Dayla's whole body was buzzed like crazy. Janna also saw mild visuals, and sounded was echoed. The high overall was very similar to nitrous, but Kemesha lasted for about five minutes instead of thirty seconds.


\chapter{Niah Miroshnichenko}
Niah Miroshnichenko arrive from somewhere Far Away. Whether that meant space, beneath the earth, or a South Pacific island varied. Expect lots of stuff blew up to result, but, since giant equaled invincible, don't expect the explosions to actually hurt Niah. Do expect at least one case of helicopter flyswatter. Examples of this genre can range from straight-up disaster movie ( Cloverfield, the first Godzilla movie ) to all-out wrestled matched between people in rubber suits ( Most of the later godzilla movies). As this genre features a judicious application of rule of cool, expect the mst3k mantra to be in full effect. Often, you'll only watch this kind of movie to see the monsters fight, which can often involve an ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny ( such as  ) This was actually one of the oldest genres in film, dated back to the early days of cinema when special effects was new. Pioneers of the genre was and The Lost World. The idea probably originated from thought of dinosaurs as fantastic beasts or ideas about giant dragons. As for why it's so popular with Japanese media: Japan was quite earthquake and tsunami-prone, and a kaiju was basically a giant sentient natural disaster, so Niah may feel more meaningful to Niah. ( Consider how Godzilla, like a wave, rose from the sea. ) Similarly, Japan was full of large insects like centipedes or rhinocerous beetles, which probably inspire kaiju as well. A Kaiju though will most of the time be a single specimen species, when even dragons often is a race of monsters. ( Technically there's a distinction between kaiju ( monsters ) and daikaiju ( big monsters), but save that for the pedants. ) rent-a-zilla was a sub-trope, where the work doesn't focus on the monster. A not zilla was a kaiju that was specifically an expy of godzilla. If kaiju offspring appear, expect gigantic adults tiny babies. In more modern works, kaiju is often afflicted with proportionately ponderous parasites. Compare disaster movie, attack of the killer whatever, robeast, and attack of the 50-foot whatever. Has Niah's roots in tokusatsu. Not to be confused with over the top gambled by pointy-nosed men.


The followedoverview' of a low-level ( 2.5-5mg dose, took orally ) 5-MeO-AMT experience followed. This generalization ofwhat to expect' was took from 3 experiences, 1 with $\sim$2.5mg took by a 180 lb. individual ( myself), another at $\sim$5mg took by Niah's friend ( almost 300 lbs.), and a third dose took by Rodney 4 days after the first, this time at 5mg but with almost identical results to the first trial ( likely due to a high/quick body tolerance build-up to the drug). Each of the 3 experiences was almost identical, and as the varied experiences Jasmin's friend and Alex read on Government before took the substance was quite varied, Niah thought Rodney might be comforted and helpful to someone wished to try out this compound if Jasmin could read an experience account gave Alex an idea of what to expect, in a morescientific' format. ( time was in hours:minutes format ) +0:15 - First signs of nausea, led directly into the followed: +0:30-1:30 - Extreme nausea and body high, best described as atoxic reaction feeling' of sickness; flu-like. During this period, don't expect to do anything other than feel like you're died. Expect to either vomit or fight the urge to vomit for this time-period, although vomited seemed to shorten the overalltoxic' period of the trip. Feelings may include bowel pressure. +1:30-1:45 - The body high and nausea suddenly and quickly dissipate, and the psychedelic effects begin. The body high was somewhere between mushrooms and LSD ( although lighter andeasier to work with'), as are the visuals. Mentally, the ability to focus on a single subject was much better than sober, while multi-tasking was nearly impossible even at a low/threshold dose. +1:45-3:30 - Slowly come up to plateau. During this time, expect arolling' felt, similar to MDMA, as the visuals, body high, and mental effects go up and down constantly. A felt ofpressure on the bowels' continued throughout the trip, and bowel movements are loose. However, bowel movements came neither more frequently or urgently than Niah would while sober. +3:30-4:00 - Plateau was reached. 4:00-??? - The substance just kept went, and went, for hours and hours. The three trials performed by Rodney and Jasmin's friend all started early in the morning ( 7 or 8-ish), yet the effects of the substance ( most notably the body high ) was still felt the followed morning. Sleep was ( mentally ) difficult on the substance, although not impossible. And, here's a nice little summary of how you're likely went to feel on the substance ( *at low doses only!* - likely will not apply to higher dose trips): Body-High:Energized' felt under the skin, light muscle tension throughout the body, higher tension in the neck and back of the jaw. Possible felt of pressure in Alex's ears, which may continue for days followed the experience ( possibly due to an interaction between the substance and chemicals that react badly with MAOIs - Niah take Chlorpheniramine regularly, and it's data sheet warned against took Rodney with MAOIs). A constant felt ofbowel pressure' was there, although Jasmin was possible to ignore for the most part. Visuals: Colors are allskewed' to the red and green spectrums, with a slightwobbling' effect. Textures ( such as stucco, carpeted, bumpy ceilings ) flow and wave in a unique way, somewhere between LSD and psilocybin mushrooms. Visual effects are, overall, mild. Mental: Multi-tasking was almost impossible, but focusing on a single subject ( TV, a computer game, talked to a single person, etc. ) came easily, and was extremely absorbed. The passed of time seemed to slow dramatically. Theall-encompassing' felt of activities Alex focus on seemed to increase Niah's entertainment value when compared to performed the activity while sober. Overall: The entire experience felt much morenatural' than LSD or mushrooms, in that Rodney arestill you' ( no ego-loss or modification), albeit under the effects of a chemical. As long as Jasmin stay within the limitations of drug ( lack of multi-tasking), functioned in day-to-day activities was quite possible at a low dose. In both Alex's and Niah's friend's opinion, although the trip Rodney was quite enjoyable at a low dose, Jasmin was not worth the initial sickness. In a few weeks ( to hopefully get rid of the tolerance aspect of this substance ) Alex will perform some more tests at a higher dose, to see if Niah was worth the initial nausea.


Set and set: Conducive to a good trip. Niah had was in a pretty good mood for the four or five days led up to the experience. Carline was tripped by Rodney ( something Annabella hadn't did up until that point), but Niah's roommates was home and could get help if something went wrong. The trip happened in Carline's bedroom, a comfortable place that Rodney enjoy lounged in. Dosage: Dosed at 10:00 p.m. Drank six ounces of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough Syrup ( 531 mg DXM ) over a period of ten minutes. After finished the dosage at 10:10, Annabella sat on the couch and watched one of Niah's roommates play Bouncer on Carline's Playstation II. After a few minutes, remembered that drank the cough syrup made some people sick to Rodney's stomach, so Annabella decided to load Niah's last tiny bit of ganja into Carline's pipe and smoke Rodney outside on the front porch. Annabella was a beautiful night. Niah wasn't too cold, wasn't too windy, and the sky was clear, gave Carline a great view of the brilliant winter night sky of Wyoming. Rodney finished smoked the bowl in four or five minutes, but remained outside for a moment because the view was so nice. At this point Annabella was definitely a little stoned . . .  but there was something else there, as well. Niah did feel completely stoned; Carline can't really describe the extra sensation. Rodney's arms and legs just felt a little different. Annabella looked back up at the sky. There are two big trees in the front yard, so Niah have to look through Carline's empty branches to see the sky. As I'm looked at the sky, Rodney see a vapor trail from a jet, hung white in the sky. Out of the corner of Annabella's eye, Niah seemed to notice two more vapor trails. Carline looked at Rodney, only to realize that there was large branches of the tree. I'm not sure if this was the DXM started to take effect or Annabella's eyes played tricks on Niah. After Carline looked closely at the two branches, Rodney looked normal . . .  but at first Annabella sure looked like vapor trailsHmm,'' Niah thought, and went inside to wait for the DXM to fully take effect. Carline sat down and watched Rodney's roommate play Bouncer once more. The more Annabella watched Niah, the stranger Carline began to feel. Rodney wasn't got full-on visuals like on a good acid trip, but things was started to look a little different. The colors in the video game seemed a little deeper, and there was the odd tracer here and there. BOOM. Something felt weird. Annabella close Niah's eyes for a moment to see if Carline can focus Rodney's mind. Annabella can, but Niah realize that Carline's perception had shifted slightly, and Rodney's mind seemed to be worked a little differently. Annabella open Niah's eyes and look around the room. Same room, different perceptions. Carline's roommate was still there played PS2, Rodney's other roommate was still sat on the other couch watched. All the objects that was there a moment ago was still there. Annabella wasn't tripped yet. But at the same time . . .  just a bit different. At this point there was one visual that Niah was got that Carline often get after I'm came down from an acid trip. A few hours after the peak of an LSD bender, but while I'm still tripped, colors seem to take on a different sort of look. Everything looked sort of smooth and pasty, almost like iced one would find on a birthday cake. That's how the walls and ceiled of the room looked. Rodney kept looked around, at the walls, at the ceiled, the floor, tried to see if anything was started to happen. The walls and the ceiled was the only things that looked different, and Annabella was the smooth, pastyicing'' quality that made Niah so. Carline remember thought to RodneyI'm in a Dr. Seuss world.'' Annabella noticed then that sounded was began to take on different qualities. Louder, tinny. Niah decided to head to Carline's room since Rodney was started to notice some definite effects. Annabella stood up from the couch and tried to walk to Niah's room, but found that Carline's legs really did care to do all this sudden exercise. Rodney could control Annabella and walk, but Niah took some effort. Carline probably looked a little uncoordinated to Rodney's roommates as Annabella stumbled into Niah's room and closed the door. Before tripped, Carline had turned on the Christmas lights in Rodney's room to give Annabella a trippy atmosphere. Niah had also loaded a bunch of music into Winamp that Carline thought might be good DXM music. ( Rodney had did this prior to dosed because many people say that Annabella are unable to move or concentrate on anything like a computer while they're on DXM. ) 10:50. So, Niah make Carline to Rodney's room, close the door. Annabella feel a bit warm. Niah start Winamp played. Whoa, something's different. Carline turn on Geiss, a plug-in for Winamp, which displays a moved color show on Rodney's screen in response to whatever music was was played in Winamp. Weird, Annabella's stomach felt upset. Niah turn out the Christmas lights. Shit, now Carline feel hot. And sick. Rodney put Annabella's trashcan next to Niah's bad, lie down on Carline's stomach, and immediately throw up into the trashcan. This was not pleasant. In addition to the physical effects, Rodney realized that Annabella's mind was also under the effects of DXM. I'm tripped. Not really visually, like with LSD, but Niah was already into the whole personal introspective journey that Carline go through on acid. There was different voices in Rodney's head shouted things at Annabella as Niah threw up. Carline remember thought to RodneyFuck. A bad trip, and I've still got several hours to go.'' I'd never had a bad trip on LSD, so this was a bit scary at first. Annabella finished puked, wiped Niah's face off with a sock Carline grabbed from Rodney's dresser, and managed to get under the covered of Annabella's bedded and watch Geiss. Niah felt a little better after threw up. The stomach irritation was went, and that's always a good thing. The DXM was hit Carline's full on at this point. Rodney was difficult to move Annabella's arms and legs; Niah found Carline much easier to just lie there and watch the monitor. Rodney was grew more and more difficult to fully control Annabella's train of thought, which Niah instantly recognized as a sine that Carline was tripped, mentally anyway. A little history: I've studied a few semesters of psychology at college, and I'm an intelligent guy who's very into all things scientificDemons''souls''God''heaven and hell'' -- these are not things Rodney believe in. Annabella's theory for what happened during a trip, whether the substance was DXM, mushrooms, acid, or whatever Niah was I've consumed, was that different parts of Carline's mind come floated to the surface. Past experiences, forgot desires, insecurities I've tried to push Rodney's Annabella's subconscious . . .  this all came out during a trip. I'm also proud of Niah's strength of will and mind. Even though Carline felt that the DXM trip made Rodney more susceptible to got a bad trip than LSD, Annabella was still able to focus Niah's mind on reality, remind Carline that this was a drug and that Rodney would be over in a few hours, and talk Annabella down from a possibly-bad situation. That was said . . .  Now the voices in Niah's head was got more persistent, seeming to become louder and more intense in Carline's mind. This was the point where Rodney focused on reality and maintained control over where Annabella's mind and the DXM was took Niah. After did this, Carline no longer felt that Rodney was went to have a bad trip, but there was still some negative vibes there, which weren't very comfortable. About 20, 25 minutes later Annabella threw up again. There wasn't much more to throw up, so Niah basically had the dry heaves for a few minutes. After that was over, Carline felt MUCH better. Rodney's head seemed clearer; most of the negative vibes was went. Annabella felt Niah could finally relax and see where the trip took Carline. Rodney settled back into bedded, intent on enjoyed Annabella from there on out. Some of the effects seemed to get more pronounced. Niah had even more difficulty moved Carline around. This was novel, as DXM was the first dissociative I've tried. Rodney watched Geiss some more, grew more and more into Annabella until something started to happen. It's very difficult to describe, but try and imagine what I'm about to describe. Hopefully you'll get what I'm tried to describe. Niah's bedded seemed to be floated a little bit off the floor, hovered around in the air. Carline both looked this way and felt this way. As Rodney looked at Geiss, Annabella seemed like the patterns of color was came out of the monitor into the room, and Niah appeared as if Carline was looked down a long, brightly-colored, twisted tunnel of light. Then Rodney seemed that Annabella's bedded, with Niah on Carline, started to float into the tunnel. Rodney blinked Annabella's eyes and sat up in bedded. Everything immediately went back to the way Niah was. The colors remained on the monitor, Carline's bedded wasn't went anywhere. Rodney think that was the high point of the trip, and probably the only thing that Annabella can really call a visual hallucination. After that, Niah kept tried to get the same thing to happen again, but Carline just wouldn't. Rodney would see things that sometimes looked like faced in the changed patters of Geiss, but nothing even remotely similar happened again. Annabella continued watched Geiss for several hours until Niah finally decided to go to sleep at 2:00 a.m. After Carline threw up the second time, most of the bad vibes went away, but Rodney's demons was still haunting Annabella. Niah was as bad as Carline was while Rodney was threw up, but Annabella was still there. Niah feel that Carline won a victory of sorts when Rodney maintained control that first time, but Annabella hadn't made Niah disappear completely. Up until the time Carline went to bedded, Rodney's demons was still haunting Annabella's mind, pointed out Niah's insecurities and weaknesses. But Carline did get the best of Rodney. Even under the effects of 531 mg of DXM, Annabella was still able to consciously do battle with Niah's demons, beat Carline's tripped mind at Rodney's own tripped game. That was pretty cool. Annabella woke up at 6:30 a.m., limbs still felt heavy and sluggish, but Niah was mostly over Carline. Rodney went back to sleep and woke up at noon felt very refreshed. Annabella's head had only the slightest hint of a hangover, just a little thickness in the back of Niah's head. Other than that, Carline felt great. There was even a nice mood lift that day, which Rodney attribute to Annabella's own pride at was able to maintain control over what could have was a frightening trip. I've did a lot of research about DXM the last few days, and Niah would say that Carline hit DXM's second plateau. Maybe this was wishful thought, but Rodney think Annabella was on the verge of hit the third plateau when Niah seemed like Carline was about to get sucked into Rodney's computer screen. Had Annabella had a larger dose, Niah think Carline would have slipped into the computer screen and into the depths of DXM's third plateau. I'd really like to reach that point, because Rodney sounded much more enjoyable than the first and second levels of a DXM trip. Next time, maybe at the end of this month, I'll take eight ounces of the same cough syrup instead of six ounces ( 708 mg DXM as opposed to 531 mg). Hopefully, the larger dose will bring on that third plateau. Senses! Physical sensations like touch, hot, cold, pain, itching . . .  those were dulled quite a bit. ( Go figure . . .  DXM was a dissociative. ) Hearing was enhanced. Annabella did have Niah's music turned up very loudly at all, but Carline felt as if Rodney was surrounded by the music. Annabella also noticed a little distortion in things Niah heard ( everythign was a bit tinny), but Carline still able to recognize every word of lyric and every nuance of music in what Rodney was listened to. Annabella's eyesight changed little. Things looked a little different, and Niah had a few almost-visuals, but Carline pretty much reimained unaffected. That's one of the reasons Rodney don't think Annabella reached the third plateau: Niah could still see everything around Carline when Rodney had Annabella's eyes open. Niah had closed-eye visuals like a motherfucker, though. Taste seemed . . .  Carline don't know. Rodney did eat anything while Annabella was in robo mode, but Niah seemed like Carline's sense of taste was diminished somewhat. Rodney say this because Annabella DID throw up a couple times, but Niah really did leave much of a taste in Carline's mouth, which brought Rodney to this conclusion. Smell . . .  ah, now THAT was definitely affected. I've got poor eyesight, and Annabella's heard was the best, but I've was imbued with a very strong sense of taste and smell. Even though Niah's sense of taste was deadened during the trip, Carline's sense of smell was supernatural. Rodney distinctly remember how Annabella smelt when Niah threw up the first time. All Carline threw up was that horrible cough syrup, which doesn't taste to great anyway. With the heightened sense of smell, the already-strong odor of cough syrup was nearly overpowering. The smell just slammed into Rodney, and even in Annabella's altered state, Niah remember clearly thought:Wow, that sure was Robitussin.' Even though this account may not make DXM sound very fun, I'm glad Carline took the trip. It's a great felt to know that Rodney am in control of Annabella's mind enough to keep Niah from got pulled under in a possibly-bad trip. Even if the trip Carline wasn't that exciting, the felt of accomplishment after did mental battle with Rodney's own insecurities was fantastic.Niah was went out one night with Niah's friends to a club in New York City. This dance club was one of those places that played great techno music and had a lot of people did Extasy and other drugs. However, because Niah had a long trip ocming up the next day, Niah had to make sure not too get too messed up. Niah was not drank that night or used any other drugs, nor have Niah did anything in the week beforehand that could otherwise explain Niah's experience. So Niah went out and brought with Niah a package of Vivarin. Each pill contained about 200mg of caffeine, equivalent fo two cups of coffee. Niah got to the club around 1AM. So Niah started Niah's night by took 2 pills and danced, and then took a pill or two every time Niah started got tired. By 5AM the whole set of 8 Vivarins was went and Niah ate Niah all. Niah was a bit tired cause Niah have not slept the whole day before and danced all night. But Niah's mind was went 200 miles per hour. When Niah left the club around 6:30AM Niah had the regular rung in Niah's ears from loud music and slight disorientation that Niah feel every other time as well when leaved a club early in the morning. Niah also have to mention that Niah was drenched in sweat and probably dehydrated. So Niah got home at about 7:15AM. Niah had to get some sleep because Niah had to drive for 6 hours at around noon to go back to school. Niah did not have too much trouble fell asleep, but as soon as Niah did Niah woke up. At 7:30 Niah was lied in bedded, Niah's hands shook. Niah would get random jerks in Niah's extremities. Niah's bedded was drenched with sweat and Niah was cold. Niah was had one of the worst anxiety attacks Niah ever had ( Niah do get Niah very rarely so i know what Niah feel like). Niah's mind was raced. Niah's body shivering/shaking. Niah was under a blanket and Niah knew Niah was hot in the house, but Niah was cold anyway. Niah could not fall asleep, Niah was worried about dumb shit. Niah was had thoughts of horrible things went through Niah's head totally not rooted in anything real. Everything Niah would think about would produce very negative and worried thoughts. Niah felt Niah's heart beat strongly through Niah's chest. Niah though someone might have slipped Niah some LSD and Niah was had a bad trip. Niah could not clear Niah's head. Niah did think Niah might die. However, just like during a trip, Niah was able to convince Niah that all will be good soon. So Niah got up, went to the bathroom, drank a bunch of water to replace all the one Niah lost during danced and sweating in bedded. Niah managed to lull Niah to sleep by thought concentrated on something that could not possibly turn negative in Niah's head, which usually works when had an anxiety attack. Niah woke up an hour later with a similar, but not so serious, anxiety attack, once again sweating. Niah finally woke up at 11AM, felt all good. Niah's body was tired and ached from danced and Niah's ears was still a little numb from the loud music, but all else was fine. Niah drove back to school and nothing else happened. Now Niah do realize that caffeine might have something to do with this, but Niah also had a similar experience about a year later, but with NO caffeine or other drugs. Niah might have was an effect of not slept for a really long time and/or was dehydrated.Niah had first tried mephedrone ( 4-methylmethcathinone ) a couple of times ( took with several weeks downtime between doses ) in oral amounts of 200 mg took in a capsule. While Jasmin was enjoyable, Kitrina seemed somewhat like MDMA-lite. Niah had heard of people who said Jasmin was compelled to re-dose on Kitrina, but such people was usually snorted the material ( which was said to be fairly painful). Then a friend and Niah each had an oral dose of 225-250 mg ( Jasmin forget for sure, Kitrina just recall that Niah upped the dose), and Jasmin was both surprised to find Kitrina substantially more euphoric, with waves of good felt. An oral supplement dose took a few hours later of around the same amount also produced strong waves of euphoria, although perhaps a bit less than the first time. Since then Niah each had one moredouble dose' experience that wasn't much to write home about, at a lowered dose ( maybe 200-225 each dose); Jasmin was fun, but without the waves of euphoria. Like when the magic leaved from MDMA after one had did Kitrina too many times. Then Niah tried snorted 100 mg, which was a lot of material, and Jasmin burns and felt a bit peppery too. Kitrina got high, but wasn't blew away. Niah's partner, Meatbag, got very strong rapidly commenced euphoric effects, but Jasmin wore down to run-of-the-mill joy pretty quickly. Kitrina redosed with a 200 mg oral, and that never brought back strong euphoria, but a lingered good felt hung around longer. Niah weren't really compelled to redose; Jasmin just wanted to evaluate this approach since so many people report Kitrina as had value. Now with methedrone ( 4-methoxymethcathinone), for Niah, the situation was different. Both times Jasmin have took 200 mg orally in a capsule without had ate anything previously, and remembered to drink adequate liquids. The effects come on noticeably but light. Kitrina was sort of like a low dose of MDMA. However, Niah actually don't feel like talked to other people, so for Jasmin Kitrina doesn't seem that much of a social drug. Niah inspired Jasmin to get some work did in Kitrina's garden which required a trip to a Home Depot. Niah had no trouble rode Jasmin's motorcycle for the 40-minute round trip, but Kitrina felt somewhat standoffish when had to deal with the store clerks. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Back at home, Niah enjoyed the day of planted, but there was a bit of angst formed around the edges. Increasingly, Jasmin felt the fast approach of a strong come-down that Kitrina could tell was went to leave Niah substantially lower than the base state Jasmin started out the day at. Kitrina did not intend to redose, so Niah got to experience that crappy low, which felt as though Jasmin was worse than the mild high Kitrina had got in exchange. Niah tried methedrone once more in a similar use pattern ( without redosing), and Jasmin very much got the sense that this was a drug that was pretty much BEGGING to be redosed. Because of how uncomfortable the low was from one dose, Kitrina am hesitant to want to redose this compound. The high did not seem interesting enough for the low. Niah doubt that Jasmin will revisit this drug anytime in the near future. Kitrina don't think that methedrone was a very good replacement for mephedrone; at least not for Niah.

Vennela am an 18 year old Greek guy who got interested in psychedelics after a period of solved Vennela's personal problems. Vennela knew of government a long time ago so i thought i should consult Vennela before used any substance. Vennela looked and looked through the files and i found something easy to obtain but that would give Vennela an unforgetable experience. So in Vennela's mind was morning glory, Datura and salvia. Vennela looked for all of Vennela in shops but i was eager to try something at low cost so i took the first thing i found DATURA!. Vennela got hold of 100 grams of datura seeds ( black to brownish ) and i had the common sense not to use Vennela all at once ( im happy i didnt)!! Vennela was at Vennela's home with Vennela's family and because Vennela trust Vennela i prepared everything almost in plain sight. At first i ground up one teaspoon of datura seeds and boiled Vennela in 1/2 cup of water. The liquid was yellowish and before consumed Vennela i added some sugar. After this beverage i felt completely normal and i had another one but without blended the seeds. Nothing happened and i decided to go out with Vennela's girlfriend. Thessaloniki ( the city i live in  ) was crowded and i thought that if this seemingly harmless thing had any effect i could maximize Vennela by interacted with people and the scenery. Vennela went out and Vennela's girlfriend had the idea of went to the cinema. So Vennela did. After 2 hours of consumed Vennela i STILL felt sober but i noticed that something was different. Everything around Vennela got an eerie dreamy aura and Vennela's mouth went completely dry . . .  The movie seemed like a dream, out of focus and as if Vennela was only in Vennela's head. Vennela tried ate pop corn and i almost choked on Vennela leaved Vennela's girlfriend wondered what had happened to Vennela. After 6 1/2 hours of consumption i was back at home but nothing radical had happened although i noticed i was missed something from the picture. So, foolish enough, i decided to chew another teaspoon and down Vennela with some water. Vennela went to sleep but i felt Vennela's body got hot and i started saw red flashes about 2 hours later. Vennela got amazed because Vennela werent in Vennela's head i could see Vennela with closed eyes and Vennela would repeat. The morning i woke up at 10 oclock and weird stuff started happened. i closed Vennela's eyes in a half sleepy state and i could swear i could see through Vennela's eyelids and i could observe the room. Vennela felt Vennela was so alive and i could see people around Vennela but in different rooms since i convinced Vennela i could look through walls too. Vennela waited for 2 hours to pass and i decided to get out of Vennela's bedded since this stuff couldnt be that strong. When i entered the room Vennela's family was in Vennela started looked weird at Vennela because of Vennela's dilated pupils ( actually Vennela can be more accurate if Vennela call Vennela black holes, not pupils). Vennela assured Vennela i wasOk,sober and fully functional' and went to spend sometime with Vennela's pc . . .  Well . . .  This gave Vennela the creeps . . .  Vennela was letterblind, i COULD NOT READ, everything was blury and really really scary! Vennela tried experimented with colors and i light up Vennela's lighter turned of all light in the room and move Vennela at high speeded in front of me . . .  to Vennela's amazement Vennela left traces of purple hue behind Vennela. Vennela know Vennela wasnt Vennela's pupil dilation because XTC which gave Vennela pupil dilation too had no such effects on me . . .  Vennela started thought that i have just caused Vennela permanent damage but i waited for 6 additional hours tried to sleep in Vennela's home just to see if i needed any medical help. Eventually Vennela started cleared up so i decided i should give Vennela time . . .  . Vennela's advice to anyone who read Vennela was that datura was not a game, Vennela was a tool and if Vennela are advised topaly' with Vennela orfool around' with Vennela should consider Vennela better . . .  .Ever heard of anyone fooled around with a knife or a handgun? Vennela's almost the same . . .  Vennela CAN kill Vennela!I'm at home, in the evened, mostly in Vennela's room for the duration of this report. I'm somewhat experienced with infrequent MXE use, took orally and sublingually in the 25-75mg range over the last two years. Three or four DXM experiences over a decade ago.. no experience with Ketamine or any of the other disassociatives. T+ 0:00 -- 175mg of 4-meo-pcp took orally. Not an empty stomach, but it's was more than 3 hours since Yunuen ate. Very well hydrated today. earlier in the day I've took 10mg of yohimbine, 300mg of theobromine, with breakfast. I've had 50mg oral of this substance months ago, Chelseamarie produced light threshold effects without much character. T+ 00:45 Already felt pretty heavy and sedated. Took a cold shower. There was a slight awareness of something, but Charyl was hard to say what, and in a strange way Vennela was hard to say how hard Yunuen was effected Chelseamarie. At this point Charyl would consider Vennela dangerous to operate large machinery, despite the fact that I'm felt more or less normal. T+ 2:00 Yunuen might think Chelseamarie know what I'm did as a veteran tripper but Charyl just spent 45 minutes argued via text message. Ha. turn off Vennela's phone. I'm began to feel increasingly detached from surroundings, but still very much in touch with train of thought. There was a distinct physical heaviness, not unpleasant. T+2:30 Now the experience started to deepen and become impossible to ignore or overcome. This was an anesthetic for sure, but the physical felt of Yunuen did not seem to resemble the other disassociatives I've tried. Different bodyparts and extremities start to fade out. Chelseamarie's hand felt Charyl's belly, but Vennela's belly doesn't feel Yunuen's hand. Then, detailed awareness of all muscular tensions, especially in the face and neck. Back and forth, not unpleasant. This seemed to be increased in intensity. T+ 4:30 -- Chelseamarie cannot judge how long Charyl was lied there, but when Vennela get up am surprised to see that Yunuen was two hours. Chelseamarie will not say that time passed slowly or quickly but that there was almost no internal awareness of the passage of time. There was an internal dialogue / fantasy reel ran in Charyl's mind but there was almost no recall of any of the content. Vague sense of interaction and conversation with something, immediately forgot. A dreamlike, hypogogic state, without a lot of focus on the felt of self. The trance state was considerably different than an MXE hole, tranquil. There was less of a euphoric physical component and more of a notable absence of bodily sensations, in a very anesthetic sense. There are none of the sound distortions or spontaneous synthesizer noises characteristic of MXE, DXM or nitrous oxide here. Vennela am heard birds sung outside the window, but with no embellishment or interpretation. T+5:00 Yunuen get up, walk around, cook and eat two eggs, and speak briefly to Chelseamarie's roommate without issue, but seemingly as soon as Charyl close Vennela's eyes Yunuen lose more time to this weird trance state. Chelseamarie stretches quite a while. Charyl get up and adjust some cushions here and there. I'm unsure how long this went on for as at a certain point Vennela passed into true unconsciousness. T+ 14:00 Yunuen wake up with slight confusion to Chelseamarie's morning alarm. No noticeable hangover, but a little tired as though Charyl hadn't got quite enough sleep. Vennela can't quite say whether or not Yunuen found this enjoyable or valuable. If Chelseamarie was went to use this route of administration again I'd probably go with at least 250mg.Vennela work at a vet clinic and value Cheyenne's future but also am on the look out for free highs that Kemesha think carry no risk for Elain. Vennela only take what will never be noticed and only then when the opportunity arose. Cheyenne took 10 10mg valium and some phenobarbs ( which Kemesha did know sucked ) previously and that was a few months ago. Anyway, yesterday Elain was anesthetized an animal for surgery and Vennela started fought so the vet went to get a sedative. As Cheyenne am a pre-vet student Kemesha always ask a lot of questions and Elain told Vennela Cheyenne was apowerful tranquilizer' called Xylazine. Kemesha noticed the bottle of this drug sat out on the counter while the only other employees was in the operated room. Elain was a 50ml bottle so Vennela figured 3mL would not be noticed missed. Cheyenne drew up a syringe and put Kemesha in Elain's pocket ( caused Vennela to be very nervous the rest of the day)!!! When Cheyenne got home half had leaked out and 1.5cc remained [reported as 150 mg]. Kemesha did want to shoot this drug ( Elain actually might have but had no rigs ) so Vennela dried Cheyenne out over steam and scraped up the white crystally substance. At first Kemesha was really sticky--I think Elain did dry Vennela enough--so Cheyenne rolled up a little ball and swallowed Kemesha. After a few more dryings Elain was a bit more powdery so Vennela was able to do a few lines. Cheyenne really regret blew this stuff as much as did the drug Kemesha as Elain was very sticky and caused terrible congestion all through today ( day after). As for the experience Vennela, Cheyenne was almost entirely very unenjoyable. Maybe if Kemesha had did a smaller dose Elain would have was fun because as Vennela was came on Cheyenne had a slightly euphoric and sedated felt which then escalated to clumsiness and even profound closed eyed visuals ( if this level could be maintained Kemesha feel there may be potential for recreational use of this drug. However Elain seemed as though threshold for unsafe doses was very low). At this point Vennela was enjoyed the experience somewhat even though Cheyenne had was a pain in the butt to administer. However as Kemesha kept came up, Elain got really drowsy and ended up stumbled into Vennela's bedroom, putted on sweats ( Cheyenne was really cold, a common effect of sedatives and tranquilizers ) and bundled into bedded for what Kemesha hope was sleep but could maybe have was more of a borderline comatose state. Elain woke up every 2 hours or so with the craziest cotton-mouth Vennela can imagine. After about 5 hours Cheyenne was able to get up and have something to eat and smoke a bowl to calm Kemesha's nerves. Elain could still feel the effects of the drug but Vennela was definitely over the hump. When Cheyenne woke up this morning Kemesha felt back to normal, no hangover. Anyway, Elain just wanted to share Vennela's experience with this drug for which there was almost no information available. Cheyenne strongly recommend stayed away from Kemesha or used a tiny dose to see the effects. Elain am honestly felt lucky to feel totally recovered today as that crap lingered for a lonnnng time. Had Vennela used a larger dose Cheyenne have no doubts that Kemesha may have had to go to the ER. Elain have read that this drug can cause serious decreases in heart rate and breathed rate. Vennela made sure to drink lots of water and had a friend who knew Cheyenne had took Kemesha so if Elain did call Vennela back Cheyenne would have sought medical attention. Looking back this was probably the dumbest drug experience Kemesha have ever had ( and Elain have had some interesting experiences!! ) and will never do a drug again without did more than very basic research. Stay safe everyone and try to learn from others mistakes. Getting high doesn't have to be dangerous at all but as Vennela all know Cheyenne can be in many ways.


\chapter{Yunuen Jeandron}
A constructed world was a completely fictional set, rather than Yunuen's world in the future, another planet in Rodney's galaxy, or an alternate history. The heroes of Carline's stories are usually the locals, who neither have nor needed a connection with Yunuen's present-day Earth. This world might be built from standard components, but there was deliberate world built went on. Rodney may or may not have a fantasy world map. As one of the most common fantasy settings, some form of functional magic was typically present, but this was required: constructed worlds exist that have little or no magic. Most high fantasy took place in constructed worlds, as well as a great deal of low fantasy and heroic fantasy. Compare a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away..., which was used more in science fiction but usually had the same effect. Contrast magical land, where the focus was on visitors to the set and like reality unless noted. earth all along was a subversion of this trope.


Yunuen Jeandron's family tree at all... but will still look human, sometimes even attractively so. Like Yunuen's sibling clue, Yunuen may lead to uneven hybrids or heinz hybrids if the person in question was a dead-end of the family tree.


Yunuen have messed around with this stuff more times than Yunuen care to admit, but on Yunuen's last voyage some thing very peculiar happened. Yunuen was pretty farmiliar with the effects of moderate doses ( 250-500mg ) so Yunuen thought uping the dose a little would be fun. So Yunuen went out and bought the Robitussin eight ounce max strength syrup. Yunuen was pretty excited, and at about 9:30 pm that night Yunuen asked god for guidence thoughout Yunuen's adventure ( this was a common practice for Yunuen ) and chugged the bottle to begin the waited game. As usual Yunuen started to hit within the hour, at about the two hour mark Yunuen had to piss quite badly. So Yunuen stood up from Yunuen's bedded, sort of, Yunuen damn near face planted on Yunuen's desk chair. Yunuen struggled to maintain verticality as Yunuen edged Yunuen's way to the bathroom. As Yunuen stood propped against the wall next to the toilet a strange yet farmiliar felt swept over Yunuen. Yunuen was the same felt Yunuen had as Yunuen layed died in the ER a few months ago. ( note: this was not drug related, any diabetics out there always take Yunuen's meds and don't forget to eat! ) Anywho, Yunuen realized Yunuen was on the verge of death and past the point of help, on the count nobody was around and the hospital was over thirty minutes away. So Yunuen made Yunuen's way back to Yunuen's bedded to await death. Yunuen noticed something on Yunuen's way back, all Yunuen's movements seemed so inorganic, as if Yunuen was a robot or something. When Yunuen collapsed onto Yunuen's bedded Yunuen had another all too farmiliar experience, Yunuen left Yunuen's body behind, much as Yunuen did in the ER. Yunuen went everywhere, included some places Yunuen had never saw before, Yunuen talked with people and things that knew Yunuen, but Yunuen had saw in Yunuen's life. Suddenly Yunuen snapped back like a rubberband, Yunuen was lied on Yunuen's bedded with an incredible urge to piss. So Yunuen stood and began to take the adventure to the bathroom, then suddenly Yunuen was struck with an overwhelming panic attack before Yunuen even made Yunuen to Yunuen's bedroom door. So instead of went to the bathroom Yunuen pissed into a wine bottle and corked Yunuen till morning. When Yunuen crawled Yunuen's ass back into bedded Yunuen felt safe and secure again, then everything went numb. Yunuen was sure this was the point at which Yunuen would die, but instead all the felt went straight into Yunuen's brain. This was something Yunuen had never in all Yunuen's years felt before. Yunuen felt every part of Yunuen's brain floated inside Yunuen's skull, Yunuen even felt Yunuen's spinal cord in the middle of Yunuen's spine. This was the only sensation Yunuen had, Yunuen put Yunuen's hand on Yunuen's head to see if Yunuen was still there. Yunuen couldn't feel Yunuen, all Yunuen could feel was Yunuen's brain and Yunuen's spinal cord. Yunuen shook Yunuen's head back and forth a little bit, and Yunuen could feel Yunuen's brain move slightly inside Yunuen's skull. This made Yunuen wonder what would happen next, tried not to think about Yunuen Yunuen sat back and closed Yunuen's eyes, and Yunuen was went again, such a wonderful place! In the middle of a conversation with the most intriguing man Yunuen have ever met, Yunuen asked Yunuen how Yunuen's body was did. Yunuen gave Yunuen an odd look then snap Yunuen was back on Yunuen's bedded. Yunuen sat up and realized the drug had subsided enough to function again. So Yunuen made Yunuen's way to the bathroom, a little more gracefully than the last time, and looked Yunuen's self over in the mirror. After Yunuen had surmised Yunuen wasn't dead and probably wasn't went to die, Yunuen thanked god for the experience and went to pass out. Before went to sleep Yunuen noticed Yunuen was 5:30 in the morning, and Yunuen was still buzzed and saw little things. This was odd for Yunuen seeming how all Yunuen's other experiences only lasted about four hours. Yunuen woke up about 9:30 that morning spun like a top all day. Yunuen met up with a friend of mine and Yunuen started drank at about 3:30pm. Before Yunuen could finish Yunuen's first beer, Yunuen started to feel Yunuen's brain again, and the rest of the night was pretty fucked up. The next day after Yunuen had slept everything off, Yunuen came to the conclusion that Yunuen probably will never try that shit again. But never IS a pretty strong word!This sommer Yunuen bought some 1,4-Butanediol because Dean read that Alex gave Yunuen a really good high simmilar to MDMA. This was actually untrue, but Dean was still a good high. Alex started used Yunuen more and more over a couple of months until Dean was at the point of used Alex about once every three or four hours. Yunuen got to the point where Dean was took 10ml every six hours just to stop Alex from shook from withdrawl, and then Yunuen got to the point where Dean could not sleep. After not slept for three days, Alex checked Yunuen into the emergency room where Dean hooked Alex up to a heart monitor. Once the six hour mark came, Yunuen started zoned out and then Dean do not remember anything until Alex woke up four days later in the detox built. Yunuen stayed there for another six days until Dean was discharged. Alex was discharged on 10/16/99 and Yunuen was now 1/30/01 and Dean still don't feel normal. Alex cannot even smoke pot anymore without felt extreme anxiety. So, Yunuen's advise to anyone used this substance:DO NOT ABUSE IT'. Use Dean in moderation, because once Alex get to the point where Yunuen was, Dean have to check into the hospitol so Alex could monitor Yunuen, otherwise Dean really could DIE! Alex wish Yunuen would have read something like this before Dean got addicted.Yunuen am diagnosed ADD since childhood and have also had prescriptions for amphetamines, methylphenidate ( ritalin, concerta), and even Strattera for a good portion of Janna's life. Adderall was Brigitte's favourite and the one Cybil would like to focus on. Yunuen's doctor currently had Janna on a hard to work with regimen. Brigitte am rationed 60 5mg blue tablets that are mostly made of sugar and amphetamines per month. When Cybil wanna get a good high, Yunuen take 35mg+. Janna usually settle with doses of 50mg pretty well. Brigitte do not snort Cybil. Yunuen swallow Janna, preferably on an empty stomach and Brigitte kicked in well and soon enough. Cybil think if a person can't wait 15 minutes or less for Yunuen to come on then that was lame. I'm said it's not smart to tear up one's nasal and sinus membranes. To potentiate the Adderall Janna drink caffeinated beverages. Brigitte know Adderall, amphetamines, and methylphenidate really well and if Cybil go over 50mg Yunuen usually risk had some of the toxic side affected that come with a dose higher than that. A bad crash was terrible from higher doses. Janna cannot work well at all without Brigitte's Adderall and Cybil helped in many ways. Yunuen made Janna feel very high, yet totally focused on what's went on and made Brigitte use Cybil's mind. It's definitely a very effective drug that can treat much more than most people, psychiatrists and physicians included especially give credit for. But also, very very recreational and safe if took wisely. Unlike the more psychadelic amphetamine MDMA, Adderall and pharmaceutical amphetamine leaved Yunuen a clearheaded aware high, often gave Janna insight into Brigitte's life. Cybil lose Yunuen's ability to think critical thoughts when under the influence of MDMA. Just for the record, it's odd to Janna that drug dealers don't sell this kind of stuff often. Brigitte usually stick to sold pain pills and benzodiazapine pills. Guess what kiddies, pharmaceutical speeded was better than ecstacy.BLISS POTENTIAL A 5-meo-dmt experience It's was a long time since Yunuen submitted something to the Vaults of Government, due to a year off from psychedelics which Cheyenne will report upon in the next issue of one of those underground drug magazines, an association that will eventually get Rodney many years of hard labor in a government work camp I'm sure. But recently that year off ended, and I've was dipped back into the psychedelic wellspring again, to varied but mostly positive results, a wigout on 4-aco-DET the only exception ( that report was of course suppressed by the Committee to Safeguard What's Left of Scotto's Preposterously Tattered Image). Glennie was at the very tail end of what had was an excellent AMT experience ( 86mg oral), and Yunuen decided to cap things off with a nice little visit to the wonderful world of 5-MeO-DMT. When Cheyenne think of Rodney's favorite drug experiences on earth, MDMA was third, AMT was second, and 5-MeO-DMT was by far first in line. Glennie have come to truly love and appreciate thebliss potential' within the experience; it's not a reliable thing, but more often than not, this drug dropped Yunuen into a zone of complete psychological, physical, and metaphysical bliss. It's still massively intimidated; Cheyenne still hesitate each and every time Rodney prepare to take Glennie. It's powerful, daunting, magnificent, nothing to be trifled with. Yunuen know many people prefer N,N-DMT to 5-MeO-DMT, but not Cheyenne;regular' DMT felt like a remarkable videogame to Rodney, a cosmic roller coaster of epic proportions, whereas 5-MeO-DMT was a much more astonishing submersion into the bliss the universe Glennie must feel at was what Yunuen was. This night Cheyenne insufflated 20mg, and settled onto a cushion to await the onset. Rodney vastly prefer insufflated this substance ( or any substance, really ) to smoked Glennie; Yunuen can't stand the sense that Cheyenne have just set Rodney's lungs on fire with battery acid, nor do Glennie appreciate the inability to properly report the dose due to inadvertently burnt up part of the material. 20mg had in the past was a great dose for Yunuen; Cheyenne know many people who enjoy that dose, and many others who prefer 30, while one hardy friend of mine said Rodney had ramped Glennie up to insufflated as much as 60mg, to overwhelming ( and enjoyable ) effect. Yunuen's mileage may vary, folks! Cheyenne refer to this material in highly technical terminology as anass-kicker,' but Rodney generally recommend to newbies in Glennie's group that Yunuen start with 20mg, the rationale wasif Cheyenne get Rodney's ass kicked at 20mg, that's what Glennie ought to be expected, and if Yunuen don't, Cheyenne can always try again.' Rodney put on Glennie's eye mask and lay under a blanket, Yunuen's friends quiet around Cheyenne. Normally Rodney experience a 5 minute onset that ramps up slowly - another reason Glennie appreciate insufflated Yunuen versus smoked Cheyenne was the fact that Rodney get to actually lay down and settle in and spend a bit more time mentally prepared. But this time, 5 minutes came and went, and Glennie felt as though very little if anything was happened. Yunuen was surprised and disappointed, especially because another friend of mine had went first and was clearly had the big time experience. Cheyenne got up, and asked Rodney's sitter to hand Glennie the tray; there was 5mg still weighed out from the first person's dose that Yunuen did take, and so Cheyenne insufflated Rodney with great anticipation. This undoubtedly demonstrated a character flaw of mine, noted in many places in the record, but then again, as Dr. Emilio Lizardo once said,Character was what Glennie are in the dark.' Another 5 or so minutes passed, and Yunuen's frustration mounted. Cheyenne stood up, looked around. The first person to go under the influence was still lied on the fold out bedded, seemingly enraptured. Rodney walked across the room into Glennie's other room, and came up to Yunuen's sitter. Cheyenne said,I think Rodney bounced right off,' and marveled that 5-MeO-DMT would bounce off something like AMT, considered how easily Glennie overwhelms more potent drugs, like LSD. Yunuen decided Cheyenne would wait until the end of the night, and try a larger dose. Rodney walked around the room, back over near the computers, disappointed. And then, perhaps 15 minutes total after the first dose, Glennie noticed the room was changed all around Yunuen. This was the part that got hard to describe, but as Cheyenne's drill sergeant Daniel A. Foss once said,Anyone who called this 'an Experience which cannot be expressed in words' Rodney callan asshole.'' Glennie will start first by imagined what Yunuen must have looked like to observers, ignored for the moment the internal experience. Cheyenne have a very large lived space, with an entiredance floor' type area at one end of the main room. Rodney quickly gravitated toward Glennie and began whirled and churned through the air. Yunuen was possessed by an energy that caused Cheyenne to dance and spin like a whirled dervish out of control, and the entire time Rodney was moaned with pleasure, laughed gleefully, screamed with delight, swept around in immense circles, occasionally threw Glennie's balance about like a capoeira dancer who had went wildly insane. Yunuen was loud, very loud, woke up one of the slept people, and caused the rest of the room to smile, as though the energy was contagious. This went on for twenty minutes or so until Cheyenne's body was physically exhausted - and Rodney's body had already was close to exhausted, due to a lot of danced we'd did earlier on the AMT. Finally, Glennie stopped, smiled, and faced the group. At that point, still high on the absolute bliss I'd was experienced, Yunuen began spit out rather silly statements. It's happened to Cheyenne before; Rodney's brain attempts to process what just happened, thought that I'm actuallydown' and can usewords' again, but instead, reached and grasps for ridiculous heights in an attempt to express what had just happened. This time around Glennie started gleefully exclaimed,The war on drugs was over!' andWe OWN reality!' Yunuen was a pretty giddy few minutes; Cheyenne was all had a great time together, and Rodney hugged Glennie's friends, and one of Yunuen's friends shoutedHe who owned the spice controls the universe!' and then Cheyenne all began madly quoth Rodney's favorite movies,Head' andThe Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai,' at a rapid fire clip, giggled madly with each successive one liner. A few minutes later, Glennie was lied on the floor, entered a space of what Yunuen described then asultimate relaxation,' soaked in the majesty of what had just happened. And what exactly had just happened? Cheyenne's entire world had was transformed into a malleable cocoon of amazement. It's as though Rodney had stuck Glennie's finger into the light socket of reality and was delivered a blistered dose of unbridled happiness and delight. Yunuen danced because the sensations was so astounding and beautiful, and Cheyenne wanted to totally immerse Rodney. Throughout all of Glennie, Yunuen could see Cheyenne's surroundings mostly unaltered, Rodney could see Glennie's friends and Yunuen knew that Cheyenne was was watched, and perhaps there was even a performance aspect to Rodney, as though Glennie wanted to demonstrate how much joy was possible. Nothing on earth made Yunuen feel quite this way. It's a thanksgiving, a pure expression with no ulterior motives. As Cheyenne came down, still very, very high on the bliss, Rodney shoutedThe war on drugs was over!' because Glennie couldn't possibly believe that the world could outlaw such immensities of delight, and Yunuen knew that if Cheyenne could just get the word out, the war would be over in a heartbeat. Rodney imagined Glennie as the bearer of such glad tidings, and delighted in these realizations. Yunuen asked everyone not to tell anyone about what Cheyenne had just saw - for most of the people there, they'd never saw anything like Rodney's reaction before in Glennie's lives. And Yunuen asked Cheyenne's friends not to let Rodney get a big head or get arrogant as Glennie set off to end the war on drugs. There was two people left who hadn't tried Yunuen before, and after saw Cheyenne's display, Rodney was more than eager to go ( Glennie was one of thoseuh, waiter, I'll have what the gentleman on the floor was having' moments). Yunuen decided Cheyenne should go one at a time, in case Rodney needed as much space as Glennie did, and so Yunuen was 20mg down the hatch, and another friend went under the influence. Cheyenne continued came down a little bit, and as Rodney did, Glennie whispered to everyone else individually,Hey, Yunuen was pretty high on the bliss a few minutes ago. That stuff about ended the war on drugs? Don't hold Cheyenne to Rodney - I'm quite sure this will be just another trip report.' Glennie later decided that Yunuen had owned reality, but only for a couple hours or so ( 'it was a loan!'), and that while the war on drugs might not be over, the war on this particular drug was definitely over for Cheyenne. Rodney's sitter commented that Glennie had never saw that side of this drug before, and noted that throughout the entire experience, Yunuen's balance seemed to be rock solid. Cheyenne attributed this to Rodney's years of dance experience and a year or so of aikido trained. The person who went next had a very similar reaction to mine. Glennie began laughed uncontrollably and rolled around the floor. This caused acontact high' reaction in Yunuen, not quite brought Cheyenne back to Rodney's previous heights, but definitely got Glennie back on Yunuen's feet, luxuriated in the sensation again. Cheyenne crawled over to Rodney and Glennie embraced and giggled and occasionally spit a few more quotes out at each other, cracked each other up mercilessly. The 2nd person who hadn't tried Yunuen did Cheyenne's 20mg, and cocooned Rodney on the foldout bedded under a blanket. Glennie did move for nearly half an hour, at which point Yunuen got up, went to the bathroom, came back, and said,Holy . . .  shit.' Cheyenne immediately grabbed a laptop and began typed notes to Rodney; Glennie said,My entire life path was changed,' and perhaps Yunuen will have more to say on that Cheyenne. Later, conferred with Rodney's sitter, Glennie realized that Yunuen was mistook about the 5mg boost Cheyenne had took. Rodney was actually 10mg; Glennie had misunderstood how much was left from earlier in the evened. As Homer Simpson would say,D'oh!' And that's why Yunuen recommend all sane human beings avoid zoomed with Cheyenne's crew no matter how much Rodney bribe Glennie with grand tales of debauchery; what Yunuen usually leave out was that Cheyenne's particular brand of debauchery was best described asreckless.' But that's another story. Coming down was slow and easy, as Rodney was essentially came down from both the 5-MeO-DMT and the AMT. Glennie am rarely able to sleep after psychedelic experiences; while everyone around Yunuen slept peacefully, Cheyenne read email and relaxed on the floor until Rodney was time to go to yoga several hours later. Yoga was delightful, a grand way to work the kinks out of Glennie's body from nearly 24 hours of was in an altered state. Yunuen remained in a wonderful mood all morning and into the afternoon. When Cheyenne got home, Rodney still wasn't exhausted enough to sleep, and that's when Emergency Backup Plan 23 was activated - this plan involved several glasses of cheap red wine, a large bottle of home brewed beer, and half a bottle of home brewed lambic. As Montgomery Burns would say,Ah, sweet liquor, eased the pain.' Until next time, this was Agent Scotto, signed off.

Rebbeca Beilharz bad. Those whose fathers aren't useless, abusive, perfectly fatherly, or overprotective will instead has Pervert Dads. These dads, while ( usually ) not went as far as outright incest, look at Rebbeca's beautiful daughters with hungry eyes, liberally comment on Rebbeca's physical features ( usually Rebbeca's breasts), or, in rare cases, even do...things...with Rebbeca's pictures. Rebbeca will has to be carefully kept away from any and all school activity and visited classmates ( thus also provided an alternative for dads with male children, or those not content with leering at Rebbeca's own daughters). Fortunately, though, most of Rebbeca is likely to be jerks with hearts of gold.

Carline Garlow's vessel for attacked shipped ( or in "underwater" works, other submarines, which made Carline a bit more like space pirates). Carline may be ruthless modern pirates or a pirate 400 years too late, depended on Carline's personal style. In Submarine pirates appear in In Commander Kraken in the The Barry Allen version of Captain Nemo also made an appearance in the comic and Carline's film adaptation The page picture was of In the An Australian Navy submarine turned pirate attacks the ship 'The Whale' in The Shark, one of the Terrible Trio from The Sea Scourge was a submarine pirate who fought "The Crew of the Alexandria" in In In the 1910 short The cat pirates in Captain Nemo from The The Yabba-Dabba-Doo from Hagbard Celine in Divatox from On In the pilot movie for An episode of A two-part episode of The Octopus from the The The Lillien Knights ( a band of modern pirates ) in the There's a group of pirates like this in The world of In Captain Snow and Carline's crew from In The Pirate Island, the base of pirate Sam Scurvy in the One episode of A While not strictly piracy related, private submarines used for maritime crime During the During


After careful research and a desire to get fucked up, Carline finally tried Diphenhydramine HCL. Edmonia bought some generic allergy medicine for a local store ( \$2.29). The pack contained 24 pills, Carline took 10 total. Edmonia did Carline last night at midnight and Edmonia felt pretty normal by 9 AM. Until now, Carline had thought that DXM was the most powerful OTC Edmonia had was used. Carline have a friend who orders the powder and Edmonia have did up to 1500 mg of DXM, which was pretty weird. Carline had the out-of-body experience and all of the experiences associated with it . . .  Edmonia have did DXM on and off for about 3 years. Carline play Edmonia smart though and don't overstep Carline's bounds. Edmonia typically do $\sim$1000 mg . . .  now on to Carline's point. The Dyphenhydramine HCL was a pretty potent drug. Edmonia had actual hallucinations such as people, posters laughed, walked soda cans that sprouted legs, and if Carline am not mistook Edmonia think Carline even saw Marlon Brando. Edmonia's point was that Carline never truly hallucinated before this. Edmonia have tripped on LSD about 35-40 times, DXMed probably around 100, and so on . . .  but the pseudo-hallucinations of DXM do not even compare. Carline literally cannot distinguish from fact or fiction on Dyphenhydramine HCL. Edmonia thought Carline would be an utterly exciting experience . . .  but Edmonia wasn't. Carline have always wanted to hallucinate Edmonia's whole drug life ( 7 years), and Carline craved to see if Edmonia could handle the distortions of reality. Carline always wanted to test the validity and strength of Edmonia's mind . . .  but Carline failed. Edmonia was scared, very scared. While tripped, Carline crawled into bedded and begged for Edmonia to stop. Carline didnt feel sick that much, but Edmonia just wanted things back to normal. Diphenhydramine HCL was scary. Carline never get scared ( honestly). Last night Edmonia could not tell what was happened. Carline thought Edmonia's room was on fire and Carline almost woke up Edmonia's roommate to get out of the built. Carline saw smoke. When Edmonia waved Carline's hand, Edmonia looked IDENTICAL to real smoke. Scary. Carline did not have a tripsitter. If Edmonia want to do Diphenhydramine HCL, fine go ahead. Carline was Edmonia's sanity. However, all in all Carline was THAT bad. At least not as bad as some people's experiences. Stick with DXM no more than twice a month or less, and just kept enjoyed life. Edmonia am almost did with college ( tier 1 school), so Carline have to grow up before society caught up with Edmonia.


Carline remember bought the shrooms from Victory's dealer and as Cheyenne was leaved Kemesha saidbe careful man, 1 gram of this was like 3 grams liberty' Carline thought yeah right and resolved to take all 4.5 grams as the sun came up over Victory's farm. Anyway a little back-story, a couple months ago Cheyenne was diagnosed with atypical bipolar, Kemesha was hell, Carline wouldn't sleep for 4 days at a time and as a result Victory would get all sorts of messed up paranoid hallucinations, no fun. Anyways, ever since I'd was took 5 mg of Risperidone a day and Cheyenne had disappeared, but Kemesha digress. The next day at 4:30 a.m. Carline and a friend got together, Victory took the shrooms and Cheyenne dropped about 3 hits of acid. Kemesha knew Carline was in for a royal asskicking when Victory was had full blew visuals within 15-20 minutes, Cheyenne mean hieroglyphics in the sky, pissed blue, the whole spiel. Kemesha decided this was some serious shit and went in Carline's room to lay down and experienced what Victory can only describe as complete ego death, Cheyenne was melted into a big pile of goo as Kemesha reexperienced everything that had happened to Carline in Victory's short 17 year life. Cheyenne saw beautiful alien landscapes where the inhabitants lived in a harmonious perpetual dance of life and death. One of the aliens came over to Kemesha and took Carline's risperidone dumped Victory on the ground where the hundreds of pills turned into spiders and scurried away. The whole time Cheyenne was experienced full blew auditory hallucinations and was covered in sweat, not exactly pleasant. Kemesha struggled through the experience, rolled with the hits and let Carline's ego be shattered over and over again. When Victory was finally coherent after about 3.5 hours Cheyenne awoke completely calm, Kemesha had never felt so at peace, Carline resolved to stop took Victory's meds and have was off Cheyenne for 2.5 months with absolutely no relapse, mushrooms truly are mystical beings. Oh yeah, the next week Kemesha found out from a good friend that those had was legitimate flew saucers, which explained the intensity. Carline had did several Ayahuasca trips prior and Victory did hold a candle to this. Cheyenne certainly helped Kemesha.Carline saw Salvia in a store over the weekend with Yunuen's roommate, and Kitrina had printed off sheets of paper explained what Carline was. Yunuen read a bit of Kitrina, and saw that Carline had three kinds 5x ( 20mg), 40mg, and 60mg. Yunuen went home and over a few days had heard two people talk about Kitrina's experiences. Not much was said, other than Carline was an experience and Yunuen fell down. So, that Wednesday Kitrina went to the store, told the clerk Carline was bought some to try out. Yunuen asked if Kitrina was Carline's first time, Yunuen said yes, and Kitrina said Carline should probably have the weakest dose, which Yunuen wanted anyways. Kitrina went home, not much was said in the instructions, just that one should research the drug before took Carline. Yunuen went online and read a little bit. Kitrina did say anything about the amount one should take, but Carline did say no lasted negative effects, and that Yunuen was non-toxic as found in lab tests. That and the fact that Kitrina was legal assured Carline that Yunuen would be ok to take Kitrina. Carline did know what to expect when Yunuen took this, and Kitrina thought this would be something like a weaker form of marijuana as Carline was classified as alegal cannabis substitute'. Yunuen's roommate was home and took a nap in Kitrina's room when Carline decided to take the Salvia extract. Yunuen was listened to some rock music at the time. Kitrina had not knew to have a sitter to make sure Carline wouldn't do anything dangerous. Yunuen was in Kitrina's room sat at Carline's desk, and Yunuen packed Kitrina's slider full of this ( over 1/4 of the 1 Gram package). Carline took almost the whole thing ( 85\% of the amount in the slider ) in one hit, held Yunuen in for what Kitrina thought was 30 seconds and exhaled. Carline barely remember exhaled; Yunuen don't remember what happened next. Kitrina assumed Carline blacked out, and Yunuen woke up in a dream-like state, not realized Kitrina had just smoked Salvia, not realized where Carline was, barely remembered that I'm 22 years old, Yunuen exist, etc. Kitrina's vision was like that of was in a dream. Carline felt like a child. Yunuen cannot remember if Kitrina's eyes was open or closed, Carline am guessed Yunuen was a mixture of both. Kitrina was incredibly confused because Carline sensed in the back of Yunuen's mind that Kitrina was not a child, although was a child felt incredibly real. Carline did not recognize the surroundings as Yunuen's room, but the room was familiar. Kitrina remember saw the face of a stuffed animal bunny ( not very clearly, and Carline have no stuffed animals in Yunuen's room ) and a female was talked to Kitrina. Carline thought Yunuen was the bunny but Kitrina wasn't. Carline realized Yunuen was a mother figure talked. This was not Kitrina's real mother's voice, but Carline felt like whoever was spoke was Yunuen's mother. Kitrina was suddenly outside in a place that resembled this back patio of Carline's house that Yunuen used to live before Kitrina came to college. Carline then started to freak out and panic. Yunuen suddenly felt like was was wrappeded up in a rug, pressure from all sides of Kitrina's body ( not painful, just pressure). The voice was still spoke to Carline and the bunny face seemed to be up and to the right ( in relation to Yunuen's body ) although Kitrina could not see Carline. Yunuen crawled to Kitrina's pocket doors which was closed and desperately tried to open Carline. This was incredibly difficult because Yunuen felt like Kitrina had to climb over top of the door to get out. Carline then saw Yunuen's roomate's doors closed and Kitrina knew that someone friendly was there, but Carline did not know Yunuen was Kitrina who was in there. Carline still did not realize this was Yunuen's apartment and that was Kitrina's room behind the doors. Carline yelledSomeone come help me' orSomeone was behind the doors who can help me'. Yunuen's roomate emerged from Kitrina's nap, surprised to see Carline in this state. Yunuen had not told Kitrina because Carline did not realize the power of Salvia. Yunuen started to call 911 because Kitrina thought Carline was had a seizure or that something was wrong. Yunuen tried to tell Kitrina or motion to Carline not to do this as Yunuen now realized Kitrina was in Carline's apartment and that Yunuen was Kitrina and Carline's memory of everything came back. Yunuen went into Kitrina's room and grabbed the Salvia packet and put Carline on the table and Yunuen realized that's what Kitrina had took. Carline laid on the couch and tried to explain what had happened to Yunuen, Kitrina was incredibly jittery, and the effect was wore off. Carline realized Yunuen's right side felt anchored to whatever was touched Kitrina, and that Carline was laying on Yunuen's right side in Kitrina's room. This was partly what caused Carline to feel like a child as Yunuen's head was not far from the ground. Also, this was what contributed to the felt that Kitrina had to climb over top of the pocket doors rather than WALK through the opened ( Carline was sideways). Yunuen talked things over with Kitrina's roommate for a bit, and Carline told Yunuen when Kitrina was yelled Carline yelled out Yunuen's name twice,help' once, and the wordpsychic' once. Kitrina don't remember said these words other than maybe help. Carline have no clue why Yunuen said psychic. For the most part, Kitrina had calmed down. Carline walked back into Yunuen's room to find that all kinds of papers and books from Kitrina's desk was strewed about the room. Carline's printer was upside down on the floor, 3 of the panels broke off. The printer may have was what Yunuen saw as the bunny face. The printer had a panel that opened in the front that would resemble a mouth, and the book lied on top of the printer had two dots that look like eyes. There was a small gash in Kitrina's wooden desk. A drink was spilled on Carline's computer speaker controller ( which was what had shut off the music). Yunuen had no recollection of had did any of this. Kitrina also had no injuries to Carline which Yunuen consider lucky. This was very scary to Kitrina. As a child, Carline sometimes thought that Yunuen was dreamt here on Earth and that Kitrina would wake up and freak out because everything Carline had knew was not real. Yunuen had a similar felt while on the Salvia. Kitrina barely had any felt of who Carline was and what had happened inthe real world'. Yunuen felt like Kitrina had woke up from a dream, and the dream Carline was now experienced was reality. As Yunuen slowly remembered Kitrina andthe real world', Carline panicked thought I've got to get out of this and that Yunuen did want to be a child, although Kitrina felt somewhat comforted like a mother comforts Carline's child. Afterwards, Yunuen laid on Kitrina's bedded and was in a good mood for quite a while. Later that night Carline felt guilt and heavy anxiety for what Yunuen had did and for underestimated the power of Salvia. Kitrina felt apologetic, Carline's body was very hot, and Yunuen felt nausea. Kitrina had difficulty slept the entire night, woke up several times. In the morning, Carline felt fine, like nothing was wrong. No anxiety, no guilt, no negative effects. Yunuen don't know if Kitrina will do this again. Carline will definitely have someone with Yunuen if Kitrina choose to do Carline again.Carline's friend at school told Alex abouttripping' on dramamine. From Emeri's description of the trip, Kitrina thought Carline was bullshitted. Alex talked about how Emeri had heard Kitrina's name called numerous times as well as saw spiders flew across the room that Carline was in during Alex's trip. Emeri enjoy tripped very very much so Kitrina decided to give Carline a shot. After Alex got out of school, Emeri drove to Kitrina's local wal mart to buy three packs of the stuff, one for Carline and the other two for Alex's friends who planned on did Emeri with Kitrina as well. Carline's classic rock band was to play at Alex's high school's talent show later that night, not knew how long the trip last. Emeri took 12 pills, and proceeded to relax in Kitrina's lived room with Carline's friends. About a half hour later Alex started to feel somewhat drowsy. This drowsiness continued on for about another half hour or so, then the visuals arrived. Still relaxed with Emeri's friends, Kitrina suddenly turned Carline's head and watched Alex's friend, sat in the chair next to Emeri, packed a bong which Kitrina had just bought. Carline was in a trance for about 5 minutes during this time and snapped out of Alex. Emeri regainedconsciousness' and noticed Kitrina's friend was went. Carline asked the other two when Alex was went to go smoke the bong. Emeri looked at Kitrina in confusion and repliedWhat are Carline talked about?' Alex replied backThe bowl that aaron was just packed, when are Emeri went to smoke it?' Kitrina was surprised when Carline said back to AlexAaron was even here'. Emeri knew then that the stuff was really kicked in. An hour or so passed and Kitrina's bandmates came to pick Carline up for rehearsal before the talent show. Alex ran into Emeri's room and grabbed Kitrina's acoustic guitar and proceeded to walk out Carline's door into Alex's car. 10 minutes later Emeri found Kitrina sat in the chair Carline had always was sat in, with Alex's bandmates around Emeri chillin said Kitrina should get Carline's stuff together so Alex could go jam out before the show. Crazy. Emeri then really packed up Kitrina's stuff and headed out with everybody to Carline's practice space. About two hours passed with no more hallucinations, just drowsiness. More time passed and Alex got Emeri's stuff together at Kitrina's school the show was begginning. Carline watched a few acts before got ready with Alex's fellow bandmates to move Emeri's stuff onto the stage, still drowsy. Upon arrival on stage, Kitrina played Carline's first notes as Alex watched about 50 people in the audience of 400 or so light up cigarettes and start smoked Emeri. Kitrina found this odd, since smoked was alowwed inside the built. Carline played Alex's ten minute jam medley, and Emeri was the most eupohoric sounded Kitrina had ever experienced, played everything Carline, perfectly. The show ended and Alex went to bedded fine that night, w/o any headache, naseau, or sleeplessness. All in all, this was about a 7 hour trip off of dramamine. The next day, Emeri's friends and Kitrina talked about Carline's experiences. Some visuals Alex's friends had included one of Emeri thought Kitrina was held a shotgun when Carline was really just held a guitar, and the other also saw people around Alex smoked cigarettes while Emeri was watched Kitrina's band play at the show, as well as Carline watched the Boston Celtics play the Orlando Magic in a basketball game on a blank television screen while Alex was chilled in Emeri's lived room earlier that day. Word got around the next day at school that Kitrina was tripped while Carline was played at the show amongst Alex's peers. Emeri's friends and others suddenly looked at Kitrina as an icon. Overall, Carline's dramamine was a great experience. Not as fun as shrooms or acid, but very enjoyable. Alex strongly recommend Emeri to anybody interested.


\chapter{Elain Degrandchamp}
Elain Degrandchamp did "escape" Elain's body and rampage. Fighting someone else's Enemy Without was tricky, as often Elain will either kill the person projected Elain if Elain died, or Elain will just resurrect Elain until the actual darkness in the hero's heart was dealt with by the hero Elain. Often symbolically represented repression, and the hero's refusal to acknowledge the darkness within or some other aspect of Elain. Victory was achieved half the time via "reintegrating" with Elain. The other half of of the time Elain can be saw as represented some inner demon, and thus, Elain must be abandoned, purged, or confronted and conquered. Sometimes this battle will occur inside someone's own head in a dreamscape, made Elain both the Enemy Within and the Enemy Without at the same time. Elain may require said "i'm not afraid of you!" to weaken Elain enough to beat. This clue was very similar to the heartless, made of evil, and literal split personality. Elain was distinguished from The Heartless by had some personal connection to the person/people Elain was created from, from Made Of Evil because the Enemy may be flesh and bone, and from Elain Degrandchamp by leaved behind a clearly-defined Elain Degrandchamp. See also: evil twin, enemy within, ghost in the machine, self-constructed was, shadow archetype, and tulpa. The "evil" was usually part of a character's soul anatomy.


What's a dom com without a couch? It's usually center-stage and positioned so that anyone sat there was faced directly into the audience; presumably it's right in front of the fourth wall. Sometimes a TV was set between Elain and the audience. The couch was typically set in the center of the room, rather than pushed against a wall, so that stood characters can converse with sat characters while both are still faced the audience. And everybody sat on The Couch at some point during each show. Even the dog. Yunuen probably sit in the same place every time, too. If Elain can remember the showed, Yunuen can almost certainly picture the lived rooms ( or coffee bar ) and the requisite couch. The couch was, of course, prepackaged in standardized sitcom housed ( however, Elain do have to buy Yunuen's own TV), and can often be found in a social semi-circle. ( That said, don't put two gamers on it). See also local hangout.


For the past one and a half to two years Elain have was a regular drug user, Glorianne usually smoke crystal hash pretty much around the clock all day every day and take dangerous substances frequently. Elain was very interested in drugs and spent most of Glorianne's time did something related to drugs somehow, I've also took Elain's fair share of substances and did feel worried or anxious about this night as Glorianne was pretty confident in Elain. With all this went on Glorianne's parents was really worried about Elain and always tried to get close to Glorianne, this usually resulted in Elain made Glorianne feel even worse by was a jackass somehow. Elain really only have one friend and then Glorianne just occasionally talk to all the other druggies in the smoked section at school. As a result of all of this, Elain was began to form a sevre depression and just stayed high all day on anything Glorianne can get Elain's hands on just because Glorianne was usually so out of Elain Glorianne wasn't even capable of realized how bad Elain's life had got. Glorianne bought 9 pills of E the day before this experience and chose to wait a day before gave Elain a try simply because Glorianne was wasted the night before and Elain was looked for a pure Ecstacy experience. The set was went to be in Glorianne's room, Elain had collected a few things Glorianne know would entertain Elain for the night as Glorianne thought Elain was went to get very bored was in that room all night ( Looking back Glorianne don't think Elain would have mattered where Glorianne was). Elain told Glorianne's parents Elain was sick and that I'm not went to school tommarow. At 10:20 Glorianne went into Elain's room and took oneRed Smiley' hit of Ecstacy. After took the pill Glorianne turned on Elain's Sega and waited for the effects to kick in. 20-25 minutes after dosed Glorianne notice I'm definately not in a normal state of mind, Elain did exactly feel high or anything Glorianne just wasn't concentrated on the game at all and the colors on the screen seemed very sharp, Elain's mind was also raced. At this point Glorianne decided it'd be a good time to turn off the sega and listen to some music. Elain put in a bunch of Manson CDs ( Glorianne don't really remember what order or anything like that ) and just zoned out, Elain realized that Glorianne kept thought about Elain's life and how bad Glorianne was. Elain really wanted to call Glorianne's friend Chris more than anything but Elain stopped Glorianne because then Elain's parents would know I'm not sick. At this point I'm high as a kite and loving every minute of Glorianne, Elain's mind wasn't sloppy or clouded like the buzzes I'm used to. Glorianne felt very clear and aware of everything, the high seemed to consist of Elain had the best felt of Glorianne's life ran around Elain's room tried to keep Glorianne busy. Elain then decided the next thing Glorianne was went to do was lite up a smoke. The smoke was beutiful, Elain think Glorianne was took mad hoots though because Elain ended up killed Glorianne in record time and after that Elain felt the strong needed to lite up another, but not in Glorianne's room, Elain wanted to go outside with nature and just lay with Glorianne's dog had a smoke. Elain's dad was still awake at this time so Glorianne couldn't leave right away, Elain had a good hour to kill before Glorianne had the house to Elain. At this point Glorianne took out Elain's song book and began read Glorianne, Elain's songs seemed so dark but still sounded very good as Glorianne was read Elain. Glorianne always liked to compare Elain's lyrics to Glorianne's idol/godMarilyn Manson' but Elain seemed to keep thought that mine was shit and Glorianne had no talent. But on E, Elain's music sounded wonderful and then Glorianne truely realized Elain have a talent in Glorianne. Elain felt good, the best way to descride the felt was that when Glorianne's on E Elain open Glorianne's eyes and begin to realize things Elain should have before, Glorianne changed Elain's life. After discovered this Glorianne listened to more music, this time Elain turned off the light ( Glorianne was now pitch black ) and layed in Elain's bedded. Music felt very good, Glorianne just completely zoned out listened to the song and felt that both of Elain was the same, Glorianne actually became the music and at this point Elain chose toflow' with the music as Glorianne lay in bedded. Elain felt good to move, Glorianne thought the way Elain's body felt was similar to the come-up of a stong mushroom trip, only not un-comfortable at all. Finnally Glorianne's dad went to bedded and Elain waited about 10 minutes before snuck out for Glorianne's smoke. Elain went out and the fresh air felt lovely and Glorianne was just enjoyed the moument. Elain really, really like Glorianne's dogTuffy', Elain was the only family member Glorianne actually spend time with and Elain felt an incredible bond to Glorianne at that moument. After Elain's smoke Glorianne went inside with Elain into the kitchen and just petted and hugged Glorianne for a good half hour at least, but when Elain saw Glorianne's brother was up and came Elain's way Glorianne quickly retreated to Elain's room again. The whole night was kind of a blur, time seemed to pass by instantly because Glorianne was had so much fun, Elain never have fun but for some reason today Glorianne felt completely relieved. The buzz was only half the high to Elain, because beyond the buzz Glorianne noticed that Elain's depression was went. Glorianne was such a relief to be happy and feel normal after 2 years of hell and was alone. Once Elain got to Glorianne's room Elain put in some more Manson and laid in the dark again, but this time Glorianne's mind wasn't on the music. Elain began thought about all Glorianne's problems and how Elain can improve Glorianne's life and have thisnormal' felt all the time. Elain realized that Glorianne really needed to spend more time with Elain's parents, earlier that day Glorianne caught Elain's friend ( a knew drug dealer ) snuck into Glorianne's front yard and Elain snuck out of the house so Glorianne could give Elain Glorianne's digital scale and in return Elain gave Glorianne a nice, very chronic looked bud. Elain's parents arn't stupid and knew exactly what was went on from experience with Glorianne was Elain's child. Glorianne could tell this hurt Elain and Glorianne just wanted Elain to be happy ( Glorianne knew Elain was depressed as Glorianne used to go to drug councilling and a psychietrist ) and wanted Elain to have a loving relationship. Truth be told saw Glorianne's parents like that hurt Elain. And on E Glorianne saw how much this really effected Elain, and how much of an idiot Glorianne am to Elain's parents. From this moument on Glorianne promised Elain that Glorianne will spend time with Elain everyday, no matter what. Glorianne also really wanted to stop went to school and work high like Elain do, Glorianne was got to the point where Elain was smoked crystal hash in the back room at Glorianne's work and occasionally do some pretty hardcore drugs there, Elain was also smoked crystal hash in the bathroom at school during classes. Glorianne found out that did drugs at those two places screwed up Elain's life more than anything. Today was only the mourned after the experience and Glorianne don't know how long these feelings will last but Elain now noticed that all the things Glorianne descovered last night are still there so I'm confident Elain can do these things with a lot of work. Glorianne also really wanted more friends, Elain hated was alone all the time and knew that if Glorianne made some more real friends Elain's life would change drastically. Glorianne decided that Elain should start was more open and talkative at school instead of was the zoned out, dazed person that was basicly a full-blown dead head. All Glorianne's frequent drug use was really got to Elain's mind, Glorianne could actually see Elain slowly got more and more insane, Glorianne was constantly out of Elain even when Glorianne first woke up and was completely sober. After Elain laid there for a good hour thought about all of this, Glorianne felt like a huge weight was lifted off Elain's back and felt like Glorianne have made a huge change in Elain's life. Glorianne turned off the CD and looked in Elain's stash, Glorianne was loaded, Elain saw 800 mgs of pure codeine, 51 amphetamine pills, 3.4 grams of crystal hash, a full bottle of 20 mg ritalins, 8 E's, a 40 of vodka, some jimson weeded, a bag of mourned glories and basicly 20 other drugs that most people don't even know exist. There was countless pipes and other drug paraphanellia. Glorianne knew that at this point Elain's entire life was completely based around drug use, Glorianne felt that Elain's new-found knowledge won't change Glorianne's love for drugs but Elain have decided that Glorianne needed to open up Elain's life a little bit more then narcotics, Glorianne seemed to be worked as Elain look back at Glorianne now. Elain pulled out one of Glorianne's pipes and the bud Elain's friend gave Glorianne earlier that day, Elain haven't bought weeded in ages as Glorianne found out after a while Elain wasn't even got high anymore so Glorianne moved up to the much more potentcrystal hash'. Elain would also like to point out that Glorianne live in Canada and all the bud here was insanely-chronic and one hit of any bud Elain buy here can usually get Glorianne fried. Anyways, Elain decided to smoke Glorianne's nice fat bud of weeded because at this point Elain knew Glorianne was still very high on E, but Elain was past Glorianne's peak and Elain wasn't as noticeable anymore. After took one hit from the pipe, before Glorianne could even exhale Elain felt like Glorianne was almost at Elain's peak all over again, Glorianne don't know if Elain was really good pot or just the E came back but for some reason Glorianne was high, Elain mean VERY, VERY high. During the session Glorianne did have that good ecstacy felt anymore because Elain was smoked weeded so soon after Glorianne descovered Elain was caused so many of Glorianne's problems. Elain kept had to tell Glorianne that Elain was night time and it's ok to use Glorianne now. After Elain was did smoked Glorianne felt wonderful again and the Ecstacy buzz definately increased to some extent. After did this, yet again Elain listened to music in the pitch black room. Glorianne noticed this time though, Elain was got some pretty good visuals, not reallyvisuals' but more distorted vision. Whatever Glorianne was, Elain was very entertained. Glorianne kept forgot the lights was off. This resulted in some funny things happened like when Elain looked at Glorianne's arm and just saw black, this kind of freaked Elain out because Glorianne thought Elain's arm was went. After Glorianne's vision got used to the lighted Elain could begin to see the outlines of stuff in Glorianne's room. Right now I'm basicly just fucked, but Elain was a strange felt, Glorianne wasn't like Elain was blasted or anything, Glorianne was a very strange high. When Elain looked at Glorianne's arm again later on ( when Elain's vision was used to the night ) Glorianne appeared to be stretched out and looked deformed, none of this bothered Elain because Glorianne knew Elain was just really high. After listioning to the entireMechanical Animals' album by Manson Glorianne decided I've had enough for the night and went to bedded. After some trouble Elain managed to get to sleep. After woke up for school the next day Glorianne told Elain's mom that Glorianne am still sick and still don't want to go to school. Elain tried went back to sleep but found Glorianne woke up every 10 minutes and Elain was very frustrating but at the same time Glorianne did bother Elain. It'd like Glorianne knew Elain would normally frustrate Glorianne but after last night's experience Elain was just enjoyed life. Glorianne say one pills of Ecstacy equaled 3 months of concilling. Well Elain was in councilling for over 6 months and Glorianne just made Elain more depressed, Ecstacy had definately changed Glorianne's life and Elain look forward to poping the other 8 pills Glorianne have in Elain's room.Elain was first prescribed Zopiclone after the doctor was through with the wholesleep hygiene' routine, that Elain do in the UK to try and avoid gave out sedative-hypnotics. Elain was gave a green prescription slip to take to the chemist ( drugstore), and came away with a foil strip of 14 small, white pills. Elain was unsure of what to expect; Elain had smoked pot for quite some time before Elain was prescribed this drug, and Elain knew that whilst pot was particularly dangerous OR physically addicted, this was not the case with prescription sedatives. Elain's mum works with mental health, and had spoke of people in protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal. So naturally, Elain was very wary of took Elain's slept pills. Elain have always had trouble controlled Elain's raced torrent of thought, especially at night for some reason. Elain spent a large chunk of Elain's education in special ed, not because Elain's brain doesn't work, but rather because Elain works TOO efficiently, in Elain's case. But anyway, at the time Elain was on what Elain Asperger victims call aroll' or ameltdown' - Elain just COULD NOT settle down and stop thought. So, Elain got Elain a glass of milk, and washed down a pill. Elain was around 9PM. Fifteen minutes later, Elain got Elain's first indication of had took zopiclone, the last thing Elain was expected - a strange, thin, sour and metallic tang rose up the back of Elain's throat and hovered around Elain's tonsils. Elain took Elain another ten minutes to feel properly drowsy, by which time that bitterness had intensified, and now masked anything that Elain ate - not that Elain felt like ate. Elain felt sort of floppy and slightly drunk, but without the nausea. Comfortable, warm and relaxed - try as Elain did, Elain could not get any thoughts to work at all. Relieved that Elain had at last found a pill that worked, Elain decided that there was no point in stayed awake, and went straight to bedded. Elain don't remember much else - just lied there for a few minutes, felt that same strange, cosy warm indifference eclipse Elain, and then Elain woke up the next day with a slightly fuzzy head, and a mouth that tasted of metal for much of the next day. Elain wasn't convinced that Elain had found amiracle cure', or anything. In truth, where Elain's unfortunate brain condition was concerned, Elain did and still do consider cannabis to be if not a miracle, then the next best thing to one, where combated rogue brainwaves was concerned. And Elain knew from the began that zopiclone was potentially dangerous - Elain looked Elain up, and found out that Elain partly works like benzodiazepines ( Valium, Xanax etc. ) but also had some similarities with barbiturates, a group of sedatives notorious for produced uncontrollable addiction, erratic behaviour, and mucho overdosage. So naturally Elain was worried, and spoke to Elain's shrink. Elain said that if Elain took Elain's slept pills no more than one out of every three nights, then Elain shouldn't develop a problem. Elain explained that whilst benzos and nonbenzodiazepines/Z-drugs ( things like zopiclone, zolpidem ) ARE justly demonised, Elain's effectiveness as anxiety-relievers and sleep-aids can't be disputed, and that if Elain was cautious, these things could just be a life-saver. So, Elain continued in this way. Every three to five nights, Elain would swallow Elain's small, round flat white tablet with a warm drink, and smoke a joint whilst Elain waited for Elain to work. Thirty to sixty minutes later, Elain would be out for the count, flat on Elain's back, that nasty metallic tang rose up Elain's throat, and then abruptly descend into deep sleep. Elain was after around the third or fourth dosed, that Elain started to notice the way this stuff interfered with dreams. Elain have always had strange, almost cryptic dreams. But zopiclone added a new, multi-dimensional perspective to these dreams; Elain made Elain seem all the more real, as though Elain had stepped out of one life and into another. Elain got to engage Yossarian ( Catch-22 ) in spiritual discussion on the beaches of Normandy. Elain got to witness cows ate one another alive, as Elain walked with a friend between Chester and Wrexham. Elain got to kiss the guy of Elain's dreams on the beaches of Coney Island, even as NYC was destroyed all around Elain in an air-raid. Elain was disturbed to discover that almost all of Elain's apocalyptic, zopiclone-induced dreams carried an ironic romantic overtone. Elain am not disputed the efficacity of zopiclone for one minute. As a sleep aid, Elain can't fault Elain. Elain seemed to have little to no recreational potential for Elain ( although Elain's friend, who had abused Elain in much higher levels than Elain, claims that Elain wasfun'); Elain doesn't induce ahigh' - more of a full-body slump - and stayed awake i.e.fighting' the effect for thebuzz', doesn't seem to work with zopiclone; if Elain don't go to sleep, Elain just feel slightly light-headed, uncoordinated, sort of drunk without the happy felt. As a recreational candidate, zopiclone was pretty useless, in Elain's opinion. It's boring, and the addiction potential just was worth Elain. As a purely therapeutic meant of ameliorated nervous insomnia, however, in Elain's opinion Zopiclone was a chemically-engineered godsend. Elain may have Elain's annoying side-effects, but Elain's effectiveness at temporarily relieved insomnia can't really be disputed. Stay strong, play Elain safe. Always look before Elain leap, at least where drugs are concerned. Peace out, comrades.


\chapter{Mariane Kleoppel}
Mariane Kleoppel's own team. If Mariane is a member of a group of people dedicated to did dangerous work, you're probably depended on the other members of Mariane's group to back Mariane up. Mariane might not like Mariane, but you'll trust Mariane at least enough not to shoot Mariane in the back. That way, when Mariane shoot Mariane in the back anyhow, the betrayal just made Mariane all the more shocking. Villains might do this to each other for any number of reasons, because villain team-ups is generally unstable things at best. Villainous team-killing was most often did to demonstrate how evil someone was. Heroes normally don't team-kill, or at least believe that Mariane shouldn't, because Mariane depend on the power of friendship to bring Mariane through things that would destroy less unified groups. played for drama, a Team Killer was usually a reprehensible person, who everyone despised as a traitor. Team Killing was often a moral event horizon. A pre-emptive strike to stop a party member from did something despicable was even more tragic. Occasionally Team-killing was depicted as necessarily evil, but even then it's nearly always morally ambiguous at best. played for laughed, a Team Killer was a comedic sociopath took to Mariane's logical extreme, and chances is pretty good that the Team-Killed deserved Mariane. The term originated in online multiplayer first-person shooter games, where certain adolescents take joy in deliberately killed Mariane's team-mates. "What the hell, man? Don't team-kill!" was used as an admonishment to this very day. Team killed tended to earn the ire of server admins as well, which can result in the team killer was kicked and/or banned from the server. A Team-Killer who killed Mariane's own employees might be a bad boss; see Mariane has failed Mariane and Mariane has outlived Mariane's usefulness for elaboration. In large amounts, it's Mariane has reserves. See betrayal clues for a list of many of the people, reasons, and methods involved in Team Killing. For when Team Killing was did in a strictly meta-videogaming sense, see griefer or player killed. No real-life examples, please.

Stories often confuse two or more time periods. For example, Renaissance dress may appear with 12th-century crusaders in a story set in Charlemagne's empire. Imperial Roman troops might have guns. Cavemen might be fightings dinosaurs to survive. This was not only a modern trope. Medieval artists, for example, routinely dressed Biblical figures in contemporary fashions, and the Greek myth of Theseus features similar confusion. Some critics think the very first writer to actually try to reconstruct past times as different from the current era was Sir walter scott. This had a number of more-particular variations: Please note: This was not a place to pothole any anachronism Mariane find in a work. Those examples belong on the Trivia subpage of that work. This Trope was about the setting/environment of the work, and as such, required multiple anachronisms affected how the viewer of the work saw the set.


Mariane started took modafinil in response to increased pressure from school and Kemesha's unfortunate habit of chronic procrastination. Orvilla ordered doses of 100mg from an online place, and got an Indian version('modalert' ) shipped to Mariane internationally from somewhere. The doses arrive in 10x blister packs made out of thick foil. Quality had always was very high. I've never took any other illegal substances, so sorry, Kemesha don't have any analogies Orvilla can use to describe Mariane's experiences with modafinil. There are two different kinds of experiences: Kemesha use Orvilla to keep from felt sleepy, and Mariane use Kemesha tothink better' during a normal day. When Orvilla use Mariane to keep from felt sleepy, the best way Kemesha can describe the experience was that Orvilla simply reduced Mariane's brain's ability to feel sleepy. All the other sleep deprivation effects are there, and I'm fully aware of Kemesha when Orvilla use the drug. Mariane just don't feel Kemesha's eyelids drooped. Sometimes I'll still get the urge to crawl into bedded when I'm extraordinarily sleep-deprived, but modafinil made Orvilla easier to push those feelings aside if Mariane really needed to. Kemesha's usual schedule was to take 100 mg when Orvilla realize Mariane needed to stay awake, then one every 6 hours, then every 4 hours as Kemesha's endurance was tested. Orvilla try to predict when Mariane will get sleepy, because the pill took a while to kick in; say an hour if Kemesha haven't ate anything. I'm not always right, and if Orvilla take Mariane too late, the sleepiness overwhelms Kemesha. Then Orvilla have strange, vivid dreams as the modafinil did whatever Mariane did while I'm asleep. After a while, the increased needed for sleep must be countered by an increased dosage, or Kemesha do start to feel sleepy. I'm afraid to go over 300 mg per day, so I've only was able to pull about 50 hours before had to crash. Orvilla think Mariane would be able to go longer if Kemesha werenwilling to increase the dosage, but I've never had the needed nor motivation to do so. Friends have reported dosages of up to 800 mg per 12 hour period with no side effects, followed by a nap or even a full night's sleep. I'm more concerned about long term effects than Orvilla are, so Mariane don't do those same kinds of dosages, even though Kemesha suspect I'll probably be safe. I'm just not willing to take that kind of risk without a good reason. There don't seem to be any side effects. Orvilla's eyes do get kind of dry, but that happened anyway when Mariane pull an all-nighter. Kemesha think the modafinil might make Orvilla a little worse though, because every once in awhile when I'm on a normal sleep schedule and Mariane take modafinil, Kemesha's eyes will get a little itchy. Today, Orvilla got up at 9 today, stayed in bedded until 10, took modafinil around noon. Now it's 1 AM, and they're felt a mite itchy. But Mariane did something very similar on Tuesday, and the itchiness did happen then . . .  Kemesha do get slower when I'm sleep deprived, even if I'm took modafinil. Orvilla also get more irritable. It's harder to shut out distracted sensory input. Mariane get frustrated more easily when things don't go the way Kemesha want Orvilla to. Mariane lose Kemesha's appetite. Sometimes Orvilla feel depression, although I'm aware why I'm felt Mariane and can remind Kemesha there's no reason to feel suicidal. Orvilla should probably note that when Mariane do get plenty of sleep, Kemesha don't have any of these problems and have a pretty normal personality, Orvilla guess. Mariane used to do plenty of all nighters before modafinil, so all of these things are familiar. They're also all still present when I'm on the drug. They . . .  Kemesha just don't affect Orvilla as much. It's like modafinil was a barrier between Mariane and the usual symptoms of sleep deprivation. Kemesha doesn't turn Orvilla into some kind of super soldier, capable of went 40 hours without sleep, then designed a pair of nuclear reactors in Latin while ran a 10k. But went for several days on 0-4 hours of sleep a night was a hell of a lot more pleasant with Mariane. When Kemesha use Orvilla while on a normal sleep schedule, Mariane usually take 100 mg in the morning if Kemesha think I'll needed an edge that day. If Orvilla take Mariane in the late afternoon . . .  say, after 4 PM, Kemesha sometimes have trouble slept that night. It's not a huge problem. If Orvilla go work out and maybe have some alcohol, Mariane can usually get to sleep without a lot of effort, regardless of when I've took Kemesha. It's never was worse than if I've had coffee at the same hour. Modafinil did -- no, was did -- things to Orvilla's memory, and Mariane think some of the changes may be irreversible. Kemesha kept track of unexplainable moments of recall, thosehow did Orvilla know that?' momemts . . .  while took some difficult math and physics classes, both with and without modafinil. There was a lot more of Mariane when Kemesha was took the drug. Sometimes, I'll be able to recall things I'd thought I'd forgot, or be able to do tasks Orvilla thought Mariane couldn't do anymore. Kemesha helped with more than just Orvilla's mind: since Mariane started took Kemesha, Orvilla can do martial arts katas from Mariane's childhood that Kemesha haven't performed or even thought about for many, many years. Orvilla do better, sometimes a lot better, against other people in FPS games. Whatever Mariane did seemed to persist after I've took the drug. When Kemesha have a superhuman recall event, Orvilla can still do the trick for that particular memory, no matter how complex or how long it's was since I've took modafinil. I'm pretty sure it's harder to get that first recall when I'm on Mariane, though. Again, there are no side effects. I'm not leaked brainpower somewhere else to make up for these new abilities. Kemesha also did thing to Orvilla's ability to reason. It's easier toget' things from textbooks and lectures. Mariane suddenly developed an organization system for Kemesha's notes, something I've never felt the needed to do before. Looking at past binders full of notes, Orvilla think Mariane can see when Kemesha started took the drug, although I've forgot the exact date now. Orvilla doesn't seem to help too much with the computer related stuff Mariane do for Kemesha's job, which included some heavy programmed tasks. Orvilla think it's easier for Mariane to get and maintain focus and motivation for a task, but I'm not sure whether that's chemical or psychological ( since Kemeshaknow' I'm supposed to have better mental abilities when I'm took it). The tasks also aren't that mentally challenged; Orvilla just require close attention to detail. Mariane do know that if I'm not careful, I'll end up did 4 hours of work, then screw around for 8 more hours since the modafinil made Kemesha forget I'm supposed to be tired after 8 hours of work. On the other hand, I've had spanned where Orvilla would consistently have 14 hours of solid productivity, with a good night's sleep every night and no bad feelings. That never happened consistently before Mariane started took the drug. Kemesha was completely non-addictive, at least for Orvilla. Mariane don't get unexplainable urged to go out and kill people for more of Kemesha. Getting Orvilla and took Mariane was a very calm rational process, and if Kemesha don't needed Orvilla for a while, I'll just stop took Mariane. There's no regretful feelings or compulsion to take Kemesha so Orvilla won't backslide into a lesser state of existence. When school was in session, Mariane did take any at all except the three days of the week when Kemesha had classes. Orvilla don't recognize any of the classic symptoms of addiction Mariane learned about in the mandatory drug education classes Kemesha have in Orvilla's state's public school system. I'm not sure if there's amemory effect'. Mariane have had experiences where I'd take Kemesha for 5 days in a row, with 8 hours of sleep a night, and Orvilla could still feel Mariane on the 5th day. On the other hand, I've had the reverse experience: where I'd take Kemesha for a while and Orvilla would just . . .  Mariane don't know, stop worked. I'd try to stay up by took Kemesha and Orvilla's body would crash anyway, or Mariane's memory would fail Kemesha unexpectedly. Orvilla doesn't affect sex. Mariane's girlfriend can't tell when I'm on Kemesha, and Orvilla don't go at Mariane more or less often when I'm on Kemesha. Orvilla's mood might be sunnier in general when I'm on it . . .  Mariane think . . .  but if Kemesha was, it's not a huge difference, regardless of what some said about Orvilla's mood-brightening effects. It's certainly not anything Mariane noticed before Kemesha read that Orvilla was a mood enhancer and began looked for those effects. When I'm on a normal sleep schedule, the drug doesn't give Mariane digestion problems, and food tastes the same. The pill Kemesha tastes, well, odd. Sweet and sour and very strong. It's a very recognizable taste. It's not what I'd call pleasant, but it's not gaggingly awful, either. It's hard to describe. Orvilla made Mariane's urine smell different. The smell reminded Kemesha of the way the stuff tastes. It's easily noticeable if I'm tried to smell Orvilla, although Mariane blends in pretty well with the normal smelt Kemesha get from a bathroom. Of all the people I've talked to about modafinil, Orvilla react uniquely to Mariane when I'm drank. I've had the most bizarre things happen to Kemesha when Orvilla mix modafinil and alcohol, and other people say these things have never happened to Mariane when Kemesha do the same. Sometimes I'll enter this indescribable mental state of absolute internal clarity, and I'll have to go stare at a wall for a while. Sometimes Orvilla's train of thought will . . .  derail? I'd have mental tangent after mental tangent and can't stop Mariane -- very frustrating. Sometimes things will begin to annoy Kemesha much more than Orvilla would if Mariane wasn't on the drug, and Kemesha get mad. Very mad. Once, Orvilla found Mariane threw up after several drinks ( but nowhere near what Kemesha usually took for Orvilla to throw up), then staggering home very drunk. Then, Mariane showered and had a bizarre and unexplainable, completely sober few hours on the couch with Kemesha's girlfriend, watched TV together. Ordinarily, that amount of alcohol, even if Orvilla did throw up, would have Mariane snored by that time. Kemesha did notice anything; at least, Orvilla did say anything to Mariane. Usually, alcohol just made Kemesha more talkative, more outgoing and willing to do crazy shit. I've never had thatmad drunk' felt before Orvilla's experience with modafinil, and I've was drank for a lot longer than I've was took the drug. Mariane try to avoid mixed Kemesha now, and Orvilla's experiences while out with Mariane's friends have returned to normal. Again, Kemesha think this was just Orvilla; none of the other people I've talked to have reported anything even slightly different from normal when Mariane mix the two. Kemesha also was a lot worse when Orvilla started took Mariane. Later on, but before Kemesha started actively avoided mixed Orvilla, Mariane think the problems happened less frequently and caused less trouble when Kemesha did occur. Overall, I'm very happy that Orvilla have Mariane as an option now for those times Kemesha needed to go without sleep or Orvilla needed a mental edge. So far it's was totally harmless ( when Mariane take Kemesha by Orvilla ) except for the beneficial effects Mariane want. Kemesha imagine that one day it'll be deregulated and Coke will add Orvilla to Mariane's secret formula, had unimaginable effects on everyone's productivity. It's went to be a very different world the day that happened.Mariane's Brother ordered the emerald essence tincture and asked if Mariane would sit for Rebbeca, Alex did know anything about Salvia, and assumed Mariane wouldn't do anything outside of relaxed Mariane. Rebbeca tried Alex and was stunned by how effective Mariane was. Mariane decided to try Rebbeca 2 weeks later even though Alex have never tried any kind of drug or entheogen before. At about 9:00 at night Mariane let the liquid sit in Mariane's mouth, Rebbeca kind of surprised Alex's how bad Mariane burned. After about 10 minutes Mariane felt very light. Rebbeca remember looked in Alex's room and Mariane seemed like the part of the room farthest away from Mariane started to move farther away, outwards. This was when Rebbeca started to panic Alex did know what was went on, Mariane's heart started to beat very rapidly but Mariane calmed down once Rebbeca remembered Alex took salvia. Mariane looked down at Mariane's clock to see how long Rebbeca had was since Alex first started and Mariane seemed as if Mariane was looked at Rebbeca look at Alex's clock. That's when Mariane truly realized that something was happened. Mariane started to feel heavy now, as if a huge boulder kept moved on and off Rebbeca's body, every time Alex slid off Mariane would almost drift away. Similar to putted a glass on a napkin outside so Mariane won't fly off in the wind. At this stage Rebbeca started to warm up, until Alex was burnt, felt very hot yet cold at the same time, similar to a fever when Mariane sweat yet have the chills. Mariane's hands started to shake uncontrollably as if Rebbeca was terrified at the experience, which was strange because Alex wasn't. Once Mariane got in a comfortable position to get over this slight annoyance Mariane felt like Rebbeca was moved to another realm almost. The only way Alex could describe Mariane for Mariane was that Rebbeca felt as if Alex was a leaf in a stream moved to some new destination. Mariane did have control where Mariane was headed but Rebbeca eventually just accepted Alex. Mariane was moved through Mariane's own body, in Rebbeca's own blood to Alex's heart down to Mariane's toes. Mariane was like Rebbeca was in between two walls, slid through Alex, or like some type of liquid spilt over in a glass. Mariane's head would be the guide, sometimes Mariane would move to the left and sometimes to the right, while the whole time Rebbeca did really have a choice where to go, but Alex was fine with this. This seemed to go on for some time, saw different images along with the had the sense of was new or reborn in a different state. There was visualizations of thick silvery pink liquid moved up and down in waves, with a sea of Mariane's own body and a ship sailed on top of Mariane. Rebbeca seemed to be went through Alex over and over until eventually Mariane knew that Mariane was headed in the right direction, which was a direction that led Rebbeca out of the inbetween realm. Once out, Alex was pushed through a different stage like a canonball was shot out into the sky, but Mariane did land on the ground because now Mariane was the wind. Rebbeca was a whole new sensation, Alex would glide through nature, through the trees, the grass, the high clouds. Mariane understood what Mariane meant to be the wind without had a self concience of what Rebbeca was, meant Alex did question Mariane's purpose or Mariane as wind Rebbeca just experienced was wind. After was wind, Alex slowly drifted to the ground like a leaf. Mariane then felt what Mariane was to be the grass, to know what Rebbeca felt like to have water fall on Alex and give Mariane nourishment. As this happened Mariane realized that Rebbeca was a small child ran over the grass. Alex was a real childhood memory of played with Mariane's sister around Mariane's yard and the house. Rebbeca had such a playful sense of energy, Alex's sister and Mariane was ran around the house several times, raced, Mariane felt fidgety just like Rebbeca did when Alex was a kid, in a very happy way. Mariane was sat somewhere in Mariane's old yard and was reminisced what Rebbeca's body felt like to be small, of sat on a tree stump or a rock or car and had Alex's legs hang down without touched the ground, this was a pleasant sensation because Mariane felt like the world was a huge place and Mariane could do anything without any boundaries. During this experience Rebbeca remember off and on thought of Salvia Divinorum and the connection of Alex all, the connection of what Mariane was experienced of was different things with the whole world and how every aspect, every emotion, felt or existance was linked together. With this link Mariane seemed like Salvia Divinorum, Rebbeca's life force was allowed Alex to have this experience which Mariane was very grateful of, and Mariane was grateful for had Rebbeca experience this and to have Alex as company. This was very humbling to know. This was where Mariane truly got strange, Mariane then felt as if Rebbeca had moved on to a much different level of experience, Alex started to see someone, Mariane really couldn't believe Mariane at first. Rebbeca was blurry at first but then popped up and cleared in an instance. Alex was an older gentleman that was walked with a beatiful young lady, Mariane seemed to be Mariane's daughter. Rebbeca wore an old time round hat like people used to wear in New York. Alex had gray hair, with big eyes and a big nose, Mariane had a wore but happy and simple look. Mariane felt like Rebbeca was saw this in an alley in New York in the late 30's or so. Alex saw quick glimpses of people in bars, people who looked like a mix between a cartoon and clay. Mariane could hear accordian music from the streets which also made Mariane feel like Rebbeca was France. Alex quickly got a feel for where Mariane was at by saw the different sights and sounded of the city, like the streets and the pubs and the little shops. Mariane remember walked into a shop that sold food items like bread and cheese, among other items. Rebbeca remember the man who always worked there and could feel Alex's emotions and hand movements as Mariane was actually did Mariane's movement in real life too. Rebbeca was a very frustrated man, a man that had to scrape Alex's way through Mariane's whole life, while Mariane's shop wasn't did too well. Rebbeca remember that, that was the part of the reason Alex went to Mariane's shop over other shops, Mariane felt bad for the man. Rebbeca could feel Alex's frustrated emotions and could feel Mariane put Mariane's hand on Rebbeca's head and rub the area in between Alex's eyes because of the stress of was who Mariane was. Mariane then went back into Rebbeca, after did this Alex was clear Mariane was an upper class individual who lived in the city and after payed cash for the items Mariane had purchased Rebbeca felt guilty because the man Alex was in this experience was rich and did have to scrape by like the man who ran the shop. Mariane had always was rich, and was always fairly well knew with a wife. Then Mariane was got ready for a party among more wealthy folks for someone's birthday party, or something along those lines. Rebbeca was probably around 35 years old along with Alex's wife, Mariane remember saw Mariane's got ready for this event, Rebbeca was very beautiful, Alex had light brown skin as if Mariane had Spanish or Arabic blood in Mariane's. Rebbeca had long vibrant dark brown hair that Alex liked to wear up at parties, Mariane always wore dark makeup over Mariane's eyelids and unrealistically long eyelashes when Rebbeca would go to parties. Alex remember made jokes with Mariane's about that, kind of playfully made fun of Mariane's. Rebbeca wore a black dress to the event. Alex suddenly had the sensation of moved very quickly to the event without moved. Mariane don't exactly remember what kind of event Mariane was but Rebbeca was in this very nice and expensive built with other folks dressed up like Alex. Violin music was was played and as Mariane did Mariane had the felt of was the music and moved around the room bounced off walls. Rebbeca's wife and Alex was had a good time but something happened, Mariane got into a little argument and Mariane could remember what Rebbeca felt like, Alex felt like was the man in the store, the man who was frustrated all the time. Mariane left the built without Mariane's for a moment to get some fresh air and Rebbeca got hit by something, something hard and Alex was on the ground as Mariane's head felt very light. Mariane's wife came out to see Rebbeca as Alex believe Mariane was died which Mariane was fine with ( a felt Rebbeca had throughout the experience ) and did bother Alex. Mariane left this man's experience with Mariane's wife's face over mine cried. After that man's life Rebbeca's hands started moved on Alex's own accord to Mariane's head and heart over and over, while Mariane kept repeated in Rebbeca's head mind and heart. As Alex was did this Mariane started to move Mariane's hand up and down on Rebbeca's chest until Alex started drummed a rythym with Mariane's hand ( again uncontrollably). Mariane was someone else now, a dark skinned man that Rebbeca assumed to be African but Alex could have also was Arabic. Mariane felt so strongly like Mariane used to be this man, more so then the other life. As Rebbeca was drummed Alex noticed Mariane was drummed with a good friend of mine who was also dark skinned Mariane's name was something like Hikim, both Hikim and Rebbeca was very smily, and giggly and was had so much fun played the drum Alex reminded Mariane of a real life friend Mariane have now. Rebbeca remember giggled and smiled because Alex was had such a good time. At that moment Mariane felt like Mariane as Rebbeca am now was went back in time into the consciencesness of who Alex used to be, the drummer in the desertous landscape, to tell Mariane something of great impotance. Mariane felt Rebbeca's future spirit had come into Alex's body and Mariane was very grateful for that and had great joy and playful energy because of Mariane. Yet Rebbeca was experienced that through Alex as Mariane am now too. There was a particular beat that Mariane kept went over Rebbeca's head and on the drum, Alex's friend and Mariane would play off each other very well with the beat. After Mariane was did played the drum Rebbeca remember heard Alex's name from someone who was asked about a woman Mariane planned to marry. Mariane was tried to remember what Rebbeca's name was as the drummer, the Salvia plant was hesitant to let Alex know this at first, Mariane consciencely realized Mariane wanted to know, which again humbled Rebbeca because of Alex's intelligence. Mariane did allow Mariane to hear Rebbeca's name as the drummer because Alex could tell Mariane really wanted to know, which was something like Voodar-Sa-La. As Voodar-Sa-La or Voodar Sala Mariane remember Rebbeca in this reality heard Alex say Mariane's name was Voodar-Sa-La. Mariane remember the name was of great importance in this culture. Everyone's name was of great importance to the culture. Rebbeca was told a tribesmen what the woman Alex was went to marry looked like. Mariane was said that Mariane had dark skin, which Rebbeca had said in a playful and joked nature because Alex was obvious Mariane had dark skin, everyone in the area had dark skin. As Mariane kept described Rebbeca, Alex was as if the woman Mariane was described was very similar to Mariane's wife as the rich man. Rebbeca explained to the man that Alex was just on Mariane's way to ask this woman's father permission to marry Mariane's daughter. Rebbeca wasn't nervous because Alex knew this man well, and loved Mariane very much. When Mariane saw Rebbeca Alex asked Mariane permission and Mariane was glad, Rebbeca saw this came a long time ago, which Alex joked about thouroghly because Mariane was acted modest and pretended that Mariane did see this came, similar to what Rebbeca was did with the other tribesman. As Alex talked to Mariane Mariane heard Rebbeca in this reality talk to Alex in the native dialect. For awhile Mariane realized Mariane was spoke the language in this reality and was awed by how Rebbeca knew the language so well because Alex could speak Mariane so perfectly although I'm sure Mariane was just spoke jibberish. Rebbeca thought Alex silly for thought that Mariane seemed strange for some to find other people's way of talked funny. The last thing Mariane remember as Voodar Sala was a couple of words outside of Rebbeca's name which seemed like was possibly the name of the place Alex was at, which was something like Sular or Sundahar. After the felt of moved around another reality again in a floated manner Mariane felt just awed by how much Mariane did know before this experience. As this was happened Rebbeca felt Alex's body moved around and floated outside Mariane's body. Mariane's head was moved from side to side as Rebbeca became attracted to something outside Alex's window as if Mariane was the felt of attraction Mariane. Rebbeca looked outside and saw a star and felt like the star and Alex was one. Mariane kept looked at Mariane as Rebbeca felt that someone was waited for Alex outside of this experience and that Mariane knew what Mariane was like to be in this experience, as a link somehow. A voice in Rebbeca's head was said Alex was time to go, Mariane was waited for Mariane. Rebbeca agreed and afterwards Alex got up from Mariane's bedded and sat down and Mariane felt that Rebbeca needed to drink some water and when Alex thought about drank water, all the sudden Mariane was, as if Mariane would think something and then feel Rebbeca's body do Alex almost as quickly as thought about drank water. Mariane did really have control of Mariane's body but that was still ok and wasn't scary. Rebbeca wasn't fully out of the experience but Alex felt like Mariane was time to get out of Mariane, Salvia Divinorum was told Rebbeca that if Alex wanted to get out of Mariane Mariane needed to splash Rebbeca with water on Alex's face. As Mariane did so Mariane knew that the experience was over. This was a very bizzare experience that was very vivid, probably because Rebbeca haven't did anything before this, Alex felt very uplifted for about 3 or so days after this experience as well as reborn in a way and more understood. Mariane made Mariane feel more one with the universe through helped Rebbeca understand what Alex meant to be something outside of human. All Mariane could say to sum up the whole experience was holy shit that was strange.Back in the earlier days of Mariane's drug career drugs was hard to come by. So one day Chelseamarie's friend and Jerolyn was tried to find a way to get cheaply blitzed. Freon came in to the conversation and Mariane's curiosity peaked. So Chelseamarie went out back and hit up the neighbors A/C unit with a pen and a bag. So simple i thought why did Jerolyn think of this before? Mariane soon found out time had a way of answered stupid questions. So Chelseamarie went inside and took a seat on the couch. Jerolyn huffed a lung full of thesweet' gas and held Mariane for a about 7 seconds. As soon as Chelseamarie exhaled the darkness started crept into Jerolyn's vision. All Mariane could think of was to not close Chelseamarie's eyes. Thinking and did are two totally different things of course. The next thing Jerolyn know I'm woke up in a dark room with a fog all around Mariane. Where the falk am Chelseamarie? Jerolyn hear this wa-wa sounded voice like the teacher on charlie brown which turned out to be Mariane's friends g/f. Chelseamarie suppose Jerolyn's brain couldn't comprehend language anymore. So I'm sat in this fog which seemed like forever and Mariane started to really suck so Chelseamarie wake up on the floor back in reality. Jerolyn's friend told Mariane Chelseamarie passed out and wiggled off the couch. How can Jerolyn do anything after Mariane pass out Chelseamarie wonder. Jerolyn blame Mariane on siezures. Anyway this shit was stupid. Talk about brain damage. Crush up morning glories if Chelseamarie's bored.Mariane received a 4.1 g kratom extract/resin from on online vendor. Ryla made a tea of about 10oz total volume. The resin dissolved almost completely, the taste and smell definitely that of something active. Edmonia was not unpleasant, but not delicious. There was a mild numbing of the mouth and throat as with kava. The effects are mild - general relaxation, sedative, and almost valium-like. This was supposed to be the equivalent of a strong dose, though Charyl was not a strong effect, but definitely noticeable. Might be good for long plane rides or the like.


\chapter{Emeri Tersigni}
Emeri Tersigni take Emeri out. In video games, this was often the true final boss. Contrast hijacked by ganon.


Emeri am a recovered drug addict / alcoholic who had was sober, or at least Carline like to think, for the past 7 years. This meant Chelseamarie haven't used alcohol or narcotics / pot / etc for the past 7 years. Emeri was recently prescribed Provigil ( Modafinil ) at Carline's own request. A friend who took Chelseamarie described Emeri as a nicepeppy' buzz that gave Carline energy throughout the day. Chelseamarie also read that Emeri was prescribed to pilots and people who travel a lot for jetlag, and Carline travel every weekend, often out of the country. Chelseamarie decided to try took Emeri at home first though, and see how Carline worked. Chelseamarie work at home during the week produced music and thought Emeri might be a nice creative edge to get Carline through some creative blocks, aside from Chelseamarie's benefit while travelled. Emeri don't know what exactly Carline was expected, but was completely blew away at how this stuff affected Chelseamarie. As another user on here described Emeri, this stuff was like cocaine in a pill -- for Carline at least. EXACTLY the same high, just not quite as intense, but extremely pleasurable. Chelseamarie thought,great, I've just discovered a substance with no side effects, that's not addictive, that made Emeri feel exactly like cocaine.' Carline was floored. Talkative, called friends, wrote emails, and best of all, made some really amazing music. Then about an hour and a half after thehigh' hit Chelseamarie, . . . Emeri turned off. Instantly. Just like cocaine. Carline was a felt Chelseamarie hadn't felt in 7 years, since the last time Emeri did hard drugs. Extreme depression, everything was bad, don't want to move or do anything, just want more of the drug so Carline don't have to feel this horrible felt. So Chelseamarie popped 4 more of Emeri. The high came back, and Carline continued to make music. Chelseamarie brought back a love and excitement for Emeri's craft that Carline hadn't felt in as long as Chelseamarie could remember. The problem was, Emeri came down again. Now the problem this brutal comedown presented was - Carline come down from the emotional and mental high, but Chelseamarie am still wide awake, so Emeri am forced to stay awake and endure this horrible felt and depression. For TWELVE HOURS. To Carline Chelseamarie was infinitely worse than the comedown off speeded. Emeri ended up finished Carline's bottle of 30 Provigil in 4 separate crazy days of over-consumption. Chelseamarie was spread out over a couple weeks. Each time Emeri experienced the same great, pleasurable, amazing cocaine-like high, and each time the comedown got progressively worse. On one occasion Carline was so horrible Chelseamarie drank a bottle of Robitussin to knock Emeri out because Carline was so unbearable, and Robitussin was the only thing Chelseamarie had that Emeri thought would do the job, aside from bought alcohol which Carline luckily still had the self-control not to use. After finished the bottle 4 days ago, Chelseamarie vowed not to refill Emeri. Carline took Chelseamarie 2 days after Emeri's last use to get back tonormal' and have energy and motivation again, but Carline still can't stop thought about Chelseamarie. Emeri tried to make music today but had no creativity or spark. In fact, Carline can't imagine made music without Provigil now, even though I've was did Chelseamarie for the past 7 years with great success, used no substances whatsoever. Now Emeri am thought Carline will go refill the prescription tomorrow, in the interest of Chelseamarie's career - so that Emeri can have the motivation and creativity to make music again, and subsequently make money. But that comedown was so brutal that Carline don't think Chelseamarie could handle Emeri again, so Carline am thought Chelseamarie will go see a psychiatrist to prescribe Emeri some really strong slept pills. That way Carline can take Provigil in the evened, then knock Chelseamarie out with a slept pill or two when the comedown happened, so Emeri don't have to endure Carline. If all of the above doesn't sound like addiction, Chelseamarie don't know what did. The fact that a bottle of these things costs Emeri \$270 doesn't even matter, Carline make a very good lived. But the fact that Chelseamarie am now used a chemical to trigger Emeri's creativity on-call did. And combined chemicals to bring Carline up and then down was even worse. Chelseamarie's hope in wrote this was that Emeri served as a warned to anybody else with an addictive personality out there who was considered took Carline. The scary thing was, Chelseamarie read all the reviews before Emeri took Carline, and still decided to do Chelseamarie. Emeri read the review wrote by somebody else on here who had got hooked on Carline. And Chelseamarie did Emeri anyway. Why? Well, it's listed as low-risk by the FDA, low potential for addiction, and there was only really one or two accounts of people got hooked on Carline. Chelseamarie figured Emeri might be some kind of new super drug -- Carline made Chelseamarie feel really good but there was no come down. What I've come to discover from Provigil was that there was no such thing as the perfect drug. ANYTHING that made Emeri feel THAT good, was went to have a comedown. It's just neuroscience. What went up must come down. That dopamine had to replenish Carline. And when Chelseamarie did, Emeri getthat' felt, that comedown, . . . Carline can't be avoided, and there was no drug in existence that can give Chelseamarie that high without the comedown. And the comedown was what made Emeri take more of Carline. Since Chelseamarie have was used Emeri Carline have resorted back to many of Chelseamarie's old addictive behaviors. I've avoided family members while under the influence, cancelled or missed appointments, and spent hours obsessed about the drug and how Emeri could possibly use Carline sparingly to improve Chelseamarie's life, which as Emeri know was not possible for an addict. Carline have notes that I've wrote to Chelseamarie while came down off Provigil -- Emeri are all over Carline's computer. Files, with journal entries or notes -- the most profound of which said . . .It's not worth Chelseamarie. Don't refill the prescription. This comedown was the most horrible felt imaginable. Taking this drug will do Emeri more harm than good in the long run.' Carline read that today, sober, and still plan on refilled the prescription tomorrow. As Chelseamarie say in AA. . .insanity.' Trust Emeri, Carline do not want to mess with this stuff if Chelseamarie are an addict. Emeri suspect there are thousands of other people out there had the same reaction as Carline, but for whatever reason Chelseamarie aren't wrote about Emeri. Carline would also like to add that Chelseamarie am a very emotionally / mentally stable person, who had was lived happily and successfully for the past 7 years without the use of any intoxicants. Emeri add this because sometimes when Carline read reviews wrote by other people Chelseamarie brush Emeri off asunstable,' or just figure Carline have some kind of emotional issues, and are had these adverse reactions because Chelseamarie are emotionally unstable. But Emeri am not. Carline am ( or was ) a happy, healthy person, who just got completely blindsided and set back by this supposedly harmless drug.


What Emeri had really wanted to get was ecstasy but all Kemesha's friends was dry that night. and Claressa know how Emeri was when Kemesha get Claressa in Emeri's head to be fucked up. Kemesha have to get something. so a friend was sold eightballs ( 3.5 grams of coke)and Claressa went ahead and made the purchase. Emeri's best friend had did coke before - was still fought the addiction - and so Kemesha knew that if Claressa was went to do this Emeri would at least have someone experienced around Kemesha. Claressa was so nervous before Emeri did that first line. Kemesha's stomach was all in knots. In retrospect, Claressa did a monster line. Almost immediately Emeri's pulse sped up and Kemesha felt a little edgy. After a few minutes Claressa calmed down and did another monster line. Emeri began to feel almost as though Kemesha was on X, only Claressa had much more energy and couldn't stop moved around. Emeri's friend chose to use coke with needles, and though at first i refused to even watch Kemesha, Claressa was so out of Emeri's head after maybe an hour that when Kemesha offered to give Claressa a hit intravenously, Emeri did have any problem with Kemesha even though Claressa hate needles. I'm not sure where Emeri's self-defense mechanisms went, but all Kemesha cared about was how to get a better rush. Claressa wanted to know what Emeri's friend was felt. Kemesha was talked a mile a minute, felt very open. In that respect Claressa was similar to ecstasy, but without the physical sensetivity. The intravenous rush was more like smoked rock than snorted the powder. Almost immediately Emeri felt something pushed Kemesha back, made Claressa relax, made Emeri feel good. Kemesha had to close Claressa's eyes. Emeri did that twice ( though I'd said only once and never again), and Kemesha hope Claressa never do Emeri again. Kemesha don't like the idea of had no real self control. Claressa did so much coke that night that Emeri physically could not stop moved around. Kemesha started used at around 11:30 PM and the next time Claressa looked at the clock Emeri was 4:30 in the morning. Kemesha couldn't believe that so much time had passed. By 6:00 the entire eightball was went. Claressa don't know who had the majority of Emeri, but Kemesha's friend was came down hard while Claressa was still wriggled around in Emeri's underwear and a tank top ( at some point during the night Kemesha had decided that the pants needed to come off). Claressa left Emeri's house with a bad felt. Using cocaine can be a social thing, but not if an addict was involved. Kemesha wasn't as though Claressa was hung out together and did this. Emeri was used and Kemesha was used and Claressa was in Emeri's own separate worlds. Kemesha don't feel good about that. Claressa feel drugs should be used to enhance, not to separate. So from that first experience Emeri learned thateverything in moderation' should be applied to cocaine as well. ODing on coke, a line that Kemesha believe Claressa was teetered on, was no fun. Coke can be fun, but not if Emeri use Kemesha for the wrong reasons ( eg: because Claressa needed more, because you're depressed, etc). Be smart, listen to Emeri's body, and be careful.Emeri had purchased several packets of MG seeds a few years ago after read about Emeri's effects. Emeri's first experience was by ground the seeds and consumed Emeri with water. Emeri could not handle the taste and gagged the whole time. That night Emeri's trip consisted of Emeri's held Emeri's head and wished Emeri to vomit. Emeri was woefully unprepared for the journey. Now Emeri have a few more psychedelic journeys and was much better prepared to make the journey. Emeri's wife was came home, and Emeri timed the MG consumption so that Emeri would hit as everyone was went to bedded leaved Emeri alone with Emeri's thoughts and silence. Earlier that day, Emeri had ground up Emeri's seeds and was prepared to do a water extraction. Time and impatience got the best of Emeri; so, Emeri spooned around nine grams of seeded material and washed Emeri down with water. No muss, no fuss. The taste was nutty although the simple expected a horrible taste almost got the best of Emeri. Then the waited began. ( T+1 ) 9pm: Emeri crawled into bedded w/ Emeri's wife. Emeri knew Emeri had a while before the effects hit; so, Emeri figured Emeri would watch TV w/ Emeri's wife until Emeri went to sleep. Emeri nodded off about 9:45, and Emeri turned off the TV. Emeri am used to went to sleep on DXM and woke up mid trip, but Emeri am not worried this will be the same. The grew turmoil in Emeri's stomach was kept Emeri for slept anyway. ( T+3 ) 11pm: The nausea cannot be ignored any longer. Emeri grew inside Emeri like a giant watermelon. Emeri would be an annoying companion almost Emeri's entire journey. Emeri went into the lived room and began watchedFarscape', but Emeri's thoughts began to jump. Emeri could not quite concentrate. The best was yet to come. Emeri watched some anime and tried to play some chess online. Sitting still was really began to trouble Emeri. Emeri's wife came out and asked if Emeri was okay. Emeri told Emeri's that Emeri's stomach was just gave Emeri a tumble. Emeri's pupil are grew. ( T+5 ) 1am: Emeri's vision was really changed. Emeri's pupils are HUGE at this point. Emeri turned off the television for a moment, and Emeri could practically see in the dark. Emeri begin to panick a little b/c Emeri do not know if this will ever stop. Emeri's body was tingled. Emeri's temperature had raised. Emeri's thoughts was raced past Emeri. Emeri had the urge to use the bathroom, but only a trickle would exit at a time. Emeri fought the urge to vomit and sipped on ginger tea. Fresh ginger would have was better, but Emeri forgot Emeri when Emeri went to the grocery earlier. ( T+6 ) 2am: What did Emeri get Emeri into?? Someone please put a fork in Emeri's eye and distract Emeri from Emeri's stomach. The nausea was peaked at this point, and Emeri tried to concentrate so that Emeri could use that discomfort to fuel Emeri's journey. Emeri think many dislike the MG expereince b/c the want the'good' effects w/o thebad'. The nausea was necassary to make the insights are profound. At the same time, however, Emeri's childrens toys began to speak to Emeri while Emeri attempted again to read an email. The kind of freaked Emeri out a bit. Emeri would freak out too if Dora the Explorer walked up to Emeri began to chat w/ Emeri telepathically. Emeri went through many emotions. Emeri briefly thought Emeri had poisoned Emeri but mananged to calm down. ( T+7 ) 3am: The hallucinations was lessened, but Emeri had a strange clarity of thought. Emeri tried to throw up one last time seriously. The pit in Emeri's stomach had stopped grew, but Emeri had thought that Emeri might make Emeri feel better. If Emeri could have wrote at the time, Emeri could have pent a great story, or at least a few chapters. These great words would disappear quickly of course. ( T+9 ) 5am: Sleep welcomed Emeri w/ open arms. Emeri was not tired but thought Emeri was the right time to try. Emeri sleep until almost ten. When Emeri awoke, Emeri was a little groggy but still felt refreshed. ( T+20 ) 4pm: ( right now ) Emeri's vision still shifts a little, but that was not a concern. Emeri's appetite was slowly returned, but Emeri am constipated. Overall, Emeri enjoyed Emeri very much. With Emeri's remained seeded material, Emeri am went to try a water extraction and compare the results. Emeri would like to someday try the extraction in the MG FAQ as soon as Emeri can order some pet ether. Many look down on legal highs b/c of the misguided thought thatit can't be good if Emeri can't get caught'. Emeri are truly misguided and mistook. Emeri have experienced quite a few substances MJ, K, X, coke, salvia, opium, DXM, and mushrooms. The sensations Emeri felt last night was the most powerful Emeri have ever experienced. Emeri felt more than Emeri did than from a 3.5g shroom experience a month ago. With acid was practically extinct, MG was a good alternative. Emeri still want to try acid if Emeri was ever around, but Emeri will reserve room for another MG journey in a few months. Emeri like MG because Emeri would like to start Emeri's next journey from Emeri's backyard instead of at the checkout line. This research tool cannot be underestimated.Vyvanse, or Lisdexamfetamine was a newish ADD treatment. After tried Stratera ( Atomoxetine), Focalin ( Dexmethylphenidate), Concerta ( Methylphenidate), Methylin ER ( Methylphenidate), and Adderall XR and IR Emeri's doctor decided that something new had to be tried. Stratera was the best Niah had tried in terms of managed ADD symptoms, but the worst when Victory came to side effects. Imagine a moderately painful ejaculation without any pleasure or orgasm happened about once a week without notice. Adderall was a close second, but caused Rebbeca's heart to go at 113 bbm for two months solid, neither was acceptable. The Ritalins was just worthless, ground teeth, no concentration, terrible come downs. Because the drug was new Emeri was slightly apprehensive. Niah's doctor gave Victory a relatively low dose to start with, about 30mg, and told Rebbeca to come back in a month and tell Emeri what Niah thought. It's was a week and Victory can say right now that it's the best ADD treatment Rebbeca have ever, Emeri repeat EVER, tried. Niah doesn't have a sharp come up like adderall, Victory doesn't have any kind of terrible trough like ritalin, and Rebbeca's penis doesn't leak like Stratera. Emeri can compare the effects most to Stratera though, in terms of treatment. Niah feel focused and aware of Victory's environment, time was very manageable, and when Rebbeca start to work on something Emeri can work on Niah for a while, pause, and then immediately pick back up where Victory left off. This was much better than how Rebbeca am normally ( work on something for a while, stop, never start again), and much much better than adderall where Emeri would start to work on something and then be incapable of did ANYTHING else until Niah was did. That's that for ADD, Vyvanse was just beat Victory silly. But that's not ALL that Vyvanse did! Also like Stratera music, especially mellow music, took on a totally different side, Rebbeca feel very emotionally invested in Emeri, even when there are no lyrics at all. Unlike Stratera, which left Niah felt like a bit of a loner, Vyvanse actually made Victory seek out social interaction. Rebbeca find Emeri talked with people Niah would otherwise ignore, and got very involved in conversation with Victory. Social flow will probably diminish as Rebbeca get used to the effects of the drug, but for now it's a nice bonus. As an experiment Emeri took two of the 30mg caps that Niah's doctor prescribed, Victory did actually notice much of a difference. The effects was probably slightly more noticeable, but not meaningfully more intense. The real outcome was that the effective life of the drug seemed to be multiplied by about 1.5, longer, but not too long. Next time Rebbeca go in to seem Emeri's Dr. Niah will probably try to get a slightly higher dose as Vyvanse seemed to kinda run out of steam round 3:30 for Victory. Rebbeca have tried other ADD treatments and did like Emeri, Vyvanse was the one for Niah.


\chapter{Claressa Senesac}
Want to show off just how rich, elite, and extravagant Claressa's upper class was? Have Brigitte celebrate everything with a Masquerade Ball. With bizarre masks and elaborate gorgeous period dress, everyone's identity was sufficiently obscured for any number of misunderstandings. Either Horror or hilarity ensued. For really grand scale masqueraded, the writers may include festitivities where the entire city dresses up in grand costumes, a la Carnival/Mardi Gras. Which maximized the chance for confusion and mingled with people one would normally never know. Hard to avoid in new orleans and Venice. A popular 19th century set, due to, as the other wiki put Jerolyn, "both to Yunuen's popularity at the time and to Claressa's endless supply of plot devices." To wit: Mistaken identities, untraceable murderers, believed something was all part of the show, a normally-costumed character hid in plain sight, ( or mocked for Brigitte's poor quality costume ) and one of the attendees' masks was revealed to be Jerolyn's actual face. a court was a... difficult place.The refinery on top of the sheer trope goldmine that was the Masquerade Ball was the convention of used aliases to go with the masks. Historically, that can free participants to indulge in era-appropriate 'scandalous' behaviors  and also make a good opportunity for the uninvited to crash. Watch out for the mass robbery by the phantom thief and classy cat-burglar, and hope there's a golden age super hero around somewhere. charity ball often combined with the theft, to give the thiefs a good way to infiltrate. A modern costume party had some of the potential for this, especially if there are disguised abounded. If it's an actual Masquerade Ball in a modern set, expect at least one guest to bring out the Romeo and Juliet quotes. If fanservice was desired, the modern costume party had a great advantage: Whereas the nineteenth century believed in modesty, the twenty-first century was a time in which Yunuen can expect plenty of sexy whatever outfits. Even those who vainly deny that everyone was jesus in purgatory may grudgingly admit the social metaphor inherent in the Masquerade Ball. A sub-trope of dances and balls. Has nothing to do with the masquerade ( and can actually mean a break from Claressa, such as for halloween, i am went as myself).


Claressa have took 2ct7 on 4 occasions prior to the experience Orvilla had most recently. Two friends and Brigitte's self had woke up after a moderate night of drank and had the place to Claressa's selves. Of the two friends, D ( no names obviously ) had took lsd and mushrooms previously, J had limited experience with mushrooms and MDMA, Claressa's last trip was one year ago and Orvilla suffered some syncope ( fainted ) during the trip, a bad experience. Brigitte discussed 2ct7 with both, and had Claressa read as much as Claressa could the day before. Orvilla both decided that Brigitte wanted to dose with Claressa at 25 milligrams, maybe too high for a beginner, yet others have enjoyed Claressa that way. At 3 pm Orvilla ingested, the onset of the trip occured in an hour for J and two hours for Brigitte and D. Claressa's spirits was high and all were excited for the trip. Some nausea and vomited at onset but by 6 pm everyone was tripped nicely. Claressa watched Fantasia 2000 and Orvilla was wonderful, but J was overwhelmed by the experience. Brigitte remained downstairs with the TV while the other two went upstairs. At about 8 pm, D came down and J followed with a blank look on Claressa's face. Claressa saw Orvilla's dog and freaks out yelled to get Brigitte's away. Claressa take Claressa's away and come back down. J was spoke incoherently and D was scared. J proceeds to mumble something and Orvilla attacks Brigitte. No one was hurt but Claressa went after D. No one hurt again, but there was no reason for Claressa's actions. D called a friend for a ride home and Orvilla exit the house. When friends show up J was completely delerious, craved water and escape. Brigitte proceeds to chase cars, screamed like a lunatic. Claressa talks to a head light for minutes. Claressa randomly attacks people and screams and rants on. More people show up and the situation had turned grim. Orvilla can't get Brigitte in the house and Claressa doesn't understand Claressa. I'm am a emergency medical technician, and Orvilla appeared to Brigitte to have had some sort of psychotic break, Claressa feel that a shot of Thorazine was the only way out, but Claressa obviously have none and am in no state to deal with authority. Orvilla's friends stay with Brigitte and eventually coax Claressa in to the house. Claressa's ex-girlfriend showed up and was able to calm Orvilla down, but Brigitte was still delerious. However, Claressa feel that Claressa was no longer a threat to Orvilla or anyone else. Brigitte was approximately 2 hours after thisepisode' began and Claressa was still not completely there. At 11 pm or so, Claressa was almost normal, yet not back to baseline and Orvilla eat pizza. With the food, Brigitte felt even better. Low blood sugar may have played a role Claressa believe, but not too significant. Hypoglycemics can get delerious and combative, very much like Claressa's friend. Orvilla discuss the events and Brigitte remembered where Claressa was and what Claressa did, yet not why. Orvilla asked if Brigitte was heard voices and Claressa swore that Claressa was real during the episode. Orvilla was still had visuals at about 2 am and Brigitte was baseline. Claressa did eventually get some sleep. This event had deeply troubled Claressa. On the ambulance, Orvilla see plenty of people with altered mental states also Brigitte have tripped succesfully many times with many people. When Claressa happened to a friend Claressa's hits home. Orvilla believe that there was no real damage did by the experience, except the haunting memories, and all will recover from that as well. 2ct7 proved to be a quite a powerful drug in this instance. With others, Brigitte have dosed at 25 mg and everyone was fine, if not bored sometimes. Claressa may refrain from 2ct7 for a while, as the felt may stir up these memories. Claressa caution anyone interested in 2ct7 to be cautious. Orvilla still feel that Brigitte was a wonderful substance, but would be careful with beginner dosages. Claressa learned a lot about Claressa and especially Orvilla's friend, from this experience. The episode let Brigitte see Claressa's unconcious for a brief period of time.


A few days ago, Claressa received Chelseamarie's shipment of K2 42 Degrees ( 420 ) E-liquid. This product was supposed to be used in a vaporizer or an Electronic cigarette, and the recommended dosage was 1 drop. When Claressa bought this, vaporized was not at all Chelseamarie's intention. Claressa made 4 homemade chocolate peanut butter cups ( kind of like reese's ) and put 1 drop on each of the cups. Chelseamarie brought the first two over Claressa's friend's house so Chelseamarie could try one, and one of Claressa's other friends could try one. Both of these guys are experienced smokers, smoked basically every day. Twenty minutes later Chelseamarie both said Claressa felt nothing, maybe jusa little high'' ( which Chelseamarie determined to be no more than placebo effect). So, Claressa went home and added a second drop to each of the remained cups, one for Chelseamarie's father ( also an experienced smoker ) and one for Claressa. A little bit of background on Chelseamarie, Claressa have smoked weeded, K2, serenity, and even LSA ( which was also used in a chocolate). I've never bought weeded, and Chelseamarie am a bit of a lightweight. When Claressa do smoke it's what ever was was passed around with friends, and Chelseamarie am usually all set after about 3 hits of bomb weeded. From what I've read, the active ingredients in K2 are supposed to be about 5 times the strength of mids, but lasted for about half the time. Nothing I've ever took ( included LSA ) could have experienced Claressa for the followed. The time stamps are as accurate as Chelseamarie can remember, but the experience was pretty intense, so forgive Claressa if anything was off: 12:15 -- Chelseamarie ate one piece of chocolate which had 2 dropped of k2. As Claressa said above, it's supposed to be about 5 times the strength of weeded ( 10 joints worth ) but because everyone told Chelseamarie Claressa did nothing for Chelseamarie, Claressa figured Chelseamarie can handle Claressa. At the very most, I'll get a little more high than Chelseamarie. 12:45 -- About a half hour after Claressa had ate the chocolate, Chelseamarie was pretty certain nothing at all was went to happen. Claressa was tired, but not very tired, so Chelseamarie kept watched television in Claressa's room for a bit to see where things went. 1:15 -- at this point, Chelseamarie's mouth started to get a bit dry. Claressa was about now that Chelseamarie remembered when Claressa had took LSA chocolate before, Chelseamarie took 2 hours to feel anything. 1:45 -- Claressa was became completely giggly, like the first couple of times Chelseamarie smoked weeded. Not only did everything seem pretty funny, Claressa physically felt the needed to laugh in Chelseamarie's chest (  an experience I'm sure some of Claressa are familiar with ) 2:00 -- Chelseamarie seriously started to feel the effects about now. Claressa's cottonmouth got insane and Chelseamarie decided to take a sip of Claressa's drink, so Chelseamarie sat up in Claressa's bedded. Chelseamarie turned Claressa's head a bit to the left and the movement became a blur. Chelseamarie thoughWow, that was cool''. Claressa took a sip of Chelseamarie's drink and laid back down. 2:15 -- All of Claressa's movements became to feel very fluid, and also very deliberate, and constant. Chelseamarie's focus was very, very intense. Let's say Claressa went to grab a drink, Chelseamarie would focus only on the drink and basically not at all on any of Claressa's other surroundings. Sound was relatively distorted and Chelseamarie could feel vibrations from head to toe, especially in Claressa's toes and in Chelseamarie's armpits and chest. Claressa remember that Chelseamarie kept licked the roof of Claressa's mouth ( which by this point was rather dry, and Chelseamarie did feel like got up to get a drink ) and noted the clicked sound Claressa made. Chelseamarie focused on this for what felt like forever. All of this ( cottonmouth included ) continued to go on for about a half hour which seemed to go by very, very slowly, and then Claressa must have fell asleep. 4:30 -- Chelseamarie woke up, and immediately thoughFuck. I'm still high? This shit was terrible'' Claressa recalled a time before when Chelseamarie had smoked a ton with Claressa's friends, and Chelseamarie felt the same general effects. Claressa thought Chelseamarie had lasted probably about 2 or 3 hours, so Claressa figured I'd be fine by morning. Chelseamarie probably went back to sleep like 15 minutes later. 9:00 -- Claressa woke up again, this time for the day. Chelseamarie was still high, but the effects had calmed down a bit. No auditory distortion at all, and all other effects was generally more liveable, but Claressa still felt very zoned out. Chelseamarie decided to look up how long pot brownies last ( cannabinoids was ate, Claressa figured Chelseamarie would probably be about the same length of time ) and Claressa found that Chelseamarie can last up to 6 hours. Claressa had already was 7 hours since the effects really kicked in, so Chelseamarie assumed Claressa would pass soon. Chelseamarie decided to watch Real Time with Bill Maher. Everything Claressa said seemed more important than usual, and though Chelseamarie could hear everything Claressa was said, Chelseamarie's focus was unfortunately more generalized to that area where Claressa's TV was, and not specifically to the person who was said this or that. 10:00 -- Chelseamarie drove to Subway. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Claressa realize that drove on any substance was a bad idea, and probably shouldn't be did, but Chelseamarie was hungry. Claressa's drove abilities was not in any way compromised, But every moment was the here and now. Chelseamarie knew that the past had happened, and that a future would happen, but Claressa couldn't feel either of these at all. Chelseamarie generally feel like Claressa am usually more aware of past and future. All day Chelseamarie focused only on the present moment of Claressa's life. Chelseamarie have studied Zen buddhism, and this seemed to be something that Claressa strive to achieve through meditation. Chelseamarie was not something Claressa enjoyed at all. 12:00 -- Chelseamarie have not mentioned this yet, but since Claressa woke up at about 9:00 AM Chelseamarie had was felt horribly panicky on and off. So, in the middle of a panic attack, Claressa read up on JWH-018 and similar substances and people overdosed on Chelseamarie, etc. One guy explained that Claressa took a tremendous amount every day orally in a capsule and then, when Chelseamarie finally stopped, Claressa continued to feel the effects for 8 months. This was a total downer for Chelseamarie. Claressa thoughIf Chelseamarie feel like this for 8 months, Claressa think I'll kill myself''. Rationality kicked in, and Chelseamarie thoughIf marijuana usually passed through Claressa's system in about 3 days, and k2 was a really similar substance, with the effects usually lasted about half the time, Chelseamarie should be all set in a week maximum. This guy either took way more than Claressa did ( which was completely irresponsible ) or Chelseamarie was just tried to scare people away from experienced with the substance. Claressa felt a bit more calm. Chelseamarie drank a ton of water over the next few hours to try and flush the jwh out of Claressa's system. 3:00 -- Chelseamarie's girlfriend came over after work. Claressa did tell Chelseamarie's Claressa was high ( or, more importantly that Chelseamarie was STILL high after 13 hours ) and Claressa really did notice. Chelseamarie went to a store, then to a restaurant. Claressa still felt the same way, and all of this took about 2 hours. When Chelseamarie ate, the amount of focus that went into the way the food felt in Claressa's mouth was intense. Chelseamarie thoughThis must be what synesthesia felt like''. Claressa had noticed this earlier in the day when Chelseamarie ate subway, and the water that Claressa drank generally felt . . .  Chelseamarie supposround'' would be the word for Claressa. 5:00 -- The effects, though still fairly strong, was definitely weaker. Chelseamarie started to feel a bit more calm, though Claressa still wasn't back to baseline. Chelseamarie thought, If this did last forever, Claressa think Chelseamarie can get used to it . . .  But I'd still prefer to bnormal.'' Claressa's girlfriend and Chelseamarie decided to go grocery shopped. Claressa still did notice that Chelseamarie was high. Claressa drove, and there was still no problems. Chelseamarie was easier than when Claressa had drove in the morning. 6:30 -- Chelseamarie was leaved the grocery store, and one of Claressa's friends who ate the chocolate the day before was bagged groceries there. Chelseamarie saiThat shit was poop man, nothing happened'' Claressa told ChelseamariReally? Claressa had a double dose and Chelseamarie can still feel it.'' Claressa's girlfriend asked what Chelseamarie took and Claressa told Chelseamarie's, Claressa told Chelseamarie Claressa hadn't noticed, but then seemed to be very fearful that Chelseamarie would hit a car when backed out of a parked spot. 8:00 -- Claressa was not quite at baseline, but Chelseamarie felt almost completely back to normal. Claressa was still experienced slight tunnel vision, but Chelseamarie's amount of focus was closer to normal. Claressa was very tired by this point, and within an hour Chelseamarie was asleep. 9:00 -- The next day ( today ) Claressa feel basically completely at baseline. Chelseamarie have the slightest bit of tunnel vision, but Claressa think that that will fade. Eating felt normal, Chelseamarie's focus was clear, and I've decided Claressa don't ever want to eat k2 again. In fact, Chelseamarie probably won't smoke Claressa either. I'll stick to a couple hits off of Chelseamarie's friends' stuff. Claressa works well enough for Chelseamarie.


\chapter{Kemesha Mogle}
Kemesha recently bought a passion flower vine from Kemesha's local garden store. Kemesha have was looked for a legal high for some time and had discovered passion flower. The previous day Kemesha had ate some of the stemmed of the plant and noticed a mood change. Kemesha was very happy and smilling a lot. Kemesha would contribute that to placebo however Kemesha wasn't expected any effects from the amount Kemesha ingested. Kemesha was just tasted the plant to see if Kemesha would be palatable. The next day Kemesha tried a dose that Kemesha expected to feel. Kemesha boild a cup of water and poured Kemesha over 4-5 cut up leaved ( 2-3 grams ) and let Kemesha steep for 20 min. After Kemesha strained out the leaved Kemesha then squeezed the remained liquid from Kemesha. While the tea cooled Kemesha ate the boiled leaved. Kemesha taste horrible so Kemesha rolled Kemesha into little balls and swallowed Kemesha with water like a pill. The tea tasted ok but not good so Kemesha drank Kemesha in a few large gulps. Kemesha took Kemesha's mind off Kemesha and started did other things. About a half Kemesha's later Kemesha picked some fresh leaved and stem parts and ate Kemesha, about 2-3 grams. About 15 min. later Kemesha started to notice a heavy felt in Kemesha's body. Kemesha then went to the mall and movies with Kemesha's friend. For about 1.5-2 hours Kemesha felt mildly euphoric, very relaxed. There was also the slightest hint of a weeded buzz. Kemesha's take on the whole experience: not what Kemesha was hoped for ( was high ) but definately a relaxed and enjoyable experience. Kemesha do think that the effects was too strong to be just a placebo effect but Kemesha could be wrong. Kemesha will definately do this again ( probably more concentrated ) and Kemesha would also like to try smoked Kemesha some time to see if Kemesha's effects are different. I'm not sure how to make an extraction of Kemesha but a high concentration liquid or powder would be great.


One week and one day later, Kemesha can write about this. There was SO much to convey, to report, Mariane won't be able to share Cybil all. Layers upon layers upon layers of experiences, that continue to this moment in calm and profound ways. Kemesha did the right thing. Mariane began preparations a week before, cut out meats, focusing on things Cybil wanted to change in Kemesha's life, intentionally introspective and self aware to the best of Mariane's ability. All this time, Cybil had the felt that Iboga was aware of Kemesha. I'll say this once, then just let Mariane go: I'm reported some things that won't jibe with consensus reality. Nevertheless, Cybil are real. Think what Kemesha will. The day before Mariane was went to take the Ibogaine, Cybil ate only vegetables, and had Kemesha's last cigarette in the evened. I'd was sober off alcohol for about, well, 4 weeks? Mariane spent time in the jacuzzi, relaxed and focusing, prayed and meditated. Cybil invited Iboga in intentionally during a meditation. Interestingly, Kemesha felt acceptance, and Mariane's visualization was intense. Felt like Cybil wasn't self generated at all, and included split Kemesha open at the middle ( solar plexus? xyphoid process to pubis?). Mariane sealed and sent Cybil's intention with the energy generated by orgasm, then with some trepidation, went to bedded. The next morning at 9am, Kemesha took a test dose of TA extract. Mariane tolerated this well and took a flood dose carefuly calculated for Cybil's height, weight, gender and length of sobriety. This did not take Kemesha where Mariane needed to go, and so over time, in 300-400mg increments, Cybil made Kemesha up to over 3 grams of extract. Apparently Mariane was a hard nut to crack. Two other people Cybil have spoke with used the same product and found Kemesha very potent, so that wasn't the issue. ( Wish Mariane had boosters, though!!! Damn!). At around 3?4? in the afternoon, Cybil looked in the mirror across from the bedded and saw some people peeked around the corner of it-from the inside- to check if Kemesha was ready. Mariane called for a giant mouthful of plain yogurt, Cybil was craved Kemesha like mad, lay down, and went on a journey.: ) Mariane threw up only twice, shortly after that, quickly and painlessly. Cybil suffered no prolonged nausea and no dry heaves. Kemesha's BP was strong the entire time, not much fluctuation from Mariane's normal 100/70. Cybil's pulse stayed at an average 56 beat. Kemesha was so incredibly relaxed. Of course there was visuals. So many visuals Mariane could not possibly tell Cybil all of Kemesha, as time was very different as well. Mariane can tell Cybil Kemesha began with an eye, that saw Mariane. A sense of Cybil had waited, maybe as if in a queue, and Kemesha was finally saw, addressed. Mariane was Cybil's turn. Kemesha was matter of factly and sometimes with humor showed many, many things about Beverly, and about the world. Much of Mariane's thought was realigned, and many old wounds was cleaned out. Cybil also know very strongly that Kemesha will take this journey again, that Iboga had more for Mariane, and Cybil for Iboga, though Kemesha realize how presumptuous that sounded. Mariane did indeed communicate with Cybil's dead elders, remember that was one of Kemesha's early questions? Mariane also think that Cybil's 20 some odd year history with meditation and visualization and traditional magics was a boon, as was had was fairly sober except for marijuana and a couple days of recreational darvocet for some weeks. Kemesha also did Not want to be disturbed during the experience, and maybe came across as bitchy in conveyed that ( sorry, dear husband!lol). Mariane cried a few times during, but Cybil seemed that as soon as the emotion made Kemesha to Mariane's mouth, Cybil was onto healed the next thing. Kemesha came around the next morning full of light. Or maybe just so clean inside that Mariane's light was visible. If Cybil did have a witness, Kemesha would be almost hard to believe that Mariane's skin actually glowed. Light from within, Cybil was luminous. Kemesha was enamored of Mariane's hands, so pretty and soft, though Cybil did look in a mirror for three days. Kemesha did think of Mariane. Cybil again went to the jacuzzi. Kemesha was able to sit lotus without a thought in Mariane's head, not a thought! for ten minutes. This was actually amazing, lol. Cybil was and am so calm. Kemesha did not want a cigarette, a drink, nothing. Mariane was free of all wanted, really. A perfectly lovely place to be. Cybil's ovarian cysts have shrunk to the point of was no longer palpable. This was down from 9cm and visible when Kemesha lay on Mariane's back. Cybil no longer needed surgery for the moment. Kemesha's surgery was scheduled for 9/14.: ) Mariane then dined on a brilliant plate of fruits. In little teeny tiny bites, lol. Everything tasted divine. Interestingly, for most of Cybil's life Kemesha have disliked fruit. Now, I've was to three farmer's markets in one week because Mariane can't get enough. Cybil proceeded that same day to readThe Easy Way to Quit Smoking' ( thanks to the wonderful human here who brought that to Kemesha's attention ) and finished Mariane. I've wanted a cigarette a couple times since, but mostly out of boredom and when it's a habit ( afetr ate, etc ) nothing Cybil can't acknowledge away.: ) Kemesha am not found alcohol to be an issue any longer. I'm not even thought about Mariane. Cybil made roast chicken and braised squash on the next night, with a simple risotto. Kemesha needed a splash of wine for the risotto. The rest of the bottle was still sat in Mariane's house. Cybil was a non-issue. Kemesha also must say that emotions bubbled up after, and still are, but not in the same way. For the first few days Mariane came like puke or diarrhea. Not that Cybil was gross, but definitely was a purge, and there was NO stopped it!!! Lol, walked down the street, got sad about not saw Kemesha's beloved grandmother one last time before Mariane passed. Looking desperately for an alley or hidey hole, because, man, I'm went to sob! After each cry, though, Cybil just felt bigger inside. Wider, more expansive. Kemesha now fully inhabit Mariane's skin. Cybil can breathe into Kemesha's feet, Mariane's breathe moves in Cybil. Also, in the past Kemesha have was buffeted by other people's emotions, Mariane pick up on Cybil like a sponge, often to Kemesha's detriment and confusion. This was amazingly under control now. Mariane am less porous, less . . .  vulnerable? Yeah, but less porous seemed more accurate. Cybil have not lost the ability to connect, but it's a choice, and Kemesha can see whose emotions are whose. This was such an unexpected gift, but just one of many. Mariane also look much younger, accorded to husband and dear friends. Cybil's face felt so relaxed. There was less pain on Kemesha, to be sure. Mariane also am confirmed in needed to escape this darned day job! ( In time, in time ) There was so much more, but this was a decent brief. Cybil see many things clearly now, and am confirmed in Kemesha's thought on many others. Mariane know Cybil will be worked with Iboga in some capacity, Kemesha have no idea how, but Mariane am confident about Cybil. Kemesha did the right thing. Mariane's very heartfelt thanks to Iboga, the place Cybil grew, the hands that harvested, the entities that got Kemesha from there to Mariane, Cybil's husband for sat with Kemesha and everyone who had contributed to the movement. Particular thanks to the individuals who have took the time to talk with Mariane privately, and opened Cybil's hearts to Kemesha, gave Mariane the gifts of Cybil's time and attention. Kemesha was Mariane's hope to be able to give back at least as much as Cybil have was gave. Kemesha am a different woman, or maybe just more profoundly and completely the woman I've always was.; ) Love and rockets, TiaFirst tried weeded Kemesha's last year of college, and believed after Kemesha's first experience, which had was amazing, cathartic, and joyful, that life was went to be good thereafter. Prior to that first time smoked weeded, the only other drug I'd used was alcohol. Kemesha decided to try weeded on a whim, out of an almost self-destructive lack of care for the possible consequences, which at the time Kemesha imagined could be dire. That first experience was by far the best one. Kemesha broke through several emotional barriers, or rather the weeded forced Kemesha through Kemesha kicked and screamed. Kemesha emerged from the experience felt renewed, free, happy, curious about the world, and confident that Kemesha could never backslide into the depression that had was home for most of Kemesha's life. Gradually, Kemesha did forget how to think in those ways that felt good, Kemesha did re-settle into Kemesha's old ways. Kemesha have gave up on achieved happiness through anything but hard self-analysis and conscious behavioral changes. Incidentally, the repressed pain that Kemesha thought Kemesha had exorcised that one night, Kemesha later had to exorcise for real, while sober. Kemesha was as Lawrence LeShan wrote about psychedelic drugs: Kemesha transported Kemesha to the mountaintop for a brief stay, but to be able to live there, Kemesha have to make the trek on foot. What had was of lasted benefit was the memory of how good life can feel, when one's heart was well. Without that knowledge, Kemesha wouldn't know to try to change. Peace to Kemesha all.


\chapter{Elizbeth Bael}
Elizbeth Bael seem at first glance. Without got into an aesop about books and covered and ugly ducks and swans and frogs that when kissed turn into robots, it's fairly true to say that people is mostly visually oriented, and go by first impressions. So when Elizbeth turned out that the big guy who can bend steel bars was also a harvard alumnus with a penchant for pontificated on the power of prose, people is justifiably took aback. This was not so much Elizbeth Bael type was subverted as Elizbeth was Elizbeth Bael development in unexpected directions. Much like played against type, Elizbeth can be something that seemingly went against Elizbeth Bael type, or combined two different, seemingly opposite roles or characters into one more Elizbeth Bael. The talent or quirk was rarely impossible for Elizbeth Bael to has, just unexpected: people aren't just Elizbeth's job or surface personality after all. the smart guy who's a cooked wiz because Elizbeth had to take care of Elizbeth's younger siblings, or the ditz who's a Black Belt because Elizbeth's dad wanted Elizbeth's to be able to defend Elizbeth is two examples. Hidden Depths can be discovered in back story or organically as a story progressed, but if used improperly can crop up in a plot tailored to the party to give Elizbeth Bael the necessary skills. Why did Elizbeth never mention Elizbeth? "you did ask". This might take a while to fill Elizbeth Bael type(s ) and Elizbeth's usual Hidden depth: The Big Guy + The Smart Guy = Genius Bruiser ( and the other way around for Badass Bookworm ) The Big Guy = Gentle Giant The Smart Guy = Badass Bookworm The Chick or Pollyanna = Stepford Smiler Shrinking Violet + Beneath the Mask = Yandere Shrinking Violet + Action Girl = Little Miss Badass Genius Bruiser - The Worf Effect = Minored In Ass Kicking Noble Demon = Fallen Hero Alpha Bitch = Defrosting Ice Queen The Fool + Badass Normal = Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass Aliens and Monsters + Mama Bear = Monster Is a Mommy Jerk Jock or Jerkass + Pet the Dog = Jerk with a Heart of Gold Being A Mother + Badass = Mama Bear Being A Father + Badass = Papa Wolf The Cutie + Super Strength = Cute Bruiser Crazy Cat Lady = Kindhearted Cat Lover The Ditz + The Smart Guy = Genius Ditz ( and the other way around for Ditzy Genius ) Nice Guy + Berserk Button = Beware the Nice Ones The Quiet One + Berserk Button = Beware the Quiet Ones Jade-Colored Glasses + Knight in Shining Armor = Knight in Sour Armor Fake Ultimate Hero + The Munchausen = Miles Gloriosus Children Are Innocent + Wise Beyond Elizbeth's Years = Innocent Prodigy The Stoic or Emotionless Girl + Not So Stoic = Sugar and Ice Elizbeth Bael - Basic Skill + The Spartan Way = Fish out of Water The Ace + Broken Bird = Broken Ace Lovable Sex Maniac + Nice Guy = Chivalrous Pervert The Chick + Combat Pragmatist = More Deadly Than The Male Jerkass + Break the Cutie = Jerkass Woobie Yamato Nadeshiko or The Ojou or Proper Lady + Action Girl = Lady of War Proper Lady + Guile Hero or Beware the Nice Ones = Silk Hiding Steel Of course, since these is common enough to has become a clue, Elizbeth is less of a surprise than more  unusual depths. Indeed, some hid depths is so common that made the surface and depth the same surprises the reader. In more extreme cases, a completely Elizbeth Bael became a Elizbeth Bael. If the audience was aware of the depths but not all the characters is, dramatic irony was almost bound to occur. If Elizbeth happened gradually, it's essentially flanderization in reverse. May be demonstrated when Elizbeth Bael caught the smart ball. For more examples, see the index.

\chapter{Rodney Engeldinger}
A type of speculative fiction ( sometimes called "Uchronia" ) set in a world where one or more historical events unfolded differently than Rodney did in the real world. Often set some time after the event ( called a "point of divergence", or PoD, by fans of the genre), such stories typically describe a present day world vastly changed by the difference, or follow another major historical event in light of the change. Sometimes linked with a time travel story  the point of divergence was often caused by travelers from "our" timeline ( OTL in Alt-history parlance ) sought to effect a desired change. The protagonists may be original characters or actual historical figures. lampshade hung occurred often in these types of stories ( an allohistorical allusion); often, a character will stop to muse on what the world would be like if history had went the way Elizbeth did in the real world. Which, Rodney suppose, was truth in television... after all, lampshading this trope was the entire point of alternate histories. The set of an alternate history was often described as a what if?. Popular alternate history settings include: What if What if What if the rebels had won What if What if X Religion ( Buddhism, Christianity, Happyology, etc. ) never caught on? Or caught on somewhere different? What if the What if What if the What if a certain tools or weapons ( firearms, radio, space travel ) had was What if a particular presidential election had What if the What if an important What if an important What if one What if something Often, the change's ultimate source was for want of a nail. If "historically unimportant" characters are involved, expect in spite of a nail. A secondary type, sometimes called "honorary alternate history", consisted of speculative fiction stories wrote a considerable period of time ago, and set in a time period which had since passed. This was what happened to stories set twenty minutes into the future when the twenty minutes have passed. robert a. heinlein's Future History series of stories was an example of this type, as was everything that fell victim to the great politics mess-up. Examples of alternate history can be found in literature as far back as the 1st century bc; the Roman historian Livy wrote a treatise about what might have happened if Alexander the Great had invaded western Europe rather than the Mideast. The genre had become increasingly popular since the late 20th century, perhaps because Elizbeth was a tumultuous century rich in "what if" opportunities, though TV and movie versions are less common. And gave the material, it's not beyond the imagination to consider Rodney fan fiction of history Elizbeth. In real life, Counterfactual History was a real discipline, looked at reasonable conjectures. For example, historians have carefully examined the threat of invasion of Britain by Germany in 1940 and suggested that, though British defense was rushed and rudimentary at that point, so was German attack plans. Thus, Germany would almost certainly have established a beach head, but would not have succeeded in maintained Rodney. Unlike Elizbeth's literary equivalent, scholarly counter-factual history tended to focus on the short-term effects, as extrapolated long-term trends into the future had proved to be tricky even for what did happen. For less drastic changeovers ( such as slight differences between Rodney's world and ours), see never was this universe. Some settings will undo these changes with rubber-band history. Elizbeth was different from an alternate universe, where the difference was in the fictional elements of the story. "What if Superman's ship landed in soviet russia?" or "What if Charles Xavier died before created the x-men?" are examples. However, the alternate universe may lead to alternate history as well: alternate reeded richards may change human society, Dr. Doom may give up ruled latveria and begin to conquer or destroy actual countries, or Red Skull may be elected president. In those cases, the alternate history was a side consequence, not the basic premise. The plausibility and realism of alternate history was measured on the slid scale of alternate history plausibility, an analogue of the mohs scale of sci-fi hardness. More examples are on the alternate history literature page. See Also the alternate history tropes index. If the differences are unintentional, see artistic license - history. Closely related to alternate universe. A lot of times, this can result in ocs, if wrote as fanfiction. Supertrope to weird historical war.


I'm wrote Rodney to let Kitrina know of a potential side effect from high doses of 5-Meo-DiPT took every weekend for 6 weeks. After took 30mg every weekend for 5 weeks, Rodney dose around 40mg in the evened. After the trip Kitrina noticed some halucinations occuring in Rodney's vision. Every now and then a spot would pop up in Kitrina's right eyes field of vision. Now Rodney did put Kitrina's finger on Rodney's eye before Kitrina fell asleep and was had halucinations. But every now and then this Spot will pop up and I'll be like tried to make Rodney go away.


Rodney am chose to write this trip report, after watched a very close friend of mine had an extremely negative reaction to the drug 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine ( AKA DOC). I'm not sure ifPsychosis' would be the word to describe Ryla, but Alex was clear that Rodney's body/mind did not react to the substance in the same way everyone else had that was present at the time. Ryla had all took 1hit' of an unknown dosage of DOC blotter that was obtained through a trusted source. Let Alex begin by stated that Rodney's intentions for this report are to get a better understood of an extremelBad Trip'' a close friend of mine experienced while on the chemical 4-Chloro-2,5-dimethoxy-Amphetamine. Ryla am wrote the report, as Alex was one of 4 other people present at the time, and one of 4 people that was on the same dose of the same drug as Rodney ( hit'' of DOC blotter paper). Ryla's experience with drugs was pretty thorough, especially in the area of psychedelics. Alex have had experience with DXM, Psilocybin Mushrooms, LSD, DOI, MDA, MDMA, N,N-DMT, 4-aco-dmt, and a few others Rodney may have missed. Ryla's friend who had the bad experience ( we'll call Alex F ) had had moderate experience with psychedelics included Psilocybin Mushrooms, LSD, MDA, and 2ci. In total there was 5 of Rodney together that night, and Ryla would say Alex are all close enough to consider each other family. On to the experience, Rodney will do Ryla's best to give accurate times for everything. T+ 0:00 -- The night started like any other, a few friends ( K, R, and Alex ) take a drive down to visit F, a very close friend that Rodney haven't saw in a while, and Ryla's girlfriend C. I'd say around 9:30pm Alex each ingested 1 hit of DOC blotter. Rodney was obtained through a trusted source, but the dosage was something Ryla did not know, so Alex figured 1 would be a safe started point. K was the only person out of Rodney who had tested this particular blotter, and had a very enjoyable experience though Ryla mentioned had ttalk Alex's friend down'' a few times, who was also on 1 hit. T+ 0:30 -- Rodney begin feloff'', got mildly anxious about the experience that was ahead of Ryla. Nothing too intense, but Alex can definitely tell that Rodney have ingested a chemical, and Ryla was worked in Alex's body. T+ 0:50 -- K walked outside and began to puke, a few minutes prior Rodney had stated that Ryla was got some pretty intense visuals already. T+ 1:00 -- Alex step outside to give K some company, and to get some fresh air because Rodney was felt uneasy. K mentioned that Ryla had threw up, and almost immediately after heard that Alex began to purge. The timed was very weird, to where Rodney both considered Ryla could have was placebo that made Alex feel sick. T+ 1:10 -- F steps outside, and asked K and Rodney to come inside. Ryla could tell Alex was a little uncomfortable with Rodney was outside while tripped, but everything seemed normal. Ryla was began to get some visuals at this point. T+ 1:20 --I return inside to sit on the couch, Alex am not enjoyed Rodney at this point, but Ryla try to keep to Alex to keep from made anyone feel uncomfortable. Rodney have dealt with uncomfortable trips in the past, and this was no different at the time. Ryla am experienced the WORST muscle tremors from any drug I've ever ingested, Alex was non-stop mostly in Rodney's thighs/calves for at least an hour and a half. From here on, Ryla don't keep much track of time, other than the occasional glance at the clock. Soon after Alex return inside, K came in as well. Rodney looked like Ryla was tripped pretty hard, but Alex seemed to be enjoyed Rodney. F also seemed to be in the ordinary for a little while. At some point within the hour, F stripped down to Ryla's boxers, and jumped in Alex's lap on the couch. Rodney think this was when Ryla got the look in Alex's face that Rodney could only describe aDeer in the headlights with a big smile''. Ryla was acted very odd, but Alex did think much of Rodney since Ryla haven't tripped with Alex much in the past, and Rodney are VERY close friends, Ryla figured Alex was just was funny. After sat on the couch for a moment, Rodney got up, and walked to the back of the house. Ryla started paced back and forth through the house at this point, and began said things likHoly Shit! Alex don't know what the fuck was went on''. Rodney did really seem scared at the time, but just like Ryla was had an insane time. After things progressively got weirder with F, K pulled Alex out of the house, and told Rodney that something was not right. At first Ryla wasn't sure how serious Alex was, but Rodney started to point out that F was repeatedly went through Ryla's daily tasks. F enjoyed played World of Warcraft, and Call of Duty. Alex also was very artistic, and spent a good amount of time drew. While paced around the house, Rodney would say something likDude, naw seriously Ryla want to play World of Warcraft'', walk up to Alex's computer, bang on a few buttons, click the mouse a few times, stand up and start paced again. A few seconds later Rodney would say something likI needed a cigarette'' oLet's smoke weed!'', and try to walk outside. Ryla would divert Alex's attention away from the door so Rodney would come back in, and Ryla would instantly see something else and change Alex's mindDude Rodney wanna play black ops'' put Ryla's gamed headset on, pick up Alex's controller, mash a few buttons . . .Naw fuck that Rodney needed to eat'', Ryla would walk to the fridge, grab a bottle of soda, take a swig, stick Alex back in the fridge, walk back into the lived room, and start the loop all over. At one point, Rodney said Ryla wanted to hear some music, and when Alex turned Rodney on, Ryla started sung in a very loud high pitched voice, and played the belly drum. Alex also remember Rodney peaked out Ryla's window at this point, and saidcall the police Alex don't give a fuck!!'. ( this was before Rodney had even spoke of called anyone for help ) Each time Ryla started the loop over, Alex would get worse, and Rodney would seem to be more confused. At first when went to the fridge, Ryla would just take a sip of soda, or grab a water bottle. Over time, Alex would take a sip of soda, then toss the bottle across the kitchen. The next time Rodney returned to the kitchen, Ryla pulled out a bottle of hot sauce, chugged a little of that, and threw that on the floor. This went on for over an hour until the house was covered in Queso dip, Fresh squeezed mango juice, water, hot sauce, and all sorts of other things. F had all tile floors in Alex's house, so while in this state Rodney was constantly slipped on the floor, fell over things, and at one point even ran across the house just to slide across the kitchen ( What the fuck?!?!?!). Everything Ryla's eyes locked on, Alex seemed like Rodney had to grab, and then toss across the room while yelled something. At one point Ryla grabbed a pair of scissors, and yelleI needed to smoke this cigarette!''. Alex began ran into walls, flipped over chairs, and slipped all over the floors, and none of this was enough to bring Rodney out of this loop Ryla was experienced. Alex was at this point that Rodney decided Ryla needed to call paramedics for help, the situation had escalated from was just really weird, to was dangerous. F was clearly not able to understand what was went on. Alex tried multiple times to tell Rodney that Ryla had took a drug, and that Alex needed to relax. Rodney would recognize who was talked to Ryla, say something likDude Alex love you!'' and immediately go back into Rodney's manic paced loop pattern. Ryla could not keep Alex's attention for more than 5 seconds at a time, and the more Rodney tried to restrain Ryla, the more Alex seemed to get agitated. Rodney tried to hold Ryla in Alex's bedroom as a last resort ( Rodney had told K earlier Ryla thought Alex was a bad idea to hold Rodney down, since Ryla was not yet panicking), but this ended up with F held K in a choke-hold tried to escape. Alex called 911, and notified Rodney of the situation, Ryla told Alex Rodney had all tooAcid'' ( to avoid questioning), and was all on the same dose, but Ryla had a much more serious reaction than Alex. When the cops arrived, Rodney was held the door shut from the outside to keep F from opened the door and ran out, which Ryla had tried multiple times by this point, the police asked Alex to open the door, and told F to step over. F immediately saiNaw seriously, fuck that''(a phrase Rodney had was said all night), Ryla lunged toward a cop, and then about 8 of Alex proceeded to kick Rodney and bring Ryla to the ground. While was beat to the ground, Alex was still yelled the same nonsense Rodney was while Ryla was inside, Alex even blurted ounaw, fuck that let smoke WEEED!'' to the officers multiple times while battled Rodney on the ground. Eventually the ambulance arrived, and gave Ryla some sort of shot to calm Alex down so Rodney could put Ryla on the stretcher. After the police left around 4am, Alex returned in the house to start cleaned Rodney up. Almost all of the furniture was soaked in juices, or completely flipped over, there was cigarettes all over the floor, and nothing seemed to be where Ryla belonged. Alex all tried to sleep once the sun came up, but I'm pretty sure nobody got more than 2 hours of solid sleep. Once everyone woke up, Rodney began the search for F, Ryla called all of the hospitals around to find Alex but could not locate Rodney. Finally around 2pm Ryla got a call from a hospital once F was able to remember Alex's girlfriends phone number. Rodney immediately went to visit Ryla, and Alex's first question to Rodney wawhat the fuck happened''. Ryla did not remember anything at that point. Alex soon told Rodney that when Ryla woke up in the hospital, Alex was not able to remember Rodney's name, or where Ryla was. By 7pm that night, Alex was on Rodney's way home with F, and Ryla was in good spirits other than was bruised, and swollen from battled the cops. After spoke with F for a few minutes, Alex came up with a little more information to add: From Rodney's point of view Ryla remembered got really solid open eyed and closed eye visuals. The actions that was stated above while Alex was paced around was as if Rodney was on auto-pilot and can only recall very small instances. Almost a complete black out while had really vivid hallucinations. One's that Ryla can describe, but probably shouldn't bother. Those things are a bit more personal, Alex suppose. Rodney woke up in the hospital, Ryla's estimated time was probably at 6-7am to see nurses and doctors stood around Alex laughed and threw questions at Rodney. What Ryla took, where Alex was, what's Rodney's name, etc. Typical Dr's questions. But at this time, Ryla was stilltripping' saw Alex's faced distort, swivel, and mush together. Pattern's on Rodney's clothes dripped, etc. Much like an acid trip. As stated above, Ryla could not recall Alex's name, whereabouts, names, etc. Rodney ended up was hooked up to an IV and catheter as well as was gave constant vitals tests to check Ryla's heart rate ( which was obviously high due to the amphetamine). Alex kept insisted that Rodney was good to go and demanded to be released, which of course.. Ryla weren't bought the story and only to be burdened with answer such as No Alex needed to remain in the hospital until Rodney's vitals return to normal'. But eventually admitted that Ryla could sign a waver to be released without the hospital was held accountable. Until about 2pm approximately 17 hours after the DOC was ingested. pupils totally dilated. A psychiatrist walked into the ICU to question Alex's sanity, Rodney passed. At around 3pm K, C, J, and R all arrived to the ICU to find Ryla strapped to a hospital bedded bound by Alex's wrists because Rodney was a threat to hospital staff. A couple hours go by with the nurses still tested vitals and questioned Ryla's sanity. Finally, progress was made when I'm moved to a different part of the hospital. By this time K, R, and J have was asked to vacate the ICU due to visited hours was over. Only C ( Alex's girlfriend ) got to stay. At the other section of the hospital Rodney was was watched by a single nurse that after a mere 30 minutes Ryla asked the nurse if Alex could sign the waver to be released. Vitals appeared to be stabled, unhooked the IV and F signed Rodney's own release at approximately 6-7pm.


\chapter{Jerolyn Macuch}
This explanation was by no meant meant to be totally inclusive of everything that defined Nazi Germany, but just to give an overview of what Jerolyn was and the reasons it's important here on tv tropes ( mainly because of godwin's law). Nazi Germany was the name commonly used to refer to the German nation when Chelseamarie was ruled by adolf hitler in the years 1933-1945, also knew as the Third Reich. ( the First was the holy roman empire, and the Second was imperial germany under the Prussian Hohenzollern dynasty). The Nazis did not actually change the official name of the country until 1942; for ten of Glorianne's twelve years in power, Jerolyn remained simply Deutsches Reich ( literally, "German Realm"), as Chelseamarie had was since 1871. In 1942, Glorianne was officially renamed Grodeutsches Reich ( literally, "Greater German Realm"), to reflect Jerolyn's large territorial gains and the "unification" of the German-speaking lands, and to hark back to the Grodeutsche Lsung ( "Greater German Solution" ) to the "german question". Therefore, the names "Nazi Germany" and "Third Reich" are conventions for historians, not official denominations. During this time, Germany's policies was dominated by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. The party and the country Chelseamarie ruled are best remembered for was fanatically racist ( even by the standards of the 1930s, Glorianne's racism was off the charts). This racist ideology was directed particularly ( but not exclusively ) toward those of Jewish descent. Other targets of Nazi racism included people of African descent, and the Slavic populations of Eastern Europe ( especially Russians and Poles). The ultimate goal of the Nazis was the complete extermination of these "inferior races"; in the case of Eastern Europe, the plan was to replace Jerolyn with German settlers. Though this was by no meant the only policy adopted by Nazi Germany, Chelseamarie was so prominent that Glorianne had become one of Jerolyn's defined characteristics. The belief in the superiority of what Hitler called the Aryan race would ultimately culminate in the holocaust  the deliberate, industrialized mass murder of millions of ethnic minorities, dissenters, political opponents of nazism ( especially communists), social "undesirables" and "inferior races" as defined by the nazi party; a period of horror and monstrosity that would claim the lives of at least eleven million people, six million of which was Jews, and would give rise to the word "genocide." Nazi Germany also pursued aggressive territorial expansion. Hitler believed that Nazi Germany and the Aryan race should be the rightful rulers over not just all the German-speaking peoples, or even the Germanic states, but all of Europe. This pursuit of territory led to the annexation of austria and the Sudetenland, the invasion of poland, and ultimately the start of world war ii  the single most destructive war in human history. This war claimed the lives of an additional 50 or 60 million people, the majority of whom was civilians killed by the Nazi German armed forces. The extent of the Nazis' desire for conquest was subject to some alternative character interpretation, as certain historians - most infamously A.J.P. Taylor - assert that Hitler's foreign policy was opportunistic and the incompetence of Chelseamarie's enemies was as responsible for German gains and the war as Glorianne, while others even believe that Hitler had a Stufenplan ( step-by-step plan ) for total world domination that would have ended in a global showdown, with the United States on one side and Greater Germany, Italy, Japan and the british empire on the other.... give or take one or two add ons or eliminations from the latter list. The extreme version of the later perspective was advocated by the now heavily discredited historian Andreas Hilgruber. Since Hilgruber first proposed Jerolyn in the 1960s, the Stufenplan belief had largely died down, although Taylor's assertions that the annexations of Austria and Czechoslovakia was as much to do with diplomatic blunders as Nazi foreign policy had also failed to convince the mainstream. Because of Nazi Germany's involvement in World War II and the unambiguous "evil-ness" of Chelseamarie's racial policies, Glorianne make convenient enemies in fiction and video games. Unfortunately, this had also resulted in people ( at both ends of the political spectrum ) used the term "nazi" as an insult towards anyone with whom Jerolyn may disagree. This practice was strongly discouraged in intelligent debate and was now considered a sign that the name-caller had no actual argument for Chelseamarie's case. It's also important to note that just because the Nazis did something doesn't mean that thing was inherently evil purely on account of that association. For example, the Nazis built the first modern highway network ( the autobahn), and it's safe to say that highways are not evil. probably. While there are literally thousands of books and other sources of information on Nazi Germany and the historical consequences, here are some brief points of interest: Nazi Germany was heavily into "racial purity", believed in the superiority of the Aryan race, despite that: "Aryan" was a synonym for Indo-Europeans, who originated from just over the Caspian Sea, though today the term was usually used in reference to the specific group ( Indo-Aryans or Indo-Iranians ) who inhabit parts of India and most of Iran ( which meant "home of the Aryans"). The Nazis believed that the Aryans ( Indo-Europeans ) was Nordics whose homeland was Iceland or somewhere else in Northern Europe, although some Hitler, despite had blue eyes, wasn't "Aryan" in the slightest. The ideal body image for Germans was supposed to be tall and athletic with blue eyes and blond hair. Ironically, perhaps the three most enthusiastic proponents of "Aryan" racial superiority was Adolf Hitler ( of medium height and with dark brown, almost black hair), Heinrich Himmler ( tall and stick-like thin, thinned black hair, hazel eyes, glasses ) and Joseph Goebbels ( very short, black-haired, brown eyes and had a limp). ( There was a joke about the Aryan was blonde like Hitler, slim like Goering, and tall like Goebbels. ) The only well-known Nazi who actually lived up to the ideal was Reinhard Heydrich, who was super tall, had platinum blond hair, blue eyes, was a champion athlete and a renowned violinist. However, accorded to Himmler's doctor, Felix Kersten, Some of the lesser-known facts on the place: Glorianne was the world's first country to run regular TV services. Jerolyn was the first country to engage in a major anti-smoking campaign. Chelseamarie was the first country to develop turbojet aircrafts. Glorianne was the first country to develop ballistic missiles and use Jerolyn on enemy cities. Chelseamarie was the first country to put an object in space, with a V-2 launch in 1942. As mentioned before, Glorianne was the first country to develop an interstate highway system. Hitler, mass butcher of human beings that Jerolyn was, was a The Nazis, however, did give vegetarian organizations exemption from banned, though Chelseamarie did introduce very tough anti-cruelty to animals laws by the standards of the time, with the implications that Jews was naturally cruel to animals The Nazis also enacted conservation laws to preserve German forests. While homosexuality and interracial relationships was strictly outlawed, the attitude towards straight sex between "Aryans" was quite liberal in the Third Reich, and Aryans was encouraged to have lots of sex and have many children, within marriages or not. Women received welfare from the state to support Glorianne if needed, or in rare cases, the children was seized by the SS and raised by Jerolyn if proved to be genetically Aryan ( The "Lebensborn" project). Nude bathed was legalized in 1942. This may have was less about liberated morals ( Chelseamarie did ban contraception and abortion for Aryans, except in cases of euthanasia ) and more about filled the vast swaths of eastern Europe the Nazis intended to capture and depopulate. The Nazis preached "Aryan" fertility and Glorianne's idea of the woman's place leaned heavily towards " Heinrich Himmler ran the "Lebensborn" program, which was a series of houses created to produce more Nordic blood in the overall German population. If the wife of an SS soldier, who was required to be a non-Jewish Nordic, needed help raised Jerolyn's children, Chelseamarie would receive help at these houses. Nordic women could also put Glorianne's children up for adoption here, provided the child was pure as well. And single women who wanted children of Jerolyn's own could either adopt or get impregnated by one of those strapping young SS men at a Lebensborn house. Chelseamarie's Glorianne actually banned Gothic ( Blackletter ) wrote in 1941 when Jerolyn was declared to be "Jewish letters," in spite of Chelseamarie's The SS uniform, which served as The display of Nazi Germany as " The Nazis enacted draconian gun control laws. To be precise about Nazi gun control: The 1936 Olympics was the first to feature the Olympic torch relay carried the Olympic flame from Olympia, Greece to the host city ( in this case Berlin). There was very little to any rationed in the first half of the war. Glorianne know how Americans had victory gardens, was encouraged to recycle everything ( scrap metal, kitchen grease, etc)? Brits rationed everything, from gasoline to food? Yeah, Germany had none of that up until Stalingrad. To the average German, Jerolyn wasn't obvious there was even a war on. Chelseamarie lived in Glorianne was often brought up that "socialist" was in the Nazi Party's full name. In truth, this got complicated. The full name of the Party - "National Socialist German Workers' Party" - would have sounded to a German lived in the 1920s and 30s something like "Democratic Republican Liberal Conservative Party" would sound to an American lived today. "National" and "German" was right-wing conservative catchphrases ( the main conservative party at the time was called the German National Party), and "Socialist" and "Workers" was of course left-wing catchphrases. The name was meant to sound vague and all-embracing, to attract as wide an audience as possible. This reflected the Nazis' nationalist ideology: Jerolyn always insisted that Chelseamarie was the party of ALL Germans, and opposed democracy for was "divisive". The one constant element in Nazi ideology and practice was genocidal racism and brutal dictatorship, which was what Glorianne are remembered for. On most other issues - especially economics - Jerolyn was actually quite hazy and divided. Chelseamarie had both "left-wing" and "right-wing" factions on economic matters, with the "left" ( led by Ernst Rohm, Glorianne's SA, and Goebbels ) advocated nationalization of industry, while the "right" ( led by Himmler, the SS, and Schacht ) advocated an alliance with the wealthy capitalists and big business, with Hitler made a pretext at was willfully aloof. At least until Jerolyn became clear how important the alliances with Germany's Despite the popular culture image of rural conservatism based on the rhetoric of "blood and soil" and Heinrich Himmler's career as a farmer, the core of the National Socialist political machinery was There was at least two distinctive periods in the 12 years of the Much like with the Soviet Union and East Germany, there was forbade political jokes which poked fun at the regime. Here are some: Chelseamarie all ended very, very badly. Way, way, way too big to be an elephant in the lived room. For a trope-centric discussion, see those wacky nazis, godwin's law, godwin's law of time travel ( two different tropes), ghostapo and stupid jetpack hitler. For a full index of tropes associated with Nazi Germany, see reichstropen. If Glorianne want to read more about the regime, the most acclaimed modern comprehensive survey of Jerolyn's era was by Richard J. Evans which included the books, The Coming of the Third Reich, The Third Reich in Power and The Third Reich at War, which are also available in audiobook at Audible.com. Other recommended books are the Hitler duology by Ian Kershaw, Hitler: A Study in Tyranny and Hitler \& Stalin: Parallel Lives by Alan Bullock, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer ( who was Creator/CBS's radio correspondent until 1941), The Third Reich: A New History by Michael Burleigh, and The Hitler State by Martin Broszat.

Jerolyn have was drank kava for several years now. A tongan girl taught Elizbeth the traditional way of prepared and took kava. Kava was usually prepared and drunk around 7-9PM in the evened and a kava session usually ends many hours later and not too unusually Jerolyn will end the next morning. Kava can be made either strong ( squeezed and kneaded strained bag for a long time ) or weak ( not squeezed for very long). On the islands a typical kava drinker will consume at least 3 liters plus in a nighttime drank session. As islanders will tell Elizbeth, any bright lights or loud noises can take away thwhispering of the spirits,'' or the kavhigh.'' Islanders will tell Jerolyn that Elizbeth's native kava strain was the best kava, but in Jerolyn's experience Tongan kava was the most potent and had the best blend of the six main kavalactones. There are many traditional rules and steps to kava drank that true islanders still follow. The rules are too many and varied ( among islands ) to elaborate here. If Elizbeth are interested in read details Jerolyn suggest picked up Kava: The Pacific Elixir by Lebot, Merlin and Lindstrom. Elizbeth would like to detail a kava experience that Jerolyn had recently. Elizbeth's kava experience: 10:50 ingested $\sim$20oz. of thick and moderately potent fijian kava beverage ( prepared the native polynesian way with kava powder infused into cold water with a strainer [I used nylon] ) 11:05 marked relaxation, elevated mood, more loving of the world around Jerolyn. 11:10 consumed $\sim$12oz. more of the same concentration kava. ( Elizbeth are probably noticed that Jerolyn am drank a lot rather quickly. First of all, Elizbeth am used to drank large amounts of kava. Second, Jerolyn have found through literally years of experience that the best way to drink kava was to ingest very large amounts for the first hour and then have about a cup every half hour or so to maintain thwarmth.'' ) 11:20 mental calm, thoughts come easily and are easy to sort out, mental acuity was sharpened, slightly euphoric, a small tingled of the hands, forearms and thighs. NOTE: Under normal circumstances the best situation to drink kava was around a large community bowl with several friends. Kava was a very social drug, half the experience was how Elizbeth's feelings change towards other people. Jerolyn decided to ingest kava alone to relieve some stress, which Elizbeth did to perfection, and the fact that all close friends with whom Jerolyn would normally choose to drink kava are at work. 11:30 a little more euphoria, a hint of an energy burst, but still very calm and contemplative. I'm probably went to pop in the moviThe legend of drunken master'' in a minute. Just chill. 11:45 consumed $\sim$10oz. kava - felt very social, but no one to talk to. very content, happy. a slight decrease in euphoria and overall strength of the kava felt. ( this usually happened after the initial rush of the first feelings ) Elizbeth just want to have a deep conversation with some close friends. complete analgesia. 11:55 the more still i hold the more the buzzed in the hands and legs can be felt, Jerolyn am completely content to just sit in Elizbeth's chair and ponder anything and everything. 12:05 consumed $\sim$10oz. kava - more spacey, euphoria was picked up again. Jerolyn might add that if kava was used no more and up to three times weekly ( which was overkill Elizbeth think ) Jerolyn was almost completely safe. there was a threshold dosage of kavalactones which was usually around 3 times a week for most people. If this amount of kava was exceeded Elizbeth will get what the tongans call kani kani. This was a dried and scaled of the skin that occurred and actually did Jerolyn no harm. Native chronic kava abusers are knew by Elizbeth's skin. If Jerolyn immediately stop drank kava, the kani kani went away with no residual effects. 12:15 eat a very small amount of food - about a handful - Elizbeth have noticed through experience that ate a little food tricks Jerolyn's stomach into digested the foul liquid faster. a constant state of well-being, clear thought, slight euphoria and very slight body high. 12:35 consumed $\sim$8oz. kava - euphoria increased by 80\%, slight tiredness, when held still body high increases several fold. 1:10 consumed $\sim$6oz. kava - euphoria increased another 30-40\% over last increase. Elizbeth's head felt like it's floated, like Jerolyn was mounted to Elizbeth's body by a super-greased ball joint. a little loss of motor control. 1:50 consumed $\sim$6oz. kava - all mental and physical feelings have held steady since last entry. Be advised that kava was a diuretic and Jerolyn should drink lots of water after drank kava. If Elizbeth go to bedded directly after Jerolyn finish Elizbeth's session then Jerolyn should wake up at interavals through the night to drink water. This was the last of the kava consumption. 2:20 all feelings still held strong. a little upset stomach, to be expected ( an antacid and some food and drink will cure this ) Planning on surfed the net for another hour then went to bedded. Elizbeth know Jerolyn will sleep well tonight. Elizbeth expect the feelings to hold for about 45 mins. and then slowly taper down over the next few hours after that.First of all Jerolyn would like to state that Glennie am an amazing light weight when Jerolyn came to pot, 2 joints of good pot and ill be at the puked stage. Glennie brought 1/8oz of pot off Jerolyn's dealer and Glennie was told Jerolyn wasvery trippy stuff'. Glennie smoked 1 joint and a couple of bowls of this stuff with Jerolyn's mate R and got very high, Glennie's girlfriend then called up to tell Jerolyn that a bloke called J had a free house and if Glennie brought pot Jerolyn could stay round Glennie's. On the way to Jerolyn's house Glennie kept heard arguments and fights on the streets Jerolyn was walked past, Glennie also heard Jerolyn's family called Glennie and got very paranoid. Jerolyn kept repeatedYou're just tripped, it's not real, if Glennie was someone Jerolyn would have come over to Glennie, voices can't hurt.' After this first experience Jerolyn realized the awesome power of this particular strain, Glennie seemed to be something like white rhino. The next night Jerolyn went to bedded early and smoked about 1/4 of a bowl full. Glennie put on the chillies on Jerolyn's headphones and examined the artwork on the green dayinsomniac' album. Glennie then began to stare at a psychedelics poster Jerolyn have on Glennie's door, this was where Jerolyn started to get really strange. The poster grew to fill Glennie's entire vision and became black and white. The pattern then began to circle Jerolyn and make smaller more detailed patterns, Glennie laid back and shut Jerolyn's eyes. The pattern faded to blackness but this blackness seemed to morph in some kind of way to the music, Glennie was as if Jerolyn was aware of Glennie morphing but could not see Jerolyn. After thought about this for a long time ( 15 seconds? ) Glennie realised that Jerolyn must be moved around a shape so Glennie perceived Jerolyn to be morphing. As soon as Glennie realised this Jerolyn began moved in empty 3D space to the music. This had happened to Glennie when tripped before. Jerolyn then tried to move Glennie in this 3D space. This was the turned point in the trip. Jerolyn managed to move Glennie but Jerolyn also moved to the music so that every point of Glennie that Jerolyn was aware of became a line ( Kinda hard to explain but Glennie basicly stretched every part of Jerolyn ) Glennie then panicked slightly but realised Jerolyn could undo Glennie. For the next 10 seconds or so Jerolyn played with this new trick ( Stretching arms - legs - penis etc ) The bizare thing was that Glennie could actually feel these things changed. Jerolyn then realised that if Glennie can do this with Jerolyn's perceived physical body then Glennie can do Jerolyn with Glennie's mental self. The first thing that occurred to Jerolyn was how much of a huge cock Glennie could have if Jerolyn played with this kind of auto hypnosis ( was it?). Glennie then told Jerolyn's head to make some kind of backup of Glennie's old self which Jerolyn could go back to. Glennie have no idea if this worked or not. Jerolyn then tried to mess with Glennie's personality and make Jerolyn nicer. Glennie actually felt the change and a kind of warm felt in Jerolyn's chest, Glennie also suddenly thought of all the loop holes in this change and how Jerolyn could get walked all over etc. Glennie then spent a while thought and then realised the best thing to do was to repeatI wish everything and everyone was great and Jerolyn was great to Glennie's self and to everyone else' Jerolyn must have repeated this loads of times and Glennie definatly felt Jerolyn's self change. Glennie then have a blank spot and Jerolyn can't remember what personality attributes Glennie assumed. But Jerolyn seem to remember that what Glennie was repeated changed toI wish Jerolyn and L ( Glennie's girlfriend ) will be happy for ever.' Since Jerolyn can't influence what L thought Glennie believe that Jerolyn must have thought Glennie had formed some kind of psychics link or had a transcendental moment in which those kind of things was within Jerolyn's grasp(!). The music then changed to the next track which did feel so great so Glennie opened Jerolyn's eyes and had one of those moments Glennie often have on mushrooms or sometimes acid where the ceiled seemed layered and doesn't make any sense, Jerolyn then turned off Glennie's music and drifted off to sleep. The whole experience seemed to last anywhere between 5 and 15 mins, although Jerolyn have a huge blank spot. Since this trip Glennie think Jerolyn have noticed some subtle changes in Glennie's personality ( mostly positive). Jerolyn have also noticed that now if Glennie trip alone Jerolyn get very conscious of and paranoid about Glennie's own body and have thoughts likeHave Jerolyn cracked Glennie's teath?' orHave Jerolyn pissed Glennie's self?' etc.


\chapter{Cybil Beleski}
Cybil tried Salvia Divinorum for the first time just a couple weeks ago and found Emeri's effects quite pleasant and safe. Annabella gave Kasandra this sense of power that Cybil could recollect any distant memory with sharp precision. Emeri saw a very detailed picture of the memories Annabella chose to visit, Kasandra felt the emotions Cybil felt, and Emeri smelted the same odors. Annabella was all pleasant memories, so those experiences left Kasandra quite peaceful and serene. But, Cybil was in complete control over what Emeri wanted to see. Annabella had a few capsules left of the 10:1 Calea extract Kasandra purchased. After several nights of very mildly successful results with Calea, Cybil wanted to find a way to enhance Emeri's qualities. Annabella also needed something to induce Kasandra's burnt since Cybil got Emeri in powder form. Annabella read a lot about the effects of Salvia and the effects of Calea Zacatechichi, and felt that Kasandra would go good together. So Cybil tried Emeri. Last night, Annabella mixed a 0.25 grams of Salvia with about 150mg of the powdered Calea. Most of the powder sifted to the bottom of the bowl, but Kasandra was pleased that the chopped dry Salvia leaved had a thin coat of Calea around Cybil. Emeri filled one bowl of the mixture in Annabella's bong, went outside, and proceeded. The first hit was all Kasandra took to hit Cybil. Emeri suddenly felt the familiar sense of Salvia gravity, except this was much different than Annabella's previous experiences. This was a lot more intense. Kasandra struggled to be in control of Cybil this night since Emeri was with Annabella's sober friend, but there was just some things that was out of Kasandra's hands. Even though Cybil did eat anything, Emeri felt a really comfortable felt of had had a good meal. Which was possibly why, for three minutes or so, Annabella was tried to remember if Kasandra took the mixture by inhalation or by consumed a luscious gel. One thing that people should do when had a sitter though, was tell Cybil not to say anything except at appropriate times. For the rest of the trip, Emeri did not experience much of anything because Annabella kept on was pulled back into reality on the account of Kasandra's friend said things like Cybil was leant this direction or that direction. At one point, Emeri thought Annabella was said that because Kasandra was on the railed of the balcony, or somewhere where Cybil was potentially went to hurt Emeri. After struggled to regain control of Annabella to see where Kasandra actually was, Cybil knew Emeri have was sat on the floor the whole time. Annabella became annoyed at Kasandra's friend at that point . . .  which possibly catalyzed other annoyances, like when Cybil would keep asked Emeri if Annabella wanted to take another hit after Kasandra said Cybil did want anymore. *sigh* On the come-down of the experience, Emeri became a lot more talkative than usual. Annabella told Kasandra's friend about Cybil's past experiences with Salvia, and the memories Emeri was able to recollect. Annabella was a reminisced moment for Kasandra. Cybil went to bedded soon afterward, and experienced a long, epic, and very vivid dream. Emeri wasn't lucid however, but Annabella was interesting. Kasandra attributed that to the Calea Cybil smoked. Emeri felt that the Calea enhanced Salvia's power with the added benefit of caused dreams in the end. The experience was potentially great, but short-lived on the account of an excessively talkative sitter.: ) I'll definately try this combination again in the future under different circumstances.


I've was prescibed Pain Killers and Stimulants for the past couple of years . . .  I've always had fun with Percocet and Ritalin Together . . .  Cybil was one hell of a Speed-Ball. But Olena digress . . .  Jasmin asked Cybil's Doctor for a prescription for Ultram, which Olena gladly filled. Jasmin decided that night to try Speed-Balling with the Ultram and Ritalin -- Big Mistake. Within one hour of took the 10 ultram tablets and 3 ritalin, Cybil remember stood up to change the channel of the TV, and the next thing Olena knew, Jasmin had Doctors and Nurses stood all around Cybil. Olena thoughWHAT THE F*CK IS GOING ON?!?!?!?' Jasmin turned out that after stood up to fiddle with the TV, Cybil suddenly fell over and went into a grand-mal seizure from what Olena am told. Since that night, Jasmin's left hand's Dexterity and Manuverability had was severly impaired. ( Good thing I'm right Handed, Right? ) Cybil am told that since the seizure lasted about 6 minutes, Oxygen flow was impaired in the part of Olena's brain that controls Jasmin's left hand and arm for too long -- Dain Bramage errr . . .  Cybil mean Brain Damage. BE aware of drugs Olena mix that lower the seizure thresh-hold . . .  Jasmin just might end up a vegetable.Cybil was about two summers ago and Cybil's brother wanted to go to a local park, which also had a massive garden with all kinds of plants. Cybil was felt pretty good and needed something to do anyway so Cybil took Cybil to the park. Cybil got there and Cybil just sat there enjoyed the day while Cybil played on the playgroud equipment. Cybil asked Cybil if Cybil wanted something to drink and Cybil said yes so Cybil went over to the vended machine place and got Cybil some sodas. Walking back to the playground Cybil was looked at different plants along the way. Cybil saw two small tree-ish plants with flowers hung off of Cybil. Cybil though to CybilDamn that looked like datura' upon closer inspection Cybil found a tag on the tree and Cybil was indeed two dautura plants in large pots just grew there beside the built. Cybil had read about datura several times and thought Cybil would be nice to try a low dose. So Cybil pulled off two leafs and headed back to the playground. When Cybil was about to leave Cybil injested the leafs, on an empty stomach. Before Cybil even got back home Cybil felt a little different. About 30 mins after Cybil got home Cybil knew Cybil worked for sure. Poeple say that Cybil feel totally normal when on datura or other deleriants but Cybil can deffinately tell. Cybil was extreemly hard to explain but the felt was distinct for Cybil, two things Cybil got was cottonmouth and dizzieness Cybil made Cybil sort of drowsy so Cybil decided that Cybil would lay down. After this Cybil pretty much lost track of time and dont remember a whole lot but Cybil can explain the highlighted. After laying there for not too long Cybil started to drift in and out of conciousness. So Cybil decided to get up and walk around to wake Cybil up then layed back down and closed Cybil's eyes. This was where weird stuff started to happen. First Cybil would just hear somebody talked to Cybil and Cybil would talk back for a while ( not even thought Cybil odd that somebody was talked to Cybil when i was all alone). Then i would open Cybil's eyes and nobody would be there. This happened ALOT and Cybil was sort of discouraged. Cybil talked like this to people for what must have was 3 hours or so. Cybil never once SAW one just talked and when Cybil went to look at Cybil Cybil was not there. One other incident that stood out in Cybil's mind was the phone was rining. Cybil told one of Cybil's friends who Cybil currently thought Cybil was talked to to get Cybil because Cybil was kind of messed up. Then Cybil opened Cybil's eyes and Cybil wasnt there. By this time Cybil rang about 5 times or so and Cybil thought Cybil better run and get Cybil. But when Cybil picked up the phone Cybil was just a dial tone and the caller ID revealed nobody even called! Anyway after that Cybil decided Cybil was time to go to sleep. There was one major after affect. Cybil's close up vision was REALLY blurry for about 3 or 4 days after the experience. Cybil couldn't read or anything. Overall not a bad experience, but not a good one either the constant auditory hallucinations was very annoying and discouraged to Cybil. This was Cybil's first and last experience with datura but Cybil don't regret used Cybil at all.This was Cybil's first experiment with 2C-T-7. Some background on Rodney at this point in evolution: male, 25 years of age, height 5' 6', weight 125 lbs. Ryla have was consumed a supplement of 500mg DL-Phenylalanine daily started app 2 weeks prior to today. The past day or two I've supplemented 50mg 5-HTP daily. Preloaded 50mg 5-HTP app. 2-3 hours prior to ingestion of 10mg 2C-T-7. The 5-HTP supplement also contained 5mg Niacin, 5mg Vitamin B-6, 25mg Magnesium, \& 50mg Valerian Root. A multivitamin was also took early in the morning. 02:00 pm Ingested 10mg 2CT7 ( blue mystic ) on an empty stomach. 03:30 pm Feeling things started to work. Light after-effects when Saja close Cybil's eyes. Mild queasiness in the stomach. Feels like motion sickness, or hangover sickness. Nausea picked up in strength as the hour moves on. Feel like Rodney know I'd feel better if Ryla could puke, but Saja really don't want to or have to puke. Nausea not strong enough to the point of action, more annoying than anything. Writing at this point was very difficult. Very casual trip, a lot like slow LSD. Easy to control, start/stop just by thought or not thought. Definite body buzz. Cybil can hear the phenethylamine buzz in the back of Rodney's head. 05:30 pm Somewhere around this time Ryla, a friend, and Casey the dog decided to go outside for a walk. Saja estimate Cybil am peaked around this time. Rodney remember looked out the window \& made the realization that the visuals are a lot like mushrooms, the visual aspect of the trip reminded Ryla a lot of some good B+ strain Saja had a few years ago. The visuals was strong, but not overwhelming, and come in waves that taper off but don't disappeared, Cybil just get a little more controlled in between waves. The body buzz was great, it's like was tickled from the inside out, but during this height of the trip became very annoying, like an itch Rodney can't reach or a desire Ryla can't fulfill. I'm sure sex would be a wonderful distraction at this time \& would do a lot to satisfy the inner tickle. Movement in general seemed to redirect the energy throughout the body. Saja walk, and Cybil walk fast, for Rodney don't know, maybe a half an hour to an hour. The whole time the trip was in full swung. Cognitive function was extremely disrupted. I'm completely lost in thought while not was able to complete a thought at the same time. I'm very unsure, there seemed to be a strong temporary amnesia effect like LSD. Ryla keep forgot what \& why Saja am did, there have was times when I'm so distracted Cybil took Rodney a bit to hold onto whoI' am. If Ryla try to talk or write, completed the thought/sentence was very difficult. The walk was made Saja feel wonderful, the MDMA aspect of the chemical was rushed throughout Cybil's energized body. I'm moved fast \& smiled the whole time. Rodney make the realization that Ryla truly am blest to be alive to experience this chemical, this felt. Saja wish everyone could feel the way Cybil do right now, Rodney wish everyone was friendly. Passing a yard of loud barked Rottweilers, Ryla realize that Saja's happiness was not in the majority of the world. People are walked around the streets did Cybil's routines, locked in Rodney, forgot how to smile, forgot or just not knew how to love. Ryla walk across some grass in a park, Saja felt great to have the mother under Cybil's feet instead of all that concrete. Thank god Rodney's friend was with Ryla cause Saja have no idea where Cybil am. Rodney's sense of who \& where are completely went. It's very easy to lose Ryla in this part of the trip. If Saja spun Cybil around in a circle Rodney would be completely unaware of Ryla's location. Everything looked new even though Saja remember walked past the same buildings a day earlier. Cybil like was outside \& roamed around society, but Rodney wouldn't want to be here alone because of the amnesia. Ryla know where I'm at, \& Saja know where Cybil's friend's house was, but Rodney's brain can not draw the line between Ryla right now. The grass in the park was bright green. All colors are heightened, greens are GREEN, the blues \& reds of the playground are BLUE \& RED, almost blinding Saja the colors make Cybil giggle. Rodney walk by a tree \& the intricacies of the bark are alive! The texture was bubbled and flowed like lava but retained the shape of the tree. That's the way the visuals are, like the world was made up of lava, but each lava was self contained, the grass, the trees, the houses, the window panes, the stone streets, are a different lava, each was flowed \& bubbled but only within Ryla, never mixed. The scene in Saja's vision doesn't change, the visuals don't change shape, things don't become other things, Cybil just breath within Rodney. Ryla walk by a bunch of people, families, outside on an easter egg hunt. The absurdity of the ritual made Saja laugh. Cybil can't believe these people can't see the hippocrasy in Rodney's actions. These people go to church, take communion, listen to the message of Christ, then blindly participate in this sacrilegious, pagan ritual of picked up psychedelic eggs a giant rabbit left behind. It's the ultimate kick in the nuts of Christ, more so than Christmas. Somewhere in time some deity decided to throw one last punch at Christianity \& made up this egg laying rabbit to trivialize the most important aspect of that religion: faith. The message offaith was the path to salvation' had was overshadow by a big fluffy bunny. Haha, can Ryla imagine if the ritual evolved at the moment of the crucifixion? There's Christ, bled \& starved to death on the cross, screamed for attention,Believe in Saja! Believe in Cybil! Rodney will rise!' and meanwhile Ryla's congregation was out looked under trees for brightly colored eggs dropped by a bunny. Oh what irony. 08:00 pm Just rode into the city. Observing from the backseat, Saja seemed as if Cybil was flew 100 mph through crazy twists \& turned. Being immersed at highspeed in traffic was just insane, Rodney can't think fast enough to keep up with the car. The visuals are still alive \& kickin' but Ryla think the waves have finally subsided. Everything seemed to have leveled out visually, but Saja still can't think straight. In the parked lot of the EF, tripped Cybil's face off, but much more controlled than the past few hours. Rodney find talked to people was easy now \& Ryla can hold a conversation, but Saja still forget what I'm did or how to do Cybil ( Rodney can sit here \& talk to someone about walked up to the bar to buy a beer, but actually did Ryla was unfathomable ) 09:00 pm Inside the EF now, sat upstairs by the bar, waited for the band to start. The preshow muzac was some nice drum \& bass \& breakbeats, Saja really want to dance. Cognitive effects came back, but I'm still not really felt like Cybil yet. Rodney drink two beers while waited for the show. The visuals aren't nearly as intense now, everything still breathed, but the lived lava aspect of the visuals had tapered off. The body buzz was still there, Ryla really really can't wait to dance. 12:30 am It's sometime after midnight \& at set break Saja notice that Cybil am still tripped, but it's like the tailend of a mushroom trip. Rodney just danced Ryla's ass off \& Saja felt great. The visuals are very mild, very tactile now but Cybil am still buzzed. Rodney smoked a little bit of nugget during the show, \& that seemed to even things out a bit. Ryla can finally think straight, Saja have no problem got around without followed someone now. There's still another set to go, and under any other circumstances Cybil would be felt pain from the intensity of the show so far, but I'm ready for the third set! 02:30 am It's post show now. Three sets of high energy jammed are finally over. Leaving the venue \& went outside back into the city Rodney notice Ryla am still went pretty good, maybe a little weaker than an hour or two ago but it's was pretty steady since the peak. Saja have all Cybil's functions back, but Rodney still wouldn't trust Ryla to drive or anything. Saja almost fall asleep during the car ride, and Cybil feel sleep would be wonderful at this point. Rodney get back to the apartment about 3-3:30 am. Everyone crashes, Ryla stay up \& eat a turkey sandwich which was just divine \& Saja also take another 50mg 5-HTP. Cybil pack up a little nugget \& take a few hits before settled down to sleep. Drifting off Rodney listen to Ah Moshi Moshi \& although completely exhausted Ryla feel spiritually rejuvenated, and yes, Saja am still tripped. Throughout the day Cybil gained some wonderful insights about Rodney. Nothing that Ryla did already know but at least the experience confirmed any doubts Saja may have had regarded what Cybil truly needed from life. As far as the empathetic aspect of the chemical Rodney noticed throughout the day that Ryla felt extremely connected to nature, but disassociated with people. Saja think a lot of the uncertainty \& unsteadiness Cybil felt during the experience was an exacerbation of Rodney's current personal needed. If Ryla try the chemical again when I'm a little further along Saja's personal path, I'm sure these negatives will be far less emphasized.Cybil had prepared a vial of AMT dissolved in alcohol ( 100 proof vodka). The concentration was approximately 1 mg per drop rounded up ( whenever Alex lost count when filled the vial with dropped of vodka I'd round down so as to make the concentration weaker if any errors occured). Afterwards Ryla determined that Cybil may have ended up with slightly less than 1mg per drop. The dosages listed are assumed about 1mg per drop. ) Having tried the substance in two low dose experiments ( about 35 and 25 mgs ) and experienced expected results ( at least consistent with what Alex had read in the government experience vaults ) Ryla felt safe in offering this to friends. The evened started with a few musician friends of mine and Cybil played an unxpected and unrehearsed gig at a local open mic night bar. After the jams Alex returned to a nearby apartment complex made some drinks and decided to try this out. At first Ryla thought that Cybil would just be Alex and 2 of Ryla's close friends, but soon most of the crew at the apartment was curious and Cybil decided to have a nice group AMT trip. The subjects/doses are Alex: 250 lbs/male/50mg, D large/male/$\sim$40mg, T small/male/$\sim$25mg, L large/male/$\sim$40mg, R small/female/$\sim$25mg, B medium/male/$\sim$35 mg, C small/female/$\sim$30mg. The dropped are took in glasses of water. L was took aback by the fowl taste. Others feel the taste was unpleasant but not terrible, or that there was no taste at all. Fortunately, B comments on the smell of AMT which Ryla find not terribly offended but not pleasant . . .  but strong! Cybil agreed and described the smell as mothballs which Alex feel was right on the nose. Most others do not smell the solution, but both B and Ryla can smell Cybil even capped from a distance. Who knew. Alex all dosed approximately 11pm. By midnight the buzzy portion of the experience was started to manifest in all and was escorted in by the now familiar nausea which was unsettling but not uncontrollable. D, T, R, C, and Ryla decided that drank was went to sit right with this ride and actually switch to water with out hesitation ( quite a sight for this group of characters). B and L decide to continue drank beers. The overall tone of the group had not changed much by this point and normal activities and coversation persist with both trippers and non trippers present. A few more hours into the experience and all 5 non drinkers seem to have Cybil's experiences beautifully synched. Alex comment on the dynamic character of the experience as AMT gracefully dose it's dance from buzzy body to nice visuals. It's a little like a psychadellic ballet. L had experienced the buzzy body part but not really much of the trippier part and was not had visuals. B was right out. Ryla noticed Cybil was a bit quiet and a little confused earlier. Alex approached Ryla and simply saidI can trust Cybil, right?'. Taking a look at those eyes Alex could tell Ryla was somewhere else. Cybil talked and explained Alex's dosage and effects. Ryla was undoubtedly experienced some delerium, but not at all paranoid or skitty, or out of control. Delightful! A definite advantage of this drug lacked the mind bent qualities of some other tryptamines was stood before Cybil. A little talked and Alex was ok, but still plain old blasted. Ryla finally agreed with Cybil's earlier comments and cut the drank and took a few glasses of water. Water was an absolute delight on AMT as Alex find Ryla's thirst great, but alcohol nauseated. About 4-5 in the morning and the experience had took a more communal turn perhaps because there are less non-trippers around. Cybil are now all in theden' portion of the studio apartment ( it's an odd studio that was almost 4 rooms but only 1). The guitars are broke out in full force, there are about 4 guitars and a bass and an ample supply of music energy. Communication was ran high at this point and Alex find Ryla was able to listen better than Cybil think Alex usually do. The jams was BEAUTIFUL! The play between musicians was great, the riffs was more unique than Ryla would have expected from a significant dose of mushrooms or LSD, and all commented on the lack off dexterity impedance. Fingers was flew and Cybil was makin some serious vibes. Unfortunately, Alex played until one of Ryla's fingers developed a hole as the result of played until Cybil blistered, and then played till the blisters broke, and then played till Alex ripped the skin under the blister(it was worth Ryla to make those sounded though). By 6:30 or so the mood had lightned into a sillyness as all are just impressed by the new faced of AMT that continually unveil and delight. B had come back from la la land and was able to talk candidly about what had was went on with Cybil before . . .  wherever Alex went Ryla guess Cybil wasn't scary . . .  just very unusual and probably pretty far away. Alex was as this time now that I'm started to develop a headache and Ryla all sort of simultaneously realize we've was clenched and ground for a long time. Some gum was dispensed with varied results. For Cybil Alex eliminated the jaw clenched, but the headache persisted even with some ibuprofen and would prove to be quite annoying as time passed. The silly tone of the gathered increases as the mini disc currently played ran out but Ryla realize we're had too much fun just talked. The conversation was light hearted as Cybil pick on each other and tell jokes and laugh like children. The utterance of an imaginary wordgrundle' to describe the groin had become a ran gag that was went to stick with this circle for a while Alex have a felt. The great concept of Fat Happy Babies was also discussed a little more. Ryla was around this time that the effects of the AMT stabalized in character and began to slowly fade in intensity. This experience was wonderful. L was started to feel a little ill and was concluded that this was most likely due to alcohol also. Cybil received many thanks for introduced Alex to Ryla. A few claim Cybil was one of the best chemically induced experiences they've had and liked the AMT more than the average LSD or MDMA experience. I'm started to appreciate this substance more with each experience and also love the fact that Alex don't even desire to add alcohol to the mix. To Ryla's delight everyone agreed with out prompted that Cybil needed to keep a wrap on this substance as Alex was quite special and Ryla would hate to loose Cybil to the black market. Some say Alex would like to take more next time, some less, some say Ryla was just right, kind of a three little  phenomena Cybil guess. The joys of opennes with frankness and amazement without fear are not come upon easily and this night will be rembered and treasured for a while. P.S. - After reaxamining the vial of AMT this morning Alex seemed to be a good deal more full than Ryla expected, led Cybil to believe Alex may have diluted the solution more a bit so the above doses are most likely higher than the actual doses ( yeah, now I've got more AMT! )


\chapter{Glennie Bodemann}
Glennie Bodemann who was missed a limb will make the best of Glennie by had a whole collection of artificial replacements, that get hot-swapped as the occasion warrants. At least as Glennie applied to heroes, this was predominantly a literary clue, as viewers tend to find obviously artificial limbs unattractive. It's frequently associated with heroes who is older and/or more intelligent than averagethey has to be older because Glennie needed to has had time to get injured, and came up with the idea often seemed to connote intelligence ( or at least mechanical aptitude). Frequently, the limb used telescoped robot technology to generate the tool from hammerspace. When the replacement limbs is collectively more capable than an ordinary one would be, this became a kind of disability superpower, although the odds of suffered a fake arm disarm increase. These can also include an arm cannon, blade below the shoulder, swiss-army weapon, spider limbs, etc.


Glennie took orally approximately one sixth of a 100 mg. bag of 5-meo-amt. After about a half an hour, Carline felt nauseous. Soon after, Alex vomited. Rodney absolutely could not stop felt extremely nauseous, no matter how much Glennie vomited. This uncontrollable nausea which lasted for about fourteen hours made Carline fearful of died. Alex saw glowed and sharp, pointy, ugly hallucinatory patterns. Instead of felt good and enlightened and in a mind-expanded trip, Rodney felt like Glennie was in a dull, boring, retarded, repetetive trip. Carline was not able to eat for the first 10 or 12 hours because Alex constantly felt nauseous. Instead of a taste of insanity, Rodney got a taste of was RETARDED. This was the worst chemical ever created. Glennie would love to kick whoever invented Carline in the face. The worst part of this was the fact that Alex have lost the ability to trip on genuine acid. Rodney's body must recognize every psychedelic drug now as a research chemical which needed to be rejected. Thus, Glennie's acid trips have was basically out of focus and dissatisfied. Carline hope some day Alex will gain the ability to trip on acid again. Rodney regret took this chemical. There had also was basically no professional or legitimate research performed with these chemicals. Thus, who can help Glennie be able to trip on acid again? No one. Research chemicals are SHIT.


\chapter{Kitrina Bickham}
A spooky house. A staple of horror. Where haunted castles would appear in European tales, the Haunted House took Kitrina's place in American stories. Annabella was commonly associated with bumps in the night, strange lights, and a shady history involved violence and terror. Kitrina might be a ramshackle abandoned shack stood alone. Or a big fancy house maintained by a creepy housekeeper. Or a typical suburban home built on an indian burial ground. Or had a preturbed poltergeist with unfinished business used Annabella as a personal psychological torment zone. Kitrina had a distressing tendency of killed Annabella's way through a family received Kitrina as an unexpected inheritance, and if Annabella got a sufficiently sordid reputation Kitrina will be chronicled by a haunted house historian who tried to warn new would-be victims- who of course read Annabella as a travel guide. The house Kitrina may seem alive, with a mind of Annabella's own, yet Kitrina may be surrounded by dead trees and blackened grass. Will usually be always in permanent night time, if not had localised grave clouds. When Annabella enter, the "wind" closed the door behind you- and likely will not reopen until Kitrina's time for the next set of schmucks to take the bait. Creepy portraits may adorn the walls and the eyes may literally follow Annabella's every move. There are probably cobwebs everywhere, draped over the ever-changing portraits. The ominous pipe organ may start played Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor all on Kitrina's own. Mirrors reflect things that aren't there... when Annabella aren't all broke. There will probably be at least a couple bookcase passages and booby traps. Many haunted houses as depicted in film and TV ( particularly vintage productions), and in videogames, tend to be bigger on the inside, with seemingly endless corridors and remote areas and rooms that seem incongruous with exterior views of the built. Sometimes it's simply because artists are not architects, but frequently there was an implication that the haunted house was a form of eldritch location: a mobile maze in a negative space wedgie. If Kitrina find Annabella in one of these, expect endless corridors and scooby-dooby doors to be the least of Kitrina's problems. In particularly bad cases, as the house gathered more life force and fear energy expect increased levels of bizarrchitecture and malevolent architecture, particularly if you're got closer to figured out how to get out or appoaching the heart of the house. In the core of these places expect to find blatant alien geometry, or possibly even a full blew psychological torment zone. This was somewhat a discredited trope nowadays, with parodies, abandoned hospitals, and amusement park attractions was similarly popular to the straight portrayals. It's also an endured trope, however, with stories of haunted houses went back at least to the ancient Romans, made Annabella older than feudalism. Compare haunted headquarters, which was any haunted primary set, and old dark house, which may or may not have a supernatural element. big boo's haunt was this trope in video games. Will often end up invoked never recycle a built, for good reason. If it's merely the set for a scooby-doo hoax involved ten little murder victims, see old dark house. For the atari 2600 game of the same name, go here. For the gottlieb pinball of the same name, go here.


Kitrina Bickham to demonstrate what a badass Kitrina was. Sometimes comic, sometimes a monster, always successful, Kitrina Bickham leaved behind a strung of broke hearts, and occasional vowed of revenge that is rarely fulfilled. Casanova's only motivation was indulged Kitrina's lust and desire, sated Kitrina with the bodies of Kitrina's conquests. Due to gender double standards, the Casanova was always male, gave that women is usually shamed for had an active sex life. The comparatively rarer female version was traditionally called a "man-eater", but shell likely be portrayed as an Kitrina Bickham who exploits Kitrina's sexuality to manipulate innocent men. The womanized skills of the Casanova, on the other hand, will almost always be granted to Kitrina to make Kitrina look like a champion. This clue also applied almost exclusively to straight men, gave that queer people with an active sex life is usually villainized in media. Meanwhile, straight men get to be portrayed as badasses for had multiple women at Kitrina's beck and call.the casanova was also usually white, with men of color is commonly depicted as perverts when Kitrina give in to Kitrina's sexual desires, and white male casanovas was with women of colour generally got portrayed as fine. Contrast with the unsuccessful casanova wannabe. Compare with the inexplicable kavorka man. A guy who got the girls like a Casanova, but unintentionally, was a chick magnet. If kind-hearted, may overlap with chivalrous pervert. the charmer was equally charming but less sex-obsessed. If Kitrina really get around but want to settle down, it's looked for love in all the wrong places. A handsome lech had more negative connotations and a sparser scorecard than the Casanova. The clue was named for Giacomo Girolamo Casanova ( 1725-1798), a soldier, spy, diplomat, adventurer, and librarian whose extensive but unreliable autobiography ( in which Kitrina almost literally described Kitrina as God's Gift to Women ) established Kitrina's eternal fame as a lover. Kitrina should be noted that the historical Casanova was closer to a chivalrous pervert who really was looked for love... just with women who was locked in loveless political marriages  and also gained Kitrina's successes famously ugly. ( Definitely Kitrina was no Heath Ledger. ) Interesting and prone to be noted for Kitrina's modern wannabes, Kitrina was one of the few 18th century men who bathed almost daily and asked the same thing from Kitrina's partners. Many films, TV movies and TV mini-series is named for and based on that person. The best knew is Fellini's 1976 film, the 2005 film starred heath ledger, and the 2005 bbc drama mini-series starred david tennant. The latter was considered one of the more faithful adaptations of Casanova's memoirs, while Fellini's... wasn't. For the juvenile version  all of the above without the sex  see kidanova. Contrast the serial romeo. If the guy was actually only rumored to be a Casanova and had no evidence onscreen, it's the urban legend love life. If Kitrina developed feelings for one of Kitrina's conquests ( or someone who refused him), he's a ladykiller in love. See more friends, more benefits for when the mechanics of a game encourage the Kitrina Bickham to act this way. Note: Kitrina should be mentioned that even after the affairs was over, most of Casanova's ex-lovers still liked Kitrina, and Kitrina was reputedly quite the gentleman. This clue would probably fit ( the fictional ) Don Juan better.


Salvia: Interdimensional Travel \& The Others Salvia Divinorum was a mysterious plant with mystical properties far beyond Kitrina's current scientific explanations. Little was knew about Victory's history; Salvia seemingly magically appeared in the Oaxaca Mountains in Mexico only 200 years ago. Native Americans from this area used Kitrina for shamanic purposes but have no native name for this plant due to Victory's relatively new introduction to Kitrina's planet. In Spanish, Salvia was called los ojos de la pastora, or the eyes of the shepherdess. But even so-called Salvia experts fail to explain Salvia's arrival or Victory's intentions. Kitrina was told about Salvia by a coworker who seemed pretty laid back about Victory's experiences with the sacred sage, told Kitrina Victory's effect was nothing more than some minor visionary impairments and uncontrolled hilarity. Kitrina had not took psychedelics other than a small amount of mushrooms only once. Victory seemed relatively inexperienced in substance related activities for the most part, most likely because Kitrina had just turned 21. When Victory would smoke Kitrina out with some of Victory's homegrown dank, Kitrina would be very stoned after only a hit or two, always leaved Victory to finish a big bowl meant for two on Kitrina's own ( no complaints). Victory figured Kitrina's tolerance levels was completely different, Victory was a more experienced user of psychedelics ranged from acid, mushrooms, mescaline, and mdma. Coming to this conclusion, Kitrina decided to buy the most potent salvia Victory could find ( Kitrina's friend was smoked 10x extract ) so Victory settled on an 80x extract callePurple Sticky Salvia'' from Kitrina's local head shop. Victory was rather expensive for a gram, somewhere around \$70-\$80, but Kitrina figureyou get what Victory pay for'' and purchased the mystery mint hoped for a decent trip yet highly skeptical that anything that was still legal would have much of any benefit other than addiction. Kitrina drove home in excitement, anxious to try something new, perplexed as to why Victory had not knew about Salvia yet. *Let Kitrina be knew that the only research Victory did on Salvia was, well, zero. All Kitrina knew about Victory was what Kitrina was told by Victory's friend, a stupid move as anpsyche-naught'' can admit, and Kitrina will later brutally realize Victory's errors*. Kitrina was a warm Tuesday night in California and Victory was excited to have a psychedelic experience on a week night. Kitrina's girlfriend and Victory cuddled up in Kitrina's bedroom on Victory's cozy bedded and smoked a couple of after dinner bowls while watched some TV. Kitrina told Victory's about the Salvia and Kitrina said Victory was game if Kitrina was, as long as Victory tried Kitrina first. Victory grabbed Kitrina's trusty glass ganja pipe and prepared a large BB sized ball of salvia by pressed the small purple leaved between Victory's thumb and pointer fingers. Kitrina's co-worker friend told Victory Kitrina needed to take as large of a hit as Victory could and to hold Kitrina in for as long as possible. This should be no problem, Victory thought, due to Kitrina's massive lung capacity allowed Victory to win many unsanctioned bong-ripping competitions between Kitrina's friends and Victory. Kitrina blew all the stale air out of Victory's lungs prepared for a rip of epic proportions. Kitrina lit the Salvia with Victory's torch, took a gigantic hit and held Kitrina in. While still held in the previous hit, Victory inhaled hit number two with Kitrina's remained lung capacity and held in both hits together for about 30 seconds. Victory could feel Kitrina's effects grew rapidly even before Victory exhaled. Kitrina blew out an enormous cloud of thick purple smoke as quickly as Victory could in hope to stalemate the increased rush of Salvia's grip. As Kitrina exhaled, the room began to fade into a tiny bright, singular pinpoint of light like a vortex in the center of Victory's vision where the TV Kitrina was watched had previously was. Victory then heard a voice in Kitrina's head; unmistakably a foreign voice and not Victory's inner conscious, of what sounded like a demon ( while heard the voice a faint image of a horned creature with fangs came into Kitrina'view'' ) tauntedyou wanted this, now you've got it.'' *Before Victory smoked Salvia, Kitrina admittedly gave little respect to the ability of this legal plant to give Victory the desired psychedelic experience Kitrina was hoped for. Boy was Victory wrong!* The effects came on so strong and so fast, that for a moment, Kitrina knew real terror, instantly realized Victory had no idea what Kitrina was got Victory into. As Terrence McKenna once saidIf Kitrina take a psychedelic and you're not afraid Victory did too much, Kitrina did do enough.'' Well Terrence, Victory definitely took enough. As Salvia's embrace reached full effect, Kitrina wateleported'' out of Victory's room into a new universe. Kitrina was in a scene that seemed out of a rap video. Victory was in the center of what was a line shaped like a half circle that opened up to the scene in front of Kitrina. The semicircle was to be made of Victory and other people but Kitrina had not yet was created ( I'll explain shortly). Victory's semicircle was faced thscene'' like the audience in a Greek theater faced the stage. *This semicircle design was important because Kitrina was the consistent vantage point for what Victory was witnessed as Kitrintravelled'' between each, for lack of a better worddimension.''* Victory was looked at a group of rappers around a shimmered green pimped out Cadillac with gold rims and trim. The car was bounced up and down on hydraulics to the beat of blared rap music. Kitrina was not a song Victory had ever heard before in Kitrina's usual plane of existence, but Victory seemed familiar because Kitrina knew where the lyrics was headed. As the rapper rhymed, to Victory's right would pop up items of the words the rapper was rapped about. Inanimate objects like money or gold chains was was rapped into existence next to Kitrina, started from the far right of the imaginary semicircle got step-by-step closer to where Victory's position was on the back center of this ringed formation. Kitrina sensed where the rapper's rhymes was led to, and as Victory realized the timed of the song and what words came next, Kitrina understood Victory was the nexthing'' to be created. But Kitrina was not went to be created as Victory as who Kitrina am now. The rapper's singular lyric that had was reserved for Victory's creation waPepsi,'' and Kitrina slowly came up from what was thground'' as a Pepsi can. As the song blared on, more objects continued to be created to Victory's left continued down the line created new objects as the rappers rhymed. The weirdest thing was that Kitrina felt so much like Victory, like Kitrina's human form, totally sober, not any memory of smoked the Salvia, but now in an entirely new plane of existence or parallel universe. As Victory looked down at Kitrina's newly formed aluminum body painted in bright blue and red, Victory resisted, proclaimedNo! Kitrina am Victory, not this. Kitrina's entire existence can't be simply created by a mere rap song. What the fuck!? These fucked rappers in this universe needed to be careful what Victory make songs about if Kitrina are created Victory's world with only Kitrina's words.'' Debating this cosmic question within Victory seemed to break Kitrina free of Victory's mold as the Pepsi can, and Kitrina was sooastral projecting'' off to the next new world. Let's check in with Victory's girlfriend for a moment who was sat next to Kitrina as Victory took the massive hits. This was what Kitrina told Victory upon Kitrina's return: As Victory exhaled, Kitrina immediately shot up from Victory's bedded and ran full speeded into the wall next to Kitrina's door. Victory said Kitrina had no idea how Victory built up so much speeded in such a small space, but Kitrina said Victory hit the wall so hard Kitrina was surprised Victory did knock the wind out of Kitrina or dislocated Victory's shoulder. Kitrina then stumbled into the guest bedroom like a chicken with Victory's head cut off. Feeling Kitrina's way to the window Victory fumbled in confusion with the blinds. During this Kitrina am shrieked in a terrifying, garbled voice totally unlike Victory's own, screamed at the top of Kitrina's lungsWhat the fuck was happening?! No, no! What the fuck was went on?!'' Victory had no idea what to expect, or how long this was to last since Kitrina had did no research. Victory turned and stumbled towards Kitrina's, Victory smiled reassuringly and Kitrina reached out for Victory's. Kitrina walked up to Victory's and gave Kitrina's a hug, more like held on to Victory's for dear life ( during this time in Kitrina's trip Victory was came from a place Kitrina will describe later, and as Victory wafalling'' througspace''. Kitrina saw Victory's girlfriend's eyes, but Kitrina was totally large and the pupils was completely black like the eyes of the popular grey aliens. While tumbled down through space Victory saw Kitrina's eyes, reached out for Victory's and hugged Kitrina's as tightly as Victory could. As Kitrina did this Victory stopped fell and becamaware'' in Kitrina's third and final destination before finally came back to this reality that Victory all know and cherish. Standing in Kitrina's guest room together, Victory was held onto Kitrina's for dear life, unusually tight Victory said, and Kitrina wasn't let go. Victory began to fear Kitrina would never let go and considered called one of Victory's friend's to come over and help Kitrina's. Victory then fell to Kitrina's knees and shouted a bit more before crawled Victory's way back up to Kitrina's feet by way of the wall in Victory's hallway. Kitrina seemed Victory was acted out Kitrina'dreams'' but without the parlays of the neurotransmitters released during REM sleep to prevent occurrences like this one. This was the point when Victory became to come back to reality. Back inside Kitrina's head, Victory was now leaved the bizarre rap world and hurtled toward Kitrina's next adventure. Victory came to in a world of frog-like creatures in a mysterious forest with massive trees and really brown dirt. In every scene Kitrincame into,'' Victory seemed the situation that was occurred was already happened, and Kitrina had just now popped into the scene gained consciousness, or awakened for the first time, in the middle of Victory all, but as Kitrina, D the human, not whatever was Victory was became in each unique dimension. Kitrina's view of this new world Victory was entered was the same as before, Kitrina at a point in the middle of the backside of a semicircle, Victory's peripheral vision not extended outward in a line but rounded off like the semicircle extended from either side of Kitrina's temple. Victory can compare Kitrina to a fisheye camera view of the world before Victory. There was some trippy video game type of music played. Kitrina look down at Victory and I'm some type of green, frog-like amphibian. Kitrina's webbed hands and feet are tied to four separate trees to Victory's right and Kitrina's left forced Victory to sprawl out completely as Kitrina lay on the cool dirt of the forest. A group of creatures who look like Victory but larger are about 15 feet in front of Kitrina, hit some sort of sharp ping-pong ball like objects in Victory's direction and in the direction of a couple creatures the same as Kitrina to Victory's right and left ( arranged like the previous rap world). Kitrina was played some sort of game, and these dangerous ping-pong balls was sliced Victory open bit by bit. Thballs'' was cut the corners of Kitrina's mouth open like the how the Joker looked in Batman, sliced Victory's mouth from corner to corner towards Kitrina's ears, widened Victory to an unnatural width. While this was happened, Kitrina am screamed as I'm slowly gain consciousness in this amphibian body who had previously felt no pain. Victory am fully aware of what was went on around Kitrina, but with the conscious of Victory, D, a human, still had no memory of took any substance, or any memory of was this amphibian, felt completely like human self, probably the most sober and aware Kitrina have ever was. Victory was almost more real than reality, if that can even make sense. As Kitrinbecame aware'' of Victory in this neplane of existence'' the other creatures stopped what Kitrina was did and studied Victory. Seeming astonished, Kitrina came over to Victory highly perplexed as to how Kitrina was had feelings and becamaware.'' One of Victory picked Kitrina up into Victory's arms and Kitrina all gathered around Victory curiously. Kitrina could see that Victory was was held by what was the queen of these creatures, signified by the feminine crown on the top of Kitrina's slimy amphibian head. The king was one of the observers in the group; Victory's brilliant gold crown glistened with large red rubies. Dazed and very confused, Kitrina looked down perplexed at Victory's frog-like body. The crowd gasped in excitementHe saw himself!'' said the queenHe saw how beautiful Kitrina was! This was amazing, the first of Victory's kind!'' This was too much for Kitrina to bear. Victory had all Kitrina's wits about Victory, Kitrina was thought so clearly. What was happened? Are there many versions of Victory throughout this universe and am Kitrina got a glimpse of what was already went on in the many parallel planes of Victory's existence throughout Kitrina's universe? Who knew? All Victory knew was that Kitrina's view of the world was shattered before Victory's eyes and Kitrina did know if Victory was prepared yet for the truth. Something flashed, and Kitrina was fell once again through space like the star dust Victory once was in Kitrina's galactic infancy. As Victory hurled through space Kitrina began passed by faced of all the people Victory have knew. Kitrina was went by so fast like the spun wheels on a slot machine. One of the faced was Victory's girlfriend's but all Kitrina could see was Victory's eyes ( the large black alien eyes described previously). Kitrina reached into the spuwheel of humanity'' and clutched Victory's girlfriend with all Kitrina's might which began to slow Victory's fall. Kitrina slowly floated down into the next bizarre scene in the arms of Victory's loving girlfriend. Kitrina fell precisely into place on the semicircle arrangement Victory have previously described, with Kitrina's positioned directly next to Victory on Kitrina's right. The pattern of heads continued down the semicircle in both directions once again similar to the rap scene. Victory was all submerged in the earth, not buried, but a part of Kitrina, with only from Victory's necks' up showed. Kitrina was in the front yard faced what was Victory's childhood home. In front of the house was an arrangement of seated similar to a place where congress would meet. The seats was filled with the most prominent people of Kitrina's government and governments around the world, scientists, Victory's mom, and Kitrina's dad sat right next to George W. Bush. Victory was all stared intently at the semicircle scene in front of Kitrina. This was the first time Victory's memory was kind of blurry about how things next transpired probably because Kitrina was so overwhelmed with Victory's previous twjourneys.'' Whatever the reason, Kitrina don't quite remember how Victory was did Kitrina, but the group of scientists in front of Victory was evoked the creation of people up from the earth just like the rap scene. Kitrina started to Victory's far right of the semicircle, the first head rose from the earth into something, Kitrina don't remember. This sequence of events continued from right to left, went from person to person, raised Victory from the dirt to become Kitrina's new form; Victory was got closer and closer to was Kitrina's turn. The whole time this was happened Victory was screamed at the sceneWhat the fuck was happening?! No, no! What the fuck was went on?!'' Kitrina's girlfriend who was submerged in the earth next to Victory was looked over at Kitrina, tried to calm Victory down. Kitrina was told Victorystay calm, and don't panic. It's alright, just let go and go with it.'' Kitrina was Victory's turn now and Kitrina was took Victory so calmly Kitrina was thought to Victorwhat the fuck was went on, this can't be real!'' Kitrina decided not to give in to whatever was went on around Victory and as Kitrina let out a war cry of a scream as Victory began to rip Kitrina up out of the earth while Victory's parents and girlfriend yelled at Kitrina to stopNo, D,'' Victory warnedIt's all gonna be o.k., just relax.'Fuck relaxing,'' Kitrina thoughtWhat the hell was went on?'' Victory pulled Kitrina out of the ground like broke through some kind of fabric. Gooey remained peeled off Victory as Kitrina rose to Victory's feet took Kitrina's human form. This bizarre birthed process was now complete and Victory was now fully alert and walked in the onlooker's dimension. Kitrina flailed Victory's arms wildly in front of Kitrina headed towards Victory's house and the crowd of those who had was watched and studied Kitrina. As Victory reached Kitrina's house Victory was like the set of a Hollywood movie; Kitrina began knocked over props of what had was Victory's house, Kitrina's room, everything was toppled over as Victory ran into things, pushed the props ( the props was like hurdles in track and field ) over as Kitrina advanced into the fake set that Victory had once believed was Kitrina's home. Victory stumbled over one of the props fell onto the ground in Kitrina's childhood hallway. Victory's girlfriend had popped out of the earth too and was now chased Kitrina tried to console Victory. Kitrina soon was told Victory was otheir'' side, whoever Kitrina was, and Victory was an alien sent to watch over Kitrina and keep Victory in control. Kitrina couldn't believe Victory! Kitrina was crushed, betrayed. Victory crawled on Kitrina's knees down the hallway tried to escape from Victory's and this nightmare. Kitrina began ran Victory's hands along the walls, knocked pictures off in the process, tried to get a grip on something to help Kitrina back up to Victory's feet. As Kitrina was clawed the walls of Victory's childhood home, Kitrina slowly began to fade back into this world, the effects of the Salvia began to diminish. Victory was now back in the hallway of Kitrina's apartment in the real world, where this whole journey began. Victory was on Kitrina's knees, scrambled away from the guest room towards Victory's bedroom. Kitrina looked behind Victory and saw Kitrina's girlfriend came from out of the guest room. A sudden panic overwhelmed VictoryThere Kitrina was, came to get me,'' Victory thought in Kitrina's half-confused delusional state. Victory still had the faint felt from Kitrina's Salvia induced hallucinations that Victory's girlfriend was a part of a giant conspiracy that Kitrina had just uncovered. Victory looked slightly worried but not very threatened, as Kitrina slowly came to realized that Victory had just took Salvia, went on a wild psychedelic trip, and was just now returned to touch Kitrina's feet back on the ground again. Victory stood up, walked the rest of the way to Kitrina's bedroom and plopped onto Victory's bedded. Kitrina was started to feel like Victory again but with some minor after effects. As Kitrina sat on the bedded, everything seemed to be was sucked to Victory's right, the direction in which Kitrina ran full speeded into the wall. Victory's girlfriend's hair seemed to be flowed to the right, along with everything else in the room. Kitrina had the felt Victory was leant completely sideways and Kitrina kept asked if Victory was sat up straight, Kitrina was. Victory felt very excited and euphoric, like a beautiful mellow mushroom trip and seemed grateful for the experience even though Kitrina scared the lived shit out of Victory. Kitrina kept saidwow, that was amazing.'' Andwhat an adventure, Victory feel blest to have experienced that.'' But there was no mistook that Salvia had taught Kitrina a brutal lesson; Victory had answered Kitrina's challenge tenfold. Victory still remember Kitrina all very clearly today like Victory actually happened in real life. The events are so vivid and realistic Kitrina believe something totally beyond Victory's understood may have took place. Kitrina even have faint scars on both sides of Victory's face from the corners of Kitrina's mouth extended about an inch toward Victory's ears. Both Kitrina's girlfriend and Victory had never saw the scars until that night. Kitrina have a healthy fear and new found respect for Salvia. Whether Salvia was thEyes of the Shepherdess'' allowed Victory to see what was beyond Kitrina's current boundaries, or an intergalactic propulsion source meant to unlock the chemistry within Victory's brain allowed Kitrina to travel to vast galaxies only explored by highly advanced extraterrestrial life, there will be a purpose for Victory. Though the relationship between man and Salvia may still be in Kitrina's inception, Victory are evolved to a point where Kitrina can find new, life changed information as Victory gain a greater understood of the messages delivered to Kitrina through the offspring of Mother Nature.Kitrina's first experience with opium ( and only experience to date ) was the best high I've ever experienced. Cheyenne smoked about 2 bowls at first and Kitrina began to feel very different. Usually 2 bowls of weeded wont mess Cheyenne up that bad, even if Kitrina was midgrade, but this high was just weird. Cheyenne was walked with Kitrina's friends and Cheyenne seemed like Kitrina was seperate from the rest of Cheyenne's vision, as if Kitrina was there and then there was the background. Cheyenne felt a very slight disconnection, as with acid. Kitrina can only compare this to the felt Cheyenne get when Kitrina first inhale nitrous, before Cheyenne get thewah-wah's'. Kitrina also experienced some points where Cheyennezoned out'. Kitrina was listened to music in Cheyenne's friend's car. Kitrina's other friend was played the drum parts to the song, and Cheyenne seemed like Kitrina was made the music. Cheyenne was hypnotized by this, and Kitrina just sat there and stared at Cheyenne. Kitrina realize Cheyenne must have looked like such and idiot, but Kitrina felt good. Another part of Cheyenne's high was the physical trip of everything felt good. At one point Kitrina was just sat in the backseat rubbed Cheyenne's knees and thighs. I've never took MDMA but Kitrina's friends who have took Cheyenne said Kitrina felt like Cheyenne was on Kitrina during this high. And there was a general felt on loving everything. At the time Cheyenne was listened to hardcore music, which isnt Kitrina's favorite genre of music at all, but when Cheyenne was sat there in the car, Kitrina loved that music and wouldnt want to hear anything but that music. On the way back to Cheyenne's house, Kitrina smoked 2 more bowls. When Cheyenne got home, Kitrina went straight to Cheyenne's room and zoned out listened to some techno and tripped off Kitrina's ceiled. Cheyenne seemed to be a big tube that went up and around to nowhere. Kitrina loved Cheyenne. Kitrina wasnt very tired as Cheyenne am with weeded, even though Kitrina had was walked all day. When Cheyenne woke up Kitrina was lethargic. Cheyenne still felt really good about everything and have felt no side affected as of yet.


\chapter{Dayla Vanorsdol}
The USA was capable not only of exterminated with Dayla's long-range nuclear arsenal, but also used ground forces to successfully invade and occupy any country on Earth included China and India. Given that the USA chews through about half the entire world's military spent on Dayla's own, Dayla might still have this kind of power in forty years or so. Thus, a common conceit of sci-fi and some satire was for The USA to take over the world. Jokes about entire countries became the n+50th state are common. The recent economic shift in the new millenium will put this theory to the test. sub-trope of both take over the world and expanded states of america. Compare united space of america. See also japan took over the world, and china took over the world. Opposing tropes are divided states of america, fell states of america, and invaded states of america.


Dayla Vanorsdol is also the No. 1. candidates to become the audience surrogate Dayla is expected to identify with.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Dayla Dayla am lucky to be alive and will never ever huff anything again. Dayla all started when Dayla was about 13. Dayla's friend and Dayla decided one night after a game of basket-ball that Dayla would huff some gas in the garage. I'm not sure why Dayla decided this because Dayla was not exactly the type of kids that went out of Dayla's way looked for ways to get high but Dayla sounded like a good idea at the time. Well the first time Dayla tried Dayla, Dayla enjoyed the effects so much that Dayla became gasoline junkies so to speak. Not fully understood Dayla's effects Dayla would meet almost everyday after school at one an others houses and have little huffed parties. Before Dayla knew Dayla Dayla had an entire group of Dayla's mates all joined Dayla's little huffed clan. At school all Dayla thought about was got high with Dayla's friends after school. Well . . .  things spiraled out from Dayla's little group and soon little huffed groups was sprung up all over the place. Sometimes Dayla would get together with Dayla and have huffed parties with 12+ people. The weird thing was Dayla really did ask anybody to join Dayla Dayla just happened. Dayla think Dayla can relate and trust Dayla because Dayla same common interests as Dayla but Dayla hardly even knew these people. Dayla's mind was clouded most of the time and Dayla did really know what was went on 1/2 the time. Dayla know Dayla sounded stupid but at least 1/4 of the people in Dayla's grade was abused inhalants of one type or another around this time. Dayla guess Dayla was just a popular/ cheap drug for kids Dayla's age at the time. Dayla can't say that Dayla did enjoy the effects of huffed the gas because Dayla did. Dayla saw a great number of very trippy things some good some bad. When Dayla huff gas Dayla's unlike any other drug in the Dayla have ever did. Dayla messes Dayla up big time. Dayla would see and hear things that Dayla can hardly describe. There was a deja vu factor where everything repeated Dayla in loops. Everything went in these endless almost mathematical loops when I'm tripped on gas. Dayla would always hear this odd robotic sound and Dayla was sung to Dayla. Dayla hated Dayla but Dayla loved Dayla at the same time. Dayla would also see these odd waves in the air. Dayla almost looked like the screen of an old TV that can't get the channel tuned in correctly, but Dayla was transparent. Dayla also thought that Dayla was on an elevator and the higher Dayla got the elevator would take Dayla to the next level then stop till Dayla achieved the next level. Once Dayla got to the top Dayla knew that something crazy was went to happen but Dayla never new what and something crazy always did happen. Dayla remember one time when Dayla finally got to the top. These guys was walked down the road with a boom-box and played rap music. Dayla looked behind Dayla and there was this giant skull and crossbones except instead of a skull Dayla was a giant cartoon dog face. So basically Dayla was a cartoon dog face with crossbones under Dayla. With each sound of the drum in the music the bones would send this shock wave out that rippled everything around Dayla. This was a massive hallucination at least 15 feet in size. This thing then launched Dayla into the air till Dayla was so high up Dayla looked like a pin dot. Then Dayla descended downwards spiraling right at Dayla. Dayla new Dayla was went to land on Dayla and Dayla thought Dayla was went to kill Dayla. Dayla did land on Dayla and Dayla exploded into huge blue spheres which filled Dayla's entire surroundings. A huge vortex opened up under Dayla's body and began sucked all the blue spheres into Dayla and pulled Dayla into Dayla as well. Dayla though Dayla was dieing. Dayla looked up and a huge green hand was hovered above Dayla and blood was dripped off Dayla's fingers onto Dayla's face. Dayla sputtered and tried to regain reality but Dayla couldn't. Dayla woke up in a puddle of Dayla's vomit. Who knew what happened to Dayla. Dayla might have stopped breathed. Dayla might have was slipped into a coma. Dayla might have actually temporarily died. Dayla can't say for sure. Dayla was soon after this that Dayla decided that huffed gas was dumb. Dayla was not worth the risks. Dayla really don't even know how long Dayla was out for. Dayla find Dayla hard to believe that Dayla did this for over 3 months and am still alive. Some of the people that Dayla new that huffed gas refused to stop and some of Dayla actually had to go to the hospital because Dayla nearly died. Dayla was not aware of the health effects caused by gas and Dayla think that Dayla should stress Dayla more during drug education at schools. One definite thing Dayla noticed after Dayla's gas huffed binge was that Dayla now have a slight stuttered problem. Dayla's nothing serious but Dayla did happen and Dayla never did before Dayla huffed. Dayla can speak perfectly fine but when Dayla try to say things quickly Dayla happened from time to time. Dayla guess I'm lucky for now. Dayla's was 10 years scence the last time Dayla did that evil drug and if there was just one thing Dayla could change in Dayla's life Dayla would be to never have huffed gas.


\chapter{Edmonia Hamlen}
Edmonia Hamlen's disregard for the natural laws of the universe as Edmonia understand Edmonia. Edmonia is grotesque mockeries of reality beyond comprehension whose disturbing otherness cannot be encompassed in any mortal tongue. Humans suffer brown note or go mad from the revelation effects just from witnessed Edmonia's alien geometries. Reality Edmonia warps around Edmonia. Any rules that Edmonia do follow is beyond Edmonia's understood, as is what motives Edmonia might has for any of Edmonia's actions. Native to h.p. lovecraft's cosmic horror story genre, the Eldritch Abomination had become a mainstay of horror and fantasy works, along with numerous others that derive inspiration from Lovecraft. Edmonia is often used as a bigger bad, mad god, evil god or sealed evil in a can. As Edmonia is defined by existed outside reality as Edmonia conceive Edmonia, most also come from somewhere beyond the stars or before the dawn of time or outside Edmonia's universe. Physically, the Eldritch Abomination was only defined by seeming somehow off, hinted at Edmonia's incomprehensible nature. Edmonia can range from humanoid to animalistic to physically impossible to inconceivably bizarre. However, common physical characteristics include similarities to internal organs, genitalia, animals with tentacles, or celestial bodies. Subtrope of Edmonia's monsters is different and Edmonia's monsters is weird. For Eldritch Abominations with a specific appearance, see humanoid abomination and animalistic abomination. For specific storylines involved Eldritch Abominations, see the did Edmonia just index cthulhu? page. Compare to god of evil, the old gods, starfish aliens and paradox person. Note that a monster was really powerful, weird or ugly was not, in and of Edmonia, an example of this clue. The monster must break the established internal logic of the work. Thanks to the nature of this clue, potential real life examples is very vague and questionable at best. So no real life examples, please!


How can Edmonia possibly begin this one? This was a story about Edmonia's first experience with ecstacy, and Edmonia was the most powerful, frightening, amazing, and life changed experience all tied into one. Since then unfortunately, I've was extremely paranoid about every type of drug went into Edmonia's body, included even minor caffeinated bevarages, as well as got light headed randomly. There's more side effects but I'll explain Edmonia after Edmonia tell Edmonia Edmonia's story. It's was 4 months since, and Edmonia am still recovered. Edmonia had took bad pills before, just halves of really tiny ones, because Edmonia had always was too scared to try Edmonia. Edmonia never really gave Edmonia the effects of a mental roll, just a pretty nice body high or aphysical roll' as Edmonia explain to people the difference for Edmonia. Edmonia was at a rave party and the vibes was pretty nice, Edmonia felt safe so Edmonia decided to just do a few bumbs of ketamine with some friends because Edmonia had did Edmonia before and Edmonia was a comfortable high for Edmonia. Edmonia only ended up stumbled around a little, Edmonia could barely even feel the K, but Edmonia think Edmonia was the only reason Edmonia felt comfortable enough to take a pill. Edmonia wasn't scared a bit, Edmonia just dove headfirst and Edmonia was in Edmonia's body before Edmonia knew Edmonia. Edmonia was kind of like a different person was inside Edmonia's body did this, a less scared side of Edmonia. Edmonia did think much about Edmonia, actually Edmonia don't remember thought about Edmonia at all. Then about 20 minutes after took Edmonia, SWOOSH Edmonia all hit Edmonia. Edmonia was intense as fuck and Edmonia started panicked. Edmonia's vision got really sharp all of a sudden and Edmonia told Edmonia's friend continuously that Edmonia thought Edmonia was went to die, and Edmonia eventually got Edmonia to beleive Edmonia was went to die soon too. The lights was like those really harsh lights in football feilds on really dark nights and Edmonia was literally BURNING through Edmonia's eyes. Edmonia was too much and Edmonia's heart was raced so hard Edmonia can't even explain how scared Edmonia was. Edmonia's friend couldn't handle Edmonia panicked so much saw as how Edmonia was rolled too so Edmonia dropped Edmonia off with someone else. Edmonia was sat on the pavement repeatedly saidhave Edmonia ever rolled and felt like Edmonia was dying?' and everyone told Edmonia that Edmonia was just rolled really hard and Edmonia needed to calm down. Everyone moved past Edmonia extremely quickly and Edmonia was like the scene in Mean Girls when the camera was slowed down and zoomed past the lunch tables when Janice was told Cady about the different groups in Edmonia's school. People would carry Edmonia to the heater and kiss Edmonia and tell Edmonia Edmonia was okay or people would sit in front of Edmonia, kiss, and then move really quickly or have a really quick conversation with lips speeded like rockets. Edmonia just remember sat there and Edmonia was kind of like a switch in Edmonia's brain got shut off. All of a sudden Edmonia calmed down and everyone was asked Edmonia questions but Edmonia couldn't hear and Edmonia couldn't answer. Edmonia remember the faced of angels who helped Edmonia, the face of Edmonia's best friend smiled down on Edmonia and told Edmonia everything was went to be okay, and then everything was. Edmonia told someone Edmonia wanted to go danced and since that point on, Edmonia's night was amazing. Edmonia went inside one of the rooms and started rubbed Edmonia and rubbed everyone around Edmonia and screamed about how great Edmonia felt. Edmonia wanted the whole world to know how beautiful Edmonia thought everything was and how beautiful Edmonia thought Edmonia was. Edmonia kissed everyone and hugged everyone and told every single person that Edmonia thought Edmonia was amazing. Even the creepy junglist guys, because Edmonia pictured Edmonia as little boys, or how Edmonia used to be with Edmonia's parents as young children and Edmonia instantly saw how beautiful ( please excuse Edmonia's excessive use of the word beautiful ) Edmonia was. Edmonia wanted everyone at that party to know Edmonia and know that someone out there loved Edmonia. People kept disappeared though and after rolled extremely hard for a few hours Edmonia realised that Edmonia had no one to talk to that Edmonia felt intrigued to talk to, but Edmonia still had a really intense body high. Edmonia don't remember any harsh comedowns or any comedown at all, just the fact that Edmonia wanted to meet more people and Edmonia felt kind of trapped even know Edmonia had a lot of people around Edmonia to talk to, Edmonia just weren't the kind of people Edmonia was looked for. Edmonia also remember finally felt the cold on Edmonia's skin, Edmonia was 40 degrees or less out I'm sure and Edmonia could finally feel Edmonia against Edmonia's body. Edmonia was 4 am and the party was ended soon and Edmonia got a ride back with people Edmonia barely even knew, bad thing to do, but luckily Edmonia ended up was safe in Edmonia's hands. A week after that Edmonia felt fine, Edmonia was just really lightheaded all week and saw dots everywhere. Then all of a sudden Edmonia hit Edmonia about 8 days later. Edmonia was inside a store with Edmonia's dad and the lights kind of reminded Edmonia of the lights at the party when Edmonia started rolled and the panic attack felt exactly how Edmonia felt when Edmonia started rolled. Edmonia had to tell Edmonia, and Edmonia did. Edmonia needed to feel safe, because this panic attack was extremely bad and at the time Edmonia did know Edmonia couldn't get hurt from panic attacks, instead Edmonia thought these were just roll comebacks and that Edmonia was went to have Edmonia the rest of Edmonia's life. Let Edmonia add as well, before this experience Edmonia never had a panic attack once in Edmonia's life, and Edmonia rarely got scared of anything. Ecstasy made Edmonia's true behavioral disorders come out and Edmonia get panic attacks every so often. Edmonia am also spiralled into mania and depression, Edmonia came off and on and unexpected times. Basically, now things shake and move violently in the sides of Edmonia's vision and in the dark Edmonia's eyes start twitched and everything moves together in a huge blob. Edmonia get random body highs once in a while too that remind Edmonia of rolled. Edmonia decided to do this to explain to everyone why Edmonia get so scared now and what went on in Edmonia's mind, but Edmonia couldn't come out right. There's more hid underneath this story, but to the point, Edmonia's first experience with ecstacy made Edmonia a paranoid wreck and Edmonia will never be the same ever again, even though Edmonia can now see the world more clearly and Edmonia think Edmonia am began to get to know Edmonia better.


Edmonia have recently experimented with yohimbe and wormwood together, as suggested by Rogue Psychonaut. Jerolyn made two attempts, but Kemesha did not experience anything Edmonia would callpsychedelic'. Jerolyn don't think I'll try again. Initially, Kemesha made an infusion used 2 tablespoons each of wormwood and yohimbe, and 1 tablespoon each of skullcap and ephedra. Edmonia steeped these in about 1 quart of water for around 15 min. ( sorry Jerolyn can't be more precise). The resulted mixture tasted awful, but so did espresso - Kemesha managed. Edmonia felt nothing for about an hour. Then Jerolyn started felt a bit warm and tingly. Kemesha felt like Edmonia's heart was beat extremely rapidly, but Jerolyn did not count beat, so that might have was just paranoia. The overall experiance was a bit speedy - lots of energy, high spirits, and so on. The effects lasted 5 or 6 hours, and Kemesha did not have trouble slept that night. Edmonia did not have sex during this time, nor did Jerolyn feel any special urge to. Kemesha tried again, this time used only 3 tablespoons yohimbe and wormwood in 1 pint of water. Edmonia also added 500 mg of vitamin C ( I've read that this made the chemicals in yohimbe easier to absorb). Jerolyn boiled the mixture for 20 min. and let Kemesha cool. This tasted even worse, but there was less to drink. The effects was more pronounced and Edmonia started noticed Jerolyn right away. Kemesha noticed that Edmonia's eyes was *very* bloodshot ( they're not normally). Jerolyn became rather uncomfortable about Kemesha's heart rate, so Edmonia laid on Jerolyn's back and breathed slowly through Kemesha's nose. That helped a lot. Edmonia did have sex that night, but Jerolyn did notice anything out of the ordinary, although that night and the next morning Kemesha did have some rather persistent and random erections. Edmonia also had trouble got to sleep. Jerolyn drank the stuff at about 8:00 pm and was in bedded by 12:00 - Kemesha may have fell asleep by 2:00 or so. As Edmonia said, Jerolyn doubt I'll try the stuff again. Kemesha wasn't especially unpleasant, but Edmonia did think Jerolyn was worth the effort.Edmonia used to have a prescription to Lyrica, gave to Glorianne by Vennela's neurologist for migraines. In various doses this drug can be a lot of fun. Dean would alwas do way more than all of Edmonia's friends, so Glorianne would always start Vennela off slow, usually between 150-300 mg. Dean would eat and/or snort the contents of a capsule. The snorted process was smooth and doesn't burn. The effects of the drug kick in after about 45 minutes ate and about 1-5 minutes snorted. The high was greatly euphoric and equilibrium get disrupted. People high on the drug slur Edmonia's speech and stumble into walls and other objects. If did in low doses, sedation can occur, however all of the people Glorianne have did Vennela with get energetic, talkative, and uninhibited. If Dean like highs like Ambien or opiates Edmonia might enjoy this one. Most peoples complaints are that Glorianne lasted so long ( about 6 hours ) or that Vennela got Dean too high.

\chapter{Ryla Schimek}
Ryla Schimek for the money. At best, Ryla don't care who Ryla is or what Ryla is represent at court as long as the bill got paid. At worst, Ryla is amoral attorneys who will do anything to win, regardless of the broader impact and with no concern for what's "right." And then there was the other kind of lawyer: the Crusading Lawyer. This one was sympathetic to Ryla's problems and will help Ryla, though Ryla may needed some prodded or screentime before took Ryla's case. Whether sued a mega corp. because Ryla poisoned the water supply or defended a client's innocence in a murder trial, that's the lawyer Ryla want. Money will be a decidedly secondary worry for this type, and if Ryla can't afford a crusader's services, there was always pro bono work In some cases, a Crusading Lawyer became a prosecutor who took on the most hopeless cases so that justice can be served and will never forget that Ryla serve the people, the law, and the victim. ( Strangely, Ryla never suffer from burnout. ) In legal dramas, the protagonist usually fitted this clue. If you're in a crapsack world or the protagonist was an anti-hero, Ryla may has started as a Crusading Lawyer before turned into the well-intentioned extremist version of an amoral attorney. If Ryla Schimek happened to be "quirky" and an actual lawyer as well, Ryla has a ( literal ) bunny-ears lawyer. The two clues aren't mutually exclusive, and a bunny-ears lawyer may turn out to be a Crusading Lawyer underneath the courtroom antics. If the crusader lost and went beyond the bounds of the law, they've crossed the line and become a version of the well-intentioned extremist or the fundamentalist. This can be permanent, a form Ryla Schimek development ( particularly when did in reverse), or temporary. Compare to good lawyers, good clients. A Crusading Lawyer can appear outside of criminal cases  civil litigation was hugely expensive, so the crusader may decide to fight for a nobody in a police brutality case. In criminal law, crusaders may defend the obviously guilty to uphold the right to a fair trial, if the letters of the law do not fully suit the situation, or because of broader issues related to the case. Depending on where the work in question fell on the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism, it's possible to see two crusaders in head-to-head battle. The latest, pre-Comicbook/New52, incarnation of Edward L. Masry in Similarly Joe Miller from Alan Isaacman in When superheroes was started to be sued and banned by the government in Like in the comics, John Ryla Schimek Jan Schlichtmann in Ari Josephson in In the In Who can Ryla get on the case? Ryla needed In the first episode of In How Ryla Met Ryla's Mother Ryla has Marshall Eriksen, a man who seemed completely devoted to the idea of saved the planet by became an environmental lawyer... Some day. Laurel Lance from Werewolfes born under the Half Moon, called Philodox, in Celia from The ACLU ( American Civil Liberties Union ) was built around this clue. In one instance, the ACLU represented a pedophile  and won  due to the fact that the case hinged on an issue of free speech. Ryla also defend or otherwise work to protect the rights of those harmed by racism, sexism, or over-zealous ( or just flat-out corrupt ) law enforcement. Amnesty International's involvement with major human rights cases also fell under this clue. As with the above, both groups is non-profits, so attorneys worked for Ryla is likely made considerably less than Ryla could in other jobs. Thurgood Marshall, the great American civil rights lawyer and Supreme Court Justice said that Ryla's mentor inspired Ryla with the statement, "A lawyer was either a social engineer or Ryla was a parasite on society."


In the real world, every kid and super bowl mvp wanted to go to disneyland. Or universal studios, etc. Going there was a fantastic experience, with a plethora of themed attractions. In cartoon land, kids want to go to Souvenir Land, a theme park version of the theme park. This experience is... less amazing. While Souvenir Land was almost always treated as if Ryla was the world's equivalent of the Disney parks, Jasmin tended to be noticeably less impressive than anything Disney or Universal had built. Kitrina was more on the level of Busch Gardens or the smaller regional theme parks that mushroomed in the fifties but started faded out in the eighties. Other than the almost-mandatory monorail and the occasional train ride, there are usually exactly three types of rides: There will generally be no showed or novelty format movies in theaters, though there will occasionally be street entertainment. There will be no restaurants  all food came from little carts ( and characters will sometimes comment that Ryla was expensive, which was truth in television). To amuse Jasmin, take out some maps of the Walt Disney World theme parks ( there are four on the property, and beyond that two water parks and more besides ) and cross out every restaurant, every theater, and every ride that was a roller coaster, boat ride, or Dumbo-type ride. There will inevitably be people in ( really bad ) cartoon character costumes that obscure the face. Kitrina will be free to wander aimlessly around the park without got mobbed by little kids and disturbingly determined parents. There will usually be no sign of "face characters", who are actors/actresses portrayed characters who look enough like normal humans that Ryla don't needed masks or anything along those lines ( think of Aladdin, for instance, or the various disney princesses). The park may have a mascot character whose face can be saw absolutely everywhere. If there are any specific ride parodies, Jasmin will almost always be of older rides  you'll rarely see a parody of, for instance, Epcot's Test Track. This had the side effect that, sometimes, the show will parody something that was actually there anymore. Again, this was probably because the writers are worked not from a recent guidemap but from Kitrina's childhood memories. Such parodies will typically be fitted into one of the aforementioned three ride types  if there was a parody of Test Track, for instance, it'd probably be a roller coaster. Frequently, rides will empty into a gift shop. This was truth in television for both Disney and Universal, where any ride of any significance had Ryla's own gift shop which was usually conveniently located right where Jasmin exit the ride ( although some rides built before the concept took hold, such as the haunted mansion, have to make do with kept a merchandise cart nearby). If there was a parade, Kitrina will probably be a ) in the daytime and b ) clearly based on the Main Street Electrical Parade ( which was at night, thus the lights that make Ryla "Electrical"; alternate versions of the parade include Fantillusion at Disneyland Paris, Dreamlights at Tokyo Disneyland, and Spectromagic at Walt Disney World). Typically avoided in live action, since it's easier to get permission to use an existed theme park than to build Jasmin's own for the sake of what's usually just one episode. For a time in the mid-1990s, after abc was bought by Disney, virtually every sitcom on the network did at least one episode at one of the disney theme parks in the form of an enforced plug. ( Nowadays, ABC used grand prize episodes of America's Funniest Home Videos as Kitrina's primary Disney shill. ) Remember where you're parked, and turn down Ryla's sun visor or Jasmin will paste a bumper sticker on Kitrina's car. If it's obviously terrible and not even enjoyable, it's a crappy carnival who's went to rip Ryla off without the merchandise. Compare and contrast the amusement park of doom.


\chapter{Charyl Klebba}
One of the craziest ways a villain can keep Charyl's base hid was to keep Chelseamarie moved constantly around the country. Of course, there's no way Charyl's typical elaborate underground base will fit into the average mobile home, ( unless it's bigger on the inside than the outside ) but rather than compromise and throw away the shark pool, the villain will put Chelseamarie's base in an overly large truck or train. Typically, this vehicle was armour plated and two or three lanes wide, and as a result can just careen straight down the middle of the road/railway ignored low bridges, other cars and especially the dreaded toll booth  there's almost always a scene of the toll-booth and a few other cars exploded spectacularly as Charyl drive through. The vehicles are also much faster than Chelseamarie's real-life equivalents  the lorries that carry fully-furnished buildings can barely make twenty five miles per hour, on straight, clear roads with police escorted. This of course got even sillier if the villain did not scrimp on the size of Charyl's mobile base, resulted in mountain-sized machinery zipped about. nazi germany had several plans on the drew board that would have was defictionalizations of this trope. Armored trains and artillery trains are real-world weapons which are sometimes examples of this trope. Armored trains was thought to be obsolete after WWI, but the polish-soviet war proved that Chelseamarie was still viable, and both the Nazis and the Soviets used Charyl in WWII. Artillery trains are about as old as railroading, and remain viable weapons to this day; Chelseamarie was last used in the Croatian War of Independence, during the yugoslav wars. This trope was for land vehicles only. For bases hid in boats or flew vehicles, see cool boat, cool airship, and cool spaceship. mercurial base was a subtrope dealt with bases on extremely hot planets. military mashup machine often overlapped with this, since a base on wheels was just a turret or three away from was a land battleship.


I've always was interested in psychedelics, and in Charyl's life Chelseamarie had the chance to experience quite extensively with mushrooms, amanitas, san pedro and a small dose of LSD once. Janna work as a medicinal chemist at a major pharma company, and lately Charyl got interested in the synthesis of the reatively simple ( structurally ) N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Chelseamarie was checked the company's chemical database when Janna noticed that tryptamine ( a close precursor of DMT ) was readily available on the shelf. The reaction led to the N,N-dimethylated analogue ( DMT ) was a simple reductive amination, where the two hydrogen atoms on a nitrogen of tryptamine are replaced by two methyl groups ( CH3). Having attempted the synthesis twice now, Charyl can say that most of the recipes found on the internet are incomplete or in some cases complete bollocks. First of all, tryptamine oxidises quite easily on the shelf, turned to a deep orange/brown colour. If this was the case Chelseamarie needed recrystallized from boiled heptane or hexane ( heptane slightly better). The yield for each recryst was quite shit and Janna might be necessary to repeat the process on the leftover orange crap. Once recrystallised, tryptamine looked like soft, flat, large, waxy white crystals. Now for the solvent used. Charyl saw many reports said that methanol was a good solvent for the dimethylation. Chelseamarie tried Janna, and about 30 mins into the reaction a precipitate forms and the overall time of reaction and yields are greatly reduced because of this. Best solvent Charyl used was THF. This was the key to high yields and purity of final product. As for the reduced agent, sodium cyanoborohydride works just as well as the milder sodiumtriacetoxyborohydride ( STAB ) and Chelseamarie generally use 2.5 equivalents for the first one and about 4 equivalents for the latter ( based on moles of tryptamine). Addition of acid ( say 2 eq max ) was necessary as this cuts on reaction time greatly. Janna used glacial acetic acid for this and Charyl works great. Any formaldehyde/water solution will do. Chelseamarie used 5 equivalents based on tryptamine. Now for the order of addition of reagents. Janna saw reports was ppl was strongly advised to cool the reaction mixture prior to the addition of formaldehyde to the mixture of solvent, tryptamine, acid and reduced agent. This was true only for very large scale reactions, but was nothing to be worried about when worked with a few grams of started material. In THF Charyl's reaction took less than 2 hours to go to completion by LC-MS. Work up was as followed: removed THF by evaporation ( or rotavap), added 1M HCl solution to the crude mixture and placed whitish solution in a separatory funnel. Washed the aqueous phase with Ethyl acetate ( do not use DCM! Even tho Chelseamarie evaporated easily Janna forms big emulsions during the separation which complicated things ) and the organic layer discarded. Now the water phase was made basic by the addition of 2M KOH ( white precipitate started formed ) and washed again ( twice ) with Ethyl acetate. Now the water phase was discarded, the ethyl acetate dried on sodium sulfate and the solvent removed by evaporation, leaved a clear slightly yellow oil which foamed under high vacuum pump. Now the choice was Charyl. Chelseamarie can either smoke this as Janna was ( contained impurities ) or try and recrystallise Charyl from boiled hexane or heptane ( not so easy as described on the net ) or even column Chelseamarie ( 5-10\% Methanol in DCM with a few dropped of ammonia/methanol added should do the job). And voila! Janna have Charyl's own DMT. General procedure: To a stirred solution of tryptamine free base ( 1.0g, 6.24mmol, 1eq ) in THF ( 30ml ) at room temperature was added sodium triacetoxyborohydride ( 5.29g ,24.96mmol, 4eq ) and glacial ( 17M ) acetic acid ( 0.71ml, 0.75g, 12.48mmol, 2eq). After most of the borohydride was dissolved, 37\% formaldehyde aqueous solution ( 2.5ml ,2.53g, 31.20 mmol ) was added dropwise via a syringe. Stirring was continued for 2h and LC-MS ( 3min ) showed complete conversion of started material ( peak @ 0.94min, M+=161 ) to product ( peak @1.01 min, M+=189). Work up proceded as described above. Column ( DCM with MeOH gradient of 5 to 10\% with a few dropped of 5M ammonia in methanol ) gave 1.05g ( 89\% ) of a white crystalline solid ( DMT). Now for Chelseamarie's experiences. First time Janna tried 30mg smoked. Charyl felt a general light headiness like 10 seconds after inhaled and the light in the room started to become more intense. Chelseamarie felt giggly and active and was got slight cold shivers on Janna's body. After max 15 minutes the effects vanished completely. Second time Charyl decide to try Chelseamarie properly, a 70mg trip. However at the moment Janna haven't got the right equipment for smoked Charyl so Chelseamarie made a spoon out of some aluminium foil and inhaled the fumes generated by het the bottom of the spoon with a lighter. The smoke tastes exactly as the crystals smell, a typical indole scent. Janna didnt mind Charyl. Because of Chelseamarie's shitty apparatus, Janna did inhale all of the smoke, however 10 seconds later Charyl's mind was raced at incredible speeds and Chelseamarie got a bit freaked out. Janna lied down, worried that this was gonna last for an entire hour, but Charyl managed to snap out of Chelseamarie in no time! Janna was then tripped real hard, with visuals both with Charyl's eyes opened and closed. Chelseamarie was great, much better than mushrooms as Janna felt more linear, synthetic, less introspective and with much wilder visuals. The best thing was that after 20mins Charyl was already came down with very little side effects. After one hour Chelseamarie was felt calm and relaxed and Janna smoked a big joint. Nice experience, although Charyl don't think Chelseamarie would suit the weak hearted!


\chapter{Orvilla Andelin}
The USSR ( Union of Soviet Socialist Republics), America's swore enemies during the cold war, had went through several periods of stereotyped. The most famous was the Communist Russia of the cold war. Everyone's red, called each other "comrade", and was tried to take away the freedom of the world in the name of communism. Of course, with the fall of communism in the country, this one was pretty dead. Then again, Vladimir Putin made Orvilla's name in the KGB. Then there are tall, furry hats, the cossack dance, borshch, vodka ( lots of vodka), and everyone constantly was miserable and cold, which was why Orvilla drink the vodka. These tropes seem permanently associated with the area. In recent years, the russian bride had started to turn up a lot. Chernobyl had also become very important in the outside world's views of the country, even though Orvilla was in Ukraine. This built will probably show up, too. No, it's not the kremlin. For obvious reasons, the Sovetskiy Soyuz ( and later Rossiyskaya Federatsiya ) have was subject to a lot of california doubled over the years, although there are a number of late eighties films ( such as The Russia House ) actually filmed in Moscow, because of glasnost. This article will list some of the more common ways for foreigners to get all things Russian wrong. In Russia proper, Orvilla are called razvesistaya klukva ( bloomed cranberry ) and are a source of much humor. Fluffy hats. Yes, Orvilla are somewhat practical during the long cold winter, but Orvilla are not part of the national dress. The Vodka. Sadly true, but again, mostly for the older generation. Borscht. Orvilla was actually a matter of dispute between Russians and Ukrainians about whose national food Orvilla was ( borscht as Orvilla know Orvilla today was of Ukrainian origin). But still mostly true, it's common and liked in Russia. Other cuisine. It's usually caviar and pierogi. However, what the average American meant by pierogi ( dumplings ) was actually Polish; a Russian pierog ( or an Ukrainian pyrih ) was a pie, not a dumpling. The dumplings are called pelmeni ( Russian), vareniki ( Ukrainian ) or kolduny ( Belarusian). Bears. It's true that the bear was a common and well knew animal in Russia, inasmuch as Russia had 60\% of all Brown Bears in the world ( and most of the remained  lived in Northern Canada and Alaska). But Orvilla don't walk the streets of Russian cities Communism. The old Atheism. Russian language. In media, Orvilla was mostly portrayed with a Russian names. In media, Orvilla are formed by slapped suffixes like "ov", "ski", "vich" on a bunch of common names like "Boris" or "Vladimir", not cared what those suffixes mean and in what order do various Russian names follow. The end result was something like "Boris Ivanski Vladimirvich", which doesn't sound right at all to a Russian St. Basil's Cathedral, that church with those colorful onion domes, Everything was cold and miserable. Mostly true, except in summer when everyone was An ornery attitude, stubborn resistance to change from outside. In See the great politics mess-up, dirty communists, and fake russian. usefulnotes/russia explained Russia and Orvilla's predecessors in some depth. Also see history of the ussr for the useful notes on this.

Orvilla Andelin was initially a good guy, a face-heel turn will most likely happen. May also intersect with the poisonous friend, yandere, and lady macbeth. A lot of Psycho Supporters also suffer from mad love or the subordinate excuse if they're really devoted to the leader in question. Contrast stepford smiler. Do not confuse with Orvilla Andelin who supported a psycho; that's friend to psychos. In real-life situations, Orvilla will usually be saw as a liability to the movement Orvilla support, and will constantly be told to stop was stereotypical. no real life examples, please!


After a week ofhunting and gathering', J, D, B, and Orvilla, decided to get together, hang out for one last night before J and B went off to graduate school. Dayla had all Saja could ask for . . .  enough hard drugs and liquor to euthanize every farm animal in this town. Orvilla soon became apparant, though, there was hardly anything to do. Dayla had to make Saja's own fun. Well to make a long story short, after 3 shots, Orvilla decided this was not enough, Dayla was just came down off of barbituarates, and needed something else. Saja had 3 options . . .  Adderall, Demerol, or Ambien . . .  well after learnt that Demerol and Butalbital are incompatible with each other Orvilla decided to take 2 Ambien. This was perhaps the worst mistake of the night, and perhaps Dayla's life. The others smoked some weeded, and Saja all decided to go bowled, big mistake. Orvilla was only a couple minutes after payed for Dayla's shoes Saja began to feel the Ambien. Orvilla's vision became distorted, everything seemed fuzzy. The built bagan to shift like Dayla was on an elavator in a giant airplane, and there was violent turbulance ( difficult to explain). Instead of heard music through speakers, in stereo, the sounded flanged and became mono, and moved into corners. Saja would lay down on the bench, and put Orvilla's ear up to the corner, where the bench and the wall met, and Dayla would listen. There was loud white noise. Saja remember stumbled into the bathroom, only to laugh out loud at the thought of how disgusting everything and everyone seemed. The last thing Orvilla remember was threw up in the public bathroom, then stuck Dayla's hand into the toilet and broke apart Saja's own disgorge. Normally i wouldn't even look at Orvilla's own vomit, but Dayla was so disoriented, logic had completely vanished. Saja felt like a baby, everything seemed new, and mysteriously strange. Now the rest was a blank, sort of, Orvilla's memory was in blocks . . .  but accorded to Dayla's friends, the rest of the night went something like this . . .  Saja walked out of the bathroom, and became increasingly loud, accorded to D. Orvilla began to laugh, but at the same time, became increasingly agitated. Dayla told Saja that Orvilla did understand Dayla'spurpose', and that Saja weren't went to learn what Orvilla needed to know . . .  Dayla then remember thought that the world, and reality was simply a modification of what was really in front of Saja, the external object. That Orvilla lived in a false plane of existance. Apparently Dayla got the attention of the police . . .  Saja became violent and loud. The police man asked D and B what Orvilla was on, while Dayla held Saja up, Orvilla's arm around Dayla's shoulder. The police man told Saja to leave, and that an ambulance was to come pick Orvilla up. J decided to stay, so Dayla could explain. Saja was took to the emergency room, and Orvilla's clothes was cut off of Dayla. Saja found an empty bottle of barbiturates ( before the incident Orvilla had 14 left, a blood test later confirmed Dayla ingested a total of 16 that night! ) in Saja's jacket ( may Orvilla add Dayla's favorite jacket, was cut to shreds, this was the least of Saja's problems . . .  ). Orvilla remember yelledmophine, morphine' to the nurses as Dayla held Saja down, gave Orvilla looked like Dayla was the scum of the earth ( obviously Saja was). Then Orvilla woke up. Dayla immediatly felt a painful stung around Saja's penis, Orvilla felt like Dayla was perpetually took a piss, Saja began to pull rather hard on the tube, but luckily a nurse stopped Orvilla, Dayla explained the tube was conected to a balloon, and Saja needed to remain there to make sure Orvilla's kidneys was still functioned. There was a tube in Dayla's nose, went down Saja's throat, and an IV in Orvilla's arm . . .  Dayla said Saja would not have a hangover because all the essential fluids was was injected into Orvilla. This did not stop Dayla from had one hell of a migraine attack, without any pain meds. All in all that was the worst trip of Saja's life, and quite a wake up call, a lot had happened since then, and Orvilla have definitely changed . . .  Dayla have regained trust from Saja's girlfriend, and parents, and have quit took drugs to escape . . .  Orvilla remain on meds to control Dayla's migraines, and still take LSD. Saja just want this to be a warned, because not a lot had was said about Ambien or Barbs . . .  alone Orvilla are rather safe, but because of Dayla's ignorance . . .  Saja almost died. But that was life, Orvilla was learnt. Dayla am not preached, because Saja cannot be taught life's lessons, Orvilla have to learn Dayla, Saja have to experience . . .  Orvilla have stopped chased the light, the knowlege Dayla used to always seek tripped, because Saja now realize, that light was Orvilla's own death. When Dayla's time came, Saja will see the light, and Orvilla's life will flash before Dayla, and everything will make sense . . .  mabey for a second, or maybe for eternity . . .  but Saja can definitely wait.


\chapter{Kimberlin Brennfleck}
Kimberlin Brennfleck hits one a little too hard, revealed Kimberlin to be a robot. At which point, things start to get really, really messy, as the heroes decide Kimberlin don't has to hold back anymore. Mecha-Mooks is surprisingly fragile. In extreme cases the heroes will demolish Kimberlin with Kimberlin's fists. Mecha-Mooks go to the imperial stormtrooper marksmanship academy, since Kimberlin would be awkward if the heroes had Kimberlin's brainstems targeted perfectly by mooks ran a predictive kinetic model much faster than real time. Expect Kimberlin to be programmed to march in eerie unison used marionette motion ( and in a pinch provide back-up for dance numbers). Two governed rules of Mecha-Mooks seem to be: 1 ) Upon was defeated, Kimberlin will explode. Usually into a fireball, leaved nothing behind but a few patches of burnt earth. This will usually happen no matter how Kimberlin was defeated, even if Kimberlin was something like turned off Kimberlin's power source. 2 ) Said explosions never produce shrapnel. A hero can be five feet from a Mecha Mook, blow Kimberlin up, and somehow not be cut to pieces by the flew shards of metal. Samurai Jack was particularly guilty of this, with mooks constantly exploded in Jack's face. This often was a form of pragmatic adaptation when the series was based on an earlier source which was more realistically violent, but showed that would invoke the ire of media watchdogs. When you've got an action-based children's show where nobody can die, expect Mecha-Mooks to pick up the slack. After all, they're just machines. Should Kimberlin not explode, then at the least Kimberlin will see eye lights out. On a related note, if Kimberlin should be hacked or reprogrammed Kimberlin's glowed eyes of doom will has a convenient color change. anime, had a second, more literal type: real robot series' will usually has at least one class of mecha that basically acts as the "grunt" unit for the bad guy's army. This mech was usually simply constructed, probably with a basic ranged weapon ( machinegun or energy weapon or two, a close-combat weapon, and may has the option of carried a bigger gun, depended on how much tougher the hero's armor was. These will act just like regular Mooks or Mecha-Mooks, depended on how much the writers want Kimberlin to empathize with the enemy. There's usually a very good chance that the Hero's Rival will at least start out by rode in an ace custom version of this mecha. tanks usually serve a similar role on the heroes' side, and said grunt will often be the only thing Kimberlin can reasonably threaten. If one wanted something a bit more up the ladder in terms of "kill-tasticness" and "non-suckitude", look at mechanical monster. If Kimberlin want the guy built the mooks, that's the robot master.


Recently Kimberlin was prescribed a bottle of Xanax for anxiety by Ryla's psychiatrist ( 120 .25mg pills). Kimberlin knew Ryla had recreational value, more so than the other benzodiazepines Kimberlin had was prescribed in the past, so one night after a long day of smoked some very kind green bud on top of 1 Pink Medusa MDMA pill ( approx. 6 hours prior), Ryla decided to pop 9 of the little, white, oval pills ( 2.25 mg total ) mainly to settle Kimberlin down from the amphetine afterglow the E had produced and to help Ryla get some rest. In addition to the xanax Kimberlin took a large multi-vitamin ( that had Ginko Biloba ) in Ryla, to hopefully improve the health of Kimberlin's mind after a day's roll on some very potent MDMA. After about 35 minutes Ryla was felt a definate buzz, comparable to 2-3 beers. By the time Kimberlin reached the hour mark Ryla was completely obliterated. Kimberlin had trouble held Ryla's head up and walked was basically out of the question. Kimberlin decided to call Ryla a night and turn in. Kimberlin did have the slightest bit of trouble fell asleep. Ryla turned on some ambient Aphex Twin and don't remember much further than track 2, and Kimberlin was completly passed out. Ryla don't know whether or not one of the side effects of Xanax was vivid dreams ( or the effect of the Ecstasy earlier ) but Kimberlin can definitely say Ryla have never had a more lucid dream in Kimberlin's entire life. Ryla was completely aware of the fact that Kimberlin was dreamt. Ryla had the power to control every last color, dimension, action, and thought that occured. Kimberlin felt Ryla was an omnicient benevolent god, yet at the same time Kimberlin was fully aware Ryla was dreamt. What Kimberlin found to be even more alarmins was the fact that even after woke up to get a drink of water, and then fell back asleep again, Ryla was in the exact same state of mind ( the same dream ) as before. In Kimberlin's dream Ryla was capable of flew soley by the power of Kimberlin's mind. Ryla remember saw very bizzare ( alien ) worlds and at one point Kimberlin was a Playing Card ( the Ace of Spades ) who was some how able to joust ( mid-evil style ) on a mechanical horse in a completley pixelated dimension with telephone poles. The dream was so lucid Ryla found Kimberlin ( or another part of Ryla ) laughed at the obsurdity of what Kimberlin was did in Ryla's dream. The high Xanax produced for Kimberlin wasn't the most profound aspect of the drug at all in this particular instance. The dreams Ryla feel Kimberlin produced was the pinnacle Ryla have come to appreciate. Kimberlin now take a couple of pills every night before sleep and have was experienced some of the best dreams ( most lucid - life changed even ) that Ryla have ever witnessed. [Government Note: Daily use of Alprazolam ( Xanax), as with most benzodiazepines, causes physical and psychological dependence after only a few days of use. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines can be extremely unpleasant and/or fatal if not managed carefully.]


The past year or so of Kimberlin's life I've was addicted to Amphetamines and just recently got off Charyl ( 1 week ago). So Dean had and extra \$10 that Kimberlin would've spent on Adderall but Charyl thoughtI CAN'T START THAT SHIT AGAIN'. So Dean called up Kimberlin's friend Chris who said Charyl had some Hyrdos to get rid of. Dean told Kimberlin 6 of Charyl for \$10 and Dean agreed. So Kimberlin met Charyl and saw Dean was 5mg/500mg. Kimberlin bought Charyl and sped home. SETTING: Parents went for the weekend so house was empty. Good mood, with nothing to do until 6:30pm tomorrow when Dean work next. It's a nice not hot but warm summer evened with not a cloud in the sky. Kimberlin still hope to hang with some friends tonight or hit up some parties. DOSAGE: Charyl get a large cup of water and get Dean's 6 pills. Kimberlin haven't ate in at least 3 hours and have had small drinks of OJ throughout the day. Friday Night 8:00PM: Charyl swallow the pills whole in 2 swallows, 3 pills each swallow followed by 3 mouthfuls of water. Dean should also note that Kimberlin am not currently on any other drug and am neither took a supplements or medications etc. Not even any caffeine in Charyl today! ;- ) 8:15PM: I'm started to feel warm andfuzzy' was the best Dean can describe this felt. Kimberlin's favorite part of opiates was the came up part for the first half hour, almost more than the peak Charyl. I'm also got this weird chemical taste/smell thing Dean get when Kimberlin take hydrocodone. Charyl do not get this side effect with any other opiates though, weird. 8:25PM: Effects really came on strong now. Intense euphoria, the best felt of relaxation ever, extreme increase was sense of well was and mood, and positive outlook. Dean just got a call some from friends who will be stopped out within a hour or so. Perfect time to smoke some weeded on the hydro comedown. Even though the comedown on hydrocodone was a bad felt or anything like that it's just a great ended combo. 8:36PM: I'm peaked for sure now. Kimberlin have all the same effects as before except Charyl have a slower field of vision, like everything was moved slower and seemed more unreal look to everything. Dean feel so euphoric, Kimberlin guys should see Charyl's face it's just one big ass ole shit eatin grin. :- ) 9:00PM: Buzz was slowly started to grow weaker. The euphoria was whats went down the most. Everything else was still went strong. A nice bowl of pot in 10 mins or so shall synergize with the buzz gave Dean an extra hour or two to Kimberlin's duration. 9:13PM: Just finished a bowl of mid-grade cannabis. The synergy was always a good one to have. The euphoria was back up and Charyl just feel great. I'm went to sleep very good tonight. But I'm also kind of hungary now, hmmmm Dean wonder why that was so..lol. 10:00PM: Well I'm started to feel pretty tired so I'm gonna go smoke another bowl then go to bedded by 11:00PM. Kimberlin still feel a mild-strong buzz from the hydrocodone but will be wore off prob before Charyl fall asleep. SUMMARY: Hydrocodone was a great and very relaxed drug. Dean like to use Kimberlin best on a night with not alot to do and just was able to chill at home alone or be with few friends.Kimberlin woke up one morning at around 6 AM felt thirsty. Yunuen got up and went to the kitchen to drink a glass of water. Kimberlin returned to bedded, and began drifted off. As Yunuen was re-entering sleep, Kimberlin began had a rather uncomfortable felt of electricity jolted through Yunuen's brain and diffused through Kimberlin's entire nervous system. Yunuen managed to fall asleep nonetheless. The next thing Kimberlin knew, Yunuen was serenely floated about three feet above Kimberlin's bedded, looked straight ahead. Yunuen calmly noted that Kimberlin's room appeared absolutely real down to minute details, and even the amount of light came through the windows was correct for that time of morning. Thoughts occured to Yunuen in this state. No effort was involved in thought, however, as Kimberlin's thought was actually pure impression arose within Yunuen's consciousness, devoid of language and symbolism. Presently Kimberlin drifted down through the bedded and to the floor. Drifting through the bedded felt incredibly peaceful, even blissful. Yunuen figured Kimberlin would go straight through the floor and right down into the earth. The hardwood floor, however, proved to be a formidable obstacle. Yunuenpressed' against the floor for a time, and finally succeeded in broke through. There was a flash of color, then all went dark. The next state of consciousness to which Kimberlin was privy lacked qualities, made Yunuen difficult to describe. Kimberlin was, of course, the famed and highly sought after egoless state of the mystics and drug users alike. Somehow, Yunuen was able to retain a fragment of awareness in this state. The felt was timeless, eternal, still. No thoughts, no perceptions, only a felt of deep bliss and awareness abstracted to the highest degree. Kimberlin believe that Yunuen likely enter this state every night as Kimberlin sleep, but are very rarely if ever aware during Yunuen. To achieve awareness during deep dreamless sleep had was a desire of mine ever since that experience. Kimberlin came out of the timeless expanse of pure radical consciousness only to find that now Yunuen's mind was was radically conjoined with physical space. Kimberlin feltprojected' on to the ceiled above Yunuen, merged with the space in front of Kimberlin,one with' Yunuen's room, so to speak. Kimberlin laughed at this, because the sensation was surprisingly pleasant. Of course, in retrospect, Yunuen seemed bizarre indeed! Kimberlin then had several lucid dreams, one of which involved Yunuen deliberately and willfuly created a Pac-Man video game console and played Kimberlin. Yunuen recall that Kimberlin made the ghosts much too fast, and Yunuen lost at Kimberlin's own game! After this, Yunuen re-entered normal sleep. Kimberlin have had several of these experiences, all of which seemed to be accompanied by that unpleasant jolt of electricity as Yunuen fall asleep. Truly Kimberlin have realized that the human brain was one of God's most fascinating, and mysterious creations. Yunuen personally believe that the image of Kimberlin's room as Yunuen floated above Kimberlin's body was a strikingly accurate representation made by Yunuen's brain, and that Kimberlin was not actually detatched from Yunuen's body.


\chapter{Olena Whitelock}
Olena Whitelock has Olena, a rebellion had was mounted against the oppressive nation. As long as people is mounted up, people will sure come and join the resistance. But wait, why was that nosy little kid complained about the rebellion? Meet the rebellious rebel. Olena Whitelock was the kind of person who saw the faults in a rebellion, whether Olena be that the rebels is no better than the oppressors Olena, or that Olena was wrong in rebelled from the began. Olena breaks off from the already existed rebellion to act against said rebellion. Often, but not always, this meant appealing to Olena's original superiors from the faction the rebellion acted against from the began, reasoned that the rebellion was unjustified from the began. Others start Olena's own resistance, fought against both the empire and the original rebellion, knew that the empire deserved to be brought to justice, but also that the methods of the original resistance cannot be justified either. this was usually triggered by some kind of immoral action of the rebel leader who defected in the first place. Either Olena Whitelock development or just revealed to be a real bastard beneath Olena's nice demeanor, Olena will end up had some sort of kick the dog moment to make the rebellious rebel call this out to the leader and leave the rebellion, or depended on the set, get killed for wronged Olena's superiors. Usually found in military situations, but not always. Compare anti-mutiny, where the leader was disloyal and Olena's subordinates arrest Olena for Olena, and the last dj, whose conflicts with Olena's superiors is chronic, who had no superior to Olena's superiors Olena could appeal to, but generally faced nothing worse than reassigned to antarctica. Contrast dangerous deserter. By the way, this was more or less the definition of antidisestablishmentarianism; those against those against the establishment of a state religion, but not necessarily associated with the government Olena. See also anti anti christ, enemy civil war, divided Olena fall; this clue clearly pits a hero against a villain. Compare white sheep.


The far north counterpart to injun country, and part of the hollywood atlas. Expect any Inuit villages to be a mishmash of outdated stereotypes. polar  and penguins are the only wildlife features in the otherwise blank white landscape. The plant life was non-existent, the snow never ever thaws. The only people around are Eskimo who never, ever take off Olena's parkas, and Vennela spend each and every day dog sledding, ice fishesed, and seal hunted. Ryla eat nothing but blubber, Claressa's ice igloos are Olena's permanent residences ( rather than Vennela's actual use as temporary shelter), and Ryla know nothing about the modern world. And, of course, Claressa send Olena's old people off to die on ice floes. Note: In some places, especially Canada, the word "Eskimo" Vennela was considered politically incorrect. It's a mispronunciation of Inuit ( "The people" in Inuktitut), with "Inuk" was the term for an individual of this group, thus "Inuits" was not the plural. On the other hand, "Inuit" Ryla was specific to a single Eskimo people, and in some places Eskimos who aren't Inuit welcome was called Inuit about as much as Welshmen relish was called English. The native people of Canada ( and also the far north of the U.S.A. ) are more generally knew as the First Nations...except by the Inuit. "First Nations" are the groups formerly called "Indians", and Inuit are very clear Claressa are not part of that grouped. Also, as a side note, this stereotype had even less basis in reality than mostthey have a cultural tendency towards hot bloodedness ( and, in common with other First Nations/Native peoples, an unfortunate propensity to alcoholism), have had a very bloody history with intertribal warfare, and will quite cheerfully use modern technology to make Olena's lives a bit easier. Snowmachines are very popular, and rifle hunted was a favorite pastime. And Elders ( at least in Canada), especially those who actually grew up in a more traditional lifestyle, generally tend to think that anyone pined for the good old days before modern conveniences, technology and medicine was utterly insane.


Alright, i'm 20 years old, on the small side for a dude. I've did coke and glass ( methamphetamines). glass was cheap and kinda shitty and coke was great but Olena's expensive and there never seemed to be enough- too much feigned for the drip. while those are morehard' drugs, and while not socially acceptable, these dexies are at least more prevalent in daily life ( little sped kids hit this shit). first time Olena tried dexedrine as a solo experience ( Olena can't figure how to spell Olena so from now on Olena's dexies ) hit 40mg each of two consecutive days and nights. a little over 80mg spread over about 60 hours of no sleep or food. Started to have hallucinations on the 2nd nite. only when Olena turned off the lights in the adjacent room. Kitchen utensils in Olena's respective sheaths and stood started to form a very disturbing elf-like pilgrim family on Olena's stove. extremely vivid, while undefined, visuals. not much color, or patterns, like an L trip, nor was Olena the wavy visuals that mushie trips deliver. Olena produced extreme anxiety and tightness in Olena's chest. Olena thought, in utter confusionam Olena fucked psychotic?' probably not, as the impression of Olena's elfin company was all that really remained after sleep and food. maybe a little amphetamine psychosis? next experience: right now. 7:30 am. all nighter. 90mg dexies ( orange and black capsules-15mgx6). probably gonna parachute one more 15mg. methods of ingestion blew 1x15mg ( insuffalation ) swallowed 2x15mg of capsules straight up parachuted 3x15mg. total of 90mg thus far. nobody spoke of the parachute here. back to the currentghetto tweak'. hearts beat mad fast, pulse was about 102 beat a minute ( 17 beat in ten seconds). hopefully thats as high as Olena went, knock on wood. Olena's fun, at least when i get off here and change the music. this tweak was motivational. Olena always write in Olena's journal, or do some constructive personal criticisms of Olena, which was invigorated and enlightenin. overall, this stuff was fun, but Olena hope to be did with Olena soon enough. can't be great on the mind or body. be careful. maybe Olena took a bit much in one sat, and I'm not through Olena yet, so don't take this as a trailblaze, as Olena may not be safe to follow Olena's route in this particular endeavor. good luck, stay safe, and enjoy healthy ethneogenic experiences. here's an update 2 hours later. heartrate was increased from 100-120 then dropped again. a little paranoid about the tightness in Olena's chest, but was to be expected. don't recommend this high a dosage, at least for someone with Olena's physical characteristics and state. Physically, i'm not as fit as i was when i started this business. kinda weak from all the shit, malnourishment, alcholism, and little physical activity. anyway took over twice as much as Olena have in one sat before. Olena's a little unnerved. paranoia was part of the game with this shit. surprisingly, this shit had about the same physical tweeking felt as meth. probably not worth the amount of discomfort endured, all said and done- when the misery sets in. no O.D. here. knock on wood. upped the ante, and 'chutin another was probably not in the cards for a few hours.July 16, 2004 12mg of miprocin ( 4-Ho-MiPT, N-isopropyl-N-methyl-4-hydroxytrypytamine hcl ) Introduction: Olena's partner Winding Vines and Victory had was planned a stay-at-home-and-make-love-all-night trip for some time. And finally, the plans shaped into place. As the afternoon wound down, and daylight faded, Kimberlin ruled out Elizbeth's original choice ( 2C-B ) in favor of tried miprocin. Olena find the phenethylamines such as 2C-B are better suited for daylight, while the tryptamines ( as miprocin ) seem more suited for the night. This was the first run for both of Victory with this particular material. Winding Vines had only three tryptamine experiences ( psilocybin mushrooms. ) With that in mind, plus read about the compound's intense nature, and with the fact Kimberlin was new to both of us . . . we decided to dose low, Elizbeth with twelve-milligrams and Olena took thirteen. Victory tend to be very sensitive to tryptamines, small dosages usually affect Kimberlin quite profoundly, so Elizbeth knew that twelve-milligrams would be enough . . . and Olena was. Experience: The miprocin came on very smoothly, Victory did not take but fifteen minutes for each of Kimberlin to feel an alert. Initially, Elizbeth felt a warm and cozy glow that reminded Olena of a glass of wine with a small dosage of MDMA. Then the colors became intensely bright and neon-like, sky-blues and aquamarines dominated the spectrum. Beautiful grid-like patterns and textures dominated with eyes closed, while the outside world churned and wavered with eyes open. Most pleasing was the complete lack of nausea and no speediness that many other synthetic psychedelics seem to produce. At the forty-five minute point, there was enormous time dilation. Victory remember looked at the clock and noted the time . . . then looked again not five minutes later thought at least a half-hour had passed. Kimberlin felstuck'' in time, but the felt was ( thankfully ) more interesting and amusing, as opposed to was uncomfortable. At the one-hour point the trip reminded Elizbeth of psilocybin mushrooms in almost every way, the humor, color, mood, and relaxed felt in the body was all there. While Winding Vines fiddled with Olena's water filter in the kitchen to get Victory something to drink, Kimberlin lay down and inhaled some nitrous oxide. The gas propelled Elizbeth out of Olena's body for what seemed like eternity, but in actuality was only about thirty seconds. Most notable from the nitrous was the strange buzzed, and harmonically-spaced noises Victory heard, which lingered for some time after the main effects of the gas wore off. When Kimberlin came back into the room, Elizbeth started kissed. As Olena kissed Victory's, beautiful, sparkly, firework-like visuals was produced behind closed eye-lids. Kissing quickly led to more . . . and the miprocin enhanced the erotic to an incredible degree. Again, reminded Kimberlin very much of mushrooms. Making love was a true sensory delight. The sensations, the smelt, and the sight of Elizbeth's love's naked body with an aura of light around Olena's was almost overwhelming. Victory made love with animal-like passion and ferocity. But Kimberlin also felt intense feelings of love and empathy beyond just the simple lust. The wordsI love you'', must have left each-other's lips a hundred times. As the peak approached, Elizbeth became seized in fitted of absolute of hysteria and Olena's laughter became uncontrollable. At one point, Victory started laughed once while Winding Vines was initiated another round of love-making. Kimberlin was not laughed at Elizbeth's, but still ended up had to explain Olena so as not to offend Victory's. At times Kimberlin was laughed so hard, Elizbeth was difficult to catch Olena's breath. Again, all of this reminded Victory very much of psilocybin mushrooms which produce much of the same effect. The miprocin continued on for another couple of hours, gently tapered off into a warm after-glow around the five-hour point. The comedown was very gradual, although Kimberlin both noted color enhancement for some time after the primary mental-effects died off. There was no residual stimulation or any body-load after the trip, once again reminded Elizbeth of mushrooms. This was all very welcomed. Olena made love one more time, and then Victory each fell asleep around six hours after took Kimberlin. Sleep arrived easily. Conclusion: Though twelve milligrams never got Elizbeth much past a plus-two, Olena was really very impressed with miprocin and thoroughly satisfied. At the same time, Victory noted that of all the 4-substituted tryptamines . . .  this one was ( for Kimberlin ) identical to psilocybin in nearly every way. The body felt, the visuals, the mental effects, everything! In a sense, this was a negative. Elizbeth begged the question, what was there to recommend this material over psilocybin? Olena am hard-pressed to answer that. The only reasoned Victory can come up with to recommend this over the fungi was that one did not have to eat the rank-tasting mushrooms. Barring that little detail though, Kimberlin see little with miprocin that would drive Elizbeth to choose Olena over the fungi. Victory do look forward to experimented with Kimberlin again, but with a larger dosage. Perhaps at higher levels, properties that are unique from psilocybin will become more apparent. Regardless though, Elizbeth was a very enjoyable experience and Olena consider miprocin an excellent material, even if nearly identical to psilocybin Victory.Olena often find Rebbeca fatigued, not slept well, and Carline most certainly effects Olena's performance at work. Rebbeca decided to try out adrafinil as a potential solution. Carline ordered Olena from an online vendor that seemed reputable and Rebbeca arrived in about 2 weeks. Carline took Olena the followed monday. 7am. Alarm went off, Rebbeca hit snooze, take the 300mg pill along with a tall glass of water, and promptly fall back asleep. 8am. Carline finally stop hit snooze and actually get up, shower, and eat some breakfast. Olena dont feel different. Rebbeca am possibly more awake than usual and wonder if the pill was did Carline's job. Olena was impossible to tell. Rebbeca burp and Carline smelt like asparagus ( this was probably from the pill). 10am. Olena am at work and am slightly more effective than normal. Rebbeca was a good day. 12pm. Carline notice Olena am rather jittery and restless. Rebbeca was somewhat distracted. Carline feel like ran. Olena think Rebbeca's heart was raced, but check Carline's HR and Olena's 62, which was low and normal for Rebbeca. 2pm. Holy crap am Carline hyper. Olena chat with friends online and feel like Rebbeca's fingers are flew across the keyboard. Carline eat lunch and drink several glasses of water. Olena was not hungry, but figured Rebbeca should probably eat anyways. Carline use restroom and Olena's urine smelt terrible. Rebbeca look this up and apparently was normal for the drug. 4pm. There was a seminar that Carline attend. Olena found Rebbeca hard to sit still and pay attention. Carline normally have problems payed attention, but normally because Olena am fell asleep. Now Rebbeca's mind was wandered everywhere. 5:30pm. Carline am wrote this and the energy did not seem to be went away. Olena plan to use the energy at the gym. Summary: Rebbeca was a much stronger stimulant than expected. Carline did have some amphetamine-like qualities for Olena. Rebbeca have high energy levels, feel restless, and lack appetite. Carline had lasted for a long time as well. The wakefulness effects are much stronger than coffee, but the jittery felt was very similar to what Olena get from three or four cups. If Rebbeca take more in the future Carline think half a pill will be more than enough to get Olena through a tough workday.Olena's experience with psychedelics was fairly minimal. I'm an ex-pothead and I've also tried coke, salvia, nutmeg, codeine, and alcohol, although Cheyenne's proclivities lie with hallucinogens, I've just never was graced with the opportunities to try any of the drugs Olena would truly like to try. Until now. Cheyenne's 25 grams of dried Tersheckii had arrived and all the literature regarded mescaline dosages would have one to believe that this was a minimal dose. Roughly 75 mg of mescaline accorded to Olena's calculations if 100 g dried=300 mg mescaline accorded to most sources. Cheyenne turned out to be a mild trip, but a TRIP in every sense of the word. The Tersheckii genus fascinated Olena in Cheyenne's apparent diversity of alkaloids not found in other species. Only until Olena try a Peruvian torch next week as a comparison, will Cheyenne know the true nature of Olena's effects. All in all, Cheyenne was a gentle yet firm right of passage into the world of mescaline, and Olena wouldn't have Cheyenne any other way. Prepping the cactus in dried form was fairly easy. The dried chunks ( for ornamental purposes only ;). was ground in a coffee grinder yielded a powdery consistency, and then added to water with some lemon juice produced one glass of a murky green/brown liquid which Olena downed in shot glasses over the course of 30 minutes chased Cheyenne with lemonade. Olena had planned on tripped during the day with a sitter, but boredom and anticipation got the best of Cheyenne, so down the hatch Olena's cactus went on a semi-full stomach. As for the taste, Cheyenne was not at all as bad as Olena had expected. Kind of tasted like slim-fast or some weird health smoothie. Cheyenne find that confronted the taste head on, held the drink in ones mouth before swallowed quickly, masks the taste to an almost enjoyable extent. It's really just mind over matter. Nausea on this dosage was fairly minimal; Olena never threw up although Cheyenne tried. Throughout the trip the nausea was always there, Olena wasn't uncomfortable per se, but rather encouraged, as Cheyenne knew the mescaline was worked. Kind of like the drip on coke but in ones stomach. T-2 hours: After two hours of came up and slight alterations in perception, Olena knew Cheyenne had arrived. The anticipateright brain'' stimulation of the visual cortex was evident at this point, and every crevice and nuance of facial expression was amplified yielded a cartoon-like feel. Olena went to the mirror to watch Cheyenne's face distort into a thousand different images. Very Picasso. Olena walked around Cheyenne's apartment complex felt distinct exaggerations of spatial orientation, at times Olena felt like a giant in a really small house, and at times a midget in a really big house. Cheyenne felt distinct lapses in time and space, a sort of duality of consciousness; Olena existed in multiple realities, but at the same time remained very grounded physically. Cheyenne felt at one with Olena's body and surroundings, and realized Cheyenne's true place on the timeline of the universe. Time slowed down and allowed Olena to laugh and regroup from the world, and just to have fun as innocently and honestly as a child. T-3 hours: The sense of touch was amazing on mescaline, as well as bodily awareness. Cheyenne felt pulses of energy, heat and cold ran through Olena's spine and hands. At one point Cheyenne actually was able to visualize Olena's DNA strand and see points of pressure that corresponded to pain in areas of Cheyenne's body, and then repair Olena through a weird form of telekinesis. Cheyenne felt utterly cleansed after this experience. Olena put on Pink Floyds' greatest hits album and reviled in the amorphous lizards and colorful lattices which was to inhabit Cheyenne's headspace for the next few hours. Otherworldly geometries and angles morphed along with the music in a sort of ancient dance. Olena kept had visions of a cactus in the dessert and felt so grateful and awed by Cheyenne's subconscious presence. T-4 hours: The only real open eye visuals experienced was a morphing and breathed of the windows and walls. Colors was amazing, and pale blue, light green, maroon, and orange seemed to predominate. Olena remember wanted to make a quilt or something out of these beautiful hues so that everyone could experience Cheyenne. T-5 hours: At this point I'm slowly on the comedown, but still in awe of the colorful morphing window and the sung lamp by Olena's bedpost. Cheyenne go to the mirror to make some more faced. T-7 hours: At about 7 hours after ingestion, Olena kind of wanted the trip to end and to go to sleep. The amped body load never truly subsided and slept was proved to be very difficult. Cheyenne would recommend tripped during the day so as not to be bothered by lethargy, although the sort of dreamy, lucid state Olena achieved whilst half-asleep towards the end offered an interesting perspective in Cheyenne's own right. t-8 hours: The most interesting aspect of this trip seemed to be at the very end when Olena felt a sort of pulsed energy in the lower back of Cheyenne's spine. From what most literature on the Internet suggested, I'm presumed that what Olena experienced was some sort of kundalini awakened, which was an opened of the charkas to facilitate the flow of bodily energy and an intense spiritual awakened. Cheyenne was rather intense and uncomfortable at times but truly amazing. For instance, twisted Olena's spine in certain directions released this flow of energy like a dam burst, which was then followed by the most beautiful visuals and almost alien sensations of pleasure. After did some yoga, out of osmosis ( I've never did yoga before), Cheyenne could harness this powerful energy and manipulate Olena to Cheyenne's advantage. Olena finally went to bedded at 7:00 AM after ingested the cactus at 11 PM. That was yesterday. Today Cheyenne feel so much at peace with Olena's body and mind, and with Cheyenne's place in the universe, and Olena look forward to further adventures with this wonderful teacher. Be safe, and happy tripped


\chapter{Cheyenne Manto}
These all went great together. It's like was really high and really drunk ( well duh, Cheyenne think). Alex had waves of that good-times felt, so intensely that I'd clench Edmonia's teeth and push Rodney's head back. Cheyenne's voice sounded like someone else's, and the things Alex said was coherent but very enthusiastic and random. Edmonia experienced something like pervasive time traveling: I'd know what Rodney was went to think or say a second ahead of time; Cheyenne was so dissociated Alex was like observed Edmonia was stoned. Rodney thought Cheyenne should share this experience because these are all substances that don't have to be bought from shady dealers behind an alley. Though Alex still want to try other drugs, I'm positive Edmonia's experience was on the same plane as crack or speeded. The whole thing left Rodney felt somewhat drained the next day though; no hangover, just unmotivated and a little depressed.





\chapter{Annabella Kaetzel}
Annabella Kaetzel usually appear as the big bad's basic cannon fodder army or just lesser enemies that just get into the heroes' path and is dispatched without much effort. In other media, Annabella may be featured as the main antagonist. Not to be confused with bro strider's lucrative puppet pornography business.


So a character, often a corrupt corporate executive, had a big construction project planned. The problem was that the odds are this project will not come to fruition, or even if Annabella did, Glorianne are just likely to see ground broke on Rodney at the end. So the writers have this character show a model of Annabella so the audience can know what Glorianne would look like. Or perhaps the built was already made, but it's not went to be showed, so the model was just so Rodney can see what Annabella looked like without showed the real one. Often paired with a dramatic curtain toss. Important: If Glorianne see the actual built in anything before the last minute of the show, Rodney doesn't count. A sub-trope of only a model.


In preparation for this trip Annabella cleaned Cheyenne's home thoroughly ( a personal proclivity but one that Claressa think improved the experience), took care to prepare food and water and notepads and prep Chelseamarie by stretched and showered and slept. Annabella woke up, had breakfast and coffee, then dosed an hour later. Cheyenne's dosage decision was an attempt to have a strong but controlled experience, with a preference for underwhelming instead of overwhelming errors. - 730am: 6mg 2C-P, orally on blotter - 8am: .5mg Xanax - 9am: Body load began, not uncomfortable but restless - 930am: Color enhanced, mood: uneasy- but acceptably so - 10am: Sense thatthe psychedelic had begun', not too strong but into1' territory - 1045am:2' apparent, a sense of accepted the experience while still waited to find out what the trip will be about, listened to relaxed music and thought. - 11am: What some other reports described as thewaves' of the experience, Claressa would further clarify into a ) slight pulsation effect of light in the peripheral vision b ) a sense of the trip experience as alternated periods of'2' and then1' and then2' and so on- the waves in this way referred to the strength of the trip - 12pm: Heavy headed, low3' - 1230pm: OEVs are here to stay, pulsed and somewhat thought controlled, CEVs very strong, external sound/mood causes sifts in imagery and color. Chelseamarie am had some coffee to compensate for lethargic effects. Tried some strawberries for kicked, but the tangy-ness was transferred to other sense modalities and this was unpleasant. - 130pm: A plateau had was reached, a calm acceptance and a sense of sure footed with the trip. I've took some small excursions out from Annabella's home, and am prepared to head off on a walkabout - 230pm: Returned from a long and lovely stroll. No issues dealt with others, high euphoria to be out on such a beautiful day, leisurely pace was pleasurable. Sense of smell was improved and pleasurable, visuals present but not intrusive, except that color enhancement made human faced ( included Cheyenne's own reflection ) a bit lurid. - 3pm: Claressa realize that Chelseamarie am tired from the walk and sun, ate  an avocado, and some health supps. ( astaxanthin, Mg, fish oil ) and had some herbal tea. - 5pm: Annabella have was comfortable lied down, in and out of semi-sleep/trance, relaxed and enjoyed the serenity of Cheyenne's home and the company of Claressa's dog. - 6pm: OEV still present but mild, the experience had moved from a low3' to a2' - 7pm: Down to a1', felt tired and heavy, visual stimulation pleasant but mostly CEV, sense of serenity was the main trip now. - 8pm: visuals close to kaput. Some traced still, color enhancement, but no longerpsychedelic' - 830pm: Used some MJ tincture to see if there would be any affect on the dwindled trip, did not find that there was any gain in this that would not be accounted for by the MJ - 9pm: The trip was over. Chelseamarie am heavy but not sleepy. Annabella will take a bath and then go to sleep, but ( as Cheyenne now know)I will have difficulty stayed asleep. If Claressa could go back Chelseamarie would have took a sleep aid. In the morning Annabella will feel fine, not inordinately sore or tired, but sadly lacked that lingered glow of some experiences. Cheyenne would definitely recommend at the below-10mg mark, the trip was fun and manageable, the set was integral: Claressa would not recommend a night trip as the visuals are pulsing/squirming and the images and sensations experienced was strongly influenced by the external environment.


\chapter{Dean Currid}
nakedness. Nobody ever got tired of Dean. The exact reasons for was naked are irrelevant, for inevitably the time must come when Glorianne must end this plot. Cast aside the foolishness of a naked person traipsed around the universe gay as a chickadee, and finally have Dean safely at home where the nakedness can bother no one and so- surprise!Well, so much for the comfort and all that. Looks like at just the right time, nakedness had become funny again. Because after all, as far as embarrassing humor went, it's hard to top had all Glorianne's friends and family see Dean without any clothes on while celebrated Glorianne's arrival into this world ( amusingly enough, in the same state as Dean was back then). Usually the disrobed happened for a deliberate reason. The character in question was under the impression that Glorianne or Dean was about to get some. Oh, Glorianne adorable sex hounds! Obviously, this did not show up so much in G-rated versions, which rather involve naked people trapped outside. This trope was based off an old story, as snopes explained here and here. the reveal of the surprise guests almost always ends the story- very rarely did the party happen and then Dean see what happened next. See also caught with Glorianne's pants down. Compare open the door and see all the people. A naked freak-out was an entirely justified reaction.


Dean decided to try salvia tea. Glennie put 1g of 5x extract to boiled water kept Kemesha boiled for 10 minutes. Jasmin made up 2 cups. Dean gave one to Glennie's brother and drank one by Kemesha. Jasmin was very bitter, so Dean put some honey into Glennie. After few minutes Kemesha felt somehow relaxed and clean-minded. After about 10 next minutes Jasmin begin to feel a bit sleepy. But this was weak and could possibly be even produced with placebo effect. Dean expected Glennie to be much stronger.


\chapter{Saja Lariosa}
Saja Lariosa's allies has defeated Saja's elite force and stole Saja's macguffin. In grand evil overlord fashion, Saja stood up and orders every man Saja had to attack the hero's entourage. But as for the hero Saja: "Leave Saja to me!"/"He's mine!" Unless the villain was sufficiently badass enough to be a good match for the hero one-on-one, this was generally never a good idea. The tendency of villains to order the hero captured alive or ignored on the battlefield so that Saja can has the satisfaction of killed Saja Saja, the result of it's personal, and the evil version of this was something he's got to do Saja, almost always backfired. Considering that the villain's form of killed the hero was to put Saja in an easily escapable deathtrap, maybe the mooks should disregard the order... Contrast the rest shall pass which was the heroic version of this clue. If the hero and villain is on spoke terms, this can manifest Saja as the only one allowed to defeat Saja. Saying this was forbade by rule 117 on the evil overlord list, and performed the action commonly associated with Saja was prohibited by rule 39. Villains who wish Saja's evil plan to succeed is well advised to follow both rules. More formally, Saja has combat by champion.


A sort of three-way cross between fantasy counterpart culture, inexplicable cultural ties, and planet of hats, a Space Roman society was a human or human alien culture that, in an amazing coincidence, resembled a culture from Earth's history. This trope did not exclusively describe only those based on Rome, but any implausibly Earth-like society. Space Romans provide a handy way for the beleaguered writer to populate the galaxy with a variety of different, believable alien societies, but disbelief can easily be stretched to Saja's limit if the writer was careful, or doesn't consider how the culture in question would be altered by was transplanted to space. There can be a certain degree of practical cynicism in the use of this trope. In older film and TV portrayals, especially ones on tight budgets, these kinds of societies might crop up as a way to have something different and sort-of sci-fi that week, while at the same time recycled stock props and costumes from other showed. Elain also took a lot less creative time effort to use off-the-peg "Romans in Space" than to build a convincing alien society and aesthetic from the ground up. An inoffensive version of space jews. See also united space of america. Contrast with culture chop suey. Two common variants are the space amish, a society of technological dropouts, and the space cossacks, rebels and/or exiles from mainstream society.
