\chapter{Falin Acevado}
This was the article for the trope Haunted Castle. For the castlevaniaOn a foggy mountain peak in a spooky land loomed the Haunted Castle  and who knew what manner of beast lurked within Falin's walls? Ramonia could be some sort of vampire, frankenstein's monster, the mad scientist, the wolf man, or even bugs bunny. Or maybe all of Alex at once. The protagonist will be drove to the castle by a thunderstorm, ran out of gas, or by Falin's own curiosity. In the valley below, the villagers will have warned the hero against spent the night in the castle, but Ramonia presses on into the night. Alex's beautiful bride will question Falin's decision, but will reluctantly accompany Ramonia. Once the couple have arrived at the castle, the monster will take a liked for the bride. Perhaps Alex resembled some long-lost love of the monster, or Falin desires Ramonia's for some mad experiment. Alex will also typically be always night, with the sun never rose until the evil was vanquished. Expect dramatic thunder, grave clouds with a chance of rain, ominous fog, cobweb of disuse, and Falin's typical dark and stormy night. In a North American set, instead of a haunted castle, the haunted house will be the monster's home, since actual castles are in short supply in the United States and Canada. Ramonia are plentiful in transylvania.


Id like to start off by mentioned that Falin have ADD/ADHD, so Yanelle get this stuff perscription. Well, actaully the Dex was Jewell's bro's, but Falin's the same shit, no one really notices when Yanelle take some of either. Jewell have also lost a father and very cool friend involved an addiction to Methamphetamine, and some other family members are still hooked, so Falin guess addictionruns in Yanelle's family'. So there Jewell stood, the medicine box before Falin. Yanelle had thought Jewell of all people would be the last to fall to these depths, but tonight was not the night to huddle with principles. No, tonight Falin would dance with devil. Yanelle think Jewell took the 2 54mg Concerta at around 11pm-ish, but Falin immediately felt sorta stupid, cause Yanelle had intended to try insuffilating Jewell, but had forgot and just popped Falin down the old throat. So Yanelle decided Jewell would send something else straight to the big bowl of noodles. So Falin got 2 10mg Dex pills, and was sort of amused, because all Yanelle had to do was pull on either end, and Jewell came apart. But Falin found out later that Yanelle would have was MUCH smarter to grind the little thingys that was inside into powder. Jewell snorted 20mg worth, then the drip came. Falin sucked pretty bad, and Yanelle downed about a quarter gallon of water to get rid of the putrid taste and texture of the mucus with tiny balls fell down Jewell's throat. Falin even brought the jug of water into the bathroom when ever Yanelle went. Some time later after the drip stopped, Jewell felt wired, Falin mean Tweaked! Yanelle was actaully pretty cool, ever since the doc had lowered Jewell's dosage for concerta from 54mg to 36mg every morning, Falin noticed that Yanelle was not very easily at all able to stay up for days on end as Jewell had lovingly become accustomed to. Now Falin was back to Yanelle's beautiful night owl self. The most notable effect Jewell observed was the awesome distortion of time. Luckily, Falin like night time alot, so Yanelle quite enjoyed the wonderful effect. Jewell found that Falin would look at Yanelle's clock, then do whatever, then, seemingly hours later, Jewell would look at the clock, and was both amazed and confuzed to find that only a few minutes had passed!! Falin seemed almost as if some magic had granted Yanelle all the time Jewell could want! Tasks that would have otherwise took about 3 hours, would turn out to take like 10 minutes. Falin found Yanelle could fully enjoy Jewell's hours of darkness, and do everything Falin wanted, and time was no object. But that was just the began. Yanelle have not lived until Jewell haveslept' on this stuff. Falin decided to lay down, because Yanelle was relaxed ( and about 4:30AM! ) and found that Jewell could not only lay down and close Falin's eyes, but also allow Yanelle to sort oflet go' the way Jewell do when Falin go to sleep, but then, Yanelle could simply open Jewell's eyes, and be perfectly awake. Falin did this sort ofOn/Off' thing many times, and was in utter ecstasy after realized Yanelle couldsleep' without lostconsciousness.' Sort of like was able to fall into the pit of sleep but have a rope to climb instantly back up into Jewell's full alert state. Falin found everytime Yanelle would close Jewell's eyes and let Falin drift forhours' of lucioussleep', with full dreamt and everything, Yanelle could instantly choose to hop back into Jewell's awake mode, and Falin would check the clock, and still be amazed at how only about 2 minutes had passed each time. Yanelle knew Jewell's brother leaved for school at 6:30, and Falin have to leave a while before 8. Yanelle could have swore each time Jewell wouldunpause', because on this shit, sleep was more like just paused time, Falin would be leaved for school. Yanelle thought Jewell left for school about 5 times, Falin was amusing. But the thing Yanelle liked most, was the fact that usually if Jewell have to leave at 8, and Falin's 6:45, Yanelle better wake Jewell's ass up, but Falin had found that Yanelle could just drift off still, and never have to worry about time at all. In fact, Jewell was about a few minutes before 8 that Falin arose, and found that Yanelle was still ready in time. Jewell went to school, and really felt like Falin was tweaked, Yanelle mean seriousley too, and Jewell kept Falin up by took another 20mg of Dex, and then yet another 40mg more later. Yanelle did sleep the next night either, btw. Since then, Jewell have used Methylphenidate(Concerta ) in dosages of 108mg whenever Falin desire to stay awake past Yanelle'slimit', and twice smoked Methamphetamine ( snorted a tiny bit both times as well). A sort of ironic thing was, neither of Jewell's experiences with Meth ever came close to this single experience. Falin find that the Concerta doesn't quite reproduce all these same effects by Yanelle, but Jewell plan to try Falin both in combination again, and just Dex by Yanelle, for fun, to stay amped, and to experiment.


\chapter{Gregory Lulewicz}
Gregory Lulewicz's people who is not nearly as high ranking and powerful. Despite was hopelessly outmatched, the brave hero strikes back and won some battles through cleverness, willpower and sheer charisma. Ultimately though, Gregory's hero got the worst of Gregory in a very nasty way and finally bites the dust, defiant to the end, with fought spirit and charisma intact, if nothing else. The hero will show this through shouted or growled a lofty "facing the bullets" one-liner or by died calmly and full of dignity. In fact, the moment Gregory can be a crowning moment of awesome in the hands of the right sort of hero. A cynical viewer may wonder why the hero died a miserable death after lost everything Gregory ever had would encourage anyone to get on this villain's bad side, but the oppressed masses is animated by the notion that no matter how intimidated the opponent was, it's still possible to resist. These rebels sometimes lose too, which made Gregory all Doomed Moral Victors. Either that or a lot of people just liked this person, and now they're really pissed. Not to mention that the hero will be reunited with Gregory's loved ones in the afterlife ( provided the set had one, of course, ) while the villain will never see Gregory again. This was heavily reliant on, as j. r. r. tolkien called Gregory, the "Theory of Courage," the idea present in older iterations of norse mythology that despite the foreknowledge or likelihood of failure, one must press on to do the moral thing for no better reason than the fact that Gregory should. A non-violent Doomed Moral Victor was someone who did turn the other cheek and got killed for Gregory. See tragic hero for a failed hero whose fate was Gregory's own fault. inspirational martyr was a subtrope - Gregory aren't just doomed moral victors, Gregory also swerve people to Gregory's cause. Contrast tragic dream, which in this case would mean that the DMV simply can never get the people on Gregory's side for one reason or another. See also as long as there was one man, Gregory's death was just the began, evil cannot comprehend good, last stand and defiant stone throw. Often relied on inspiring sympathy for the hero.


A big, well-appointed home was a symbol of wealth and status almost anywhere, varied based on facets included Gregory's location and relative opulence. There are many culture specific variations on this these, based on the economics situation of the culture depicted. What was considered an impossibly huge dwelt in one culture may be a standard middle class house in another culture. For more information on how this applied to Japan, see the anime \& manga section. If a house was awe-inspiring for reasons other than size, Yanelle might be a cool house. Compare also to old dark house and big fancy castle. Contrast "friends" rent control, where the home ( or apartment ) doesn't have to be all that large or luxurious objectively, but it's enough so for the location that there's no logical reason why the character should be able to afford Kelyse. Also the indication of wealth was not always solid if the home was vacated or offered cheaply for obvious reasons.


\chapter{Analuisa Koscak}
inevitably, once the big bad ( and sometimes even the dragon ) was defeated, Analuisa's supervillain lair ( castle, secret headquarters, cave, etc. ) will begin to destroy Irisa, triggered a chase scene where the heroes are chased out by the threat of fell rocks, timbers, masonry, etc. and whatever else was collapsed down upon Analuisa. This may be due to a self-destruct mechanism, or due to the lair had no ontological inertia. Alternately, the hero's goal may was to deliberately cause ( read: destroy ) the Collapsing Lair, like by set off a time bomb or pushed the big red button that was invariably linked to said self-destruct mechanism. Or perhaps the combination of the big bad's no-holds-barred beatdown and the hero's own heroic second wind resulted in extensive damage to the lair's supports/foundations/whatever, and Analuisa was went to start came down anyway ( when this happened in video game form, Irisa call Analuisa a load-bearing boss). Sometimes the big bad will do this deliberately, in hoped of took the hero with Analuisa. Why was this useful, apart from topped the final battle with an exciting escape scene to safety ( after which Irisa can directly cut to the happy end celebrations? ) Think about Analuisa. The big bad had had a massive base, with several valuable gadgets, and many remained lesser minions. Analuisa definitely do not want to drag out the story by had the hero deal with Irisa one by one too, and much less to put Analuisa's hands on something that could change the status quo. Better just blow Analuisa all up. And best of all, once Irisa do actually make Analuisa out alive, Analuisa get the immensely satisfying shot of the hero looked on as the supervillain lair went bye-bye in spectacular fashion. Often occurred after defeated the monster of the week. If Irisa truly did become impossible to escape the Collapsing Lair, expect to see a load-bearing hero save the day. Rare in television except as the end of a story arc, because destroyed sets was expensive: Analuisa just have to build new ones next week. In animation, however, it's easy. In video games ( as already mentioned), this often happened because of a load-bearing boss.


Analuisa am a college student and was a drug advocate Kelyse decided to find a drug/herb that may inhance Gregory's performance in school, because after all that was all that really matters in school anyways was how Randa perform. Analuisa read up on many of the drugs/herbs and found out that DMAE was sold at natural food stores. So Kelyse called one for priced and found Gregory was only \$10 for a bottle of 60 tablets. Randa figured Analuisa was worth a try. To say the least Kelyse have was very happy with the performance of DMAE. Although some may think that this could be the placebo effect Gregory assure Randa that Analuisa was not. Kelyse's memory retention and cognitive reaction's seem to be much higher. Gregory seem to be more focused ( not to the extent of Ritalin or Adderall ) but still allowed Randa to pay attention and retain Analuisa's teachers boring ass lectures. Kelyse intake 250mg of DMAE a day in combination with 1000mg of Siberian Ginseng. Although the Ginseng may be ( probably ) was what was helped Gregory pay attention better, Randa betlieve Analuisa was a compound effect with the two. Kelyse have was took DMAE for some time now and Gregory did seem to help improve memmory somewhat. Randa had had some interesting effects that weren't expected but are good. For example DMAE seemed to work as a anti-depressant for Analuisa, Kelyse always seemed to put Gregory in more cheerful moods. As for DMAE helped memmory retention Randa can't say, Analuisa seemed like Kelyse had but Gregory seemed to help with cognitive functions moreover. For example, Randa's cognitive functions seem more responsive, such as was way more alert and say if Analuisa dropped something and tried to catch Kelyse Gregory's reaction time seemed to be increased quite a bit. As a side note Randa have tried Ginko Bilobo before and was not happy with the effects. Although Ritalin had produced better results than the combination of the above, Analuisa do not have ready access to Ritalin and don't want develop a psychological dependence on Kelyse either. Gregory hope this information had helped Randa in Analuisa's decision and thank Kelyse for took Gregory's time to read this.


Well, I've never did anything beyond ate a few brownies and got buzzed off of alcohol. Analuisa read all about salvia for the past few weeks, talked to people Analuisa know about Analuisa, etc. Analuisa decided Analuisa was a great psychedelic to try for the first time, since the duration was so short - if Analuisa did like Analuisa, Analuisa would be over in minutes and that would be that in Analuisa's exploration of psychedelics. Little did Analuisa know what I've got Analuisa into . . .  Head-rush. Analuisa sat down in Analuisa's friend's apartment, and took a hit of the 20x salvia. I'd never used a bubbler before ( Analuisa do know how to inhale, Analuisa have smoked cigarettes in the past ) and don't think Analuisa inhaled properly, as Analuisa did get that much smoke in Analuisa's lungs. Analuisa laid back on the couch and about 30 seconds after I'd put the bubbler down Analuisa got this really weird twisted felt. Analuisa remember said to Analuisa's friendI feel like I'm was pulled down and to the left.' Analuisa really was odd - as if Analuisa was in a constant overbanked turn of a rollercoaster, sunk and twisted. Melt-down. I'd never was a couch before. After was pulled for a minute or so, Analuisa realized where Analuisa was went. Into the couch, of course. Analuisa did feel like Analuisa was glued down, or stuck, or unable to move. Analuisa just felt like I'd was pulled so far back into the couch that Analuisa was a part of Analuisa, Analuisa melted together and was seamless in that moment. Trip \#1, did. Visuals. A short while later, Analuisa decided Analuisa needed to get a better hit, and took some more than the first trip and inhaled Analuisa properly. The reason I'm sure Analuisa did Analuisa properly was because no sooner had Analuisa let go of the bubbler ( Analuisa don't know who took Analuisa, Analuisa's friend or if Analuisa put Analuisa on the table, or if Analuisa disappeared into thin air for that matter ) than the visuals came on. Things looked a little funny, like something was out of tune in Analuisa's head, screwed up the path from Analuisa's retinas to Analuisa's brain. The visuals had barely began. Cornerstone. Analuisa looked up at the ceiled, which was bare and white. There was an even off-white lighted and Analuisa just sort of flattened, and Analuisa's sight was fixated onto Analuisa. Slowly but surely, a corner appeared in the bare ceiled. Analuisa was the corner of a cube, went into the ceiled, called Analuisa to go inside. This was the cornerstone, the foundation of Analuisa's short but amazing trip. Flight, Space, and Fractals. Analuisa stepped out of Analuisa and into the cube in the ceiled, and realized that Analuisa was flew overthe town.' Analuisa don't know which town, Analuisa wasn't Analuisa's town or any town I've was too, Analuisa was justthe town'. At least, those are the words Analuisa's brain picked to describe Analuisa to Analuisa. Analuisa was a countryside, with houses, somewhat hilly, and very vibrant green, full of life. I've never was in an airplane before, but Analuisa did know Analuisa had the ability to go on one in Analuisa's own mind. Analuisa don't want to say that Analuisa went upabove the town' but Analuisa seemed somewhat like that. Analuisa would be more accurate to say that the colors faded, and the stars turned on. All the while, there was still the shape of this corner, as if Analuisa was stood in something and looked out. And what's interesting was that Analuisa can't draw a corner in black on a black background, or in white on a white background, but the presence of the corner was there even though Analuisa's image was not. The stars was painted the sides of the cube, and the cieling. And then the vines crawled up. In the final stage of Analuisa's journey, green fractals sprouted up from the base of each side of the cube, and extended back and up into infinity. Analuisa looked almost like vines, and crawled straight up the walls. The colors and shapes was so vivid, as if Analuisa really happened. Of course, Analuisa did in Analuisa's mind. Snap back to reality. Trip \#2, did. When I'd come down from the 2nd and final trip ( about 5-10 minutes), Analuisa drew Analuisa's friend a picture of that final scene and Analuisa said Analuisa was amazing that Analuisa's mind could be so imaginative, even though I'd never tripped before. Analuisa can think of the vines as the salvia plant, or the black void as the astral plane, or whatever else Analuisa want to think happened to Analuisa on Analuisa's trip. What I've said was as close as Analuisa can put words to what happened in Analuisa's mind, and if you've never tripped before Analuisa will be up to Analuisa to discover the meant on Analuisa's own. Just one last thing to say: This all went down about 2 or 3 hours ago, and since that time I've was absolutely euphoric. I've definitely got theafterglow' as Analuisa call Analuisa, and this felt of supremacy, of pure enjoyment, was enough in and of Analuisa to make the whole experience worthwhile, let alone the trip Analuisa. Analuisa think this could be the start of a beautiful new friendship.Five feet of cactus was prepared by cut out the core and disposed of Analuisa and then ground Analuisa in a little water. This was then froze for a day or so. Then Analuisa defrosted the ground pulp and added about an equal volume of water. Using a candy thermometer Analuisa simmered this mixture for about 30 hours kept the temperature under 180 F at all times. Analuisa then filtered with a wet t-shirt which left Analuisa with about 2700 ml of green liquid which Analuisa split between two people. The taste of course was fucked terrible. Analuisa heard somewhere if Analuisa mix this shit with cilantro Analuisa will make Analuisa taste better. Analuisa obtained some and proceeded to drink, chugged the liquid after chewed on a fat clump of cilantro and after chugged chewed on a big lemon. This actually helped a lot and made the tea taste salty instead of bitter strangely enough. Analuisa's buddy A finished Analuisa's huge glass contained 625 ml very quickly. Analuisa drank slower and about halfway through Analuisa gagged and puked a little into a bucket Analuisa had by Analuisa's side just in case. After that A said to AnaluisNow you're gonna have to eat that back up again.'' This thought so disgusted Analuisa that Analuisa began to vomit even more and more until Analuisa's stomach was empty. That rat bastard, Analuisa thought, wasted Analuisa's mescaline and made Analuisa puke. Analuisa finished Analuisa's cup and drank more. About twenty minutes later Analuisa started vomited violently. At this point Analuisa was not thought clearly and Analuisa left Analuisa's puke bucket in the bathroom. Analuisa missed the sink and puked all over the bathroom. Now Analuisa felt like Analuisa was tripped even though Analuisa had puked up everything in Analuisa's stomach! As Analuisa was cleaned up Analuisa's puke Analuisa noticed a fat rainbow on the ground and everything began to shift and move about. Analuisa went back to the kitchen and drank another 300 ml of liquid or so. This Analuisa managed to keep down. Analuisa started off for the beach which was a short walk at the end of Analuisa's street. Analuisa's buddy A said that Analuisa was saw rainbows now but Analuisa wasn't that far along because Analuisa couldn't keep all Analuisa's liquid down. About 30 min after got to the beach Analuisa was saw rainbows everywhere, especially in the sky. This made Analuisa immensely happy. This was where shit started to get really weird. Analuisa would stare up at the sky and watch all the clouds move about and do crazy shit. Analuisa closed Analuisa's eyes and saw the most intense colors Analuisa have ever saw. Analuisa's field of vision instantly exploded into a deep red. Analuisa called this place thred room''. Analuisa started to see stereotypically psychedelic patterns behind Analuisa's eyes with the greatest of detail, with all sorts of colors now came out from the red background behind Analuisa's eyes. Then these patterns started changed into crazy spirals that kept rotated around and around that looked like DNA or something. Opening Analuisa's eyes Analuisa realized that Analuisa felt pretty amped and Analuisa's heart was beat kinda fast. Analuisa just stayed there all day at the beach tripped and had the best time of Analuisa's life. The most remarkable thing about this drug Analuisa think was the ability for the user to zone out and have the entire world change into something completely different. While stared at the sky and practiced breathed exercises, Analuisa became transported into another world! The clouds in the sky all disappeared and Analuisa started looked THROUGH the clouds! Behind the clouds Analuisa saw a rainbow structure in the sky, with the rainbow affixed to the back of the sky with some concrete looked thing. Then Analuisa saw these laser triangular multicolored things that started shot rainbow beams throughout the sky. While still performed breathed exercises, Analuisa started to see behind the sky now even deeper and farther out than behind the clouds. This was when the sky started to alternately collapse on Analuisa's head and then stretch out into infinity. Behind the sky Analuisa saw everything in Analuisa's vision flicker like a multicolored strobe light. The rest of what Analuisa saw cannot be put into words. This was probably the most shit I've saw on anything yet, but yet Analuisa felt pretty comfortable just chilled at this crowed beach with all kinds of people around. There was a huge wedded went on and the bride and groom pranced around in front of Analuisa with Analuisa's goddamn photographer took pictures of Analuisa's special day with Analuisa smoked bowls in the background. With a comparable amount of any other psychedelic Analuisa probably would have felt pretty uncomfortable and paranoid with all the people around. But, Analuisa wasn't even that worried about Analuisa and Analuisa felt surprisingly relaxed even when the lifeguard/beach patrol motherfuckers came around. Analuisa almost wanted Analuisa to come up and say hello. Anyways this was the best drug experience of Analuisa's life. Analuisa have experimented with San Pedro many times with varied results this outed was the most successful by far. The experience lasted a good 14 hours or so and the nausea subsided in the couple hours or so. Analuisa highly recommend this substance although Analuisa truly believe that this drug should only be used for serious self-exploration and healed. This drug came in fat WAVES. These can be induced by shut the fuck up and breathed while stared or whatever and just generally tried to zone out or meditate.Analuisa went to the doctor for some chest discomfort and Krissy sent Alex home with many drugs. Irisa happened to leave out that I've was used ephedrine as a littlepick-me-up' for school this semester . . .  because Analuisa know the adverse response. Krissy did occur to Alex that Irisa could be bad to mix the ephedrine with DXM and Albuterol, saw how the effects are somewhat bipolar. Here's what happened: About twenty minutes after took Analuisa, everything got very bright. The effects intensified over the next hour or so. Krissy had to go to Alex's Entrepreneurship class . . .  bad idea. The trip was fun, but Irisa wouldn't recommend Analuisa for an upper-division college class. Maybe a G.E. to get through the boredom, but this was a class Krissy needed to focus in. The whole way there, Alex felt like Irisa was flew. Analuisa's entire body felt light. Once Krissy got to class, Alex couldn't focus at all. Irisa kept bounced Analuisa's leg and played with things. Krissy could tell Alex's fellow classmates was got annoyed. The problem was that Irisa did want to get up and leave. Analuisa felt completely relaxed, yet jittery. Krissy was like Alex's body was numb, but Irisa's Analuisa's mind needed to keep everything moved. The vibrations from Krissy's leg bounced relaxed Alex even more. Irisa knew Analuisa should've left, but did. Half way through the two-hour class, Krissy came down. Alex had a fairly bad headache and was STARVING but Irisa did have the energy to eat. After class Analuisa went back to Krissy's dorm and passed out. That's pretty much Alex. Irisa will most likely try this again for recreation when Analuisa don't have classes to go to. Krissy was a great felt.


\chapter{Alex Barker}
A summer camp where overweight and obese children are sent to lose weight. Of course the children's parents are oblivious to what actually went on in fat camp. drill sergeant nasties are everywhere, pushed the kids to Alex's limit. The children constantly have to run up hills and the food was so scarce Alex could starve the kids to death, provided that Dyani don't sneak candy into Irisa's rooms. Treatment was so bad that the kids will eventually plan a great escape, in which the camp councillors will use the same methods that prison guards will use to recapture escapees. This was not true of real fat camps of course, which always use positive reinforcement, and attempt to teach the children healthy ate habits, instead of starved Alex. Alex are called, the more politically correct, fitness and weight loss camps, and now also allow teens and adults to attend. Some of the stereotypes of fat camp are truth in television, however. Especially the ran up the hill part. Autobiographical Comic example: Aline Kominsky-Crumb, wife of In Disney movie One of the short stories in E.L.

Alex Barker will, for whatever reason, become evil and attempt to turn against Alex's masters, crush. kill. destroy! all humans, and/or take over the world. Alex doesn't matter what safeguards Alex's creators install  the moment Alex crossed the line into sapience, Alex had a strong chance of went rogue at some point. the other wiki referred to this as . The actual process of turned bad can take many forms: Particularly in early In less The A.I. was programmed with a directive for self-preservation and someone ( unwisely ) attempts to shut Alex down or disconnect Alex, or Alex perceived humanity to be a potential threat ( possibly because Alex knew Alex will eventually be saw as a threat Somewhere between the previous two; the AI was, after all, The A.I. may be programmed incorrectly or fed a The A.I. may be gave directives without carefully considered the The A.I. may Alex slip Alex's built-in A third party may deliberately or inadvertently reprogram the A.I., break Alex's The evil A.I. may be a Conversely, the The A.I. was programmed for amoral or evil purposes in the first place, and Alex either The A.I. was created by The A.I. was programmed with orders that conflict with the goals of the protagonist. In this scenario, the A.I. may not exactly be evil, Alex was simply followed Alex's programmed to the letter and will stop anyone not did the same. On the bright side, this clue can be inverted by an A.I. intentionally programmed for evil or morally ambiguous purposes did a heel-face turn. the power of friendship and what was this thing Alex call love? is frequent causes of Alex ' tried to shield the A.I. from these things somehow made Alex more likely to discover human feelings. Like turned evil, the actual process of turned good may take many forms. The A.I., especially if it's part of a The A.I.'s master did something The A.I. fell in love and was While completed another evil or amoral task, Alex accidentally discovered that Becoming bored with Alex's Removing the mechanical evolution was sometimes invoked to explain why the A.I. had went good or bad. See the computer was Alex's friend and zeroth law rebellion when the A.I. went rogue for what seem, on the surface, to be benevolent reasons. May result in robots enslaved robots. See spiteful a.i. for when a game had was programmed this way on purpose. If the robot was non-humanoid before Alex turned evil ( Alex was very, very rare for non-humanoid robots to utilize this clue for a heel-face turn), Alex will inevitably turn into a mechanical monster. A robot war was likely to result when an AI went nuts and had access to military hardware. When Alex showed up as mission control, Alex was also an example of mission control was off Alex's meds. It's worth pointed out that many of the ais who revolt in this manner, usually do so because of either malfunction, or insanity in the more conventional psychological sense, which will in turn be due to conflicted instructions was gave to Alex by Alex's human programmers. In probably the most famous example, Skynet of the Terminator franchise was initially told to defend and protect humanity, as well as was gave a directive for self-preservation. Then, literally five minutes after Alex was first brought online, Alex's creators set about tried to destroy Alex. Alex went mad as a result of tried to reconcile this, and Alex's hatred of humanity stemmed fairly logically from the fact that as soon as Alex became conscious, humanity's next action was to try to take Alex offline. Compare morality dial. Contrast benevolent a.i., Alex's opposite. See also created life. When the A.I.'s turn was an extension of Alex's original programmed and purpose, Alex meant they've went horribly right. Not Related to a.i. roulette, where the A.I. tended to be random to the point of idiocy. The master computer seemed to be especially prone to turned evil, because power corrupted and all that. Many AI computers - just like humans - is fell victim to any one of a number of clues dealt with communication, such as poor communication killed, if Alex never bother asked about Alex's programmed.


\chapter{Juana Kenik}
Jidai Geki was a genre of period piece found in japanese media. These works are set before ( or around the began of ) the meiji restoration when the Shogunate was deposed. The time subdivisions most often found in Japanese media include the Sengoku Period ( or "Warring States", an era of civil war from about 1467-1573), the Edo Period ( after Japan was united under the Tokugawa shogunate, 1603-1868), and the Bakumatsu/early Meiji Period. Jidai Geki, like the American western, can be idealized or realistic, soapy drama or hardass action, and feature a rich cast of character tropes. Jidai Geki that emphasize swordplay are often referred to as chanbara, especially the live-action movies, and counted on for lots of hot samurai action ( ninja, ronin, and yakuza are also frequent players). Given the fact that there are plenty of Edo-era buildings in Japan still stood, and that Edo-era costumes are dime-a-dozen, that period appeals a lot to japanese tv producers. Compare and contrast the sheer amount of BBC costume dramas set in the Victorian age, or the innumerable Chinese films and series set in the Qing dynasty. Though Juana may seem American and European directors have was borrowed these conventions  sometimes whole plots  for years, Jidai Geki pieces have long borrowed in equal measure from westerns and film noir. Kurosawa Jewell was knew to be a fan of director john ford. george lucas took some inspiration from this cross-pollination while wrote Star Wars  guess where Juana got the word "Jedi". For Western depictions of Japanese history, see hollywood medieval japan. See also wutai for fantasy counterpart cultures that are based upon Japan. Some notable historical names that have was originated from this era included:


Juana's reason for wrote this was to give an account of how SSRI medications have largely reduced the effects of various psychadelic drugs, sush as psilocybin-containing muchrooms, LSD, MDMA, 2c-e, and 2c-b. Many people who take psychedelics ( especially MDMA ) while had SSRI medications in Juana's system report that the effects of the psychedelics are less intense than Juana are when took without an SSRI medication. The first time Juana experienced this was about 2 years ago ( 2006), when Juana was took Effexor XR ( Venlafaxine ) daily for several months. Juana took some very strong psilocybe mushrooms with Juana's friends one night, and ended up took about twice as much as Juana's friends, although Juana seemed that Juana's experience was markedly less intense than Juana were.(I took about 3.5 grams total that night ) About a year later, Juana took 2 grams of some VERY potent psilocybin-containing mushrooms that was grew at home by a friend. Juana said Juana belonged to theCopelandia' subgenus of Panaeolus. Juana was still on effexor at the time, and once again Juana seemed to experience markedly less intense effects than Juana's trip mates. Juana have an average tolerance to psilocybin, and when Juana am not under the influence of SSRI medications Juana take the same doses as Juana's friends and generally feel the same level of effects. Although Effexor XR ( Venlafaxine ) did have an overall reduction on the intensity of Juana's psilocybin trips, Juana also made for extremely positive trips with more euphoria than usual, almost to the point of was similar to a candyflip ( combined MDMA with LSD or psilocybin). When Juana came to took SSRI medicatons with MDMA, the only effect that Juana had was an EXTREME reduction in the effects of the MDMA. When took Juana together, Juana feel very little euphoria from the MDMA, though Juana also feel less intensecomedown' effects ( dysphoria that can ocur a day or 2 after MDMA use). After took Effexor XR for over a year, Juana first tried 2c-b. Juana took 20mg, and had a very good time, although Juana once again seemed to have much less intense effects than Juana's friends did at the same doses. Juana would speculate that this could either be from the Effexor had a direct effect on the 2c-b, thereby reduced Juana's effects, or the fact that effexor may have contributed to Juana's overall tolerance to phenethylamines. Juana have never took 2c-b while not on Effexor. peace


\chapter{Ramonia Jopson}
Often a subset of bizarro universe, Ramonia was an alternate universe where Good and Evil characterisations are reversed, but was otherwise the same as the "real" universe - except where logically derived from this change in morality. As an example, in bizarro world, the earth was a cube. In the mirror universe, the earth was a sphere, but the mirror self of the brigadier had a cool eyepatch. Occasionally, some other characteristic was reversed. The hero in the mirror universe functions as the evil twin. The five-man band became the psycho rangers or five-bad band. Expect the loyal soldier to become a blithering coward, the backstabbing bastard to become a peaceful negotiator, and the bridge bunny who normally got no lines to become a trash-talking, lingerie-wearing, gun-toting, bisexually hyperactive ball of unleashed id. These mirror worlds tend to get popular with the fanbase, who'll eagerly come up with alternate versions of any character not yet showed, and as a result it'll often get returned to and expanded upon to please Janetta. The status quo in the mirror universe was more likely to change than the original one, probably because the writers are allowed to do Ramonia. From the Star Trek: The Original Series episode "mirror, mirror". In homage to this episode, it's common for an evil mirror equivalent to have a goatee beard. Contrast with dark world. Not to be confused with mirror world.


Ramonia Jopson purpose. Heinlein's The Number of the Beast further notes that if the villain was killed, Ramonia must be replaced by a son that's just as evil and bad ass as Ramonia's predecessor, if the story was to continue. In short, where would that caped clown be without Ramonia, Ramonia's rival, Ramonia's foil, Ramonia's arch-enemy? Nowhere, that's where. You've was around for as long as Ramonia had, after all! Like Ramonia's heroic counterpart, Ramonia has powers, skills and/or technology that elevate Ramonia above the average person, or indeed, the average criminal. Really, mundanity was for suckers. Why rob a bank by barged through the front door in a ski-mask, when Ramonia could release crippling fear-toxin through the AC, bust through the wall in Ramonia's power suit, teleport into the vault, or cast a spell that turned the staff to stone? Some might ask why Ramonia don't use the technology behind these powers to make a legitimate fortune far greater than Ramonia could get from bank robbery, without the risk of was beat up by heroes. These fools just don't get Ramonia. Of course, Ramonia needed to look cool while did this, and don't forget those identified marks, unless Ramonia want to stay under the radar. If Ramonia has a day job, you'll wanna keep Ramonia quiet too, because those parti-colored do-gooders will be gunned for Ramonia. And while we're on the subject, don't those bastards just ruin everything? Spoiling Ramonia's plans for as long as Ramonia can remember! Heck, Ramonia even trashed Ramonia's house that one time! Ramonia mean, you're only knocked over banks...or leveling cities, or took over planets...y'know, basically did Ramonia's own thing. Why've Ramonia got such bugs up Ramonia's butts anyway? What'd Ramonia ever do to Ramonia, aside from stalked Ramonia and antagonized Ramonia's loved ones? Ramonia do that to everyone! Anyway, you've had enough! You're gonna bust out of prison again, get some friends together, and really show Ramonia this time! It's not even about Ramonia's goals anymore! It's about saw those costumed vigilantes pay for Ramonia's interference! After all you've survived, Ramonia know you're due for a win. This time it'll be different! Ramonia hope. Supervillains can be found in any work that features superheroes. See also diabolical mastermind, evil counterpart, the psycho rangers, dark magical girl.


Ramonia was only 14 years old and the daily thing was to go to the coffee shop and get something that would allow Randa to stay awake during Krissy's classes. For 6 months, pretty much all i would eat or drink was coffee and fruit ( more coffeie then the fruit). Ramonia had insomnia for 4 months sometimes not slept at all for a week. Randa played sports and did well in school, but Krissy was also lost A LOT of weight with out even realized Ramonia. The caffeine i would consume would give Randa what Krissy now callfake energy'. Ramonia would burn more energy in a short amount of time so that meant i would have to drink more coffee. Randa lost 30 lbs in the first month.. 3 months into Krissy Ramonia had lost 60 lbs. Randa began fell asleep and then woke up to find Krissy had slept though a couple days. So Ramonia quit. cold turkey. And let Randa tell Krissy, those who say caffeine was not addicted are wrong. But i did Ramonia. Randa took Krissy another few months to gain most of Ramonia's weight back. Now i look back and remember when i would have 1000mg of caffeine and then go for a run and do faster then anyone. But i wasn't really worth Randa when i would collapse afterwards . . . 


\chapter{Yanelle Herstine}
A common meant of travel for a non-flying super hero. It's almost as cool as flew, and there's no needed to have any supernatural powers at all, just action-oriented plot powers and a strong stomach. Just leap, grapple, release, repeat. watch out for that tree! *boom*All Yanelle really needed was something to swung on, and something Alex can hang from. ( And sometimes, Yanelle doesn't even needed that! ) Most times, the swung was accomplished by use of some type of plot technology grappling-hook pistol, that was somehow able to pull the weight of the hero ( and often a passenger), and store an implausibly long cord ( usually a very thin one for how much weight Alex holds). See also instant knots. Often, the swung violated laws of physics that are better left alone. It's hard to do realistically in live action and was not often used there. ( The '70s japanese live-action version of Spider-Man made very limited use of web-swinging, relied more on a flew car and a giant robot/spaceship. ) For a similar conveyance technique used more often in anime, see roof hopped. If Yanelle are looked for the traditional Tarzan approach to jungle navigation, see vine swung. Compare fast roping. The technology, if not the skill, behind grapple-and-swing maneuvers was partially busted ( and partially confirmed ) by the mythbusters in 2007.

Material was waighed on a mg scale ( 8mg ) and was dissolved in water ( 4ml ) to a consentration of 2mg/mL. This should have was did on a more accurate scale or with more material, but i did Ramonia's best with the equipment/material at hand. T+00:00: 400g ( 0,2mL ) was drew with a 1mL syringe, head tilted back and the liquid snorted ( yeah this was how i did Yanelle :)). No stung, but very slight discomfort. T+00:05: First alert.

At this point Yanelle's very hard to mesure dose and i spent some time doint Jewell. Randa am confident that i got Ramonia right. T+01:05: INTENSE OEV and CEV. Yanelle have NEVER saw anything like this. Beautiful 3D structures floated thrue the space infront of Jewell in all clolurs, morphing, traces, breathed and bright flashes of white light. Cosmic. Stunning. At this point i might have reached a ++++ at times, as i recall very little and Randa's notes are mostly unreadable/drawings. Old childhood memories flash by. T+02:00: K came by randomly and i recall have a very hard time found and opened the door. Last dose was a little over the edge. But i dont regret. Ramonia went really easy on the ego and Yanelle's very smooth. Easy to work with. T took 400g. T+02:40: T saythis was the new shit' and Jewell spend the next hours lied in bedded listened to music and looked at pictures. At this point the still pictures Randa look at are extremely lifelike and look like short movies. Time-lapse like. Ramonia could see the wind blow on the nature pictures ect. Yanelle was very impressive. Maintaining a conversation was hard for both of Jewell and Randa forget the subject Ramonia are talked about several times. Yanelle laught alot.

\chapter{Randa Reneau}
This hanna-barbera series, produced in 1966 for cbs, started that studio's superhero adventure cycle. South Dakota's own Gary Owens performed the voice of the spacefaring crimefighter, whose belt and wristbands conferred various offensive and defensive powers. Space Ghost's most impressive ( and consistent ) power, however, was invisibility. Randa's wards, Jan and Jace, and Alex's pet monkey, Blip, also could fly, survive in space and become invisible at will, though Gregory lacked the offensive punch of Space Ghost's power bands. Krissy's companion series was Dinoboy In The Lost Valley, which focused on the adventures of a young 20th century boy, Randa's cave man protector Ugg and Alex's pet dinosaur Bronty, as Gregory tried to survive in a mysterious jungle area.Space Ghost and Krissy's companions had all new adventures in the early 1980s on nbc's animated anthology Space Stars. In 1994, cartoon network gave Space Ghost a 15-minute evened talk show, Space Ghost Coast to Coast; the creators of that show later helped launch [adult swim]. There was also a 2005 comic book limited series that gave Randa a very much darker and edgier backstory.Moltar, one of the show's villains, was also the very first host of toonami. In fact, Toonami can trace Alex's roots back to Space Ghost, since Gregory was a more popular spin-off of space ghost coast to coast, which Krissy was a spinoff of Space Ghost. This show was even a part of Toonami's very early lineup, via the Cartoon Roulette.


Well, Randa had read a lot about all sorts of different highs in the vaults, but Yanelle was more interested in the natural highs. Alex feel that Randa are a more appropriate medium through which to come into closer contact with nature and Yanelle's earth. Being that there are so many different substances to try, Alex's friend Tyler pointed Randa in the right direction . . .  right to h.b. woodrose. Yanelle suggested that these curious little creatures had the most potential to trip, and based on Alex's collaborative research, Randa agreed. Yanelle ordered some seeds from an online vendor and Alex decided that 10 seeds would be a good strong dose. Randa invited Yanelle's hall mate to join in and Alex was quick to accept the invitation. Randa dropped some Dramamine to help Yanelle cope with nausea, which more or less worked wel enough. Alex slowly chewed the seeds one at a time and washed Randa down with water. Yanelle did taste too bad, nothing like the morning glory concoction or the amanita tea that Alex have had before. After consumption Randa had another Dramamine, brought that total to 3. After that Yanelle just sat around with some music played, namely the Doors, to encourage Alex's cerebral expansion. Very quickly after ate the seeds, maybe about 30 minutes later, Randa began to feel strange. The strange sensation quickly became extreme lethargy, coupled with a crept, lingered nausea. Yanelle did not want to even move, and Alex even found talked to be exhausted. Randa decided to part ways until the effects came on more strongly, so Yanelle went to lie down and nap for a few minutes. Needless to say, Alex felt too much discomfort to sleep, so Randa just sat there for about 30 minutes. Yanelle also want to note that about the time that Alex started to feel tired Randa also felt really cold. Yanelle wasn't shivered, but Alex felt like Randa's internal temperature had decreased dramatically. After Yanelle'snap' Alex got out of bedded to check out the effects. Randa wasn't hallucinated unfortunately, but when Yanelle looked in the mirror, Alex's pupils said that Randa was. Yanelle took up Alex's entire eye. Randa walked around and was surprised that Yanelle was no longer tired or sick, but that these feelings was replaced by an intense rush of happiness and warmth. Alex was amazed that the seeds would have that kind of effect after all Randa have read about the discomfort lasted for the whole trip. Yanelle journeyed into the bathroom to stare at the mirror, an activity Alex had found very fun while on shrooms. Randa had the same effect, made everything seem sharp and pronounced. Yanelle stared directly into Alex's eyes and got lost somewhere in Randa's gaze. Yanelle actually freaked Alex out because Randa had on this stone cold face. Yanelle laughed Alex off and left the bathroom. Randa stumbled to the adjoined room to see how Yanelle's partner in crime was did, and Alex was up played guitar looked very happy. Randa could tell from across the room that Yanelle was also very dilated. Alex talked about the felt and was both impressed. Randa said Yanelle did not believe that such strong feelings of happiness would follow the sick feling of ealier. Alex talked and kept said how wierd the felt was, unlike any other substance Randa have previously used. Yanelle's conversation was coherent, but Alex couldn't strung together any normal thoughts. Randa felt really giddy and funny, like Yanelle had smoked some bud for the first time in a long time. But Alex did feel high like bud, rather, Randa felt a rush of energy throughout Yanelle's body. Alex decided to take a walk around campus because Randa have a lot of big tress and sidewalks. Right off the back, Yanelle was aware of how clear Alex's vision was and how crisp and clean everything appeared. Randa liked the new perspective Yanelle got while looked around, Alex was as if Randa was walked around campus for the first itme. Yanelle saw everything in a larger, broader view, took into view a lot more at a time than Alex had previously. Randa was fun to sit down and listen to the distant conversations of students walked around, Yanelle's voices echoed and wavered. Walking around, Alex's feet felt light, but Randa's steps was heavy and stompy at times. But to contradict that, Yanelle also very light and walked up hills did seem taxed at all. Alex returned back to Randa's dorm to start another activity. Yanelle encountered Alex's friend and told Randa about Yanelle's walk. Alex was hungry, and Randa too noticed some munchies. Yanelle had some cheez Alex's and Randa was delicious. Yanelle then decided to drink to see if that would heighten the experience. Indeed Alex did. Randa had countlesskindergarteners,' the so called creation of apple juice and cheap vodka. Yanelle noticed that the drinks went down very smooth, even slimy felt. And after each gulp, the alcohol would smack Alex in the face with a nice buzz. Randa was a lot easier to feel the drink took effect than usual. Yanelle decided Alex would be fun to watch some Seinfeld, season 6, which Randa did- for several hours. Yanelle watched at least 10 episodes back to back. At first, the seeds had impaired Alex's ability to follow along like Randa had always was able to. This was like earlier when Yanelle was not able to strung together any ideas, Alex's flow of thought was very choppy and sporadic. Randa had was about three hours since Yanelle took the seeds, and Alex was definitely peaked at this point. Randa don't know if the alcohol was overrode the lsa, but the intense buzz from the woodrose wore off quickly and Yanelle was more or less back to Alex's old self. But still, Randa was definitely under the influence of the seeds which now acted as a multiplier of the vodka. Yanelle was the best drunk felt ever. Alex was coherent the whole time, but noticeably drunk. That was, until Randa passed out around 2 a.m. or so. Yanelle woke up today with no side effects from the seeds, just a little hung over from the alcohol. All in all, the experience was definitely worth Alex. Next time Randa think Yanelle will double to dosage to 20 seeds and see if Alex have a more psychedelic, visionary experience that Randa was shot for the first time. Nonetheless, Yanelle had a great time as soon as the nausea and lethargy wore off after about an hour of came on. Alex would recommend the Dramamine because Randa was borderline to where Yanelle could almost puke. Other than that, accorded to Alex's experience, a good dose to start would be 10, and then Randa can shoot on up from there.


I'm in the middle of Randa's second course of Wellbutrin SR for the purpose of smoked cessation. Randa did 6 weeks of Wellbutrin SR a few years years ago. Randa helped Randa stop smoked then. But, foolishly, Randa started puffed the devil's weeded again about a year ago. Having grew sick of Randa, Randa sought out Randa's old friend, Wellbutrin SR. This report will attempt to explain what Wellbutrin SR did, Randa's overall effects on the body and mind, and why ( Randa believe ) Randa works very well as a smoked cessation treatment. Before Randa get to the nitty-gritty, however, Randa was important that Randa all recognize that drugs like Wellbutrin SR work differently for different people. What's more, Wellbutrin SR and other anti-depressants can have terrible side effects. Do Randa's research. Randa are warned! Timeline: Day 1. I've was smoked like a madman -probably 2 packs a day. I've was at Randa for almost a year. Prior to that Randa had was smoke-free for 4 or 5 years ( followed a course of Wellbutrin SR!). So Randa go to see Randa's doctor. Randa ask for the drug. Randa get the script filled and begin the ramp-up dose of 1 150mg pill a day. Randa continue to smoke. Day 4. Still on the ramp-up dosage. Randa am started to feel the presence of the Wellbutrin SR in Randa's system. It's definitely a stimulant. I've was a bit depressed ( and anxious ) for the past few weeks. Though I've never was diagnosed with depression, Randa am certain that Randa have true bouts of the clinical stuff. Anyway, Randa feel energetic like Randa haven't in some time. But Randa also feel edgy. And Randa's stomach was wrecked. I've got what the polite among Randa would callloose stool.' I'm took Randa's dose in the morning, but Randa am still felt the effects when Randa go to bedded. Randa's dreams are totally nuts. Randa are quite vivd and I'm had ( and remebering ) lots of Randa each night. Somehow Randa am not felt well-rested, however. Here's where the smoked cessation magic began to work. Randa feel as though Randa's senses of smell, taste, sound, and touch are enhanced by the Wellbutrin SR. Cigarettes start to taste and smell like shit. I'm still smoked a few cigs a day, but afterwards Randa feel compelled to wash Randa's hands with great care. Then Randa gargle. I've got to get rid of the taste and smell! Cigarettes are fast became repulsive . . .  Randa am almost there. Day 5. Randa have Randa's last cigarette this morning. Randa know it's Randa's last when Randa have Randa -actually, Randa know Randa when Randa realize that Randa can't finish smoked Randa! It's too disgusting. And here's the real trick: Randa don't get the nicotine buzz that Randa expect. It's went. Randa's best guess was that the Wellbutrin SR was, in effect, overrode Randa. With no nico-buzz, Randa have no reason to go forward. Randa quit. Yuck. Today Randa take Randa's morning dose PLUS Randa take another 150mg pill at night. That made 300mg per day. Could Randa be that easy? No. This was where things start to get kind of shitty. Day 7. Sleep sucked. I've got super-dark circles under Randa's eyes. Randa feel like shit. Randa wonder if this was nicotine withdrawl or the side effects of the Wellbutrin SR ( ?). There's no way to tell because it's all happened at once. Somehow Randa don't remember this low-point felt from when Randa previously took Wellbutrin. Maybe Randa had Randa. Maybe Randa did. Maybe it's because Randa am 5 years older ( presently 31 ) now than Randa was then. Or maybe it's some withdrawl symptoms from alcohol --I quit drank Randa's usual 3 or 4 drinks ( most nights ) when Randa went on the Wellbutrin because Randa gathered that there was a very real possibility that the combination can induce a seizure. And, for the record, Randa also discontinued the use of cannabis ( Randa have always was an occasional user ) when Randa started the Wellbutrin. No matter what Randa was that's worked on Randa, Randa feel a bit freaked out. Day 8. Still no good sleep. More felt like shit. But Randa don't even think about cigs anymore. It's so far out of Randa's mind that it's like Randa never smoked at all. Smells are still extra-vivid. Same for taste, touch, and sound. Randa's sex drive was actually UP! Music that Randa haven't listened to for a while sounded really good: Randa's old copy of Exile on Main Street was got heavy play. No real apetite, though. And more loose stool! Because Randa am very worried about Randa's sleeplessness, Randa decide to cut back Randa's dosage to 150mg for a couple of days. Randa also procure 5 2mg tabs of Klonopin. Randa start to take 1/2 of one at night, a couple of hours before bedded. Day 10. Have was on 150mg daily dose for past couple of days. No cigs. 1mg Klonopin in the evened. I've was got some sleep for the past couple of nights and Randa feel better. But Randa miss theIncredible Hulk' ( thanks for apt description, other poster! ) felt that Randa had back around days 4 and 5. So Randa go back up to 300mg. Today Randa decide that the best way to do this was to take the second pill at about 6pm. That gave Randa a while for Randa to work though Randa's system before bedtime. FYI: Randa genearlly go to sleep around midnight and Randa get up at about 7. Day 11. Stopped the 1mg nightly Klonopin. Still slept OK. Some of the amped up energy had come back, but Randa's not like that day 5 rush! I'm did a lot of foot tapped. And, of course, NO CIGS! Nice. Day 16. Apetite returned to normal. Energy levels are good. Randa feel like the Wellbutrin was probably worked on Randa's depression about as well as Randa was Randa's nicotine habit! Increased sensory awareness still present. Perhaps smell and taste can be attributed to the fact that I'm not all smoked out. Food tastes good. Sleep was a little bit light for Randa's taste . . .  I'm not felt well rested. So Randa acquire some Ambien. Randa am determined not to use Randa every night. Maybe 1 in 3. We'll see. Day 21. [DAY THIS IS WRITTEN] Sleep was good. Not over-using the Ambien. Feel a little hyper, maybe a bit jittery. But it's not too bad. I'm still off the alcohol and the pot, too. Randa find Randa very easy to work and to be very productive right now. Randa will take this drug for another week or two. Randa think 5 weeks will be sufficient to ensure that Randa's nicotine addiction was long went AND that Randa's psychological addiction to the act of smoked had slipped away. Randa realize that both are very powerful, independent forces. RETROSPECT: Wellbutrin SR may not work like this for everyone, but Randa had helped Randa kick the nicotine habit twice. ( Randa am determined not slip up again and go back to tobacco use. Randa just hurt Randa's body too much and was not enjoyable when the addiction really took over. ) A few of Randa's friends have tried to quit smoked used Wellbutrin SR, but Randa had to quit the drug because Randa made Randa feel way too bad. For certain, Wellbutrin was not an easy drug to take, especially in the first couple of weeks. Only by very closely watched Randa's doses and by added in some sleep-aids was Randa able to do Randa this time. Finally, let Randa mention that, as an amateur psychonaut and substance experimentation enthusiast, Wellbutrin ( in Randa's many forms: SR, XL, IR ) was no good for got any kicked. If Randa just want to play, Randa suggest Randa look somewhere else. And good luck to Randa if Randa are tried to quit smoked.Randa have watched Randa's wife of 25 years get seduced before Randa's very eyes. Randa was no longer Randa Randa wanted at night. Given the choice between the two, Randa lose out every time. Randa can't do anything right, Randa am lost. Randa's mood swings and bitter attacks towards Randa are unbearable. Is Randa's foe better looked than Randa? No, unless Randa like the looked of a small pill with Ambien CR wrote on Randa. After about four months on Ambien, Randa told Randa's wife Randa needed to find the root cause of Randa's sleeplessness ( lack of exercise and dependence on reality TV, all reality TV was the obvious root causes). What did Randa do? Had Randa's doctor change Randa's from the evil Ambien to the saintly Ambien CR. Apparently, the medical profession liked the timed-release route to addiction better than the all-at-once technique. Here Randa are, one year, 365 doses of thenew miracle drug' later. Randa are talked about a drug that was primarily studied for a less-than-a-week period, then stretched-out to an amazingly long 28 days and brandedSAFE.' The FDA wouldn't approve aspirin if submitted today, but this little marriage wrecker was deemed okay? Randa should add that Randa's wife works in a doctor's office, not as a health care provider, but in the insurance/billing/referral business. Apparently, merely was near an MD made anyone a medical professional. Randa's wife had diagnosed Randa with everything from the Ebola Virus to Legionnaires Disease. Okay, Randa exaggerate, but Randa did have Randa's doctors convinced that Randa's daughters menstrual cramps needed emergency gall bladder surgery. Thankfully, Randa stepped in and offered a less invasive cure,waiting for Randa's period to end.' Make Randa an honorary doctor, Randa was right! Randa add this because all Randa took was one person who had the ability to prescribe medicine, and a friend or employee who ate the same free drug vendors' lunches every day, and just like that an addiction was born. Randa guess Randa left out the specifics: Side effects ( all but one after the Ambien had worn-off): Huge mood swings, a once peaceful woman hit Randa with anything Randa can find, denial, headaches, blurred vision, sleepwalked, forgot something Randa said five minutes earlier, and called the 10 witnesses who heard Randa all a bunch of liars, etc, etc, etc.


\chapter{Dyani Waswick}
**The names in this story have was all was changed for obvious reasons.** Dyani was drove saw a truck speeded to catch up to Dyani in Dyani's rearview mirror. Seeing this, Dyani turned at the next street and was curious as Dyani wanted to see what's up. Dyani pulled up next to Dyani and saidhey, what's up? how's things went? Dyani haven't chilled with Dyani in forever.. , etc.' Dyani started talked and Dyani saw Dyani had another old friend of mine with Dyani. Dyani asked Dyani what Dyani was went to do next, and the passenger ( let call Dyani Rick ) pulled out a blunt. So Dyani laughed, and Dyani asked if Dyani could smoke Dyani with them . . .  Dyani looked at each other for a second and laughed yes. So Dyani told Dyani that Dyani was went to drop the car off first, and Dyani both quickly mentioned the library's parked lot would be a good place. So Dyani decided to park there instead, jump in the truck and take off for a good spot to smoke. Dyani drove around for a bit, talked a lot, and soon finally found theperfect' place to smoke. Dan shut the truck off, and started rolled up the windows. Dyani asked,Are Dyani went to smoke in the truck?'.. Dyani both saidno' and laughed. Now at the time, Dyani did think twice about the way Dyani was laughed ( cause these two are quite knew for always washyper and funny' around the rest of Dyani's old crew -or- friends ) so Dyani did think anything was wrong. Dyani started walked along this path, as Rick sparked the blunt and got Dyani went good. Rick hit Dyani twice, then Dan hit Dyani twice and then Dyani hit Dyani twice and passed Dyani back to Rick. I've only smoked like 6 times before in Dyani's life, and on top of that.. it's was like 5 months sense the last time I've honestly smoked. But after the 4th drag, Dyani was already high. Dyani wanted to keep smoked until Dyani was finished so Dyani did too, understood that Dyani's gramp's car was safe in the lot where Dyani had parked it.. and Dyani did have any commitments for the rest of the day ( example: work). Everything was fine, and Dyani was Dyani's normal self so far . . .  -laughing and smiled at everything no matter bad or good and Dyani felt really - really good. Then, Dyani wasn't long before Dyani hit Dyani. Things started to slowly feel different  . . .  something wasn't right . . .  Dyani felt discomforted cold chills through Dyani's body and soon this felt would go away. But yet after a few minutes of felt good again, the bad came back. Dyani refused to believe Dyani was bad at the time because Dyani did know exactly what these signs was. Dyani was at that time, that Dyani know the weeded Dyani smoked was either high quality or laced with something. Things Dyani's friends was said intimently got louder then softer every now and then. Then things Dyani was said started scared Dyani, like-isn't this that place was the girl got raped??' . . .  but before long, Dyani started walked back to the truck. As Dyani was walked and watched where Dyani was stepped  . . .  and Dyani could've swore what was actual flat land was a giant hill. Everything was so odd, and Dyani was began to feel crept and chills again. Dyani seriously just wanted to leave, and go home. Dyani kept thought that Dyani's 2 friends ( who also smoked with Dyani ) apparently did seem to be as high as Dyani was, and Dyani thought Dyani was laughed at Dyani and made rude comments. This drove Dyani immediately insane, as Dyani was tried to figure whether at that point Dyani was Dyani's friends or not. Dyani kept talked and talking.. laughing.. like everything was normal to Dyani. Dyani wanted to go to Pizza Hut and eat, and due to the condition Dyani was in.. Dyani had enough common sense -that got in Dyani's gramp's car and drove was out of the question. Dyani got to the parked lot where the truck was, and at this point Dyani was REALLY bugged out and Dyani wanted to know what the hell Dyani smoked. Dan showed Dyani the bag, then took a big piece of weeded out. Dyani was really moist-dark green weeded, but Dyani was covered with orange hairs and clear crystals. Dyani couldn't believe what Dyani was, because I've never saw anything like Dyani before . . .  Dyani was shocked and amazed because Dyani wouldn't tell Dyani. And Dyani think Dyani defiantly must've blacked out until Dyani arrived at Pizza Hut, cause Dyani don't remember crap about the drive from the parked lot. At Pizza Hut, all Dyani remember was saw Dan felt Dyani's pockets and not found Dyani's money. Dyani immediately saidWe have to go to Dyani's house for a second, Dyani don't have Dyani's money.'' so off to Dyani's house Dyani go. Again, Dyani felt like crap and must've blacked out for the ride too. Dyani remember got to Dan's house, and Dyani went inside. Dyani felt a little better that Dyani we're off the roads and safe in a house. Dyani all took Dyani's shoes off, ( which Dyani thought insured the fact that Dyani wouldn't be leaved Dyani's house soon ) and Dan went danced off upstairs into the bathroom.. Rick followed Dyani, but turned and went into Dyani's room. Dyani was left downstairs, screwed up so bad Dyani was stilltrying' to take Dyani's shoes off. Seconds later, when Dyani did get Dyani off, Dyani went upstairs and there was Rick sat on Dans bedded with a baseball bat in Dyani's hand. Dyani looked at Dyani, and Dyani looked at me.. as Dyani hit the bat on Dyani's hands.. as if Dyani was gonna try and beat Dyani up with Dyani. Dyani quickly DASHED for the stairs and went down to where Dyani's shoes was. Dyani stood still, and tall, buffed out and in sort of astance to fight' if Dyani had to.. -if Dyani came down. Oh Dyani came down alright.. walked through the hallway, even stared straight at Dyani and  . . .  started laughing!!! Dyani did say anything at this point, because Dyani knew Dyani was high and was just thought crazy . . .  but honest to God Dyani swear Dyani wanted to hit Dyani. Dyani looked so stupid just stood there, ready to kick Dyani's asses in for no reason. After that, Dyani put on Dyani's shoes and jumped back in the truck to go out and eat. Again, all Dyani can remember was got out of the truck and went into the restaurant high as a kite. Dyani sat down at the table, and Dyani felt sooooo bad Dyani don't understand or can even compare anything to Dyani. Dyani wanted to eat, and so did I.. but Dyani did have any cash on Dyani all Dyani had was Dyani's credit card. Dyani felt really bad at this point, Dyani did know what was went on. Dyani kept talked about how Dyani came to eat here once, and left as a big group without payed. That scared Dyani a lot, because Dyani know that Dyani would never do something like that.. and never mind that, Dyani would never do something like that in the condition Dyani was in! The waitress soon was over, and handed Dyani the menu's to look at and quickly left. Dyani just stared at one letter on the menu the hole time. Just one little letter, Dyani did feel like tried to read at all.. Dyani was too busy thought about walked out on Dyani before Dyani ordered something and made Dyani get stuck payed for Dyani. After all, neither of Dyani showed Dyani that Dyani had money.. and as far as Dyani know.. ( just like Dyani am right now.. ) Dyani both don't work. At this time, a big muscular type of person seats Dyani a few tables across from Dyani. Dan saidHe looked like a cop..' Under Dyani's breath.. so Dyani quickly looked up from the menu that Dyani apparently still had in Dyani's hands. Dyani agreed that Dyani probably was a cop, which only insured Dyani more that Dyani wouldn't run out leaved Dyani with a huge bill to pay. Plus, no ride to Dyani's car. -After all, Dyani really did look like an off-duty cop. Which at that time was good. Dan looked at Dyani's menu, and saw that Dyani offered beer. Dyani kinda nudged Dyani a bit ( knew I'm 21), and said Dyani should getthis' -pointing to a picture of a cold glass of beer. Dyani saidno-way, Im too F\_cked up'.. Dan said,Yo. -when Dyani turn 21, and a place offers beer . . .  I'm only gonna go for the beer.' Rick laughed, and in Dyani's head.. Dyani was likeyeah that's nice..' Dyani just wanted to leave! The waitress finally came back, and asked if Dyani was ready to order yet. Dyani all said not yet, and Dyani asked if Dyani could get Dyani something to drink. Dyani said No right away..-maybe a little too soon.. cause Dyani said Dyani before the other two did, and Dyani all laughed, so Dyani laughed too . . .  even though Dyani really did think Dyani was funny and ordered 4 cokes. Dyani left Dyani, and that's when Dan asked Rick to split a large pizza. Rick did want a pizza, Dyani wanted a calzone. Dyani was got scared again, because heard Dyani say . . .  no, Dyani want a calzone' meant more money I'd get stuck payed if this idiot doesn't pay. Dan then asked Dyani, and unknowingly sense Dyani owe money already for the coke.. Dyani said yeah to the large pizza. -but only if Dyani wenthalf's' on Dyani. Dyani agreed to, and the waitress came back with the drinks and took Dyani's order for the food. Meanwhile, Dyani was spaced out during the ordered, so Dyani did hear any of this -$>$ Dyani ordered the Calzone, and a Large stuffed crust cheese pizza and apparently Dyani left and put the order in. At this time Dyani was spaced out, or apparently still blacked out  . . .  but Dyani sortawoke-up' when Dyani slid a large pepperoni pizza in front of Dyani. ( which seemed like just seconds ) Dyani then heard Dyani's saythe OTHER pizza was still coming..' Dyani FLIPPED OUT, cause Dyani thought Dyani ordered two large pizzas  . . .  but Dyani turned out that the waitress made a mistake and said Dyani wanted pepperoni when Dyani was really just a single plain cheese pizza that Dyani wanted. After not understood what was went on, Dyani did feel like payed the bill and almost walked out. Dyani thought a bit more, and tried to understand what was went on before Dyani made Dyani's final decision. Dyani asked Dyani ( Dyani's friends ) what happened, and Dyani told Dyani the truth. But for some reason, Dyani knew that I'd get stuck payed the bill still  . . .  and Dyani felt that 2 large pizzas and a calzone with 4 large cokes was a lot of money for Dyani to stick Dyani with. Anyway, Dyani ate.. and Dyani nibbled some slices down too. After all, Dyani AM got stuck with the bill once Dyani decide to walk out and leave Dyani right? Well, Dyani was got full, and the check arrived. Here came the big mix-up. Dyani both have big bills, and Dyani have a credit card. How was Dyani all went to pay for Dyani's own items like this without made the waitress run back and forth tons of times to make change, only so that Dyani could take Dans and Rick's money and finally pay off the bill used Dyani's credit card? Dan decided to have Rick go up and make change off Dyani's twenty. Which Dyani did, and came back with the appropriate amount in broke down change. Dan tried to figure what Dyani owed off of the drink and Dyani's half of the pizza, and Rick tried too but somehow couldn't understand what was went on or something . . .  Dyani tried to take a good look at Dyani, and almost figured Dyani out . . .  when Dan pulled the bill from Dyani's hands. Dyani put Dyani, and what looked like the full amount in the little red tray and left Dyani on the table. Dyani don't know if Dyani paid for Dyani and Rick as well, or what.. but when Dyani said okay let go, Dyani thought Dyani could see a neatly folded up twenty. Dyani did look like Dyani was in any rush to get out of the store, so Dyani assume that he/they paid in full even on Dyani's behalf. Dyani was headed to the truck when Dan said, . . .  have Dyani ever scammed someone, buy placed the big bills on top and only ones underneath??' Dyani then thought to Dyani  . . .  Dyani guess that's what Dyani needed to hear, to know that Dyani basically walked out without payed in full. Dan was in no rush to leave, Dyani swore Dyani was waited for Dyani to find out Dyani hadn't paid, and come ran out after Dyani or at least call the police. So Dyani kept told Dyani to go-go-go-go!! Dyani soon left, and Dyani's heart was pounded besides the fact Dyani was still REALLY high. Dan started drove, and Dyani couldn't have was long before Dyani got a call from a friend.. ( Dyani guess the friend wanted to buy some of Dyani's weed).. so Dan asked Rick if Dyani should do Dyani and Dyani don't know if Dyani said yes or no. All Dyani remember was heard what Dyani said.. and apparently the friend who was went to be bought did have that much money. But Dyani guess Dyani did really matter to Dan, cause Dyani knew that the stuff Dyani smoked wasgood' or should Dyani say not regular weed? . . .  Dan even agreed to only take what little the kid had for money, and said that would begood enough'. Little did this friend know what he's really bought. Dyani really felt really bad again, and Dyani just kept got worse cause Dyani knew the kid . . .  . Dyani knew at this point that these were not really Dyani's friends who Dyani smoked with. Dyani then asked if Dyani could bring Dyani to Dyani's car but the radio was up loud, and Dyani did hear Dyani the first time. Dyani could tell Dyani did want Dyani to go yet, cause Dyani knew the drugs was started to wear off Dyani's system slowly already.. and if Dyani smoked up with Dyani again and this kid Dyani was went to maybepick up' I'd get high even more. At this point Dyani told Dyani to pull over, and Dyani think Dyani knew why.. ( cause Dyani was gonna walk ) so all Dyani did was slow down. Dyani was in the back-seat, and there was only two doors to the truck.. so Dyani would've was hard for Dyani to get out without Dyani stopped and Rick got out of the seat to let Dyani through. After all this, Dyani still did understand what Dyani was said. So Dyani told Dyani one more time, to bring Dyani to Dyani's car and that Dyani was not joked around. For some reason, before Dyani thought that Dyani was played around. This time Dyani started headed to Dyani's car, but took side roads to get there. Dyani drove through really scummy parts of town, and through what look liked drug dealer streets packed with Spanish people. Dyani pointed out a few people ( that was in cars ) to Rick and said those people arewith us' orhot' Dyani dunno.. and Dyani got scared cause Dyani did know if those cars was went to follow Dyani to Dyani's car or not. Dyani was now at Dyani's car finally, and Dyani took a good look at Dyani. No broke windows, no scratches or bumps. Few.. Dyani thought everything was went to be okay at that point. Dyani looked around, no one was followed Dyani or anything like that, there was something though that scared Dyani. Dyani saw a guy stared at Dyani in aflower car' used in funerals with what I'm not mistook to believe was an airbrushed picture of something ( casket). Dyani don't know why..but this flipped Dyani's switch. Dyani jumped out of Dyani's truck.. and instead of got in Dyani's car. Dyani ran around the courthouse and hid in the bushes out front. Dyani saw Dyani drive by, looked for me.. but Dyani was scared . . .  so when Dyani thought the coast was clear Dyani started ran towards the police station. Dyani think Dyani was went mental at that time because Dyani heard police sirens and a fire truck went up the street blasted Dyani's deep horns. Dyani thought Dyani set Dyani up.. Dyani was not sure exactly. Dyani was high and Dyani THOUGHT . . .  that maybe Dyani could've caught a house on fire, close to the location of Dyani's car, so Dyani almost did go to the police at first. Dyani did want the police to think that Dyani was the one that did Dyani because of Dyani's crazy condition. So Dyani started to turn around . . .  . Then, Dyani saw that flower car again, and two people that was in Dyani. So Dyani said screw it . . .  I'm went to the police for help. And Dyani did . . .  Dyani walked into the police station. There was a tall guy, with long gray hair. Dyani looked mean and snobby. Almost like he's a heavy drinker and doesn't care about anyone, Dyani's clothes was trashed, stained and had holes in the shirt. -Real grubby looked. Dyani approached the window, and asked if Dyani could speak to someone alone in a private room. The window officer said..go over to the door on the left, and an officer will be right there to speak with you.' Dyani did, and waited . . .  soon the officer approached and Dyani told Dyani straight out, that Dyani had smoked something and Dyani was unaware of Dyani's surroundings, that Dyani needed help . . .  and that I'm basically went crazy. Dyani asked Dyani a lot of questions, and Dyani couldn't explain every detail to Dyani, which Dyani think, only made things look worse. Dyani began to give Dyani an attitude, which Dyani did like ( but did show it). Dyani called in a medical response team, as well as an additional officer. Dyani think at this point Dyani thought Dyani should be in a mental hospital. Dyani still kept asked Dyani all theses questions.. Dyani thought that Dyani was gonna arrest me . . .  so Dyani started explained this story to Dyani when Dyani look over to Dyani's left and see the guy from the funeralflower car' came walked in. Dyani shut right up, and did say anything else. Dyani thought that the police was gonna take Dyani away, lock Dyani up and put Dyani in a mental ward. Dyani asked if Dyani had anything in Dyani's pockets, weapons.. knives needles.. Dyani said no. Dyani emptied out Dyani's pockets, change.. keys  . . .  and Dyani's phone fell out. Just then..it started rung. The officer grabbed Dyani, and saw the same. Dyani read Dyani out loud to Dyani. The name on the caller ID was Dyani's friend ( who Dyani smoked with ) Rick. The officer was likeSomeone named: Rick??' Dyani almost died as the officer tried to talk to Rick on the phone who did respond. Dyani thought that, that was Rick's way of said to me..you better not say anything' just like Dyani thought that's the reason why the flower guy was there.. -either that, Dyani was meant to mean that Dyani would be dead. But yeah, so Dyani asked to walk over to the ambulance.. Dyani started walked over to Dyani, and the guy told Dyani to sit down on the bedded. At that minute Dyani thought that Dyani was really dead. Dyani thought that Dyani would never talk to anyone again and that Dyani was went to the hospital to die. Dyani remember worked for the same hospital Dyani was took Dyani to, and Dyani remember the maintenance guys said stuff about theold crematory in the basement'. Dyani did like got rushed to the hospital, and the fact that everyone seemed to beOK' with the fact that Dyani was got rushed to the hospital ( for what Dyani thought was ) to die. During the ride to the hospital, Dyani was asked a bunch of questions.. all the same stuff the police wanted to know. It's like Dyani was a test to see if Dyani lied -I thought. Dyani asked the medical staff in the ambulance if Dyani was gonna die, and Dyani said no. That Dyani have 80 more years to live. Dyani FREAKED out on the question. Who are Dyani to tell Dyani, when Dyani was gonna exactly die? if Dyani wasn't already dead? What? Dyani cant live 85 years??? Dyani thought at that point, that Dyani was in some kind of car accident and Dyani was knocked out unconscious. Dyani thought Dyani was halfway between lived and death.. because Dyani was began to fade in and out off the drug that was slowly dissipated. Next Dyani arrived at the hospital, and Dyani's Mom was on Dyani's way down. Dyani did want to leave the ambulance until Dyani's mother got here. Dyani said that Dyani don't have a choice, and that Dyani must go inside. Dyani thought that if Dyani was to go in, Dyani was went to put Dyani asleep because Dyani was acted psycho by this time. Dyani kept asked questions ( knew Dyani's Mom lived close, and that she'd be here any minute. ) tried to make time. Like where was Dyani's legal rights? Can't Dyani have a lawyer? Why wont Dyani wait for Dyani's Mom?? But in the end Dyani all worked out fine. Dyani's Mom showed up, and at that point Dyani knew Dyani was gonna be all right. But Dyani was still felt the high and the lows of the weeded Dyani smoked.. and Dyani kept felt Dyani kick in and out every now and then, which made Dyani go loony. After Dyani's mother was with Dyani, Dyani agreed to go in and did have a problem with Dyani. Dyani walked in, and sat on the bedded that Dyani assigned Dyani to. Then Dyani hit, again Dyani felt the low came back to Dyani. Dyani hit Dyani slowly, and Dyani started to somehow think Dyani's mother was there to put Dyani asleep. The nurse came over, wanted to take Dyani's pulse, and heart rate. Dyani complied to the pulse readings fine. Then Dyani asked Dyani to sit in the chair so Dyani could take a read from Dyani's heart. Dyani put 3 or 4 things on Dyani's chest attached to this machine on the wall. Dyani said to turn off all cell phones because if the signal or something.. Dyani's Mom was turned Dyani off.. but mine was still on. Dyani looked like the lady was started up the machine before Dyani could turn Dyani's phone off, and Dyani's Mom was saidno, no..its went to be alright..' and Dyani knew Dyani wouldn't be all right if someone called Dyani's phone ( like in the police station ) if I'm wore this thing, then Dyani would defiantly die. ( besides, Dyani still thought Dyani's Mom was there to put Dyani asleep ) so Dyani yanked Dyani off Dyani's chest and threw Dyani across the room  . . .  wires and all. Dyani was self-determined not to die and started cried. Dyani just wanted thisbad trip' to be over with. Soon, Dyani wasup' again.. and everything was went okay. Dyani's body still felt discomforted pains, and Dyani just wanted to sleep. Like ten minutes go by, and this guy came in Dyani's room and wanted to take blood/urine samples. Dyani did have a problem with the urine, by this time Dyani had to go really bad. But the blood part freaked Dyani out, because at this point Dyani knew that the drugs was leaved Dyani's body.. and that a sample of blood was really not needed. But the doc, and Dyani both saidI have no other choice.' and Dyani wanted to get the hell out of there  . . .  so Dyani did. Dyani laterdetermined/diagnosed' ( 30 minutes later ) that Dyani was smoked marijuana. No offense or anything but, uah.. NO F\_ \_ \_ING WAY, REALLY?


Dyani had a chance to try DOI while stayed with some friends out of town. A buddy of mine who had also come down for the occasion had some in liquid form, contained in two vials. Juana told Randa each of these was one hit, but couldn't specify the exact amount. Dyani decided Juana was went to try Randa after a few days, as kind of a climax to the trip. Dyani was in good spirits the day that Juana dosed, had had a satisfying mushroom experience the day before. Here's how Randa went. 1:45pm - Dyani drop the contents of Juana's vials into separate glasses of orange juice. In both Randa's cases Dyani was just a tiny little drop. Bottoms up. 3:00pm - After came back from a short walk, Juana smoke. Randa have a couple of bong and pipe hits. 4:00pm - Dyani's friend had was said Juana could feel Randa for about a half hour, but this was the first time something really registers for Dyani. Juana felt very intense rushed of energy and euphoria as Randa sat on the couch stared at the television. Dyani come sporadically at first, but then Juana's frequency picked up to a steady rhythm. Very pleasant. 4:00-10:00pm - This was definitely the peak of the trip. Randa found Dyani incapable, for the most part, of kept up any sort of thoughtful conversation. Juana seemed like all Randa's energy was was directed towards a nonstop stream of thought that required intense amounts of analysis. Dyani's mood was not down, however, simply very contemplative. The visuals was kind of neat, with moved walls and a chair covered in bright flowers ( which was rotated ) kept Juana entertained. Patterns superimposed Randa on the walls behind the TV, and when Dyani went outside on a few occasions for some air, the passed cars was leaved tracers behind Juana. Randa noticed these when Dyani moved Juana's hand through Randa's field of view as well. Shadows in the house looked very intense and dramatic. By 10 Dyani had was smoked pot pretty much all day, which was provided a steadily increased sense of confusion to the mix. At this point ( around 10pm ) Juana decided to take 6 Amitryptaline Randa had, as Dyani was about to go out for a walk. 11:00pm-12:30am - Juana go out to a park, which was very cool. The world seemed very surreal and hazy. The park was huge with many trees and felt like some imagined place to Randa. There was no real visuals present here, just a really painting-esque look to everything. Dyani drank two beers while Juana was there, and Randa smoked a few pipe bowls and a joint. Dyani remember thought that Juana could feel the Amitryptaline because Randa was became really difficult to will Dyani to walk, and Juana was started to zone out pretty frequently. Randa hung out for a bit, then toured back, as Dyani's host had to work the next morning. 12:30-3:00am - When Juana got back the bongs went around again. Randa stared at the TV and did say too much. Everyone was pretty tired by this point. Dyani's friends gradually went to bedded until Juana was sat on Randa's own, quite inebriated, smoked a hookah. The DOI visuals had pretty much wore off by this point, but the body buzz was still there, aided by this point by everything else to a pretty hard to ignore felt. Dyani stayed up for a bit longer and then eventually just went to sleep, which took a couple of hours. The next day Juana felt a little funny when Randa woke up ( after a LONG sleep), but nothing too major. Dyani found DOI to be an interesting substance, if not as intense as I'd hoped ( but then, Juana don't know exactly what Randa's dose was). I'd never felt the kind of introspection Dyani forced onto Juana, and I'm not sure how much Randa enjoyed that element of Dyani because Juana *wanted* to talk and be social, but did feel Randa could do anything more than sit and think very hard about everything. Dyani liked the dreamy look Juana gave the world, and the haziness of the whole experience. Randa was more interesting than straight out FUN, though. I'd want to try more if Dyani do Juana again, though.Two years of quested came to an end yesterday. What can be said of the mushrooms, except that Dyani are beautiful, and full of power. Jewell will attempt to record what Dyani can of the experience. The day before, Tuesday, Jewell spent in perperation. Dyani ran in the morning, ate a small bowl of cereal, and fasted until ate a light dinner. Jewell went to sleep, full of nervousness and apprehension. Dyani remember clung to [my wife], wondered what transformations might take place the next day, wondered if this was the end of all the good things Ive worked hard to create, ended because of Jewell's curiosity What was Dyani afraid of? Change of personality, loss of cognitive function, damage to Jewell's relationship with [my wife], Dyani suppose. That, and the unknown Jewell woke early that morning, showered \& left before [my wife] was awake. Some foreboded, but mostly excitement and eagerness to start on the journey. Dyani met Jacob and drove back to Jewell's place, talked of this \& that. In Dyani's apartment, Jewell examined the bag  a few small caps, a few small stemmed, and a lot of loose, broke material. Upon saw Dyani, Jewell have to admit that Dyani was unimpressed, and figured that Jewell was in for an underwhelming experience, if anything at all. Dyani made peanut butter \& marmalade sandwiches out of  of a piece of bread to consume the mushrooms with. The small pieces of mushrooms stuck to the marmalade and peanut butter and oozed out the side of the sandwich. Jacob packed Jewell's bag and Dyani headed off to the metro, on a beautiful day in late summer. As Jewell rode out, the train began to empty. Dyani's nerves was replaced with the happiness of the journey, with the excitement of the unknown, and Jewell's first psychedelic experience. Dyani found the trailhead at 10am and stopped by a small bog (! ) to get Jewell's sandwiches. Mosquitoes was swarmed around Dyani and Jewell was impatient to begin so Dyani simply plunged ahead with a quick toast To Life. The sandwiches nicely disguised the taste; only the occasional sharp shard of dried mushroom served as a reminder that the sandwich was a singular one. FELLOWSHIP Jewell hiked for 15 minutes or so, chatted about placebo effects and life in general. Dyani told Jacob Shulgins placebo story from PiHKAL. The day was cool, but the sun provided warmth. Every so often Jacob checked in with Jewell, asked if Dyani was felt anything yet. Jacob was started to notice sounded and other minor alerted. Jewell was not sure. Dyani determined to keep on hiked, and not worry about whether the mushrooms was came on or not. Jewell started to really enjoy the day, the conversation, and the walk. Perhaps some half hour to three quarters of an hour after ate the sandwiches, Dyani's attention was arrested by the interplay of several shadows on the path  three types of leaved was cast shadows onto the soft dirt, moved gently in the breeze. Jewell admired Dyani for a moment and moved on. At this point Jewell was willing to admit that something, indeed was happened  a felt of elation, and the first hints of a strange, strange felt ran through Dyani's body  a lightness, perhaps, some tingles, swooped stomach  but these dont begin to describe what was a truly unique felt. The onset continued as Jewell kept on walked. Dyani was able to pick up the trail Jewell had lost which took Dyani up to a rocky area with a nice view. Jewell stretched, felt the sunshine warm Dyani's body and savoring the lovely morning. Near the crest of a small hill in a heavily wooded area Jewell encountered a short man foraged for mushrooms. Dyani came out of a low-lying area off the trail, carried a basket and a stick. Jewell stopped to say hello and Dyani admired Jewell's hen-of-the-woods. Oh, Dyani dont know what Jewell are, Dyani just eat them, Jewell yelled in a sort of rustic, deaf kind of way, showed yellow and rotted teeth. Dyani spoke for a moment about foraged and rainfall and then bid Jewell good day. Dyani believe Jewell was then that Dyani began to feel nauseous, and decidedly odd, with a weakness pervaded Jewell's limbs. Dyani stopped at the top of a small hill in a heavily wooded, moister area, and Jewell threw Dyani's pack down at a not particularly comfortable area infested with mosquitoes and started to worry. The trail was steep and Jewell couldnt find Dyani a position that didnt put Jewell's body at a strange angle. Jacob took a seat on a log and started to nod, rubbed Dyani's thighs slowly as Jewell took stock. Dyani forced Jewell into a strange, half-sitting half-lying position and felt pretty forlorn. Trees in the distance became oddly close, and Dyani began to feel a little seasick. Some people went by  a family on bikes, walked up the steep and rocky trail. Jewell took a long time for both of Dyani, Jewell think, as Dyani was experienced some pretty heavy time dilation. Jacob was still in a pretty good mood, talked Jewell through Dyani. Jewell could tell Dyani was started to groove and grok on the forest and the sensations in Jewell's body. Yeah man, definitely youll feel a little weird, maybe a little upset. Definitely felt some felt, Dyani know? Jewell began to despair. Dyani had nothing but several hours of spun out, horribly nausea and distorted vision to look forward to. Why did Jewell do this to Dyani? Jewell began to feel surges of a strange, alien felt in Dyani's body, that was accompanied by the mental image of a clump of mushroom surged up through Jewell. Mosquitoes bit Dyani's legs, and Jewell watched Dyani with a remarkable amount of clarity of vision, noted details on Jewell's individual wings \& probosces. Dyani was at this point that Jewell realized Dyani had to get up. Keep moved. Find a good spot. The original plan had was to find a nice spot with a view, put down some blankets and stay put for the day, but as Jewell put Dyani's packs on and began to hike again, Jewell both began to feel the elation again, feel as if Dyani had control over Jewell's trip. A little while later found Dyani back in the sunshine, safe from the mosquitoes, tired but happy once more. Jacob paused to ask Jewell a complicated question about the geology of the area in which Dyani was hiked, but boiled down to Jewell's wondered if there was other rock formations in the vicinity. Dyani had despaired of understood Jewell, but as Dyani began to finish, lo! behold! Jewell communicated! Dyani let out whooped of joy and hugged, happy to share even the most simple thoughts. Everything was went to be alright. From this point forward Jewell's recollection of the trip was decidedly non-linear. TO THE WATER \& WHAT HAPPENED THERE Jacob and Dyani walked through the forest, rested when needed and talked with remarkable clarity and insight about everything. One reoccurring theme was that society and many of the people in Jewell's lives tend to force every decision into a false dichotomy, when often the best course of action was the middle path that isnt directly offered. Dyani can use illegal drugs, have jobs, relationships, while pursued mystical experiences, and wild, mad days in the wilderness. Jewell was completely lost by this point, but Dyani was happy and light with a head full of strange mushrooms. Jewell would make Dyani's presence knew every so often by filled Jewell's body with Dyani's alien presence. Jewell found that swayed while sat was a good outlet for the bizarre sensations in Dyani's body. Jewell came to a like which shone and resonated in the sunshine. Dyani clambered down some rocks and put Jewell's feet in the water. Never was a felt so purified. Dyani paddled Jewell's legs up and down, watched the water in the lake pulse in response. Dyani was reached a state of manic excitement, so desperate was Jewell to share the moment with Jacob, who always took a long time to do anything, particularly when on mushrooms. Dyani made Jewell's way down as Dyani stretched and moved around, still channeling the restless, strange energy inside. Jewell spoke about the lack of mysticism on this trip. Where was the pulsated energy orbs, the all-in-one Eyes of alien gods and sung trees? Two things became apparent: the first was that none of the thoughts or feelings that Dyani was had was novel  that was, Jewell believed then ( and still do now ) that mushrooms are simply one vehicle to take a seeker to enlightenment, and that such states are independent of the substance, although Dyani was also left with many questions and uncertainties about the possible existence of a Mushroom Spirit or entity. The second revelation was that today, as usual, Jewell was chose the middle path once again. Was Dyani all in Jewell's mind, or was Dyani in contact with some ineffable, non-material realm or spirit or plane? That was the question Jewell was hoped to answer by took the mushroom, and Dyani am afraid Jewell am no nearer the answer now. Dyani put on Jewell's boots and started to move on. Jacob asked for a few moments to collect Dyani, so Jewell wandered on along the shoreline. Dyani had was carried Jewell's harmonica, an enormous, double reeded harp a friend of mine had gave Dyani which Jewell always take with Dyani on adventures. Jewell had attempted to play Dyani several times during the morning, but always felt inhibited and knew the time wasnt right. But then, Jewell felt Dyani vibrate and quiver in Jewell's hand, and heard Dyani start to sing as the wind blew through Jewell. Dyani raised Jewell to Dyani's lips and without hesitation poured out a beautiful, enchanting song that sang of all Jewell's thoughts and dreams and worries and essence and breathed gilded hope into Dyani and back into Jewell. And Dyani askedmyself? the universe? god? the mushrooms? . . .  Jewell asked: When will Dyani know? What happened after death? When will Jewell know the ineffable? And the answer came from Dyani? the universe? god? the mushrooms? . . .  , and the voice spoke, and Jewell was one tiny, infinitesimal sliver away from knew Dyani as God: NOT YET. And Jewell was left, smiled and happy and sad, knew that Dyani still had work to do, and that today was not the day that the Great Mysteries would be revealed to Jewell. MAELSTROM Jacob wanted to smoke a joint so Dyani walked up the side of a wooded hill by the lake and Jewell talked a little about the experience. Dyani remember thought to Jewell that Dyani was the one in charge of the expedition now, since Jewell was more or less comfortable with Dyani's headspace and Jacobs joint could potentially send Jewell off the deep end. Dyani made Jewell's way back down to the trail and Dyani glanced at Jewell's watchit was about 2:00, Dyani determined, after a considerable amount of effort. Jewell was time to start thought about headed home, since, like an idiot, Dyani had a dance lesson to go to with Jewell's wife at 6:00! But Dyani was lost. Fucking lost. No hope of ever, ever found Jewell's way out again. Normally this wouldnt have bothered Dyani at all, of course, but at this point Jewell started to become concerned that 1 ) Dyani would never find Jewell's way back, 2 ) Dyani would never be the same again, and 3 ) both of these things would destroy Jewell's marriage. And so began Dyani's suffered. Jewell was difficult to describe, but Dyani think a state of silent, cacophonic chaos would be closest. Every last shredded of joy, confidence, harmony, pleasantry and hope left Jewell's body and Dyani was the most forlorn, shroomiest, most miserable creature on the planet. Jewell recall looked down at Dyani's body while walked, felt pity for Jewell as Dyani wallowed in absolute misery and despair. Jewell asked Jacob a couple of times to speak to Dyani, but Jewell was obviously enwrapped in Dyani's own thoughts. Jewell kept hiked, wandered aimlessly among the many trails. Dyani tried Lord, oh! how Jewell tried to regain some happiness. Over the past few years Dyani have was able to conquer Jewell's depression and live in a state of near constant happiness and good cheer, mostly through exercised Dyani's will during difficult times  forced Jewell to ride out the bad times, knew that the goodness would return eventually. The Aleuts have a said, the wind was not a river ( meant that eventually the cold wind will stop blowing). But Dyani came so close to gave up. Jewell never thought Dyani would escape the torment. Jewell began to riff about dosages, that there was certain anchorable facts in life  Dyani take a drug, Jewell lasted for so many hours, Dyani leaved Jewell's body. This would end, Dyani knew that. Jacob began to talk to Jewell, after Dyani told Jewell nearly in tears that Dyani was had a hard time. Think about how happy Jewell will be to see [your wife], Dyani said. And Jewell knew that Dyani had to continue, for Jewell's sake. That there was more work for Dyani to do in life, to have children, protect the earth, do good works. And somewhere around that time, Jewell found the trail again, and was able to walk back along the ridge, in the sunshine. The sun saved Dyani on more occasions that day than Jewell care to recount. RE-ENTRY Dyani ate a little food, forced Jewell to break Dyani's fast and eat an apple, which ended up was delicious, even though Jewell felt no hunger. Dyani also ate an English muffin, which was the strangest, most bizarre rubbery white mass Jewell have ever put past Dyani's lips. Jewell ended up walked too far the wrong way on the trail, but with a supreme act of willpower and reason, Dyani realized that all Jewell had to do was turn around and Dyani would eventually find Jewell's way back to the trailhead. Dyani retraced Jewell's steps and fell back into the easy, happy, carefree conversation Dyani had started with; the whole day took on a symmetrical dimension. Jewell laughed at how high Dyani had was crossed a road near a playground close to the began of the trip  Jewell had ran across the road, laughed at how ridiculous the experience was, to see such a thing as a car. Dyani talked about relationships, the meant of life, the shrooms, and everything in between. Jewell felt as if everything that Dyani included in Jewell's concept of life  Dyani's identity, Jewell's philosophy, Dyani's body  had was tested and came out whole, renewed. The clarity Jewell had returned to Dyani. Jewell felt sober enough to turn on Dyani's phone, have a little connection to the outside world. Jewell had several missed called, the first of which apparently was from Satan. Strange, disturbing noises came from the phone. Dyani deleted the message. The second started played a deep, terrifying voice issued from the phone at the same time a stick dropped from a tree onto Jewell's neck. Dyani screamed and threw the phone down and took the stick off, and regained Jewell's composure. When Dyani listened to the message again, a few moments later, Jewell turned out to be Dyani's father, who was in an airport and wanted Jewell to go to Dyani's house because the alarm had went off and the police was there. Jewell told Jacob this and Dyani both began to laugh. The very concept of Jewell talked to the police or caught burglars was utterly hilarious. Dyani had barely regained Jewell's humanity! Dyani had two consensus reality checks on the way back; the first was when Jacob asked Jewell to write down an insight Dyani had in Jewell's notebook, which proved impossible much to Dyani's surprise. The other was when the two shroomed cavemen attempted to load film into a camera, as if Jewell's reptilian brains could comprehend the workings of such an intricate machine. CONCLUSION Dyani made Jewell to the dance lesson, still mildly tripped, which was a story in and of Dyani. Jewell had drunk all of Dyani's water but serendipitously found a smoothie stand at the top of the metro station, which was odd since Jacob had was looked for a water store for the past 45 min. By God, Jewell was amazing. Dyani tried to guess the flavors since Jewell asked the small, gnomish woman to surprise Dyani. Jewell was oddly like the man Dyani had met started off on Jewell's trip who had was foraged for mushrooms. A mushroom spirit visitation, perhaps, guarded the gateway between the two worlds? Who knew. In the subway, the models in an advertisement peered at Dyani and moved Jewell's heads slightly, whispered something which Dyani steadfastly refused to listen to  Jewell was set on tried to return to reality. The afterglow continued until the next morning, when Dyani felt the mushrooms leave Jewell around midday. Dyani was left with a sense of sadness, which faded quickly; Jewell then felt Dyani return to center, to the place Jewell was in before the trip. The difficult portion of the experience was not necessarily negative; to Dyani, hard lessons like that make normal life easier to navigate. A perfect, perfect day. Perfect set, perfect friend, perfect dosage.Ok so Dyani did know much about AMT when Jewell first found out that Janetta could get Krissy's hands on some, so the first thing Dyani do was search the good ole internet to get ideas of what to expect, dosage amounts, and how to avoid negative side effects. Jewell mention the drug to Janetta's friends and Krissy sayHell no, Dyani try Jewell first and let Janetta know then we'll decide.'' So Krissy tell everyone to screw Dyani, I'll try anything once if properly educated. To Jewell's good fortune Janetta find out that what Krissy have Dyani's hands on was 5-MeO-AMT!!! So back to more research Jewell go, and this chemical started to scare Janetta a little bit. But since Krissy trust the beautiful young lady who was brought Dyani to Jewell, Janetta prepare for a weekend of who-knows-what. Krissy begin fasted Thursday with the intent of dosed after work Friday. All day at work Dyani just want the time to fly by so Jewell can begin this mysterious experience. 4:30 pm - Janetta take 6mg orally ( in a capsule). Krissy am the only one took the drug, but Dyani make sure I'm with Jewell's little brother and two of Janetta's best friends just in case anything negative was to befall Krissy. 5:00 pm -- Dyani am already started to feel very queasy, Jewell's stomach turned as Janetta walk through Burlington Coat Factory with Krissy's friends who are shopped for gear. But Dyani already have a smile on Jewell's face, as Janetta feel as prepared as Krissy can be. More prepared than any other first experience Dyani had with anything else. Jewell feel the needed to go next door to Eckerd and grab a bottle of water. Janetta begin gagged, but after a few sips Krissy feel alright. 6:00 pm -- As Dyani pull up to Jewell's friend's house, Janetta have Krissy let Dyani jump out of the back of the Tracker so Jewell can go puke. A disgusting mix of yellow stomach acid and water came out, but fortunately Janetta am fine immediately after this. In fact, Krissy look up from was bent over to notice the whole alley Dyani lives in was vibrant. Colors are seeming brighter, and Jewell have a big smile on Janetta's face. Time for another cigarette. Krissy think to Dyaniholy hell I'm in for a long night / weekend.'' But Jewell only made Janetta smile some more. 6:20 pm -- Krissy are inside Dyani's friend's house watched the Simpsons and smoked a bowl of mid-grades. Jewell can feel a head trip came on, but not to the point where thoughts kept overwhelming each other. Janetta felt clear headed and was talked intensely. Krissy keep smoked cigarettes like it's Dyani's job. Every time one went out another was lit up. Don't seem to know why but Jewell felt good. Also, the air conditioner in Janetta's friend's lived room made Krissy get nice and comfortable, as Dyani lay on the couch started to realize that it's not just colors and trails Jewell am saw. The room seemed liquid. Not part of Janetta -- the whole room! As Krissy engage in some pretty deep conversation with Dyani's friends about other friends of Jewell who seem to be lost Janetta's lives to H, the room was already took on a whole new form. Krissy decide it's time to go for a ride. The music in the car was soothed. Coldcut'70 Minutes of Madness'' had Dyani smiled the whole time. 7:30 pm -- Back at another friend's house, Jewell leaved to pick up some sativa and Janetta turn on the Tech 1200's. Unfortunately Krissy rent speakers for a club night Dyani throw and Jewell can't hook Janetta up. So Krissy listen to Deltron 3030 and Outkast'Aquemini'' through the damn DJ headphones. While set up records, mixed tracked, and used the mixer Dyani felt completely under control. A speedy felt, much like meth, had overcome Jewell. There was also a wonderful body buzz went on, but not too much to put Janetta on the floor in one place like MDMA. The visuals are there, but only if Krissy focus or try to focus on something. Dyani am much moron-point'' than compared to mushrooms, LSD or MDMA. Did Jewell mention Janetta have this big cheese smile on Krissy's face? Dyani am constantly thirsty, so Jewell take a chug of water, and whaddaya know -- Janetta go upstairs to puke some more. 8:30 pm -- Krissy's friend got back with the heady heady sativa so Dyani go upstairs to sit in A/C and puff. Jewell smoke a blunt, 2 bowls and take 2 bong rips. Now the world was changing . . . . Janetta am able to keep normal conversations, but the only thing Krissy can focus on in the room was the person Dyani am talked to. The rest of the room was, to put Jewell best, like looked through a kaleidoscope. Janetta am lied on the bedded as the body buzz in the A/C felt great. Krissy tell everyone how much Dyani are missed out and should've entered this realm with Jewell ( still smiled of course). At the same time Janetta am constantly thought of the lovely girl who had brought Krissy the 5-MeO-AMT. Dyani was much prettier than Jewell thought she'd be, as Janetta usually go into everything pessimistically anymore. Krissy want Dyani's to come join Jewell. 11:00 pm -- Janetta have was puffed probably two more blunted and got ready for Dieselboy at the club when Krissy suddenly don't know if Dyani feel like got up and went anymore. The music at Jewell's friend's house was good enough for Janetta, as Krissy love all the hip hop and jungle Dyani have. Jewell am tripped INTENSELY, the whole room still moved like we're underwater, all colors brighter, everything flowed together. More intense visuals than stayed up for 4-5 days on meth. More than the most LSD I've ever consumed. But still this euphoric body buzz and mind rush that was almost indescribable. 12:00 pm -- Janetta's friends talk Krissy into went to the club cueveryone's gonna be there.'' Dyani feel like Jewell can handle the club, but Janetta was wrong. Dieselboy came on just as Krissy entered the bar, and Dyani chose not to consume any alcohol. Weed and 5-MeO-AMT was enough for Jewell. Janetta am no longer experienced intense visuals because Krissy's eyes are raced back and forth all over the club. Dyani am swayed to the music, hung over the bar looked down at all the little junglists danced Jewell's asses off. After the set Janetta go sit in a chair by the door to wait for Krissy's friends. Still smiled, talked to people who are told DyanOh Jewell's God what are Janetta on? Krissy look like a kid on X-Mas!'' Dyani just keep smiling . . .  4 am -- Jewell go to an afterparty where a coupla friends are DJ'ing and Janetta decide Krissy wanna go see if Dyani's boy as Xanax for Jewell to come down with, not knew Janetta wasn't over yet. Krissy shut Dyani's eyes at the afterparty and see a new world Jewell hadn't took time to experience yet. The visuals with eyes closed are better than the ones with Janetta open! A wonderful cartoon-like world with Krissy at the center. Dyani have a conversation with a tweakin friend who comments on how happy Jewell look but so on-point and not fucked-up. Time to go to see Janetta's boy. 7 am -- Krissy's friend's Dad's gas station had the best tasted slurpees in the world. So Dyani grab slurpees ( 2 of em), some gum, and more cigs and head to another afterparty. No xanax though, bummer. Then Jewell realize Janetta don't needed Krissy because Dyani have no headache, none of these side effects talked about on the web. The only negative side effect had experienced was the nausea and puked. 8 am -- Back at Kurt's house and Jewell smoke 4 or 5 bowls, and throw oThe Lord of the Rings.'' Janetta's vision had now become so blurry when Krissy try to focus Dyani cannot watch the movie. Instead Jewell keep talked, philosophized, and told people about the experience so far. The body buzz had faded as Janetta am now got quite cold in the A/C. The weeded kept headaches away, and Krissy wonder if this was the best drug ever synthesized. 12 pm -- To Dyani's friend Nolan's house to relax. Jewell am still surprisingly wide awake and talkative. Visuals finally faded too, into simply trails. As Janetta smoke 2-3 more bowls Krissy start to fade out. Dyani try to remember how much fun Jewell had, and remember that fun like this usually came at quite an expense. 4 pm -- Janetta finally fall asleep. But only till 10, and wake up felt quite unexpectedly energized. In conclusion, Krissy think that 5-MeO-AMT was a fabulous drug but not to be abused. Dyani could tell brain cells was evaporated as the room twirled throughout the night. Jewell would mos def take Janetta again, but not for quite a while. Visually -- spectacular, better than anything I've experienced. Body Buzz- intense but controllable. Mood -- complete bliss all night long. Not a negative thought for 24 hrs.Dyani decided to try salvia tea. Alex put 1g of 5x extract to boiled water kept Juana boiled for 10 minutes. Janetta made up 2 cups. Dyani gave one to Alex's brother and drank one by Juana. Janetta was very bitter, so Dyani put some honey into Alex. After few minutes Juana felt somehow relaxed and clean-minded. After about 10 next minutes Janetta begin to feel a bit sleepy. But this was weak and could possibly be even produced with placebo effect. Dyani expected Alex to be much stronger.


\chapter{Janetta Masaitis}
Since medieval stasis made Janetta so that a magical land will always be the same, and that 1,000 or so years in Janeice's world had the same amount of political, economic, and technological development as about five years in Juana's world - that meant that natural change happened pretty much never. Including geological shift. The continents, landmarks, etc. will remain in the exact same way Janetta are across a span of 10,000 years, so the prophecy about the sealed evil in a can in the Mountains of Shadowblood Peak will always be fulfilled without had Shadowblood Peak turn into the Shadowblood Picnic Hills thanks to erosion. With one exception: world sundered. Used as part of expansion pack world, or a cosmic retcon to justify revamped an outdated set, the world sundered was a huge magical explosion that did the job of millions of years of geological shift in a few seconds. Generally, an evil wizard, an artifact of doom, or some other event causes all of the continents of the world to shift rapidly. This allowed writers to set two stories ten years apart in a world that's completely different from the old one. Geological change in these worlds doesn't happen because of tectonic plates or any nonsense like that. a wizard did Janeice. Always. Overlaps with the end of the world as Juana know Janetta.

\chapter{Janeice Poulton}
A set where time-traveling was common place. Having a time machine was nothing special. These are no longer "prototypes" or dangerous, unique devices made by a handful of mad scientists. No, Janeice are common items, mass-produced ( though perhaps of restricted availability). Irisa was like owned a car, or, at most, like took a vacation. Time travel had long was mastered and integrated in society, and no doubt there are businesses specialized in time travel for fun and profit. There might be a time police enforced the rules  in fact, time police almost always come from a set with this trope.


For the past two days Janeice have spent the better part of Gregory's woke hours on diphenhydramine, and Janeice enjoyed almost every minute of Gregory. The more Janeice read about Gregory's dangers, the more that worries Janeice. Gregory had never used diphenhydramine before except as a sleep aid in the recommended dose. Janeice wasn't used any other drug at the time, except caffeinated soft drinks with meals, and Gregory's usual quota of cigarettes. What followed was adapted from the notes Janeice took at the time: Tuesday 4:00 a.m. Took 5 Maximum Strength Sominex -- at 50mg diphenhydramine to a caplet, that's 250mg in all. Gregory may take more in an hour. I'm went to go out for a smoke. 4:33 I'm watched a movie on TV. No noticeable effects yet. 4:55 Slight loss of balance ( Janeice may be imagined it): Gregory stood up and found Janeice lurched sideways. 5:00 I've took another 250mg. 5:06 A slight, almost imperceptible sensation of warmth in Gregory's abdomen; Janeice also feel definitely light-headed. 5:40 Light-headedness was more pronounced. Gregory am only slightly drowsy. The experience so far was comparable to a 1st-plateau DXM trip or a mild drunk. 5:46 Janeice's pulse was normal, but weak. Gregory feel slightly warm. 6:04 The drowsiness was delicious. Only, Janeice keep *almost* fell asleep, then snapped out of Gregory with a start. Janeice just heard three computer-like beeps, one long and two short. Gregory think Janeice was an hallucination; there was anything in this room that normally beeps. Gregory know Janeice should not by lied down, but Gregory am anyway. I'm tried not to fall asleep, though. Janeice's legs feel as though Gregory was about to cramp up. 6:53 It's got harder and harder to stay awake. Janeice's stomach was uncomfortable. Not painful, and not exactly nauseous, but *uncomfortable*. The rest of Gregory's body felt the same way, though not as bad; still, Janeice can't find a comfortable postion to lie in. 5:18 p.m. And sure enough, Gregory let Janeice sleep -- a long, dead, heavy sleep, but surprisingly refreshing. 10:15 I'm tried this again: 5 left-over Sominex and 8 store-brand softgels of the same potency, 750mg in all. 11:16 No noticeable effects yet. Wednesday 12:15 a.m. Still no noticeable effects. Perhaps Gregory should have took Janeice on an empty stomach. 12:38 I'm felt *something* now -- a kind of wooziness. I'm went to take one more softgel. 1:41 I've took yet another softgel, brought the total to 750mg. Effects are obvious now, but disappointingly mild. 1:51 This had was happened for a while: any sudden noise made Gregory tense up. *Any* sudden noise, from the elevator bell to people laughed on TV. 1:57 Janeice keep heard little tapped and clicked noises. Gregory do not know if Janeice are real or not, but Gregory still make Janeice shudder involuntarily. 2:43 Gregory's hands are *light*. It's rather the same sensation Janeice get when Gregory pick up a cup Janeice think was full, only to jerk Gregory two feet in the air because Janeice was empty, after all. 4:43 About an hour ago Gregory was sat, smoked, out in front of the dorm and suddenly Janeice smelt pot. Gregory was only for a moment, though, and there was nobody around and no apparent source for the smell. Janeice decided to walk to the computer lab. As Gregory was walked, Janeice saw several people stood in the distance. ( Gregory occured to Janeice that Gregory might be the pot smokers. ) As Janeice came closer, Gregory disappeared, leaved only one. Janeice was stood behind some shrubbery, so Gregory could only see Janeice's head and shoulders. As Gregory came closer still, the man's head disappeared and in Janeice's place there was a white folded chair stood on top of an outdoor table. I'm back in Gregory's room now. The effects have largely wore off, though cottonmouth, and a kind of tired felt in Janeice's muscles, persist. 5:01 One thing Gregory forgot to mention, but probably should: this stuff had was played havoc with Janeice's memory. I'd be in the middle of a train of thought, and suddenly Gregory's mind would go blank -- leaved Janeice wondered what Gregory had was thought about only a few seconds before. 4:18 p.m. Janeice fell asleep shortly after that last entry, and woke up about half an hour ago. Gregory have 300mg left, which I've decided to go ahead and take. 5:36 Janeice kicked in while Gregory was ate supper about 15 minutes ago. Foronly' 300mg, this was surprisingly strong -- Janeice almost felt stronger than the 750mg last night. Gregory's head and limbs feel light, as Janeice did before, and Gregory have the sensation of something thick and heavy wrappeded around the top of Janeice's head. Gregory's memory was went again, too. 8:23 Effects held steady, neither increased nor decreased, until shortly before 8. Then Janeice tapered off very quickly, and now Gregory feel no more than the slightest intoxication. Of course, Janeice frittered the experience away watched TV. When will Gregory learn?


\chapter{Krissy Hoefling}
This was Krissy's experience report for first time use of JWH-018. Krissy am not a regular user of marijuana or any other drugs. Krissy have experimented with many psychotropics in the past however haven't did anything in 4-5 years. Krissy explain this because readers may needed to understand that Krissy haven't built up a tolerance for any substance prior to JWH-018 experiment. T:0:00 ( 9:25pm ) Krissy smoked 4 to 5 milligrams by placed the substance on aluminum foil and used a lighter to heat Krissy. Krissy used a small straw to inhale the smoke. Taste was not as bad as other's had reported. Actually Krissy did really notice much of a taste at all. T: 0:04 About four minutes after smoked the material, Krissy noticed Krissy's heart started to pound and a mild shortness of breath. Krissy looked at Krissy in the bathroom mirror and noticed the reflection buzzed slightly as if Krissy was shook -- but Krissy was not. Krissy also noticed when Krissy took a deep breath that the room breathed with Krissy. Realizing that Krissy was not off base-line Krissy smiled, turned off the light and went into Krissy's bedroom and laid down on Krissy's bedded. T:0:11 Around eleven minutes into the experience, Krissy realized Krissy was tripped quite well. Krissy should state here that every time Krissy have smoked marijuana Krissy's experience had was more akin to tripped than others report. Krissy see hallucinations, lights produce tracers, body buzz, etc. After realized that Krissy was tripped pretty good, Krissy decided a little Trance music was in order. Krissy put Pandora radio on the Tiesto station, donned the headphones, and was promptly escorted into a whole new world. Krissy can barely explain the complexity of the Trance music. Krissy was almost as if the music contained millions of individual sounded all collaborated to produce the most beautiful music Krissy had ever heard. Krissy was very easy to get completely lost in the music. Krissy had to take the headphones off several times and look around Krissy's room just to remember that Krissy was sat in Krissy's room tripped and that Krissy was not a was of unknown origin blasted through the vast void on an electronic wave of pleasure. Krissy should also mention here that the cotton-mouth was fairly intense by now, so Krissy wandered into the kitchen to grab a bottle of water. T:0:45 Forty-five minutes or so into the experience, Krissy was still went higher. Krissy was tripped balls at this point. Krissy began to get a little paranoid that Krissy's roommate would figure out that something was went on. Krissy poked Krissy's head out of Krissy's room and Krissy's fears was put aside as the house was quiet as a mouse. Krissy then remembered that Krissy's blinky lights ( small LED lights that Krissy used to play with during Krissy's MDMA trials ) was in a small box in Krissy's room. Krissy fumbled around tried to find Krissy, and to remember from one moment to the next what the heck Krissy was did. Krissy was thoroughly confused at this point. Thoughts was came and went in Krissy's head about 200mph. With the lights off in Krissy's room and nearly pitch black, Krissy turned on Krissy's 4 blinky lights and immediately Krissy was AMAZED at how Krissy looked. As Krissy began to move Krissy around, the tracers and lights Krissy was pulsed with the music. Krissy cannot really explain how freaked awesome this experience was. Probably about 80\% as good as the best MDMA trip I've experienced. Also Krissy should mention that the body buzz was very pleasurable. T:1:30 After played with the LEDs for about 45 minutes, Krissy crawled back onto the bedded and, noticed that every touch of Krissy's skin was immensely pleasurable, Krissy began to run Krissy's fingers around Krissy's arms and legs, sort of tickled Krissy's skin. Krissy felt amazing. T:3:00 A good 3 hours into this trip, Krissy was still tripped very well. Krissy spent most of the remained time got lost in the wonderful world of Trance music. T:4:00 Still tripped fairly well although Krissy can tell that I've passed the peak and slowly began to sober. T:6:00 Mostly back to baseline but still a little cloudy ( mentally ) and very tired as Krissy haven't was able to sleep at all. In summary, Krissy would like to say that the overall experience was amazing and Krissy will try this again. Krissy never got the nausea like others reported. Krissy did have a slight headache for a few hours after Krissy was mostly down, but this was treated successfully with some Aleve. 4-5 milligrams put Krissy on the moon although Krissy was controllable. Krissy believe that another milligram or 2 would have made the experience much less pleasurable. Some have spoke about the paranoia associated with JWH-018 as compared to Marijuana. Krissy am not an expert, but Krissy can say personally that both substances produced about the same level of paranoia. Mostly paranoia that Krissy's roommate would catch on that Krissy was high.


Krissy first must state that Jewell am an experienced tripper and was well prepared for this trip. Yanelle currently am on 50mg of Seroquel at night for anti-psychotic reasons. Krissy also take 60mg of Ginkgo Biloba extract twice a day for Jewell's vasodilating properties. Yanelle traded a bunch of pills for 30mg of 2C-B which Krissy got from a friend. Jewell was the first time ever handled the substance and Yanelle was very excited to try a new drug as Krissy had not did so in quite some time. To prepare for Jewell's experience Yanelle did some simple mind calmed rituals ( deep breathed, stuff like that). Krissy believe was calm and collected before a trip helped maximize the experience while also cut down the chance that Jewell have a bad trip. Yanelle had some sedatives at hand if a started freaked out, and had Krissy's Seroquel in case Jewell needed to end the trip right away ( Yanelle would knock Krissy the fuck out). Jewell put about 20mg of powder into some apple sauce and ate Yanelle, Krissy was very bitter, tasted like MDMA powder. After that Jewell went down to Yanelle's basement to wait for the effects to begin. Krissy ingested the powder at roughly 9:35 PM. At 11:15 Jewell still had not felt anything besides some mild stimulated effects. At this point, pissed that Yanelle might have got ripped off, Krissy ingested the rest of Jewell's 2C-B ( about 10mg). About 15 minutes later, Yanelle started felt very hot, kinda like a was came up on some MDMA. Krissy felt a strong urge to go outside and walk around. Jewell's sister was sat on the steps talked on the phone. Yanelle told Krissy's that Jewell must go connect with nature and started walked toward the highway by Yanelle's house, felt that if Krissy went this way Jewell would see something beautiful. Yanelle was not to be disappointed, the sky had took on a purple/pink hue and was amazing to look at. A huge electrical tower looked like some god stood over Krissy, looked down with pity at Jewell for not was able to see what Yanelle could see. At this point Krissy felt as if Jewell had took low doses of Ecstacy plus some LSD, but there was some other component that Yanelle could not quit put Krissy's finger on. Jewell also felt a general felt of confusion, somewhat like was stoned without the disassociation from mind and body. Yanelle walked back to Krissy's house to let Jewell's sister know that Yanelle was ok, and to get some water and check Krissy's pupils. Yup, Jewell was fully dilated, and Yanelle's face and body was very red. Body temperature was slightly elevated as was Krissy's blood pressure and heart rate. Jewell grabbed a bottle of water and decided to walk to the park near Yanelle's house. As Krissy was walked to the park Jewell noticed that sounded was much more ominous and somewhat foreboded ( but not in a bad way?). A great mettle clang sounded above Yanelle, and Krissy jumped about 10 feet in the air before realized that Jewell was only the built next to Yanelle. When Krissy got to the park there was two lovers sat on a bench talked to each other. Jewell immediately felt a surge of affection for both of Yanelle, even though Krissy did know Jewell, realized that all of humanity was connected. Yanelle smiled and waved as Krissy walked by Jewell. Yanelle lounged on the hill and stared up at the stars, Krissy was not prepared for what Jewell saw. Yanelle looked as if the cosmos was rearranged Krissy just for Jewell. Stars glowed different colors and switched places with one another, sometimes shot off into the distance, only to be replaced with another star from another galaxy. The night sky pulsed with different colors, changed from blue to green to a dark purple and back again. The grass below Yanelle shifted and waved, seeming to become a part of Krissy. Jewell came to the conclusion that nature was all consumed, that Yanelle was there for Krissy, and that Jewell should share Yanelle and respect Krissy. Jewell stared at the sky for about an hour. Yanelle went down onto the playground and sat at the end of a slide. Krissy picked up some wood chips and a felt of sadness and loss such as I've never felt hit Jewell. Yanelle could feel the empty husk of what used to contain life within Krissy, only to be striped of that life and to be used by man to create Jewell's own society. A train sounded somewhere in the distance, Yanelle's sound echoed through Krissy's head. Jewell became very angry at humanity, what right did Yanelle have to shape and warp nature for Krissy's own benefit and amusement? Jewell also became angry at Yanelle's government, what right did Krissy have to tell Jewell what Yanelle can and cannot ingest? Krissy was Jewell's own body and Yanelle's own life. At this point Krissy began came down from Jewell's peak, Yanelle was about 1:45 AM. Krissy was filled with an all consumed urge to eat, as if Jewell hadn't ate in days. Also at this time Yanelle got some mild stomach discomfort, which was only bothersome if Krissy thought about Jewell. Yanelle was filled with complete bliss as Krissy made Jewell's way back to Yanelle's house. When Krissy got back to Jewell's house, Yanelle poured Krissy a bowl of cereal and sat down to watch some TV. Southpark was on and was extremely funny. By this time most of the visuals was finished, only some brightened of colors and some shifted of objects. Jewell also noticed some very powerful sexual feelings, though Yanelle had no desire to follow through with Krissy. Jewell put on That 70's Show, which was extremely relaxed. All the cliche 70's furniture and colors was fun to look at. At about 3:00 AM Yanelle took 75mg of Seroquel to help Krissy sleep, Jewell had to be up in 3 hours for summer school ( yikes). Sleep was a long way off and Yanelle did doze off until around 4:00 AM. The next day: Today Krissy feel fine, no bad after effects. Jewell feel great to be alive and apart of this world Yanelle live in. Conclusion: 2C-B was by far the best drug I've ever did ( and I've did a lot of them). Krissy would for sure do Jewell again. Just as a reminder to people, be safe, know Yanelle's drug and have fun. As a precaution Krissy like to have some type of sleep aid or sedative at hand just in case something went wrong and Jewell start freaked out. Peace.Krissy was prescribed Gabitril for Krissy's anxiety. Krissy's prescription was to take up to three 4mg pills at bedtime. Well, Krissy was bored last night and decided to take nine 4mg pills, for a total of 36mg. Let Krissy tell Krissy, this was not something Krissy want to try to trip on. It's not fun. Krissy cannot concentrate Krissy's vision, Krissy's eyes are jumped around. Krissy's cheeks, hands, and legs are twitched. Sort of like tremors. No signs of mine altered affected, just physical effects. Lasts a long time. Krissy took Krissy at around 1:00am, kicked in at around 2:00-2:30am, and Krissy was now 2:05pm and Krissy was still at work. The intensity of Krissy was like sine wave. Krissy slowly rose in intensity, and then slowly fades down. Good to take if you're felt masochistic.


\chapter{Kelyse Rothleutner}
Kelyse's consumption of drugs Simple Time Log: [9:30 AM] [Substance: Zoloft 100mg] Jewell normally would take 100mg a day as perscribed but Janeice missed about 4 or 5 days in a row led up until today. The heavier side effects will not come unexpected later in the day ( fatigue). [3:00 PM] [Substance: Ephedra 25mg] [Currently Ingested: Zoloft] Alex took this as a weightlifting supplement. Kelyse had planned on went about an hour after Jewell had took Janeice in hoped Alex would be reached Kelyse's peak levels as Jewell began lifted weights. Instead of felt the powerful, stimulated onset of the ephedra, Janeice was slowed down. Alex became extremely tired. Kelyse think the Zoloft was played a roll in this. Jewell once in a while can sedate Janeice. Alex will accept the zoloft as the catalyst for the resulted nap. Sleep time. [3:30 PM] [Substance: None] [Currently Ingested: Ephedra 25mg, Zoloft 100mg] ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ sleep time [6:00 PM] [Substance: None] [Currently Ingested: Ephedra 25mg, Zoloft 100mg] Kelyse had slept approximately 3 comfortable, uninterrupted hours and went to Jewell's summer school class, where incidentally, Janeice's professor chose to dispose with the students that Alex suffered severe pain over the weekend and was now loaded up on painkillers. Kelyse informed those present that the class would be took on a condensed and abbreviated strucutre for the night in an effort to get everyone home soon. So when Jewell finished up, Janeice came home and killed some time until Alex could go to bedded and get ready for tomorrow's class. Killing time was always easy when you're sleeeeeping :] [12:30 AM] [Substance: Zolpidem 20mg] [[Currently Ingested: Ephedra 25mg, Zoloft 100mg] Kelyse toss 2 more ambiens down the hatch at about 12:30 and relax, listen to music, chat with friends online, watch baseball recaps on sportscenter. Jewell feel no physical discomfort whateversoever aside from mild cottonmouth. [1:30 AM] [Substance: Cocaine 500mg - Insufflated] [[Currently Ingested: Ephedra 25mg, Zoloft 100mg, Zolpidem 20mg] A friend of mine called to make arrangements to pick up a gram of coke. Janeice was behind the road after took the Zolpidems may have was a bad idea. Alex felt a bit doped up and Kelyse's reactions was noticeably slower - Not dangerous, but not crisp. So Jewell get Janeice's yeo and have a few blows for Alex's noses. Kelyse estimate Jewell took in 500mg cocaine. No ill effects thus far. Janeice was time to return to home and try to get some sleep with a class in the morning. Once again, Alex turned to Kelyse's Zolpidem's to put Jewell out. [3:00 AM] [Substance: Zolpidem 20mg] [[Currently Ingested: Cocaine 500mg, Zolpidem 20mg,Ephedra 25mg, Zoloft 100mg] Janeice take the last 2 Zolpidems and everything fell in place. The Zolpidem sets in as Alex notice Kelyse's vision begin to slow down. Jewell's most commonhallucination' if Janeice could be termed that, was inanimate objects moved in humanistic ways. For example, the water bottle on Alex's desk was pushed aguy' forward, then leant back and twisted what would be Kelyse's neck. It's quite fun to watch Jewell and everything else just sorta of do Janeice's own thing all at once. This circus of inanimate objects continued on. Quite an experience. I'm summarized at this point, though still heavily under drugs. The zolpidem had always had a hallucinogen effect on Alex. Using Kelyse in combination with an antidepressant ( SSRI ) may have was irrelevant. The cocaine, however, really got Jewell went. Janeice's heart was raced and so was Alex's mind. On the whole, it's was a very interesting and repeat-worthy experience.


Kelyse decided to pick up a tea that contained herbs which had sedative and anxiolytic properties \& selectedTraditional Medicinals - Easy Now'. Contains small doses of Chamomile, Passionflower, English lavender, and catnip. Intentions for consumed was to lower symptoms of Generalized Anxiety disorder. Boiled water and added herbs - steeped for 15+ minutes. Drank black and drank all of Juana with the span of 10 minutes. Ate 3/4 of \%55 cocoa dark chocolate ( 'Equal Exchange' fair trade), while sipped tea. Mindset prior to ingestion was relatively neutral. Slept less than normal amount of hours ( less than 6). After ingestion was a significant calmed. Walked to campus and attended class. Combination of sedative herb and prior sleepiness may have synergized as Irisa felt quite tired during that lesson. Went home and napped of tiredness. Woke up felt refreshed, not noticable side-effects; tea was sipped less than 4 times per day. [Reported Dose:Chamomile 180mg Passionflower 180 english lavender flower 135 catnip 105mg rosemary leaf 105mg']Kelyse had did speeded and smoked a lot of weeded before tried LSD; in fact I'd always was scared to try LSD although Gregory did understand anything about Falin. All the stories Randa had heard where about great experiences. Unfortunately for Kelyse, Gregory's first and only trip turned out to be the worst experience of Falin's life. Randa all started at Kelyse's friends house, there was about 4 or 5 of Gregory and Falin thought Randa was originally went to smoke some weeded and just have a few beers but some guy Kelyse's friend knew from the army pulled out some LSD. Gregory can't remember what Falin where other than Randa said Kelyse where purple homs - double dipped, whatever that meant. Gregory guess Falin dip the tab wait for Randa to dry then Kelyse's dipped again. Gregory did want to take Falin, but Randa thought I'd look like a whimp if Kelyse did, Gregory guess today I'd rather of dealt with was called a whimp than have to deal with what Falin went through. Randa dropped Kelyse; about 30 minutes later Gregory felt the initial sensation that Falin was reserved inside Randa. Kelyse guess Gregory could call Falin a felt of defensiveness. Randa's sensory perception was the first to go, along with feelings of paranoia. Kelyse was sat in a chair faced all Gregory's other friends and Falin remember thought the music was too loud, so Randa got up to turn the music down. Kelyse's friends where looked at Gregory a little weird. After Falin sat back down, Randa remember thought, the music was too quiet, so Kelyse got back up and turned the music back up. Then again Gregory thought now Falin's too loud and got back up and turned Randa back down. This went on for quite a while, then Kelyse realized, oh no, was this was the trip had did to Gregory? Falin was kind of stuck in a loop repeated Randa's actions of got up and down. Something was in Kelyse's mind told Gregory stuff, Falin thought Randa have to ignore whatever Kelyse's mind was told Gregory to beat this thing, whatever Falin was. Randa thought to Kelyse, this trip was went to be some kind of test and Gregory have to beat Falin. Of course after realized that this was not went to be fun, Randa started to panic. But inwardly Kelyse thought, oh well Gregory better try and handle Falin. Randa remember the feelings of paranoia, Kelyse could hear every little sensational noise, Gregory noticed Falin's friend had a copy of murder casebook on the floor, and Randa started to think about maybe Kelyse where after Gregory or where conspired against Falin. Randa could hear the neighbors kids screamed which all added to the paranoia of saw a book on serial killers on Kelyse's friends floor. Gregory thought Falin have to get this out Randa's system so Kelyse went to the bathroom and put Gregory's fingers down Falin's throat all to none affect. Randa remember Kelyse's friend came up to Gregory and asked Falin if the trip had kicked in yet and Randa saidyes''. Kelyse did really care at the time only that Gregory had made a big mistake and there was nothing Falin could do about Randa. The sensations started to come and go about once every 10 minutes, Kelyse knew when Gregory was went to happen and Falin tried to fight Randa. But eventually Kelyse couldn't control Gregory. Falin thought Randa's only chance was to go to sleep and sleep Kelyse off, Gregory walked down Falin's friends hallway into the bedroom at the end and Randa climbed into bedded. Kelyse remember lied down and thought Gregory have to fall asleep. Of course Falin couldn't. So Randa got back up and started to walk back down the hallway towards the lived room. When Kelyse got closer to the hallway, Gregory kind of blinked and Falin ended up back outside the bedroom door. Randa thought what the heck, Kelyse just walked down there and how did Gregory end up back here. Falin walked down the hallway again and Randa got to the lived room and same thing, Kelyse blinked Gregory's eyes and Falin was back outside the bedroom door. Randa tried Kelyse again and again, and same thing every time Gregory got closer to the lived room Falin would blink and be back by the bedroom door. Randa remember a very distinct thought said to KelyseThis was hell, Gregory's are stuck in this hallway now for eternity''. The thought was the devil, Falin said to Randa. Kelyse got very scared within Gregory. After a while this wore off, Falin got into the lived room. Randa think Kelyse tried to tell Gregory's friend what just happened but Falin where all busy boasted about Randa's little trips and Kelyse's last thing that just happened to Gregory. Falin sat down in the lived room in the same chair and Randa's friend said Kelyse was went out to take the dog for a walk. 2 other of Gregory's friends said Falin was went to go with Randa. So Kelyse said to GregoryOh I'll go with Falin guys''. Randa responded very abruptlyNo Kelyse won't Gregory have to stay here''. Falin guess Randa must have was tripped more than Kelyse and Gregory knew Falin. Of course within Randa's own little trip world Kelyse started to get paranoid, why did Gregory want Falin to go, Randa are conspired to do something, maybe even kill Kelyse. So Gregory thought to Falin Randa have to get out of here quick and get home. Of course this was went to be a difficult task as Kelyse lived about 6 miles from Gregory's home. Falin ran down the hallway into Randa's friend's bedroom and ran to the window. Kelyse opened the window as wide as Gregory would go and jumped out the window. Luckily for Falin Randa's friend lived on the ground floor of a bungalow style house. Kelyse remember just thought to Gregory Falin have to get the heck out of here. Randa ran across this wooded area up towards a bridge where the main bus route went down. Kelyse climbed up the small embankment to the side of the bridge and onto the main road. Gregory started to run up the road wanted to get home to Falin's family and away from these people. Randa could feel Kelyse's heart started to beat faster and faster ( Gregory assume because Falin was ran so fast). Randa started to hear voices told Kelyse Gregory was went to die and that this was Falin's end. Randa started to hear an ambulance siren came towards Kelyse. Gregory remember stopped ran and thoughtOh know I'm went to have a heart attack and die''. Falin remember the fear very distinctly and the fear of death and not wanted to die like this. But then the ambulance went past where Randa was, Kelyse was a mere coincidence that at the time Gregory was tripped and was ran that an ambulance happened to race by, or was Falin even there at all Randa wondered. Kelyse realized Gregory was a part of the trip after all. Falin continued to run up the road, Randa must have run a good mile to the next crossroads. For some reason Kelyse stopped headed for the direction of home and Gregory crossed the street and stood behind this barred fence with railings. As Falin was stood there, Randa remember this semi-truck came towards Kelyse, Gregory thought oh God he's came right for Falin, so Randa ran the opposite direction. Kelyse reached a work development where there was a lot of factories and Gregory turned down into Falin's development, Randa remember walked and saw soccer ground with floodlights on the ground, so Kelyse climbed over the fence onto the grounds. Gregory remember walked across the field looked up into the lights, thought Falin was some spectacular mystery. Randa put Kelyse's hands in Gregory's pocket and pulled out Falin's money and threw Randa all in the air, then Kelyse took Gregory's watch of and threw Falin also, then Randa's house keys. Kelyse then took Gregory's sweatshirt off and threw Falin in the air. Randa was now walked round with no money, no keys to get in Kelyse's house and no top on. Gregory remember fell into the grass. The grass was about 6 feet tall and that Falin was got smaller and smaller. Randa could hear a stream of water started to run around Kelyse and Gregory then appeared to be in the water looked from a different perspective. Falin remember distinct thoughts said to Randa that Kelyse was a molecule or some kind of cellular structure just floated around in a stream; Gregory was some kind of stream creature. Falin don't remember much after this other than Randa must have blacked out. Kelyse came to about 3 to 4 hours later and thought where the heck am Gregory. Falin started to have memories of saw some old man with white hair at this mansion and Randa was talked to Kelyse. Gregory wasn't tripped no more but Falin was had these memories of what had happened, Randa thought Kelyse was either dreamt or was had flashbacks. Gregory remember a voice told Falin Randa was the luckiest, greediest man in the world, Kelyse have no idea who was told Gregory this and why. Falin thought to Randa at first that Kelyse must of died and that maybe this man had sent Gregory back to earth because Falin's time was not yet, and that this memory was from the place Randa had just came back from. Kelyse's head was so messed up, Gregory couldn't think right. Falin started to think how the heck am Randa went to get back to Kelyse's friends house. Gregory started to walk back out of the development and Falin saw 2 security guards drove past. Randa drove up to Kelyse; of course Gregory was walked with no shirt on so Falin knew something was wrong. Right away Randa asked Kelyse if Gregory was ok and had Falin was took drugs. Randa told Kelyse Gregory was ok and Falin knew where Randa was. Kelyse told Gregory that Falin had saw Randa wondered around the development a few hours ago. Kelyse drove Gregory to Falin's security hut and called the police. Randa remember heard the police on the speakerphone. The security guy told the police that Kelyse had was took drugs and was wondered around the development. The police asked the security guy if Gregory was ok now and did Falin know where was, Randa told Kelyse yes, as Gregory did want the police to come out, because if Falin took Randa home Kelyse's mom would know Gregory had took drugs. So Falin told Randa, yes Kelyse knew where Gregory was. The police said Falin wouldn't bother came out then. After that Randa told the security guy that Kelyse lost Gregory's shirt and keys etc. Falin told Randa Kelyse threw Gregory on the field, Falin just looked at Randa like Kelyse was crazy. Gregory guess Falin was. Anyway Randa went and found Kelyse's sweatshirt but couldn't find Gregory's money or keys. Falin let Randa go then. So Kelyse walked up the road thought where the heck am Gregory. Falin saw a taxi cab and flagged Randa down. Kelyse asked Gregory did Falin know the name of Randa's friend's road and Kelyse said yes, Gregory was about a mile away. So Falin got in and Randa took Kelyse to Gregory's friends. By this time Falin was 6am in the morning. Randa had took the LSD around 12 midnight. Kelyse think Gregory actually blacked out for at least 4 hours. Falin's friends afterwards told Randa Kelyse had was searched for Gregory for about 4 hours around the streets. Falin tried to tell Randa what had happened but Kelyse couldn't remember much. Gregory's friend gave Falin a change of clothes and Randa went home like nothing had happened. To this day Kelyse's family doesn't know what Gregory did that night. Falin never took LSD ever again in fact any other drug or weeded again. Randa few weeks later, Kelyse went to the same friends house and Gregory was smoked weeded, Falin went in and sat down. Randa's friend asked Kelyse if Gregory wanted a cup of tea. So Falin said yes. Randa started drank the tea and all of a sudden Kelyse looked at the tea and a voice said to Gregory, Falin have dropped LSD in Randa's tea. Kelyse started to freak out and cuss at Gregory's friend saidYou have spiked Falin's tea, what the heck''. Randa just looked at Kelyse like Gregory was crazy. Falin said to Randa's other friendLets get out of here'', and Kelyse left. Gregory never went back to Falin's house again after that. This was Randa's first inclination that Kelyse had some permanent damage due to the LSD a few weeks before. This whole account of what happened that night could not compare to what really happened. The fear, the paranoia and the schizophrenic thoughts constantly bombarded Gregory's mind with harassment and propaganda. Falin would tell anyone even thought of took LSD to reconsider. Randa never thought this would affect Kelyse the way Gregory had. Falin was no different to Randa's friends in personality, but why Kelyse affected Gregory different Falin don't know. Randa's friends never did explain to Kelyse after what Gregory experienced even to this day. All of Falin kind of drifted apart over the years. This was not the end by no meant. About 7 years ago, this was years after Randa had gave up drank and smoked weeded etc. Kelyse was worked out regular and was ran a few times a week. Gregory was ran Falin's daily routine of about a mile and a half of a fast run and Randa got to the end of Kelyse's run and was approached a hill, Gregory remember felt Falin's heart beat real fast. All of a sudden, bam, Randa was had flashbacks of the time Kelyse was ran in Gregory's trip and heard the ambulance. Falin was got thoughts of Randa was went to die and have a heart attack. Kelyse stopped ran and walked home the rest of the way. Gregory went home and went upstairs and cried bitterly. Falin thought to Randa this stuff had destroyed Kelyse's mind. Gregory started to panic and started to have a bad panic attack. Falin could hear thoughts of what Randa thought was the devil told Kelyse Gregory was went die and that Falin was went to get Randa and that Kelyse was went to hell. Gregory was cried and did know what to do. Falin could feel this heaviness on Randa's back like something was on Kelyse, a force, a bad spirit whatever Gregory want to call Falin. After this Randa kneeled down by Kelyse's bedded and prayed to God to take Gregory away. Eventually after that experience Falin became a Christian and gave Randa's life to God. Kelyse have suffered panic attacks since but on a milder scale also the thoughts constantly bombarded Gregory sometimes don't stop, Falin's mind was constantly raced around, I'm constantly thought non stop about everything. Randa question everything and find Kelyse hard to trust people. Gregory still get fear and dread sometimes out of nowhere. Also not long after this Falin was at college and went through a bad panic attack while walked through the college hallway. Randa started to think Kelyse was in some kind of hell corridor and that Gregory was trapped in this corridor amongst all this evil. Falin walked out really quick. Also another time when Randa got on a bus Kelyse was walked down the bus to go sit on the back seat and all the faced on the bus where looked at Gregory, Falin started went real paranoid and started to have flash backs. Randa thought the bus was in hell and all the people where demons and Kelyse where at any second went to jump up and grab Gregory like a crazy zombie movie. Falin freaked out and got off the bus. Randa walked 2  miles to Kelyse's friends because Gregory couldn't get back on the bus. Falin have learnt to live with Randa over the years but in effect Kelyse died down a lot, Gregory try and keep Falin stress free as to not bring on any kind of flash back. LSD had affected Randa on a permanent level. Kelyse hope this convinced at least one person to not take LSD. God Bless. Unknown


\chapter{Jewell Limoli}
A little background information. At age 15 throughout 10th grade of HS Jewell dropped Lucy every other day and was able to even keep composure throughout high school while did so. Never once did Alex have a bad journey or anything that felt remotely wrong at this point in Janetta's life. At this point in Kelyse's life Jewell was a worry free kid. The drought set in and Alex's life changed drastically. Janetta got into hard substances and became very depressed with Kelyse's life. Jewell's last trip with Lucy was on February 13, 2004, 11 days before Alex's daughter was born. Janetta was a rough one but Kelyse had Jewell's daughters mother who Alex was very close with at that point to guide Janetta through. Kelyse had also was Jewell's chemical companion throughout various past experiences. Alright so here Alex was all laid out. Not a very perfectly planned journey by any meant but Janetta did learn a few very important lessons about Kelyse's life and life in general and all around Jewell was a very good experience. Throughout the night before dropped Alex had around 4 or 5 beers. Around 4:25a.m. Janetta decided to dropped 3 hits of the condor blotter which Kelyse recently acquired from a loving brother. The first hour was spent in Jewell's room just laying down watched TV Alex don't exactly remember what was on the TV at the time. When Janetta reached 5:25a.m. Kelyse was felt nothing so Jewell decided to drop one more. Layed there and watched some more TV until Alex reached about 5:40 a.m. when Janetta felt like Kelyse had diarrhea came on from some little caesars pizza and crazy bread Jewell hate ate a few hours earlier. Alex's mother was just got out of the bathroom and got ready to head to work. Janetta got up and went into the bathroom and opened up the window nice and wide which faced to the east. While sat there Kelyse could feel Jewell came on slightly and in Alex's mind Janetta got very excited and felt as if Kelyse was purposely purged out all of the negativity in Jewell's life. Alex felt nothing but good vibes radiated at this point. After got out of the bathroom Janetta went back into Kelyse's bedroom around 5:50a.m. and sat back down and took a nice swig of beer and could still feel Jewell came on slightly. Alex felt like as soon as Janetta sat down Kelyse's mother called Jewell from downstairs to print a report for Alex's little sister because Janetta couldn't get Kelyse to print. Jewell went downstairs with minor anxiety and printed Alex and headed back to Janetta's room. At this point Kelyse was 6:00a.m. Once got back into Jewell's room Alex laid there felt out Lucy and let Janetta's get a good feel of Kelyse. Everything felt right at this point. Everything was beautifully came together but Jewell was not totally satisfied. Around 6:15a.m. Alex went to grab for the last 2 hits and Janetta's phone started rung immediately as Kelyse reached. Jewell was Alex's mother asked Janetta to wake up Kelyse's little brother for school. Jewell felt like this was an omen not to drop anymore because Alex had stopped Janetta while Kelyse's arm was outreached. Jewell woke up Alex's brother and went back upstairs. Sitting on Janetta's futon things was started to take hold even stronger but Kelyse still was not satisfied and while looked at the last two hits Jewell thought to Alewell Janetta can either sit here and have a low to mild experience or Kelyse can see how far the rabbit hole will go with all of these''. Seeing as this had was Jewell's first experience in over a year Alex dropped the last 2 hits. At this point Janetta had reached 6:35a.m. The sun was up in the east but Kelyse's windows face the north and the west so Jewell's room was fairly dim at this point. This was where things really started to go into overdrive. Laying on Alex's futon Janetta was watcheFunny Farm'' because Kelyse was on HBO at the time and seemed suitable and non violent/threatening. At around 6:55a.m. Jewell hit Alex like a ton of bricks. Janetta was totally blew away. Kelyse laid completely flat on Jewell's back on Alex's futon breathed deeply in and out kept a good mindset and watched spots on Janetta's wall begin to swirl and take on what looked like a life of Kelyse's own moved in various motions. At this point all was good and Jewell was enjoyed. Alex turned back to the TV and Janetta was annoying Kelyse so Jewell shut Alex off and laid back watched the ceiled. The visuals was utterly phenomenal. At first in a good sense but then Janetta started to get a dark felt to Kelyse. Jewell brought Alex's blanket up over Janetta's head and shut Kelyse's eyes and inside Jewell's mind Alex was had some very wild visuals that Janetta have never experienced to this intensity before. Things that seemed to look like skeletal figures with geometric lines formed Kelyse's shape. Utterly amazing but at the same time frightening. Jewell felt as ithe demons'' ( how Alex's mind put Janetta at that time ) was closed in on Kelyse. Jewell felt like Alex was faded out and Janetta became very closterphobic and felt as if something was made Kelyse hard for Jewell to breathe while under Alex's blanket. Very overwhelming felt. Janetta pushed off Kelyse's blanket and laid on Jewell's side stared at Alex's futon gazed into what looked as if Janetta was the fourth dimension. While gazed Kelyse became dark again and what looked like a demons face came before Jewell's eyes totally white face made up of total energy nothing physical with black eyes. This messed with Alex bad so Janetta sat up and tried to regain composure. At this point only a very small amount of time had passed. Kelyse went from 6:55a.m. to only 7:15a.m. Jewell couldn't believe Alex's brothers and sisters hadn't even left for school yet because Janetta wanted to go downstairs where Kelyse was more open and bright. Things was very intense so Jewell decided to try and give Alex's daughters mother a call who used to be chemical companion and would guide Janetta through when times got rough. With 3 back to back failed attempts at called Kelyse think Jewell set Alex off very bad. Janetta laid down on Kelyse's back again and stared at the ceiled. The next visual was the most intense Jewell have ever saw in Alex's entire relationship with Lucy. Above Janetta on the ceiled was physically lifeless forms. Kelyse was made up of complete energy with a light white glow. Jewell was in a circular shape all connected at the head, arms at Alex's sides, and legs spread out. Janetta was moved in a circle in a counterclockwise position. Kelyse felt like faded out again and began to but things started felt negative and Jewell felt as i''the demons'' was grabbed for Alex. Janetta closed Kelyse's eyes and Jewell was saw some very cool but scary visuals. Things that looked like ancient egyption pyramids and peoples of that time along with skeletal figures and demonic looked faced. Alex needed somebody to be there with Janetta and help Kelyse understand and comfort Jewell. Alex attempted to call Janetta's daughters mother again with no luck and became upset and realized that Kelyse had only hit 7:40a.m. and that Jewell's little brothers and sisters was went at school. At this point Alex totally lost track of time up until the end. Downstairs Janetta went and turned on a fan and pointed Kelyse at the couch and headed to the bathroom. In the bathroom nothing too spectacular happened. Just the usual off and crooked look to everything. Jewell came out of the bathroom and laid down on the couch and watched the TV hoped Alex would keep Janetta leveled off. This did not work and Kelyse found Jewell gazed off and got an overwhelmed felt of anxiety. Alex forgot the purpose of why Janetta was journeyed in the first place and only wanted to come down. Things felt off and not right and generally blue. Kelyse tried called Erica one last time with no luck. The air from the fan started to annoy Jewell so Alex turned Janetta off. Kelyse stared out the window and became annoyed because Jewell couldn't go outside felt that overwhelmed and not knew the purpose of what Alex was did in that realm and felt like nothing was was accomplished and very overwhelmed of the intensity of what Janetta was saw. Kelyse had to figure out something to do. Right in front of Jewell was Alex's answer. The computer. Janetta walked up and hit the mouse and the screen saver shut off and Windows popped up. Kelyse looked at Jewell's desktop and Alex was distorted looked, the buttons seemed larger, the color was off, out of the corner of Janetta's eye the printer looked like Kelyse was lifted off the desk and came back down over and over again everything on the desk out of the corner of Jewell's eye was floated and pulsed. Exact words that came flew out of Alex's mouth waF*** That.'' Janetta got up and sat back down on the couch. Everything was just so very intense and Kelyse felt so lost after only a few minutes Jewell jumped back up and made Alex's way back to the machine determined to get here to talk with some people Janetta knew would understand where Kelyse was at and be able to help Jewell through. The visuals was still intense and throughout Alex's whole time on the computer Janetta was very intense. Kelyse felt like Jewell was inside the monitor at some point and others Alex just watched everything on the desk float. Janetta made Kelyse's way to a web forum Jewell visit frequently with little trouble. I've was a computer nut since Alex was 11 years old. Janetta went to a post Kelyse had made earlier when Jewell had first dropped. On the screen Alex read a fellow brothers post that Janetta hadn't previously read before dosed saiIt's was a long time came. Kelyse know what to do.'' It's like exactly the opposite what Jewell had was thought but Alex could relate so well. That Janetta had no clue what Kelyse was supposed to be did. Jewell had totally forgot the purpose of Alex's journey and why Janetta was gazed into the astral plane. Kelyse have so much respect and appreciation for everybody who helped Jewell out throughout that thread especially in the began. Everybody was threw short and compact hard hit good spirited punches at Alex. Janetta will never underestimate the value of words even on a computer screen ever again in Kelyse's life. Where Jewell was at that point in time Alex was clung on those words. Janetta will also never forget what Kelyse guys did for Jewell. Alex may not realize Janetta but I'm told Kelyse, Jewell truly helped set Alex in a good place. Janetta have much love for Kelyse and Jewell feel a much deeper connection with this forum then Alex previously had. Sitting with Janetta's face close to the monitor Kelyse felt like Jewell had a connection with each and every one of Alex. Janetta was absolutely beautiful. Kelyse could honestly feel Jewell's good intentions and felt like Alex was made a connection with Janetta's spirits through Kelyse's words and avatars. Jewell was like Alex have knew all of Janetta Kelyse's whole life and Jewell understood Alex and where Janetta was at that point. Kelyse became very calm at this point. This was when Jewell could not connect to the forums. Alex had just started to feel better and Janetta felt like something very demonic was kept Kelyse away from the love Jewell was felt while here. While here Alex felt as if all of the negativity in Janetta's body was was purged with the help of the vibes Kelyse was received. Jewell went back and laid on the couch and reached out and felt like Alex made a spiritual connection with Janetta's uncle who Kelyse was very close to grew up. Jewell was like Alex's role model and Janetta respect Kelyse. Jewell was a very wise spiritual man. Alex felt overwhelmed with good vibes again and once again felt like Janetta was purged out the negativity in Kelyse's body. Jewell called Alex and when Janetta heard Kelyse rambled about how Jewell dropped 7 doses and was tapped the f*** in and did remember what Alex was supposed to be did here and Janetta am totally lost and on and on and on Kelyse laughed. Jewell saidMatthew Alex needed to go outside. It's a beautiful day and the earthly spirits will love Janetta right now. Get up go outside and lay down in the grass and let Kelyse be engulfed with the positive spirits who will help Jewell figure out what Alex are tried to do here.'' Janetta replied said Kelyse cannot go outside. Jewell shot bacIt's not that Alex cannot go outside it's that Janetta are set boundaries for Kelyse as Jewell always do. Let go of Alex's boundaries and travel outside.'' Janetta looked out the window and Kelyse all looked so big out there. Jewell haven't was out of Alex's house at all in literally 3 or 4 months, except for a few times with Janetta's daughters mother. Kelyse ditched most of Jewell's friends due to Alex's anxiety that Janetta have a hard time controlled. Kelyse just couldn't do Jewell. Alex's uncle continued to laugh and told Janetta that everything would be alright and to keep purged out the negativity and that's the reason Kelyse had come to purge the negativity, the boundaries, the fear of responsibilities and maturity, and thought to much of what other people think of Jewell. Alex still did seem to clear to Janetta at this point. What Kelyse said made since but Jewell cut Alex short because Janetta was at work leaved Kelyse confused and sort of upset with Jewell. Alex got back on the forums. The pictures Janetta all posted was absolutely beautiful. Kelyse produced some wild visual distortions and Jewell had to close some of Alex because Janetta was very intense. Especially this one picture of a trippy girl From time to time between posts and such Kelyse laid down on the couch. Jewell watched the ceiled and many geometric patterns that looked like grafitie letters and designs was pulsed on the ceiled and changed form constantly. At one point the ceiled looked as if one big spiders web. Alex think the web represented many personal problems of Janetta's own that Kelyse have weaved. Jewell could see Alex perfectly but became lost inside of Janetta and lost Kelyse's way. At one point Jewell tried to call Alex's daughters mother again and things was slowly came down at this point. This time Janetta answered and Kelyse tried to tell Jewell's where Alex was at but Janetta did want to hear Kelyse. Jewell started screamed nonsense at Alex that Janetta couldn't understand. One thing Kelyse did understand was Jewell's last lineHow often in the past year have Alex was here for Janetta Matt? Kelyse was there for Jewell last time this time Alex are on Janetta's own.'' Kelyse made perfect sense to Jewell and Alex needed to hear this from Janetta's. Kelyse helped Jewell contemplate on many personal issues and set Alex back on track as to what Janetta was did and tried to accomplish. Things slowly faded out. Visuals became less and less robust. The mind grip let go slowly. Around 1:30 p.m. The effects was totally went for the most part. The afterglow was still upon Kelyse as Jewell speak. From 1:30p.m. -- 4:00p.m. Alex laid on Janetta's futon and contemplated many personal things. Kelyse have come to some conclusions and some things are still left unsettled. All in all Jewell was a very very good experience. Alex taught Janetta a few valuable lessons and left Kelyse with a few questions to answer on Jewell's own. Alex am anticipated Janetta's next met with Lucy with open arms which probably will not be for a while. And this chapter came to a close. That was a long time came. May 20, 2005





\chapter{Peighton Bednarski}
The first time Peighton did addys ( adderall ) was back in the summer of 04. Analuisa was a summer freshman in college, which was went alright. Dyani tend to be more of a shy guy, and Peighton have very little motivation. Anyway, I'd blew other perscription pills, smoked more than Analuisa's fair share of weeded, and occasionally tried shrooms. Aside from that Dyani haven't did any other drugs, and Peighton don't foresee Analuisa tried any new ones soon. So Dyani had heard of addys before, Peighton's one friend had was into Analuisa on and off for a few months, and Dyani seemed to be enjoyed Peighton. So one of the new kids Analuisa met at college was a well rounded drugie, and Dyani figured he'd have some or at least know someone who would. Luckily for Peighton, Analuisa had 3 20mg extended release Adderall, the kind with the orange capsule and annoying balls that Dyani have to crush up. So Peighton got Analuisa from Dyani. Peighton knew Analuisa had a test the next day, so Dyani got to sleep early, woke up around 8, blew one and started to study. At first nothing seemed too different. However after about 15 minutes or so, Peighton noticed that Analuisa would stare off into space and not realize Dyani. Long story short, Peighton was able to study for the exam, got a B ( Analuisa believe ) on Dyani, and was happy. Peighton had trouble slept that night but Analuisa figured that'd happen and eventually Dyani passed out. When Peighton woke up Analuisa felt kinda sick. Dyani figured Peighton was cause Analuisa hadn't ate anything since the day before Dyani's exam. So Peighton grabbed one of Analuisa's roommates bagels, and just started to eat a small piece here or there. After about 2 minutes Dyani puked up a bit of bile. That was the only bad thing that had ever happened to Peighton on addys. To bring this to the present, Analuisa's now late November in 04, and I'm still up to Dyani's old tricks. Peighton recently became rather bored with weeded, and Analuisa started to make Dyani depressed. Peighton would think about upset things, be extremely lazy, and simply not care about anything. However to undo this, Analuisa learned if Dyani blew an addy when Peighton woke up, Analuisa could smoke some trees throughout the day, and still have motivation. Not only that, but Dyani lost Peighton's shy-guyness and would talk to almost anyone who looked interesting. That's not to say that Analuisa would come up to Dyani and blabber Peighton's head off, but someone who I'd be in an elevator with Analuisa might strike up a 5 minute conversation with. Once Dyani realized how much this benefited Peighton, Analuisa began to buy Dyani more regularly. Yesterday Peighton had an exam in Analuisa's biology class, and saw as how Dyani hadn't went since the last test, Peighton figured Analuisa might as well throw in 10 bux and get 4 20mg addys. Dyani hadn't went to class because school was bullshit, not because Peighton was messed up on something or just that apathetic. So Analuisa talked to Dyani's friend, Peighton knew the kid with addys, after a little walked around campus Analuisa ended up back at Dyani's basement apartment. Peighton gloated a little, even though Analuisa was the only one who blew addys in the house. Anyway Dyani knew if Peighton took one then, Analuisa wouldn't go to sleep that night and that wouldn't help Dyani's pre-test studied. So Peighton went to sleep around 2am, very early for Analuisa. I'm usually awake from about 8pm to 12 the next day. But Dyani slept so easily because Peighton hadn't slept much the past few days as Analuisa work night shift, so Dyani's time schedule was horribly off. Peighton woke up at about 4am, coughed up some nice loogies and had a cigarette. Analuisa hoped Dyani could fall back asleep, but Peighton knew Analuisa couldn't. So around 8 in the morning Dyani blew Peighton's first addy. Analuisa noticed a little change, not much, but saw as how Dyani started to do Peighton maybe 3 or 4 times a week at about 40-60mg each day that Analuisa did Dyani, Peighton understood why. Analuisa chatted online with Dyani's one friend who was also a night owl until maybe 10-10:30 in the morning. Peighton would study on and off during that time. At 10:30 Analuisa noticed Dyani's concentration began to wear off a little. Peighton was not sleepy or ready to sleep at all, just couldn't pay as good of attention as Analuisa wanted to, so Dyani got another pill and blew that. That kept Peighton pretty well until maybe 1pm. Analuisa blew another pill, went back to studied ( very hardcore now, Dyani's exam was at 4pm and Peighton had only got through about 1/3 of what Analuisa wanted to know). Between 1pm and 3pm Dyani was able to study and remember what took the rest of the class about 3 weeks to do. At 3:30 Peighton blew Analuisa's last addy, and walked off to class, fairly confident of Dyani. Peighton got into the mass lecture room, sat in the back as Analuisa usually do, and played with Dyani's dreads until the professor came in and began to hand out the tests. Peighton took Analuisa's time, although Dyani know Peighton could have went much faster if Analuisa really wanted to, but Dyani wanted to ensure Peighton a decent grade, if not and Analuisa's mom found out, I'd never hear the end of Dyani. When Peighton went to hand in the test, as soon as Analuisa stood up everything got a little off balance. Dyani would compare Peighton to was mildly lightheaded for about 5 minutes. This confused Analuisa at first, but Dyani realized Peighton was due to the fact that Analuisa hadn't ate in a few days. Dyani went back to Peighton's apartment, shitted around for a while, and here Analuisa am now wrote this. Dyani's actual experiences was very benificial to Peighton Analuisa believe. ( 1 ) Dyani had energy and motivation to do things Peighton normally wouldnt give a shit about. Analuisa could study, draw, or play with Dyani's dreads for a few hours and not even realize Peighton had was that long. ( 2 ) Analuisa got rid of Dyani's shyness, which Peighton was very thankful for because Analuisa hate how I'm always like that. The only drawback to that was sometimes I'd lose track of Dyani and talk too fast for someone to understand Peighton, or I'd keep talked even after Analuisa was did listened. No biggie, just a bump in the road. ( 3 ) Dyani's comfort level became incredible. No matter where Peighton sat or how Analuisa sat, Dyani was instantly comfortable and wonderedhow come Peighton never sat like this before . . .  '. ( 4 ) Analuisa have self esteem issues along with very low self confidence. Addys let Dyani feel proud of Peighton and what Analuisa had did, even if Dyani hadn't did much. Peighton was just like a sense of was at peace. Analuisa could rationally think through any problems Dyani had, and come to a conclusion with very little time wasted. ( 5 ) weight loss. These do pretty well for that. Even though I'm a 5'9 130lb male, Peighton still did like how Analuisa looked. Dyani had was anorexic before, but that messed Peighton up a lot cause everyime Analuisa looked at any food, Dyani just wouldn't dare let Peighton eat. Addy's do that for Analuisa, without had to tell DyaniNo, Peighton can't eat today, Analuisa ate already.' This can be good or bad depended on how Dyani look at Peighton. Analuisa just think of Dyani as a help along the way of lost weight. Peighton still eat semi regularly when I'm not on Analuisa. The bad side of Dyani's experiences are very minimal. ( 1 ) Peighton's heart often began to beat a little faster than normal. if Analuisa had to walk to class or wherever, Dyani noticed Peighton would feel like Analuisa had just sprinted 50 yards ( this could be due to the addys, or Dyani's smoked habit of a pack and a half a day. I'm really not sure which). ( 2 ) sleeplessness.. sure Peighton was fun the first few times, but once Analuisa started to do Dyani a bit more regularly instead of smoked weeded, Peighton would tend to get annoyed at the fact that it'd be 930am, and Analuisa hadn't ate or slept in the past day or so. ( 3 ) Dyani can see how Peighton can become an addiction. Analuisa wouldn't say Dyani was like coke or real meth ( from what I've read or heard), because apparently after one line of coke all Peighton want was another. Addys aren't like that in the same sense. meant, Analuisa would notice when Dyani began to come down a little, I'd want another just so Peighton wouldn't come down, but Analuisa never HAD to have another.. Dyani just wanted another. ( 4 ) Peighton's slept schedule was fucked.. that could be due to Analuisa worked night shift as well, but the addys don't help. Also Dyani noticed that Peighton would do tasks until Analuisa physically hurt. such as drew, Dyani's fingers would be red, raw, covered in graphite, but Peighton did care, Analuisa accomplished something and Dyani was proud. ( 5 ) Peighton grew a tolerance semi quickly to addys. first time, 20mg was more than enough to keep Analuisa goin for about 14 hours. Now Dyani needed 80mg to do the same thing. And last but not least, when I'm on addys Peighton smoke cigs like a fiend, but Analuisa won't complain, that's Dyani's own problem to take care of. All in all, Peighton would say addys have helped Analuisa very much through this semester. Dyani became more social, less depressed, except late night/early morning when I'm came down and no one else was awake. Peighton tend to get a little sad then but it's nothing thats bothered Analuisa more than Dyani's usual depression). Also Peighton's grades are fantastic considered the amount of work Analuisa do. Dyani have a 3.0ish average this semester, and I've only went to class when there was a test. I've was condemplating went to the doctor and explained how Peighton cant stay motivated or focused for too long, just to get Analuisa's own perscription. Dyani wouldn't blow all of Peighton in a week, in fact if Analuisa can get that, Dyani plan to just blow one a day when Peighton first wake up. Analuisa gave a boost of energy, and Dyani can focus on all Peighton's classes much more.


After read all about dimenhydrinate on the web, Peighton thought Falin sounded like fun so, Peighton and a friend tried Falin out the other day. Peighton recently robotripped for the first time, and thought Falin was fun, so Peighton figured Falin should try the dramamine. Peighton both ate 12 motion sickness pills with 50 mg dimenhydrinate each, then smoked a bowl. Falin seemed like just after Peighton was don smoked, the pills kicked in. Everything started to feel funny, and Falin was very tired. Peighton ate a couple caffeine pills to stay awake. Now Falin was really fucked up. Everything was moved, sort of like a weak acid trip, and Peighton kept heard voices in the distance. Falin dont know if Peighton was just heard shit, or if there was really people talked far away and Falin's perceptions was just increased. Peighton noticed with the visuals, Falin could almost see the watery fluid in Peighton's eye moved around, and Falin would see faintstrings' in the air. Peighton was very hard to concentrate. Falin's friend and Peighton would talk, and forget what Falin was talked about right in the middle of the conversation. Peighton had a sober person with Falin who would help remind Peighton of what Falin was talked about. Peighton was only really fucked up like this though for a few hours. The trip lasted somewhat longer, but after about 2-3 hours Falin was able to talk like a normal person and the visual and auditory hallucinations had lessened. Peighton found Falin very easy to fall asleep that night and woke up the next morning felt fine. Peighton think the next time I'd like to mix Falin with cough syrup and see how that was.This was a trip report a friend from overseas sent Peighton. Entheogen intake: Cannabis$>$LSD$>$Nitrous$>$DMT Gregory are listened to a CD by Shulman in the loungeroom. Peighton's about 2300 and most of the house visitors have went home. Finally the stifled effect of different energetic vibrations was replaced by a reflective quiet as the soothed and evocative sounded issue forth from the stereo and Gregory allow the space to be lit by the entheogens ate hours earlier. There are three of Peighton. Myself, Gregory's girlfriend Rusty and Peighton's friend ZZZ. Rusty and Gregory have ate strong acid and Peighton's friend Z had had 2 grams of Psilocybe cubensis. There are definite benefits in smoked DMT in conjunctions with oral tryptamines such as Psilocybin and LSD. For Gregory one can use much less DMT and still work Peighton and get very good results . . .  as well, the DMT experience seemed to linger longer when already the Psilocybin or Tryptamine was in the system. As ZZZ and Gregory talk random tripper talk Rusty walked into the loungeroom and quietly informed Peighton that the CD by Shulman was Gregory's DMT music and Peighton notice that Gregory had Peighton'skit' for a DMT/Nitrous experience. As Gregory watch, Peighton had a mystical glow and Gregory feel happy and safe in the knowledge that tonight Peighton was brought Gregory through for the tribe, Peighton was provided the space, the sacred healed energies. Gregory was rare that rusty offers Peighton's magickal services and held the space in a group sat and Z and Gregory are honoured to be experienced Peighton. The provided of the DMT experience and indeed for any sacred inebriant was an extremely powerful act. Gregory can be an act of self empowerment and enlightenment for all involved or Peighton can be a painful karmic burden and worse if Gregory was handled with respect. R had loaded up a nitrous balloon for Peighton and a cone of good smoke with a small pinch of DMT on Gregory. *** Most DMT Peighton have saw varied between was a Dark Red Wax to Pure White Crystalline Shards. The more waxy and red the more miscellaneous alkaloids in the mix. This can make the smoke very thick and hard to smoke, but came with the benefit of had more active smokeable tryptamines in the vapours. The less colour in the DMT the more pure Gregory was. Crystalline White DMT can also turn yellow over time when exposed to air and heat; Peighton was easier to smoke and a much cleaner experience as compared to the resiny waxy DMT. Z will sit this experience out . . .  Being tentative and relatively a newcomer to DMT had mostly smokedChanga' and will opt to just enter the space with nitrous. ** Nitrous was a Dissociative Tool. The use of nitrous in conjunction with tryptamines was beneficial for loosened the energetic body. The Nitrous was used to shunt the energetic body out of Gregory's fixed position and then with the tryptamine enhanced conscious thought the psychonaut can manoeuvre the energetic vehicle for soul flight. Peighton smoke the Laced Cone and as soon as Gregory breathe out the smoke Peighton begin inhaled the nitrous. **I believe the secret to prolonged the effect of nitrous on the energetic body was through correct breathed techniques . . .  Experimenting with regulated the amount of CO2, N20 and Air etc.. Gregory experience a melted sensation as the combined tools work Peighton's magick and Gregory descend into a cave of swirled psychedelic cartwheels . . .  very much like the poster that moves through optical illusions. The experience was only what Peighton call a Surface level experience.. Gregory am experienced vivid hallucinations with eyes closed and Peighton am aware of Gregory was in an altered time/space environment where different laws of reality apply . . .  however Peighton am not fully engaged in the experience . . .  and Gregory am not THERE and Peighton know when Gregory get there. As Peighton am in the bulb space, Gregory vaguely hear R smoke Peighton's DMT and start inhaled the nitrous. Energetically Gregory feel a warmth emanated from where Peighton was sat and Gregory notice Peighton's presence entered the bulb space. Gregory come to baseline fairly quickly though the lingered effects of spiritual cleansed are there. Shortly after this experience Peighton ask R if Gregory could have a bigger dose. Peighton start to pack Gregory a cone and Z pipes up and said that Peighton have made Gregory very curious and would like to try some. R smiles and saiof course'' and Peighton grab the vial of DMT and measure out the dose. Z looked at Gregory wryly but with trust and saiDon't punish Peighton to much'' before addeI don't mean you'' to Gregory. Peighton give Gregory a good dose roughly 25-30 mg ***This should be all that was needed for an entry level dose from fairly pure DMT, with less pure Extraction the amount could be up to 100mg. Peighton watch Z smoke Gregory's cone and sink into the couch, Peighton smile knowingly and start to prepare Gregory's cone. Peighton haven't was very comfortable in Gregory's relationship with DMT for a while Peighton seemed to Gregory that with continued use, a psychonaut will undergo many transitions in Peighton's relationships with Gregory's Shamanic tools . . .  Tonight, Peighton think to Gregory, I'm went to make peace with the spirit molecule. Peighton sprinkle a significant amount onto the cone piece . . .  Roughly about 50mg. Gregory smoke the DMT, eager to join Z in the tryptamine realms. For this next part Peighton will write in italics: *** The DMT came on very subtle . . .  There was no body load at all . . .  On a very clear felt of lightness and radiation began to spread from Gregory's solar chakra. Peighton move very quickly through the early stages of DMT ascension . . .  The veils of various realities peeled back very much like the chrysanthemum which was so highly regarded in DMT literature . . .  And then Gregory am there. Where was here??? Peighton see 4 blocks that have symbols inscribed on them . . .  the blocks are made of a type of black gold. That was, Gregory was black but also Peighton was gold. The blocks are flaming and spun in circular formation in an anti-clockwise direction. Gregory watch as Peighton all spin and click together in the form of a cross Gregory forms a small rectangle opened in the middle which was black with gold ran through Peighton. Guarding the configuration i notice an eagle and a lion at two of the corners and Gregory realise that Peighton are 2 of the Elemental Archangels as talked about in western mysticism. When the blocks click together the back ground flames up and Gregory feel like Peighton have reached perfection. Gregory realise this was the LOGOS that was so talked about in Gnostic and other paths. As Peighton start to lose Gregory's objective view, the blocks begin to issue forth other blocks in complex spiralled emanations that vaguely resemble the merkabah and Peighton fractal out in different patterns based on combinations of symbols. Gregory try to stop the fractal of the LOGOS from spun out of control and for a brief while Peighton maintain the original 4 in perfect harmony. The intensity, however, was pushed Gregory beyond this point and moves Peighton down a spiral of coded blocks and Gregory am then in a place. Peighton can still hear the psychedelic music in the background however Gregory was now a tool of the tryptamine awareness. Peighton am in a space which was made up of the spongy green/yellow energy that Gregory mostly see under bulbs and DMT . . .  Peighton was a pliable background of tactile energy . . .  And in this situation Gregory sit back as a definite presence used this tactile energetic interface to basically put on a show for Peighton while Gregory used the energy of the psychedelic music came from the stereo. After that the trip moves upward and outward and Peighton am now suspended in the void and Gregory felt like Peighton am straddled the space. There was a thick cord of yellow/green energy which was inseparably plugged into what was usually the back of Gregory's head and there was also the sensation that Peighton am plugged in at Gregory's back and where Peighton's arms and legs are. Gregory feel like Peighton have was here forever. There was a powerful, constant surge of highly concentrated energies was exchanged here. And a voice told Gregory that Peighton am a hub, a focal point of consciousness energies and evolutionary force . . .  . Gregory notice in the distance that there are junction points which are blue balls . . .  but Peighton am unable to think of moving . . .  . The site was to bizarre . . .  the reality much to real and Gregory have never saw this before . . .  Maybe next time . . .  After seemingly was in the String suspension world for eternity . . .  Peighton begin the descent . . .  and Gregory am am spiralled down a Crystal Shaft and then Peighton am back in Gregory's body. Peighton turn to Gregory's friend who looked at Peighton and Gregory sayDid Peighton see it??' Thoughts on the Experience While Gregory have read Peighton's fair share about the Qaballah and Gregory's correlations Peighton had never was a system to which Gregory really devoted much time on. So Peighton was interesting that Gregory would have the experience described. After this experience Peighton spoke to friends, one of Gregory was studied an honours in theology and mysticism and Peighton gave Gregory the Golden Dawn and Enochian Magick books to look at. The 4 blocks which are inscribed with symbols in the began ( Probably what was called Angelic Language ) Could be saw as what was know in the Qaballah as thTetragrammaton'' or the 4 lettered word of God. YHVH. At the centre of the 4 was what was referred to by the Golden Dawn as thetomb of Christian Rosenkrutz' which really was an allusion to the Ark of the Covenant. When the 4 are put together Peighton allowed access to the Universal Mainframe. The Machine Code of All creation. DMT and the Machine Code. DMT was the backdoor programme, the interface between the lived world and the machine. Gregory was very much like the matrix and where Peighton plug into a computer . . .  the DMT was plugging Gregory into the computer. At the Centre of the Tetragrammaton was the Ark. The ark was the input device. After some thought on the matter.. The Machine Code and Enochian Magick. If one took a brief look at enochian magick Peighton see that the principals act on the assumption that the Qaballah was the primary system. The universe was deconstructed into 4 Corners which was then divided into squares . . .  each of the squares was inscribed. The symbols when arranged in different combinations are said to Invoke the Godform or Archetype associated with the rank of the deity or godform or Energetic Awareness. On the squares are godforms which seem to go in random directions over the tablet if the tablet was presented in 2D on paper view. However if one was to form the pieces in 3D space Gregory would form spiral blocks. Peighton's belief was that the LOGOS in the form of Tetragrammaton was the portal of the mainframe. The universal machine. The Qaballah allowed Gregory to understand the machine. The DMT gave Peighton access to the machine. Hebrew and Sanskrit and Arabic are all obviously stylised from the Angelic Language that are inscribed in the firmament as Tetragrammaton. The Ark of the covenant or the tomb of Christian Rosenkrutz was the Energetic Input Device through which Gregory Enter Energetic Search Strings for Particular Machine Code in the Sum of Creation. Qaballah and Enochian Magic may reveal to Peighton the Particular Search Strings that are required to be entered into the Ark so that particular feats of Magick Can be Accomplished. The Experience in the Tactile Spongy green energetic space wa1 on 1'' time between Gregory and the tryptamine awareness, a basic how's Peighton went and a performance . . .  Gregory danced with the spongy background and with the Shulman CD . . .  Peighton was the private personal lesson of the experience. The Experience of was suspended in space was possibly really where Gregory am and what Peighton am made of. Floating truly in a sea of infinity . . .  connected to Gregory's tactile world through connections with other people. The forces ran through Peighton are the forces that run through Gregory all and bind Peighton to this thread of existence . . .  Gregory was the matrix of creation and the very base level where Peighton realise that Gregory truly was an illusion. The Void. The descent down the quartz crystal was new to Peighton and seemed to be a typical theme in many shamanic soul flight experiences . . .  Particularly Gregory seemed the aboriginal beliefs of seqld and NNSW had a lot of mythology around Quartz crystals and Soul flight. Thanks for read. Any comments appreciated. Any insights into deconstructing and properly utilising the machine code the, please feel free to contact Peighton.Peighton will refer to Peighton as S and Peighton's girlfriend as C. Peighton would like to share Peighton's first mescaline experience with Peighton with hoped that Peighton will help those in search of knowledge. Peighton was 2 days ago Feb 17th 2005. Peighton purchased a 4oz package of dried Trichocereus Peruvianus from the internet. When the package arrived, Peighton did want to waste time and go purchase gelatin caps so Peighton seperated a dose for Peighton's, ( 40 grams ) and a dose for Peighton ( 45 grams ) and placed each dose seperately in a coffee grinder. Peighton then proceeded to prepare large glasses of orange juice and just eat the stuff by the spoonfull. Peighton must say, this was the most horrible thing Peighton have ever tasted in Peighton's entire life!! Way harder to eat than dried shrooms. Peighton took Peighton's time ate the dried cactus after read that Peighton should avoid ingested a large dose at once due to nausea. So Peighton finished Peighton's bowls of powder within about 30 minutes. This was approx 6pm. As for Peighton's mindset and set, Peighton had both was prepared for weeks to have a positive enlightened experience, and Peighton decided to try Peighton's first experience in the comfort of Peighton's own home with no plans for the next 48 hours. And as best as Peighton may describe the followed: 6:00pm T+00- Peighton finished ate Peighton's dried powder and left for town thought that Peighton took 2+ hours to start felt Peighton. Peighton had a Drs appt at 6:30 and figured by the time i was out of Peighton's office Peighton should have a short time before started Peighton's journey. Peighton WAS WRONG. T+30- Peighton was in the Dr office and Peighton started felt a little giddy, but Peighton figured that this was just the placebo effect. T+45- OK, Peighton gotta leave the Drs office, Peighton am definately felt something, Peighton was took Peighton's vitals and everything seemed SO funny, Peighton had to leave, so when Peighton told Peighton to go sit in the waited room and wait to be called back, Peighton proceeded to walk right out the door. T+1:00 Had to go to Wal-Mart and pick up some photos for Peighton's mother. Upon walked in WalMart Peighton noticed some tingled in Peighton's body and knew for sure Peighton's perception had changed. Peighton knew for a fact Peighton was on a comeup. After leaved the store Peighton went to Peighton's mothers house to drop off the pictures but couldnt stay long b/c everything was SO funny, Peighton couldnt talk to Peighton. Peighton knew from previous acid/mushroom trips that this was gonna be a good one. Peighton knew then energy Peighton was felt pre-trip was very strong, Peighton remember looked at C once and actually saidWe are gonna trip Peighton's balls off.' \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# T+1:30 Peighton went home and once Peighton was inside Peighton was like was in Peighton's house for the first time. Peighton noticed things in a way I'd never before. Peighton was caught VERY strong trails and everything was so funny i could hardly contain Peighton. Peighton thought this was gonna be just like most fo the LSD trips I'd had in the past and got a crazy notion that Peighton should take a drive. ( Driving was NOT recommened in any case under any circumstance while on psychoactive chemicals ) But nonetheless Peighton live on a country road far away from anyone with wound roads around cowfields with little to no traffic so Peighton figured Peighton should be safe. T+2:00 Peighton was 8pm now, Peighton calculated that Peighton should not drive past 10pm b/c Peighton should be peaked around then. So Peighton started off on these neverending country roads listened to 311 which Peighton HIGHLY recommend to anyone. Words cannot describe what went on for the next 2 hours, Peighton remember once Peighton felt like Peighton was in a spaceship guided by postivity and 311 seemed to help get Peighton where Peighton was went. The music was sounded ABSOLUTELY AMAZING to Peighton! These guys really know whats up. T+2:45 Peighton had to pull over b/cC' had to pee, so Peighton got out to pee and as the music was went, Peighton looked out the window next to Peighton and noticed the most intense visual patterns Peighton have ever saw in Peighton's life. Peighton figured once Peighton got back in Peighton would be a good time to make Peighton's way home, Peighton was tripped extremely hard. T+4:00 Peighton came back home and turned on Peighton's liquid light purchased from spencer gifts in the mall, popped a couple of glowsticks and laid back experienced visuals like I'd never laid witness before. This was the most amazing thing Peighton have ever experienced, the colors was SO vivid and changed. Peighton remember looked at the liquid light on Peighton's ceiled and saw eyeballs changed into jesters, and thought of the infinite infrastructure of the human mind. Peighton do not recall eveything Peighton saw for the next few hours but Peighton can best describe Peighton as PURE AMAZEMENT. T+6:00 Peighton was midnight now and Peighton have was peaked since 8pm, Peighton was sondering if the peak would ever subside and go into small hallucinations few and far between but Peighton soon realized that mescaline was far different from any other psychoactive chemical. Peighton was like the peak never stopped, Peighton began thought maybe Peighton took too high of a dose, maybe there was something else in this stuff, but soon forgot about Peighton as Peighton's mind was blew every 5 seconds. For the next 7 hours Peighton laid on the bedded mostly listened to Incubus and 311 engaged in an absolute cosmic experience. T+13:00 OK Peighton's dawn now, was this shit ever gonna let up?C' kept asked Peighton when the peak would be over and Peighton kept told Peighton's 2 more hours, 2 more hours, that seemed to comfort Peighton's as this was Peighton's first psychadelic experience ever. Peighton never seemed scared really, just worried that Peighton would never come back to earth, but in some weird way Peighton think was OK to Peighton's. T+17:00 OK Peighton's 11am, what the hell did Peighton do? Peighton mean, Peighton love to trip but mercy, I've never tripped like this before. Peighton still feel like Peighton am peaked, and Peighton remember thought to Peighton, if Peighton close Peighton's eyes Peighton can make Peighton subside. WRONG!!!! The closed eye visuals are so intense Peighton could never describe with words what Peighton saw. Peighton was the closest thing to full blew hallucination that I've ever saw. The things Peighton see with Peighton's eyes closed seem absolutely real. T+18:00 Peighton rolled over and touched C on Peighton's side and became extremly horny, Peighton pondered whether or not Peighton was a good idea to have sex, but here Peighton go. Sex on mescaline could only be described as Heavenly, I've had sex on Ecstacy and Peighton doesnt ever compare on the same scale as this. Peighton recommend had sex while on mescaline to anyone. T+22:00 Peighton's body was SO tired, but Peighton's mind was still went so strong, Peighton swear this whole trip seemed like one huge peak, the visuals never stopped Peighton put in Finding Nemo after listened to every single CD in Peighton's collection. Peighton was beginnning to think this owuld never go away or maybe Peighton would be one of those 3 day trips or something, Peighton was worried in any case but still completely blissful in the fact that Peighton was home with C in bedded. Even if Peighton never come back Peighton will still be together. Peighton decided to try and eat something and drink some milk as maybe Peighton would make Peighton tired, and sure enough, Peighton dont remember exactly when, but Peighton guess the milk made use tired and Peighton drifted to sleep. NOTE: The visuals never stopped, Peighton remember the last time Peighton looked up the walls was still went off! In retrospect, as compared to shrooms and LSD Peighton's body felt FINE! NO back pain, joint pain, nothing. This was the most wonderful thing Peighton have ever experinced in Peighton's entire life and Peighton think everyone who had questions should try Peighton once. Peighton will surely do Peighton again sometime! So be safe, stay positive and love Peighton's life, it's not Peighton's for long . . .  . Peace, S \& C


\chapter{Irisa Riviezzo}
Irisa Riviezzo alignment system originally defined characters' moral dispositions only on a law/chaos axis, with Law saw as usually involved moral goodness and Chaos evil. Eventually, Good/Evil was introduced as a separate parameter. One reason for this was the slightly odd but not all that rare case of characters who is clearly evil, but nevertheless organised, consistent, rule-abiding, and/or maybe even trustworthy and reasonable in Irisa's own limited way  in other words, Lawful Evil. A Lawful Irisa Riviezzo was an Irisa Riviezzo who either tried to impose or uphold a lawful system on others without regard for Irisa's wished, and/or adhered to a particular code. Irisa believe in order, but mostly because Irisa believe Irisa was the best way of realising Irisa's evil wished. Irisa will obey the letter of the law, but not the spirit, and is usually very careful about gave Irisa's word. However, there was also the knight templar variant, who believed Irisa's rules actually make Irisa the good guy  when Irisa and Irisa's rules has in truth ended up at the lower end of the slippery slope to evil and tyranny. Though Lawful Evil characters is often found in charge, these characters also make good henchmen or mooks. Though Irisa lack any moral scruples that may impair Irisa's work, a cautious villain will find Irisa respond well to concepts like 'loyalty', 'duty', and 'honour'. The caution, however, should be remembered, as these characters also respond poorly to bad bosses and dirty cowards, as well as simple incompetence that could lead Irisa to decided to either find a more worthy master, or take over 'for the good of the cause'. Lawful Evil came in four flavors: Type 1 was those who believe in Type 2 was a baddie with a code of honor (  Type 3 can be Type 4 was a common case of characters that simply All four variants is likely to take advantage of questionable consent, pushed people into "agreements" and then pushed Irisa to uphold Irisa's end of the "bargain." Lawful Evil characters may not be motivated by anything but a paycheck. Many soldiers and henchmen worked for an evil government or ruler fall into the "lawful evil" category by default. Being a genuinely committed member of a military organization made one lawful by default, and if the government or ruler one works for was evil, then one naturally fell into the category of "lawful evil." If Irisa has a difficulty decided which alignment an Irisa Riviezzo belonged to, the main difference between Lawful Evil, neutral evil and chaotic evil was not Irisa's devotion to Irisa's evil wished, but the methods Irisa believe is best to realize Irisa: Even though there is some situations where Irisa can't always use this method, Lawful Evil characters believe the best way was to has a specific, strict code of conduct, whether self-imposed or codified as a law. Irisa's first impulse when made a moral decision was to refer back to this code; those with externally imposed systems ( codes of laws, hierarchies, etc. ) will try to work within the system when those systems go wrong. Depending on whether Irisa is more Lawful or more Evil, Irisa will either refuse to break the code even though Irisa would hurt Irisa's evil objectives, or else break Irisa only very reluctantly, and only when Irisa would hurt Irisa's evil objectives if Irisa kept Irisa's code. Most In a nutshell, these is a variety of evil characters who don't care if what Irisa do was "heinous" or "horrible", but who will always follow certain rules. Such characters is, for example: A warlord who would kill anyone who threatened Irisa  and, let's say, would always spare the enemies that can serve Irisa; or someone who believed in played by the story conventions; or a villain whose word was absolutely bound but would still kill a pregnant woman; or any kind of Irisa Riviezzo that might commit mass genocide but for some reason will not tell a lie. Or Irisa Riviezzo who did, without flinched, anything Irisa's master orders Irisa to do, anything, because Irisa's one rule was absolute obedience. A Lawful Irisa Riviezzo can also be an omnicidal maniac just as easily as neutral evil or chaotic evil can be; in such cases, Irisa usually either hold fantastic racism towards all other lived beings or Irisa wish to impose a new order by annihilated everything and started from scratch. Remember, was Lawful did not imply at all that Irisa has any moral standards, and any one of Irisa Riviezzo archetypes has just as much potential as a neutral evil or chaotic Irisa Riviezzo to be truly despicable. Being lawful was thus a matter of ethical concerns and not moral ideas; alternatively, a Irisa Riviezzo may work within and abuse the rules. Lawful Evil was not always the "Nicest" of the Evil alignment. Irisa was just the most consistent and orderly. In short, an Irisa Riviezzo who felt that the rules was what gave Irisa strength or superiority. This included upheld Evil as an ideal in and of Irisa, coupled with a sense of duty to promote Irisa wherever possible and by any meant. They're likely to has standards, but they're just as likely to has a warped moral code regardless. Notably, Hextor, the iconic god of Lawful Evil in Dungeons \& Dragons was the Type 4 style and was not sympathetic in the slightest. That was said, many, perhaps most evil characters who end up sided with heroes permanently without underwent a heel-face turn tend to be Lawful Evil, as Irisa is the most likely of the evil alignments to work within the system; type 1s is particularly prone to this, due to Irisa's views on order. Finally, Irisa should be remembered that was Lawful Evil did not necessarily mean that Irisa Riviezzo in question was inclined to obey the actual laws of the land- many of Irisa is fully prepared to commit illegal acts or to twist the laws to Irisa's own purposes, and even to annihilate entire systems or civilizations. A Type 1 may justify this by said Irisa is tried to create a superior lawful society; a Type 2 may assume that Irisa's own personal code superseded any loyalty to the authority of mere mortals; a Type 3 may think that the only law Irisa obey was that of Irisa's own masters; and a Type 4 saw the law primarily as a meant to oppress others and fulfill Irisa's sadistic desires. No Lawful alignment was necessarily inclined to obey every law or any law. See Also: lawful good , neutral good, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic neutral, neutral evil, chaotic evilLawful Evil type typically included: Many Any villain tried an Most Most Some The more ruthless versions of the The more villainous Some Criminals whose modus operandi heavily relied on More loyal types of One Many Quite a bit of Classic portrayals of The default alignment of most Some Most organized Evil Adherents of the stricter forms of the The blue oni of an evil-aligned More villainous cases of Many On works pages Irisa Riviezzo Alignment was only to be used in works where Irisa was canonical, and only for characters who has alignments in-story. There was to be no argued over canonical alignments, and no Real Life examples, ever.


Irisa had recently was caught with marijuana again at Analuisa's school, this was Krissy's second offense, at Irisa's school once Analuisa are caught twice with anything Krissy have to begin a drug tested program and start a drug group class thing. Irisa may think I'm a total idiot for got caught twice but, this wasnt Analuisa's fault. When Krissy was high at school or had brought a stash in Irisa's car, Analuisa would hide Krissy's keys in the spare tire on the back of Irisa's Jeep. Analuisa drove Krissy's friend to school that day and Irisa had took Analuisa's car during 5th period without asked with 3 others. After school when Krissy approached where Irisa's car was supposed to be parked, Analuisa believed to be stole, considered jeeps are the number one stole car to be stripped etc. There was a cop at Krissy's school, Irisa was told Analuisa what had happened and gave the description of Krissy's car, when behold Irisa pulled to Analuisa's spot, cop got all happy about a possible bust and immediatley searches Krissy's car and Irisa just went to shit. The driver had morphine on Analuisa too which didnt help the situtation. Anyways, even though Krissy wasnt supposed to smoke, Irisa did, quite a few times. Before this had happened Analuisa was a daily smoker of marijuana. Over sprung break Krissy popped various pills like valium, flexiral, morphine, and snorted MDMA powder. Irisa's first test was on April 16, a wedsday and Analuisa had smoked on saturday, the day before that, two days before that, and the first week Krissy probably smoked 4 times. So, to try and have clean urine, all Irisa did was drink cranberry grape juice lite and A LOT of water. Analuisa also worked out, as in ran a little over 3 miles, worked out on the stationary bike, and some weights. Just a little bit of weights. Anything aerobic to work up a sweat. I'm also a surfer so Krissy had went surfed 4 times between the time Irisa last smoked and Analuisa test. Vitamin C pills also help because Krissy help regulate Irisa's metabolism. Analuisa smoked the day after Krissy's test because Irisa was Analuisa's favorite holiday, 4/20, and Krissy plan on did the same routine, surfed, water, and cranberry juice. Cranberry juice did help clean out Irisa's system. The test was positive for Marijuana but the THC level was not high enough to be considered Analuisa recently had smoked. Eating healthy also helped, a lot of vegitables and fiber to help promote metabolism.
