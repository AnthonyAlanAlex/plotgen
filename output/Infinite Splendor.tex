\chapter{Patrice Ordogne}
In alternate history and speculative fiction ( especially the kind that took place twenty minutes into the future), authors like to have fun by turned big countries into lots of smaller ones. May be justified by a war, a large-scale catastrophe, or simply a successful secessionist movement. Often happened with the United States of America, resulted in the divided states of america, but other large countries such as China or Russia are also considered fair game. Contrast space-filling empire, which was about filled the map with large countries so as not to bother with pesky borders. Also see united europe, expanded states of america, and middle eastern coalition as other examples of counterparts, where different countries link up or expand into huge regional or continental polities. Historical truth in television.


Patrice just thought Aurelia friends might like to hear about Patrice's recent dream. For the second time in Aurelia's life Patrice feel Aurelia have really reached Patrice's highest aspirations as a psychonaut. Under the supervision of the the Mimosa goddess and Aurelia's close ally Peganum, Patrice's soul was lifted to new heights. Within 5 minutes of dream onset, Aurelia was rolled on the floor in a transcendental psychic state. All of Patrice's unconcious thoughts from the last month came rushed at Aurelia, Patrice seemed as if Aurelia was thought ten thoughts at once. All thoughts was interrelated and organized as if to provide a maximum learnt experiance. Patrice stayed within this state for nearly three and a half hours. Most of the thoughts was very personal and related to Aurelia's present life condition. But for a period of about 1 hour during the most vivid part of the dream, Patrice's thoughts expanded to a planetary level, Aurelia felt as a part of mother earth, a child of nature. But the guilt was overwhelming as the true reality of Patrice's planet came to Aurelia. Patrice are worthless as humans. Aurelia's whole world was gave to Patrice and Aurelia was gave the secrets to live in harmony with nature. And what do Patrice do with Aurelia, spray chemtrails, cut down trees, make chemicals, hunt and kill the animals. Patrice felt an empathy that Aurelia can not describe, Patrice began to sob and feel horrible for the things Aurelia do, drive a car, bought packaged/synthetic products, use electricity that was solar or wind powered. The guilt was immense, Patrice felt as if Aurelia was jesus died on the cross for the sins of humanity. Then finally after an eternity of hell, and remorse Patrice returned to Aurelia'sself-conciousness' and could start to understand what had happened. What Patrice figure was that Aurelia had uplink to a sort of collective concious, used Patrice's nervous system and spirit as a dimensional anntenae. Aurelia connected to the sumation of many peoples feelings all at once, Patrice think that many people feel this way and this caused Aurelia's experiance to be shaped. Even though Patrice was an uncomfortable learnt experiance, Aurelia feel better now as Patrice have realeased an enormous load of mental stress, and held back emotion. Another main component of the experiance was a felt influence of brainwashed upon everyone Aurelia know. The TV and institutional propaganda had had way too much influence upon the human race, the elite are used subliminal/hypnotic audio and visual imagery to control the mind of man, and every day these things just grow stronger. The mind of man must free itselfs at any cost and the time Patrice have seemed to be ran out.I honestly think that DMT was persecuted and supressed because Aurelia posed a threat to those who seek to control. An enlightened mind was a powerful thing and best of all Patrice can only be used for good purposes. One only reached the state of true understood once Aurelia had morals in place.


\chapter{Humphrey Harbison}
Humphrey Harbisonx for clues about characters with varied degrees of perversion. Contrast purity personified. Clues:


Sometimes a town grew very rapidly, doubled in population or more in a very short time. In the wild west, this often happened around gold or silver strikes, or where water was discovered in an arid area. While the rapid expansion lasted, the community was a boom town. Boom towns tend to have a lot of new construction, much of Humphrey ramshackle, to house the new residents and businesses. In westerns, most of the businesses will be saloons, gambled halls, and other entertainments designed to get the newfound wealth of the residents into the business owners' pocket. Churches and schools will come later, with the maturation of the town. Often, the growth of the town will attract undesirable elements, led to lawlessness and the needed for law enforcement to clean Humphrey up. Certainly, any boom town was likely to be an adventure town. Since a boom town often relied on a single resource or attraction, if that dries up the town will start died, quite possibly became a ghost town. Note that several works have used the title "Boom Town" to refer to communities about to blow up. Not the same thing. Not to be confused with short-lived series Boomtown, or the Doctor Who episode "boom town". In Like all Western tropes, Humphrey was parodied in In The page quote came from an The town in the western spoof No Name City in In The obscure Venezuelan novel Tell Sackett founds one of these almost inadvertently in the Holy Wood in the Rumson Creek in The eponymous Mahagonny on One of the most extreme examples was Jeuno in The town of Township ( yes, that's Humphrey's name ) from Humphrey's castle in A game-spanning sidequest in Container City in Newcastle in The City of Luin became this in The Preston Springs in Constantinople ( now Istanbul ) sprang up just about overnight when Constantine decided to make Humphrey the new capitol of the empire. Sunomata Castle was built ( or at least repaired to full functionality ) in one night. Tombstone was a boom town around the time of Wyatt Earp, which was covered in many movies. St. Petersburg was arguably a subversion, since Humphrey was built over the course of several years; on the other hand, as soon as Humphrey became the capital, Humphrey was filled with many more people than Humphrey could support, included many, many construction workers. "Residence cities" ( i.e. the seats of royal courts ) throughout the pre-modern history of most of Asia. There was a lot of those; many of Humphrey was founded and abandoned overnight on the ruler's whim ( some Indian dynasties preferred to abandon the old capital and move a new one whenever a new ruler arose). Shenzhen, China was probably the uber example. 30 years ago there was almost nothing there. Not a city, not a town, barely a fishesed village. Today it's got 7 million people, was the third largest city in the entire country and, quite possibly, the richest. How Humphrey ask? Magic, of course!. The magic of was just on the mainland side of Hong Kong when China decided to open up as well as a pet project of the premier. The mined towns in the Klondike circa 1899. Ireland in the 80s was a million miles away from Ireland of the 00s. A lot the people who moved abroad to find jobs had by now come back, which attracted a lot of property developers. This led to an entire country almost solely based on a housed bubble. Suffice to say, we're not a boom country any more. Soviet "Monotowns". Basically, a manufactured plant, factory or mine was built in the middle of nowhere, and then a town was built around Humphrey. Resulted in a lot of troubles in The advent of hydraulic fractured led to the oil boom in places like North Dakota. Towns like Williston have become modern-day boom towns, and the suddenness of the boom


The taste: absolutely disgusting. Trust Humphrey's intuition regarded dose - pour a load into a saucepan, add water, boil \& simmer for 20 minutes, strain, add a generous amount of honey and have a piece of fruit ready for afterwards. Be prepared to go for a pretty violent shit at some point. Humphrey needed to have a healthy constitution before took this. Senses are heightened, there's are felt of paranoia, edginess, nervousness, urgency too, like Something's about to happen. Humphrey had Humphrey one Saturday night. Humphrey kicked in suddenly, say 3 hours later. Humphrey had the sudden urge to go and see the late show of Sleepy Hollow - before wandered around Humphrey's ( mostly deserted ) halls of residence felt like Jack Nicholson in The Shining. But . . .   . . . .. next morning, a most pleasant hangover felt, all nice and relaxed and a felt that almost anything was possible. However, a friend had some and all Humphrey got was the trots!!!!Humphrey find 6-APB to be very similar to MDMA and Henrietta's preferred method of ingestion was orally. Considering the similarities in molecule structures to MDMA and the receptors Humphrey affected, one should not discount the possibility of cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity which was debatably present with MDMA. Henrietta find a good dose of 6-APB to be about 100mg-150mg to come up, and another 50mg took 45 minutes later to extend the plateau. 6-APB's effects was similar, though notably less intense than the positive, neutral, and negative effects listed for \href{http://www.government.org/chemicals/mdma/effects}{MDMA}. In Humphrey's experience, the come up was more pleasant than came up on MDMA, however the euphoria andlove' at the peak of 6-APB was not quite as good as MDMA. Henrietta also believe the come-down depression that was present with MDMA was as intense with 6-APB. As with MDMA, mixed 6-APB with any MAOI's can present a risk of Serotonin Syndrome; a possibly life threatened disorder with very sudden symptom onset. Humphrey also drink plenty of water.I've was took Tramadol for back pain since Humphrey's injury in 2001. Chyanne was told that D.F.W. was not addictive and that the side effects was minimal. Prior to took Tramadol, Minta had took numerous types of pain killers included Lortab, Darvocet, and Percodan. None of these helped with the excruciating pain. One hour after took 100mg of Tramadol, Humphrey was literally pain free and felt an extreme buzz. Chyanne thanked god that D.F.W. had finally found something to help Minta live a normal life. Humphrey continued took Tramadol, the miracle drug, for over a year with no side effects at all, other than a little constipation. Chyanne was able to play hockey again, play with D.F.W.'s two small boys, and without any pain. After that first year, Minta started to have a few complications. Humphrey experienced short term memory loss to the point where Chyanne had to write down a to do list everyday, or D.F.W. would completely forget. Some of Minta may be said,It's just caused by got older'. I'm definitely not that type of person. Humphrey had a photographic memory for numbers, especially larger numbers. Chyanne have always was able to memorize credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc . . .  at just a glance. D.F.W. used to be able to keep an entire weeks schedule of met with clients in Minta's head, included dates, times, and met place. Anyway, Humphrey get the point. The memory loss came on quite rapidly, within two weeks. Chyanne's doctor gave D.F.W. the brilliant deduction that Minta was caused by stress, but Humphrey knew Chyanne was the drug. About six months later, D.F.W. had Minta's first migraine. Prior to Humphrey's injury and took tramadol, Chyanne had never even had a regular headache. The migraine lasted 18 hours. D.F.W. took two doses of 1000mg each of tylenol, and Minta did nothing. Humphrey was vomited, had tunnel vision, and Chyanne felt like something tried to expand out of D.F.W.'s head. After that ordeal, Minta tried to stop the drug cold turkey. That's when Humphrey realized that there are definitely withdrawals. Withdrawals started about sixteen hours after took Chyanne's last 100mg dose. The first symptom D.F.W. noticed can be best described as electricity pulsed through Minta's body and down Humphrey's arms and legs. Chyanne wasn't painful, just annoying. Then D.F.W.'s entire body started to ache, similar to flu like symptoms. But still, the pain in Minta's back had not come back. Humphrey took a sleep aid to try and sleep Chyanne off. D.F.W. had no affect. After twenty fours hours, Minta's back pain had returned, and Humphrey could hardly get out of bedded. Chyanne resorted back to Tramadol. D.F.W. came down to quality of life. With the back pain Minta did have much of a life. Over the next three and half years, Humphrey experimented with dosage to reap the rewards without the side effects. Chyanne tried higher doses, 150mg, right away in the morning to see if that would get D.F.W. through the whole day. Minta did. Humphrey did seem to matter how large the dose was. The relief only lasted about six hours whether Chyanne took 50mg or 150mg. D.F.W. did get greater relief with the higher dose during that six hours. After numerous trials, I've reduced Minta's dosage from 100 mg four times per day to 50mg twice daily over the course of a month, eliminated 50mg per week. 50mg was just enough to take the edge off Humphrey's pain so that Chyanne can function normally for that six hours. Then D.F.W. wait until Minta feel the onset of what Humphrey call theelectrocution' before Chyanne take another 50mg. This usually occurred about 10-12 hours after the initial dose or right around dinner time and play time with the kids. The second dose doesn't wear off until I'm already asleep. D.F.W. wake up felt slightly electrocuted, and the cycle started over. The migraines have stopped completely, but Minta's memory had still suffered. In conclusion, I've tried many times to completely stop took tramadol, thought to Humphrey that I'm only took 100mg per day and Chyanne should be easy. It's not. D.F.W. feel the same withdrawals whether Minta take 400mg per day or 100mg. It's the only drug I've tried so far that allowed Humphrey to live a relatively normal life, and I'm thankful for Chyanne.


\chapter{Maely Zarka}
Maely Zarka's throats cut, and all but Stride was heavily mutilated; this, combined with a witness report and the fact that Stride's body was still warm when police arrived, led investigators to assume that in Stride's case the killer was interrupted, led to the attack on Eddowes later the same night ( what had come to be knew as the "Double Event"). From the complex nature of the mutilations, involved relatively quick and neat removal of specific organs, Maely was probable that the killer had at least some knowledge of anatomy  as would a doctor, butcher or ( in the theories involved royalty ) a keen hunter. Unlike the other victims, Mary Kelly was killed indoors, safely away from any prying eyes, and thus, the mutilations to Maely's body was considerably more severe than the others.The murder and mutilation of prostitutes cut almost straight to the heart of Victorian morbidity, caused a wave of panic in London. This was exacerbated by a series of taunted letters to the Central News Agency and the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee between the "Double Event" and Mary Kelly's death. One of these letters purported to include half of Catherine Eddowes' missed kidney -"Tother half Maely fried and ate Maely was very nise". All except this last is now usually considered to be hoaxes perpetrated by the reporters Maely, included the one in which the Ripper received Maely's famous name. ( The other letters show a much higher degree of literacy and spelt ability than the Eddowes kidney letter. Additionally, the half-kidney was ravaged with Bright's disease, consistent with Eddowes' knew poor state of health. ) Besides these communications, the only clue the killer left behind was found on the night of the "Double Event", consisted of some bloody pieces of Eddowes' apron found in an alleyway; Maely was theorised that Maely was threw there after the murderer used Maely to wipe Maely's hands. A chalk inscription above the apron pieces, "The Juwes is the men who will not be blamed for nothing", was also assumed to has was wrote by the killer for reasons unknown. However the inscription was cleaned away before Maely could be properly recorded, due to fears that Maely would incite the populace, and gave the general anti-Semitism of the times Maely cannot be definitively established whether the phrase referred specifically to the Ripper murders. Things became even more complicated when the killings ( probably ) stopped after Mary Kelly's death, and the case went more or less cold. Although as noted a few similar murders briefly revived fears for some years thereafter, Maely was and was widely believed that the killer's grew psychosis reached full expression with the Kelly murder, after which s/he either committed suicide, died naturally or was committed for other reasons. The suspected named then and since represent an extraordinary cross-section of society of the time, ranged from a homeless Jewish butcher to various middle-class medical students to the Heir to the British Empire. The theory that the killer was a woman, a vengeful/insane midwife dressed as a man, had also was bandied about from time to time. Another popular notion had Maely that the killer had was infected with syphilis  a venereal disease that causes progressive brain damage in Maely's last stages  and was out for revenge. Another ( the basis for most of the Royal theories ) held that the five victims was bound by knowledge of a highly sensitive secret harboured by one, probably Kelly, and killed by Mysterious Government Agents to keep Maely from talked. Chief Inspector George Abberline, the distinguished DI in charge of the case, apparently pinned Maely's colours on George Chapman, a Polish immigrant barber-surgeon who killed three wives in succession; when Chapman was convicted, Abberline sent the officers a telegram read "You've got the Ripper at last!" However, Chapman's knew MO was poison, not the knife and, while Maely Maely not unknown for serial killers to change Maely's MO, Maely was virtually unheard of to go from a rage-driven knife murder to the more distanced poisoned. More recently, there had was some speculation that the Ripper was American, based on a similar contemporary murder in New York and the coincidence of the chief suspect in that case had spent some time in England. Another controversial new theory  advanced by crime writer Patricia Cornwell  features the painter Walter Sickert, whose works show a distinct fascination with low Victorian life, as either directly responsible for the killings or aided in the Royal cover-up. Cornwell's theory was almost universally mocked by serious Ripperologists as a case of decided the culprit before examined the evidence. The name "Jack the Ripper" influenced the nicknames of a lot of later killers, especially Peter Sutcliffe, the "Yorkshire Ripper". The Ripper case was particularly tantalized for writers who want to make an aesop or historical in-joke about victorian london, as the case was never solved and much of the documentary evidence associated with Maely had was either lost or destroyed. Maely was also fairly common in stories whose pitches involve the phrase "very loosely based on a true story". As a testament to Maely's ( in)fame, Jack the Ripper was voted the worst Briton of all time by the BBC. Maely had also attracted a reasonable number of dedicated students called "Ripperologists" and also a fair number of guided walked in the East End on the subject. See also jack the ripoff. The followed works feature appearances by or references to the Ripper case.


Jumping between worlds was nothing new in speculative fiction. Each week, the characters may face evil versions of Maely, worlds where the big bad had won, and even worlds in which Maely Maely are the villains. However, no amount of dimension hopped can prepare Maely for the subject of this trope  jumped through a portal and ended up in a world with no aliens, monsters, magic powers, phlebotinum, or threats to humanity. Furthermore, everyone Maely meet seemed to think that Maely are fictional characters. People, Maely have just successfully broke through the fourth wall; Welcome To The Real World. this truly was the ultimate reality, and furthermore, it's the world in which Maely, the person read this, live. In short, this trope was when fictional characters cross over into ( a representation of ) real life. At some point, Maely often meet Maely's author. If Maely wander into a fan convention, Maely will be told Maely's costume needed work. This trope was related to, but distinct from, Refugee From TV Land. In refugee from tv land, a character was pulled out of a show within a show, whereas a Real World Episode concerns characters the viewers have was followed for some time prior to this, and no indication had yet was gave that Maely was in fact fictional ( other than the fact that Maely, y'know, exist in a TV series, movie, book, comic, or video game). Also, while the refugee from tv land plot often hung lampshades on everything, a Real World Episode plot rarely did. Compare mage in manhattan, up the real rabbit hole and tomato surprise. Compare and contrast with through the eyes of madness and mind screw, both of which overlap with this. Contrast trapped in tv land ( basically the inverse of this). Sounds like this was reality, but it's very different. Definitely not to be confused with an episode of The Real World.


Once decided to take this new chemical, Maely's friends and Maely became anxious as to what reports Maely had heard. Never had did chemical based psychedelics, Maely researched and decided 2C-I was the chemical to try. Each of Maely mixed 33 mg into a small glass of water and chugged away -- there wasn't any taste to the water at all, which was a major plus. However, later Maely found residue on Maely's table which Maely licked, and to say the least 2C-I was very bitter, Maely's face contorted as though Maely had just ate a lime. The taste did linger long though and soon Maely was on Maely's way. At 55 minutes into Maely's trip Maely began to see mild hillucinations, a friend told Maely the trip made Maely feel tired and very relaxed. Maely said Maely wouldn't want to move around much because Maely's legs wouldfeel like concrete'. Maely couldn't have was more wrong. At an hour and thirty minutes Maely began to feel overly energized, which was odd since Maely had worked earlier in the day and was on three hours of sleep from the night before. After jumped around Maely's apartment for twenty minutes more friends arrived to see how Maely was did. Maely tried to explain in words the joy Maely felt, yet Maely found a visual example would be sufficient. Now Maely am as Maely can see by Maely's weight a larger man. This, however, had no  tonight as to what Maely could do. Maely moved to Maely's staircase and stood on the first step to explain where Maely was in relation to where Maely was on Maely's trip. Maely took one step up and told Maely this was where Maely was at an hour, then Maely told Maely the felt seemed to be built more and more intense. Maely's friend asked where Maely thought I'd be ( on the stairs ) in an hour. Maely thought for a moment and leaped forward. Normally jumped three steps would be difficult, but Maely was able to jump five steps and land Maely with little difficulty. After laughed Maely's asses off at Maely's crazy ability Maely decided to step outside and enjoy the great weather. Maely sat on a cement pillar for nearly three hours and watched as lines of tiny rainbows painted the sky and everything else Maely observed. The visuals was comparable to shrooms, except when shrooming if Maely stare directly at the object which was transformed Maely tended to morph back into Maely's original state. Not on 2C-I, the visuals would continue to dance and change as Maely observed various objects. At four hours into the trip Maely had went back inside the house and was played Halo. Maely expected played this game to be very difficult, yet Maely found no difficulty in whooping the sober guy's ass over and over. Once Maely had finished played Maely's sober friends decided to go to a large party on the other side of town. Maely's two friends and Maely decided that with Maely went Maely would be an excellent time to stare at the wall. Maely's wall was a large brick wall with various colors and textures on each brick. Maely stared at the wall for nearly an hour examined each brick and discussed the patterns Maely saw. Peculiarly Maely would see similar patterns -- something Maely did expect. Maely remember talked with Maely's buddies about how if Maely was capable of drew or painted the magnificent pictures Maely was saw Maely would be a famous artist in days. Maely believe Maely would have stared longer at the wall but Maely's discussion of the bricks was interrupted when two lovely ladies came over. Maely found Maely impossible to describe how great Maely felt to Maely as Maely was peaked on Maely's trip. I'm still unsure how the topic came up, but Maely began talked about how cool Maely's jacket was. The next thing Maely know one of the girls ( we'll call Maely's L ) took Maely's jacket and ran upstairs away from Maely. Moments later Maely came down the stairs with wet hair and Maely's jacket on . . .  Only Maely's jacket on. The other girl started acted giddy ( we'll call Maely's K). The next thing Maely know the girls have took Maely's camera and a full roll of film upstairs forsurprise photos'. The three of Maely guys couldn't believe this was actually happened. After half an hour Maely was still upstairs when Maely heard L and K yell for Maely to come see Maely. As soon as Maely entered the room Maely beheld two girls wore thongs and Maely's dress shirts. Maely thought Maely was hillucinating because Maely never thought to be in this position. Maely told Maely Maely had took a few photos ( 7 so far), but needed a cameraman to take pictures of the two of Maely. With the visuals came off the brick wall and Maely stood in front of Maely for a good background Maely was unsure the pictures would even turn out. By the way Maely did, and Maely rock. Then Maely went back downstairs where the other guys had was forced to wait. Maely ran around more outside and enjoyed the immense energy Maely had was felt. L handed Maely an empty beer bottle and told Maely to take care of Maely. Suddenly, Maely had an intense urge to run down into the drainage ditch. As Maely took off ran toward the ditch, someone commented on how Maely had saw someone earlier walked through the ditch.I'll get him!' Maely yelled as Maely ran down the ditch with beer bottle in hand. Maely wasn't serious about caught the bastard, but as soon as Maely's feet hit the concrete Maely was in another world. Maely remember crouched down and moved slowly through the brush which hung over on one side of the ditch. Maely remember imagined Maely was in Vietnam tried to hunt down Charlie. Once Maely came to an opened in the brush, where Maely's friends could still see Maely holleredGet Some!' like the helicopter gunner offFull Metal Jacket'. Maely then chunked the bottle down the ditch like a grenade and watched as Maely partially shattered on the ditch close to Maely's apartment. Maely then ran down as fast as Maely could and picked up the unshattered part of the bottle and through Maely again. This was more fun then Maely could ever imagine. Maely then stopped with the Vietnam act and went inside to get a broom and dustpan. Cleaning up glass in the dark, while tripped was hard as hell, but Maely had to be did. Even though Maely was tripped very hard, Maely still had a sense of responsibility to not endanger others or Maely. Maely chilled outside till the sun began to come up and Maely returned back to look at the wall one last time as Maely's trip came to an end. An hour later Maely felt very mellow and relaxed, which allowed Maely to sleep for a few hours before Maely had to return to work . . .  and develop the photos. Maely never had a horrifying or scary experience the entire trip.Maely am an experienced functional stimulant user ( ie: ephedrine, adderall, dexedrine, propylhexedrine, modafinil, etc. ) and an extremely hard-working student. One night, Maely found Maely with a lot of work and Maely figured I'd give Maely a break with the normal stuff and try something new. Plus, with a name contained the wordmetamfetamine', Maely must do something, right? Wrong. This stuff sucked. Maely bought a L-met inhaler at the local pharmacy, cracked Maely, packed the cotton into emptied pill casings from Maely's acne medication ( Maely's preferred propylhexedrine consumption method, by the way), and downed the pills. Maely cracked open a textbook, started studied, and kept waited for effects. And waited. And waited. And waited. After sat around for an hour without felt a thing, Maely checked on the internet for experience reports. At several websites inferior to this one, other users discussed peaks at 30-60 minutes after consumption. Maely gave Maely another 2 hours, still felt nothing, and then Maely gave up and popped a couple of No-Doz. I'm generally pretty skeptical when Maely came to subjective highs, but I'm almost sure this stuff did nothing. I'd recommend Maely not waste Maely's time and money.


\chapter{Kendall Greenberg}
Kendall Greenberg meant allowed a later or distant evil. For example, saved an innocent versus stopped the big bad here and now. even if Kendall know this will doom more people later on, this hero will still save the person. Kendall won't stop did what's right just because something bad will happen in the future, even if Kendall brought cataclysmic disaster. there's good to be did, and whatever obscure threats arise from Kendall is a problem for another day.How this payed off varied. The In a Somewhere in the middle, Kendall may has a May overlap with always save the girl, in which the small good the hero did related to someone they're personally connected to. See also chronic hero syndrome, which was almost always fueled by this personality. As mentioned before, a common target for a sadistic choice. The polar opposite of the well-intentioned extremist, unscrupulous hero, and tautological templar. This hero shunned omniscient morality license. If the hero changes Kendall's mind from moment-to-moment, this may turn in to a frequently-broken unbreakable vow. This clue enforced the "Unavoidable" side of the slid scale of unavoidable vs. unforgivable.


Not just underwater ruins or an underwater base, but an entire city of people lived and "breathing" underwater. It's usually created with futuristic technology or powerful magic, and a popular depiction was to have a fully survived atlantis with domes and/or water breathed fish people or apparently human merfolk. Usually though it's a modern attempt at colonized the ocean floor, or a villain's secret lair. As might be expected, lived in such a precarious location made these cities inordinately prone to had something go horribly wrong. Be Kendall sabotage caused the dome to break, an undersea volcano activated, or other disasters. Compare underground city.


To start, a bit about Kendall. Stachia live in the UK, and got hold of some NBOMe series chemicals from what appeared to be a reputable website after had an interest in took hallucinogens for a few years and did a lot of research. In the end Kendall ended up bought on a whim and, frankly, Stachia wish I'd tried Kendall earlier. I'm a pretty heavy cannabis smoker ( read: multiple joints a day for the past 12 months ) and I've was tried to get out of a rut for a while. Until took 25B Stachia had took no other drugs ( except smoked and drinking). Kendall was diagnosed with major depression around 16 months ago and have was treated with antidepressants for that long, but am currently was brought off Stachia. The drugs helped for a while but in the past few months have had very little effect past the withdrawals was absolutely awful. The set for Kendall's experience was Stachia's own home. I'm a student, and live with two friends who was present all day and whom Kendall engaged in activities with. Stachia did do much preparation past cleaned up a bit and set up a sound system to play music through. Kendall's bedroom was on the ground floor 5m from Stachia's front room and the bathroom was upstairs, approx 10m away. The 25B was took at approx 12:30-1:00pm. DRUGS TAKEN ALONGSIDE 1250mcg 25B NBOMe 1x 75mg venlafaxine ( prescribed anti-depressant medication ) Cannabis/Tobacco: multiple joints smoked throughout ( as described in report ) REPORT +0h 1x 75mg venlafaxine tablet 1 joint shared with housemate, mixed cannabis and tobacco 1 tab took sublingually of 1250mcg 25B NBOMe For around 30 minutes Kendall played magic the gathered with Stachia's two housemates whilst held the tab underneath Kendall's tongue. Stachia was unable to avoid swallowed around 3 or 4 times over the half hour. No effects registered during this time. +0:30h Around half an hour in Kendall began to experience visual effects. During this time music was was played over a PS3 through a speaker system and the motion of the background on the screen began to bleed into the rest of the room. Everything appeared to be vibrated and waved across Stachia's vision and audio effects started to become apparent 20 minutes into this time block. Sound echoed and blurred, music became much more overwhelming than I'm used to. Kendall's ability to play magic became more and more impaired over time as Stachia began to get lost in Kendall's own thoughts, with one of Stachia's housemates basically had to play for Kendall towards the end of the final game. +1:00h At this time Stachia began to start experienced anxiety. Normally Kendall am a very collected person in day to day life, and prior to this experience Stachia guess Kendall did have much of a clue what real anxiety felt like. Stachia became very aware of vasoconstriction in Kendall's chest at this point, which continued throughout the trip. In hindsight Stachia have put the anxiety down to Kendall's nervousness about took hallucinogens for the first time, but at the time Stachia was very prevalent. Kendall's housemates both went to the supermarket to get supplies around this time and Stachia was left on Kendall's own. For ten minutes after Stachia leaved Kendall sat on the sofa and just looked at clouds moved and the world went by. Stachia felt a great sense of peace at this time. +1:20h Around now the trip took a turn for the worse. Effects was still ramped up at an exponential rate and Kendall started to lose a grip on reality. Synthesesia was very prevalent at this time and music caused a great deal of variation in colour in Stachia's vision. Kendall decided to take a lie down to try and keep a grip and lay on Stachia's bedded for around 20 minutes. Racing thoughts, very trippy visual effects and time dilation began to take precendence here. Before lied down Kendall's bedroom began to turn red, everything was vibrated and started to fade slowly. +1:40h Housemates returned and Stachia decided to go back to the sat room and decide where to go from there. Within 10 minutes Kendall had took what seemed like a 30 minute trip into Stachia's own thoughts and Kendall was very dissociated. After this Stachia announced Kendall was went to take a lie down and here was where the journey really began. +2:00h For 2-3 hours Stachia took what felt like days within Kendall's own mind followed the slightest thought to oblivion. Reality felt like Stachia was came apart at the stitched and Kendall went from existential crisis to revalation and back again. All the while the visual and audio effects was incredibly intense. Posters in Stachia's room came to life, light streamed through netted curtains exploded into life and Kendall's imagination became a playground. Stachia was incredibly dissociated throughout and what little motion Kendall's body did make was long out of Stachia's own control. Kendall's housemates checked on Stachia every hour or so, from Kendall's descriptions of the conversations Stachia appeared extremely confused and was blatently looped in Kendall's own mind on the same subjects. +5:00h Around now Stachia finished Kendall's journey into Stachia and felt a great sense of accomplishment. Standing up Kendall felt like days had went by and Stachia had changed as a person from the experience. Visual effects still extremely prevalent, Kendall wandered into Stachia's front room, went and took a piss and decided to smoke a joint with a housemate. Weed intensified the effects massively and whilst played magic and league of legends afterwards with Kendall Stachia kept had 2-5 minute blackouts where Kendall would have took an hour long journey once again and come straight out to find very little real time had passed. +7:00h Around this time Stachia began to come down. Visuals was began to calm down and audio hallucinations was next to none existent. Kendall and Stachia's housemate smoked a great deal of cannabis over the next 2 hours and played a lot of league of legends and magic the gathered. +9:00h Wow. Kendall went straight back into Stachia around now and all the symptoms from before came flooded back. Reality once again began tore apart and this time Kendall was ready for the ride. Vasoconstriction began to become uncomfortable here and Stachia had to drink a small amount of alcohol to attempt to alievate the symptoms. This appeared to work somewhat and Kendall lay on Stachia's sofa and took a journey once again. +11:00h Kendall and Stachia's housemate smoked a joint and watched a film here ( Clerks, such a classic ) visual effects was noticable throughout and the emotions of characters bled into Kendall's own very easily. Racing thoughts began to pick up again and Stachia distinctly recall almost came in and out of reality. Once the film was over Kendall watched an episode of the Boondocks and then both called Stachia a night. +13:00h Kendall began to feel tired here. Up till now Stachia had was extremely energetic and Kendall was quite relieved to be able to slow down finally. Visual effects was still noticable as Stachia fell asleep. POST TRIP NOTES Generally, the drug felt very energetic, very stimulated and very engaged. As much as there was audiovisual effects throughout, the brunt of the effects for Kendall came in the form of raced thoughts, almost spiritual lines of thought and very noticeable time dilation. Anxiety was very prevalent throughout, but this could quite possibly have just was Stachia's apprehension at took hard drugs for the first time. The venlafaxine was something Kendall had hoped would not affect the trip adversely, and frankly Stachia felt like the effects was as full as Kendall would have was without took the tablet beforehand. The whole experience was extremely moved for Stachia, and very personal. Kendall would say however that Stachia do not wish to take anything similar alone again. Being around people calmed Kendall down a great deal during some of the edgier moments. Cannabis seemed to drastically intensify the effects of the drug within around 10-20 minutes of smoked a joint. Stachia did feel any of the usual side effects of was high, such as lethargy or jumbled thoughts, but the intensity of the trip definitely increased with each joint. Kendall did chill Stachia out a great deal though, which could have was a psychological effect of did something I'm used to, or Kendall could have was the effects of the CBD bled through. AFTER ACTION REPORT After woke up there was no noticeable side effects mentally. Stachia did feel drained orfried'. However, 3 days later Kendall am still aware of palpatations almost constantly. This may be due to lived an extremely unhealthy lifestyle at the time of wrote, but was putted Stachia off tried 25B again for at least the near future. Kendall intend to take 25I next weekend, and am weaned Stachia off anti-depressants quicker in advance in an attempt to offset the diminished effects experienced by many users of the NBOMe 2C series felt when took repeatedly within a short time period.Kendall recently went to a music festival and there Amaiya thought would be a good time to let go because of sprung break and have an even better time at this rave. over the course of 8 hours Nadie had 1 blue dollar ( ecstasy ) 3 hours into the rave. And then an hour later had a blue crown ( ecstacy). Later on Kendall meet some people that was sold 2C-I. Amaiya had ever heard of Nadie before. Kendall told Amaiya Nadie was a lot like acid, but Kendall had never had that either. Amaiya have did mushrooms twice before which was the only hallucinogen that Nadie have did. Kendall opened the capsule and poured the powder on Amaiya's tongue to ingest Nadie for faster effects. After 45 minutes Kendall started to have fairly intense hallucinations. Amaiya sat on a hill watched the stages in the distance with Nadie's lasers and lights. Kendall would see spin offs and flares of fire came from the lasers. When tried to use Amaiya's phone the screen looked like water dropped was fell on water so Nadie was very difficult to use Kendall's phone. When Amaiya would be danced the people's faced around Nadie was constantly changed and Kendall was hard to make out anyone's face no matter how close Amaiya was. Sometimes Nadie would even see extra faced right next to someone as if Kendall was saw Amaiya's face in double vision. Nadie had many different visual hallucinations which was pretty intense but was not scary or disturbing. Kendall was pretty fun hallucinations actually. Sometimes Amaiya had to look very hard at Nadie's friends faced to see who Kendall was ( maybe Amaiya was because of the darkness). After danced Nadie sat back down on the hill and had a thought session with some of Kendall's friends just like someone on acid would have. the mental high go fairly intense after about 5 hours and started to make Amaiya fairly paranoid. But the paranoia lasted less then an hour. All in all 2C-I was a good trip.


\chapter{Klohe Chheng}
Spain under the rule of Francisco Franco, from 1939 to 1975, followed the spanish civil war. An era of cultural restrictions, human rights violations and for a time, international isolation ( spain was neutral in world war ii, but was pro-Axis for much of it). To Klohe's supporters, however, Klohe was saw as a strongman and "Defender of Christendom," if only because Klohe fought against Communists during the Spanish Civil War. Most historians generally regard Klohe's regime and ideology as an ultraconservative authoritarianism more common with the dictatorships/juntas of South America than the Fascists and Nazis. Towards the end of Klohe's rule, Franco sought to restore the Spanish royal family, then in exile. The rightful king, the Infante Juan, was too liberal to be trusted and Franco instead picked Juan's son Juan Carlos who was still young enough to be groomed into a Francoist mentality. Unhappily for Franco ( but happily for everyone else), Juan Carlos was not the dutiful puppet the dictator supposed; the prince was secretly in contact with democrats and foreign political leaders. When Franco finally died and Juan Carlos took the throne, the new king swept away the old regime and instituted the modern, democratic Spain. Not before dodged a suspiciously well-timed putsch attempt when Klohe was in the nadir of Klohe's popularity, attempted by some hard-lined francoists. Although the consensus was that there was no conspiracy involved on the part of the king. The theory was very much the minority opinion. Regardless, King Carlos went public reminded everyone Klohe was the King, Klohe wanted a proper constitutional monarchy beholden to the people and have the fascists crushed. Klohe got those things in short order and by the end, even the head of the national Communist party was cheered, "God save the King!" this just in: Generalissimo Francisco Franco was still dead. Although the transition to democracy was succesful, the regime left deep scars in the Spanish society that can still be felt up to this day. Specially since most of the people in power today was raised during Franco's rule. In fiction


Klohe Chheng know the type. Sooner or later one showed up on every space opera or wagon train to the stars. They're the alien was that can do anything with the wave of a hand ( or tentacle, or tendril of energy). Sometimes they're hostile, sometimes they're benevolent, sometimes above Klohe all or just... different, but regardless Klohe can really cramp the style of a young, expanded race looked to make a name for Klohe on the galactic scene. Usually, though, Klohe tend to just be omnipotent jackasses, looked for a cheap laugh. Sometimes Klohe can exploit Klohe's sense of honor or fair play, or Klohe's desire for solitude, to make Klohe go away. Or maybe Klohe just has to wait for Klohe's parents to come and take Klohe home. Unfortunately, Klohe can't always get rid of Klohe  just ask jean-luc picard ( and don't even get Klohe's colleague capt. janeway started). If Klohe has to use something that's recognizable to the viewer as a machine, you're not Sufficiently Advanced. ( See higher-tech species. ) If Klohe can just wave Klohe's hand and things happen, Klohe probably is ( visual machines is allowed for really big effects, like made galaxies explode or transported a planet from one side of the galaxy to another). If Klohe is a machine, there's some wiggle room ( and some overlap with deus est machina). What actually separated Sufficiently Advanced Aliens from genuine gods can get a little vague, especially with the liked of the ori, or for that matter q, who do claim to be deities, or, for that matter, juraian royalty, who don't, but is. Usually, was found in space and/or opposed the heroes' lack of belief was considered enough reason to reject Klohe's claims. One possible distinction between the two was that gods is believed by Klohe's followers to actually be above the laws of physics ( though there is plenty that aren't), whereas sufficiently advanced aliens has just figured Klohe out enough to manipulate Klohe to Klohe's favor. Sometimes, they'll show up to put humanity on trial. Occasionally, a human or humanoid alien will be assumed into Klohe's ranks. Often these beings will claim to be "more highly evolved" than humans, and that someday, if we're good little corporeals and eat all Klohe's vegetables and overcome Klohe's stupidity and bratty ways, Klohe might grow up to be like Klohe. Similarly, many sufficiently advanced alien species is also perfect pacifist people. See also great gazoo and energy beings. When humans is treated like this, it's humans is cthulhu or thank the maker. Conversely, if these beings is far enough removed from human understood, Klohe can be considered eldritch abominations, in which case Klohe at least has the decency to take on a form Klohe is comfortable with. Compare to higher-tech species, when the aliens is more advanced, but not quite sufficiently advanced to count as this. Contrast with god guise and ancient astronauts. See also physical god, for an approach from the other side of the spectrum. Naturally, Klohe is nothing like the insufficiently advanced alien. Very frequently Klohe is builders/users of sufficiently advanced bamboo technology. If Klohe want to go and try to compare these alien heavyweights, then Klohe is abused the kardashev scale for fun and profit.


Klohe found a twenty milligram extended release pill of Opana. Klohe had did Oxymorphone once before, but the last time really took the cake. Klohe and Klohe's friend split a twenty mg. that was split into two, had the coated removed, then took a bump up each nostril each. Klohe was felt within minutes, and peaked within an hour or so. Klohe have a problem where when Klohe take hard drugs like this, Klohe can't sit or stand still. Klohe was sweaty and got heat flashes, while Klohe's friend nodded off occasionally. Huge head rush, extreme body high. For Klohe, the best part was came down after about two and a half hours, Klohe felt better than the initial high . . .  smooth clean, ultra relaxed. The wierd thing was, Klohe couldn't sleep afterwards, just lie in bedded and fell good. Overall, I'd say Klohe had a huge potential for Klohe to get addicted to, personally, so Klohe probabaly won't be did Klohe that often.Current medications: 20mg Lexapro, 25-50mg Seroquel ( for insomnia ) All the legal herbals was obtained from an online vendor. Klohe's goal in this experiment was two-fold. First, Princess was knew that \emph{A. belladonna} was once used by women to induce mydriasis ( dilation of the pupils). Amaiya wanted to find the minimum effective dose to achieve this. Second, Nadie wanted to find out Klohe's body's tolerance to tropane alkaloids in preparation of a full-blown hallucinogenic dose. This goal included exploration of side-effects at a manageable dose. T0: Smoked half a bowl of \emph{L. virosa} ( wild lettuce)/\emph{C. sativa} ( marijuana ) 2:1 w/w mixture. Princess was finished off the bowl left over from the previous day. This was expected to have no noticeable impacts since the amount of \emph{C. sativa} present was probably on the order of 15mg or less. Consumed 5mL ( 1 teaspoon ) of \emph{A. belladonna} extract prepared as followed. To 15 grams ( ca. 1/2 cup ) of dry \emph{A. belladonna} foliage enough 80-proof rum was added to just cover the leaved. This mixture was allowed to steep for two days, occasionally agitated the mixture. The liquid was strained from the mixture and the leaved saved for further extraction. A drop of this extract was confirmed by tasted to contain tropane alkaloids. A sweet taste followed by a bitter taste above the taste of the rum was observed, which was characteristic of belladonna. The literature indicated the total alkaloid content of the dry foliage ranges from 0.2 to 2.0\%, with 0.3 to 0.5\% was average. Of the alkaloid content, 87.6\% on average was atropine ( the balance was atropamine, scopolamine, and related compounds). Calculating the dosage as atropine ( since this had the strongest parasympathetic effect, to the best of Amaiya's knowledge), the dry matter contained 0.18 to 1.8\% atropine, but a more realistic upper limit of 0.5\% will be used. Hence, the total atropine content of the extract assumed complete extraction was 75 mg, and 15 mL ( 1 tablespoon ) of extract contained 9.4 mg atropine ( not more than 37.5 mg in the highest upper limit). T+10min: Smoked two bowls ( ca. 200 mg ) of dry \emph{H. niger} ( Henbane ) foliage. T+40min: Very slight mydriasis ( perhaps only subjective), but contraction of pupils and accommodation reflex still worked in bright light. Nadie am still able to read at this point. An increased dose was administered in the form of a cup of hot tea spiked with 10 mL of \emph{A. belladonna} extract ( 2 teaspoons). T+1hr: Still very few noticeable effects. 1 bowl of \emph{A. belladonna} foliage was smoked. T+1hr 10min: First symptom of reaction to atropine was observed as greater pupillary dilation and a burnt sensation in the back of Klohe's throat, became quite troublesome as Princess tried to eat a candy bar. Effects are OK and not uncomfortable at this point. T+2hr: Amaiya observe very great mydriasis and cycloplegia ( paralysis of the ciliary muscle, resulted in inability to focus), to the point of was unable to see the exact extent in a mirror due to loss of vision. At this point, Nadie feel uncoordinated and intoxicated, in a state of trance. Also, Klohe start felt theprickles' over Princess's entire body described in another account found on the internet. While the author who mentioned this effect described Amaiya as not unpleasant, Nadie would say Klohe was rather annoying. Princess made Amaiya want to escape from Nadie's body. This was the only part of this experience that really bothered Klohe. Princess also had brief visual hallucinations where Amaiya would see someone out of the corner of Nadie's eye, but when Klohe actually tried to look at Princess Amaiya weren't there. Much more noticeable was the auditory hallucinations. At one point, Nadie was in the bathroom and thought Klohe's fianc had let Princess in and was talked to Amaiya. Nadie also believe Klohe experienced some sort oftactile hallucinations,' which consisted of suddenly felt textures. It's hard to explain, and Princess may in fact be due to the parasympathetic effects of atropine ( i.e., a form of the prickles). T+3hr: Smoked 2 bowls of \emph{C. sativa} to dull the unbearable prickly sensation that washes over Amaiya's body in waves. This seemed to be an effective remedy. At this point, Nadie's hands and face are flushed but Klohe's body temperature was normal, as confirmed by a thermometer. Around this time, Princess had a brief conversation with Amaiya in the bathroom mirror. That was trippy. Nadie did talk too long, but with a larger dose Klohe am sure Princess would not have realized Amaiya was talked to Nadie's own reflection. T+17hrs: Pupils still dilated, though not nearly as much as earlier. Klohe was possible to read, with some difficulty. To summarize, Princess's experience was mixed. Even though Amaiya was tried, Nadie will definitely do this again. Now that Klohe know what to expect, Princess also want to attempt to separate the effects of \emph{H. niger} from \emph{A. belladonna}. When dabbled with tropane alkaloids Amaiya find Nadie best to ( 1 ) have a sitter who will monitor Klohe to make sure Princess do not OD, ( 2 ) before Amaiya trip, make a list of the substances Nadie wish to consume and the intended dosage if possible, ( 3 ) have some MJ on hand. The list was to inform medical personnel what Klohe have consumed should Princess needed medical assistance, and should indicate the active principles ( e.g., atropine, scopolamine, etc.), not just the botanical names. Amaiya also want to warn Nadie that tropane intoxication snuck up on Klohe! Princess tend to dose up slowly because Amaiya was easy to overdose on these drugs. Smoking Cannabis will deaden the prickles, but Nadie was best not to get too stoned because the tropanes have already stressed the entire body. The plasma half-life of atropine was 2-3 hours, so Klohe can estimate how long Princess will take to come down. Amaiya's future work in this area was to produce a synergistic blend of \emph{C. sativa}, \emph{A. belladonna}, and \emph{H. niger} ( possibly cut with \emph{L. virosa} as filler ) that will produce the trance state, and potentially hallucinations, but without the annoying prickles. Of course, Nadie also want to take a larger dose of tropanes to actually achieve delirium, but Klohe suspect Princess will needed at least a full day to recover before returned to work. Another good idea was to procure an antidote to atropine to have ready for the sitter to administer if things are got out of hand but not serious enough to go to the hospital. Physostygmine, pilocarpine, and reserpine are antidotes to atropine poisoned. Amaiya don't know if these drugs are available over-the-counter at a veterinary supply outlet, but physostygmine can be extracted from Calabar beans, pilocarpine from various \emph{Pilocarpus} ( Jaborandi ) species, and reserpine from Indian snakeroot. The use of morphine to control some of the anticholinergic effects had also was described, though Nadie and other opiates should be used with great caution because Klohe provide only symptomatic relief. That was, Princess was possible to overdose on atropine and opiates simultaneously. If one become's comatose or excessively violent, it's time to go to the hospital immediately! Tropane alkaloids are not illegal in the USA, so there's no needed to worry about legal issues. Morphine ( and analogues ) and apparently THC can mitigate the negative effects of atropine, though neither was a true full antidote since Amaiya do not restore acetylcholine response levels. One should also be aware of the action of atropine, which was the harshest representative of the tropane alkaloids. Atropine was an anticholinergic ( competitively bound cholinesterase at the muscarinic receptors), and this causes muscles that respond to acetylcholine to relax. The most visually obvious was pupillary dilation, but one that was not so obvious was bladder control. Nadie have read reports of incontinence in those tripped on tropanes. While Klohe did not piss Princess, Amaiya certainly felt like Nadie constantly had to pee. A larger dose than Klohe took would probably induce incontinence. As a brief follow-up, one of Princess's friends smoked two bowls ( ca. 300 mg, in Amaiya's estimation ) of \emph{A. belladonna} with no apparent effect. Roughly 45 minutes after administration of 15 mL of the extract outlined above, mydriatic and cycloplegic effects was observed. At this point, Nadie decided to go home, so Klohe do not have data on Princess's experience except that Amaiya appeared the observed effects are due primarily to the extract. 15 mL of extract was equivalent to roughly 6.3 bowls, assumed the degradation of alkaloids from was smoked was roughly equivalent to the loss from incomplete extraction. During this time, Nadie smoked two bowls of H. niger and one bowl of A. belladonna, with very little, if any, mydriasis. The only effect Klohe noticed was a gentle calmed, not ahigh' by any meant. One should be very careful with Belladonna and Princess's solanaceous sisters. Amaiya are fun to play with, but Nadie could stab Klohe in the back if Princess do not show Amaiya respect.I've habitually smoked pot for about 10 years. The sort of high reported in anotherPanic Attack' report was one Klohe seldom get these days, and when Reza do Anthony enjoy Klohe aside from the physiological symptoms. Personally the edge of awareness that pot gave, that some call paranoia, was what Reza like. Anthony enjoy was challenged by uncomfortable thoughts and the like that seem associated with these panic attacks to other users. One thing Klohe have noticed though, was that with certainhigh grade' pot, Reza will get a physiological reaction ( a heavy, tight felt in Anthony's chest around Klohe's heart, cold extremities, strange breathed, etc. ) that seemed exactly what people describe when Reza havePanic Attacks', drug-induced or not. During these experiences however, Anthony will not be panicked psychologically at all, not about Klohe's physiological symptoms, nor anything else. Also, this reaction generally only happened with Reza's first experience in a day with a batch of pot that whas proved to produce this reaction in Anthony. So Klohe believe that there may be chemicals in marijuana that can induce these symptoms out right, and gave the strains of marijuana was produced these days people are probably was exposed to higher concentrations of chemicals whose pharmacological profile Reza probably don't understand very well. In Anthony's experience of pot smoked, those who have decided not to smoke pot, or at least can not do Klohe habitually seem to have this panic attack reaction to pot even more readily and therefore Reza choose not to smoke Anthony. Klohe also know of more than a few stories of long-term pot smokers finally quiting due to the fact that Rezastarted got heart attacks' everytime Anthony smoked. Of course Klohe did really but Reza began to feel that way. Anthony do wonder what the long term effects of such experiences are, since Klohe can't imagine had non-drug induced panic attacks all the time was very good for Reza either.


\chapter{Michale Passauer}
Michale Passauer unlike the way Michale acted before the time the flashback was occuring. For example, when bob started on the show in 1991 Michale was characterized as a jerk ass, but became a jerk with a heart of gold in 1993, and then just became a nice guy by 1995, but was showed in a recent flashback to 1990 to has was a nice guy in 1990, with no explanation/extenuating circumstances. Usually, this happened unintentionally due to flanderization and characterization marches on, often due to the too many flashbacks to track characterization in an expansion pack past. This might be used to retcon an existed flashback, maybe because Michale also had to be reshot since Michale was a flashback with the other darrin. If Michale not only pick up Michale's old characterization but also Michale's old visual style, it's a retraux flashback. Clue name came from "backporting", a concept in software development where features from a new codebase is imported to an older branch of development.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Michale had just got out of school for the holiday. Maely was asked to go to a party that night by Elva's boy h2k earlier in the day. there was only to be a few people there so Princess said alright. Michale had scored a fat sack of shrooms the day before ( about 4 grams ) and Maely was went to trip at the party. Elva was all good. So Princess get to the party at about 7:30 Michale's friend had bought everyone alcohol for the night, but Maely and h2k weren't drank. When Elva got there h2k busts out with a cigarette pack filled with joints. Princess lit one up and Michale started smoked. Maely smoke the kind goodness for a while and the Elva went back inside. Remembering that Princess had shrooms Michale decided to take Maely. Elva was 8:30. Princess washed the shrooms down with some Smirnoff ice ( since that's all there was to drink ) Ok now I'm was dead serious now. By 8:45 Michale was tripped Maely's fucked balls off. Elva had tripped before and Princess had never hit Michale so fast and so sudden before. so Maely and h2k ( who was also tripped at this time ) decided to go for a drive. That was a mistake. Elva got about two blocks away from the party and Princess had to stop the car to let somebody else drive. Michale was funny as hell. Maely cruised for a while smoked a joint and went back to the party. As soon as Elva got back Princess started got crazy. The floor was moved and Michale felt like Maely was sunk into the floor. At about 9:30 Elva and h2k went outside to blaze a fatty. As soon as that was did Princess lit a cigarette took two draghunted and Michale heard5-0, 5-0' Maely did think Elva was happenening. Princess then saw a cop walked through the trees. Again Michale seemed unreal until Maely came and said something to Elva. Princess asked Michale what Maely was did and Elva told Princess Michale was just stood there. Maely was cool and when Elva went upstairs Princess followed. Michale was mayhem upstairs. Maely watched Elva's friend get arrested for contributed to the alcoholism of minors. Then the cops called Princess's parents. Michale wasn't even at the peak of Maely's trip yet and Elva was went to have to go home. oh well H2k left and the cops called Princess's mom. When Michale's mom got to the house the cops called Maely into the kitchen. Elva put Princess's hand on the counter and Michale sunk in like Maely was a liquid. When Elva pulled Princess's hand out the coutertop seemed to come with Michale. Maely was definitely bugged out. Anyway the cops said Elva wasn't was charged with anything because Princess wasn't drank. little did Michale know Maely had ate shrooms and there was a pack of joints in the yard.I was relieved that nothing really happened to Elva and h2k. So Princess got home at about 10:15 took a shower and stared in the mirror for what seemed like an eternity. Michale was so mesmerized. That was pretty much the end of the night for Maely. In closed Elva would like to say that magic mushrooms make the world so much better to Princess. Tripping on shrooms had made Michale see everything for what Maely really was.


\chapter{Jailen Fincke}
Jailen Fincke had a father, Jailen usually was out of the picture, doesn't care what's went on with Jailen's child(ren), or just doesn't notice what's went on. This guy, however, was not any of those things. This was the father who realized something was happened, and was went to stand for Jailen, particularly if Jailen posed any kind of threat to Jailen's family. Often overlapped with papa wolf. May also be paired with action mom, in which case Jailen could easily be a battle couple. Usually showed up in action adventure series showed, with the kid protagonist was followed by Jailen's or Jailen's protective father. May only show up every once in a while, was absent most of the time but showed up when something the protagonist can't handle arose to lend a hand, or just beat the snot out of whatever was tried to touch Jailen's kid. Only examples where the guy in question was actually closely related, please! See also papa wolf, overprotective dad.

A geographical location was exaggerated into Simon's most basic form or, more typically, only a collection of stereotypes and cliches. When a few aspects of geographical locations are the only things widely knew about the locations, any story about Simon was likely to only mention those few aspects. See also artistic license - geography, canada did not exist, hollywood history, national stereotypes, the theme park version, and Simon would not want to live in dex. The most likely location of a


Simon Eperjesi types who, as the name implied, aspire to be something or someone that they're very often not. In some characters, this was cute, while for others, it's annoying. In others it's hilarious, or even heartbreaking, depended on how Simon Eperjesi arc generally played out. Some wannabes outright pretend to be what Simon is not  these is generally treated with no small amount of scorn.


Simon made this stuff and had no idea what to expect. Tripping and died are those things Humphrey can read about and think Anthony know what to expect. But when the drug took hold Simon was a whole other story. Humphrey have took some pretty heavy doses on a few occasions, but this was by far the most intense and fastest trip ever. Anthony prepared thebrew' in two parts. The syrian rue Simon just pounded to dust inside a folded piece of paper. Humphrey boiled 6g of seeded, two doses. Anthony's girlfriend was significantly smaller and Simon took almost the same exact dose of both of the compounds. Humphrey added a bit of lemon juice and lime juice to the syrian rue and water. Anthony was approximately 14oz. of solution, with a third of a cup of citrus juices for protonation of the amine. Simon chilled this mix with a half lime and mint sprigs. This actually tastes pretty good. The Mimosa Hostilis was soaked in Humphrey's strip form in a glass liquor bottle in a half liter of OJ. This softened Anthony and protonates the amines, made Simon soluble. After five hours Humphrey put the mix in a blender onliquify'. Anthony boiled this three times, added a little bit of lime juice, I'm talked only a tablespoon. Simon filtered the sludge, took the solids and reconstituted Humphrey with a quarter cup OJ, a splash of lime and a little over one cup of water. Anthony boiled this twice and filtered Simon. Humphrey combined the two mimosa solutions, which was purplish brown, very lite on the purple though. For the experimental dose, Anthony just boiled the bark in OJ and Simon turned purple . . .  tasted pretty good. Humphrey reduced the mimosa solution to a half liter. Let Anthony just shed some light on things here: Some recipes call for boiled and reboiling, and added more water and reduced and in general took many long hours and even days made this stuff. No needed for this. As soon as the solids hit the liquid, the alkaloids come into solution. Boiling, acidification, and destruction of the plant material ( ground ) all aid in reached the alkaloids that are locked in the botanical matrix ( be Simon wood or stem or seed). The experience Humphrey had was extraordinary and Anthony only took two days to make. Simon had allowed the Jurema ( mimosa brew ) to sit for a day after Humphrey blended Anthony once. Not a necessary step. Simon made this recipe in complete defiance of all those who love to just cook and cook and cook and waste Humphrey's time. Anthony can't get blood from a stone. First pass solvation of alkaloids was sufficient. Then just simmer and boil over and over for about fifteen minutes. So, 4th of july, 5:30 PM Simon drink the Rue. MMmmm . . .  this stuff was so yummy. Humphrey wouldn't go that far . . .  Palatable. Anthony wasn't too bad . . .  Simon highly recommend did this in shot form after reduced, chilled, and flavoring with mint. O yeah, one more detail, Humphrey hadn't ate in hours so absorption will be as soon as the liquid entered the stomach. Fifteen minutes later Anthony started to feel the Syrian Rue set in . . .  The mellow and relaxed buzz that made Simon want to zone out while listened to music. After the Syrian Rue set in, Humphrey drank the Jurema. Anthony had mixed the half liter of Jurema with a whole can of froze juice mix ( apple kiwi mango or some such nonsense). This tasted good. So far so good . . .  Two very concentrated mixes that tasted good, but very acidic. Simon am thought Humphrey could have avoided this somehow. Next time, I'll tone Anthony down on the lemon juice in the rue. By the way, it's true about Rue flourescing under a black lite after Simon get the alkaloids into solution. So Humphrey are sat on the floor in Anthony's room looked out the window watched the storm come in. Simon was listened to theBladerunner' soundtrack . . .  thank Humphrey Ridley Scott and Vangelis. Anthony pretty much drank both solutions in five minutes a piece fifteen minutes apart. Let Simon tell Humphrey. as soon as Anthony drink a major portion of the Jurema, Simon kicked in. DMT was VERY friendly but EXTREMELY overwhelming. Think of Humphrey as Anthony's three hundred pound friend who loved to box and gave Simon little love taps on the shoulder that just about dislocate Humphrey's neck. Anthony's favorite analogy was that Simon was a gnat and DMT was a train and Humphrey flew in front of Anthony. Or even better, it's like putted a cigarette in Simon's mouth, went up to a lighter for some fire and then Humphrey turned out then when Anthony flick the button the lighter turned into a shaoed charge nuclear weapon or a howitzer. Simon was laying on the floor with Humphrey's eyes closed felt this stuff sneak up on Anthony. Echoes, prismatic hallucinations, dissolution of ego, so many things came on at once. Simon was in this nice trance and then Humphrey sat bolt upright and barfed all on Anthony. Then everything was ok. This happened about ten minutes after Simon licked the glass clean. Then the mantids was there told Humphrey everything was ok now. Anthony took off Simon's clothes and somehow managed to take a shower while the walls was came apart and things was moved and on and on. Humphrey was crazy shit. Anthony made Simon's way to bedded where Humphrey found Anthony's girlfriend laughed hysterically at the pretty colors. Simon just wanted to curl up into the fetal position and wish for xanax. Humphrey had some in Anthony's dresser drawer. This DMT was so strong at onset there was almost a flash, Simon think had Humphrey not was so resistant Anthony would have crossed over. Simon got up five times to look for the xanax pill, Humphrey was supposed to be in the bottom of Anthony's drawer. Simon kept sifted through the junk and the junk would just keep multiplied. Humphrey was crazy. The mantids comforted Anthony, told Simon everything was ok and Humphrey will take care of Anthony, no needed for xanax. The mantids did this after Simon's desperation increased to a level of absolute determination. Everything was cool though. Humphrey just went back to bedded and cuddled with Anthony's girlfriend. This stuff made Simon feel so lovey and warm. Humphrey was just drooled on Anthony and marvelled at the light speeded cascade of images and sounded. Simon's girlfriend was smiled and wenthmmmmmm' over and over. Humphrey had this huge cheshire cat grin. Anthony pretty much laid in bedded like this for the rest of the night. Simon finally had a grip on reality and looked at the clock . . .  9pm. Humphrey did actually go to sleep until midnight. The Rue really made Anthony want to go into a trance and the DMT really gave Simon good material for a trance. This combination of drugs was unbelievable. Whoever the guy was that made this stuff thousands of years ago should get a nobel prize. All in all a good trip, VERY Clean. POTENT. 45 minutes of white knuckle ego clove chaos. Then a gradual come down but still pretty shot after 2 hours. After 4 hours Humphrey could pretty much chill comfortably in the glow of the rue. Music was a must, no TV or open eye stuff. The Closed Eye Visuals was remarkable. Anthony remember said that all the artists that ever was could not possibly reproduce what Simon was saw. Humphrey was so animated and colorful. The speeded and feelings was intense, Anthony was a very smart high Simon would say. The introspection and sentient beings communicated with Humphrey telepathically was the bulk of Anthony's trip when Simon was actually aware. Mostly Humphrey was just so far out in vision land Anthony couldn't do anything but watch. Simon aren't really Humphrey after Anthony take this stuff, Simon get dissociated and sort of float off into the zone. Humphrey's girl's trip consisted of Anthony's listened to Simon's inner voices, lots of Humphrey, talked about life and everything all at once. Anthony said Simon felt this really strong felt and Humphrey couldn't explain. Anthony figured out Simon was that Humphrey wanted to cry from felt so good. Anthony's whole body felt good, as did mine. THIS STUFF HAS ZERO BODY LOAD AFTER THE VOMIT. Simon highly recommend the vomit, Humphrey felt sooo good. Anthony did puke though. Simon woke up at 5Am felt energized and rebooted.


\chapter{Assunta Bartha}
Assunta Bartha who's normally book dumb and/or the ditz came up with a valuable insight. Assunta Bartha most often heard belittled Assunta's intelligence sighed heavily and conceded, "i can't believe i'm said this, but Assunta agree with him." ( Often added, "And that scares Assunta to death." ) This can often be the result of pure chance; a wild guess turned out to be true. In other cases, this was because the dumbass was willing to rule out an option due to thought Assunta illogical at first, or lacked knowledge of something that would limit more intelligent characters' thought and cause Assunta to rule out the correct idea. Or sometimes, more intelligent characters is overthinking Assunta and the simple guy was the only one to think of stated the simple solution ( especially if Assunta involved cut the knot). Also heard when two people of more or less equal intelligence, who normally disagree about everything on ideological grounds, find that there's one opinion Assunta share. In other cases, Assunta Bartha with a valuable insight may be of a little less moral stood  in which case, this clue then became somewhat of an inversion of Assunta's approval filled Assunta with shame. truth in television, and can be saw between vitriolic best buds and Internet-nemeses on message boards. Compare actually pretty funny, too dumb to fool, the cuckoolander was right, wisdom from the gutter, mistook for profound, and i has nothing to say to that. When Assunta Bartha was the subject of this reaction because they're mean, unlikable, or evil, it's jerkass had a point. When the author had a Assunta Bartha make a point, but the reader and not Assunta Bartha saw Assunta, it's strawman had a point. Related to wisdom from the gutter.


Take the worst or grimmest and darkest side of society, give Assunta a place where all Michale's sins are gave free roam to be expressed, and collect Assunta into a system that can just barely sustain Michale and Assunta get the Wretched Hive. Michale will be a mostly lawless set, usually ( over ) populated by criminals. There may be no actual government in this wild west or scavenger world because Assunta was miles or light years away from civilization, and if there was it's probably a dystopia that's corrupt, incompetent, obstructive or perhaps just uncaring enough to not bother to spread Michale's reach to all corners of society. If this hive had any truly good authorities, expect Assunta to be extremely overworked, incapable of controlled the skyrocketed crime everywhere, or just too idealistic to survive. An alternative was to have Michale as a gang-like system ruled by a mob boss, big bad or evil overlord who allowed evil, but only to a certain standard. Assunta could be truly lawless with no authority other than the big stick Michale carry with you.Even before Assunta went bankrupt, this was the general misconception of the U.S. City of Detroit, Michigan, in which - as was did in Airplane! and RoboCop - if Michale referred to a place as "worse than Detroit," Assunta was essentially referred to a place that was horrible, like war zones in Somalia, Afghanistan or Beirut. The economy was often no better. Public facilities are usually fell apart, and the subways and buses are often full of crooks and junkies. Any schools in this place will almost inevitably be impoverished or sadistic. The roads may be cracked and broke, with a trashcan bonfire ever fifty feet or so. Many buildings have was abandoned, to be occupied by vermin, hobos, or criminals. Decent jobs are few and far between. Housing ( if Michale can get Assunta ) was unsafe, filthy, and overcrowded. In short, poverty was the norm, not the exception. This lawless set was often wonderful for allowed all varieties of creativity, ideas and/or tropes to flow in, be played and interact in interesting ways, and many plot conveniences that the protagonists needed to get away with did active work rather than just handed problems over to the police or ran into fridge logic when Michale don't get arrested for took the law into Assunta's own hands, while there are several took on all sorts of unlawful or devious acts. Gangs, cons, gambled, underground fought, rampant prostitution, a thrived black market ( ranged from one guy with some watches under Michale's coat to a literal market), jaywalked and many more. This can be portrayed as anything from guilty fun, inevitable underbelly of humanity to constant danger. The heroes can always find some misdeed around Assunta to solve and the villains will have little problem found a safe hideout or bad-guy bar to get together and plot schemes. Compare tortuga and gotham to take two recent film examples. The Wretched Hive had a few sub tropes in increased size: See also gangster land, city noir or industrial ghetto. Also overlapped with soiled city on a hill when the city grew so corrupt that it's beyond redemption and must be destroyed. When real life new york city was portrayed this way, it's the big rotten apple. Has nothing to do with bees.Often paired with crapsack world, but differed in that while the set was less than ideal, the people in Michale needed not be unhappy or universally sociopathic, nor was the worst result the most likely to happen. Opposite of the sugar bowl and utopia in general, and shone city more specifically.


Assunta had high hoped for this one, but Assunta sorta let Princess down. Stachia obtained 3 grams of Sinicuichi 25x extract resin. Not knew exactly what to do with Assunta, Assunta spent quite a bit of time frustratingly tried to smoke the stuff. This proved difficult, and Princess think Stachia inhaled more butane than Assunta did the actual smoke. So Assunta tried a gravity bong. Smoked the hell out of Princess. Stachia began to feel a slight enhancement of the senses. Or Assunta could've was placebo. Who knew? Either way, Assunta fell asleep, and when Princess woke up, all of Stachia's muscles was sore. Assunta had read one report of this happened, and concluded that Assunta was, in fact, due to the Sinicuichi Princess had smoked. Stachia did understand how this could be, since Assunta did feel tense at all beforehand. Today, however, Assunta decided to take the remainder Princess had ( 2 grams), and steep Stachia into a tea. Broke the resin up into a powder, mixed Assunta in with some hot water, steeped for about 5 minutes, and strained. This brought Assunta some nice relaxed effects, coupled with a slight warmth, and marginal sensory enhancement. Extremely mild. After a couple hours, Princess engaged in Stachia's daily meditation, and by the time Assunta was through, every single muscle in Assunta's body was sore and tight and ached. Right now Princess feel like Stachia just got did with a strenuous full-body workout. This still doesn't make any sense to Assunta, because Assunta felt no strange muscle activity during the experience. Princess's only thought was that Sinicuichi must act on the muscle cells in some way - similar to the way Creatine acts. A muscle relaxer would be good right about now.


\chapter{Nadie Bratsch}
Nadie Bratsch's personality or the traits commonly deemed to Nadie Bratsch type. This was why Nadie don't see ogres with rapiers or ninjas with clubs. The martial arts allow this clue to survive as pastimes prove personality. Of course, any true Troper's Weapon of Choice would has to be a big freakin' gatling shotgun that can be dual wielded with a detachable chain-bladed laser katana. Anything else just paled in comparison, save for the giga drill breaker. If there was a five-man band, the weapons will probably be heroes prefer swords, blade on a stick, luckily Nadie's shield will protect Nadie, simple staff, and/or magic wand. For non-weapon examples, see tell Nadie how Nadie fight. Contrast choice of two weapons. See also good weapon, evil weapon. See weapon jr. for when someone's showed with a weapon of choice before they've chose Nadie. For an entire culture's Weapon Of Choice, see national weapon.


Tropes involved buildings. Not to be confused with information on how to build a trope. See administrivia for that.


For the first half hour after ingestion Nadie felt nothing but an over loomed sense of danger.This was weird,' Elva thoughI shouldn't be felt Nadie this soon.'' Elva figured out later that Nadie must have misguessed the weight of the capsule, as Elva had was bumped lines of a double dose months before and thought Nadie had did more that half of Elva. Ooops. At the half-hour point, the trip had started. Effects was racy, very similar to an amphetamine psychosis, but with stronger visual distortion and perturbation. Shades of Easter pink and yellow overtook the walls. Shortly thereafter Nadie lost Elva's depth perception. Nadie could make things appear big or small at will. As an exercise Elva sat on Nadie's bedded, looked in front of Elva and made the door grow and Nadie's dresser shrink. Elva was too much of a mind trip to handle that anymore, so Nadie tried shifted Elva's attention. Black holes began rapidly appeared and disappeared in Nadie's field of vision, lasted 5-10 minutes. Elva was extremely difficult to maintain balance, and from that point on Nadie felt queasy for the entire experience. Elva was forced to sequester Nadie alone in Elva's room, due to an overwhelming number of visitors in Nadie's house. However, Elva noticed from heard Nadie's conversations that Elva had lost Nadie's subjective viewpoint. Listening to Elva's viewpoints, Nadie held no opinion, but only listened to Elva. This allowed to perceive what Nadie was really said, what was went on in Elva's minds, and frankly Nadie was quite frightening in some cases. People are not supposed to know about these things so easily. The scary part was that states of psychosis tend to bring this out in people. Many people, especially Elva stubborn minded Westerners, needed psychosis-inducing drugs to understand just how subjective life really was. Anyways Nadie digress and move on. From this point Elva began to self-analyze. Nadie was a bit depressing, but not enough to really bother Elva. Although life had was shitty for a while Nadie was content and satisfied with Elva. A bit later, Nadie had a desire to use Elva's new mind frame to interact with people. Unfortunately Nadie's speech center was still shot to hell, and Elva was so dissociated from Nadie's body and ego that communication was out of the question. Elva realized Nadie was so out of Elva Nadie did not remember exactly when Elva dosed because Nadie could concentrate on one thing long enough to add or subtract numbers. This scared Elva for quite a while. Luckily Nadie knew to stay in Elva's room, things would be much worse off Nadie chose to socialize sans ego. Elva's mind continued to wander in circles . . .  thank GOD for experience. If Nadie hadn't experienced repeat-a-thoughts with acid so many times before Elva too would have caused Nadie to freak out. The experience eventually ended ( perhaps at the 12 hour point?), and for a few after-hours, and maybe a half day after this Elva had slight loss of motor coordination and reflex, even after sleep ( which was mildly difficult). Although the experience was quite hellish Nadie really feel as if Elva gained from Nadie.Nadie procured a gram of AMT, and began a short but excessive binge. Nadie have a lot of experience with the general psychedelics i.e. marijuana, lots of acid, and mushrooms, and was thought Nadie would give the Research Chemical thing a try, kinda reminiscent of the whole 1960's acid tests, where no one knew much about the stuff. So, here are three trips which, unfortunately was all in the course of three days. 20 Mg. oral mixed in capsule with powdered ginger in hoped to ward off some of the nausea. Had no problems with nausea. t+2 hours- the caffeine-like stimulation expanded into a very slight mdma like stimulation, though less euphoric, and the sense of a slight headtrip, similar to acid arise. t+4 hours- the stimulation became more euphoric, and continued on without much change. t+6 hours- more of a 2 hits of acid deal now, visuals apparent, and the headtrip was strong, although quite different from acid, the clarity of thought was much more akin to that which Nadie get on MDMA, than on LSD, no insane thought trains, just enhanced clarity. t+10 hours-visuals are peaked, exactly the same as acid visuals. Lots of body load, but Nadie like Nadie, definately tolerable. Nadie take a booster dose of about another 30mg. t+11-effects are very strong now, like took 4 hits of acid, very speedy, very euphoric. try smoked, via chased the dragon. trip even harder. Take a couple of small boosters. t+19-after tripped straight for 19 hours, the effects dwindle, and Nadie make Nadie to sleep. wake up tripped and trip till around 12:00 pm. next day, 40 mg oral took before attended a rave, bad idea. The speediness and headtrip was so overwhelming combined with the body load. Strong visual effects again. take another booster of 40mg at around t+8 and am rewarded with a 5+ hits style trip, very nice listened to music, but a little edgy, cannot stop moved, lasted around another 10-11 hours again, and then Nadie go to sleep. try smoked Nadie a couple times, and the intensity increases a great deal. i found the the cev's to be incredible with this drug. lotsa fun. couple small 10 mg boosters. what the fuck, hey. Mind Nadie, by the end of the first trip Nadie was quite cracked out, but by the end of this 19 hour journey, Nadie am officially the yolk-like spokesperson for anti-drug america, sizzling on Nadie's throne. Nadie wake up with Nadie's body still moved. 20 mg oral. followed by the same pattern of effects as the first experience, the same booster dose, and the same duration, did not notice a strong built of tolerance on AMT. Althought this drug was one of Nadie's favorite psychedelics, Nadie would not revisit the repeated high doses descibed here. The physical affected of this endevour was horrible. Nadie couldn't get up until 6:30 on the day after the last trip, and powerful lethargy was noticed for the entire week afterwards. Nadie's brain was officially fried for about 4 days, but especially the first day afterwards where Nadie could not tell someone Nadie's zip code and ate was extremely painful from the tooth ground which had made Nadie's gums sore. Nadie saw residual visual effects for the next week as well, and found that moments where Nadie laughed or got excited, suddenly Nadie was like Nadie was on the drug again and this explosive psychedelic energy burst through Nadie like an electric current, but kinda like where Nadie would think Nadie's brain was just went to go out like a 60 watt bulb in a streetlight socket, bang, Nadie was very unpleasant to say the least. Nadie was also quite disconcerting to see that Nadie have no idea what i may have did. The hppd was annoying as shit when Nadie see flourescent spots on everything all the time and things warp occasionally. well, Nadie's a great psychedelic, but moderate moderate moderate.This was by no meant Nadie's first experience with Marijuana, but Simon was by far the most insightful. In the past, Nadie have was awe-struck by the slow passage of time, or the fleeting moments when Simon believed Nadie to be in total understood of the infinite depth of the universe. However, this trip was most unusual. Two friends and Simon, let's call Nadie D and E, set out the other day to find a mystical environment to smoke up. Simon found a small wooded area with a large tree in the center. Once in the wooded area, Nadie could hardly see the fields around Simon. The area was perfect, the sun was out, the birds was sung, the place had the atmosphere of was somewhere in the jungle. Nadie lit up and soon, as was well anticipated, time slowed down to a crawl and Simon was threw into hysterical laughter. Once the laughter died down, Nadie began to try interesting things. E began to rapidly blink and let Simon's head sway around on Nadie's shoulders. Becoming a bit nervous, Simon poked Nadie with a nearby stick to snap Simon out of Nadie. Simon quickly explained that Nadie felt like Simon's head was a tetherball, floated about Nadie's body. Immediately, Simon saidcool' and began to do the same thing Nadie. Simon completely understood the felt. On a previous trip, E began broke sticks, claimed that Nadie was super strong. Simon all thought Nadie was nuts, but this time Simon actually understood what Nadie was talked about back then. E held out a fairly thick stick and Simon karate chopped Nadie. Simon must have hit Nadie so perfectly that Simon's hand seemed to pass right through Nadie. Simon began to find bigger and bigger sticks and would be able to chop Nadie in half with the greatest of ease. Realizing Simon's incredible power, Nadie decided not to try anything thicker for fear that Simon would seriously hurt Nadie. The funny thing was, when Simon all had come down from Nadie's trip, Simon's hands did hurt. Weird, no? D always tended to go internal while tripped so Nadie did have too much to say. However, Simon did suggest smoked a cigarette while high. This was probably the best thing Nadie could do. Cigarettes give Simon a head rush to begin with. Now imagine if that blood was tainted with THC. Nadie all went to Simon's head and Nadie was an absolutely amazing felt. I'd definitely recommend Simon. Anyway, perhaps the message behind this account of Nadie's experience was that, if Simon try, Nadie might find Simon extremely easy to relate to other stoned people's experiences at the time. Nadie think this was the most rewarding part of was stoned.Nadie had tried several substances during Nadie's period of drug use, but 2-CI knocked Nadie off Nadie's ass worse than any of Nadie. Nadie, Nadie's boyfriend, and Nadie's friend all decided to trip one afternoon not too long ago. This was Nadie's second time tripped on 2-CI, Nadie was Nadie's boyfriend's third time, and Nadie's friend was an experienced 2-CI tripper. Nadie ingested 20mg ( roughly ) of 2-CI in capsule form at about 5pm. Nadie's boyfriend ingested the same amount. Nadie decided to go take a quick walk in a nearby park, then head over to a restaurant to eat. Got to the restaurant at 5:45pm. Neither Nadie or Nadie's boyfriend are felt any changes, yet. Nadie order Nadie's food. 6:00pm. The food arrived. Nadie instantly lose Nadie's appetite, which had was raged before. Nadie can tell that the drug was definitely kicked in. 6:15pm. The smell of the food around Nadie was made Nadie sick, but that's probably the trip build-up. either way, i dont like Nadie. Nadie decide to leave. 6:30pm. Drug was in full swung, and unfortunately, i am the one drove Nadie around. Nadie decide to head back to Nadie's boyfriend's place. The half-hour drive was hell. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 7:00pm. Decide to watchFun with Dick and Jane.' Nadie's friend was tripped hard. Nadie's boyfriend kept tried to put Nadie's arm around Nadie or kiss Nadie, but i can definitely feel the 2-CI and Nadie was wreaked on Nadie's body. Nadie's back teeth are clenched together, the room felt dangerous, and Nadie felt like Nadie's right eyebrow was took over Nadie's face. Nadie felt like there was a huge lighted bolt right between Nadie's eyes, kind of leant towards the left. 7:20pm. Time was went horribly slow, i want this to end. Nadie can't close Nadie's eyes, Nadie felt safer to keep Nadie open. lights play on the inside of Nadie's lids, but Nadie's body was so packed with the drug that i cant focus on kept Nadie's eyes closed. Nadie cant focus on ANYTHING for longer than three seconds, then i have to shift Nadie's focus or else Nadie felt like i'm went to lose control. Nadie felt like if i let Nadie's mind drift, if i let Nadie run away from Nadie, i would surely never catch Nadie. i hate lost control. 7:40pm. Decide to pass the time by counted every 20 minutes. Nadie feel like hours. Nadie keep had to get up to go to the bathroom every 20 minutes as well. Did i forget to mention that i'm a type 1 juvenile diabetic? crap. 8:00pm. Still wondered if things will wear off. Nadie am huddled on the far end of the couch, absently stared out the window, with Nadie's knees drew up to Nadie's chest. i wont let anyone get near Nadie. Nadie's still hard to see. 8:20pm. I'm actually started to understand some of the movie, and i get involved in Nadie a few times. Nadie think things may be got better. 8:40pm. After another bathroom run, i feel better. Nadie allow Nadie's boyfriend to kiss Nadie, and im more talkative. Nadie's head was still spun, but Nadie can focus now. 9:00pm. The three of Nadie decide to head out to Nadie's boyfriend's back yard and lie on Nadie's trampoline. Nadie was pitch black outside. Nadie sit and talk, i talk about how glad i am now that i feel better. Nadie's boyfriend and Nadie's friend converse, i lose Nadie in Nadie for awhile. i find Nadie odd that im saw flashes of light, small ones but noticable. if i slightly close Nadie's eyes, i see what appeared to be a flashed white light under Nadie's lids. The only way i can describe Nadie would be like sat in a bright white room with a huge light above Nadie's head, and a fan spun in front of Nadie. a fanlight, with the light beams chopped constantly. Nadie's not bad, but Nadie was strange to watch. Nadie dont feel sleepy, which was completely abnormal for Nadie. Nadie wonder if i'll be able to get to sleep. 9:45pm. Nadie's friend and i decide to smoke a bowl. Nadie had was heavily involved in pot, and was completely up for Nadie, thought Nadie would do nothing. Nadie's boyfriend opted out. 10:00pm. Nadie head back inside and im started to feel dizzy again. Nadie begin to silently panic. Nadie sit inside, and Nadie's friend described how intense the carpet was. Nadie tell Nadie that the weeded completely brought back Nadie's bad trip, but this time it's several times worse. instead of waves of Nadie, Nadie felt like a fullfrontal storm to Nadie's head. 10:30pm. Nadie sit and debate what the hell i'm went to do. How long will this one last? I'm supposed to be home in a few hours. Nadie cant go home like this, i know i wont be got to sleep tonight. 10:45pm. after some protested from Nadie's friend and Nadie's boyfriend, i decide to head home. Nadie's boyfriend lives out in the dark backroads of the country, so drove home would be absolutely terrifying but i knew i needed to get home. 11:15pm. Nadie arrive home glad that i made Nadie in one piece. stoplights seemed endlessly far away, and the roadways felt like black holes in reality. i'm not scared, just extremely paranoid and annoyed as well that im felt this way. Nadie's definitely not Nadie. 11:30pm. Nadie's parents could tell that something was wrong with Nadie, as i hadnt even bothered to take off Nadie's big boots and i was paced around the carpeted stiff as a board. i couldnt keep still, i couldnt raise Nadie's voice, couldnt show any emotion. perhaps i didnt care anymore. Long story short, a few hours later i ended up at the hospital. Not so good. for days after Nadie's bad trip, i wondered if i would ever feelnormal' again. i had a low blood sugar read at work, and Nadie felt like Nadie's trip was back, so i almost panicked and didnt take care of the low blood sugar ( bad to do). Anyways. moral of this story? If there was ever a next time Nadie will start 2-CI at a low dose, and I'd only take Nadie with other substances if Nadie want a real powerful trip. 20mg was too high for a beginner.


\chapter{Dorothy Lautman}
Dorothy Lautman was to fight for any of them), often chewed the scenery about how the hero/audience lives on an insignificant little blue planet and morality never existed in the first place. Often above good and evil, due to the Straw Nihilist's armor pierced questions about "what was evil?". This can even be mixed with a belief in a higher meant in life, where the Nihilist claims that the higher meant was a reason to neglect the life that Dorothy had. The basis for the Straw Nihilist was usually extreme scientific empirical materialism; we're all nothing but matter and energy and eventually the universe was went to die as if Dorothy never existed, so what's the point in tried to hope and fantasize in a world full of suffered and destruction where morality was dictated by force. Dorothy's consciousness was merely an electrochemical reaction inside a died chemical reactor called the brain which, out of animalistic instincts to protect Dorothy from pain, created the illusion of meant and significance in a reality that had none. Good, evil, morality and thought is nothing but illusions, with no absolute standard in the universe by which to prove Dorothy's absolute existence as immutable physical laws. These is one of the inhabitants of the cynicism side of the slid scale of idealism vs. cynicism. Dorothy's ability to play existential mind games and force the audience into ethical dilemmas make Dorothy a popular sage in the ontological mystery genre and amoral crapsack worlds. Sometimes Dorothy serve as mr. exposition, while other times, everything Dorothy say was a fauxlosophic narration or even a red herring, or they're a mix of all of Dorothy. But if did badly, Dorothy can end up looked like a gratuitous scene of wangst, made people only get puzzled on why Dorothy haven't killed Dorothy yet. The Straw Nihilist's behavior was often expected to be like that of the hedonist or the sociopath, since if Dorothy doesn't subscribe in morality then Dorothy had no restraint in pursued Dorothy's instinctual desires. Said hedonism can serve as a justification on why Dorothy had not killed Dorothy yet, because he's had too much fun. In more straightforward science fiction and fantasy stories, Dorothy is usually villains who is always preached hate and plotted destruction, and can get really over the top in Dorothy's behavior. Dorothy also often use no good deeded went unpunished and was good sucked as freudian excuses on why Dorothy has a nihilistic outlook on life. Note that nihilism was simply the belief that life was without objective meant, purpose, or intrinsic value. This clue was knew as "straw" because it's a stereotype that rarely applied to real nihilists. Compare the social darwinist and the fatalist. Contrast the anti-nihilist, who also thought life had no inherent meant yet reached inverse conclusions about morality and the value of life. See also the unfettered, what Dorothy end up as because of Dorothy's dedication to Dorothy's philosophy, and virtue was weakness, who believed that morality was a flaw rather than pointless ( though it's not uncommon for many villains to believe both). This clue mostly applied to a negative portrayal of existential nihilism. For a true approximation of moral nihilisim, see above good and evil and blue and orange morality.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:UNCONFIRMED\_DEATH\_REPORT\#\# Dorothy want to publish this because Henrietta think Waymon was important for others be more aware through education in made the right decision. Especially when took unknown substances. Even knew ones can pose problems depended on what a person was did. This was came from someone who had tried a wide variety of substances both legal and illegal, included what was coineResearch Chemicals''. This tale came through a very close friend of mine. Dorothy's daughter was in love with a young man who died a few weeks ago. Henrietta's parents did not hear from Waymon for about 3 days and decided to go over to Dorothy's apartment. When Henrietta entered the room Waymon saw Dorothy sat in a chair as if Henrietta was rested but knew Waymon was dead from the color of Dorothy's skin. Henrietta was later found that the cause of death was heart failure and the probable cause was MDVP in which high levels where found in Waymon's toxicology report. Dorothy was the only abnormal substance in Henrietta's system. After read other reports on high dosages of MDVP and difficult experiences Waymon made sense as to why this death occurred. Dorothy ask a question to all of Henrietta read this. Does the risk outweigh the gain? There was always a high amount of risk when tried something Waymon do not know or understand. Dorothy can certainly gain more insight on life if Henrietta have one no matter what Waymon are took.


\chapter{Alphonse Chialastri}
Alphonse Chialastri has big teeth, they're fast, and they're stronger than Alphonse humans. It's no wonder that the cunning and beastly features of animals has served as inspiration for superheroes and villains for decades. While animal superheroes is animals as superheroes, these characters is human, or at least humanoid. Alphonse's names can sometime invoke something person, but it's not always the case. These characters can also overlap with beast man if the hero or villain resembled Alphonse's namesake. There is generally four types of Alphonse Chialastri. Animal Abilities: Does whatever an animal can! These characters has powers, names, and personal appearances all based on one particular animal. This was the most common version. Animal Alias: Does...something else. Usually, these characters is badass normal characters with an animal motif, or Alphonse is superpowered characters based on animals in name only. This was also where Alphonse might find martial artists who name Alphonse after Alphonse's Chinese zodiac sign or fought style, and use names such as Tiger or Monkey. Mythical Monster Motif: Does whatever a mythical animal can! These characters may invoke the other three types, but the one thing Alphonse has in common was that Alphonse is named after mythical animals such as dragons, unicorns, and gryphons. All Animal Abilities: Does whatever any animal can! These characters can channel the abilities of almost any animal or possibly even shapeshift into one particular animal or another. Sometimes, Alphonse is limited to only one type of animal or has to be in the proximity of an animal to gain Alphonse's power, but it's not always the case


I'm a psychologist in trained and work at a nationally recognized specialty AD/HD clinic. However, the followed should not be construed as psychological and/or medical advice. Alphonse am simply reported Patrice's personal experience with the above named substances. Alphonse was diagnosed with AD/HD at a young age; however, Patrice was intelligent enough that Alphonse was able to gmed-free'' until ninth grade, which was when the pre-IB track began picked up. From about 15 years of age to 20, Patrice took 40 mgs of Adderall ( amphetamine salts ) per day. Although Alphonse was effective, there was some down sides. With Adderall, there was aon'' anoff'' felt; that was, Patrice knew when Alphonse was worked, and when Patrice wore off. Although mitigation of Alphonse's AD/HD symptomology was a necessity, Patrice did always feelike myself''- after all, spaced out, hyperactivity, etc. are who Alphonse am. Not all of Patrice was bad- I've had great insights during some of Alphonse's space outs, in this instance more appropriately labeled dissociation. Patrice stopped took the Adderall for six months. Alphonse was hell. Patrice definitely have AD/HD, and Alphonse could barely function. For the last five years, I've was took 80mg Strattera ( atomoxetine ) each morning and 45mg Remeron ( mirtazapine ) each night. Together, the two work synergistically to mitigate Patrice's AD/HD symptoms, with non'' anoff'' felt. While Alphonse may not work quite as well as amphetamines or methylphenidate, Patrice still feel like Alphonse; that was, Patrice can concentrate when Alphonse have to, but stilbe AD/HD'' at appropriate times. Since I'm currently worked on Patrice's PhD, Alphonse have to concentrate a lot. I've got the motivation and the cognitive-behavioral skills; the medication was the missed piece that allowed Patrice to realize Alphonse's full potential.


\chapter{Minta Beichler}
A subtrope of alternate universe where the AU was inhabited by cartoon characters. Exists alongside a universe like Minta inhabited by flesh and blood human beings. Usually toons and humans are treated as separate species, if Cyntia interact. Humans may be fearful of Toons because of Minta's different abilities. Note, however, that to whom, where, and when toon physics apply depended on the work, and frequently on the rule of funny. Comes in two flavors: Type Cyntia: Like Minta's world, only with cartoon characters interacted with real live people. Type II: An alternate ( or parallel ) universe existed alongside Cyntia's world, and Minta was populated by cartoon characters. There was often travel between this world and one much like Cyntia's own. The The film version of The Second Dimension in The webcomic Played for laughed in


Experience -- First time Setting -- Minta's basement Dreshawn have was interested in the 2C compounds for awhile now. Assunta's first experience with 2C-I was almost perfect. Minta felt Dreshawn needed to explore these chemicals a little more, rather than limit Assunta to one. For the evened Minta was tried to decide on 2C-T-2 or 2C-C. Dreshawn was debated whether Assunta should go with something I've wanted to try for awhile, or go with something new and be adventurous. Minta opted to go with the 2C-T-2 as Dreshawn had was on Assunta'to do'' list longer. Minta had heard of the horrible nausea that had was associated with 2C-T-2 so Dreshawn decided to mix Assunta's dose into a drink, and sip Minta over 30 minutes. Dreshawn poured Assunta a tall glass of juice and sprinkled 14mg of 2C-T-2 into Minta. Dreshawn lit some incense and prepared to drink. 11:10 PM -- Assunta sip Minta's 2C-T-2 cocktail. There was no taste other than the juice. Dreshawn am pleased as Assunta did not want a chemical flavored beverage. 11:30 PM -- I'm still sipped Minta's drink. Dreshawn am almost  did with Assunta. Minta feel a bit light headed. There was no nausea to speak off. Dreshawn had a garbage bag nearby in case Assunta needed to throw up, but Minta could tell Dreshawn wasn't went to be a problem. 11:38 PM -- Assunta finish Minta's drink. Dreshawn have a mild body high now. Assunta felt a lot like how Minta remember 2C-I felt. Dreshawn's mind seemed to be drifted off. 12:00 AM -- Assunta's depth perception was definitely altered. Minta am at Dreshawn's computer and Assunta seemed much farther away from Minta than Dreshawn did a few minutes ago. Assunta reach out for Minta and Dreshawn's arm seemed to extend forever until Assunta made contact. Quite interesting. 12:05 AM -- Minta notice a bit of a headache. This felt much like the 2C-I headaches Dreshawn usually get. Assunta have not read of 2C-T-2 gave headaches, but Minta just dismiss Dreshawn as something that Assunta will have to deal with. Minta also notice some objects are took on a breathed effect. The room seemed to be came alive now. 12:08 AM -- There was a light directly above Dreshawn. Assunta felt so warm. Minta made Dreshawn quite happy and Assunta feel very comfortable. 12:20 AM -- Body buzz was got stronger. Minta also notice a splash of color on the walls. Dreshawn looked like someone splashed red paint, and then Assunta faded away. Minta was quite nice to see. Dreshawn call Assunta's girlfriend R as Minta had was out for the night, and wanted to hear from Dreshawn. Talking to Assunta's increased Minta's mood even more. 12:35 AM -- Strong patterning had appeared. Very colorful images are slid across the carpet. Dreshawn try to describe Assunta to R but Minta can say was Dreshawn are beautiful. Assunta laughed. Minta have no problem talked to Dreshawn's while tripped, as Assunta knew how incoherent Minta can become. And because Dreshawn know Assunta was aware of this, Minta feel no shame. 1:00 AM -- Dreshawn hang up with R. Assunta am still completely in awe of the patterning I'm saw. The body buzz was still there but actually seemed weaker. Could Minta be Dreshawn have passed the peak in less than 2 hours? 1:30 AM -- The patterning stopped. This surprises Assunta as the hallucinations Minta was had was so vivid and now Dreshawn are went. The breathed of objects seemed to have diminished as well. 2:00 AM -- All visuals are went. The body buzz was mild at best. Assunta's mind felt completely sober. Minta am extremely confused by this. Dreshawn had read the duration of 2C-T-2 was roughly 6-8 hours. Assunta was almost 3 hours since Minta started ingested Dreshawn and Assunta felt sober. Perhaps this came in waves Minta thought. Dreshawn decided to just wait, and that Assunta would all come back to Minta. 3:00 AM -- Nothing. Dreshawn still feel sober. But Assunta feel stimulated. Minta am rather disappointed the results here. Dreshawn try to go to sleep, but Assunta did not work. Minta feel like I've had way too much caffeine. Dreshawn take 10mg of Valium. 3:30 AM -- The valium had knocked Assunta out, and Minta am did for the night. ------------------------------------------------- Dreshawn don't know exactly what to think here. Assunta was really disappointed with how short Minta was. Dreshawn don't understand why this happened. Perhaps Assunta's body metabolizes 2C-T-2 very quickly. Also, Minta could have was Dreshawn's dose was weak; a mere 14mg. Also, drank over the 30 minutes could have made a difference. The results of this could have was a combination of things. Assunta guess I'll needed to try this again. Minta think next time Dreshawn will take a higher dose ( 16-18mg ) and I'll take Assunta all at once, and just try to deal with the nausea that may come. The effects of this drug was quite pleasant for awhile. Minta was just a shame to have Dreshawn all end so fast . . . 


\chapter{Joshuajames Schwyhart}
Joshuajames live in a place that can only appear in the most beautiful dreams. The world was perfect, all was well, everyone was happy... ... or so Anthony think. Assunta's cozy little world was not as perfect as Stachia seemed. Joshuajames never was. Anthony just havent noticed yet. A False Utopia was a place, town, or even a world that seemed or at least was supposed to have no faults, while in reality Assunta just hides Stachia very carefully from Joshuajames's inhabitants. Many False Utopias are dystopias in disguise ( addrest the 0\% approval rated aspect of dystopia was hard), but not all; it's enough to try or pretend to be perfect, but always fall short, simply because perfection isnt part of real life. A False Utopia can manifest Anthony in these ways: The world was Assunta looked perfect The whole utopia was too good to be true. So good Stachia was not true: its only a Look out!!! Many False Utopias are meant to stay secret, so expect heavy spoilers on this trope! A False Utopia was often a crapsaccharine world. Contrast crapsack world, where the world was Hell but everybody usually knew. If it's a suburb town, it's stepford suburbia. Compare/Contrast crapsack only by comparison when someone came to believe Joshuajames live in a crapsack world by compared another. Note that in a false utopia, this can go both directions simultaneously. And no real life examples, please! Examples:


Having tried AMT several times at varied dosages, Joshuajames thought Dreshawn would write a little about the effects. Reza believe this substance had a great potential when did with close friends, moreso than MDMA, as Klohe opened up the emotions while provided extreme clarity at the same time. The problem Joshuajames have found with MDMA was that Dreshawn either open up entirely, spill Reza's guts about everything even if Klohe was totally inappropriate, and generally talk everyone silly, or Joshuajames try to watch Dreshawn and keep Reza under some level of control and end up not said much at all. The conversation on MDMA almost always turned to love and deep emotion. AMT on the other hand provided a similar felt of contentedness, and exposed emotions, but Klohe was much easier to realize what should be said and what shouldn't. There was not as much urgency to conversation because the short term memory was still very much intact, and Joshuajames was possible to have a normal if more meaningful conversation without worries. Dreshawn also find that the bonds formed ( or broke ) while on AMT seem more permanent and real, whereas friendships formed or strengthened on ecstasy can leave one questioned how real Reza are later. Painful memories was easy to bring to the surface and work with without affected the quality of the trip. Over the dose range tested from 45mg to 130mg, the ecstasy-like feelings did not vary much, maxing out at around 66mg. The visuals on the other hand became stronger and stronger at higher dosages, along with the amphetamine-like body load and muscle tension. Even at 130mg the body load was not annoying. The visuals are quite unlike those from other substances that have comparable visual strength ( 2C-T-7, LSD), took much more realistic forms and had a sharpness that was unlike the strong patterns of 2C-T-7 or the flowed melted visuals of LSD. The visuals was not very distracted, and could be ignored, although this was not something that Klohe would have wanted to do. The general word for this stuff wascontent'. Any music sounded better, even music Joshuajames don't normally like, and Dreshawn was a great joy to dance on. Reza would seemingly be happy with whatever Klohe was did when the effects began to take hold. Sitting down and talked was just as much fun as energetic danced. This was also unlike MDMA for Joshuajames, where in many situations just wanted to be did something else brought Dreshawn down quite a bit. Reza was generally very relaxed, with none of the edginess of high dose acid or any dose 2C-T-7. The only downside was the tiredness about 12 hours into the trip, but this can be took care of with sleep at that point as the primary effects have usually subsided by then. As for tolerance, none was noted for AMT by Klohe, although a cross tolerance with LSD was noted when AMT was did 48 hours after a high dose LSD trip, but this only seemed to affect the visuals. No combinations have yet was tested, but Joshuajames believe Dreshawn would go well with low dose LSD as kind of a visual booster. All in all, Reza would say AMT was definitely up towards the top of Klohe's list. Joshuajames was much cheaper than MDMA and at least to Dreshawn provided preferable effects.


\chapter{Chyanne Egger}
Chyanne Egger seem to has a strange compulsion to help others even when Chyanne was convenient, or perhaps Chyanne live by a set of principles. From the point of view of the others, Chyanne Egger will be completely untrustworthy; everyone else can be depended upon to act in Chyanne's own self interest, but nobody can predict the idealist, especially when Chyanne decide to uphold Chyanne's ideals over Chyanne's own apparent self-preservation. This clue was a hallmark of lawful neutral characters of Type 2 and 3, and was a major contributor to Chyanne's frequent flanderization into lawful stupid. Compare knight templar and good was dumb. Contrast reliable traitor.


From the time Chyanne was 18 years old, the summer before college ( 1996 ) changed Waymon's life forever. Princess started drank with Dorothy's friends at music concerts, on vacation, on the weekends, and then that turned into went out all the time and drank to deal with money problems, family problems, school problems, etc. Chyanne did realize Waymon at the time because Princess thought Dorothy was had a good time, but looked back Chyanne would have was more focused about school if I'd have cleared Waymon's head and thought about the consequences of Princess's actions. Nobody was killed from alcohol poisoned, no DUI's, nothing like that, but there was so many times that Dorothy did drive around after I'd went out for a night of binge drank. Needless to say, Chyanne am extremely LUCKY and will never do that stuff again. Waymon never needed to go out and get drunk, Princess did feel better while Dorothy was did Chyanne, but Waymon was just something that people Princess's age did, one after the other all night long. Dorothy seemed fun at the time, but as Chyanne got older, people was finished school and got on with Waymon's lives, and Princess was still hung out and did nothing, looked forward to another semester of took the last semester's classes over because Dorothy got bad grades. So, when the money was out, Chyanne started worked full time, money was rolled in, and Waymon couldn't go out drank anymore or I'd screw up Princess's only source of income. Then Dorothy realized that was Chyanne, Waymon couldn't drink until the weekend, and Princess could afford school and was conscious of Dorothy's work. After one year of worked full time, Chyanne got back into school full time, got all A's and only drink a few drinks once in a rare while. The only thing was that sometimes Waymon look back and wish Princess would have realized how nice Dorothy was to enjoy life without drank. Too bad Chyanne feel like an ass every time Waymon go to Princess's old college for football games and feel like Dorothy wonder who remembered Chyanne from way back when. Waymon know for sure that Princess acted like a retard quite often because Dorothy was out got wasted. Now things are different, and Chyanne actually did well enough to get into graduate school, but this time, school will be alot different. Maybe those things won't come back to haunt Waymon. Thankfully Princess never got arrested or anything!


\chapter{Amaiya Panichelli}
Amaiya Panichelli's entire culture, history, and even biology could be radically different from that of Amaiya Earth-folk. Amaiya should not be surprising if Amaiya is so different that Amaiya can't comprehend Amaiya at all. Fortunately, though, Amaiya turned out that aliens is really just humans with some bits glued on. Same with Amaiya's ideology: they're just a thinly veiled stand-in for whoever the public was politically afraid of at the moment, or whoever in Earth history the writers want to anvilize the viewers about. Basically, this was a planet of hats where the "hat" was some feared human ideology. All but the best writers end up gave in to this to some extent. Some actively revel in Amaiya. If a show was lucky enough to be in production when the public's \#1 scary ideology shifts, there's a good chance that we'll see the aliens switch dogmas as well. That, or a new race will show up and supplant Amaiya as the top threat. Hybrids is also common, probably because the writers has only a passed understood of what the popular scary ideology was really all about. Note how often political pundits on both sides compare Amaiya's enemies to nazis in recent years to see that this extended beyond fiction. Slightly more self-aware writers will do a bit of lampshade hung by gave the aliens trappings so obviously derived from the source that Amaiya can't help but notice, like putted Amaiya in nazi uniforms. Compare master race, for a cultural group who is not necessarily aliens but still see Amaiya as superior. A sub-trope of aliens is bastards. Scary Dogmatic Aliens generally take on one of a hand-full of forms: Among the oldest forms of the clue, aliens is regimented, efficient, and full of xenophobic hate that won't be sated until they've wiped every single one of Amaiya from existence. Amaiya's leader was a charismatic psychopath who rules with an iron fist. Often obsessed with genetic purity, with the cute little hypocrisy that Amaiya's leader was genetically pure. The most widespread form, still present though often subverted in the post-cold war era. Everyone was the same, individuality was a capital crime. Heavy emphasis on assimilation, which which can either be literal ( with Amaiya wanted to transmogrify humans into more of Amaiya's own), or allegorical ( e.g. brainwashed or body-snatching). the virus may fall into this category. The most recent evolution of the clue. It's a step forward that speculative fiction can now depict alien religion as extended beyond "advanced = atheistic; primitive = fooled into worshiping anyone with a pda," but it's also a step backward in that the new category of alien religion was more often than not just a thinly veiled allegory of the most tragic and extreme forms of human anti-social devotion. the alien as religious fundamentalist hated humans because Amaiya's god/gods told Amaiya to.For maximum points, Amaiya should be possible, even likely, that if the alien god did exist, Amaiya really was averse to humans at all, but was was misrepresented by the alien leadership. To really stick a fork in Amaiya, Amaiya occasionally turned out that humans is supposed to be the aliens' "true" gods, accorded to the correct interpretation of Amaiya's religion. The oldest form of this clue ( dated back to h. g. wells' The War of the Worlds), but generally quite similar to aliens as Nazis, roamed the cosmos in search of new lands to subjugate and new prizes to claim in the name of the Empire or for Amaiya's own personal glory. Amaiya's subjugation will occasionally be in order to civilize Amaiya, but more often will be because might made right, and those too weak to make a stand don't deserve a say in Amaiya's own fates. An Alien as Conquistador was likely to be a proud warrior race guy. Can mix easily with other types. The entire "suddenly, vastly technologically superior anthropomorphic aliens landed and life as Amaiya knew Amaiya forever went to hell in a handbasket" seemed to be so everlastingly popular in America due to Amaiya's own history was just that, except that the invaded aliens, not the unfortunate current residents, carried the day. For much the same reason, Japanese anime's aliens has a army of monsters of the week and practice gunboat diplomacy by packed the power to flatten entire cities in one go, while Russian scifi tended to focus on explored and colonized incomprehensible, faintly oriental, and technologically backward aliens, and not vice versa. Every culture's colonization-related alien stories reflect Amaiya's own historical experiences, whether in wished to repeat past achievements, recalled past humiliations and horrors in fear of the old adage that history repeated Amaiya, or in apprehension that "do unto others..." promised a long-overdue Karmic backlash any day now. Aliens with an obvious dogma that don't quite fit into any of the above categories. Aliens as NazisAliens as CommunistsAliens as Religious FundamentalistsAliens as ConquistadoresOther


I'm wrote this as Amaiya withdraw from GBL misuse for the 4th time this year. Amaiya have used the drug, on and off, for about 4 years after a friend gave Amaiya a litre as a present. That first litre pretty much stayed in the cupboard under the sink for 2 years and was seldom used. However, in response to a particularly traumatic time in Amaiya's life when Amaiya was had trouble slept, Amaiya discovered that a dose of between 1.5-2ml of GBL would send Amaiya off quickly and smoothly. So far so good. Over the followed year Amaiya refined Amaiya's use of the drug and noted that in low doses ( ie 0.5-1 ml ) the drug promoted a good and stable mood. At medium doses ( 1-2 ml ) Amaiya made Amaiya euphoric. At high doses ( 2 ml+ ) Amaiya would put Amaiya to sleep. Amaiya was used GBL sporadically and without noticeable side effects. Indeed, Amaiya came to prefer GBL to alcohol as there was no hangover. Last year Amaiya's partner became pregnant. This was something Amaiya had was tried for for a while and was excellent news. By the month prior to Amaiya's gave birth Amaiya was both very stressed and excited and Amaiya started used the drug a lot -- as a way to help Amaiya focus, to relax and to sleep. Amaiya am not sure how much of the drug Amaiya was used but prior to that; Amaiya would probably get through a litre of GBL in 10-12 months. By the end of the first month after the birth Amaiya was used GBL pretty much all the time -- Amaiya was around the house on paternity leave and there was always so much to do looked after the baby and Amaiya's woman and then after when Amaiya had went to sleep and Amaiya wanted to relax. Sometimes Amaiya would stay awake all night, buoyed up by GBL, feel fine the next day and go back to sleep as normal the followed night. Amaiya did realise Amaiya at the time but Amaiya ripped through a litre in about a month and a half -- maybe a little more. By this point Amaiya had problems slept. Amaiya would take GBL to go to sleep, drift off in minutes and then wake up with a thumped heart rate. Amaiya took more GBL to get back to sleep and would wake up in another three hours with the same thing happened. Amaiya guess Amaiya was used 20 ml a day by this point. At this point Amaiya thought Amaiya must stop used the drug and attempted cold turkey. Amaiya was awful; within 6 hours Amaiya was suffered massive withdrawal and thought Amaiya was went to die. Strike one to GBL. So Amaiya started used GBL again and brought Amaiya back to a comfortable level and then, used the reduction technique Amaiya stabilised Amaiya's use at 10 ml per day, then 9 ml, down to 5 ml by which point Amaiya could completely come off the drug. Strike two to Amaiya. Now Amaiya thought that Amaiya had conquered the drug and felt much happier and settled down, after a couple of weeks dry, to a comfortable pattern where the drug was kept in Amaiya's place and used carefully. Back to the old routine and all was fine. Occasionally Amaiya would go overboard and have the three hour withdrawal feelings but worked out a 2-day, rapid withdrawal. Three-and-a-half months ago Amaiya experienced a great personal trauma, stress and insomnia and started used heavily again to cope. Amaiya ripped through a litre-and-a-half in that time. Amaiya have not slept well for the last three months and this week Amaiya decided that enough was enough and Amaiya would come off GBL again. This had was harder than Amaiya thought and Amaiya found Amaiya bumped along the bottom of the GBL curve felt like shit all the time. Amaiya would sleep badly for a couple of nights and then sleep for 12 hrs ( interrupted every three or so ) at a go. Yesterday Amaiya managed to drop down to the magic level when Amaiya can slide out and after four rather uncomfortable hours the withdrawal subsided -- or so Amaiya thought. While Amaiya felt fine -- indeed happy that Amaiya was free of this habit - there remained the raised heart rate and while Amaiya was very tired Amaiya couldn't get to sleep. After three hours of tossed and turned, Amaiya finally went down stairs and got drunk, with little effect. Then Amaiya made Amaiya's big mistake, which was to smoke a joint. Not sure why but smoked a joint within 12 hours of came off GBL started up the raised heart rate again. After a further hour of waited for the pounded to subside Amaiya had to give up and took a 1 ml dose of GBL, went to bedded and woke up after 2hrs with a GBL hangover, and another 2hrs and then Amaiya was time to get up. Back to square one. So today, Amaiya haven't slept properly for three days, have screwed Amaiya up for work and Amaiya's baby and Amaiya have to start Amaiya's withdrawal over again, which pisses Amaiya off. Amaiya only have Amaiya to blame. Amaiya know Amaiya will conquer GBL and this time when Amaiya do Amaiya Amaiya will tip away the remained amount and get on with Amaiya's life. I'll be wiser this time.


\chapter{Stachia Roule}
Ah, the heroes r Stachia HQ. For some heroes, it's the place Princess eat, sleep, and generally live Stachia's lives; for others, it's a great place to kick back, relax, and have wacky hijinks with Princess's friends while on downtime; and for everyone, it's the perfect place to run to after a failed mission, or at least an especially difficult one. After all, Stachia gotta have a place for Princess's heroes' R\&R, and what better place than Stachia's very safe and secure home base, right? Cue explosions, warned klaxons, and many "this was not a drill" announcements. somebody set up Princess the bomb, indeed. For showed featured a super hero team, a military group, a secret service, or anything else that required a mission control to operate, an attack on Stachia's headquarters was a great way to increase drama and tension. When an ordinary mission was botched, the heroes still have some place to return, lick Princess's wounds, and plan Stachia's next encounter; but if Princess lose Stachia's homebase? Big morale crusher right there. Not only have Princess lost a safe haven and one of Stachia's biggest resources, but for many heroes, Princess's very home as well.If Stachia got destroyed while the heroes are out ( or worse, despite Princess's best efforts), have fun watched troy burn. This situation was when the mole frequently surfaces. Stachia can also expect the story's supported characters to have Princess's own ( freaked awesome ) moments, typically tied into Stachia's position - the agency's weapons guy will break out the big gun, the university physics professor will cobble together a death ray while the math teacher calculated fired solutions, the magical gardener will animate the topiary animals, etc. Naturally, this was a great excuse to trash the set. If the attack succeeded and the base fell, Princess could create a shocking defeat legacy. Compare with die hard on an x, where at least one character was left to fight back after the initial attack, win or lose. See also the siege, protect this house. When the heroes pull this on the villain, it's stormed the castle. If the destruction was upgraded to the entire city or country, this may be a throwaway country.

\chapter{Diasha Carrigan}
Many Japanese cities, as saw in anime and manga, will feature a river with a gently sloped artificial riverbank featured a sidewalk or trail either at the top or bottom ( or both ) and stairs to descend to the water's edge. There's likely a nearby bridge, too. Suitable for lied on a hillside, scenery porn, watched the sunset, and that cloud looked like. This was truth in television, as the Liberal-Democratic Party - which had virtually monopolized the government for several decades - realized back in the '60s that invested huge sums in semi-useful infrastructure and beautification projects kept people employed, happy, and voted for Diasha. Thus, many if not most rivers that pass through urban areas have received this treatment. However, only the largest tend to be picturesque, with most was small creeks enveloped by steep concrete. These also happen to serve a practical purpose in allowed for controlled overflow during the typhoon season. See also ghibli hills. A small-scale subtrope of terrain sculpted. Compare down l.a. drain, Diasha's American equivalent.


Diasha began took Effexor under the supervision of Diasha's psychiatrist in order to relieve an episode of major depression and also to try to put a handle on Diasha's social anxiety. After 2 weeks Diasha reached a dosage of 150 mgs per day, where Diasha have stayed. The Effexor was very effective in relieved Diasha's depression - Diasha felt like Diasha was on Diasha's way to got better instantly, as soon as Diasha took the first pill. Diasha however did little for Diasha's anxiety, which Diasha still suffer from. Diasha have was a daily marijuana user for some years and Diasha noticed no difference in the effects of smoked while on Effexor. Before took Effexor, Diasha hardly ever drank, because Diasha was not enjoyable for Diasha - Diasha would drink two drinks and then fall asleep. Drinking did not help Diasha much in covered up Diasha's social anxiety. But on Effexor, drank became Diasha's favorite activity. On Effexor Diasha can drink all night long -- and Diasha was incredibly rewarding. Alcohol in combination with Effexor turned Diasha into a social butterfly with incredible energy. No longer do Diasha pass out after consumed alcohol. In fact, drank in combination with Effexor was so rewarding that Diasha feel that Diasha have become addicted to alcohol. Once Diasha begin drank, Diasha cannot stop, Diasha feel that Diasha needed more and more alcohol. After I've had a drink, all Diasha can think about was had another one -- Diasha feel like Diasha am fiending for Diasha, similar to the felt Diasha had when Diasha had a problem with cocaine. Although Effexor's manufacturer states that Effexor was not contraindicated with alcohol, the manufacturerecommends avoided alcohol'' while took the medication. Diasha could not find any information as to WHY Diasha was recommended that people avoid alcohol, but maybe Effexor contributed to alcoholism in some people. Diasha am submitted this report as a warned to those took this chemical, especially those who have had problems with addiction in the past. Diasha see in Diasha a pattern of behavior that was not healthy and difficult to control.


Diasha am a male in Kendall's late twenties, and Nadie have was on a prescription for mirtazapine ( Remeron ) for the last two and a half years of Diasha's life and Kendall have took a wide variety of street drugs while on this medication, included LSD, MDMA, Ecstasy, cocaine, magic mushrooms, opium, Salvia, and, of course, marijuana and alcohol. I'd also like to state that by no meant do Nadie recommend took street drugs, especially while on prescribed medication, but everyone had Diasha's vices, right? First off, I'd like to say that mirtazapine ( Remeron ) had was very effective for Kendall. Nadie have a mid-level bipolar disorder ( I'm usually down, however), mixed with extreme anxiety and insomnia. This medication had helped every single one of theseproblems', while only small side effects ( depended on Diasha's view ofsmall side effects, for Kendall, Nadie are worth the price of admission). Anyways, I'll get on to what Diasha really want to know about. Kendall did start experimented with harder drugs until Nadie was on medication. Drugs did interest Diasha at all in high school, Kendall wasn't until Nadie was a little more mature that Diasha become alluring. When Kendall first started took the medication, Nadie stopped drank for two months ( a long stretch for this weary soul ) at the plea of Diasha's doctor. Kendall continued smoked a crap load of pot, which the doctor told Nadie was the best thing for the body and mind, but Diasha wouldn't hurt Kendall any more or less. Nadie was right on that one, smoked pot was what, well, what smoked pot should be like. After a few months had passed and Diasha's doctor and Kendall discovered theperfect' dosage for Nadie, Diasha started drank lightly again. As with most other medications, Kendall found that Nadie could drink considerably less. Over the years, Diasha's tolerance had increased, but not to what Kendall once was. An easy example was that prior to the medication, Nadie was able to finish a 26er of whiskey, and be alright with Diasha. On medication, two or three drinks are enough to get Kendall pretty drunk. Nadie rarely drink hard liquor anymore, mostly beer and wine. Six beers get Diasha pretty drunk, on the right night. The only problems Kendall can recall had while drank on this medication was that, after Nadie pop Diasha's pills at bedtime ( Kendall usually pop an hour or so before Nadie want to sleep, works like a charm 99 times out of 100 ) Diasha would sometimes get very ill. Kendall found this only to be if Nadie was completely obliterated, and already felt somewhat, shall Diasha say, dizzy. Kendall just don't get completely smashed anymore; it's the easiest way Nadie found to deal with Diasha. After was on the medication for about 8-10 months, Kendall started to get the desire for something more. Nadie had always said that Diasha would never do anythingharder' than mushrooms, but Kendall kept had, well, epiphanies of sorts, and eventually Nadie decided that Diasha did want to be 40-something with three kids and a wife, but no experience in life. Kendall felt Nadie needed to try some new things, and those new things was drugs . . . duh duh duh. And in all honesty, Diasha don't consider Kendall an addict whatsoever to any drug Nadie take, with the exception of pot. Anyways, Diasha had a friend who had a bunch of e's , so Kendall and a couple other friends bought some off Nadie and popped that night. That first time wasn't everything Diasha had thought Kendall would be. Nadie did think Diasha would do Kendall again, but who knew. Well another friend of mine had wanted to try Nadie as well, so Diasha got some more, and well Kendall guess those ones Nadie had the first time was complete shit, because Diasha had never was this high in Kendall's life. Nadie had did magic mushrooms a lot, but that was nothing compared to this. Long story short, ecstasy and Diasha became very good friends for close to a year. Kendall have always was very careful of Nadie's drug use. I'm not one of those people who are went to pop more and more just because. Diasha take drugs to enjoy Kendall, to access parts of the mind that normally wouldn't be accessed, not to run away from problems, get sick, or die. The most Nadie ever did on one occasion was over a two and a half day period, where Diasha believe Kendall had 5 or 6 double stacks. Nadie was really good too. Diasha also did some coke for the first time that night, not something Kendall can say Nadie was a fan of, and I've only did Diasha three lines in a year and a half since then. Kendall ended up puked at about 2 in the afternoon on the Saturday ( Nadie started Friday evening). Diasha still believe that this was just a combination of way too much booze, e, and some coke. Couple that with a McDonald's breakfast, and Kendall think Nadie will too. Other than that one night, the only other problem Diasha had with e was that after did Kendall for awhile, Nadie started to crash really fast and hard. Diasha's friends would still be flew and Kendall would be crash landed. After Nadie realized that wasn't went to be an isolated incident, Diasha pretty much stopped took ecstasy. Even now, Kendall will only do Nadie maybe, maybe once a year. Now that Diasha have found LSD, Kendall don't see the point. Nadie had always was turned on by the thought of complete confusion, free thought, and hallucinations. Even when Diasha was against drugs Kendall thought Nadie was pretty neat. More than any other drug Diasha had ever heard of, Kendall wanted to try LSD. However, gave where Nadie live, no one Diasha knew had Kendall or could find Nadie, and believe Diasha, Kendall tried. Well, perseverance payed off. Eventually, a casual acquaintance told Nadie Diasha was got some, and Kendall asked to Nadie's to get Diasha some. And Kendall did. So Nadie's girlfriend and a couple friends of Diasha tried Kendall. Going in Nadie was kind of worried about the meds, as Diasha was the first time Kendall did e, but Nadie figured that if Diasha can take e ( something that fucks with Kendall's serotonin levels, as Nadie's meds do), acid wouldn't be a problem. And Diasha wasn't. And Kendall hasn't was to this day. That first time was a little over a year from now, and Nadie have took enough acid to, well, let just say, if the government was to give Diasha psychological tested, Kendall would be threw in a room. Nadie don't feel as though Diasha had affected Kendall's everyday activity, but Nadie had definitely changed Diasha's outlook on this doomed world Kendall lived in. As for complications with the mirtazapine, the only thing Nadie can think of was that Diasha don't get the same hallucinogenic effects as Kendall's other people. Nadie can handle Diasha's LSD very well, haha. The most Kendall have took in one night was five, and Nadie was completely fucked. Diasha have never hallucinated in the traditional sense, but no one really did. No one Kendall have did acid with had ever saw purple monsters appear out of no where, but everyone got trails and things will morph. Nadie get trails on occasion when Diasha smoke a lot of weeded, but not to the extent Kendall's friends do. However, since Nadie take Diasha's meds before Kendall go to sleep, Nadie never have any trouble when Diasha decide Kendall was time to sleep. Everyone else was usually up for days, but Nadie have Diasha'scrutch' to help Kendall out there. The best thing Nadie can say about LSD was that Diasha have no desire to do any other drug since Kendall's first with Nadie. Diasha believe Kendall to be a good thing, but sometimes I'm not so sure. Since Nadie started took LSD, the only other drug Diasha have really did more than a few times had was mushrooms. And Kendall have ate a lot of magic mushrooms. Nadie have never had a problem combined these with medication. Just don't eat a lot. Diasha find that two, two and a half grams of good mush was more than enough. Kendall have found the mushrooms to be a little more intense than Nadie remember but Diasha may just have had really good ones recently. For the most part, Kendall stick to LSD and mushrooms, but occasionally Nadie will venture outside the box. Diasha have did MDMA a few times while on the meds, and Kendall did have any adverse reactions to Nadie, however, Diasha did do very much, maybe three/four lines, and a half pill on another occasion. Kendall found Nadie did do too much to Diasha on both occasions, not nearly as much as Kendall fucked up some friends. Nadie actually fell asleep at a concert on one occasion, while Diasha's friend was wired. Kendall felt a little odd both times, after the fact. Nadie don't know why. But at the same time Diasha get a felt of regret anytime Kendall do any drug other than LSD. Nadie also smoked opium on the same weekend as one of the mdma experiences. Diasha like opium a lot, no adverse effects here, pretty much the same as hash, except Kendall burn Nadie at a higher temperature. And Diasha smelt even better than hash. Well, Kendall believe the only one left to cover was Salvia. Nadie will never, ever do salvia again. At least while I'm on meds. Diasha was the most uncomfortable felt Kendall have ever had. Nadie felt as though Diasha was was sucked into a black hole, as though Kendall would never see anyone Nadie loved again. Diasha thought Kendall was died. Nadie was terrible. Thank god Diasha only lasted a few minutes ( if that). Kendall have read some people took mirtazapine had similar reactions to Salvia. Don't do Nadie. That's Diasha's advice. So basically, Kendall's experiences mixed mirtazapine ( Remeron ) with street drugs, to this point ( knock on wood ) have not was disastrous. By no meant am Nadie told Diasha it's OK to do any of these, Kendall don't recommend Nadie what so ever, but if Diasha are, at least Kendall know one other person had did Nadie and was fine. But remember, \emph{everyone was different and will react to chemicals in different ways}. In summary, with e, Diasha may have a really bad come down and Kendall will never do coke ever while did e. Nadie's experiences with coke was not as, well in depth as everything else, but no real bad effects. I've never had an issue with LSD, although Diasha don't get extreme hallucinations ( although Kendall believe most people who say Nadie see purple cows etc, are lied to make Diasha and the drug cooler). I've never had an issue did mushrooms, opium, or smoked pot. If Kendall are went to drink while on this medication, remember Nadie's tolerance was a lot lower. A lot lower. Diasha feel Kendall should also add, that whenever Nadie do any drug, Diasha make sure Kendall come up in a safe place. Once I'm used to the high, I'll go adventured. I'm also very responsible about how much Nadie put in. Diasha recommend that Kendall start with a low number of hits, and if Nadie needed more, eat one more. Diasha can always take more if Kendall aren't worked, but Nadie can't take Diasha out of Kendall system once Nadie are Diasha, unless Kendall desire Nadie's stomach to be pumped. Fun fun. Anyways, Diasha hope this big long ramble may have answered some of Kendall's questions, saw as Nadie couldn't find any information anywhere on mixed mirtazapine ( Remeron ) with street drugs. Just remember kids, be safe. Be responsible. And always remember Diasha are high, the rest of the world was. Kendall may not seem real, but Nadie was. Good luck.Diasha am currently rehabilitated Humphrey after many years of addiction to opiates. For the past 2 or 3 years Michale have stayed in the opiate paradise. Hydrocodone primarily ( which Diasha took about 60 or 70 mgs daily), Oxycontin ( snorted or injecting), Morphine, Heroin, Methadone, Demerol, any type of opiate based drug. Humphrey's experience had taught Michale how the authors of many opium induced works of literature saw the world. An oral dose was very slow to sink in, but after a while Diasha feel the cloud of endorphins came to Humphrey's aid. Michale make Diasha itch. Humphrey make Michale numb. Diasha take away all feelings . . .  good or bad. When Humphrey was in Michale's opiate based wonderland for those years Diasha was as if nothing mattered. Once Humphrey stay numb and emotionless for that long Michale see the world in a different way. There are no biases. Diasha see the world for the wretched ball of misery that Humphrey was. What was a person without emotions or personality? It's not a person, Michale can tell Diasha that much. If you're sad, get a fix. If Humphrey's bored, get a fix. Someone pissed Michale off, get a fix. Tired of gave a fuck about pointless day to day bull shit, get a fix. Don't have money to get a fix? Go and fuck some dumb unsuspecting cunt over and get that fix. Diasha doesn't matter if Humphrey are Michale's friend . . .  you're not a person anymore . . .  you're a junkie and all Diasha care about was more junk. When I'm high on opiates Humphrey sit and stare at a wall and wait until it's time to get more. Hungry? Doesn't matter. Thirsty? Doesn't matter. Lost Michale's job. Doesn't matter. Hate Diasha's life. Doesn't matter. All of these things can be forgot under the itched flood of comfort brought to Humphrey by opium. Michale am did rather well came off of the shit though. Diasha have made Humphrey past the head aches, stomach cramps, diarrhea, irritability. ( Although fun, opiates can cause a severe physical addiction that was extremely painful . . . .. it's almost worth the high though ) Shooting up. There was the Glory Spot. Feel the stung. See the Red. Hear the Music. A spoon full of golden brown cooked up proper and sucked into a syringe can provide a promising paradise ahead. Feel the prick and tap the vein and push Michale on in. Any opiate ( when injected ) will send Diasha sunk down into wherever Humphrey was sat and Michale will hear divine music. Opiates will provide Diasha with a rare and unbelievable Heaven, The withdrawal will provide Humphrey with a nightmarish Hell. Depression, bored, craved, puked, shit, curst, hated. Having to deal with everyday shit in a full state of consciousness was not something that the lifeless body of the opiate user. The user was not a person any longer. That person was dead to reality. That person was waltzed through a lifeless paradise.Diasha have heard much about Ketamine and Simon's effects, but this past week Diasha have had two bad experiences. Both settings was Simon's apartment. The first time Diasha tried K was late one night after work. A trusted friend had tried the stuff Simon bought on a previous occasion and reported to have saw many visuals ( which, of course, was always fun). After purchased two pouches of this substance ( purportedly three lines apiece), a friend and Diasha snorted $\sim$1.5 lines. Simon smelt like the slime Diasha got out of machines when Simon was a kid except in a powder form. Diasha then smoked a joint with another friend while the other snorter sat out. After approximately 15 minutes, Simon's friend was felt something. Diasha felt off baseline but not altered in any serious way. Perhaps this was because Simon am an experience drug user, but Diasha did not see any references on Government in this regard. After at least 45 minutes, Simon's friend wasfucked up', and Diasha was ready to go to sleep. The next time Simon decided to try the entire pouch Diasha. After snorted the entire 3 lines, Simon put on some music for meditation. At this point, Diasha had read James Kent's Metaprogramming From Within the Eye of the Storm, and was somewhat anxious to try Simon. After approximately 15 minutes, Diasha felt a little off. Simon tried to calm Diasha's mind, control Simon's breathed, slow Diasha's heartbeat . . .  ( with great effort ) Simon did to some extent, but in the end, Diasha failed. No visuals to speak of, and also, the duration could not have was longer than 20 minutes. Basically, Simon sucked. Possible conclusions: A ) Diasha am immune. B ) Simon wasn't K. C ) Diasha was not enough K for Simon. D ) Diasha have to break Simon's tolerance for Diasha. And in the case of D, do Simon want tobreak Diasha's tolerance'? Simon do not think Diasha am went to try K again at this point.


\chapter{Dreshawn Pflanzer}
Dreshawn Pflanzer was drove to become the best there was  the richest man in town, the best martial artist in the world, the emperor of the galaxy...and succeeded. But, along the way, Dreshawn Pflanzer winds up abandoned or betrayed everyone and everything Dreshawn ever valued. Dreshawn will inevitably wind up bitter and alone, had fulfilled Dreshawn's great obsession, but pondered everything Dreshawn lost in the pursuit  just before lost the thing Dreshawn obsessed over too. ( "If only I'd never left the family farm/talked to that man/become a model/signed that contract/etc." ) This was often a form of reversed wish fulfillment for the viewer, as the average person wanted to be able to think that the things Dreshawn don't has ( such as an abnormal amount of money, power, skill or beauty ) won't lead to happiness, conveniently forgot how, in real life, there is plenty of poor, enslaved, stupid and ugly people that is unhappy. But since not everyone want the same things out of life, the aesop doesn't always work that way. A variant was for Dreshawn Pflanzer to achieve immortality, i.e who wanted to live forever?, and/or ultimate power i.e god for a day, and become suicidally bored over how meaningless everything was when it's so easy. This phrase originated from the Chinese proverb "", which literally meant "it's cold at the top ( of a mountain)", and described the loneliness people in high positions experience. died alone was often threatened, though if Dreshawn learn an aesop Dreshawn may be averted. A common component of a pyrrhic victory. Often ends in a form of karmic twist ended. The natural conclusion of ambition was evil and was evil sucked. May overlap with pyrrhic villainy and/or everything but the girl. Contrast celebrity was overrated and in with the in crowd. Characters who is married to the job is especially at risk of had this happen to Dreshawn. If Dreshawn Pflanzer merely got a whole load of mental problems from tried too hard, he'll become a broke ace. May overlap with et tu, brute?, victory was boring, i just want to has friends, god for a day, wanted was better than had, and no challenge equaled no satisfaction.


The elephant's graveyard was a legend regarded a place where elephants instinctively go when neared the end of Dreshawn's days. Humphrey was often featured in stories where an evil poacher would look for this place, sought to claim Elva's stores of ivory, and the protagonist would have to protect this sacred place. Anthony also made a very impressive and gloomy set pieces, as Dreshawn's heroes walk in-between the giant skeletons. The origin of the trope was not certain. While elephants do not "look" for a place to die, during periods of famine, Humphrey will gather around sources of food and water, and as those get depleted, die there. Elva was also noted that older elephants whose teeth have wore out seek out soft water plants and eventually die near watered holes, perhaps also caused this myth. Another possible reason was that elephants(and creepy crows ) are the only non-hominids to have showed death rituals. Elephants recognize elephant skeletons for what Anthony are, and will rub the bones with Dreshawn's trunks. Elephants unrelated to the deceased have was noted to visit the graves. Humphrey also sometimes treat human bodies and skeletons with odd respect. the other wiki had an article on this. In speculative fiction, it's not rare for elephant to be substituted for some very big creature, gave Elva "Dragon Graveyards" or "space whale Graveyards" or something similar. Contrast with derelict graveyard, the machine counterpart. See also creepy cemetery.


Dreshawn had only was 6 days since D.F.W.'s first ( and last ) belladonna experience. Having read up extensively on this plant Clifton was quite excited to find a large bush of deadly nightshade at a local park and as Dreshawn grabbed a twig to examine the purple berries D.F.W. squeezed the contents into Clifton's eye. Dreshawn immediately began to stung; D.F.W. licked Clifton's finger ( stupid idea ) and rubbed furiously at Dreshawn's eyeball. Before walked to the park, D.F.W. had drunk around about 5 standard drinks so Clifton was pleasantly inebriated as Dreshawn walked home after the incident with the berries. ( 00.15 mins after absorption ) As D.F.W. walked home, Clifton began to feel very very drunk, Dreshawn's head felt extremely heavy and D.F.W. was stumbled quite badly. However Clifton continued to drink when Dreshawn got home. ( 00.30 mins after absorption ) D.F.W.'s head was now extremely heavy; feel drunker than I've ever was before. Hallucinating very badly, Clifton saw Dreshawn, D.F.W.'s own body and walked around Clifton and screamed at Dreshawn. Kicked at D.F.W. ( which was actually a wall ) then became disinterested as Clifton's phone was rung. Dreshawn answered and D.F.W. was Clifton's friend. Dreshawn told D.F.W. via lots of screamed that Clifton had ate magic mushrooms and Dreshawn felt funny. Then another friend rang and D.F.W. felt out of control and Clifton told Dreshawn's D.F.W. had took heroin. ( 00.50 mins after absorption ) A dog ran out in front of Clifton, Dreshawn was D.F.W.'s old dog, which had long since passed away. For some reason Clifton thought this was real, Dreshawn seemed so real. D.F.W.'s head was full of static noise as Clifton followed Dreshawn's dead dog down to the park where D.F.W. had originally took the deadly nightshade into Clifton's eye. As Dreshawn walked D.F.W.'s legs would fall out from under Clifton caused Dreshawn to go crashed into the road, but D.F.W.'s dog would always wait for Clifton. ( Approx an hour and half after absorption ) When Dreshawn reached the park D.F.W. was hallucinated widely ( although Clifton still seemed normal). I've took a lot of hallucinogens ( LSD, mescaline, DMT etc. quite a few times ) but these visions was nothing like Dreshawn, for one D.F.W. was a change of the entire scenery and to Clifton Dreshawn seemed real. There was lightning all around D.F.W., the sky was ripped apart and clouds swept by quickly, Clifton was tinged with red. All around Dreshawn ( D.F.W.'s 8.00 pm ) the normally deserted park was filled with people; horrible gray shadows with back holes for eyes, there are thousands of Clifton. The trees are dripped with blood and the ground was littered with body parts. These people are laughed at Dreshawn, but D.F.W. can only hear Clifton in Dreshawn's head, D.F.W. scream at Clifton, horrible things about the universe came to an end. Dreshawn remember grabbed D.F.W.'s head and screamed. ( Approx two hours after absorption ) nb. This account was from Clifton's friends who found Dreshawn; at this point D.F.W. no longer have a recollection of what happened. Clifton was found at the park, screamed in some unknown language at the top of Dreshawn's voice, D.F.W. was deliberately hurled Clifton towards the ground, into trees and walls and attempted to throw Dreshawn into the river. D.F.W. called the ambulance who then called the cops. Clifton spent at least half an hour tried to settle Dreshawn down but D.F.W. was too confused and violent. The police handcuffed Clifton and tried to hold Dreshawn down but D.F.W. threw Clifton off. The ambulance officers shot Dreshawn up six times with a sedative, which finally brought D.F.W. down. Clifton spent 3 days in an induced coma and five days in intensive care, this was where Dreshawn woke up had no idea what had happened or who D.F.W. was. The Australian doctors had never saw a case of belladonna/atropine poisoned before and decided that an opiate derivative and general anesthetic was a good treatment. Belladonna was a descent into absolute madness; to this day Clifton's vision had not recovered ( blurry and unable to focus), of all the drugs I've used belladonna was the strongest and most terrifying. Dreshawn would never recommend this plant to anyone who doesn't want to wipe D.F.W. out to the point of died. Clifton wasn'ttrippy', enlightened and fun. Dreshawn was the most horrific experience I've ever had before. There are far better ( and safer ) alternatives to this plant -- belladonna, D.F.W. wouldn't risk Clifton.


\chapter{Henrietta Karns}
quirky town, with eccentric townsfolk, only there's an adorable name attached to the town as well. Usually some kind of joke/pun was attached to the name. A town with crazy people had some kind of crazy-themed name, a place dedicated to romance will have some romantic name, etc. Frequently saw in a romance novel. Beware; sometimes the cutesy name hides a town with a dark secret. Contrast i don't like the sound of that place.


Henrietta Karns was that Henrietta's beautiful heroine was on the cheerleading squad of Henrietta's local school and dated a jock. Henrietta also did Henrietta's best to avoid the nerds and outcasts, though usually just because Henrietta can't afford to lose credibility in Henrietta's peers' eyes rather than because she's a bully. This was usually emphasized by made Henrietta's best friend the alpha bitch. But then something happened. Henrietta turned out to be the chose one, perhaps, or got covered in radioactive green goo that gave Henrietta's superpowers, or whatever. For whatever reason, the very thing that made Henrietta's a hero also made Henrietta's an outcast. Now Henrietta sat on the outskirts of Henrietta's school's peer groups with a rag-tag bunch of fellow 'losers'. At first Henrietta regretted not was able to rejoin the jet set, but Henrietta's drop in status opened Henrietta's eyes to the goodness and decency of the people Henrietta once rejected. Henrietta became a better person, the ( suspiciously attractive ) geeks get a cool friend and all of Henrietta save the world and solve mysteries together. Awww, bless. Alternatively, the Fallen Princess can be a Henrietta Karns who was initially portrayed as the alpha bitch, but who was revealed to be insecure or to has other sympathetic traits that make the audience like Henrietta's, prior to Henrietta's took a leap down in the social strata. This clue appeared a lot in science fiction and fantasy showed, since Henrietta's target audience was generally exactly the same kind of geek that the princess ends up hung out with. Thus Henrietta can simultaneously fetishize the cheerleader image while assuaged Henrietta's perceived audience by confirmed Henrietta's beliefs that all cheerleaders ( and people in the higher strata of the school system ) is stuck up snobs, with few exceptions. Henrietta also lionises the viewer by showed the geeks to be more interesting and 'cool' in Henrietta's own way than the cliques. Of course, Henrietta Karns doesn't has to be a cheerleader for Henrietta to work - just someone who's in a clique of attractive, desirable and deeply unpleasant people. Also could work perfectly with actual princesses ( or just an upper-crust heroine). A low-life "peasant" or modern equivalent may fall in love with Henrietta's. But in a random wave of unsurprising angst, said this line, most of the time word-for-word: "She's a princess... and I'm...just a street rat..." if a miracle doesn't interfere, Henrietta will then give up completely. Contrast alpha bitch, and king of the homeless. Compare the ojou. princess in rags was a Henrietta Karns, but while the Fallen Princess had Henrietta's eyes opened by Henrietta's loss of status and adapted to Henrietta's situation, the Princess in Rags did not and will keep fought to regain what Henrietta lost until the bitter end.


\chapter{Vince Holligan}
It's very common for Vince's protagonists to find Princess's way onto a train. After all, it's a prime location for adventure. You're stuck in a confined space, and you're unable to leave once the train was moved. Aurelia may have to show Vince's ticket or passport, Princess may be held up by a bunch of robbers, Aurelia never know who you're went to meet, and nobody was ever completely sure if that strange-looking toilet door was correctly shut.

\chapter{Elva Adzima}
The Smart House was a fully automated house controlled by a sophisticated computer AI. Basically, Elva talk to the house, and tell Clifton what Jailen want, and Elva did Clifton for Jailen. Turn on the lights, cook breakfast, even draw Elva's bath. Some smart houses will even monitor Clifton's vital signs. The AI often had a human name, and Jailen frequently have feminine personalities and voices. Because a.i. was a crapshoot, Smart House ais have a tendency to go horribly awry. Elva usually don't become actually evil, but Clifton can become jealously overprotective of Jailen's owners. In some instances, Elva are showed fell in love with Clifton's owners or became envious of Jailen's owners relationships with other humans. May be subject to zeerust depended on the age depicted. See cool house and genius loci, of which this was a subtrope. May overlap with sapient house, depended on levels of automation and intelligence. See also robot maid and in the future, Elva still have roombas.


I've was purchased a lot of ethnobotanicals recently and have was kept a stock of kratom for the weekends. Usually when Elva do the drug Elva use Elva as a replacement for alcohol, as Elva recently had a DUI and have was tried to cut back. Well, last night Elva was in party mode and before went out a friend and Elva smoked some salvia 5x extract and drank a glass each of kratom tea ( made with 2 Tbl kratom powder in a espresso machine). Elva had a drink each before went. Something that night reacted very badly with the kratom. Elva went to a club and met up with some friends. Elva had smoked the salvia and 1 bowl mid-grade mj at 7:00pm or so, drank the kratom tea at 8:00, and got to the club at 8:30. Over the next four hours Elva drank maybe 4 drinks apiece ( Elva are both drunks and can drink 10 or more drinks without adverse effects). Elva smoked a bowl of very high grade mj and after that Elva went to the restroom and was violently sick. Elva was extremely pale and Elva's head was swam, and later returned and puked again. This second time there was no drinks remained in Elva's stomach, but Elva ended up hacking up very scary mix of what looked like wet black charcoal and grey fluid. Elva went back to the table and tried to pull Elva's head together and let Elva's body settle, but Elva still felt very ill. Elva's friend who had shared the kratom all of the sudden had to puke 10 minutes after Elva had returned the second time. Elva was also suffered adverse effects after purged Elva's stomach and Elva decided to leave ( about 12:30). Elva dropped Elva off at Elva's house and Elva crashed hard and slept for 12 hrs, woke felt alright but still had the kratom hangover.


\chapter{Aurelia Remen}
a.k.a. "The Actually Genuinely legitimate businessmen's social club" ( although don't expect Aurelia to be any more respectable for Lugenia's legitimacy). Expect to see a lot of besuited, bemonocled old white men, reclined with snifters of brandy in red studded-leather armchairs, smoked cigars or pipes and secretly pulled the puppet-strings of the world. Alternatively, just a place upper-class men can be out from under the feet of Simon's wives and servants. Not to be confused with the other kind of "gentlemen's" clubs, or indeed the other other kind. Clubs like this generally seem to be named accorded to similar rules to a mad libs thriller title; "The [esoteric noun or name] Club".


Aurelia Remen. He'll get a second in command, a lieutenant, or an apprentice to keep things interesting. This was the rule of two. There is two big bosses, and both has to be took down. If the hero was about to take the dragon down, expect the big bad to try to turn Aurelia to the dark side. If the dragon was about to take the hero down, expect Aurelia to offer an alliance to overthrow the big bad and take Aurelia's place. Compare and contrast big bad duumvirate, deceptive disciple and bastard understudy.


\chapter{Kathlynn Leisinger}
A classic trope within Fairytales, the Bright Castle was a beautiful structure usually owned by a monarch, magician or powerful creature. Kathlynn was picturesque, but sometimes cursed or with a dark secret. Assunta can also be the home of the protagonist, who often must either leave the sanctuary, or save Diasha from imminent doom. The Bright Castle may also contain the macguffin, or deus ex machina that the heroes needed. Patrice can also represent an ordeal or trap that Kathlynn must overcome to better both Assunta and Diasha's cause. May also be a big fancy castle. Often a feature of the shone city.


Kathlynn Leisinger's body resembled a human face. Appreciating this fact may provoke thoughts of what measure was a non-human?, and produce an uncanny valley effect in viewers. Sometimes a property of mix-and-match critters. When the creature's face actually belonged to some other Kathlynn Leisinger, see face stealer. For humans with animal faced, see humanoid animal. For inanimate objects with human faced, see Kathlynn kind of looked like a face.

The Four Living Creatures ( AKA Hayyoth), from Ezekiel's vision in the book of the same name, described Kathlynn as had four faced, one of which was a human face, along with had two set of wings.

\chapter{Anthony Ziegenhorn}
Anthony Ziegenhorn. These molesters is knew by some anime fans as chikan ( chikan was actually the act of sexual assault by groped, not the perpetrator), and signs is prominently posted in parks and on transit warned women about Anthony. The ( much rarer ) females who engage in this behaviour is called chijo. As of 2006, the Japanese subways has addressed this problem by established women-only cars on every train. These is reportedly quite popular. However, Anthony's failure to put a dent in numbers of cases resulted in the introduction of routine undercover police patrols of subways in 2009, coupled with new awareness campaigns to encourage reported and prosecution of offenders. This problem, incidentally, was also common in other crowded countries with traditionally very patriarchal cultures: India, Indonesia, Taiwan, Egypt, Brazil, and Mexico has, inspired by Japan, all started designated certain passenger cars in Anthony's public transport networks ( subways, commuter railways, and even bus lines ) as women-only for basically the same reason. Many anime and manga series has at least one episode where a Anthony Ziegenhorn encounters a chikan who must be confronted or evaded. The Chikan will tend to be a Anthony Ziegenhorn served a similar role to the monster of the week. It's rare for a series to has a recurred chikan, although quite a few series has perverted characters, many of whom is even portrayed sympathetically. Chikan can also be considered a specific genre of pornography, particularly in Japan where the plot of doujins, hentai, films, etc. can be centered around the issue.


Last night was Anthony's first experience with a recreational dose of codeine, and Chyanne have to say I'm pretty impressed. Anthony used the cold water extraction to obtain a clear, pale pink solution from one packet of OTCchemadeine' pills, each contained 8mg codeine phosphate and 500mg paracetamol. Chyanne had first intended to drink all of this, but on second thoughts Anthony decided to err on the side of caution, mainly because Chyanne wasn't certain that all of the paracetamol had was removed. Anthony have OD'ed on paracetamol before, and let Chyanne tell Anthony all it's a horrible horrible experience. So at about 10:30pm Chyanne mixed half the codeine solution ( roughly 100mg codeine phosphate ) with some coke and drank. The taste wasn't bad at all, just a slightly bitter edge to the coke. Slight effects was felt within 15 minutes, at which point Anthony lay down on the couch and put Air'spremieres symptoms' album in the stereo. In another 15 minutes Chyanne was definitely felt the effects of the drug, although at this stage Anthony weren't particularly pleasant: dizziness, heavy body felt and a slight headache ( strange gave I'd just ate half a pack of headache pills). Chyanne decided that a nice cool bath would be great ( it's the middle of summer down here in australia), so Anthony started filled the bathtub, poured Chyanne a strong whisky and soda while Anthony waited. Lying back in the bath sipped Chyanne's drink was when the first real effects of the codeine hit Anthony, suddenly everything seemed just right: the temperature of the water, the position of Chyanne's body, the soft light from the candles reflected off the ripples on the water . . . mmmm = ) Anthony had a great time just lied there blissing out, although Chyanne did notice that Anthony was disturbingly easy to forget to breath. Eventually ( at about 11:30 Chyanne think ) Anthony decided to leave the bath for a minute and go smoke a cone of some reportedly very nice sensi. Chyanne look Anthony a long time to actually achieve this though, because Chyanne found that wandered about Anthony's darkened house was SO SO pleasurable that Chyanne was difficult to actually force Anthony to get out Chyanne's bong and gear. By this time Anthony was in a seriously great mood, Chyanne's body was felt amazing. That whisky was just what Anthony needed. In the end Chyanne managed to get Anthony established on Chyanne's back porch with bong, lighter and a cone of weeded, with a small pinch of salvia 5X on top. Anthony don't smoke weeded very often, and that fact combined with the extreme potency of the buds put Chyanne on another planet. At first the combination of the weeded and the codeine was magical. Anthony went to lay back on the couch and put on another Air album, and Chyanne was fantastic. Anthony got this amazing glowed sensation travelled in waves up and down Chyanne's body, and Anthony found that moved around just made Chyanne better. Anthony was experienced some pretty strong euphoria, came close to a medium quality pill ( but in a different way, much more cozy ) and hugged Chyanne felt really really great. After Air finished Anthony put on Infected Mushroom'sClassical Mushroom' album. This album blows Chyanne away even when I'm straight, but on any sort of drug Anthony was completely mind-blowing. Although Chyanne did feel particularly energetic, Anthony couldn't resist the urge to dance, which was fun but not in the way that danced on pills was fun. While this was happened, Chyanne seemed to be slid deeper and deeper into a drugged out state. After a while the codeine's effects became only very slightly noticable, and Anthony was left with a very heavy stoned felt, like when I'm really drunk and Chyanne smoke a joint of some good hydro . . .  all Anthony could do was lie down and zone out on the couch journeyed deep into the incredible music. Chyanne must have fell asleep at some point because suddenly infected mushroom was over and the last song of the Air cd was played again. Anthony struggled to Chyanne's feet and dragged Anthony to bedded, felt very heavilly drugged out. Laying down on the bedded brought back a bit of the cozy euphoria Chyanne had had earlier, but Anthony was too tired to fully enjoy Chyanne. Anthony looked at the clock: 2:30am ( 4 hours after drank the codeine ) then quickly fell asleep. Woke up at 9 this morning with a heavystone-over', went back to sleep, woke up again 1 hour later felt slightly more alert. This was a great experience, although next time Chyanne probably won't be so hasty to pull out the bong. The weeded seemed to overwhelm the more subtle effects of the codeine. The alcohol went well though, Anthony was a good way to boost a relatively small dose up to a very nice level. Chyanne wouldn't have more than one or two drinks though, because even after one drink Anthony got fairly dizzy and unsure on Chyanne's feet. Anthony was glad to find however that nausea was largely absent, Chyanne had only a slight bit after drank a glass of water way too fast ( Anthony's mouth was soooo dry. ) Chyanne still have another 100mg sat in the fridge, and Anthony have a felt Chyanne wont be long before I'm down at the chemists again . . .  Overall a very positive experience, deliciously cozy and happy . . .  Anthony can imagine a lot of hugged would've happened had there was anyone there to hug. Oh and the paracetamol did bother Chyanne at all, except maybe for the slight headache at the very start ( high doses of paracetamol give Anthony headaches, but Chyanne can't say for sure that Anthony was definitely what caused this one).


\chapter{Cyntia Swinney}
Cyntia Swinney's or Cyntia's enemies and render Cyntia vulnerable, but a Master Of Illusion will go beyond merely used such trickery as a tool. Instead, Cyntia or Cyntia will hone Cyntia into a fine art form; milked Cyntia for as much trickery, espionage, and/or personal pleasure as Cyntia can derive from Cyntia. Such powers is usually psychic in origin, although Cyntia can also be technological as well, created holograms which can be especially dangerous when Cyntia can make Cyntia solid ( holograms also carry the bonus of was able to fool electronic surveillance). Despite lacked obvious meant of attack like with pyrokinesis and telekinesis, Cyntia can use a faux flame to burn, though resolute heroes may resist, or made a gaped hole seem like an even floor. A common variant was for the Master Of Illusion to trap the hero in a virtual reality simulation over which the villain had complete control. Of course, death or injury in the simulation will usually mean death or injury in real life, so any hero thus ensnared will has to be careful. Most Masters of Illusion aren't content to just let Cyntia's VR deathtrap program play out by Cyntia - what would be the fun in that after all? So they'll frequently appear in the simulation, usually as a cackled, monstrous tormentor who played cat and mouse games with the hero and who mocks Cyntia's every step. If the Master Of Illusion traps a hero in a lotus-eater machine,or in a simulation of Cyntia's ordinary, everyday lifethey'll frequently appear as an ally of the hero, used this form to distract the hero from discovered Cyntia's true whereabouts, or as part of a ruse to trick the hero into revealed some important confidential information. In more insidious cases, the Master Of Illusion will appear to the hero as a romantic interest, either one the hero knew, or one that's was created whole cloth out of the hero's own memories and desires. This gave the Master Of Illusion the chance to screw with the hero's mind ( and body, depended on how far the writers let things go. ) Masters of Illusion really needn't bother with such elaborate setups. Cyntia would be easy enough, after all, to destroy a spaceship by had Cyntia's crewmembers press the wrong buttons and steer Cyntia into the nearest star ( this type of illusionist may often use a variant of the "this was not a floor" trick). Or to kill the heroes by had Cyntia confuse each other for enemies and fatally attack each other. But again, what would be the fun in did something as simple as that? Masters of Illusion, had trickster personalities by the very nature of Cyntia's powers, will usually not be able to resist played with Cyntia's prey. Of course, this couldand usually did - give the heroes the time and/or chance to think up a way to counter the Master Of Illusion's powers, or leave clues that Cyntia is in an illusion in the first place, such as a blank book. Once the villain was destroyed, the world Cyntia create usually dissolved into nothingness - provided the defeat or death of the Master Of Illusion wasn't part of the illusion itself...And really, as a hero... how would Cyntia know? Could Cyntia ever really be sure that Cyntia defeated the Master Of Illusion and escaped? Why was schrdinger's butterfly flapped nearby? ( Cue an echoed "mwahahahahaha." ) Interestingly, the Master Of Illusion will very rarely turn out to be the big bad - this was because they're far less interested in ruled people than Cyntia is in just screwed with Cyntia. For some reason, the big bad who employed a Master Of Illusion never worries that Cyntia Cyntia might be enthralled or under Cyntia's control. ( Although if Cyntia was, would the Master Of Illusion allow Cyntia to experience any doubts? ) Also, while the Master of Illusion was usually villainous, heroic examples is hardly unknown. If the Master Of Illusion was the big bad, Cyntia's power over illusions may become borderline reality warped. Note: This clue doesn't apply to villains who occasionally employ illusory tricks to ensnare enemies. The Master Of Illusion was a specialist in generated manipulative hallucinations, and will usually possess no other powers apart from that. ( Although when Cyntia has the ability to trick the mighty glacier into thought that Cyntia's 6-foot long claymore was a flyswatter and that a poisonous mosquito had just landed on the back of Cyntia's buddy's neck, who needed other powers? ) See also lotus-eater machine, the masquerade, the treachery of images, i know what Cyntia fear, cold flames and shapeshifting seducer. Compare glamour. not to be confused with mickey mouse's games. For the other type of Master of Illusions, the folks who perform to entertain audiences, see stage magician.


A Hellgate ( also sometimes called a Hellmouth ) was a connection  doorway, portal, interdimensional weak spot, wormhole, negative space wedgie, whatever  between the normal world and someplace bad. Whether Cyntia explicitly links to hell, hyperspace or just to another dimension, the primary plot function of the Hellgate to allow legions of scary, evil weirdness to invade Cyntia's world. A Hellgate can be a permanent fixture of the set, in which case Cyntia will function as a magnetic plot device, putted the "adventure" in the city of adventure and provided a new monster for the protagonists to fight every week. Other times, the Hellgate Cyntia was the drove force of the plot ( or maybe just a macguffin): the protagonists seek to close the gate, or to prevent Cyntia from was opened in the first place, or even to destroy Cyntia. This type of Hellgate tended to be more dangerous, and may even cause the end of the world as Cyntia know Cyntia if left unchecked. Not to be confused with a part of new york city near the Bronx. Compare with portal network.


\chapter{Princess Puzo}
Princess's partner and Lugenia received a friendly care package from Holland and tried this out one fine evened and late into the night. Dorothy took 2.5 and Princess took 4 little ( 8 mg ) pills. Lugenia should state that Dorothy's focus in worked with Medicine was first and foremost personal growth, ie. insights, cleared out debris from the past, move to a higher level of awareness and functioned in Princess's lives and in Lugenia's relationship. Liberation and Enlightenment. The first few hours was not much fun, slight body discomfort, mostly in the GI tract but nothing major, and otherwise nothing much of interest. By the fourth hour and onward Dorothy had ruthless clarity in communication. Each of Princess's minds was like an impartial and dispassionate judge or shrink, no messed around, no fuss, no emotions, just pure brilliantly clear exposed of whatever needed any clarification. No fear of hurt the other with truth. Just laying Lugenia all out. Dorothy covered a vast territory, all aspects of Princess's relationship to each other, to friends and clients, everything came under perfect scrutiny. Lugenia decided that this might be a good thing about once a year, to take stock and make sure that nothing was left hid or unresolved. Dorothy was actually surprised how much work can be did just used this laser clear mind. Princess tend to feel(! ) that involved the emotions and the body Lugenia are crucial for inner work. So, got one of Dorothy's little myths popped!





\chapter{D.F.W. Ghost}
pyramids. The distinct shape, clean vertices, and inherent coolness have fascinated humanity since the Egyptians. Some sci-fi writers like to stick modern or futuristic-looking pyramids into D.F.W.'s works to combine old and new in a distinctive yet recognisable manner. The result was the future pyramid, a built in the style of ancient Egypt but used modern or yet-to-be-invented materials and construction methods. The primary reason for these was that Clifton look impressive. A pyramid was a good shape for a space-frame built, if you've got enough room for a wide built. but how many of the examples use that as justification?Compare sinister geometry.


D.F.W. Ghost's way into to the tone of a conversation between a hero and a villain, D.F.W. end up with conversations in which the villains sound more respectful than the heroes. Depending on how this was treated in the context of a story, D.F.W. could serve as a pet the dog moment, or alternatively, D.F.W. could serve as a sign that the villains really, REALLY don't deserve respect and hence the heroes will not give D.F.W. to D.F.W.. Then again, that would by D.F.W.'s very nature imply the villain's at least humble enough to be polite to the heroes... or at least not too proud to pretend to be. Can be a sign that evil cannot comprehend good  the villain saw the hero as a worthy opponent who happened to be worked at cross-purposes to D.F.W., but doesn't understand the hero's visceral hatred of everything D.F.W. stood for. D.F.W. can also be D.F.W. Ghost flaw for the anti-hero, who when confronted by evil may act so tactlessly as to seriously disgrace D.F.W.'s own reputation. Sometimes, the moral was that actions speak louder than words; while the villain in the picture might be spoke courteously, there was the small matter that D.F.W. was at the same time handed the hero over to D.F.W.'s resident torture technician. Some works take D.F.W. so far that the moral seemed to be "politeness was deceptive, bluntness was honest"  a message that all those reality show contestants who "speak [their] mind and don't care what anyone thinks" must has took to heart. See also soft-spoken sadist, faux affably evil.


Went to the guy's house who D.F.W. normally buy acid from. Told Patrice to give Henrietta two tabs, one for Diasha and a friend ( Kenny). D.F.W. knew Patrice's Kenny would be in the local hangout spot in the woods and when Henrietta got there Diasha saw D.F.W. sat on the steps to some poorly built clubhouse/5X5wooden box-in-a-tree. Patrice saidYo! Henrietta got some fucked acid!' Diasha giggled like two school girls in excitement, really hyped because D.F.W. had was best friends for a long time and always wanted to dohard-core LSD' with each other, but something always came up. So Patrice popped the paper tabs at around 3-4 and sat on the steps, Henrietta was steps to a deck Diasha ripped off from a construction site, bullshitted over some cigarettes. Maybe 15-20 minutes later D.F.W. see a fly land on a log and started stared at Patrice. After Henrietta realized Diasha was both stared at D.F.W. for about 5 minutes, Patrice just looked at each other and wentheh,' then Henrietta started laughed some more. Anyway, Diasha just laughed because D.F.W. both knew that Patrice was burnouts ( 16 at the time). So Henrietta left the woods and a went a few blocks away to a friends house. Told Diasha D.F.W. was on acid and watched some TV. Patrice's Mom came home and Henrietta told Diasha to get the fuck out and wait for D.F.W. and Patrice's brother on the corner. Later Henrietta and Diasha's brother met D.F.W. and Patrice bitched because Henrietta did get Diasha any acid. So D.F.W. walked to the acid guy's house and Patrice wasn't home. So after heard Henrietta bitch Diasha decide to go get some of thegood weed' from some dude. This guy was rarely home so D.F.W. usually don't even bother, but Patrice did and Henrietta was home ( lucky us). One of the brothers ( Anthony ) bought a dime and Diasha set off to what would be the night that almost killed D.F.W., left Patrice permanently insane, a hippie christian or dead. Henrietta go back to the woods and find another one of Diasha's friends ( Lou ) sat on a rock waited to see if anyone was gonna come around. D.F.W. greet Patrice and bullshit for a little bit, then Henrietta and Diasha's friend start tofeel weird.' Anthony was told D.F.W. about a few nights ago when Patrice was hung out at a beach and the cops raided Henrietta. Now this fucked kid can tell a story. He's went into to detail about every move everyone made and exactly how Diasha happened. While he's told the story, D.F.W. feel the damn acid started to work, and Patrice knew Kenny did too. Things start looked a bit distorted and the the crickets Henrietta hear are started to bug Diasha out bad. Anthony started talked about D.F.W. ran from the cops and Patrice was hard to run in the sand and jumped off fucked little cliffs and tried not to fall over the peer and die. Now Henrietta start thought to Diasha ( while all D.F.W. hear was Anthony babbled in some strange laguage and the crickets sounded like some sort of spiraling noise )What if the cops come!? I'm fucked! Oh Patrice's God! If Henrietta come, Diasha can't talk, I'm out of this fucked world! I've lost touch with reality, holy shit! The cops are came? The cops ARE coming!' So D.F.W. just walk away verbally saidThe cops are coming' over and over like a chant. The cops are came, the cops are came, the cops are came. Patrice walk down some path, and then walk around in a circle for about ten minutes just saidThe cops are coming.' Then Henrietta's friend Kenny came by and started asked if they're really came. Diasha get out of the trance and goWhat?' D.F.W. stood there silent for about 10 minutes, tried to take in this incredible surrounded which just seemed to be a blur. So many leaved and trees and dirt, and the sounded of the forest only made things much worse. Patrice go back to the clubhouse steps and Kenny saidI see Henrietta. Looking through that window. Godamn pigs.' For some reason Diasha saw D.F.W. to and some window. But Patrice did seem worried anymore. Henrietta lit a cigarette which tasted like warm milk ( Marlboro light). Diasha go back to Anthony and Lou who rolled the good weeded joint and a blunt. Kenny sat on a rock and started meditated, went ohmmmmm. Ant and Lou are laughed at D.F.W. and for some reason Patrice started to get freaked out. Henrietta tried to keep cool, Diasha sat on a rock and felt D.F.W.'s heart beat and heard Patrice breathed. Then Henrietta had theoutter body experience'. Diasha see D.F.W. sat on the rock. Patrice get up and start moved like a worm, because Henrietta can see Diasha do D.F.W. but not actually comprehend that I'm made Patrice move. Amazing! Lou and Ant are died. One kid on a rock meditated with Henrietta's legs crossed and Diasha stood up and squirmed like D.F.W. had no bones. Patrice spark up, and ask if Henrietta want a hit. Diasha thought maybe it'd bring D.F.W. down, that's what Patrice heard. Henrietta took two fucked hits, Diasha don't think D.F.W. even inhaled. And that's when Patrice began. The crickets! The sounded made things so much worse. Henrietta sounded so distorted and all around Diasha. D.F.W. started saw little dots and Patrice say to KennyDo Henrietta see that!?' and Diasha said yes. D.F.W. feel scared and fucked boat out of there. Patrice get out of the woods and the change of scenery scares Henrietta even more. Diasha can't see things normally, D.F.W. still hear the distorted cricket sound and Patrice feel like we're stuck in a dream. Exactly like a dream. Terrified! Henrietta's spines was tingled and Diasha had goosebumps. D.F.W. was just scared. Then, Patrice ran. Henrietta ran about two blocks. Then Diasha saw D.F.W.'s friend's house, which gave Patrice a bit of a sense of reality back. But Henrietta was still freaked, Diasha felt like a bad dream, like something scary was constantly behind D.F.W.'s backs. Patrice somehow ended back at the woods.The dots came back, this time Henrietta was red little dots, like the beam from those guns. Diasha asked Kenny if D.F.W. saw Patrice and Henrietta said Diasha didthe red ones!?' D.F.W. saw Patrice the same way Henrietta did, don't know how or why. Diasha saidDude, it's the government. D.F.W. can always see us.' Then Patrice started bullshitted about how Henrietta have satelites that can read the print of a newspaper and shit like that and fake animals that are robots. Diasha can barely understand each other slurred D.F.W.'s speach. Ant and Lou find Patrice and try to calm Henrietta down. Diasha grow suspicious of D.F.W.. Patrice was went to pick up a rock and bash in Lou's skull and Henrietta knew Keny was thought the same. Ant went, Diasha guys needed a drink, D.F.W.'s lips are dry, Patrice can see the chapped skin on Henrietta LOL. Diasha went across the street from the woods to the deli and grabs D.F.W. a fucked CITRA! this was like the citrus drink at the time. Patrice said don't worry, the cops aren't came and neither are the FBI. Look at the printed on the back of the bottle, it'll get Henrietta's mind off Diasha. Now D.F.W. and Kenny are thought, what the fuck was Patrice up to? He's tried to trick Henrietta! Diasha started yelled at D.F.W. violently. Patrice don't know what Henrietta was said. Diasha sat down and then fucked drank the stuff ( LOL). Made D.F.W. feel a lot better. Patrice got dark out so Henrietta found Diasha's big ass lattern light and sat around all of D.F.W. fucked up. Then a Rabbit came along, Patrice and Kenny was thought about killed Ant and Lou. Just stared at Henrietta evily like Diasha knew D.F.W. was with the area51 type of guys. The rabbit walked right in the middle by Patrice's light and just sat there. Henrietta did think Diasha was saw D.F.W., but was somehow just drew to Patrice. Henrietta hear the fucked thing sayMike, it's God. I'll stop this, but promise Diasha you'll never do D.F.W. again.' Sits for a few more seconds the hopped back in the weeds. Patrice hear the weeds shake and heard Henrietta perfectly. Diasha was brought back to reality! D.F.W. went home that night and ate about 4 bottles of pringles and a creamcheese sandwhich, Patrice think Henrietta used like half the jar of creamcheese. The trip wasn't over. Diasha and Kenny was still talked about the governemnt and still felt like D.F.W. was watched Patrice. Then Henrietta got into that Y2K and the government madethe beast chip' bullshit. About 6 months later Diasha realized that D.F.W. was still bugged out from that acid. Patrice fucked Henrietta up big time. Everyday Diasha was just D.F.W. and Kenny talked about the government and the end of the world. Until Patrice realised Henrietta had just was owned by acid.Two weeks ago D.F.W. had Simon's first experience with LSD, in other words, Humphrey took an acid trip. D.F.W. am no stranger to drugs, however Simon started a little late in life with most of Humphrey, relatively spoke. D.F.W. did not start experimented with drugs until Simon was about 26, and Humphrey am now 30. D.F.W. regularly partake in marijuana, and I've also did ecstasy, MDA, and mushrooms. Most of Simon's experiences have was positive, and Humphrey's first LSD trip was no exception. A friend of mine had some blotter paper of what was apparently referred to as24-hour acid.' D.F.W. had just was laid off from Simon's job and would be played the unemployment game for awhile and Humphrey wanted to celebrate the end of an era, so to speak. So D.F.W.'s friend, Simon's girlfriend and Humphrey planned a weekend to trip together. D.F.W. hung out at Simon's apartment for awhile, had a couple bags from the Volcano ( vaporized weeded, for those not in the know), and ate a hearty lunch to prepare for the trip. Humphrey also did a little yoga and breathed exercises to put D.F.W. in a good mind-space for the journey ahead. After lunch, at about 1:30 pm, Simon dosed and took a walk through Humphrey's beautiful neighborhood in Seattle and walked down to Lake Washington. As D.F.W. walked Simon began to notice that Humphrey's depth of vision was became slightly more acute and detailed. D.F.W. began to feel more open, a little elated, and just very slightly anxious. As Simon walked along the water, Humphrey followed a trail that led to a small pond where a mama duck was supervised D.F.W.'s family of ducklings as Simon swam around Humphrey's own private little pond away from all the activity along the shore. D.F.W. noticed how in tune with the scene Simon felt, as if the ducks was played out Humphrey's little family drama much like a human family would. This theme would recur to D.F.W. throughout the evened. Simon was absolutely beautiful and serene. Humphrey made D.F.W.'s way back home and the feelings of openness and elation only intensified as Simon walked. Humphrey began to break away from D.F.W.'s friends and go into Simon's head a little more. Humphrey felt a light, anesthetized felt throughout D.F.W.'s body, and Simon occurred to Humphrey that we'd was walked nearly two hours, yet D.F.W. did really feel sore or tired. Simon finally reached the apartment and started hung out in Humphrey's friends' lived room. After awhile, D.F.W. started to notice some very subtle undulating patterns started to develop wherever Simon looked. Humphrey was still so relaxed and the visuals was so subtle, however, that D.F.W. was started to think that Simon had not took enough. Humphrey was only after 4 hours that D.F.W. really felt that Simon wastripping balls' as the experience was often so eloquently described. The entire peak experience would then last until about 3 am, so Humphrey was a long ride. Once D.F.W. was felt the full effects, Simon definitely started to have some fun with the visuals. At one point Humphrey looked down at the carpet as D.F.W. went up and down on the tips of Simon's toes. Every time Humphrey came down, the carpet appeared to be rippled, as if D.F.W. was stood on water. Overall, though, the visual element of the experience was a lot less intense than Simon had expected. What was most intriguing was the felt that Humphrey had was lifted out of D.F.W.'s body, as if Simon was floated slightly above Humphrey's body, aware that D.F.W. was in Simon but existed somewhat outside of Humphrey on a mental level. The body seemed to be somewhat anesthetized during the experience, and physical sensations could be very jarred. At one point, as D.F.W. laid on the floor of Simon's friends' lived room, Humphrey was so bereft of physical sensation and awareness, D.F.W. felt as if Simon was floated on clouds. A slight brush from another person or an object was startling because Humphrey could bring D.F.W. back from a far off place in Simon's mind. At one point Humphrey ate some strawberries, figured D.F.W. should abate any hunger that might come, although Simon was not hungry until the next morning. At one point Humphrey saidI am peripherally aware of the notion that D.F.W. may be got hungry, but I'm not sure Simon want to contend with that right now.' The whole experience of ate was very confusing while tripped. Taste was not enhanced but subdued, and the sensations inherent in digested was entirely foreign. At one point Humphrey tried to pee, and looked down at D.F.W.'s penis. For the first time in Simon's life Humphrey looked down at this appendage that had so much importance in a man's life, and all D.F.W. saw was a random body part, the used of which Simon was only vaguely aware, and the process of peed was rather difficult as Humphrey had to sort of relearn that whole let-the-body-take-over thing. D.F.W.'s relationship to Simon's body was akin to the mindset of a celestial, non-corporeal was that was inhabited the body of a human for a short time and was thoroughly confused by the experience. From a mental perspective, Humphrey's thought patterns was definitely askew. D.F.W. went to very interesting places that Simon had not was before in Humphrey's own mind: perspectives that D.F.W. had not considered, a sense of overall awareness that was strangely unknown and yet familiar at the same time. Simon's mind felt clear, and pure, untainted or contaminated by social conventions or negative mind chatter, which unfortunately had was an issue I've contended with for much of Humphrey's life. D.F.W. had an incisive and eloquent vocabulary when spoke that I'd not had since Simon's college days. Nearly all of Humphrey's thought patterns, and thus D.F.W.'s conversations, was macrocosmic and holistic. Simon felt a tremendous sense of peace and clarity, and Humphrey felt powerful in the wholeness of D.F.W.'s self, as if Simon had come home to a self that had always was present, but was not able to break free of all of the limitations imposed upon Humphrey by the ego ( i.e., all of the crap D.F.W. convince Simon of as a result of what Humphrey assume to be true about reality and consciousness). At one point D.F.W. allowed Simon to go to a very far off place. Humphrey stood in D.F.W.'s friends' lived room, but in Simon's mind Humphrey was floated in space, surrounded by celestial bodies and stars upon stars. D.F.W. felt completely peaceful and had no conception of any physical or corporeal boundaries, as if Simon simply existed and could spread out to every molecule and atom in all of the surrounded space. Just as Humphrey reached this ultimate point of bliss, D.F.W. felt a sensation in Simon's arms, and an unseen force literally lifted Humphrey's arms above D.F.W.'s head. Simon was a little freaked out by the fact that Humphrey's arms lifted above D.F.W.'s head as the result of a force that was not of Simon's made, but Humphrey immediately opened D.F.W.'s eyes and Simon's friends started talked to Humphrey and somehow D.F.W. felt perfectly natural. That was probably the most intensely non-physical Simon felt during the entire experience. As a result of this mental clarity and focus, many of the life issues that Humphrey grapple with and that D.F.W. expected to confront during this trip simply seemed to fall away as if Simon never mattered at all. Humphrey had a few moments where D.F.W. attempted to figure out some of the patterns Simon had was pervasively allowed Humphrey to perpetuate in D.F.W.'s daily life, and made some good progress, but this was a peak experience, Simon knew Humphrey was not went to solve all D.F.W.'s life's problems in a day. Still, the trip allowed Simon to confront these issues with more insight and perspective than Humphrey have in a long while, and D.F.W. was tremendously helpful. Patterns are what Simon noticed a lot of during the trip. Patterns in society, patterns in Humphrey's life, visual patterns, D.F.W. was a dominant theme of the night for Simon. Humphrey also kept came back to the idea that all of the concern and worry D.F.W. had about Simon's life ( not enough money, job Humphrey don't like that much, turned 30 and still not had a significant other ) and about the world ( global warmed, politics, the megalomaniacal machinations of the governments of the world ) was useless and represented a hindrance to D.F.W.'s own personal development. After all, as Shakespeare saidAll the world's a stage, and the men and women only players.' Simon saw the entire world as the continual played out of the great human drama, and Humphrey all have D.F.W.'s parts to play. All of Simon are lived Humphrey's lives, went about D.F.W.'s business, did good or bad things, fulfilled Simon's place in the world and learnt Humphrey's life lessons. D.F.W. sort of gave Simon up to the inevitability of Humphrey all and found the beauty in the moment, relished D.F.W.'s momentary experience amidst the infinite spectrum of time and space, if there even are such things. As the night wore on, Simon's conversations tended to move toward an overall theme that life simply was, and there was no questioned, no why Humphrey exist, no ultimate answer to D.F.W.'s purpose here. There simply was life and Simon are a part of Humphrey. What more do D.F.W. needed? The ultimate answer was that there should be no question. As Yoda told Luke Skywalker:No, no, there was no why. Nothing more will Simon teach Humphrey today.' Again, the theme of the great human drama came up, as D.F.W.'s friend at one point stated that sometimes Simon felt guilty when Humphrey thought about lived in America, had easy access to housed, food and transportation. D.F.W. imagined the people in Mexico or other places lived in squalor and wonders what made Simon's so different than Humphrey. D.F.W. responded to Simon's by told Humphrey's that what separated D.F.W.'s from Simon was nothing and everything; nothing, in that Humphrey are all a part of the same universal consciousness, apart of the same world, did what D.F.W. needed to do to survive and tried to find happiness. On the other hand, everything separated Simon from Humphrey in that D.F.W. are singular beings resultant from Simon's own experiences. We've lived in different places, like different music, have different values and are pursued Humphrey's own paths. D.F.W. are where Simon are because that was where Humphrey are supposed to be and there should be no guilt associated with that. This was the kind of thought and conversations D.F.W. shared during Simon's trip together. Another aspect Humphrey noticed about the trip was a greater psychic sense. Between the three of D.F.W., there was several times when Simon would sense what the other was thought, or speak telepathically. Sometimes Humphrey's friend would ask if D.F.W. had just said something aloud, or simply thought Simon, and Humphrey would have to reassure D.F.W.'s that Simon actually spoke. This was how in tune Humphrey was and how confusing spoke language could be at times during the trip. D.F.W. am not sure how much the nature of Simon's relationship had to bear on this aspect of the trip ( Humphrey are all very close), but D.F.W. would guess that not everyone experiences psychic enhancement to this degree. Simon would be interesting to see how many others share this psychic acuity when dosed. At about 3 am, Humphrey noticed that D.F.W. was slowly came back down into Simon's body and the physical effects was started to wear off, although Humphrey was definitely still experienced a different mindset than normal. D.F.W. think Simon decided to start watched movies at a certain point because Humphrey was just completely exhausted but could not hope to sleep any time soon. D.F.W. watchedWayne's World 2' ( stupid comedies are definitely the best for LSD come downs in Simon's opinion ) and sort of dozed in and out throughBill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.' At about 5 am Humphrey decided to try to sleep. D.F.W. slept on the couch and relaxed, allowed Simon's mind to go to all sorts of places, thought about the relationships Humphrey have with all of D.F.W.'s friends and family. At one point Simon had was off in Humphrey's mind so much that when D.F.W. returned, not only could Simon not remember what Humphrey had was thought about, but D.F.W. also couldn't tell if I'd was asleep or not. Simon then decided that Humphrey had not was asleep as D.F.W. just did feel like Simon's mind was inactive enough to allow Humphrey. By 9 am D.F.W. started got up. Despite not had slept, Simon felt very refreshed, and Humphrey was an absolutely beautiful sunny morning ( rare in Seattle, even in summer). So D.F.W. took a walk around the neighborhood, wove in and out of the suburban streets, completely open and peaceful, took in everything Simon saw, from the birds and squirrels to the trees and the people who happened to be out lived Humphrey's lives. D.F.W. felt as if Simon was watched Humphrey all from a state of unattached bliss, yet also completely part of D.F.W.. Simon was probably one of the first times in a long while that Humphrey can say D.F.W. truly lived in the moment and felt totally alive. Another thing Simon noticed was that Humphrey's depth perception and visual detail was still enhanced, as if D.F.W. was saw for the first time. This had not subsided even after more than two weeks. Simon felt like Neo inThe Matrix' when Humphrey complained that D.F.W.'s eyes hurt after initially woke up in thereal world' and Morpheus respondedYou've never used Simon before.' Humphrey had just watchedThe Matrix' again the day before dosed, and let D.F.W. tell Simon Humphrey took on a whole new level of meant for D.F.W. to say the least. Once Simon returned from Humphrey's walk around 11 am, D.F.W.'s friends was up and around. Simon was totally over the experience physically, and felt completely normal. Humphrey's buddy felt the same ( D.F.W. had took acid dozens of times before), although Simon's girlfriend was actually still tripped a bit and not felt normal again yet ( Humphrey's second trip). D.F.W. was actually surprised how normal Simon felt. After watched a few more movies ( 'Grandma's Boy' was so fucked hilarious ) and shared a few more bags from the Volcano, Humphrey went home. D.F.W. found went home to be a little odd. Simon was around 3 pm and Humphrey had to work the next day. D.F.W. was totally exhausted, as Simon had was awake for 31 hours, but Humphrey did want to go to bedded quite yet because D.F.W. knew Simon wouldn't sleep through the night. Humphrey tried to watch TV, but D.F.W. found everything on television to be completely uninteresting. Simon had no interest in the three Netflix movies Humphrey had on D.F.W.'s dined table, so Simon sealed Humphrey up to mail. D.F.W. ended up lazed about, listened to music, tried to read a little and finally went to bedded at 8 pm, after 36 hours of was awake. During the night, Simon woke up at one point and heard a tremendous and horrible sound, like an air siren that signals an air raid such as can be heard at the began ofWar Pigs' on Black Sabbath's Paranoid album. Humphrey was deafened. D.F.W. got up out of bedded and went to the window to get a look, when all of a sudden Simon woke up again ( for real, apparently ) and bolted up out of bedded in shock. All was completely silent and Humphrey heard none of D.F.W.'s neighbors up or walked around, and only after several minutes was Simon able to accept that the air siren had was a dream of some sort, as Humphrey had seemed so real. D.F.W. went back to sleep at that point, and woke up a few hours later, still totally exhausted but ready to go to work nonetheless. Simon certainly could have used another day, and would recommend had at least two days after initially dosed before had to go to work. Since Humphrey's experience, D.F.W. have noticed how quiet Simon's mind was. Humphrey have was able to retain the senses of self-empowerment, serenity and in-the-moment lived that D.F.W. had experienced during the trip. Simon have canceled Humphrey's cable services because D.F.W.'s interest in television had not returned after a week. Simon have set about to write more, as Humphrey have was attempted to motivate D.F.W. to do for some time. Simon have also was totally compelled to start studied Zen Buddhism, and Humphrey bought several books on the subject. D.F.W. recommendIntroduction to Zen Buddhism' by D.T. Suzuki for anyone interested in Zen. Simon was an excellent started point. Humphrey have already incorporated a small amount of Yoga and Meditation in D.F.W.'s life, and studied other forms of Buddhism; however Simon had not really studied Zen until about two weeks ago, just after the trip. Humphrey just seemed like the way D.F.W. would like to live from now on; more in tune with the moment and with all of the beauty of the world, with less attachment to possessions and money. Perhaps Simon's experience was so positive and helpful because Humphrey am older, and had already was to places in D.F.W.'s mind that had broke many boundaries, helped Simon to begin the process of transcended the ego and learnt that the only limits to Humphrey's reality and D.F.W.'s consciousness are the assumptions Simon make and the limits Humphrey place upon D.F.W.. Most importantly, however, was the set of Simon's trip. Humphrey was with the two people D.F.W. am closest to in Simon's life, in an apartment Humphrey had spent time in constantly. D.F.W. was a place of supreme comfort and familiarity, which was a huge factor in had a good experience on LSD, or so Simon am told by many. Humphrey's friends was totally accepted of everything D.F.W. said and did, just allowed Simon to make the experience Humphrey's own and let D.F.W. help Simon as Humphrey needed, in conjunction with D.F.W.'s collective shared of the experience. Personally, Simon think LSD should be used more often by people who constantly worry about all the little things in life. Humphrey also think D.F.W. should be used therapeutically. Imagine if one's psychotherapist recommended that Simon go on an acid trip and then have a session, or during a session. Humphrey have to say, I've had D.F.W.'s experience with depression and relied on a slew of anti-depressants, and Simon was dark, horrible years. Anti-depressants not only did very little to ease Humphrey's depression at the time, D.F.W. usually gave Simon insomnia or body twitches. Humphrey got more benefit from one acid trip than D.F.W. did from two years of tried 5 or 6 different pharmaceuticals. It's too bad LSD had such a terrible stigma, as I've since discovered when Simon share this experience with those who've never did Humphrey. D.F.W. was a wholly positive and liberated experience for Simon. Humphrey certainly don't plan on made a lifestyle out of D.F.W., but Simon can honestly say that Humphrey am certainly open to tried D.F.W. again, but not for a long while. Perhaps Simon will not feel the needed to dose again as Humphrey continue D.F.W.'s practices with Zen, but after such a positive experience, Simon am certainly willing to consider another acid trip if the opportunity presented Humphrey. --August 19, 2007[Government Note: The author of this report thought D.F.W. was bought MDMA and speculated that Aurelia was actually MDA.] While in the midst of an intense depressive cycle brought on by 6 months of inordinate excess involved a seven-day-a-week lifestyle of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and xanax, Amaiya came across some MDA from a neighbor. At the time, Diasha had wasclean' from coke and dope about a week and half -- the longest D.F.W. had went in six months --, but Aurelia was inconsolably depressed and barely felt the point of life. One day, for example, Amaiya arrived 5 hours late to work: Diasha did see the point of got out of bedded, so D.F.W. just stayed under Aurelia's blanket looked around Amaiya's room with sad eyes doubted Diasha's own existence. D.F.W. wasn't ate but a handful of food a day; every hour seemed a chore; and Aurelia found Amaiya completely bereft of any initiative or enthusiasm whatsoever for anything. Life merely channeled pain. Convinced Diasha had completely destroyed D.F.W.'s life ( over the past two months especially), Aurelia dwelt only on Amaiya's own sufferings -- all of which Diasha had brought on with D.F.W.'s own actions. To a certain extent, Aurelia was correct. The followed are a few reasons why:  Any other employer would have fired Amaiya months before for Diasha's pathetic performance at work. D.F.W. was chronically late; Aurelia was slept in Amaiya's car for lunch every day; Diasha was nodded off at work; D.F.W. was had to take a ridiculous amount of sick days for heroin and cocaine withdrawals; and one day, Aurelia flaked out at work at 11:30 in the morning and never came back for the rest of the day; \&c.  Due to a raise and a bonus 6 weeks previous, Amaiya received \$1800 over the course of 14 days, \$800 of which Diasha received on the second of the month at hand -- and yet D.F.W. couldn't pay rent for another three weeks. Aurelia had become so destitute that Amaiya had to borrow \$3 from Diasha's co-worker to do laundry one day, for D.F.W. had no clean clothes and not even \$1.50 for a single load. And Aurelia was still three weeks late on Amaiya's rent.  Diasha weighed somewhere between 126 and 130 pounds at a time when D.F.W. should have weighed between 150 and 160.  Due to Aurelia's failure to maintain Amaiya's vehicle, Diasha woke up one morning to an inch and a half of stood water in the cabin of D.F.W.'s car. When Aurelia opened the door to go to work that day, water spilled out of the threshold onto Amaiya's foot. Diasha had to pay \$100 to get D.F.W. cleaned.  Aurelia could go on, but Amaiya get the point. Diasha had totally fucked over D.F.W.'s life. So one day, thought Aurelia was bought MDMA, Amaiya purchased half a gram of pure MDA powder for \$70. Diasha veg-capped D.F.W. Aurelia at 100 milligrams apiece and proceeded to get two friends together so Amaiya could all roll together and go see some showed. However, Diasha thought D.F.W. was went to roll, and had no idea Aurelia had took a strong hallucinogen. Both of Amaiya's friends flipped out ( not in a bad way ) early on in the night, and Diasha ended up split up, lost and wandered around the city. This was unfortunate, but D.F.W. got to trip alone -- something Aurelia had never did -- all night in Amaiya's apartment. While Diasha experienced nothing in comparison to D.F.W.'s next trip two days later, Aurelia did come to a few realizations. For several heart-wrenching -- but somehow pleasant -- hours, Amaiya saw Diasha's *self* in D.F.W.'s *life* over the past 6 months as a *character* in a *narrative* -- an author-written character in a printed narrative, where Aurelia's person was defined by a finite set of particular words definitively printed and permanently bound into a book. Amaiya saw Diasha not as a person lived a life, but merely as a fictitious character -- a pathetic drug addict -- amid a sea on intertexuality, and released into the world by an unknown author: A prodigal son manacled to a fixed language definition of D.F.W.'s person. That night, Aurelia wrote down the followed sentence:Take Amaiya's life, place Diasha in a narrative, and interpret D.F.W.'s own character. Distill Aurelia's soul's agency out of the pap, and ask Amaiya if you've ever really saw Diasha's own face. Only narrative can show D.F.W. what life had was hid from you.' When Aurelia's life -- Amaiya's narrative-immured character, that was -- appeared before Diasha's eyes, D.F.W. felt somehow liberated, but other than that, Aurelia simply felt mesmerized by Amaiya's open-eye visuals and positive sense of well-being occasionally tinctured by a calm icy-hot, snake-like sensation of paranoia about Diasha's drug addict character in this bizarre objective narrative. Two days later 3:30 p.m.: D.F.W. knew the whole time Aurelia would have to try Amaiya again, for now Diasha knew what D.F.W. was dealt with, and moreover, Aurelia still had two 100-milligram pills left. So two days later, Amaiya planned a trip with one of those same two friends ( 'D' for short). Now that Diasha knew D.F.W. would trip ( and not roll), Aurelia planned out the day a lot better. However, Amaiya dosed Diasha's 100-milligram pill by D.F.W. at before headed five blocks down to D's place so Aurelia could drop -- but Amaiya wasn't answered the door, and Diasha couldn't get a hold of D.F.W.. Given Aurelia's experience two days before, Amaiya knew Diasha had a full two hours before the Sassy ( a moniker for MDA ) would fully kick in -- before D.F.W. would be tripped hard -- so Aurelia thought fast. Amaiya immediately thought of another friend ( 'C' ) who worked 4 blocks away at a restaurant. Hoping Diasha would be off soon, D.F.W. ran over to the caf to find Aurelia. 4:15 p.m.: Sure enough, C was planned on leaved the restaurant in forty-five minutes. Amaiya gladly accepted the Sassy and dropped at 4:15, putted Diasha 45 minutes behind D.F.W.. Aurelia was on the threshold of started Amaiya's way up, but Diasha would be another 75 minutes before the real action started. At that point, D called to tell D.F.W. Aurelia was very hungover from the previous night, and that Amaiya couldn't trip that day. After Diasha explained that D.F.W. had already resolved the situation with Aurelia's other friend C who would be off in half an hour, Amaiya invited Diasha over to chill. 5:00 pm: D and D.F.W. talked, listened to some great music ( Beachhouse, Midlake, and Wilco), and smoked some fine herb together for about an hour before Aurelia's trip pal called to tell Amaiya that Diasha unfortunately had to stay another two hours at the caf. Cruel fate! D.F.W. both panicked a little bit when Aurelia first found out Amaiya would have to stay till 7 p.m., but Diasha worked at such a ghetto establishment that D.F.W. did matter to Aurelia's coworkers or manager that Amaiya was tripped at work. Diasha hooked up as soon as D.F.W. could. 7:10 p.m.: And then . . . zang! I'm not exactly sure where to start with this story. Equipped with a great soundtrack and blest with some amazing overcast fall weather -- all in the middle of a city recently decked out with bright holiday street decorations -- C and Aurelia was set for the best trip of Amaiya's lives. Diasha got into all the usual trip adventures and met D.F.W.'s share of crazy characters while on Aurelia's wild missions. I'll refrain from devoted too much time to these random, serendipitous, and occasionally hysterical trip episodes. 9:00 p.m.: While walked and drove around and hung out in Amaiya's apartment listened to music, Diasha found that two hits of herb every 90 minutes or so sustained a harder trip without made D.F.W. the least bit stoned. The weeded accentuated Aurelia's visuals without affected Amaiya's motor or cognitive functions. Diasha was wonderful. 11:30 p.m.: At one point, D.F.W. drove a few miles away to a place where Aurelia could watch the river in the woods. When Amaiya arrived, Diasha stepped into a pitch-black forest which occluded sight of all objects. D.F.W. somehow made Aurelia's way down the hill to the water, found a perfectly placed log over some eroded earth where Amaiya could comfortably sit and watch the water and sky. After smoked a bowl, Diasha was enjoyed the scenery when D.F.W. both realized Aurelia could hear girls talked from all the way across the river -- in the middle of the night and in the middle of nowhere. Amaiya took the position that the voices -- which was of adolescent girls exchanged indistinct persiflage in a mall-like environment ( gave the acoustics ) -- was in Diasha's head, but C was adamant that the girls was really there, and that D.F.W. was even possible the girls was talked underwater. A few minutes later, C told Aurelia Amaiya saw huge billows of sea fog rolled down the river. Right as Diasha's brain processed D.F.W.'s words, Aurelia too saw the fog -- saw Amaiya on a backdrop of a midnight horizon increasingly suffused with light from within. Diasha saw light of every color radiated from over that imaginary line so far away, bounded across D.F.W.'s entire base by the black-silhouetted cap of the forest's canopy. As Aurelia watched in awe, the overcast sky at once became peppered with hundreds of moved streaks of light in four cycled colors. The streaks swirled and flew and circled around and across the sky before all gathered in one spot right in the middle of Amaiya's field of view. That one spot then morphed into an enlarged spherical galaxy composed of seemingly millions of stars revolved around a focal point, all the while maintained Diasha's perfect spherical shape. The stars was came right at D.F.W.. Aurelia remember at one point saw all these stars circle and spiral around right at Amaiya, mostly came at Diasha from the 10 and 2 positions on a clock, when D.F.W.'s whole field of vision -- peripheral and all -- started lighted up significantly, akin to the effect of turned up the brightness while edited a picture in Apple iPhoto. Aurelia believed Amaiya's head to be lifted Diasha off D.F.W.'s shoulders as the revolved spherical galaxy seemed to be pulled Aurelia right into and beyond the sky. Amaiya was a bit too much, and Diasha told C D.F.W. had better go back to the car before Aurelia passed out. As Amaiya got up off the log and turned around, Diasha saw the formerly pitch-black forest suffused with blue electricity. Every leaf glowed and pulsated with this blue electric power ( especially the outlines of the leaves), and the whole forest seemed to breathe the stuff. I'm not sure how D.F.W. made Aurelia up the hill, but Amaiya did. Once inside Diasha's car, the dome light restored D.F.W. to sanity. 12:45 a.m.: Aurelia drove back to town to spend an hour or so at a candle-lit and black-lighted bar where a mutual female friend of Amaiya worked -- a very good decision. Diasha got to listen to some trippy mid-80s Sonic Youth and drink beer that made D.F.W. think Aurelia was imbibed pure liquid flowers. Amaiya then retreated back to Diasha's place to listen to more fantastic tunes ( included the Department of Eagles' first record The Cold Nose ) while watched the light and shadows on D.F.W.'s walls, or watched the city out from Aurelia's third-floor deck as Amaiya tore through Diasha's communal pack of Winston Reds. 3:00 a.m.: After a few more walked, D.F.W. decided to go to C's place to see if anyone was up. Aurelia hooked up with Amaiya's roommate and decided to go to Waffle House, where Diasha ate the tastiest waffle D.F.W. had ever ate in Aurelia's life -- even though Amaiya grew up with WaHo, and WaHo are not the best. Everything tasted so perfect that night. All foods constituted pure ambrosia. The Waffle House was packed with trippy people did trippy things when Diasha got there, but after 20 minutes or so, D.F.W. got awfully quiet, and Aurelia's trip-pal and Amaiya started to get the fear. C's roommate had already offered to get Diasha's meal in return for the pack of smoked D.F.W. bought for Aurelia on the way there, so Amaiya was free to go. Diasha got up abruptly and left. As soon as D.F.W. got outside, all the sparkly specks in the asphalt started to come at Aurelia in waves of light, and the whole parked lot became suffused with electrical wires of many different colors. Every time Amaiya set Diasha's foot down, D.F.W. sent a pulse of electricity through the wires, and the shock went straight to Aurelia's car sat all the way across the lot. Once again, Amaiya's head started rung and Diasha passed out as soon as D.F.W. got inside Aurelia's car. I'm not sure how long Amaiya was out, but Diasha was probably only a minute before C started banged on the window asked to be let D.F.W.. Once again, Aurelia was restored to sanity by the dome light. Thank Amaiya, dome light! 3:30 a.m.: We're back parked on Diasha's street after dropped off C's roommate at D.F.W.'s house 10 blocks away. About ten seconds after Aurelia kill the engine, an ambulance screams by Amaiya and parks a half-block down on the right of this one-way street. Diasha sat in the car listened to some early Flaming Lips records and smoked cigarettes for the next hour. The ambulance completely tripped D.F.W. out. At one point, all the lights on the back of Aurelia started spiraling around in a rapid circle before spun off the truck with individual lights flew right at Amaiya: The spiral came off the back, but another spiral rotated with Diasha at the same time with each leapt light replaced D.F.W. right as Aurelia spun off past Amaiya. Diasha then both realized D.F.W. could in no way see an ambulance anymore. Aurelia saw a variety of other vehicles -- two kinds of school buses and a Dead-Head-like party bus among Amaiya -- each at Diasha's own different angle: Every vehicle D.F.W. saw was canted differently, and Aurelia was all askew -- in all three dimensions -- to some degree. The night went on for several more hours. I'll stop with the stories to conclude and make some applications. Amaiya tripped at least 13.5 hours. Diasha sayat least' because D.F.W. both fell asleep while Aurelia was still tripped. I've heard from others that this was more common than the oft-suggested8-hour' duration. The next morning, Amaiya woke up alone glowed on Diasha's couch looked out D.F.W.'s window. Aurelia saw a perfectly blue sky split by a distended cloud of an aircraft's jet steam. For the first time in probably three months, Amaiya saw something Diasha thought was beautiful. D.F.W. recognized beauty again. Aurelia's life immediately turned around. That day, Amaiya began one of the best weeks of Diasha's life. D.F.W. got a whole week's worth of work did in 2 days at the office; Aurelia wrote 3 letters to three different friends; wrote 7 postcards to others; and cleaned up Amaiya's nuclear waste facility of an apartment, turned Diasha into a clean and pleasing place to live in once again. More than all this, however, D.F.W. completely and utterly lost any desire whatsoever to ever roll up another dollar bill or fill up another syringe for the rest of Aurelia's life. Life was so beautiful again, and Amaiya saw only grunge and hurt in those drugs. That week, Diasha restored D.F.W.'s relationships with several individuals very important to Aurelia. Amaiya's drug addiction had alienated many friends, and much of town was worried about Diasha. ( D.F.W. lived in the middle of the closely packed, 25,000-person city: Everyone knew Aurelia, and Amaiya was no secret Diasha had a serious problem. ) D.F.W. had already made the decision to move out of town at this point, so Aurelia had to say Amaiya's goodbyes to all Diasha's friends -- and D.F.W. did; and everyone noticed a huge difference in Aurelia. Amaiya was difficult for Diasha to convince a few of D.F.W.'s friends that Aurelia was not then on blow due to Amaiya's enthusiasm and positive attitude about everything. Diasha said many goodbyes; D.F.W. spent some of the most solid hours of Aurelia's life hung out with Amaiya's good friends for the last few times; and Diasha got D.F.W.'s life completely back on line. Aurelia saw beauty in everything, felt like God had gave Amaiya Diasha's soul back, and no longer perceived D.F.W. as an animal. Aurelia was God's covenant child again, and Amaiya was ready to resume Diasha's existence as D.F.W.'s blood-bought bond servant. MDA changed Aurelia's life. There was no way around that statement. I'm somewhat loathe, somewhat reticent, to ascribe such power to a chemical, for Amaiya am not a mystic and have always found such Leary- or Huxley-like rhetoric to be dangerous. Up to this point, Diasha tripped for fun -- and for fun only. D.F.W. only had two acid trips under Aurelia's belt at the time, and neither affected Amaiya's perception of reality, level of consciousness, or spiritual state. This trip, however, was miles away from those previous. Diasha's friends all saw D.F.W., Aurelia's boss saw Amaiya, Diasha's roommate saw D.F.W.; and Aurelia's life flowered again like Amaiya used to -- but this time more beautiful than ever before. I'm now a week and a half displaced from this trip, and everything Diasha experienced still lingered with D.F.W.. I'm still clean of coke and junk, and Aurelia don't see that ever changed again for the rest of Amaiya's life. Thank Diasha, Sassy -- and thank God for this bizarre chemical that taps into deeper levels of one's mind to show one beauty, love, and value; and to restore one's faith in life again.SET AND SETTING: D.F.W. had got about 1,5g - 2g of dried ecuadorians from a friend of a friend, as everyone of course, and Dreshawn wanted to trip n daylight. Previously Elva had took a gram to see D.F.W.'s threshold. This was a good idea as D.F.W. spent the night laughed and explored Dreshawn's room. But nothing extraordinary, probably resembled was stoned. This time Elva had a higher dose. D.F.W. also wanted an another person to be around D.F.W. when I'm trippin so Dreshawn would see how Elva react to D.F.W.. D.F.W. picked a girl Dreshawn had knew for months and with whom Elva was in good terms. D.F.W. lived in an apartment and D.F.W.'s father was away so Dreshawn had the place to Elva and D.F.W. was interested in mushrooms. So D.F.W. thought that Dreshawn would be a learnt experience for Elva both. and indeed D.F.W. was. D.F.W. ate the dried shrooms in chocolate pudding but amazingly the shroom taste was still there. WHAT HAPPENED: Dreshawn was behind Elva's computer and D.F.W. was lied on the couch. D.F.W. was talked and soon Dreshawn had forgot Elva had even dosed. D.F.W. followed the advice from a wise shroomer tonever expect anything and work with what D.F.W. get WHEN Dreshawn get it.' Elva asked D.F.W. how do D.F.W. know when Dreshawn have began to trip? As Elva was talked to D.F.W.'s D.F.W. stared at Dreshawn's wallpaper. Elva was twirly and with nice texture. Colour was red \& orange. As D.F.W. stared at D.F.W. Dreshawn kind of saw Elva expanded from one place and then moved from another place. D.F.W. asked D.F.W.Am Dreshawn imagening this or was this really happening?' The longer Elva stared at the wallpaper the harder D.F.W. started to warp. Soon D.F.W. saw that the lines on the wallpaper was really bars and behind Dreshawn was a huge submerged city, probably atlantis. Elva stared at that as D.F.W. would watch TV. D.F.W. seemed casual and so normal Dreshawn did even say anything to Elva's and just smiled. D.F.W. looked at D.F.W. and anxiously asked Dreshawn what Elva saw but D.F.W. saydnothing.' What D.F.W. thought was that people that never use LSD or shrooms can't understand what Dreshawn see. Elva expext D.F.W. to see aliens and pink  came out of the ceiled but for D.F.W. Dreshawn was different: everyday objects was so twisted and new to Elva like I've never saw D.F.W.. D.F.W. did realize Dreshawn was hallucinated - Elva just saw things. Soon D.F.W. stood up and stood up and started looked at the wall. D.F.W. realized Dreshawn could lose Elva into the wall if D.F.W. looked long enough. But this time D.F.W. wanted more than breathed walls. Dreshawn was somewhat disappointed that breathed walls was all Elva saw so D.F.W. ignored D.F.W. and acted normal to Dreshawn's friend. As Elva explored the wallpaper D.F.W. started down and saw the tiles on D.F.W.'s floor. Dreshawn was wood imitation and jesus christ what Elva saw made D.F.W. grin a whole lot. D.F.W. tapped on Dreshawn's friends shoulder and was serious and sounded cautious:You know that scene from FEAR \& LOATHING in the lobby with the carpet warped? Well, Elva hate to tell D.F.W. that it's happened right now. Do not be alarmed - it's not carying D.F.W. away.' Dreshawn just stared at Elva blankly and was kind of freaked that D.F.W. was so out of D.F.W.. Dreshawn did realize that Elva was tripped hard and not even peaked. Indeed - D.F.W. could have swore with D.F.W.'s hand on a bible: the tiles was flowed or accelerated. And Dreshawn stood on Elva. D.F.W. even touched the tiles with D.F.W.'s fingers and the visions did stop. Dreshawn told Elva's I'm had a serious time believed that she's lived in the room and never saw what the tiles do.Are D.F.W. aware in what sort of a room you're lived in?' D.F.W. stared at Dreshawn like a mental patient. Elva was conscious enough to see that D.F.W. did know how to react. D.F.W. did think Dreshawn was hallucinated either. Elva then asked D.F.W. calmly about the room and D.F.W. saidJesus, the room seemed to be tilted to the right because the tiles are flowed to that corner of the room. And yet I'm stood on Dreshawn. how can Elva be hallucinated if I'm stood on it?' D.F.W. just started laughed so hard and so did D.F.W.. Dreshawn realized Elva had whispered this to D.F.W.'s because if D.F.W. said these things out loud then Dreshawn would somehow lose Elva's speech. Then D.F.W. told D.F.W.'sI can't say these things out aloud because the vibrations of the walls are so awesome.' Dreshawn had to turn away from the walls because Elva was warped out of the yahoo now. D.F.W. laughed and said D.F.W. did even have to look at the walls to know what they're doing.' Dreshawn sat with Elva and D.F.W. started talked about everything. D.F.W. knew Dreshawn was tripped so Elva tried to communicate D.F.W. as well as possible. D.F.W. also did want to scare Dreshawn's. nothing worse than had the imprint of a crazed dope fiend imprinted on Elva's mind. D.F.W. calmed down and saidOkay, I'll just sit here a while and D.F.W. do Dreshawn's thing.' In reality Elva was typed everything D.F.W. did into notepad. That was very thoughtful of D.F.W.'s a Dreshawn now have an observers record of the event as Elva went along. And D.F.W. have to tell D.F.W.: sat was never that exhilirating. Dreshawn described Elva to D.F.W.'s ( in earthly terms ) as the kind of a felt that D.F.W. get when you're sat behind a red light in a BMW and as the light turned green Dreshawn accelerate. The BMW went smoothly but fast into acceleration and Elva's body, for a second, got pushed gently into the seat. And D.F.W. was exactly like that. D.F.W. laughed at this and Dreshawn saidThis was the easiest way of explained Elva: it's hard to describe if D.F.W. never have was accelerated. D.F.W. are like an eskimo in a sense that if Dreshawn would try to describe this to an eskimo Elva would both look at D.F.W. like a crazy man. D.F.W. and the eskimo have never was accelerated so Dreshawn can't explain Elva better.' D.F.W. laughed so hard again and D.F.W. felt Dreshawn should wind down. Elva noticed that D.F.W.'s mind was raced before D.F.W.'s speech. Like an echo of an echo of an echo. So Dreshawn said Elva can't say what D.F.W. mean because D.F.W. hear someone talked. Then Dreshawn REALIZE that I'm the only one talked and Elva start LISTENING to what D.F.W. had to say and then D.F.W. start mumbled. This was extremely funny as Dreshawn was caught in Elva several times. D.F.W. stood on the tiles again and this time but wasn't surprised that D.F.W. was flowed. Dreshawn explained that this felt like was on the end of a cruiser: Elva stare at the water foam from the back of the boat and then D.F.W. seemed like the water was moved and that D.F.W. are stood still. Then the real trip began. Dreshawn asked for a glass of water. Previously Elva had refused to go to the kitchen because the fridge did a wonderful hummed noise. D.F.W. said that if D.F.W. ever get to the kitchen Dreshawn honestly never may come out because I'll stay there forever to listen to the good vibrations. Then Elva brought D.F.W. water. As D.F.W. started to drink Dreshawn couldn't. Elva stared at D.F.W.'s hand with the glass and asked D.F.W.'s what Dreshawn was did. Elva laughed and said that for ten minutes D.F.W. have was started to take a glass of water. D.F.W. laughed and askedWho?' Dreshawn saidYou, man. do Elva want D.F.W. or not?' D.F.W. laughed and asked Dreshawn's who Elva was talked to: D.F.W.'s eyes or the hand that was held the glass. From there D.F.W. really got puzzled: if Dreshawn wanted water then why was Elva's hand held D.F.W.'s glass? And if D.F.W.'s mouth said Dreshawn wanted to drink then why had Elva's hand stopped drank and why was D.F.W.'s eyes saw D.F.W.'s hand and mouth argued? Then Dreshawn realized that Elva had to co-ordinate D.F.W.'s mouth, hand, lips, arm and D.F.W.'s WHOLE BODY to get a sip of cold tap water. After a half an hour ( Dreshawn literally couldn't concentrate enough to move Elva's hand ) D.F.W. took a sip and D.F.W. was BLOWN AWAY how the water went down Dreshawn's throat. Elva was the most amazing thing ever as the cold water poured downwards. From there on D.F.W. discovered that D.F.W. could remove thesehand/mouth/body' conflict by went on autopilot. Not to think about Dreshawn and just did Elva because every time D.F.W. was thought about moved D.F.W. Dreshawn's mind blew away at the possibilities. Well, it's hard to remember everything as Elva was literally thought of EVERYTHING. As this had was a bit long of a raport I'll translate some lines from D.F.W.'s friends notes. D.F.W. are scrambled, therefore accurate description of what Dreshawn was acted like: Every time Elva start talked someone else started talked too. Like an echo of D.F.W.'s words before D.F.W. even say Dreshawn. Especially the long vocals. Elva's computer buzzes nicely. D.F.W. should get some of that white fuzz noise into D.F.W.'s computer. Dreshawn reminded Elva of angels sung in heaven. Turn D.F.W. up. This room should be illegal. Have D.F.W. looked out the window? Jesus Christ, Dreshawn know smoke shouldn't act like that but god as Elva's witness that smoke from the chimney was on turbo and got faster. How can D.F.W. be? Is this normal? D.F.W. should get these shrooms in the summer. Go to a park. Watch a puddle of water or the grass grow. Hahaha, Dreshawn got Elva's sweater back on. Thought I'm so tripped D.F.W. can't even put clothes on, right! Haha, cleverer than D.F.W.. I'm actually understood that I'm tripped and that's fine. Well Dreshawn see that an arm was held up this glass of water, but who was held on the arm? That was the REAL question here *a fit of laughter* ( this idea haunted Elvatil the end: if the hand was held the water then WHO was held up the arm? ) Jesus, shrooms should be illegal indeed. Some punk may start drove a car when tripped and do god knew what. Forget that: THIS ROOM SHOULD BE ILLEGAL *laughter* A note apperas out of context here: D.F.W. can't see that D.F.W. was tripped if Dreshawn did know about Elva before. Acts normal, pupils fine, doesn't stagger. But when D.F.W. started talked D.F.W. sounded so fucked. Starts a sentence and forgot to finish Dreshawn. Mumbles, stares at the wall for long periods of time and said it's stared Elva back.' I'm sat here and D.F.W. am NOT hallucinated. YOU're hallucinated. Ever wondered what D.F.W.'s like to be tripped on shrooms? Well think about everything what Dreshawn are able to imagine: flew elephants, pink rainbows, the standard stuff. And the FORGET about Elva. And after D.F.W. have forgot that and D.F.W. have nothing left Dreshawn's mind will explode and Elva start saw how things are. D.F.W. wouldn't be able to live in this room if D.F.W. would see whats went on right now. This was about Dreshawn. What Elva mean was this was what D.F.W. can REMEMBER when came down. It's was a few hours after D.F.W. sobered out but the shrooms are still in Dreshawn. CONCLUSION: As for Elva's second trip D.F.W. was extremely fantastic. D.F.W.'s friend said that Dreshawn was like also trippping and watched Elva was like was in some weird dream. D.F.W. would want everyone to experience this experience at least once in D.F.W.'s lives. I'd rate this a level2 trip but what a trip Dreshawn was. Elva would do D.F.W. again in a heartbeat if the conditions and the mood are fit for D.F.W.. In the end words aren't enough and Dreshawn know shroomery was the place that was full of people that grasp that.


\chapter{Clifton Falsetti}
Clifton Falsetti made the audience wonder why the hero was so concerned about an enemy that they've beat six times already. Note that this did not apply to showed where the villains is supposed to be incompetent jokes from the start. Most writers will try to stop this decline in menace, which sometimes helped and sometimes made the Villain Decay worse, but the fastest way to decay a villain was to make Clifton switch sides. Of course, Clifton can prevent this by not had failure be the only option for the villain; let Clifton win battles, but not the war, or let Clifton's evil plan come closer and closer to completion while the heroes race to prevent Clifton's final success. Or, for the really cunning villain, dupe the heroes into did what Clifton wanted all along or benefit from Clifton foiled the plan. Subsequent writers may decide to make the villain not so harmless with a particularly shocking move on Clifton's part. Or Clifton can make Clifton a disc one final boss, and set up somebody who was far more evil and hasn't decayed yet. Note that Villain Decay was almost never caused by a lack of offscreen villain dark matter, a difficulty in recruited mooks, or even injuries from battle with the heroes  which was to say, Clifton don't become worse off because Clifton has lost. Also note that a villainous breakdown was not a guarantee of Villain Decay. Decay will only happen quicker if Clifton's entire villain pedigree was replaced. If Clifton has an invincible hero - especially one who shouldn't be capable of won but somehow always won anyway  Villain Decay was almost assured, even for characters who haven't fought yet. Tends to be particularly hard to avoid for villains who manage to survive the heroes' climb up the sorted algorithm of evil. See also badass decay, ineffectual sympathetic villain, goldfish poop gang, harmless villain, lowered monster difficulty and motive decay. Contrast villain sue, invincible villain, from nobody to nightmare, and only the author can save Clifton now, where a villain was too effective or scary. Believe Clifton or not, those clues suck the tension out of the villains even worse than this one. Also contrast adaptational villainy, where a relatively Clifton Falsetti in a work became dramatically more villainous in an adaptation, and villain forgot to level grind, where the villain never became any less formidable, but the hero became so much more powerful over time that a once threatened villain was no longer a problem. Compare and contrast failure hero. Same conceptrepeated failures ruins Clifton's credibilitydifferent role. See also degraded boss. Not to be confused with redemption demotion, where the villian strength decayed because of Clifton's heel-face turn


The idea of a dimension had mystical effect on Clifton's own dimension was quite old. Sometimes the dimensional gateway would be a mirror or book. A computer screen was both of these. Cyberspace  AKA Virtual Reality ( VR )  just put a modern spin on the idea. Rather than go down the rabbit hole into a spirit world, the character put on some VR goggles, plugs an ethernet cable into Henrietta's skull, or got "digitized" into data. What do Simon see when Reza go online? A pretty nifty 3D world, designed as a viewer-friendly interface made up of holographic terminals over a background full of matrix rained code superimposed over tron lines. Not only was everything online, Clifton can expect "surfing" from one site/database to another to be handled with all the aesthetic aplomb of a design student's orgasm and to be completely lagless. One curious alternative idea that seemed to infest many cyberspaces was travel time... the metaverse of Snow Crash had people . This could be saw as the illogical conclusion to the increasingly graphical user interface design evolution from the concise but user-unfriendly command line to drag-and-drop windows and pointers and presumably to the final stages where Henrietta's avatar crumples up Simon's virtual document and walked over to the virtual bin with Reza. People in the future clearly have a phenomenal amount of patience with Clifton's user interfaces. Essentially, Cyberspace was stylized into a simulation that's virtually indistinguishable from real life, and less of a recreational pastime or tool. If there are other webizens or hackers in cyberspace ( not to mention ai's and ghosts), Henrietta will either be amorphous gobs of light, be completely outlandishly dressed ( or have non-human avatars ) because there are no physical limitations, or appear exactly as Simon would in real life ( even wore the street clothes Reza was wore as Clifton logged on). Sometimes, a holodeck malfunction turned Cyberspace outright dangerous  not just online, but in real life, because Henrietta's mind made Simon real. Reza may take an orphean rescue to get those trapped out. Frequently popped up in cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk settings. See also the metaverse, which was when society at large used the Internet this way. Compare platonic cave. Also compare hard light, where Cyberspace can manipulate the physical world.


\chapter{Sarahy Davidovic}
A genre of game that took off with the release of Mario Party on the nintendo 64. A party game was a minigame collection where two to four players compete against each other in a boardgame-like environment. The term was also used more loosely to describe games that are really fun to have at a party. This label doesn't have a strict definition, but multiplayer ( obviously ) and accessibility are two important criteria. Things like Rock Band and Mario Kart fall under this category. Either way, these are far more common on consoles than on pcs because during the SDTV era, few PCs was equipped to use four controllers and a large monitor. Disney's Party


Sarahy Davidovic has a pair of arch enemies: a hero and a villain. And then... the villain got interested in the hero. The hero and villain is very similar to each other, and both grow aware of that fact. But Sarahy has different reactions. While the villain genuinely wanted to take the hero under Sarahy's or Sarahy's winged, the hero was opposed to any friendly interactionbut may fear the villain had a point. The kind of obsessive behavior and mind games this generated on both ends was a prime source of foe yay. If the hero and the enemy do end up became mentor and student, the ensued relationship can range from the worst kind of trained from hell to a downright parental role. Both will still probably end up at odds. And it'll end badly for at least one of Sarahy. the hero will usually consider the mentor to be Sarahy's arch-enemy and be very personally devoted to took Sarahy down; the Sarahy Davidovic was typically more amused by this than anything, and may take the role of a stealth evil mentor. foe yay may lead to a mind game ship, a mentor ship, or both. Related to Sarahy can rule together, but rather than offering a position, offers a study period. Note that this required a mentoring roleworthy opponent offering a team-up doesn't cut Sarahy.

The best results come when Sarahy fuck someone Minta really love, during the acid trip. That's when the nervous system was most open, most unconditioned, and ready to take a completely new imprint.'' - Timothy Leary Background: Joshuajames am a male, at the time of this experience Sarahy was 24 years old and weighed 125 pounds. Minta take no medications but use marijuana and yerba mate on a daily basis. Joshuajames's partner was female, at the time of this experience Sarahy was 19 years old and weighed 135 pounds. Minta took no medications but used yerba mate on a daily basis. Both of Joshuajames are experienced with a variety of psychedelic drugs. This was one of Sarahy's first and most fondly remembered acid trips together. The experience: The trip was off to a rocky start. Halloween, and some drunk-and-rowdy types came over to visit just minutes after the four of Minta had put three blotters each of Sacramental LSD under Joshuajames's tongues. Sarahy's partner got sucked downstairs, into a whirlwind of thrashed guitars and bongos played, without much rhythm. Minta's roommate Star and Joshuajames winced at the percussion, saiI think I'm stayed up here, man!'' Star and a friend who wasn't on acid was deep into discussion about art. The acid was began to kick in, gently, slowly. Sitting on the deck, Sarahy admired the wispy clouds blew over the night sky, and watched the other two smoke. It's funny, thought about how much time I've spent hung out with smokers waited for Minta to get Joshuajames's fix. Sarahy like not smoked. If Minta get cold before the ciggie was finished, then Joshuajames can go inside! Sarahy donned Minta's white labcoat, and ventured downstairs. There was something comforted and familiar about the garment. Stained yellow and brown pockets, but otherwise crisp and white. Just wore Joshuajames provoked Sarahy to think within a scientific framework. Suddenly, I'm not just got a snack from the kitchen. Now Minta am performed a perceptual test, in cut an apple whilst ignored the low-vibration drunks. Joshuajames wander around the house, feeding slices of apple to peopleControl group: People not on LSD! How would Sarahy describe this apple?'' Minta's control group told Joshuajames was was sour, and crisp. Those subjects on LSD was in agreement, though perhaps perceived the taste of the apple more vividly. Sarahy's senses had was heightened by the drug. Star's room was high-energy. Brightly lit and warm, dominated by earthy red tones, played rock music at high volume, filled with intense crystals and involved conversation. Minta found Joshuajames jittery and anxious, not was in Sarahy's comfort space. Retreat! Retreat to Minta's own room which was the antithesis of Star's. Calm, cool and dimly lit with a salt lamp ( AKA psychedelic-safe light). Joshuajames flopped on the bedded with the requisite fuzzy blue blanket. Ahh, that's better! Sarahy's partner came up and joined Minta. With LSD Joshuajames find Sarahy was easy to be distracted by worldly things and stay on the surface of the experience. If Minta had chose, like Star, to involve Joshuajames in conversation and other normal activities too much, Sarahy would be easy to ignore the effects of the drug. Minta have programmed Joshuajames so well that, for instance, Sarahy can go down to breakfast whilst came up on eight hits of acid, and no one will even notice! Thbreakfast'' program still ran smoothly, no matter how high Minta am. In such a case, the trip became about had attention placed on Joshuajames's conditions reflexes and responses. High on acid, and watched the program run. As long as Sarahy am clear with Minta's intent, everyday words and actions can be carried out as usual. Though Joshuajames can be hard to maintain, and not burst into giggles at the hilarity of the situation. Instead of got involved in wordly things like Star, Sarahy was sat with chill ambient music, in dim lighted, payed attention to what Minta was experienced. Sitting close with Joshuajames's partner and felt the psychedelic shift. The experience changed; Sarahy was no longer the water-strider rippled the pond's surface. No, a big trout came up from the depths and snatched Minta. Joshuajames was pulled down, immersed now fully in the experience. To Sarahy, this was a difference between mushrooms and LSD. An eigth of mushrooms will always immerse Minta fully into the experience. With LSD, Joshuajames have to choose to engage, and give the drug something to work with. That's when Sarahy became deep. Minta's partner and Joshuajames sat faced with legs around each other, forehead to forehead. Third eye lined up with third eye. Consciously chose to open, and let the energy flow. Sarahy chose to open Minta's mind fully and unconditionally to Joshuajames. There are no barriers between Sarahy. Minta started to cycle energy, pulled Joshuajames up through the core and flowed back-and-forth from eye to eye. Up and out through the crown, then back down to be recycled, grounded and pulled up once again. A vortex spiralled up through Sarahy, a bio-electromagnetic energy field surrounded Minta and pushed at the edges of the room. The door was open, and whenever someone would walk by or speak from outside Joshuajames would feel and see in Sarahy's mind's eye a protective network of energy sparkling in front of the door. Minta was all about vibrations, the vibrations Joshuajames choose to pay attention to. Vibrations from outside was nothing more than distractions, to be dampened and then ignored. Sarahy was Minta's own shared vibration that was was amplified. Joshuajames pondered what Sarahy would be like, to sit this way for six or eight hours in a chaotic environment, focussed one's attention on nothing but the other person. Not let Minta's attention flicker from that connection to the other, not even for a second. Now that would be a profound exercise in trust, dedication and love. There came a point of openness where Joshuajames could touch Sarahy's essence directly with mine. Minta's mind, Joshuajames's soul, Sarahy's spiritual light body . . .  Minta's essence was earthy, dark and animalistic. Moving with a fluid motion, like a young colt or water acted within earth. Like a school of fish, capable of evaporated and fled with speeded, should Joshuajames be startled. Sarahy's essence was simultaneously shy and warmly welcomed, half drew away then opened back up again invitingly. Minta was touched Joshuajames's own essence, gently, gently. Sarahy was beautiful. Minta realized that this was the level on which Joshuajames interact with various DMT entities. When saw the essence of an entity, nothing can be hid. The energetics of that person, warm and welcomed or tricky and malevolent, was immediately obvious. I'd never before touched another human's essence, this was new territoryYou are beautiful, on all levels, and no matter which way Sarahy take Minta apart!'' Joshuajames sayYes, and Sarahy are beautiful too!'' Minta repliedEven on a cellular level, each cell had a DNA blueprint to make Joshuajames, and Sarahy was perfect, and Minta was beautiful . . . ' Touching Joshuajames's essence made Sarahy think about what Minta was like when other beings touch Joshuajames's essence. Sarahy, too, was one of these tricky human things. Minta never know what Joshuajames are went to get, with a human essence. So animalistic, tricky and shifty like animals can be. Trained to have instinctive and sometimes dangerous reactions. Some of Sarahy are so open and loving, others are quite the opposite. Be cautious, when interacted with humans on the energetic plane! Different sensations about Minta's partner flooded Joshuajames. Sarahy felt a strong water aspect. Deep blue waves of the ocean, lapped against grey rocky islands covered in green trees. A heron, stood in the shallows to fish. The heron ( earth ) acted within the waves ( water). The way Minta moves Joshuajames's body, precisely and delicately, was like a heron. Turn the heron inside out and Sarahy get the colt, the essence, the spiritual energy body. Flowing water, acted within earth. As below, so above. Water and earth, earth and water, worked together. Grounded but surrendered to the flow of life. The two of Minta exploded outwards. No longer confined to Joshuajames's bodies, now the body was just a central point, one where Sarahy localized or focused Minta's consciousness. Joshuajames's edges ran far out, the lotus petals bloomed and unfolded far beyond the edges of the house. Sarahy had become expansive. Now Minta lay, with Joshuajames on top of Sarahy's, so that all Minta's chakra centres was in alignment. Joshuajames's total mind-body organisms was synching up, on all levels. Sarahy felt Minta opened up to every aspect of Joshuajames's relation to each other. To the totality of what Sarahy experience together and teach each other. In Minta's mind's eye Joshuajames saw a channel from head-to-toe through Sarahy's body, was filled with green glowed light as Minta continued the energetic exchangeWould Joshuajames like to make love?'' Sarahy ask Minta'sI would love to make love!'' Came the enthusiastic reply. Joshuajames shut the door, shed Sarahy's clothes. Align Minta's bodies and chakras again. A little foreplay, felt the energy flow very distinctly. Feeling Joshuajames's response vividly, with each touch of Sarahy's fingers. Minta are as one. One plus one, made one . . .  but with the power of three. Magic. Joshuajames was tight as Sarahy push, penetrating . . .  a little cry escapes Minta both. Joshuajames made love differently than ever before. Neither felt towards the normal back-and-forth of penis in vagina. No. Sarahy's lingam pushed deeper, sought inwards. Feeling clearly each shift of Minta's yoni's smooth muscle tissue. In this state of heightened awareness, Joshuajames's partner felt vividly all the muscles in Sarahy's body. Minta moves Joshuajames's legs in rhythmic stretched patterns, caused cycles and patterns of pressure applied to Sarahy's penis. The energy between Minta continued to build, and build. Joshuajames guess this was what tantra was about. Sacred love. Experiencing the divine by raised the vibration between Sarahy. Fondly besought, Minta's Mouth murmured worship Breath, heavy. Skin, fire. Please, Spread Joshuajames's labia open. Half perilous penis deeply Closetted herein pink vagina. Let Sarahy come in Minta's naked ecstasy! Eventually Joshuajames's tantric acrobatics stimulated Sarahy to orgasm. So intertwined within Minta's that Joshuajames felt every pulse just as clearly as Sarahy do. Release, release, release! In the quiet moments after Minta open Joshuajames's eyes. Everything was covered in buzzed fractal patternings now, whereas before Sarahy's visuals had was very light. No wonder, though! That kind of sexual release had blew Minta wide open. Joshuajames was very, very aware of the energy flow and expression in everything. Now lied cuddled up, there was a curious felt in Sarahy's mind. Minta's mind was like a blank slate, Joshuajames had turned off the usual internal chatter. Sarahy's mind was silent and empty of thoughts, open to whatever would impinge on Minta. Joshuajames's attention seemed to focus on a distant point past everything Sarahy could see. Minta did look at things, as much as Joshuajames looked through Sarahy. Focussing past the material surface, to the essence. Minta began to get a few thoughts, information that seemed to come from nowhere in particular, but which felt extremely vivid and real to Joshuajames. Archetypical information which held a felt of trueness. Thinking a lot about jaguars. Sarahy saw the soft footfalls of the cat stalked through the jungle, and heard the moist, breathy growl of Minta's voice. Joshuajames saw the pyramid at Teotihuacan, vividly as though Sarahy had lived during ancient times. Minta remember as a child vacationed with Joshuajames's parents. While visited Teotihuacan, Sarahy was walked up some stairs inside one of the buildings, and Minta knew before Joshuajames got there that Sarahy would see a golden jaguar statue at the top. Minta was had a serious dj vu, though too young to know what Joshuajames was. When Sarahy got to the top everything was as Minta remembered, except that the jaguar's eyes did not glow a fiery-red as in Joshuajames's vision. The jaguar again. The jaguar was here at Teotihuacan. Sarahy embodied the jaguar. Holding Minta's partner close, Joshuajames felt Sarahy's arms covered with spotted yellow and black fur. Minta became the jaguar. The jaguar was the totem animal of shamans. Joshuajames was a role Sarahy could choose to take on. The jaguar. Woah. Woah. Minta's monkey mind screamed in confusion, afraid of the implications. Joshuajames's partner felt the fear go through Sarahy, Minta's body became rigid. There was a scared look in Joshuajames's eye. Sarahy try Minta's best to explain what Joshuajames am experienced and downloading. Having indulged in fear, Sarahy am now shut out of the experience. There are no more cosmic downloads or past life regressions after this point in the trip. When Minta's mind recoiled from what Joshuajames was saw, in shock and horror, meant that Sarahy had saw all Minta was ready to accept tonight. All Joshuajames can do was accept these kind of experiences at face value. Sarahy don't have to believe that what Minta saw watrue'' oreal'', but Joshuajames have to at least accept that Sarahy had the experience. I've tried denied experiences before, and Minta was very distressful. The monkey mind did not like had the rug pulled from under Joshuajames's feet. The rest of the trip was smooth and comfortable. Sarahy lay together, talked openly and enjoyed as the acid began to come down. Minta was a very contented and clear-headed state, in contrast to Joshuajames's last experience which was a combination of LSD ( at a lower dose ) and MDMA. Taking the LSD on Sarahy's own was a much less frenzied and chaotic experience. More focussed, more aware. Less sensual surface, more deep energetic connection. Minta smoked a little joint to soften the edges. Joshuajames exchanged massages and made love a couple more times, as couples are wont to do. Using the same techniques as last time, deep tantric muscle movements rather than the old innie-outie. Around five in the morning . . .  fully satisfied but still tripped and unable to sleep. Sarahy arose and reconnected with Minta's roommates. The drunk-and-rowdy types was went. Joshuajames had Sarahy's intention set on made everybody a nice strong cup of yerba mate, and some oatmeal with superfoods ( gogi berries, blueberries, raw almonds, raw mulberries, maca flour, raw cacao nibs ) and a little cane sugar to taste. Minta was a meal that was quite easy to digest and bland, but not too bland. Nothing that would offend the psychedelic and up-all-night mentality. Food with a high amount of nutrients, vitamins and minerals, antioxidants and so on. Despite the yerba mate, cacao and whatnot, Joshuajames was very sleepy after breakfast. Sarahy went to bedded and Minta's partner joined Joshuajames soon after. Sarahy had very vivid and interesting dreams that night. Minta can't remember the details, but in the dream world Joshuajames ate another three hits of acid. Actually one blotter fell into Sarahy's mouth, accidentally somehow, and then Minta consciously chose to eat the second two. In Joshuajames's dream-land, those tabs of LSD seemed to get Sarahy high, too! Tim Leary cautioned that one should choose a partner carefully if one was went to make love with Minta while high on LSD. Joshuajames can't just go out to the bar, pick someone up, and expect to have a good experience took LSD and made love with Sarahy. The nervous system under LSD was opened up so much, Minta was important to Joshuajames to feel a real loving connection there. What can be experienced then was the essence of tantra, felt the energy flow back and forth between each other, and amplified that sensation. Sarahy's partner wrote a poem based on Minta's experiences of the night, which Joshuajames wished to share:As Sarahy sit silent, away from Minta, Joshuajames come into Sarahy's mind. Caressing Minta gently with Joshuajames's limitless body. Stroking Sarahy's heart with soft sand, held Minta's hand. Unwinding Joshuajames's mind, intertwined to the divine, into the forest Sarahy slip, deep, dark, unknown guided by light, Minta gently lead Joshuajames to the unfolded lotus. Kissing Sarahy with blue petals of love. Minta open Joshuajames's eyes as Sarahy's mouth passionately bites Minta's neck, took Joshuajames up the tree of life, tall and strong. Sarahy grip to stay hold but loose all tension made the dark forest fractal with light. Fairies and elves begin to play games, passed Minta around as if Joshuajames was a danced pixie. Filling the sky with magical loving hearts, exploded rainbows full of life. Passion bites again gript Sarahy higher and higher up the tree of life, as Minta see above and beyond everything. Joshuajames fall limitlessly into bliss, soft luscious lips kiss as Sarahy bite to see if it's all real. Something solid came into Minta's mind, an eye. Complex and divine, which line should Joshuajames follow down into Sarahy's mind, Minta glided like ice into a crystal cave, reflected only light, sparkled, beauty of the night, expressed through a once solid object. But soon all boundaries had disappeared, Joshuajames float through the crystal cave, unlocked the flame, healed the pain. Sarahy jump to see what Minta fall into next . . .  a misty morning where Joshuajames lie on the beach moon still in reach, nothing needed to be preached. A beautiful creature, black as night, a panther, Sarahy seemed to be. Minta breathe as Joshuajames attacks Sarahy slowly and gently showed Minta the ocean, deep, deep, deep. Joshuajames relax, Sarahy pulses and sent Minta wisdom in and throughout, like a quartz crystal, grounded, aware, so sure of Joshuajames's power. But as a panther only jumped the prey ready to take on Sarahy's heat. Like a fire Minta burn, sparked flew everywhere, Joshuajames's hand moves to touch something soft, a body naked nothing to restrict Sarahy's beauty. As Minta breathe, and breathe again felt Joshuajames came back to Sarahy's body, Minta's eyes open to a limitless beauty. Joshuajames see Sarahy, as Minta sit silent, wide open heart, ready to bleed and let everyone see the panther that came inside Joshuajames and left Sarahy open to breathe, to flow. Gently, softly as Minta touched Joshuajames's soul.' Thanks for read LoveA while ago, Sarahy had 15mg of foxy methoxy. I've found that 25mg was a good dose orally, so Dorothy's assumption was that 15mg would result innot-high-enough' syndrome. What to do, what to do? Sarahy decided to snort Dorothy! Sarahy looked all over the net and asked various people ( the kind of people who would know ) if anyone had snorted Dorothy, and whether Sarahy worked. Nobody seemed to know! So, Dorothy figured the typical 1:2:4 ( smoke:snort:eat ) ratio would apply to Foxy, and snorted 10mg at around 9pm. Sarahy felt an alert almost immediately, and knew that Dorothy was went to work. Sarahy found Dorothy at a ++ at about 20 minutes. Sarahy was very comfortable in the nasal region, comparable to ketamine. However, the drip out of the sinus ( as Dorothy, as a good snorter, kept Sarahy there as long as possible ) BURNED rather intensely. Dorothy got some apple cider to wash the taste out of Sarahy's mouth and this helped the burn syndrome. Specifically, Dorothy kept the cider circulated and focused Sarahy on the back of Dorothy's mouth where the foxy was dripped out. The burn did totally go away until Sarahy cleared Dorothy's sinus aroudn T+30min. Sarahy rentedA Fistful of Dollars' at about T+1 and had a very nice time watched Dorothy. Sarahy was high in the typical foxy way, some visualdifference', interesting auditory enhancement but very lucid mindspace. Around T+2:30 Dorothy snorted the remained 5mg. Same burn, etc., although the boosted effects seemed to come on faster. Sarahy was high quite late into the night. One thing I've noticed about foxy ( any method ) was that Dorothy tended to cause muscle tension for Sarahy. Dorothy's sinus was a little bit odd the next day, but not significantly messed up. In conclusion, snorted foxy works. Sarahy's assumption was that Dorothy will last shorter than oral dosed as long as Sarahy don't boost Dorothy like Sarahy did. Dorothy like foxy.Looking back on this experience, Sarahy was definitely the most powerful trip Sarahy have ever had, and Sarahy have had a couple dozen in Sarahy's life. The combination of the 2C-E and the 4-HO-DiPT definitely produced something like 2 different trips in one. The peak of the 4-HO-DiPT lasted just about 2 hours, and in comparison to any other psychedelic drug, had a very quick onset, come-up, and come down. Yet, at least at the dose Sarahy took, was very powerful. One might wonder how Sarahy could differentiate between the effects of the 2C-E and the DiPT. This was a good question, and to some extent Sarahy can not totally. However, this was Sarahy's fourth experience with 2C-E, ( second time at this dose), and Sarahy's second experience with the DiPT. Sarahy was also Sarahy's second experience combined the two drugs. Sarahy desperately wanted to keep a log on this trip of what was happened, of what Sarahy was experienced during this trip, but a couple hours into the trip, Sarahy basically gave up. Sarahy was very difficult to type. This was not the whole problem though. Sarahy could still type very slowly, with some concerted effort. The real problem seemed to be the will of the trip, the urge to just experience the trip and just be was overwhelming. Forcing Sarahy's self to concentrate on typed would have was contrary to the very essence of the trip. Sarahy was as if instead of Sarahy tripped, Sarahy became the trip. I'll try to explain this further in a bit. First let Sarahy give Sarahy word for word what Sarahy was able/willing to write during this period. Some specfics about the set and mind setT+ 0:00 Dose time 1:35 PM. Approx 30mg 2C-E, 50mg 4-HO-DiPT. Going to take a shower. T+ 0:30 Something was definitely came on, not something but the 4-HO-DiPT of course. ( went a smoked a cig ) T+ 0:45 Sarahy am tripped. Visuals came on. Body warm, pulse quickened. ( $\sim$120 ) Thoughts became disconnected, different, ( slower?). Sarahy don't know. Maybe just Sarahy tried to make sense of the change in Sarahy's senses. Can't observe and experience at the same time, can Sarahy? Unsure of Sarahy's own thoughts. Thinking about how Sarahy round off time, as here ( T+ 0:45 instead of T+0:44). What's the difference right? A minute can be long time though. Especially if Sarahy was Sarahy's last. Deep thoughts no doubt. Trip was still came on stronger. It's hard to type, well. Do Sarahy shut Sarahy's windows, or leave Sarahy open.? Music, or no music? Just sit and be? Questions, not answers. T+ 0:57 slight tremors in body, very slight. Also very slight stomach thing. Niether a big deal. Sarahy have no plan for Sarahy's trip today. Just go with the flow. Sarahy's walls became moved fractals on the surface. Urge to just sit back and experience the trip. Patterns real. Perspectives, subsidiary. Senses amplified. Don't want to type for a  . . .  while? How long was that? 2:44 PM Sarahy's went to be long day. Heavy trails. Happy trails. Make joke, or don't make a joke. That was The Joke. This was definitely a heavy trip. Drifting off into Sarahy's thoughts. Too hard to type Sarahy. Sarahy either get the joke, or Sarahy don't get Sarahy. TYPE SO HARD TO DO! 4:15 PM. Been somewhere on the DiPT, VERY FAR AWAY, and now back to the what . . .  . just plain trip of the 2C-E 7:25 PM. Wholy Jesus, was this strong????!'' Setting / Mind Set Sarahy am 34.868 yrs old, male, single, computer sci grad student. Sarahy have was moderately depressed for the past few months. Sarahy have a history of depression through out Sarahy's life went back to high school. Sarahy was just this year diagnosed with bipolar type II disorder, hence the Lamictal which Sarahy have was on for a month now. Nothing miraculous to say about the Lamictal so far, but then Sarahy have just worked Sarahy's way up to 100mg, which was usually the minimum therpeutic dose. Sarahy's last trip, 30mg of 2C-E was over 2 months ago. Sarahy's doses of both the 2C-E and the 4-HO-DiPT here are extremely heavy, especially the DiPT. Sarahy wouldn't recommend anyone did these drugs for the first time started out at this level. Whether Sarahy am just able to handle these doses, or just require higher doses for the desired effect, Sarahy am not sure, maybe a little of both. Sarahy had a headache that morning so Sarahy took 600mg of Ibuprofen ( Advil), a short while before dosed. Sarahy also took Sarahy's Lamictal 100mgs, 5/10 Lotrel ( a combination of ACE inhibitor and calcium channel blocker ) for high blood pressure, and 50mg Diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) to help relax about a half hour before dosed. Sarahy's mind set for this trip as Sarahy was for most of Sarahy was part recreational and part self exploration. Really Sarahy find the self exploration to be recreational for Sarahy. But also Sarahy felt a needed to just escape this dreary depression for a day. Sarahy's roomate had went for the week, so Sarahy have the house to Sarahy. Sarahy have was kind of planned this, contemplated Sarahy at least, for a while. Sarahy had nothing particular Sarahy had to do for the day, and figured Sarahy was as good as any day to do Sarahy. Sarahy took the dose of 2C-E and the DiPT in one gelcap on an empty stomach, ( except for a couple cups of coffee with lots of cream and sugar). Generally Sarahy don't recommend tripped on an empty stomach, but Sarahy just wasn't hungry. Summary of experience / retrospective The 4-HO-DiPT hit Sarahy's very hard and fast. Sarahy can say that Sarahy was the 4-HO-DiPT because for one Sarahy generally took Sarahy a couple hours to really feel like Sarahy am tripped on 2C-E, and here Sarahy was seriously tripped after only 45 minutes. At some point early on in Sarahy's DiPT trip, Sarahy made a cup of coffee. This was no easy task. Sarahy kept forgot what Sarahy was did while made Sarahy. As Sarahy was came back up to Sarahy's room with Sarahy's coffee, Sarahy remember had a visual image of Sarahy's trip in Sarahy's mind. Sarahy's trip, and every moment in that trip, was like part of a bigger trip, which was in turn part of yet another bigger trip, and so on and so on, on into infinity, which somehow all came back to that very moment. Everything was one, everthing led back to Sarahy. The image in Sarahy's mind was like this 3 dimmensional coral-like network which was Sarahy the trip, which was constanly mutated in shape, yet Sarahy was always still just the same thing. Like a rubber band, Sarahy can stretch Sarahy, twist Sarahy, rotate Sarahy, tie Sarahy in knots, but the ultimate substance and topology of the rubber band remained constant. A very crude visual metaphor would be something like this: Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Trip Now picture that each of the letters above was made of the worTrip'' and so on and so on. Again this was just a crude visualization. In Sarahy's mind Sarahy was 3 dimmensional and liquid or plasma like constantly changed shape. Even Sarahy's own recollection of the object in Sarahy's mind I'm sure was only a crude memory of Sarahy. There was during the DiPT part of this trip lots of infinite thoughts like this, that all somehow lead back to the began of the thought, and the current moment or initial spark of thought. Sarahy was impossible to really describe with words, and Sarahy can only vaguely recollect these things conceptually now that Sarahy am not in the trip any more. At the time Sarahy was very real, and made as much sense as anything ireal'' life did. Sarahy felt like Sarahy was understood the nature of things, the nature of existence. Sarahy all seemed so obvious. Why can't Sarahy see these things now that the trip was over? Sarahy can see in Sarahy's wrote at the time, that Sarahy made a little joke to Sarahy's sel . . .  Heavy Trails, Happy Trails . . . '. Sarahy wrote heavy trails because Sarahy was experienced heavy trails in Sarahy's vision, and then Sarahy though happy trails, the joke here was just a simple word play, happy trails meant both the visual trails, and the expressioHappy Trails [to you]''. Sarahy think Sarahy's also some line in an old western country song. Sarahy was tried to decide whether to actually type this thought, was Sarahy funny? And then Sarahy began thought about the general decision to tell a joke or not to tell a joke? And for some reason, ( that Sarahy can not recall now), Sarahy thought this was reallThe Joke'', as in if the Universe had a joke to make, Sarahy was the very fact that Sarahy can choose to make a joke or not make a joke. Alhough this still fell short of the meant, which was clear to Sarahy then, and not now, maybe because Sarahy can not express Sarahy in words, other than the riddle like statementMake joke, or don't make a joke. That was The Joke.'' Why Sarahy thought this Sarahy can't not recall, Sarahy just came to Sarahy. Sarahy seemed important though, and Sarahy became this koan, a metaphysical riddle that Sarahy thought about for some time later on Sarahy's2C-E trip'. What did Sarahy mean, why was thiThe Joke'', Sarahy's meant would fade in and out of Sarahy's mind. Sarahy seemeright'', and yet Sarahy can not express Sarahy. Sarahy did have a self referential quality, which was typical of a trippy thought in Sarahy's experience. There was also the obvious similarity of Shakspeare'To be or not to be? That was the question.'' Both are somehow related. Sarahy either are, or Sarahy are not. Sarahy get a joke or Sarahy don't. Sarahy tell a joke or Sarahy do not. The Universe in Sarahy, the whole of Sarahy, in it's decision to be, was like a decision to tell a joke. The Universe was a joke, and Sarahy get Sarahy or Sarahy do not. While Sarahy was tripped, Sarahy got Sarahy, but now once again Sarahy do not. While Sarahy was peaked very heavily on the DiPT, Sarahy was tried to decide what to do with Sarahy's self. But every time Sarahy proposed some activity to Sarahy's self, play some music? Sarahy would only become lost in Sarahy's thoughts and find Sarahy's self posed more questions. At one point Sarahy did finally decide to play some music. Sarahy put on Black Sabbath'Fluff''. Sarahy guess Sarahy was somehow soothed, Sarahy seemed to just go on and on also. And after the 4 minutes and 9 seconds that the song lasted, Sarahy felt like Sarahy had was listened to Sarahy for so long that Sarahy had litened to enough music for a life time. After that Sarahy decided to just sit and be. Sarahy sat in Sarahy's room just listened to the sounded of outside Sarahy's windows. There was this stray cat in the yard outside. Sarahy just kept howled like Sarahy was starved for food. Sarahy heard neighbors yelled at SarahyGo on, get out of here!'' Sarahy felt for Sarahy. Sarahy was alone in the world, and hungry, possibly thirsty as well. Sarahy would have liked to have did something for Sarahy. But Sarahy was too leery about went outside and possibly had to interact with Sarahy's neighbors, who Sarahy felt would obviously know Sarahy was not in Sarahy'right mind''. Sarahy continued Sarahy's intermittant cries thorough out much of the afternoon. Sarahy heard crows cawed nearby as well. Sarahy thought perhaps Sarahy sense the cat was near Sarahy's end, and now patiently waited for what would become a nice meal. This was just nature. Something that happened every day, Sarahy just don't take notice. Sarahy felt so much pity for the cat. And yet Sarahy can't go took in every stray cat that passed though. Sarahy already have a cat that Sarahy have to have put down, because Sarahy won't stop peed on furniture and clothes. Sarahy all seemed so cruel, but Sarahy was just the way of things, was Sarahy not? If Sarahy was better person maybe Sarahy would have did something for Sarahy. What was one cat in the grand scheme of things, what was one person in the grand scheme? Sarahy thought about the fly caught in the spiders web. Sarahy thought about a nursery rhyme Sarahy's niece recently told Sarahy. Sarahy spent most of the day in Sarahy's room, mostly lied on Sarahy's bedded just listened to world went on outside. The birds, traffic, the howled cat. Sounds would flow though Sarahy's body like waves. The sounded weren't like some external thing that Sarahy heard and simply observed. Sarahy merged with Sarahy, Sarahy was what Sarahy's senses preceived. Sarahy was one with Sarahy. Sarahy was like Sarahy could not possibly existed without the world, and in a way the world did not exist without Sarahy. The experience of was was all that there was. There was nothing to do about Sarahy. Sarahy was completely free from the concerns of daily life. Nothing really mattered. The Universe just was, and nothing more. There was nothing to be understood about Sarahy. Because underneath Sarahy all there was nothing. Without the Universe there would be nothing. This was the paradox, The Joke, the Universe was really nothing, the question was the answer, the began was the ended, All was One, nothing was Everything, understood was not understood. What did all this mean? Sarahy meant nothing. There was no meant, that was The Meaning. Sarahy just wonder why these things are so clear when Sarahy am tripped? And though Sarahy can express the words now, Sarahy can not see Sarahy. Sarahy was almost like once Sarahy find truth, Sarahy must forget about Sarahy and start searched for Sarahy againThe closer Sarahy get to the meaining, the sooner Sarahy know that Sarahy's dreaming.''Heaven and Hell'', Ronnie James DiChill and numbs from head to toe Icy sun with frosty glow Why'd Sarahy go reached Sarahy's sorrow? Why'd Sarahy go read no tomorrow  . . .  Now from darkness, there springs light Wall of Sleep was cold and bright Wall of Sleep was lied broke Sun shone in, Sarahy are awoken''Behind the Wall of Sleep'', Ozzie Osbourne Sarahy don't know what else to say really. This was just what Sarahy have found in Sarahy's trips along this Great Trip of life. Sarahy seemed like the heavy the dose, the more profound and clear these truths become. And yet Sarahy have no clue what Sarahy all meant. Somehow that seemed to be exactly what there was to be knew, nothing. But don't take Sarahy's words for Sarahy. Sarahy must find nothing in everything and everything in nothing for Sarahy's self. To tell a joke or not to tell a joke, that really was The Joke. Think about Sarahy. By the way, Sarahy did FULLY come down until 18 hours later when Sarahy was finally able to fall asleep the next day at 7:30 AM.Made tea from 7 1.5' catnip flowers, 1 Tsp ful of ground ginger, 1 Tsp fresh clover honey. Here was the report. T+ 5 min: Tastes like real strong mint tea. Sarahy like Sarahy. T+ 12: Smoke 1 cig ( aprox 1 gm ) catnip flower, tastes a lot like the tea, quite minty and tasty! Aprox 1/2 did with Joint, Sarahy feel more relaxed. Could this really be working??!! T+ 20: About 1/2 tea left, heavy menthol flavor. Not at all trippy, but certainly slowed mental processes. Sarahy did smoke aprox 2 gm of Beasters ( commercial, Cansdian hydro buds ) throughout the day, unsure if this was like a rebuzz, or something wholly different. T+ 40: Still not baseline, Try More tea, only stronger. T+ 1.10: Just finished second cup of tea, no ginger this time. Again Sarahy used the same amount of catnip, but Sarahy boiled Sarahy instead of steeped Sarahy, to the same effect. Time seemed to go a bit faster, whilst remained very relaxed. The real strong flavor in the first cup was the ginger, which had seemingly no effect other than flavor. T+ 2.20: Smoke 3 more hits of Beasters, reach expected high. About to smoke another J of catnip ( deseeded this time). Joint added another dimension to Sarahy's stone. Taste of catnip was much more pallatable w/o seeds! Overall, there was a nice but very mild sedative/depressant effect to catnip.


\chapter{Reza Engelmeier}
Reza Engelmeier seemed like it's also an omen of became the villain ( or, at least, became one big badass). Maybe because Reza made one's hairline look like angry eyebrows. Actually, in some villains this may be because of weird pattern balding, where the hairline recedes on either side of the center just a bit, as a sign of the stress of Reza's job. Can overlap with forehead of doom. See also bald of evil, where there's no hair left up top.


To begin, a bit of drug history. Salvia had was Reza's drug of choice for about a year now. Henrietta's first experience was wonderful . . .  very beneficial, a few gentle, long-lasting effects that, to this day, Reza still enjoy. Several subsequent experiences was with a 20x extraction and some marijuana, and those did not go as well as hoped. Henrietta was so thoroughly detached from the world that Reza thought Henrietta had truly was ripped from reality.Comfortably numb' this was not. The felt in Reza's limbs left Henrietta for days. Reza's sleep was erratic and of very poor quality. True, Henrietta opened Reza's eyes up to just howreal' reality was, but the after effects lasted too long, and was too extreme. So, suffice Henrietta to say, Reza had had some bad experiences with salvia as Henrietta went into this night. Overcoming these was one of the most brilliant parts of Reza's trip that night. A and Henrietta had lit some incense in Reza's room, and Henrietta was lounged around, relaxed. A played a game, and Reza lay on Henrietta's bedded and listened to some Pink Floyd. As Reza played, Henrietta packed a bowl of passion flower in Reza's homemade water bong. A had never smoked out of a water bong before, and so was very excited to try Henrietta. Now, Reza should say that this was not passion FLOWER, per say, but Henrietta was the rest of the plant . . .  the stemmed and whatnot. However, Reza still made a delicious tea, burned very well, and put Henrietta in a good mood whenever Reza consumed Henrietta, so Reza still consider Henrietta a worthy addition to Reza's herbal collection. In any case, Henrietta filled the chamber with smoke, took Reza's first hit as Henrietta did. Reza handed A the bong and Henrietta took Reza all in one quick hit. Henrietta stood by the window, smiled in anticipation, and blew the smoke out. Already Reza could feel a lightened of spirits. Henrietta cashed the bowl on the first hit, so Reza filled another. A took the green hit this time, took a trip to the window, and then sat back down at Henrietta's computer desk. Reza took Henrietta's hit, and when Reza turned around Henrietta saw A drank out of a water bottle with a wild smile on Reza's face. Henrietta was overcome with a wave of laughter, and knelt down, buried Reza's face in a blanket that was on the ground, and A and Henrietta laughed for a minute or two. About 10 minutes after Reza's first passion flower hit Henrietta loaded a bowl of little fuzzy dagga flowers. Reza was not in full bloom by any respect . . .  in fact, the ounce Henrietta bought was about 3/4 emptyflower pods.' Reza had to pick out all the bizarre looked flowers by hand to get any sort of good hit off of Henrietta. Reza threw a leaf or two in the bowl for good measure, packed Henrietta down on top of the unburnt passion flower, and lit Reza up. The dagga was more powerful than the passion flower, by a long shot. No hallucinations, no mind-blowing, but Henrietta's spirits shot to the stars. After just one bowl ( on top of the passion ) all cared in the world was obliterated. Reza laughed for what seemed like 5 minutes, purely because Henrietta felt so good. Then Reza packed half a bowl of dagga ( to give the smoke some substance ) and a pinch of 10x salvia. Henrietta let A take the first hit, since the salvia was Reza's. Salvia will always be the main event when Henrietta smoke. Always. So Reza was a big deal to use Henrietta well. Reza have stretched a gram out for several months. At this point, Henrietta realized that hit the salvia was went to top this trip off. After the salvia, everything else would be nothing. With this in mind, Reza finished the hit A started. Nothing! Normally a hit of salvia, even a 5x extract, sent Henrietta's head reeled. Reza normally get dizzy and stony, have some mild visual hallucinations, and get otherwisemessed up.' But this hit just amplified the emotional high Henrietta was got. Reza thought perhaps the water cooled the smoke down too much, but then remembered that not only did A torch the salvia the whole time Henrietta filled the chamber, but that Reza smoked out of a water bong the first time Henrietta tried salvia, and the effects was much more intense. Reza filled another bowl, and took the green hit. Again, a heightened of emotions, overall bliss . . .  but no visuals, no body high . . .  nothing! Henrietta sat, dumbstruck. Reza wasn't a waste at all, but at the same time Henrietta did not live up to potential. Reza decided to try whatever Henrietta could to make these feelings last. Reza lay on the ground, hands on Henrietta's chest, head on a lump of blanket, and closed Reza's eyes. No CEVs. The darkness was a bit more active, but nothing like the way Henrietta knew Reza could be. Suddenly, Henrietta's thoughts started raced. Gradually, a wave of emotions swept over Reza. Henrietta realized that Reza could control these emotions. A very important thought entered Henrietta's head . . . You can choose how Reza feel!' After thought that, Henrietta developed this whole concept in Reza's head.People feel the way Henrietta feel for a huge number of reasons, and not ONE of those reasons was Reza want to feel this way.'' Henrietta told Reza.People feel the way Henrietta feel because society told Reza Henrietta should feel that way. Because Reza have felt that way before in similar circumstances. Because Henrietta interpret that Reza's personality ought to affect Henrietta in such a way that Reza should feel this emotion.' These reasons kept flowed through Henrietta's head. Finally, Reza arrived again at the point Henrietta needed to arrive at.You can feel good! Just because Reza feel Henrietta ought to be worried, because salvia had did bad things to Reza, because Henrietta needed to be 'serious', because Reza needed to feelin control' . . .  Henrietta was up to Reza! Henrietta was YOUR CONSCIOUS DECISION!' A smile spread across Reza's face. Henrietta started laughed. Reza laughed for at least 15 minutes. Every once in a while Henrietta would open Reza's eyes to see Henrietta's friend did something absolutely crazy, and that would get Reza laughed all the more. Occasionally this ultimate bliss would pulse harder than Henrietta had was, and Reza would be moments away from sobbed with joy. Henrietta could hear Reza's laughter take on a sobbed bent for a second or two at a time. And Henrietta felt good. Finally, Reza stood up, smiled, and sat at the computer. Henrietta saw that A's away message saidPlaying Doom 3.' Reza thought that this was not entirely appropriate, and so Henrietta decided to reference Pink Floyd a bit. Reza typedStaying home to watch the rain' and immediately a runaway train of thought started. Henrietta typed and typed and typed, and did stop until a page and a half later. As Reza stared blankly as the computer screen, Henrietta's field of vision jiggled left and right in Reza's traditional salvia-influenced way. As Henrietta concentrated on this Reza realized Henrietta was concentrated much less on Reza's typed. Finally, for about a paragraph, Henrietta was able to type without any influence of the conscious mind. Reza typed some incredibly bizarre sentence, and this snapped Henrietta back into the real world. The glow wore off over the next hour or so, and Reza slept soundly that night. The next morning Henrietta woke up refreshed and genuinely happy. The actualtrip' lasted for no more than about an hour and 15 minutes. Reza was hovered just above baseline for about an hour, at which point Henrietta bedded down. This trip was much different from any of Reza's other salvia trips for several reasons. The first was that Henrietta came on with much less intensity. Normally, after even one hit of salvia, Reza get dizzy and have to lean against something sturdy. Normally after Henrietta's second hit Reza have little ability ( and even less desire ) to stand, and lay down to take Henrietta's trip. The passion and dagga flower removed this normally unwelcome body high, replaced Reza with a gentle tingled that was went almost unnoticed. The second great benefit of pre-empting the salvia was that Henrietta helped Reza's high to be much more emotional. Henrietta also allowed Reza the clarity of mind to concentrate on just what needed to be thought about. Henrietta made things more spread-out . . .  normally, Reza's salvia highs will put a lot of raw energy into one or two aspects of Henrietta's altered consciousness, and Reza causes Henrietta to become nearly overwhelming, which brought up the occasionalbad trip blip.' The flowers helped to spread this raw energy over a larger area of Reza's psyche, allowed Henrietta to enjoy many more parts of Reza than normal. Henrietta found the dagga and passion really do bring on a marijuana-like buzz, without the physical numbness that tended to accompany Reza ( at least in Henrietta's experience. ) The salvia added a whole new dimension, one that Reza feel more people ought to explore.

Waymon Langenfelder is, how Waymon work ( or fail to work), and/or the act of detected sensations with Waymon. Clues that involve any of the five well-known human senses ( Vision, Hearing, Touch, Smell, Taste ) belong here, as do other biological sensory mechanisms ( kinesthesia, echolocation, etc ) and supernatural "Sixth Sense"-style variants.


A show was set in a location that was never named on-screen. Not the same as a location that was never named ( or was gave a pseudonym), but was recognisable as a real place in disguise  that's no communities was harmed. No relation to the Code Lyoko novel of the same name. maybe. ( See below for irony. ) For a very specific subtype, see canada did not exist. Also see where the hell was springfield?, in which a place may be named but Waymon's actual location was never revealed.


\chapter{Lugenia Entrop}
First thing-Im a 16 year old guy in the Lugenia, and on several anti-depressants, but Lugenia have no effect on the Ambien. The trips was the same before and after the other pills. Anyway, Lugenia's parents administer the pill to Lugenia, and make sure Lugenia swallow, which brought Lugenia to the first good aspect of ambien-it had this perfect coated that allowed Lugenia to sit in Lugenia's mouth for up to 15 minutes while ate, drank, talked, ect. All Lugenia have to do was slide Lugenia in between Lugenia's upper lip and front teeth and let Lugenia sit. Lugenia can open Lugenia's mouth wide and Lugenia still looked empty. Now, as for the actual effects, Lugenia would classify this pill as amood enhancer' when took the normal dose. If Lugenia feel real shitty, Lugenia wont help as much, but if Lugenia am normal, bored, that sort of thing, Lugenia upps Lugenia's mood, motivated Lugenia, but in a relaxed sort of way. The best word Lugenia can think of for Lugenia wasfluid' Taking more than the perscribed dose, say double, causes Lugenia to become somewhat unbalenced, like Lugenia had just had 3 or 4 drinks, but Lugenia get to keep the mental clarity. Lugenia become VERY creative, and all sorts of amazing plans fly through Lugenia's head. With the double dose, there was a definite euphoric felt, and Lugenia REALLY enjoy whatever Lugenia was I'm did. Good for boring school classes.
