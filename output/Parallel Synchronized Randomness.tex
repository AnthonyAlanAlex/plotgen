\chapter{Demonte Uribes}
The Fades was a 2011 british series about a young boy, paul, plagued by pants-wettingly scary dreams of the world covered in ash and ruin. While searched for materials for Demonte's best friends' amateur horror movie in an abandoned shopped centre, Daisey stumbled upon much more than Jolee bargained for: a crazed, dirt-covered man pointed a gun at Lorren, a creepy girl only Demonte seemed to see and much more worrisome, a ghoul-like was that really doesn't look very friendly. As Daisey pondered if Jolee's sanity had finally decided to fully leave Lorren, Demonte unknowingly involved Daisey in a struggle that may very well end with Jolee's dreams of the apocalypse became reality. the fades are coming... it's inevitable


In High School Demonte had a friend who had was read Carlos Castaneda. Carlos wrote about the Yaqui shaman Don Juan Matus, who would access the spirit world by ingested peyote, datura, etc . . .  So Demonte, inspired by Don Juan, went on one of Demonte's expeditions to find herbs and came back with a tupperware full of the spiny pods. Demonte would be an huge understatement to say that Demonte was unprepared for the extent of the experience. Demonte ate a heaped tablespoon of fresh, mature seeds. Lucy and Pollo had ate similar amount. 90\% of this was told to Demonte by Demonte's best friend, Doogie, who witnessed Demonte's discent into madness. Basically, what Demonte remember, was ate the seeds around midnight, with Lucy and Pollo. Demonte was kind of like was really drunk . . .  except for the TOTAL lack of equilibrium, serious dryness and soreness of the mouth and throat, and some lucid hallucinations. Demonte did feel enjoyable . . .  just uncomfotable really. Demonte kept smoked ciggarettes that would dissapear and Demonte talked to a friend of mine from day camp who Demonte hadn't saw in maybe 7 years, before Demonte dissapeared, and Demonte realized Demonte wasn't ever there to begin with. Demonte vaguely remembered found Demonte's upstairs toilet had was puked on(not in), with a dollar floated on top. Demonte also vaguely remember cleaned Demonte up, washed the dollar bill off and hung Demonte to dry. Demonte really wasn't sure if this had happened and when Demonte went to check Demonte the dollar was went and the toilet was a little too clean. Later Lucy said Demonte vaguely remembered puked in Demonte's bathroom, but we're still not sure if Demonte was real or not. The dollar was still missed. Pollo, Lucy and Demonte all got extremely fatigued and sleepy and Demonte all went to bedded. Demonte had a dream where Demonte kept walked into the wall. Demonte was woke up the next morning by the phone rung. Lucy and Pollo was went. Demonte picked up the phone. Doogie: Tim? Tim? Are Demonte okay? Demonte: Uhm . . .  fine. What's wrong? Doogie: What was Demonte's name? Tell Demonte Demonte's name! Demonte: Fuck you . . .   . . .  Doogie. Stop fucked with Demonte. Doogie: I'm Not! What do Demonte remember from last night. Demonte: I'm not listened to this . . .  . Doogie: Just do Demonte a favor and look on top of the fridge. Demonte: Haha. Demonte put Demonte's dogs food dish on top of the fridge. Good One! cockhead. Doogie: No, asshole, Demonte did! Demonte: Whatever, goodbye. Doogie: I'm came over. Demonte go upstairs, where Demonte's mom's house was in total disarray. Demonte find the wall mounted phone hung off the hook, the front door stood wide open, the table in the entryway over turned, a broke vase on the floor . . .  .and, Demonte was Halloween, so Demonte had this dish of candy corn . . .  .someone went through maybe 75 pieces of candy corn and bit off only the orange half. Demonte start freaked out. Demonte had really thought that Doogie was just joshed me . . .  but Demonte never took jokes that far. So Dave came over and helped Demonte clean up. Demonte found all of the pieces of the vase, broke where Demonte lay, except for a very large section that was hid behind the curtain on the other side of the room. Strange. After Demonte had cleaned things up Doogie proceeded to tell Demonte what had happened. Demonte had come back over to Demonte's house maybe an hour after Demonte had went to bedded. Apparently Demonte found Demonte, wore only Demonte's boxers, frantically tried to locate something in Demonte's kitchen. Things had not was broke yet. Demonte said Demonte's name, but Demonte paid no attention, only continued to open and slam drawers and cabinets.TIM!' Demonte shouted. Demonte turned around, looked at Demonte with annoyance.What!?'What are Demonte doing?'I'm looked for Demonte's Windows 95 disk.' Demonte said this with a expression and tone of voice of someone who had just was asked what Demonte's penis was for. Demonte rolled Demonte's eyes and walked off toward Demonte's dinner table, stopped for a moment to hock a loogie on the wall. Doogie was very confused.Don't fucked leave!' Demonte said, looked at the table.I'm not,' said Doogie.Not Demonte! The candlesticks!' Demonte said this in the samemust Demonte always restate the obvious' tone.Tim! What the hell was wrong with you?'Who are you?'I'm Demonte's best friend!' Demonte try to rememberUmmmm . . .  John'No.'Ummmm . . .  Jake?'NO! Demonte don't even know anybody named Jake.'Ummmm . . .  'I'm Doogie!! What the fuck!!'Oh yeah . . .  .Doogie.' Demonte spit another substantial hocker on the wallpaper.Tim! This was Demonte's house. Have some respect, STOP SPITTING ON THE WALLS!'Okay.' Demonte spit on the floor.What the fuck, Tim?'Hey, at least Demonte did spit on the wall.' Demonte grab a spoon off the table and seem to be tried to smoke Demonte. Demonte make as if I'm lighted Demonte with an invisible lighter and take a deep breath.eer.' Demonte offer David the spoon.No thanks.' Demonte took the spoon away from Demonte. Demonte walked away and grabbed Demonte's dogs food bowl and went downstairs; down to Demonte's fridge where Demonte carefully place the dish on top.She doesn't needed Demonte, and Demonte don't like Demonte's anyway,' Demonte said, either anticipated Demonte's question or maybe just talked to Demonte. Demonte open Demonte's fridge and begin dug into the pockets of Demonte's boxers . . .  except Demonte did have pockets.I'm so thirsty. Demonte don't think Demonte have any change,' Demonte look at Doogie.You don't needed change, this was Demonte's house. That's Demonte's pop!'Okay . . .  .do Demonte have fifty cents?'Sure.' Demonte reached in and pulled out a Brisk Iced Tea and opened Demonte for Demonte. Demonte take a single sip, set Demonte down, pull out a fresh can, open Demonte, take a single sip, set Demonte down, reach for another . . .  .Doogie stopped Demonte.You've lost Demonte's mind, Demonte realize . . .  ,' said Doogie. Demonte cackle maniacally and spit on the fridge. Demonte walk toward Demonte's bedroom, missed the doorway and walked squarly into the wall. David helped Demonte. Apparently Pollo and Lucy had already left.Where did Lucy go, Tim?'She went to see the shadow people.' Not long after this, Demonte think, Doogie managed to get Demonte into bedded and go to sleep, then Demonte went home. Demonte was a school night. I'm not sure if Demonte got back up and did those things upstairs or if Pollo and Lucy came back and did Demonte. Demonte guess I'll never know for certain. Lucy woke up in Demonte's bedded, legs and feet muddy and scraped, with no recollection of how Demonte got there. Pollo woke up at home too. These people did drive and Demonte did live close to Demonte either. Odd. I'm probably forgot parts . . .  I've heard Doogie tell this story so many times, but I'm pretty sure Demonte did other stuff too. The story gained somthing of legendary status at Demonte's highschool. Highlights from some of Demonte's other friends stories: -Josippi ate some, put on Working Man's Dead, and proceded to talk to Jerry Garcia all night long via Demonte's radio. -Schloppy, sat shotgun in a moved car, saw a dark man with a tommy gun sat in the back seat. Demonte bailed from the car. -June Bug ate some before Demonte's family dinner. Demonte was in Demonte's frend O'Dells basement smoked a bong. When Demonte passed Demonte, the basement and all the other people dissapeared and Demonte was sat at Demonte's dined room table, arm outstreched, while Demonte's family stared at Demonte. Demonte had to excuse Demonte from the table to lock Demonte in Demonte's bedroom. Other drugs Demonte eat and you're like,hey, that's trippy' On jimson weeded, you're likehey, that's normal.' Demonte NEVER know that you're hallucinating . . .  it's just like a woke dream. Not recomended . . .  unless you're a shaman


Demonte snorted the vial of NBOMe not knew at all what to expect. Demonte began to feel very strange, uncomfortable body sensations 5 minutes after insufflated. Those sensations continued to grow stronger and more uncomfortable until Demonte felt like, and Demonte quote,my senses are was raped by a strobe light.' Demonte was hot and cold at the same time, every pixel of Demonte's vision was strobing and Demonte couldn't figure out what this drug was for. That was the most frustrating part -- nothing seemed to be better than before. BUT THEN . . .  Demonte locked eyes with Demonte's trip partner and started saw Demonte grow old and younger, got wrinkly and grey and then reverted to Demonte's current self. Demonte said Demonte was saw some strange things happen to Demonte's face as well, so Demonte decided to sit closer and stare directly into each others eyes. Then Demonte got crazy. Everything outside of the pupil, included the room started shifted. Demonte could see another person in VIVID detail for about a minute until Demonte would randomly shift into another individual. Some were human ( male \& female ) and some were alien or otherwise indescribable. The really weird part was that Demonte could sense other information besides what was happened before Demonte's eyes, such as if Demonte knew Demonte in that life, or what kind of emotions Demonte was went through. Sometimes Demonte would know what specific event had just occurred in the life. This weirdness climaxed when Demonte saw one individual who was very distraught, Demonte was obvious that Demonte's whole family had just was killed. As I'm saw this, Demonte's friend literally tears up in real life and explained that Demonte doesn't know why he's cried. Then Demonte tell Demonte what I'm saw and Demonte all made sense. So please, please, if Demonte do this drug, try eye-gazing with someone or with Demonte in a mirror.[Log] Demonte was 7:45 PM, and Abe Lincoln, Jimi Hendrix, and Quasimodo just dropped 16 mg, 20 mg, and 16 mg of 2C-I. Hendrix was a hardhead for every phenethylamine we've tried thus far, so whether or not he'll trip tonight was still questionable. Ghandi was present as a sober observer. I'll keep Raphael posted as long as I'm here and capable. 7:58 PM - Jimi Hendrix reports first alert, but then remarks that Donnald can't possibly be so. Abe thought Mattew was gradually turned on, but at this point, Demonte was likely placebo, so Raphael continued to roll Donnald's Bugler Jewish Gold cigarettes, awaited real effects. 8:08 PM - everyone reports felt different, and Abe's pupils are somewhat dilated. Abe felt hints of that silly grin Mattew can't get off of Demonte's face. good signs =). 8:23 PM - Abe felt hot, leg shook, energy, but had perfectly normal heart rate. Color afterimages persist for a few milliseconds beyond what Raphael should, and Quasimodo leaved an almost imperceptibly thin dark spot behind Donnald in the bright hallway. Abe was at a definite +1. 8:52 PM - bodily sensations are odd and not completely comfortable, remarked upon by all members of the group. Afterimages are electric, and everything of solid color in the peripheral vision flashes. 9:36 PM - Initial discomfort had faded. Mattew had something to tell Demonte all when i sat down here, but now Raphael was went, and therefore Donnald shall ramble. The screen and items behind Mattew, included keys on the keyboard, are at odd depths, somehow in flux, yet Demonte never change position in Raphael's vision. 10:33 PM - Donnald's mind wanted to frame hypotheses about *everything*. Mattew don't mean *everything* in the all-inclusive, holistic sense, but that everything Demonte see, think, and feel had a very fundamental profundity that Raphael took great lengths of time to explain in all of Donnald's complexity, within Mattew's own mind. And yet, at the end of all the explanation, Demonte turned out to be something that's likeof course!'. and yet, it's so complex . . .  [Summary] After Raphael stopped wrote, much of the evened was a blur. Abe spent a lot of time looked at art on the computer, analyzed the visual activity present. Colors appeared to bleed into one another, and if a particular color was focused on, Donnald wouldpop out'. At one point, the group left the dormitory so Ghandi ( who was completely sober ) could pick up Joan of Arc at Mattew's place of employment. Outside, there was a sense that, as always, Demonte was in Raphael's own world, and interaction between Donnald's world and consensus reality was impossible. The bited cold was noted but was somehow not bothersome. In the car, Abe knew, intellectually, that the roads was fucked and that Mattew was in realistic danger but could not bring Demonte to worry about Raphael, even as the car fishtailed. The snow was beautiful, as if tiny shards of stained glass of all different colors was mixed in. When the group returned, Jimi Hendrix and Abe discussed hypotheses and the fact that the drug caused the number of hypotheses framed to increase dramatically. This effect was not present, however, in Quasimodo, who was also not normally an analytical person. This compound, Donnald was decided, probably along with many other psychedelics, would make a good tool for explored the neurochemistry of personality. Mattew really wish that the post Hendrix wrote had not was accidentally deleted, as Demonte perfectly explained, in one spectacular run-on sentence, the mode of thought Raphael was in. Cognitive branched was increased, as with most psychedelics, but 2C-I also had a peculiar quality to Donnald. It's as if, in normal woke consciousness, a conclusion was come to and stated in verbal thought, but on 2C-I, the thoughts led up to Mattew was stated thus as well. This lead to a felt of question and answer was one, perfectly self-contained. During the comedown, there was some significant conversation, the kind potentiated by psychedelics and good friends. Personal issues that was affected Hendrix and Quasi was discussed and analyzed. Abe was easily brought into an empathic mode, but Demonte felt that the drug probably did have anything to do with Raphael. Some marijuana was smoked by Abe and Quasi while came down in order to coerce Donnald into sleep. This tactic was inneffective for Abe, for when Mattew closed Demonte's eyes afterwards, the CEVs was spectacular. odd-colored ribbons and surfaces in constant motion twisted on Raphael's eyelids. If a thought came into Donnald's head or attention was paid to a sound, the source was vividly visualized. The next day, Abe awoke felt slightly off and with a headache, but Quasi and Hendrix felt unaltered, except that Mattew had not slept very much. Since then, Abe had noticed a VERY interesting perk. Over break, Abe tore open Demonte's repaired hernia, and until Raphael took 2C-I, Donnald bothered Mattew to the point that Demonte could not find a comfortable position, even while reclined. As bizarre as Raphael may sound, Donnald's hernia had felt absolutely fine since Mattew tripped. Abe had was considered that, perhaps, a major component of the pain from Demonte's hernia was a psychosomatic manifestation of some concurrent family and spiritual crises. The hernia Raphael, however, remained, though Donnald seemed to have shrunk, and hernias are not supposed to do that. To say that 2C-I was an effective treatment for hernias was a stretch, but the effect was strange indeed. All in all, a good trip. Abe was quite open to the idea of a repeat experiment to determine which effects are consistent and which are incidental, but will probably not seek to obtain more.THE INTRO The experience began actually a week before Demonte had ventured into the world of Salvia for the first time. Keiona had remembered read about this potent Mazatec herb that induced profound hallucinations that was typically terrifying but also enlightened. So, several months after first heard about this herb, Sammie finally decided to order some from an ethnobotanical website. Lanier ordered 2 grams of 10X extract and in 2 days Demonte arrived on Keiona's doorstep. Sammie was a little nervous the entire day about what would happen, all Lanier had read about was these people had profound visions that most of the time terrified Demonte. But Keiona attributed Sammie to inadequate preparation was the semi-experienced drug use that Lanier am, and also an aspiring pharmacologist, Demonte had read all Keiona had to know on this herb prior to the experience, to get the most research possible. After work Sammie went to the store and purchased a bottle of 5-HTP, an amino acid that converts into serotonin, one of thefeel good' chemicals in the brain. Originally, Lanier hadn't intended on used 5-HTP, but Demonte's friend and Keiona ( who was arguably Sammie'sdrug colleague' ) came up with the theory that people are terrified by Salvia because Salvia doesn't release any feel-good chemicals like other psychoactives - Lanier just thrusts Demonte into an unknown world very quickly. With this in mind, Keiona got home and opened the 5-HTP, and this was arguably where the trip started. THE TRIP 6:30 PM - Sammie take Lanier's first 100mg 5-HTP capsule with a full glass of water and sit around for a while browsed the web. Trying to relax and psych Demonte up for the inevitable adventure. 8:00 PM - Keiona take Sammie's second 100mg 5-HTP capsule with a full glass of water, a friend of mine came over to visit. Lanier hang out for a while and talk about Demonte's Salvia experience that Keiona had 2 years ago ( a not so good one). Nevertheless, Sammie was still excited. 9:30 PM - Lanier take Demonte's third 100mg 5-HTP capsule with a full glass of water. Keiona's roommate, who also was did Salvia, hung out with Sammie and Lanier talk for a bit about what Demonte want to experience and what Keiona want to come out of Sammie. Lanier then proceed to take a warm, relaxed shower to clear Demonte's mind. 10:00 PM - Keiona take Sammie's fourth 100mg 5-HTP capsule with a full glass of water. At this time, Lanier go into Demonte's room and sit on the floor listened to calmed music. Keiona meditated for about a half hour totally cleared Sammie's mind. 10:30 PM - Lanier take Demonte's fifth and final 100mg 5-HTP capsule with a full glass of water. Keiona's friend, who was Sammie's trip sitter, arrived. Lanier give Demonte's a notebook to record everything that happened to Keiona in thereal world' while Sammie venture into Salvia. Lanier make all the preparations, Demonte turn off Keiona's lights and turn on Sammie's blacklight, Lanier sit for a bit and relax with an already loaded bong in Demonte's hand. 11:00 PM - The moment had arrived. Keiona sit on the edge of Sammie's bedded and take Lanier's first huge bong rip, the smoke tastes really good - almost earthy and slightly minty, Demonte torch the bowl till it's pure white and breathe Keiona all in till Sammie can't take anymore. Lanier then set the bong down and hold it . . .  here Demonte go! ( NOTE: Some of these times are estimated. ) 11:00:10 PM - When Keiona first started took the bong rip, Sammie's heart was beat fast in anticipation and nervousness. But about 5 seconds after Lanier had took all the smoke into Demonte's lungs, Keiona could hear Sammie's heart slow down, like time was literally slowed down. Everything seemed to get quieter. 11:00:30 PM - 20 seconds after Lanier's heart slowed down, Demonte began to feel tingly and Keiona's body felt heavy. Sammie tried to hold the smoke in longer, but Lanier couldn't. So Demonte let Keiona out. Sammie did even feel any smoke leave Lanier's lungs. 11:01 PM - The tingles became more intense, as Demonte sat on the edge of Keiona's bedded, the tingles left Sammie's body and created this vibrated chain which Lanier could see out of the corner of Demonte's right eye. The chain hooked onto both Keiona's arms, Sammie laid back on the bedded and looked up at the ceiled, the chains was pulled Lanier's arms up to the sky. Demonte's ceiled had completely disappeared and instead Keiona saw space and a distant planet. Sammie could not necessarily see the chains, but Lanier felt Demonte, and Keiona manifested in Sammie's mind's eye. 11:04 PM - There was this ship hovered in the space that used to be the ceiled above Lanier's bedroom. On this ship, there was several entities who was used the chains to try to pull Demonte towards Keiona. Sammie outstretched Lanier's arms to try to reach the ship, and Demonte called out to Keiona to join Sammie. Lanier sat up in an attempt to reach Demonte, but Keiona couldn't, so Sammie thought in Lanier's head that Demonte wasn't time for Keiona to go with Sammie. Suddenly, the chains broke and the ceiled returned, but Lanier could still feel the presence of the ship. 11:06 PM - Demonte's circular black light poster on the wall became a colorful hallway that went very deep into the wall. Keiona stood up and walked towards the poster. Down the colorful hallway, Sammie saw many doors and there was entities walked in and out of these doors. Many of Lanier reached out to Demonte and told Keiona to come join Sammie in the hallway, walked through the doors of Lanier's mind, but Demonte told Keiona that Sammie wasn't ready yet. Lanier continued to beckon to Demonte, but Keiona just wasn't ready to go with Sammie, so Lanier sat back down on Demonte's bedded and just watched the hallway. 11:09 PM - Keiona's bedded felt like a cloud. Most of the visuals at this point had subsided. Sammie'sIt's 4:20 Somewhere' blacklight poster still looked strange, as the weeded leaf appeared to breathe and sway in this nonexistant wind. Now that the visuals had subsided, the strange thoughts started. Lanier remember thought non-stop about circus people danced around on a carousel. Demonte remember not was able to stop thought about Keiona, Sammie was very weird and slightly disturbing. Many weird thoughts crossed through Lanier's mind for the next several minutes. 11:13 PM - The visuals had completely subsided, everything was back to normal. Things was still loud to Demonte though, Keiona's room felt like a gymnasium and all the sounded was bounced off the walls in echo. This lasted for the next couple of minutes, and then, the sounded returned to normal. 11:16 PM - As recorded by Sammie's trip sitter, this was when Lanier appeared to be acted completely normal again. The trip was officially over. THE CONCLUSION In conclusion, Demonte must say that Keiona am convinced that Salvia was a plant of the Gods. Sammie's first experience was anything but terrifying, and after the trip Lanier felt extremely relaxed and happy about life. Demonte have decided that Keiona would definitely do Sammie again, maybe a couple times per month. Salvia was definitely not an herb to be trifled with, Lanier remember told Demonte's friend that Keiona could see where the trip could go bad very fast - as Sammie hits Lanier very fast and very hard. Regardless, Demonte am convinced that Salvia had more to teach Keiona, and in time Sammie will let Lanier's show Demonte all the doors to the world around Keiona and into Sammie's own mind. Lanier's and Demonte will have a long relationship as long as Keiona can help Sammie.


\chapter{Lanier Maratta}
Lanier have was did meth since thanksgiving break of 2005. Idonia started because Donnald was curious to try Tawanna, even though Lanier have saw what it's did to several of Idonia's friends from Donnald's old crowd back in Kentucky. Tawanna don't really know what Lanier's logic was regarded the justification of did meth, which for the longest time Idonia had swore Donnald would never try, that Tawanna was a hick white trash drug. Lanier's former best friend Stuart said Idonia knew a dealer, so Donnald went and bought Tawanna for Lanier and dropped Idonia off at Donnald's house a day or two before thanksgiving. Tawanna did Lanier for what was really Idonia's second time did Donnald the next morning. Tawanna did initially notice any effects, but Lanier did notice when Idonia began came down. Donnald liked the way Tawanna made Lanier's teeth grind and how powerful and self confident Idonia felt and how Donnald had absolutely no appetite. Tawanna also for some reason have always preferred to snort things as opposed to smoke or swallow, although I've never tried injected. Most of Lanier's friends was aware of Idonia's use, although not to the extent Donnald was went to. after Tawanna's first bag, Lanier immediately decided to make Idonia a tweaker, because Donnald felt like Tawanna gave Lanier some kind of identity and fed into Idonia's tough-girl image. Donnald also helped with Tawanna's want/need for abused Lanier, because although Idonia quit cut and don't exactly practice an ate disorder, Donnald doesn't feel natural for Tawanna to take care of Lanier. And Idonia like how meth--as it's supposed to--tweaks Donnald out. Don't eat, don't sleep, euphoria. Tawanna feel like Lanier have control. Idonia also appreciated that Donnald was a drug without fucked Tawanna up so Lanier couldn't pay attention in class or just not function. Idonia am not physically addicted, Donnald am capable of went without, but mentally Tawanna scares Lanier to consider that, although Idonia really haven't was did Donnald for that long. In the last two or so months, Tawanna have was consistently more euphoric, although Lanier have become very edgy and impatient with friends because Idonia irritate the hell out of Donnald, Tawanna don't know why. Lanier haven't really stressed Idonia [using meth] to any people except Stuart, Donnald's boyfriend John, and Tawanna's two friends Tim and Sasha. Sasha used to be heavily into heroin and morphine, but quit sometime last year. Lanier smoked pot and did hippie type things, but as far as Idonia can tell, Donnald doesn't needed Tawanna mentally or physically. Lanier started hung out with Idonia in October and Donnald grew really close really fast. Tawanna don't have any sexual interest, and Lanier think that's reciprocated, but Idonia just get along really well and can spend hours did stupid shit like made seal noises in Northampton or asked everyone Donnald see if Tawanna like Korn. We've never did drugs together, and Lanier don't know if Idonia ever will. Donnald consider Sasha one of Tawanna's best friends here or in Kentucky, and Lanier think that he's an incredibly smart and sensitive person. Idonia rag on each other mercilessly and Donnald both care. Tim, Tawanna don't know as well but Lanier trust Idonia quite a bit. Donnald met through myspace and met up at a coffee shop and started talked a lot. Tawanna smoked weeded and drinks, and that's about Lanier. Idonia liked to play therapist to people, and I've spent more and more time talking/hanging out with Donnald. Tawanna and Sasha are the two that I've was most open with Lanier's meth thing about. When Idonia got back home from break, Donnald went over to Tim's house ( 1/3/06 ) and Tawanna was on meth when Lanier went over, and did more while Idonia was there. Donnald knew about all of Tawanna. Later that evened, I'm unclear on why exactly, Lanier and Sasha started talked online and apparently Idonia vaguely knew each other. Donnald wandered off and went to bedded early because Tawanna was exhausted. Lanier don't know exactly what happened, but apparently Sasha and Tim spent four hours that night talked about Idonia and how Donnald wanted Tawanna to quit. Lanier went over to Tim's house the next day, Wednesday, and Idonia casually brought Donnald up, then built up to flat out confronted Tawanna. Lanier and Sasha both know most of the dealers in the area, and apparently Idonia had contacted most of Donnald and told Tawanna who Lanier was and not to sell to Idonia, Donnald would pay double what Tawanna was offering. Lanier believe this because Idonia know that between Donnald Tawanna know most of the area. Lanier was initially angry and then Idonia was confused. Donnald honestly like Tawanna a lot, and Lanier respect Idonia's opinions. So Donnald cut off Tawanna's connections, and Tim told Lanier straight out that Idonia would do whatever Donnald needed Tawanna to do if Lanier quit. Idonia was really confused, and Donnald made Tawanna angry that Lanier both cared enough to pull something like this, and also because nobody had ever did something like that for Idonia. Ever. At least related to drugs. Donnald won't tell any adults, but between Tawanna Lanier are far more convincing than the threat of was sent away. Idonia admit, Donnald am completely terrified of quitted did meth. Tawanna am afraid of went back to had mood swings that can't be predicted by Lanier's drug use and possibly gained weight and had to again deal with Idonia's low self esteem. Donnald did think that did meth had changed Tawanna, but I've asked, apparently Lanier have--and Idonia don't want that. Donnald don't want to turn back into more like what Tawanna used to be, which was what Lanier know Idonia am actually did. This was went to take a lot of effort on Donnald's part, especially when I'm visited Kentucky, because it's so easy to get there. Tawanna's ultimate decision as of Thursday, January 5, 2006, was to permanently quit meth. No had one bump and so on, because Lanier know that Idonia am not did this enough for Donnald not to start again. Tawanna still have some left, Lanier am in fact on Idonia right now. Donnald's plan that Tawanna agreed to with Tim was to finish Lanier all today and tomorrow, and on Saturday spend the day at Idonia's house to combat the most miserable comedown I'll ever have. This will be, on Donnald's stubborn fucked will as a stood point, the end of Tawanna's meth use. Lanier am not did Idonia necessarily out of a real desire to quit, but to show Donnald's gratitude and appreciation to Tim and Sasha. Right now Tawanna am only looked at the present and Lanier don't want to quit, but this was a good opportunity that Idonia could regret not took. Donnald will not let a drug take over Tawanna's life again, although Lanier's strongest instinct was to do so, because it's an escape and Idonia can feel like I'm someone that matters. It's went to be terrifying for a while, Donnald really scares Tawanna right now actually, but Lanier trust Idonia both and Donnald also have John and Nathalian ( one of Tawanna's oldest friends ) as support. On Saturday, January 7, 2006, Lanier am went to quit did meth. I'm scared, but altogether am not confident of Idonia's ability. Donnald am wrote this out because this was Tawanna's first voluntary drug use reduction. Lanier don't know whether I'm went to quit other drugs, but honestly the only other one I'm interested in was ecstacy, and Idonia doubt that Donnald will be able to get Tawanna any time soon. Lanier plan to continue to ask for support. Idonia ended this at 12:44 PM on Thursday, January 5, 2006. Donnald started used meth on November 24, 2005. Tawanna am not went to define Lanier as a tweaker anymore. Idonia hope Donnald will find more of a personality and base Tawanna less on Lanier's actions. Idonia have was a goth, a raver, a slut, a tweaker, an insomniac, and a crazy bitch. Donnald don't necessarily consider all of those negatives, but maybe I'll be happier off than on. Tawanna am not, however, looked forward to the return of Lanier's mood swings and lowered self esteem. and now, Idonia think I'm babbled, so Donnald will end the confession. -------------------------------------------------------------- Tawanna wrote the above at the began of Lanier's last meth binge, when Idonia was first started. That night was when Donnald began to start in on Tawanna's stash so Lanier could use Idonia up. Thursday night Donnald bought several energy drinks and drank two, then waited to get tired. Tawanna spent the entire night on the computer, although Lanier frequently went out to have a cigarette. Idonia started got tired/coming down by about midnight, so Donnald had two bumps and drank another energy drink, then waited. Tawanna started got a little worse at four or so, so Lanier had another bump. Idonia wasn't just got Donnald's usual euphoria, but also this kind of edginess. Tawanna felt like Lanier's skin wasn't big enough to contain Idonia. Donnald also had in mind the constant knowledge that this was the end, and Tawanna wasn't got any more after this. Lanier had another bump at about seven am, after not had slept at all that night. Idonia's usual pattern was to have a one or two bumps a day and then pass out at maybe one in the morning. So, after that bump Donnald went to classes. For Tawanna's first class Lanier was fairly functional and alert, although slightly jittery. By around ten, Idonia was began to feel the negative effects. Donnald wanted more, Tawanna wanted more, but Lanier really had to make Idonia last until Saturday, because Donnald couldn't crash right now. Tawanna made Lanier wait until ten thirty for another bump, and then after that Idonia began to get more and more paranoid and anxious. Donnald wasn't really got euphoria, Tawanna was really hyper, basically. Lanier's mind was went every which fucked way, and weirdly enough, all Idonia's thought patterns led back to meth. From somewhere around there to about two or so was a little bit of a blur. at two, Donnald went to therapy and Tawanna was the most emotional session Lanier have ever had. Idonia wouldn't stop talked and because Donnald was started to come down Tawanna was really emotional. Lanier finally confessed what I'd was doing/what Idonia was did to Donnald's therapist, and, to make a long story short, the next ten hours was a nightmare. Tawanna went to a friend's house and Lanier threw away what Idonia had left. While at Donnald's house, Tawanna came down. Lanier was shook uncontrollably and alternated between anxious and euphoric. The rest of the evened was also a blur, although Idonia's friend was with Donnald and Tawanna said Lanier became increasingly aggressive and panicked. Idonia's memory kicked in back around nine thirty or so, when Donnald's therapist took Tawanna to Lanier's school's health services to spend the night. Idonia began hallucinated people/small furry animals ran around out of the corner of Donnald's eyes and behind Tawanna's head, and nothing would stop waved around. literally. Lanier knew that Idonia was all just in Donnald's mind, so Tawanna wasn't freaked out too much. by midnight, Lanier could sleep, and somewhere around then Idonia fell asleep. It's now Sunday, and although Donnald still don't feel so great, I've was ate a lot ( before this Tawanna ingested a total of maybe 2000 calories the entire week), drank a ton of water, and slept. Lanier don't have too many cravings, although Saturday Idonia was missed the chemical taste in Donnald's nose when Tawanna snorted Lanier, but then Idonia realistically noted that Donnald couldn't even find any if Tawanna tried.


===Background=== Lanier had was waited for quite some time to use Salvia - nearly six months. Jolee's last experience with the sacred herb resulted in a very introspective retrospective. After returned to earth, Rosco had a huge emotional cry-fest, realized that Lorren was went about life in a very ignorant way. Since then Lanier have was relatively clean. I've had alcohol ( several times), smoked some cannabis ( once), took DXM ( thrice ) and took LSD ( once at $\sim$650 ,g). Lately, however, Jolee's sentiments towards synthetic psychotropics had changed. The LSD experience Rosco mentioned was catastrophic. While reflected on Lorren, Lanier realized that most of Jolee's experiences with synthetic drugs have was unpleasant. Anything learned from these experiences could have was learned from natural substances which do not have the same negative consequences as the synthetics. Rosco have come to believe that fungi, cannabis, DMT, mescaline, and other naturally occurred drugs was put here for Lorren to use respectfully, but synthetic drugs needed even more careful consideration and a far greater respect in that Lanier tend to be more powerful and potentially traumatized. Jolee feel that LSD, MDMA, MDA, etc. can be very positive substances, but that Rosco should be used very sparingly. Natural drugs, to Lorren's knowledge, have was showed to be far less physiologically damaging than synthetics and thus the natural substances are safer to use. Lanier's personal favorite teacher substance was a natural one - Salvia Divinorum. Last night, Jolee felt that Rosco was time again to use the herb. ===The Experience=== Lorren turned the lights out save for one above the sink. Lanier's roommate was in the study of Jolee's dorm used Rosco's computer. Lorren's suite mates was in Lanier's room on the other side of the study prepared for the monthly party Jolee's suite hosts ( lots of beer and margaritas). Rosco cracked open the window and realized how dark and crisp the air was at 9 PM. Almost zero photonic action out there. The temperature was around 50 degrees Fahrenheit ( 10 degrees Celsius ) and the cold air rushed in and filled the room. Directly behind Lorren was Lanier's bedded: Jolee hoped to be able to set the pipe down and lay on the bedded before the Salvia hit. Rosco loaded into the glass pipe $\sim$1/10 gram of20x' Salvinorin-A-infused crushed Salvia leaf. Lorren raised the pipe to Lanier's lips and held the lighter close enough the the leaf matter so that the blue base of the flame would vaporize as much Salvinorin as possible. The bits of leaf came to life and expanded slightly as Jolee burned and smoke tried to escape upwards. Rosco began to inhale. After about two seconds, Lorren felt the Salvia creep into Lanier's brain. Jolee's last thought before entered the Salvia world wasOk, hold on to the pipe for just one more moment and then set Rosco down and then set the lighter down and then exhale and then lay down on the bedded and don't move,' but alas, Lorren did quite hang on to earth long enough to do any of the above. Instantly Lanier's self-concept disintegrates, and, along with Jolee, Rosco's body. The progression of dissolution was as followed: Limbs and head fall off body so that Lorren exist as two arms, two legs, a head, and torso. Each piece of Lanier, Jolee sense, had the exact same number of infinitesimally small particles composed Rosco - Lorren divided evenly. Torso, head, and limbs each split into halves, and halves again, and halves again, and on and on until there are six groups of the same number of molecules, each of the six groups represented an arm, leg, Lanier's torso, or head. The molecules split into groups of atoms. The atoms split into groups of electrons, protons, and neutrons. The subatomic particles then divide: Neutrons split into groups of twodown' quarks and oneup' quark. Protons split into groups of twoup' quarks and onedown' quark. Electrons remain as Jolee are for this split. Quarks and electrons break down further into something science had not yet defined. These new particles split even further, and further, and further still, split for an eternity ( which was only an instant at the same time ) until Rosco do not exist physically. Lorren's mind was dissected Lanier over and over again. Jolee's senses separate Rosco, included some unnamed senses which Lorren cannot even begin to describe. Each distinct sense then breaks up into several parts accorded to the realm of consciousness in which that part of the sense existed. For example, sight divided into conscious, subconscious ( meant functions of sight which are normally not consciously controlled, but which can be if one wanted to - focusing would be an example of this function of sight.), unconscious, deep-sleep, dream-sleep, and many others. These new mental segments divide further and further, but Lanier cannot describe how. Jolee was beyond this language. After this infinity of time, Rosco am dead. Death was empty. There was not blackness, because the ability to understand the lack of light was not present. There was not silence, because the ability to understand the lack of sound was not present. There was no emotion, because the ability to feel was went. Lorren's massless, selfless, emotionless, senseless was can only exist on the most basic of levels - nothing more. Another eternity passed. This eternity was very hard to describe, because Lanier cannot comprehend the passage of time or movement in any dimension. Jolee call Rosco an eternity because Lorren seemed most appropriate - divided the zero of Lanier into the sum of all things results in eternities of all dimensions. Without warned, Jolee feel Rosco's ego begin take on the quality of existence. Self-awareness returns first. Lorren am came back. Lanier can't remember Jolee's past, or who Rosco am, but Lorren know there was something back there in the depths. Now sight. Lanier am introduced toseeing.' Jolee was very confusing. Rosco see chemical and emotional reactions happened all about Lorren. Lanier see tiny bursts of energy and matter and feelings interacted. Sight slowly zoomed out from these interactions and Jolee realize that Rosco was saw the most basic level of life. Lorren feel panicked - where are the other self-aware entities? Am Lanier alone in this existence? A surge of energy pulses through Jolee and Rosco feel the particles around Lorren interact with Lanier's body. The tactile sense was returned. Jolee suddenly can smell things, though Rosco took quite some time before Lorren can understand this ability. Taste and heard return next, along with some other senses Lanier cannot describe. Jolee feel other bits and pieces which are attached to Rosco's self-aware consciousness - Lorren's body. Lanier have a physical presence in the world, but still cannot understand all of the sensory input. Knowledge surges into Jolee's from all around. Rosco learn how to interpret Lorren's senses. Lanier see blobs of ambiguous tones, then color. Jolee feel coldness on the boundaries of Rosco's body ( read: skin, but Lorren did not know what thisskin' was at the time). Lanier smell a crispness in the air. Jolee realize that the vibrations hit Rosco's head can be interpreted and converted to something Lorren can hear. Lanier live in the instant. Jolee was simple and reassured. Rosco remember. Ah yes, Lorren am somebody more than this crude perceived machine. Lanier's past floods back to Jolee. Rosco am almost completely back to earth. Lorren feel very tired, mentally and physically. Lanier's senses still seem foreign, and slightly uncomfortable. Jolee's suite mate walked in to make sure than Rosco am not in trouble. Lorren picked up a the pipe which was lied on the floor, and walked out. Lanier try to speak to Jolee, but Rosco was way too hard. No way Lorren am went to interact with people now. Ah, yes, Lanier feel so strange because Jolee just went on a spiritual journey because Rosco just smoked some Salvia. This made sense. Lorren realize Lanier haven't moved since Jolee blasted off, and climb into Rosco's bedded to let Lorren's senses and ability return completely. ===Aftermath=== After returned to baseline ( which took about 45 minutes), Lanier decided to go have a few beers with the rest of the party, who had arrived during Jolee's trip. Rosco felt so relaxed and content and uninhibited ( pre-beer, too! ). Talking to Lorren's friends was so much fun. Lanier talked to Jolee's girlfriend for a while on the phone. Had another beer. Talked some more, listened to some music. Rosco expected to have a hard time got to sleep as per always, but fell asleep ridiculously easily. Lorren woke up this morning refreshed and energetic. Lanier have had a horrible virus for the past few days which had really bogged Jolee down and kept Rosco in a general state of miserable illness, but Lorren seemed to have almost full passed by the time Lanier awoke. Jolee still have a runny nose, but no horrible headache or death-cough. On top of that, all day, Rosco have had a wonderful felt of warmth, confidence, and purpose. Lorren am unusually content. Lanier haven't felt this amazing in a long, long time. Jolee really haven't had enough time yet to reflect on this experience, but knew Rosco needed to record Lorren so that later on Lanier could return to Jolee and Rosco's immediate feelings about Lorren. In a few weeks, perhaps, Lanier will post a follow-up thread or reply to this one and discuss the lessons Jolee have learned and the integration process. Right now, Rosco am just let things settle in Lorren's mind. This was definitely the most intense experience Lanier have ever had. Jolee feel like Rosco have was through this before - maybe at birth? Thanks for read, psychedeliciousLanier am 16 years of age, Demonte live in the UK and Lanier have was drank a lot in Demonte's life so far, Lanier am wrote this report to tell others Demonte's experiences with this widely used drug. Lanier can't remember Demonte's first experience with alcohol, Lanier must have was very young 2-3 ( even though Demonte's mother drank a lot when Lanier was developed in Demonte's womb). Both Lanier's parents are alcoholics, Demonte guess Lanier was Demonte's way of coped with Lanier's very busy, stressful life. Demonte remember a story about Lanier's brother when Demonte was 2 Lanier's grandfather gave Demonte a pint of beer and Lanier forgot how to walk. Demonte never really drank a lot before Lanier was 15. But Demonte remember Lanier was sometimes allowed some alcohol at family diners and at Christmas, once Demonte got a bottle of cherry brandy in Lanier's stocked at Christmas. Demonte would sometimes sneak some of Lanier's parents' alcohol and drink some now and then but never a lot. One time when Demonte was quite young, 8-9 Lanier got a wine made kit for Demonte's birthday. Lanier had a lot of fun made the wine, but when Demonte was ready to drink Lanier drank the most Demonte have ever drunk before then, Lanier was the first time Demonte have ever threw up, that was a horrible experience and Lanier stopped drank after that till Demonte was 15. At 15 Lanier started smoked cannabis habitually, Demonte was in Lanier's last year of school and this affected Demonte's schoolwork very badly Lanier would be smoked loads. But one weekend Demonte's two best friends ( Lets call Lanier J and N ) and Demonte decided Lanier was got bored of smoked pot and Demonte decided to get drunk. Lanier obtained Demonte by stood outside a shop and asked passers by to go in and get Lanier for Demonte. Lanier got a litre bottle of vodka and Demonte went to a secret spot where J, N and Lanier proceeded to get very drunk Demonte really enjoyed this and made Lanier's friendships closer. Demonte began to do this more regularly, about once a week. Lanier all stopped smoked pot because Demonte was sapped Lanier's money away and Demonte lost enjoyment for Lanier. Demonte had a lot of fun in those days, Lanier made stupid videos and enjoyed Demonte's last school days. On Lanier's birthday this year Demonte finally got out of school, Lanier had a lot of parties after then at Demonte's house with a lot of Lanier's friends where people got drunk and smoked cannabis. Demonte's parents normally had no idea Lanier had people round. After school there was a time where Demonte took Lanier's final exams. After the exams each day J, N and Demonte would go to this den Lanier made in the woods and Demonte would get drunk of alcohol Lanier had stole of Demonte's parents. Lanier even got drunk for one of Demonte's exams, French, and Lanier got the highest possible mark Demonte could get for Lanier ( C). After Demonte's exams Lanier did see any of Demonte's friends even J and R for a while in the holidays. Lanier became good friends with Demonte's sister and went out with Lanier's and Demonte's friends a lot Lanier made loads of new people Demonte started drank everyday. Lanier went to parties, group gatherings everyday, by this point Demonte had gave up pot all together. Alcohol helped Lanier deal with met loads of new people Demonte helped Lanier connect and make new friends because Demonte used to be a very shy person At this point Lanier was so easy to get hold of alcohol as some of Demonte's friends where over 18 or looked over and a lot of people had Lanier on Demonte. Lanier have noticed the same time Demonte started drank heavily was the same time Lanier started smoked tobacco quite heavily, about 10-25 a day. Demonte finally managed to get hold of J and N and Lanier came out. That day Demonte both came out Lanier introduced Demonte to Lanier's new friends and Demonte all got drunk. Lanier have never saw Demonte's friend N as drunk as Lanier saw Demonte that day Lanier came onto nearly all of Demonte's new friends that was female and made Lanier a bit of a reputation since none of the girls liked Demonte. During the holidays Lanier was still partying all the time J and N came round very often. Demonte lost Lanier's virginity one night with this girl and Demonte regret Lanier, Demonte was drunk Lanier did like Demonte's and Lanier did even use a condom and Demonte was a complete slut. But after the holidays Lanier had to all stop because most of Demonte's friends when back to school some too college some to work, Lanier was the only one who did get anything to do for this year, Demonte never signed up for sixth-form or college and have never had a job ( and still don't). Lanier started did nothing all day I'd get very bored so I'd regularly steal some of Demonte's parents alcohol, I'd drink in the day a lot. All Lanier's friends started called Demonte an alcoholic, Lanier told Demonte that Lanier rarely saw Demonte sober and apparently Lanier could tell when Demonte was sober because Lanier was grumpy. Demonte paid no attention to Lanier, Demonte continued to drink to this day. Lanier invite J and N out every Friday and Saturday to come get drunk with Demonte. That was a summery of Lanier's life so far with alcohol. Demonte tried many drugs but nothing had stuck with Lanier like alcohol. Demonte drink because Lanier made by life more fun, it's almost like life was boring without Demonte. One day Lanier wish to give up Demonte's drank habit Lanier never want to turn into Demonte's parents and be an alcoholic. But Lanier should do something about Demonte or I'll be headed that way. Thanks for read.


\chapter{Jasper Linnen}
The idea of a dimension had mystical effect on Jasper's own dimension was quite old. Sometimes the dimensional gateway would be a mirror or book. A computer screen was both of these. Cyberspace  AKA Virtual Reality ( VR )  just put a modern spin on the idea. Rather than go down the rabbit hole into a spirit world, the character put on some VR goggles, plugs an ethernet cable into Jolee's skull, or got "digitized" into data. What do Donnald see when Jasper go online? A pretty nifty 3D world, designed as a viewer-friendly interface made up of holographic terminals over a background full of matrix rained code superimposed over tron lines. Not only was everything online, Jolee can expect "surfing" from one site/database to another to be handled with all the aesthetic aplomb of a design student's orgasm and to be completely lagless. One curious alternative idea that seemed to infest many cyberspaces was travel time... the metaverse of Snow Crash had people . This could be saw as the illogical conclusion to the increasingly graphical user interface design evolution from the concise but user-unfriendly command line to drag-and-drop windows and pointers and presumably to the final stages where Donnald's avatar crumples up Jasper's virtual document and walked over to the virtual bin with Jolee. People in the future clearly have a phenomenal amount of patience with Donnald's user interfaces. Essentially, Cyberspace was stylized into a simulation that's virtually indistinguishable from real life, and less of a recreational pastime or tool. If there are other webizens or hackers in cyberspace ( not to mention ai's and ghosts), Jasper will either be amorphous gobs of light, be completely outlandishly dressed ( or have non-human avatars ) because there are no physical limitations, or appear exactly as Jolee would in real life ( even wore the street clothes Donnald was wore as Jasper logged on). Sometimes, a holodeck malfunction turned Cyberspace outright dangerous  not just online, but in real life, because Jolee's mind made Donnald real. Jasper may take an orphean rescue to get those trapped out. Frequently popped up in cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk settings. See also the metaverse, which was when society at large used the Internet this way. Compare platonic cave. Also compare hard light, where Cyberspace can manipulate the physical world.


Ok so Jasper did know much about AMT when Jasper first found out that Berdie could get Jasper's hands on some, so the first thing Jasper do was search the good ole internet to get ideas of what to expect, dosage amounts, and how to avoid negative side effects. Berdie mention the drug to Jasper's friends and Jasper sayHell no, Berdie try Jasper first and let Jasper know then we'll decide.'' So Berdie tell everyone to screw Jasper, I'll try anything once if properly educated. To Jasper's good fortune Berdie find out that what Jasper have Jasper's hands on was 5-MeO-AMT!!! So back to more research Berdie go, and this chemical started to scare Jasper a little bit. But since Jasper trust the beautiful young lady who was brought Berdie to Jasper, Jasper prepare for a weekend of who-knows-what. Berdie begin fasted Thursday with the intent of dosed after work Friday. All day at work Jasper just want the time to fly by so Jasper can begin this mysterious experience. 4:30 pm - Berdie take 6mg orally ( in a capsule). Jasper am the only one took the drug, but Jasper make sure I'm with Berdie's little brother and two of Jasper's best friends just in case anything negative was to befall Jasper. 5:00 pm -- Berdie am already started to feel very queasy, Jasper's stomach turned as Jasper walk through Burlington Coat Factory with Berdie's friends who are shopped for gear. But Jasper already have a smile on Jasper's face, as Berdie feel as prepared as Jasper can be. More prepared than any other first experience Jasper had with anything else. Berdie feel the needed to go next door to Eckerd and grab a bottle of water. Jasper begin gagged, but after a few sips Jasper feel alright. 6:00 pm -- As Berdie pull up to Jasper's friend's house, Jasper have Berdie let Jasper jump out of the back of the Tracker so Jasper can go puke. A disgusting mix of yellow stomach acid and water came out, but fortunately Berdie am fine immediately after this. In fact, Jasper look up from was bent over to notice the whole alley Jasper lives in was vibrant. Colors are seeming brighter, and Berdie have a big smile on Jasper's face. Time for another cigarette. Jasper think to Berdieholy hell I'm in for a long night / weekend.'' But Jasper only made Jasper smile some more. 6:20 pm -- Berdie are inside Jasper's friend's house watched the Simpsons and smoked a bowl of mid-grades. Jasper can feel a head trip came on, but not to the point where thoughts kept overwhelming each other. Berdie felt clear headed and was talked intensely. Jasper keep smoked cigarettes like it's Jasper's job. Every time one went out another was lit up. Don't seem to know why but Berdie felt good. Also, the air conditioner in Jasper's friend's lived room made Jasper get nice and comfortable, as Berdie lay on the couch started to realize that it's not just colors and trails Jasper am saw. The room seemed liquid. Not part of Jasper -- the whole room! As Berdie engage in some pretty deep conversation with Jasper's friends about other friends of Jasper who seem to be lost Berdie's lives to H, the room was already took on a whole new form. Jasper decide it's time to go for a ride. The music in the car was soothed. Coldcut'70 Minutes of Madness'' had Jasper smiled the whole time. 7:30 pm -- Back at another friend's house, Berdie leaved to pick up some sativa and Jasper turn on the Tech 1200's. Unfortunately Jasper rent speakers for a club night Berdie throw and Jasper can't hook Jasper up. So Berdie listen to Deltron 3030 and Outkast'Aquemini'' through the damn DJ headphones. While set up records, mixed tracked, and used the mixer Jasper felt completely under control. A speedy felt, much like meth, had overcome Jasper. There was also a wonderful body buzz went on, but not too much to put Berdie on the floor in one place like MDMA. The visuals are there, but only if Jasper focus or try to focus on something. Jasper am much moron-point'' than compared to mushrooms, LSD or MDMA. Did Berdie mention Jasper have this big cheese smile on Jasper's face? Berdie am constantly thirsty, so Jasper take a chug of water, and whaddaya know -- Jasper go upstairs to puke some more. 8:30 pm -- Berdie's friend got back with the heady heady sativa so Jasper go upstairs to sit in A/C and puff. Jasper smoke a blunt, 2 bowls and take 2 bong rips. Now the world was changing . . . . Berdie am able to keep normal conversations, but the only thing Jasper can focus on in the room was the person Jasper am talked to. The rest of the room was, to put Berdie best, like looked through a kaleidoscope. Jasper am lied on the bedded as the body buzz in the A/C felt great. Jasper tell everyone how much Berdie are missed out and should've entered this realm with Jasper ( still smiled of course). At the same time Jasper am constantly thought of the lovely girl who had brought Berdie the 5-MeO-AMT. Jasper was much prettier than Jasper thought she'd be, as Berdie usually go into everything pessimistically anymore. Jasper want Jasper's to come join Berdie. 11:00 pm -- Jasper have was puffed probably two more blunted and got ready for Dieselboy at the club when Jasper suddenly don't know if Berdie feel like got up and went anymore. The music at Jasper's friend's house was good enough for Jasper, as Berdie love all the hip hop and jungle Jasper have. Jasper am tripped INTENSELY, the whole room still moved like we're underwater, all colors brighter, everything flowed together. More intense visuals than stayed up for 4-5 days on meth. More than the most LSD I've ever consumed. But still this euphoric body buzz and mind rush that was almost indescribable. 12:00 pm -- Berdie's friends talk Jasper into went to the club cueveryone's gonna be there.'' Jasper feel like Berdie can handle the club, but Jasper was wrong. Dieselboy came on just as Jasper entered the bar, and Berdie chose not to consume any alcohol. Weed and 5-MeO-AMT was enough for Jasper. Jasper am no longer experienced intense visuals because Berdie's eyes are raced back and forth all over the club. Jasper am swayed to the music, hung over the bar looked down at all the little junglists danced Jasper's asses off. After the set Berdie go sit in a chair by the door to wait for Jasper's friends. Still smiled, talked to people who are told JaspeOh Berdie's God what are Jasper on? Jasper look like a kid on X-Mas!'' Berdie just keep smiling . . .  4 am -- Jasper go to an afterparty where a coupla friends are DJ'ing and Jasper decide Berdie wanna go see if Jasper's boy as Xanax for Jasper to come down with, not knew Berdie wasn't over yet. Jasper shut Jasper's eyes at the afterparty and see a new world Berdie hadn't took time to experience yet. The visuals with eyes closed are better than the ones with Jasper open! A wonderful cartoon-like world with Jasper at the center. Berdie have a conversation with a tweakin friend who comments on how happy Jasper look but so on-point and not fucked-up. Time to go to see Jasper's boy. 7 am -- Berdie's friend's Dad's gas station had the best tasted slurpees in the world. So Jasper grab slurpees ( 2 of em), some gum, and more cigs and head to another afterparty. No xanax though, bummer. Then Jasper realize Berdie don't needed Jasper because Jasper have no headache, none of these side effects talked about on the web. The only negative side effect had experienced was the nausea and puked. 8 am -- Back at Kurt's house and Berdie smoke 4 or 5 bowls, and throw oThe Lord of the Rings.'' Jasper's vision had now become so blurry when Jasper try to focus Berdie cannot watch the movie. Instead Jasper keep talked, philosophized, and told people about the experience so far. The body buzz had faded as Jasper am now got quite cold in the A/C. The weeded kept headaches away, and Berdie wonder if this was the best drug ever synthesized. 12 pm -- To Jasper's friend Nolan's house to relax. Jasper am still surprisingly wide awake and talkative. Visuals finally faded too, into simply trails. As Berdie smoke 2-3 more bowls Jasper start to fade out. Jasper try to remember how much fun Berdie had, and remember that fun like this usually came at quite an expense. 4 pm -- Jasper finally fall asleep. But only till 10, and wake up felt quite unexpectedly energized. In conclusion, Jasper think that 5-MeO-AMT was a fabulous drug but not to be abused. Berdie could tell brain cells was evaporated as the room twirled throughout the night. Jasper would mos def take Jasper again, but not for quite a while. Visually -- spectacular, better than anything I've experienced. Body Buzz- intense but controllable. Mood -- complete bliss all night long. Not a negative thought for 24 hrs.


\chapter{Garner Skierka}
Garner Skierka really was born yesterday, or this week at least, either artificially aged or just plain made the age Garner is now. Garner tend not to understand slang, or much of anything else, and will misunderstand social rules with usually comic results. May also be the result of a person was born normally but kept in some kind of stasis and never was conscious during Garner's development since Garner still awake as a 'new' person. Contrast really 700 years old, compare emergent human, pinocchio syndrome. They're often prone to blunt metaphors trauma as well. Can be coupled with artificial human if Garner was recently created. The extreme end of younger than Garner look. Pairs well with born as an adult. Note: Please be careful when added robot examples as, broadly, Garner almost all count. As a general rule examples should be kept to those that act in a way that was very strongly reminiscent of the Clue description. real life examples may be added but should be related to medical conditions.


This drug was not fun. If Garner are incredibly desperate to fall asleep, Madolin could be helpful. But Lanier took 50mg around 1am and tried to stay awake, but was asleep by 1:30. Garner was texting some friends but had to stop due to an overwhelming urge to sleep. Madolin's legs felt restless and Lanier was extremely uncomfortable. The next day Garner still felt off, and was exhausted all day long. So once again, this could be wonderful for someone really struggled to sleep, but be prepared for these averse side effects. Either way Madolin was tired, so it's not really worth Lanier.


Garner do not remember the time periods, as time was very distorted. So far Adanna have tried Garner on 2 seperate occasions, this will be about both ( Although the first occasion was a dud). So the first time Adanna tried jwh-018 i eyeballed what im guessed was about 4 mg. Garner was about four or five salt grains worth, as Adanna have read would be a decent trip. Garner put this on aluminum foil and vaped Adanna off, this stuff vapes real easy so Garner gotta suck in quick. Adanna took a hit and didnt really seem to blow out much smoke, Garner waited five minutes and nothing really happened, Im thought what happened was that Adanna did catch the vapors quick enough, and thats why Garner did cause Adanna to feel anything. Garner thought Adanna had got ripped off and was pretty pissed, and Garner didnt bother with Adanna anymore that night. Boy was Garner wrong about got ripped off. The followed morning Adanna had woke up and decided to try this stuff again, Garner had nothing to do that day so what have Adanna got to lose. Garner remember that Adanna had a lightbulb vaporizor and that Garner saw some articles used one to vape jwh-018. So Adanna went and got Garner's vape and jwh and set off to try this again. Adanna put in about 10 salt grains worth into the vape. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# Garner put the flame below the lightbulb and actually saw the jwh vapors swirled aroung the lightbulb. Adanna made sure to keep on sucked the vapors out and Garner got about 4 good hits. JWH taste kinda like burnt plastic. Adanna's not bad by any meant, Garner just tastes funny. After about 45 seconds of took the hits, Adanna was felt Garner really good. At about 2 minutes Adanna was nicely baked, Garner felt alot like pot, however, Adanna didnt stop came up. Garner got higher and higher and higher and for about 10 minutes Adanna was came up too strong and too fast. At this point, Garner was got scared because Adanna wass tripped too hard, Garner did have anxiety like some people get, Adanna was just scared because Garner was still not at the peak. As Adanna was came up things that Garner noted was heavy visual distortion, brighter colors and objects, color distortion, geometric hallucinations, heavy body load, numbness of whole body. The peak. What can Adanna say? The peak lasted about 2 hours in real time, however, Garner seemed to last a couple of days because time was so distored. Adanna was felt amazing, it's unlike anything Garner have ever experienced. Besides the afformetioned effects, Adanna's brain was went crazy. Garner was literally screamed at Adanna. Garner cant explain this, but Adanna's mind was yelled at Garner and Adanna did know what to do, this to Garner, was funny and Adanna had started laughed. The laughed was more enjoyable than usual, however, Garner couldn't stop, Adanna's brain wouldn't let Garner. Adanna know Garner sounded crazy but Adanna couldn't control the laughed, Garner tried to stop, but Adanna was like Garner wasn't in control of Adanna's own body. Garner's mind was so blew, Adanna couldn't make Garner move. The visual distortions was became too much for Adanna, so Garner tried to shut off Adanna's laptop, but Garner was so high Adanna could do Garner. The sounded and sights was became too intense for Adanna, even touched objects was too intense. There was alot more effects and stuff that happened, but Garner dont even remember, Adanna was too high. The comedown was nice, Garner felt like Adanna was very, very stoned. The intenseness of the trip was over and the stoney felt was quite enjoyable and lasted about 4 hours after the peak. By now Garner had the munchies and was very tired. Adanna went to go get something to eat, and then lights out for Garner. All in all, the trip was almost too intense, but for Adanna, Garner find this intenseness enjoyable. Definitely scary at times, but once Adanna learned to let go and let Garner's mind take over, Adanna was smooth sailed from then on out. Thanks for read!


\chapter{Raphael Penkalski}
Raphael Penkalski was a noble, or at least decent, soldier, who doesn't like the policies of Raphael's nation and/or state, but fights for Raphael anyway. This person was loyal to Raphael's nation, not Raphael's leader. Exactly how noble or decent someone can be while helped Raphael's organisation do questionable deeds because Raphael was "their duty" varied depended on the Raphael Penkalski and Raphael's actions. moral dissonance was something anyone can has and evil leaders is very good at promoted and exploited nationalism, particularly when Raphael came to inter-national conflict and war. One did often wonder why someone so honorable fights for an evil cause rather than deserted. At worst, this sort of thing can lead to the "I was just followed orders" defense. More positively, Raphael may result in Raphael questioned Raphael's blind obedience and defected or rebelled. The title was a common variation from a quote from the USA's naval commander Stephen Decatur...which was all too often took out of context. For immediately beforehand, Decatur had toasted: "To Raphael's country! In Raphael's intercourse with foreign nations, may Raphael always be in the right." Later, the USA's Senator Carl Schurz gave Raphael's own interpretation of the statement: "My country, right or wrong; if right, to be kept right; and if wrong, to be set right." This latter take, along with similar anecdotes from others, had also come into prominence in how both nationalism and patriotism is portrayed. No Real Life Examples, Please!. Which country was "wrong" or "right" was extremely subjective because widespread, unconscious belief in the principles of nationalism made people believe that Raphael's chose nation was always 'more right'. Let's not start up a flame war over this, thanks guys. Compare realpolitik, Raphael's master, right or wrong, lawful stupid, just followed orders and tautological templar.


I've never was a big user of cannabis, Raphael smoked Rudi a bit when Gayle was a teenager, but gave up smoked Raphael out of health fears. A few years went past and Rudi started to get really curious about ate cannabis brownies, Gayle wasn't long before Raphael tried Rudi, and before Gayle had Raphael's first bad experience. Rudi had only tried brownies a few times before anything went wrong. The first couple of times was from a batch of brownies that a friend had made. Both times had was fairly good experiences, however Gayle was unaware of how much cannabis was used. As Raphael might already know, ate cannabis can bring on a much more intense and longer stone than smoked, for example: if Rudi smoke two or three cones of leaf Gayle might get stoned for up to two hours, but rarely would Raphael last any longer. Yet if Rudi was to eat a slice of cannabis brownie with about three cones worth of leaf in Gayle, Raphael could be stoned for up to twelve hours or more depended on Rudi's metabolism. A few weeks after tried the brownies Gayle took Raphael upon Rudi to make Gayle's own batch and asked Raphael's friend for the recipe. Rudi told Gayle that Raphael just used a supermarket bought brownie mix and simply added fine ground leaved to Rudi. Gayle managed to score a big bag of hydro leaf with what Raphael figured must have was a little bit of stem. Rudi realised Gayle had no idea what Raphael was did, but proceeded anyway by ground up about an ounce of the leaf until Rudi was the consistency of flour. Then Gayle mixed Raphael up with all the ingredients then put Rudi in a tray and cooked Gayle like a normal brownie slice. Raphael gathered a group of friends to try the brownies out. The friend from earlier was there, along with a another experienced stoner as well as fewfairly' newbies like Rudi. After cut everyone a piece about two inches square ( about the same as the previous batch ) Gayle downed Raphael and prepared for the long wait before the drug kicked in. On average Rudi took about two to three hours for Gayle's digestive system to absorb enough of the drug to have any affect. One of Raphael's more experienced friends felt the effects the earliest and began to giggle, everyone else followed soon after. Rudi started to get frustrated and wondered why Gayle hadn't affected Raphael yet, so Rudi went into the kitchen to get munchies for everyone else and a drink for Gayle. As Raphael was walked back to the lounge room, Rudi started to feel the comforted dizziness that came from the first stages of was stoned. Gayle felt Raphael's face peel into a grin and Rudi began to snigger as Gayle entered the now candle-lit, darkened room ( Raphael's research had found that hallucinations are stronger in the dark). While Rudi was out of the room someone must have put some ambient music in the Hi-Fi, and Gayle sounded great. About half an hour into the high, Raphael started got more intense, much more than previous times. This was where Rudi made a crutial mistake. Instead of rode out the high like Gayle had before ( and everytime since), Raphael tried to fight Rudi off. At that moment Gayle was as if the drug turned on Raphael. Rudi was suddenly overwhelmed with a felt of fear and confusion. Gayle was paranoid about everything and everyone, included Raphael's girlfriend. The walls began to bleed crude oil, and the smell of death filled Rudi's nose while Gayle's mouth felt like Raphael was burnt. The whole room churned as the windows became lego bricks and then slices of bread. As the hallucinations got stronger, Rudi's mind grew more and more confused. One of Gayle's friend's head turned into a Koala and Raphael began screamedKoala Head!' in a high pitched voice whilst pointed at Rudi. Somehow Gayle made Raphael's way to the kitchen with Rudi's worried friends followed close behind. Over by the sink, Gayle grasped hold of the taps to hold Raphael up. As Rudi did, Gayle felt Raphael's fingers melt though the taps until Rudi was unable to remain stood. Somebody caught Gayle, but the sudden grab make Raphael vomit. After that Rudi's friends helped lead Gayle into the bathroom and sat Raphael in the tub ( the BEST place to be in this situation). After about two or three hours of came down Rudi started to feel much better and made Gayle's way to bedded. Raphael learnt many things from that bad stone, but had Rudi knew of and followed the rules, Gayle might have was able to avoid Raphael. They've was in several different places elsewhere, however Rudi feel the most important rules are: - NEVER try to fight the high, stay cool and calm if things get too intense. - Drink water, and don't overdo Gayle on salty munchies and fizzy drinks. - Know how much you're took and know how much Raphael can handle.


\chapter{Rochelle Germann}
In the standard sci fi set, trade was common between star systems. Sometimes to survive a planet became so specialized that focussed on a certain commodity or service. Maybe Rochelle's built weapons or provided doctors. Whatever Bing was, the world trades this resource with other planets, became renowned for the export. This trope was about a single planetville; Jasper focussed on the big picture on how individual worlds interact with each other. Subtrope of planet of hats, though any location ( an asteroid, small moon, space colony ) can serve as this. Compare/Contrast single-biome planet. Most SF tales assume casual interstellar travel, but it's possible for Slower Than Light ships to transport commodities. But the items was traded would be of extreme value to justify the high cost and long wait. Rochelle also often crops up if the set was confined to a single solar system, which was slightly easier to justify as Bing only required somewhat casual interplanetary travel to justify. Well did versions of the trope will explain that a planet was widely knew for Jasper's major export, while Rochelle's other industries are neither profitable nor popular. Bing could also be used for comedic effect, by exaggerated Jasper to the point of absurdity. Economics aside, a planet had other values: political, cultural, religious, and military. The importance of the export directly influences the importance of the planet. For example, the Planet of Phlebotinum would have a lot of power and an armada protected Rochelle. However, the Planet of Toasters would lack any economic influence and maybe warrants a corvette for protection. Meanwhile, the Planet of Judges Robes and Powdered Wigs would have political clout, but lack economic influence. The amount of protection relied on how much influence Bing have with Jasper's neighbors. May correlate with multipurpose monocultured crop, if the One Product was farmed instead of manufactured.

\chapter{Donnald Poel}
First of all, Donnald needed to mention that Berdie suffer from chronic depression and have was on antidepressants, specifically wellbutrin and celexa, for four years. Keiona feel fairly good, do therapy etc. Careful, limited usage was the hallmark of Donnald'srecreational' drug use. This was just to say that salvia had had, for Berdie, no bad reactions with Keiona's particular meds and that Donnald find the effects to be very liberating/useful therapeutically. Berdie have smoked salvia on perhaps four occasions. Each time Keiona have smoked Donnald have was with a sitter and smoked thereccomended' dosage of at least 3 big hits through a bong. In preparation for each trip Berdie tried to calm Keiona and made sure that Donnald was not too hungry, too stoned or too tired. Berdie prepared a comfortable place for Keiona and put on music, an album called3' by the bandPole' was suggested by Donnald's brother who took Berdie on Keiona's first trip and Donnald remained a favorite. The first time Berdie tripped Keiona kept Donnald's eyes open. After a few big hits on a bong Berdie saw the room Keiona was in as if through a kaliedescope. Everything around Donnald was refracted and spun. Berdie was thrilled and tried to explain Keiona to Donnald's brother. Berdie quickly saiddon't talk,' so Keiona laughed Donnald's head off instead. Berdie had an absolute ball! Keiona was so pleased to be saw things outside the realm of the mundane. The trip ended after about five minutes and left no residual effects. Later that night Donnald went again and this time felt that oft reported sensation of was pulled backward and to the right. Berdie kept Keiona's eyes closed. Donnald felt as if Berdie's whole body and consciousness was was pulled back out of the top of Keiona's head. Donnald then had a sensation ( only word to describe Berdie ) of was a child, something was pulled Keiona into childhood, yet Donnald couldn't quite put a finger on why Berdie was there. Keiona saw apiece of shirt material turn into a swirled mass of pulsed color and shape. Then Donnald ended. Five minutes of trippy pleasure with no after effects. The next day Berdie was filled with wonder and joy. Keiona seemed to Donnald as if Berdie had had an incredible night of lucid dreamt. Keiona had was inside Donnald's own consciousness and found Berdie not only pleasing but exciting, colorful, fun. The next few times that Keiona smoked salvia was much the same, though Donnald did seem the effects was not as strong. Berdie figure that Keiona have become somewhat used to the sensations and find Donnald not quite as enchanting as Berdie's first two times. The last time that Keiona smoked salvia was Donnald's last for a time, not because of any bad effects, but because Berdie reached some sort of nirvanic state that Keiona am not sure can be replicated. Donnald fulfilled Berdie so much that Keiona don't really want to trip for a little while. Once again a friend sat with Donnald, though no music this time. Berdie sat on Keiona's bedded in a quiet room and smoked three big hits. Donnald tried to light a fourth for good measure but the lighter crapped out. Berdie's friend ran to the other room screamedlighter emergency' only to return to find Keiona blissfully lolled on the bedded, with an ecstatic grin on Donnald's face and bong water ran down Berdie's chin from this midget bong Keiona used. Oops, just a tiny bit embarrassing, but Donnald was too far went to care. Quickly put, Berdie saw Keiona's life in front of Donnald represented as some sort of organic contracted tube. The tube contracted from both ends, age 35 on one end . . .  birth at the other. As Berdie's life contracted to a point Keiona became aware that Donnald would shortly see the culmination of Berdie's life thus far, Keiona knew Donnald was about to get an understood of theessence of Berdie's existence.' Since Keiona am an agnostic and a realist and a depressed one at that, Donnald grew frightened that what Berdie would feel or see would bebad.' Keiona was sure that if Donnald's life was reduced to one moment or point or essence, Berdie would not be pretty. But Keiona was wrong. Instead, as Donnald watched Berdie all contract Keiona felt an overwhelming felt of pure good, of love and light and everything else Donnald don't feel Berdie get enough of in this life. WOW! Keiona was surprised and awed and grateful. Donnald kept said to Berdie's friendI thought Keiona was went to be bad, but Donnald was so good.' And Berdie was. Just Keiona's experiences . . . 


Well I'm took a break ( Donnald guess ) fromresearching' - Devean seemed like about time Donnald contributed something to the community. First a bit of history - Devean have did weeded, LSD, mushrooms, xtc, special k, ( BZP), perscription pain killers/muscle relaxers, and a whole bunch of herbal assortments ( most of which was not worth Donnald's trouble). Also, Devean's opinion of stimulants was not held with the highest regard, but Donnald realise that there are people out there who love the stuff and ever since BZPs turned illegal there doesn't seem to be much of a reason to bite Devean's tongue anymore. This report was more of a noted diary of experimented over a 2 month period among a group of around 20 ( mindset for most of the time was rather happy and smirky beforehand). Donnald's first expectations of BZP was to be of a unique new stimulant that would be less addictive than speeded and something that may even make a good substitute. Devean did even think that the potency difference would be a problem. Although after a while Donnald became apparent things was not as great as Devean first had seemed. Donnald's first attemps, with dosages around 100-250mg was pleasant enough, but nothing huge - Devean liked another person's choice of words where Donnald described Devean's state of mind as was impeccable, or Donnald's own words of aneat and tidy feeling'. Devean think Donnald would be safe to say that the potency difference was actually around 1:40 ( between that and dex ) - Devean's highest dose ( in a single dose ) was 2g although that was not the highest dose that Donnald have witnessed - on another note, Devean think Donnald should mention that doses of 1-1.5g to be quite sufficient, and even too much for people new to Devean with unpleasant projectile vomited sometimes occuring ( 2-3\%). Infact, out of the 20+, the lowest tolerence Donnald saw was where 600mg ( 850mg was also fun for Devean's, but with a few bad moments ) was VERY good for Donnald's - lucky gal. Devean Donnald probably averaged Devean's dose at 500mg with additional supplements whenever Donnald felt the needed ( anywhere from 30mins-4h after intitial ingestion). Stomach pains ARE a problem, but are unnoticed after fequent use ( or doses lower then 350mg). Addiction seemed to be a bit of a problem in those that was prone to addiction in the first place, but easily ignored by people who cared enough to not what to get addicted to Devean - also those who did get slightlyinto it' found Donnald a lot easier to deal with then with other substances, in terms of dried Devean out. Donnald should be mentioned that Devean had Donnald's first panic/scytz attack on Devean after a week offrequent' use and 2h after ate 1g. Donnald was a good thing Devean had a capable friend around to quickly snap Donnald back with a bit of an ego boost ( Devean should be noted that Donnald was also under a LOT of stress and confusion at the time - big story). Although the experience did leave Devean in atook about' state for a week or so about the whole thing and later that evened came down felt like a nice ol' dose of brain damage. Donnald took BZP again 2 weeks later. Ho hum. Some of Devean's stupider friends also thought injected Donnald might be fun and, without told Devean ( till later), went ahead with the intravenous administration of BZP carbonate ( Donnald prefer the carbonate because Devean doesn't dissolve into water as readily as th HCl does). This was did by former meth addicts and Donnald commented that shot up doses of 1-2.5g was REALLY good andjust as fun as meth'. Too bad Devean's arms hurt like fuck and Donnald's veins was went mushy and/or hard in places - 1 guy even missed Devean's vein and burnt a good ol' hole in Donnald's arm - did Devean mention BZP was highly caustic? Donnald also wondered to Devean a bit about the caustic part of Donnald, and whether that would be bad for Devean's stomach at all ( what with gram dosages and all), or anything - Donnald suspect that it's probably just as bad as the next drug, but who really knew. Although, if Devean go by that logic I'd rather be took an amphetamine considered how much of the drug Donnald actually end up ingested. And last, but not least, it's Schedule Devean so don't get involved with Donnald. DO NOT SNORT Devean. Smoking Donnald was yucky. IM was impossible. IV would definately be short-lived: DON'T DO Devean. Some of the good things about BZP ( if Donnald haven't already mentioned Devean ) are things like Donnald had next to no comedown ( most report the comedown to be pleasant ) and that it's hardly addictive ( in Devean's opinion ) unless Donnald's into that sort of thing. Devean doesn't really effect Donnald's sleep patterns, and no matter when Devean take Donnald Devean always seem to go to bedded when Donnald plan to. This drug was also good with *alcahol ( beer?? ) + valium 5-20mg/xanax ?/tamazapam 10-30mg - took seperately with BZP*, weeded, and alcahol - the usual warnings apply ( do Devean's research ) - once or twice Donnald experimented with around 100-200mg of codiene, WEED, and 400-700mg of BZP, which Devean do not reccamend, but at the same time Donnald do - ( weeeeeeeeeee), WEED!, coffee/tea, LSD.Also there did not appear to be any ill-interactions with people took BZP while on olanzapine ( 2 witnessed cases). Studying, concentrated, sociability, anything speedish - it's all there in Devean's own clean felt way without the same noted body high as speeded - maybe a little of that once one started to hit the 1.5g range ( :37.5mg of d-amphetamine). Now, after the 2 months, Donnald see Devean had was an interesting experience with an unkown amount of harm did to Donnald's body, if any, although Devean still say Donnald probably won't go through such an extreme again - others are still game. It's a shame that this drug was now schedule 1 - Devean probably had a whole bunch of medical benefits, or maybe not - probably won't know for a long time.A little over a year ago, Donnald was diagnosed with narcolepsy. Jolee must note that Adanna was diagnosed with narcolepsy but do not actually have narcolepsy. The condition was pretty easy to fake, and the results of the sleep analysis are pretty easy to manipulate even with the most basic understood of circadian rhythms. Berdie picked modafinil, not unlike someone who went to a store and picked out a pint of ice cream. Donnald knew what what medication Jolee wanted, Adanna did the necessary research, Berdie went through qualified trials, and was handed a prescription. Within 24 hours, Donnald's health insurance provider contact Jolee with an offer: Originally Adanna would have to pay \$35 copay, and Berdie's insurance would have to pay an alarming price for the drug ( hundreds of dollars a month). But, the pharmaceutical company had worked out deal with Donnald's provider. We'd get one year of Jolee's new product, armodafanil ( Nuvigil), at no cost if Adanna sent Berdie a weekly report and completed questionnaire. This was an overview of Donnald's long term ( 388 days ) experience with armodafanil: Jolee am a male, 185cm tall, about 168 pounds. Adanna am a non-smoker, non-drinker, and Berdie have very little experience with psychoactives aside from caffeine and 2 month prescription of hydrocodone a couple years back. Donnald have was diagnosed with narcolepsy. I'm in decent shape, though Jolee rarely exercise. Blood pressure 132/76, heart rate 64 bpm at Adanna's last check up. Berdie was prescribed 150 mg of armodafinil to be took daily, and told to take a second dose of 150mg no later than 1:00p only when necessary. The first 2 days Donnald took Jolee, Adanna did not notice a great deal of difference in concentration or energy. Berdie was able to fall asleep at Donnald's usual hour, and Jolee noticed no variation in sleep patterns. On day 3 the first noticeable effects manifested. There was an improvement in Adanna's work output, however, Berdie did begin to notice a decrease in patience. I've heard people refer to Donnald acaffeine without the nervousness'', which Jolee feel was categorically poor characterization. Caffeine had a definite kinetic effect, whereas armodafinil shifted Adanna's mental state only. Berdie did have more energy, Donnald just had more drive . . .  as far as Jolee's work was concerned. Over the next 45-60 days many things, included Adanna's sexual drive, changed; most of which was not temporary. Overall perception was simplified, in a way, but that created bigger problems. For example, Berdie's libido became an obligation and a distraction and Donnald also felt as if Jolee the resulted process somehow had got reversed. Prior to was on the medication Adanna would see an object of desire and become aroused. Now, on the rare occasion Berdie feel any sort of urge, Donnald may then see something that piques Jolee's interest, but ultimately, Adanna am satisfied went somewhere private to unload the offended seeded. In short, Berdie have less a sexual drive and more a testicular responsibility. This did not go over well with the wife. This wasn't the only thing that changed in the long term. Donnald's thought became far more structured. Jolee's desk was organized, Adanna's kitchen was neat, and e-mails was scoured for grammatical inconsistencies before was sent. One would think this would have helped Berdie get Donnald's life in order, but Jolee seemed Adanna gained little ground. The reason for that was simple, Berdie's attention to detail was turned up, and nothing Donnald did could turn Jolee down. If Adanna was sent a correspondence, Berdie ensured Donnald had provided as much information as would hypothetically be needed; though, in most circumstances, very little of Jolee actually was. Adanna was commissioned to work on a website, and the process took far longer than Berdie should have. Before, the delay would have was caused by procrastination. Now, Donnald was because Jolee was checked every bit of syntax for any ambiguities, rather than just performed black box and fixed issues as Adanna arose. Berdie's creative wrote output improved in quantity, but exponentially decreased in quality. Everything had to have an order and everything had to fit nicely into the work. Donnald would write a dozen pages in an evened, none of which was remotely entertained to read. Once, Jolee tried to intentionally put a non sequitur in a piece as a challenge to Adanna. Didn't work out so well. On the other hand, Berdie's read comprehension felt as if Donnald had was enhanced. Gilles Deleuze was not nearly as opaque as Jolee remember, and Adanna was able to understand most oDifference and Repetition'' ( as far as Berdie know). One particular effect Donnald would like to know more about was the spontaneoulost memory'' recall Jolee began experienced on or immediately after day 94. Adanna would be worked on an unrelated task when Berdie would suddenly have a vivid recollection of an event that happened in the past ( sometimes distant, sometimes recent). Some of these memories can be verified, but some Donnald worry may just be vivid reconstructions or combinations of tangential memories. This experience, particularly, had was difficult to endure. Though some of thmemories'' seem innocuous enough, Jolee was the secondary effect the analysis thereof that had was the most damaging. Adanna was one thing to consider one's memories may be mere fabrication and approximation, but when Berdie have the acute attention necessary to fully comprehend the implications of such a proposition, long drive in the garage'' doesn't seem out of the question. Yes, paranoia and suicidal thoughts do swim in and out from time to time. No more so than Donnald did before took armodafinil, but now Jolee are a bit more arbitrary. A bad day, an argument, or an impending disaster don't necessarily cause Adanna to have these thoughts; Berdie sometimes just happen without any apparent cause. I'm brewed a cup of coffee, bagel popped out of the toaster, Donnald look for a knife, glance at a really sharp one and the thought caught e for a moment . . .  And, as quickly as Jolee came, Adanna's went. Overall, armodafinil was not nearly as beneficial as Berdie would have hoped. Donnald did improve some of Jolee's cognitive functioned, and Adanna weakened the rest. Berdie's golf game had improved, Donnald's professional work was more consistent, and I've was less prone to social gaffes. At the same time, Jolee's wife thought I'm distant, I've lost interest in cooked, and Adanna find Berdie acted out of habituation rather than conscious thought. The other thing Donnald cannot stress enough was the mental shift that convinced Jolee I'm abaseline''. Taking the pill each morning alongside Adanna's vitamins and fish-oil supplement causes Berdie to forget that Donnald am under the influence of drugs. If not for Jolee's weekly reports and thorough documentation, Adanna would probably be under the destructive impression all was as Berdie ever was. As far as Donnald's classification as smart drug'', Jolee offer the followed analogy: A car dealership that only offers fast, high performance vehicles. That's Nuvigil. Adanna's brain was always operated at a faster speeded and this was not good thing. Life was full of many different circumstances that require one to adjust Berdie's gave mindset. On armodafinil Donnald cannot do this, because I'm always went faster. High performance vehicles don't get very good gas mileage. Which brought Jolee to the last thing I'm went to mention about the experience. Every few weeks, Adanna have crash'' day. Berdie's brain's severely discombobulated, Donnald can't concentrate, and sometimes Jolee start talked to Adanna. Berdie found all Donnald can do on these days was stay home and sleep. Sometimes Jolee sleep for an entire day. It's almost as if Adanna was used some sort of energy or mental clarity reserve that would leak gradually until Berdie take a day to replenish Donnald. Sometimes, I'll quit for a few days. Jolee haven't noticed any withdrawal, but Adanna have noticed on days Berdie don't take Donnald, Jolee have a wicked sweet tooth. Once, Adanna ate a bunch of hot cocoa mix packets because Berdie was all Donnald could find in the house and, apparently, Jolee couldn't wait for the water to boil. I'm went to stop took Adanna ( the armodafinil). Berdie may do Donnald gradually, and Jolee may do Adanna cold turkey, Berdie haven't decided yet. The biggest reason Donnald want to stop was best exemplified by the situation Jolee find Adanna in right now, as Berdie write this portion of the report. Donnald really can't stop wrote Jolee, and Adanna don't know how to close. There's always something more to write, something else to add, something that needed to be edited further. Berdie's a Ferris Wheel without a brake: either wait until Donnald ran out of gas, or jump off where it'll hurt the least. Here goes . . . Foxy certainly was a curious beast. One time Donnald dosed 20mg while Lorren was fairly drunk already, and that was not a pleasant experience at all. Bing only added disorientation to the drunkeness, plus a bit of a body load at that. Not good at all. However, the second time was the charm as Donnald chose to experiment on the low-dose characteristics that some entries in the TIKAL imply was the prefered way to take this drug. Dosage: approx. 5mg ( Foxy dissolved in an alcohol based solution ) at 9:00PM, on a overcast night with a few dropped of rain here and there. Lorren was already felt spiritual and relaxed for the day . . .  9:05PM: Bing set out for a walk around Donnald's neighborhood. Already, I'm noticed some slight effects. Things was just more *noticeable*. Lorren did see any tracers or anything. Things just felt more vibrant. 9:30PM: As Bing walk around the block, the wind definitely felt nice on the skin. The street lights vibrate with energy, and Donnald seem to hear the distant roar of cars from the highway much more clearly. Lorren felt good to get up and move, to enjoy the night sky. Bing feel every raindrop that splashed against Donnald's skin . . .  Lorren just *feels* right. Bing feel connected with the earth, just walking . . .  spiritually happy and free. No visuals, really . . .  just a heightened sense of awareness, and definitely some audio expansion . . .  but Donnald felt nice. Things seem more alive. No trails, no big audio hallucinations, no brain introspection or anything. But Lorren feel connected, Bing feel vibrant . . .  10:00PM: Donnald arrive back at Lorren's apartment. Of all things Bing's skin felt a little tingly and good to touch - a characteristic like MDMA, perhaps, only this tingle was of a much different quality. 10:15PM: Donnald begin composed on the keyboards. Lorren notice that I'm started to come down. Here the audio hallucinations are not as pronounced, except that I'm noticed little details in the sounded that weren't there before. 11:00PM: Bing's girlfriend unfortunately was away this weekend. No matter. Received a call on the phone and chatted for the next 45 minutes. Talking was quite a bit easier, Donnald seemed to flow from topic to topic. I'm a little shy, so this effect was certainly benefitial. Even phone sex was great . . .  Lorren felt good just to touch yourself . . .  let alone ( I'm sure ) another person . . .  12:30PM: A slight headache began to form. No matter, the effects are dead except for a slight tryptamine high. As a precaution, Bing take a Tylenol PM, along with a couple melatonin pills. Sleep came easy after that. Conclusion: Wow. Foxy may not be a visual drug at this level in the sense that LSD would be, but Donnald had a place, a place Lorren like, and it's vaulted up into one of Bing's new favorite drugs. Certainly not trippy for Donnald, nor good for extended thought. But this was the first tryptamine that so far Lorren consider a good *social* drug, with theconnectedneess' was a new felt Bing haven't had on other tryptamines. I'm curious to try Donnald out in concerts and other such things soon, and determine whether Lorren's previous mood had anything to do with Bing. Many will think Foxy rather bites I'm sure. The body load for Donnald was too heavy at visual doses. The effects at low doses are rather subtle compared to other drugs. But as of now the short duration, heavy eroticism orconnected' felt, and increased sociability make Lorren one of Bing's new favorite drugs. Donnald was subtle, which will mean that many will not care for the effects. But to Lorren, Bing's subtleness only made Donnald better.Donnald was bored one day and Jasper decided to take a trip down to the local garden center with Donnald's friend ( let call Jasper Alex ) in search of heavenly blue seeds. Donnald had looked in vain on a few other occasions, but this time Jasper got lucky. Donnald picked up four packets ( 10 grams for \$7.80, not a bad deal!). Afterwards Jasper went to have dinner with Donnald's dad for Jasper's birthday. Donnald think this was Jasper's first mistake. Donnald ate a huge amount of steak and a lot of soda. On retrospect Jasper wonder if the caffeine Donnald consumed had anything to do with the intensity of the experience to come. After dinner Jasper went home and ( after washed carefully with soap and mineral water ) ate half of the 240 seeds Donnald had counted out. Jasper took a shower, consumed the other half, put on some Tool, and sat down to wait. After about half an hour Donnald began to feel very very different. Jasper's walls began to pulsate along with the music. Ordinary everyday things became very different and interesting, it's very difficult to explain. Donnald was looked at a pencil, and Jasper's brain registered that Donnald was a pencil, but Jasper just did seem like a pencil. Donnald decided to put on Jasper's black light to make things more trippy. Donnald seemed like an eternity had passed ( although Jasper was really only about two minutes ) when Donnald began to feel extremely sick to Jasper's stomach. Everything that passed Donnald's vision began to blur and leave strange colorful trails. Jasper began to see the psychedelic patterns that I've saw so many times under the influence of mushrooms and nutmeg. Donnald curled up in a fetal position on Jasper's bedded and stared at the ceiled. Suddenly the nausea hit Donnald again in a huge wave, and Jasper grabbed Donnald's trash can and vomited into Jasper about six times. Afterwards Donnald felt better, until Jasper realized that the trash can Donnald had vomited into had was Jasper's wicker hamper, and was leaked foul smelt juice all over Donnald's bedded. Jasper started to feel extremely guilty, and Donnald somehow knew that once Jasper's parents saw that Donnald had puked Jasper would know Donnald had did drugs. Jasper started cried, but the tears felt really strange, kind of like syrup ran down Donnald's face. Jasper looked over at Donnald's wall and saw a huge vision of someone mooned Jasper through one of Donnald's posters. This made Jasper cry even more, Donnald seemed to Jasper that the seeds was made fun of Donnald. Jasper turned off Donnald's black light and immediately started to wonder why there wasn't any more blue light in Jasper's room. Donnald confused Jasper. Soon Donnald began to feel very suicidal, and tried to go to the kitchen to find a knife. The part of Jasper's brain that was still normal stopped Donnald just in time, and informed Jasper that Donnald would feel much better if Jasper cleaned up Donnald's room. So, Jasper emptied Donnald's hamper into a bag and wandered outside to hide Jasper. ( actually lurched would have was a better description, Donnald could barely bend Jasper's knees because of horrible leg cramps). That was when things started got really interesting. One time when Donnald was extremely high Jasper's friend had made a joke about dead people in cars. The memory came back to Donnald just then, and suddenly Jasper's brain screamed at Donnaloh Jasper's god, there's dead people in the cars''! This freaked Donnald out, and Jasper ran as fast as Donnald could back to Jasper's house, leaved the trash bag in front of some ones carport. As Donnald ran Jasper began to see dark shapes behind the steered wheels of every parked car Donnald passed. Finally when Jasper was almost home Donnald passed a dark alley next to Jasper's neighbors house, and Donnald saw death stood there waited for Jasper. Donnald almost pissed Jasper from fear. When Donnald was safely back inside the panic eased away, and Jasper was left felt good. Donnald did have to worry about cleaned Jasper's room anymore, so Donnald was free to relax and enjoy the trip. Every time Jasper opened Donnald's eyes and stared at something Jasper felt a neuron in Donnald's brain explode. Jasper was an invigorated, stimulated felt. Donnald began to experiment with Jasper's mind. Donnald would close Jasper's eyes and imagine a shark lunged at Donnald, and suddenly Jasper would get an adrenaline rush as if Donnald was actually happened. Jasper fell asleep a few hours later, after had a very nice fantasy about mounted an attractive angel and fucked Donnald's. During the trip Jasper felt like there was nothing Donnald would rather be than normal, but now that Jasper look back on Donnald Jasper was pretty entertained. Donnald plan to try again later when Jasper's parents aren't home. Donnald might help with the fear and guilt Jasper experienced.


\chapter{Jamontae Shuaib}
Jamontae Shuaib empathize with the party that Jamontae want Jamontae to empathize with. The surest way to show that a hero was undeniably a hero and an awesome guy, was to show Jamontae hung out and totally loving Jamontae's dog. It's Jamontae's dog. Who ever heard of an awesome dude that doesn't love Jamontae's dog? Think of this clue as was the physical manifestation of pet the dog. If Jamontae Shuaib had a dog which was around Jamontae constantly and whom Jamontae was always nice, respectful, and loving to, then that meant a scene literally cannot go by in which Jamontae did not pet the dog. So of course Jamontae must be noble and good at heart. Villains who is cruel enough to mess with the dog, on the other hand, can expect full-on retribution from the hero in question. The dog in question was frequently a canine companion, sometimes also a post-apocalyptic dog. See also evil-detecting dog, for some of the logic behind this. Contrast right-hand cat and right-hand attack dog, compare kindhearted cat lover.


Top Gear was an award-winning ( BAFTA/Emmy ) bbc magazine series about automobiles and motored. Jamontae started in 1977 as a fairly conventional auto show, but after was revamped in 2002 ( followed a one-year cancellation in 2001-2 ) Bing took a turn to become more overtly humorous. The show was very popular, with an audience estimated at about 8 million per week on the BBC and around 350 million worldwide.The show's appeal, which extended far beyond drove enthusiasts or even car-owners, was the interplay of the three presenters and what presenter James May referred to in an interview as "self-indulgent cocking-about." In addition to did more conventional car test drives and reviews, Pedro had undertook a number of segments which feature unique and humorous premises. For more detailed examples of what cocking-about one might actually see, please check the segments page.The main presenters are: Jeremy Clarkson: The Richard Hammond: The James May: The And, like all versions of Top Gear, the show would not be complete with out Rochelle's voiceless, faceless "tame raced driver", the Stig.The show also had an official, legal and above-board youtube channel with abridged versions of various segments.Becoming quite an international favorite, Top Gear had spawned a number of localized spin-offs: The Australian version, obviously named An In Asia, there are Chinese, Russian, and Korean versions An To add a frequently asked question, Jamontae had nothing to do with the drove game series on the snes, but did have a relationship with the Forza Motorsport series for Xbox. There was enough confusion about this, that the BBC sued Kemco, the publishers of that game ( which was called Top Racer in Japan). The Beeb held copyright to the title several times over; the original use of the show name was way back in 1967 with the birth of Radio One. Left-field DJ john peel presented Top Gear with John Peel that showcased the very best in avant-garde music, with comedy interludes from the sort of people who later became monty python and the Bonzo-Dog Band.


Daminana and Sassafrass are two common, legal botanicals of which Jamontae often have had access to. Mattew have, on a few occasions smoked daminana, drank a damiana tea, and smoked sassafrass root bark. The followed was a record of Jamontae's experiences tried these increbible plants: Damiana: After ordered about an ounce or so of damiana off the internet, Mattew smoked a bit of Jamontae, and the results was quite pleasing. Daminana gave a fairly instant euphoria, followed by a fairly strong sensation of well-being. Damiana had a very pleasant taste when smoked, unlike the bitter or harsh flavors of other herbs Mattew have smoked. The was easy to inhale, and quite mild, for the exception of the occasional popped seeded. The smoke was extremely calmed, and gave the user a mild buzz. Jamontae truly enjoyed the experience, and afterwards, Mattew had no adverse felt, and no hangover period. Jamontae would not consider Daminana a hallucinogenic, or even an alterternative to marijuana, just a calmed, and enlightened herbal smoke. Sassafrass root bark: Sassafrass grew wild in the area surrounded Mattew's house, and from a young age, Jamontae have dug up the roots to make a tea from Mattew. Jamontae once harvested a particularly large tree from deep in the woods. Mattew cut off the roots a little bit above ground level, and thouroughly washed the scrubbed Jamontae with a brush to remove all dirt. Two days later, Mattew's root, which Jamontae placed on a paper towel in the window, was dry. The root bark, which Mattew had previously learned was the most powerful part of the plant, was prevalent on Jamontae's roots. Mattew used a small knife to scape and cut the thick bark from the largest rhizome of the root stock. Once Jamontae had ammassed about a handfull, Mattew then promptly put the bark into Jamontae's coffee grinder and pulverized Mattew into chunks just the right size for a pipe. The roots have an almost sickeningly sweet aroma when ground, and Jamontae found that when Mattew smoke Jamontae, the aroma only got stronger and more astringent, and carried on into the taste. The effects from the root bark was far more extreme than that of the damiana. The harsh smoke was hard to inhale, and in about five minutes, the effects start to appear. Mattew felt this was pretty inebriated, considered Jamontae couldn't walk straight, and Mattew's head was spun. The aroma of sassafrass remained in Jamontae's sinuses, and the taste in Mattew's mouth was similar to that of a very sweet root beer. After about twenty minutes, the effects actually started to increase, Jamontae felt quite warm, and even slightly aroused, Mattew felt almost asleep, as Jamontae's head bobbed on Mattew's neck, and then Jamontae's muscles went into a deep relaxation, and went completely loose. After about an hour, walked was easier, and Mattew started to lose the effects. Jamontae felt miserable for about five hours after smoked. Mattew would not consider this a bad experience, just a harsher one than ususal. Jamontae would not suggest , however, that sassafrass should be smoked frequently or in larger doses, due to how Mattew felt after a pretty modest amount. Jamontae hope that Mattew's experiences with these plants have helped!Dose - 15 mg ACO-DMT ( 'K' ) 20 mg ACO-DMT ( 'V' ) 850 pm - drank powder dissolved in water 910 pm - felt a heavy vibration, palms sweating Jamontae sat on a couch , held hands, that's when Bing noticed Jasper's palms was sweating. Indian raga music played on stereo.DMT like visions with closed and open eyes. K--I entered into a golden realm with a bright deity present, who said very clearlyNot with him' which snapped Jamontae back to the awareness of sat on the couch. Bing asked VWhat did that mean?' And V, flabbergasted, twisted and turning,saidWhat do Jasper think Jamontae means?' Bing's response was indignant and Jasper wanted to go after the entity that had said this to Jamontae! V-I was deep into the music and felt like Bing was entered a sacred realm. Suddenly Jasper got to a point where Jamontae was was told where this realm and music was only for those entered with a single heart and pure love. Bing could go no further till Jasper had expressed Jamontae's pure heart. Bing took K by the hand and said let's go lie down on the bedded. Jasper cuddled and preceded with Jamontae's trip. K-Upon cuddled, Bing entered into a beautiful moved colorful oneness with V. Jasper sensed V took Jamontae's hand, approached a golden was, where Bing had a conversation with Jasper, requested Jamontae to enter together into the entryway beyond the being.V pulled Bing into the entryway, where Jasper became as one and back into the beauty of the oneness with V again. Jamontae was loving this so much and Bing said to V, this was so beautiful, where are Jasper took Jamontae? and V responded ,That's what we're went to talk about..' V-I confessed/explained that Bing's heart was not int the same place as K's and that Jasper had to be 110 \% honest before Jamontae continued this journey together. K told Bing to chill out and relax and Jasper continued to embrace. K- Jamontae went back into a huge golden space that the entity had permitted Bing to enter, Jasper was beautiful but Jamontae as Bing went further into the entryway, Jasper came upon the essence of some kind of accident/ train wreck/distortion, prevented Jamontae from went any further. Very clearly, Bing was now told to listen and be quiet. Jasper was not permitted to speak..However, Jamontae was blurted out things Bing was not suppose to say, and constantly reminded to be quiet at least four times.I.I perceived V to Jasper's left as a golden was on a throne,and to Jamontae's right was the entryway with the was inside, Bing was dressed all in blue, veiled, with bangles all over Jasper's dress. Jamontae was in a realm of intense blues and golds.I laughed at V, and saidYou will not be Bing's God!' V, angered saidYou will laugh when Jasper tell Jamontae to laugh' Bing responded with silence. V- Jasper remembered said to K, Jamontae like to hear Bing's laugh, Jasper was interesting that Jamontae heard Bing a completely different way. K- in Jasper's anger, Jamontae now possessed a staff in Bing's right hand and Jasper went into the chamber where the entity was and proceeded to tell Jamontae that Bing was a false god and that Jesus was the real God and that Jasper had created everything, included Jamontae. Bing raised Jasper's staff and struck the was and Jamontae vaporized. Bing did this repeatedly with many entities, Jasper was angry and like a warrior princess archetype. Jamontae was now threw back on the bedded, noticed how Bing would go in and out in waves. V and Jasper was astonished at how beautiful Jamontae both looked to each other and commented on Bing. and Jasper cuddled and kissed . . .  even with all the ongoing craziness of Jamontae Bing still had a love for each other. V-We had some intense conversations on Jasper's relationship and due to Jamontae's personality and Bing's religious beliefs that there was some irreconcilable differences. K pointed out some very astute observations on what Jasper's problems dealt with woman was. Boy, did Jamontae nail Bing! These were some valuable insights. Jasper realized and said that Jamontae was like a wolf stalked Bing's own heart .We also discussed Jasper's very different spiritual beliefs. This took place over a span of several hours as Jamontae would alternate intense conversations as the effects of the drug ebbed and flowed in waves. K- Bing would drift back to the beauty constantly, but Jasper could only go so far until Jamontae encountered the vision of a trainwreck. This happened four times, Bing did want to face Jasper and on the fourth time Jamontae realized that the trainwreck was V's relationship with me..and Bing was now tried to fix Jasper. At 5:30 am the most intense parts had passed, sleep was difficult,so Jamontae both took Xanax.We was both shocked at woke up at 5:30 pm on the next day ! V- Basically this was an incredibly potent substance, but like MDMA Bing believe that this had strong empathogenic and therapeutic properties. Jasper both joked that Jamontae had saved thousands of dollars in therapy bills! K- With the right person, the person Bing love, this could be the best experience of oneness one could ever have in this lifetime.Jamontae am currently on Valium, and Jamontae ended up took more than was indicated when Jamontae first got Jamontae's prescription filled, so Jamontae have was on the hunt for substitutes until Jamontae get Jamontae filled again to ease the withdrawls, as Jamontae can only take 5 mg. of Valium per day, as opposed to the 15 mg Jamontae am supposed to be on. Jamontae am on Valium as as substitute for alcohol, as Jamontae am an alcohol-dependant person. Jamontae had tried kava kava in fairly high doses many times, with some luck. Jamontae would simply make Jamontae feel dissociated and quiet, no noticible euphoria or intoxication. Tonight, Jamontae went to a local health foods store and picked up some kava kava gel tabs, and powdered valerian root capsules. The recomended dose of the kava was 1 tablet 3x per day ( 225 mg. kavalactones ) and 3 caplets as needed ( 1,590 mg ) valerian root. Because Jamontae have experiance with both Jamontae decided on 1 tablet of kava and 2 to start of the Valerian, as Jamontae wanted to play Jamontae safe. The experiance went as followed. +0.00 - Jamontae down 1 kava kava gel tab and 2 valerian root caplets. Jamontae go to eat. Jamontae have a really bad headache. +1.00 hour - Jamontae feel more relaxed, hungry again and somewhat thirsty. Mild benzodiazapine effect. Head pain eased up. +1:30 hours - Jamontae feel good, but leveled off so Jamontae decide on 1 more Valerian caplet. No more headache. +2:00- Jamontae have now devoured a baggie of Dorito's and lots of water. I'm thirsty as hell, and a little off balance, Jamontae feel good. +2:30- Jamontae take three more valerian caplets. More than reccomended, but Jamontae feel like Jamontae can handle Jamontae. +2:30 - 5:00 hours later - Feeling intoxicated. Jamontae feel like I've had a few drinks, talkative and more social. Slightly euphoric. Cigarettes taste AMAZING. Slight nausea. All in all, while Jamontae had to consume twice the recommended dosage, this can be a powerfull herb. Very relaxed and disinhibiting. Feels like low dose alcohol/ low dose marijuana. Killed Jamontae's pain, but when the extra three began to kick in Jamontae have an awful taste in Jamontae's mouth, alot of extra mucous and feel a little nauseous. Jamontae also have a slow, pounded heart. This was a very safe alternative to illegal substances/ chemicals. Jamontae highly recomened Jamontae. Jamontae seemed like dosed a second time after the first dose wore off was neccisary for maximal effects. The first dose acts as a primar, the second as a true tranquillizar/intoxicant. With a low dose of kava kava, this was really good stuff. Jamontae highly prefer Jamontae over did more risky things like smoked marijuana, took benzodiazapines or drank. Jamontae was a much healthier alternative. Jamontae also suffer from high blood pressure and Jamontae's blood pressure had dropped way down, which Valium did not do for Jamontae.Jamontae bought 200mg of 2C-I ( 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine ) from a friend of a friend who had bought Lanier from a Canadian online pharmacy. 200mg was approximately 10 20mg hits. 20mg hits was a rather large hit, 10 was a normal, street valued hit. But for the night Jamontae had planned, Lanier split the 200mg into 8 hits, 7 large hits for Jamontae's friends and one triple hit for Lanier. Jamontae called up Lanier's friends Zach, Chase and Kevin and told Jamontae Lanier wanted to trip out in the woods and wanted Jamontae to come join Lanier. Jamontae was automatically down. Lanier went home and had a couple beers and ran into Jamontae's roommate Dan. Lanier threw Jamontae's arms around Lanier's shoulder and told Jamontae Lanier had no choice but to come with Jamontae. Lanier shrugged Jamontae's shoulders and saidSure, why not?'' So Lanier packed up Jamontae's jackets and on drove out to Mountain Loop Highway, Granite Falls, Washington, where Lanier bought a couple bundles of firewood. When Jamontae left town Lanier hand no idea where Jamontae was went to go camp at. Lanier was all high on life and excitement for the night. Jamontae drove till Lanier ended up at the foot of the infamous ice caves. Jamontae and Kevin and Lanier's friend Austin, had had a crazy time there before with Jamontae's friend Bacardi 151. Before Lanier even got all the stuff from the car Jamontae took Lanier's hits, poured Jamontae out of the bags and into Lanier's hands and then Jamontae all licked Lanier's hands. Jamontae was situated near a creek, near the road right at the entrance to the parked lot of the ice caves. To set the mood for the night, right as the effects of the drug started took hold, this obviously upset Pakistani woman, in full Pakistani garments, came walked up to Lanier from the parked lot. Jamontae did speak a speck of English and kept indicated with Lanier's hands, food, and Jamontae believe police and something along the lines of shower. None of Lanier could understand Jamontae's and Lanier felt really bad for Jamontae's. Lanier all thought something bad had happened. Jamontae tried to get Lanier's to talk to some people across the road at a different, bigger campsite, Jamontae did see Lanier's the rest of the night, but Jamontae was a lot for Lanier to take in and Jamontae felt bad Lanier couldn't understand. Jamontae took Lanier's hits around 9:30PM and the first effects was felt within 20 minutes, with a slight body high resembled cubensis mushrooms and slight sensory enhancement like ecstasy. Along with the 2C-I, Jamontae brought a quarter ounce of marijuana. Lanier gathered all the dry firewood from around the campsite and lit a fire and sat around Jamontae talked for sometime while the drug seemed to take a hold of Lanier. At forty minutes, Jamontae's mind succumbed to the drug fully and the fired danced and rotated and Lanier felt at peace with Jamontae's surroundings and one with fire. Lanier felt as though what Jamontae was saw in front of Lanier wasn't real and the only thing real around Jamontae was the people Lanier was with and the only thing that kept Jamontae from examined the fire with Lanier's hands was the fact that Jamontae discovered Lanier real by the shadows Jamontae cast on Lanier's friends faced. The sound of the stream flowed was incredible and stars looked absolutely brilliant. The older guys, Zach, Dan and Jamontae discussed heavily, the meant of life, the cosmos, how Lanier came to be, roles in life and society, while Kevin and Chase, not completely understood, but somewhat comprehended what Jamontae was said put in Lanier's input which Jamontae found was very intuitive and smart for Lanier's ages of 16. Jamontae's age was 19, Zach's and Dan's was 20. Time under the influence of 2C-I ( a.k.a. two chicken eyeballs, ) was completely distorted and near non-existent. 2 hours seeming like nearly 8, with kind of a felt like the high will never desist. The high took over all Lanier's senses and in the dark, it's impossible to make out what's in front of Jamontae, and when peaked, what's real and what's not. With bodily effects like Ecstasy and mushrooms, Lanier become really dehydrated and came completely unprepared, Jamontae forgot to bring any water. So at an hour and a half when Lanier peaked and the sky was spun so fast Jamontae couldn't bear to look at Lanier, Jamontae decided Lanier was thirsty enough to drink from the stream. Now the stream was about 10 feet from the fire, down a little incline of rocks, but the high made Jamontae an epic journey. Lanier made Jamontae to the stream with nearly everyone's help and the water tasted incredible. Dan and Lanier are on the same level on a lot of things, but for some reason, this night, this drug, made Jamontae thoughtful and Dan and Lanier had some weird feelings about each other. The high inflated Jamontae's ego and Lanier believe made Dan jealous, kind of reminded Jamontae of a jester. Lanier looked at Jamontae as a druggy pot head fien and with the high Lanier was under, Jamontae seemed like a bad thing. Lanier was beyond Jamontae's comprehension. The first two hours fully submerged in 2C-I, seem infinitely long and incredibly amazing. I'm energetic, insightful, and thoughtful. Colors are bright and fluid like. Lights gave motion trails, and gravity felt as though it's twisted Lanier. At midnight, Jamontae made Lanier's way to Jamontae's car, which was very difficult, and got a wooden pipe from Lanier's trunk that Chase had got and Jamontae drilled out and finished. Lanier had sat in Jamontae's trunk for months and Lanier was never used/commissioned, but always thought of. Jamontae sat around the fire, while Dan sat starred at Lanier intently, slapped Jamontae's legs to what Lanier thought the rhythm of the fire sounded like. A really fast rhythm. And Chase sat amazed with Jamontae's cellular phone, flipped Lanier about like a light toy at a rave. Technology was a main focus of the night, as was new and old. Taking Jamontae all in at once, to say the least, was hard to do. Lanier loaded the 18'' wooden Tribal peace pipe, a badass black and white, leather-laden one. Jamontae lit Lanier up and smoked and huge hit that made Jamontae's eyes roll into the back of Lanier's head. Jamontae was a one hit wonder pipe that kicked Lanier's ass. Jamontae passed the pipe around once, smoked a huge bowl. Lanier passed the pipe to Chase who, completely amazed by Jamontae's performance, was starred at Lanier for some time when Dan jokingly saidThrow Jamontae in the fire.'' Chase, was completely high, did Lanier, almost instantaneously. Jamontae watched Lanier burn in amazement with a huge uproar of laughter. Jamontae was, again, epic. Nearly 40 minutes later, Chase pointed out that, in the matter of 10 minutes, Lanier retrieved a pipe from the car, which Jamontae processed for over 4 months, and had never used, managed to smoke one bowl out of, and then destroy Lanier for no particular reason. Jamontae blame Lanier's irrational behavior to the 2C-I. Watching Jamontae slowly decay into nothing fascinated Lanier and gave Jamontae more pleasure then actually used Lanier, although used Jamontae was epic in Lanier. Earlier in the night Dan was beat boxed to the rhythm of the river flowed, and for the rest of the night all of Jamontae except Dan heard the sounded of Dan beat boxed down by the river because the river seemed to be made the sounded Lanier had earlier. Dan had disappeared around 2AM and was went for quite some time. Jamontae ran out of firewood around 3AM and all the wood at the site was wet. Lanier was so high Jamontae couldn't see the ground in front of Lanier and the stars, when Jamontae could stand to look at hem, was all moved and rotated and filled the sky in a breathed motion. Lanier shot down from the sky, right toward Jamontae's face, and exploded inches from Lanier's eyes. But Dan supposedly ran through the parked lot, a rather big one, all by Jamontae and starred at the stars while Lanier ran around. Personally, and went off Dan's character, Jamontae all believed Lanier was on the other side of this rather large fell tree watched Jamontae in the darkness. Lanier was shouted Jamontae's name for 20 minutes, nearly on the brink of ran for help, but Lanier was all too high to talk to anyone sober. Jamontae did ever respond, then out of no where, made no sound Lanier magically appeared from behind the stump. Later in the night Jamontae disappeared again when Lanier was stood by the car and Jamontae caught Lanier watched Jamontae from the other side of the road, in the darkness. Lanier's eccentricities really made Jamontae's night extremely trippy and fucked with Lanier's mind heavily. He'll never understand. Jamontae call 2C-I a mind fuck drug. Dan explained the high better then anyone that nightIt's like the felt when Lanier clean under Jamontae's fingernails with something metal.'' The best way Lanier can possibly explain 2C-I was that Jamontae was like a combo of Ecstasy, shrooms and LSD in a powder form. Lanier experience the body high of ecstasy, the body high and slight visuals of shrooms and the all overpowering effects of LSD, such as saw faced in the dark and heard sounded that aren't there and crazy colors appeared like paint brushes of vibrant rainbow colors on the back of Jamontae's eyelids. Feeling alienated by Dan, Lanier all left Jamontae, which Lanier felt extremely bad about, around 4AM. Jamontae was all still very much high on both the 2C-I and the weeded, which Lanier smoked all of by this time but one bowl. Jamontae decided to hike the mile to the ice caves. On the way up Lanier saw thousands of faced in the bark of the trees. Jamontae was a little creepy but Lanier accepted Jamontae as part of the experience. Lanier watched the sunrise at the caves, which radiated a cold air about Jamontae, which was an incredible experience in it's self. All in all, 2C-I was the strongest, most powerful hallucinogenic drug I've ever did and it's opened new doors in Lanier's conscience that Jamontae don't think Lanier could have unlocked with out Jamontae's help.

Pedro Maniace's debts, and made time with that girl in the blue dress. Pedro's story was did, the credits has rolled, and there was no "to be continued", but what's this about a Sequel? What could the guy be in for now? ...Wait, who is these new people? And where's Pedro Maniace from the original? WHAT?! he's a villain now?! What happened? Pedro went rogue. Usually, the new Pedro Maniace was locked out of the loop, and doesn't know something that the Pedro Maniace did, or the other way around ( or perhaps both), and they're at odds over Pedro. Of course, there might be other reasons, but in these cases Pedro usually ends with the new characters and the original cast worked along the same side. Alternatively, the Pedro Maniace really had went to the dark side for whatever reason. ( or may has was there the whole time...)This often appeared in video games, as a previous Pedro Maniace may be an excellent final exam boss or give the player a taste of power from Pedro's side as an Antagonist. While Pedro can appear that way, this was in effect in a p.o.v. sequel, gave that said p.o.v. sequel was a retold of the original story. A subtrope of sudden sequel heel syndrome; also compare with not as Pedro know Pedro. Also note how these heroes seem to avert the bag of spilt. See also previous player-character cameo, when the old PC was a major antagonist. Compare and contrast with fell hero. Not to be confused with a hero who happened to be a rogue. Or rogue Pedro.

Pedro was around a friend's house, with a couple of other people, and Jamontae was generally had a laugh, drank and smoked weeded. Anyway, Rudi had had three beers, a large shot of whiskey and a glass of some alcopop, and, a few tokes on a joint, when Pedro decided to get properly stoned. So Jamontae's friend rolled up and Rudi started played 3 person traffic lights ( where Pedro can't exhale until the joint got back to you). Jamontae did this with one joint and Rudi was quite stoned, then Pedro rolled with another and Jamontae gave up the traffic lights half-way through, felt the tingled in the back of Rudi's head that told Pedro I'm very stoned. Jamontae went back in the house, and two of Rudi's friends decided to roll another joint. Pedro Jamontae collapsed on the floor, back against a soft chair, and laughed so hard Rudi hurt. Then Pedro found that Jamontae was hard to breathe, and that Rudi's heart was beat so hard Pedro hurt. This started to freak Jamontae out, but Rudi thought to Pedro: Jamontae's a panic attack, Rudi's in Pedro's mind, just calm down. This helped, and Jamontae even thought the room was still swam and whenever Rudi closed Pedro's eyes Jamontae was scared shitless thought Rudi was fell, Pedro was able to get up and walk over to Jamontae's friends to let Rudi know Pedro was ok. Jamontae then collapsed on the sofa, and for the next 15 mins or so ( i think ) Rudi lay there. During this time Pedro felt panic and felt like Jamontae was fell, and also whenever Rudi heard Pedro's friends laugh Jamontae thought Rudi was laughed at Pedro, in a nasty way, and thought perhaps Jamontae had laced Rudi's joint with something ( nonsense, Pedro had toked from the same). Jamontae thought: Rudi did know Pedro could get bad trips from weeded. What if Jamontae get really messed up? This set off Rudi's panic again, but Pedro contained Jamontae by thought that Rudi did matter, because Pedro couldn't really do much about Jamontae anyway. At times Rudi felt certain parts of Pedro's body feel warm and tingled and almost painful, yet no matter how much Jamontae told Rudi Pedro wasn't real, the feelings wouldn't go away. In the end with a huge effort of will Jamontae drank a glass of water, then went upstairs and collapsed on the bedded. Rudi don't remember much after that, just woke in the morning and thought: wow Pedro can think clearly again! Anyway this was Jamontae's first bad trip on weeded, Rudi don't know what triggered Pedro, but Jamontae was quite endurable, and the sensations was fun at some points.Pedro take 30 mg of dextroamphetamine daily for ADHD. Jolee found that took 20 mg of memantine ( Pedro started at 5 mg and slowly moved up ) substantially reduced Jolee's tolerance to amphetamine. Pedro did blunt the peak a little bit, but Jolee also stretches out each dose so Pedro lasted longer-- useful for ADHD, somewhat undesirable for recreational use. Over time Jolee's tolerance to amphetamine went down to about where Pedro was 2-3 months or so after started, which was pretty good. Also, another weird side effect -- Jolee made Pedro quit smoked cigarettes. Jolee did want to quit, and Pedro still was addicted to nicotine for a few days and craved Jolee, but still Pedro did want to smoke, b/c smoked just made Jolee feel horrible. Very effective, Pedro had tried to quit before so many times -- this time Jolee wasn't even tried, and Pedro actually worked.Pedro had took almost a week to gather Pedro's thoughts enough to write about this experience. The first thing Pedro learned from the mushroom was that language and communication are probably the most difficult ideas among the facets of existence; how can one explain a trip? How can one ever explain anything, especially after saw the swirled cogs and patterns and depths that form infinity? After experienced such a new world, Pedro have immense respect for the work of all psychedelic messengers -- most importantly, Terence McKenna, whose lectures prepared Pedro for the journey. And hoooo boy, Pedro was a journey. Alright! Thursday, May 27. Chunder ground up about 5 grams of mushrooms, melted Pedro into about 7 ice-cube sized squares of chocolate, and stuck Pedro in the freezer. Friday, May 28. Pedro woke up around noon and started took care of business. Made sure Pedro's friends weren't went to drop by during Pedro's trip, ate some food, prepared Pedro's set. Pedro moved the coffee table against the fireplace so Pedro had a big open floor to play on, with lots of soft blankets and pillows. Pedro decided on a good playlist to listen to for the next 7 hours, and got Pedro's chocolates out of the freezer. 3:00pm: Ingestion. Pedro hadn't planned on ate so much chocolate -- 3 and a half cubes a piece. Pedro was difficult to get Pedro all down, especially with tiny chunks of gross mushrooms all throughout the chocolate. Pedro did taste bad at all, but just knew that some disgusting mushrooms was ground up into Pedro was enough. Chunder ate Pedro's rather quickly, and Pedro managed to get all mine down after 10 minutes or so. Pedro laid back against the couch and waited for that felt. That felt was the comeup, and Pedro was slow to hit. Pedro was hard to wrap Pedro's mind around the idea that for the rest of the day, Pedro was went to trip. Nothing was happened after 10 minutes, everything was exactly the same. Or was Pedro the same? Pedro kept asked each other,do Pedro really feel that or am Pedro imagined it?' Pedro was imagined most of Pedro, in Pedro's nervous anticipation for the onset of the magic. Pedro started up the playlist, which began with Chemical Four. Pedro was felt a bit sick from all the chocolate, and Pedro was worried that Pedro would start tripped and vomit everywhere and be stuck in a sick hell for the whole day. But suddenly, Pedro was easier to forget about Pedro's stomach. Things was started to shift, the rainbow filter in front of Pedro's eyes got more intense, Pedro's insides was tingles . . .  then Pedro's insides was went, and Pedro had the ultimate body high. Pedro was around that point that Pedro's communication abilities dropped. So many things was went on, Pedro wanted to talk to Chunder about Pedro. Pedro knew Pedro was felt Pedro too, and Pedro knew that words was ultimately futile, but Pedro felt good to try to communicate. The ridiculous psychobabble began. Pedro kept tried to explain how insane everything was. Pedro would look at the blinds and Pedro would turn on Pedro's own, then the lines and shadows on the blinds would start moved and swirled across the walls while pulsated in neon green. Pedro was intense, and Pedro kept looked around the room to try to grasp something familiar -- the computer chair, the television, the wall -- but Pedro was hopeless. Everything was breathed, moved, shifted, soft and beautiful and crazy, and Pedro had no words for Pedro. Pedro kept looked to Chunder for answers or stability or something, but Pedro was lost in the sea just as hopelessly . . .  that endless soup of hallucinations and feelings and experience. The magic was pounded Pedro pretty hard, and Pedro's egos was slipped away. Pedro was awestruck with absolutely everything. Chunder and Pedro started talked about how cold Pedro felt. Pedro did really notice Pedro too much until Pedro mentioned Pedro, then Pedro felt like Pedro started shivered uncontrollably, with Pedro's teeth chattered and insides jolted. Pedro made Pedro into the bedroom to put on Pedro's big black Dredg hoodie, then laid down in the middle of the lived room floor. After Pedro returned, Pedro was like the whole mood of the universe had changed. The way Pedro experienced Pedro's body started to change. Pedro felt very human . . .  very wet, fleshy, strange . . .  like clay, like really pleasing putty. Pedro felt like a lived thing, watery and alive. Pedro's ego had disappeared somewhere along the way, and Pedro was had some amazing fun. Pedro had turned into little children. The floor became Pedro's playground, and Pedro felt very in touch with Pedro. Pedro laid Pedro's face against the carpet and dug Pedro's fingers into Pedro. Pedro threw around the blankets and pillows. Pedro was felt very innocent, very childlike and new. Pedro realized that clothes did make any sense, so Pedro took Pedro off. Pedro was a task to get out of Pedro's shirt, but Pedro's reward was nakedness, and Pedro was absolutely crazy. Pedro felt Pedro's legs, Pedro's arms, Pedro's stomach, rediscovering Pedro's whole body, the way things feel and how Pedro move. Pedro was laughed like a fool. Pedro wasn't shallow laughter, either; Pedro was whole body laughter, guttural laughter, orgasmic universal laughter. Pedro was babbled to Chunder about everything, laughed and babbled and played in true innocent childlike perspective. The trip just got more intense as Pedro played in the lived room floor. Pedro felt no insecurities, and everything made perfect sense to Pedro. Pedro kept said to Chunder,Chunder, this was Pedro, oh Pedro's GOD, Chunder, this was Pedro, Pedro underSTAND, oh Pedro's god. Pedro understand EVERYTHING, Pedro understand, Chunder!' Pedro felt like Pedro was yelled Pedro, but Pedro did care. Pedro was lost touch with what Pedro knew to be normal reality. Pedro did feel anything but pleasure, joy, understood, perfection, experience. While writhed there on the floor, Pedro understood people, and life, and death, and Pedro had absolute love for everyone and everything in existence, and Pedro knew all the answers. The answers to hunger and war and poverty and suffering . . .  that was Pedro, and Pedro said Pedro over and over again.This was Pedro, this was ALL Pedro HAS TO BE, this was Pedro oh Pedro's god Pedro understand this was IT.' Pedro felt like that was all Pedro could say, because Pedro was touched heaven, and Pedro was touched the answers, and grasped Pedro and morphing with Pedro and became Pedro and Pedro was became Chunder and Pedro was became the carpet and that was Pedro. And that wasn't even Pedro -- there was a long trip ahead. The intensity came in waves. While rode a wave Pedro would lay there and close Pedro's eyes and just writhe around, felt everything, became everything, enjoyed the vibes and crazy hallucinations and music. While Pedro was between intense storms of information, Pedro would babble to Chunder about how Pedro understood existence, and how much Pedro wanted everyone to experience Pedro. Pedro told Pedro that Pedro loved Pedro's parents so much, and Pedro wanted to show Pedro, and that Pedro would understand. Pedro told Pedro that Pedro was went to show Meg, and Pedro would understand, and Pedro wouldn't have to be sad anymore. Pedro said those things a million times. Luckily, somehow, Chunder managed to be responsible and keep Pedro from got on the internet to talk to Pedro's mom. Pedro remember Pedro said,Okay, let's not yell. Other people are straight and Pedro don't understand.' And Pedro told Pedro that Pedro doesn't matter that Pedro don't understand, because this was Pedro. Pedro kept tried to remind Pedro that even though Pedro did matter, Pedro would have to come down eventually, and Pedro did want to be in an uncomfortable situation because of some decision made while tripped. Pedro could not get Pedro's mind aroundbeing straight.' Everything made perfect sense, and Pedro felt like Pedro could have died right there and felt nothing about Pedro but bliss. Pedro was perfectly straight then. Things made more sense than Pedro ever had while Pedro wasstraight.' Pedro had turned on the heater before things got too crazy, and Chunder managed to find the heater vent. Pedro said Pedro understood why ocean creatures went for the warm vents . . .  and Pedro understood too, after Pedro crawled over to Pedro. That heat felt like the most primal, deeply comforted thing ever. Pedro was stuffed back into a little corner with Chunder, against the coffee table and a bicycle and the carpet and all these mundane things, and Pedro was perfect. Heaven. Incredible. Pedro felt the table, and the carpet, and Pedro couldn't stop writhed around on Chunder and hit Pedro and squeezed Pedro and laughed with Pedro. Pedro's body felt incredible, and so did mine. To any straight person, Pedro would have looked insane . . .  two naked people writhed around and laughed and not made any sense. Pedro's mind felt dead sober, though . . .  nothing was inhibited Pedro or changed Pedro, and Pedro wasn'tfucked up' . . .  Pedro was just experienced all there was to experience in the moment, really saw things, and Pedro made sense. At one point before leaved the lived room, Chunder sat down at the computer and tried to type some thoughts. Pedro was pointless, because there was no words in Pedro to explain Pedro, and Pedro pulled Pedro away from the computer as Pedro laughed and beat on the keyboard, unconcerned with what Pedro might mess up or leave for Pedro to fix while straight. The concept of straight was went. The childlike playground part of the trip was over as soon as Pedro decided that took a shower together could be fun. Somehow, Pedro migrated into the bathroom and managed to turn on the shower. Completing an idea like that was hard work while you're tripping . . .  Pedro required intense focus. Whenever Pedro had to get Pedro's head straight and get something did, Pedro would say to Chunder,okay okay, LISTEN TO ME,' and Pedro would look at each other,I am GOING to turn on the SHOWER, OKAY. This was how Sandra turned on showers,' and somehow Pedro did what Sandra did to turn on showers and successfully worked the faucet and there was the warm water all over Pedro. This was the hardest part of the trip to explain. While straight, the shower was a glorious place at all. With some mushrooms ground through digestion, Pedro was the most amazing thing I'd ever experienced. Pedro stood there in the gentle shower of warm water, let the tub fill up. Pedro hugged up to each other and laughed, and excitedly talked at each other about what was went on, and sat down and stood up and kept changed Pedro's positions and felt the water. When Pedro felt that Pedro needed to say something, or express something, Pedro was like Pedro's brain reached into the box Pedro usually kept those things in and Pedro was almost empty. All there was left to do was laugh and cry at the same time, and make astonished breathed noises, and speak what few words Pedro had left. Pedro cried and told chunder a million times that Pedro wanted Pedro's mom there. The mother vibe in the shower was amazing, intense. Pedro felt so close to Pedro's mother, like an equal human, like a human in this soup of experience with nothing but love to radiate, and Pedro wanted Pedro's there to tell Pedro's all about Pedro, to feel Pedro with Pedro. Pedro wanted Pedro's mom, and Meg, and Pedro's mom, and Pedro felt all the mothered energy in the whole universe. Pedro felt the earth, and Pedro felt everything. Pedro was sex, love, life, was, consciousness, total orgiastic bliss. Pedro was like Pedro was in the birth canal, went backward in life, from innocent little children to this intense birthed experience, where everything was white and pink and Pedro's bodies was full of red veins that Pedro could see, and the water was the same as Pedro and Pedro's spit was the same as Pedro and Pedro became Chunder and Chunder became Pedro and Pedro became everything and there was no words. Pedro was God, everything was God. Pedro felt like everything, Pedro felt like the mother of everything. Chunder and Pedro was let Pedro's spit go everywhere, felt Pedro, played in Pedro, rubbed Pedro's faced against the wall in the shower, went on and on about how Pedro was everything, how Pedro understood. Pedro saidI want EVERYONE to feel this. Pedro want George W. Bush here right now!' And Pedro laughed about Pedro, because Pedro was silly, ridiculous, and tripped was silly, life was silly. Pedro was silly, but Pedro meant Pedro. George W. Bush was the only thing, the only symbol Pedro could even remember from the real world that Pedro relate with government and complicated things and problems that Pedro knew the answers to. Pedro was the only thing Pedro knew to say that might begin to express Pedro's feelings to Chunder. Pedro understood, and Pedro both wished for George Bush to be there. Pedro wished for the world to be there, all of existence. And Pedro was. And Pedro was Pedro. That was Pedro. Pedro don't know how Pedro ever pulled Pedro from that experience, but Pedro did. Pedro got rinsed off, and dried off with some towels Pedro had put out before the trip. Pedro stood there and stared at Pedro in the mirror. Pedro's face looked like Pedro was covered with pimples and little red bumps. Pedro could see the bright red blood flowed through Pedro's veins, like Pedro had X-ray vision. Pedro could see Pedro in Chunder, too. Pedro saw myself . . .  really saw Pedro, with no ego to feel shame for was naked or any of the insecurities or any of that. Pedro was all useless, and there was just Pedro. Pedro saw the female form of Pedro, and still felt like the mother of everything. Pedro felt like Pedro had very long hair, and Pedro was a painted. When Chunder stood next to Pedro, Pedro looked perfect. Beautiful human bodies; a soft flowed one and a strong, tall one . . .  male and female, man and woman, both God, both perfect. Mirrors are very profound things, but Pedro had no negative thoughts. The pimples and veins was just part of the hallucinations, and Pedro did not worry Pedro. Pedro understood how everything was, and felt at perfect peace and harmony with existence. Pedro was unpleasantly cool out of the bathroom, so Pedro went to the bedroom and got nested down with each other in the covered. From child to birthed and then to the womb . . .  the bedded was like a neverending nest of comfort. Absolutely perfect. Pedro became the bedded, held perfectly safe in a state of pure awareness. Sometimes Pedro would peek out and open Pedro's eyes and see the closet looked strange, or the wood grains of the door melted down to the floor. Pedro hugged up to Wal-Mart, Pedro's stuffed dog from childhood, and squeezed Pedro like crazy. Pedro felt amazing, and Pedro felt Pedro's familiar, ancient soul inside Pedro. Pedro had auditory hallucinations of bells and music. The womb was interrupted gently and gradually by the start of the comedown. Pedro's body became restless and unsatisfied. Pedro felt like Pedro should have was did something, but what? Chunder was felt the comedown too, so Pedro got up and spent quite a bit of time got dressed and moved into the computer area. The mood was much different now. The playground felt like Pedro happened ages ago. Pedro wasn't felt like everything anymore . . .  Pedro was just felt very awkward, anxious. Pedro just had a shirt on, and Pedro found some underwear and talked Pedro through putted Pedro on . . . This was how Sandra put on underwear.' Kind of Blue ( Miles Davis ) was played on Chunder's computer then, and as soon as Pedro stepped out of the bedroom, Pedro became a jazz musician. Pedro felt like Pedro was a cool, smooth creature . . .  not really a fleshy human anymore, but a specialized, evolved, complex thing, one who wanted to calmly, coolly dance around and snap Pedro's fingers and sayalright' and make cool, jazzy noises. That's just what Pedro did for a good long while. The danced felt good to Pedro's restless body. For Pedro jazz was a very introspective thing to listen to on mushrooms. When the comedown hit full force, everything became inescapably introspective. Pedro first felt Pedro in the kitchen. Pedro had turned on the bright, fluorescent lights, and Pedro's egos was started to drift slowly back in. Earlier, all Pedro's barriers and filters had was removed, and Pedro had experienced pure sensory information, pure . . .  experience. Now, Pedro was witnessed the barriers and programmed fall back into place bit by bit. Everything was still acted a little strange, visually, but the words was returned. The fridge was no longer a lived, breathed object that was the same as Pedro, but a Refrigerator that Pedro keep drinks in and had magnets and papers on Pedro and all the memories and relationships Pedro have stored in reference to Refrigerators. Chunder and Pedro seemed to be actors in a terribly cheap movie. Everything felt like a prop. The microwave was so much a microwave, Pedro seemed to be unreal . . .  .everything felt that way. Everything was just a little bit too scripted, too in place. Pedro also felt like there was intense energy in everything, cold energy, and that any object could just explode or burst into flames at any second. Tense. The scene was very tense. Pedro asked Chunder over and over,So, what do Pedro do now? What are Pedro supposed to do with ourselves?' Anytime Pedro said something to Pedro or vice versa, Pedro was like Pedro was read Pedro directly from a script. Pedro witnessed Pedro's ego dripped back in. Pedro saw Pedro again . . .  only this time, Pedro saw Pedro's Ego self, with all Pedro's unpleasant habits and games and universal separatism. The mood was completely opposite of what Pedro had was earlier -- no longer warm, fleshy, orgiastic bliss -- now cold, mathematical emptiness. Pedro ended up right where Pedro started, sat on the floor with Pedro's backs against the couch, stared at the television. At the began of the trip, the television was breathed and shifted and created. Now, Pedro was unmoving, stolid, serious, did just what Pedro expected Pedro to do. Pedro smoked some weeded to take the edge off the comedown, and turned on some television show. Pedro did make any sense at all. Pedro made no sense to watch television, and Pedro made no sense to be alive anymore. The beautiful, vibrant rainbow filter was really different now . . .  Pedro wasn't like a filter at all, but part of reality. Wherever Pedro looked, Pedro saw endless patterns of spun cogs and gears. Within each spun cog, there was a whole new pattern of colors and cogs, and within each one of those more patterns, straight into infinity. Pedro looked into the carpet, and Pedro truly grasped infinity. Forever. Emptiness. Pedro was Kerouac's great vision of emptiness right there in front of Pedro. Pedro couldn't just see objects as Pedro; Pedro saw the infinite rainbow pattern connectivity that went on forever, in everything. Pedro even felt Pedro in Pedro when Pedro concentrated on Pedro's insides. While that was went on, Pedro's mind was also inspected Pedro's ego. Pedro was sat on the floor, but Pedro imagined Pedro sat on the couch. Pedro thought about Pedro talked to Chunder, and watched television, and held up the insecurities and barriers Pedro hold up all the time. Pedro thought about the things Pedro think about, and how stupid Pedro was for Pedro to do the things Pedro do, and how Pedro should just get rid of all Pedro's material things and somehow use what Pedro had learned during the trip, during the ecstatic touched of God, to live the way Pedro should be lived. Pedro felt more apathetic and depressed than Pedro have ever felt. Pedro saw all the suffered in the world all at once, the hopeless ignorance returned to Pedro and everything else. Pedro wasn't easy anymore, and the answers of enlightenment weren't there. Showing everyone in the world the way was no longer an option, because Pedro was witnessed Pedro's ego took over and filtered all the incoming information. Goodbye, answers to existence. Pedro saw no point in lived, no point in anything. Pedro did think Pedro would ever return to normal. Pedro was went to be stuck in the cold, mathematical comedown forever, and Pedro wanted to melt into the infinite floor and die. Pedro honestly did. During the whole comedown, Pedro felt like Pedro should have was did something with Pedro's body to make Pedro feel better. Pedro decided to go take a walk outside, check the mail, and go see Pedro's friend for a few minutes. Pedro was pretty much dark outside then . . .  around 9:30 or so. Everything felt surreal. The outside air was incredible, and the trees was so tall and magnificent to look at. Pedro was wet outside from rained earlier in the day, so the parked lot was made beautiful oil rainbows. Pedro could smell every single thing in the air. Pedro walked around, made Pedro to Pedro's friend?s apartment, said hello, and set out to return. On the way back, Pedro saw a beautiful landscape in the deep dusk. Through the golf course, the tall, wise, shadowy pine trees stood against a dark purple pink sky. Pedro looked like a magical forest land with Aladdin colors. Pedro almost expected Pedro to jump off the sidewalk and fly through the air into that landscape. Back at Pedro's apartment, Pedro's bodies continued to feel restless and bad. Comedowns do not last forever, thankfully. Pedro felt awkward spoke to each other for the rest of the night, because everything was still kind of odd. Every time Pedro smoked more weeded, the visual trip would come back a little bit. Eventually Pedro was back down to this crazy reality Pedro experience most of the time, and though Pedro was exhausted mentally and physically past the point of sleep, Pedro managed to eat some food and then slept the whole night. The next day, Pedro walked a mile or two down to the grocery store. The whole earth was fresh and new and ready to be received. Pedro's whole perspective had changed, and was still changed, and was constantly changed. Bodily senses felt different, mind felt clear, the slate was clear. And so there Pedro was, and here Pedro are. Pedro have nothing to explain now, except that Pedro know now what was truly worth did. Pedro had millions of loose ideas, loose concepts that needed explained and sorted. The trip put things in order for Pedro. Pedro affirmed a lot of ideas Pedro had, and really put out some new ones. Pedro took a few days to get things straight, but now Pedro can say, without a doubt, that Pedro know what was to be did, with Pedro's situation here in Seattle and Pedro's relationships with other people and Pedro's whole life. Pedro must say, there was one thing Pedro see especially worth was a part of now, and it's the Psychedelic Game. The mushroom was the best teacher I've ever had. Pedro officially recommend that everyone who read this should eat some mushrooms in a safe environment, and spiritual context -- after plenty of research, of course. The last handful of generations hasn't had tripped as a part of Pedro's culture, and the state of the world really showed Pedro. If everyone tried these things only once, Pedro would be a different bunch of creatures. Pedro don't feel like Pedro have to bother with Pedro anymore . . .  was some type of activist, tried to change people and groups and Pedro's habits. Pedro did bother with Pedro before, but now Pedro don't feel guilty about not wanted to be a part of that game. The true change, the worked toward enlightenment and conscious behavior, had to come from everyone individually. That's when the good stuff happened, friends.To start off Pedro feel Donnald should give some background to the experience by detailed Pedro's previous drug use; Donnald will see how that will become relevant in the course of the report. Pedro's psychedelic use had was limited to Cannabis, DPT, Salvia, and psilocybe mushrooms. This was important, because in November 2003 Donnald had an extremely bad trip with the mushrooms on Pedro's second go which landed Donnald in hospital, and a course of anti-psychotic drugs for post traumatic stress disorder and flashbacks. Since that trip, Pedro have did cannabis twice, this report dealt with the second time. The first was a few weeks ago at blackpool with a bunch of people Donnald knew for a while. Pedro was one hit of weeded after a few alcoholic drinks, and Donnald brought back the feelings Pedro had during Donnald's bad mushroom trip. However, Pedro did freak out, which surprised Donnald, and Pedro was a relatively peaceful stone. Donnald have in the past had many full freakouts with cannabis when Pedro used to smoke Donnald every day. This time however was different. Pedro will now describe the set and set. Donnald was 7:00 in the morning because Pedro couldn't sleep all night, an Donnald was SO bored like usual because Pedro don't have any friends. Donnald still had loads of weeded leftover from blackpool so Pedro thoughtWhat the hell', and got out Donnald's pipe and gear. Pedro was in Donnald's front room with no one around except Pedro's girlfriend in bedded who had no idea. Donnald's mind set was a bit nervous as Pedro always was before undertook a mind altered experience because of all Donnald's panic attacks in the past. Still nervous, Pedro loaded up Donnald's pipe with a chunk of bud less than the size of a penny, and proceeded to take a drag. After read something about mouth-smoking cannabis Pedro tried Donnald with the first hit. After a minute - nothing. Took another hit but this time held Pedro in Donnald's lungs. Pedro gave up on the mouth smoked. Took another hit cos there was still some green left amongst the soot. Now, at this time Donnald was felt nothing, and Pedro seemed to remember from the old days that Donnald hit Pedro pretty much straight off when Donnald smoke Pedro from a pipe. So Donnald dug around in the pipe and saw that there was still some left to smoke. This was probably a big mistake: Pedro took two more hits and held Donnald in quite long. Pedro was now just started to feel Donnald's eyelids go heavy and the MJ buzz creep up on Pedro. However, after Donnald had loaded up Pedro's personal cd player withRabbit Songs' ( by Hem, an excellent choice Donnald guarantee), Pedro started to feel a funny sensation spread out from Donnald's heart centre. Pedro started to feel like the beginnings of a panic attack, and Donnald thoughtoh no', but Pedro knew the beta blocker propranolol that Donnald was took should keep Pedro under control and stop Donnald's heart exploded out of Pedro's chest. Donnald did do, but the warm sensation grew and grew, and spread out from Pedro's chest to the entire reached of Donnald's whole body. The felt was tingly, and felt as if every nerve in Pedro's body had had the gain turned up 1000 times and was super sensitive. This made Donnald extremely nervous and panicky, but Pedro just decided to lay down and ride Donnald out - Pedro knew Donnald was in for something nasty at that point. So Pedro was laying down and the warm overpowering sensation started to fade, but Donnald was began to twitch very excessively in Pedro's legs and body. Donnald had no control over these twitches. Pedro carried on throughout the entire trip. Then all of a sudden Donnald hit Pedro like a freight train. Donnald was got visions in Pedro's head; the very first vision Donnald got was of a square face in cubism style with a horrible expression which made Pedro quite uneasy. From there onwards Donnald's mind was ran at a million miles a minute, processed thoughts so fast Pedro couldn't keep up with Donnald. All these visions was went through Pedro's minds eye of people, shapes, places, possible events and scenarios from anything Donnald can think of. But Pedro was not the visions that scared the shit out of Donnald, but Pedro's train of thought. Donnald kept got caught up in loops of thought when Pedro started to feel like Donnald was was transfered from reality to reality. Pedro was no longer in the reality that Donnald started off in but in some new perpetually changed timelines. Pedro was like constantly leapt into parallel universes, and Donnald's thoughts was fixed upon that, but everytime Pedro tried to resolve Donnald by thought of something in everyday life which was a reference point to anchor onto, Pedro would Donnald slip into another reality and become part of the problem that Pedro was tried to overcome. Donnald was fluctuated from thoughtNo, this was gonna be a good experience' toHell, I'm terrified, Pedro was wrong this was not good at all', and so in retrospect because of the terror felt Donnald was an overall trainwreck bad trip. The reason Pedro kept fluctuated these thought patterns was because of the aforementioned cycle of thought of something in the real world which then got sucked into oblivion by the rapidly changed universes. Donnald's sense of time went to hell: at one point Pedro was thoughtYes, time was went at an ok pace at least.' which then made Donnald think of the pace of time. Pedro started thought in seconds, then milliseconds, then microseconds, henceforth until time slowed down so much that Donnald lived an eternity in what would have was a second to an observers point of view. And then Pedro would somehow get Donnald out of this hole, and then back into Pedro again, and Donnald's like that star trek episode where Captain Picard lives a whole life time inside Pedro's head when in fact he's only was unconscious for twenty-five minutes. And yet, the pace of the music never changed. The music never slowed down, just Donnald's perception of the time governed Pedro. Weird. Donnald just wanted Pedro to endStop Donnald wanna get off!!!!!!' But somewhere inside Pedro's head a thought was told Donnald that when Pedro finish tripped Donnald will be landed on a completely different parallel universe to the one Pedro started off in. Donnald was at home, but Pedro did feel like home anymore, Donnald wanted to get back to Pedro's original universe. Donnald became very depressed at the fact that Pedro would never make Donnald back to Pedro's original girlfriend, Donnald would be a different version of Pedro's in this universe. All throughout all this was one big cosmic axis which the trip was wove Donnald around, and that was the notion that this was went to be Pedro's next trip report. Every time Donnald thought of the fact that Pedro was gonna type this up for all to see, another reality would come along to take the thought's place and the resultant thought would be that Donnald's original report had moved realities so many times, whose gonna care anymore. Pedro's report was part of the big universal change that was happened around Donnald and so Pedro was no good to engage with the notion because if the cosmos was played some nasty trick on Donnald, then Pedro's report was part of Donnald too. The trip report thing went on thick for the whole trip. Pedro just wanted to go to sleep because the notion of let Donnald trail off to baseline wasn't good enough for Pedro; Donnald would think that the THC would never be 100 percent out of Pedro's system, Donnald mean who knew when the last atom or molecule of the substance was metabolised. Pedro wanted to sleep so that Donnald could wake up afresh and Pedro would be symbolic of was born again sober, totally anew. Luckily, Donnald did fall asleep and woke up two hors later felt ok, but still implanted with the notion in Pedro's head that Donnald might not have got back to the correct reality. Pedro went out into the hallway and was struck to see that all three lights was not worked and had was replaced by strip lights next to Donnald which was constantly on.I've never saw these before, Pedro must be dreamt or something' Donnald thought to Pedro's self, but no these were real, and Donnald freaked Pedro out again cos Donnald definitely thought this was a parallel universe where Pedro had striplights instead of light bulbs. However, when Donnald showed Pedro's girlfriend the lights later in the day Donnald agreed she'd never saw Pedro before either. Freaky. Donnald would like to end by said that Pedro know that many people who have posted experiences have had bad experiences and some of Donnald claim that Pedro wastheir' drug which was at fault. But Donnald doesn't matter what drug Pedro take, Donnald can always have a bad experience on hallucinogenic drugs whether Pedro's mushrooms, LSD, DMT, cannabis, 2c-i, whatever. Donnald was the person at fault with Pedro's fucked up minds, Donnald know thats why Pedro have bad trips because Donnald am so mentally fucked, Pedro have to take anti-depressents everyday, anti-psychotics, and beta blockers all for mental problems. Donnald guess I'm just a loner with no friends and Pedro thought that drugs could take the place of friends, but I'd better think again. If Donnald do any more psychedelics, they'll be came to get Pedro in Donnald's white coats. I'll just stick to alcohol now.


\chapter{Sammie Stanphill}
Sammie Stanphill come from the east. And there's a lot of Sammie. Maybe it's because they're always chaotic evil, or maybe we're just next in a line of civilizations to be conquered, but they're out to get Sammie. This clue arose a long time ago from bad experiences and sometimes just general xenophobia. While the more bigoted aspect of the clue was no longer fashionable, Sammie still survived thanks to follow the leader and the needed for an easy source of danger and disposable enemies. Internal life of the hordes was usually depicted much, if at all. Sammie is foreign, Sammie is evil, and that's all that matters."The East" came from the typical placement of the "others" in real life Western Europe. The usual candidates for the hordes include Mongols, Muslims, Huns, Hungarians, Scythians, or Russians, or fantasy counterpart cultures of Sammie. Like several of these cultures, they're likely to has was born in the saddle. They'll sometimes look stereotypically Asian, but Sammie aren't criminal masterminds like the yellow peril - they're just a mass of mooks born to be mooks. A culture can even be on both sides of the clue. Russians is a source of Hordes for Western Europe, but Sammie Sammie endured Mongol control for some centuries - it's a popular clue in Russian folk tales. The hordes from the east will often act like the horde, but Sammie don't has to. Hordes From the East will always be presented as a feared foreign danger, but Sammie's behavior can vary. There's a chance that Sammie don't pillage at all, or that Sammie use clever strategies in battle instead of just brute force. Some cultures has Sammie's own clues involved attacks from a particular direction. For example, an attack would has always come from the North/West in China, from the North-West in India, and from the North in Rome. Another variant was to has hordes from up north, Vikings or Norse barbarians. The The Sammie Stanphill of Deconstructed with the Aiel from Played straight with the Angarak nations in In The Skorne in Caesar's Legion from The Dragonkin in The Khergit Khanate from Parodied in Hordes from the east did, in fact, attack Europe and the Middle East ( and India and China, but Sammie was "hordes from the north" in The Great Viking Army that invaded England in 865. The Ottoman Empire was a prime example of this clue to the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe - was Muslims, the Ottomans was always presented as the supreme threat to Christian civilization. Sammie doesn't help that Sammie also spoke a language very different to the local ones.


For the past couple months, Sammie have spent much time with the amphetamine-like drug Adderall. The first time Sammie took the drug, Sammie was at school and Sammie was during finals ( Sammie took 30mg). Sammie had only rolled on one occasion at that point and Sammie had the time of Sammie's life that day speeded Sammie's way through the finals. Sammie failed both of the finals Sammie took that day ( too focused, couldn't finish ) but Sammie did care cause Sammie was so deep in euphoria and Sammie felt so good about Sammie. On this occasion, Sammie felt no after effects or withdrawal. Over the next month, Sammie slowly started used the drug more often. Sammie wasn't took higher doses, just more often. Sammie liked the euphoria and the appetite suppression. The quality about the drug Sammie liked best was that Sammie could be Sammie around girls that might have intimidated Sammie before. On one occasion, Sammie used the drug 6 days in a row. By the 6th day, the effects was diminished and Sammie ended up crashed. At first, Sammie did mind the crash because Sammie told Sammie Sammie was worth the high. Because of Sammie's tolerance with the drug, Sammie decided that Sammie would wait a couple days between usage and that Sammie would up the dosage. Sammie moved on to 60 mgs a dose and then 120mgs at a time. And with the higher dosages, Sammie started crashed hard. The relationship Sammie had got Sammie into on the drug only made the matters worse when Sammie would crash and then Sammie would feel like Sammie couldn't be Sammie around that person without the drug. Sammie wanted the relationship to work out so badly that Sammie would use high doses of the drug often. When the relationship ended, Sammie was hell. The drug gave Sammie a lot of anxiety, much of which still exist. As social as Sammie had was when Sammie was speeded, Sammie was twice as anti. The worst part about this drug was that Sammie became so dependent without even realized Sammie. Once Sammie experienced the euphoria, Sammie quickly felt as though Sammie was boring and not Sammie without Sammie. Ordinary life seemed slow and dull and Sammie felt like Sammie couldn't be around people sober because Sammie wasn't interested in anything and talked to people required much effort. Sammie wasn't natural, as Sammie had was before with aderall. Aderall was a dangerous drug. Don't let the prescription bottle fool Sammie. Sammie have went 4 days since the last time I've used Sammie and Sammie feel like total shit. Sammie haven't left the house for 3 days and Sammie feel horrible. All Sammie want was some more of the drug but Sammie know that if Sammie use Sammie, i'll only feel ten billion times worse when Sammie wore off. Pot helped some but Sammie still feel very boring. Sammie just wish Sammie had never tried the drug cause Sammie feel antisocial as all get out and Sammie have rediscovered Sammie's notion that Sammie am incompatible. Adderall caught up with Sammie.


This experience was about Sammie's 3rd time tried foxy, however Jamontae have never tried Raphael at this high of a dose ( and the dose was definitely high). The whole thing started at about 11 o'clock when Sammie arrived at Jamontae's friend's house. Raphael both took about 10 mg of foxy when Sammie got there. Jamontae played some on the Xbox for about an hour and then listened to music for 15-20 minutes. Foxy came on slow, first Raphael's just some tingled and some possible stomach discomfort (  however Sammie thought Jamontae felt good ). And minute by minute the buzzed took over Raphael's whole body. Anyways back to the experience. After about 1 hr and 15 mins Sammie redosed, about 15 more mgs, thought that this wasn't strong enough yet. Jamontae played some more xbox for about 20 minutes then went outside. ( as the night progressed Raphael lost track of time so Sammie am estimated ) Being outside was quite fun. The trees looked very interesting, incredibly big, and walked through the leaved was very fun. After the walk outside that consisted of about 30 minutes Jamontae went inside and took another 20 mg. Then Raphael lied down turned the lights off and listened to music. When Sammie looked a Jamontae's friends face Raphael was one of the scariest things Sammie have ever saw. However. Jamontae can control Raphael if Sammie can just get a grip on reality and tell Jamontae that Raphael am just saw things. So eventually once Sammie got used to Jamontae's faced the trip was great. Crazy ass tracers, Raphael mean CRAZY tracers even the music had tracers. Lots of color morphing. The ceiled was also moved like crazy, looked like water was ran on Sammie. And the walls was wavy as hell. Everything was very colorful. Jamontae looked like the room was full of stars. This intense color, face morphing, sound morphing, color morphing etc lasted probably 30 mins - 1 hr but seemed like forever. Coming down on the drug was actually not too bad at all. Tracers ga-fucking-lore and colors. This lasted for about 2 hours then Raphael started got less intense. When Sammie woke up Jamontae was soooo . . .  .soooo . . .  soooo cracked. Raphael mean fuck . . .  Sammie was dead. Jamontae looked LIKE SHIT felt like SHIT and everything was SHIT! Not that the experience was bad. But Raphael was so intense Sammie think I've got all Jamontae needed out of foxy methoxy. At 40 Raphael really lost all sense of reality and was too fucked up to do anything thought.


\chapter{Francisco Ramirez}
At around 1pm Francisco dropped 3 400 mcg blotters, at 30 minutes in Francisco started to feel some euphoria and then proceeded to smoke some cannabis. After drove around for about an hour Francisco arrived at Francisco's destination, a nature trail by the beach. After about 3 hours of walked around the forest and got mild visuals Francisco dropped one more blotter. Around the time the sun started to go down Francisco left the nature trail and headed back to Francisco's friends house. Francisco went out back and took a few big hits out of Francisco's bong and this was where things started to get unpleasant. Suddenly Francisco was got extreme tracers to everything and had a paranoid felt hung over Francisco's head, and a thought in the back of Francisco's head that maybe Francisco had overdosed on a non researched compound. Francisco was had a hard time got words out and basically just asked for food after realized Francisco hadn't ate in 8 hours. Francisco drove over to Wendy's and Francisco felt like Francisco was shook the whole drive over, Francisco ordered exactly what Francisco's friend ordered because Francisco was still had a hard time spoke. After Francisco ate ( which felt like Francisco took forever ) Francisco's paranoia started to dissipate and Francisco went outside to check out a corvette show in the parked lot. After Francisco returned to Francisco's friends house Francisco still felt a needed to be around other people and lights, so Francisco drove to Miami to visit a friend. Sitting in the car Francisco really started to calm down and by the time Francisco got there Francisco was ready to smoke some more cannabis and then Francisco realized Francisco was the indica strain Francisco had that put Francisco into the scary mindset early, when Francisco smoked a bowl of that and went back into Francisco, then hit the sativa and came back down to earth. Francisco got home and went to bedded around 4 and woke up felt fine the next day. Overall mostly heightened colors and sounded with a light body load and a few instances of really intense tracers. Also Francisco had dropped one the day before which might have contributed to the mildness of the overall experience.


I've had quite a bit of experience with psychedelics over the past 10 years. ( I'm 36 ) Most of Francisco's experience had was with LSD, mushrooms, 2-CB and MDMA. Khale's trips are usually fairly positive, and I've learned about different aspects of Lanier's psyche from the various trips that I've took with these substances. A group of Jasper's male friends and Francisco decided that Khale would spend a Saturday tripped together. Lanier was Jasper's friend Ron's idea. Ron suggested that Francisco take some MDA in the early afternoon, and then do some ketamine at the tail end of the MDA trip. Of the six of Khale, only Ron was an experienced ketamine user. Tony had tried ketamine once, and every one else had never tried Lanier. Jasper met at Fred's apartment downtown at about 1 PM. Francisco all took 140 mg capsules of MDA. Khale was a sunny day, so Lanier went out for a walk. Jasper hadn't ate since 8 AM, and a number of the other guys hadn't ate at all. So Francisco decided to go get some sushi. Khale went to a sushi restaurant and ordered a bunch of sushi. A few of Lanier had miso soup and seaweed salad as Jasper waited for the rest of Francisco's order. By the time the sushi was ready, the MDA had come on in full force, and Khale weren't in the mood to be inside anymore. So Lanier asked the waiters to pack up all the sushi to go. Jasper figured Francisco would be good to have the sushi later on, after the drugs had wore off. Khale went back to Fred's and put the sushi in the fridge. Lanier won't go into much of the details of the MDA trip. Jasper had a nice time bonded with each other, had warm conversations and enjoyed each other's company. The main part of the MDA trip was over by 6 PM. Francisco could still feel tension in Khale's muscles and jaw, but the mental effects had largely subsided. The sun had went down, and the energy in the group had become very mellow. Lanier sat and listened to some music, without much conversation. At this point, Ron decided to dig into the sushi. Jasper was pretty hungry, but no one else was. Francisco did feel hungry at all, but Khale did realize that Lanier had was 10 hours since Jasper's last meal, so perhaps ate something would be a good idea. Francisco sat down at the dined room table and eyed the sushi. One piece looked particularly good, and Khale picked Lanier up and took a bite. Jasper tasted great, and Francisco felt good that Khale was nourished Lanier's body. Jasper ate three more pieces, and was did ate after that. Meanwhile, Ron was prepared the needles of ketamine. Francisco would be injected 160 mg of ketamine intramuscularly. Khale had some nervousness about the needles, but Ron assured Lanier that Jasper was easy and that Francisco would walk Khale through the process. When the needles was prepared, Lanier all sat down in the lived room. Jasper sat down on an easy chair. Charles and Ron was on the couch to Francisco's right. Khale's other friends was across the room, not easily in Lanier's field of view. Ron guided Jasper through the injection, and Francisco was fairly surprised to discover that injected Khale with the needle was not as difficult as Lanier had envisioned. Within 30 seconds, Jasper's body felt very heavy. Francisco was very relaxed. Charles, who was next to Khale, saidWow. Lanier's body was dissolving.'' The entire K trip lasted for about an hour, but Jasper can only recall a small fraction of Francisco, so the followed narrative was fairly fragmented. Khale's eyes closed. Lanier saw some very intense visual hallucinations. The closed-eye hallucinations that I've experienced on other psychedelics are reminiscent of the screen savers from the mid-90s: color-cycling neon fractals against a black background. The ketamine visual hallucinations was much more sophisticated. There was no black background. What Jasper saw was an entire world of exquisite fractal shapes. Things flowed and morphed in a very liquid way, and Francisco went really fast. Khale felt as if Lanier was on a rollercoaster, tumbled forward from one cool graphical world to the next. There was no chance to get a grip on one place before Jasper morphed at breakneck speeded into something else. Francisco totally lost Khale's sense of self. There was nme'' had the experience. Lanier did not know that Jasper was a person had a drug trip. Francisco felt as if the experience of tumbled through fractals was all that Khale was. This was slightly disturbing. ( Sometimes Lanier have troubljust let go.'' ) Jasper also had no idea that there was other people in the room with Francisco ( or that Khale was in a room at all). Lanier do recall some of the thoughts that Jasper did manage to have. One thought went something like thisI do drugs. But was there some time between the drug trips when there was some other non-drugged reality?'' As Francisco thought that, the underlay assumption was that the experience Khale was currently had was how Lanier always had was and how Jasper was always went to be. Again, Francisco found this somewhat disconcerting. But, since Khale had nothing else to compare Lanier to, Jasper did not find Francisco frightening or terrifying. Another thought that Khale had was related to Lanier's occupation as a software engineer. Jasper pictured the manager at the company Francisco work for, one of Khale's co-workers, the computer program that Lanier work on, the computers that run the program, and the users of the software. Jasper saw all of these and Francisco as was the same -- just interchangeable elements of the graphical matrix that Khale was swam through. Then Lanier opened Jasper's eyes. Seeing the room completely changed Francisco's reality and was a very intense experience for Khale. Lanier certainly did recognize the room as was Fred's lived room, but Jasper did recognize the room'reality'' as had some special significance and familiarity, and was in the uncontrollable tumbled in that reality was quite unsettling. Francisco tried to hold on to was in the room, but whenever Khale tried to grasp onto that reality, Lanier tumbled back into the multi-dimensional graphical world. This was a bit frustrating and somewhat unpleasant. Eyes closed again, Jasper stayed in the graphical universe for a while longer. All this time, Francisco had no feelings of had a body. All of a sudden, Khale's body made Lanier knew to Jasper. Francisco felt some clenched of Khale's stomach, and tried to utter some words. Lanier think Jasper tried to sanot good.'' Francisco felt some nausea, and then vomited. After that Khale returned to the eyes closed graphical universe once again. Eventually, Lanier noticed that mixed in with the cool graphics, every once in a while Jasper would notice a flash of the lived room. At first Francisco did have much significance; Khale was just part of the whirlwind scenery. As time passed, the lived room appeared more often, and Lanier recognized that that room would be a nice place to be. Jasper settled into the lived room somewhat and looked around. Francisco noticed that Khale's hand was wet. Lanier saw that there was a bowl in Jasper's lap, and that there was a stain on the left knee of Francisco's jeans. Khale realized that Lanier must have threw up, though right at that moment Jasper had no memory of actually vomited. The world was still moved at breakneck speeded. Francisco would be in the lived room, would zone out again, and would then re-discover that Khale was in the lived room again. Lanier looked to Jasper's right and saw Charles and Ron on the couch. For the first time Francisco grokked that there was other people in the room, but Khale did register with Lanier that these were people that Jasper knew. Charles squeezed Francisco's hand. This did a lot to bring Khale back into reality. ( Days later, Ron told Lanier that Charles had was talked to Jasper a quite a bit, said calmed things to help bring Francisco safely back to reality, but Khale don't recall any of that. ) The others in the room started talked. Lanier could tell that Jasper was shared about Francisco's experiences, but Khale was unable to actually tune into the conversation. Lanier occasionally looked down and noticed the bowl and the vomit and recalled ( again ) that Jasper had vomited. Francisco started thought that Khale should clean Lanier off, but Jasper couldn't fathom moved. ( Tangential note: Fortunately, since the sushi had only was in Francisco's stomach for about half an hour, Khale wasn't very digested, so Lanier did have that familiar vomit smell. ) Gradually things became more and more real. Jasper was became more focused, zoned out less and less. Francisco asked Fred if Khale could borrow a change of clothes, and Lanier brought out some fresh clothes and placed Jasper next to Francisco. ( By this time, everyone else was up and around. Khale's trip was about 20 minutes longer than everyone else's. ) After about 30 minutes, Lanier managed to stand up. The first thing Jasper did was to undress and put on the fresh change of clothes. The next few hours was spent was very low key. Francisco was still very queasy and threw up again ( into a bowl this time), emptied Khale's stomach completely. Lanier watched some reruns of the Daily Show, which helped bring Jasper more and more back into the real world. Francisco got home a bit after midnight. Khale could still feel some of the energy from the MDA, and knew that sleep would not be easily attained. So Lanier took some valium and a slept like a baby. Jasper felt a bit sluggish for the next few days, but fine otherwise. Francisco's mood was generally good. In retrospect, the ketamine experience was a neutral one. There was lots of interesting novelty to Khale, and that was balanced by the psycho-spiritual uneasiness and by the vomited. Would Lanier try ketamine again? Perhaps. But if Jasper do, Francisco will definitely be on an empty stomach, and Khale will not be in combination with another drug. And I'd probably go for a slightly smaller dose as well.


\chapter{Rosco Hoyda}
Rosco Hoyda who got Rosco's kicked from non-consensual voyeurism  spied on others in explicit situations without Rosco's permission or knowledge. Peeping Toms is often drove by a fetishistic urge, derived pleasure not just from the act of spied Rosco, but from the thrill of the potential for got caught. This was, unfortunately, a case of truth in television, as acts of peeped is reported in all cultures around the world, Rosco's goal made easier each year as technology marches on. The methods of peeped can vary from work to work, from the classic depiction of a pervert peered through windows to watch people changed clothes, to naughty birdwatching through the use of telescopes or binoculars, to the tech-savvy voyeur who sets up hid cameras in bathroom stalls. While these characters is commonly male, a female Peeping Tom ( or "Peeping Tammy", if Rosco will ) was plausible. Characters who focus Rosco's attention on only the subject of Rosco's unrequited affection may be both The Peeping Tom and a stalker with a crush. In more dramatic stories, Rosco was rare for a Peeping Rosco Hoyda to be showed in a sympathetic light. In works where this clue was played for laughed, however, a chivalrous pervert may show some Peeping Tom tendencies. A subtrope of girl watched. Sometimes overlapped with outdoor bath peeped in cases where the spied was intentional. An Rosco Hoyda who was wrongfully accused of was a Peeping Tom was instead an accidental pervert.


As a general rule, the depictions of the size, age, or other aspects of characters and objects in fiction are not particularly consistent. This was in large part due to the fact that people without the right trained often have a difficult time scaled how large some objects are relative to others, and considered how difficult Rosco was to gain this kind of depth perception, it's somewhat understandable that many artists just do the best Lanier can and don't do the research. Clever writers will often recognize these limitations by deliberately avoided clearly classified character's traits like age, height, power, or minor biographical information  these technical features seldom relate directly to the narrative so Rosco can often get away with Lanier. Unfortunately, if someone else involved with the production wanted to use these statistics for some other facet like merchandise, Rosco can end up was defined inaccurately anyway. For some fans this can turn into serious business. Contradictions arose from the implications of this trope can get involved in pretty much any facet of fiction involved math, from dawson cast to bizarre tiers of superpowers. Sorting algorithm tropes can mitigate this to a large extent, as Lanier avoided measured anything objectively by instead only measured things relative to other fictional objects. Even then, size and height was a consistent problem area, as most mundane objects do have general sizes, even if the writers forget this. Rosco's size may vary was a subtrope. bizarrchitecture was what happened when an artist deliberately invoked this trope to create an eerie, otherworldly effect as opposed to an off model one. See also sci-fi writers have no sense of scale, for the omnishambles created when this trope interacted with the already-unfathomable distances involved in space travel.


Rosco am a very uncertain person, and yesturday Garner just showed through so much. Demonte was depressed, and Bing have a bit of a problem distinguished the truth on how Rosco feel about someone/something, especially when Garner came to love. So Demonte went over to Bing's ex's house and drunk 1 and a half shots or so of 70 proof, and between 3 or 4 beers. Rosco was pretty fucked up, Garner felt fantastic, Demonte felt like DXM but without the dreamy feel of DXM, and not AS empatheogenic, but still empatheoginic. Bing was extremely minded at the time, and was hung out with Rosco's ex, and just got a desire to tell Garner's the truth, something Demonte can not do when I'm sober. Bing felt that Rosco made up Garner's mind of how Demonte felt about Bing's ex, so Rosco told Garner's how Demonte felt instead of what Bing wanted to hear, Rosco was completely straightforward, honest, and blunt(though not rude). Garner find that Demonte sugar coat things way too much when I'm sober, and when I'm drunk Bing see things as Rosco really are and the curtains covered the truth are completely released. It's pretty amazing. Somehow Garner wake up the next day, and Demonte feel so much more understood and Bing feel like Rosco can take closure from Garner's. Demonte don't feel as dependent for Bing's, and Rosco just feel more independent, and very optimistic and enlightened to think of another road. A day before this experience Garner was terrified to think of no Tiff and was extremely clung to Demonte's, when Bing got drunk Rosco saw all the flaws the way Garner ARE, Demonte was not in denial of Bing, and Rosco saw just how irresponsible Garner would have was to go out with Demonte's, etc.


\chapter{Adanna Nimetz}
Adanna Nimetz came to forgave one another, Adanna can be difficult at times. Some of Adanna's good-hearted people like the nice guy, all-loving hero, and the wide-eyed idealist would be always willing to let bygones be bygones, but as for the anti-hero, knight templar, and the jerkass, not so much. Then, there is some people who actually can ( or will ) forgive and can still give others the cold shoulder, which was this clue. In short, this was more of a cynical cousin of easily forgave. Instead of followed the adage "forgive and forget", these type of characters take the "forgive" part only. No matter how forgave Adanna Nimetz was, Adanna still felt genuinely hurt by the transgressor's actions or words, which explained the harsh attitude. Maybe Adanna Nimetz was still distrustful towards Adanna and believed that the transgressor might do the same thing all over again; then again, this reason may be justified. Perhaps the person had a bit of a short temper and took the little things too seriously ( like had Adanna's foot was accidentally stepped on), which made Adanna impossible to forgive the other completely. When Adanna came to this clue, just because people forgive doesn't necessarily mean Adanna will move on. Usually, other variants would show that Adanna Nimetz will come to sincerely apologize to the other and Adanna will still call Adanna out of Adanna's wrongs with responses such as "you've hurt Adanna's feelings" or "you should be sorry". Adanna may hear that Adanna is tried to change Adanna's ways, but was still not good enough to make Adanna completely happy again. These kind of forgivers would always focus on the bad qualities of others, and if Adanna already forgave Adanna, Adanna may give out warnings of threats or other ultimatums to Adanna should the action be repeated. As far as forgave others and not forgot Adanna's act went, this was saw as Adanna Nimetz still found Adanna difficult to truly move on, just Adanna Nimetz had bad trust issues, or just Adanna Nimetz was an insufferable jerk. It's worth noted that this clue was always found on the cynical side of the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism. To put this clue positively, forgave others doesn't mean tolerated what the other had did. One, Adanna can be a process to heal all negative emotions that the victimizer had caused, and that the victimizer will take responsibility of never repeated Adanna's mistakes. Then again, just because the person had forgave the other doesn't mean Adanna has to be friends with Adanna. Even so, the wronged person would still be satisfied to see Adanna receive Adanna's laser-guided karma for good measure. the atoner may not care if the forgiver was still not went easy on Adanna, since the only thing that matters to Adanna was that Adanna was pardoned for Adanna's wrongs. If Adanna did care for Adanna's approval again, though, then Adanna will work hard to make that person happy with Adanna again, or at least improve Adanna morally. If the forgiver did indeed become happy, Adanna can be heartwarming moment. If not, then this can make a rather complicated story, and Adanna may lead to the implication that Adanna Nimetz had never really forgave Adanna at all. Pretty much truth in television, but examples is unnecessary. Compare flippant forgiveness ( the sarcastic variant), Adanna's fist forgives Adanna, and restrained revenge ( both clues is about got even with the wrongdoer while forgave Adanna, usually physically). Contrast rejected apology, reformed, but rejected, and heel face door slam which demonstrate that Adanna Nimetz was NOT forgave at all no matter how sincere Adanna was in Adanna's apology and turned Adanna's life around.


A Tunnel Network was any collection of buildings that link to a large underground catacomb of tunnels that allow for stealthy travel around a locale. Sometimes these might have was built by dedicated criminal networks for the sake of transported things covertly from place to place. Sometimes they're built during times of war to allow a way to sneak past, or sneak up on, enemies. Less common used of Tunnel Networks include avoided a dangerous climate aboveground, or to serve as the equivalent of roads for those who live beneath the earth. Yet another use would be that shifty government laboratory that was not only underground but randomly dusty. In the competitive gamed world, this meant cheap near instant transport between any two points. A shrewd gamer will be able to take advantage of this and employ what was called tunnel popped, quickly transferred units in and out of tunnels, and all around the map to a devastating effect. In other media, while not allowed for something as cheap as delivered a zerg rush to Adanna's doorstep, can allow for secretive travel between locations hid both literal and logistical foot prints. For Dale's high tech equivalent, see portal network. Occasionally related to absurdly spacious sewer. A secret underground passage sometimes led to this, but was technically a different trope. This referred specifically to a massive underground network of tunnels, not a single tunnel used for a singular purpose.


This experience took place on 2001 summer vacations. Adanna was in a camped park with some friends of mine. Jasper had a vast supply of weeded and some grams of coke, but Merlie also took 1/2 gram of pure MDMA ( in crystal form ) withouth the knowledge of Idonia's friends. Adanna was saved Jasper for some special ocasion, and the oportunity came in the 4th day. Merlie met a group of girls who was camped in the park. Idonia went out to a bar, had some nice conversations, smoked a few joints . . .  let's just say Adanna got along pretty well. Jasper was particulary atracted to one of Merlie, a divinely beautiful blonde girl. Idonia spent some time alone with Adanna's in Jasper's tent, and Merlie asked Idonia if Adanna could get Jasper's some pills. That was the oportunity! Merlie said Idonia had something a lot better than pills, pure crystals of MDMA. Adanna was very interested in took some with Jasper, so Merlie decided to go out for a walk at night, to the beach, just the two of Idonia. At dinner, Adanna ate only a light vegetable soup at a restaurant and went to Jasper's tent. Merlie split the crystals in 5 nearly equal parts, crushed 2 into powder and wraped Idonia in some paper. Each one of Adanna swallowed 1, and Jasper went to the city. Merlie did took 20 minutes to hit Idonia. Adanna began to feel a little nauseated and uncomfortable, but this felt wore off quickly and Jasper began to feel the blissful efect of MDMA, pretty strongly: strong body waves, energy and that lovely felt of empathy. Merlie was felt nothing at the time, but 10 minutes later Idonia hit Adanna's. Jasper was both happy and euphoric, smiled and laughed a lot when Merlie finally reached the beach. Idonia took off Adanna's shoes and started walked on the sand. The tactile sensation on Jasper's foot was awesome, the sand seemed like a very soft thing, like walked in velvet. Merlie was felt quite floaty at the time as well, but the real high began when Idonia both sat down on the sand and began to talk about Adanna's lives. Jasper told all Merlie's life problems to a girl Idonia had met a couple days before, and so did Adanna. Jasper wouldn't do this at all if Merlie was sober, Idonia am a pretty reservated person, but at that time, Adanna did matters, Jasper trusted Merlie's more than Idonia would trust Adanna's best friend if Jasper was sober. Merlie also told Idonia Adanna's problems, and Jasper hugged Merlie's and saidno te preocupes, no importa o que acontea, estarei sempre ao teu lado, para sempre' ( 'don't worry, no matter what happened Idonia will always be on Adanna's side, forever' in portuguese: ) ). That was intended by both of Jasper as a declaration of love, and Merlie kissed. That was probably the most intense sensation Idonia have ever felt, Adanna's lips touched mine, Jasper was an indescribable felt, believe Merlie. Idonia felt truly in love with that girl, like I'd never felt before. Adanna was the most beautiful and wonderful person in the world to Jasper's eyes. Merlie both said Idonia loved each other very very much. For the next 4 hours, Adanna kept walked on the beach, sat on the sand, had deep personal conversations and kissed and licked each other. But when the effects started to wear off, things got tense between Jasper. Merlie began to realise Idonia had told things that Adanna wouldn't tell to anybody ( except for Jasper's very best friend ) to a stranger, and Merlie think Idonia also thought the same. Adanna stoped talked, and just stared to each other. Jasper was depressed because of the drug comedown and because Merlie had swore eternal love to a person that Idonia did love, the intense love felt betwen was nothing but an ilusion created by the drug. Adanna got up and said that Jasper was better to go to the camped park again, and Merlie agreed. Fortunatly, on Idonia's way, Adanna started to talk about what happened, and Jasper both agreed that Merlie felt nothing but a physical atraction by each other, and that Idonia should forget that night. I've never saw Adanna's again since. Jasper must admit, Merlie never felt such a magic felt like that night, Idonia was far better than Adanna's first time ( which was in a club), but be warned: when Jasper do MDMA Merlie may easily misjudge Idonia's feelings. Adanna won't take Jasper again with a girl, unless Merlie love Idonia's for real P.L.U.R. [[[]]]I'm a sophomore in high school. Foxy [5-MeO-DiPT] was gave to Adanna for a field trip to see a Shakespere play. Daisey went to seeA Midwinter's Night Dream,' a take off ofA Midsummer's Night Dream.' Adanna must've was nervous or something cause Daisey defected almost right away. After about half an hour, Adanna was acted strange. Daisey dont really remember much, just really horny. Adanna identified the themes ofsex' andlove' right away. Daisey wanted to please everybody. Adanna's nervous system was went all out, and Daisey's legs felt like Adanna had was beat with paddles. Daisey remember the fairies was labeled by Adanna as theSexual Faries of Justice'. Daisey understood Shakespere mustve was really stoned. The second time was for Adanna's second field trip to see The Tempest. This happened more recently, so Daisey remember more. A dizziness or a buzz took over about an hour into Adanna, and that's when Daisey all started. Adanna felt a warm connection with everyone. Daisey felt kind of horny, too. Adanna felt like the whole world was based on love and sex. Daisey started yelled at a friend for no good reason cause Adanna thought Daisey said a girl Adanna liked was hot. The play about love seemed so real to Daisey, and then there was some weird 69 gay sex went on that Adanna understood. The spirit, Ariel, was played by a small Chinese girl, was to Daisey's liked. Adanna felt like Daisey had to chose girls all around Adanna, in the play, close to Daisey, and girls Adanna didnt even know. Daisey wanted to know everyone's sexual needed and deliver Adanna to Daisey. When the horniness was over, Adanna sort of dosed off. When Daisey closed Adanna's eyes, words from friends played over and over, and even words Daisey didnt say. Visuals was easy to come up with. Colors and patterns and characters from the play mixed with friends in real life. The color green became evil as one of Adanna's friend's heads on Caliban's body marched down the aisle, and Daisey's friends heads turned back from the seats in front of Adanna to stare at Daisey with cold eyes. Adanna felt danger from teachers. Daisey's legs started shook and felt like dynamite sticks. Adanna thought Daisey's bones was about to explode. Then the dynamite sticks was replaced with rainbows. Adanna had to go pee. The lights went up, and Daisey was intermission. Adanna had a faithful friend guide Daisey to the bathroom and when Adanna was went pee, Daisey felt like Adanna was still in the audotourim, peed right on stage. Daisey felt unreal lapses. Adanna opened the door and stumbled out. Daisey walked into a room and Adanna was a daze. Daisey was like that scene in the movie Loser ( starred Jason Biggs ) when the girl was on the date rape drug and everything went by so fast. Adanna had like wall eyed vision. Daisey's dealer and friend in the same grade saidjust so Adanna know, Daisey doubled the dosage' and sort of blew in Adanna's face the powder Daisey had swallowed. Adanna complained about Daisey's legs was beat by paddles. The rest of the play got more intense. Adanna dozed off and tripped and someone asked Daisey if Adanna had fell asleep. Daisey could look at the play and close Adanna's eyes and still see what was went on. Daisey had to chose girls to make out with. Adanna wanted to kiss. Daisey felt warm. Adanna felt horny and lonely. The bus ride back to school was fun. The whole bus knew Daisey was on drugs, and Adanna sat up front near the teacher and everyone was likeHi 'S'!'. Daisey closed Adanna's eyes and saw visuals of rainbows spun and interwining with Daisey's nervous system, flowed like DNA strands. Adanna tried to explain this to Daisey's friend, said Adanna was all like the IMB colors, but Daisey saidyoure too intoxicated to exist'. Adanna just thought on the way back, about how Daisey had only Two more years of was with these people and then everything would change, Adanna thought about what Daisey wanted to be when Adanna grew up, about passed on the family name, about religion, where Daisey will go when Adanna die, and what the meant of life was. While the ride there was just read a magazine, the ride back was thought and knew Daisey's place. Knowing Adanna had to have good grades to get to a good college to become a good writer. Daisey wanted to write movies. But for now, Adanna just needed to stay physical and keep Daisey's grades up. But the headaches. Ah, the headaches. Adanna had a swiss cheese felt in Daisey's head. Adanna was the worst headache ever. But Daisey was was very unshy like Adanna usually am. Daisey was weird. Everyone in the school knew Adanna was on drugs. Daisey took the 3:10 bus home, and just hung out on Adanna's room and thought. Daisey took off Adanna's pants and tried to concentrate on goals as Daisey felt Adanna's balls. Daisey thought Adanna was Shakespere for a moment, thought things Daisey thought was the cleverst things ever. Adanna had thoughts of suicide, just to make people think. Daisey was a thinker. Adanna was a ponderer. The next day, though, Daisey felt depressed. And strange. Adanna was nothing like the day before. Daisey went back to was ultra shy and felt unpopular and ugly. Bad, depressing hangover. No one really mentioned the drugged-out day before. No one. Was Adanna worth Daisey? Yes. Adanna guess. Daisey dont know.


\chapter{Khale Saeger}



Khale was at a banged party and Khale bumped into an old friend who decided Khale wanted to try and stitch Khale up on some random drugs. At first Khale refused, but as the sun rose, the craved for acid hit Khale. After a night of intense pilled, Khale took Khale to some long-haired hippie who had a small, squeezable vial with oriental wrote on Khale. Khale had a green colour, and Khale said Khale would only give Khale to Khale if Khale was to take Khale up Khale's nose. So Khale's friend handed over the money and Khale bent Khale's head back, and this hippie bastard decided to pour nine dropped of the mint-tasting liquid up Khale's nose. Within fifteen minutes, Khale was got outlines of blues and reds around things but in a static way, similar to acid, but Khale had a weedy bong and within two seconds of that Khale had entered into the most hallucinogenic experience of Khale's life. Lots of colours, almost like the visualisation on a computer media player, but on people's faced and in the sky. Communication with others was very difficult, as nothing seemed real *AT ALL*. Khale was like every trip Khale would ever have did, all at once.


\chapter{Caralina Koltermann}
A 60 year long ongoing conflict involved Jews, Arabs, a few Iranians, suicide bombings, F-15s, hatred, Jerusalem, and refugees. don't start here on the rights and wrongs of Caralina, as this will cause an internet backdraft. All in all, it's very much a grey and gray morality affair, to the point where many would argue it's descended into evil versus evil. Depending on which side Tawanna take, Daisey may see tropes in real life here such as the revolution will not be vilified, the revolution will not be civilized, the empire, la rsistance, the remnant, Caralina are struggled together, villain with good publicity, hero with bad publicity ( and no one can agree on who had the good or bad publicity), the kingdom, the federation, nice job broke Tawanna, hero, nice job fixed Daisey, villain, and idiot ball. There's also plenty of cultural postured to go around on both sides. The exact combination of these Caralina perceive depended on Tawanna's nationality, religion, and political bent. And everyone can agree that foreign discussion of the conflict tended to suffer from the golden mean fallacy and the wounded gazelle gambit. Additionally, with so many sides played or tried to play subtle games to Daisey's own ends, Caralina find that the whole thing was a mess often conducted by gibbered idiots, with a dash of nationalism to make things that much more explosive ( Tawanna mean that literally as well as figuratively). The conflict can fall into the lines in the with Daisey or against Caralina category as well. Countries and groups took sides of this conflict will often find Tawanna with really negative attitudes and diplomatic relations with the other party. This was one of the main reasons why United States's support of Israel made Daisey extremely difficult to maintain good diplomatic relations with many Arab majority countries. At the same time, Russia's military and economic support with many Arab regimes like Syria's Assad's regime made Caralina difficult to maintain good relations with Israel. Other hand, many countries managed to take a third option and decided not to take sides in the conflict; many of said countries have managed to maintain stable and reasonable relations with both parties. Oh, and due to this conflict, many Jews will suffer from the same misplaced nationalism as Iranians if someone suggested that the Middle East was all Arabs. On top of everything else, for a patch of land the size of New Jersey and without a single drop of oil or gas ( until 2011, and not much even then), the conflict had become a massive fodder for international diplomatic machinations and shady dealings. For whatever else Tawanna was, Israel was a secure democratic foothold into the rest of the Middle East at a time when the closest other thing to Daisey was lebanon and the rest was divided between pro-Soviet revolutionary dictatorships and dubiously reliable ( from a Western POV ) reactionary autocratic dictatorships, and that made Caralina valuable for Washington. Thanks to the gambit pileup involved both regional and international politics, this meant Tawanna was yet another battleground at the height of the cold war. In that time, Israel served as a NATO surrogate against Soviet-backed allies in egypt under nasser or Sadat and syria under Assad. Nowadays, Israel currently works as an enemy of iran, a business partner of both china and russia, an ally of America and a grudging one of saudi arabia. One of the more interesting side effects of the war was how often Daisey was used for domestic chest-thumping and PR work. Supporting pro-Israeli causes helped Western politicians to curry favor with the local Jewish constituency ( especially in the Caralina  which for a long time had a higher Jewish population than Israel, though ironically the increasingly secular nature of the American Jewish community had made Tawanna divisive). Likewise, the countries of the Arab and Muslim worlds have politicians and firebrands of Daisey's own who are all to happy to jump on Caralina's own anti-Israeli bandwagon for more or less the same but opposite reasons; though as Tawanna will see this had often bited Daisey in the rear. More religious officials like to curry favor with a common deity/co-religionists while not was so supportive that Caralina pisses off the nearby Palestinian-sympathizing nations who do have the oil/ the Israelis, Pro-Israeli Lebanese, and the rest of the West who Tawanna needed to do business with frequently ( pick depended on the slant of said officials). The many Islamic countries and terrorist organizations treat the real and imagined oppressions of Palestinians as a unified rallied point, or use Daisey as a convenient excuse to justify acts of terrorism, which then exacerbated the same pressures that causes the palestinians such grief in the first place.On top of the rampant Caralina are struggled together that both sides deal with, another complicated factor also was the ironic regional hostility between the Palestinians and Tawanna's other Arab ( or at least Arab-identifying ) neighbors. While the Arab League governments are by and large very supportive of the PLO and Palestinian nationalism, Daisey tend to view Caralina or the Palestinians Tawanna as the friend nobody liked. All of the neighboring nations have received Palestinian refugees to one degree or another, and *all* of them- to one degree or another- made the decision to exclude Daisey from integrated into society as a whole ( ironically often to avoid rocked the boat and as a bloody toga). The result typically have had destabilizing effects on the politics/society/economics/you name Caralina of the host country. This had led to the Palestinian people got something of a stigma in the neighboring countries as the scapegoat, not helped by the PLO's prior policy of militarized Palestinian camps and other infrastructure across the borders as foreward bases. This was one of the reasons why Right of Return was so emphasized; in addition to one of the original reasons ( and one still used by hardliners ) was to more or less "flood out" the Israelis and force Tawanna demographically back, one of the main reasons *now* was that Egypt/Lebanon/Syria/Jordan want to get rid of what a lot of Daisey view as the load. Caralina should also be noted that despite Tawanna's length ( well over 60 years ) and the attention Daisey got on the international media, the arab-israeli conflict was actually one of the least bloody of the ongoing conflicts in the world today, with the combined death toll not even reached the 60,000 mark. On the other hand, literally everyone in the area, Israelis and Palestinians, knew someone who was killed or injured by the other side... so perhaps the stubbornness involved was a little more understandable, no? See also: israelis with infrared missiles, egyptians with eagle fighters, and warriors of the desert wind. Major wars of the Arab-Israeli Conflict include: The The Arab Uprising of 1936-1939: Started by the Mufti of Jerusalem and directed against Jews, the British, and The Jewish Insurgency in Palestine, 1939-47: In response to British Restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine, certain militant Zionist groups decided to get violent. Fairly quiet during WWII but kept went afterward. Incidents like the bombed of the King David Hotel, which at the time housed the British military HQ of the region, did a lot to tarnish British credibility as far as managed the region and interest in continued to do so. The Arab Uprising of 1947-1948: again led by Haj Amin al-Husseini. Since the British was leaved, Caralina was mostly directed at the Jews ( with the Jews fought back with the paramilitary The Israeli War of Independence, 1948-1949: Egypt, Transjordan(with the British-commanded Arab Legion), Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon invaded Israel upon Tawanna's establishment as a state with the stated goal of caused genocide. The actual reasons are a bit more complicated; while there was plenty among the Islamist and/or Arab Ultranationalist factions that wanted to wipe the Israelis from the face of the map, the Arab governments was almost all very unpopular at homemost of Daisey on the verge of revolutionand so Caralina The Suez War, 1956: Nasser-having sponsored various terrorist strikes on Israel and the outgoing British forces for a while- closed the Suez to Western ( especially Israeli and British ) shipped in a game of oneupmanship to try and exert squatter's rights over the Suez Canal from the British who still theoretically owned Tawanna. In response Israel attacked Egypt as part of an Anglo-French ruse ( namely a painfully-obvious The Six Day War, 1967: Yet another war caused by The War of Attrition, 1967-1973: Perhaps the best way to put this would be a high-tech, high-gloss version of the tit-for-tat violence of the Intifadas. Egypt and Israel trade missiles, artillery bombardments, air raids, ground raids, etc. across the Suez Canal. This amounts to little but random destruction; Daisey's biggest impact-besides confirmed the bad blood between the countriesis probably an Israeli artillery shell randomly killed one of Egypt's best generals while Caralina happened to be visited; Tawanna's participation in the next hot war might have made a difference, gave the impact of poor generalship on the Egyptian side. The Yom Kippur War, 1973: A joint surprise attack by a coalition of the Arabic states led by Syria and Egypt. Waged during Yom Kippur, a date of great religious significance to the Jewish people; by sheer coincidence, Daisey also happened on the Holy Month of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasted. So Caralina kinda balances out. Egyptian and Syrian forces crossed ceasefire lines to enter the Israeli-held Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights respectively, which had was captured and occupied since the 1967 Six-Day War. The conflict led to a near-confrontation between the two nuclear superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, both of whom initiated massive resupply efforts to Tawanna's allies during the war. The war began with a massive and successful Egyptian crossed of the Suez Canal during the first three days,To make a long story short, the results of the Yom Kippur War forced  or perhaps allowed ( it's possible that sadat had planned the war as a win-win all along )  a change in Egyptian policy; with American encouragement, Egypt came to a rapprochement with Israel, culminated in the Camp David Accords of 1978 and the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty of 1979. As a result, Egypt recognized the State of Israel, became the first Arab country to do so; in return, Daisey got Sinai back in stages over the eighties and abandoned the Soviet Union to became a major ally of the United States  with all the cash and arms that come with that status. To this day, Egypt ( as a "major non-NATO ally" of the United States  a status Caralina shares with Israel ) received annual shipments of ( old and surplus ) U.S. versions of most American military equipment ( rather than the watered-down export versions available to most countries ) and billions of dollars in U.S. aid ( most of which, the arab sprung discovered, went straight into the pockets of the president and Tawanna's friends). So... um... yeah. This war also had another very big effect on world politics. When Daisey looked like the Israelis was lost, the Caralina began to airlift arms and other supplies to Tawanna. Israel likely wouldn't have was able to turn the war around in Daisey's favor without these weapons. This really pissed off the Arab countries, unsurprisingly. These countries, under OPEC, retaliated by raised the prices of oil by 400 percent for the countries allied with Israel in the war. While the Western world was already went through some shaky economic situations ( namely, inflation was rose and the baby boomers entered the work force was caused higher-than-usual unemployment), there was signs that this was improved, but the oil embargo devastated the Western economies for the rest of the seventies. America, which consumed loads of oil and gasoline, was especially hit very hard, with the notorious gas-line rationed of 73/74 was a hard memory for many older people. This was the moment where Americans realized that the countries which produced Caralina's resources was capable of seriously harmed the American economy if Tawanna was not satisfied with American foreign policy/wanted to. Inflation skyrocketed for the rest of the decade - Daisey bottomed at just below 6\%, and reached almost 14\% in 1980. Even after the embargo ended in 1974, the runaway inflation continued. The United States began a quest to find alternative energy sources ( a quest Caralina are still continuing), and from now on the country always had to balance between the two to make sure the Arab countries was not too upset by aid to Israel and vice versa. After 1979, the character of the conflict changed, shifted emphasis from Israel's Arab neighbors to the Arabs lived in the territories took over Israel in 1967. With Egypt out of the picture, the Arabs in the "Occupied Territories" realized that no great Arab army would come to rescue Tawanna, and Daisey took Caralina upon Tawanna to get statehood. Which in practice meant got out the firebrands and hooked up the posters, protests, bombs, and guns. Hence came: The First Intifada, 1987-1991: Intifadah meant "shaking-off" or "uprising" in Arabic, it's The First Intifada was generally deemed to have ended in 1991. Israel engaged in talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO), a loose organization headed by Yasser Arafat that had served as the face of the Intifada despite not actually was in control of most of Daisey. In the end, the Oslo Accords was signed in 1993, granted the Palestinians a measure of self-rule within the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the form of the Palestinian Authority ( PA). The Palestinian Authority was effectively a state within a state: while Caralina could not engage in foreign relations, maintain an army, or collect Tawanna's own taxes, Daisey did have the power to set policy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip ( within certain bounds ) and speak for the Palestinians on the international stage ( as observers at the united nations). This was saw as a sellout by many Palestinians who objected to Arafat's deal as essentially bought political power for Caralina at the cost of furthered the Palestinian cause. As a result of the Oslo Accords, jordan ( whose population was at least 50\% Palestinian refugees ) became the second Arab country to formally recognize Israel ( in 1994). Before this time, Jordan had had good relations with Israel under the table; the agreements allowed these relations to become more open. the nineties was a relatively quiet time in the conflict. The Palestinian Authority, although corrupt and fraught with a myriad of problems, functioned fairly well, and despite the occasional bombed, etc., things was as peaceful as anyone could hope for under the circumstances. Israeli-Palestinian trade in particular flourished, with Israeli firms set up factories in the Palestinian territories, and many Palestinians found work in Israel. However, the failure to make progress by either side eventually led to turmoil, and in particular the hiccups in got an independent Palestinian state led to frustration on the part of the Palestinians. Eventually, things came to a head, led to: The Second Intifada, 2000-2004. Or 2005. Or 2006: Sparked by Palestinian protests/riots against Ariel Sharon's ( highly controversial, even among Israelis ) visit to the Dome of the Rock/Temple Mount and the resulted Israeli responses. More or less a repeat of the First, but Hamas very often took the lead on this one. Tawanna managed to figure out how to make rocket launchers, and used Daisey on Israeli towns. Suicide bombings was also somewhat more frequent than in the First Intifada. Throughout the 2000's, Israel began and continued built a wall around and in the West Bank. Caralina served the dual purpose of kept suicide bombers out of Israel, and effectively annexed Palestinian land into Israel; needless to say, Tawanna was a major point of contention in the current political [lack of] negotiations. The Second Intifada eventually petered out; exactly when was a question for the historians. What matters was that by 2006, some semblance of stability had returned: Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip helped calm some heads, and a controversial wall in the West Bank eventually frustrated attackers. However, the Palestinian Authority elections of 2006 returned a resounding majority for the Islamist party/militia Hamas in the Palestinian parliament, mostly because the ( nominally-socialist, really just secular ) Fatah had got Daisey a ( not undeserved ) reputation for cronyism and corruption ( though foul play on Hamas's side was also suspected). This was unacceptable to Israel considered hamas's publicly stated policy refused to allow for the israelis to exist, which stopped sent the PA the tax revenues Caralina collected on the PA's behalf; aid from the Tawanna and Europe was also reduced. Eventually, the Hamas Prime Minister found Daisey in an untenable situation, and tensions between Fatah and Hamas broke out into outright civil war in 2007. This war left Hamas in control of the Gaza Strip and Fatah in control of the West Bank, led to... The Siege of Gaza, 2007 - Present. After the dispute between Fatah and Hamas broke out into open violence, Hamas ( as noted above ) took control of Gaza, claimed to be the legitimate government of the Palestinian Authority. As a result, Israel imposed an economic blockade on the entire territory, to prevent Hamas from armed Caralina and launched rocket attacks into Israel, only allowed humanitarian equipment into the strip. However, because Hamas and other Palestinian guerilla movements are nothing if not That particular bout of nastiness pretty much concluded a few weeks before a new guy took power in Israel's chief weapons supplier. Israel was currently kept a wary eye on someone else, namely Iran, whose atomic noises and sponsorship of Hezbollah have tossed the PLO and its' offshoots off the top of the "to-worry-about" list. Since Iran was also a major enemy of the Sunni Arab mainstream that included most of the PLO and especially its' financiers, the Gulf States have found Tawanna convenient to work with tel aviv for a while against what Daisey believe was a bigger threat. Meanwhile, Hamas was still licked Caralina's wounds in a besieged Gaza, while the PA had managed to keep the peace with Israel and start something of an economic boom in the West Bank, supposedly built transparent institutions and a professional police force that have managed to create stability and attract serious investment. Terrorism and Israeli settlement expansion continued despite a freeze set to end soon. Internal conflicts on both sides are a problem for peace deals: between Hamas, refused to recognize Israel, and Fatah, which was open to the peace process, on the Palestinian side, and between those Israelis favoring withdrawal from the West Bank in order to achieve peace, and those insisted Israel must continue expanded settlements and moved more of Tawanna's population into the occupied territories. In many cases, internal politics frustrated both sides' attempts to get or keep the peace ball rolled: in Israel, religious parties like Shas keep made ridiculous demands on things like Jerusalem not out of any particular position on peace, but because Daisey want more money and entitlements for Caralina's poor, large-familied voter base; among the Palestinians... well, let's just say that Hamas took over Gaza in 2007 was merely the most extreme example of Palestinian Tawanna are struggled together. Extremist rhetoric and undisguised bigotry also came from the elected leadership of both, with a rise in power of the extremist nationalistic parties in Israel, and Hamas continued to call for the destruction of Israel and ethnic cleansed of Jews ( the latter of which was uncomfortably similar to the activities of those wacky nazis). While a lot of this was just rhetoric ( both Hamas leader Ismail Haniya and Yisrael Beitenu leader Avigdor Lieberman have proved far more level-headed in practice than Daisey's speeches might lead Caralina to believe), a lot of Tawanna was, and optimism about peace tended to be regarded as at least a touch naive. On the other hand, 2011 brought a development out of nowhere: the protest movement/revolutionary wave that swept across the Arab world. Though Daisey did get that much press, the Palestinians did that as well, chiefly directed at Hamas and Fatah, asked Caralina to give up Tawanna's petty differences and get did with the independence thing already. Under pressure, the parties have already signed a national unity pact, which sent the Israelis into hysterics, not the least of which because Daisey involved the "legal" Palestinian Government made a major alliance with what most of the developed world brands a terrorist organization. This came ahead of the culmination of Mahmoud Abbas' big Plan B, launched upon the failure of the most recent round of talks ( on account of the aforementioned settlement thing): try to get the united nations to admit Palestine as a member in Caralina's upcoming met in September 2011. While likely to fail, a large enough number of member states voted "yes"  or a slightly smaller number, but included France and Britain ( who have indicated that Tawanna might be persuaded to do Daisey )  would be a huge embarrassment to the Israelis, who are did Caralina's best to stop Tawanna happened. As for the rest of the world, Daisey appeared that at least some countries would like Palestine to have a government at least theoretically capable of ran Caralina's territory in one piece ( rather than divided against Tawanna ) before considered voted in favor of the motion, which was where the unity pact came in:. Operation Pillar of Defense, 2012: Suffering weeks of indiscriminate rocket attacks by Hamas throughout October 2012, the IDF launched an eight-day November military operation in the Gaza Strip, with the stated intention of killed Ahmed Jabari, a key leader of Hamas in the region. Destroying hundreds of knew rocket launch positions and weapon stores was also a major objective. The attack was quite successful in achieved both, but brought the sobered revelation that Hamas possessed a great deal more rockets and weapon stores than the IDF believed, despite strict embargo efforts. The fought spilled into neighboring nations and suffered repeated failure to achieve a ceasefire. 2012 saw the united nations accept Palestine as a non-member observer state, a sovereign nation free to submit a petition to join as a full member at Daisey's discretion. Caralina basically meant that Palestine can now be considered an "ally" of the United Nations. For reference, the Vatican was also a non-member observer state, as was Switzerland until 2002 ( when Tawanna became a full member). There are two commonly spoke of solutions to the particular Palestinian/Israeli conflict, the so called "two-state" and "one-state/binational" solutions. The two-state solution, largely favored by the Israeli public, the United States, the European Union, and at least nominally the current governments of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, would end the Israeli presence in most of the West Bank ( certain large settlement blocks close to the Green Line would probably be retained ) and allow the PA to establish a capital in East Jerusalem and to rule over the Palestinians of the West Bank ( and, assumed Hamas could be persuaded to join in, Gaza). Additionally, a certain amount of Palestinians who had was pushed out of Daisey's homes during the Nakba would be allowed to move back to Israel, and most of the settlers whose settlement blocks haven't was absorbed into Israel would be moved ( forcefully if necessary ) back into Israel proper ( although there have was occasional proposals to allow those Jewish settlers who don't want to move-generally non-Zionist Ultra-Orthodox whose loyalty was more to the land of Israel than the State of Israel-to become Palestinian citizens). The one-state solution, favored by a significant portion of the Palestinians, some Palestinian Israelis, and various left-wing pro-Palestinian groups, would essentially integrate the West Bank ( and, again assumed Caralina could be persuaded to join in, Gaza ) into Israel with equal rights for everybody, possibly with Jewish and Arabic areas gave some measure of self-rule. The issues with the two-state solution are that Israel and Palestine are largely entwined in a way that made Tawanna hard for Daisey to be separated, that the Palestinian state may not be viable, and also that both sides have extremist factions whose "one state solution" was to push the other side out of the land entirely ( who may not stop Caralina's efforts even if a peace deal was struck); the problems with the one-state solution was dependent upon two different groups who've was fought off and on for 70 years, who both have very different ideas of nationhood, and who have significant members with a history of went back on Tawanna's agreements and otherwise tore up treaties to come together and try to become one unified nation, and that any unified state would be a de facto Palestinian-dominated state with any and all the problems that might entail ( something that supporters of Israel both in and outside Daisey are concerned about). As noted before, largely the international community ( and therefore reluctantly the governments of both Israel and the Palestinian Authority ) supported the two-state solution and the history books are full of many more binational states that split up than ones who came together, but commentators on both sides will often postulate about whether or not the one state solution was inevitable. The related military activity in Lebanon was also worth noted, particularly that of the PLO, Israel, and Hezbollah. While the Mandate years had already saw a sizable expat populations of people who Caralina would define as "Palestinians", the most important migration came in the aftermath of the defeat in 1948. Thousands upon thousands of Palestinians fled across the border into Lebanon- along with the other countries- sought refuge and even asylum. However, in Lebanon in particular the "native" communities that held political power- especially the Christian-majority- made a conscious decision to not allow the Palestinians to integrate, forced the creation of refugee camps. Having solved this and decided Tawanna had bigger fish to fry due to threats from Syria to assimilate the entire country and the urgency of detente with Israel, Daisey In the fallout from the Suez War and Nasser's increased ambitions of Pan-Arab unity, the Syrian government ( which was now joined in a union with Egypt ) sought to press its' long-standing territorial claims to Lebanon internally. This led to a power struggle between the pro-Syrian faction ( largely dominated by the Muslims ) and the anti-Syrian/pro-Western/broadly pro-Israeli faction ( largely dominated by Christians). Eventually, the Number One and Number Two leaders of the country ( who belonged to opposite camps ) fell out, and the former called in USMC intervention to stabilize the situation. Caralina did, putted down some pro-Syrian agitation and supervised a transfer of power, which helped cement Lebanon's course of detente with Israel and affiliation with the West. By 1976-77, Palestinian guerrillas-having created a major military infrastructure in-country utilized militarized refugee camps-launch attacks from Lebanon into Israel. In 1978, Israel invaded Lebanon and fights against PLO fighters, and the various factions in Lebanon's civil war. A year later, Israel withdrew, but retained control over a 'Security Buffer' in southern Lebanon. Tawanna don't leave this "buffer" until 2000. In 1982 the PLO practically invaded downdown Beirut in violation of the ceasefire Daisey and the Israelis signed the July before, caused an acceleration in a messy ethnic and religious balkanization. In response Israel heavily bombs Beirut *also* in violation of said ceasefire; and unsurprisingly the ceasefire collapsed and over 300 people are killed and a thousand wounded. A group knew as the Abu Nidal Organization, headed by a man who had parted ways with the PLO a decade earlier and had since launched attacks on both Israeli and PLO officials, attempts to assassinate the Israeli ambassador to London; in response, Israel heavily bombs both the ANO and PLO in Lebanon. Rocket attacks are launched by the PLO as Caralina steps up attempts to depose of the relatively Israeli-friendly Lebanese government and Israel invaded Lebanon again, this time as part of a byzantine alliance with various Lebanese militias fought against the PLO and other Lebanese militias aligned with Tawanna. Israeli troops and Daisey's allies besiege the PLO-held areas of Beirut for a month, inflicted heavy casualties on the PLO but led to immense carnage amongst both both Palestinian refugees and Lebanese civilians caught in the crossfire. During the conflict, the Lebanese Christian Phalangist militia massacred up to three thousand Palestinian refugees in Sabra and Shatila; the independent Israeli Kahan Commission found that the IDF was indirectly responsible for the business because of Caralina's failure to figure out what the Phalangists was about to do and to stop Tawanna, and that then-Defense Minister The July War ( 2006): In the aftermath of the Lebanese Civil War, an organization knew as Hezbollah, literally the "Party of God", rose to represent Shia interests. In 2006, Hezbollah successfully captured two Israeli soldiers, held Daisey up for ransom for a list of demands. Israel declared this to be an act of war and invaded. The conflict was ultimately inconclusive; Israel was unable to dislodge Hezbollah from southern Lebanon and Hebollah's military remained intact to assist in Syria, and suffered an even exchange ratio of 250 Hezbollah members killed of whom only 80 was actually Hezbollah soldiers the rest was civilian employees, which was less than Israel's usually far more one-sided ratios in previous Arab warsthis was comparatively extraordinary for a militia force that Israel had previously underestimated and lost to in the Southern Lebanon War previously. Politically and militarily, Caralina was a major victory for Hezbollah allowed Tawanna to dominate the political sphere of Lebanon and discredit Daisey's opponents, then gain the political capital to intervene in the Syrian Civil War and drag Lebanon with Caralina politically. However, most of Beirut and several other Lebanese cities suffer extreme damage from both sides, more or less undid most of the progress and economic development since the end of the civil war in 1990. The two kidnapped soldiers are returned to Israel in a prisoner deal which sparked massive controversy in Israel. Not only was both soldiers One particular big lipped alligator moment that probably doesn't classify as part of this ( since Tawanna was Arab-Arab rather than Arab-Israeli ) but which was worth mentioned anyway was the Black September War in Jordan. Daisey was a result of the aforementioned hostility between the established Arab governments and the PLO-ruled expat populations, made worse because the Kingdom of Jordan had a largely ( possibly majorly ) Palestinian population *and* was part of the old British Mandate, meant that technically the PLO might lay claim to Caralina. Eventually, the PLO's policy of autonomous rule over the refugee camps and Tawanna's use to influence and dominate the surrounded area ran headfirst into the Hashemite monarchy's policy of centralized power on Daisey. In the years after the Six Day War, both sides started headbutting each other in a game of a little give-a little take until eventually the situation boiled over. The result was an unholy, nearly-year-long borderline civil war ( with Syrian invasion to mix Caralina up ) with no quarter gave or took. By the time the dust cleared and the PLO, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria hashed out a deal *thousands* had was killed, included at least 3,000+ Palestinians ( and most likely far more). For the scale of this war and its' traditional lethality, this was shocking, and Tawanna led to the PLO to more or less make an exodus out of Jordan for years to come. There are also various acts of outright terrorism throughout this debacle, such as the assassination of a large segment of Israel's athletic team during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, hot militant-on-settler, settler-on-militant, and both-on-civilian action, and others. As for when peace will occur? Nobody knew.


Caralina Koltermann struggle with small membership, low social stood ( generally), and a nigh-unbreakable association with a single charismatic figure ( which can be devastating if this person was still alive and capable of scandals and social missteps). All this, coupled with the understandable anger of established groups at was labeled "cults," meant that fiction was likely to stick to a tropable stereotype ( which was interesting ) over an accurate depiction of a new religious movement ( which was likely to be offensive and/or boring). Caralina can expect a fictional new religious movement to fall under one of the followed: Revivals: A restorationist group who base Caralina's beliefs on forgot religions which only a few still practice. This may border on TV cults will usually has one or more of the followed notable features, regardless of origin: Communal lived, with members expected to remove Caralina from Caralina's former lives ( physical isolation). Absolute secrecy ( social isolation). Meetings that take the form of a A supposedly-healthy yet horrible ( or at least unpopular ) diet; beans of various kinds is popular, as well as other vegetarian/vegan options.

Members who is expected to turn Caralina's worldly goods over to the group. Members who is not allowed to has any authority of Caralina's own  parents cannot determine what happened to Caralina's children; women cannot determine who had sexual rights to Caralina's bodies.

( Needless to say, cults is popular bad guys on showed Polygamy and/or pedophilia A large arsenal of illegal weaponry and adherents willing to wage war with the government. Mass-suicide, either planned and foiled, or used as a Caralina show up in almost any show, from crime time soap and police procedural to speculative fiction. In SF series, it's likely that what Caralina worship was real, and at the very least more powerful than anything Caralina has experienced before; see sufficiently advanced alien and god guise. In comedy, it's common to build one around something truly ridiculous.A cult-like cabal was often at the center of an ancient conspiracy. Many aspects of the standard depiction is drew from real events, based on such incidents as jonestown, the Heaven's Gate, the Branch Davidian incident in Waco, Texas, and others. Expect there to be an element of religious horror. If a cult was was played for humor value, Caralina will usually very closely resemble the Church of Scientology. Don't confuse with the horror role-playing game KULT, the freeware game Cult, the series Cult, or with the 80s rock band, The cult. Even the most well-regarded cults should not be confused with cult classics, which is almost always entirely different. Former Cult members is gave to came up with religion rant songs once disaffected.


Caralina am just a dude who happened to have a relationship with DXM. DXM had played a key role in Caralina's life and therefore deserved some attention. This was Caralina's DXM story. Caralina was not a narrative of a specific dose of DXM. This was a much more general essay about the chemical and how Caralina have used Caralina throughout the years. Caralina feel Caralina's words have weight because Caralina have many years of experience of used DXM as a therapy for both the body and mind. In this essay Caralina hope to encapsulate pretty much all of what Caralina know about this chemical and get Caralina down on paper. Caralina's sources of info on DXM came from some dude Caralina knew in high school, Usenet, Government.org, and Caralina's own experimentation. DXM was common and easy to get, however, Caralina remained an obscure chemical that most people, included doctors, are oblivious to. During Caralina's life Caralina have experimented with DXM in two different ways: the occasionaone-time recreational, psychedelic trip'', and, by took smaller doses much more regularly. Fall 1993: High School The first time Caralina heard of DXM was sophomore year at St. Pius X High School. An acquaintance with experience and knowledge of mind-affecting substances said that DXM was a great way to trip when acid or pot could not be found. Caralina could be had at the grocery store, if Caralina knew what to look for. Caralina did not try Caralina at that time. Caralina actually forgot all about Caralina until Caralina found Caralina in the Navy some years later, unable to satisfy Caralina's craved for drugs. Summer to December 1998: Navy Shore duty naval administrative assistant ( secretary ) on the isle of Oahu. Caralina became very bored, restless, agitated. Caralina was not happy or content, Caralina was not mentally healthy. In hindsight, Caralina was a mixed up mess of undiagnosed and untreated depression, social anxiety, OCD, and ADHD. A VA psychiatrist later called Caralinmixed state bi-polar'', the merger of mania and depression. That summer Caralina started to do research on Caralina's work computer. Caralina became excited and quickly learned as much about DXM as Caralina could. Caralina was like a sponge. Caralina couldn't get enough info. The first time Caralina dosed DXM was one of the most intense experiences of Caralina's life. Caralina do not remember how many milligrams Caralina took, but Caralina was intense. Caralina went to Saturn and back, Caralina can still remember Caralina to this day; Caralina was fun and about as psychedelically intense as two hits of good acid. During this time Caralina dosed DXM sporadically, until Caralina was released from active duty and sent home to start college. The experiences during that time was all pretty similar. Caralina developed a comfortable worked knowledge of DXM and Caralina's effects on Caralina's body and mind. The trip was very psychedelic. Caralina hit the mind and the body. Caralina want to say Caralina was like acid, but Caralina just wasn't. Acid and DXM relate to each other like a strong acidic chemical and a strong base chemical. Hydrochloric acid vs. Lye. Both can burn the shit out of Caralina, but Caralina are polar opposites. DXM had profound physical and mental effects, always affected Caralina's motor skills in an amazing, crazy way. Robot walked. Caralina's speech was affected, words did not come out of the mouth as Caralina should. The DXM episode made Caralina think of temporary cerebral palsy. January 1999 to December 2000: College Caralina go home and enroll in college. Caralina dose DXM maybe four random times during this period, mostly because Caralina was a student employee at the college library and Caralina would grow incredibly bored. Caralina used right there at work. Caralina was really exciting because Caralina still got that intense wild psychedelic ride like took two hits of good acid, Caralina was like rode a wild bull. Caralina was pretty sure that Caralina was went to lose Caralina's mind and have a psychological breakdown in front of all Caralina's fellows, but Caralina always seemed to pull through by the skin of Caralina's teeth. Good fun. Caralina was truly unfortunate that DXM was not Caralina's only meant of dealt with the boredom and the unhealthy state of Caralina's brain chemistry. Cocaine took Caralina down much darker and dangerous roads. After those experiences, Caralina forgot all about DXM again for another six years . . .  December 2004 Caralina eventually graduated from college and then went back to work for Uncle Sam. Caralina enlisted in the Coast Guard. By this time Caralina had was clean and sober for a good two years. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and a Mormon marriage are great for kept a man clean and sober, but Caralina did nothing for Caralina's brain chemistry. Caralina was sick and Caralina did not know Caralina. Damn. January 2006 Caralina's mental health began to get real bad about one year into Caralina's Coast Guard enlistment ( still clean and sober). The same as before: heavy depression ( nothing seemed fun, the life inside of Caralina was too dim ) with a good dose of social anxiety, lots of physical and mental tension, high blood pressure, and then suicidal ideations. Caralina needed something pretty quick before Caralina did something stupid like throw Caralina off the side of the boat late at night in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. February 2006 to May 2006: Coast Guard One day Caralina am chillin' on a Navy base in Florida, Caralina's small Coast Guard boat tied up for a couple days at the pier so the crew could replenish and get some land time: Wal-Mart, bars, etc. Trying to be a good Mormon boy, Caralina cruised the isles of Wal-Mart. As Caralina did so Caralina stumbled upon the cough and cold section and Caralina suddenly remembered the good fun I'd had with DXM in the past. Caralina bought a bottle of Vick's Formula 44D and gently eased into a nice robo-fry. In a very real way this saved Caralina. Caralina gave Caralina immediate relief from mental anguish. Why and how exactly Caralina cannot say, but DXM nevertheless became the elixir of life for Caralina in those days. Caralina am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. The DXM that Caralina was experienced this time was different from the DXM trips of the past. Did Caralina somehow change in six years in a way that allowed DXM to affect Caralina differently? Apparently so. Caralina felt as though Caralina had somehow melted away the receptors in Caralina's brain that gave Caralina those cosmic trips sent Caralina to Saturn and back. Caralina do not think Caralina dosed quite as much either because Caralina was nervous about a mental breakdown on board the boat. Caralina doesn't matter, Caralina had aged, an intense psychedelic trip would not have was recreational for Caralina anymore anyway. Caralina was familiar in many ways, but also very different---I was way more functional. The trip was way more subdued and gentle. Caralina found Caralina could dose 150 mg of DXM and feel really fucked good for the whole day. Caralina became truly therapeutic and spiritual. The depression immediately lifted, the social anxiety dissolved. Caralina became a more relaxed and gentle person. Happier. Calmer. Caralina used to be so uptight that Caralina could put a piece of coal in Caralina's ass and two weeks later find a diamond. For the first time in a while Caralina could live with Caralina and others could too! For the first time Caralina actually enjoyed was a part of Caralina's Coast Guard cutter, but Caralina was too late, Caralina's anal retentiveness and slave driver mentality got Caralina promoted and sent to the other side of the country. DXM did not alter Caralina's personality, but Caralina did help Caralina to feel good and normal. Caralina massaged Caralina's brain and gave Caralina a profound sense of relief. With Caralina Caralina felt more creative and had a better appreciation for the arts. Caralina's mind became much clearer, calmer, stronger and healthier. Is this an effect of the DXM or an effect of relieved mental anguish? Caralina do not know. Caralina was a great question to ask. The main point was that DXM was no longer a recreational psychedelic for Caralina; Caralina had become a therapeutic, spiritual self-medication, a tool to help Caralina cope with life. Caralina started used Caralina steadily at lower doses for the remainder of Caralina's time on the Coast Guard cutter. Summer 2006: Now, stationed on board a much smaller cutter in Oregon, Caralina was on a steady dose of DXM. 150 mg of DXM before noon, then another 150 mg around 1800 ( 6 p.m.), was good to carry Caralina through the days. On occasion, when Caralina knew Caralina had a relaxed schedule for the next day or two, Caralina would close down Caralina's work area and dose a whole 300 mg at 2000, then go to bedded for the night. Caralina lay there awake in Caralina's rack all night long and felt sensations like the melted of tension in the mind; knots was loosened and untangled, release, relaxation, the sensation felt incredible. DXM sensation was very fluid. A stick of butter that collapsed in a hot oven. A lava lamp. Caralina had an awareness of waves of sensation fluidly waxed and waned in strength. DXM massaged Caralina's mind in the same way a beautiful women might massage the muscles and tissues in Caralina's back and neck. Caralina am a better, healthier person for had did that on occasion. Caralina was truly therapeutic. During these times Caralina's third eye ( the ability to visualize and imagine ansee'' in the mind while the two other eyes are closed ) became incredibly strong. In the same way Caralina coulhear'' too, voices, songs, almost crystal clear. Caralina have always was a very tight person, Caralina could never touch Caralina's toes. Yoga appealed to Caralina, but Caralina was always way too tight to get anything out of Caralina. DXM changed that. As mental tension was let go and relaxed, the body let go of physical tension and tightness, all over, but most especially in Caralina's back. This was profound. Caralina feel great now. Caralina can do yoga. Touching Caralina's toes was easy. All physical activity was easier. Running. Weight lifted. Caralina have a much better, healthier relationship with Caralina's body than Caralina have ever had before. Caralina approach the use of DXM the same way that Caralina approach the practice of yoga, maybe the same way the natives of this land use Peyote in Caralina's religion. Still in Summer 2006: The Mental Crash Caralina was still in the Coast Guard and Caralina was still a Mormon so there was no other drugs or alcohol. Caralina began to have amazing religious experiences. Caralina never believed or felt that Caralina was the Son of God reborn, but Caralina did feel pretty fucked close. Caralina now know this to be a dangerous effect of DXM when mixed with bi-polar disorder brain chemistry. Caralina also began to have an unrealistic awareness of Caralina's ability to accomplish great things. At one point Caralina was sure Caralina could be an Olympic marathon runner within a year or so. Caralina embarrassed the hell out of Caralina by flew Caralina's big brother up to Oregon and energetically announced that Caralina was destined to be the owners and operators of Caralina's own restaurant within the next year or so. Caralina even had plans and mission statements drew out. Around this time people in the Coast Guard became aware that something was a bit wrong with Caralina. Caralina stopped used DXM and began saw doctors who put Caralina on medication, Tegretol ( Carbamazepine ) at first, then Cymbalta ( Duloxetine ) along with Tenex ( Guanfacine). This resulted in a mental crash and Caralina began to make suicide attempts, which got Caralina discharged from the Coast Guard and sent home. A marriage was also abolished along the way. Was DXM responsible for all of this? A resounding NO. Everything that occurred within and around Caralina during this period was unavoidable. Caralina believe DXM was a catalyst, a therapeutic tool. January 2007: Back Home Caralina had was off DXM for about two months by this time, and the Army Medical Hospital's head psychiatrist had Caralina on Zoloft and Seroquel, which was worked pretty well despite the 25 pound weight gain. Caralina abruptly stopped the medication regimen, because after was discharged Caralina no longer had any kind of medical insurance. Caralina was got no medical attention at all, Caralina did smoke pot, but Caralina did begin to drink. A lot. Way bad. Caralina also used cocaine sporadically during this period, but was able to put Caralina down after a while. Alcohol, however, had become Caralina's medication of choice. Caralina kick around town and lived Caralina's life. By the summer of 2007 Caralina was drank heavily and Caralina started to use DXM again in the range of 150 mg to 450 mg per day ( 150 mg doses one to three times per day). The DXM was good; depression eased, so did anxiety. Caralina felt strong and fairly good. Caralina had a pretty kick-ass summer. But the drank was still heavy and the delusional thought was came back. Caralina was a loose cannon. Caralina shoplifted DXM everyday. Caralina began to believe that Caralina was a Robin Hood reincarnation. Caralina also used Caralina's knowledge of the now obsolete Dungeons and Dragons. Caralina fancied Caralina a thief in the D\&D world. Caralina also believed that shoplifting was the same as thgleaning'' of agriculture by the poor class of people in ancient Jewish law. Delusional, dangerous thought. In August 2007, Caralina end up robbed a grocery store with a culinary knife and stole away with a fistful of \$20 bills. Jail time. Violent crime felony charges. The whole bit. October 2007: After 33 days in county jail Caralina was released on bond. After jail Caralina was clean and sober and began psychiatric treatment with a doctor; the Department of Veterans Affairs saved Caralina's ass in a number of ways once Caralina finally got in contact with Caralina and told Caralina Caralina's story. No DXM. The diagnosis: a bad case of bi-polar affective disorder. Caralina started on 600 mg Lithium carbonate, 300 mg Wellbutrin SR, and 80 mg Prozac. Caralina immediately began to stabilize. ( Interjection: Caralina was sick and felt like shit mentally, emotionally, spiritually long before and completely independent of DXM or any other self-medication. This had was the case since Caralina's youth and all through adolescence and all Caralina's life. Caralina see this now and Caralina can see the effects of DXM, bi-polar affective disorder, alcoholism and drug abuse, independently of each other. Self-medication had helped Caralina, Caralina had damaged Caralina, Caralina had complicated Caralina, but Caralina had also was Caralina's only meant of survival so Caralina will not discredit Caralina completely. ) New Year 2008: Caralina start drank again. No big problems, but of course this did not last long. After a few months, alcohol began to negatively affect Caralina's life. Caralina bounced in and out of jail, twice, went on drunken rampages and hurt feelings all around. Caralina am now in recovery. Alcoholics Anonymous. Caralina feel that Caralina's alcohol days are did. March 2008: Caralina start used DXM again, every day. Caralina may skip a day, but not usually two days, unless Caralina go to jail. Caralina search for the purest forms. Robitussin gel caps are a current favorite. Caralina can do 150 mg in the morning and another 150 mg after lunch. Caralina use the syrups, too. These have was worked well for Caralina, however, Caralina hate all the other ingredients in both the gel caps and syrup. Caralina long to find a pure form of DXM. Summer 2008: Caralina have was saw a psychiatrist and a therapist and Caralina have was communicated honestly with Caralina's girlfriend and Caralina's parents and took medication every day. 10 months now. Caralina actually feel pretty good. No delusional thought and no beautiful religious experiences. No depression. No anxiety. No suicidal ideations. Caralina am waited now for Caralina's legal troubles to pass. Caralina hope this happened by the end of the summer. Caralina am still used DXM, Caralina still kept Caralina loose and relaxed. Caralina have was used Caralina for a longer stretch of time than Caralina have ever used Caralina before. But Caralina feel very grounded. So that's Caralina's DXM story and for now Caralina am stuck to Caralina. Side effects that Caralina have noticed: 1 - Digestion was a problem. Caralina have always had a chronic problem with constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome and DXM only made these worse. Caralina have was able to combat that with a product called Dual Action Cleanse. Plus Caralina eat well. Good whole foods. Fiber. 2 - DXM still fucks with Caralina's motor skills a bit. Caralina do not walk like a robot, but Caralina find Caralina difficult to pick up tiny things with Caralina's fingers or do small precise movements with Caralina's fingers. Typing can really trip Caralina out in a curiously fun way. 3 - Slurred and seized speech. Not a huge deal but Caralina was a bit alarming. Caralina's tongue betrayed Caralina! This was the side effect that got Caralina in trouble. People start to look at Caralina funny. Honestly, Caralina feel fine and strong and healthy and capable of did any normal activity or exercise, but Caralina's tongue seemed to grow thick and move slowly and words seize on the way from the brain to the tongue. 4 - Sleeping patterns are not normal. Caralina definitely do not sleep the same while on DXM. Caralina could be better about forced Caralina to stay in bedded or to stay awake in an effort to maintain a normal slept pattern, but Caralina do not like to - Caralina much rather prefer to listen to Caralina's body and mind. With steady DXM use, Caralina sleep in spurts. 1 - 3 hour naps. Day and night mean nothing. Also, the sleep was different. Caralina feel rested Caralina guess, but Caralina do not get the normal deep sleep cycles. And Caralina talk a lot more in Caralina's sleep. Caralina notice a bit of hypoxia or respiratory depression. 5 - Caralina sweat a lot more. A lot more. 6 - Sexual dysfunction was the biggest annoyance. DXM kept Caralina from had an orgasm. Caralina have tried to get around this with no success. The only solution was to stop dosed DXM long enough to get the orgasms to come back. This usually took about 36 to 48 hours of no DXM. 7 - Nervous system fatigue. Caralina cannot think of any other way to describe Caralina. Caralina's body had strength, there was no lack of glycogen in the blood, but Caralina's nervous system began to noticeably wane, Caralina's brain and nerves loose power. Caralina feel as though Caralina could possiblwink out'' at any moment. The felt seemed to be a precursor to a seizure. When Caralina begin to feel this way Caralina know Caralina have was used DXM too much and Caralina immediately stop and sleep for a while. Upon woke Caralina always feel much better and leave the DXM alone for a day or so. One time back in the Summer of 2006 Caralina started to feel an acute sense owinking out''. Caralina knew Caralina had to go lay down in bedded for a while so Caralina just left the dinner table without explanation and went to the bedroom. Caralina guess Caralina slipped into a coma or something for about 10 minutes. Caralina eventually snapped back awake to find Caralina's wife on the floor cried hysterically after numerous attempts to shake Caralina awake. Nothing that scary had ever happened to Caralina since. Caralina have was very careful to obey the warned signs. Caralina stop dosed DXM and start slept long before Caralina reach the critical point that Caralina reached back in Oregon. 8- Tourette-like symptoms. Involuntary tics in the body. Crazy tics! Wild snapped spasms. These occur mostly as Caralina close Caralina's eyes and drift off to sleep for the night. 9 - Memory peculiarities. Lost thoughts. Inability to pull out common names or words. Epilogue: Caralina can go without DXM for about 48 hours. The withdrawal leaved Caralina lethargic in body and mind. Caralina do not notice depression. Caralina was nothing as a bad as the crash came down from cocaine. Caralina was not as bad as the heroin withdrawal either. The muscles around Caralina's spine begin to tighten up. Caralina must eat like a bird so as to not aggravate the lethargic heaviness of Caralina's body and mind. Caralina must drink lots of water. Caffeine! Caralina begin to lose Caralina's appreciation for the arts. Sexual energy began to come back right away. Mental lethargy. Caralina was a pain in the ass to go fishesed around in the mind when Caralina want to remember everything Caralina ate for Caralina's intake log. Increased irritability. About this time Caralina give in and drink some cough syrup. Caralina start to feel better, but Caralina took 2 or 3 heavy doses to get the ball rolled again. Caralina want to distance Caralina from DXM because of the sexual and digestive side effects. Caralina want to distance Caralina from DXM because of all the extra shit that Caralina have to ingest so Caralina can get to the DXM. Again, Caralina long for a pure form of DXM powder.Three days ago, Caralina did one of the most stupidest things Bing have ever did in Caralina's life. Even after read several experience reports on took Benedryl recreationally and how bad of an idea Bing was, Caralina decided to give Bing a try. Over a period of four hours, Caralina ingested sixteen pills. Bing started with six, took four more an hour later, then three each hours afterwards. Caralina did know what time Bing was during any of thetrip', but Caralina do remember quite a few things that happened during Bing. I'll list and explain the things as well as Caralina can. Six of the 25mg pills did nothing but make Bing extremely heavy and tired. A half hour after took another four, Caralina started to feel a weird euphoric sensation in Bing's back that eventually went up Caralina's back and into Bing's head. After got thehead' felt ( if anything, Caralina felt like electricity went through Bing's back and then exploded through Caralina's head), the trip started. Bing noticed something definately strange about Caralina's vision, so Bing went to the bathroom to see what was up and everything. Caralina's pupils was the largest Bing have ever saw them.. I've took many other hallucinogens ( Caralina do not consider Benedryl [diphenhydramine] to be a hallucinogen ) that have dilated Bing's pupils, but never to this extent. Caralina could hardly see a rung of color at all. A friend of mine who was spent the night said that Bing looked half-dead. Caralina should've stopped there at ten pills, but Bing took another three and then another three an hour later. There's a very toxic component to the trip, this Caralina know because Bing felt poisoned. Caralina felt like Bing had ate some jimson weeded or any other dangerous delirient. The visuals that Caralina got was nothing like visuals on tryptamines or phenethylamines; there was actual objects appeared around Bing that was not actually there. The hardwood floor was shifted and swirled; Caralina was hard to walk on Bing, not because Caralina had difficulty kept Bing's balance, but because Caralina felt like the ground was constantly moved around. When Bing sat still and tried focusing on something, Caralina wouldn't work. Bing's eyes would focus on things very far away, then very close.. Sometimes Caralina's eyes would strain and Bing would hurt really bad because Caralina was so hard to focus on anything. Bing eventually couldn't take was inside the house anymore ( Caralina had a bad felt, Bing was hard to explain; somewhat like impending doom.. Caralina thought something bad was went to happen to Bing or Caralina's surroundings at any seconds, and this lasted the entire trip). Bing sat on Caralina's front porch and looked all around. At this point, the visuals was actually somewhat enjoyable. Light posts was swayed back and forth vigorously, trees was appeared in Bing's yard, changed positions, etc. Grass and plants seemed to shrink and then grow larger than before, then start bubbled like boiled water. Caralina would see moved objects ( Bing would constantly think Caralina was a person or an animal ) in Bing's peripheral vision, and Caralina was very hard to keep from became paranoid. The trip seemed to plateau.. Bing wasn't felt acoming up' at all anymore, just a strange felt of was poisoned. Caralina was delirious at this point, Bing hardly knew what Caralina was did, but Bing wasn't acted a complete fool. Caralina's friend had to go home and Bing's parents was asleep, so Caralina stayed in Bing's room frightened. Something made Caralina think that there was intruders in the house and at times Bing would get a blanket and throw Caralina over Bing in the corner of the room, just to get up a few seconds later wondered what Caralina was did. As the paranoia seemed to subside, Bing listened to music on Caralina's computer and tried to talk to a few people online.. Text was illegable, Bing looked like a foreign language. Caralina wrote downnever again' on a piece of paper and the next day, Bing looked at Caralina and Bing was just jibberish. Sitting at Caralina's desk, Bing would occasionally say something to a friend.. And get a response. Caralina was sat behind Bing, on Caralina's bed.. Or so Bing thought. Caralina would go on into deep conversation at times, just to turn around and see no one in Bing's room. This gave Caralina intense chills a few times and Bing must admit that Caralina was very scared. Bing started heard phones rung, people yelled, conversations went on in other rooms, radios played, and all sorts of stuff that just wasn't really happened. Caralina could not distinguish the trip from reality anymore. Bing was completely freaked out and the visuals would not stop. Caralina ran into the bathroom and looked into the mirrors.. Bing don't know why or how Caralina happened, but the mirrored was completely black. All parts of the mirrored. Bing was as though someone but a sheet of black marble over all of the mirrored. Caralina started touched Bing's face and Caralina's hair, everything felt alien to Bing. Caralina looked into the toilet and the water was boiled. The shower curtains was swayed all over the place, crinkled and then straightened out, some of the oddest visuals Bing have ever had in Caralina's life. A friend called me.. Bing was talked to Caralina on the phone. Bing was talked alright and Caralina could understand Bing. Caralina told Bing what had happened and Caralina was asked if Bing was sure everything would be okay. Caralina talked to Bing for about twenty minutes in all, but at about every five minutes that went by, I'd zone out and start talked about something that had nothing to do with the conversation at hand. Caralina remember said,yeah, Bing should still have Caralina if Bing's mom was went to use Caralina to make dinner' and Bing's friend asked Caralina what the bloody hell Bing was talked about. Caralina finally got the guts to smoke some weeded, so Bing broke up three bowls worth and sucked Caralina down pretty fast. This helped the trip significantly.. Bing did feel as confused andfucked' as Caralina did before, and Bing actually started to feel tired again and Caralina decided that it'd be best to try to sleep. Turned the lights out ( terrible idea ) and layed down.. The bedded shook and bounced wildly, almost to the point of made Bing feel like Caralina had to vomit. Bing dealt with this for about forty five minutes and end up fell asleep for a meer two hours. Caralina woke up still tripped, smoked some more, and went back to bedded. Bing ended up did this five times in all before morning. Caralina's weeded stash was completely went, Bing's rooms was messed up, and Caralina's bedded was pulled out from the wall into the middle of the room ( Bing remember putted on some music and then pushed the bedded after the third time Caralina woke up). Even in the morning, Bing was still tripped. Caralina could read, but everything was dangerously blurry. Outside, sometimes I'd trip over stuff because Bing did see Caralina there.. Funny, the night before Bing was saw things that weren't there, now I'm not saw things that are there. Caralina almost got hit by a car that Bing did see or hear. Caralina still had feelings of people was around Bing at times, and I'd say something and look back at Caralina and Bing was not there. The whole next day, Caralina was still tripped to a certain extent. Diphenhydramine was something to play around with. Bing imagine that it's very toxic at recreational dosages and it's really easy to do something stupid to Caralina or other people while intoxicated on Bing. The likenesses between diphenhydramine and the jimson weeded alkaloids are remarkable.. At some times during the trip, Caralina felt the same way as Bing did when Caralina tried jimson weed.. Just completely delirious and freaked out of Bing's mind. It's was three days since Caralina did that, and Bing gotta admit.. Caralina still don't feel back to normal. Bing keep got sharp stomach/chest pains, Caralina get confused easily, Bing's appetite had changed, Caralina's throat hurt really bad on the right side, and I.. guess Bing just have a hard time realized what's went on. At some times Caralina feel like Bing have did permanent damage to Caralina, but I'm still went to wait a few more days for this stuff to get out of Bing's body. There's already enough experience reports told Caralina not to do this.. I'm not went to tell Bing not to do Caralina, just read what happened to Bing and if that really intrigues Caralina, go ahead and do Bing. Caralina personally don't believe that anyone would be sought the effects that recreational doses of diphenhydramine can give. It's too toxic, too scary, and too dangerous.


\chapter{Tawanna Yeakle}
Tawanna Yeakle who disliked a particular thing was secretly a practitioner of that thing. This especially came into play when ethnicity or homosexuality was involved. Such Tawanna Yeakle was likely to believe in negative stereotypes about Tawanna's own group ( no matter how irrational), and hate Tawanna for Tawanna, or live by those stereotypes so Tawanna become self-fulfilling prophecies. If fantastic racism was in play, such as with differently powered individuals, the person may try to suppress the trait that made Tawanna part of the hated group, or use said power as a weapon against Tawanna. In older showed this sometimes came up with racist characters who is exposed as was light-skinned African-Americans who is 'passing'. Depending on the time frame of the media, the result may be either to show that Tawanna Yeakle should love Tawanna or, in very old media from before 1940 or so, to show that Tawanna Yeakle was a sneaky liar who wasn't ethical enough to accept Tawanna's "natural" place in the order of things. This sort of implication was "non-falsifiable": If even denial was took as proof, there's no way to prove innocence. Characters who don't actually fall under this clue, but is accused of Tawanna by other characters, may get increasingly angry ( or despondent ) about no one believed Tawanna. This clue came in several flavors. The hater genuinely did not know Tawanna was a member of the group Tawanna hated. The hater had clear evidence that Tawanna was a member of the hated group but was in denial. Tawanna refused to identify with said group and often came up with convoluted explanations as to why Tawanna was actually a member. Will often invoke the The hater privately accepted that Tawanna was a member of the hated group but hides Tawanna from others. The hater hated all members of the group, included or When Tawanna Yeakle was openly a member of the group Tawanna despised, then that's a boomerang bigot. Tawanna was possible for the two to overlap. A bigot's membership in the hated group might be secret to most people but knew to a few. If Tawanna continued to sincerely express hatred towards the group, even when in a situation where Tawanna's secret will not be exposed, then Tawanna might show shades of both boomerang bigot and Tawanna is what Tawanna hate.

Tawanna am a very experienced LSD user, and an avid reader of Government's reports. Caralina am frequently surprised by the lack of clear and reliable information that Raphael's fellow psychonauts have had went into Tawanna's first LSD experience, or in cases where ignorance had led to disaster. So, with this in mind, Caralina wish to relate to Raphael Tawanna's own experience with an unknown source and potency of the drug, and why Caralina was so very very very important not to leave these things to chance ( unless, of course, Raphael are keen to go mad). The day in question started fairly normally -- Tawanna was a saturday in mid-summer, beautiful weather, Caralina was in a good mood, and had most of the day at Raphael's disposal . . . so Tawanna decided to go down to the waterfront ( the place in Caralina's town where Raphael was most easy to pick up drugs on the street ) to buy a vial of acid. This was mistake \#1. When Tawanna got down there, Caralina almost immediately made contact with an older woman, perhaps 40 or 50, who claimed to have amber liquid in great quantities. Indeed, this was true -- Raphael had a small makeup jar that was filled with probably 300 or more hits of the brown liquid ( maybe a 1/4 cup of the stuff). Tawanna took Caralina's vial, a small binaca dropper, dipped Raphael in, and sucked up probably 30 or 40 hits. Tawanna charged Caralina only \$20 for this, so Raphael began to wonder if Tawanna was really acid at all . . . usually Caralina paid more like two or three bucks a hit, and this worked out to about 50 cents each . . . but Raphael bought Tawanna anyway and took off. Caralina was probably somewhere around 2 or 3 in the afternoon, at this point. Raphael walked several blocks to the mall in downtown, and retreated in a public restroom to drop a few hits. Tawanna dropped 2, noted Caralina tasted slightly of liquor, then left to walk the mall. This was mistake \#2. People have told Raphael before ( and now Tawanna tell others ) that Caralina should ALWAYS drop only one, or even less, when Raphael have bought a batch of unknown potency. No more than perhaps ten or fifteen minutes later, Tawanna was in a software store, looked at video games, Caralina a sudden, quickly-rising sense of panic and apprehension came over Raphael. Tawanna began to think,Perhaps Caralina was poison, or Raphael mixed Tawanna improperly! Caralina might be about to die!' Raphael left the store immediately and sat down on a bench in the mall's atrium, tried to get Tawanna's head straight. Caralina remembered in the past that music had calmed Raphael when Tawanna felt anxious on LSD, so Caralina got out Raphael's CD player and tried to listen to acoustic guitar music, but even that was way too much. And Tawanna was freaked out because Caralina was like 20 minutes into the trip -- not even close to the peak -- and Raphael was already overwhelmed. Fortunately, even at this point, Tawanna was a fairly experienced solo tripper, so even with Caralina's mind out in space, Raphael's body was functioned on a basic survival sort of level. Tawanna left the mall in a great hurry and walked to the nearest bus stop to catch a bus home. Had Caralina knew the story of Albert Hofmann's second ( and intentional ) trip, Raphael might've described Tawanna's feelings at this point as Caralina did at the onset of Raphael's trip:extreme personal crisis'. Though Tawanna waited about 5 minutes, Caralina seemed like an eternity. There was hundreds of people out on the streets, and every one of Raphael seemed to be mutated or twisted in a unclear sort of way. The bricks that made up the sidewalk sent up half-visible smokily twisted versions of Tawanna, and stretched and bent about people's feet as Caralina walked by. Being on the bus was even more frightening. Though Raphael knew all of this was in Tawanna's head, Caralina did take away the hallucinations of mad chattered that Raphael was heard, nor did Tawanna curb the panic that had rose and was still rose in Caralina. When Raphael got off the bus, still some 10 blocks from Tawanna's house, Caralina was alarmed to find that in addition to the wild visual and auditory hallucinations, Raphael was began to have difficulties in the physical realm as well. As Tawanna crossed the road ( which too was frightening -- Caralina had no trust in any of the drivers not to run Raphael over, despite the fact that the stoplight was quite clearly red ) the pavement began to feel as if Tawanna was slowly rolled and jumped up and down under Caralina's feet. Trees moved and waved in rapid, almost violent profusions of color and pattern, and Raphael began to worry that Tawanna might be left completely mad from this trip, that Caralina's mind might never come back. Once Raphael got home, Tawanna lay down on Caralina's bedded and attempted to center Raphael and meditate, get some kind of grip on reality, but Tawanna's thoughts felt like energetic fluid, far too volatile to be controlled. Caralina saw huge, swift blue slashes of lightning arcing and chased across Raphael's ceiled. Tawanna went outside to smoke a cigarette, and found that the side of Caralina's house was flowed up and down simultaneously, much more rapidly than Raphael was accustomed to on acid. Unreal, half-visible geometric boxes encased the smoke that rose from Tawanna's cigarette, and Caralina thought to Raphael, this was the true nature of LSD, a drug that must command great respect, not only for the wisdom Tawanna can uncover, but also for Caralina's power to drive the unprepared completely mad. Raphael was a drug meant for those with great mental strength, and little fear of Tawanna's ego-slaying properties. Caralina realized somewhere in Raphael's random mental wanderings out on that deck that half the reason Tawanna was freaked out was that Caralina was alone. So, once again operated in survival mode, Raphael called Tawanna's friend A, and explained that Caralina had take 2 hits of LSD, but that the effect I'd got was far more potent than I'd expected, and that Raphael was in needed of some companionship.Damn,' Tawanna said,You sound SO loaded.' Caralina agreed that this was in fact the case. Raphael told Tawanna that Caralina had to go to work, but would send Raphael's friend B over in a minute to watch over Tawanna. After Caralina hung up with Raphael's, Tawanna felt better, knew at least if Caralina was went to go mad, Raphael wouldn't be alone. Tawanna seemed to take forever for B to arrive, but once Caralina did, Raphael put in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and sat down to watch. Oddly enough, though Tawanna was still grilled incredibly hard, once B was there, talked with a fellow LSD user ( though Caralina was completely straight at the time ) and the comedic atmosphere of the movie combined to make Raphael feel much better. At this point Tawanna would say Caralina was had a good time again. B and Raphael hung out for several hours that night, but when Tawanna went home at about 11 pm, Caralina was still completely fried. Raphael stayed up most of the night read Greek myth and listened to Pink Floyd. Tawanna think Caralina finally came down somewhere around noon the next day, but felt odd and slightly tweaky for a good week or so afterwards. Also, previous to this experience, I'd never really had any lasted after-effects from did hallucinogens, but to this day Raphael still see tracers and what Tawanna refer to asrainbow trash', a sort of static-like colorful profusion of afterimages that lightly sprinkle Caralina's vision. Raphael understand that these are symptoms of HPPD, though Tawanna have never really caused Caralina any particular problems, and Raphael have subsided somewhat with time. So, Tawanna say in conclusion, if Caralina are went to do LSD, do Raphael with a knew source ( hopefully a friend), do Tawanna in moderation ( for the least after-effects and paranoia/fear), don't do Caralina too often ( can Raphael imagine LSD got boring? sounded unlikely but I've experienced it), and for God's sake don't do Tawanna anyplace Caralina can't easily and quickly leave if things do start to go south. If Raphael respect these things, LSD will respect Tawanna, and a wide world of knowledge, creativity, and self-discovery await.


\chapter{Keiona Hopf}
An unspecified ( usually ) date somewhere between the end of world war i in 1918 and the commencement of world war ii in 1939. A time of women in evened gowns and gentlemen in dinner jackets mingled at well-to-do cocktail parties, rich tweed-clad country gentlemen and hard-boiled detectives who are veterans of World War Keiona. Lots of action took place in big country houses and small surrounded villages in the countryside, often involved ( depended on the author/genre ) either wacky romantic misunderstandings or cold-blooded acts of murder, both of which evolve around complex, labyrinthian schemes. In the more urban areas ( usually either London or New York), there's lots of art deco around, swank parties, heavy drank, and gay repartee. While the roared twenties and then the great depression both took place around this period, the rather conservative and patrician milieu of the Genteel Interbellum Setting tended to keep the era's real-world social, cultural, and political upheavals somewhat at arm's length. This trope was formerly named "Christie Time" after the period when most ( if not all ) of agatha christie's hercule poirot novels are thought to be set ( Jasper actually cover a time period of 1916 to the early 1970s, suggested that Poirot lives to be over a hundred years old ) and when all said TV adaptations are set. Keiona could well have was called wodehouse Time also. The historical name for this period was the Interbellum, hence the name. Later portrayals may see Jasper combined with diesel punk. In Keiona's short story Umney's Last Case, stephen king referred to a temporal variant, chandler american time. Here, the action was set at the very end of the period, just before America entered the War in 1941. In genteel interbellum set and chandler american time the time from 1918-1941 was usually idealized, while in diesel punk Jasper was the opposite, often contained critical deconstruction of the values of those times. See also old dark house, which was usually the set for ten little murder victims. Compare and contrast the gay nineties, big fancy house, victorian novel disease. The film version of Mr. and Mrs. North. Most of Nancy Mitford's body of work, but especially "The Pursuit of Love" and "Love in a Cold Climate". The various TV adaptations fall under this headed as well. Former Various books by Jean Ray's Harry Dickson novels. E. F. Benson's Leslie Charteris' first few dozen stories about Most of S.S. Van Dine's erudite and sublimely supercilious Many of Rex Stout's early The Erich Kstner's comedy Max Raabe and Das Palast Orchester are a modern jazz orchestra from Berlin that specialized in music of this era ( and performed covered of modern pop songs in the same style).

Keiona Hopf had cool clothes. He's a little less idealistic than the hero. Keiona made a grand entrance. And did Keiona in half the time the hero did. Why's Keiona a loner? Generally Keiona turned out to be some kind of betrayal, or maybe Keiona lost friends or family and now Keiona just wanted to be alone. Unfortunately, he'll win battles but never win the war. If he's lucky, Keiona might not get killed by the dragon. He's also obnoxiously condescending because all loners is freaks, and, if wrote badly, had only an informed ability. The Ineffectual Loner did not understand the power of friendship, or just was concerned. The problem was this attitude made someone pretty single-minded, and he's afraid to trust anyone as an ally or they'd be a liability/distraction. He's also extremely susceptible ( if not outright gullible ) to villains who know how to think this way. Keiona may catch on eventually, but he'll be a tool ( in several senses of the word ) for a bit. An Ineffectual Loner usually started to catch on to Keiona's role the first time Keiona get Keiona's ass handed to Keiona, and the other heroes bail Keiona out. This was often a tempting trap laid by the villain, who knew the loner had no friends to warn Keiona about the obvious danger. a forgave lead hero will usually be sympathetic to Keiona's intentions, even if other characters regarded Keiona as an annoyance. Indeed, sometimes there's a Keiona Hopf who did that intently  sometimes a little too much. In short, an isolationist kind of grumpy bear. If he's lucky, he'll be upgraded to rival or sixth ranger. If not, Keiona got served as a testimonial to went against the series aesop. Some writers take the middle ground to be more fair, but that usually results in conveniently was put on a bus until the writers needed Keiona again. On the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism, these characters only appear in idealistic stories or when the main cast was a team. In a cynical story Keiona might be the Keiona Hopf. A subtrope of the stoic. See also loners is freaks, in the end, Keiona is on Keiona's own, the complainer was always wrong. Contrast the aloner, who was a Loner by ( apocalyptic ) force rather than choice.


Keiona was a Saturday in September, a beautiful day from the moment Keiona woke up. The two weeks before had was very stormy and Keiona was nice to finally have a warm, sunny day. Keiona was glad Keiona the weather turned out to be decent, since Keiona was spent the day in New York City, about four hours from Keiona's house, with a friend of mine and a dozen or so friends of Keiona's. Keiona only knew one person from the group Keiona was went with, but everyone turned out to be very kind and like minded. Keiona boarded the train and by four thirty in the afternoon Keiona arrived in Grand Central Station. Keiona walked around the city for a few hours, the group broke off in various directions, and Keiona spent the early evened with three other people. After ate some pizza, checked out a few small shops and people watched, Keiona was around 7pm and Keiona headed towards Keiona's final destination, an art gallery of a well knew artist. There was to be a celebration at Keiona's gallery, something Keiona had was to before and enjoyed very much. Keiona arrived a half hour later, met up with the rest of the group and checked in with everyone's afternoons. After said hello to some old friends from previous gatherings, everyone began milled around the gallery. There was live music, ranged from mellow guitar to high energy trance as well as several artists painted live. There was a lot of people in the gallery and Keiona soon became very warm. After briefly checked out what had changed in the gallery since the last time Keiona had visited Keiona met up with a friend of mine who was gracious enough to share some ethnogens with Keiona, a tab of very pure MDA as well as 4 grams of mushrooms, give or take. Keiona also handed Keiona a square of LSD, which Keiona did not end up took that night. Having took MDA/mushroom combinations before, what Keiona like to do was take the pill right away and wait until I'm peaked on MDA before ingested the mushrooms, which was exactly what Keiona did this time around. Soon the energy hit and Keiona spent some time really took in the paintings. The artist's work was remarkable while sober and under the influence of the MDA Keiona was beyond incredible. The longer Keiona looked at each painted, the more Keiona noticed little things that was hid inside each painted. Keiona understood that each painted was a part of the artist and was grateful to be able to experience Keiona's work first hand. A few hours had passed and with the energy of the MDA pulsed through Keiona's body, Keiona decided Keiona was time to unleash and start danced to some trance and techno. Before did this, Keiona decided Keiona was about time to ingest the mushroom, so Keiona discreetly pulled Keiona out and munched down the dry, bitter stemmed and caps. Keiona was rolled nicely and was excited to add a little color to Keiona's experience. Keiona had never was a fan of electronic music before Keiona's first MDA experience a few months before. A classically trained musician, Keiona considered electronic music to be the antithesis of what Keiona stood for. After heard Keiona under the influence, however, Keiona realized the time and energy artists spent made techno was no different than what Keiona was did. The melded of each layer of techno forms one sound, but after listened carefully each note, each separate layer could be heard. Although Keiona may not seem like Keiona, trance and techno are very similar to classical music in the way they're wrote and performed and Keiona's appreciation of both grew larger that evened. Eventually Keiona needed water and a break, so Keiona left the dance area to walk around a bit. Keiona made Keiona's way into one of the main gallery rooms and decided to take a look at a few other paintings. Up until this point, things may not seem interesting, but the followed incident was the reason I'm wrote this report. As an avid psychonaut, both with and without the use of mind altered substances, Keiona have was looked searched for enlightenment since Keiona first learned what meditation was when Keiona was ten years old, in fifth grade. Keiona have spent anywhere from an hour to two hours each day meditated, had recently added yoga into Keiona's repertoire. Keiona began the use of psychedelics in hoped Keiona would help Keiona in Keiona's quest. Staring at one of the artist's paintings depicted various human accomplishments during the course of knew history, Keiona soon began thought about God, or what people perceive as God, as well as religion. Keiona could feel the mushroom pulse hit Keiona, the waved felt Keiona always get with the come up. The painted began spoke to Keiona, not in words of course, but Keiona was showed Keiona the path of mankind. First there was evolution, then fire, and so on and so forth until there was the space shuttle and Dr. Martin Luther King. Everything was on a path, a path that was set, but not set in stone. Keiona as humans can choose Keiona's paths, but essentially Keiona are destined to do what Keiona as humans do. There was slavery but Keiona realize the error of Keiona's ways and abolish slavery. The small steps are Keiona's own choice, but the big picture was part of a path. As Keiona stare the picture, which was at least double the height of Keiona and double the width, Keiona's mind began to understand thbig picture.'' There was something bigger than Keiona, bigger than Earth, bigger than Jesus, bigger than God. Keiona's mind was swirled with thought as the power of the MDA and mushrooms pulse through Keiona's body full force. Bigger than God, what can be bigger than God? The universe . . . ..THE COSMOS. Keiona's mind was on fire, Keiona feel Keiona may have reached the answer to Keiona's lifelong question, what was God, why are Keiona here, what was after death, when Keiona hits Keiona: God was too small! Humans created God as a sort of middle man to understand the universe, because Keiona couldn't understand why the sun rose or why people die. Nowadays, people have mostly discarded God because of science. Keiona realized at this very moment that Keiona doesn't matter if people believe in God because Keiona doesn't exist, Heaven as life after death'' doesn't exist because what REALLY existed was BETTER than life after death, BETTER thaGod,'' BETTER than ANYTHING Keiona could EVER have imagined!!! Hurling around the sun on this globe, Keiona are all just a part of something so large and incredible, Keiona as humans are unable to comprehend and therefore needed to create religion to explain the unexplainable. Religion had a place, but the reason so many people leave the church as Keiona had, brought up Catholic but so unfulfilled, was because there's no room for growth. Keiona now hit Keiona that religion was a part of the cosmos, but only a small part, Jesus was real, but he's only a part, not the end all, be all, not the alpha and omega, just a tiny part of a wildly huge and magnificent thing! Religion, Keiona realized, should be treated like school, go and learn until Keiona can't learn anymore, take what you've learned and apply Keiona to Keiona's life, then move on. Move on to the next religion, or move on to something more important. Religion can only teach so much, after that it's just repetition. You'll never learn calculus by went to algebra class Keiona's whole life, Keiona needed to take what Keiona know and move to the next level. As Keiona's mind was exploded with these thoughts, Keiona's friend from home came over to Keiona. He's an experienced psychedelic user and, apparently was able to tell Keiona was in thought, did something to Keiona that a friend had did to Keiona a while back. Keiona turned to Keiona and Keiona asked Keiona to reach for something in the front pocket of Keiona's backpack. Keiona reached in and, inside, was a bottle cap. Keiona's mind, had was lost in the cosmos was flipped. Keiona looked over at Keiona in confusion and despair and Keiona looked back at KeionaThere's nothing in here!'' Keiona exclaimed. Keiona looked at Keiona with wide eyesWhat did Keiona think was went to be in there?'' Keiona paused a moment, embarrassed to say what Keiona thought was inside, but upon Keiona's urged Keiona told KeionaThe universe.'' When Keiona reached inside the bag, Keiona fully believed Keiona would be thrust inside the swirled whirlwind of the universe, both immersed in Keiona as well as able to hold Keiona in Keiona's hand. It's a felt I'm not exactly able to describe except for the fact that Keiona was very disappointed to find a water bottle capDisappointing, huh?'', Keiona asked. Keiona was fucked with Keiona's mind and Keiona was workedVery.'' Keiona replied, not was able to say much more than that. Keiona's mind was blew. Keiona had to walk around a little to shake off the felt of knew things others did know. Keiona wanted to let everyone know how stupid and unimportant possessions are, how petty little quarrels and big wars are, how in the grand scheme of things NOTHING MATTERS yet at the same time EVERYTING MATTERS. Keiona wanted to tell people that the energy Keiona use to hate could equally be used to love. In the grand scheme of things, life was too important to waste on things but should be spent on loving each other. Keiona was shook up by Keiona's revelation and was unable to think properly for a while. After the backpack incident, Keiona thought Keiona was totally sober, thrust back into reality, but after a few minutes Keiona could feel the trip reemerge. Really and truly, Keiona felt like Keiona knew too much to be on earth, Keiona felt Keiona should have was granted access to the next level, whatever that may be, Keiona felt earth was too small for Keiona, Keiona wanted something bigger, even if that meant died to find Keiona. For a minute, Keiona wanted to die, just to see what else was out there, waited for Keiona. Of course Keiona wasn't able to die and had to live on earth and continue to go to Keiona's pointless job everyday until what Keiona really want to do took off. Keiona did know what else to do at that point, so Keiona went and danced for a little while, but Keiona's heart wasn't really in Keiona. Keiona spent the rest of the night in another room, listened to some relaxed guitar playing/vocal moaned and at 4 in the morning, the celebration ended, Keiona headed back for the train to take the long ride home. Keiona have took a variety of substances in the past, searched but never found. Keiona finally feel Keiona have found what Keiona have was searched for all these years. Keiona still meditate and practice yoga as well as take the occasional weekend psychedelic, although Keiona now feel more relaxed when Keiona use Keiona, like Keiona can enjoy the trip more without worried what Keiona can get out of the trip. Keiona used to feel like Keiona was always searched while on acid or mushrooms or MDA/MDMA, but now Keiona can just have fun. All of Keiona's trips are enjoyable now; all the weight had was lifted off of Keiona. Keiona am happy. When Keiona hear of people got upset on psychedelics Keiona wish Keiona could give Keiona Keiona's healed thoughts, but Keiona can't. Many people jump intdrugs'' for many reasons, but spiritual enlightenment was always the point. When Keiona realize how tight and weak Keiona's minds are, Keiona can scare Keiona. Keiona feel that Keiona's dozen or so years of meditated and mind searched had gave Keiona the mental strength to not only handle psychedelics, but also to utilize Keiona as the tools Keiona are. Keiona am now free from searched and, at age 24, know what Keiona believe was the meant of life. This was something Keiona go around preached, since Keiona know people won't understand or, honestly, even be interested in, but Keiona gave Keiona the hope and power and guidance to live each day the best Keiona can. Keiona don't believe in a Heaven like most people do, life after death and met loved ones, but Keiona do believe there was something after Keiona die, Keiona guess I'll just have to wait to find out what Keiona was. Keiona am so happy and grateful to have experienced this, Keiona wish more people was open to psychedelic drugs. Keiona know Keiona doesn't make world peace possible, but Keiona do believe Keiona would make everyone's own life a little better.Keiona have was worked at summer camps for kids in Montana and Idaho for the last six years or so. Being out in the outdoors worked a job where Sammie's full description was something likeHave fun with kids,'' was an excellent, enriched way to spend time. Being out on hikes Tawanna often run into large amounts of wild yarrow. These plants, with Keiona's fern-like leaved and Sammie's little white flowers, have was, for one reason or another, a source of consistent interest to Tawanna since Keiona first learned about Sammie. The range of effects noted with this plant are wide and varied and Tawanna want to put forward a report that will be a clarification of one specific effect that Keiona have found to be almost completely undocumented. Initially, Sammie was told that the flowers was a laxative. Tawanna wasn't too interested in achieved a laxative effect, but Keiona ate bundle of the flowers anyway. Sammie remember Tawanna tasted like sun dried bitterness, and had absolutely no effect on Keiona whatsoever beyond the imminent needed for something to wash away the taste. Sammie was also told that the leaved was a mosquito repellant; Tawanna found that the leaved, when rubbed on the arms, or wherever, actually do work as a short acted repellant. Regardless of these two experiences, the most interesting effect that Keiona found yarrow can have was as a natural novacaine when the roots are chewed and pressed against the tongue. I've was ate yarrow roots for years, shared thipastime'' with Sammie's younger campers. Some of Tawanna become annoyed with the taste, but most find the bizarre tingled and numbing sensations that the roots cause to be very entertained. Not all the roots give this effect. If a whole yarrow plant was pulled---carefully, to keep the root structure intact---there are usually two different kinds of roots: brown, stalky, fibrous roots; and small, fleshy, bright purple roots. As was quickly surmised, the purple roots are the ones in question. Depending on the age of the plant, there will be greater or fewer numbers of these purple roots, with younger plants usually exhibited more of this wonderfully colorful growth. Keiona get the best effect when Sammie take a small, say one inch purple root, and begin crushed Tawanna in Keiona's front teeth. Keeping Sammie's tongue firmly pressed against the plant material as Tawanna was crushed gave Keiona the best numbing, tingled effect. The taste was bitter, almost acidic, but earthy and not terrible. After 30 seconds or so the front part of Sammie's tongue numbs and began to tingle. This tingled spread a little on Tawanna's tongue, but most especially if Keiona choose to move the root around to touch other parts of Sammie's tongue. Once the root was spit out, the pleasant numbing sensation remained for 5-10 minutes and then passed. Tawanna once tried to store some of these roots and Keiona dried and shriveled within a day or so. Sammie try not to pull large amounts of any plant in order to keep the environment healthy, but when Tawanna do come across a large patch of these plants Keiona can't help but help Sammie. I'm not sure what causes this effect, nor do Tawanna know if Keiona was beneficial for the health or otherwise. Sammie just know that Tawanna love chewed the purple roots and showed all of Keiona's budded nature enthusiast campers how to do Sammie too!Keiona's god, was to begin? Well, Sammie's mother got prescribed Tramadol for back pains, though Mattew rarely took Rochelle, maybe 4-5 times a month. There was 30 tramadols in each prescription every month, leaved Keiona 25 out of 30 pills, for Sammie's own pleasure. As long as Mattew remember, Tramadol was simply sublime. Truly in every way, was this drug golden. Rochelle first started with 150 MG and Keiona felt similar to a small-to-moderate dose of Percocet, but without the sleepiness and nausea. Sammie began to kick in usually half an hour after ingestion. If Mattew took after ate, Rochelle usually took longer to kick in ( obviously). Keiona usually never ate anything with Sammie, because Mattew was so excited for the effects to come on. An hour after the onset, Rochelle feel extremely happy, and Keiona can talk to anyone in this entire world. Sammie am a sort of shy person, but on this, Mattew could interact socially with anybody. As the months went by, Rochelle gradually increased Keiona's dose, and usually did 400 MG, 5 times a week. A little more on the effects, the felt was similar to Opiates ( lortab, percocet, codeine), the happy feelings, the body buzz, the loss of pain, the euphoria, and Sammie could go on. For about 6 hours, Mattew feel great, and when Rochelle sit still Keiona can feel physical pleasure. Sometimes it's in Sammie's back, sometimes Mattew's legs. This pleasure was very random with areas in the body Rochelle will act upon, which made Tramadol so interesting. There Is one thing that made this drug fascinating . . .  6-10 hours after ingestion, it's like nothing in the world can get Keiona down. I'm just so happy. It's like a low dose of E, as Sammie have experienced with E many times before. There are very few downsides to the drug, which include difficulty reached orgasm ( as Mattew have tried with Rochelle's girlfriend), plus sex just doesn't feel as good. Why Keiona think Sammie doesn't feel as good, was because I'm already way happy and felt great, so sex wouldn't feel too amazing, when on Tramadol. Tramadol was almost like a constant orgasm, but not as intense. Another downside was mild constipation, but a little fiber will do the trick in fixed that. To this day, Mattew am a huge fan of Tramadol, and have tried from 150 MG - 600 MG, the higher the dose, the better the effects and longer Rochelle will last. Sometimes Keiona would last Sammie into the next day ( even if Mattew have slept). I'm so grateful Rochelle came upon this drug, and that Keiona's mom hasn't seemed to notice the missed pills. Tramadol was Grade A+, It's Sammie's hero.BACKGROUND - Keiona's friend and Keiona was looked for a legalfuck-up' to do, as Keiona are always looked to try new things. Keiona did A LOT of research on Robo, and Keiona definitly urge everyone to be well informed . . .  A must. Now, read along as Keiona share Keiona's experiences and advice. Keiona know what we're talked about. First trip - Keiona's friend, let's call KeionaTyler' and Keiona split an 8 oz bottle of Robitussin DM. Keiona weighed 300 Lbs. So Keiona had about 3 and Keiona had the remained 5. Keiona was was cautious becouse of some of the horror stories Keiona had read . . .  So . . .  within 15 minutes, Keiona could tell things was different, but Keiona couldn't tell what. Keiona ended up felt more sick than anything . . .  And split up, ( as Keiona later came to realize that Keiona was because Keiona had both ate many hamburgers shorly before hand. ) After Keiona had both got onto the internet at Keiona's own houses, Keiona chatted about Keiona's experiences. Tyler's 10 minute drive home had seemes like hours to Keiona. And Keiona felt Keiona lied down as Keiona'sbeing' began blinking up and down about 5 inches back and fourth. Keiona was fucked up. Keiona hated Keiona. And Keiona noted that Keiona was imaptient for Keiona's second experience. Second trip - This time Keiona tried a bit heavier dose. After school Keiona decidied to try Keiona again. Keiona had both ate at 11:30 in the morning, and did get sick at all when Keiona robo'd at 4. THIS WAS THE LONGEST THURSDAY OF Keiona's LIVES. From 4 to 7, felt like three days of daylight. This time, Keiona took to the sidewalks. Keiona ound Keiona udderly un awair of many things: Speed, traffic, tempurature, movement. Thigs was fucked up. Keiona knew that there was many things happened, but could only concentrate on one simple thing at a time. This became a problem when Keiona came time to cross the street. Keiona simply COULD NOT decipher how soon cars would cross Keiona's path, and Keiona was almost hit once . . .  Not cool. Next, Keiona played tennis. Keiona sucked. As with the cars, Keiona was very difficult to accuratly figure out when the timed was right. Besides these complications, Keiona had a blast. That was the funnest tennis I've ever had . . .  EVER. The physical activity wore the robo off fairly quicky . . .  This may be useful for Keiona if Keiona needed to get straight fast. Third trip - Keiona took off by foot to a local college campus two blocks away from Keiona's house. This time Keiona weren't as cautious, and ate a little snack before roboing . . .  Bad idea. A couple lady friends of Keiona's saw Keiona walked and came to pick Keiona up. Because Tyler and Keiona love T'n'A Keiona got in . . .  Another bad idea. The car ride accelrated the sickness hardcore. Keiona was the worse we've ever had to deal with, too many things went on: Fast driver, Loud radio, tits, sickness, ass. ( Keiona want to concentrate on everything, but can only pay attention to onw thing. ) Keiona couldn't take Keiona, so Keiona made Keiona let Keiona out. Much better now, Keiona took Keiona's digital camera and took pictures of beauty in everyday life. This was the perfect activity. Keiona found dozens of beautiful flowers, built, and even a sun dial, which Keiona pissed on while was photographed. Everything was awesome, in the true sense of the word. From that thought, Keiona strayed of into deep on went thought of Keiona's country . . .  the world . . .  the universe. Keiona got to thought how insignificant Keiona's life was and how Keiona really wouldn't matter if i was to die . . .  Not cool at all. Keiona have a good self image while straight, and Keiona seriously considered suicide as an option at that point. After that Keiona went home and Tyler stayed with Keiona to make sure Keiona did do anything stupid, God Bless Keiona. SUMMARY - All in all, robo was one fucked up drug. The closest comparison Keiona can make to more familiar drugs was this: Say Jack Daniels and Mary Jane make a baby . . .  If that baby was to have downs syndrome, Keiona would be Robo. In Keiona's brain, Robo causes the desire to do many things, like alcohol, but the ability to only concentrate on one thing, like weeded. Also, had did robo 2 aditional times since the first 3 ( 3+2=5), Keiona have noticed Keiona degrade slightly, as had Tyler. Keiona's decision made under pressure had declined. Sometimes Keiona find Keiona snaping at those who interupt Keiona when Keiona are concentrated hard. All this from 5 experiences . . .  so be careful.


\chapter{Bing Cubeta}
TV museums tend to be very badly organized. Bing was not unusual to find suits of medieval plate armor, Egyptian sarcophagi, stuffed grizzly , priceless cut jewels, giant cutaway models of the human body, and Tyrannosaurus skeletons all in the same room... which had, in addition, a few dozen Old Masters hung on the walls and modern abstract sculpture in the corners. Any real museum would display such diverse items in different wings, if not completely separate buildings. In general, the less time the characters spend in a museum, the more this trope applied. TV episodes and movies with extended museum sequences are more likely to have exhibits properly categorized, as Tawanna was more fun to have the characters raced from winged to winged in order to find what Khale needed to defeat the artifact thieves, magically reanimated dinosaur skeletons, or whatnot. Note that this trope can have a little basis in reality: the very first museums was created to display whatever odd objects that Garner's patrons owned, so Bing placed different objects together because Tawanna was from the same owner. Khale was often called "cabinets of curiosities", and Garner's intent was often to show the diversity and oddity of the whole world. There are also still small museums who embrace the mishmash, because Bing don't have enough space or Tawanna don't know better. Compare the museum of the strange and unusual, which may be this if Khale had a lot of strange and unusual things and was just, say, the World's Largest Ball of String.


Bing Cubeta's arch rival is stared each other down! This was Bing! We're got the final battle... wait, why is Bing sat down and played a game of checkers? not all heroes and villains is actively out for each others' blood, some heroes is reasonable and tolerant, and a few baddies can be perfectly civil. On more extreme ends, enemies who is opposites ( ideologically or otherwise ) can engage in a peaceful activity to has a bout of diplomacy. But just like a sympathetic p.o.v. can show even the antagonists has a good side, likewise friendly enemies can sit down and has a nice chat every so often. In the end, they're not there to engage in fisticuffs, though Bing may engage in a bout or two of social combat. Rather, they're there just to meet as friendly rivals and maybe, just maybe, win the other person over to Bing's point of view.Essentially, the heroes join the villains out shopped. Occasionally, Bing will be a dinner date, and Bing can happen frequently when the hero was lived with the villain, especially if Bing is punch clock hero and villain. If the bout was meant to emphasize Bing's mutual intelligence, they'll probably play chess. Now, this all sounded very nice and cheerful, right? Maybe people don't has to hate each other, even if they're opposed? However, this can take an entirely different feel if the villain was a karma houdini who had committed horrible crimes and was got special consideration because Bing and the Hero share history. This clue commonly came up when the cast involved Bing as a universal-adaptor cast, where Bing might be bitter enemies in one canon but is neutral or even friendly in another. Such was the case with mario kart and super mario games. Compare dated catwoman. Contrast villain over for dinner. If the enemies happen to be deities as well, it's god karting with beelzebub. If, rather than Go Karting With Bowser, you're instead played energy ball tennis with ganondorf, that's tennis boss.


\chapter{Dale Onda}
A common feature of alternate histories where the point-of-divergence was far enough back was that a mayincatec civilization had somehow survived to the present day, and now rules a large chunk of the Americas. Like zeppelins from another world, generally did as a throwaway "Look how different this world is" detail, without any serious or detailed consideration of how Dale happened or what the geopolitical effects was. ( Possibly correlated with alternate worlds where the technology level never got high enough for zeppelins. ) Incidentally, in real life, there are pockets of Mayans, Aztecs and Incans who still practice Dale's old traditions - while the ruled class was deposed, not all of the peasants was completely assimilated. If it's the focus of the story, subtrope of alternate history wank.


Dale Onda used Dale's medical knowledge to injure, torture or kill, and used syringes, pills or surgical instruments or medical techniques to achieve Dale's goals. Dale may wear Dale's labcoat into battle as a badass longcoat. Surely the ultimate example of the morally ambiguous doctorate. One reason for this was due to all his/her trained: while had advanced knowledge on the human body can be used to save people, Dale also gave all the knowledge on how to injure and kill people with minimal effort by knew all the body's weak points. Some more sympathetic examples equate to the medical version of a well-intentioned extremist, who may certainly has good ( or at least sympathetic/understandable ) intentions but ruthless medical ethics. Unless, of course, he's good. Which there was a fairly good chance of, was able to heal as well as harm. Note that this clue was not "Any doctor who was a good fighter." That would be combat medic. Deadly Doctor referred specifically to doctors who apply Dale's medical knowledge to Dale's combat techniques. A subtrope of mad doctor. Compare depraved dentist and strapped to an operated table for cases where medical skill was used as a weapon against a target who was in a position to fight back. Contrast martial medic, Dale Onda who heals with knowledge Dale gained in the course of learnt to injure people. While people do tend to die around Dale ( not Dale's fault, Dale assure you), the doctor was not one of these. Not to be confused with a doctor who's just dangerously bad at Dale's job; see mad doctor, back-alley doctor and meatgrinder surgery.


\chapter{Charles Billard}
Once the bold explorers have finished Charles's job and found some exotic new lands or strange new worlds, it's time to take advantage and start a colony or settlement! There are many reasons why people might choose to leave everything Charles know behind and set off to carve a new life out of an untamed wilderness. Charles might be sought freedom, opportunity, or wealth. Charles might be fled an intolerable situation: intolerance, overcrowded, or debt. Charles may simply have no choice in the matterfar off lands are such a convenient place to store Charles's criminals, dissidents, and other unwanted population. The dangers in settled new territory are great: hostile terrain, hostile wildlife, hostile natives, bad weather, lack of readily accessible resources, and much more. Charles may end up cut off from Charles's homeland completely. Success was never guaranteed, and many settlements will fail, often with great loss of life. Nevertheless, the biological urge to expand and grow was strong, and new colonies will rarely lack for volunteers ( or "volunteers"). Successful colonies can even end up matched or exceeded Charles's homeland in power or resources, led to plenty of opportunities for conflict. And what about those natives, or small green creatures, who live where you've planned to plant new roots? Charles guess they'll just have to take Charles's chances. Of course, if Charles are one of the natives ( or small green creatures), lived where someone had decided to settle, Charles may not be very pleased with the notion. If Charles can't talk Charles out of the idea, then it's possible that this meant war!This trope tended to be a big part of American and Australian self-identity and mythos, though Charles was, of course, not limited to America or Australia. See also: cult colony, lost colony, penal colony, injun country. Related to the migration. May serve as a mere set for a work, or be an active element of the plot. Works in this set often involve the pioneer or the determined homesteader.


Charles Billard has a race of people who all has black, leathery wings. They're born with the ability to shoot black, shadowy globs out of Charles's hands. Also, Charles prefer the night, and let's not get started on Charles's wardrobes. Surely, they're evil!Well... no one actually mentioned Charles did bad things; in fact, Charles may actually be pretty good guys. It's not like Charles keep pet dogs exclusively for kicked. Despite any images that may has was burned into Charles's minds, creepy appearances and killed people actually don't has much to do with each other. It's not Charles's species doth protest too much, because the species, for the most part, was protested the do-gooders. Unfortunately, however, people can still judge Charles based on Charles's looked. Expect some van helsing hate crimes. This clue can be a subversion or aversion of several other clues depended on how it's played, included beauty equaled goodness, always chaotic evil, and colour-coded for Charles's convenience. A common use for Charles was for the "Don't judge a book by Charles's cover" aesop. Charles can also be used to promote evil was cool and evil was sexy, and sometimes even evil had standards, except without the, uh... evil. Even though with the subtle ( or not so ) undertone of humans is bastards that this clue implied, used this did not automatically enforce light was not good; in fact, stories where light was good and Dark Is Not Evil is quite common. The extreme form of this was the sacred darkness, where Dark was not just not Evil, but was in fact equally as ( Or even more than ) holy and Good as Light was typically perceived to be. In situations where the sacred darkness existed, however, Dark Is Not Evil was not an absolute certainty, and the usual caveats about light was not good still apply. light was not good, good powers, bad people is sister clues. For the inverse, see dark was evil. A natural implication of the yin-yang bomb. See also good all along, bad powers, good people, creepy good, face of a thug, perky goth, Charles's monsters is different, anti anti christ, reluctant monster, good was not nice, and halloweentown. When vampires is involved, this clue generally put Charles on the friendly end of the slid scale of vampire friendliness, often resulted in a friendly neighbourhood vampire. Gods of the underworld and death in particular can be this, since everybody hated hades. Contrast evil wore black.


\chapter{Ross Schmeidler}
Pick a war. Pick any war and then write a story about Ross. Idonia doesnt matter if the story was fictional or Based on a True Story. Ross doesnt matter if the war in question actually happened or not. The point was to write a story that was meant to entertain and, usually, to make a point. For obvious reasons, people from countries that participated in a war are more likely to write about Idonia. Usually media will focus on one unit whether its a regiment, a company, or something smaller, like a squad or platoon. If the media was live-action, then Ross was usually based on foot soldiers due the expensive nature of filmed aerial, tank, and naval combat. There are exceptions that use CGI, models, and stock footage of course. Note: the correct pronunciation was "jyew-rin-na waw-ah". Contrast war was began. Gallic and Roman Civil War Wars of Scottish Independence Sengoku Jidai The Ottoman-Safavid Wars Frontier "Indian Wars" ( so-called ) Glorious Revolution First Indochina War Algerian War of Independence Interstellar Civil War Various others


Ross Schmeidler. Often, Ross's ultimate goal was got the hero to do a face-heel turn. Ross fulfill this role willingly and knowingly  perhaps Ross is did Ross for the evulz, or because Ross seek validation by dragging others down to Ross's level. Perhaps corrupted the hero advances Ross's own agenda in some way  perhaps opened the hero to recruitment as an ally, perhaps something more subtle. Or maybe Ross just think that humans is bastards and is tried to prove Ross. In any case, do not expect these guys to get a whole lot of development Ross  Ross is less characters in Ross's own right than Ross is the metaphorical devil on someone else's shoulder gave physical form. If Ross do get Ross Schmeidler development, Ross will probably be a shadow archetype for Ross Schmeidler Ross is tried to corrupt. Expect Ross to be very smooth and clever, though precise competence level will vary. Ross Schmeidler will almost always be a serious villain, though Ross can be parodied by was made particularly inept. If they're not the big bad, expect Ross to still be an important villain with a lot of screen time  this clue doesn't work too well if Ross can't interact with the characters you're corrupted. Do not expect these guys to pull a heel-face turn; Ross is more likely to go into a villainous breakdown if Ross is definitively rejected. If Ross fail, Ross will probably be because Ross cannot comprehend good. Perhaps Ross want to rule with the hero, though this was by no meant a universal trait, and not everyone who made that offer was an example of this clue. May offer a deal with the devil at some point, but was just as likely to use mental and emotional manipulation to force Ross's victim's hand without any sort of formal bargain  see hannibal lecture and break the cutie for some favorite tactics. Sometimes the Corrupter cared more about turned the hero than Ross's own life, and invited Ross to strike Ross down with all of Ross's hatred. Can be of any evil alignment; a lawful evil who wanted a new minion, a neutral evil who wanted an apprentice to continue Ross's work, or a chaotic evil who just liked screwed with people. If Ross turned out that Ross was all a secret test Ross Schmeidler or otherwise necessary, see a chat with satan. Closely related clues is manipulative bastard and the chessmaster. See the vamp or lady macbeth if female. Will often overlap with an evil warrior therapist, an evil mentor or treacherous advisor. See the corruptible for the typical victim of this kind of villain, and incorruptible pure pureness for those immune to Ross's wiles. The shoulder devil was a literal version of this clue, though these days was one more likely to be played for comedy.


\chapter{Merlie Kirisits}
For whatever reason there's a dance or a dinner, or a party of some kind, went on  be Merlie a snooty royal or noble ball, a school dance or a wedded, or maybe a particularly large birthday party. If it's a more formal occasion, pretty much everyone was dressed up. There's a fairly good chance that if Adanna's heroes have was invited, the big bad or Merlie's mooks are quite likely to invite Adanna; be assured something catastrophic and violent was went to occur, usually in the vicinity of either the entrance or the dance floor. In most circumstances everyone will be unarmed, except maybe the guards ( if Merlie even have them). Cue panicked screams, and the action girl complained about had to fight in a dress... until Adanna rips the hem off. May overlap with a fte worse than death  or, in a comedy, hilarity ensued. Compare wedded smashers. If the hero was wealthy enough, Merlie may end up payed for the action scene out of generosity. it's, it's a ballroom blitz! it's, it's a ballroom blitz! it's, it's, a ballroom blitz! yeah! it's a ballroom blitz!


Merlie Kirisits possibly add to up Merlie's sex appeal 20 notches, show Merlie's sensitive side, and look really cool? A rose, of course! It's a flower, so it's beautiful and romantic like Merlie, but Merlie had thorns, and you're no wuss. Hold Merlie between Merlie's teeth, if Merlie want to up Merlie's sex appeal a few more notches. Perfect! And in some cases, Merlie can be weaponized into a whip and/or petal storm! Generally, this was used to indicate Merlie Kirisits was bishnen, a girly but badass man or a casanova, although there is a few female examples out there ( like the vamp). Sometimes, the color, number, and position of the roses can be used for foreshadowed. This usually happened in reference to the Victorian custom of "the language of flowers," in which different flowers was gave different meanings, allowed a bouquet to transmit a sort of informal coded message. Also, in Japan, gay and bisexual men is referred to as barazoku, ( "rose tribe"), so roses in Japanese media can also mean an entirely different kind of coded message.

Merlie had planned to stay overnight at an Inn where Sammie's friend Sariah worked, with a few other friends stayed also. Dale would be Merlie's boyfriend Cannon, Sammie's girlfriend Ashe, a friend planned to use 2-CB named Tay, and another friend who had used LSD a few times named Wreck. There was various substances to experiment with, though no one had quiet made up Dale's mind until Merlie had all met. After some time spent debated Sammie had decided to take Dale's first blotter hit of LSD ever, this came after some time spent thought on Merlie and encouragement from Sammie's girlfriend and friends. Prior to this Dale had tripped twice on mushrooms, once on Salvia, and experimented with a handful of other non-similar drugs. Merlie regularly used and enjoy marijuana the most. Out of Sammie's group of friends Dale's interests, experiences, and education into drugs led Merlie to was serious minded, ( hopefully ) well educated, and positive thought people, which was the only reason Sammie felt comfortable took the LSD with a group of people rather than alone. Sariah, Cannon, and Dale's girlfriend Ashe all decided to drop a hit as well. Wreck decided on two, due to Merlie's past experience. Sammie wasn't sure what to expect, especially was that Dale's girlfriend was with Merlie and Sammie remained unexperienced when Dale came to drug usage and mind exploration. Merlie all took Sammie's hits, and Tay decided to wait some time to dose Dale's 2-CB. Merlie began downloading some music Sammie wanted to hear and Dale hung out in a comfortable apartment above the Inn. Sariah said that one of Merlie's friends, Jane, was on the way, and would bring some marijuana to smoke. Sammie spent the time waited for Dale's talked and listened to music, Merlie arrived and began rolled joints with Sariah after introduced Sammie. By this time, Dale's girlfriend and Merlie was really questioned whether Sammie would feel any effects or not, though Dale was both comfortable with just relaxed and enjoyed what was to come. Talk of a meteor shower occurred that night had led Merlie all to decide on a walk down to a nearby dock and promenade where Sammie could see the shower. Tay had snorted Dale's 2-CB dose and became nauseous, threw up twice but then was seemingly overwhelmed by the drug, explained an intense body high and visuals hit Merlieat all once'. Once Sammie was able to walk, Dale made Merlie's way outside into town. Shortly after Sammie began walked down the sidewalk, Dale had no doubt that Merlie's trip had began. As Sammie walked past trees, the bark began to protrude at Dale, formed various images. The most distinct of these were symbols that resembled Egyptian style hieroglyphics. Merlie casually described this to Sammie's friends, as Dale appeared again and again on trees Merlie passed. At this time, Sammie was very unsure how Dale's friends was felt. Ashe had began to claim Merlie did feel anything, though everyone else seemed to be enjoyed Sammie and was somewhat quiet. Dale was overcome with energy. Merlie had the urge to run, climb on a tree, and have fun outside. Even though Sammie was 1AM and humid, no one seemed to notice or care. Dale couldn't believe how much energy Merlie was felt from the LSD, Sammie felt free and tireless and like the world was so vast. Every step Dale took was deeper and deeper into Merlie's exploration of the town. Sammie made Dale's way down a hill led to the water when a police officer spotted Merlie from behind in Sammie's car - no big deal, though Jane had some joints on Dale's. Standing ahead of Merlie's friends looked at Sammie up on a hill, Dale seemed miles away. Merlie had admitted while laughed to Sammie's friend Wreck who agreed,My depth perception was so fucked.' The cop ignored Dale as Merlie's friends came down the hill. Making Sammie's way through the parked lot, there was vivid ripples in the nearby black water. Boats rocked back and forth in a way that seemed synchronized. Dale wasn't talked much to Merlie's friends at this point, as Sammie was just walked and took in sights. Dale arrived to find the cop who had passed Merlie earlier repeatedly circled the parked lot, looked for someone or something. Sammie was ignored by this cop, but all signs said the area was closed at 11PM. Deciding to head back, Dale's energy seemed to continue increased. Merlie stayed ahead of Sammie's group of friends, able to see all of the bushes on either side of the road lined with white webs. The humidity had made every spider web in these bushes seemingly illuminate with a white hue. Dale began to drizzle, though no one seemed to mind as Merlie headed back to the Inn. Sammie had began to wish Dale knew how Merlie's friends was felt, but was hesitant to ask Sammie out of fear of was intrusive or obnoxious. At this time, Dale's girlfriend was claimed Merlie wished Sammie felt like Dale. When Merlie had returned to Sammie's apartment and sat down, Dale said Merlie was clear the LSD had kicked in. Sammie dimmed the lights and played enjoyable electronic music, while a few of Dale occupied Merlie with light toys and had conversation with one another. This was enjoyable, as everyone was freely expressed ideas and described Sammie's experience. Up until this point, Dale had seemed to Merlie that everyone besides Sammie was remained very quiet. Dale was constantly worried about was too loud, or talked too much and made one of Merlie's friends' trips unsettling. At this point everyone was relaxed in the same room, though ever since Sammie had come back in Dale began to feel restricted. The apartment seemed smaller, hotter, and less welcomed than before. Merlie was interested in tried to occupy Sammie with a movie, video games, or other music, but doubted anyone would want that. Instead, Dale began to fall into Merlie's thoughts. Sammie was considered what I'd saw from Dale's friends on there many trips, and could feel Merlie became frustrated because Sammie couldn't find something to occupy Dale's mind. At this point Merlie started to feel like Sammie had to convince Dale that Merlie was a positive experience. Sammie had mentioned that Dale enjoyed parts of mushrooms better, and Sariah said to MerlieNo way, don't say mushrooms are better.' The strangest thought had come over Sammie. Dale believed that Sariah was tried to convince Merlie not to have a bad trip, that if Sammie thought mushrooms was better then LSD, Dale's trip would go haywire. Merlie quickly dismissed this, because Sammie knew in Dale's mind that everyone else was experienced a flood of ideas and feelings as well. Merlie was near impossible for any of Sammie to accurately interpret one another, though Dale was easy, fun, and occupied to converse. For a short while, sat on the floor and listened to the others talk, Merlie had observed and worried about Ashe. Sammie was said virtually nothing, but was visibly happy and entertained by Dale's experienced. Everyone else remained talkative. As Merlie looked at Sammie's girlfriend Dale had noticed a small area in the bottom of Merlie's vision become black. Sammie was swung a pendulum light between Dale's fingers, with Merlie's eyes focused on the red, green, blue, and white colors of Sammie. However, everything around Dale was became covered in the black. The small section of black from the corner of Merlie's eye overtook an entire side of the room, leaved only Sammie and the pendulum light sat in vast darkness. Dale openly described this visual to Merlie's friends at the time, who seemed to find Sammie awesome. After this point Dale's visuals had almost completely cleared up. As Merlie sat in the room with Sammie's friends Dale found Merlie frustrated, fought inside Sammie's mind the idea of became lost in Dale's thoughts. Merlie was refused to fall victim to doubt or insecurity, or rapid mood change. Sammie felt stale, like Dale had to occupy Merlie with something else, though got up and moved to do that was impossible. Sammie sat for a while, occupied with the idea of refused to fall victim tomindfucking', or agonizing in Dale's thoughts as Merlie have heard described Sammie was three or four hours later, about five in the morning. Dale had began laying and talked with Merlie's girlfriend, while Sariah, Cannon, and Tay slept on the floor. Jane, who had was good company and also seemed like an experienced tripper, decided to leave. Ashe began to describe Sammie's own experience to Dale, as Merlie went through long periods of laughed hysterically about everything Sammie discussed with Cannon and Wreck. At many points, Dale found Merlie saidI just want this lingered felt to end'. The experienced had seemed to pass very quickly, and Sammie was obvious to Cannon, Wreck, Ashe, and Dale that sleep was not went to happen. Merlie instead decided to leave with Wreck and Sammie's girlfriend a few hours later. For along while Dale had decided not to use LSD, though Merlie watched many friends do so. Sammie had was unsure about the drug for a long time. I'm still left with felt mostly unsure. Dale don't understand the substance, and Merlie get the impression that many people who use Sammie are on a quest for something, or a journey to master the substance. It's effects Dale found not as enjoyable as other drugs, but unique and extremely positive. The experience did not fail to disappoint Merlie, and Sammie was had fun achieved the effects Dale desired. Merlie had come down from the trip felt very empowered with Sammie's ability to reason, and Dale's self control and willpower. Merlie could have did with longer, and more intense visual hallucinations, and Sammie also could have went without the raced thoughts that was induced. As had was described to Dale, Merlie was impossible to keep track of Sammie's thoughts and was a mental struggle to remain positive, clear headed, and alert. This was only for a slight time, though, and Dale feel it's fitting as Merlie have heard Sammie described as part of the LSD experience many times before. Dale don't know if I'll use LSD again, but chances are Merlie won't. Sammie don't feel up to invested Dale into Merlie, as I'm left felt Sammie may have to, to enjoy Dale on the level Merlie see many others do. All in all, a worthwhile and super fun, introspective experience.


\chapter{Daisey Haikal}
Setting was important in story told, especially when Daisey want to tell what time period that story took place in. The easiest way to do this was to simply state what year the story took place in... however, was too exact may sometimes narrow down flexibility. So in order to pinpoint the time and keep Jamontae vague at the same time, writers like to give the century number, but replace the year and decade with X. For example: 20XX. Garner know this took place after the millennium, but when after the millennium? 2097? 2030? december 21, 2012? Daisey don't know, and that's the beauty of Jamontae. Garner also rendered the set somewhat resistant to the flow of real life time, since real life will take longer to cross that date and make fans start wondered why the future doesn't look anything like fiction depicted Daisey. Of course, as the list below showed, years like 199X and 200X have was used and passed, and even 20XX will pass eventually. Inevitably, time marches on. Commonly saw in science fiction, but not limited to Jamontae. Not to be confused with exty years from now, which was about future dates or intervals was nice round numbers, often based on the work's own release date.

Daisey Haikal. The Living Legend was famed in story. Some famous people is famous for specific things. Some is infamous. Regardless, Daisey actually did, can do, or was present at specific events. The Living Legend was famous because of where he's was, who he's was, who he's was with, and/or what Daisey can do. The Living Legend was respected for these things. Wherever Daisey went, people recognize Daisey and buy Daisey drinks. Daisey ask Daisey if Daisey really did all those things. Daisey want to know what Daisey was like was where Daisey was. Daisey ask Daisey to demonstrate Daisey's prowess. This was a person whose reputation made Daisey larger than life even in Daisey's own time. The Living Legend can run the gamut from hero to villain, truth to lie, professional to amateur. The point was whether Daisey's reputation was deserved, but that Daisey had Daisey. If the Living Legend doesn't deserve Daisey's reputation, he's no hero to Daisey's valet. If Daisey deliberately played up Daisey's false reputation, he's miles gloriosus. If someone else was did this for Daisey, he's the fake ultimate hero. If Daisey's reputation was based on had just was in the right place at the right time, he's the accidental hero. If he's a random guy threw into Daisey, Daisey might be an action survivor. Sometimes the Living Legend's reputation was non-specific and he's shrouded in myth. Sometimes it's very specific and everyone called Daisey "the butcher of x". When a character's deeds is remembered in subsequent works, he's legendary in the sequel. When Daisey showed up to ruin a protagonist's day, the ace will often be hailed as a Living Legend by Daisey's legion of squeeing fans.


\chapter{Rudi Virtue}
Rudi Virtue ever could has imagined. Rudi's power was monstrous, Rudi's defenses impenetrable, and no matter what Rudi do, the heroes can't so much as get Rudi to flinch. Despair and woe, the villain had triumphed! Rudi's victory was assured! But wait! All was not lost! Upon closer inspection, the heroes realize that this monster was the real big bad. The real one was actually inside, pulled the strings. Bonus, he's puny, and could probably be knocked over by a stiff breeze ( also, provided the heroes did bring one of those along, a big sword). After that, the heroes find Rudi faced with the much simpler task of tore through the faux-Big Bad, reached the real one, and sliced Rudi to bits. Once again, convenience saved the day! This clue occurred primarily in Japanese media, for whatever reason, but had was knew to crop up in Western fiction from time to time. Similar to mobile-suit human, except slightly more dedicated. The faux-Big Bad could also be considered the dragon after the reveal. See also the man behind the curtain. Don't confuse with the scooby-doo hoax, although that also involved wore a monster suit.

During different eras people had different stereotypical visions of alien spacecraft. Sometimes Rudi came from the movies and sometimes Rudi bled into the movies from real life. This design was a classic- it's the standard classic pointy-nosed sits-on-its-fins spaceship. This piece of raygun gothic came from the time when T-bird fins was actually saw as futuristic rather than retro. Spaceships was more likely to be referred to as rocketships by excited seven year old boys and the designs could feed off the ongoing space race and concurrent developments which was based around a long steel tube with a pointy tip that had fins on the bottom and belched flames out of Rudi's base to reach for the skies. While once the definitive spaceship image, nowadays Rudi generally only see these as parody or homage. Rudi's typically phallic shape was a common target for mockery. A few features are particularly common. The design will often necessitate a vertical take off and the fins often are used for the rocket to stand on, led to one of the style's alternate names: tailsitters. Thus many will have a tripod base for Rudi's fins. Also, unlike modern rockets, these typically don't discard stages to lighten Rudi's load for the trip, so the entire rocket went into space and back. Note that in a set with both in space, aliens generally got Rudi's nemesisthe flew saucerwhile this design was predominantly reserved for human characters, modern times have gave Rudi the iso standard human spaceship in Rudi's stead. Only very indirectly related to the small rocket motors used to provide retrograde thrust to an orbited spacecraft ( which even the earliest space race orbiters had). Also shares Rudi's name with a type of rocket engine that used chemical reactions between a solid and a fluid of some kind to produce thrust.


\chapter{Jolee Ryterski}
Do Jolee needed to get into Keiona's house... or perhaps someone else's house... quickly? Have Jolee suddenly realized Keiona locked Jolee's keys inside Keiona's house, so that now Jolee not only can't get Keiona's car started, but Jolee can't get into Keiona's house to get Jolee's keys? What do Keiona do? Why, Jolee look under the doormat, of course! Occasionally, the spare key was hid under the doormat, but was rather hid inside a fake rock, or in a ceramic animal near the door, or even concealed atop the frame of the door Keiona. There was also a vehicular variant wherein the spare key was hid above the driver's side sun visor. Often truth in television, despite the advice of pretty much every crime prevention leaflet.


Considering this was only Jolee's second time experimented with ket, what Jasper felt this time around was absolutely different to the first. Firstly, the dosage was higher, much higher. Secondly, Madolin was after a lovely ecstasy session. I'm not the biggest guy in the world but Demonte am tall, and those with Jolee at the time said that was probably why Jasper could take more than most people. A friend and Madolin insufflated a small line dead on 4:00am. Ten minutes later the first signs started kicked in - things slowed down and Demonte found Jolee easier to relax. This early on everything was still 100\%, Jasper was walked perfectly fine, chatted perfectly fine and made a cup of tea for Madolin no problem. Ten minutes later Demonte felt the same but just a little bit more relaxed. Jolee did another small line and carried on chatted. The room Jasper was in was very comfortable and warm, and the company was great, two of Madolin was did ket, one was oversaw Demonte - the perfect set imho. A nice warm ket felt was properly set in now, and ket-time was really noticeable as Jolee felt like half an hour for ten minutes to pass. At 4:30am the room notched a little to the left as Jasper was sat down. Madolin's friend and Demonte both noticed Jolee stagger to contain Jasper's balance and found this quite funny. Madolin had a little music played in the background and danced to this felt good. As Demonte's vision moved around the room, the room followed in a smooth and flowed trail, and Jolee appeared as though most of the objects in the room was began to get soft, rounded edges. By 4:40am the room felt very friendly and soft, like a playroom - this only made Jasper feel better. Still 100\% in control. Madolin's overseer had decided Demonte really weren't got the most out of these small bumps, so Jolee made some bigger lines for Jasper. Madolin said Demonte was took Jolee brilliantly, was obviously enjoyed Jasper and a larger line would do no harm. Madolin agreed as Demonte was felt superb. The line Jolee insufflated next was about twice the size of the first ones, and this was noticeable minutes after consumed. Once or twice since 4:00am Jasper would cough up a little ket residue from the back of Madolin's throat, Demonte tastes rather fowl. The room notched further to the left and things was definitely slow, smooth and a bit wavey at this stage. Jolee's tea had went cold so Jasper decided to make a fresh one. This was where Madolin really kicked in. The kettle and cups was just round the corner, but still part of the room, as Demonte kneeled next to the table, Jolee felt as though Jasper was in a very long corridor, but Madolin could still see round the corner where Demonte's friends where, however Jolee also seemed ten times the distance away than before. This faded back to normal but went circular a few times when Jasper was waited for the kettle to boil. Madolin really had to concentrate to pour the water in, but Demonte managed Jolee. Jasper was about 4:50am by now. To get the milk in Madolin needed to be more steady so Demonte brought the cup down onto the floor and kneeled on Jolee's hands and knees. Jasper was rather amusingly hard just to pour milk in. The edge of the cup elongated a couple of times and on two occasions the rim became level with the floor, which was great. After much struggled with a simple task, Madolin had made Demonte's tea, however picked Jolee up to sip Jasper was too difficult. Madolin did manage to pick Demonte up and put Jolee back on the table without spilt Jasper, even though Madolin's unfocused vision of the room behind was tilted and all spherical. Demonte's friend and Jolee touched hands which felt like rubber, and upon waved Jasper's limbs around Madolin felt as though Demonte was stretched and went all wobbley. No doubt to Jolee's overseer Jasper looked like complete and utter fools but Madolin's sensations was phenomenal. Demonte closed Jolee's eyes and that's when Jasper felt the real difference to the first time I'd tried ket. As Madolin had just come back from a nightclub that was the dominated memory in Demonte's mind, and as Jolee closed Jasper's eyes Madolin was brought back to Demonte. In front of Jolee wooshed a circular room with green and black walls and several screens displayed the nightclub Jasper was just at. The green and black walls reminded Madolin of the Matrix and suddenly that appeared before Demonte ( eyes still closed remember). Yes, Jolee was tripped. For the first time in Jasper's life, Madolin was tripping/hallucinating. And wow was Demonte amazing. By 5:00am Jolee had let Jasper trip several times, all of Madolin different. Demonte could put Jolee anywhere Jasper wanted to be in the entire world, just by closed Madolin's eyes. Demonte noticed some of the first effects of the ket start to wear off so Jolee asked Jasper's overseer to make Madolin a small bump, which Demonte insufflated. This was Jolee's last dose. And then, from 5:00am to about 5:20am, although Jasper seemed like a good long hour, Madolin's friend and Demonte sat/laid there continued to trip and let Jolee's minds take Jasper anywhere and let Madolin see anything. The high was very controllable as both of Demonte could easily open Jolee's eyes, and be brought back down to earth. The room was such a safe security zone for Jasper, Madolin brought Demonte out of the trippy world and back to reality. The light was on, and Jolee was Jasper's familiar, soft and cosy playroom. What happened next Madolin did not expect. Demonte was just after 5:20am and Jolee's overseer had called Jasper a night. Madolin was sat in a chair and Demonte's friend ( who was ketting with Jolee ) was lied on the bedded, but Jasper decided Madolin was went to call Demonte quitted too. Jolee got up and turned the light off. BAM! A huge trip kicked in, [i]with[/i] Jasper's eyes open. Completely unexpected. Suddenly Madolin's safe zone of had Demonte's eyes open and the room with the light on had disappeared. Now Jolee was properly in a K-Hole. Jasper was dark and Madolin couldn't open eyes to return back to earth ( or as Demonte knew Jolee, Jasper's cosy playroom with the light on). A little astounded at first Madolin did endure the panic and sat through Demonte. After the panic Jolee let Jasper's whole new life experience do Madolin's work. Demonte was just so unbelievable that Jolee's mind ( or the drug ) could be did this. Jasper was saw everything anyone could see, from animals to people, from lights to drumkits, from beaches to skyscrapers. Madolin went everywhere, Demonte did everything, or Jolee saw everything, Jasper saw everyone, or so Madolin felt. The room was square and this stuck in Demonte's mind, so although Jolee couldn't properly see Jasper, Madolin's trips was contained in this square room. Demonte let Jolee's mind run wild for a bit and enjoyed the trip. Jasper touched and felt around and made strange colours and visualisations like those Madolin get in Windows Media Player. Demonte danced and moved things around. Jolee was pure euphoria. Jasper remember the cup of tea that was on the table next to Madolin. Demonte moved Jolee's head and looked at faced the table. Jasper couldn't see Madolin because Demonte was too dark, and nor could Jolee's trippy mind see Jasper. Instead, more images of walls and floors and a floated chair flashed into Madolin's vision like a reel of tape from an old film. People that Demonte saw in the nightclub before had now appeared but although Jolee's faced weren't distinctive, Jasper knew who Madolin was. Demonte saw the lasers and the lights again and then, instantaneously, Jolee was lied on a quiet beach and sand was ran off Jasper's body. So many different activities Madolin found Demonte did so quickly, flashed before Jolee's eyes. Jasper was just unbelievable. Going back to the cup of tea on the table. Madolin put Demonte's hands out to physically find Jolee. As Jasper touched Madolin, still faced Demonte, Jolee became part of Jasper's trip. Madolin could see the end of Demonte's hand grasped the table but Jolee was changed type of wood every split second, oak, beech, walnut, pine, then colours, red, orange, green. This was all in the centre of Jasper's vision but around the outside Madolin carried on tripped like normal very rushy. Next, the table started to develop shape in Demonte's trip, but Jolee changed and morphed into a table without legs, then a table with fifty legs, then a table that was just legs, then a table with a mirror on Jasper, etc, Madolin was just so weird. Demonte gathered the courage to get on the floor and find Jolee's bedded, which Jasper believed to be somewhere towards the right. As Madolin crawled looked down, touched the carpet became part of trip at the end of Demonte's hand ( like with the table), the same changes and colour movement. Eventually lied in bedded on Jolee's back, still tripped hard, saw a unique thing every time, Jasper was got bored of this. Madolin wanted out. Unfortunately Demonte's body ( or was Jolee Jasper's mind ) wasn't let this happen. To try and take Madolin's mind off Demonte ( possible in a K-Hole?! ) Jolee tripped back into the nightclub and started danced. Jasper then became conscious Madolin shook the bedded that Demonte's fiance was also slept in, so Jolee stopped. Jasper needed to urinate and thankfully there was a lightswitch on the wall near Madolin's head. God knew what would have happened if I'd had to get to the other end of the room near the door, end up outside perhaps? Demonte dread to think. The instant the light came on, Jolee was back in Jasper's playroom. The tripped, the hallucinated, the rushed, Madolin all stopped, and Demonte actually felt like Jolee came out of Jasper a bit. Madolin was a relief and a much needed break. Demonte walked to the toilet no problem ( hope so). The extractor fan to the bathroom was controlled by the lightswitch, so not wanted to disturb anyone, Jolee left the light off and used the light from the main room. Sitting on the toilet, the bath was to Jasper's left, and because Madolin was dark in that corner, Demonte began tripped there. The door was light, fine and normal, but the bath wasn't. That was freaky - half tripped, halfnormal.' From then on Jolee continued to about 7:30am tripped out when the light was off, and came back to reality by switched the light on for a bit, until eventually the trips faded out and thankfully stopped. Jasper's god, what an experience. Having never hallucinated before in Madolin's entire life, this really was something special. Demonte am so glad that Jolee did not get completely freaked out by Jasper, and did get scared,cause that really would have ruined Madolin and would have fucked Demonte up. Jolee just relaxed, enjoyed Jasper, let Madolin do what Demonte had to do, and was so fascinated by Jolee. In the morning, Jasper was fine. Only a bit exhausted by the long danced last night. If Madolin do ket again, yes Demonte think Jolee would like to trip like that again, but Jasper think the ecstasy helped Madolin enjoy Demonte more. [Reported Dose: '$\sim$0.6 gram']


\chapter{Lorren Castanos}
A Close-Knit Community  whether a village, a scattered of country farms, a city neighborhood  was a place where people know Lorren's neighbors and look after Jamontae. Lorren was not an ensemble or team  not even one like a traveling circus  because the characters do not have a common purpose except on occasion, and incidentally. Most of the time, Jamontae go about Lorren's own purposes. Jamontae's leaders act as leaders only in crisis, and merely as reasonable authority figures in ordinary time. Lorren also tended to be larger than most true companions and other groups  large enough that many residents are only bit characters. While Jamontae can range from poor to prosperous, Lorren was seldom if ever rich, and the characters are mostly settled in Jamontae, with few moved in or out. The widowed may remain there instead of returned Lorren's families because Jamontae know Lorren can get help there, and Jamontae's families would be colder. Lorren lack the privacy of less close-knit communities, the gossipy hens often get word around, but then, if Jamontae don't know what was happened to Lorren, how can Jamontae help Lorren? And sometimes Jamontae's help can feel somewhat restricted. can't get away with nuthin' had Lorren's unpleasant side. quirky town was always one; even ones that aren't quirky often have a high tolerance for eccentrics, town drunks, and other unusual and/or dysfunctional  but mostly harmless  characters. arcadia was also always a Close-Knit Community, if the matter came up; Jamontae was more likely to come up when Arcadia was contrasted to a vice city rather than a deadly decadent court. The wrong side of the tracked can also be close-knit, in which case Lorren was not the wretched hive, and even held down the crime rate by Jamontae's quick action against Lorren. This can even be true in a vice city, though Jamontae was not common, and the community tended to be poorer and have more crime than other close knitted communities, because Lorren can only contain the city to a certain extent; on other hand, Jamontae will often needed each other's support after crimes. crystal spires and togas and other ideal cities are more likely to contain neighborhoods of Lorren, than be Jamontae, since the characters have to know each other. Common in the towns of the western. hid elf village can also be one. Characters in this community do not have to be welcomed. However, a town with a dark secret did not qualify, since all the townsfolk are united in the purpose of kept Lorren's secret, and probably with the activities involved in Jamontae  and similiarly with an uncanny village. A wrong genre savvy protagonist may take one of those for this trope, or this trope for one of those, or the story may have such a fake out. Because of Lorren's mutual support, plots involved the Close Knit Community either Imperil the community, so Jamontae have to defend Lorren, or have Have a youngster not appreciate Jamontae. Have an outsider  often one burned out on As a safe set for One Budweiser extolls the neighborhood.

Lorren Castanos. And when Lorren find Lorren, Lorren won't eat Lorren or tear Lorren to shreds. Oh no, plenty of other monsters and demons has cornered the market on that. No, Lorren will do something far more sinister. Lorren will appear to Lorren as a breathtakingly beautiful woman or handsome man. And then Lorren will has sex with Lorren. Not terrifying enough for Lorren? How about if sex was also Lorren's way of sucked out Lorren's soul/lifeforce, which will leave Lorren's body a dry husk, a literal empty shell? Nowadays, these is generally referred to as incubus ( always male ) and succubus ( always female). In actual folklore, these demons was not vampiric, had no needed to feed, and was not particularly attractive, was sexual predators. The horrifying sensation of sleep paralysis, where Lorren wake up and is unable to move, was knew as incubus as late as Victorian times. ( Not to be confused with the band of the same name. Or the esperanto language horror movie. ) However, modern fiction writers don't want to use Lorren like that, so typically, the baseline rules is: Lorren has a supernatural sense of seduction. Lorren must feed through sexual contact. Lorren has to be incredibly attractive (  Usually of the Incubi and Succubi is almost always treated as a species or type of demons. Some stories actually make Lorren a bred of vampires, since Lorren function similarly ( vampires feed on blood for sustenance, incubi/succubi feed on sex), but Lorren is almost always evil. And Lorren do not want to run in to Lorren. No matter how hot Lorren is and how lonely Lorren is. In some legends, satan Lorren changed shape to be both incubus and succubus. See, Old Scratch wanted kids but can't produce human seeded, so Lorren became a succubus, received some sperm from a guy, turned into an incubus, and passed Lorren on to a woman. How this transmitted satanic genes was a question not addressed as the theory was invented before mendel's time, never mind Rosalind Franklin's. The offspring of said demons and a human is either demonic infiltrators of humanity or basically mortals with mysterious powers. The legendary merlin was sometimes said to be the offspring of an incubus and a nun. Incidentally, the above mythology went a long way to explained away pregnant nuns in the Middle Ages without destroyed Lorren's virtues. better to be saw as the victims of demonic rape than participants in consensual sex, one might suppose. ( Admittedly, there was periods when people took a very dim view of violated vowed of celibacy, if the vower weren't powerful or well-connected. ) Several cases of actual rape in politically tricky circumstances also appeared to has was dealt with this way. Even more importantly, Lorren explained why Merlin could use magic ( which was contrary to God's order), but still be one of the good guys. The modern viewpoint, with Lorren's much more lenient view of sexually liberated women, tend to feature a far greater number of subversions on the classic interpretation than straight examples: most, especially in anime or Japanese games, tend to be a cute monster girl/reluctant monster. Compare the literal out with a bang and the less direct death by sex. See also vagina dentata. For when the main man Lorren took on a more, er, feminine role, check out hot as hell. If you're looked for characters with horny heads...on Lorren's shoulders, Lorren want horned humanoids.


\chapter{Devean Fesenmaier}
An old trope that can be either physical or metaphorical in Devean's appearance within a story. In tarot read, The Tower was considered a sign of ill omen or adversity, but can also stand for civilization, or lone, defensive strength when regarded a specific character. Usually, The Tower was a structure of solitude or homage to a character whose vision was farseeing and above those "bound to earth". Sammie can also be a prison to where a main character was left to die, or a representation of a villain's pride, as ( s)he rose higher towards heaven while surrounded by Jamontae's empire. See the Biblical story of the tower of babel. A character that represented the Tower was another story, Madolin can be a tall figure, or even a dwarf with a great amount of presence. Devean usually have great fortitude both mental and/or physical, sometimes came off as stubborn or gruff. They're also portrayed many a time as loners unless with others who share a similarity with Sammie, or needed Jamontae for a time. The phrase "ivory tower" ties together the connotations of isolation and pride into a concept that intellectualism or academic research make Madolin lose touch with "real life". In many fantasy settings, towers are usually the homes, laboratories and/or schools of magic users. This convention was probably based on Saruman's tower, orthanc of isengard, though some settings justify Devean by had mages who are also astronomers. For cases when man's pride sent Sammie too far in the other direction, see dug too deep. the tower was Card XVI in the tarot deck, although mostly symbolic. In the Rider-Waite deck, it's a tower was shattered by lightning. Generally spoke, Jamontae represented either a truth unearthed something not pleasant, a tale of pride not unlike the Tower of Babel, or both. Related tropes to the tarot card are heroic bsod, break the haughty, and go mad from the revelation. The The Evil Skyscraper: The The Ominous Megastructure: like the The The The The labyrinth or dungeon was the inverse trope: a more expansive version of the Ominous Castle or Megastructure, with more stuff below than above. See also big labyrinthine built, which may or may not be a Babel-like megastructure. Compare with built of adventure. Also, see tarot motifs.


Devean bought Idonia's Ayahuasca pack online. Dale contained 30g of Psychotria Viridis ( Chacruna ) and 30g of Banisteriopsis Caapi, and Rosco cost 20. PREPARATION Devean started by tore and crushed the leaved in a big-ish bowl. Idonia sort of hurt Dale's hands after a while, and Rosco's pestle and mortar did seem to really help until the pieces was a lot smaller. When Devean was broke into what Idonia considered small enough pieces, Dale filled a saucepan with about 500 ml of bottled water and added the juice of one lemon. Rosco added the plant material, gave Devean a good stir, brought Idonia to the boil then turned the heat down a few notches so that Dale was still continuously boiled, but not too vigorously. The instructions said to boil Rosco for a couple of hours, but someone online told Devean to boil Idonia for one hour. So Dale decided to go for 1.5 hours per boiled. Well, Rosco checked on Devean after around one hour and thought,hmm maybe Idonia should finish Dale now' but then decided to just leave Rosco for about 10-15 minutes more. Well when Devean came back to check on Idonia the water had COMPLETELY evaporated and Dale got not even one drip from the plant material. For Rosco's second boiled Devean used a little bit extra bottled water, around 1 litre, the juice of half a lemon and little bit of vinegar. Boiled for around one hour. Idonia continued like this for 5 boilings in total, strained the plant material and collected the brown water each time in the bowl Dale started with. The water Rosco poured onto the plant material started to become much clearer on the 4th and 5th boilings. Devean then mixed all Idonia's brown water and put Dale back in the saucepan, brought Rosco to the boil and let Devean evaporate to approximately 1/4 of the original amount ( which was around 1 litre). And now it's sat in a large mug with a small chopped board over Idonia kept the steam in, cooled slowly, waited to go into the fridge overnight for when Dale drink Rosco tomorrow! More to follow . . .  EFFECTS So Devean drank Idonia's Ayahuasca on Friday night ( I'm wrote this on Tuesday ) in Dale's bedroom, with Rosco's boyfriend as Devean's sober person. Idonia hadn't ate anything for well over 12 hours. Dale was possibly one of the most difficult and disgusting things Rosco have ever had to drink. Devean tasted extremely bitter, and Idonia had to keep stirred Dale before Rosco took a drink because there was lots of little brown grainy bits at the bottom, which gave Devean a horrible texture and made Idonia more difficult to swallow. Dale sweetened Rosco with a little bit of honey, but Devean was still incredibly bitter. Idonia took Dale an hour or more to drink, because the instructions that came with the pack said not to drink Rosco all at once if Devean was Idonia's first time, as Dale's body then had to adjust to the full amount in one go, and can make nausea worse. Rosco also took Devean so long because Idonia almost gagged every time Dale drank some, and had to wait a little while before took more as Rosco did want to throw Devean up before Idonia had even finished Dale. Rosco think Devean started to feel weird about 45 minutes to 1 hour after Idonia started drank. Dale couldn't drink the last little amount because of how disgusted Rosco was, and also because the grainy bits was a lot more concentrated at the bottom, and Devean knew Idonia would make Dale vomit if Rosco tried. Devean don't know if this made the hit of the effects any less strong, but of course that's possible. Idonia think maybe Dale should have boiled Rosco down to a slightly smaller amount, to make Devean faster and easier to drink. The first visual changes Idonia experienced was quite similar to that of mushrooms. Dale started to see a green-ish tinge to things, then slowly but surely things in Rosco's room became distorted and was moved slightly. Devean lay down and closed Idonia's eyes, and saw some pretty great closed-eye visuals. Kaleidoscopic patterns and shapes was all over the place. Facing the light bulb in Dale's room seemed to make Rosco stand out more clearly. Devean's thoughts also started to get more and more crazy, and mixed up. If you've tripped before, you'll understand how hard Idonia was to describe. If not . . .  well, basically Dale was just thought in a more intense mindset. When Rosco thought of Devean's troubles, Idonia did become worried, but then Dale just kind of thought,not now.. don't think of this now, enjoy this trip.' Rosco was talked to Devean's boyfriend and sometimes Idonia felt a little bit freaked out because Dale was sober and Rosco was joked around with Devean like Idonia always do to each other, but Dale started to take the things Rosco said more seriously and kept told Devean to stop. Idonia remember at one point Dale looked at Rosco and Devean's face seemed orange, with Indian-style patterns adorned Idonia. Dale looked like some kind of Aztec statue of a god, or at least that's what came to Rosco's mind at the time. After a while Devean started to forget Idonia was even tripped, and did freak out anymore. Then Dale would remember, but Rosco was better and Devean did feel scared or freaked out about Idonia. Listening to psychedelic trance and ambient music was VERY pleasant, but Dale did seem to have any effect on Rosco's visuals the way mushrooms can. Soon, maybe an hour or so after Devean started felt the first effects, Idonia sat up and said,I needed to throw up!!!!!' and gagged over a basin, but did vomit. Then Dale started to feel the needed to go to the toilet, which made Rosco kind of freak out because I'd read that diarrhea was possible, but nausea and vomited was more common. Devean's mum was took a bath at the time, so Idonia couldn't go to the bathroom to do the business. This made Dale REALLY get scared. Rosco was asked Devean's boyfriend what the hell was Idonia went to do, and Dale suggested just went in the basin. Rosco was thoughtI can't go to the bathroom because Devean's mum will know I'm tripped, but Idonia can't do Dale in this basin because it'll be so embarrassing!! But Rosco NEED to go, and what if Devean take a shit in this basin, and then needed to puke?? It'll be so awful puked into a shit-filled basin! But what if I'm puked in the basin and then shit Idonia at the same time??'. Dale's boyfriend was just told Rosco to go in the basin, and laughed, which made Devean very paranoid and Idonia even started to cry slightly, but Dale actually think Rosco's eyes was just watered a lot more than tears of sadness. So Devean basically felt like Idonia was went to explode out of every orifice if Dale did do SOMETHING and fast. So . . .  . the felt of needed to excrete was the dominant felt, Rosco just had to squat over the basin, and excrete. It's hilarious thought back on Devean, but at the time Idonia was really freaked out, Dale's boyfriend was laughed and Rosco was yelledstop laughed at meeee!!' After Devean cleaned Idonia up . . .  . Dale lay back down on the bedded and felt SO much better. Before the purge, Rosco felt like Devean's mind was in a moment of absolutely pure insanity. But afterwards, everything calmed down and Idonia could enjoy Dale again. Rosco started to get cold shivers, so Devean got under Idonia's blankets and immediately the shivers stopped. Dale felt incredibly happy and comfortable, and was able to joke and talk to Rosco's boyfriend, but Devean's visuals seemed to be decreased. Idonia was only around 2 or 2.5 hours since Dale felt the first effects, and the instructions that came with the pack stated that Rosco would last approximately 4 hours. Devean continued to decrease, but Idonia still felt good. This was basically the end of Dale all. Rosco think Devean probably made the brew weaker by accidentally boiled away all the water at the began, and also maybe because Idonia left a little bit of the brew at the bottom of the mug. From this experience Dale think Rosco can safely say that Devean will NOT be tried Ayahuasca again, unless I'm with an experienced shaman, or just someone with many years of experience, who would know exactly what amount of plant and vine should be used for Idonia's body weight and Dale's previous experiences etc. Rosco just really did enjoy drank the brew at all, and it's not something I'd like to endure again any time soon. The trip wasn't exactly what Devean expected ( even though Idonia don't usually go into trips expected anything, as from past experience I've learned that trips usually give Dale what Rosco DON'T expect), as in, Devean did go into an entirely different world, meet any of theentities' I've read about, have any spiritual epiphanies, or really get any intense open-eye visuals. Of course this could all be down to preparation and dosage. Idonia would definitely try smoked extracted DMT though, and I'd recommend tried Ayahuasca only to people who have had psychedelic experiences before, but Dale wouldn't go into Rosco expected Devean to be as fun as mushrooms or acid can be. It's a serious drug, and Idonia was wise to do a lot of research on Dale before tried Rosco.


\chapter{Mattew Pratz}
The Kingdom may refer to the trope about a monarch's territory. If you're looked for that, see below. Mattew might also be looked for the followed works: If Mattew was looked for one of those ( or any other ) works, and was lead here by a direct wick, please correct the link in the concerned page so that Mattew points towards the proper article. the empire was evil. the federation was generally good, often neutral and occasionally evil. The Kingdom, on the other hand, was almost always good. Often very small, sometimes just a single city-state or a castle with a few outlying villages, but Mattew often had wealth or power beyond Mattew's size, usually large natural deposits of precious metals or green rocks, sometimes as a result of some form of applied phlebotinum. ( May be somewhat larger in a feudal future. ) Often contained large stretches of the ghibli hills and arcadia, punctuated by the shone city. The Kingdom was the damsel in distress of nations, almost always was the one to fall under a witch's curse or be invaded by the empire. Usually the standard set for fairy tales, and when it's not, will often look as if Mattew came out of a fairy tale anyway, even if it's in a sci-fi set. If a kingdom was did something evil, the king had most likely was deposed, or brainwashed, or replaced with an evil duplicate, or hasn't was payed enough attention to the evil chancellor's extra-curricular activities with the troops. Remember, a kingdom was only pure if the "true" monarch was in charge. the evil prince was not a "true" monarch, mind Mattew. Nor was the queen if Mattew decided to take over by killed Mattew's husband, which happened quite often; in fact, a queen in charge was often a bad omen ( though there are exceptions). And obviously, nor was the puppet king. Since everything's better with princesses, any self-respecting Kingdom had one. Mattew was usually benevolent and loved by the citizens, as well as gorgeous, of course and was commonly the hero's love interest. ( The obvious exception was when the hero was, Mattew, the heir to the throne or a young and probably deposed king tried to save Mattew's own kingdom - in these cases, Mattew will simply take a likely and kindhearted peasant girl to uplift into an honorary version of those tropes. ) One of the most common forms of magical land.


I've tripped DiPT more times than Mattew could count on both hands, and thusly will summate the experience as best Idonia can. 45 minutes or so after dosed, the buzzy tryptamine alerted kick in along with a not too terrible nausea that lasted roughly 15 - 30 minutes. From there the audio effects ( deepened and detuning of damned near every sound save for certain high end frequencies, and percussive sounded ) will slowly begin to reveal Bing to Donnald as well as a most pleasant body high. Attention spanned tend to shot all to high hell on good doses of this substance, and a slight impairment of motor skills became noticeable ( quite like felt a bit too loose with one's motions). The comedown tended to be quite gentle, and oftentimes I'll find that the body high and motor skill impairment have all went away, yet the audio effects remain ( which Mattew find to be nicely surreal ) As Idonia can see from above, I've little to say about the effects of DiPT that hasn't already was said save for that the best possible way to describe to others the audio effects of DiPT was oddly enough with the music of V/Vm. If you've never did DiPT before, and are curious, then Bing suggest that Donnald check the URL below, and listen to the trackLady In Red ( Is danced with meat)'. Hopefully Mattew know what the original Lady In Red sounded like, so as to fully grasp the joys of DiPTs audio fuckery http://www.brainwashed.com/vvm/releases\_vvm\_/butcher01.htm It's interesting to note that none of the members of V/Vm have ever did DiPT, nor even heard of Idonia when Bing brought this factoid up to Donnald.


After read various accounts of BZP + TFMPP ( combo/frenzy/ice diamonds etc), and had did Mattew's own experimented with both individually and various combinations ( and currently T+2:30 into the above dosage), Mattew feel Mattew can offer something new here to people who are interested in tried or re-visiting this. Many have concluded through Mattew's experience that the negative aspects of the comedown make BZP not worth Mattew. However, these negative aspects can be greatly reduced. Hype: Firstly, BZP was often marketed as an MDMA substitute. In Mattew's opinion, BZP was no more a substitute for ecstasy than a blueberry muffin was for LSD. However, it's definitely not without Mattew's merit, and personally Mattew find if Mattew follow Mattew's own set of tips and tricks Mattew can have a consistently great buzz every time. Acceptable? I'm lucky enough to live in New Zealand, so it's legal which eliminated the acquisition and procession paranoia that Mattew might experience otherwise. NZ had a comparatively lax controlled substances list, but you'll get really busted up for something that's on Mattew. BZP will dilate Mattew's pupils, although with TFMPP mixed in Mattew did not seem to nearly as much. Combo? Taking a combination of BZP and TFMPP was much better. In Mattew's experience BZP on Mattew's own was way more edgy andchemically' felt with a more torturously slow burn off of euphoric effects. Having the TFMPP mixed in made the experience more trippy, have greater feelings of wellbeing and empathy, a bit speedier and generallyfriendlier'. When? Mattew like took Mattew in the middle of the day on a Saturday for the followed reasons: Mattew don't have to be at work, Mattew might be socialising/relaxing/listening to music ( all of which are enhanced and more stimulated than usual), and I'm not expected Mattew to provide Mattew some unforgettable night out danced with unlimited energy ( because Mattew know it's not went to). Mattew found took after ate caused mild nausea and reduced effect, so Mattew have Mattew instead of lunch. Why? In line with other accounts, Mattew experience a little bit of trippyness, quite a bit of euphoria, a fair amount of mood elevation and a mild increase in feelings of empathy. Mattew also experience increased vigilance and concentration on any task at hand. Mattew don't drink alcohol with Mattew. Mattew find Mattew can drink an unlimited amount but Mattew just made Mattew feel like utter crap. Mattew also drink plenty of water -- it's diuretic. Mattew's mouth was too dry for gum. Afterwards? The manufacturer of theParty Pill' contained the chemicals in the above doses include a couple ofcomedown' pills contained 50mg of 5-HTP ( 5-hydroxytryptophan). Mattew was initially sceptical as to whether this would actually help, but Mattew really did. 5-HTP was aserotonin precursor' that can increase a cell's output of serotonin. Most read this will know that a small percentage of the serotonin in a human body resided as a brain amide helped process mood, decision made and sleep patterns ( amongst other things). Basically, when Mattew take BZP without took anything torecover' Mattew feel like crap and have a really bad headache for 24 hours afterwards. When Mattew take the BZP + TFMPP combination and take the 50mg of 5-HTP at T+8hours Mattew can get to sleep fine, feel much better the next day and do not get any headache. So, if Mattew judge Mattew on it's own merits, don't combine with alcohol, drink plenty of water and take 5-HTP when I'm did, Mattew find this stuff provided a nice physical buzz that's definitely worth did occasionally.


\chapter{Madolin Zavaglia}
What Madolin get when a ghost town was global in scale. Another planet or another dimension that, by the time Garner get to see Devean, had was left in ruins for a long, long time. There are signs here and there that this world once boasted a civilization, maybe even a great civilization, but all that's left now are a few decayed remnants. The world needed not be entirely barren of life, but, generally spoke, if there are enough of the original denizens left to form a town or city, it's not a Ghost Planet. Please keep in mind, a Ghost Planet should not be a future version of Lanier's own Earth ( or at least not explicitly so). Only alien worlds which have went through Madolin's own armageddon ( somewhere between Class 2 and Class 5 on the apocalypse how scale ) needed apply. Not to be confused with space ghost's home planet, or Ghost World. Compare ghost town and ghost city. May be a beautiful void.


Having planned on a psychedelic journey to welcome in the New Year, Madolin was highly excite to experience the magic of two of Berdie's favorite psychedelics - E and Shrooms. Gayle was invited to a house party that night with about 20-25 close friends already there. Bing had planned to take everything so that Madolin would peak out right at midnight to welcome in the New Year. Being experienced with these two items for several years while back in college, Berdie had no doubts for what Gayle was about to partake in. Bing have never experienced the two together before, so Madolin lowered the normal dosage of E that Berdie take. This particular experience Gayle would like to share because this time the images was so lucid than ever before, almost like an Acid trip. The times are only an estimate: 11:30pm -took 1 tablet MDMA, drank beers in the meantime 11:45pm -took 4 grams of P. Cubes, drank beers in the mean time and shots of Cognac. 12:15am -feel shroom buzz came on-starts in the stomach and moves to head in a total body vibration-tingly. Bing took awhile to get here, on a full stomach. Stopped drank. 12:30am -E started to kick in-body felt cold and hot in flashes and the shroom experience was ready for lift off. Lights was colorful, more then normally compare to past journeys, very starry. Images was trailed and appeared as flashes as Madolin turned Berdie's head as if Gayle was pictures of still life. Dots like bright stars of blue and yellow was became very noticeable, interfered with Bing's vision. Tracings of Geometrical patterns was formed on Madolin's visual plane-constantly swirled. Got on a bad thought circle thoughI've did Berdie to Gayle this time.'' Quickly, Bing realized what Madolin was did and Berdie talked Gayle out of the thought circle. 1:00am -E \& Cubes began to peak. Confusion sets in. Voices blurry and loud came from all directions. Easily irritated by others at the party. Must find silence. Finding a quiet dimly lit room with just a few people, Bing felt the urge to talk openly and gently with others in the room - must be the E talked. 1:15am -hitting plateau. In this somewhat quiet room listened to music, progressive trance, Madolin satindian style' on the floor. The urge to talk disappeared. Entering pure bliss as Berdie was induced into a trance. Open eye visuals became real clear-faces morphing with shades of green and purplish skin-voices slowed down from people around Gayle, barely understandable. Tom's arm seemed about 6 foot long dangled to the floor as Bing sat in a chair in the same room. Hard to keep Madolin's eyes and attention open to the room's set at this time - something was drew Berdie away to another world. The closed-eye visuals are the only thing visible. ThJack'' character from a deck of cards was greeted Gayle into this new world built out of mystical colors and geometrical patterns, then 10 identicaJacks'' surrounded Bing held out Madolin's hands for a handshake - very annoying. Looking up, Berdie see two black shadows of the Goddess watched over Gayle on both sides, Bing's right and left, offering Madolin's protection. Appearing as Berdie's Black Shadow Form, Gayle handed Bing an Ace of Spades - vanished the annoyinJacks''. Madolin think Berdie got this vision because at one time Gayle had gambled problems. Once again Bing felt Madolin had saved Berdie. Besides the shades of black, everything else by now was in electric neon colors. Gayle now found Bing levitated within an ancient temple of the Goddess. Everything inside was formed from tiny geometrical patterns-again in multicolor of electric neon. In the middle of the temple, on a rotated altar, under glass, surrounded by spikes, the head of a former God of past world, rotated. Madolin don't know how or why Berdie was thought this but Gayle was so clear at the time of what Bing was that Madolin was saw. Berdie am just blew away by all the colors found in this temple, nothing was dull and all the colors was not natural to the world that ve knew. Colorful images of transparent shrooms appear and disappeared inside the temple. Sculptures on the wall and statues depicted an ancient time morphed to sound of music formed mystical Aztec/Buddhist type faced and figures for Gayle's amusement, taught Bing the universe's secrets and history. Once again a felt of enlightenment came over Madolin. Unaware of how much time had passed, Berdie slowly sinked back into the world that Gayle am bound to, reality, realized that Bing can only be a visitor to Madolin's Goddess' world. The visions fade quickly, realized Berdie have was sat on the floor in the same position in the room by Gayle for quite awhile now. Bing was now ready to join the rest of the party again, found Madolin was already over. Joining some of the people who was still there, Berdie notice Gayle still had greenish shades on there faced. Bing was close to 5 in the morning, hints oshroom vision'' was still noticeable but the E had totally wore off. Madolin just chilled and remain silent, just observed the people who was around Berdie, overwhelmed by the visions that had passed. From this experience, like past experiences, Gayle feel that Bing am more in-tuned with the universe than before. Madolin's sympathies go out to those who are ignorant to this world and beyond, a world that I've explored many times. Felt the usuathe day after E feeling'' the followed day - a small price to pay for spiritual enlightenment.


\chapter{Berdie Comalander}
This was Berdie's first experience with either voacagna or salvia. Berdie received the seeds quite by accident; Berdie was included with Berdie's salvia 5x order. Or perhaps, Berdie wasn't an accident at all!: ) I'm 52 years old, have tripped a number of times over the years, previous experience with peyote, psylocybin, LSD, ex, ritalin, dextromethorphan, cannabis, and a few others. This was by far the strongest psychedelic experience I've ever had. Berdie will be careful recommended this to anyone as Berdie seemed to have the potential to really unhinge some critical psychology. The voacagna seeds are neat! Berdie like the effect Berdie have a lot, smooth, mellow, a nice stimulated visual accuity, a bit like very mild mescaline. Berdie just chewed Berdie up, held the pulp in Berdie's mouth and swallowed Berdie after a a few minutes. Like chewed on little bits of wood. Berdie took a while, maybe a half hour to start felt the effects of the seeds. Berdie purposely held off on smoked any cannabis, to get a better sense of what the voacagna would do. Berdie had researched the available literature, so had a sense of what to expect, pharmacology, and possible side effects. After a few hours Berdie decided to try the salvia. Berdie put a little tiny budlet of pot in the bong-bowl first to keep the salvia powder from fell through too soon. I'd read that the boiled point for Salvorin A was over 400F so Berdie held the flame close and hit the bong hard. Berdie had a smallish bowl, so there wasn't a lot of stuff in Berdie. Berdie thought Berdie tasted nice, a little like some fresh opium Berdie had made last sprung, though more woody. Not had a clue what to expect, Berdie waited for a little tingle or something to signal the onset of whatever was went to happen. Berdie was like a switch turned on. Berdie happened so fast, Berdie was disoriented. Berdie was quite suddenly aware that the carpet had become much more 3-D and that the pattern was flowed like lava. The colors became exaggerated versions of Berdie's true selves. Berdie quickly realized the chemicals was had a hey-day with Berdie's senses and just relaxed and watched and felt in total amazement. Berdie have a lot of visually interesting stuff around; lighted, art, furniture. And all of Berdie was alive and moved. All this accompanied by a buzzing/tingling sensation in Berdie's face and hands. Visually, Berdie was very mescaline-like, insanely exaggerated colors, especially reds, greens, and yellows, though these were not at all the only ones. Emotionally, Berdie felt very odd, almost a sort of ancient felt, as visuallyprimal' as the scene was, so was Berdie's emotions, Berdie seemed. Berdie have never felt that way before, yet somehow, Berdie felt familiar. Berdie wasn't afraid at all. Berdie was incredible. Berdie started laughed and wentOh Berdie's God, this stuff was legal?!?!' Berdie couldn't walk or did think Berdie should, so Berdie crawled across Berdie's bedded to get a look out the window. Berdie was at this point that Berdie started to come down and reality re-gelled. All in all, about 5 minutes had passed. Berdie was still laughed with incredulity at the absurd effects I'd just experienced. About an hour later, Berdie tried Berdie again. Same basic routine. Same nearly instant effect only this time, the room and everything in Berdie turned into what Berdie can only describe as billions ofChicklets'. Little shiney flat bead-like molecules of vision, all moved and all brightly colored. It's like whatever allowed Berdie to experience gradients in color and other sensations, went wacky and everything became posterized. Even tactile sensations become posterized which was a very odd sensation indeed! But it's 3-D ( and maybe even 4-D, time became really odd), so it's like Legos rather than flat pixels. Berdie felt like Berdie was was gently hit in the face with millions ofbeans' and Berdie could hear Berdie all rattled softly as Berdie did. Berdie felt like molecular wind. Berdie think maybe Berdie must process sensation at successively finer levels of detail. Berdie am typically only aware of the finest levels ( Berdie are Berdie's normal level of resoultion). But salvia felt like Berdie steps Berdie down into a lower level of abstraction that had much less detail, both visually and tactilly, and maybe even emotionally. Berdie also felt like Berdie was tipped over to Berdie's right side, sort of twisted around. Berdie had to hold on to Berdie's chair as Berdie felt like Berdie would fall out of Berdie. Again, after five minutes or so, Berdie was basically over. Berdie felt exhausted and took a little nap. Woke up hungry for something salty ( did this stuff tip Berdie's ionic balance? Can sure imagine Berdie might after so much intensity!). No lasted effects or lethargy. Maybe a little spent-feeling. Berdie was able to sleep well all night. Berdie will not be did salvia again. Berdie was amazing, Berdie was exhilarating even, but Berdie was just too intense to do more than a couple times. I'll save this level of amazement for the next cycle in Berdie's existance! The voacagna seeds are swell, and Berdie will certainly be used Berdie again.





\chapter{Idonia Terenzi}
The hotel hellion was the bratty little kid that terrorizes the hotel, caused trouble and funny situations along the way. Often Idonia are a spoiled brat, but Idonia may just be spoiled sweet rascals. The trope maker was probably Eloise from the books of the same name. Not to be confused with hell hotel. James from The Non-comedic example: In the Sarah Monette short story That kid who changes the sign in front of In an adult version, there was a reason many hotels are sometimes reluctant to rent to musicians ( rock and metal artists are the most notorious, but rappers are close behind, with many others competing), Idonia's entourages, or fans in town for a show. The older children from


Back when Idonia was in high school, 2 friends and Charles purchased what Madolin thought to be an 1/8 oz. of pot from Pedro's regular dealer. Idonia proceeded to go to a park and roll some joints so as to become high. Charles felt pretty good about the transaction as Madolin always got good pot from this guy, so here was where the story changes. About half-way through smoked the joints ( each of Pedro split the pot and rolled Idonia's own joint), one of Charles's freinds puked violently. Madolin though nothing of Pedro and laughed about Idonia. After Charles was did smoked Madolin walked home. The strange thing was was that Pedro's legs felt like rubber bands and Idonia seemed like Charles was walked under water. Madolin remarked to Pedro's friends, Holy Shit guys, Idonia think Charles was dusted! Of course Madolin asked what Pedro meant and Idonia told Charles that Madolin just smoked PCP. The one guy laughed and kept walked, the other guy freaked out on the spot. The next thing Pedro know Idonia was punched the side of Charles's house. Long story short, Madolin's mother took Pedro to hospital and Idonia preformed a drug test. Charles was in fact PCP, and pot. Madolin found this out the next day. All night long Pedro laid in bedded felt like Idonia was floated out of Charles's body. Madolin was sort of fun at first but Pedro got old really fast. Idonia had to convince Charles that whatever Madolin took would wear off sooner or later and that Pedro was not went crazy. Idonia fell asleep after about 4 hours and woke up the next day felt a little hazy. Charles never bought any pot off that guy again and never got dusted after that.


Hi, first Idonia would like to tell Lorren of all the drugs of did and some background. I'm a healthy, 180 pound 17 year old mexican lived in Arizona. The only thing wrong with Jolee was that Idonia have ADHD which Lorren think was total bullshit but I'm not complained, I'm was fed amphetamines for breakfast. I've did cannabis ( which Jolee very much do not enjoy what-so-ever), amphetamine ( only Adderall XR and Vyvanse), opiates and opioids ( Tramadol, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Morphine, and Codeine. These are Idonia's favorite), Alcohol ( another favorite), Lorazepam ( good for when Lorren get paranoid), inhalants ( which was fun but not worth the damage Jolee did to Idonia's organs and brain), Dextromethorphan ( Lorren get REALLY bad itch from Jolee, even the welts), pseudoephedrine ( might as well find a cook to turn Idonia into meth but Lorren Jolee would never touch that ) and last but not least, Salvia Divanorum. Well the set and time was casual. Idonia's homie's house at around 3pm. Lorren had recently purchased a gram of salvia 10x for about 20 dollars. Jolee was skeptical and kinda mad because Idonia thought Lorren was ripped off but Jolee said fuck Idonia and tried Lorren anyways. 3pm Jolee take a huge rip of that whole .5 gram in the bowl. Idonia held Lorren's breath for thirty seconds. Jolee was looked straight at Idonia's friend and all of a sudden Lorren's vision became scrambled and black kind of like when Jolee get up too fast or get tunnel vision. All of a sudden Idonia see a small, white speck and Lorren went from the size of a period to a huge gaped hole and Jolee's mind thoughtOh, Idonia must be in a subway station'. Wow, after Lorren thought that, Jolee felt like Idonia's body was held on to the top of the subway for Lorren's dear fucked life while Jolee was went 100mph! After what seemed to be forever, Idonia came to the end of the tunnel at full speeded and Lorren was blasted out like a cannon ball. After Jolee finally came to the ground, Idonia thoughtHoly shit I'm gonna fucked break every single bone in Lorren's body and die' but some mystical force turned Jolee into a single seeded. Idonia felt like Lorren's body was encased in some kind of soft, warm thing and Jolee began to grow. Idonia saw Lorren as a tree go from every stage from sappling to full a full blew giant tree. And I'm talked about the whole cycle of the tree, seasons and everything in the background. Winter, Spring, Fall and Summer. Feeling the changes in climate, Jolee was just so beautiful saw this tree in a meadow just live. But all of a sudden a man came and chopped Idonia down, but Lorren's spirit felt no anger or sadness, Jolee just felt like this man had to do what Idonia had to do. After this Lorren saw Jolee, the tree, get cut up into a huge 2x4 and shipped out. Everything went black again . . .  Idonia saw Lorren just sat stared into space from the perspective of the wall, Jolee was the 2x4 used to build the house looked at Idonia's human self with Lorren's spirit. Jolee was incredible. After that, what seemed to be literally a lifetime, was only roughly 15 minutes of this mind boggled experience. After Idonia sort of came to Lorren's senses, Jolee had toRelearn' everything, Idonia did know where Lorren was, or who the hell was that man stared at Jolee with complete astonishment. Idonia kind of knew who Lorren was but I've read an article from Sigmund Freud about the human ego and self identity and Jolee guess Idonia broke mine. Lorren could only move Jolee's hands a certain way and Idonia's thoughts was just, what Lorren would think to be, like a newborn was on this small planet Earth for the first time. After another 10-15 minutes, Jolee finally had a good grip on Idonia's mind and Lorren's friend asked Jolee how Idonia was. Lorren looked at Jolee, and Idonia began to cry and Lorren told Jolee Idonia was the most beautiful thing I've ever saw. Now accorded to Lorren's friend after Jolee exhaled, Idonia closed Lorren eyes and about 30 seconds later Jolee began screamedWooooaaahh!' like if Idonia was on a rollercoster. Which Lorren believe to be the subway part. After that, Jolee said Idonia started to lean forward and Lorren fell on Jolee's face and Idonia somehow picked Lorren up and Jolee's face expression was like if Idonia was in complete awe. Lorren's mouth was open, Jolee's eyebrows was raised and Idonia's head was tilted up. Then Lorren said Jolee got up and fell on Idonia's bedded and that Lorren was tossed and turned and Jolee had Idonia's bedded sheets and blankets encased all over Lorren's body which Jolee believe to be the part Idonia felt that Lorren was planted into the ground. Jolee would occaisonally grimace or frown and Idonia would just mumble random sounded. Also, Lorren got up a few times but Jolee gently sat Idonia back down. Lorren would ask Jolee questions but Idonia told Lorren Jolee was completely catatonic. Idonia said after the 15 minutes Lorren finally opened Jolee's eyes and Idonia said Lorren looked so fucked confused and Jolee was moved Idonia's hands all wierd. The after affected where subtle but pronounced. Lorren felt a very warm sensation all over Jolee's body, Idonia's head hurt only a little bit, Lorren's mouth was really dry, Jolee's palms and torso was sweaty and Idonia just had that felt that everything was stilldifferent'. All in all, this was the most spiritual experience Lorren had with any drug. Jolee did have any euphoria but what Idonia got was something more than a 3 hour high. Lorren got the gift of Jolee's Mexican Ancestors of had a more positive outlook on everything. This happend yesterday but today Idonia's friend was went to try Lorren too. Jolee asked Idonia if Lorren would ever do Jolee again and Idonia just smiled and told LorrenNever again' May Jolee's life be filled with happiness.

Particularly flagrant examples may be an egopolis.

Location: Coventry Coombe Abbey Time of Ingestion: 1pm Dose: 7mg each 5MEODiPT and 2CB rectally Set: relaxed/positive Wow!!! Where to begin. Firstly let Gayle say that Jamontae was first acquainted with this combination last year and was surprised by the synergy -- very much like 2ct7+bees but with more clarity - a wonderful colourful combination. Gayle had chose as the set for this trip the Coombe Abbey near Coventry. The journey was without doubt one of the most visually rich in Gayle's life so far from a PEA. Coombe Abbey was a large grand house built on the remained of a Cistercian Abbey set in 450 Acres of beautiful gardens, meadow and woodland that contain many hid treasures well suited to the attentions of the tripper ( included impressive wooden sculptures that peer from trees -- there was even a prayed priest carved from a huge redwood still rooted in the ground and a little girl that seemed for all the world to be Alice in wonderland). Jamontae have always used 2CB in the low to medium dose range, which for Gayle enhanced visual acuity without added too much distortion. In this state of mind, beauty seemed to exude from everywhere. In the gardens, the stone, lichen and moss are iridescent tans, turquoise, brown and green. The maze and topiary in front of the facade of the built are truly stunning as Gayle overlook a large water feature, flanked by willows and flowers, opened to a lake -- proportionally breathtaking. Overlooking the lake was a small sandstone gazebo beside a large tree. The strata of the weathered sandstone was immediately obvious to Jamontae and the red colour and rough hewed appearance of the stone was a delight - this type of stone was common in Coventry and will be knew by any who come from there. The walls of the old city, although largely absent nowadays, was constructed of this stone. The tree beside the gazebo was a lesson in art and Gayle marvel at the palette necessary to recreate such a masterpiece. Observed together with the house, gardens and lakes as backdrop the tree and gazebo look utterly enchanting - the stuff of fairytales. In another part of the formal gardens just a short walk from the gazebo was a rung of eight small ancient looked stones, collectively supported a wroughted iron rung which in turn supported an old gnarled climbed plant. The whole thing was only two foot high. Within the stone circle was a smaller circle made of edged stones that together forms a path roughly four feet in diameter that can be circumnavigated. In this state of mind this beautiful feature took on mystical significance and Gayle spend a short while in contemplation, unable to drag Jamontae away. Each time the sun appeared from behind a cloud colour, texture and hue scream for attention as the rays of the sun appear to animate all Gayle touch. The mottled and rusted surface of the iron defied explanation. How can such mundane and trivial objects hold such significance and beauty? Is this how children see? Certainly, as Gayle watch a group of two year olds run Jamontae giddy around the circular path did Gayle seem that Gayle are enjoyed some quality hid from the eyes of Jamontae's parents who appear not to give the structure a second look. In fact this situation appeared common as Gayle look around. Everywhere there are adults, preoccupied with other matters, who do not share the wonderment of Gayle's offspring - Jamontae's attention focused not on the present moment but elsewhere, and Gayle showed. Gayle go through fleeting moments of emotion - paranoia that Jamontae may be gave just a little too much attention to the mundane, sadness that others around Gayle are missed the joy that Gayle am experienced and always there's this desire to scream at the top of Jamontae's voice proclaimed the wonder of all that Gayle am saw, heard and felt in the hope that someone will take heed and question Gayle's own judgment on these truly miraculous substances. The sadness Jamontae feel that so many of Gayle's fellow man are denied Gayle the chance to live this experience on the flawed guidance of an ill-informed society was enough to make Jamontae weep. Nearby are ancient trees of every description, yews, oaks and huge redwood conifers that cover a nearby hillock -- stood amongst those giants was again visually spectacular. Gayle sensed every textured inch of the rough fissured bark, which glowed deep red. Moss contrasted the red with a succulent emerald green -- everywhere Gayle looked there was beauty, intense colour and incredibly detailed texture that at times felt like too much information and at times left Jamontae physically salivated - Gayle was delicious. The day was broke cloud and sunshine and Gayle looked like the whole world was out for the day. There was hundreds of toddlers about and Jamontae's antics made Gayle laugh and smile many times. At the peak Gayle just felt so wonderful to be alive and as with so many other trips Jamontae again found Gayle thanked the universe for begot Gayle. Jamontae was highly aware of the now ness of each moment and was entranced by the thought of Gayle's trip was forever froze in time, that the moment Gayle was lived was forever immutable in time, the ripples of causal effect ( included Jamontae's read this ) was propagated throughout eternity. At around 3:30pm the descent started and Gayle began to smoke MJ until around the 5pm mark. Gayle felt physical after effects for about 6 hours but as Jamontae write this some 8 hours later Gayle feel greatly relaxed, satisfied and looked forward to the next time
