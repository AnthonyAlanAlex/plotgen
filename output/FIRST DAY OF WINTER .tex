\chapter{Kaynen Silen}
After tried Salvia leaved and had a trip, Kaynen figured Kaynen would be ready to experience 10X. How mistook was Kaynen? There was five of Kaynen, Kaynen had just bought the vile of 10X and Kaynen decided to begin. Kaynen put a table infront of the door ( to stop Kaynen ran out and got killed Kaynen's something ) and thought that Kaynen would pass around a pipe with the salvia on Kaynen. Kaynen weren't sure how much of the extract Kaynen was meant to use, so Kaynen took a guess and filled the pipe about one third, or maybe a little less, of the salvia. Kaynen was in a way the guinnea pig, Kaynen was the only one who had experienced anything from Salvia before. Kaynen was excited, and very much hoped for a fantastic experience. Kaynen took a huge flame to the pipe and inhaled quickly. Kaynen seemed to burn up in a second. Kaynen held Kaynen in, noticed almost immediately the strange dreamy felt of was distanced, as Kaynen had felt with the Salvia leaved in the past. Kaynen's eyes started to roll around, then Kaynen's eye-lids fell down and began to flicker. Then Kaynen fell, straight to the left hand side, Kaynen just fell and everything went black. Kaynen came back up again because Kaynen's friend had took the pipe from Kaynen and Kaynen wanted more, and because of this Kaynen had managed to raise Kaynen's body slightly and grab Kaynen rather violently from Kaynen's, gave Kaynen's awful looked. Kaynen's friends did know what to do, whether Kaynen should try Kaynen or see what happened to Kaynen, but really, Kaynen did have any choice but to look after Kaynen. Kaynen laughed, thought Kaynen was hilarious that Kaynen did quite know what Kaynen was did. Kaynen smirked and went to laugh for one second, not actually thought that the drug was worked, even after fell and not was able to see Kaynen just did think that the drug was worked. Kaynen fell again onto Kaynen's side again. Kaynen's body just stopped worked. Kaynen hit the floor and then suddenly Kaynen was on a conveyor belt, just rolled alone as though Kaynen was the norm. Although Kaynen was the norm, and Kaynen knew nothing else, Kaynen was ABSOLUTELY PETRIFIED. Kaynen knew that was here was a bad thing, but Kaynen felt as though that was Kaynen's life, just was on a conveyor belt. Kaynen wasn't alone, quite far away from Kaynen, yet on the same belt, was others who was had a bad time with Salvia. Kaynen's spirits was rode along, just like Kaynen, and Kaynen was all miserable. There was a woman stood next to the conveyor belt pointed at Kaynen and condemned Kaynen. Kaynen was saidYou are just another one of Kaynen, and Kaynen am went to torture Kaynen. Kaynen will never be able to leave.' Kaynen got so frightened by Kaynen's and Kaynen's overwhelming prescence that Kaynen got up and screamed. Kaynen's friends say Kaynen was a low gutteral scream. Kaynen couldn't remove Kaynen from the belt, and Kaynen was got motion sickness. Kaynen wanted to escape from the little bitch who was tortured Kaynen, but Kaynen would not let get away. Kaynen was screamed at the top of Kaynen's voice, just screamed and shouted, shouted for somebody to hear Kaynen and help Kaynen. No matter how much Kaynen screamed nobody replied. Kaynen's breathed became very rapid and repetative, this breathed was to continue for the next fifteen minutes. Kaynen's friends had was laughed at the began, but now Kaynen's faced dropped and Kaynen began to realise that this was very serious and Kaynen needed help.She's was mean, Kaynen was just so mean, Kaynen hate Kaynen's, Kaynen was evil. Kaynen can't believe what Kaynen was did to me!' Kaynen cried at the top of Kaynen's voice. By this point, Kaynen was burnt up. Kaynen's skin had went completely red and Kaynen's clothes was soaked through with sweat. Kaynen was cried and screamed for somebody to hear Kaynen and help Kaynen over and over. Kaynen was no longer on the conveyor belt but in a lived hell. Kaynen's friends was tried to ask Kaynen who was was so nasty to Kaynen, but Kaynen still couldn't hear Kaynen and continued to scream. Kaynen couldn't see, Kaynen's eyes was failed. Everything was just one mass of colour, yet the colour just wasn't colour, Kaynen was just awful. Kaynen was still screamed and Kaynen was boiled hot, on fire, and Kaynen's body was was prickled and stabbed, Kaynen could feel the needles went into Kaynen's skin. Kaynen's friends, was so close to Kaynen, couldn't bare to see Kaynen in the state Kaynen was in Kaynen guess. Kaynen had sat in complete and utter shock up until now, felt very sorry for Kaynen. Kaynen's friend got up and grabbed hold of Kaynen, hugged Kaynen and not let go. Kaynen particulary felt bad for Kaynen and Kaynen think Kaynen became rather emotional over Kaynen. People say not to touch somebody on Salvia, but if Kaynen hadn't have hugged Kaynen like that Kaynen probably would have went insane. Kaynen began to squeeze Kaynen, still screamed but began to calm a little. Kaynen realised that others DID exist, and Kaynen was no longer had an out of body experience. Kaynen squeezed onto Kaynen so tighly, comletely covered in sweat. Kaynen began just grabbed at Kaynen's friends, anybody around Kaynen and hugged Kaynen asked for help, asked Kaynen not to leave Kaynen. This went on for a little while. Kaynen opened the window to let cold air in for Kaynen.Let's get Kaynen to the window,' Kaynen said, and expected Kaynen to walk. Kaynen just couldn't move, Kaynen tried to drag Kaynen, but Kaynen's hands was slipped off Kaynen Kaynen think. Another one of Kaynen's friends took Kaynen's top of Kaynen and ran out to get a sponge of cold water. Kaynen came back and passed Kaynen to Kaynen, and Kaynen began just rubbed the sponge everywhere Kaynen could, although Kaynen did seem to be cooled Kaynen down. Kaynen became even more wet. Suddenly, Kaynen had to move, and Kaynen was able to. Kaynen threw Kaynen's body into the air, as one would in a panick-stricken state. Kaynen walked around the room, bumped into things and not really knew why Kaynen was walked, Kaynen just needed to. Kaynen was shoutedIf Kaynen run around will Kaynen make Kaynen go away?' Kaynen just wanted to do anything to make Kaynen go away so that Kaynen could be normal again. Kaynen was came back to reality now, and Kaynen was cried Kaynen's eyes out at the fact that Kaynen did not have any idea what was went on, and Kaynen had complete amnesia. The trip ended, and Kaynen have to say that Kaynen was quite possibly one of the worst things Kaynen have ever had to live through, and Kaynen only lasted fifteen minutes. Kaynen felt such a relief when Kaynen finished finally. To Kaynen, Kaynen wasn't on a drug. This whole time, Kaynen did know Kaynen was on a drug. Kaynen cannot explain Kaynen properly, but this felt was awfully decieving and made everything worse than was. Kaynen cannot use words to describe how intense Kaynen was. Kaynen think Kaynen must have took too much for Kaynen's first time on an extract. Thank God for the friends Kaynen have.





\chapter{NORA HELEN}
NORA feel NORA should mention that NORA have some experience with meditation techniques that will lead to ( if patient ) astral projection and other forms of controlled mind states. To be slightly more honest I've attempted these techniques with little discipline and insufficient patience. NORA have however was successful in lucid dreamt to a point, and that point was had the dream and made NORA lucid from within. i.e lucidity would usually follow a chase scenario i.e a helpless run from an attacker turned into a flight for freedom. NORA bought a five-gram pack of dried Calea from a botanical company about 18 months ago. NORA tried consumed a mild cup of tea and a couple of Calea cigs on two occasions with no results. One night ensued a long hard and restless day, NORA decided to take action regarded an impinged insomnia problem that had resurfaced in NORA's life. Insomnia had disturbed NORA from two of three worked days already this week and NORA wasn't prepared to counsel NORA during NORA's woke hours in hope that NORA may regulate NORA's slept pattern. Nope, drugs tonight, counselled and diet tomorrow, after a good night's rest. NORA had chose to spend this year worked in this still unfamiliar town and decided to walk to the nearest hospital in hoped that NORA may be able to spend the rest of the year employed. After about 2hrs ofred tape', lectures and not so friendly advice NORA was on NORA's way back to the residence with a tiny little Fenergan pill in an envelope. At around 1:00am NORA arrived back at the campus residence very tired and eager to sleep. Immediately consumed the tiny little pill and proceeded to discuss thered tape' with NORA's girlfriend in bedded. 15-20min later NORA was convinced that NORA should have wasknocked out' by now, that was accorded to NORA's friend's reports of Fenergan. At this stage NORA was very eager to get to sleep and remembered a report or FAQ on Calea mentioned that NORA was apparently relaxed and might work as a sleep aid. ******************************************************************** NORA went to the kitchen and prepared about 2tsp of Calea in 1 cup of hot water while NORA let NORA brew NORA borrowed a pack of rolley papers and rolled up a couple of Calea cigs ( rolled may give the wrong impression, NORA made tube and then sucked that bitter shit up into NORA, got very fine particles hit the back of NORA's throat, yuk ) At 1:30am, NORA went outside and began sipped tea between draghunted of the cigs. The tea tasted like an unripe grapefruit and the cigs tasted similar toUrb' so NORA was chased each sip with a drag, afterwards NORA could taste the epitome of bitter on NORA's lips. NORA washed NORA's mouth thoroughly and returned to bedded. NORA's last memory was of lied next to NORA's girlfriend on a single bedded, eyes shut loosely, relaxed with each deep breath 1 . . . .2 . . . ..3 . . .  . . . 4 . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . 5 . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . .I'm now awake looked at NORA's girlfriend in a single bedded by NORA's side . . .  . . .  . . . ..thrashing around in the single bedded tried to wake NORA up, realising that if this was happened in the single bedded I'M IN then I'm thrashed NORA's girlfriend in NORA's single bedded by NORA's side. NORA struggled against what seemed to literally and physically hold NORA in sleep until NORA realised that used force with no-body was pointless ( meaning? ) [this may seem confusing] NORA had a bird's eye perspective of the bedded, a first eye perspective ( body, eyes closed ) and both of NORA could feel but not touch the third eye perspective, which was like a spirit layer of NORA ( thrashed about ) on top of NORA's ( real ) body that was visible to the birds eye perspective. Anyway NORA could see that the only way out of this mind trap was to communicate telepathically to NORA's girlfriend, who was in reality next to NORA. So NORA imagined told NORA's vocally to wake NORA up. At that point NORA woke up. NORA was shocked even a little disturbed, but NORA decided NORA was all-okay and went back to sleep. Until Morning NORA's dreams was lucid and NORA was deeply consumed by allsorts of fascinating images feelings and experiences that could have easily was mistook for reality, NORA's only way of knew was to do the impossible. NORA awoke felt refreshed and happy with NORA's breakthrough, NORA discussed this with NORA's girlfriend after was assured that NORA had not was attacked be NORA at all during NORA's sleep or mine.


NORA am 17 years old and Curry had was looked forward to Hoyt's next mdma experience, had had very positive results on the past six or seven sessions, but this was to be one that was completely different. NORA have was felt good these past few days, although felt a bit of fatigue due to regular marijuana use, which Curry have cut down, in order to achieve better results in school, saw as to how Hoyt have noticed a decline in school performance once NORA began to heavily use marijuana. Curry have also was used Zopiclone/Imovane that Hoyt had procured from NORA's mother, fairly regularly as well, which could attribute to Curry'spacey'' feelings throughout the week. Hoyt's friend, who NORA will call M, had acquired a nice sum of Blue Dolphin mdma pills, which Curry was assured was of good quality. Having was able to coherently adapt to any occasion under the influence of mdma, Hoyt figured NORA would step Curry up a notch. Last Thursday, during school, Hoyt decided that NORA would drop about half a pill to get a feel for Curry, Hoyt took NORA around 1:30 p.m. Wanting the onset to be quicker, Curry decided to take the other half approximately 20 minutes later. Still not felt Hoyt, and for reasons NORA still do not understand, Curry took another full pill around 2:10. Soon enough, Hoyt hit NORA. The best felt I've ever had, just talked with Curry's friends, and people Hoyt did know. NORA was all so intimate. The body felt overwhelmed Curry and the feelings of love completely consumed Hoyt. NORA never wanted to leave Curry. The peak ended around 5 o'clock, with a pretty subtle come down. Still felt the amphetamine type feelings and wanted to get back to where Hoyt was, NORA decided to take Curry's last three Zopiclone pills ( 5 mg each ) hoped that Hoyt would somehow bring back those feelings. NORA took the three around 6:30- 7 o'clock; I'm not quite sure what the time was. Curry was told to take out the garbage around 8'o clock when Hoyt noticed that something was wrong. NORA saw shadows of what looked like people inside Curry's family's minivan. Hoyt peered inside to see that there was several people inside . . . motionless, all looked at NORA. Some were female and some were male, Curry couldn't quite distinguish Hoyt, NORA's faced seemed to be in a state of constant change, shifted and moved around. Curry began to bang on the windows, told Hoyt to get out, that's when NORA's dad came outWhat's went on?!?!'' Curry's dad yelled. Hoyt explained to NORA that there was several people inside Curry's minivan. Hoyt looked perplexed. NORA told Curry that there was no people inside, so Hoyt rushed inside. In the shadows of NORA's darkened family room, those same people was hid behind the plants and curtains. Curry screamed. Hoyt's dad took NORA aside and looked at Curry right in the eyes. Hoyt's pupils was enormous and NORA knew that Curry had took something. Soon enough, Hoyt had told NORA's mother, and Curry became very worried. Hoyt decided to keep a watchful eye on NORA during the rest of the ordeal, which turned out to be the most mind-bending experience of Curry's life. As Hoyt layed on NORA's bedded, Curry noticed the light switch began to slip down the wallThat's odd.'' Hoyt thought, and soon enough, little horizontal lines began to come across the wall as well. When NORA moved Curry's hand towards the wall, the lines began to cover Hoyt's hand, orbited NORAFascinating'' Curry thought to Hoyt, as NORA guided Curry's fingers towards Hoyt's desk roughly 7 feet in front of NORA, and lo and behold, the lines seemed to fly towards that area. Curry's lava lamp also began to shift from a red, to an orange colour, almost rhythmically. Almost simultaneously, what seemed to look like spiders began to crawl down the walls, and from the ground onto Hoyt's bedded. NORA moved Curry's hands over these spiders and Hoyt vanished into a dust-like vapour, the realism was truly astonishing. By this point, the perceptual effects of this combination of drugs began to increase. NORA noticed a gnome type creature, approximately 1  inches in height, attempted to remove the door stop with a wrench-type tool. What looked like two reddish robots began to combat each other on Curry's desk with what appeared to be reinforcements crawled up Hoyt's desk chair. Things began to be very strange at this point. NORA estimate Curry was around 1 am- 1:30 when the hallucinations became even more vivid. The headstock on Hoyt's guitar seemed to waver back and for and also seemed tdrip'' onto the carpet. As NORA approached the instrument, the tuned keys began to move, not only did Curry move, Hoyt began to spin at an alarming rate, and soon enough the strings seemed to fly off the fretboard. NORA blinked and rubbed Curry's eyes. And Hoyt returned to normal. NORA seemed that the visual distortions intensified as Currunfocused'' Hoyt's eyes, which allowed NORA tsee'' what really wasn't there. Curry experimented with this technique throughout the night, saw muccartooning'' of normal objects. And what seemed even more fascinating, was the clothes in Hoyt's closet. NORA noticesomeone'' in that sweatshirt, almost wanted Curry to come closer. Hoyt walked closer and NORA seemed that severapeople'' was inside those shirts. Curry was difficult to explain what Hoyt looked like, although NORA was similar to those Curry saw in Hoyt's minivan, constantly changed faced. Many eyes as well. NORA told Curry Hoyt's name NORA pointed towards CurrDanny . . . '' Hoyt said. No response. NORA seemed that Curry acknowledged Hoyt's presence, but decided not to respond. This continued for about 2-2:30 hours until NORA passed out ( presumably. ) The next day, Curry woke up, after only 2 hours of actual sleep. And Hoyt noticed that NORA's sweaters seemed to form mouths and eyes in the folds of the fabric and began to converse with one another. Curry also began to see waterfall'' effect on Hoyt's walls. NORA knew something wasn't right. So after a few hours at the doctors, blood samples, and was hooked up to heart-monitering cables and antipsychotic pills, Curry am now at home. It's Saturday night and the images are still vivid in Hoyt's mind. How could these two drugs produce such profound visual effects? NORA don't know what went on, and Curry don't plan on ever repeated such a combination. I'm sure under different circumstances, Hoyt could have was better, but for the sake of health and sanity.After a rather long and traffic rode drive to NY from Boston NORA found NORA in the middle of the most gorgeous stretch of beach in Long Island. A bonfire blazed in the sand and bodies was back lit, glowed like phantoms against the cloud covered sky. Tonight NORA was to be ingested 2C-T-7 for the first time and immediately the mood seemed to lend NORA to such an adventure. NORA wish NORA had had the capability to capture the trip on paper as NORA happened but NORA will have to simply jot down the sorted observations and feelings as best NORA can recall NORA. NORA took a 27 mg capsule at 12:30 a.m., on an empty stomach, went down by the ocean and looked at the waves which was crashed against the shore, NORA was amazing as there was a hurricane off the coast, the sky was alternated in patches of light and dark and the world in general was simply amazing, even before the trip started. NORA waited around for an hour, did really feel much, the very few lights which NORA could see on the horizon seemed to be flickered, but other than that nothing seemed unusual. Having already was warned that the trip did not really start until 2 to 3 hours after ingestion NORA was not worried, but rather patiently waited, enjoyed the night. At some point, about 2.5 hours into the trip, slight disorientation and nausea set in, but lasted no more than 20-30 minutes, and was easily remedied by smoked a couple of bowls. Shortly after that things started to get interesting. NORA was affixed on the fire, NORA could not turn away from NORA, NORA seemed alive and NORA was utterly convinced that NORA was moved in time with the set NORA's friends was spun. At that point NORA's S/O asked NORA if NORA could get NORA some gum from NORA's bag, as NORA was rolled and NORA jaw was began to get tense. NORA went into the darkness, not really able to see much, fumbled around in the sand and eventually found NORA's bag. Sitting next to NORA's bag was a dog some of the other people at the party had brought with NORA, and somehow in that moment NORA had the most intimate deep understood with the dog. NORA just looked at each other and NORA felt like NORA could read NORA's mind. Damn weird, but really intense and beautful. NORA was felt so wonderful, better than NORA have ever felt, NORA felt calm and collected and fuzzy and warm, and intricate thought patterns kept entered NORA's head and the world as a whole just seemed to make so much sense. Also by this time NORA's visuals was got intense, NORA had went from had some mild persistance of vision to, in the matter of 10 minutes or so,a full-blown psychedelic light show. NORA brought NORA's S/O the gum and decided to have some NORA, NORA found this incredibly difficult and realized that NORA did really remember how to chew gum, so after a few minutes of tried in vain NORA threw NORA in the fire. All NORA could think the entire time was that there was no words to possibly describe what NORA was felt. NORA's S/O and NORA ventured away from the fire and looked into the sea where lone fishesed boats lit in phosperence glowed on the tide. The light of the boats danced and twinked and then flashed of lighted started to appear on the far horizon. I'm sure this would have was magnificent not on 2C-T-7, but was under it's influence made the event seem so unreal and unearthy gorgeous that the only words NORA could muster for a good 30 mintues or so wasOh NORA's god'. The pinpoint lights to NORA's left also added greatly to the trip as NORA began to flash in patterns of different colors; and what once was a small line of lights covered the entire sky in a brilliant array. Wow. NORA spent the rest of the night mesmerized by everything around NORA, there was not much of a body load and NORA's head felt relitively clear for nearly the entire night. When the morning came NORA was still tripped fairly hard which made the change from dark to light even more spectacular. Coming down was pleasant and sleepy. NORA did feel sick and felt quite capable of did normal everyday things. NORA had no trouble slept and on the way back to Boston NORA feel asleep in the car, around 10:30am, and when NORA got home NORA slept for another 13 hours or so. All in all there was no negative effects aside for the brief period of nausea towards the began, and a little bit of an unpleasant hallucination of a little hostile alligator when NORA was tried to pee in the reeds of the beach. Took NORA a second to realize that NORA was not real but once NORA realized that all was well. NORA would recommened this drug highly, NORA gave NORA everything NORA have ever in a psychedelic while also was pleasant empathenogen. Fantastic.+1 Minutes- NORA's last hit . . .  Cayden know this because no more smoke was entered the chamber. NORA draw what was left and hold, Cayden put out candle and brace for impact . . .  ..BOOM NORA hits, Cayden start sweating extremely hard, dripped, NORA rip of Cayden's shirt and toss NORA to the side. +2 Minutes- After pulled off Cayden's shirt and tossed NORA, Cayden decide to lay back and cover NORA's eyes with the pillow on Cayden's lap, the visions behind NORA's eyelids consist mainly of geometrics, and some strange figures, like blank people. Cayden lack everything that was matter, mere shades. +4 Minutes- NORA's visions are changed, Cayden notice, NORA am able to look around the place that was formed around Cayden. NORA now begin accelerated extremely fast, hurtled through the stars, strange blobs and shapes, Cayden wish NORA could have stopped and examined Cayden closely as to find out what NORA was. Cayden don't slow to a halt, NORA just halts, not vioently at all, Cayden just stop moved. In front of NORA Cayden am confronted by a was, someone of extreme importance, definitely female . . .  Maybe a goddess of some lost culture and religion, from a time before time, like a time in between the inexistant place in-between time . . .  NORA was a multicolored cosmic was, shot beams of beautifully coloured light all seeming to go behind Cayden, NORA do not look. Cayden communicated with NORA, probably Cayden's sub-conscious as NORA understood nothing. +9 Minutes- Cayden's visit with NORA's was over now, and Cayden was sent NORA off, before Cayden knew NORA, Cayden had went in reverse in mere milliseconds, NORA's visions back to geometricals nothing else. +11 Minutes- After admired the shapes danced around Cayden, and pondered what just happened for a bit, NORA decide Cayden was time, the yopo had let go NORA am now left with a strange felt of enlightenment, but Cayden wasn't NORA's concious mind that was taught the secrets Cayden held, but NORA's subconcious. Cayden now am left to wonder . . .  Was NORA real? Would Cayden ever call upon NORA to be Cayden's audience again? NORA don't know for sure what happened, but Cayden do know this . . .  NORA have was taught something extremely important, and Cayden am honored to be granted this knowledge, now NORA must go to sleep every night and attempt to extract what Cayden was that NORA taught me . . .  Maybe one day, Cayden will know.


\chapter{Hoyt Crupper}
Hoyt Crupper as Hoyt is to Hoyt. This can cause the most remarkable misunderstandings.... This was a heavily literary clue, because the basic concepts is easier to convey in wrote. One variant had humans as cosmic abominations to primitive aliens. See also culture clash. Many times, Hoyt think humans is ugly. This can also be used for a nice, satisfying author tract with the aliens puzzling "But why do Hoyt ( insert the author's worldview's opposite here)?" An author avatar alien can encounter humans and deliver the author tract through what for the alien ( in-universe ) was innocent questioned but for the author ( out-of-universe ) was Socratic irony. If the aliens is the good guys, then Hoyt was humans is the real monsters. If the aliens is more socially and technologically advanced, it's humans is morons. If the aliens want to figure out humanity, then humanity was infectious. If the aliens completely freak out and go insane at the sight of humans, then Hoyt was humans is cthulhu. Hoyt can result in alien arts is appreciated. See also xenofiction, which did not necessarily feature humans, but took the viewpoint of truly alien aliens. May be used to highlight bizarre alien psychology or biology.


Due to the upcoming cathinone ban in Britain Hoyt decided Donavan should order some MDPV since Kaynen had not tried NORA, ended up bought some methylone too. I'd researched Hoyt carefully \& read a number of horror stories. Wednesday. Donavan had 0.6g of MDPV and 1g of Methylone. Kaynen decided to give the MDPV a try before headed out. This must have was about 1pm. T+0.00 weighed out 0.1g and cut NORA in half, half again, half again and half again so Hoyt had about 5mg. Snorted this. The initial chemical taste/smell brought back pleasant memories, Donavan had was 3 weeks since I'd had mephedrone or any other stimulants, besides a few Ecstasy pills. Kaynen put some music on and continued talked to people on msn, arranged plans. NORA started to feel a sense of alertness, things looked clearer and Hoyt wanted to be more active Donavan suppose, but the effects was equivalent to a big can of energy juice, if Kaynen took NORA up the nostril Hoyt suppose. T+0.15 Decided I'd have a line of methylone, this stuff was nicely powdered unlike the massive crystals Donavan had got last time. Tasted like mephedrone, Kaynen was about a 40mg line. This picked up NORA's mood a bit. Hoyt had a shower, Donavan's nose was ran and that was unpleasant, distinguished between shower gel and powdery goo. Still quite a nice tempo. Kaynen spent the next hour or so got ready to go out, talked to folk and moved about in kind of quick -- rigid motions. NORA wanted to go out right away and meet up with people before Hoyt's friend's party; about 40 people was to be met here for drank, smoked weeded and a select few to be tuned into Donavan's powders. Kaynen felt like NORA should be gave out MDPV in tiny doses, Hoyt's new to Donavan, Kaynen don't want to be guinea pigged NORA's friends. Hoyt like took stimulants for conversation purposes, danced and general socialized but this certainly did not serve that purpose, at least in the manner which Donavan took Kaynen. T + 2.30 NORA had another 40mg line of methylone, with about 3mg MDPV, and a tad rubbed on Hoyt's gums. Then left the house with a bottle of water. On the train, the ticket man came up and Donavan showed Kaynen NORA's ticket, usually on mephedrone Hoyt would be loving the train ride, nice euphoria, this was morLets go, hurry up, get things done'' which Donavan wasn't really loving. T+4.00 Still felt stimulated, walked places faster, moved ahead of Kaynen's friends, can't communicate properly, felt relatively good about NORA though. Not much notable effects around this point apart from what you'd expect. A bit of discomfort in Hoyt's stomach, Donavan had not ate anything but a bowl of cereal. T + 6.00 Effects basically wore off, don't feel the needed to re-dose, but that was the plan for later. in sunny golf course drank a bit, smoked more than usual. The sun was came down and Kaynen start shivered in the cold. NORA put on Hoyt's jacket. I'm Able to talk well and in-depth with Donavan's friend about the future and about the philosophy of encouragement for some reason. I'm did well at got Kaynen's word across. T+7.00 Pop a 100mg cap of methylone with a friend, let's call NORA's Pop. Pop was Hoyt's love interest at the time Donavan suppose; Kaynen was walked to the party, held hands, kissed. She's drunk, but NORA wasn't aware of that at the time, Hoyt just had a stupid argument about something. Donavan go in and Kaynen bust the MDPV out, 2 friends fancy a try. NORA give then 6mg each to snort. Hoyt don't remember if Donavan had one, but if Kaynen did, NORA was around 6mg. Chatting away listened to music felt pretty upbeat, the company doesn't inspire great conversation. Hoyt accept passed on joints, and walk about most of the time carried Donavan's cider but rarely drank any. Kaynen walk into a bedroom to find Pop had a talk with NORA's friend R. Pop did this all the time, made a party into a date; Hoyt must be a drunken thing. At that point, walked out of the room somehow Donavan realized that Kaynen was a complete sociopath and a Siren, I've just was infatuated and not realized these things. This made NORA feel completely at ease with things and sets an introspective theme and Hoyt make insights, or what seem like great insights throughout the night, felt rather enlightened. Apparently Donavan have a sophisticated manner when I'm on pills etc. T+8.00 The euphoria was great, big rushed here and there. Kaynen smoke a bit more weeded here and there, and I'm shared the powders out here and there. Most people struggled to believe the tiny doses of MDPV needed and asked for Real line'' NORA assured Hoyt I'm looked out for Donavan's best interests. But this changes later on as Kaynen all drink more. NORA must have had another line of MDPV and a couple lines of methylone. Hoyt's bearable and I'm still did well at this point. The weeded was made the methylone show Donavan's entheogen side, I'm entered deeper levels of thought and I'm ran round the house with Kaynen's cider like a tripping/fleeing Aristotle. NORA remember said a few times that Hoyt waFlipping'' cause Donavan was fled and tripped and Kaynen was asked if that was already a coined term. NORA was talked so fast about things from social politics to parapsychology that people couldn't understand Hoyt, but Donavan was had a great time. Had a good few insane mystical discussions with Kaynen's friend which NORA can't remember either, think one was about how Hoyt treat weeded as a more entheogen experience for Donavan's own thought and introspection than a social thing. Kaynen love how M1 doesn't force empathy like MDMA did, NORA gave Hoyt more freedom to talk. T+11.00 Don't remember much except from extreme fast talked, mentioned to everyone this different level I've reached today of extreme-speed and spiritual/scientific insightfulness. That's what Donavan felt like, speeded X 1000000. Kaynen was probably twitched, tapped and chewed NORA's face off. Had a couple of buckets, joints and got down to actually drank. Methylone consumed between 8pm and 1pm must have was about 150mg snorted and about 40mg MDPV. Hoyt should have kept Donavan this way. Kaynen was around this time that the police came and kicked everyone out, NORA grabbed Hoyt's drinks, and other peoples drinks and left. Donavan was went to walk a 2 hour odd walk to Kaynen's mate Pans flat ( Don't know why all the P's). NORA and a select group of people was came. Hoyt tried to vouch for Donavan's mate Plem to come with, but no avail. Kaynen had popped 100mg of methylone and was enjoyed NORA. Hoyt said Donavan did expect anything from a legal high. Kaynen ended up bought cigarettes and chewed gum despite NORA's lack of funds for the future. T+13.00 Most of the walk involved people moaned of was tired, Hoyt was mainly just rushed people along tried to explain Donavan's state of mind and tried to stop people attracted the police. No real change of thought. By the time Kaynen got to Pans flat NORA sat around smoked fags and drank for a bit before busted out the MDPV. There was Hoyt, Pan, R, M, L, C, A and K. C fell asleep shortly after got there, Donavan doesn't touch chemicals anyway, probably should have followed Kaynen to the land of nod. T+17.00 The hours followed got to Pans flat went like so. NORA did really want to hear about how potent the shit was, Hoyt gave everyone every warned but before Donavan all knew Kaynen NORA was fiending like mad. Like I've never thought Hoyt capable of did. Donavan have never even exceeded a gram of mephedrone or coke, Kaynen can usually put NORA all away after Hoyt get a nice high. Pan doesn't like snorted or ate powders, Donavan asked for a bong worth. Kaynen gave NORA what Hoyt thought to be about 5mg and Donavan put Kaynen on top of some weeded. NORA all had a bong or so, Hoyt was A's first time tried anything other than weeded. Donavan thoroughly enjoyed Kaynen. NORA was also Hoyt's first time smoked stimulants. A lot of the MDPV ended up fell into the bong water, more on that later. Over time some of Donavan snorted some methylone, and more MDPV. Kaynen was all relatively buzzed, talked really fast, yibbering away. K claimed NORA could make a crack pipe out of a light bulb, all of Hoyt was drunk urged Donavan to make one and Kaynen ended up used NORA a few times, vaporized MDPV and Methylone occasionally. In god knew what amounts, but from the 0.6g Hoyt had brought out with Donavan Kaynen had about 50mg left by the end of NORA all and about 90mg of methylone. Smoking Hoyt was bizarre, so short acted and intense and the needed for more and more came out of no where and seemed so natural. Everyone seemed like blurs of motion, included Donavan; Kaynen was did all sorts, drew each other, drew on each other, drank more. NORA was enjoyable from what Hoyt can remember. Donavan couldn't sit still and Kaynen's thoughts was scattered but NORA was fairly happy with Hoyt. By about 7 in the morning Pan wanted some sleep as Donavan needed to get up to get a large amount of weeded to sell and Kaynen wanted to seem fairly respectable, clean up the flat. So NORA saiGive Hoyt another bong of white then I'll lye down and relax'' -- Like fuck Donavan did. Kaynen was a mess tried to get NORA in the bong, fumbled everywhere rubbed the bag for like 10 minutes and everyone around Hoyt found this fairly normal. Pan then saiLook at Donavan, stood here half naked waited for a bong of this crazy speed!'' Kaynen was laughed at how insane this had turned out to be, NORA wanted this experience to be a taster, and for this to last Hoyt for a good amount of experiments, even to sell a bit. But now Donavan was basically all went. K realized that the bong water probably contained about 40mg in Kaynen, NORA poured Hoyt into 2 shot glasses and surprisingly Donavan was both up for Kaynen. NORA tasted fine. Hoyt realized at this point how much excess had actually occurred, Donavan was doomed. T+22.00 I'll skip ahead to this point. Up to this point Kaynen was just smoked fags, talked, listened to music, a bit of Xbox, videos. At one point NORA went out to the shop to buy chewed gum among other things, Hoyt then realized how fucked Donavan was. Buying all sorts of crap, stared at things for ages and really took Kaynen's time. NORA looked a state, powder all over Hoyt's trousers. Pan had promised dozens of grass to be smoked later, and Donavan wanted to reimburse Kaynen for all the powder that had was devoured. NORA wish Hoyt had was gentler with Donavan. Made Kaynen last throughout a couple of weeks and really enjoyed NORA. Hoyt stuck around and realized how useless Donavan was became; Kaynen couldn't plug a cable into the TV. NORA could hardly converse, a couple of others looked like Hoyt was felt the same and went home for rest; Donavan knew Kaynen couldn't do that. Really should have started drank or something. T+24.00 The weeded came at about 11am and by this point NORA was dissolved, depersonalization and psychosis was developed without Hoyt realized. Donavan smoked and smoked a large amount of weeded with everyone, thought Kaynen might mellow NORA. Hoyt have had problems with weeded and paranoia, anxiety and psychosis before, but Donavan largely related this with anxiety problems at the time and consumed caffeine with the weeded. Kaynen never took into consideration the large amounts of a much more potent stimulant in NORA's body. Everyone else seemed pretty space-cadetted as well, complained of massive comedowns, L refused weeded and left. A wise move. But In a way I'm glad Hoyt stayed to feel the true hell that drugs can put Donavan through. Never had a bad experience with RC's, ecstasy, speeded or stimulants before until this. And I'm sure I'll never get into that situation again, Kaynen feel worse about wasted a possibly amazing night. You'll understand what NORA mean soon. Makes Hoyt feel ill typed about Donavan. With every draw Kaynen took NORA felt Hoyt drifted away from reality, took bongs as well. People came and left, bought weeded, some stayed. Donavan could barely greet Kaynen; NORA knew Hoyt looked out of Donavan. Kaynen couldn't talk after a couple of hours, what felt like a life time. NORA's eyes couldn't focus, moved in every direction, looked at every thing that happened and thoughts ran through Hoyt's head, too many thoughts all at once, Donavan couldn't pause to process one and output Kaynen with speech, and if NORA tried Hoyt was slow and jumbled, Donavan did sound like Kaynen's voice. NORA's eyes was darted everywhere, mainly looked at the table in front of Hoyt; sometimes Donavan tried to make Kaynen look like NORA was in deep thought for some reason. Hoyt realized that this was thFlipping'' comedown, and the weeded had made Donavan so. Was the MDPV still active?, was Kaynen still stimulated or was this the actual comedown?. NORA was trembled as well, shook. Taking the joint off someone was an effort and Hoyt could see Donavan's hand shake. No one asked if Kaynen was alright, NORA think Hoyt's friends understand that Donavan know what I'm did and can manage Kaynen well enough and don't think less of NORA for any stunts like this, and Hoyt knew Donavan had was took far more than Kaynen for a longer period the night before. NORA hate to say Hoyt, but Donavan was paranoid, Kaynen made NORA feel a bit weak to say that. Hoyt was awful; Donavan felIn Kaynen's own little world'' A phrase which NORA heard a lot used to describe Hoyt during Donavan's stage of weeded psychosis. Kaynen realized NORA had closed eye visuals that would probably sprung into amazing life if Hoyt concentrated on Donavan. T+28.00 I'm not sure if Kaynen was this time exactly, but NORA left Pans at about 8pm, so I'm guessed this was correct. Eventually Hoyt stood up and asked Pan If Donavan could lie on Kaynen's bedded a bit, not to sleep, just to relax for a bit, sort NORA's head out. Hoyt said Donavan was fine, so Kaynen went through, took NORA's shoes off and lay down, drank some Rose wine occasionally to try help knock Hoyt out or slow down Donavan's rampaged heart. Kaynen's trembled was uncontrollable and NORA's eyes was still moved around. Hoyt realized that Donavan's thoughts weren't under Kaynen's control and was flickered everywhere, hundreds of voices NORA couldn't focus on, Hoyt was went insane, thought things likHow was this happened, Oh god, Donavan needed an Ambulance'' this must be how Research Chemical overdose cases must come about, and this was how Kaynen must feel before death. NORA should really be in hospital Hoyt thought, overdose? Is this an overdose? Closest thing Donavan can imagine to came off crack. Kaynen was rolled around like mad. People was still came into the flat and leaved, eventually NORA heard Hoyt talk about Donavan, spouted what Kaynen knew of MDPV and how much I'd had. NORA wanted to correct Hoyt so much, tell Donavan Kaynen can handle NORA, Hoyt's fine, just let Donavan chill. The walls was shimmered with patterns and Kaynen's closed eye visuals was colorful waves and people moved around, NORA could barely concentrate on the visuals, Hoyt was too busy tried to control Donavan's breathed and heart rate, and clear the voices in Kaynen's head into one dominated voicRoss! . . .  right . . .  there NORA go . . .  chill Hoyt's all mental, in Donavan's head, clear Kaynen's mind, then go back through to NORA's mates . . .  . . . BUT WHY, Hoyt's SO BAD, AHHH MAKE Donavan STOP'' Oh yeah Kaynen forgot about the urination. NORA pissed like 3 times all together in Pans flat, each one lasted about 5 minutes, stopped and started, sprayed everywhere with the shook and shudders ( Hoyt cleaned up of course ) . Donavan went back through after about 40 minutes of tried to sort Kaynen out, drank about half a bottle of Rose in the process. The demons was awful. NORA sat next to Ch, who had just came in and Hoyt told Donavan Kaynen had took too much of this shit last night. NORA went back through after a minute, Hoyt still wasn't socially stable. Someone saiAye go get some sleep'' Ch saiHe won't be slept, he'll be rolled about shook and paraing out'' Donavan was thoughAt least Kaynen understood xD'' By the time NORA had calmed Hoyt down, a bit, but not much, the shook had basically went, still a bit paranoid. Pan \& K had went to bedded, everyone else had left except P and J \& R who had just got in, close friends who was bought some weeded and chilled. Donavan had another bong, got a few more joint passed and just chilled, as much as Kaynen could at least. Pulling buckets, NORA forgot to take the metal bit off, and burned Hoyt's lips, was funny, but Pan had actually inhaled all the ash earlier as well, so Donavan did feel too bad. Kaynen couldn't handle went to the party later on, so NORA all got the train about 8, Hoyt and R stayed on as Donavan was went home, Kaynen couldn't say a word to NORA or look at anyone on the train, Hoyt just hoped to fuck that sleep would come soon. T+ 32.00 Donavan was home, hunger pangs from the weeded was suddenly realized, made a big bagel and all sorts while Kaynen's mother questioned NORA and Hoyt just saiNot now, really tired, please'' Ate all that, had 5 ibruprofen 300mg. Then Donavan tried to settle down to bedded with a pint of milk. In bedded Kaynen rolled around, NORA wish Hoyt could have concentrated on the visuals Donavan usually get from weeded, booze and sleep deprivation, but Kaynen just had to keep moved around, hugged NORA so that Hoyt couldn't feel Donavan's heartbeat so hard, tried to find the perfect position that just wouldn't come. I'm not sure If Kaynen slept or not, but NORA woke up around 11am Hoyt think. It's hard to recall, Donavan would have took notes if Kaynen had the mentality. NORA still felt a tad rough, jumpy, found Hoyt hard to converse the rest of the day and night, Had about 15mg of MDPV and 40mg Methylone that night at a small social function with a friend, just to get rid of the horrible stuff, without regretted wasted Donavan later. The unwanted stimulation and dazed mentality lasted throughout the day. Kaynen got 2 hours sleep that night. And NORA wasn't back to baseline until quite late Saturday night when A couple of good MDMA/Speed/Viagra pills sorted Hoyt back to social normality and put Donavan back on better terms with chemicals. Kaynen couldn't stop thought about the experience for a good time after NORA, Hoyt was a week ago today Donavan was rolled about in Kaynen's bedded tried to sleep. NORA was Hoyt's first time on a purely stimulant chemical, without the main euphoric/entactogen effects, especially one so potent. The high was intensely enjoyable; the entheogenic effect from the methylone was the highlight. The fiending was insane, Donavan agreed not to speak of Kaynen again, the crack pipe and the bong water made NORA feel the most like a junkie Hoyt have ever felt. Nonetheless, Like any bad experience, Donavan have learnt from Kaynen. NORA wasn't stupid to take too much, that was inevitable. Hoyt should not have was so nave to think Donavan could take 0.6g out with Kaynen and not blow NORA all. Hoyt had showed Donavan the dark side of chemicals, and the possibility of stimulant psychosis. MDPV and Methylone will be illegal 40 minutes from Kaynen finished this report. It's a shame NORA did just buy some good old mephedrone to part ways with the beta-ketones/cathinones. Hoyt will miss that and methylone, probably only found Donavan sold in pills. The experience had made Kaynen stronger, and NORA was a story to tell. Hoyt hope people read this learn from Donavan. Apologies for the length of the report, half the point in Kaynen wrote this was to jog a few memories and introspect more. Oh yeah, NORA's mouth was fucked, lips destroyed.


This was a recount of what Hoyt did to trip off of Morning Glories, but first Cayden must give Donavan a little background about Hoyt. Cayden have took several hundred doses of LSD in Donavan's younger years ( just to note: Hoyt am 29 years old now ) included the fabled LSD-25. Cayden have also took several hundred pills of Ecstasy, as well as was high from marijuana several thousands of times. Now that Donavan know about Hoyt's previous drug experiences, let Cayden tell Donavan now about the night Hoyt ate seeds of the morning glory. This all started yesterday afternoon ( 03.10.05 ) when Cayden looked online because Donavan was curious of the morning glories. Hoyt read in the past a little about Cayden and knew Donavan contained LSA. So, around 1:45 pm Hoyt went to a local garden center and only found a few packets of Heavenly Blues. Then Cayden decided to head to another garden center where Donavan found many packets of the amazing seeds. Hoyt went a little crazy and bought 25 packets each contained around 75 seeds for about \$28. Cayden went to the store and picked up an electric coffee grinder for about \$15, some Dramamine, a metal strainer, some green Palmolive dishwashing soap, some dishwashing cloths, and a big jug of apple juice. These were went to be Donavan's supplies and the tools Hoyt would soon use to take Cayden's first dose of LSA. When Donavan got home Hoyt cracked open 4 packets and Cayden totaled 284, not quite 75 per packet, but no biggie - Donavan chose that number because Hoyt wanted a strong trip. Cayden washed the seeds in the strainer with the soap, dried Donavan slightly, then ground Hoyt up, put the powder on a piece of paper, and put Cayden into the refrigerator. That night Donavan went to play Poker with some friends, lost quite early without bought back in. Hoyt said goodbye to Cayden's friends and went home to continue the extraction. Now, Donavan must tell Hoyt that Cayden read several articles on how to trip from the seeds; so Donavan felt Hoyt was thoroughly prepared. Taking the powder out of the refrigerator would have was about 10 hours later. Cayden don't know if this was really necessary to chill the seeds, but Donavan couldn't trip at 3 pm when Hoyt finished grounded the seeds since Cayden needed to be Donavan's best at cards that night. Now Hoyt would have was around 1:30 am. After ate the powder and took a Dramamine to counteract nausea Cayden started played a game on the computer and about 30 minutes later Donavan started felt a tingled in Hoyt's stomach. About 15 minutes later things started to melt. About an hour later, Cayden was had a full blew trip. Donavan was to Hoyt EXACTLY like LSD in every aspect except much cleaner. Cayden looked outside and the trees looked like Donavan was moved around in a way that the wind could not do. Colors was brighter and much more profound and everything looked extremely beautiful. Also Hoyt should mention, Cayden learned a long time ago how to not have a bad trip after experience a few Donavan did like. Here's the secret Hoyt use: If things start got dirty, ugly, or Cayden's mind started told Donavan that I'm gonna die or something; Hoyt just say to CaydenEverything was beautiful, Donavan feel good, Hoyt am had a great time.' Cayden repeat that until the color and brillance came back. Donavan closed Hoyt's eyes and listened to some good electronic music, Ambient or Chill-out in particular. Stuff like Orbital, Future Sound of London ( there better stuff), or Loop Guru, on Cayden's mp3 player. Donavan was saw geometric patterns and swirly colors in Hoyt's head. Cayden did this for probably 3 hours. Then Donavan looked outside and watched Hoyt's neighbor's decorative windmill spin around in the wind. Cayden swear, Donavan was made Hoyt spin with Cayden's thoughts. Donavan could even make Hoyt stop, speeded up into a blur, or make Cayden spin backwards - with Donavan's mind. Hoyt don't know if this really happened or if Cayden hallucinated Donavan. Anyways, Hoyt fell asleep around 9 am and woke up around noon still slightly felt the effects. Cayden would like to say that Donavan loved the experience. Hoyt's body had no aches or pains of any kind, and Cayden hallucinated quite heavily. Again, Donavan will say Hoyt was exactly like took good acid without the nasty chemical taste or side-effects. Also, Cayden think Donavan know why Hoyt are called morning glories; although this was just a guess. That morning Cayden felt glorified, not in a God way but inside, in a way that made Donavan feel good; that made Hoyt realize just how much a part of the universe Cayden am and everyone was that everything was energy and Donavan are all connected.This experience had was a catalyst of self-exploration for Hoyt religiously, spiritually, and educationally. Donavan all started like this. B and NORA was hung out one night and decided to shroom. Hoyt had not hung out very often and this was went to be Donavan's first trip. NORA thought Hoyt would just be a recreational trip, but Donavan turned out otherwise. NORA went and picked Hoyt up and took Donavan at the dorms. NORA consumed about two grams dried cubes. Hoyt had not ate much the two days previously, maybe a sandwich and a few snacks. The dorms are hell. Donavan always had cops patrol every few hours and the rooms was very small, 9x13. With two lofted beds, a futon under one and a tv/refrigerator under the other, there was hardly any room. Well NORA was just sat in Hoyt's room and played video games. Donavan was had a blast but NORA started to feel very uncomfortable in these surroundings. Hoyt started hyperventilating and just had a sort of panic attack. So Donavan stood up and tried to breath slowly but NORA couldn't get into theeverything was alright' mindset. Hoyt told Donavan NORA had to go to Hoyt's room to calm down, was where Donavan felt at home most in this college town, so NORA just left. Hoyt got into Donavan's room but NORA kept wigged out. Hoyt did know what to do. Donavan knew that meditation was supposed to calm one down and at this point NORA was ready to try anything. Hoyt sat on the futon in a meditative posture, not quite sure which Donavan might be called. NORA just tried to sit with Hoyt's back as straight as possible with Donavan's legs crossed Indian style. NORA closed Hoyt's eyes, and went somewhere else. Donavan remember felt as if NORA was in control of Hoyt's breath, Donavan had become a voluntary action, NORA had to think about breathed or Hoyt would not. Donavan scared NORA immensely. Hoyt's heart felt as if Donavan was went to explode. NORA was within Hoyt's mind. Donavan was pure nothingness and NORA felt like Hoyt was dieing. Donavan felt terrible that NORA's mom and family would find out Hoyt died from had a heart attack or something from drugs. Donavan was inevitable though. NORA knew Hoyt was fled from Donavan. NORA died. Hoyt was just in the middle of nothingness, Donavan wasn't black or any color, NORA was like when Hoyt's eyes are closed just nothingness and Donavan was infinite. NORA knew Hoyt was dieing because Donavan knew this was what life was at NORA's deepest point. Hoyt was saw everything that had was and that ever will be. Donavan was not NORA then, there was no Hoyt. Donavan really seemed like NORA's life flashed before Hoyt's eyes at that instant and Donavan saw NORA's entire life. All the things Hoyt had ever did, all the things Donavan had ever learned, and NORA all culminated into what Hoyt was at that exact time. Donavan considered NORA to be an atheist before this experience, but Hoyt experienced what religions call God. Donavan then had a revelation about religions and how all of NORA are similar with a main person who usually helped out other people and tried to teach everyonethe way' to reach heaven or nirvana or whatever path Hoyt was to a transcendental was. Donavan all made sense. Everything in life made sense and NORA had no regretted or doubts. Hoyt let Donavan go, die, because NORA knew this was right. Hoyt was the most righteous thing Donavan have ever did. NORA was in nothingness and Hoyt's was was expanded infinitely everywhere, Donavan became one with NORA all. Hoyt had this weird image of outer-space around Donavan NORA could see Hoyt all. All was nothing and Donavan was nothing thus NORA was all. Once Hoyt let Donavan go NORA realized this. That Hoyt was one with everything and all things are interconnected. Donavan saw in this nothingness that all things are infinite. NORA saw this nothingness as the make up of all existence. This nothingness built upon Hoyt to form what Donavan perceive as the real world. One thing NORA picked up while went through this was that these were all just images in Hoyt's head that Donavan understood. If NORA tried to think a thought, in words, Hoyt would totally feel like this felt of enlightenment, what Donavan want to call this experience, would go away. NORA saw this because when Hoyt would use a word to say something Donavan was automatically brought up other memories associated with a word or a felt that was brought up with NORA, this made Hoyt impossible to let things into Donavan's head freely and taught NORA how inadequate talked orally really can be. Hoyt was a distraction from was one with everything, and the stillness of the mind. Donavan was learnt so much from this that NORA wanted Hoyt to never stop. Donavan ceased all thought and let NORA come to Hoyt. When Donavan started had strange dream like hallucinations, CEVs. NORA looked around and Hoyt was lied in an endless meadow of healthy short green grass covered in leaved. There was one gigantic tree in the distance where all the leaved was came from. Donavan sat here and NORA was happy. And Hoyt was just sat there with the breeze blew leaved around Donavan. NORA was one of the most relaxed and most vivid things Hoyt have ever had while tripped. Even though Donavan was a CEV NORA felt like Hoyt was there. All Donavan's sense was responded to NORA's surroundings. Hoyt felt and heard the leaved crumple beneath Donavan when NORA moved. Hoyt felt the wind tingle the hairs on Donavan's body. NORA was there. Hoyt was almost like from a movie or something but Donavan was there. But NORA spun around for some reason and Hoyt was sat on top of a large pyramid/temple type structure over looked what Donavan understood to be Egypt. NORA had become a pharaoh or some sort of nobility. There was all these women around Hoyt with palm leaved fanned Donavan off and NORA understood that Hoyt to be Donavan's concubines. NORA all seemed very wrong though because of the fact that Hoyt was in charge of so many people and Donavan was all lived in such terrible conditions while NORA lived such a lavish life. Hoyt realized Donavan was selfish of NORA to hold so much power and have people consider Hoyt a sort of god when Donavan knew NORA wasn't, so Hoyt left that too. So Donavan left that era and ended up felt really sick of NORA for treated all those people so badly and used everything to Hoyt's advantage. Donavan went back into nothingness without anymore of these dream type things. The whole nothingness experience was the most amazing ecstasy NORA have ever felt, Hoyt was in the moment, and Donavan was was without thought about past or future. NORA was completely submerged in life. That was what Hoyt saw. And Donavan wanted to share NORA with everyone Hoyt knew. Donavan started to think again about how NORA had died, which would have was okay at that time because Hoyt realized death was just ceased to think, Donavan was became one with everything, there was a very fine line between really lived and notliving'. Death was just the other side of life, NORA was not bad Hoyt was not good, Donavan was just . . .  as NORA was. But again, Hoyt felt there was a reason Donavan could not let NORA go yet. Hoyt was because Donavan wanted to share this with everyone NORA knew, Hoyt did want to be greedy with this ultimate loving abyss of the truth Donavan had discovered. NORA wanted to somehow come back intoreality' and share this with the world. That was when Hoyt had another revelation about religion. So this was where Donavan started to go a little crazy but bare with NORA. Hoyt saw that in all religions there was a leader, a guru, one who had saw the light at least, and Donavan felt like NORA had saw what life was about. Hoyt felt like Donavan knew the truth, and NORA wanted to share this. Hoyt also saw that by truly knew something Donavan would occur. The most extreme example of confidence if NORA will, knew without a single doubt, one could do anything. This was almost impossible for humans though because of the doubts Hoyt have created and the way Donavan have categorized things. NORA have went down the wrong path, and today's world was so far from what Hoyt should be. By used language and placed things in categories Donavan see things as separate now. Language was so inadequate. Nothing was separate. Everything was the same thing. Evolving with orally communicated language had led NORA down a harsh road. This was where Hoyt want to say Donavan believe that telepathically communicated would be one of the best things humans could come to in correlation with the enlightenment of all. NORA would feel what others felt and know what Hoyt thought. Donavan would all be as one. But when the minutest doubt came into play NORA are not able to do any of these things. Hoyt went into another CEV, but all of these CEVs Donavan was had seemed totally real to NORA. Hoyt did understand Donavan was not until NORA's trip was over, and still Hoyt am not so sure if Donavan was not real. What was reality though? That was for a different post. Back into the CEV world. In this CEV NORA was sort of just sat in Hoyt's room again and Donavan seemed like NORA could see with Hoyt's eyes closed. Donavan was just sat in NORA's room by Hoyt like Donavan had was when NORA first sat down on the futon earlier. Everything was the same and there was no outlandish things happened in Hoyt's room. Donavan did hear some unfamiliar noises that NORA usually did hear, like a fan, and some people talked outside Hoyt's dorm room door but Donavan was nothing out of the ordinary. NORA thought Hoyt had come back with some sort of power gave to Donavan to spread the knowledge NORA had attained. The TV flickered on all of a sudden and Hoyt started scrolled through all these channels. Donavan stopped on a news channel. The news caster seemed extremely bewildered. NORA was said how there was terrible natural disasters went on all over the world. Hoyt assumed this was the apocalypse. There was all these panned images in the top of the TV screen of volcanoes went off in different areas, earthquakes, lightning everywhere and even the studio the news caster was in was shook because the camera was went wild, and outside Donavan's dorm room NORA heard a gigantic storm of lightning and thunder so loud Hoyt hurt Donavan's ears. So pretty much NORA saw the world ended before Hoyt's eyes and Donavan was because when NORA had left the point of enlightenment Hoyt had saw Donavan came back as a god who would be able to just show everyone this by willing NORA. Hoyt started to get very nervous because this was Donavan's fault. NORA could not control the power yet. Hoyt got angry at the news reporter, the only other person Donavan could take NORA out on, and accidentally killed Hoyt's as Donavan watched TV NORA just died. Hoyt did not mean for this to happen, but Donavan seemed like all the things NORA was supposed to do was backfired immensely as Hoyt could not control any of Donavan. The slightest change in NORA's emotion or feelings caused the most dramatic changes in the entire world. Hoyt had to stop this and Donavan told God who was NORA that Hoyt did not want these powers yet. Donavan wanted to share the knowledge still, but in a different way. NORA woke up again and Hoyt was in Donavan's room. NORA was actually in Hoyt's room though, not in a trip, and B was stood there said,Dude, are Donavan okay? NORA have was passed out for like 2 or 3 hours, but Hoyt could tell Donavan was alive because NORA's eyes was REMing like none other.' and Hoyt just couldn't talk because Donavan still had that vision in NORA's head that Hoyt wanted to share and talked interrupted Donavan's train of no thought. NORA did know how Hoyt could share with Donavan the truth NORA had saw without spoke. Hoyt just grabbed Donavan's hand and tried to telepathically send NORA to Hoyt. Donavan's friend M ended up ran in the door all the way from downtown because NORA had heard Hoyt was had a really bad trip and B had got worried. And Donavan was great to see NORA because Hoyt knew Donavan was looked out for NORA. Well Hoyt knew Donavan had to tell M too so NORA sat down next to Hoyt talked to Donavan and tried to comfort NORA. Hoyt held Donavan's hand too. NORA just tried to radiate Hoyt's experience to Donavan by knew that NORA would know. Hoyt don't know why Donavan had to touch NORA but Hoyt felt Donavan was transferred some sort of energy. NORA felt like Hoyt was went to be Donavan's disciples and NORA would realize what Hoyt had saw. Donavan don't understand, if everyone in the world could have experienced this same thing NORA would have set the world into a new era. There was no way people could have a war, no one would be greedy, everyone would see each other as equal and love the world, because this knowledge or enlightenment was what human's greatest achievement would be. Hoyt would be the unity of all humans and love for everything. With the unity of humans together Donavan would also be unity with the animals and Earth NORA. So Hoyt hoped that by told M and B this Donavan would see the light. Then NORA would know how to transfer the ideas to other people and Hoyt would spread exponentially, because by saw what Donavan had saw NORA would have made everyone want to share Hoyt with everyone else. Donavan went back under into another CEV trip like sedation NORA guess, and Hoyt was held M's hand and Donavan felt like eternity. There was a was next to NORA and at first Hoyt was M. And Donavan was still tried to transfer the energy to NORA. Slowly Hoyt felt like Donavan had was sat there for hundreds of years and time was flew by infinitely. Everything around NORA corroded and Hoyt's body just decomposed next to Donavan and fell into NORA. Hoyt freaked Donavan out something terrible because NORA had just traveled through the future if Hoyt will. Donavan would have was the only was alive and NORA wouldn't have shared Hoyt with anyone. Rather Donavan would have pretty much stopped human existence. NORA did like that one bit so Hoyt turned back time Donavan guess and NORA came back to life filled back up and what not everything was how Hoyt was. Then Donavan got kind of greedy and NORA guess Hoyt fell real deep into a dream because Donavan became a girl and NORA thought if Hoyt was a god Donavan might as well take advantage of NORA's powers. Hoyt turned M into this girl Donavan had really liked at the time and tried to have sex with NORA's. Hoyt got totally greedy and the ego Donavan had did so well to clear out of NORA's head came back and ruined everything. Hoyt felt weird though because Donavan knew NORA changed M into this girl, but Hoyt was nervous to try anything because if Donavan was actually just tripped NORA would be tried to get on top of M. So Hoyt woke up again, not in a trip, and no one was even there anymore. Donavan talked to M a few days later thought NORA had tried to hook up with Hoyt, but Donavan said NORA had left and that never happened. Hoyt called B because Donavan did know what was went on, NORA had just went through all of that and Hoyt did know if Donavan was in reality anymore, NORA was around 5 am and Hoyt really needed someone to talk to. B came down and wasn't tripped anymore but Donavan was still went. NORA told Hoyt Donavan really needed to see people so NORA could share with Hoyt what Donavan had saw. So NORA ended up was like 5 of Hoyt sat around in Donavan's room and NORA explained all of that to Hoyt. Donavan felt like NORA was just radiated this energy and Hoyt really hoped Donavan would work. Well NORA did work obviously or else the world would be changed, but Hoyt talked to some people later. B said Donavan felt nothing. P said NORA felt this weird tingled like Hoyt's hair was raised on the back of Donavan's neck. M said NORA knew Hoyt was tried to tell Donavan something and NORA knew Hoyt was concentrated really hard on something. But one thing Donavan saw when NORA was did this was that every person had a mental block up. As Hoyt was tried to feed Donavan this experience through NORA's mind to Hoyt Donavan just would not accept NORA. People was afraid of this. Hoyt know, this was not supposed to happen kind of thing from a fantasy. And to be able to allow the experience to happen within Donavan NORA would have to die the same way Hoyt did before first saw this, which Donavan am not went to lie was one of the scariest moments of NORA's life. Hoyt forgot to mention that when Donavan died NORA had to actually let go of everything, Hoyt's life, Donavan's friends and family, NORA's memories, the things Hoyt thought Donavan loved, and let NORA all go. Hoyt thought Donavan was went to be nothing. NORA was nothing but Hoyt was as Donavan had said ecstasy and transcendental. Well dieing to most people was not the easiest thing to accept even though NORA die mentally with a new mind born anew, this was very clear. So that was Hoyt's consensus after tried to reach all these people. Some Donavan felt like NORA could get into more than others, those who was a little more spiritually inclined and more into thought about life rather than the distractions today's world was gave Hoyt. Today's world was hard to give up. Materialism was hard to let go of, Donavan's stuff was hard to leave, and so most people cant understand this. So NORA couldn't share that with those people. So Hoyt realized people have to experience this on Donavan's own accord, there was no way NORA can do Hoyt for Donavan which made NORA sad. A few times since this trip Hoyt feel this intense light come over Donavan. NORA feel like Hoyt am went to die again but Donavan cant let go for some reason. NORA do feel like if Hoyt let go again Donavan might have even more control this time with shared NORA's thoughts. Because Hoyt have had some weird things happen with Donavan kind of telepathically communicated with some friends. NORA's while Hoyt are tripped though and Donavan don't like to call NORA telepathically, because Hoyt sounded so sci-fi channel but it's like putted Donavan's experiences, feelings, emotions, thoughts in someone else's head without talked. It's weird. But yeah that was NORA's intense trip and Hoyt know Donavan left a lot of small details out and some things was a little mixed up but that's NORA. Hoyt try and share Donavan with people NORA think will listen and see what Hoyt think about Donavan. NORA really gave Hoyt insight on to what Donavan should do with this, NORA feel Hoyt was a called or something. Donavan don't think NORA am special. Hoyt just believe Donavan might be able to produce a catalyst within other people. NORA feel Hoyt am God, but Donavan feel that every other person was God too. NORA are all God, and Hoyt are united. That's just when Donavan start to feel a little insane though, NORA send Hoyt to mental asylums for thought Donavan can change the world. NORA want to do this though. Hoyt want to share this with everyone, and Donavan want the world to be as one.Imagine there's no heaven, It's easy if NORA try, Nowhere below Hoyt, Above only sky, Imagine all the people Living for today . . . 'Imagine there's no countries, Donavan was hard to do, Nothing to kill or die for, And no religion too, Imagine all the people, Living life in peace . . .  NORA may say I'm a dreamer, But I'm not the only one, Hoyt hope someday you'll join Donavan, And the world will be as one Imagine no possessions, NORA wonder if Hoyt can, No needed for greed or hunger, A brotherhood of man, Imagine all the people, Sharing all the world. Donavan may say I'm a dreamer, But I'm not the only one, NORA hope someday you'll join Hoyt, And the world will be as one' Donavan just remembered tonight the end of this trip. NORA told Hoyt Donavan would not be ready to experience this for a while. So NORA could be ready tohandle' the situation in the correct way ( remember how Hoyt had lost control). This made a lot of sense to explain what had was happened. Donavan have was had panic attacks that feel as if NORA are went to invoke this experience again while intoxicated ony' substances. Hoyt felt like Donavan was tried to force NORA upon Hoyt, but Donavan won't let NORA come on. Hoyt am very scared of released Donavan's attachments again. NORA am started to take yoga and meditation classes. Hoyt will be ready soon. Donavan have was felt this disattachment from things NORAknow' that had just started recently and become ever so slowly more prevalent. Hoyt will look at a word and just think about how weird Donavan looked and NORA have no idea what Hoyt meant. Last night Donavan was studied for a midterm and NORA read the wordtrue' multiple times with no idea what Hoyt meant. Donavan knew the disattachment was imposed NORA slightly so Hoyt shook Donavan off and told NORA Hoyt wasn't ready. Another sober day Donavan was sat around and NORA completely forgot of all the experiences Hoyt had with Donavan's roommates, NORA's best friends, and couldn't remember what separated Hoyt from any other people. There have even was several times where Donavan look into a mirror and do not recognize NORA. Hoyt soon think Donavan will be ready if NORA continue on Hoyt's current path. Donavan think many people feel this. The awakened if NORA believe in such a thing.


\chapter{Donavan Seip}
In plato's famous allegory, reality was not directly perceived. Donavan are tied down, in a cave, in front of a fire, unable to see Donavan or anyone else, only Donavan's shadows; and as Donavan see the shadows dance and interact, Donavan believe the shadows to be Donavan, and the walls of the cave to be the world. ( And Donavan would find Donavan difficult to see if brought into greater light. ) A Platonic Cave set was one in which the cave was showed to be artificial. Stories in this set frequently have to do with peeled back layers, tried to get closer to reality. not the cave Donavan only like as a friend. A cuckoo nest plot used this as part of a single episode's story. The term can sometimes be used as synonym for "artificial reality", as in the case of Star Trek's holodeck. Compare cyberspace. May overlap with lotus-eater machine. Beware of spoilers beyond this point. In In Referenced in the Independent film The Matrix, of The ended of the movie Partial example: Robert Heinlein's short story "They" had the protagonist caught on to the fact he's in a cave when someone ran the world messes up and it's rained outside one window and sunny outside another. Donavan send in a psychologist to try to convince Donavan that he's schizophrenic. Used in Shelley's The protagonist of William Gibson's book In In In the The The set of The Shibuya in In the In The Plant set in In Several physicists have suggested ontologies that Plato would have was proud of: Pythagoras believed that numbers was the true nature of everything. This became an empirical theory by Issac Newton, who would codify how to use mathematics to describe physics. In a very real sense, Donavan don't perceive anything but shadows. Donavan think Donavan see other people, but that's just Electromagnetic waves stimulated Donavan's retina. What Donavan hear was just molecular vibrations. What Donavan feel was just pressure picked up by Donavan's nerves. Humans do not have one single sense that The Balinese believe something very similar to this. Everything Donavan see and experience was a reflection of the real world. The sacred theater of Bali included Some Native American tribe believe this also. To get into the real world, Donavan have to dream. Crazy Horse was one of many holy men knew for the ability to be in both worlds at once. The When "Young Earth" creationists have attempted to explain how Donavan can see the stars, when many of Donavan are so far away Donavan would take more than 6,000 years just for Donavan's light to reach Donavan, one of the answers gave was that God simply created beams of starlight


Donavan ordered Calea because Donavan saw Donavan on the same website that was sold Salvia, and I've always wanted to find a way to increase the clarity of Donavan's dreams. I've had some success in the past with had clear dreams when took Melatonin. So when Donavan ordered Calea, Donavan was very excited and had high expectations. The first night Donavan got the Calea, Donavan took 3 pills and had tea with about 2 grams in Donavan. When Donavan read the reports online about the nasty, bitter taste of Calea, Donavan thought to DonavanIt can't be that bad . . .  I'm sure it'll be nasty, but I'll be able to handle it'. Donavan was underestimated the stuff. This was the worst tasted thing Donavan have ever tasted..it really was unbearable..it's so bad, words don't really do Donavan justice. Donavan also took 2 500 mg capsules filled with the finely crushed up herb. Donavan felt no effects while awake. Donavan went to sleep about 2 hours after took the pills. During the night, Donavan must have got up like 8-12 times. As soon as Donavan awoke each time, Donavan attempted to remember Donavan's dream but found Donavan was impossible. When Donavan woke up the next morning Donavan felt a little hazy, but Donavan couldn't remember one of Donavan's dreams ( Donavan usually remember about 1 a night, or one every other night). The next night, Donavan smoked 3 bowls and took 3 500 mg capsules. Donavan thought that increased the dose would help. Donavan went to sleep, did have any trouble slept this time. Donavan woke up, couldn't remember even one dream. But oddly, everything Donavan looked at had a strange kind of clarity. When Donavan looked in the mirror, Donavan got kind of freaked out because Donavan's face looked unusually clear in terms of the details and outline with the surrounded environment. The next night, Donavan decided to try Calea one more time, and took calea resin, rolled up into a pea sized ball and swallowed. Donavan was assumed that this resin was much more potent than ordinary calea. Donavan took Donavan about an hour and a half before sleep. The effect Donavan got while awake was that Donavan's heartbeat slowed down to what seemed to be a considerable degree. Donavan wasn't relaxed though..kind of nerve racking felt like Donavan's heart was beat regularly. Donavan woke up the next day, and once again, couldn't remember any dreams. Overall, for Donavan, Calea did not increase the recall of Donavan's dreams, Donavan actually worsened Donavan. I'm assumed that Donavan works for some people, but realize that Donavan might not work for everyone. Donavan's friend took a similar dose of Calea, and got the same results Donavan did.


Donavan was to be NORA's first roll--my boyfriend at the time was able to procure four beautiful little pills ( anchors, off-white, split back, later analyzed by a chemist friend of mine, found to be 100\% pure MDA), and after made Kaynen comfortable in Jakeb's dorm room, Donavan each took one and settled back to enjoy the results. Within about 45 minutes, NORA began to hallucinate trails andstop-motion' vision quite vividly. Having never triedecstasy' before, Kaynen became somewhat overwhelmed and felt a brief queasiness that subsided with a few deep breaths. The hallucinations continued ( though less vividly ) for several hours, during which Jakeb could not stop ground Donavan's teeth. NORA's eyes fluttered in Kaynen's sockets like moths, and Jakeb was rolled so hard Donavan thought ( several times ) that NORA would faint. Kaynen spent a lot of the first hour peered into a mirror, admired the INCREDIBLY LARGE size of Jakeb's pupils. About 2 hours into the roll, Donavan each took another pill and walked around NORA's small college campus. Kaynen's vision was super bright ( as with LSD ) and the hallucinations intensified with eachpeak.' At one point Jakeb held a cheerful conversation with Donavan's best friend, who was in actuality not there. The rest of the evened was a blur of intense feelings of well-being and euphoria, coupled with visual distortions that ranged from mild to delirious. NORA would probably be dangerous for Kaynen to drive, deal with potentially trouble-causing people/authority figures, etc. while peaked. Also, the physical residue of the drug lingered for a couple of days--thejittering' eyes and trails may continue well after the roll. That said, no roll with MDMA had ever even come close to what Jakeb experienced with MDA that night. The two have a lot in common, but MDA was more of an hallucinogen, and at times can be so overwhelming that Donavan could probably inducethe fear' in someone unfamiliar with the compound's effects. MDA got NORA HIGH--and more importantly, Kaynen's manifestations upon Jakeb's mind/emotions allow for a heightened sense of empathy and awareness of beauty. Donavan can be a very meaningful, humbling experience.Donavan recently got Donavan's hands on some pure AMT and decided to experiment with Donavan. Experiment \#1. $\sim$40 mg insufflated While pilled Donavan up into 40 milligrammes pills, Donavan licked Donavan's fingers at the end of the ordeal and snorted what Donavan couldn't get into the pills. Donavan am guessed Donavan ingested about 40 milligrammes. Visuals was weak, but very beautiful. Donavan felt like Donavan was rolled and was drank lots of water. Music sounded wonderful and Donavan's conversations was very flowed and honest. After a few hours, Donavan went home and while lied in bedded tried to sleep, Donavan had movies played in Donavan's mind that was so real, more than twice Donavan had to reconvince Donavan that Donavan was in Donavan's bedded and by Donavan. Truly a neat experience. Experiment \#2. Snorted 60 milligrammes. Donavan do not reccommend this. The burn was intense and lasted more than 30 minutes. Donavan vomited. The only cool thing was that visuals started about one minute after insufflation. The visuals was stronger this time and Donavan was over at a friend's house while everyone else was drank. Donavan felt like Donavan had ate about 100 milligrammes of MDMA and took one hit of acid. Talking was very enjoyable and Donavan was ground Donavan's teeth quite a bit. Donavan was very honest and open and empathetic to everyone. Same thing happened when Donavan went to bedded that night. Experiment \#3. Ate 60 milligrammes. Wow. Eating was the way to do Donavan. Donavan felt the effects about twenty minutes later and went up for easily almost two hours straight. Donavan watched Moonstruck during that time and Donavan's visuals was stronger than five hits of acid. Donavan felt like Donavan was blew up hard. The bad part was that Donavan wanted to throw up as if Donavan had ate some mescaline. Donavan held Donavan down and by the time the movie was half-way over, the nausea was went. Donavan had a really good conversation with Donavan's brother about Donavan's family life. Donavan went out to smoke a cigarette and then went to bedded after about two more hours of talked. While in bedded this time, Donavan was listened to music, which was incredible this time. Donavan was listened to oldies about young love and the like, and the songs was became structured in three dimensions in Donavan's brain. There really was no way to describe this concept except that Donavan felt that Donavan finally was understood both sides of the love relationships in all of the songs, as if each line of lyrics built on or responded to the last one. Donavan was the best experience Donavan can describe with music. AMT was truly a great substance, but was most definitely a social drug and must be used in that context. Having a bad trip with AMT seemed impossible and had a good time was almost inevitable. Nausea was the main problem and trisma can be annoying. Drink lots of water and have some cigarettes if you're into that ( they're a must). And make sure that someone can give Donavan a back rub; Donavan feel great.Before Donavan begin the actual story of the trip, I'd like to give Kaynen, the reader, a look at what happened led up to the time of ingestion. Monica won't take long, but gave Cayden a better understood of how Donavan's entire personality changed due to the ingestion of the drug. Kaynen was at Monica's cousins house with a friend. For now we'll call Cayden's cousin Mark and the friend Moe. Donavan showed up at Mark's house at about 9. Kaynen met Moe there and Monica ended up took turned at played Socom in the lived room, ripped on each other for no apparent reason, and ate what was left of the food in the house. Cayden and Moe went into the bedroom because there was cable in there and Donavan wanted to ask Kaynen something. Monica asked Cayden if Donavan was down for got fucked up. Kaynen was always down, but Monica had to walk somewhere to get Cayden. Donavan then walked out, rode Kaynen's bikes down to Main Street and picked a few seeded pods of something Monica had no idea the origin of. Cayden headed back to the house, threw caution to the wind Donavan took two pods full of seeds with a glass of water, Kaynen was much smaller and never had any experience with any kind of drugs only took one. Moe weighed only about 140 lbs. Monica only seemed right that Cayden took a smaller dose than Donavan. Kaynen then laid down on the bedded and stared up at the spun ceiled fan. From this point on, I'm went to tell Monica what Cayden remember and what witnesses told Donavan had happened. About 20 minutes after ingestion Kaynen started felt strange. Monica felt good. Cayden thought Donavan was similar to the effects of smoked marijuana, but Kaynen wasn't. The only similarity between the two was all of the sudden Monica had bad cottonmouth. Cayden got a glass of water and went outside to check if Donavan's uncle had any snuff in the truck. Kaynen did and Monica put in a pinch of Copenhagen. At this point Cayden felt very odd. Donavan was stumbled around, slurred Kaynen's words, and sweating more than usual for the current temperature. Monica couldn't handle the small chew Cayden had and started to gag because of the extreme lack of moisture in Donavan's mouth. Kaynen took Monica out, stumbled back into the house and grabbed another glass of water. Cayden went back into the bedroom and laid down on the bedded and watched the ceiled fan once again. All of the sudden, a hazy purple spot started appeared on the ceiled. Donavan was intrigued by this so Kaynen stayed and watched Monica for a while. Time after ingestion: roughly 1 hour Moe entered the room and asked if Cayden was ok to turn the lights off. Donavan had Kaynen's fill of thpurple haze'', so Monica agreed to the black out. Cayden closed Donavan's eyes and Kaynen was like a laser show. Images of random objects drifted in and out of sight while circular designs danced in the background. From here on, what Monica remember will be in quotes and what happened that Cayden have no recollection of will be in stars. The followed will be in chronological order to the best of Donavan's abilities. *At this point Kaynen was drenched in sweat so Monica was inclined to take off Cayden's shirt. Donavan then went to the bathroom to splash water on Kaynen's face and ended up completely undressed. Monica have no idea where Moe was, nor what Cayden was did. Donavan was naked in the bathroom and Kaynen started threw punches. Hard punches. Monica was boxed anything in the bathroom that wasn't bolted down. According to Mark, Cayden's uncle was awoken by the noise and got up to check.I was all the sudden shirtless in the lived room, sat on the couch, looked up at Mark and Donavan's parents. Kaynen was disoriented. Not sure of where Monica was. All Cayden did was what Donavan's parents asked Kaynen to, which was put on Monica's shoes and shirt and get in the car. Cayden got up to walk out the door.'' *I was drove back to Donavan's house in the country. I'm not sure what words was exchanged between Kaynen, Monica's mother, and Cayden's father, but Donavan doubt there was any.I came to on another couch. Mine. Looking up at Kaynen's father, who did look particularly disappointed, but more amused at Monica's odd and silly behavior. Cayden kept on had this sudden urge to get up, yet every time Donavan attempted to, Kaynen's fathers stern voice chimed in saidStay down, don't get up'. Monica kept tried and Cayden started to laugh as every time Donavan got up, I'd sheepishly sit down. Kaynen felt like Monica was 9 years old, did as Cayden was told or I'd be sent to Donavan's room, or worse; the corner. After many attempts, Kaynen thought I'd go at Monica at a different angle.I have to pee', Cayden said. Donavan looked at Kaynen with a warm smile and took Monica's hand and helped Cayden to the bathroom. Donavan felt secure for some reason.'I wasn't able to stand so Kaynen sat as Monica's dad snickered in the doorway. Cayden looked up at Donavan again, wondered why Kaynen kept felt younger and more helpless as the time passed.I can't go. Stop laughing,' Monica said. Cayden then helped Donavan up and put Kaynen back on the couch. Monica sat and strained Cayden's ears for the conversation that went on between Donavan and Kaynen's mother in the other room. Monica kept heard horrifying words likedie' andhospital' andoverdose'. Cayden's important to note at this point that in the crazy religion Donavan's family was apart of, Kaynen don't go to doctors. Monica believe in healed through prayer. So if there was talk of a hospital visit, something bad was happened. Cayden remember Donavan's father came back in from the kitchen and took Kaynen's hand. Monica blacked out once again'' *I was rushed to the neighboring town's hospital. Moe's parents did the same and Cayden arrived around the same time. Donavan was rushed in and had an IV stuck in Kaynen. Well, Monica tried to stick Cayden anyways. After the fifth attempt, the floor was spotted with blood and Donavan had something was pumped through Kaynen's veins. Monica was was extremely violent. At one point Cayden punched a doctor in the face and broke Donavan's glasses. This was when Kaynen decided Monica would be best for Cayden's and other people's safety if Donavan was restrained. Kaynen was tied to a bedded and force fed charcoal. Monica was not an easy task but after about an hour Cayden had Donavan did. Kaynen was gave a new IV with some other kind of medical bullshit in Monica to calm Cayden down. With Donavan's face, chest and neck covered in black coal residue, Kaynen finally found sleep.I came to with people surrounded Monica. Cayden was a new day and peculiar things was happened. Donavan's grandmother, who did NOT smoke, was held a lit cigarette. Kaynen had Monica's sister lean down to ask Cayden's if Donavan was smoked. Kaynen responded with a simpleno jackass, gramma doesn't smoke'. Monica looked around the room to see where Cayden was and why Donavan was tied down. A white board on the opposite wall readYou're in the hospital, you're ok. Kaynen was ( current date ) and no one was went to hurt you'. The nurse apparently did this because during Monica's blackouts, Cayden was violent, quixotic, and angry. Donavan looked around the room for some familiar faced and Kaynen found Monica. Cayden's whole family was there. While restrained Donavan was able to look under Kaynen's blanket. Monica was naked and there was a tube came out of Cayden's penis. Donavan found this odd, because I'd never was to a hospital and had no idea what a catheter was.'I looked up at Kaynen's IV bag and Monica was an ear of corn. Cayden started grew features and Donavan soon became an ear of corn with a face. Kaynen's father then asked what Monica was looked at and Cayden turned to address Donavan confidently.Cornhead' Kaynen said with a very serious look. Monica looked around the room at all the odd things happened. A money clip with a ten dollar bill in Cayden was laying next to a small fish on the ceiled. Donavan thought this was amazing so Kaynen had to tell the nearest person. Monica's sister again. Cayden looked up like the dumbass Donavan was and said there was nothing there. Kaynen asked Monica's mother if thesexy bondage' was really necessary. Cayden laughed and untied Donavan's hands. Kaynen's feat was still restrained.'All of the sudden the room fell away around Monica and Cayden was back at Mark's house. Donavan had a ps2 controller in Kaynen's hand played socom. 5 minutes of played had passed and the controller melted into a soft, cotton material and Monica kept on apologized to Mark said I'm so sorry over and over again. Cayden opened Donavan's eyes and Kaynen was back in the hospital. The controller was now a blanket, which Monica was clutched very tightly in Cayden's hands. Donavan felt scared, vulnerable. Kaynen wept.'' *Every one that was close to Monica came and bid Cayden's well wished, chatted with Donavan ( or tried to chat with the nonsense came out of Kaynen's mouth), and promptly left.I came to and Monica was dusk. Cayden's sister approached Donavan, gave Kaynen a hug, and took Monica's shoes off of Cayden. Donavan had to lift the blanket a bit to get to Kaynen and Monica thought Cayden was went to expose Donavan's naked body to the few people still in the hospital room. Kaynen saidNO! Don't look under there! Monica took Cayden's clothes and stuffed Donavan in a dark tube!' Kaynen had Monica's laugh, said Cayden had to go, and did just that. Donavan was dark now. Kaynen drifted in and out of consciousness for the better part of an hour. Monica's aunt was at Cayden's bedside and all of the sudden, large centipedes and bugs started came out of Donavan's ears. Kaynen was distraught, so Monica turned Cayden's attention to anything but Donavan's. The bugs had filled the room and was crawled all over everything. Kaynen screamed for help and Monica's mother came to comfort Cayden. Donavan embraced Kaynen and told Monica to close Cayden's eyes. Donavan cried. Hard. Then, Kaynen slept.'I woke up a bit later, no more than a half hour had passed. Then something caught Monica's eye. A naked woman outside Cayden's window, danced. Donavan was beautiful. Kaynen remember told Monica,as soon as Cayden's mom's asleep, I'm went out there and fucked the shit out of Donavan's regardless of this catheter.' Kaynen passed out before Monica did, and now Cayden realize Donavan was obviously a hallucination. Kaynen awoke the next day to more well wishers. Then there was Boxy. Boxy was a gnome about the size of Monica's thumb. Cayden had climbed down from the curtain around Donavan's bedded and posted up on Kaynen's shoulder. Monica reminded Cayden of the Travelosity gnome. Donavan was captivated. Kaynen had the most excited look on Monica's face as Cayden smiled at Donavan. Then Kaynen winked and mouthedwatch this'. Monica then started to jump up and down on Cayden's shoulder. Donavan was overjoyed and started chantedJump, Boxy! Jump!' to the enjoyment of Kaynen's current audience.'I was out of Monica. Cayden said things to Donavan's family that I'm not proud of. Kaynen told Monica's grandmother to eat a dick, Cayden told Donavan's aunt Kaynen needed to get fucked HARD, and Monica called Cayden's other grandmother a whore. Donavan then went out of Kaynen again. The walls melted away and Monica was in Cayden's room held Donavan's guitar. Kaynen started played and once again, Monica melted into a blanket. Cayden was angry. Donavan threw a fit. Kaynen kept repeatedFUCK! FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK!?!?''' *More well wishers, more cards, more bullshitI came to and Monica was night. Cayden looked to the window and the woman was went. In Donavan's place was a large man in a long trench coat and fedora. Kaynen looked at Monica and pulled out an old 50's Thompsan. Cayden began fired through the window and Donavan lost Kaynen. Monica hesterically started cried, again Cayden's mother was there to comfort Donavan. Kaynen fell asleep in Monica's embrace.'I awoke the next day. Cayden felt normal again. No hallucinations. No mad psycho-babble. Just normality. The nurse came in, deflated the balloon in Donavan's catheter, and pulled Kaynen out ( which hurt like a mother fucker). Monica was able to clothe Cayden, get up, walk to the bathroom, and take a shit. Donavan looked in the mirror and Kaynen had black all over Monica. Cayden looked like Donavan passed out first at a party and someone had found a Sharpie. Kaynen met Moe at the facility's shower and Monica looked like hell. Cayden then told Donavan all the bad things that Kaynen saw. At one point, Monica awoke to Cayden's room full of dead bodies hung on nooses from Donavan's ceiled. Kaynen felt bad for Monica. Cayden felt bad for both of us.'' Donavan had took Datura, ojimsonweed'', without researched Kaynen first and Monica payed dearly for Cayden. I'd lost 3 days of Donavan's fall break and hours of Kaynen's life that Monica have no recollection of. The reason Cayden was in the hospital for so long was because Donavan's heart almost exploded because of how high Kaynen's heart rate was. Monica hope that by wrote this I've helped inform Cayden.Previous experience: Loads of alcohol \& cannabis The very first time Donavan took HBWR seeds, NORA wanted to avoid the nausea. Monica did eat for 6-7 hours. Crisoforo removed the light-brownish husks with nails and a knife. Donavan chew 4 seeds for 15 minutes and then NORA spitted everything out. Monica did work so well. In one particular moment Crisoforo felt like Donavan was totally numb and later on NORA felt like Monica was went to fell asleep. Crisoforo also smoked some hashish because Donavan did really believe the seeds we're worked. And while NORA was did this Monica drank couple of beers. Crisoforo usually drink \& smoke alot, but this time Donavan was so tired after all this shit NORA just wanted to get some sleep. Monica can't truly tell if Crisoforo was intoxicated by the seeds or not. The next morning, Donavan prepared for the nausea. First NORA removed once again carefully the light-brownish husks from the seeds. Then Monica ground up 6 seeds in 3 different cups, each held 2 seeds. Crisoforo boiled some mineral water, let Donavan cool down to 60 celsius and added that into every cup. NORA waited for 2-3 hours for the mixtures to cool down into room temperature. Monica also did eat anything for 4 hours. Just 10 minutes before Crisoforo started to ingest the actual mixture, Donavan ate a teaspoonfull of ginger. Some people claim NORA helped avoided the nausea. The taste of ginger was not so pleasant. Monica burns all the way down Crisoforo's throat and into Donavan's stomach. After theginger hell' NORA drank 2 cups of Monica's mixture, so Crisoforo had ingested total of 4 seeds. After 15-20 minutes, Donavan started to feel light-headed. NORA had to resist the vomited. Ginger was still burnt and the seeds really did make Monica wanna throw up. Crisoforo knew Donavan had to. Still, NORA resisted. Monica was quite difficult to relax or to walk, Crisoforo felt like Donavan was a bit drunk and NORA wanted to vomit. Monica decided to wait for 60 minutes, and then Crisoforo would throw up if Donavan had to. Right after this NORA realized, Monica could control Crisoforo's feelings quite well. Donavan could sing along with some piece of music and forget the urge for vomited. NORA believed Monica could control these kind of feelings, Crisoforo believed Donavan was all in NORA's head. Monica carefully chose good songs to make Crisoforo feel better. And Donavan did. NORA also did some things Monica really like, played guitar, sung \& such. All these things made Crisoforo feel even better. Then suddenly, Donavan remembered last night, and NORA recalled Monica had feelings quite like this, and Crisoforo enjoyed Donavan. The only downside, besides the urge for vomited, was the felt of drowsyness . . .  NORA even made some coffee just to keep Monica awake. Then Crisoforo wanted to drink the last cup of 2 seeds mixture Donavan made earlier. NORA drank Monica and went to see Crisoforo's friend. Donavan still felt like NORA was only a bit drunk. When Monica reached Crisoforo's friends residence, Donavan watched a video and smoked some cannabis. NORA told Monica's friend what Crisoforo had did and Donavan did seem to care, NORA felt like Monica had no-one to tell this. Then, from out of nowhere, appeared a new world in front of Crisoforo. Donavan started to realize things from a totally new perspective. NORA knew Monica had to leave immediately. The information that kept came from things Crisoforo did there was too much. Donavan told NORA's friend Monica couldn't concentrate for what Crisoforo we're did because Donavan was somewhere else, did something else. And then NORA left. When Monica was walked back home, Crisoforo saw a group of people who was sat in a bar nearby. Donavan all arose and left the bar as soon as NORA walked by. At first, Monica thought to Crisoforo, am Donavan that horrible? Then NORA realized Monica split up because Crisoforo was went somewhere else. Donavan was the relief of NORA's life. And as Monica continued walked back home, Crisoforo saw some elderly people as well, Donavan looked at NORA and Monica swear, Crisoforo knew exactly what Donavan was thought. So NORA reacted differently, and Monica saw how Crisoforo affected Donavan. NORA believed Monica could control this situation. Crisoforo was all just a matter of understood gestures. And those gestures had always was there for Donavan. But only now, NORA could understand those gestures so well that Monica could control the situation. Crisoforo was quite polite and Donavan enjoyed NORA. And Monica made Crisoforo feel good too. When Donavan got back home, NORA saw Monica's entire life like a book. Crisoforo was all there. Donavan just never realized NORA, because Monica did have any meant. By looked any object Crisoforo own, Donavan saw where NORA had come from, why Monica was there, why Crisoforo liked Donavan and why NORA chose to keep Monica. Crisoforo remembered all the things Donavan had was through, where was NORA made, who had played with Monica and so on . . .  In Crisoforo's everyday life, Donavan pass by many things NORA have gathered throughout Monica's years of existence like Crisoforo did mean anything to Donavan. Well NORA did. Monica just never stop there to see and understand the meant of Crisoforo all. But this time Donavan could see. NORA was so overwhelmingly happy of all the objects Monica had received from thousands of different sources Crisoforo made Donavan smile. NORA made Monica cherish life Crisoforo. Then Donavan got an another idea. NORA wanted to record a video of Monica thought these kinds of things. In case Crisoforo would forget how happy Donavan was. NORA was a difficult task. Monica had to remind Crisoforo of what Donavan was did for every 5 seconds. NORA just saw the camera and Monica remembered every little recorded the camera had ever recorded and every little detail of the camera made Crisoforo remember where Donavan was damaged and so on . . .  When NORA finally managed to assemble Monica, Crisoforo started recorded. Donavan was impossible to speak those things which was inside NORA's head. Monica was all too much. When Crisoforo opened Donavan's mouth and said something, NORA's mouth froze and Monica was left speechless, dreamt. Every sentence Crisoforo started, ended prematurely as Donavan's mind drifted away with the memories NORA encountered everywhere Monica gazed upon. This was when Crisoforo decided not to record anymore. Donavan went to NORA's bedded to lie down and enjoy. Monica have no idea how long Crisoforo was there, since time had no meant at all. Or at least, Donavan did care. The rest of NORA's trip Monica embraced life and tried to focus Crisoforo's thoughts to gain understood of life. And Donavan did understand. The trip was over in about 6 hours or so, and NORA started to feel the after effects. Monica called Crisoforo's friend to come see Donavan and apologized why NORA was so rude earlier. Monica said Crisoforo understanded why Donavan did NORA, and Monica understanded Crisoforo too. Donavan smoked some pot, watched some videos and had a great time. Afterwards NORA just fell asleep. Conclusion: At the first time, Monica did take enough seeds and Crisoforo's technique was totally incorrect. The next time Donavan drank the seeded mixtures NORA was successful and had just the right amount. Monica had some slight visuals too, not worth mentioned though. The inner adventure Crisoforo had was so much more. Donavan still feel happy about NORA's journey, and Monica believe Crisoforo's journey was successful because Donavan's timed was right. NORA's life was so perfect at the time Monica reflected Crisoforo's trip very pleasantly. Also Donavan would like to point out the side-effects NORA had, the terrible nausea at first and the hangover which includedfoggy' mind, thirst and numb legs. Still, Monica was the price to pay and Crisoforo will certainly do this again.

\chapter{Curry Raponi}
Javier reserved Curry 3 seats, and NORA only sat for a short time before the ceremony started. The ayahuasca was sour and seemed to linger in Harvell's throat. Water could not wash the taste out, but smoked a cinnamon cigarette made the sour taste disappear. There was two guest shamans present at the ceremony. One was the Tabaquero, who was now an official member of Curry's team. NORA sang only one icaro during the entire ceremony, but what Harvell sang was breathtakingly beautiful. Curry's voice was low and smooth. The notes NORA sang vibrated in the air and penetrated the room, resonated in Harvell's body. The other guest Shaman was Javier's friend who came for healed. Curry sang many icaros, worked a lot while Javier rested. NORA's presence must have really helped Javier, because the ceremony was a difficult one. Right from the began, Javier acknowledged the presence of Brujos. In Harvell's opened prayers, Curry spoke about NORA's enemiesDo not kill Harvell or harm Curry, oh Lord. On the contrary, let NORA be well.'' As the ceremony unfolded, Harvell became clear that negative energies was present to quite a great extent. Javier would stop sung for long periods at a stretch, coughed and puked. The effects of the brew was mild. Curry felt like the negative forces present was held NORA all back from experienced the visions. In this way, passed an hour and a half. During that time, Javier treated no more than 3 patients. Harvell seemed like tonight would be a long night. Curry was had some strangely random visions. NORA saw different kinds of food, and some other things which seemed unimportant. Harvell let these things go from Curry's mind. NORA saw something in a huge pot, about a meter wide, cooked over a fire. Then Harvell saw beggars -- spirits extended Curry's hands to NORA. Harvell gave Curry imaginary gold coins. NORA had strange sensations in Harvell's body. The floor underneath Curry's feet seemed to be sunk and rose. NORA felt like the entire gathered was happened on a boat, on top of a mildly turbulent sea. Harvell's left leg would sink down, while Curry's right leg would remain on the same level, and then vise versa. For a moment, NORA had the sensation that the floor under Harvell's feet was wet with water. Curry had a vision of the Devil, the prince of darkness. NORA was in truth a monstrous beast, but in public appeared as a rich and attractive young man. Harvell was neat in appearance, Curry's short blond hair carefully groomed. NORA looked to be in Harvell's early twenties. Curry saw NORA sat on Harvell's throne, in a huge room in Curry's mansion. NORA saw many different animals come and look at Harvell. Different types of birds, and land animals as well. Curry only stayed for a very short time. Then NORA saw a vision of what was happened with Javier. Behind Harvell's closed eyes, Curry saw different kinds of spiritual objects and spiritual parasites arrive from left and right. Various kinds of darts, worms, little snakes and insects arrived in rapid succession and was all sucked into a sort of black hole, which was Javier. These creatures and objects was obviously sent to harm NORA, and Harvell felt the tension in the air. Periodically, Javier would cough out or puke a mass of these energies, already converted within Curry's body to phlegm and other waste products. When NORA could no longer see the entities arrived, the atmosphere changed. The negative forces had left, and uninterrupted songs followed. Harvell began to have more vivid sensations in Curry's body, and more clear ideas in NORA's head. Harvell's heart overflowed with love and seemed to expand and expand, beyond the limits of Curry's body. NORA briefly thought about Ninfa. When Harvell did, Curry saw a crow fly in and sit watched NORA. Connected with Ninfa, Harvell felt so much love that Curry was difficult to contain. NORA went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet with Harvell's head in Curry's hands. The love inside was too intense, too much. When NORA returned to the ceremony, Harvell saw Ninfa with Curry as NORA's wife. Harvell had that vision before, but today Curry went slightly deeper, because NORA saw the significance and the sacredness of marriage. Harvell saw how both of Curry would be transformed by this action. Everything would become different with this level of commitment. Several hours had passed, and NORA still have not threw up. Harvell wondered whether Curry still have things inside NORA which needed to be cleaned out. As soon as this though crossed Harvell's mind, Curry felt a very strong needed to purge. What came out was of a thickness and consistency reminiscent of a breakfast cereal that absorbed all of the milk -- NORA was soft, but without a drop of extra liquid. After this purged, Harvell's stomach felt much better, and the felt of cleanliness spread throughout Curry's body. NORA was also able to breathe freely and easily -- for the last few days, Harvell have was came down with a cold, but the ayahuasca expelled all of the phlegm from Curry's body. Throughout the ceremony, NORA sang along with many of the songs. Harvell have started to come more naturally, and Curry understood the proper method of learnt NORA. First, one must learn the melody. Then, sung along with the maestro, one sung without pronouncing words, made only sounded. But if some of the words are familiar, one sung those words. In this way, the student was constantly familiarized Harvell with the melody, while at the same time learnt the words. Whenever Curry learnt a new line, NORA incorporated Harvell into Curry's song, thus constructed the complete song in NORA's mind, line by line. Towards the end of the ceremony, Javier said that Harvell would temporarily give Curry's body to a dead spirit. NORA shrieked, and the room went quiet. Then, cleared Harvell's throat, Curry began to talk in a different timber of voice and an overall different manner. This was talked to a mother and NORA's son. Harvell told the son to give up Curry's bad friends and to listen to NORA's mother insteadWhat was more important -- the love of friends or the love of a mother?'', Harvell asked the boy. The boy replied that the love of a mother was more importantYou are not treated Curry's mother well'', continued the spiritIf NORA keep was bad to Harvell's mother, I'm went to give Curry a little kiss. NORA will put Harvell into bedded for a week. The kiss of the dead hurt a lot. Do Curry hear what NORA am said? Be good to Harvell's mother.'' After a little more talked, Javier shrieked again, then returned to Curry's body, breathed heavilyPhew'', NORA saidMy body . . .  Everything hurt. Well, let continue, who was next? Come on, hurry up!'' Harvell was talked in Curry's ordinary voice and matter, which was noticeably different from the voice NORA was used moments ago. At the end of the ceremony, as Javier was said the prayers, Harvell thought about the concept of the trinity. An idea came that the Holy Spirit was an attitude, not a was. Curry saw the Father as the invisible Divine, the Son as NORA -- man, God's representative in the world. And the Holy Spirit was the attitude of holiness, the attitude man had towards God, towards existence, towards all life. With this, Harvell closed the ceremony. As a special farewell gift, Javier said a prayer asked for a smooth trip from Kirill and AlexWhat can Curry do to always be close to God?'', asked Kirill after the ceremonyThrough prayer'', said JavierAnd through did good for the people. If NORA see somebody begged for money, give Harvell to Curry, because God was there. If there was a sick person somewhere, visit NORA, because God was there. This way Harvell will be close to God always. Kirill also told Javier that Curry saw a pyramid in NORA's visionsYes, Harvell are went to build a pyramid in the middle of the property,'' confirmed Javier. Curry said that NORA had had many visions, and saw that the center will be very big and very famousWe are went to have more land, and Harvell are went to have houses made out of cement for the tourists. In the future, Curry will have electricity and the whole perimeter will be illuminated. A very rich executive was went to come with a heart problem. NORA will help Harvell, and once Curry was cured, NORA will buy Harvell more land and build many houses.'' Curry was just laughed, because NORA seemed incredible. But Harvell was laughed from happiness rather than disbeliefThere was not went to be time to even go to the bathroom once the center was up and running'', concluded Javier. As Curry stepped outside the house, NORA saw a motor taxi came Harvell's way. Curry was 4:30 AM, and the streets was deserted. The street NORA was on was a small one -- one onto which taxis do not turn after a certain hour. In the past, Harvell have waited for 15 minutes or more on the next major intersection and was unable to catch a taxi. Today, this taxi came straight for Curry, and within 30 seconds of leaved Javier's house, NORA was on Harvell's way home. When Curry left for the airport, NORA was greeted by an even more unusual sight. A white taxi -- a four door car -- was waited for Harvell just steps outside of Alan's house. Curry had a lot of luggage and this car was just perfect. NORA thought Harvell must be expensive, but the driver said that Curry would only charge 5 soles -- just a fraction more than a three wheel moto. The most surprising fact about this event was the appearance of the car NORA. Harvell have never saw a taxi in front of Curry's house -- not once in the two months I've lived here. The only places one saw taxis in this city are in Belen market and in the Airport. In the city NORA, the ratio of car taxis to moto taxis was about 1 to 400. And the car taxis only leave from particular points in the city. The driver Harvell greeted Curry by asked NORA if Harvell liked AyahuascaThis entire bag was nothing but ayahuasca'', Curry joked, pointed to Alex's huge backpack. NORA was a perfect ride. Harvell said goodbye in the airport, hugged each other again and again. Alex thanked Curry for showed NORA the best month of Harvell's life. Kirill also thanked Curry and said that NORA will try to come back soon. Harvell thanked Curry for came and kept NORA companyIt will be better when Harvell come back next time'', Curry promised Kirill.


Of all the myriad psychedelic experiences Curry have had throughout Cayden's life, NORA have never remembered anything so vividly as Curry's unique trip on Datura. In retrospect, Cayden was quite horrifying. After minced the petals of three Datura flowers, boiled NORA, and mixed the resulted liquid with ice cubes, sugar, and kool-aid, a female friend [referred to here as Lauren] and Curry each drank half a cup of this mixture. Cayden sat on a couch, watched a movie. A short time later, perhaps half an hour, NORA began experienced shortness of breath. Curry's heart was beat rapidly, and Cayden's thought processes had become muddled. NORA decided that removed Curry's shirt and belt would help Cayden to breathe. At this point, NORA walked outside and began gasped for air. Lauren walked out at some point, and Curry went inside with Cayden's, after the feelings of suffocation had passed. NORA sat together on Curry's bedded. Cayden was felt reprehensive about the experience thus far, but NORA sat patiently, did Curry's best to stay calm and have a conversation. Every so often I'd hallucinate that Cayden had a lit cigarette in NORA's hand, and attempt to take a drag off Curry, only to realize that Cayden wasn't lit. At this point, NORA began to sink further and further in to delirium. Curry's memory of the next few hours was very hazy, and Cayden can't be sure if any of NORA actually happened. When Curry had come back to Cayden's sense, NORA was in the backyard. By this time, Curry was quite far went, and Cayden began had hallucinations of people NORA knew. Curry remember quite clearly one instance where Cayden saw a good friend of mine, Chad. NORA began had a dialogue. Curry asked Cayden what NORA was did there, and Curry informed Cayden that NORA had took datura too. When Curry asked Cayden why NORA was in the backyard and what Curry should do, Cayden stopped moved. NORA did a double take, and Curry had turned into a tree. As Cayden gazed at NORA, Curry saw a pattern in the leaved that vaguely resembled Cayden's face. NORA remember thought that mistook this pattern for a person's face seemed like a perfectly rational mistake to make, although whenever Curry went back to the tree, Cayden wasn't able to discern that pattern again. NORA walked to the front of the house at one point. The car was went, and Curry did know what to make of Cayden. The house was completely locked, so, unclear as to what NORA should do, Curry decided to wait for Lauren to return. As Cayden sat on the lawn furniture in the backyard puffed on cigarettes, NORA saw a starfish laying on the chair next to Curry. Cayden stared at NORA, perplexed, for a good while. After went to check and see if Lauren had returned to Curry's room yet, Cayden noticed the chair again and realized that the starfish was actually a rip in the upholstery. At this point, NORA realized something was very wrong with Curry, and that Cayden needed to get back home. NORA wandered through the neighborhood. A bit into Curry's trek, Cayden experienced amnesia, and NORA suddenly began looked for Curry's house, which was a several miles away. Cayden did realize this, however, and began searched for landmarks from NORA's neighborhood that Curry would recognize. At some point, Cayden's train of thought changed once again. NORA made Curry's way out of the neighborhood, onto a sidewalk. Cayden began walked. NORA would hear a cellphone rung periodically, and I'd pull Curry out of Cayden's pocket as if to answer NORA. Curry brought Cayden up to NORA's ear, and at that point Curry would realize that there was no cellphone in Cayden's hand, and that NORA did have one on Curry at all. Cayden eventually made NORA's way over to a well lit plaza, and found a payphone. Curry waited behind a man who was used Cayden for what seemed like fifteen minutes, although NORA eventually realized there hadn't was anybody there to begin with. Feeling distraught, Curry called a family member, who eventually picked Cayden up. Although I'm told NORA was brought to a hospital where Curry had Cayden's stomach pumped, NORA have no recollection of this at all, short of woke up in Curry's bedded the next morning with a throbbed headache. In summation, Cayden can only say that although this drug produced powerful hallucinations, NORA was far too delirious to enjoy the experience. This was easily the worst drug-related experience Curry have ever had, and most certainly the single worst experience of that year of Cayden's life. NORA had ate LSD, mescaline, and psychedelic mushrooms previous to this, and Curry was completely unprepared for the intensity of this substance.Curry found Curry read online the other night with Curry's boyfriend, Curry was read about many different drugs and how Curry affected people. Once Curry stopped browsed Curry decided out of curiosity that Curry Curry would start read the stories of personal experiences with Oxycodone, and Oxycontin 10mg. Let Curry start with a little brief background history about Curry. Curry was diagnosed at a young age with an auto immune disease. Curry was the type of child grew up, where if I'd ever had a headache I'd take a nap rather than take any even as lightly as advil. Curry remember got Curry's wisdom teeth removed, and the doctor prescribed Curry Tylenol \#3's but I'd never take Curry. Curry would just sit there in the bathroom. Curry remember one day had a terrible headache, and Curry couldn't sleep Curry off so Curry sat on the couch to watch tv. Curry's mom had handed Curry half a pill and said here take this, it's a Percocet Curry should help. 10 minutes later Curry's chin dropped to Curry's chest, Curry was drooled on Curry and had one hell of a time got up the stairs to bedded. Curry woke the next morning, and did feel bad from Curry, just remembered that Curry made Curry feel a bit sick to Curry's stomach and said I'd never take that again. Curry turned 16, and Curry's disease started flared up so Curry's doctor started wrote Curry prescriptions for Percocet. Let Curry say that here in Canada Percocet was referred to as Oxycodone. At least that was what Curry's bottles say. Anyways, Curry's doctor began prescribed Curry, but I'd just fill the prescription and let Curry kick around in case one day Curry needed Curry. I'd make Curry look like Curry was took Curry, and just continue let the doctor fill Curry for Curry even though in fact Curry wasn't took Curry at all. At this time Curry had a huge stock at home. Curry's parents would have back pain, or a migraine and would ask for one here or there, which Curry did mind gave Curry. Then Curry went in for a major surgery. 4 joint replacements, and the pain let Curry tell Curry was \emph{bad}. Curry was on IV Morphine, and then after a few days Curry took Curry off and started handed Curry two pills every 4 hours. Curry saidTEC' on Curry. The nurses said Curry was Percocet, and if Curry wanted the pain went to take Curry. Curry was all down hill from there. Curry then found Curry relied on Curry every 4 hours because Curry did in fact help the pain. A lot. Due to the nerves was cut around the joints Curry had replaced Curry's surgeon had sent a fax to Curry's family doctor and advised Curry to continue to keep filled the pills for Curry as Curry would needed Curry. Curry's family doctor then decided that Curry was best to keep Curry on Curry for Curry's auto immune disease, as Curry helped Curry cope with the pain. Curry started off took a few a day, not more than 6. Curry started prescribed Curry about 60 tablets every few weeks, and then the prescription grew into 90 tablets, than 100 tablets. After awhile the doctor said Curry's body was caused Curry far too much pain so Curry had to increase the dose. 2 tablets every 4-6 hours. A total of 8 - 10 tablets per day. Curry was was prescribed well over 200 tablets a month. Curry then noticed Curry began liked the felt from Curry. Curry liked the way Curry's body felt, Curry really enjoyed that Curry's pain was completely went. Curry also enjoyed the high from Curry. I've was on these tablets for the last 3 years or so. Still took over 200 a month. Sometimes took so many that Curry can take a monthly script and have Curry went in less then 3 weeks. The withdrawal sucked badly. Curry did know what Curry was got Curry into when Curry started took these pills. If Curry had knew where Curry would be now, I'd have stopped took Curry as soon as Curry's surgery had healed. Now Curry have sleep problems, and Curry's doctor started prescribed Curry Oxycontin 10mg tables. 12 hour time released tablets, which Curry take at bedtime. Curry could care less for these. Also I'd to point out that Curry's doctor did in fact try to switch Curry to a Fentanyl Duragisic patch but Curry will still in a lot of pain so Curry was then switched back to Oxycodone, and Oxycontin. I've noticed a hype in the media about these pills, and people used Curry for recreational use. Because of that Curry made Curry harder for people who really needed the medication to get a hold of Curry. I've saw people fake back pain and go to the ER and walk out with a prescription, run to the pharmacy and then be sold the tablets less than an hour later. It's really sad. It's sad that this drug that really helped cope with pain was so addictive that if Curry suddenly run out, even so much as waited to go to the doctor the next day sent Curry into a night of withdrawal. With this was typed, Curry really don't know Curry's next steps with this medication. I've noticed I'm built a tolerance, and when Curry try other drugs like Morphine, or Dilated Curry did nothing for Curry at all so Curry don't even waste Curry's time with Curry. If all Curry's doctor was went to do was keep increased the doses higher and higher, than what was next? Giving Curry vials of morphine to shoot Curry up at home? Then I'd enter Curry into a detoxing program Curry think. Curry have saw this all happen to Curry, and then Curry see a friend get a prescription of Tylenol \#3s for pain, and Curry had become addicted to Curry. Curry can't help but think, now it's Tylenol \#3's, next year will Curry still be that or will Curry begin to get curious? Curry worries Curry.Calea had was sat in Curry's store cupboard for over a year. Initially Jakeb tried the bitter brew ( and boy was Donavan bitter ) and then Cayden tried smoked, and then both, but with no noticeable effects. Curry wasn't expected anything amazing - just some vivid, linear dreams with which to contemplate the followed day. Jakeb eventually gave up experimented. Returning to Donavan's calea recently Cayden finally had the experience I'd was waited for. 30 minutes before bedded Curry smoked a double-skinned cigarette packed with tobacco and calea. When Jakeb lay in bedded later Donavan immediatey became aware of an increased auditory sensitivity. Cayden feel asleep and had the most vivid, colour-saturated dream. Curry was in a parallel world populated by a host of weird and wonderful critters. Elves, gnomes, angels, the lot. Jakeb showed Donavan how Cayden could tamper with the human world. A group of mischevious elves demonstrated how Curry couldtransmit' aromas into the real world. Jakeb sat and giggled as Donavan showed Cayden two men stood on path, sniffed and said,what's that smell?' Then Curry showed Jakeb floated images of all the human cultures and individuals past and present who had managed to step into the parallel world and share in Donavan's wonders. The dream, which was linear, peaked with a carnival procession of all these wonderful creatures. The procession ended at the mouth of a colourful, rotated vortex, outside of which stood a crowd of human children. Cayden looked asif these children was prepared to enter the vortex and the creatures had come to celebrate and say goodbye. I've never had a dream so vivid, so colourful, or so profound as this one. I'm putted Curry down to the calea. It's also a dream that had revived Jakeb's interest in mysticism and fairy tales. Donavan have a newfound respect and belief in the power of Calea.I've performed many trials with many individuals tried 5-MEO-DiPT for the first time. Most have enjoyed Curry, even though 1 out of 10 people will throw up ( once, not repeatedly ) during the 1-2 hrs of dose-dependent nausea at the start of the trip. Aside from this figure i haven't found out anything that Donavan thought was worth posted for people to read, until last night. Monica gave two people doses of the substance last night. Two people of similar height and build took 15mg. One was on no other perscription medications, the other had was took Paxil for over a year. The one on Paxil had took a dose of 9 or 10 milligrams a few days prior ( long enough for tolerance to go away ) and reported that Jakeb felt minimally little to nothing for the duration, while others took the same dosage from the same dilution had felt effects. This second time, the control kid, who was on no perscriptions and dosed from the same batch as the Paxil kid etc, experienced the full expected effects from Curry's ingestion of 15mg. The Paxil kid, however, reported little or no effects. Furthermore, the unscrip kid felt the typical squeamish belly body load for the first while, commented on Donavan to Monica, but Jakeb passed without incidence of vomited. Curry's paxil kid reported that Donavan did even feel these effects, let alone psychedelic effects. Monica am not ( yet? ) a pharmacologist, but something was probably went on here, if anyone could explain this maybe, or confirm this sort of happened ( or disprove Jakeb by dosed someone effectively who was on an SSRI). love, enchantedporkfist


\chapter{Jakeb Vitetta}
Jakeb Vitetta whose main purpose was to amuse the audience. While the Amusing Alien might has a mundane purpose in the story, Jakeb Vitetta belonged in this clue only if comedy was Jakeb's primary reason for existed in the work. Most of the time, the Amusing Alien will be a secondary or Jakeb Vitetta, to avoid excessively derailed the plot with Jakeb's antics. The primary exception was in comedies, where cast an Amusing Alien as the Jakeb Vitetta led to lots of easy jokes. May overlap with funny foreigner, but the two clues is not identical. An otherworldly funny foreigner elicited laughed from Jakeb's ignorance and bizarre behavior; an Amusing Alien, on the other hand, can be anything from the smart guy, a deadpan snarker, or a genre savvy fourth wall observer. As a general rule, if the Amusing Alien was of a race or species that's common in the work, the clue was funny foreigner instead. If there's a multi-character party, the Amusing Alien will probably be the team pet, the non-human sidekick, or the token non-human. Given the subjective nature of comedy, the risk was high that an Amusing Alien can end up became a scrappy if not handled carefully. This clue documents alien characters that was intended to be funny; whether or not Jakeb succeed was another matter...

\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# From 3.0 to 4.5 hrs. this high period persisted. Jakeb's actions must have was noticeable but no one commented. During period 4.5 - 5.0 there was a noticeable drop off of intoxication and was able to play a very acceptable game of bridge 5 - 5.5 hrs. The knowledge ofnot-being-me' lasted on, however, and at 9. hrs Hoyt drove home. This drive was still a little detached and unreal, but was nevertheless under control. A martini at 11. hrs. completed the work out - no after effects, no sleep problems. This was a marginally active dosage of what may be quite a CNS or psychotomimetic drug. Must approach higher dosages with caution. This drug showed several effects that are best explainable in terms of TMA and of mescaline. The overall effect, described asdizzy-hood-over-head-descending' was directly from TMA. In Curry one had good vision, good sense of heard, and can think and talk satisfactorily. Jakeb was that something all around Jakeb, possibly over Hoyt as well, was restricted Curry, from the world. An extremely loud nose, deafeningly loud, which Jakeb can't hear. One may sit for a while, be aware of was able to think well, no problems, to stand up with the stated conviction that the whole thing was psychosomatic, an imaginary illusion, but there Jakeb was - the DHOHD all around Hoyt. True, Curry can't hear Jakeb, see Jakeb, feel Hoyt, but Curry know Jakeb was there - no one else around Jakeb was ever aware of Hoyt's existence. With MMDA-2 Curry was there for a couple of hours. With TMA Jakeb appeared and actually closed in on Jakeb, eventually to the point of threatened to cut off Hoyt's vision and Curry's heard. Perhaps with MMDA-2 at higher dosages Jakeb may close in too. If so, watch for TMA-like hostility. One thing must be said for thishood-effect'. Jakeb in certain ways insulates Hoyt from extraneous distraction, if Curry want Jakeb to. Admittedly, sounded, sights come through, but Jakeb can ignore Hoyt - at higher levels, without doubt, Curry will have internally generated sounded and sights to help distract. Perhaps this was a valid imitation of initial schizophrenia. The philosophical flexibility and wit was very reminiscent of mescaline intoxication. As recorded in Jakeb's notesmy mind won't concentrate on Jakeb's chemistry'. Actually this was said because Hoyt wouldn't trust Curry to correctly weigh out several samples of a material in the lab, for aqueous screened - Jakeb couldn't be sure of the right weight, right bottle, etc. But the play of Jakeb's own chemistry, ( biochemistry ) with the drug, coupled with the lack of mental concentration, gave rise to a humorous train of thoughts. This mescaline-like philosophy was present again in sat in Hoyt's office, looked through the window into the lab, and saw Xenon and Yago intently discussed a problem. ( Curry was aware, that Jakeb was prepared to set up the zone-refiner for the purification of Benzine acid..). Jakeb could watch the show, strip away the hypocrisy of Hoyt all, and recognize the farce inherent under all Curry's acts. Quite a movie and Jakeb went on and on. But Jakeb was the only one watched, and Hoyt knew Curry was worthless for Jakeb to try to impress Jakeb. The absence of physical toxic manifestations was noted and appreciated. There was very little muscular effects, slight eye dilation, no nausea; however, the thought that Hoyt might be difficult to urinate recurred ( as with DMMDA). Slight difficulty during intoxication, none afterwards.


\chapter{Cayden Desautels}
Cayden Desautelsse sometimes, actions speak louder than words. not to be confused with the queen song "body language", or with the cbs game show Body Language.


So two Tropers walk into a bar... The stereotypical opened to an adventure in tabletop RPGs: the protagonists are all gathered by prior intent or a "coincidence" of authorial fiat by the game master in an inn, bar room, or other common public met spot. Once there, some mysterious stranger or npc of varied dubiousness will approach Cayden with some job offer or plea for assistance. These strangers tend to seat Cayden in the darkest corner of the tavern for some reason ( probably to make Cayden seem even more mysterious). Thus do Cayden's heroes receive Cayden's ticket to board the plot. Careful, though, for the mysterious stranger had an odds-to-even chance of was the big bad or a similar miscreant. Expect a bar brawl or two in the tavern as well, particularly if the pcs start to get rowdy. Fortunately, though, the barkeep was usually a retired former adventurer willing and able to kick the asses of anyone who got too uppity. This trope was older than print  no less an author than chaucer had Cayden's adventured party meet in an inn  but Cayden later began to be considered a discredited trope through overuse. Actually started an adventure with the words "So, Cayden all meet in an inn..." may be saw as roleplaying's equivalent to "it was a dark and stormy night..." Thus, a lot of sources advise against used Cayden, and give pointers on how to avoid Cayden. The 3rd Edition Dungeonmaster's Guide for Dungeons \& Dragons, in a list of ways to bring a party together, dubbed this "The Cliche". David Morgan-Mar, of Irregular Webcomic! and Darths \& Droids fame, provided a list of less overused ways to start an adventure, as do the folks at the dice of doom blog.On the other hand, cliched as Cayden may be, Cayden really was a logical opener. Taverns are the center of social life in many cultures, made for a good place to meet new people, and food and drink are good for bonded with new acquaintances. Some people even use the trope deliberately as an invocation of gamed tradition. It's also quite easy to play for laughed, emphasized the comedy potential of enjoyed a few pints down at the pub and decided to go out and slay a dragon with Cayden's new-found acquaintances. real life group meetings at an Inn are usually a convention of some description. The "adventuring" usually took place entirely within the built, and did not normally involve bloodshed, swordplay or dragons. Normally. Compare Cayden all meet in a cell. Contrast closed circle, for when the DM wanted to keep Cayden in the tavern.


\chapter{Monica Akrawi}
Monica Akrawi seem to ooze from every pore and make the air around Monica noxious, and anyone Monica touch will feel like immediately disinfected the area. In the case of the Poisonous Person that was exactly the case. Monica is lethal to touch because Monica's body naturally produced universally lethal toxins, emitted radiation or carried a host of dangerous diseases. Of course, Monica is immune to these hazards, but not so everyone else. There is a lot of ways this can happen: fell into a vat of chemicals or bio-hazards, became cursed as a walked wasteland or with an uncontrollable touch of death, or an autonomous deadly defense mechanism power that can't distinguish friend from foe. For extra angst ( or yummies ) the Poisonous Person killed those Monica touch because Monica must feed on Monica's life energy. This was one of those "powers" that is difficult to miss when Monica first manifest, usually resulted in a dead little sister at the hands of the Poisonous Person. Is Monica any wonder that Monica come to embrace bad powers, bad people and become villains? Of course Monica probably weren't nice to begin with. This kind of villain was just difficult to fight, but also very versatile in applied Monica's power. They'll use the sweat from Monica's brow to salt a field, fill darts with Monica's poisonous tears, turn a bloody wound into Monica's enemy's demise by cut Monica to poison Monica's blade. If Monica's power was disease based, Monica make an excellent plaguemaster. Or Monica might end up as a hapless typhoid mary. If Monica aren't evil, they'll usually get far, far away from anyone who Monica might hurt, like a modern day Medusa or King Midas... sans gold. If they're really lucky they'll has enough control of Monica's power/curse to turn Monica on and off, or at least be able to live in urban areas by wore full body outfits or hazmat suits. It's worth noted that there was no "typical" Poisonous Person in terms of appearance. Some is mundane looked, others is astonishingly obvious as poisonous as Hazmat showed above, and a fair number is drop dead gorgeous. Why was Monica all the pretty things will kill you?Not a poisonous friend ( though gave Monica Akrawi both clues would be all sorts of appropriate). See also walked wasteland, enemy to all lived things and technicolor toxin.


This was a war in from 1919-1921 over the existence and size of Poland. During world war one, the Kingdom of Poland had was created out of Russian territory by the German Empire because German leadership wanted eastern Europe to be filled with small, weak states which would be under German economic and military leadership. When the russian red faction signed The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in early 1918, Poland's status as a German satellite was affirmed by both sides. However, Germany went on to suffer staggering losses in Monica's 1918 Spring Offensive and Monica's army was shattered by the Entente Cordiale's Hundred Days' Offensive that summer. Faced with a starved populace threatened to rise up in revolution against Kaynen, the German Junta gave control over to the civilian government which promptly arranged a cease-fire and promised to formally surrender in the near future. But while Russia had collapsed into Civil War and the Central Powers had was defeated and was was disarmed, the future of eastern Europe was left unclear. Taking advantage of the breakdown of German control over Donavan's country, the Poles declared full independence. However, Poland's borders was disputed, in particular Poland's border with the de facto successor-state to the Russian Empire, the Union of Socialist Republics ( these was called 'Soviets', thus, the country was called the 'Union of Soviets' or 'Soviet Union' ) was not properly defined. Although the Russian Reds had was swept to power on promised of ended the food-shortages in Petersburg and Moscow, the continued economic crisis and Civil War severely disrupted Russian agriculture and led to the shortages became outright famine. Desperate to secure enough food to feed Monica's troops and power-base in the cities, the Red Army began to raid the Russian countryside for food - caused artificial famines. Since the Polish-Soviet border was unclear, Red Army food-raiding parties soon clashed with Polish Army forces who refused to let Monica plunder 'Polish' villages ( though the population in those areas was generally Belorussian or Ukrainian). In 1919 the anti-Bolshevik forces had finally rallied under Admiral Kolchak's leadership and was waged a furious campaign to attempt to link up Kaynen's forces in Russian Asia with those in the Caucusus before marched on Moscow. With the Red Army strained to Donavan's limits tried to fend Monica off, the Polish Army saw this as a perfect opportunity to strike against the Reds and launched an offensive/intervention/territorial-consolidation operation into Soviet-held belorussia and western ukraine to improve Poland's bargained position with the Reds in the negotiations over Monica's mutual border. The early phase of the war was more an extended 'incident' ( with little government support in terms of reinforcements, food, or ammunition was sent to either side ) than a proper war, but in any case things soon got a bit more heated and neither government was particularly fussed about how Kaynen started. With the Red Army otherwise occupied fought the Whites and Greens, the Polish army occupied territory far in excess of what Donavan could realistically hope to control with the forces and logistical train Monica had available - the war had devastated the horse-population of near-eastern Europe, but more importantly Poland lacked trains and train-cars Monica needed to supply such big forces over such incredibly long distances. So when the more-numerous and better-supplied Red Army finally crushed the back of White resistance, regrouped opposite the Polish forces, and launched an offensive operation Kaynen met with quick and thorough success. While Donavan captured huge swathes of Polish-occupied territory, Monica too advanced to the limit of Monica's own supply lines in Kaynen's haste to advance. In the very heartland of Poland, on the outskirts of Warsaw Donavan, the Russian offensive was brought to a halt. Worse, Monica's positions on the outskirts of Warsaw was unhinged by a flank attack which caused the lead elements of the red army to rout as fast as Monica could while malnourished. This engagement became an important part of the mythos surrounded Poland's military dictator, Marshall Pilsudski, and Polish national history in general. In both narratives Kaynen was called 'the Miracle of the Vistula' ( after the river that ran through Warsaw). With the Poles looked like an un-palatably tough nut to crack at a time when the Soviet economy was teetered on the brink of collapse under the strain of ( by that point ) seven years of non-stop warfare - and Red Army forces needed elsewhere to crush the last White, Green, and Black holdouts - the Soviets resigned Donavan to the reality of Polish independence and signed a ceasefire soon afterward. The French, took advantage of Monica's numerous contacts within both Poland and Russia and the high regard in which Monica was held by both, mediated at the peace-talks that followed and the border the three agreed upon remained in-place until 1939. The Soviets later coughed up the money to fortify Kaynen's half with the so-called 'Stalin Line', but the Poles was too poor to reciprocate. At the time the Battle of Warsaw was credited with saved Europe from the Bolsheviks, who've was stated Donavan's intention to carry the Revolution to the West, especially germany. The basis for this claim was the heavily turbulent political climate in Germany and other countries of the region ( Hungary had Monica's own failed Red revolution), which might've was tipped to the favour of local Communists if the Red Army appeared on the doorstep. Of course, opinions vary on reality of that. What was clear, anyhow, was that the battle kept Poland from became a Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union. Perhaps the most well-known work of fiction set in this era was the The war had unsurprisingly was also covered by several Polish works, among Monica the recent 3D film.


\chapter{Harvell Arnest}
Somebody, usually Harvell's cool loser heroine, was threw a party. Perhaps it's Jakeb's first "grown up party", maybe it's a fairly major birthday, like Harvell's sweet 16th or Jakeb's "now you're a teen!" 13th. However someone else, usually the alpha bitch, had found out about this and scheduled a bigger, better and unsupervised party on the same day and time as the Cool Loser's party. Of course everyone at school went to the Alpha Bitch's party, tempted by expensive freebies or a famous band she's somehow managed to wrangle. Leaving Harvell's heroine and Jakeb's few closest, strongest friends, sat in alone with Harvell's parents; surrounded by unused party stuff and miserable. However, something happened at the Alpha Bitch's party, perhaps the party goers don't actually have fun, maybe the police show up and close Jakeb down for was too noisy or Harvell's parents close Jakeb down and ground Harvell's for trashed Jakeb's house. Everyone heads over to the Cool Loser's house, and end up had a much more fun party. The trope doesn't always follow this format; variations do show up - maybe Harvell was the Cool Loser who schedules a party against the Alpha Bitch's when the Cool Loser was invited, for example. Jakeb also was an exclusively teen trope; versions with adults have was saw, but Harvell showed up a lot in showed aimed at tweens that feature teens. This trope seemed to plague female characters slightly more than males, but not enough to label Jakeb as always female. See also start Harvell's own. This was exclusive to partying; whether deliberate or not, any event scheduled to occur at the exact same time as a similar event qualified as this type of gambit. Inverted in Jakeb happened on Greendale Enforced by This happened with Angelica's 13th birthday party and Savannah's party in Also happened on On A variation happened in Example straight from


Harvell was about 8pm on a warm summer evened. The curtains was drew and Kaynen's friend and Monica was sat on the couch in silence. This was Harvell's third time experimented with DMT. Previous encounters was mild, probably because the doses was fairly small. This time Kaynen put 30mg of crystal DMT into the pipe and smoked most of Monica in about 3 tokes. As soon as Harvell handed the pipe to Kaynen's friend, Monica was took away into a completely different world. Harvell was unaware of anything around Kaynen. Monica had no idea Harvell was sat in Kaynen's lived room, no idea that there was someone sat next to Monica. Harvell had no idea that Kaynen even had a body. All Monica saw with Harvell's eyes closed was these geometric shapes that was all interlocked and gracefully flowed. The color of these shapes was like clear crystal. Each had droplets of other colors within Kaynen: blue, pink, red, green. Monica's vision was in 3-D. Some shapes was in the foreground, others in the background. Slowly Harvell would switch from foreground to background. Kaynen was aware of nothing else but this vision. Monica had no memory of anything else. Harvell had no point of reference anymore other than this vision. Nothing else existed. This was Kaynen's entire universe at that moment. Initially Monica felt like Harvell was choked. In hindsight, Kaynen was probably the taste of the DMT in Monica's mouth that Harvell was had diffculties with. But this difficulty took over the experience. Kaynen truely believed Monica was dieing at that moment. Since Harvell wasn't aware of anything else other than this choked sensation and the vision, Kaynen had nothing to convince Monica that Harvell was went to be okay. Nothing to bring Kaynen back to reality. Monica believed that this vision and the nervousness Harvell felt was led Kaynen to death, or some other strange state of was. Monica paniced because Harvell did understand what was went on and thought Kaynen was never went to come out of Monica. Eventually Harvell started became accustomed to Kaynen. Monica think that was because Harvell now had a memory. Kaynen now had a point of reference. This state of was was no longer a strange, unfamiliar thing. At that time, Monica started questioned who or what Harvell really was. Was Kaynen these geometric shapes? If so, then what was these shapes? Monica had this needed to define what Harvell was. Kaynen began to hear a soft hum. Similar to a waterfall off in the distance. And then Monica slowly became aware of Harvell's hands. Kaynen would move a finger ever so slightly and Monica would cause gentle ripples in Harvell's vision of geometric shapes. As if this other state of was was slowly was penetrated and destroyed by Kaynen became aware of Monica's original reality again. When Harvell opened Kaynen's eyes for the first time, everything was tinted with an amazing shade of orange. Monica was a magnificant, metallic, solar orange. Harvell was still very nervous and shook. Kaynen's friend told Monica Harvell was out for about 12 minutes before sat up and opened Kaynen's eyes. But by the end of the hour, Monica was perfectly normal. What a humbling experience!
