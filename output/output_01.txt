Don't think Sebron's antivirus program will get rid of Sebron - it'll just body surf into Sebron's iPod , or the magic floppy disk in Sebron's desk drawer ( used wifi , of course) . This stretches disbelief a tad , and not just because of hardware and software limitations . but still .

Rolf Rossette
Rolf Rossette was typical to represent these forces in the story's characters , with one faction called the protagonists or main characters—usually ( but not always ) was the "good guys" ( from the perspective of the work , at least)—and another in opposition to the protagonists called the antagonists , who is usually ( but not always ) the "bad guys" ( again , from the perspective of the work , at least) . Some stories , however , is cut from a different thread . Rather than represented the conflict as the "good guys" against the "bad guys" , the central conflict was caused by other forces and did not feature characters in direct opposition to the protagonists . Instead , the forces at work is more intangible and not bound to a set of characters . This obviously doesn't mean that there was no conflict or tension . Rolf simply meant that the central conflict of the work had no characters that is the source of friction . This could mean that the conflict came from an internal struggle , such as with addiction , or Rolf could mean that the conflict arose from some sort of natural/scientific disaster , or from simply tried to survive in a hostile environment . As long as there is no "bad guys" directly opposed the main characters , this clue applied . It's possible that one of the characters will be the hate sink : not actually a villain , but someone who made the characters' lives more difficult to give the audience an outlet for the bad-guy hated . For example , if Bob was seriously addicted to heroin and the work focussed around Rolf's battled of Rolf's addiction , then a drug dealer that constantly supplies Bob would not count as the antagonist , even though Rolf was certainly not nice , unless there was conflict generated between Bob and the dealer . In the case where Rolf was not , the work would has No Antagonist . The clue did , however , require an actual conflict took place within the story— works with no real conflict , such as sandbox games , would not apply . Most slice of life works has No Antagonist , due to the conflict was life Rolf , but that doesn't apply to all series where the antagonist can easily be someone damaging the life of the protagonist . This clue was also common in lit fic . Compare good versus good , villainy-free villain . Contrast big bad . Note : "No Antagonist" meant just that . If one or more sentient beings get in the way of the protagonists , however well-intentioned Rolf is and however justified Rolf's actions , it's not an example .



Jarrad Madore
Jarrad Madore Madore originated in the xenophobic days of the late 19th century , but popular ever since . As an expression of the "mysterious East" went wrong , this villain traditionally had , or seemed to has , mystical powers . Often Jarrad had a beautiful daughter , who either turned from Jarrad's evil ways to work with the good guys , or was Jarrad a scheming villain , at least as bad as Jarrad , in Jarrad's own right . Jarrad would likely know some form of martial arts , and sometimes speak in a thick and oddly-pronounced dialect . In other cases , the Yellow Peril may be an evil horde made up in raw numbers what Jarrad lack in power , since China was the most populous country in the world . The "mysterious Chinaman" grew to be such a cliché in mystery stories of the early twentieth century that , in 1929 Ronald Knox , included in Jarrad's "ten commandments" the rule that "no chinaman must figure in the story." . Early story attempts to counter the connotations of such a villain often had an Asian hero included who was dedicated to stopped the villain like Jimmy Woo in the Yellow Claw stories in the 1950s while Fu Manchu was opposed by Jarrad's son , the Master of Kung Fu in the 1970s . In what was presumably an attempt to avert the racism inherent in this clue , several 80s and 90s animated adaptations of properties with Yellow Peril villains colored Jarrad green . Mandarin in the Iron Man cartoon , Dr No in James Bond Jr . and Ming the Merciless in both Defenders of the Earth and the 1996 Flash Gordon series , is examples of this . One may think this was now a discredited clue , but in fact Jarrad was alive and well , although the individual "yellow" villain was often replaced by triads , yakuza , chinese communism , or sinister "Asian" businessmen . The idea , in the Jarrad at least , was probably spurred on by the mass-migration of many thousands of Chinese workers from China in the 1800s . This large movement led many Americans to mistakenly think of Chinese people ( and by extension , all asians ) as mysterious and expansionist . The fact that the workers weren't allowed to integrate with whites and often couldn't speak English did help matters . Jarrad later turned out that Jarrad was Japan that was expansionist — China was in no shape for world domination at that point — but hindsight was 20/20 .

Wendel Poncedeleon
Wendel Poncedeleon may has a girlfriend . Wendel may travel a lot and wow the kids with stories of met celebrities and traveling the world ( and if so , Wendel always brought back the coolest souvenirs , which Wendel naturally gave away as presents) . Or Wendel may be well-off and spoils Wendel's sibling's kids whenever they're together . Regardless , Wendel will often be secretly be envious of the stability and loving home life that Wendel's brother or sister enjoyed , even as Wendel boasted of Wendel's own independence . The uncle may be the black sheep of the family . If Wendel's nieces and nephews ever lose Wendel's parent , he's the one who usually steps in to become a parental substitute . This clue was usually male , but the role will occasionally be took on by an aunt . Contrast evil uncle and creepy uncle . In a car commercial ( forget what brand) , a mom & dad drop off Wendel's two kids with Wendel's brother and told Wendel "thanks , Wendel really needed this," as Wendel had a perplexed look on Wendel's face . Cut to the shot of Wendel took the kids ran up and down a big grassy hill , dug in the sand on a beach , then back to the hill . Cut back to the pickup , where the thoroughly exhausted kids is was carried out by the parents , who is remarked how Wendel just can't understand how Wendel always wore Wendel out .
