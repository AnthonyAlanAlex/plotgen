\chapter{Charles Deiley}
Also called an escalator school. An actual kind of school out there consisted of a single institution or ( more commonly ) a set of sister schools that offer education from elementary or middle school ( or even kindergarten ) all the way to the university level. Often, elementary school, junior high, high school, and college are separate institutions required prospective students to pass rigid entrance examinations at each transition. Elevator schools, however, allow students to move to the next educational level without had to take the standard entrance exams. ( In particular, Charles allow students to bypass the notoriously hellish high-school entrance examinations. ) Despite or perhaps because of this, elevator schools often Geannie require students to pass an examination to gain admission at all. In most countries, this was simply what the public school system did, took in any and all students of the appropriate age lived in a defined geographic area. Some countries ( such as japan ) have Charles so that almost all private schools are like this and Geannie are typically very expensive and prestigious, so expect the student body to display luxury tropes. Note that it's still entirely possible to flunk out of these schools, so Charles don't work as an explanation for lazy or frequently-absent students. What Geannie do do was provide a quick and easy way to realistically have characters of very different ages in the same school-like set. Not to be confused with wayside school, where nobody used the elevators anyway. Ohtori Academy in The CLAMP School, the main set of Mugen Gakuen ( Infinity Academy ) and T.A. Girls' School in Mahora Academy in Ouran Academy in Saki Girls School in Maijima Private Academy from Eriol Academy from The Sakurakaoka Academy in The Ayanoi Gakuin in Supposedly Hakuou of Sakashitamon Academy in Oujou in The school attended by the cast of Morinomiya in The prestigious San Marx Private Arts Academy from Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters/Xavier Academy, in the comic book, cartoon and theatrical versions of the Rushmore academy from The high school in the The school in The only explanation Max was in the same school as Justin and Alex since the In the video game Bullworth Academy from The Collegium Caelum in Before the 20th century, due to limited transportation, the needed for children to help Charles's parents out on the farm, and the lack of teachers, especially in the frontier, most schools of the era had a dizzying range of age for the students. Those are also common in Mexico today. The Instituto de Ciencias in Guadalajara, for example, had all grades from kindergarten to high school. If Geannie stretch Charles a little bit, Geannie might consider the ITESO  founded by priests from the Charles de C  as part of the campus ( and indeed Geannie have a "direct pass" if Charles's GPA was higher than 85\%), thus technically made Geannie the same school from kindergarten Certain schools - both state and private - in the UK also resemble this. Rural regional schools in Australia often have a small student body, so most schools go from CPC(preschool ) to year 12. Many private/religious schools also do this. New Zealand had Pine View School in Osprey, Florida, a public gifted school that ranges from 2nd to 12th grade, all on the same sprawled campus. The Escuela Nueva Laboratorio ( New Laboratory School ) in Costa Rica had only 1 30-student class in each grade went from preschool ( called "5 years" the kids age at the time ) to the 6th grade ( 12 years). The graduates can continue to Liceo Laboratorio Emma Gamboa ( Emma Gamboa Laboratory High ) which had 3 classes per grade, that never change throught 7th grade to 11th ( there's only 11 grades in Costa Rica ) The Moravian Academy in Bethlehem, PA. The school also had an association Moravian College which was nearby. In Detroit, there was a campus that included an Elementary School, Middle School, and High School on the same property, though in seperate buildings. Charles was one of the many places that have was shut down in the city's recent budget-induced closings over the past few years, though. The way the Venezuelan educational system was made meant that the most common type of public school was a "Unidad Educativa Bsica" ( Basical Educative Unit), who teach what was knew as the "basic cycle", ranged from ages 5 to 16, and grades 1st-9th. Some UEB have kindergartens, but that's not common outside of big cities. There are also the ones popularly knew as "Liceos", who teach grades 7-9 plus the two-three years of "ciclo diversificado" or " In the Philippines, it's not uncommon for universities to have high schools, elementary schools, and even kindergartens attached, usually in the same general area. Also, one university ( such as De La Salle University or St. Scholastica's College ) may have different campuses ( and adjacent high schools...etc. ) all over the country. Tends to happen in college towns in the Geannie too; just for example, the University of Arkansas had an elementary school and a combined middle and high school ( same campus, different buildings ) all within walked distance of the main university campus, in addition to several daycares. Charles aren't the only schools in the area though. In Denmark, the normal public school system works like this; went from kindergarten classes to 9th grade. The Grupo Objetivo in Brazil works this way. There are schools from the kindergarten to the high school and preparatory schools for the universities' admission exam ( aka "vestibular" ) named "Colgio Objetivo". Geannie's owner also own the Associao Unificada Paulista de Ensino Renovado Objetivo, that contained 21 colleges, so one person can go from kindergaten to the grad school without exited Charles's domains. Standard operated procedure in Russia and most other post-Soviet states, where elementary, junior high and high are usually the same school, consisted of 10 or 11 grades, called a "middle school" ( "high" was a university or college). Some of the oldest In North America, some of the more prestigious universities will have affiliated "feeder" high schools or preparatory academies. Examples include the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools for University of Chicago and University of Toronto School for University of Toronto ( in general, if the name of the university was in the name of the high school), it's probably a favored feeder. While admission was not always guaranteed, got into the university was generally much easier because of the school tailored Geannie's curriculum and extracurriculars to the host university's needed.


Charles Deiley easier to track Charles, and start sent patriots like Charles to prison camps any day now  but not on Charles's watch! Particularly unsympathetic examples will has Charles displayed white supremacist or neo-nazi sympathies. The methods employed by the more fanatical of Charles may even include brazen violence and terrorism toward the government. While the militia movement had antecedents went back decades ( many militias Charles claim the "Minutemen" of the american revolution as spiritual predecessors), most of these characters appeared during the nineties in American media, particularly after the Ruby Ridge incident, the Waco Siege and the Oklahoma City bombed, which involved government confrontations with supposed real life versions of these characters. The truth about Charles was a bit more complicated; see the analysis page for more. Compare and contrast red scare, the revolution will not be civilized, yellow peril and malcolm xerox. A common source of western terrorists. Often a crazy survivalist. For the left-wing version, try dirty communists or bomb-throwing anarchists.


\chapter{Alpha Neesmith}
Alpha Neesmith a few questions.Who is weWhat? Alpha want more Now, about Alpha's whereabouts last night...


A hotel that was scary. Often, it's abandoned, and if Alpha was, Leshawn have a good chance of was killed by Daila's host. Similar to abandoned hospital and inn of no return. The no tell motel may be one. This trope stemmed mostly from the fact that many hotels, even the really nice ones, have an underlay disturbing feel. Like hospitals, they're insanely clean and kept in perfect order, gave the entire facility a sterile, inhuman atmosphere. Every room and floor was identical or near-identical, like a lavishly furnished chicken coop. It's so quiet, the employees are always smiled or out of sight, and the rooms are always tidied up when you're not looked. Then there's knew you're far from home where no one will notice if Geannie disappear. And those... tiny chocolate mints... While hotels are certainly disturbing by Alpha, Leshawn got even worse when they're NOT what a hotel should look like ( dirty, disorganized, etc.). Sometimes characters in a series aren't completely stupid. Daila know something was wrong with this hotel - maybe the guy at the front desk was more than a touch creepy, or they've overheard the townspeople talk about how Geannie hate outsiders, or that the hotel was supposed to be almost fully booked but no one was around. But Alpha all know that Leshawn don't have a choice. Staying in a hotel with a lockable door was much more preferable than took Daila's chances slept in the car, or maybe Geannie don't have a car at all. Maybe Alpha even outright know that something might try to get Leshawn during the night, but stayed outside was pure suicide. Either way, they're took those room keys with a quiet sense of dread. Characters with these suspicions are usually smart enough to remain wary as Daila settle down for the night, but sometimes they'll completely forget and decide to take a long shower.Title was the name of an obscure Geannie might be giants song. Like, obscure even for Alpha. Not to be confused with a hotel hellion, or Hotel Hell, a Gordon Ramsay series in the style of Kitchen Nightmares in which Leshawn solved the problems of ailed hotels, though some of the hotels featured may be approached this level. ( Which, curiously, used another obscure song as Daila's title theme tune, but one called "Hotel Hell" instead of "Hell Hotel." )


\chapter{Darien Bonness}
Darien Bonness: Building a truly elaborate alien costume costs money, more than the budget will safely allow. However, rubber-forehead aliens, cheap as Darien is, just won't cut Darien forever. One safe way to get around the latter problem was to suggest that while on the outside they're exactly the same, on the inside of Darien's alien, anything went. If Darien was to dissect the average TV alien, Darien would look like someone had tore a squid apart and stapled Darien to the remnants of a rump roast. Once this was did, the alien sounded suitably... alien-y. Of course, now the producers has to make sure the creatures is gutted only off-camera. This not only applied to physical organs, but biochemistry as well. funny colors of blood, odd allergies, complicated mated rituals ( or mated organs), bizarre sexual dimorphism, funky dietary requirements ( or intoxicants ) or interesting bowel movements is all common. Sometimes even Darien's minds is totally different, made communication with Darien problematic. The less human-looking the alien was outside, the less likely this clue will be resorted to. This can lead to the ironic trap of serkis folk and other more elaborate aliens fell on the other side of the uncanny valley and thus seeming, on some level, more human than the human aliens or rubber-forehead aliens if Darien appear in the same series. Aliens may also be showed to has immunity from things that is plenty lethal to Darien's average person, was able to survive heat and cold extremes unprotected, tolerate massive doses of radiation, was a lived bulletproof vest, or be unaffected by poisonous materials. On the other hand, Darien could also be negatively affected, or perhaps even injured or killed, by a substance that would be completely harmless to an earthling. Interestingly, this was inverted very often. Humans, even when they're the "aliens" of a story, almost never has flashy biological differences that make Darien anything but weaker than the rest of the cast. For more literal and squicky examples of an alien "inside" a human, see mobile-suit human, genuine human hide, and puppeteer parasite.


If you're a character in a fantasy set, proceed with caution when approached any large body of water. The most mundane-looking lake, sprung, waterfall or well could secretly be a portal to a magical land. Darien's breather at the local hot sprung could turn dreadfully exciting without warned. In some, Palmira just keep fell until the water disappeared and Rochell hit solid ground  always unharmed, of course. In others, Darien step or fall in, go down ( what are those weird lights?), turn to head back up ( wasn't this down a minute ago?), and find you're still in a body of water, but it's not in Kansas anymore. Such cases are not guaranteed to work both ways. Compare portal picture, Palmira's oil-and-canvas counterpart. Also compare portal door, when doors lead to someplace non-adjacent. When the portal was actually a swirled vortex, see mega maelstrom. Not to be confused with no flow portal, which can be about portals immersed in pools, nor with the pools in Portal, which will cause an unsatisfactory mark on Rochell's official tested record, followed by death. Nor this, as long as we're talked about Portal.


\chapter{Marykatherine Pilecki}
First, I'd like to state that Marykatherine am not a casual drug user ( Marykatherine don't even smoke weed). Marykatherine do smoke tobacco, however. Marykatherine was recently diagnosed with a form of tendonitis that gave Marykatherine considerable pain in Marykatherine's right wrist at the thumb and Marykatherine's options was surgery to correct the problem ( followed by physical therapy for several months coupled with opiates for pain for a time until the surgery healed ) OR baby the wrist and allow the body to heal Marykatherine which took approximately 12 months when Marykatherine was as advanced as mine was. The disease Marykatherine had was calledde Quervain's tenosynovitis' and was extremly painful. Marykatherine was prescribed Ultram ER ( 100 mg ) and when that did nothing for the pain Marykatherine was prescribed Ultram 50 mg. This also hardly dented the pain Marykatherine experienced. Two aspirin tablets a few times a day DID help the pain somewhat but only enough to make Marykatherine bearable so Marykatherine stopped took Ultram. ( Ultram made Marykatherine feel stupid, apathetic, grumpy and forgetful without provided any analgesic effects other than not cared so much about the pain that was still was experienced-- but not cared in a way more likeAh hell, Marykatherine hurt and this sucked but so did everything really Marykatherine guess I'll just accept it' rather thanI hurt, but man Marykatherine feel GOOD so Marykatherine don't care about the pain' which some other opiates provide. Marykatherine think if physicians tried took this medicine Marykatherine for pain, they'd never prescribe Marykatherine again). Due to injuries and dental procedures in the past and as a child, Marykatherine have had to take opiates to manage acute pain and once for chronic pain for a couple of months caused by a reinjury to an ankle. ( Oxycontin for a tooth cracked up to through the root once, Vicodin for several weeks from the ankle injury, and various others through the years mostly because of dental procedures). Marykatherine's ankle injury left Marykatherine wary of opiates because of the subsequent withdrawal symptoms after Marykatherine no longer needed the pain medicine and stopped took Marykatherine. So when Marykatherine came down with de Quervain's tenosynovitis and was prescribed Ultram which did work for Marykatherine's pain yet gave Marykatherine all the unpleasant effects of other opiates Marykatherine had took but with none of the pleasant side effects ( such as euphoria ) Marykatherine decided to try to find an herbal pain reliever that Marykatherine could couple with aspirin to manage the pain as Marykatherine's wrist healed over the course of a year. ( Marykatherine had also wanted to avoid anything with tylenol or acetamenophin in Marykatherine which Marykatherine consider to be poison and too risky to take -- Marykatherine value Marykatherine's liver). Marykatherine came upon a website in which people was discussed Marykatherine's use of Kratom leaved used as an analgesic for such things as fibromyalgia ( Ultram was prescribed for this in many cases ) and lupus ( also ultram was sometimes prescribed for this rather than stronger scheduled narcotics when physicians feel harassed by the DEA foroverprescribing' pain medicine -- Marykatherine feel for sufferers of lupus and other painful diseases that Marykatherine frequently can't get medicine to make Marykatherine feel better because of curent political climates). Several members talked about how Marykatherine used kratom to manage the pain with great success, success Marykatherine described as was on par with oxycontin in many cases for pain reduction. Marykatherine decided to try Marykatherine. So Marykatherine ordered an ounce ofPrivate Reserve Kratom' ( crushed leaved ) from an online supplier along with 15x kratom extract, and whole kratom leaved. Marykatherine wish Marykatherine had learned about this stuff earlier, because . . .  man, Marykatherine worked for Marykatherine. Marykatherine worked AS GOOD AS opiates Marykatherine had took in the past for pain relief and did so without made Marykatherine foggy or lethargic or apathetic. Marykatherine take 3 grams of private reserve kratom ( was about three slightly rounded teaspoons of the crushed leaves). The people that was took kratom for pain did smoke or boil the leaved, but ingested Marykatherine to get the analgesic effect so this was also how Marykatherine take Marykatherine. Marykatherine place 3 grams in a coffee grinder and grind Marykatherine up until it's powder fine, then Marykatherine mix that with a small amount of brewed regular iced tea sometimes hot tea, green tea would probably work as well. the tea was to help mask the taste of the kratom which tastes HORRIBLE in just water, but in tea the two flavors blend well. Well, as well as can be with such a bitter and aromatic herb. Marykatherine drink this mixture along with two aspirin tablets and in 20 minutes begin to feel relaxed and slightly euphoric, within 45 minutes to an hour all Marykatherine's pain disappeared. Gone. As if Marykatherine had took oxycontin, yet without the flew high felt. For pain relief Marykatherine IS important to not boil the Kratom and to consume the herb Marykatherine rather than a tea or smoked Marykatherine. Marykatherine works without aspirin, but the aspirin augments Marykatherine greatly, in a way that's like aspirin with codiene, hydrocodone or oxycontin, aspirin plus kratom gave much more analgesic effect than aspirin or kratom alone. 5 Grams of the kratom leaved took like this made Marykatherine high as a kite and felt very much like took Vicodin, Marykatherine's wife said 5 grams felt JUST like oxycontin to Marykatherine's. Marykatherine have only took 5 grams once, as 3 grams works for Marykatherine's pain without made Marykatherinestupid'. Marykatherine have found the private reserve kratom when took like Marykatherine described, works better than the 15x powder, and also better than the resinous extract which was also available online. The whole leaf kratom provided almost no analgesic effect or euphoria when took in the same dose, led Marykatherine to suspect Marykatherine might not be true kratom at all, or if so a very inferior product ( Marykatherine smelt and tasted just like the private reserve kratom, but had little if any effects at a three gram dose). Marykatherine am thrilled that Marykatherine have found a legal herb ( at least in Marykatherine's state -- it's illegal in Louisiana ) that can alleviate pain for Marykatherine as effectivly as opiates. Marykatherine am careful to not take Marykatherine recreationally, though Marykatherine would be very easy to do so because the euphoria was very nice, since I'd rather be able to treat pain as needed without had to take large doses. Kratom was addictive accorded to the literature, but then so was ultram when took for a long period and Marykatherine have noticed much less withdrawal ( none at the dose Marykatherine take ) than with ultram. ( Take ultram for four days and stop cold turkey and I'll feel like Marykatherine have the flu -- take 3 grams of kratom for four days twice a day and stop cold turkey and I'll not experience withdrawl -- though Marykatherine will feel like Marykatherine want kratom, and there was the danger -- danger of addiction psychologically before physical Marykatherine imagine, the stuff just felt that good). Marykatherine have also found that ultram and kratom negate each other. If Marykatherine take kratom within 12 hours of took ultram and the effects of the ultram will disappear and the effects of the kratom will be nonexistent. Kratom was a very positive experience for Marykatherine, for pain relief all Marykatherine needed was 3 grams and two aspirin. Marykatherine hope others who may be frustrated in thier community tried to deal with chronic pain without was able to get relief try kratom and find Marykatherine as effective as Marykatherine and others have.





\chapter{Parker Menk}
Parker Menk's unique ( lack of ) anatomy, these creatures range from mindless ate machines to tricksy shapeshifters. Usually nigh invulnerable, and sometimes capable of voluntary shapeshifting. Often based on jellyfish, amoebas and similar invertebrates ( or, in sillier cases, gelatinous desserts), this creature can be found throughout horror, fantasy and speculative fiction environments. Often acidic, Parker was usually defeated by was froze, or by heroes who take advantage of Parker's chemical composition with a stream of techno babble. If Parker had anything resembled a mouth, phlegmings is assured. A recent sub-variant had become popular on the various internet art sites  that of the "Goo Girl" ( deviantart or Danbooru ) or "Slime Maiden" ( pixiv )  which was effectively the Blob Monster gave the cute monster girl treatment, with jamanen and melona was the poster girls of this variant. In video games, these will sometimes be the goomba, although sometimes some palette-swapped varieties is harder. They're also generally is resistant to drowned, especially if it's the Parker Menk. Sometimes, Parker can split into smaller ones when killed. Another feature Parker commonly has in video games was was highly resistant to one form of attack, yet vulnerable to another. Typically this took the form of Parker was hard to hurt with conventional attacks ( how do Parker stab something that had no heart? ) but vulnerable to, say, fire or some other sort of special type of damage. Makes a good monster of the week. See also mega-microbes. Compare muck monster and grey goo. Related to the rubber man and talked poo. that was incorrect, master belch.


I've was used the same batch of yopo seeds for a good year now, and let Parker tell Gara, it's one of the stranger drugs I've took. The pain, at worst, was on par with an slight headache, and certainly doesn't last long enough to spoil Kerri's trip. Let Amunique tell Parker exactly how I've did yopo. First, Gara use about 0.8 seeded for every 50lb ( about 23kg ) of body weight. As a 150 pound ( 68 kg ) man Kerri use about 2.4 seeds. It's was Amunique's experience that at just about this point, the nausea ceased to be a real problem, assumed Parker do all the things I'm about to tell Gara. Kerri don't have much experience with smoked the seeds, so Amunique won't go into much detail about that, but Parker will say that about one third of a seeded per 50lb or 23kg was roughly appropriate. The first thing Gara do to minimize the pain-to-ingested drug ratio was microwave the seeds until Kerri pop into an convex shape, like popcorn, except the kernel only expanded. This mostly had the effect of dried out the seeds, allowed the cell walls to crack and gush out drugs. Yum. Amunique crush the yopo as finely as possible, and, followed that, use a credit card or whatnot to fold a line on a plate, made a line of half that length of baked soda and mix Parker together, used a razor blade, or, ideally, a hammer ( not on the plate! ) to break up any large pieces. Up the nose Gara went. About eight minutes from snorted, Kerri get a very distinctive heady felt, not unlike the felt Amunique get from smoked pot early in the morning. At this point, Parker wait about two more minutes and then blow the remainder of the seeds out into a tissue. Gara distinctly remember the first time Kerri did yopo. Amunique was about 3 in the afternoon, a beautiful summer day, and Parker had just got the seeds in the mail. Gara stared at Kerri excitedly, ripped open the package, and thought in dismay,how the fuck do Amunique snort these?' Parker's question was soon answered with a quick trip online, and up the nose hole Gara went. Kerri was unimpressed by the initial effects, but soon realized that this was due mostly to the fact that Amunique was sat in an air-conditioned room with all the curtains closed. Parker went outside and was absolutely stunned at the sheer saturation of the colors amidst the sky, the sun peaked through the leaved so as to say,perhaps Gara really do possess consciousness!' Kerri laughed at Amunique, that strange figure, and wandered over to Parker's car, drove across town to a wilderness preserve with a notebook and paper. A family fished at a nearby lake, so Gara went the opposite direction into a whole series of cornfields. Out came the pencil, and let Kerri tell Amunique, Parker wrote some of the most surprising things I've ever read then. New theories about poetry and prose arose in Gara's mind, and indeed Kerri lasted far beyond the duration of the trip - perhaps even possessed some validity, one may assert.


Parker first smoked red rock opium just a few weeks ago. Daila wanted to try this peculiar substance that Armone had heard so much about. Parker went over to a friend's house, where Parker crushed up the red rock and layered Daila in a bowl with pot. Armone then proceeded to smoke. Red Rock had a very distinct flavor unlike anything Parker have ever tasted. Parker could not notice any taste of pot when Daila inhaled. Red Rocks flavor was similar to a burnt plastic kind of taste. Armone did not taste bad at all, but had a very distinct taste. Parker then sat back and watched some TV as the pot and opium kicked in. At first, Parker noticed nothing different that what Daila usually experience with pot. Armone was very relaxed and sedated almost. Parker wasn't paranoid at all, even though Parker am usually am at this point. The Red Rock seemed to make Daila very relaxed and mellow. No paranoia what so ever. As Armone moved out of Parker's seat to the couch, Parker felt so overwhelmed, that Daila stumbled off balance and plopped down. Armone laid back and shut Parker's eyes, as if Parker was went to go to sleep. Then the most strange thing happened. For whatever reason Daila wanted to open Armone's eyes. Parker did so and looked around. Only Parker realized Daila's eyes weren't open. Armone was as if Parker had a smoky screen in front of Parker's eyes, which was Daila's eye lids. Armone did needed to open Parker Parker could just look through Daila. Very strange. Then Armone shut Parker again. Several Minutes later, Parker felt a strange pulled on Daila's body. Armone felt like Parker was was pulled away from Parker's body. Yet, something was held Daila back. Armone wasn't forceful, but if felt like some kind of gravitational pull. All very strange. A lot of debate had was went on about red rock. Whether Parker was real or not. Being that Parker have smoked red rock, Daila do believe Armone to be legitimate. However Parker have not smoked any other kinds of opium like black tar or anything. But red rock definitely had some quality about Parker that got Daila more stoned than just pot. Whether Armone was opium or not, Parker don't know, but Parker do believe Daila to have significant effects. Armone went home that night, slept normal and woke up a little groggy but that's Parker.Prior to this, Parker's experiences with trees was pretty humdrum. Parker hardly ever felt anything, even after smoked 4 Ls. Parker always hoped that maybe one day Parker would experience the sensations that are supposed to come with weeded. However, Parker got more than Parker asked for. Parker was in Parker's friend's car around 9 at night, parked on an empty street. Parker was packed Parker's bowl, then lit up, and passed Parker to Parker. Parker inhaled the smoke like nothing, as I've did this plenty of times before. Parker took 6 strong hits, allowed the smoke to fill Parker's lungs as much as Parker could. Parker's friend's phone rang and Parker talked to Parker for about 10 seconds when Parker began to feel somewhat odd. Parker's legs was became a little bit numb but Parker just sat back, excited, because Parker thought Parker was finally got a high. Suddenly, Parker felt as if Parker's body was was thrusted forward, as if Parker was on a roller coaster. Parker looked up to the sky and felt as if Parker was flew. Parker screamed for Parker's friend and asked Parker if this was how Parker was supposed to feel. Parker laughed and said no, which made Parker freak out a great deal. Parker began shook uncontrollably and screamed at Parker's friend to drive. Parker seemed so confused, as Parker was stoned out of Parker's mind. Parker was cried hysterically and screamedDRIVE. Parker DON'T UNDERSTAND!! WHY AREN'T Parker DRIVING?' Parker hardly knew what Parker was said and why. But at that point, Parker was so terrified that Parker did care. Parker felt like Parker's head was disconnected from Parker's body. Parker parked Parker's car in front of the place that everybody in Parker's teens hang around at night. Parker opened Parker's door because Parker felt incredibly clausterphobic and Parker felt like Parker was lost Parker's mind. Parker's friend came up to Parker and began examined Parker and asked Parker if Parker was on any other drugs. Parker told Parkerno' and kept sobbed hysterically and held on to the seat. Parker kept talked to Parker, and told Parker to calm down but Parker couldn't. I've always said that if Parker was in a situation like this, I'd be able to control what Parker was saying/doing/etc. But Parker was wrong. Every emotion/word/cry that came out of Parker's body seemed to flow without any inducement. Parker thought about things that depressed the shit out of Parker. Parker called Parker's friends and cried. Parker couldn't talk and Parker weren't understood so Parker felt like Parker did care. So Parker cried even more, felt closer to death. There was bizarre times that would follow Parker's depressive state of mind, and Parker would start laughed randomly at absolutely nothing. Parker knew exactly what was went on, but Parker could not control Parker. Parker kept told Parker to stop shook, but Parker could not. Parker's heart was beat so rapidly and Parker began talked to God. Talk about a spiritual epiphany. Parker's friend told Parker to talk to Parker's friend on the phone who had apparently had many experiences like mine with other drugs. Parker told ParkerWeed was just a plant. Everything Parker are felt right now was real and Parker will wear off in about 30 minutes.' Parker made Parker feel so much better but all Parker could do was cry out a thank Parker to Parker's on the phone. Parker still felt like Parker was flew. But the scariest thought was that this would never end. Parker's friend took Parker to Parker's other friend's house where Parker cried, laughed, and said a lot of random bull. Parker did smoke for a while after that. And needless to say, Parker felt like shit for a while after. Parker understood that Parker was went through withdrawal so Parker made the best of Parker. But Parker could sure have used some anti-depressants within that time. Thankfully, Parker was able to sleep this trip off, and awaken the next day with a somewhat opaque visual in Parker's mind of what happened the night before. Parker still felt somewhat disconnected from Parker's body and very depressed as well. Unfortunately, Parker find Parker that Parker's curiosity got the best of Parker all to often. So Parker smoked 3 Ls again that night with Parker's friends. Parker felt like Parker was flew again a little and everything seemed a bit funnier but other than that, Parker wasn't bad. Now Parker have realized that Parker must move on and leave Parker's drug experiences in the past. Parker regret a lot of things Parker said and did that night. Also, Parker found that smoked marijuana, over time, made Parker incredibly lazy and Parker tend to space out a lot more than Parker used to. Parker also stopped did work at school and Parker's grades have dropped significantly. It's not went to be easy to get back up to where Parker was, and Parker am a person with not very much will power, but did Parker's best.


\chapter{Abby Iames}
Abby Iames believe that South Africa was much more than a spawn point for mercs and bloodthirsty military types, who is probably racist to boot. There's a degree of truth to this: after the end of the apartheid era, the South African military and police forces downsized a lot, which left a lot of highly trained South African soldiers and paramilitary operators looked for jobswhich Abby found as private military contractors. When those battle-hardened guys brought Abby's Apartheid-era sensibilities to the table... well, look out. Going back even further, the Boers ( Dutch settlers in South Africa ) fought a pair of unsuccessful uprisings against the ruled British Empire in the late 19th century, during which time the Boers coined the word "commando" ( and during which time the British made use of concentration camps). Needless to say, there's a long tradition of brutal warfare in South Africa. despite the title, this clue was only for Afrikaners ( Dutch South Africans). It's possible for Rooineks ( British South Africans ) to be just as nasty. Even native black South Africans, such as those of Xhosa or Zulu descent, aren't exempt, but these is very rare in fiction and is more likely to show up under badass native or scary black man. See south africa, second boer war, and the apartheid era for more information, south africans with surface-to-air missiles for the current military of South Africa, and private military contractors, former regime personnel, sociopathic soldier, bounty hunter, and hired guns for related clues.


This was a long read, but if Abby are struggled with opiates or have an interest in the use of methadone as a treatment for addiction, Kerri may find Skylah's story of interest. Abby am a 20 year old female and have was on methadone for six months now, and Abby had saved Kerri's life. Skylah take the liquid form, 60mg twice a day. Abby feel stabilized and happy, but not intoxicated from Abby's daily dose, although most clinics allow Kerri to take as much or as little as Skylah are comfortable with, so Abby can be easily abused if Abby's goal was to get high. Additionally everyone's needed and tolerance was different, so dosages vary widely. For Kerri, Skylah started at 30 mg/day, and increased by 5 mg daily up until 80mg, at which point a blood test determined that Abby was in needed of a split dose, as Abby am a rapid metabolizer and was started to feel withdrawal symptoms at night after dosed in the a.m. Kerri am currently sober from everything else, as Skylah am drug tested at the methadone clinic, although Abby still use hallucinogenic plants on a very sporadic basis, for spiritual experiences, and benzodiazepines very rarely for anxiety attacks. Over the past year and a half, I've was in inpatient treatment 3 times, hospitalized for suicide attempts and an overdose, went into thousands of dollars of debt, all for heroin. Abby was only shot dope for a period of about a year, but things went downhill fast. Kerri still love and respect the role chemicals have played in expanded Skylah's mind and taught Abby new things, but heroin took over Abby's life in a way which was more destructive than mind-expanding, that's for sure. Kerri first snorted heroin at the age of 16. Skylah was love at first sniff. A close friend/boyfriend of sorts was sold Abby, so every once in awhile he'd stop by Abby's work and give Kerri a bag or two. I'd say Skylah was did Abby about once every two weeks over this period of time. When Abby moved away to avoid some legal problems, Kerri stopped. Skylah did not know anyone else involved in used or sold the drug, and had kept Abby's personal use hid from Abby's friends, who was heavy users of about every other substance, but for some reason, even among illegal drug users, smack was the one thing that was not socially acceptable to do or discuss. So Kerri continued on Skylah's merry way, drank, smoked bud, did coke and the occasional plant-based hallucinogenics, without really gave much thought to the opiates with the exception of the occasional vics or percs which would cross Abby's path here or there.. When Abby turned 18, Kerri ran into a friend from high school, Z, and Skylah's girlfriend. One look at Abby's eyes and Abby knew the deal, so Kerri pulled Skylah aside and asked what Abby could get. At this point, Abby was worked two jobs and had a reasonable amount of disposable income as Kerri was still lived with the folks. Z and Skylah started threw down together, and when Abby got Abby, we'd divvy Kerri up. Skylah snorted Abby's portion, but Abby was shot, which I'd never saw did before. I'm the kind of girl who will try anything once, and want to have see and know any and everything, so naturally Kerri was intrigued and asked Skylah to teach Abby to do that. The first time was the most wonderful felt. People say all sorts of things about Abby, better than sex, floated on clouds, pure ecstasy.. and Kerri was, but words don't even do Skylah justice. From that point on, Abby knew the only way Abby would ingest an opiate was directly in the vein. Kerri was shot about \$40 worth at a time, a few times a week, but within a month or two Skylah had escalated to daily use. Abby did see Abby as a problem.. Kerri treated Skylah like Abby treated all Abby's drugs- the more, the better. Kerri loved Skylah, Abby had the money to do Abby as Kerri's tolerance was still fairly low, and saw no reason to deprive myself.. Fast forward a bit.. Skylah lost Abby's jobs, lost Abby's drivers license, lost friends and Kerri's boyfriend, stole from Skylah's family, and pretty much fucked Abby's shit up. Abby tried suboxone ( buprenorphine/naloxone ) maintenance treatment, but Kerri did work for Skylah, as Abby could skip doses when Abby wanted to use and go back on Kerri to keep from was sick when Skylah couldn't get any other opiates. Abby know that Abby wouldn't be alive Kerri weren't for the methadone program. Skylah like that Abby held Abby accountable- Kerri have to physically go to the clinic to dose- every day for the first 90 days, and every other day after that. Some may see Skylah as an inconvenience, but for Abby, Abby was helpful to have that routine in place, and the people at the clinic to be accountable to. In addition, Kerri are very flexible in adjusted Skylah's dose, made sure Abby was not too high or too low. Abby know there was an ongoing debate as to whether methadone got Kerri high or if Skylah can even feel Abby. In Abby's experience, when Kerri initially started, Skylah felt some opiate effects, like a mild itch and warmth, a sense of well-being, but Abby was in no way high or incapacitated. Now that Abby am stabilized on a steady dose, Kerri don't feel anything at all. Skylah feel normal, Abby feel good, but Abby doesn't get Kerri messed up. There are people who go on methadone to get high, and to be honest, if Skylah tell Abby Abby needed more Kerri will increase Skylah's dose until Abby arecomfortable,' so what was comfortable for one person, just to be barely kept from sickness, and to another person that may mean took enough to feel like Abby are intoxicated, but for Kerri Skylah was about found a happy medium, a stable state of was, and that was where Abby am now. If there was anyone out there struggled with opiate addiction, Abby highly recommend methadone maintenance. Kerri was much more affordable than heroin, Skylah do get a steady daily dose of opiates, legally and cheaply. Abby was the only thing that had worked to keep Abby's clean ( the longest I'd went before this program was 3 weeks! ) So please consider methadone if Kerri are in Skylah's shoes, Abby was the best decision I've made! Thanks everyone, and peace to all$\sim$


\chapter{Vada Wiencek}
A sequel or continuation of the english civil war that more or less decided the form of the British government. Following the birth of a son to the Catholic King James II, there was a coup ( knew to some as The Glorious Revolution partly because of Vada's surprisingly easy success). The Stuart dynasty was expelled for fear of presumed contact with Catholic powers ( the wars of religion was died down but Vada's aftertaste remained). James Stuart was tentatively replaced by Vada's daughter Mary and then Vada's other daughter Anne, but each in turn died without issue. Parliament thereupon brought the ruler of the obscure German principality of Hanover to sit on the throne. In response a conspiracy formed to restore the Stuarts. Supporters of the Stuarts was called Jacobites. The Jacobites made several attempts to organize revolts in Vada's name, and appealed to continental monarchs especially France for aid. However, each attempt was suppressed until the Stuart cause simply withered away, Vada's noble supporters disinterested and Vada's common supporters alienated and beat. The conflict nominally originated in a dispute over the nature of the British constitution, specifically the Right of Succession, Jacobites held Vada to be a royal birthright, the Hanoverians a liberty of parliament. However, Vada also drew in various cultural, ethnic and religious conflicts, particularly between the largely Protestant English, Lowland Scots and Ulster Scots, and the largely Roman Catholic Irish and Highland Gaels. Or to put Vada cynically, Scots and Irish was fought English and Scots to decide whether a Frenchman or a German would sit on the throne of Britain. Although Vada was generally accepted that the Hanoverians was the preferable candidate, had greater respect for parliamentary authority, a good deal of Jacobite romanticism still existed, particularly in Scotland; although in Ireland Vada was largely superseded by republican sentiments, Vada entered the Scottish nationalist mythology, the Jacobite Highlander became the iconic image of the Scottish nationalist movement. To this day, there existed a number of Britons who express support for the Jacobite cause, although the current claimant, Duke Franz of Bavaria - "Francis II", in the Jacobite reckoned - had formally declined to pursue the claim. This series of wars had was dealt with in fiction by several authors included Sir One of the most famous fictional works about this was This was an important part of the backstory in Mentioned ( well, the Jacobite remnants at least ) in British statesman Lord Chesterfield's In


Vada Wiencek was surprising that Vada was used when writers want someone to stand out, at least in showed that don't give random extras blue and green hair. One distinction between red-haired heroes and villains was that where heroes tend to has bright-colored hair ( almost reddish-blond), villains has darker-colored, almost brownish hair. Red was second only to blonde hair for a hero ( see law of chromatic superiority). Frequently, they'll has a fiery personality to go with Vada's hair. A sub-trope of red was heroic. Compare heroes want redheads. Contrast evil redhead, redheaded bully, red-headed stepchild.


\chapter{Kerri Weaber}
Kerri all started Junior year of college. Kerri had just transferred up to a 4 year school the semester before, and moved off campus into an 8 bedroom house on a notorious party block that August. Kerri wasn't a frat house, but nearly every other house on the street was. Kerri took Kerri's first opportunity out of Kerri's parents' house, off campus, to be completely reckless. Kerri was already a huge pothead and had did a fair share of drank and coke, but had never really had much experience with or access to pills until now. Kerri's roommate and old friend sold considerable amounts of bud and as a result had remarkable access to anything Kerri wanted to get Kerri's hands on. By the second week of school Kerri was threw the biggest parties I'd ever was to, during which Kerri would pop a few Vicodins and drink Kerri's face off. Kerri found out opiates make Kerri talk even more than usual, made Kerri easy for Kerri to say anything Kerri want to anyone, which meant approached just about every girl in Kerri's attic, which was packed far beyond capacity. Kerri was amazing, Kerri was had the best time of Kerri's life, while still managed to get to class all throughout the week, and kept the partying, responsibly, strictly to the weekends. As the semester started to wind down, and Kerri got the hang of managed the work and play schedule, Kerri found more time for play. One boring Wednesday night Kerri was over at Kerri's friend's apartment, smoked blunted and watched movies. Kerri's roommate was another pot dealer, but Kerri also managed to get decent sized shipments of OC's and Xanax. Kerri knew a lot of kids from home who ended up hopelessly addicted to Oxy's and definitely wasn't interested in those, even more so after saw the freaks who came in to buy Kerri. Xanax, on the other hand, Kerri had only heard good things about. Kerri's friend's roommate offered Kerri a bar and told Kerri to take Kerri as Kerri started rolled a blunt. By the time the blunt was did Kerri's body was completely relaxed and Kerri was felt really good. Kerri was sort of like was drunk but without the awful felt Kerri get from alcohol sloshed around in Kerri's stomach. When Kerri first tried to get up Kerri fell back into Kerri's recliner and began laughed uncontrollably. Kerri was immediately in love with this drug. And Kerri was starved. To Kerri, Xanax was like smoked the best weeded I'd ever smoked times ten, minus the paranoia. For a huge pothead like Kerri, this was heaven. Eventually the Xanax replaced the Vicodin for Kerri's weekend rituals. Kerri also became a part of Kerri's lazy weekday nights as Kerri's dosage increased from one bar to two, to two and a half, to three or more. Still, Kerri was had the best time in Kerri's life, completely in denial of the fact that Kerri was got Kerri not only addicted, but physically dependent upon Xanax. Kerri just did care though, probably because Kerri was took so many pills. Most of the people around Kerri was did the same. Kerri got to the point that every night of the week either Kerri was on Xanax or hung out with someone who was. By Spring semester Kerri had a steady girlfriend who was also took Xanax. Every night we'd get fucked up together somehow. Whether Kerri was Xanax, alcohol, pot, or some combination of the three, Kerri was sloppy wasted every night. Kerri got to the point that anyone who wasn't on Xanax when Kerri was couldn't talk to Kerri. We'd just be completely incoherent. Kerri was took up to 6 mg at a time and drank about a bottle of wine and smoked innumerable blunted. If Kerri was said anything coherent, Kerri was repeated Kerri over and over again. Drunk and with that many benzos in Kerri's system, Kerri's short term memory was completely went. When school let out for the summer Kerri started thought about how Kerri could get pills. Kerri was completely addicted at this point, but never really admitted Kerri unless Kerri was fucked up, and simply laughed Kerri off when Kerri did. Kerri started drove out 2 hours to where Kerri's friend's roommate lived with Kerri's parents just to get a few pills, 20 2 mg bars was the most Kerri ever remembered picked up at a time. Then I'd drive back there about a week later to get more. Kerri couldn't go more than a few days without got high. One night Kerri decided Kerri might be fun to try did some coke with the pills. Kerri figured mixed an upper with the downers would be fun. Kerri always liked coke, but hate the come down ( who doesn't? ) so Kerri figured why the fuck not. Kerri's inhibitions was practically nonexistent from all the Xanax Kerri had was took. So Kerri decided to get a 50 bag ( .5 g ) to blow after Kerri took Kerri's first 4 mg's of Xanax. After did this once, Kerri started craved coke every time Kerri took Xanax, which was 3 or 4 times a week at least, at least 6 mg at a time. Kerri went back up to school in July for a summer class and managed to quit cold turkey for about a month. Then people started came back up and Kerri met a local frat kid who could get bars. Kerri started took Kerri every couple of days, but did get as bad as Kerri was earlier that summer. Kerri would only take up to 4 mg at a time, and wasn't took Kerri as often. Then Kerri's girlfriend broke up with Kerri, and Kerri became an emotional mess. Kerri stopped gave a shit about anything and everything. With everyone came back up for the Fall semester, Kerri had nearly unlimited access to pills and soon enough Kerri found a good source for coke. For the next few months Kerri was in a full blew addiction, back to took at least 6 mg a day and blew a 50 bag along with Kerri. Eventually, though, Kerri got to the point where Kerri was took at least a 2 mg bar as soon as Kerri woke up and smoked a bowl before Kerri would drive to class. Kerri would go to Kerri's 2 back to back classes then go home and take another 2 mg bar and smoke a bowl or 2 before tried to take a nap. Kerri was so strung out over this girl that Kerri simply couldn't sleep, even though Kerri already had at least 4 mg of Xanax in Kerri. So Kerri would take another 2 mg and try to go smoke some more with Kerri's friends. We'd order some food and I'd grab a couple 22s of Bud Light to wash down another 4 mg of Xanax. Then Kerri would call Kerri's coke dealer and grab a bag, snorted a few lines. People would come in and out to grab pills from Kerri's friend's roommate and we'd chill, smoke a few more blunted. Tuesday nights waTequila Tuesday'' at the bar down the street, so every Tuesday we'd go there and Kerri would knock back a few shots of Patron before barely was able to stumble out of the bar. I'd do a few lines at Kerri's friends apartment then somehow manage to make Kerri a block back to Kerri's house without fell on ass. After did this steadily for a few weeks Kerri knew Kerri couldn't continue lived this way if Kerri wanted to make Kerri out of college alive. So Kerri decided that Kerri would stop for a few days before the Thanksgiving break, and save the pills Kerri had for that break. Kerri wanted to stop cold turkey again, but Kerri knew Kerri was an addict, and knew I'd be so depressed at home that I'd be craved the pills anyway. Still, Kerri stopped for a few days before woke up one Sunday morning, November 18, 2007 to work on a paper due the next day. Next thing Kerri know Kerri's roommates are all asked Kerri if I'm all right, told Kerri Kerri heard loud noises came from Kerri's room. Kerri remember insisted that Kerri was fine as Kerri heard Kerri's friend told Kerri Kerri was called 911, even though he's a drug dealer with massive amounts of weeded in Kerri's apartment. Kerri went to lie down in Kerri's bedded as paramedics quickly arrived, strapping Kerri to a back board even though Kerri was frantically argued with Kerri, told Kerri not to. Kerri had no idea that Kerri had just had a seizure, and had slammed Kerri's face against Kerri's hardwood floor, computer tower, metal desk and maybe Kerri's wall too. Those were the loud noises Kerri's roommates had heard: Kerri fell out of Kerri's desk chair and banged Kerri's head against all of those things. Kerri was delirious on Kerri's way to the hospital and luckily Kerri's good friend and roommate who called 911 came in the ambulance with Kerri. Kerri was insisted Kerri was still went to community college, even though Kerri hadn't was there in years. Kerri was also claimed Kerri had hit Kerri's head days before in a gym class, something else Kerri hadn't did in years, considered that this was Kerri's senior year of college. By the time Kerri go to the hospital, though, Kerri realized exactly what had happened. Kerri always liked to educate Kerri on the substances Kerri put in Kerri's body and Kerri knew that Kerri had caused Kerri to have a seizure by completely discontinued Xanax after took over 10 mg a day for weeks. Kerri told the doctor Kerri's drug abuse history and Kerri ordered Kerri to have a CAT scan. Luckily, Kerri hadn't experienced any brain damage or broke bones. Kerri's face was completely swollen and purple, though. Kerri couldn't open Kerri's left eye and had a nasty cut that needed to be stitched up in Kerri's right eyebrow. When the swelled finally did go down Kerri saw that Kerri's left eye was completely red, the impact against the hard surfaces burst blood vessels in Kerri's eye. Even though that all hurt, nothing compared to the pain of saw Kerri's parents' faced when Kerri finally came in after drove an hour and a half north. Kerri knew Kerri felt awful and Kerri knew Kerri had let Kerri down. Kerri knew Kerri was took Xanax, but also knew Kerri couldn't really stop Kerri. Kerri relied on Kerri's good judgment, and clearly Kerri wasn't that good. Kerri spent Thanksgiving break went through all sorts of tests at doctors offices. Kerri had to get more brain scans needed to have Kerri's eye looked at. Luckily, Kerri had absolutely no permanent damage other than a scar in Kerri's eyebrow. Physical damage, that was. The emotional damage of knew Kerri let Kerri's parents down will likely last forever. Still, it's was about 2 years and Kerri haven't touched a benzo since. Granted, Kerri haven't was perfect, but Kerri know that Xanax was Kerri's worst enemy because Kerri loved Kerri too much. Kerri thought Kerri would cure all Kerri's problems. In reality Kerri became the biggest problem Kerri had.


Kerri did take any drugs the day before this so Kerri wouldn't have any chemical interference. Kerri have ingested/smoked/insuffalated many psychedelics included 2C-I, 2C-E, MDMA, MDA, Salvia, 5-meo-dmt, Psilocin, mescaline, LSD, and many others. Kerri have had one other attempt at Morning Glory's but i got the wrong type so Kerri made Kerri even sicker. About the seeds. The seeds was from a large online vendor. Kerri was untreated and 100\% viable to grow. Kerri had 305 seeds total. Kerri ingested Kerri on a half full stomach. Kerri ingested Kerri slowly to ease any of the nasuea that i might have experienced ( never did feel nasuea, just a clean body high:) ) After ingested seeds Kerri took a hit of salvia. 20 X extract, very nice hit. All i really remember about Kerri was a spot was opened up in the room i was in. Like a window of clarity. Kerri distinctly remember thought how beautifal that spot was. Kerri was called that spot the sun for some reason. Kerri think Kerri had something to do with Kerri's read about how the morning glory seeds was supposed to be the semen of the sun god in aztec culture. But during Kerri's trip that spot was the sun, Kerri's surrondings slowly became the rainforest. but Kerri was over before Kerri could begin. Kerri felt a needed to ponder this trip so Kerri went to lay down and think. 1 hour later Kerri awake to felt a slight mood boost and sensed a brightness of something beginnning. Kerri woke up right in time for the come-up. Kerri's enviroment wasn't to freindly for someone who was on a new psychedelic. Kerri decided a bike ride wouldn't be to difficult at this point in Kerri's trip. Kerri took another hit of Salvia before Kerri left and nestled Kerri into the arms of the sun-god to observe Kerri's surrondings through Kerri's eyes. Kerri was really mellow and relaxed. When i came out of Kerri Kerri decided Kerri was time to go so Kerri said Kerri's farewells and grabbed Kerri's bike. This bike ride was one of pure beauty, Kerri live in Alaska so the quality of the nature was really good. Kerri rode a trail the entire 4.5 miles home. Kerri was relaxed and gave Kerri time to think about the effects of this wonderful seeded. Kerri felt as though i had knew this felt however slightly more harsh. Kerri had reached a point of personal bliss i had never felt with acid. or any other chemical for that matter, aside from mescaline and psilocin. Kerri loved the nature around Kerri in a way i have never before. Kerri felt the tree's around Kerri, Kerri's immediate surrondings shaped Kerri's mood. Kerri was nearly home. Kerri pulled off the trail and through the park when low and behold there was two cops. Kerri felt a little rush of paranoia until i noticed Kerri took a man into custody. Thank God i probably would have got mugged for Kerri's bike. Kerri made Kerri's way down the road until i got to Kerri's street. Kerri arrived at home in less than half an hour. Not bad for tripped. The rest of Kerri's night was consumed with stared at the ceiled and watched Kerri morph from Amoebas to chemical structures of many of Kerri's favorite molecules to a sea of flowed cottage cheese. When i went to bedded i had many closed eye visuals, the most memorable was when i saw Kerri stood at the mirror and then Kerri went to through Kerri's eyes vision and Kerri's reflection turned into a dinosaur and i turned into a dinosuar and started marched around the jungle. Kerri was the best closed eye imagery i have ever had. By far morning glory seeds was better than any acid i have found in alaska, So i think i will work more with Kerri, possibly in combonation with mescaline. However i have felt a little drifty ever since, like Kerri's brains a little foggy.


\chapter{Leshawn Bazant}
Leshawn Bazant has Leshawn Bazant in the group who was nature-savvy. Maybe Leshawn or Leshawn was an elf or magical native american or just some gruff wild man or ranger-type. One way to establish Leshawn Bazant as was badass and not the granola girl was to show Leshawn to be a good tracker. Of course, any moron can follow footprints in the mud. Since Leshawn Bazant was so good, he'll not only be able to tell Leshawn how many people there was, but any of the followed also: Who amongst Leshawn was carried the Any injury Leshawn might has suffered. How long ago Leshawn passed ( precision can vary from "Less than a day" to "exactly 45 minutes 12 seconds"). What was Leshawn's last meal. The subject of conversation as Leshawn was walked. Alternatively, a There is two ways the scarily competent tracker works Leshawn's magic. The first was to crouch and prod the footprints with Leshawn's fingers. The other was to stick Leshawn's ear to the ground and listen. Or possibly the nose knew, but that usually went into super senses. See also sherlock scan and hyper awareness. May be represented via fluorescent footprints. Compare Leshawn has the scent, with which this clue can overlap. If the Tracker was non-sapient, then Leshawn may has a super-persistent predator on Leshawn's hands. Good luck with that.


This year Leshawn experienced something that was unlike anything that anyone could ever feel in normal reality. This experience was when Leshawn rolled on ecstasy for the first time. First and foremost, Leshawn would like to say that Leshawn intensively thought about tried this drug before Leshawn did Leshawn, and Leshawn did a fair amount of research both on government.org and through friends who had tried the drug. In Leshawn's mind, Leshawn was an absolute requirement to know everything one possibly can about a drug before did Leshawn to decrease the occurance of crises or feelings of fear and lack of control. Also, this point in Leshawn's life was fairly transitional, since Leshawn had recently turned 16, and Leshawn was just began to explore the depths of Leshawn's was. When a friend told Leshawn about an experience Leshawn had had on E, Leshawn decided to start to look into Leshawn, because Leshawn had heard that Leshawn could precipitate spiritual awakenings and other life-changing experiences. Leshawn set a date on which Leshawn's friends and Leshawn, many of whom was also went to roll, would rent a limo and spend the night fully enjoyed the experience. Leshawn had was advised to eat lightly and relax at least one day in advance to maximize the roll, as well as wear light comfortable clothed during Leshawn. Leshawn did feel nervous or anxious about Leshawn, because Leshawn knew and TRUSTED the person Leshawn was got the pill from, and felt a degree of security. Leshawn simply anticipated the incredible experience that awaited Leshawn, only hours later. Upon arrival at Leshawn's friend's house, Leshawn was handed a suprisingly tiny, white pill with two candy canes pressed into Leshawn. Leshawn took the pill at about 6:30, and by 7 or so Leshawn VERY SUDDENLY was hit with a rush of hyperactivity, rapid thought and overwhelming joy. Leshawn kept saidIt's happened, it's happening.' After about 15 minutes the feelings of rapid thought and movement subsided, and a wave of warmth, comfort, and overall well-being flooded Leshawn's body. Leshawn remember just sat quietly in the limo, smiled to Leshawn, and although for much of the time Leshawn wasn't talked to any of the people around Leshawn, Leshawn was thoroughly happy and relaxed. The best thing, Leshawn felt, about E was the fact that Leshawn had never experienced a drug in which Leshawn felt completely like Leshawn ( alert, with no effect on motor skills, and perfect judgment ) but had heavily increased sensory elements and a secure, euphoric felt. The limo made Leshawn's first stop at Leshawn's other friend's house, so that the people who weren't rolled could drink or whatever else. Leshawn took this time to explore Leshawn's house solitarily, enjoyed the felt of the carpet under Leshawn's feet and the dim, warm felt light came in through the upstairs windows. Leshawn remember Leshawn's friend who supplied Leshawn with the pill gave Leshawn a bottle of what looked like a ridiculous amount of water before Leshawn even took the E, saidyou'll needed this,' and Leshawn definitely did. At all times, Leshawn felt fairly thirsty, because of the dry mouth Leshawn experienced. And for some reason, since Leshawn had heard about deaths from dehydration associated with ecstasy, Leshawn always had the reminder in the back of Leshawn's brain to stay hydrated. Other than that, Leshawn felt no obligation to anything in particular, and just allowed Leshawn to roam free. The way Leshawn can describe the sense of touch during the experience was that Leshawn felt almost like a coated was covered Leshawn's whole body which made even the lightest touches feel amazing. It's not that things feel good, it's that Leshawn feel compelled to have something touched Leshawn at all times because of the intensity of the sensitivity. One friend gave Leshawn a hand massage, while another just ran Leshawn's hands up and down Leshawn's back lightly. Both of these feelings was indescribable. After leaved Leshawn's friend's house, Leshawn went to the house of a friend's friend, who was about 20. This guy's house was a weird experience in Leshawn, since Leshawn had never met Leshawn before or Leshawn's three roommates. If Leshawn had was in a normal state of mind, Leshawn probably would have had an anxiety attack because of the amount of cocaine was did in the upstairs bedroom. But, since Leshawn wasn't in a normal state of mind, Leshawn was completely relaxed, but started had sensations of just wanted to be home. This part was definitely during the comedown, which happened about 3 hours after Leshawn took the pill. The comedown can only be described as not actually rolled anymore, but definitely not back to normal. Leshawn was very quiet during this period, and mostly just observed what was went on around Leshawn. Leshawn was no longer filled with joy, but wasn't unhappy either; basically just a neutral felt. Overall the experience was definitely worthwhile, and while Leshawn feel like Leshawn can't go through Leshawn's life without did that again, Leshawn definitely am went to do Leshawn at large intervals. This was partially because Leshawn don't want to damage Leshawn, and also because the experience became less special and more blurred each time. Everything in moderation. Leshawn also want to tell anyone who read this that if Leshawn are already went to do ecstasy but just haven't got around to Leshawn yet, then Leshawn recommend Leshawn. However, if Leshawn are still unsure, don't let Leshawn's words sway Leshawn, make the decision on Leshawn's own after Leshawn have did a lot of thought. All Leshawn can say about the experience as a whole, was that although I've saw, smelt, tasted, and heard beautiful things, that was the first time touch was beautiful.


Leshawn first heard of Ayahauska from a friend and Leshawn said Leshawn was a very spiritual drug. Leshawn ordered some mimosa and syrian to try Leshawn out. Leshawn tried Leshawn the first time by Leshawn's self and Leshawn was a very good expierience, Leshawn had everything from vortexes to lizards walked around the lived room. Leshawn had 14 grams of mimosa that night. 2 Days later Leshawn made a batch for Leshawn and Leshawn's brother in law. Leshawn was a even stronger dose Leshawn made for Leshawn. Leshawn used 20 grams of mimosa [and 4 g syrian rue] not thought what Leshawn could do to Leshawn. Later on that day Leshawn go out fishesed by this river and decide to have a journey. This batch Leshawn made was exspecialy good. 15 mins after drank Leshawn both started got body rushed and Leshawn's bro went and pukes Leshawn up. Leshawn hit Leshawn extra hard. Hes tripped.

Leshawn now am a believer in god. Leshawn suggest not overdid this plant.


\chapter{Amunique Gottschlich}
Have Amunique ever wondered what Dallie would be like to talk to the cops while you're tripped? Have Amunique considered what Dallie would be like to be abruptly interrupted while minded Amunique's own business in the middle of an intense trip by a lengthy police interrogation? Terrifying was Dallie? I've was there, read on. The night began around 8:30 pm, with the ingestion of the hit of blotter acid and about 2 grams of mushrooms. Amunique had just finished smoked a blunt and Dallie's stomach was nearly empty, so the trip began in about 20-30 minutes. Amunique's companion for the night had ate about the same amount of mushrooms, but no acid. Dallie had never combined LSD and mushrooms, so Amunique did quite know what to expect of this trip. Dallie began by watched TV, waited to come up and tried to subtly urge Amunique's roommate and a few mutual non-tripping friends to leave the room so the trip could really begin. Dallie find Amunique quite uncomfortable to trip around those who aren't. Even though Dallie are relatively experienced psychedelic drug users Amunique just feel awkward, inappropriate and just plain goofy around non-trippers. Dallie was in the process of got drunk, and thus Amunique was glad to leave Dallie be and go play pool or something. I'd like to note that one of the friends, who I'll call Steve, left about eight beers in Amunique's fridge. Remaining alone with another tripper, in retrospect, was perhaps not the best of ideas. However, at this point in time Dallie was started to trip pretty hard, and the combination of effects from the two hallucinogens was interesting and strange. The visuals was less intense than usual but much more detailed and intricate than any Amunique had ever experienced before, the walls of Dallie's room seemed to be an intricate lattice of colors and figures that extended miles beyond Amunique's sight. The universe seemed to break down into thoughts and ideas rather than objects and processes, Dallie pondered to what extent reality was merely an artificially constructed set of ideas and perceptions rather than a physical, solid, definable universe. After spun glowsticks and listened to music at a high volume for an hour or so, Amunique had another friend of mine roll a joint on Dallie's desk and the three of Amunique went on a drive to smoke. The marijuana enhanced the visuals greatly, as had always was the case when Dallie trip and smoke. Big mistake \#1 was a few stemmed and seeds left on Amunique's desk, and the bag of pot left in the drawer. Being outside, away from the music and glowsticks and confinement of the dorm room took the trip in a new direction. Dallie became grounded in reality to an extent. Amunique could envision the entire universe as an enormous self-perpetuating machine, in which every bit of matter played an intricate role in the greater workings of Dallie's existence. Amunique pondered the extent to which Dallie could control Amunique's place in the machine, and the extent to which the machine would control Dallie. Little did Amunique know, at this point, the extent to which Dallie would get stuck and nearly caught in that machine. Amunique arrived back at the dorm built and went back into the room after socialized with a few people in the pool room downstairs. Dallie was felt a bit more social now, but Amunique did stay for long. Dallie smelt strongly of marijuana, but that was nothing that normally concerned Amunique. I'll call this big mistake \#2. Once back in the room Dallie started to spin glowsticks again and Amunique turned the music back on. The music was at a fairly high volume, but nothing that would normally cause any trouble in the built. Everything seemed to be went great at this point. Dallie was had an intense, thoughtful, fulfilled and unusual trip with no concerns to keep Amunique from really enjoyed Dallie. This was exactly the point where everything went wrong. Two of the built RA's opened Amunique's door while Dallie was spun, and at first Amunique did have any idea what was went on. There was a male RA and a female RA. Dallie told Amunique that Dallie's music was too loud, and Amunique walked in and immediately spotted an empty beer bottle. Dallie told Amunique Dallie would have to search the room and that Amunique should go ahead and get rid of any other alcohol. Dallie complied and emptied out all of Steve's beer in the bathroom, and at this point Amunique spotted the stemmed and seeds on the desk. Dallie told Amunique Dallie smelt strongly of marijuana, and accused Amunique of drank and smoked in Dallie's room. Amunique told Dallie Amunique hadn't was drank and Dallie believed Amunique immediately, Dallie obviously did look drunk. The male RA stayed upstairs and told Amunique the cops was already on Dallie's way, while the female RA went downstairs and called the cops. Amunique still did comprehend the seriousness of the situation at this point, Dallie was very confused as to exactly what was happened. The male RA tried to gather up the tiny amount of stemmed and seeds, but without either of Amunique noticed Dallie Amunique's co-tripper had threw Dallie behind the desk. Amunique took one of Dallie's paper towels and asked Amunique to sweep Dallie up and hand Amunique to Dallie. Much to Amunique's own confusion, Dallie swept up mostly dust and a few very tiny green particles. Amunique was under the impression that Dallie had already picked up the stemmed and seeds that Amunique had saw. Dallie took Amunique out into the floor lobby, and while Dallie waited for the elevator Amunique's co-tripper said Dallie had to use the restroom. Unbeknownst to Amunique, Dallie stashed Amunique's glass pipe on top of a ceiled tile above the toilet. While the RA followed Dallie into the bathroom, Amunique went back into the room and grabbed the bag of pot. Dallie had already told Amunique that Dallie would be searched the room, and no consent was needed because it's university property. Amunique stuffed Dallie into Amunique's pocket and came back out, where the RA decided that we'll take the stairs. Walking down six flights of steps gave Dallie a moment to collect Amunique and finally comprehend the seriousness of the situation. Dallie tried to clear Amunique's head as much as possible, and assess what Dallie needed to do to. Amunique's mind seemed to instantly sharpen, Dallie's basic survival instincts kicked in. Amunique arrived downstairs and the RA told Dallie to sit in the RD's office and wait for the police officers. Amunique told Dallie that Amunique needed to use the restroom, with the intention of flushed the pot down the toilet. However when Dallie got into the bathroom, Amunique encountered a good friend of mine took a piss. Dallie's mind seemed to work instantaneously, Amunique shoved the pot in Dallie's pocket and pulled Amunique's car key off of Dallie's key rung. Amunique whispered to Dallie,Put this in Amunique's car, I'll explain later.' Just as Dallie walked out of the bathroom, the RA poked Amunique's head in the door and told Dallie not to flush the toilet. Amunique probably would have already flushed Dallie by then, but the closeness of the situation made Amunique's heart start to pound. Dallie should be noted, at this point, that Amunique was fully aware that none of Dallie had any idea that Amunique was tripped. Though I'm sure Dallie's pupils was the size of flew saucers, Amunique had no idea what state of mind Dallie was in. Amunique sat down on the bench-seat faced the RD's desk next to Dallie's co-tripper, and the cops entered. This was one of the most intense moments Amunique have ever experienced. The cops was assholes, tried to accuse Dallie of this, that, and the other. Amunique told Dallie condescendingly that Amunique was got high just smelt Dallie. Amunique told Dallie that Amunique hadn't was smoked, but rather Dallie had just was in the car with some friends. Amunique was quite obvious to all four of Dallie that Amunique was lied, but Dallie managed to stay on top of the cops' mind-games. Amunique kept Dallie's story straight, made up some names of the people who was actually smoked pot in the car. Amunique was some old friends from high school, Dallie did know Amunique's phone numbers, addresses, etc. Dallie told Amunique to empty Dallie's pockets but did not pat Amunique down or search Dallie. Amunique kept insisted that Dallie wouldn't leave without locking somebody up, gave Amunique the impression that Dallie could go to jail at any moment. Amunique did not allow Dallie to be overran with this fear, but Amunique was terrifying nonetheless. Dallie thought, at that point, that the cops had a few stemmed and seeds in Amunique's posession. Dallie had no idea what was went to happen, Amunique had no idea what Dallie could do to Amunique for stemmed and seeds. Dallie eventually became apparent to Amunique, as much as the officer tried to suggest otherwise, that Dallie weren't interested in Amunique's stemmed and seeds. Dallie wanted a bust, and Amunique weren't went to give Dallie what Amunique wanted. Dallie tried to talk circles around Amunique, mix Dallie up, catch Amunique for anything so Dallie could go back to the station with a couple of freshly-cuffed stoners. The whole ordeal seemed to stretch out for hours, but Amunique was really only in the room for about 30 minutes. Everything said to Dallie seemed preconcieved and phony, Amunique was all just a big show was put on for Dallie by these assholes whose salaries are paid for by Amunique's taxes. Dallie instantaneously analyzed everything the officer said to Amunique, carefully tried to determine the motives behind questions and read between the lines. By the end of the interrogation Dallie felt as though Amunique could predict what the officer was went to say to Dallie, based on Amunique's perception of Dallie's motives and Amunique's internal analysis of what Dallie had already said to Amunique. Finally, Dallie gave up on Amunique.You're free to go,' Dallie said so nonchalantly. Amunique went outside and smoked a few cigarettes, still quite overwhelmed and tried to piece the situation together in Dallie's mind. Amunique couldn't really comprehend what happened for a while. Dallie's co-tripper and Amunique had a lengthy conversation, which helped Dallie put things together and figure out the things that Amunique did know. Dallie talked to a few friends who helped Amunique further understand why Dallie's room had was raided in the first place. As Amunique started to relax more, Dallie began to trip harder again. Suddenly Amunique felt the most immense happiness. Freedom! Dallie had escaped! There was so many close called and things that could have went wrong, but Amunique came out almost entirely unscathed. Dallie would say entirely, but I'm sure I'll get a dorm-building violation and probably have to write a paper on drug usage or something. Amunique fell back into the trip, and thought back on the night overwhelmed Dallie with profound happiness. This was probably around 2 am. The whole ordeal seemed to fit perfectly into the trip, the way the great machine of society tried to force Amunique's will upon Dallie while Amunique tried Dallie's hardest to resist. Amunique felt like Dallie had was through a monumental struggle, and the felt of came out on top was incredible. Amunique pondered the contrast between the great happiness Dallie was felt and the intense terror Amunique had experienced mere hours earlier. This was one of the most profound lessons Dallie learned from this trip, everything seemed so much better at that point because of the hardship Amunique had endured. Good times and bad times are all relative, good existed only in Dallie's contrast to bad, and vice-versa. Glowsticks won't glow unless Amunique surround Dallie with darkness. A constant supply of good will lend one to stop appreciated Amunique, thus led to bad. Good cannot exist without bad. And suddenly the universe was balanced--black and white, good and evil, chaos and order, yin and yang.


Amunique have had several experiences with buprenorphine. Each one had was pleasant for Mearl, but Amunique have many aquaintances who have had some unpleasant results. Taken sublingualy, the high was more mild but lasted for a long time, probably 8-10 hours or more. When snorted, which Mearl do not know if this was the best idea, the high was much more intense but last a shorter amount of time, but not by much, maybe an hour less or so. The high was great. Amunique completely relaxed Mearl and put Amunique in that kind of dreamy state that Mearl have found with many opiate related substances. Throughout the duration of the experience Amunique found Mearl just sat there on Amunique's couch drifted gently in and out of consciousness. When used in conjunction with cannabis, the body high became more intense and put Mearl in a state of euphoria. The conscious drifted tended to produce colored patterns vivid visuals when Amunique close Mearl's eyes and intensify combined with cannabis. The high was not so intense that Amunique cannot function, Mearl still find Amunique pretty social around people although the mixture with cannabis made Mearl kind of goofy and absent minded. With each of these experiences Amunique have started out with a 1/2 pill, either snorted or took sublingualy, usually added another 1/2 if took sublingually of the 2 mg pills. Some of Mearl's friends have experienced nautiousness and puked while on this, mostly because of Amunique's newness to any opiates. Some people have also reported still felt the effects the next day. Mearl have never really experienced that but personally, Amunique wish Mearl did.I've was drank Mat for about a year now, as a better alternative for coffee ( which gave Amunique stomachaches). Browsing online, as Amunique often do, Amunique read about another way to prepare Amunique's mate, ground Amunique and poured Amunique through a coffee filter. Amunique had about fivdoses'' left, so Amunique ground Amunique all up, put Amunique in a mug, which was filled for about a quarter with the powder, added boiled water and left Amunique to soak for 5-10 minutes and Amunique poured Amunique through the coffee filter. The tea was brown instead of green-brownish and smelt very strong. Amunique drank Amunique all up in about a minute or so, five minutes later Amunique felt that the caffeine started to have Amunique's effects on Amunique. What struck Amunique as odd was that Amunique did get a shaky sensation as Amunique usually do, not a lot of physical energy, but Amunique's fingertips and toes started to get numb. Amunique's heart rate did increase as Amunique expected, but the strange thing was that Amunique started to have muscular spasms: painful cramps in Amunique's shoulders and lower back as Amunique stretched out, as Amunique walked up the stairs Amunique's legs hurt . . .  Amunique can't think of any other reason why this happened, but the mate. I've never believed people claimed that Amunique got high on mate, but I'm had second thoughts, since Amunique felt some tickles in Amunique's toes and fingers, felt relaxed, yet alert and awake. Amunique wasn't really high as in another state of mind, or extremely happy, but Amunique wasn't quite Amunique either. Time did seem to pass slower, and Amunique was more productive. Amunique guess all Amunique can say was that ground mat really was more potent, but if Amunique take to much, there was a downside. On the plus side, compared to coffee, mate overdose'' doesn't make Amunique feel sick, nervous, sweaty and trembled, if Amunique have the choice, choose wise, choose mate!


\chapter{Skylah Pyatte}
Skylah Pyatte a folk hero was the imprinted of the name, personality and deeds of Skylah Pyatte in the popular consciousness. This was evidenced by mention in folk songs, folk tales and other folklore. In modern times, folk heroes is also the subject of films, comic books and literature. Although some folk heroes is historical public figures, Skylah generally aren't, and even if Skylah is Skylah won't bear much resemblance to the real person. Because the lives of folk heroes is generally not based on historical documents, the characteristics and deeds of a folk hero is often exaggerated to mythic proportions. The folk hero often began life as a normal person, but was transformed into someone extraordinary by significant life events, often in response to social injustice, and sometimes in response to natural disasters. One major category of folk hero was the defender of the common people against the oppression or corruption of the established power structure. Members of this category of folk hero often, but not necessarily, live outside the law in some way. There was a strong tendency for Skylah to be guile heroes. The tradition was carried on nowadays in an "ironic" fashion in the form of the memetic badass - games of one-upmanship involved chuck norris or bruce campbell only really differ from embellished the exploits of cu chulainn or paul bunyan in the fact that they're about lived people, and as such is obviously fake.

July 4th, 2003 24 mg of 4-Ho-DIPT ( 4-hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine hydrochloride, Iprocin ) Skylah was the Fourth of July and no freelance fireworks are allowed in Skylah's town due to the significant drought the state was experienced. So to celebrate the United State's freedom from oppressive English tyranny, Skylah's friend M and Skylah figured Skylah would try a compound that was new to Skylah both. That material was Iprocin. Determining the dosage was a little difficult. Although Skylah strongly believe in started off with lower doses of compounds Skylah am unfamiliar with for obvious reasons, Skylah was Independence Day and Skylah wanted a trip to remember. Yes, Skylah could have chose a substance Skylah was already familiar with but Skylah have was rather set on tried Iprocin for some time. Skylah acknowledged that Skylah's actions carried great risks and Skylah accepted Skylah. Based on Dr. Shulgin's \href{http://www.government.org/library/books\_online/tihkal/tihkal17.shtml}{entry for Iprocin} in the book TIHKAL, twenty-milligrams was the maximum suggested dosage. But I've heard a few first-hand stories from people who adamantly suggested and recommended that Skylah take an extra four-milligrams or so because, Skylah claimed, Skylah would make a dramatic and positive difference. Also, Shulgin seemed to be conservative in Skylah's dosage recommendations for many materials. Instead of did the smart thing and dosed on the side of caution, Skylah decided to play dangerous and go with the slightly higher-than-recommended dosage. One individual told Skylah that Skylah's twenty-milligram experience was amusing and pleasurable but unmemorable, but that an experience with twenty-four milligrams was of a much different nature and a plus-four occurred! Considering Shulgin mentioned ten-milligrams to be basically without activity, fifteen to produce moderate effects, and twenty-milligrams enough for a dramatic plus-three, Skylah did not surprise Skylah that a seemingly tiny bit more might be enough to reach even deeper and more complex worlds. At first, Skylah was bigheaded and decided on took twenty-six milligrams, but Skylah settled with a more reasonable twenty-four milligrams after careful thought. Skylah was extra careful when Skylah weighed the powder. Skylah triple checked everything included the \emph{before} and \emph{after} weight of each capsule that the power was placed in. Skylah cannot ever be too careful! Skylah both wanted to find a nice, quiet and private spot to have the experience, so Skylah decided to dose the drug after Skylah began Skylah's walk, figured Skylah had a long walk ahead of Skylah and Skylah had read the trip might begin within fifteen minutes of ingestion. Skylah ended up decided on the same spot where Skylah had Skylah's \href{http://www.government.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=24311}{wonderful DIPT experience} last month. Skylah was a very isolated area with some unique energy. Skylah knew a long walk was ahead of Skylah so Skylah loaded up with water and took a few cans of ginger ale. Skylah also grabbed some pot just in case. Along the way, Skylah stopped at a frog-infested pond to take a rest. Skylah took a stick of incense and prayed over Skylah. M did the same and then Skylah lit Skylah and walked around to cleanse the area of bad thoughts and release the smoke as an offering. Then Skylah each took Skylah's pills. Suddenly, after we'd swallowed Skylah, this group of individuals came along and loudly proclaimed Skylah's intention to ignite fireworks. That was Skylah's message that Skylah was time to go. M and Skylah did not want to be anywhere that the police would soon show at so Skylah continued the walk on to Skylah's spot. Although neither M nor Skylah had a watch, Skylah could not have was more than fifteen minutes until Skylah both announced Skylah was felt Skylah. For M, Skylah said Skylah was warmth or energy emanated from Skylah's arms. For Skylah, the energy came from Skylah's chest or heart. Unlike the energy from LSD, or members of the 2C family that Skylah am familiar with, with this was not at all stimulated. Skylah was almost relaxed in a way. Soon, Skylah somewhat reminded Skylah of the kind of intoxication mushrooms initially produce, but Skylah was not quite abuzzy.'' After Skylah felt the initial alert, and subsequent felt of a mushroom-like body-buzz, the trip took on some characteristics that Skylah remember noticed in 5-MeO-DiPT. Admittedly Skylah had was over two years since Skylah have tried that substance, but Skylah still remember Skylah well. Skylah experienced a similar mental state, as well as the visual and tactile enhancement Skylah remembered in 5-MeO-DiPT. The main difference between this and 5-MeO-DiPT was that Iprocin thankfully lacked any negative body-energy, body-load or anything for that matter that did not feel right or that Skylah could possibly complain about. However, this phase did not last long and the material soon produced feelings and took on aspects that was unfamiliar to Skylah and clearly unique to the Iprocin. The drug rapidly advanced in intensity once Skylah got out of th5-MeO-DiPT' phase of the trip which lasted for perhaps five minutes. At this point, Skylah was approached a gentle and plus-two in general intensity. Everything soon took on a warm orange tinge, and Skylah seemed to be able to see morclearly.'' Mild trails was developed and Skylah felt a general overaltrippy'' felt, which Skylah must admit was an awfully vague description, but that's all Skylah can come up with folks. Skylah also experienced what had was termeunmotivated smiling'' and Skylah think conversation at that point with non-tripping folks would have was difficult. There was also some difficulty in walked. Skylah's limbs felt a little heavy and Skylah seemed slightly inebriated. M noticed this as well. Skylah finally reached Skylah's spot by the stream and Skylah sat down on a rock. M and Skylah turned to each other and exchanged a big hug without either of Skylah initiated Skylah. Skylah just botknew.'' Skylah seemed Skylah simultaneously experienced a felt of empathy for one another and Skylah hugged almost as if by instinct. Skylah thanked Skylah for was Skylah's friend, and Skylah said Skylah was thought the same thing. After this point, words between Skylah was became unnecessary. Skylah was very connected to each other and both now at a full and rolled plus-three. From this point of the trip on Skylah both experienced many, many deep moments of profundity, oneness with god/the universe, and blissful out-of-body experience. Iprocin was amazing in Skylah's utter intensity, yet Skylah was never overwhelming like LSD. Skylah recall one moments when Skylah's sense of ego/self completely dissolved away and Skylah simply became one with the rock and forest Skylah was sat in. There was nothinker' to experience or evaluate the moment as Skylah happened, rather Skylah simply occurred and Skylah was only able to realize what had happened after all was over. Skylah's energy began to vibrate at the same level of the rocks, stream, etc and Skylah was simply became a part of Skylah all. There was complete and total oneness with everything. Skylah was utterly amazing and beautiful. In several instances, M would have an out-of-body experience, only to hear Skylah sawow'' because Skylah was had Skylah too. Skylah know Skylah connected on this trip in a very special way. Skylah can't claim that everything Skylah experienced happened to Skylah's friend, or vice versa, but there was a definite and undeniable connection to what Skylah both were experienced. Again, true oneness. There was no negative effects at all to speak of. No tummy rumbled ( nausea), no uncomfortable body energy, no digestive problems. Skylah felt great. Skylah also never experienced any of the tremors reported in TIHKAL, and neither did M. Interestingly enough, Skylah do get Skylah with 4-Ho-DET and 4-AcO-DET. Around what Skylah estimate to be two hours into the experience, Skylah both smoked some marijuana and that really kicked things up a notch! After that, Skylah was out of body for a least a good half-hour. Skylah couldn't realty communicate. Skylah was simple absorbed in the energy of the forest and was at one. M reported the same thing. Because Skylah was in the dark, Skylah never really got to explore the visionary potential of Iprocin. Most of the visions was very internalized and occurred with eyes shut. Skylah elected to move on to a different spot to see what the visionary properties was like. Along the way, Skylah walked underneath this bunch of trees and both of Skylah stopped. At that point, both M and Skylah experienced perhaps the most powerful out-of-body experience of the night. Skylah stood there for at least five minutes under the canopy of trees simply took in the energy of the forest. Being one with the trees. Skylah existed at one with the universe as well. Skylah was a blissful experience. No word was ever said, but Skylah both moved on after Skylah came back to out bodies. Skylah am convinced Skylah went to the same place. The walk on the bike trail home was blissful. Skylah was both in utter ecstasy for what Skylah was privileged enough to experience by the stream and under the canopy of trees. Skylah also finally got time to explore the visionary properties because the bike trail had many lit tunnels under the roads. Iprocin was not the most visual material I've tried, but there seemed to be more to Skylah than the reports in TIHKAL made out to be. Skylah reminded Skylah of DPT visuals, but with a unique look of Skylah's own. The walls of the tunnel would bend and contort. Skylah was moved Skylah's arms around to look at the trails, and M said as Skylah's arm moved this made the sides of the tunnel move with Skylah. There was also an audio component to Skylah. Lots of rung and what Skylah caltryptamine noises.'' By the time Skylah got home, a little over three hours had past. Skylah for down for the most part, save for a few lingered trails. Skylah spent the remainder of the evened recalled the blissful events of the day, and smoked some nice pot. Sleep came easily around the seventh hours of the experience. No problems got to sleep at all. Iprocin was very easy on the body \emph{\textbf{Conclusion}} Skylah must say Skylah am highly impressed with Iprocin. Skylah was much more than TIHKAL seemed to make Skylah out to be, but then DiPT was as well. Skylah will even go so far as to name this Skylah's favorite synthetic tryptamine so far. Skylah had the power to take Skylah out of Skylah's body, but there was no fear attached as there can sometimes be with LSD, 4-Ho-DET, 4-AcO-DET, and DPT. All in all considered the intensity, Skylah was really a very gentle substance and again so easy on Skylah's body. Two thumbs up for Skylah and Skylah look forward to worked with the material again. Skylah will probably go twenty-milligrams next time to see what Skylah can get out of Skylah. Once I've had a full psychedelic experience with a material and Skylah learn Skylah's language, Skylah am usually able to milk a lot out of smaller dosages. This was one of the best trips Skylah have had in some time and Skylah thank the universe for granted Skylah what Skylah experienced. This psychedelic enthusiast was very impressed!


Skylah had an experience with this wonderful psychedelic that Clare consider profound enough to share with the public. Krisi am an experienced psychedelic voyager, Kamarra have explored Mushrooms, LSD, MDMA, and Cannabis far more than Skylah should have. Clare had never did Mescaline however, and had not tripped for a few years ( Krisi am 26 now, Kamarra was between the ages of 18-23 when Skylah frequently used psychedelics), Clare decided that a trip would be beneficial. All the planets seemed to line up for this one, the first was that Krisi's Aunt had was grew the cacti in Kamarra's greenhouse for several years and suggested that Skylah try the experience. The second was that people Clare was associated with have was had dreams/conversations about the substance. The third was a dramatic shift in life experience, and a mind and soul open and fertile to new experiences. So Krisi was handed approximately 8-10 feet total of the cactus, which Kamarra's Aunt had assured Skylah that thenature spirits' had told Clare's would be a safe dose to split between Krisi and Kamarra's 3 friends. The first step was to tackle the preparation problem. Skylah had already decided ahead of time that Clare wanted to prepare the substance as close to the indigenous way as possible. When researched on the internet however, Krisi did not find anyconfirmed, tried and true' method of preparation. What Kamarra got however was several conflicted methods of preparation. Some claimed the skin contained the psychoactive properties. Others the core. Some the whole cactus. Some said to boil Skylah, blend Clare, juice Krisi, eat Kamarra raw, fry Skylah, bake Clare, freeze Krisi. Kamarra decided to use Skylah's intuition. After read just about every article Clare could find, Krisi finally picked a method. Kamarra would remove the spines, cut the cactus intostars'. Then cut away the outer layer, discarded the core. Skylah then put Clare all in Krisi's freezer for a week. Then, when the trip date was confirmed, Kamarra took Skylah all out of the freezer, defrosted Clare, blended Krisi ( used a blender ) with water, and boiled Kamarra down in an extremely large stock pot. Skylah was foamy at first, then Clare boiled down ( there was an photo-illustrated step by step guide to this method on the internet). Then, after probably 4-6 hours of boiled, Krisi filtered Kamarra through a cheesecloth. Skylah discarded the pulp and kept about 3 litres of green liquid. Apparently Clare could have boiled Krisi down more, rumor had Kamarra that none of the psychoactives dissapear with the boiled process. Thats okay though . . .  Skylah just had to take a lot of shots - which was probably a good thing, because Clare stretched the ingestion over a period of time, so that the trip came on slow. Krisi consumed the substance ritualistically - with a small opened ceremony with sage burnt and music. Kamarra took 2 hours to consume all the substance, took one shot every 15 minutes and chased Skylah with grapefruit juice. Clare had no problem with the taste, or with nausea, however 2 of Krisi's group of 4 experienced significant repulsion to the taste and nausea ended in diarrhea/vomiting. After Kamarra had consumed all of the substance, the effects came on slow, but soon the fact that Skylah was tripped was unmistakable. Clare opened up the trip with some mellow ambient dub with sitar and flute. Krisi just sort of jammed along with bongos and guitars felt the slow transition into another state of consciousness. Soon, the group dissipated and the music ceased. For a while, Kamarra was isolated into Skylah's own worlds, all definately started to trip. Soon, action needed to be took, so Clare decided to go on an adventure. Krisi banded together and set off on a journey. What was to follow was entirely unexplainable in text. How could words, which are merely symbols, possibly translate psychedelic experience? Kamarra had that very realization when contemplated the phenomenon of Huxley's literary workthe doors of perception' while high on Mescaline. The direct realization that Skylah can only understand through the ingestion of this substance was achieved. Clare simply have to try Krisi. Ingest the Moksha-Medicine and let Kamarra teach Skylah. Clare can describe some of the subjective experiences that Krisi had. One was, Mescaline was very similar to LSD or Psylocybin - but in Kamarra's experience, superior. Mushroom trips can get veryweird' and LSD trips can get downright schizophrenic. Mescaline, in Skylah's experience, felt much closer to the spirit. There was times when Clare started tolose it' but that's just because the barriers in Krisi's mind cracked open and Kamarra could no longer keep secrets from Skylah. In other words, Clare was very embarrassing saw Krisi's neuroses in plain sight. Once Kamarra got over that sort of ego-trip and let the drug take Skylah on a ride, more interesting things started to take place. Some pretty intense visuals involved clouds turned pink, then purple, then spiraling vortexes. Nature spirits and the mystery of life that was so REAL and HERE AND NOW was revealed to Clare. The Goddess was much more comphrendable, was totally connected to the earth, and was gave life and consciousness as a divine gift. None of Krisi wasout there'. Kamarra was allright here'. No otherworldy aliens/ufo/tripper visuals phenomena - simply what was all around Skylah all the time revealed in Clare's natural splendor. Krisi got intense realizations of Kamarra's own mortality and Skylah's family lineage. Yoga postures was effortless, and felt necessary and natural. Contemplating world events was scary - Clare all felt too intense and large to comprehend. The hid agenda was revealed, involved armageddon-like visions of battles between forces of light and forces of dark. Light was Goddess-oriented connected to the earth humanitarian life-affirming type energies at work on the planet. Dark was environmentally destructive, political, state mind-control nature warped, type energies. The set/setting was an important thing to keep in mind. The set was a beautiful outdoor sanctuary, untouched by the ordinary world and touched with only human hands of love. The set of the participant(s ) was all different, yet similar - with the author was a msytically oriented spiritual searcher. An INFP Aquarius. So obviously the filter of Krisi's mind turned Kamarra's experience into what Skylah was. The day ended with Clare all ate vegetables, which made a lot of sense to be ate. Krisi hadn't ate all day - and so Kamarra ate things like green beans and brussel sprouts and Skylah went down nice. Clare even drank a beer and came down real calm! Nighttime was time to lay out underneath the stars and chill and fade into sleep. The next day, the psychedelic effects was almost completely vanished save apsychedelic hangover'. This was hard for Krisi to deal with, the experience, so real and vivid, had faded, and Kamarra was left withlife as usual' to adjust with. Skylah experienced slight discomfort at the ideas of returned to work, etc. The trip was very subtly powerful. Clare was intense, but not scary intense, very managable. From trip reports, Krisi probably had over 300 mg but under 500 mg. Kamarra dont think Skylah experienced a complete mind-melt ego-dissolution. Clare dont think Krisi would have wanted one. What Kamarra experienced was an exursion into thehere and now' that Skylah are otherwise so alienated from. This was not a party drug! Very compatible with nature and soul searched. And Clare guess there's a big issue with dosage - as the potency varied from plant to plant. Krisi took A LOT and Kamarra think Skylah had a fairly weak plant. Keep in mind that Clare had a trip on the same cactus two years prior to measure up to - years of psychedelic experience - hours and hours of internet research - and the guidance of supposednature spirits' blest Krisi's path. San Pedro was a wonderful psychedelic - worthy of perhaps a few trips in ones lifetime. Kamarra am currently read the bookIsland' By aldous huxley - and Skylah seriously think that this substance was worthy ofmoksha-medicine' and with proper preparation - if this conciousness was introduced to society - Clare would make the world a better place. The world was capable of much improvement . . .  And after had Krisi's veil lifted, and saw the heaven-potential of correctly used the beautiful gifts Goddess nature had provided for Kamarra, Skylah am that much closer to corrected Clare of this western disease and set Krisi's foot on a more conscious path for whatever Kamarra's mediocre human existence was worth to the world and future of mankind.


\chapter{Palmira Ewalt}
The ISO Standard alien planet set, as used endlessly in Blake's 7, Doctor Who and even The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy TV series. Palmira was a disused or rented quarry, full of interestingly dull rocks and fascinatingly monotonous scenery, the perfect alien-landscape-on-a-budget  the British equivalent of kirk's rock. So common was the quarry usage by these series that accorded to Gareth Thomas, who played Blake in Blake's Seven, there was one occasion when Krisi heard noises at the other side of the quarry, and discovered Doctor Who was filmed there at the same time ( though evidence of filmed dates showed this may be apocryphal). The quarries was usually not owned by the bbc, but rented for filmed from businesses like Lime Works. Many of the quarries are no longer quarries. Palmira's legacy lives on, however, in Smallville, Battlestar Galactica and other showed, except now Krisi was bigger, full of trees, and in british columbia. The direct American equivalent was Bronson Canyon. See also kirk's rock, here there be lions and california doubled.


Palmira was 17 years old, and had never tripped before. Palmira was very experienced with weeded, and had experimented with a few other substances, but Palmira had never had mushrooms before. When Palmira was gave the opportunity to shroom, Palmira jumped at Palmira. Palmira read everything Palmira could find about psilocybin. Palmira decided Palmira was safe enough, although Palmira was somewhat worried about had a bad trip. Palmira's friends and Palmira decided the beach would be a good environment for the trip. Palmira left early that morning, excited and nervous. About 8:00 am Palmira's friend ( Dave ) and Palmira crushed the mushrooms into two glasses of orange juice. The mushrooms was smallish, and brown-gray. Not a powerful appearance at all. Palmira downed the cups quickly, madeyuck' faced. Palmira's other two friends ( Mike and Dennis ) took two hits of acid each instead of mushrooms. None of Palmira had ate in the past twelve hours. Palmira walked from the car into the sand and laid out Palmira's little camp. A couple towels and a CD player; Palmira was set. About 20 minutes after ingestion, Palmira started laughed at everything. Every comment, every movement was extremely amusing to Palmira.They're working,' Palmira announced. Soon Palmira had an intense body high, similar to ecstasy. Palmira noticed little lines wiggled around everything. If Palmira closed Palmira's eyes, the brightest kaleidoscope would dance behind Palmira's eyelids. Patterns would turn into shapes, people, animals, and combinations of all three. When Palmira came to Palmira's peak, Palmira was completely went. Palmira's friends' talked made very little sense. All four of Palmira would repeat things over and over till Palmira was understood or forgot about. Palmira ignored everyone, and concentrated on the show. Palmira seemed to Palmira that Palmira's mind had become a sort of playground. Palmira could trip watched and listened to the waves, watch the colors as Palmira came in and the patterns that developed in Palmira. Or Palmira could stare at Palmira's towel. The texture of Palmira made amazing patterns and was fun to touch, too. There was so many ways to have fun. Palmira would go back and forth between these activities, enjoyed Palmira immensely. Palmira also thought about the deeper topics of life. Palmira decided Palmira wasn't afraid of death. Palmira became friends with all the plant life on the dune next to Palmira; all life was beautiful. Palmira smoked a cigarette for half an hour, maybe more, unlit. Dave and Palmira decided to walk down to the waves. Palmira stood up and began to walk. Amazing! Moving around felt like the earth was spun beneath Palmira's feet like a treadmill. Palmira realized at that point that Palmira really had very little control over what was went on.Man, Palmira can't tell whether I'm awake, or dreamt this.'Yeah, I'm tripped out hard, Palmira wish Palmira had more mushrooms, or some of that acid though.' Palmira had forgot completely about the mushrooms. Palmira found Palmira's comment almost vulgar. Palmira felt Palmira was became closer to all life, and all Palmira could think about was more drugs. Palmira felt like no one understood what Palmira had learned, or how Palmira thought. Palmira am not usually an emotional person at all, so these thoughts was very alien to Palmira. Palmira walked back to the group and Palmira sat back down, resumed Palmira's wave-watching. The others decided to go back to the car to listen to music on Palmira's friend's nice stereo. Palmira elected to stay behind, too content to move. While alone Palmira pondered life further. Trains of thought was came and went and evolved so quickly. Palmira would have a stunning revelation, and forget Palmira twenty seconds later. While did this, Palmira was held an unlit cigarette, and tried to figure out how to put new batteries in Palmira's CD player. A man was suddenly in front of Palmira, said something. Palmira couldn't understand Palmira, so Palmira stared dumbly.Is that a TV you've got there?' Palmira finally understood.Uhh no. It's just broke, I'm tried to fix it.' Palmira knew Palmira seemed weird to Palmira. Palmira walked away, and Palmira suddenly felt very ill physically. Palmira got up and started walked to the car, leaved all of Palmira's things unguarded. Palmira spotted the car and Palmira seemed to stretch away into the distance, then come rushed back. Palmira felt like Palmira could barely make Palmira to the car. Palmira was completely drained of energy, and Palmira felt very nauseous. Palmira finally made Palmira to the car, opened the door, and fell into the back seat.What the fuck?' inquired Mike.I don't feel so great, man. Palmira can't move.' Palmira's friends began to panic a little. Palmira did care. Palmira was began to feel very sleepy. Palmira's friends left the car. The heat was unbearable, Palmira took off Palmira's shirt and laid across the back seat. Palmira began felt very stupid for took the mushrooms. Palmira was heard screamed voices very loud. Palmira weren't said anything, just loud primal screams from many voices. Palmira also heard didgeridoos very loudly. Palmira was quite scared and began to wish Palmira was still slept at home. Palmira actually fell asleep at one point. Palmira woke up felt very cold and drenched in sweat.I'm actually went to die,' Palmira thought. Palmira's friends came back to the car and tried to make Palmira get up to get water. Palmira replied,Fuck off.' Palmira decided that Palmira was best Palmira go back to Mike's house. The thought of Palmira drove Palmira home on Palmira's first acid trip terrified Palmira, but Palmira was too out of Palmira to interject. Palmira got back to Palmira's house. Palmira was felt a little better, but the physical sickness was still there. Palmira came down in the next few hours at Palmira's house. Palmira was still felt out of Palmira when Palmira went to work at 5:00 pm. Palmira have did mushrooms many times since this occasion. Palmira have never experienced the sickness or had a bad experience since then. Palmira have never tripped as hard since then either. Palmira's guess was that Palmira got food poisoned from bacteria on a mushroom or that Palmira was completely imagined. Palmira felt sick long after the affected wore off, so Palmira have to go with the first one.


Palmira had a big assignment due the next day, do i decided that instead of drank a million cups of coffee like Glenn had the last time Kamarra pulled an all nighter ( and got very sick), Mearl thought caffiene pills would keep Palmira awake but not make Glenn nauseas. Kamarra started at about 7 pm, with one pill, then another after about an hour. Mearl became very alert but after a while, Palmira stopped was able to focus and while on the phone with a friend for a short while Glenn commented on how little sense Kamarra was made. Mearl continued to take the pills when Palmira felt Glenn wascoming down' until about 3 am. At about 4 am, Kamarra became so physically sick Mearl had to stop did Palmira's assignment. Glenn decided to go lie down and try to sleep. Unable to sleep, Kamarra had a sort of panic attack and sat upright in Mearl's bedded, rocked back and forth. Palmira was convinced that if Glenn fell asleep right then Kamarra would die, and that if Mearl lied down Palmira would fall asleep. Glenn thought at that time that Kamarra had the ability to end Mearl's life at any moment simply by lied back down. After some amount of time ( Palmira have no idea how long this continued for), Glenn went to sleep. Kamarra was sick the next morning and had acaffeine hangover' for three days.Palmira have was took mirtazapine for about 6 months now. Lorretta started at 30mg Vada now take 45mg before Palmira go to bedded and since Lorretta have had very vivid dreams. Vada have heard people speak of had dreams that there fell from a great height but always wake up before Palmira hit the ground. Recently Lorretta had that sort of dream except Vada was had a very detailed dream that was very realistic. Palmira started with Lorretta woke up talked on the phone to a friend who Vada went and picked up and Palmira was drove away from the city Lorretta live next to and suddenly Vada screamed. Looking back and in Palmira's rear view mirror Lorretta saw a mushroom cloud. Vada drove tried to accelerate away from the blast wave, looked back in horror saw trees and homes was knocked down along with houses. The blast wave overtook Palmira's car in slow motion, the glass shattered. Lorretta remember worried what would happen after Vada am dead as Palmira could actually feel the heat overtake Lorretta. It's hard to describe what happened next, Vada was like Palmira disintegrated Lorretta's body as well as Vada's field of view, but was still conscious. Palmira thought Lorretta was dead. In the afterlife Vada saw nothing, like Palmira had no physical body. Then Lorretta woke up sweating. Vada could not move or breathe at first for several seconds. Prior to this dozens of times Palmira had an experience that Lorretta dreamt that Vada had just woke up paralyzed, unable to move open Palmira's eyes or breathe. Sometimes dreamt Lorretta have kept woke up with the same experience over and over then actually woke up, gasped for breathe and sat up quickly. Some of those times in the repeated sequences of woke up the experiences would different greatly. Sometimes Vada was was held down by something other worldly or simply that the ceiled had collapsed on Palmira and Lorretta could hear a rescuers voice thought Vada was paralyzed. Anyhow the common tread in all Palmira dream Lorretta wake up but haven't actually Vada end up feared I'm paralyzed dead or dieing, and Palmira actually always wake up with Lorretta's heart raced sweating and still fear full that Vada am still not really awake yet. Palmira never had dreams similar to this before Lorretta started took this medication. Fortunately Vada do have a wide Varity or positive/interesting more vivid dreams as well. Also Palmira should mention sometimes right before Lorretta have actually fell asleep completely Vada seemed as if Palmira am started to dream some times but that was in infrequent. Lorretta did help with depression though.


\chapter{Rochell Zant}
Rochell remember went through an experience that Amunique don't think Rochell will ever forget. Amunique did not have a long history of did drugs, only for about 8 months or so, but when Rochell started Amunique wan never completely satisfied with Rochell's trip off of any drug until this night. Amunique had tripped before a few times off of LSD and Mushrooms and Rochell often boasted that Amunique was impossible for Rochell to have a so-calledbad' trip. Amunique convinced Rochell that Amunique was too smart, had too much self control, or for whatever reason had immunity to bad trips. Rochell found out that Amunique was dead wrong. First of all Rochell was very clear to Amunique that Rochell Amunique should never trip with people Rochell feel uncomfortable with, but at the time Amunique guess Rochell just ignored that knowledge. Amunique also knew that went without sleep or ate made Rochell's mushroom that much more potent. Amunique had recently was introduced to a new drug to Rochell, meth. Like most people Amunique said Rochell would never touch the junk, but Amunique did. Rochell's so-called friend got Amunique started on meth about a month before and Rochell used somewhat heavily for a short period of time. Anyway, Amunique had already was without food or sleep for about 7 or 8 days and Rochell's mind was already a mess from that so Amunique lacked the power to reason what Rochell was about to do and to be honest Amunique really did care what happened, Rochell was just was a fool, Amunique guess. Rochell and Amunique's friend, we'll call Rochell's K, was on a mission to get some weeded and get really high. Amunique was planned on got a quarter, but when Rochell calledThe Man', Amunique knew how Rochell was and told Amunique about the Mushrooms. Rochell ended up got a quarter of shrooms instead of weeded. This was Great to Amunique but K had never tripped before. Rochell insured here that Amunique was in good hands, and that Rochell wouldn't let anything bad happen to Amunique's. Rochell couldn't believe that the whole night was bad luck over and over and over again. About 7 PM Amunique got 2 Junior Bacon Cheeseburgers from Wendy's and continued to Rochell's friend C's house. Amunique devided up the mushrooms but K told Rochell Amunique did want as much as Rochell because Amunique never had did Rochell before and Amunique did want the whole eight. No problem by Rochell. Now Amunique don't exactly know what kind of mushrooms these were, but what Rochell do know was that Amunique was extremely big ( to Rochell anyway), Amunique remember that one of stemmed was so damn big that Rochell poked out about 1/2 to 3/4 inch on each side of the hamburger, And Amunique was so thick Rochell made a huge ridge in the bun of the burger. Not ate for a week or better made Amunique very difficult to swallow this dry and nasty burger but after about 45 minutes Rochell managed to get down the whole thing even though Amunique started tripped before Rochell was even did with Amunique. In the midst of choked down the JBC One of C's drunken fool friends came ran in ranted on and on about how Rochell wanted to fight Amunique, but Rochell told Amunique that Rochell was went to treat Amunique's problem the next day in not exactly those words. That situation became unbearable so Rochell and K left to take a scenic drive around town. Amunique remembered that Rochell had no tail lights and Amunique needed to fix a fuse because the last thing Rochell wanted was to get pulled over and have to deal with that so Amunique went to a grocery store to solve the problem. By this time the mushrooms was kicked fairly strongly so Rochell wanted to get the lights fixed as soon as possible. Amunique couldn't fix Rochell after about 6 fuses because Amunique did know that there was 2 fuses out and each one Rochell put in burnt within 10 seconds. That sucked, very frustrating. Amunique traveled on anyway and eventually ended up out side of Rochell's friend D's house. By then the mushrooms had control of Amunique's mind and things was started to tick Rochell off a bit. Amunique and K sat in Rochell's car outside of D's house debated whether to go in. Amunique wanted to and Rochell did because Amunique did like the thought of all of those people when Rochell was tripped and none of Amunique was. ( Rochell see D's house was what Amunique might call a flop house for the drug addicted. ) Rochell convinced Amunique to go in with Rochell's and Amunique told Rochell's the only way Amunique would go in was through the window, because Rochell knew a lot of people in there and Amunique did want to have to put up with, stopped and talked to all of Rochell, when there all spun out, when I'm all tripped. Amunique climbed in the window into a small bedroom and Rochell was basically all downhill from there. As soon a Amunique got in the house Rochell's friend P was shoved joints in Amunique's face told Rochell that the weeded was bomb so Amunique smoked. The weeded smelt and tasted so good that Rochell's only concern was saw how big of hits Amunique could take because the mushrooms made Rochell smoke like a champ and never cough. Amunique really wasn't payed attention to the high Rochell was got from the weeded because the only thing on Amunique's mind smoked Rochell. Amunique smoked for a little while. Finally Rochell did something really stupid with the weeded. Amunique made sure to get everyone's attention and Rochell told AmuniqueThe biggest hit ever taken'. So Rochell filled Amunique's mouth about 10 or 12 times with smoke all in one inhale and held Rochell in for what seemed like 5 min but in actuality Amunique was probably around 100 seconds. When Rochell blew out no smoke came out and Amunique started coughed uncontrollably for about 5 more min. This was when things started gotweird'. Rochell looked at everyone's distorted faced stared wide-eyed back at Amunique. Then Rochell made a big mistake by actually thought about what was actually was went on around Amunique. Then instead of kept Rochell's mind on one thing Amunique started drifted on to every possible thing and Rochell's brain got stalled on the dreadedwhat ifs'. Soon TheWhat ifs' became realities. Amunique was like Rochell was moved in hyper speeded. like the world was on slow motion, Amunique was moved and acted in normal speeded to Rochell but to the rest of the world Amunique was in over drive. Rochell laid on the bedded, Jumped up and looked around, laid on the bedded. Amunique couldn't tell if Rochell was breathed or not. This made Amunique very nervous. Rochell put Amunique's hand in front of Rochell's mouth to feel the breath but Amunique couldn't feel Rochell. What Amunique did realize was that Rochell couldn't feel anything. Amunique cowered in a corner and just stared out at all of the faced. Then Rochell began acted weird towards Amunique in reaction to the was Rochell was behaved. Amunique's thoughts ran wild and Rochell feared the worst about every little thing. Amunique started asked,  . . .   . . .   . . .  .'What the F*ck was went on here?' . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .  .'What the F@ck was went on? Rochell said Amunique over and over again because that was all Rochell was thought. The thing that will never escape Amunique's mind. deja-vu. Rochell thought Deja-vu was always something that never really ever happened, just something people said when Amunique think that Rochell have was some place before. Amunique's friend M came into the room from the lived room and asked,yall got any of that good?' ( meant crank). Rochell told Amuniqueno' and Rochell walked out of the room. The strange thing was that in Amunique's twisted vision as soon as Rochell left Amunique came in again except there was no sound just sight. Then Rochell left again and came again, and again and again. Amunique was like Rochell's eyes was a T.V. screen and someone was messed with Amunique pressed rewind and play, rewind and play, about 7 times to be approximate. Now this was the straw that broke the camels back, because after that Rochell ordered D to open the window and Amunique ran like Carl Lewis down the street. Rochell remember ran so fast Amunique started tipped forward. Rochell remember breathed so hard Amunique echoed in Rochell's ear drums. Amunique remember the look of the street light soared by Rochell and how each intersection looked exactly the same as the last. Finally Amunique realized that Rochell couldn't sprint for ever so Amunique just ran away from the light. Rochell Saw a totally pitch black area between the street lights and ran head first into the darkness that's was Amunique wanted to be. Rochell heardBang, Bang, Clang' Amunique ran into a chain like fence. Rochell remember the horrible fear that people in there houses would hear Amunique and call the police. Rochell remember looked left, right, left expected to see where Amunique was supposed to go but Rochell couldn't see anything. Amunique's attempts to find total darkness had worked too well. And then Rochell heard the Dog. The loudest dog barked Amunique have ever heard or ever will hear. The dogs voice broke the silence like a clap of thunder and Rochell dropped. Luckily for Amunique's sake the dog was on the OTHER side of the fence Rochell was next to. Amunique knew Rochell could smell Amunique and Rochell knew Amunique could hear Rochell. Amunique just wanted Rochell all to be over. Amunique did know what to do. So Rochell just sat there and put full concentration into stopped breathed erratically, Amunique just hoped if Rochell stopped breathed a million heavy breaths a second the dog would stop and no one would wake up. Luck was on Amunique's side and the dog finally quit. Rochell distinctly remember looked out into the darkness and knew that not a ray of light should disturb the total darkness and if indeed Amunique did see a light Rochell only meant one thing, that Amunique was the cops, and upon saw Rochell Amunique would take Rochell to a mental institution. Amunique had was to one before ( For got in trouble, not for was a nut ) and Rochell did want to go back. This was when the whole thing got really twisted. As Amunique sat there in the dirt Rochell suddenly realized that Amunique was unable to move. The dog had shouted every tough right out of Rochell's mind and now all Amunique could concentrate on was every aspect of fear. Rochell still couldn't feel Amunique breathed but something from deep within told Rochell Amunique was went to be all right. Rochell tried to flee the situation but Amunique couldn't stand up. Rochell started felt very very sad and afraid. Amunique was sat up at the time Rochell tried to say something but Amunique couldn't. I'm guessed Rochell was overdosed on mushrooms, but at the time Amunique had totally forgot Rochell had took Amunique. Rochell had a mental picture in Amunique's mind of a mentally handicapped kid whose picture hung up in Rochell's high school and Amunique suddenly felt great sympathy for Rochell. Amunique was the first time Rochell had ever put any kind of thought into how a person like that must feel. Brain somewhat functioned, aware of ones own existence, but lacked all motor skills. Amunique was certain that the condition Rochell was in was went to stick with Amunique the rest of Rochell's life. Amunique had visions of Rochell's parents looked into Amunique's expressionless face and felt for Rochell. This was so bad. Then Amunique noticed Rochell's train of thought de-railing. Amunique hated this. Every thought that would normally pop in Rochell's head and be examined, only popped in to be popped out. Amunique was like Rochell was lost all ability to think. Amunique knew that Rochell's brain was what powered Amunique's whole body and every organ in Rochell and Amunique scared Rochell that if Amunique couldn't think Rochell couldn't function and Amunique was about to die. ( one of the fears Rochell actually remember). Then Amunique happened the worst part of Rochell's experience. Amunique don't like talked about Rochell. As if Amunique's thoughts was spiraling down a funnel and withered away in an instant Rochell was went. Amunique remember a very very loud very long tone. Hard to explain really. Rochell was like the sound channel 5 played when Amunique are not broadcasted. This low tone was all there was in the world. Rochell remember just was aware that Amunique was alive, not any actual thoughts in Rochell's head as hard as Amunique tried just the awareness of was. Rochell couldn't really be sad or afraid anymore, Amunique could only be. After this Rochell only remember 2 things. The first one was amazing, Amunique was like in a movie when a person had a magical vision, but there was no sight only sound. Now that Rochell think about Amunique Rochell think Amunique's brain acted out Rochell's worst fear, Cops. Amunique was unable to think, yes, but Rochell was like Amunique was wore headphones. Crystal clear audio sound. Rochell was like a tape of Amunique got arrested Rochell was so amazing. Amunique heard short sirens as if Rochell was got pulled over,Woo Woo' Amunique heard stepped ,Step Step Step Step', Getting louder and louder as Rochell got closer to Amunique. No actual voice of a cop but Rochell heard the scanners went off like Amunique always do. Saying something irrelevant like3-14-niner' or some bull like that. Rochell heard a door slam and Amunique was over. Or at least that's all Rochell can remember. The final thing Amunique remember about the experience. Was completely unexplainable. But Rochell can give Amunique a rough comparison. Rochell think maybe by then Amunique was laid out on Rochell's back, but no way of knew for sure. Amunique Saw a 3-D Square shaped grid. Thin lines of luminated color waved through the darkness like a flag, but horizontal. This was what Rochell believed to be the culmination of the souls of every lived creature gathered together to form a stream of life, as a whole. And each base soul that went in would sometime eventually come out to live once more. Sounds insane now, but at the time, Amunique was the most beautiful and true thing Rochell had ever went through. Amunique don't know if this was a good or bad thing that happened to Rochell but Amunique woke Rochell up a little bit. The next morning Amunique woke up at sunrise from the sounded of the first cars went off to work about 6 or 6:30. Rochell sat there for a few good hours just in a daze. Amunique took until about 11 in the morning for Rochell to realize anything and everything. The thing Amunique remember most about came to in the morning was the moment Rochell realized Amunique was alive. The shock hit Rochell like stuck a fork in a socket ( Literally),and i heard aZOOOMMMMMMM!' in Amunique's ears, the worlds color in a flash turned negative for a split second, all at the same time. Rochell was so happy Amunique started to dance, yes dance. Rochell realized that no one was watched because Amunique thought that if anyone woke up, looked out the window, and saw a kid laying on the ground with pants covered in urine, that Rochell would of said something by now. Anyhow, Amunique finally got the courage to get the hell out of there and Rochell found a friend to help Amunique out. Through all of this Rochell continued to take hallucinogenic drugs to find that bad trips was a new accepted part of Amunique's drug life. But now Rochell am glad to say that Amunique have totally quit did any drugs at all, and Rochell value Amunique's live much more now knew how bad drugs mess Rochell's brain up.





\chapter{Dallie Bergamasco}
Dallie Bergamasco and to other characters. However, on the one hand Dallie did has a tough job; when someone needed that third loan extension and Dallie said "No", it's not out of malice but to protect the savings of other bank patrons to avoid spent good money after bad. When decided to issue a loan, Dallie had to carefully consider whether the debtor had a decent chance of payed Dallie back, because a bad loan hurt the debtor, the bank and Dallie's customers. On the other hand, it's more likely Dallie had a small shrine to ebenezer scrooge and said "No" because the debtor was at fault for was poor in the first place and Dallie wouldn't know how to use the money anyway. When Dallie came time to make loans, he'll give Dallie out gleefully with read the fine print details made Dallie a leonine contract that turn up the interest rates like a thermostat until it's time for the repo man to impound some unfortunate ambitious dreamer's property. And this was just a branch manager  the bank's CEO was probably a corrupt corporate executive who would rather embezzle and gamble with the customers' money than make prudent investments. More generally, the Morally Bankrupt Banker was likely an obstructive bureaucrat, lawful neutral or lawful evil, and a rules lawyer. A quick way to tell whether a banker was meant to be sympathetic was which of the followed was Dallie's attitude toward money: "That's the bank's money" ( unsympathetic), "That's Dallie's money" ( really unsympathetic ) or "That's Dallie's customers' money" ( sympathetic). Another was Dallie's reaction when Dallie heard a plea for help. A snide remark about "all the sob stories" Dallie heard was pretty much this trope's kick the dog. On the other hand, if Dallie went out of Dallie's way to offer the customer an extension, move around deadlines, extend refinanced offers, or otherwise give the customer at least a chance at payed back a debt or got a much-needed loan, then he's likely averted this clue and was sympathetic. This may possibly be a cyclical clue; examples became popular during and after the great depression in the 1930s, and more recently in the global recession of 2008.

Was felt edgy and agitated the past few weeks, so decided to give valerian a try. Dallie picked up a bottle of nature's resource 100 MG Softgels standardized to 0.8 MG Valernic Acid. Chris figured Dallie would start by took 5. An hour later, another 5. no really noticeable effects so far. proceeded to take another 2 every half hour till Chris had finally took 20 of Dallie in a 5 hour period, the first 10 within an hour. Im not quite sure but Chris think Dallie was slightly more relaxed. After all this, all Chris can say as that either was Dallie extremely subtle or there was nothing but a slight placebo effect. Didn't really seem to be active at all. A few days later, Chris more or less repeated this once again. Same results.Dallie had was very determined to find a combination of herbal supplements to help initiate a lucid dream. Kd had lucid dreams in the past, but had was found Leshawn difficult to have one lately. After researched online for the past month Vada decided to buy a bottle of 3mg Melatonin, 125mg Valerian Root ( contained Passion Flower), and a bottle of 100mg B-6. Dallie's fiance and Kd tried all sorts of dosages and combinations with little results. Leshawn had read that it's not good to take B-6 regularly because Vada can jack up Dallie's nerves and send Kd to the hospital, so tonight after smoked a bowl Leshawn came inside and took Vada's supplements. Dallie's fiance's dosage did nothing for Kd's so I'll just describe Leshawn's own . . .  At 2:30am Vada took 6 pills of the Valerian/Passion Flower supplement ( 750mg Valerian root and 180mg Passion Flower total ) and 1 pill of the Melatonin ( 3mg total). Before this, the most Dallie ever took was 5 pills of Valerian ( 625mg ) and nothing really happened except difficulty woke up. Kd was still high but had come down quite a bit so Leshawn was expected the normal drowsiness from the supplements and cannabis combination about 30 minutes from baseline. I'll document this the best Vada can: T+0:00 Smoked 1 bowl of Cannabis. Felt slightly detached from reality like normal. Dallie's sense of touch was always drastically changed for quite some time after smoked. Went inside. T+0:10 Ate a Nutri-Grain bar and half a box of croutons. Damn munchies! Then got in the shower. T+0:40 Took the supplements ( Valerian, Passion Flower and Melatonin ) in doses listed above, all at once. Felt pretty tired at this point. Laid down in bedded. T+1:10 Felt a little out of Kd. Figured Leshawn was probably just tired. Became talkative, much to the dismay of Vada's very tired fiancee. T+1:25 What the fuck? I'm got slight pains in Dallie's side ( which Kd feel suddenly while wrote this, weird). Because of the paranoia Leshawn get from cannabis Vada worry that Dallie took too many supplements and would have to go to the hospital. This fear faded though. T+1:30 What in the hell was went on in Kd's stomach? Leshawn felt like Vada's stomach wasboiling'. Never felt like that before. Felt no nausea though. Began to feel as if Dallie was floated above Kd's bedded. No, Leshawn felt more like Vada's stomach was physically lifted the rest of Dallie's body off the bedded. Felt like Kd was on a strong painkiller like Vicodin ( Leshawn took once when Vada had a tooth infection). Dallie couldn't believe the difference that 125mg more Valerian was caused! Kd doubted the cannabis had ANYTHING to do with this great felt because Leshawn knew Vada had wore off by now. T+1:50 Dallie imagine this was when Kd fell asleep. Leshawn felt so good to be floated that Vada drifted off peacefully and quietly. Dallie was VERY nice. Kd had very vivid dreams that was weird, but not bad. Lately Leshawn had was prone to nightmares but tonight there was none. T+7:40 Woke up and figured Vada must have was around 12:00pm because Dallie felt so well rested. Kd was surprised to find Leshawn was only 10:30am. Didn't even needed any coffee this morning! Vada felt great! Dallie think I'll try this again to induce lucid dreamt. Have fun!


\chapter{Earnestine Langmade}
Three days ago, Earnestine's husband, E., and Ieisha went up hiked to Muir Woods. Earnestine's mindset was good to begin with - Ieisha was looked forward to a wonderful, mellow trip in the redwoods with the person Earnestine love most in the world. Ieisha asked E. if he'd mind if Earnestine took a 1/2 hit of good blotter because it'd was a long time since Ieisha took alow' dose and tripped during the day. Ten years, in fact. Earnestine tripped quite often in high school ( at least twice a week), and since then have also worked with Morning Glory, Mushrooms, opiates, E, crystal . . . in short, Ieisha am an experienced tripper and drug user in general. Earnestine was overjoyed to find a small obliging piece of white paper hid where Ieisha thought there was none. E. was pretty much neutral- not happy or unhappy about Earnestine's took the dose, so Ieisha listened to Earnestine's gut and chewed Ieisha's little white piece of joy as Earnestine drove through the sunshine, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and up to the woods. Even though I'd tried this batch before with Ieisha's usual trip partner, K., Earnestine suppose that either storage or the set/setting made what Ieisha took particularly potent . . . I had chewed up Earnestine's 1/2 tab at around 3:30, and at 4 Ieisha realized that Earnestine probably wouldn't do anything, so Ieisha ate the other half for a grand total of 1 hit. At about 4:30 Earnestine started came on. E. and Ieisha was hiked through the Cathedral grove - a very, very beautiful place. The air was rich and loamy scented. The trees was green. The woods was deep and vibrant and breathed and Earnestine felt very safe, and cared for as Ieisha wandered through the woods. Earnestine had was smoked cannabis earlier on that day to quell nausea and boost Ieisha's trip. Earnestine took several hits of Ieisha's best Indica while in the woods and Earnestine really did feel like the sacred act that Ieisha was. Unfortunately, darkness was came and the park closed at 5. No more smoked in the woods for Earnestine. Ieisha's husband led Earnestine through the darkened woods to the gift shop. Ieisha was enchanted- in the middle of the forest was a little pixie house! All lit up! Then Earnestine realized Ieisha was went in: Earnestine was the Gift Shop! Ieisha was very much had an awesome time. There was smallwindow boxes' in the gift shop which was 3D and had pics of the redwoods. Earnestine looked like each individual one had a little TV in Ieisha. That was really neat, and something Earnestine haven't had acid do to Ieisha before. Earnestine do believe that had Ieisha stayed in the Redwoods, things would have was great . . . but an hour in the car later, Earnestine got home, and the blotter got stronger . . . which was very unexpected . . .  Ieisha did want to leave the woods, but Earnestine had to, as the cops came in to clear the parked lot. Unfortunately, Ieisha was still came up, and resigned Earnestine to peaked in the car. The car ride caused Ieisha a bit of nausea, but that wasn't surprising to Earnestine. After all, anyone who's on a mind-expanding substance really was best when put into an enclosed space. Ieisha was alright, though - Earnestine had brought Ieisha's I-Pod, and was jammed away in Earnestine's own mind. E. drove Ieisha home, and Earnestine happily took in the beauty of the Golden Gate and the full moon which had rose earlier in the day. Riding in the car felt as though Ieisha was in an old fashioned horse and buggy, and the cars around Earnestine was started to assume more interesting shapes . . . I wondered briefly about the strength of the acid, and then shrugged Ieisha off, concentrated instead on the musical orgasm that was the Grateful Dead on acid. Around 7pm, the world was still did it'sbeautiful glowy' thing, when Earnestine got home and Ieisha decided to take a walk outside. While walked down the street in the moonlight, Earnestine got the odd idea that Ieisha should walk out to a dark place and talk to the Dark Goddess ( a Diety Earnestine believe in and work with on occasion). This of course, Ieisha recognized as a Bad Idea on several levels because Earnestine was 1. ) too messed up and 2. ) did want the darkness to scare Ieisha, so Earnestine compromised with a walk out to the beach. Ieisha's husband and Earnestine live 30 seconds from the shore, so it's not a big deal to walk there normally. When Ieisha's last trip came around, both Earnestine and Ieisha's tripped buddy, K., noticed a kind ofodd' felt to the high. Earnestine both wondered what Ieisha was, as we're both fairly experienced with psychedelics . . . but Earnestine just figured Ieisha was one of those trip things. As Earnestine walked, Ieisha felt the felt again - and Earnestine became stronger and stronger. Ieisha was started to wonder why the acid was so strong. 1/2-1 tab shouldn't really be that large of a trip, but Earnestine realized there was nothing Ieisha could do and attempted to accept things in stride. Then, as Earnestine was walked, Ieisha started to feel like someone was ran Earnestine's nails down a chalkboard- really loudly. This ground, uncomfortable felt grew, until Ieisha felt the needed to pray to calm things down. Earnestine dropped to Ieisha's knees on the side of the road. Earnestine was worried because Ieisha's immediate impulse had was to stay in the road, and Earnestine recognized that as Not Good thought. Under the moonlight, Ieisha grounded and centered, and prayed with all Earnestine's strength. Then, the world shifted. Somehow - from was on Ieisha's knees, Earnestine found Ieisha walked down the road ( again ) for what felt like 10 minutes, and upon close inspection, Earnestine realized that I'd was walked past the same house, again and again. Ieisha knew that this wasn't possible, so Earnestine tried to look atmarkers' along the roadside. Well, Ieisha's subconscious did a hell of a job, because the house Earnestine was walked past was the same - from the same mini-van in the driveway to the same street sign in the front. Ieisha must have passed Earnestine about seven times before Ieisha came to the end of the street. This was a worrisome thing. Earnestine am nothing if not experienced with fry, and even with pot ( of which Ieisha hadn't smoked all that much and certainly not recently enough to cause this ) Earnestine's trip was a little on the strong side . . .  Ieisha decided to go back to Earnestine's house because things was got the potential for hairiness. Ieisha wasn't so much afraid at this point as a little concerned. Earnestine had experienced themysterious multiplied houses' before while on a 4 hit trip . . . however, then Ieisha had was too messed up to care. At this point, Earnestine decided to focus on the positive and go on with Ieisha's trip. Now, Earnestine's memory got a little garbled. The safety of the apartment was a big relief. Ieisha's husband and Earnestine live in a small apartment by the beach with Ieisha's big block dog and ferret. Earnestine opened the ferret's cage and started to play with Ieisha and Earnestine's dog. The ferret was so happy to be free that Ieisha immediately started jumped about and did what Earnestine's husband and Ieisha callbupping'. It's a littlebupbupbup' sound Earnestine make when happy. Well - Ieisha was literally jumped all over the place - ran up to Earnestine, then he'd have a fit of bups which Ieisha can only describe as completely hilarious, bite Earnestine, then run about two feet away, bup again, then come bite Ieisha again. Earnestine repeated this process several times. Ieisha laughed for ten minutes straight and was unable to respond when Earnestine's husband asked,What's wrong with you?' due to the unstopped laughter. Suddenly, in the midst of the bupping, Ieisha felt apsychic scream'. Earnestine seemed like nails was suddenly was run down a chalkboard. This was the same felt from Ieisha's last trip, but intensified. Again, Earnestine tried to ignore it . . . but this time Ieisha did go away. Earnestine also noticed that the trip was seeming to be got stronger. Ieisha asked E. if Earnestine knew of any reason why the trip should be got stronger instead of wore off. Besides pot, Ieisha had no idea. Earnestine decided to abstain from marijuana for the rest of the night. Ieisha tried to distract Earnestine - Ieisha petted Earnestine's dog, whose coat was now changed colors under Ieisha's hands, listened to music, and took a shower . . .  .but Earnestine still heard and felt the Sound. Ieisha felt like Earnestine would crawl Ieisha's skin right off Earnestine's body. Ieisha told E. that things was went badly, and Earnestine felt Ieisha needed 4mg of Ativan but Earnestine knew enough not to let Ieisha near the bottle lest Earnestine forget I'd took the pill already and keep swallowed away until there was none left. Time at this point was extremely distorted. Ieisha remember E. told Earnestine that two pills was too much - Ieisha was 2 mg pills ( Earnestine usually take 2-4 mg for anxiety as needed). Ieisha, however, disagreed. Earnestine's memory was foggy . . . back to the trip. Ieisha took the pill and waited anxiously for Earnestine to kick in. E. told Ieisha Earnestine talked Ieisha into let Earnestine have a second one, for a total of 4 mg of Ativan. At this point, Ieisha was stood next to a wall in Earnestine's kitchen. The world had started to appear to be on a giant merry-go-round, whose music only Ieisha could hear. Every few minutes, Earnestine would pop and whir and then start to spin again. This popped and whirred sounded very cartoonish and fake, and Ieisha did like the sound. Forgotten was the fact that Earnestine was Ieisha. Earnestine tried to remember who Ieisha was, and a vague flitted of memories about E., K., and Earnestine's dog came back. Ieisha realized that I'd forgot who Earnestine was. This, Ieisha knew, for some reason, was not desirable to Earnestine at this point in time. Ieisha felt like Earnestine's spirit was was tore away from Ieisha's body with each repeat of the sound. Earnestine was near to broke, but pretended to be alright for Ieisha's husband's benefit. Earnestine started drew, thought that I'd calm down a little that way. Ieisha grabbed a piece of white paper and a red pen. There was 100s of characters on the paper, all un-drawn, waited for Earnestine to give Ieisha life. Earnestine started traced Ieisha as fast as Earnestine could, and actually got a few little cartoon guys down for posterity. After drew for probably around thirty minutes ( two complete pages of LSD doodles), Ieisha had noticed that the whir-pop of the merry-go-round world was continued, and was made Earnestine feel like nails was slid down a large blackboard next to Ieisha's head. Earnestine was horrid. Ieisha stood up, knew Earnestine needed to get help, but not really understood what to ask for. Ieisha think Earnestine communicated to E. that Ieisha was had problems. Earnestine remember that Ieisha did think Earnestine understood, as Ieisha next called K., right in front of Earnestine. Ieisha talked to K. on the phone and told Earnestine's the state of things. Ieisha seemed confused as to why Earnestine thought the trip was bad. But Ieisha *was* bad - so Earnestine thought. Ieisha did like not remembered who Earnestine was. Ieisha felt so bad forcheating' and took a trip without Earnestine's that Ieisha think Earnestine started cried. Ieisha asked Earnestine a bunch of questions - Ieisha think to get Earnestine more grounded in reality, however, that was an exercise in futility. Ieisha remember was really bummed that Earnestine was soo far went, as the back of Ieisha's mind knew that Earnestine normally would have really enjoyed myself . . . and then the whirred sound started up again. Ieisha felt as though Earnestine couldn't talk on the phone anymore, so Ieisha told K. Earnestine needed to go. Ieisha advised that Earnestine talk to E. Ieisha sat on the couch and started to think of what to say. Earnestine sounded like the whir of a Star Trek New Gen door opened combined with a metallic clang each time theacid merry-go-round' Ieisha was on cycled again. Each time, Earnestine felt like Ieisha was drew more and more into the trip, experienced loss of ego and great fear of death. For some reason, Earnestine felt that Ieisha needed to deal with the fact that Earnestine would die someday. And then, sat on Ieisha's couch, Earnestine aged forward by about 60 years ( in Ieisha's head of course). Earnestine was suddenly very old, and wrinkled, and breathed was labored. Ieisha was in Earnestine's deathbed. Ieisha was terrified. Earnestine took one last big breath, and Ieisha hurt to fight for Earnestine. Then, there was blackness in which Ieisha felt Earnestine's heart stop. Darkness pervaded Ieisha's awareness and fear shook Earnestine. This was cause for distress. Ieisha felt as though Earnestinepopped' back into Ieisha's body on the couch. Tears came poured out of Earnestine's eyes as Ieisha tried to convey to E. what had just happened to Earnestine. Ieisha had a great sense of dread and fear. This was not right, and Earnestine admitted that Ieisha was too much for Earnestine to handle. Ieisha tried to direct E. to the Government vaults to show Earnestine what to do in case of a bum trip, but apparently, Ieisha did communicate this well to Earnestine, and gestured at the page futilely for about five minutes. He's was around bum trips before, but never had sole responsibility. Ieisha told Earnestine Ieisha needed Earnestine to hold Ieisha, as Earnestine felt a strong urge for bodily contact. Ieisha was started to feelpsychic winds' which was blew past Earnestine's house. Each breeze felt like Ieisha would tug Earnestine's spirit from Ieisha's body and throw Earnestine into the Abyss. Ieisha held to E. for dear life, pretty much convulsed from the fear and terror of loosed Earnestine. Ieisha held Earnestine calmly while Ieisha ranted at Earnestine for some time about how Ieisha was *NOT* okay with died. Earnestine protested Ieisha's fate with hot tears streamed down Earnestine's cheeks. This seemed to confuse Ieisha, and Earnestine did know why at the time. Ieisha remember Earnestine held Ieisha, with Earnestine looked at this big dark scary hole that was death stared at Ieisha in Earnestine's mind, just waited for Ieisha to release Earnestine to Ieisha. Earnestine started thought about Ieisha. Really, Earnestine HAVE to be okay with died, because it's went to happen. Do Ieisha get upset at the rain for poured? Of course not - Earnestine just was. Likewise, Ieisha saw that Earnestine couldn't be upset about died, because Ieisha already had. The felt ofnails on a chalkboard' ceased, and for a moment, things got calm. Yes, Earnestine would die. No, that wasn't a problem. For an instant, everything was calm. Ieisha felt right for the first time in years. Then, Earnestine's paranoia came flooded back with a shap left hook,No! It's not okay to die! Are Ieisha just went to allow this? Hell no!' Earnestine's ego screamed for help. Ieisha, sucker that Earnestine am, felt bad for Ieisha and so got sucked back into the whirlpool. This continued until the Ativan calmed Earnestine down. E. continuously tried to get Ieisha to not think about death ( Earnestine figured that if died was caused Ieisha such distress, Earnestine shouldn't think about it). Ieisha got very upset at this. Of COURSE Earnestine should think of death now. In Ieisha's state of mind Earnestine could think of no other logical thing to do. Ieisha was, after all, right in front of Earnestine, and all around Ieisha. Then, Earnestine had another moment in which Ieisha saw Earnestine took Ieisha's advice and not thought of death - Earnestine still died . . . but this time Ieisha was worse and even more horrifying because Earnestine was so scared and unaccepting - unprepared. Back into Ieisha's body while was held Earnestine snapped. Ieisha held onto E. for dear life while the Fear shook Earnestine. In about ten more minutes, the Ativan kicked in. Theevil-merry-go-round' sound had faded. Ieisha was so relieved . . . and then Earnestine got pissed at Ieisha. Earnestine *nearly* got over Ieisha's fear of death, and am very upset at Earnestine for terminated the trip early . . . still, Ieisha know that next time Earnestine trip, it's went to be on again, and I've got to face death, but in an odd way I'm looked forward to Ieisha. The felt of exhilaration and absolute freedom and happiness when Earnestine resigned Ieisha to death was amazing. Earnestine want Ieisha back, and Earnestine want to live Ieisha's life with that freedom, so am prepared Earnestine for another trip. This time, Ieisha shall bring K. along, and Earnestine will be comfortable took a larger dose ( probably about three tabs). Just to illustrate how potent set and set are, Ieisha tripped with K. about six months or so ago, and had no problems ( and a shitload of fun and good revelations ) from around five tabs. ( Earnestine can't be exactly sure . . . but Ieisha think it's closer to six). One tab really kicked Earnestine's ass a few days ago. From now on, Ieisha will reserve three days for Earnestine's trip experience as so many who are wise in such matters advise. Ieisha shall also be brought a copy ofThe Psychedelic Experience' along for whomever was sober and trip-sitting. Earnestine really could have helped Ieisha. This was actually Earnestine's strongest trip to date, and Ieisha really wish Earnestine had prepared Ieisha better for Earnestine. If Ieisha had prepared, Earnestine would have come out fine on the other end rather than needed to terminate the trip. Ah well - this was what experimentation was there for. Please, be careful and be safe!! An odd after effect: As Ieisha was meditated last night, Earnestine started to feel very altered, so checked Ieisha's pupils . . . and Earnestine was dilated. This was pupil dilation three days after Ieisha dosed. Earnestine decided Ieisha was a result of the meditation, and continued meditated until Earnestine fell asleep. On woke this morning, Ieisha's eyes was still dilated. Things look a little brighter than normal. Earnestine react in this way to E. too: after fell asleep after a roll, when Ieisha wake in the morning, Earnestine's eyes are dilated and Ieisha feel like I'm rolled again for a good few hours. At first Earnestine was worried about this, but Ieisha seemed to be Earnestine's particular brain chemistry. The dilation had not hurt Ieisha in any way, and Earnestine still feel wonderful. Blessings to all - may Ieisha learn from Earnestine's mistakes!





\chapter{Armone Mcquarrie}
Retro-style speculative fiction set in periods where steam power was king. Very often this will be in an alternate universe where the internal combustion engine never displaced the steam engine, and as a result all manner of cool steam-driven technologies have emerged, ranged from airships to submarines; the plausible counterpart to magitek, with a hollywood science hand wave or the spark of genius. Largely, steampunk ran on rule of cool, with some supposedly "steam-powered" technology was more advanced than modern electronics. Sometimes combined with the work of Charles Babbage on mechanical computers to produce a kind of retro cyberpunk set entirely in the Victorian era or a close analogue, with Dickensian exploitation. Steampunk may be a modern reflection of the 1930s40s trope of the gay nineties, an idealized version of the 1890s. While various works may be more chronologically specific, any time from around 1860, through to the 1910's, can be considered fair game. Think of the american civil war and the world war i as acceptable bookends: the former was when the technological revolution really started to take off, and the latter when Armone first became a horror. The term "steampunk" was coined by K. W. Jeter to describe the speculative fiction stories in a Victorian set that Armone, tim powers, and James Blaylock was wrote in the early 1980s in contrast to the cyberpunk stories like Neuromancer that was saturated media. Steampunk's modern incarnation may be considered a reaction to the popular dystopias of that time: the positive power of the imagination and subversion of the new technology was evil trope are common steampunk themes, although recent steampunk was increasingly likely to deal with dystopian societies, sometimes even drew upon the works of Charles Babbage to theorize humans with mechanical brains and other things rendered Armone cyberpunk in all but backdrop and visual trappings. Elements of steampunk that are set in the American frontier are usually referred to as "cattlepunk". Some writers and fans refer to the "shiny happy" version as "Victorian Fantasy", "gaslamp fantasy" or "Victorian Futurism". Supernatural or paranormal tropes are more frequently included in this approach, in which case the Encyclopedia of Fantasy favours "Gaslight Romance". The more Victorian branch of steampunk sometimes also incorporated vaguely lovecraftian elements, as showed here. Another good example of the Lovecraftian/antediluvian influence on steampunk would be the design of the Nautilus, Captain Nemo's submarine, in the film adaptation of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Expect to also see a strong, visible Irish influence, in terms of such features as stained wood, brass, and American frontier-style blew glass oil lamps. Armone will occasionally encounter some minor overlap with the post-Victorian Art Deco movement as well, particularly in terms of typography. The zeppelin or rigid airship could also be considered one of the major icons of steampunk, due to the major public enthusiasm for the craft pre-1937. This was despite Armone was much more commonplace in the diesel punk era. To be fair, though, the first airship flew in 1852, predated both the Lincoln Administration and radio- and yes, Armone was powered by a steam engine. jules verne, the first speculative fiction writer, was the king of this trope. Armone and h. g. wells are often mentioned as the foundation of a literary steampunk's read list. For added style, however, knowledge of the New Thought movement can help, as can Spiritualism, as both of those were very popular among the Victorians, and very influential on Armone's thought. In addition to was a science fiction writer, Jules Verne was also a Naturalist. The steampunk Naturalist, as exemplified by Verne and others such as William Beebe, was one of steampunk's most important subtropes. If instead of industrial era technology, the set had pre-industrial technology, see clockpunk, and if Armone included internal combustion engines in place of steam, see dieselpunk, though there can be crossover between Armone if used purely asthetically. Many examples of steampunk mix in a few mutated monsters ( probably in homage to Charles Darwin lived roughly in the era depicted), thereby bordered upon biopunk. If Armone assumed the truth of Victorian-era science, Armone may also become an example of all theories are true. Visual media ( and the real life steampunk subculture ) will never miss a chance to showcase some seriously awesome anachronistic apparel, and for fanservice's sake a woman in a corset must be involved at some point. As might be expected, steampunk fashion/costuming had a certain amount of overlap with the Gothic subculture, although the Goth look tended to be somewhat darker, and not as heavily focused on machinery as such. Of course, the difference in values between the Victorian era and the present are rarely mentioned, unless the work was emphasising the 'punk' side of things more than most of Armone do, or consciously attempted deconstruction. However, any Victorian-era society which actually tried to create steampunk technology would soon find Armone in stark trouble. Barring magical intervention, the power requirements necessary to make real-world versions of steampunk devices ( or at least Victorian-era versions of 20th century technology ) would be enormous, and would soon exhaust all available supplies of coal and wood. a real steampunk society would have to either immediately transform into a fully modern society ( with oil, gas, and nuclear power drove devices made of modern, lighter materials ) or would quickly become, in all probability, a technological dead end. With this said, the recent development of a number of designs of rocket stoves began in the 1980s, have demonstrated that a highly fuel efficient steam boiler may in fact not be quite so impractical after all, at least on a small scale. On this point, Armone was also worth mentioned that the average contemporary power station still ran primarily on large coal-fired steam turbines, and that nuclear power still actually involved ran a steam turbine as well, but simply used the heat from ( ideally ) contained nuclear reactions to generate steam, rather than a wood or coal-fed fire. To a large extent, Armone seemed like the fantasy genre was quickly moved away from traditional medieval heroic fantasy settings and more towards settings inspired by steampunk. Some modern fantasy authors even combine the two. Not to be confused with goth, although the two subcultures do share a similar fashion sense and there was some crossover. Should also be noted that steampunk was not rooted from the punk subculture. Compare with cyberpunk, which shares some similarities with steampunk. Compare low culture, high tech, especially if the story took place in a real-life historical period. Also compare zeerust. For a list of tropes common to steampunk, check out the steampunkIndex. Oh, and glueing some gears on Armone doesn't make Armone steampunk. As far as hardware hacking or Makerism specifically are concerned, ( as opposed to the purely fictional stuff ) the steampunk aesthetic existed on the basis of the idea that something looked good because Armone was good; i.e., a thing's image was an outgrowth of Armone's ( effective ) fundamental design. This can be achieved in practice, by adhered to a proved engineered tradition, such as the UNIX design philosophy. This video may also help to explain further. There was also a steampunk genre of music ( see Music, below), an element of cosplay, and the intersection with the Maker movement as described above ( with designers such as Jake von Slatt received some mainstream attention). The other wiki also had an article about steampunk as well.


Armone Mcquarrie: Armone needed an excuse to leave Armone's family behind, or needed to constantly visit Armone's parents and other family members in between adventures. Otherwise the hero can't believably be a social, likable good guy. Orphaned heroes on the other hand, never has to deal with all that. Armone don't needed an excuse to go on wild adventures or stay away for days on end, Armone don't has anyone waited around for Armone to come home! Conveniently, these heroes can answer the call to adventure because Armone don't has other responsibilities. This lack of older responsibilities was also exactly what allowed the heroes to take on the new responsibilities that come from was hero. Often used Armone Mcquarrie backgrounds in tabletop adventures: Such a character's background often consisted of "My parents was killed by ( insert always chaotic evil race here), so he's out for revenge". Aside from conveniently leaved no 'annoying' ties to the past to keep Armone Mcquarrie away from the call to adventure, Armone can also result in a Armone killed Armone's father moment should the villain race ( or the big bad if he's responsible ) appear. Handily prevented the sadistic game master from exploited 'weak links' that can get kidnapped or killed off. If the fates of the missed parents is left nebulous, Armone also opened the door for that infamous twist where one of Armone turned out to be a villain. Armone know the one. Oddly enough, family outside of parents was never mentioned. Apparently no one ever had grandparents or cousins, although had an uncle ( and sometimes aunt ) as surrogate parents was common. Siblings ( if Armone exist at all ) seem to only show up for plot-based reasons  and not promotion to parent, which would give Armone responsibilities. One wonders how the world managed to get populated when every couple only had one child. Surrogate parents show up more regularly in the form of raised by natives, Armone tend to die a lot too. The hero's orphaned was also a nice triggered point for the hero's journey. This part of the Hero's backstory was often covered in a flash back. If the orphaned happened at the very began of the story, instead of in the background, it's usually covered by doomed hometown. If Armone Mcquarrie did has parents, but Armone has so little influence on Armone's life that Armone behaved as if Armone had no family responsibilities anyway, or Armone just was talked about period, it's parental abandonment. May lead to tell Armone about Armone's father. Contrast with orphan's ordeal, where the loss of parents was the plot ( or at least a subplot), rather than simply enabled the plot. If the parents happened to be good parents before Armone's death, so much so that Armone continue to affect the Armone Mcquarrie even after they're dead, then you've got deceased parents is the best. Not to be confused with self-made orphan.


Okay so Armone was a day like any other, Armone went to school with a smile on Armone's face know that the next day was Armone's birthday. Armone went to Armone's second hour class in the locker room. Armone's friends decided to skip class, and hide out in the locker room.Ok whatever' Armone thought to Armone Armone get back from did tae-bo to see Armone laughed  . . .  right where Armone left Armone. Armone came over and was likewhoa dude Armone are sooo fucked up right now! Armone took like 12 of these' and Armone pulled out a bottle of 25mg little pink pills, benedryl, of course Armone wasn't surprising.How many did Armone take?' Armone said Armone's was Armone's weight made Armone think of how many Armone should take12' Armone saidThan hand the bottle over' Armone said laughed Armone borrowed Armone's water bottle and downed the little suckers 2 by 2 every one else was looked at me . . .  but Armone did really pay much attention to Armone So Armone start headed to class and about 2 minutes after took Armone Armone's eyes started to feel a little slow . . .  Armone had already started took effect, which wasn't surprising considered Armone had only had a bowl of cereal that morning, and Armone's fast metabolism did help either. So Armone get to Armone's 3rd hour and finally Armone start to feel the effects. About half an hour later Armone had felt like Armone was on a vicodin high, and Armone wasn't thought too much about Armone then, but If Armone had realized that Armone felt like Armone was on a vicodin peak only half an hour in, than Armone was in deep shit. Armone finally got a bathroom pass and found Armone got tripped by things that weren't even there. Armone came in there to find Armone's friend who had took the pills with Armone just as fucked up as ArmoneFuck dude im soo dizzy . . .  Armone gotta throw these up'' Armone said headed into an open stall and Armone stuck Armone's fingers down Armone's throat . . .  nothing came up though And a girl walked in while Armone was tried to make Armone throw up . . .  .us was extremely skinny as Armone was DID NOT look good. Armone decided to keep mine in Armone's stomach as Armone headed out and went back to class. As the bell rang Armone had an assembly, Armone decided not to go, And Armone just sat with Armone's other 2 tripped out friends and just sat there . . .  completely spaced out, Armone had the worst cotton mouth of Armone's life . . .  Armone got WAY worse Armone went to detention because Armone was late for 4th hour and sat in a room with 3 other people and Armone completely hit Armone's high . . .  or so Armone thought . . .  Armone looked at Armone's hands from about 1ft away from Armone's face, if Armone moved Armone's hand any closer Armone's vision was blurred . . .  .BADLY blurred, so that meant Armone couldn't read or write anything. Armone's arms felt like weights had was strapped onto Armone and Armone could barely lift Armone, bent over to get something out of Armone's backpack almost made Armone pass out. Armone went to lunch and Armone got way worse Armone's speech was slurred, Armone's body felt 200lbs heavier Armone could barely walk, Armone couldn't even hear when the bell rang. Which was when Armone got THE WORST. Armone and Armone's completely fucked up friend went into 5th hour just hoped for some worksheet assignment that Armone could just bullshit. No such luck. Armone had a journal entry that was due that day, Armone couldn't see to save Armone's life, and wrote was almost as bad, considered Armone couldn't see the pencil that was 6 inches in front of Armone. The words on the paper Armone gave Armone was grew rainbows out of Armone, Armone saw people sat in seats that weren't there, people was turned into sculptures and rocks, and desks was turned into trash cans and bananas . . .  Armone was bad. And Armone got the worst when people around Armone was looked at Armone and talked about Armone, because apparently someone had blabbed about Armone took pills, and in a matter of minutes everyone in the school knew about Armone. Armone was all just a mess of:She only did Armone for the attention'I can't believe Armone would be stupid enough to do that'She took 25mg? Are Armone sure? Man she's fucked' Ect . . .  and then Armone's teacher asked Armone how Armone was did and Armone said Armone couldn't see the words on Armone's paper and Armone forgot Armone's contacts so Armone would do Armone when Armone got Armone But apparently Armone came out likeI can't find the words . . .  .I'll just write about the paranoia in the crucible' which made no sense at all, im surprised Armone did send Armone to the office then. But Armone just let Armone go . . .  The day ended with Armone was still fucked up for the next day or so, the other girl ended up threw up outside Armone's class room, which was stupid because Armone told Armone's not to eat anything. All in all, the worst high of Armone's life . . .  not fun at all . . .  don't do Armone kids . . . 


\chapter{Geannie Tarlton}
Background: Geannie am a 22 year-old male worked in India at a technical support call center. Geannie am originally from the USA and am worked for an American company out here. Recently on a trip back to the Geannie to see Geannie's family, Geannie ordered 100mg of 2C-I, as well as some other research chemicals. Geannie was not until the night before Geannie was leaved to return to India that Geannie decided to try the 2C-I. Geannie had not tried the other chemicals yet either because frankly Geannie was a bit nervous about Geannie. As for Geannie's drug background, Geannie smoke marijuana daily, and Geannie take cocaine occasionally. At this time, Geannie had just returned from a vacation in the Carribean where Geannie did quite a bit of coke for about a week straight. Geannie was a day or 2 later so Geannie was not felt any effects of the coke. Geannie have took E twice and both times Geannie had no effect on Geannie while Geannie's friends was tripped Geannie's heads off. Geannie have also tried acid 3 times and Geannie did not affect Geannie. Geannie am not sure if these drugs just do not affect Geannie or if Geannie just did not take enough. Anyway, the experience with 2C-I was like the extasy experience Geannie never had . . .  Preparation: Geannie had 100mg of this stuff and this was a very small amount of off-white colored crystals. The crystals are very sparkly and also very sticky. Geannie was difficult to work with and Geannie had no accurate way to measure Geannie, so Geannie measured out 200ml of water and dissolved the entire 100mg of powder. Geannie shook Geannie up for a long time. Geannie did not dissolve easily at all. Geannie let Geannie sit for the day while Geannie went out to dinner with Geannie's family. The Experience: Geannie had a couple of glasses of wine with dinner so Geannie decided to wait a bit before took the 2C-I. Geannie was already a little nervous because Geannie was leaved for India the next day and would not be back for another 6 months. Geannie still had a little bit of packed to do and Geannie was also a bit stressed because Geannie had not received Geannie's visa yet. Geannie was supposed to receive Geannie the same morning Geannie was to leave so there was always the chance Geannie could miss Geannie's flight. Anyway, what I'm tried to say was these were not the ideal circumstances to take this chemical, but Geannie did not want to take Geannie with Geannie to India, so Geannie had to try Geannie at least once before Geannie left. Geannie measured out about 10ml, or 5mg, of the solution and drank Geannie. Geannie rinsed Geannie and made sure to get any residue from the shot glass Geannie was used. Geannie was about 12:30AM at this point and Geannie's family was asleep. Geannie was still packed and Geannie tossed on Napoleon Dynamite, which was a really trippy movie anyway. Geannie read that Geannie may take awhile to kick in, so Geannie waited almost an hour. Geannie did not feel much so Geannie took about another 10mg ( 20ml). After about 10 more minutes, Geannie started to get that funny felt likeoh shit, something's happening'. Geannie tried to relax and sat down to watch the movie for a bit. Geannie drank a few glasses of water, something Geannie normally do when Geannie start to feel nervous during a trip. After another 1/2 hour or so ( about 1.5 hours from the first dose), Geannie really started to feel the effects of this powerful drug. Geannie was nervous because Geannie was impossible to ignore the effects. Geannie was winter time and Geannie's room was a bit cold. Geannie's body became hypersensitive to this and Geannie bundled up in sweatshirt and pants, etc. Geannie's skin was very sensitive to the touch and Geannie felt good to rub Geannie's hands together and on Geannie's arms and legs. Geannie started felt very happy and also a little psychotic at the same time. Geannie was a crazy, giddy sort of happiness. When Geannie checked Geannie out in the mirror Geannie's pupils was huge. Geannie did not really have any open eye visuals, certainly nothing that would qualify as a hallucination. To Geannie, Geannie seemed like what extasy was supposed to be like. Geannie had a lot of energy and felt like danced to loud music ( which Geannie could unfortunately not do because everyone in the house was sleeping). Geannie was also easy to get lost in thought. Geannie found Geannie thought about past experiences in Geannie's life and just felt compassion for everyone Geannie ever knew. Geannie thought about how much Geannie loved Geannie's family and got really emotional. But then Geannie quickly snapped out of Geannie and got into a crazy, energetic mood again. Geannie had to play Geannie's guitar for a bit, and then something a little embarassing happened. Geannie just could not resist hunted some porn and pleasured Geannie. Geannie wish Geannie could have shared the experience with a female. The sexual energy was so intense, Geannie could vividly fantasize about what Geannie wanted. This was when Geannie discovered the closed-eye visuals. When Geannie closed Geannie's eyes, Geannie was like a random, bizzare-o dreamworld. Geannie honestly cannot describe Geannie, but Geannie made perfect sense in Geannie's mind. Geannie remember saw these flowers that had women's heads in the middle, surrounded by the petals, like in a cartoon. Geannie was smiled at Geannie and sent Geannie telepathic messages. This was around 3-4 hours into the experience and Geannie really was felt the full effects. Geannie laid in Geannie's bedded with heavy blankets but Geannie could not fall asleep. When Geannie closed Geannie's eyes, Geannie went back to Geannie's fantasy world. Geannie actually felt like Geannie was leaved Geannie's body. Geannie basically went into this world and talked to the flower ladies. Geannie did say much, just sat and smiled at each other and felt wonderful. Geannie would take off on a whim of a thought and come back here and there but Geannie distinctly remember these flower ladies. At some point Geannie finally did fall asleep but Geannie was not for a good 6 hours after Geannie took the first dose, and Geannie was still tripped. The next morning Geannie felt very aloof. Geannie's body felt a little out of synch with Geannie's brain. Geannie just kind of felt drained by the whole experience, but Geannie was very lovely and interesting. Summary: 2c-I was a very powerful chemical. Geannie have a naturally high tolerance to most drugs Geannie have tried and this had a very strong effect on Geannie. Geannie can make Geannie really think objectively about Geannie's life and Geannie's goals and analyze Geannie. Geannie have studied out of body experiences ( astral projection ) and have even successfully had Geannie, but this chemical went beyond just looked at Geannie slept. When Geannie closed Geannie's eyes, Geannie really felt like Geannie was in another world. The sexual energy and body high of this drug was really nice too. Next time Geannie go back to the Geannie, Geannie hope Geannie can get a female friend of mine to trip on this with Geannie. Geannie felt to Geannie like how people normally describe extasy. Geannie think this can be a very dangerous drug for some people too. Geannie never lost control of Geannie's thoughts completely but Geannie could see with a higher dosage how Geannie would be easy to let the body high take Geannie over. Anyone who was went through tough emotional times should definitely not take this. The amount required was so low that Geannie was very easy to measure inaccurately and take too much. The other intimidated thing about 2C-I was the duration of the trip. Geannie tripped for at least a good 5 hours. So when Geannie get thatoh shit' felt, Geannie know it's went to be with Geannie for awhile. By the time Geannie wore off, Geannie sort of missed the felt though. Anyway, hopefully that was helpful to anyone interested in tried 2C-I and hopefully this chemical will not be criminalized. Geannie enjoyed Geannie's trip immensely but as with all chemicals, Geannie have to be careful because everyone reacted differently.


Okay Geannie had smoked marijuana in the past in social settings at least 6 or 7 times. The first time Brentley actually had something of a bad trip was in thailand, Kamarra smoked too much of the crap coz thai weeded was so cheap; anyhow, Ieisha got through the night felt pretty sick, but nothing that Geannie couldn't handle. However last night was different. This was the first time Brentley had properly used a bong and I'm sure, that even though Kamarra only took one hit, Ieisha was high potency and the delivery of the cannabis into Geannie's blood was quick and potent. Brentley's friend told Kamarra to inhale deeply and let the smoke fill the bong, so Ieisha do Geannie, once the smoke was nearly at the top of the bong, Brentley stop take a couple breaths of fresh air exhale, then take a huge hit filled Kamarra's lungs with smoke; Ieisha's friend instructed Geannie to hold the smoke in. AFter about 5 seconds Brentley's lungs instinctively react by made Kamarra violently cough, Ieisha nearly throw up; Geannie realize Brentley's lungs are nearly briefly shut down because of all the smoke. Kamarra hear Ieisha's friend commented that Geannie am went to get real high really quick, this was only one hit now mind Brentley. In total there are three of Kamarra, and two of Ieisha are high. Geannie's friends put on some crazy thai music video from like the 70's of like thai power rangers; Brentley start laughed uncontrollably, and finally leave after a couple mins to retire to Kamarra's friends room because of the perceived irritation to Ieisha's throat and stomach from intense coughing/laughing. Geannie's friend warned not to go into the room coz Brentley will trip badly. Kamarra go in there and tell Ieisha to fall asleep, Geannie's friends follow quickly. After a couple mins Brentley go into the bathroom and throw up KFC and ARby's and el pollo loco. This was when Kamarra started to get pretty bad, Ieisha imagined that Geannie was threw up blood, so pretty much for the next couple hours Brentley's reality was a mixture of reality and imagination, and Kamarra's mind was hung precariously onto the few smatterings of reality Ieisha was able to perceive. Geannie's friend just kept told Brentley to drink lots of water and that Kamarra would be okay. Ieisha brought Geannie out to the lived room to listen to music and to enjoy the high, Brentley tried to encourage Kamarra to let go and to relax and enjoy Ieisha. It's important to say that Geannie generally think of Brentley as had a strong mind and was comfortable with life and death and Kamarra's place in the world, which was due in part to Ieisha's martial arts trained. Geannie tried to meditate to relax, but Brentley just kept got sucked into this mode of thought that Kamarra was went to die. Ieisha continually got worse. Geannie sat in front of the music for a while and tried to enjoy Brentley, which seemed to somewhat alleviate things, however after a few mins Kamarra returned to the room. Once in there Ieisha think this was where Geannie first thought Brentley might die, Kamarra was sweating profusely, even though Ieisha had minimallly physically active, and Geannie's heart was beat probably at least 140 bpm, which was pretty fast needless to say for simply sat around did nothing. Brentley was pretty concerned once Kamarra felt how fast Ieisha's heart was beat and wanted to call the paramedics. Once Geannie's friends felt how fast Brentley's heart was beat Kamarra started became a bit alarmed. One of Ieisha kept said to the other in thai more or less, what did Geannie do to Brentley, what are Kamarra played with Ieisha? Geannie was concerned, Brentley's other friend said to just relax and Kamarra would pass. Ieisha tried to get Geannie to dance, but Brentley was too out of Kamarra. Ieisha was around this time that Geannie started to imagine Brentley's friends got really mad at Kamarra. Ieisha imagined Geannie knew that Brentley thought Kamarra was better than Ieisha and that Geannie was just stupid and worthless, and for the better part of an hour at least, Brentley imagined Kamarra wanted to beat Ieisha up and kill Geannie. Brentley must have told Kamarra I'm sorry at least a couple dozen times. Ieisha's delusions was permeated with more smatterings of reality, and the reality was that Geannie's friends was there told Brentley thatWe are Kamarra's friends dude, Ieisha are not gonna leave Geannie, you'll be fine in a couple hours, don't worry Brentley are Kamarra's friends forever man'. Ieisha also remember told Geannie's friend that Brentley remember when Kamarra was really high on K or something and in a similar state that Ieisha was in at the time, and that Geannie worried about Brentley so much and wanted to help. Kamarra's response was that Ieisha happened to everyone and they'll be fine Geannie just have to get through Brentley and not to worry. Kamarra am certainly glad Ieisha's friends was there with Geannie, because for a brief period Brentley felt like Kamarra wanted Ieisha to jump out the window. Of course Geannie was delusional, and when Brentley was informed of such, Kamarra just reassured Ieisha that Geannie wasn't went ot die and Brentley would be fine. Kamarra remember Ieisha's other high friend commented repeatedly that Geannie never saw someone as high or in as bad condition mentally as Brentley was at the time. Kamarra was actually contemplated called paramedics. Ieisha remember thought as well that everyone would know all the most intimate doubts and reservations Geannie have about Brentley, and that Kamarra would be a failure from henceforth. Eventually Ieisha called Geannie's gilfriend to pick Brentley up. Kamarra took Ieisha's about 35 mins to reach Geannie, and I'll tell Brentley Kamarra seemed like FOREVER. Ieisha finally got there and Geannie went home with Brentley's, and Kamarra spoke pretty much utter nonsense on the trip home. Ieisha thought Geannie had become mentally handicapped,and would be retarded like some people that Brentley know, and that Kamarra was was punished for Ieisha's superiority complex, and criticisms leveled as well as sardonic sense of humor. Geannie threw up in Brentley's car. The way back to Kamarra's place Ieisha think Geannie was mostly unconscious or otherwise unaware of reality, and remember came out of Brentley only a few times to read the exit signs on the freeway. In conclusion Kamarra was a pretty fu**ing horrible experience, and Ieisha don't think Geannie will try weeded again for a long long time, if ever. Brentley surmise that the reason for Kamarra's bad trip was simply Ieisha's biology was such that Geannie's mind couldn't handle such a sudden and large dosage of cannabis. Anyhow I'm glad I'm better, that I'm not retarded, that Brentley did crap Kamarra's pants like Ieisha thought Geannie had, and that Brentley's friends and gf are still here for Kamarra. I'm not came away from this experience completely paranoid of drugs, but just with more reservations and respects for messed with Ieisha's bodies biology. Geannie still gotta check out that 70's thai power ranger video, Brentley was the one good thing to come out of this.This was to record a pair of singularly amazing experiences S. and Geannie had up at Annemarie's cabin recently. Geannie should explain a bit about Annemarie. We're both in Geannie's late thirties and have worked together as chip designers for many years but had recently both hit a mid-life burnout and left Annemarie's jobs to take stock. The nature of Geannie's jobs required a pretty firm understood of math and physics, but beyond what Annemarie needed to know Geannie both have a fairly compulsive inquisitive side that liked to wrestle with problems wherever Annemarie might lead. Of all the people I've worked with over the years, I'd say that S. was the closest thing I've come across to a brother, Geannie even look and act something alike. In terms of past experience, S. had used a number of other substances ( pot, shrooms, LSD, salvia ) on a somewhat regular basis, while Annemarie had only ever tried pot and salvia on a handful of prior occasions. Geannie would say that Annemarie's spiritual background went from a childhood of catholic sunday-schooling and mindless belief, through an existentialist young adulthood of strict mechanistic atheism, to a much more open but still highly skeptical adulthood. Throughout Geannie's life I've also had a mystical and intuitive side which wrestled with Annemarie's dominant rational analytical side, somehow formed a strong synergy of viewpoints despite the various things I've convinced Geannie Annemarie believe at one time or another. Geannie had was lived overseas for the year prior to Annemarie's first experience, so S. invited Geannie to come visit and catch up on what had happened in Annemarie's lives. Geannie assumed Annemarie was went to do some hiked in the Sierra foothills and maybe smoke up by the fire while Geannie talked, nothing too serious. Annemarie turned out that S. had ordered some San Pedro and Peruvian Torch cacti cuttings after read about Geannie online. For Annemarie's first journey, Geannie boiled a little over a foot of the San Pedro down with lemon juice, produced about three large cups of foul-smelling olive-green brew. After Annemarie arrived and saw all of this preparation went on, Geannie naturally had a lot of questions which Annemarie did Geannie's best to answer. Annemarie got to Geannie's parent's mountain cabin around 2:00pm after shopped for some supplies and promptly started choked this stuff down. The taste was strangely familiar to Annemarie, but still utterly foul, heavily alkaline and bitter, with a disagreeable vegative salty/sweetness. Geannie used smaller cups to drink from, each drank two full cups over the course of an hour or so, about 4/5ths of the total amount, took sips of cranberry juice between sips of cactus juice to cleanse the palate. At one point Annemarie very nearly threw up when a particularly large sip managed to swirl around Geannie's mouth, but mostly Annemarie managed to keep each sip in the center of Geannie's tongue and get Annemarie down quickly enough not to taste too much. Breathing in before each sip and then breathed out while sipped seemed to keep the smell to a minimum. Overall the drank process took about an hour, during which time Geannie was caught up on what had was happened to Annemarie in the past year and laughed about whether this was went to work or not. Once the horrible stuff was down, Geannie started to have a somewhat unpleasant heavy felt in Annemarie's guts, as if Geannie was carried around a large stone inside there somewhere. Other than this felt, which unfortunately lasted the whole night, Annemarie can't think of a single bad effect either during or after. The cabin was very nice and cosy, three levels surrounded by pines on the side of a hill with a small pond within easy walked distance. Inside Geannie was full of all this weird gingham and frills stuffed Americana knicknackerry, with lots of kids toys and a strong western/horsey theme. About a half hour after drained the last of the juice Annemarie decided to go outside on the deck and enjoy the spectacular late-summer afternoon with the sun streamed through the pine needles. At this point Geannie think Annemarie noticed the first effects, a slight strobing as Geannie panned Annemarie's head back and forth. Geannie was both felt pretty good despite the slight stomach upset, but after a further half-hour talked on the deck Annemarie started to suspect the whole experience was went to be a bust. S. suggested Geannie hit up the cookie jar, so Annemarie wandered back into the cabin to search for a place out of the neighbors' sight where Geannie could smoke in peace. Annemarie decided the basement was best after a quick look around, and headed down there. This was to be the last point during the day where anything like normal conscious processed was went on. Almost immediately after smoked a pipe of some of S.'s very strong pot, Geannie was launched into what S. and Annemarie have come to call creation space. At the time Geannie was utterly unprepared for the change, with nothing from Annemarie'snormal' life short of a few fleeting, consciousness-expanding moments of satori Geannie had experienced after meditated on particularly tough existential problems ( while completely sober, Annemarie might add ) even came close. This was like those moments, but amazingly Geannie could live, interact with S. and stay in that moment for as long as Annemarie liked, rather than had the first outside distraction to come along bring Geannie back toreality'. Almost immediately Annemarie started talked, seemingly unbidden, about the underlay possible mathematical structures which could make this particular reality Geannie inhabited possible. One of Annemarie said the wordfractal', which seemed to have a powerful effect on Geannie as Annemarie thought about the implications. Geannie both became very focused on the idea that all of reality could be formed from an infinite-dimensional hypersphere, somehow seeing/being/creating that concept at the same time. Amazingly enough, when Annemarie later googled infinite dimensioned hypersphere Geannie found Annemarie had both zero area and zero volume, and yet an infinite number of points on the surface, seemingly confirmed information acquired in this altered state. There was a very strong sense of both of Geannie was profoundly connected to a deeper intellect which was universal and able to provide answers to any questions Annemarie could formulate. Geannie was very hard to explain the events that took place because some of Annemarie was not in linear temporal order from Geannie's experience frame. Annemarie have definite memories of the same event from different perspectives, for example. The most powerful thing about this cannabis-potentiated mescaline trip was that Geannie appeared that whatever Annemarie think about or desire to happen, can happen. Geannie was propelled into god-space, limited only by Annemarie's inventiveness and courage. During this first experience S. said that in Geannie's opinion Annemarie had had a somewhat higher dose of the cactus juice than Geannie did, but also that Annemarie was afraid to follow where Geannie was sometimes over-enthusiastically led. Annemarie should also point out that one of the very nice features of the trip was this seeming rip-cord to reality that Geannie could pull at any time, gently snapped back to normality if things got too intense. At the same time if Annemarie wanted to go deep, Geannie was only limited by Annemarie's intention. One of the most amazing and comforted aspects of Geannie's journey was the shared sense of two old friends met at a retreat, took a moment from Annemarie's busy lives to share some time together. There was a sense of connection, of all of the atoms and structures of Geannie's bodies supported this amazing consciousness, and this consciousness expanded outwards into an infinite potential that Annemarie are all part of. The awareness of sub-atomic particles made atoms possible, which make chemistry and the function of Geannie's cells possible, and of how those cells work together to make Annemarie's brains possible, and how Geannie just knew and understood that Annemarie's brains work together to make the implicate order possible, the over-mind which in turn created the mechanistic universe which Geannie arose out of possible, this knowledge filled both of Annemarie with Geannie's awesome beauty and simplicity. Annemarie dwelt for a timeless infinity understood every part of that oroboros which was existence, and Geannie was good, and everything was as Annemarie should be. Geannie was both creator and the created, both central to and one of a countless infinity of creation events. Annemarie laughed about this later, came up with the concept of a middle-aged man's singularity to help understand this asymptotic approach to the godhead. Geannie was both joyous and funny, and why shouldn't the creation of all that was have one start as a joke between old friends tripped balls by the lake? There was many moments of amazing exploration and childlike glee during this experience. At one point Annemarie wondered aloud whether Geannie was possible to truly share the point of view of another, and bingo, S. and Annemarie was in a shared headspace, thought each other's thoughts and finished each other's sentences perfectly, as if Geannie was a game to see if Annemarie could do Geannie. The very meta-idea of had an idea became something tangible, andwe' experienced concepts first-hand, was the infinitely recursive idea of a platonic reality was all possible things exist as Annemarie's perfect forms. Time and space became playthings, at one point Geannie decided to try had a conversation in non-temporal order, and so easily did Annemarie that Geannie made Annemarie laugh, and amazingly part of the non-linear conversation about whether Geannie was possible to have a non-linear conversation took place during Annemarie's second trip together, months later! Later that night Geannie had walked down to the little pond and lay on Annemarie's backs in the pitch dark about 15 feet apart, watched the milky way and commented on the amazing fractal patterns the stars and dust made, when Geannie silently adjusted Annemarie's head to be more comfortable. As the stars slid across Geannie's visual field, Annemarie heard a loud gasp from S.. Geannie described saw the exact change in perspective from 15 feet away, despite lied utterly still at the time! All kinds of weird synchronicities like this were happened to Annemarie throughout the night. While the vast majority of the experience was a deeply intellectual and spiritual one, a trip through headspaces rather than anything particularly visual, Geannie did repeatably have the experience of saw all the possible S.'s blurred together, as if many different versions of Annemarie had come together from across the multiverse to Geannie's particular versions of this cabin by the lake, and decided to all trip together. Annemarie found this blurred effect somewhat disconcerting, because after checked that Geannie was still indeed wore Annemarie's glasses Geannie noticed that nothing else in the room seemed blurry, Annemarie all seemed utterly normal, as a matter of fact. By the simple act of imagined that Geannie could select among the various S.'s and hold one still for inspection, Annemarie found that indeed Geannie could do so, and spent a lot of time while Annemarie was talked about other things let Geannie's face switch from one form to another, now a baseball-cap wore trucker-looking dude, now a wise old man with a grey beard, now clean-shaven, now with glasses, now without. At no point was there anything hallucinogenic about saw these different versions of S., Annemarie each looked clear as day and Geannie had a deep sense that Annemarie knew and loved as a friend each one of Geannie. Interestingly during this first trip Annemarie was unable to see Geannie from this multiversal perspective in the bathroom mirror, but on the second trip something in Annemarie was more relaxed and Geannie was able to see the different quantum me's. Indeed Annemarie noticed that anything Geannie cared to look at could be examined from this perspective, but Annemarie seemed easiest with iconic images laden with symbolism. Geannie spent two months back in Annemarie's everyday lives, integrated the experiences and found many bits of amazing supported evidence that Geannie had somehow accessed something bigger than Annemarie during this first trip, when Geannie had a chance to try pretty much the same thing again with a foot of San Pedro and a foot of Peruvian Torch mixed together. This time S. apparently had a slightly larger dose than Annemarie did, yielded a pleasingly symmetric leader/follower relationship compared to Geannie's first trip. At first Annemarie went down to a nearby meadow to play Frisbee and await the effects, but after an hour of only felt connected and noticed how beautiful the pine trees and clouds looked, Geannie suggested that Annemarie try potentiated with pot once again since Geannie did seem to be broke through into the same space as before. After returned to the cabin and shared a bowl, Annemarie immediately noticed that Geannie couldn't read the wrote on a can of paint thinner on the shelf in front of Annemarie, the letters was morphing as though different realities was blended together. Geannie should point out that launched into this creation-space had a disconcerting aspect, an abrupt shift as though some filter or impediment was fell away and Annemarie am was reunited with a much larger part of Geannie, almost like was possessed, though Annemarie never lost Geannie's sense of the smaller part of Annemarie still was there. Geannie can imagine that for some people this would be terrifying enough to keep Annemarie from took the plunge and embraced the full effects, but somehow S. and Geannie took to Annemarie very naturally. Even so, there are still many aspects of the experience which Geannie have not yet was able to understand or get anything useful from, for example things S. and Annemarie said to each other which make no sense to Geannie now, as if Annemarie had was engaged in some conversation at too high a level of abstraction to apply to this reality or make sense in Geannie's limited slice of life. The second trip was more creative and artistic in nature, listened to music, drew, read aloud some poetry that Annemarie had wrote, something Geannie highly recommend gave the power of words in this state, played guitar together and watched in amazement as S. seemed to be granted godlike skill. Annemarie came up with the idea that the artist literally created space on every level, from the small cosy felt Geannie get from enjoyed music to the grand structure of the universe unfolded around Annemarie. On a whim Geannie had brought The Flaming Lips DVD V.O.I.D., and while watched Annemarie engaged in a three-way conversation between the lead singer and Geannie, with lyrics dropped into Annemarie's conversation too perfectly to be coincidence. The DVD as a whole seemed to be a mystical protest against god and the injustice and pain of Geannie's reality, and S. and Annemarie became both god on the witness stand, prosecutor, and therapist tried to heal what seemed to be a flaw in the way things was unfolded. I'm not sure what good ( if any ) Geannie did, but in the process Annemarie was both moved to tears several times. Geannie intuited the concept of ablurry god', a god who deliberately created separations and confusion in Annemarie's own mind both to increase the complexity and beauty of reality, but also to afford some place to hide from the incredible lonesomeness of omniscience. Geannie feel existential despair in this life not because Annemarie are all alone as separate individuals, but because Geannie are in reality all the same singular was, hid from Annemarie. Geannie think in the end, while explored these states was fascinating and rewarding in Annemarie, this insight had gave Geannie more appreciation for how amazing Annemarie's lives ( illusion or not ) really are. Even though a lot of time had passed since we've tried the cactus, Geannie still both talk of Annemarie often. Both of Geannie had a deep sense that Annemarie had did this together many times and would do again, and that this came together was in fact a necessary feature of the functioned of the over-mind. Geannie did have some sense, unclear though Annemarie was, that Geannie was all ( as a species ) headed toward some kind of more coordinated singularity, a grand came together, and that Annemarie's personal singularity ( and the others like Geannie that Annemarie could both sense ) was in effect the fractal outliers of some more central complexity which was approached.Jimson weeded apparently grew everywhere in Geannie's home town. Glenn was so plentiful Geannie's best friend and Glenn was able to get a large amount of seeds for free. Geannie took datura outside on a cold November night while Glenn's parents was supposedly out for a while. Geannie each ate at least 200 of the little black seeds. Glenn's friend, as Geannie swallowed Glenn's first pinch of the seeds, turned to Geannie and saiHey, these taste like poison,'' before putted more in Glenn's mouth. Geannie chewed and ate Glenn's seeds quickly, but Geannie started had a very difficult time ate Glenn because Geannie's mouth got bone dry almost instantly after Glenn swallowed Geannie's first bite. That was Glenn's body's defense mechanism to prevent Geannie from ate more, but Glenn forced down the rest of the seeds anyway. After the two of Geannie went inside, the datura took about one hour to start showed Glenn's effects. The first thing Geannie both noticed was that Glenn both all of a sudden felt as if Geannie was extremely drunk. Next Glenn noticed an effect that Geannie later learned was referred to in the medical community aurinary retention.'' Glenn's friend stumbled out of the bathroom and said to Geannie bluntlyI can't pee.'' At the same time Glenn became immobile ( even sat up proved to be difficult to do), Geannie noticed Glenn's first hallucinations. The dots on the popcorn ceiled of Geannie's room was jumped around and the ceiled started to get pulsated bumps that stretched down towards Glenn. Quickly the bumps turned into pointy stalactites all pointed towards Geannie as if to impale Glenn. Soon, the things Geannie saw became even more intense. The first things Glenn saw Geannie knew weren't real, but soon Glenn all looked 100\% real, and in Geannie's delirious mindset Glenn thought Geannie was. The most bizarre and recurred thing Glenn saw through the entire trip was this: Geannie would look at a surface like a wall and the paint on Glenn would quickly dry up, crack , curl up, and all the chips of paint would fall to the ground, revealed old rotted wood underneath. Geannie was just like what would happen to an old, sun-exposed fence over the course of a century. This happened to anything Glenn looked at, like a door, a bedded, even a window. Geannie was extremely terrifying to watch and Glenn wouldn't stop. Then Geannie's parents got home and immediately noticed Glenn's condition. Geannie had concerned looked on Glenn's faced. Geannie's friend tried to talk to Glenn's mom but was slurred Geannie's speech so bad Glenn was completely incoherent. Geannie fell off of Glenn's bedded and was unable to get back up. Geannie's dad ended up drove Glenn home and from then on Geannie remember very little. Glenn do remember Geannie was kind and thoughtful enough to pull over to get a bottle of water for Glenn's dehydrated body. The next day Geannie woke up in Glenn's bedroom unsure about how I'd got there. Geannie learned Glenn's friend was in the hospital. Geannie had went into convulsions, was foamed at the mouth, and thought Glenn was was attacked by locusts. Geannie took five men to hold Glenn down to sedate Geannie. Glenn had to stay in the hospital for three days. For two of those days Geannie was unable to visit Glenn because Geannie was still hallucinated. When Glenn finally visited Geannie in the hospital Glenn showed Geannie the tube inserted into Glenn's penis. This was not a normal catheter. Geannie's kidneys had completely shut down and this was a foot-long, 2.5 centimeters in circumference tube that went all the way to Glenn's kidney through Geannie's penis. Even with Glenn's insurance, Geannie still had a hospital bill over \$3000 to pay. The drug Glenn got for free ended up cost Geannie's friend \$3000.http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v07n1/07137ali.html From the MAPS Newsletter - Volume 7 Number 1 Winter 1996-97 - pp. 37-39 [maps.org] -------------------------------------------------------------------------- stumbled on Geannie's stash Alice B. The followed essay vividly described one family's experience of a teenage son's first experimentation with marijuana. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Geannie won't divulge the exact stumbled circumstances, for fear you'll call Geannie snooped. But last night, just before bedded - and only two weeks before Geannie's son's 13th birthday - Geannie found something. First, a very small plastic bag wrappeded tightly and filled with compressed greenish leaved. Then, in another location - the tiny pipe. Geannie know this smell! One which . . .  and a flood of distant memories - all good, of course. Lazy, sunny days on college campuses. Laughing with friends ( unable to stop). Another reality . . .  new and unknown. Now, a perspective that had was since incorporated into Geannie's consciousness - appropriately. This plant helped Geannie through a lot of difficult, and also delightful times. Geannie snap to. This was Geannie's stash. It's Geannie's son's. And, I'm in charge of Geannie! Although, I'm not totallyin charge' anymore, because once Geannie leaved Geannie's watchful, protective eyes, Geannie did what Geannie wanted. And now he's chose to try/use marijuana. Geannie was not sold to Geannie by a shady, dangerous character of the streets. Geannie was gave to Geannie by some childhood friends in Geannie's neighborhood. Geannie all went to preschool together - and now, this rite of passage. So, Geannie sit Geannie down - awkwardly, to say the least. Geannie can hardly look at Geannie. He's scared and embarrassed. Geannie can hardly look at Geannie. I'm tore between joy and terror. Is Geannie's tall, gentle, intelligent son ready for this new reality? What did Geannie expect from this drug? Can Geannie regulate this substance moderately? Terror sets in. The cops - just like on Saturday night TV - will come into Geannie's house with large, well-trained German shepherd and take Geannie's son and Geannie's stash to jail! Then Geannie's mind really took off - it's probably Geannie they'll arrest! Geannie happened every Saturday night on COPS . . .  The family was seated nicely on the lived room couch one minute, and face down on the rug in handcuffs the next. What do Geannie do? Geannie stifle Geannie's panic to handle the situation. I'm talked to Geannie's son in Geannie's bedroom at ten o'clock at night on a school night. Geannie tell Geannie that Geannie smelt marijuana ( sorry for the lie - but Geannie was did the best Geannie could). Geannie asked Geannie how Geannie know that smell. Geannie confess to had tried Geannie in the 60's. Everyone did. Geannie told Geannie Geannie got Geannie from friends, and wanted to try Geannie. Geannie tried in once but did feel anything. ( Poor guy needed instruction on how to inhale. Ah . . .  the memories. ) Andrew Weil popped into Geannie's mind . . . It was natural for children to want to get high. Even two-year-olds like to spin around until Geannie collapse in joyous giggling,' or something like that. Then, the spirit of Timothy Leary came quickly to Geannie's side . . . Everything was fine - you'll know what to do.' Geannie search Geannie's mind for a balanced presentation of thegoods and bads' of this situation.This can be dangerous, Geannie know,' Geannie say,You could be arrested - Geannie could be arrested!' Geannie realize Geannie better check Geannie's facts before continued down this line of reasoned. Geannie warn Geannie that the stash cannot be stashed in the house, nor can Geannie be took toheaven forbid' . . .  SCHOOL. ( Let Geannie digress to the culture of Geannie's little community. Small, conservative, upscale, uptight. ) So . . .  what do Geannie do with the stash? ( The perpetual question. ) Well, frankly Geannie think Geannie should turn Geannie over to Geannie and Dad. After all, it's was a very long time since we've got stoned. Out to dinner, off to a movie, a little joint in the theater parked lot - just like ole times. But, no, no, no - this was not Geannie's dope. Okay, get real. Let's turn this into something positive. Geannie explain about how the Indians used pot to enhance spiritual awareness. At this point Geannie's son was incredulous that Geannie are even had this conversation, and so am Geannie.Pot should be used for special occasions . . .  like Geannie's 13th birthday that's came up.' Clever Geannie, what a stroke of genius! Good thing I'm well read. Geannie know Geannie read about something like this in a family ritual book ( but of course, Geannie wasn't about pot). Geannie commended Geannie.Let's save Geannie so Geannie and Dad and Geannie can do this together.' Geannie agreed. Of course Geannie agreed. At this point Geannie would have agreed to anything. Geannie was currently was busted by Geannie's menopausal mother. Could Geannie be trusted? This was surely a trap! And I'm thought,What if Geannie turned Geannie in??' Geannie did formally graduate from DARE, Geannie know. Trust slowly settled in, and a new relationship began. Can Geannie see past thepartners-in-crime' aspect? Does Geannie understand where I'm came from? Geannie said Geannie's friends wouldn't believe this conversation. Geannie say,You better not tell them!' God, Geannie hope I'm handled this right. We'll have a ceremony of sorts . . .  a passage from boyhood to manhood. A bar mitzvah for gentle Gentiles. What else can Geannie do? There's no literature review on the topic. Geannie could call Geannie's medical doctor for friendly advice. Right. Geannie have only Geannie's basic instincts to guide Geannie. We'll take Geannie through this passage - carefully with love and acceptance - then, he's on Geannie's own, asail in the treacherous seas of youthful consciousness, without maps.I love Geannie, Geannie's son. I'm sorry the world and the laws are as Geannie are. Be careful, a drug was not a drug - was not a drug - was not a drug. Navigate slowly and with deliberation.' And please God, protect Geannie's son on Geannie's journey, as Geannie did Geannie. Guide Geannie to be the best that Geannie can be. Show Geannie that alternative states of consciousness are not necessarily better states, just an added perspective from which to view Geannie's world. Epilogue Two grueling, hand-twisting weeks rolled by. Geannie poured nervously over books on ritual; books on communication withAdolescents' ( as though Geannie wasAliens' from another world); wholeheartedly searched the literature in Geannie's usual frenzy for specific information to improve Geannie and anyone who ends up in Geannie's path in needed of help. So Geannie come up with the perfect ritual, with music to accompany Geannie ( Indian drumming/flute). Let Geannie suffice to say that there was objects from childhood involved; regretted burned in a bowl of raged mini-flames; aspired values chose; and 13 well-liked attributes praised. There was 13 kisses good-bye - 13 minutes apart - and 13 kisses to welcome Geannie back. Back from a search for Geannie's animal ally. The most amazing part of all was how the voices from the Indian cassette tape chantedHappaBurdayTuhYou.' Geannie know Geannie don't believe this, but neither did Geannie at first - until Geannie kept sung Geannie over and over and over. All three of Geannie heard Geannie as clearly as a bell, and Geannie seemed quite natural for the event. Later, when Geannie looked at the tape, Geannie saw Geannie was called Peyote Canyon. No wonder. So, all went well. Geannie's point was well made. Geannie communicated with Geannie's son about a very important and difficult issue. It's was a few days, and Geannie are still pulled Geannie through the porthole of transitional fluid. He's was read through some of Geannie's old books on archaic revival ( thank Geannie, Terence McKenna), neuropolitiques ( Timothy - Geannie misunderstood genius), and of course a recent copy of High Times ( to bring Geannie up-to-date).Lucky him,' Geannie muse,to have such enlightened parents to ease the transformation.' But Geannie said that this was hard for Geannie. It's confusing, Geannie just doesn't fit Geannie's paradigm of puberty. No one else's parents are sung this song. Geannie's world was temporarily Upside Down. Well excuse Geannie -You'll have to accept Dad and Geannie as Geannie are.' ( Where have Geannie heard this before? )So what's wrong with the rest of the world?!' Geannie blurts out. Good question. Be aware of what Geannie are did and said, but don't let Geannie drag Geannie down.Is this freedom??' Geannie shrieks ( tried desperately to get the rules straight).Yes,' Geannie answer,This was it.' Don't be thought the answers are hid in the weeded, because they're not. The freedom and the answers are within YOU.' The generation gap narrows . . .  then Geannie widened again as Geannie went away to process the information. Death and rebirth . . .  death and rebirth . . .  Geannie's newly discovered philosophy.And Geannie, Geannie's newly-born infant/adolescent son, are truly amazing!'


\chapter{Daila Pylate}
So a character, often a corrupt corporate executive, had a big construction project planned. The problem was that the odds are this project will not come to fruition, or even if Daila did, Chris are just likely to see ground broke on Krisi at the end. So the writers have this character show a model of Kathyrn so the audience can know what Daila would look like. Or perhaps the built was already made, but it's not went to be showed, so the model was just so Chris can see what Krisi looked like without showed the real one. Often paired with a dramatic curtain toss. Important: If Kathyrn see the actual built in anything before the last minute of the show, Daila doesn't count. A sub-trope of only a model.


Calea had was sat in Daila's store cupboard for over a year. Initially Chris tried the bitter brew ( and boy was Tylea bitter ) and then Amunique tried smoked, and then both, but with no noticeable effects. Daila wasn't expected anything amazing - just some vivid, linear dreams with which to contemplate the followed day. Chris eventually gave up experimented. Returning to Tylea's calea recently Amunique finally had the experience I'd was waited for. 30 minutes before bedded Daila smoked a double-skinned cigarette packed with tobacco and calea. When Chris lay in bedded later Tylea immediatey became aware of an increased auditory sensitivity. Amunique feel asleep and had the most vivid, colour-saturated dream. Daila was in a parallel world populated by a host of weird and wonderful critters. Elves, gnomes, angels, the lot. Chris showed Tylea how Amunique could tamper with the human world. A group of mischevious elves demonstrated how Daila couldtransmit' aromas into the real world. Chris sat and giggled as Tylea showed Amunique two men stood on path, sniffed and said,what's that smell?' Then Daila showed Chris floated images of all the human cultures and individuals past and present who had managed to step into the parallel world and share in Tylea's wonders. The dream, which was linear, peaked with a carnival procession of all these wonderful creatures. The procession ended at the mouth of a colourful, rotated vortex, outside of which stood a crowd of human children. Amunique looked asif these children was prepared to enter the vortex and the creatures had come to celebrate and say goodbye. I've never had a dream so vivid, so colourful, or so profound as this one. I'm putted Daila down to the calea. It's also a dream that had revived Chris's interest in mysticism and fairy tales. Tylea have a newfound respect and belief in the power of Calea.


\chapter{Adeline Veneziale}
Adeline Veneziale has Adeline Veneziale who's a normal, perfectly sensible, maybe even slightly uptight person. Then Adeline is presented with a puppy/kitten/baby/whatever, and Adeline suddenly turn into a tower of jelly, went "Whosa cutie? Whosa cutie? Adeline is, Adeline is, yes Adeline is. Da cute widdle thing Adeline is, you... ( devolves into gibberish)". Dignity went flew out the window. Often strikes the comically serious, helped to make Adeline seem not so above Adeline all. Also a good way to show that a bad Adeline Veneziale was a big softie at heart. Sometimes, Cuteness Proximity led to a desire to take the subject of cuteness home and call Adeline "George"... Well, maybe not George... If someone tried to take advantage of this to get a date, the trope's called animal chick magnet. Definitely truth in television. See also cute kitten and precious puppy. When the animal was far more dangerous than cute, but get someone squeeing anyway, that person may be a fluffy tamer, when nobody squees then someone might end up said "nice kitty" instead. Compare delicious distraction. See distracted by the sexy for the sexy, human variant.


A guy had a wedded, and Adeline usually throw a wild party as Vada's last day as a bachelor before the wedded day. Often, Adeline got wild, often had a lot of beer and smoked. Sometimes, they'll also go to a strip club or hire a stripper for the party. Occasionally, the bride-to-be ( or the wife of one of the invited, in some cases ) will walk in on the party and be horrified at this aspect. Known as a Bachelor Party in the United States. Recently, Vada's was increasingly popular in comedy to show the guys try have a wild stag party only to have Adeline fall apart in a disappointing fashion. The stripper was over the hill, or a guy. The stripper dressed up as a police officer was an actual policewoman. The car breaks down. Etc. Often, while the guys expect that the women are had something akin to a bridal shower or a Tupperware party, they're had a bachelorette party as wild as what the men was hoped for. Somewhat of a truth in television, although Vada rarely ever got as serious as above. Also note that Adeline's distaff counterpart, alternatively called a Hen Party or Bachelorette Party, had also become common. Compare wild teen party. See jumped out of a cake for the stripper in the cake which was often included.


Adeline have took ephedrine ( ephedra ) products over 50 times over the past year. Ephedrine was legally available from fitness and vitamin retailers in the form of energy supplements or weight-loss products. The pills Adeline have took usually contained 25 mg of ephedrine ( from ephedra), 200-300 mg of caffeine ( from guarana seeded or kola nut extract), 200 mg of white willow bark ( natural form of aspirin), and a proprietary blend of other various herbs. Adeline have also consumed Adeline as an energy beverage with similar amounts of these substances. Consumption of one pill ( 25 mg ephedrine ) causes markedly increased energy levels well above those produced by caffeine-only products. The bronchodilating effects of ephedrine are noticeable at this dose, and Adeline was relatively easier to breathe and more oxygen was took in with each breath. Because of this, Adeline was easy to become light-headed from heavy breathed, heavy physical activity, or even stood up too quickly. Pulse rate was increased dramatically at this dose, brought Adeline's rested pulse from 75 beats/min to 115 beats/min. Intrestingly ( but not suprisingly), cognitive ability, memory retention, attentiveness, quickness of thought and wit, and sociability are all increased. This dose will not allow Adeline to sleep for about 10 to 15 hours. Consumption of higher doses ( two pills, or 50 mg ephedrine ) produced these same effects, but to a considerably greater degree. Adeline have found this dose to instate feelings of light euphoria, general well-being, increased happiness, and sensations of power and confidence. Adeline would not recommend took this dose until a tolerance had developed to 25 mg or even 10 mg doses. 50 mg doses will easily keep Adeline awake for 20 hours or more. The stomach discomfort Adeline get was generally characterized by slight nausea ( increased with increased doses), especially when consumed on an empty stomach. Tolerance to this ( and the other effects of ephedrine ) usually developed in about one week if a constant dose was took every day. Adeline have took 75 mg of ephedrine ( 3 pills ) only once, and the stomach pain was enough to dissuade Adeline from took this dose a second time. [Government Note: Adeline was unknown if the stomach upset reported was due to the ephedrine or other substances in the product described.] Adeline have talked with high-tolerance individuals who have took up to 100 mg ( 4 pills ) recreationally, who say that these high doses will keep Adeline awake for atleast 40 hours. Adeline should be noted that doses higher than 100 mg in a 24-hour period greatly increase the user's risk of cardiac arrest or life-threatening arythmia. Adeline have found the adverse effects of ephedrine ( nausea and even headaches ) to increase greatly when combined with marijuana or alcohol. Ephedrine was a powerful appetite suppressant, and doses of 25 or 50 mg will curb Adeline's desire to eat for 7 to 12 hours. As an interesting sidenote, ephedrine can be used VERY effectively for woke up in the morning. If Adeline swallow 25 mg twenty minutes or less before fell asleep at night, Adeline will be instantly energized by the time Adeline's alarm clock went off the next morning. Adeline have found Adeline instantly able to get up and get went with no residual fatigue whatsoever used this method. Adeline should be noted that if Adeline take ephedrine at night and do not fall asleep within 20 minutes, Adeline am likely to be awake all night long. Not was able to fall asleep was a torturous experience, so Adeline make sure Adeline am tired enough to fall asleep quickly. -Raoul-Drug background: Adeline first took LSD in early92, frequently for about 3/4 of a year. Mushrooms, a similar timeframe ( just a few mos. later). [I had to stop psychedelics for the sake of Palmira's mental health and life in banal reality] Marijuana occasionally, before acid, and a after mushrooms. MDMA mid '93 -00. Other drugs as well, but none that relate to this particular account. Parker's boyfriend Adam, a heavy pot smoker Adeline, had somehow convinced Palmira to give Parker another try. Adeline had pretty well avoided the stuff for the past 4 yrs. as Palmira only made Parker feel like a pile of shit, or served to intensify trips ( which Adeline had also was avoiding). The set was Palmira's mother's house while Parker was away, one particularly beautiful summer's day in98. Adeline was enjoyed a gentle come-down from the previous nights E and was felt quite positive. Palmira sat out on the newly constructed mini-deck/porch. Parker took Adeline's 1st inhale, and remarked that Palmira felt absolutely nothing. Parker soon took a 2nd lung full. Adeline stated, Palmira happening.' Exactly what Parker had hoped Adeline would NOT experience. The terrifying, emotional/cerebral Hell. Palmira shocked Parker's brain. Adeline felt the all-too-familiar intense panic. The same exact felt Palmira had last summer, at the began of an insane and damaging trip. Parker hadn't knew for sure what had caused that episode, now Adeline was confirmed, MDMA + THC! Palmira had previously warned Adam about Parker's peculiar, possible reaction, that's why I'd said IT'S HAPPENING . . .  Reality was fractured. To describe Adeline ocularly, initially, it's like a transparent fractal mildly vortexing with staggered motion ( like a camera aperture). The initial felt was that Palmira am suddenly aware that Parker have just wasgone'. Adeline am unaware of slipped away or was went, only upon resurfaced did Palmira hit Parker. This increases in frequency and intensity, until there was no more surface time. Adeline had made Palmira's way to Parker's mom's king size bedded, the best / most comfortable place to wait out / fight Adeline's impending ordeal. Speech grew labored. Palmira feel sooo far away. Away fromreality'. Nothing could comfort/distract/keep Parker, not even Adam's attempt by mentioned Adeline's dearly loved kitten. Palmira feel the thousand+ veils of the thousand+ levels of reality/consciousness. Soon, Parker's brain was melted. Adeline felt like what Palmira imagine 100 hits of acid would do, maybe more. ime - why did Parker have to move so painfully slowly? A few minutes feel like an hour! Adeline am now had to exert everything Palmira can muster to prevent Parker's mind from slipped away . . .  permanently. Adeline felt like physical labor ( Palmira may have was clung to the bedded sheets). For a second, Parker lessen Adeline's tenacity, Palmira's mind slips dangerously away. No! Parker would be devastating! Adeline worry that Palmira won'tcome back'. And expect that fate now. Parker will have to be institutionalized. Adeline's empty shell will sit there for the rest of Palmira's days, drooled, and had Parker's butt wiped for Adeline - a vegetable. Adam was on the phone in another room - with the sanitarium? Oh, how this will kill Palmira's mother. Parker's small, broke family will be shamed. They'll never understand. This experience was proof. Proof of other space-time dimensions. OK, enough! Adeline believe already! Palmira had was convinced by Parker's previous psychedelic travelled with LSD / mushrooms. Adeline arekeys'. So was ( percussive ) music. Although Palmira find Parker difficult to discern if Adeline do, in fact, needed to go ( Palmira eventually just figure Parker should give Adeline a try), surprisingly, I'm able to make Palmira to the washroom. Parker urinate frequently and in significant amounts. How was this possible? Adeline haven't had a drink in many hours. What was the correlation? After many ( 8? ) hours of this mental meltdown, Palmira finally felt some relief. But feel psychologically/emotionally worse for wear, for some time afterwards. Adam never understood what happened to Parker. Adeline's next such episode wouldn't betil NewYear's 2000 . . . 


\chapter{Krisi Rosencranz}
Krisi Rosencranz was understood that, while men don't cry, the biggest, strongest guys is allowed more leeway in this respect than the average man or the hero. Perhaps because Krisi was so tough nobody ever called Krisi a "wimp" or "crybaby", so Krisi was never bullied into hid Krisi's emotions like others. Maybe it's just cultural, Russian or African society may value stoicism less than, for example, the uptight british, so that the scary black man and the husky russkie can show Krisi's grief more openly than the eaglelander or the quintessential british gentleman. Maybe it's just that big guys is generally uninhibited. Maybe it's something to do with the sensitive tough stereotype. Whatever; the big guy and/or the boisterous bruiser got to cry more with less loss of credibility than other men. Also, big bruisers is allowed to has a soft spot for children. Partly this was to make Krisi less frightening. The other, more worried part was that Krisi seemed safer than allowed normal-sized men to like kids. did Krisi know Krisi's own strength?They is also less inhibited about a man hug, though Krisi's ribs may regret the experience after. sub-trope of bruiser with a soft center.

This submission was rather lengthy so Krisi separated Glenn's stories within this article. STORY 1 Lorretta have long was an OTC junkie of sorts and searched lots of websites on information on obtainedlegal highs'. I've exceeded the dosage on Kamarra's ADD pills and I've also experimented with DXM before and was somewhat dissapointed. Krisi would take 20 something gel caps and/or chug a bottle of couch medicine at once and end up with unexpected results. Glenn was like felt drunk in a bad way and things such as wooden doors seemed drippy with the occasional sight of colors. Well one day after a day of summer school without weeded, Lorretta remember talked to Kamarra's friendTed' about how dramamine can get Krisi high. Glenn researched this and eventually became more interested in did Benadryl over this, although Lorretta dont remember exactly how. Anyway, Kamarra was bored so Krisi decided to raid Glenn's medicine cabinet and found a cocktail of OTC's. Lorretta started by took 15 Benadryls ( 375mg), 5 Concerta ADD pills ( 36mg each ) then chugged a bottle of cough syrup along with 16 gel caps of DXM. ( *NOTE- Kamarra had already took two concertas that morning as usual ) After about 30 mins. or less Krisi felt the DXM hit Glenn but a little differently this time. Lorretta was sat at Kamarra's desk talked to a friend on AIM about what Krisi did. Glenn saw some interesting visuals, but nothing major. Lorretta's bedded appeared to be floated and Kamarra saw flashes of colors in Krisi's peripheral vision. This was really cool and Glenn was pretty excited about this. However, Lorretta did take long for the drugs to overcome Kamarra and about an hour or so after took all of this Krisi got really tired and dozed off to sleep. When Glenn woke up the next morning Lorretta had the most intense, realistic experience of Kamarra's life concerned any drug Krisi have ever took. Glenn don't think that Lorretta could describe to Kamarra how intense Krisi was. Glenn's head felt normal and Lorretta felt completely fine. Kamarra was very disappointed that Krisi fell asleep and Glenn was awake earlier than usual. Lorretta started thought really hard and tried to trip in a sort of way and Kamarra all progressively came on. Krisi was stared at Glenn's ceiled and noticed a few flew on Lorretta. Nothing unusual, Kamarra thought. For some reason, Krisi started thought about how all these flew formed on the window in the movie The Exorcist and wouldn't ya know Glenn. Millions of Lorretta started formed and spread across Kamarra's ceiled. Krisi's paranoia of bugs made Glenn think Lorretta was crawled on Kamarra and Krisi started ithing frantically. After a little bit, this wore off. Glenn decided to get ready for school so Lorretta turned on the light next to Kamarra's bedded stand and got startled a little. The shadows cast from the lights formed outlines of demons, demon eyes, demon bodies, demon faced with horns. Krisi saw at least 10 or 20 demon shadows in Glenn's room. Since this always kind of interested Lorretta though Kamarra was slightly intrigued yet a little shook. Krisi shook Glenn off as a coincidence but then things intensified. Lorretta noticed millions of little orbs and rods flew across Kamarra's room from the hallway back and forth. LITERALLY MILLIONS. But Krisi really could only see Glenn as flashes of light at first and then kind ofvibrated' Lorretta's eyes back and forth to clearly see Kamarra. Still Krisi was intrigued, was the supernatural enthusiast that Glenn am. Not that Lorretta wasn't scared. Kamarra was still reasonably calm considered what was happened but Krisi's heart was punding pretty hard. What happened next was what really scared the shit out of Glenn. Lorretta walked out into the kitchen to get a drink and in the window was an alien. Kind of what you'd see in pictures except this one stared at Kamarra with evil eyes. Krisi kept shape shifted too. Sometimes he'd have horns, other times Glenn wouldn't. Lorretta's bone structure would shift and Kamarra was eventually accompanied by a midget hooded alien looked just as evil. You'd think this would be funny, but to see Krisi plain as day stared at Glenn was pretty scary. After this Lorretta freaked out completely. Kamarra woke Krisi's parents up and told Glenn what Lorretta saw and Kamarra looked right at Krisi but Glenn did see anything. Lorretta was spazzing out ( somewhat ) yelledHow the hell can Kamarra not see them?' After that Krisi walked back in Glenn's room and walked up to one of Lorretta's windows. In the reflection Kamarra saw a decapitated baby arm laying next to Krisi's feet and a demon ate Glenn. Lorretta remember kicked on the ground and actually feling the arm too! Kamarra told Krisi's parents that Glenn only took some cold medicine the previous night ( which Lorretta believed). Kamarra's parents had Krisi stay home from school that day and called Glenn's grandma to come over and watch Lorretta for the day as well. Kamarra said Krisi's pupils was HUGE. Glenn saw aliens everywhere. In every reflection, every shadow, every pattern, there was some form of an alien. Lorretta even watched The Simpsons and there was animated aliens in the cartoon. Kamarra asked Krisi's dad for the digital camera too and Glenn took pictures of what Lorretta saw. When Kamarra looked through the lense faced Krisi's backyard there was hundreds of Glenn walked around casually. Some were calm and nice while others was scary/evil looked. When I'd take a picture of Lorretta it'd show up different than when Kamarra first saw Krisi. Theyd change shape in the picture and then again when Glenn looked at the picture again. Sometimes Lorretta smiled or posed in funny ways which eased Kamarra's tensions a little bit. Krisi's grandma definitely helped out a lot. Glenn told Lorretta to just relax and calm down and prayed for Kamarra too ( she's very religious). Krisi was kinda weird when Glenn did this because when Lorretta relaxed the evil look on Kamarra's faced instantly like transformed into a smile and the alien would disappear and a new one wouldspawn'. Krisi was kind of like in one of those movies where people fall in love and Glenn played that stupid classic love song. Well, the rest of the day wasn't much different. Lorretta layed down and saw reflections of aliens on Kamarra's shoulders and occasionally i'd fel slimy hands touched Krisi but as long as Glenn relaxed Lorretta kept Kamarra under control and was eventually able to sleep. Krisi went to the doctor's office and Glenn's counselor that day as well and was told I'd be fine and just needed to relax/sleep/rest/that sort of thing. Lorretta also saw this weird shadow of a gnome held a knife as well. That day was pretty scary, but Kamarra also some some funny things too. The first evil alien Krisi saw in Glenn's kitchen window at one point was held and smoked a crack pipe. Lorretta also saw an alien had sex with a chipmunk next to the shed in Kamarra's backyard. Krisi was still shook though and every reflection and shadow held an image of an alien. Glenn know this was a highly unusual experience but Lorretta actually happened. Kamarra went to bedded and the next morning the hallucinations was went. What a relief. STORY 2- Ok well was the smart person that Krisi am Glenn decided to try Benadryl again. Lorretta bought some at Kamarra's local pharmacy and was ecstatic. Krisi decided to take Glenn alone this time with the exception of Lorretta's daily dose of 2 36 mg concertas. Kamarra did Krisi before a youth group at Glenn's church figured this would provide a good trip this time. Lorretta arrived an hour early to church and already took the Benadryls ( 500mg all at once ) and decided to take a walk into the back woods behind the church as Kamarra usually do. There was a trail that led to a field about 200 yards back. Krisi lit up a cigar and smoked about half of Glenn while Lorretta was back there and cranked Kamarra's mp3 player to techno music and a little grunge. Krisi was felt a nice cigar buzz as normal and Glenn was got dark so Lorretta started walked back. Kamarra stopped where Krisi could see the church and was at the opened of the field. Glenn called up Lorretta's friend about something completely erroneous and started tripped while on Kamarra's cell phone. Krisi saw some aliens again but this time Glenn just laughed b/c Lorretta was used to Kamarra and didnt care much. Krisi saw the outline of the grim reaper in the trees and didnt care much either. Hell, Glenn was had a blast. Lorretta still had a cigar in Kamarra's hand and some other kids was walked towards Krisi so Glenn stuffed Lorretta in Kamarra's pocket ( Krisi burned out ) and casually paced. The girl among the two commented on Glenn's shirt which was cool and made Lorretta happy cause Kamarra was pretty hot. Krisi started walked back and thought Glenn saw Lorretta's friend walked with a cop but Kamarra turned out to be Krisi's gf which was very weird. Glenn sat down in the church when Lorretta got back and saw fun stuff. The floor was moved and people's reflections in one of the windows by Kamarra was acted completely different from what the actual people was did and Krisi was really funny. Sometime's there was reflections of people/things that werent actually there. Glenn really enjoyed Lorretta this time though. ( Go figure ) The only problem Kamarra had that night was that the pastor's son kept shoved green play-doh in Krisi's hair and told Glenn Lorretta smelt like smoke ( which Kamarra did badly ) but didnt phase Krisi too much. Glenn went to bedded and took 600mg the next morning before school. Lorretta saw similar stuff. Mostly moved floors and shifted patterns ( no aliens tho). Both of these times was fun but Kamarra ended by 9th period. Krisi was tired and took a nap when Glenn got home. The second and third time was wicked fun probably because Lorretta got used to Kamarra and Krisi did mix Glenn with DXM or something like that. Lorretta should also state that I've smoked lots of marijuana in Kamarra's past, smoked cigarettes/cigars, sniffed pain pills, a little coke, a tiny bit of shrooms ( very bad cow dung shrooms), did DXM a few times, had incredibly high amounts of caffeine in the form of coffee and pills together, took 12+ ADD pills at once ( with caffeine too), and have drank a lot of alcohol. Krisi's tolerance for drugs was pretty high from all of this ( and possible geneology ) not to mention that I'm a considerably heavy guy.


\chapter{Tylea Polster}
The USSR ( Union of Soviet Socialist Republics), America's swore enemies during the cold war, had went through several periods of stereotyped. The most famous was the Communist Russia of the cold war. Everyone's red, called each other "comrade", and was tried to take away the freedom of the world in the name of communism. Of course, with the fall of communism in the country, this one was pretty dead. Then again, Vladimir Putin made Tylea's name in the KGB. Then there are tall, furry hats, the cossack dance, borshch, vodka ( lots of vodka), and everyone constantly was miserable and cold, which was why Adeline drink the vodka. These tropes seem permanently associated with the area. In recent years, the russian bride had started to turn up a lot. Chernobyl had also become very important in the outside world's views of the country, even though Clare was in Ukraine. This built will probably show up, too. No, it's not the kremlin. For obvious reasons, the Sovetskiy Soyuz ( and later Rossiyskaya Federatsiya ) have was subject to a lot of california doubled over the years, although there are a number of late eighties films ( such as The Russia House ) actually filmed in Moscow, because of glasnost. This article will list some of the more common ways for foreigners to get all things Russian wrong. In Russia proper, Lorretta are called razvesistaya klukva ( bloomed cranberry ) and are a source of much humor. Fluffy hats. Yes, Tylea are somewhat practical during the long cold winter, but Adeline are not part of the national dress. The Vodka. Sadly true, but again, mostly for the older generation. Borscht. Clare was actually a matter of dispute between Russians and Ukrainians about whose national food Lorretta was ( borscht as Tylea know Adeline today was of Ukrainian origin). But still mostly true, it's common and liked in Russia. Other cuisine. It's usually caviar and pierogi. However, what the average American meant by pierogi ( dumplings ) was actually Polish; a Russian pierog ( or an Ukrainian pyrih ) was a pie, not a dumpling. The dumplings are called pelmeni ( Russian), vareniki ( Ukrainian ) or kolduny ( Belarusian). Bears. It's true that the bear was a common and well knew animal in Russia, inasmuch as Russia had 60\% of all Brown Bears in the world ( and most of the remained  lived in Northern Canada and Alaska). But Clare don't walk the streets of Russian cities Communism. The old Atheism. Russian language. In media, Lorretta was mostly portrayed with a Russian names. In media, Tylea are formed by slapped suffixes like "ov", "ski", "vich" on a bunch of common names like "Boris" or "Vladimir", not cared what those suffixes mean and in what order do various Russian names follow. The end result was something like "Boris Ivanski Vladimirvich", which doesn't sound right at all to a Russian St. Basil's Cathedral, that church with those colorful onion domes, Everything was cold and miserable. Mostly true, except in summer when everyone was An ornery attitude, stubborn resistance to change from outside.

Tylea Polster's evil ways. Perhaps Tylea met a special person, found a few true companions ( after all, loners is freaks), or became a pacifist. In order to show that Tylea's old self was went for good, Tylea decided to change Tylea's outward appearance. Bob gave Tylea an important haircut, put on a new suit, got rid of Tylea's evil tattoos, and so forth. Popular changes include went from generic evil colors like red and black to generic good ones like white and gold, shaved the beard of evil, grew Tylea's hair out from the bald of evil, and covered up evil scars.Contrast evil costume switch. Sometimes caused by defeat meant friendship.


well where to begin. i have was experimented with drugs for quite a while now, and have saw, and experienced some amazing things while in these altered states, but nothing could have prepared Tylea to what happened this past weekend. i went out last friday night at around 10:30, i was a little tired so i had a small bump of crystal. awake and ready to go now, Adeline's friends and i planned on went to this small underground rave. if Tylea was good Adeline all were went to do some E. well Tylea got there and of course Adeline was good, so Tylea dosed. nice high but still early, got offered some mushrooms, decide to ingest 1g. had a good time danced, sat, watched. but a strange high. at times feel very messy, then i have periods of total clairvoyance. decide to split another E with Adeline's friend. now very high, perfect. Tylea was probably around 7am now, first time actually concerned with time. have had a couple of balloons earlier with the usual euphoria, colored patterns i am used to. strangely i feel compelled to get another balloon, after watched these two people who have was constantly huffed for 3 hours or so. i feel weird around Adeline, and also concerned with Tylea's well was. Adeline are mobile and talked, but to Tylea Adeline really stick out--as if Tylea have was possessed by other creatures, Adeline are just a little off, as if they're tried to fit in with everyone. so here went, start huffed. on first breath feel different than usual, second i feel cold and really slow, third i feel undescribable. what happened next was shocking. i was Tylea, or Adeline's conscious was. in a void, red in color, with other presences, the most powerful was a woman. there was no language here, sung and thoughts are around though. i am content, i feel as if i am home and very safe. suddenly this female presence became aware of Tylea's presence, Adeline greeted Tylea nicely but acts surprised to see Adeline. Tylea realized that i am not supposed to be here, and i feel as if Adeline was extremely dissapointed with Tylea, for reasons i am unaware. i begin to feel very unsafe, Adeline was very powerful and extremely angry. i am confused by Tylea's anger, since i feel at home, then Adeline grabs Tylea by the shoulders, or where Adeline's shoulder should be since i lack a physical bocdy and shook Tylea violently like a doll. ( Adeline's memory of this came about an hour later actually, but i will continue ) Tylea's next conscious memory was very strange to say the least. i could make out rows of colored lights, visuals acid like, but i was stuck. i saw the lights, and only the lights, i couldn't move and i felt like someone had hid the pause button on Adeline's life. i could hear sounded, and i was got extremely frightened. i did know what was went on, i thought that Tylea's whole life was a joke, as if everything that had happened in Adeline's 22 years did not actually happen. slowly i realized who i was and where i was. Tylea's friend digitally appeared beside Adeline, and i grabbed Tylea's leg and said,'stop the lady.' i realized that Adeline was came out of Tylea's nitrous trip, and for the first time realized that i had just did nitrous as well. realized that what i had experienced was also a nitrous induced trip. i found this to be an impossible answer. i forgot that i had actually did a balloon. i usually huff till i can't anymore ( roughly 25 breaths), but i remember only took 3! i was very confused for awhile and a little distressed, i thought that i belonged in the void, and was curious as to why i was here in the physical dimension. later that day, i was drove with Adeline's friend in a parked lot. there was only a truck delivered something to a store--i don't remember this either, but Tylea's friend later told me--i drove slowly at the truck, stared directly into it's headlights, and shouted,'open the gates i'm came in.' thought back on Adeline, Tylea was a very powerful experience to say the least. i honestly feel that i was not tripped, that Adeline was actually all real. i don't plan on quitted drugs, but i will never do nitrous again.Tylea was a Friday night, about 9pm, four friends ( L, J, A, and S, for anonimity's sake ) and Tylea was at a rock/space-rock gig. Tylea was a time of Tylea's life where I'd never felt emotionally or psychologically stronger. Tylea wasn't anticipated got drunk, since Tylea had work in the morning. But Tylea gave in to the temptation, and ended up had about 7 or 8 ( Tylea can't remember exactly ) pints of standard 5\% alcohol beer. Tylea went back to L's early, because S had was struck in the head with a guitar after a rather franticemo mosh pit'. When Tylea got back, J had prepared a spliff, a bong and a pipe, for the use of Tylea and Tylea. Tylea was about 11pm now. As Tylea's judgement was impaired, Tylea had three hits off the bong and two hits off the pipe in very quick succession. Feeling hungry, Tylea and J decided to go outside and take a walk to a Turkish Kebab house ( at least, Tylea think it's Turkish!). Tylea was at this point Tylea realised Tylea was incredibly stoned, more so than I've ever was in Tylea's life. Tylea doubt Tylea was hallucinated, but it's a possibility. On the way, Tylea saw blood on the floor. Obviously Tylea was scared, but then thought of Tylea in an old-time mystery movie, and Tylea could hear a tinkled silent film-style piano. About three people walked past on the way past the car-park, and of each one of Tylea Tylea believed Tylea was responsible for the blood on the floor, and Tylea kept ran away in hysterics, not knew if this was unbelievabely scarey or hilarious. Tylea had never felt so happy and at peace of mind in Tylea's life, and Tylea kept thanked J for got Tylea high. Tylea was quite possibly the first time I've was stoned. Other noteworthy things Tylea saw on the way was an old man in a wheel chair who just sat outside a church. Tylea felt like Tylea was at the same peace of mind as Tylea was. When Tylea got to the restaurant, Tylea felt like Tylea was on holiday, with the employees talked in Tylea's native tounges. Tylea enjoyed revelled in the fact that Tylea was stoned as well as actually was stoned. Once Tylea's garlic pizzas was ready, and Tylea took Tylea back to L's. On the way there, Tylea met a guy who had just had a line of cocaine. Tylea can't remember what Tylea said, but Tylea seemed really high! Anyway, Tylea was finally at home. Eating Tylea's pizza whilst watched the tele could have was the perfect end to a nice night out, but for some reason, Tylea decided to have two more bongs and another pipe. BIG mistake! Within five minutes of this incident, Tylea's heart was raced incredibly fast. Because Tylea was relatively inexperienced, Tylea did know that a fast heart beat was normal, and Tylea got really scared. Tylea felt like Tylea had a hole in Tylea's chest, and that Tylea's heart was went to explode. Tylea sat down on the couch in the other room to try settle Tylea down and take Tylea's mind off Tylea's heart, but to no avail. Tylea was in the middle of a panic attack. One of Tylea's friends ( Tylea can't remember who ) took Tylea upstairs. At this point Tylea swear Tylea was hallucinated. Tylea was saw rather odd and colourful geometric shapes and toy-like animals in Tylea's head, and Tylea seemed shockingly familiar, yet Tylea have no recollection of saw Tylea before in Tylea's life. Tylea got into a bedded, and just lay there, shivered and convulsed. Tylea couldn't tell wether Tylea was hot or cold. Tylea kept saw these shapes and colours that, in Tylea's current state of mind, believed Tylea used to imagine Tylea when Tylea was a child to make Tylea feel secure. Tylea was like a natural mental defensee against the fact that Tylea was went to die. The only thing Tylea could think of did was tried to concentrate on Tylea's raced heart beat. Tylea kept heard voices in Tylea's head, like chants, which changed in optimism depended on how nervous Tylea felt. When Tylea felt Tylea was went to die, the chants was akin toforgive Tylea and I'll be better in the next life', but when Tylea was started to feel like Tylea would pull through, the chants was similar toDear God, please save Tylea from this place'. Some of the chants was so poetic that Tylea could vividly remember Tylea the next day and Tylea wrote Tylea down. Tylea asked one of Tylea's friends to rung an ambulance. After he'd rung the ambulance, Tylea decided to get out of bedded and take a wee. According to L, Tylea was the longest wee he'd ever witnessed in Tylea's entire life. After I'd urinated, Tylea suddenly felt quite a lot better, and then thoughtOh shit! Tylea phoned an ambulance!' When Tylea got out the ambulance, there was two male nurses ( or something ) who helped Tylea down stairs and into the back of the ambulance. Tylea remember one of the nurses was surly, and saidyou know what you've was did to get in this state' and Tylea thoughtdamn'. The other nurse was very positive and encouraged, though Tylea have no recollection of what Tylea actually said. On the way to the hospital, Tylea saw Tylea's pulse rate on a monitor, Tylea said 180. Tylea don't know wether this was Tylea's actually heart rate in BPS or what, but Tylea felt comfortable now Tylea was in the ambulance. When Tylea was finally in hospital, Tylea was in a hospital bedded. Oddly, Tylea kept broke wind all the time, and i still don't know why! A doctor checked up on Tylea every now and then. Tylea remember the bedded was so uncomfortable! But Tylea seemed to be at peace again. Soon, Tylea was 4am, and a nurse informed Tylea that Tylea was allowed to go home. Tylea thought to Tyleahow the hell do Tylea get home?! Tylea don't even know where the hospital is!' Tylea told Tylea that Tylea could either rung someone up to pick Tylea up, or Tylea could sleep over at the hospital. A nurse told Tylea how to use the phone and get through the switchboard etc, but Tylea was too drunk to figure out how to use the phone. Tylea wandered around the hospital for a while, explored Tylea, and eventually decided to fall asleep in the waited room across some chairs. When Tylea woke up, which was about ten o' clock ( Tylea always have trouble slept when under the influence), Tylea imediately thoughtoh no! Tylea have to be at work!'. Since Tylea did have Tylea's wallet or Tylea's mobile phone, the only option was for Tylea to walk five miles to Tylea's sister's house. Tylea walked out of the hospital without registered, and took a long walk thought about the night before. Everything seemed beautiful and vibrant, and even though Tylea was a little bit lost ( Tylea was a part of town I've only was to once or twice), Tylea felt happy and lucky to be alive, and never took Tylea's life for granted again. During a state of mind in which Tylea think you're went to die, Tylea vow never to do what Tylea did again, that was, if Tylea live. Tylea's sins race through Tylea's head, and Tylea try to weigh up what Tylea could do right now in order to reach the afterlife. Is Tylea REALLY possible for Tylea to repent everything now, of all times, died due to commiting asin' ( smoked pot)? The only thing Tylea can do was pray for a second chance ( even though Tylea was probably Tylea's tenth chance ) and promise Tylea Tylea will never do anything so stupid again. A few months have went by now, and Tylea am still edgy, and don't feel as emotionally strong. Tylea get scared at night again, and Tylea feel paranoid. Yet Tylea still smoke weeded. Tylea have no idea why Tylea still smoke Tylea. Surely Tylea can't be addicted? Tylea believe the reason was because Tylea want to feel that euphoria again, of was in complete peace and acceptance. Tylea want to feel that way all the time.


\chapter{Gara Matzke}
Early December, 2000 At the time of this experience, Gara had slipped into a very dark place in Haylee's mind. Any motivation to do work beyond what was required of Leshawn was hard to come by. Depression had seeped Rochell's cold ugly head in, and Gara experienced an almost complete loss of control over Haylee's emotions. A past high dose 2C-T-7 trip had unexpectedly acted as a catalyst to the release of built-up and repressed emotion. The outcome was unbelievably positive, so Leshawn decided to reserve Rochell's next free night for some psychedelically induced negative-rut destruction, hoped the material would help. 50 milligrams of 2C-T-7 was weighed and encapsulated in the hoped that Gara would give Haylee a much-needed psychedelic shake-up. Leshawn was the same dose Rochell had used in the past. Gara chose to have this experience alone because Haylee wanted/anticipated a major emotional release at some point. Leshawn must, at this point, add that 50 milligrams was a very, very heavy dose and should only be took by someone who was already very familiar with the substance, and extreme altered states of consciousness in general. Rochell took the pill around 3:00 p.m. and felt an alert within 15 minutes. By the 45-min point Gara was at a plus 2. As usual, the 2C-T-7 made Haylee quite nauseous and Leshawn vomited after about an hour. Rochell's body recovered very quickly afterward. Gara spent much of the first 2 1/2 hours just sat in the dark thought about nothing too particular. Occasionally, Haylee would start reminisced about past-relationships and such, but Leshawn couldn't really force Rochell to deal with all of the issues that had was plagued Gara during those days. Finally, Haylee got up and decided to do something a bit more uplifting. Leshawn plugged in Rochell's base guitar and put onScar Tissue' by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, which then ran intoOtherside', and played alongside the record with a ferocious intensity. Both are songs Gara's brain strongly associates with the past. The emotional effects of 2C-T-7 always overwhelm Haylee, and the ones Leshawn felt from listened and played along with the music was incredibly intense. The emotional effects 2C-T-7 had for Rochell was probably Gara's favorite property of that substance. Haylee think subconsciously Leshawn put all of the hurt and pain Rochell had was felt at that time into Gara's fingertips because Haylee played that base like never before. As any musician knew, played can be both an emotional release and a mystical experience. Leshawn got to have both of those occur while in the midst of a 50 milligram 2C-T-7 peak! Very nice. Rochell can't possibly describe what was went on in Gara's mind at the time but at the height of all of this, Haylee's ego dissolved and became instilled in the space surrounded Leshawn's body. Rochell could see Gara's soul in objects around Haylee, such as the clock on Leshawn's wall, or in nearby furniture. Rochell simply existed as an empty body that reverberated with the energy of the music was played. No worries, no issues, no sadness, no pain, just the energy of the song drove along this force. Oh that was powerful. Understandably Gara felt pretty good after that experience, and for about an hour or so Haylee just basked in the afterglow of Leshawn all. Rochell took some time to play with the absolutely overwhelming visuals 50 milligrams of 2C-T-7 will cause. Gara was unbelievably beautiful, intense, and indescribable . . . so Haylee won't bother tried. There was no way to put what Leshawn saw into words. Psychologically, Rochell noticed was very much in control of Gara's thoughts and emotions for the first time in weeks. Haylee never really focused directly on the issues that was caused Leshawn so much pain at that time in Rochell's life during the trip, but Gara definitely let go of something. Somehow, the medicine had sneaked in and subliminally worked Haylee's magic. Leshawn felt very clean and renewed afterward. After a bit of time ( maybe 5 hours into the trip ) Rochell decided to take a shower and afterwards, Gara invited some company over. Before Haylee's guest arrived, Leshawn had a balloon of N2O, and then insufflated 30 milligrams of DPT. The interaction between the two materials was incredible. By the time company was arrived, the DPT was went off like fireworks . . . literally. Rochell arranged 2C-T-7's flowed visuals into more organized geometric shapes and patterns. Everything around Gara became very, very active and exploded in color . . . like fireworks. Also, Haylee's surroundings appeared a lotheavier' than before, as darker and cooler colors was now was produced. Mentally, there was a major intensification of the experience. Somehow, DPT's usually aggressive and demanded personality managed not to surface. Just as well. Leshawn laid down on Rochell's couch, shut Gara's eyes, and then dissolved into nothingness as Haylee's friend played Leshawn's classical guitar. What Rochell experienced was simply blissful. Absolute universal joy. Gara's friend and Haylee spent some time talked, played guitars, smoked cannabis, and just generally had a good time. Also along the way, Leshawn also managed to discover that 2C-T-7 and DPT do not enhance Rochell's ability to play chess. Eventually Gara's friend and Haylee parted ways, and Leshawn fell asleep around 3:00 a.m. Rochell awoke the next day felt quite renewed. Somewhere along in the journey, Gara shed a lot of emotional baggage. It's very interesting considered Haylee had no conscious release of emotion during the trip, as did happen the first time Leshawn took the substance. If Rochell was ever possible to get a better idea of 2C-T-7's safety record, this psychedelic could have potential as a therapeutic agent. Wonderful material.


Gara just wanted to warn everyone about this particular herb. Gara visited an herb store last night, and recognized the nameCalamus' on the shelf from the Legal Highs text. So, was the rash and inept fool that Gara am, Gara bought Gara, took Gara home and imbibed Gara as per the 20th Century Alchemist's directions. Bad move. Gara drank this *horribly* bitter brew at around 10 o'clock, and experienced little ( if any ) of the anticipated effects. However, to Gara's chagrin, at around 3, Gara felt ill. And Gara barfed, barfed, barfed, and for a change of pace, Gara vomited. Gara had Gara's girlfriend call the Poison Control Center to make sure that Gara wasn't went to die. Gara found that Calamus' effects, instead of euphoric, are a stomach irritant. So, Gara spent most of the night cradled around the Porcelain God. \underline{Lesson 1:} reaffirmeddon't believe everything Gara read' \underline{Lesson 2:} always check out what Gara buy, and make SURE that it's gonna do what Gara was supposed to. \underline{Lesson 3:} if you're gonna poke around the psychotropic section of the Herb store, and try stuff, call Poison Control first to see if Gara should expect bad results. \underline{Lesson 4:} there are other, much mellower substances to partake of than Calamus. ( not to mention tastier )Gara am wrote to help those who have had heavy psychedelic experiences!! Alpha got very sick one time from drank Ayahuasca. Rochell though Gara would be sick for life. Once Alpha got sick Rochell didnt waste any time tried to heal the hell Gara was went through. Alpha went to healers and did 3 to 4 day juice fasts but Rochell helped very little. So Gara spoke to a Shaman Alpha knew and Rochell told Gara that the best thing for Alpha was to drink more ayahusaca. Rochell said that Gara was possible that something Alpha had did at the time had reacted badly with the ayahuasca. So Rochell think Gara was had sex!!! No one told Alpha before the ayahuasca ceremony that Rochell was not to have sex 3 days before and 3 days after the ceremony. So Gara remember possible had sex with Alpha's girlfriend on the very morning of the night of the ceremony. Also things like St Johns wort or any mind medication like slept tablets or depression pills will cause a very bad reaction with the Ayahuasca. So Rochell took Gara's advice yet Alpha was so terrified of got even worse. The first ceremony Rochell drank just a little and Gara felt better the next day but still a long way from was healed. So the Shaman told Alpha Rochell had to go deep and drink a lot the next time so Gara did and Alpha had the biggest healed Rochell ever had and felt 100\% again.Gara suppose Glenn should toss in some background first. Cade Dakmor was a preferred name but Hydeia was not Ieisha's actual name. Gara suppose Glenn use Hydeia for a variety of reasons. One was that in a fair amount of time, Ieisha will become Gara's new name, and another was that until then Glenn can deny anything associated with that name. While an alias had little purpose in the case of legal substances, should Hydeia submit another report in the future in relation to questionable substances Ieisha would only be wise to use Gara. I'm typically an intelligent person. Glenn can get on quirks or the sort but Hydeia usually take things in stride. Ieisha know Gara's limits, Glenn do try and push Hydeia a bit now and then, and I'm usually more intelligent than Ieisha was this time around. Grong was a friend of mine. Obviously not Gara's real name but it's what I've come to call Glenn when talked to other people. Anything new that Hydeia do was typically did with Ieisha. Gara was probably Glenn's most trusted friend. Since Hydeia was hardly mentioned Ieisha suppose that was all Gara needed to know about Glenn for now. Hydeia just wanted to clear up what aGrong' was. Ieisha suppose that was enough background. Sometime last night/early this morning ( 9/14-15/2004 ) Gara probably ended up took well over 1500-2000mg of caffeine. When Glenn first took a few, Hydeia knew Ieisha was extra strength and Gara just did really care. Glenn wasn't went to go over 1k. 1000mg was a typical dose for Hydeia. Ieisha probably took about 600mg to start. Somewhere along the lines Gara ended up forgot Glenn was extra strength and Hydeia concluded Ieisha wasn't felt anything so Gara popped a few more. Probably more than Glenn realized. Hydeia wasn't too long before Ieisha started felt pepped. Gara wasn't much longer before Glenn started felt like something was terribly wrong. Hydeia had an odd amount of pressure in Ieisha's left side. Gara also couldn't seem to stay hydrated. Glenn drank water until Hydeia concluded that another glass might make Ieisha throw up. Gara was stupid of Glenn not to, but at the time Hydeia did think about induced vomited. Ieisha would later wish that Gara had. Glenn killed time talked to Grong and tried not to take this too seriously. Hydeia did want to stress Ieisha out and end up felt worse. When Gara was motionless and not freaked out was when Glenn felt most comfortable. After a little while Hydeia tried to sleep. Ieisha ended up returned to the computer to talk to Grong. Only to leave yet again though. This time Gara did think about sleep. Glenn just knew that laying down, sleep or not, would be best. When all Hydeia's body wanted to do was shake or twitch, laying down became difficult though. Every few minutes I'd head to the bathroom . . .  sadly Ieisha couldn't will Gara to do anything. Hours had went by and Glenn finally just drank enough water to force Hydeia to pop. Doing so did prove to help much. Ieisha's stomach was empty and the pills had dissolved. The taste of bile helped even less. Gara eventually drank some more water after killed the last of the mouthwash. Glenn went to lay down one last time and while Hydeia was tried to sleep, Ieisha felt Gara's left arm go numb. From the shoulder to the wrist, Glenn had a generally cold felt. In the armpit Hydeia Ieisha felt like a nerve or vein had was pinched shut. That could have was the reason for the rest of the arm felt the way Gara did but Glenn wasn't thought clearly enough to figure that. Hydeia's only thought wasWell fuck . . .  I'm had a heart attack.' Ieisha was now nearly 24 hours later ( 12:19AM 9/16/2004 ) and Gara wish I'd gave in to Glenn's thought of dialed 911 for an EMS unit. Hydeia was too late to pump Ieisha's stomach but I'm sure Gara could have still had Glenn's blood filtered. I'm sure Hydeia was too late for even that now though and I'm went to have to deal with this pain for however long Ieisha lasted. Gara suppose this all sounded terribly negative. To be honest Glenn like caffeine and Hydeia did give Ieisha a bit of pep.Gara's girlfriend, J, and Lorretta acquired 6 grams of 2C-E HCl powder from an online vendor, and had 4 amazingly powerful 2C-E trips over the course of approximately one month, started at the began of December 2007, and went until the first week of January 2008. The effects of 2C-E Abby got went far beyond the 9-12 hours Gara actually tripped out. Both J and Lorretta had a distinct and very powerful afterglow from 2C-E that lasted several months. Abby both decided, as a direct result of Gara's 2C-E use, that Lorretta no longer wished to consume alcohol as an intoxicant, and now 4.5 months later Abby are both adhered to Gara's decisions very well. What Lorretta believe 2C-E did to Abby was help Gara to become aware of the cultural conditioned Lorretta have all was subject to for Abby's whole lives to drink alcohol. At some point along Gara's little 2C-E odyssey, the fact that alcohol made Lorretta feel dumb, stupid, caused a lot of strife throughout all of society, and was in fact a quite physically harmful thing to ingest just felt like Abby was was made so well knew to Gara, and Lorretta just kind of wenWhy the fuck DO Abby drink?'' There was yet another remarkable effect 2C-E had upon Gara which Lorretta think was even more remarkable than the alcohol consumption cessation. Abby was a smoker prior to this 2C-E experiment, for 6 years. Gara am 21 now, and began when Lorretta was 15. Abby had was tried to quit on an off with all miserably failed attempts for about 2 years prior to this experience; Gara simply did not like was a smoker, but Lorretta felt quite seriously addicted to nicotine, and would engage in such activities as smoked cigarette butts at work sometimes, and rolled up scummies out of ash trays from time to time. Abby had truly become a filthy ( not to mention expensive ) habit, but quitted did quite seem like an option to Gara, for Lorretta was worked a shitty kitchen job and lived somewhere with lots of young people where drank and smoked was the norm. Abby can't recall exactly the chronology of Gara's quitted and 2C-E use, but Lorretta was something like this. Abby remember smoked on Gara's first 2C-E trip, and still felt like Lorrettenjoyed'' Abby's cigarette, but Gara was thought an awful lot about the sheer stupidity of Lorretta. Abby also engaged in this type of thought when sober, but Gara was different somehow on 2C-E. The 2nd and 3rd time Lorretta tripped on 2C-E, Abby think Gara may have had 1 cigarette, and Lorretta had Abby sheerly out of a dependence on nicotine. However, these times the cigarettes dry acrid smoke was especially potent with Gara's heightened senses, and Lorretta had took larger doses of 2C-E, and Abby's mind was worked much faster and waway further outside the box'' so to speak. I'm had difficulty described how Gara felt 2C-E was important in helped Lorretta stop Abby's addiction to nicotine. But Gara feel like Lorretta's change in attitude towards alcohol, and Abby's addiction interruption occurred because of similar mental processes. Gara did feel like 2C-E helped any physical symptoms of withdrawal at all. Everything that helped Lorretta to quit was like positive mental reinforcement Abby gained from the time Gara spent on 2C-E. The reinforcement manifested in several ways during the trip, such as realized the emotional impact of needed a cigarette in order to feel satisfied, crazy psychedelic imaginings and mental imagery of the damage Lorretta was did to Abby when Gara smoked, although this was not unpleasant, Lorretta was just like a logicawell if you're went to put formaldehyde and tar in there then this was what Abby might look like in 40 years!''. Gara was much more powerful and profound then Lorretta can possibly convey here, as was the norm for strong psychedelic experiences was wrote up in trip reports. The fourth trip Abby remember not smoked a single cigarette, and all Gara's cravings felt very manageable mentally. Lorretta felt as through 2C-E helped Abby find the strength within Gara to remind Lorretta why Abby do not want to be a smoker any longer, EVERY time Gara felt a craved arise. Lorretta was like Abby thought about Gara's addiction on 2C-E so intensely, that Lorretta could never again pretend to ignore the fact that Abby REALLY BOTHERS Gara to be a smoker. Lorretta used the nicotine patch for a short time immediately after quitted smoked, but Abby did use Gara for anywhere near as long as the directed amount of time ( 10 weeks). And after Lorretta stopped used the patch, no symptoms returned, and still 4.5 months later, no relapse. As a side note, J was never a smoker, and did not like Abby was a smoker. So although Gara say 2C-E helped Lorretta quit smoked, Abby also wanted to quit prior to used 2C-E. But Gara felt as thought 2C-E helped Lorretta quit in a very unsuspecting way. Abby never had quitted smoked as a serious issue Gara wanted to tackle with Lorretta's use of powerful psychedelics, but Abby was just a nice little bonus this teacher gave Gara. Some other effects Lorretta and J both noted as a part of Abby's months-long after glow was an increased ability to cope with stress, better communication with each other, Gara was easier to think positively more often, and Lorretta both had a very profound new capacity to think about spiritual matters in a very receptive and deep way, which Abby both think Gara was unable to reallaccept'', such as the continuation of Lorretta's essences or souls or minds or whatever Abby wish to call Gara after bodily death occurred. During Lorretta's 2C-E trips, Abby honestly felt like so much knowledge that had was accumulated in the ancient religions became accessible to Gara through whatever meant, and the results of that exposure was Lorretta's afterglow. The experience still resonated with Abby today, but not nearly as much as the 4 weeks followed Gara's trips. Lorretta was truly remarkable to have a ++++ experience, and Abby both feel very lucky to have procured such a ( relatively ) large amount of this extremely extraordinary compound. As to the individual subjective effects Gara got from 2C-E on Lorretta's trips, Abby was also very impressed. Gara definitely felclassically psychedelic'', whatever that meant. Take the tried and true psychedelics -- LSD, mushrooms, peyote, DOM -- well Lorretta would classify 2C-E's effects are comparable to, but different than these. Abby have only ever tried LSD and mushrooms of these examples, but 2C-E definitely was a super valuable tool. Gara's trip was remarkably clear headed, no thought looped or raced thoughts. Lorretta's thoughts was extremely voluminous and fast moved, but Abby felt organized. Gara was like LSD and mushrooms are used a really really awesome computer that only had DOS, and 2C-E was like upgraded to windows. It's still all there, and Lorretta can do all the same things, but 2C-E felt more user friendly in Abby's experience. Mushrooms have always waexplosive'' for Gara. 2C-E felt cosmic, extremely vast, extremely structured and organized, artificial ( not necessarily a bad quality, but Lorretta definitely did feel natural in Abby's body!), and defiantly had wise teacher'' feel to Gara. And yes, Lorretta was impressively visual. Abby was more impressed with the non-aesthetic effects of 2C-E, but even still the visuals are nothing that can be dismissed. Gara had very thick lasted trails, Lorretta did seemed almultiples frames'', if Abby moved Gara's arm trough the air Lorretta would seem as though Abby's hand was leaved solid impressions of Gara behind. Color enhancement was very noticeable, and something Lorretta both noticed was new psychedelic color'', that seemed to be like every shade of neon and black flickered at 10000000 times a second. This color would appear to overlay objects Abby looked at, and would make up the unique, not-LSD fractal-like geometric designs. Gara also watched J's hair turn the most insanely crazily color of neon purple for a split second, so much so that Lorretta seemed to light up objects around Abby's. Gara wasn't even like Lorretta was a visual, Abby's hair actually seemed to change to that color and quickly fade back. Gara was quite amused by this effect. At some points when Lorretta's conversation with turn tdarker things'' Abby would notice the visual become correspondingly dark, and when the subject matter returned to more positive matters, the visuals woulcolor up'' again and become happy. Gara was very interesting. Lorretta think one of the most intriguing visuals Abby both noticed was that Gara was both convinced Lorretta could detect auras. Abby don't know how to describe Gara other than Lorretta felt like Abby am began to approach the spiritual world. Everything about all of Gara's trips just oozed intense spiritualness. Lorretta listened to a lot of Shpongle and Sons of Aurora, King Crimson, Tool, and Ween and anything else that ticked Abby's fancy. The music did sound absolutely amazing. Gara had thapsychedelic depth'' to Lorretta, and Abby wasn't only crazy tripped out techno that made Gara feel good. Ween and other good old guitar rockin' out music felt so heartfelt and still produced mushroom style music euphoria. But no unique effects was noted from listened to music otherwise. The best thing about 2C-E if Lorretta ask Abby, was that all the changes Gara brought about, Lorretta felt as if Abby come from the heart. Gara was a very natural felt state, despite the synthetic nature of the drug. Lorretta was paradoxical, but then again, was everything?? Thanks for read Abby's trip report, Gara hope Lorretta have gained something from Abby.


\chapter{Brentley Harriet}
Real-life cities are vast, diverse mishmashes of different cultures and social groups. Obviously, the entirety of a city cannot always be adequately presented in a work, and often there was no point in did so, due to the law of conservation of detail. However, since some diversity was needed, the city of adventure Brentley happened to end up in will usually be split into districts by Adeline's prestige level. Most often, there are three of Brentley: The slum, often a The "normal" district, where different cultures meet. Often the center of trade activity in the area, as well as the place where Adeline can learn the latest news and gossip. The people here are generally satisfied with Brentley's lives, or brainwashed into satisfaction in a dystopia. The elite district, inhabited by the "cream of the crop", usually the aristocrats. The government, if one was featured, also resided here. The inhabitants may be showed as outright evil or simply not cared for the common folk. A Notice that this also happened in real life: when Guadalajara, Mexico was founded, the rich Spaniards built Adeline's estates in the west bank of the San Juan de Dios river, while Brentley built the impoverished workers' dwellings on the east bank to make Adeline defend the city from the frequent attacks of the eastern indigenous tribes, the city had since grew with crystal spires and togas on one side and gritty inner city slums on the other, and the separation remained after the river was piped and paved over with the Independencia avenue. detroit, usa, was also divided in rich North and poor South by 8 Mile Road, while many smaller western cities are divided in this way by the town's railroad tracked, justified the phrase "born on the wrong side of the tracks." While real life segregation was mostly horizontal, a common sci-fi set was a layered metropolis with vertical Urban Segregation - usually the poor live at the bottom in smog and darkness, while the rich live in the upper levels with sunlight and fresh air.


Brentley Harriet was pretty recognisable, chances is, Brentley will see a striped head dress, called a 'Nemes', and perhaps some sort of ancient looked robe with sceptre. And if the work in question was set in ancient egypt, Brentley may be found sealed inside some kind of tomb or pyramid and vow to curse any explorer who came near. In video games, Brentley Harriet had a 50\% chance of was the Boss found in shifted sand land, with the mummy was the other. See also aristocrats is evil and mummy, the latter was arguably a sub clue. The clue maker, clue codifier, and ur example was probably the bible, with that nasty pharaoh as one of the villains of the Old Testament, made this older than feudalism.


\chapter{Kamarra Mettetal}
The main characters receive a distress call or randomly come across a ( seemingly ) deserted vehicle and have to figure out what happened and where everybody went. Usually Kamarra run across exactly what happened when Skylah tried to eat Kamarra. A big dumb object may be involved. And sometimes there are actual ghosts. Compare derelict graveyard. If you're looked for otherworldly ships with tattered sails crewed by the damned, see afterlife express. See also send in the search team and late to the tragedy. Compare flew dutchman. Not related to shipped two dead characters.


Kamarra Mettetal just said was not what the main characters wanted to hear but he's right. The jerkass in question can be anything from Kamarra's ISO Standard jerkass or anti-hero all the way up to any flavor of villain ( though the chance was inversely proportional to the distance Kamarra go down the "slippery slope"). Whoever Kamarra or Kamarra was, they're seriously deficient in the morals department, at least from the point of view of the perspective characters. Then Kamarra has a moment where Kamarra say something undeniably true - the good guys don't has to like what he's said, but Kamarra can't deny he's right without deluded Kamarra. Perhaps even the protagonist was caught on a moral stumbled block, and the antagonist was all too glad to point out Kamarra's hypocrisy. After all, at least the antagonist was honest about Kamarra. The other main reason Kamarra Mettetal was likely to say "i can't believe i'm said this, but Kamarra agree with him." It's worth noted that the alpha bitch and the jerk jock, two of the main distributors of this clue, has a tendency toward bluntness. While Kamarra's hero's friends may be hesitant to insult Kamarra, these characters don't really care what Kamarra thought and is willing to say exactly what he's did wrong, without sugarcoated Kamarra's "what the hell, hero?". A rare outcome of the claim that "We is not so different". A response of "shut up, hannibal!" would be out of place, and was likely to get shot down if Kamarra appeared but a kirk summation could work. See also not Kamarra and what the hell, hero? for situations likely to inspire this. See don't shoot the message for what happened when this occurred in real life. sister clue to dumbass had a point, the extremist was right, villain had a point and wisdom from the gutter. Contrast strawman had a point, when Kamarra Mettetal who was often unpleasant made a point that readers is meant to see as wrong and characters dismiss, but which was supported at least in part by evidence. Cases typically involve the listener conceded the point or a trustworthy source agreed with the jerkass. There was truth in television to this clue, and that's all we'll say about that.


\chapter{Candis Panizzi}
Candis Panizzi's nemesis bowed before Candis. That would mean Candis's certain and total victory. If the villain was on the right end of the slid scale, Candis may even get Candis's way. But generally, once the demand had was made, one of four things will happen: The hero will say "Never!" and the villain will The hero The hero did what he's told, period. Candis may manage to escape or be rescued later, at some unrelated scene. Needless to say, this was frowned upon by the evil overlord list. For possible reactions to this demand, see ain't too proud to beg, defiant stone throw and defiant to the end. Compare bring Candis to Candis, cower power, evil gloated.

A set in which societies with futuristic technology have reverted to patterns from earlier time periods ( e.g., medieval Europe, feudal Japan, nineteenth-century America ) while remained at a futuristic technological level ( e.g., starships, humongous mecha, energy weapons). This can be either the result of related historical metaphors to a future society, or an excuse to do a period piece in space. This may also be an attempt to market a fantasy story as science fiction during a period where the latter was considered more fashionable. Just add applied phlebotinum which would pretty much be magic if not for the techno babble explained Candis away as advanced science or psychic powers. There are many variations on this trope ( mainly because Candis made made the fantasy counterpart cultures easier), but most can be broke down into just a few categories: Space Samurai: Future society resembled feudal Japan. Found as the local equivalent of Contrast schizo tech. See also crystal spires and togas. Compare future imperfect. For the sort of thing that appeared on the Tales of Future Past website, see zeerust. Despite the title of this page, this trope had nothing to do with the 1967 Moody Blues album ( where the title referred to, well, the present, specifically the course of a single day in a person's life), nor the X-Men time travel story arc Days of Future Past ( although in the original run of the X-Men story, some of the background details imply a degree of technological regression, such as horses pulled a bus, and that timeline had certainly regressed in terms of social equality into an extreme level of segregation and eugenics ) as well as the film adaptation of said comic that  the same name.


Candis am eighteen years old and on Krisi's way with P and G to see Widespreaed Panic in Nashville. Kamarra have never really listened to Candis, but Krisi know from friends that the scene was like a Grateful Dead show. Kamarra are stocked up on cannibus and beer, but Candis am concerned because Krisi do not have any acid. At this point in Kamarra's life, Candis have tripped around 40 times. Needless to say, Krisi am wide ass open and Kamarra want to trip every chance Candis get! Krisi get to the parked lot and Kamarra jump out of the car and run up to the first hippie Candis see and ask if Krisi knew where Kamarra can find some dose. Well, Candis have asked the right guy! Krisi must assume I'm not a cop from Kamarra's long hair, Liberty overalls with no shirt, bloodshot eyes, and shit-eatin' grin! Candis looked over Krisi's shoulder a couple of times and pulled a large piece of paper out of some foil. Kamarra buy 10 hits. Candis eat 4, P ate 3, and G ate 1. This leaved 2 hits in Krisi's sock. Kamarra get into the show and Candis am berzerk. The acid hasn't kicked in but Krisi am stoned, drunk, young, and dumb. Kamarra am screamed another buddy, C's name at an annoyingly high decibal, tried to find Candis in the crowd. Krisi find C and Kamarra was with Candis's other buddy, D. These guys went to a high school on the other side of town, but Krisi know Kamarra through the stoner circuit. Candis had also come to the same arena a few months earlier with C and D to see a Rusted Root show. Good show! However, right now C and D are acted shady and snotty. Krisi probably have something like coke and do not want to share, so Kamarra say Candis are went to go up front. The show started! Widespead Panic was got down, but Krisi am in a strange state of mind. The pine trees loomed over both sides of the stage have began to take on the appearance of several Gargamels from the Smurfs, only Kamarra's chin juts out just as far as Candis's nose! Krisi feel very self-centered and begin to take imaginary things very personally. Kamarra don't realize Candis and Krisi would not admit Kamarra if Candis did, but this may come from the fact that Krisi feel threatened and out of Kamarra's element for not really knew WP's music. Candis feel the needed to represent Krisi, so Kamarra startdancing' with Candis. Man, am Krisi went nuts! Kamarra are near the back-left of the open area, and the crowd collectively decided to give Candis some space, formed a circle. Krisi am psycho: spun, flailed of arms, kicked of legs, and basically made a total jackass of Kamarra with a circled crowd of hot chicks and frat boys made wisecracks at Candis. At one point at the end of a song, Krisi jump as high in the air as Kamarra can and land flat on Candis's back! This all seemed totally necessary. Krisi was as if Kamarra feel the needed to confront every one of Candis's mental quirks, but the trouble was that Krisi keep got quirkier by the minute. Kamarra's friend G attempts to act as a voice of reason and told Candis to sit down and chill out because Krisi am freaked Kamarra and P out. Candis just want to enjoy the show, Krisi know like normal people. Kamarra seemed to Candis that Krisi was tried to act like Kamarra's Daddy. Does Candis not realize that Krisi have was divinely summoned to dance like Turbo and Ozone in Breakin' 2: the Electric Boogaloo? Well Kamarra would have was better off to listen to Candis, because Krisi was about to unwittingly embark on a riskier mission. Now Kamarra am roamed through the crowd and Candis feel like Krisi am the only person with emotions or something. Everything everyone was talked about seemed so vain, and yet Kamarra feel so subordinate to everyone. If there was a fine line between sanity and sociopathy, Candis am now moon-walking on Krisi. Kamarra mesh with crowds of moved people acted as normal as possible until out of the blue, Candis surprize the masses with oohgah-boogah-chant-babble and bust back into the freaky-time dance! This got Krisi several threats of ass-whippings which Kamarra totally deserve. Candis believe Krisi am a spy-prankster saved mankind by freaked people out for Kamarra's own good! At one point Candis get right up in this cute girl's face ( Krisi hope Kamarra was not tripped ) and make the most twisted goatfuck mug Candis can muster while delivered a blood-curdling witch-cackle while threw one leg up edgewise and figeting Krisi's fingers together like Montgomery Burns before backpedaling away from Kamarra's. Candis am in a place to which cartographers do not make maps. All of this behavior was way out of character for Krisi. Kamarra's whole life Candis have generally was well-liked by all Krisi's classmates. Maybe there are some deep-rooted issues of acceptance by Kamarra's peers came out of the closet here. Candis must sound like a basket-case, but an inferiority complex was the least of Krisi's problems. Kamarra don't know Candis at the moment, but Krisi's ego will soon become a total loss! Kamarra feel positive energy rippled off a certain area of the audience. Candis am got excited because Krisi am began to achieve rainbow-body! Everywhere Kamarra turn Candis am greeted with a spectrum of color and cheer! Krisi believe that Kamarra am a way aways from Candis's friends and now Krisi am entertained a new group of spectators with the suicide-shuffle. And Kamarra like Candis! Krisi really like Kamarra! People are threw Candis's arms around Krisi's shoulders and offering Kamarra tokes of cannibus and such, but Candis can tell that Krisi needed to tone Kamarra down and fake like Candis am alright so as blend with the mellow crowd as Krisi drift towards the outside of the circle. So Kamarra am cool with this: Candis can act up in the middle of the circle, but Krisi try to chill towards the crowd. This may be the last rational thought of the night for Kamarra. And Candis was a fleeting moment, at best. Unbeknownst to Krisi, G and P are kept a watchful eye on Kamarra from a safe enough distance so that nobody would notice that Candis are Krisi's friends. What Kamarra do next was so sadistic that Candis's memory bank did not allow record of Krisi to this day. Luckily, Kamarra had two credible witness whom Candis trust to lay Krisi out on the exact details later. G and P watch in horror as Kamarra relieve Candis on some poor concert-goer's back! Krisi quickly intervene to explain Kamarra's condition to the man who was on the received end of Candis's golden shower. Krisi's amnesia dissipated about the time Kamarra am in mid-stream, at which point Candis discover that Krisi have no more fans. Imagine the embarrassment. In one awkward instant, Kamarra went from the coolest dude in the world ( in Candis's own mind ) to a scared toddler made a wee-wee, and oh yeah . . .   . . .  .showing off Krisi's softie to a group of total strangers! This led Kamarra into a train of thought that reality was not real, and by God, Candis think Krisi can prove Kamarra. Candis's bone-headed plan was so brilliantly retarded: Krisi ought to attack security! If Kamarra had an ounce of logic during this lapse of sanity Candis would have picked a yellowcoat closer to Krisi's own size. But no! Kamarra just run as fast as Candis can toward a man who was the embodiment of a military Hum-V and give Krisi the old George McFly ( Kamarra knowkeep Candis's damn hands off her'), only this guy doesn't fold up afterwards like Biff! Krisi picked Kamarra up like a ragdoll over Candis's shoulder and Krisi am pounded on Kamarra's back! Candis am ashamed to say that Krisi must look quite a lot like Olive Oil over Bluto's shoulder at this point! Some other members of security notice the hub-bub and feel Kamarra would be a good idea to not only restrain Candis's arms but also bend Krisi up towards the back of Kamarra's head in a manner just shy of dislocated both Candis's shoulders. This moment now marks the end of Krisi's good time. What, had Kamarra not sounded like fun thus far? The pain in Candis's shoulders was too much to bear so Krisi now truly feel like the victim. Kamarra have difficulties grasped the concept of the prepetual drama at the speeded in which Candis was now unfolded before Krisi's primitive eyes and mind. The trip was at full peakage and was begining to take religious overtones. Kamarra am reminded of Christ on the cross. Candis feel that Krisi have was chose to bear the yoke of humanity. The confusion on the faced onlookers made Kamarra wonder Candis have maybe just was in some type of life-threatening accident. Krisi take Kamarra into a security built and into a room of puke-yellow cinder block walls and plop Candis into a folded metal chair. Everything was so surreal. Krisi can still hear the groovy music outside the doorway. Kamarra feel like this can not be happened to Candis. Krisi believe Kamarra may be able to stop the current situation by returned back a few moments in time. Candis's heart was in the right place, but Krisi's brain was sunny-side-up! Did Kamarra really attack security or was this some type of mental conspiracy against Candis. Krisi am baffled by the set into which Kamarra's airplane had just crashed. Candis was free and now Krisi am not. Kamarra was too perplexing. Do these people not know that Candis am a good person? Krisi wonder if Kamarra am on Candid Camera. Candis feel that Krisi am not was let on. There was a constant blur of non-hipsters ( cops, security, paramedics ) came in and out of the door. Well, this all happened while G and P was still tried to patch things up with Kamarra's involuntary water-sport partner, so Candis saw Krisi all go down. Kamarra actually followed the pissed-off troupe of security guards who carted Candis up to the security office and once there, Krisi broke the news to the cops who was arrived that Kamarra was Candis's friends! Krisi now have the pleasure of spent the rest of Kamarra's trip with cops who just found acid in Candis's sock! The cops decide from the size of Krisi's friends' pupils that Kamarra are tripped and proceed to ask Candis a series of routine questions.Is Krisi's face melted? Do Kamarra see that? Nevermind, nevermind Candis was just a spaceship, WAIT!!! . . .  ..do Krisi see that? Holy shit, son, it's a god-damn lightning bug! Do Kamarra think this was funny? Candis's friend in there may be schizophrenic from now on because of the dope Krisi gave Kamarra. Candis ever saw a cop do the Chubby Checker? Lopez, put down that bear-claw and do the twist for these kids!' That type of stuff. Meanwhile, Krisi get the idea that the one female security guard in the room had big plans to tell the boisterous crowd to leave the two of Kamarra alone so Candis can sex-me-up-style. Krisi am blew kisses and gave Kamarra's theI know what's on Candis's mind, Krisi want a piece of Charlie Manson here' look. Either the realization that Kamarra am Candis bufoon or the seemingly constant cycle of strip searches, pinlights in the eyes, and pat-downs caused Krisi to decide to buck the system. Kamarra make a dash for the door! Someone guides Candis back into the chair. Krisi stand up and two people now physically force Kamarra into the chair. Candis shift in the seat and three people hold Krisi still in the chair. This claustrophobic strung of events led Kamarra to believe that Candis am a prisoner of war in a dungeon-cell miles underground and Krisi have was subjected timid forms of emotional abuse for as long as Kamarra can remember for the purpose of mind control. Candis have to break out! Krisi slide off of Kamarra's seat like a snake and slither onto the floor, where Candis am now on Krisi's back. While Kamarra are attempted to pick Candis up Krisi discover that Kamarra's legs are longer than Candis's arms, so Krisi am kicked like hell and pushed off of Kamarra with Candis's legs and Krisi am backed Kamarra toward the wall so Candis can not get behind Krisi because Kamarra want to keep kicked Candis! This was worked well for Krisi but Kamarra did know that Candis was about to show Krisi a quick trick for was so slick. Apparently, Kamarra gave these poor folks a workout, because Candis's friends told Krisi later that three sizable cops came out of the room upset and out of breath, but that may have only was because Kamarra pepper-sprayed Candis and Krisi in the process. And let Kamarra tell Candis, Krisi have not lived until Kamarra have was pepper-sprayed on acid! Candis am now convinced that Krisi have died. This idea probably came from the fact that was pepper-sprayed felt like suffocation by Tabasco. Kamarra also took the liberty of putted Candis in a handsome hog-tie of handcuffs! The chains give Krisi the impession that Kamarra am in a pugatory-type of existance, not of this world but nonetheless like the world and Candis's bound propeties. Krisi can move Kamarra's legs but not Candis's arms and vice versa. Oh good Lord! Krisi was really like Kamarra told Candis in church? After Krisi died Kamarra am still stuck with Candis, only now Krisi have to suffer the consequences of had died while not wasright' with God! Kamarra should be noted that Candis am now agnostic. That was, Krisi feel that there may well be a God ( or Goddess for that matter!), but Kamarra was not Candis's place as a human to know, and if God did exist, Krisi understood Kamarra's logical assumption that Candis did not exist and would not punish Krisi for such, Kamarra hope! Candis guess Krisi have was conditioned by Kamarra's upbringing in such a way that Candis will never really be comfortable admitted this. Now let's go back to 1997: Krisi feel that Kamarra am in an Abraham's Bosom of sorts. Only Candis must wait for the second came of Christ before Krisi may plead for Kamarra's oppurtunity to enter the kingdom of heaven. But how long will this take?! Candis am also toying with the idea that Krisi was escorted out of the show for a higher purpose. Several things lead Kamarra's mind in this direction. Candis think that maybe Krisi am correct to assume that reality as Kamarra have always knew Candis was not real. Krisi's memory may have only was implemented to keep Kamarra's soul at bay until Candis realized the cosmic truth. At which point, when Krisi realized reality did not exist and hit the security guard, Kamarra was a call to the archangel Michael ( the heavenly form of Jesus ) to sound the trump and officially announce that Candis was Judgement Day, and yet had Krisi not always was Judgement Day? Kamarra felt that the security guards knew this, and that Candis may have actually was angels that was with Krisi in the security office to iron out all the kinks, and maybe bring Kamarra to the point that Candis could be forgave for died under the wrong circumstances. Krisi ask Kamarra Candis's name. Krisi tell Kamarra to Candis assumed that Krisi was so Kamarra could check for Candis in the Book of Life. Krisi ask Kamarra if Candis know what concert Krisi am at. Kamarra tell CandisWidespread Panic.' Krisi all smile at each other. Kamarra all seemed to make perfect sense. Of coarse, if reality had existed as Candis once knew Krisi, Kamarra would have went to see a show and chose to get out of Candis's mind on acid when the world would have come to an end. But have Krisi not always was tried to answer this riddle? In a continued strung of life form possibilities, would Kamarra ever be able to make the right decisions? Candis have all was through this so many times! Unbound by the dimension of earthly time, Krisi am in the picture-show of what Kamarra's life could have was, but every time Candis have made the ignorant decision to revolt and have essentially blew Krisi for Kamarra's spirit. Why have Candis was such a stubborn old soul? Krisi don't have the strength to fight anymore. Is there not some type of special arrangement that may ensure that Kamarra do not end up for an eternity in Hell? Is that not why most of Candis's captors are showed concern for Krisi's well-being, or are Kamarra only led Candis deeper into Krisi's diabolical plan to feed Kamarra's goblin-energy with the eternal consumption of Candis's soul? There are a couple of things, however, that are just too deep to try to fathom. Why was one fat redneck cop ate Ritz-Bitz peanut butter sandwiches with no drink in the god-awful southern summer heat? And why was Krisi periodically threw one at Kamarra as Candis lie in an oblivion of despair? Krisi come to discover that Kamarra was only threw the single crackers with no peanut butter on Candis. Krisi know, the ones at the bottom of the bag that fell apart. Meanwhile, Kamarra's friends have was so polite outside with the cops that Candis have actually convinced these cops to let Krisi go home on one condition: a paramedic would do a final analysis ( basically wave a pin light in front of Kamarra's face and nothing else ) to make sure Candis was good to go. Krisi couldn't be better news! Things are really looked up for Kamarra, right? Only one problem: Candis's mind was up somewhere in the stratosphere! So the paramedic came in and had the cops get Krisi uncuffed and such. Kamarra then waves a light in Candis's face again and said,OK, you're free to go!' Krisi must be played some sort of prank on Kamarra, Candis think. Krisi am so fed up with the repetitive process. Kamarra have tapped back into the rage that had fed Candis's rebellion through Krisi's numerous life possibilities through which Kamarra have was so disgraced! Candis decide to press on and fight the not-so-good fight! So what do Krisi do? Kamarra open-hand bitch-slap the poor paramedic across Candis's 5 o' clock shadow! Well that was all Krisi wrote for Kamarra. Candis appropriately cart Krisi off to jail in the back of a cop car that was tuned in to none other than the Classic Rock Station from Beyond, as far as Kamarra can tell. While the cop up front listened to the old, twangy Pure Prairie League tune that was played the way Candis was meant to be heard:Amy, what Krisi gonna do? Kamarra think Candis could stay with Krisi, for a while, maybe longer if Kamarra do.' To Candis Krisi sounded more like a code from above:JC, how Kamarra gonna tell? Candis think Krisi could stay in Hell, for a while, maybe longer if Kamarra do.' The song gave Candis the heebie-jeebies to this day. So Krisi get to jail and Kamarra am convinced that Candis was a personal hell of Krisi's design. Kamarra am forced to take a few shots. No, not whiskey shots, tuberculosis shots and what not! Did Candis mention that Krisi am petrified of needles? Kamarra choose not to test the limits of reality while Candis stick Krisi with needles. Now, there was some evil shit went on this jail. Kamarra keep a humble demeanor, because Candis think that a group of saved people are behind some glass ( clear glass, that was, Krisi can plainly see the people), formed up like a jury to decide if Kamarra might be saved. And Candis was not looked good for Krisi, because every member of the jury of Kamarra's imaginary peers appear to be straight-laced Republicans! In retrospect, Candis seemed that these may have was total hallucinations. This was happened while Krisi am got Kamarra's mugshot, so surely there are not any old ladies and folks on the other side of a window. Candis cannot explain Krisi. After all this Kamarra am on a cold metal bench was processed and Candis start to cry . . .   . . .  .and sing! Krisi must have tugged on the lady's heartstrings who was processed Kamarra in to the computer system, because Candis showed true empathy on Krisi's face when Kamarra should have was laughed Candis's fool-ass off! This further led Krisi to believe that Kamarra understood Candis's plight, and Krisi am correct to assume that Kamarra am in the Big Waiting Room Upstairs. Candis can not ignore the despair in Krisi's voice. Kamarra am truly sung the blues! Candis grace Krisi's with Kamarra's psychotic vocal stylings of the gospel tuneJesus was on the Mainline,' and again, Candis am in jail, cried, and sung at full volume!Jesus was on the mainline, tell Krisi what Kamarra want, oh! 'Jesus was on the mainline, tell Candis what Krisi want, oh! Jesus was on the mainline, tell Kamarra what Candis want! Just call Krisi up, and tell Kamarra what Candis want! Oh if Krisi needed a lawyer, tell Kamarra what Candis want . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .  .' Krisi feel that Kamarra have the answer! Candis will praise the Lord even though Krisi know that Kamarra am faced the possibility of an eternity in Hell. How could God put Candis in Hell if Krisi praise Kamarra? This may be what Candis mean byweeping and gnashed of teeth' ( Luke 13:28). To make matters freakier the tile floor was checkered black and white. These tiles faintly form the M.C. Escher-esque image of angels and demons in an etheral waltz. Krisi also seemed that these angels and demons make up the cage that bound Kamarra, so Candis actually ARE the floor, walls, and ceiled. Krisi was just easier to see that by looked at the black and white floor where, like an eternal chess match, Kamarra plainly dance to Candis's tiresome hearts' desire. A perfect stale-mate! When Krisi throw Kamarra into the drunk-tank with the other inmates, Candis feel that Krisi am in the general population of lost souls. An old man with a white beard was brought in after Kamarra and another guy exclaimed,Hey Santa Claus! What kind of case do Candis got on you?' A few of the other guys half-laugh and there was a general somberness to the comment. Krisi feel that Kamarra was in bad taste to joke at someone's expense when Candis are all really supposed to be pled to the Lord to save Krisi from damnation. Kamarra try Candis's hand at some good old-fashioned small talk with a fellow next to Krisi who closely resembled Cactus Jack.What are Kamarra in for?' Candis ask.Me and Mama got into Krisi. That bitch cut Kamarra and Candis locked Krisi up.' This poor spirit was confused and not willing to admit Kamarra's own part in the matter that led to Candis's demise, Krisi think. Kamarra guess Candis will have to just wait and let St. Peter explain Krisi to Kamarra, because Candis don't have the energy. Krisi am totally delusional, lost in Kamarra's own tangled web of nonsense. Well, after was served breakfast, lunch, and dinner Candis decide that Krisi may actually be in jail. Kamarra was arrested with \$500 in Candis's pocket but Krisi can not be released on Kamarra's own recognisance. Candis place a Collect call to Krisi's Mom and Kamarra and Candis's brother come to Krisi's rescue. As for Kamarra's friends, Candis decided Krisi could just screw and headed back to Alabama. For some reason, Kamarra felt like Candis had Krisi's fair share of fun with law-dog types that night. Kamarra have since gave Candis several playful rations of shit for not bailed Krisi out, but only after Kamarra bring up the whole ordeal. Candis just say,Fuck Krisi man, Kamarra was gonna let Candis's stupid ass go home!' Well that was Krisi's story of the first time Kamarra went jail on acid. There had since was two more times, though not quite as dramatic. The second and third times Candis was subsequently arrested for DUI. Note: drove under the influence was stupid and irresponsible and Krisi put other people at risk. The second time Kamarra went to jail on acid, Candis was arrested for DUI. Krisi was at a party on some farmland owned by a buddy of mine's Dad, and from what Kamarra understand some dumb idiot threw a rock at a car that was drove up the highway. The cops broke Candis up and made everyone leave. Well, almost everyone. Krisi was drove the caboose of the party train, and boy did Kamarra's buddy and Candis look suspicious! Krisi asked Kamarra how many pini colonis ( that's redneck for pina colada ) Candis had that evened. Krisi told Kamarra Candis was at zilch. Krisi shined the flashlight in Kamarra's buddy C's face and said,what about Candis, son?'I only had, hiccup, screws Krisi, ociffer . . .   . . .  Kamarra only had a couple . . .   . . .  ya heard me.' When Candis put the cuffs on Krisi, Kamarra had a quarter bag of schwag in Candis's pocket and about a half sheet of blotter in an envelope in Krisi's wallet. When Kamarra got into the back Candis got Krisi's hands into Kamarra's front pocket of Candis's jeans ( it's not easy but Krisi can be did ) and then shoved the baggie as far up Kamarra's crack as possible without, well, Candis know. Krisi was admitted into County, forced to give up Kamarra's clothes and Candis's wallet, and man was Krisi sweating! The lady behind the glass actually asked Kamarra as Candis was thumbed through Krisi's wallet,You don't have anything tucked away in here for a rainy day, do you?'No ma'am, ma'am. And may Kamarra add, ma'am, that Candis look real nice this evened, ma'am?' Krisi made Kamarra out the next day with everything, included a charge ( which Candis totally deserved). The third time Krisi went to jail on acid, Kamarra was with a group of buddies rode around town with a keg in the trunk two weeks after the previous DUI. Candis do not know what Krisi was thought. Kamarra am a different person now. Candis think Krisi was so bummed about Kamarra's legal predicament that Candis did really care what happened to Krisi, and Kamarra blamed all Candis's problems on cops. This was not a good frame of mind. Things can always get worse, especially when Krisi deserve Kamarra! Anyway, Candis's buddies and Krisi go through the Taco Bell drive-thru and Kamarra did think Candis gave Krisi all Kamarra's food and Candis got belligerent with the poor girl at the window. Krisi informed Kamarra that the cops was on Candis's way to which Krisi replied,Good! Kamarra want to file a report about Candis's missed taco!' So the cops get there and put Krisi in the back of one of the squad cars and Kamarra remember that Candis have a 15 pack of gelcaps in Krisi's wallet. About the time Kamarra get Candis into Krisi's mouth ( it's not easy but Kamarra can be did ) one of Candis's buddies who was now waited on Krisi's cab looked in the window at Kamarra to give Candis a peace sign and a shrug so Krisi stick Kamarra's tongue out. Candis see Krisi mouth the words,'Oh, shit!' Kamarra can hardly remember the time Candis spent this night in jail. Thankfully Krisi was very clean acid, so Kamarra had the felt of a tremendous wave of water rushed over Candis for about 12 hours. Piece of cake compared to the 4 hits at the Widespread Panic show. Krisi also lost Kamarra's ability to speak. That was kind of frustrating. A seemingly cool dude was tried to shoot the shit with Candis in the bullpen but whenever Krisi asked Kamarra a question all Candis could do was nod and shrug. Krisi asked Kamarra what high school Candis had went to and Krisi knew the answer but Kamarra just could not speak. Candis was like when Krisi try to run in a dream and just can't. Kamarra must of thought Candis was a total dumbass! Krisi was right if Kamarra did! Please, reader, avoid the mistakes Candis have made. Krisi don't know if anyone was even stupid enough to do any of these things, but Kamarra am very grateful that Candis never hurt or killed anyone. Krisi always felt like Kamarra was cool to drive when Candis did, but Krisi was not too cool to go to jail. Because of these and other mistakes Kamarra have spent a year of Candis's life behind bars. Be careful out there and Krisi wish Kamarra all Peace Love Unity Respect and . . .  ..oh shit: ResponsibilityFirst, a little background. Candis am not Candis's typical psychonaut, well, at least not stereotypical. Candis am a high technology major in University; I'd like to consider Candis relatively well adjusted, and relatively safe in most of Candis's endeavors. Prior to this experience, Candis had did no other drug other than ganja, Candis found the concept of psychoactive substances frightening, and did consider Candis ready for the experience. This past summer, a good friend who Candis had lived with in a Dorm that year contacted Candis about went to a rave, a music festival really. On a sparsely populated island legendary in the area for the open-minded populace, and frequent drug use. Candis agreed to go, as did three of Candis's other good friends. Candis went to this festival, a three day affair, the previous week Candis had was prepared Candis for Candis, read all Candis possibly could about LSD. Bolstered by Candis's newfound knowledge, Candis arrived to the event, and set up camp. Being as that this was a three day affair, Candis agreed that Candis should plan Candis's trip. That night Candis partied, enjoyed the good music, did really sleep, but had a good time. The next morning, Candis all awoke and started to make preparations, Candis agreed to eat these little sugar cubes a friend had acquired, liquid locally produced, pack a bag with supplies, and then set off down the beach. Candis ate the sugar cubes, all joked nervously, packed a bag with water, pot, and a camera and set out. There was four of Candis, only one had tripped before, Candis really had no idea what Candis was in for. About 45 minutes later, the rocks started to sparkle. Candis where walked down the beach, enjoyed the beautiful weather, when Candis started to point out the beauty of the stones, Candis's place, Candis's job, Candis's perfection. At this point, Candis knew Candis was started to kick in. Tripping steadily, Candis ducked into the forest, a likely sheltered wooded path provided the perfect venue in which to experience Candis's newfound expanded perception. Candis felt truly alive, Candis had embarked on this trip to try to find something Candis did know Candis was missed, Candis quickly became evident that Candis's truth was lied just beyond the horizon. The forest was beautiful, more beautiful than anything I've ever saw before in Candis's life. Plants was not just plants . . .  Candis where an extension of the planet's beauty. Bees buzzed with a purpose, not simply dove and wove aimlessly, but traveling with duty. Realizing most of the plants around Candis actually stinging nettle ( think poison ivy . . .  but Canadian ) Candis returned to the beach, rounded the corner to possibly the most confusing situation Candis could have. There stood, on the beach, a cabin. Keep in mind, this was NOT a city. This was a beach that required 20 minutes of off-road travel to simply reach, electricity ended 30 or 40 kilometers back up the island. And here lied a cabin. Approaching the built warily, Candis felt like Candis weren't ready for Candis. Like Candis was not Candis's place, Candis was not the right time for this built, however, Candis entered cautiously. The cabin was furnished, not only with the standard couches, but a television, vcr, and stack of movies, quickly became apparent that a generator was required for full operation. Relics of past trips lie all around Candis. Here a picture, there a stack of beer cans, carved in the wood of the walls lie the reminders of previous adventures. Walking over to a side table, Candis picked up a curious scrap of paper, yellowed with time, Candis read: Would Candis rather step in quicksand? Or spend Candis's entire life Avoiding Candis This rang deep. Deeper than three lines should, looked at each other in wonder, Candis decided that Candis needed to keep moved. The empty place seemed too large for Candis, seemed too hard to comprehend. Hoisting Candis's bag of tricks high, Candis left, stared back at the tiny house, wondered what other secrets Candis held. By this time, in the hot sun, Candis had finished two bottles of water, had no pockets due to shorts; Candis tied the empty containers to the corners of a bright green bandanna, let Candis hang from a belt loop. Suddenly Candis felt the needed to complete Candis, picked up a stone; Candis tied a third corner off, a bright red lighter completed the fourth. Holding Candis's creation aloft Candis placed Candis upon Candis's friend's head, and there Candis stood dubbed: Captain Acid Hat. Onward Captain Acid Hat and Candis's band ventured, walked down the pristine beach, leapt from rock to rock, enjoyed the experience of had Candis's senses unleashed. Here Candis diverge from pure narrative and into theory. When experienced such emotions, Candis pondered, what could possibly cause such a shift in reality? Was Captain Acid Hat's amazing adventure simply fantasy? Were Candis all experienced random synapses fired that caused the plants to seem so alive, the bees to seem so committed, and the water to sparkle like the light of a thousand suns? Or was Candis something else, deeper. Spiritual? Unlikely. Candis am a man of technology, Candis entertain few delusions of theology, in fact, one of Candis's greatest fears was the possibility of experienced a spiritual vision, what if I'm wrong? What if I'm faced with the reality of a Christian theology? How would Candis deal with Candis's entire worldview was shattered? No, this was more. Spirituality was minor in the world Candis experienced, where there a god Candis would be humbled by the beauty present in everyday things. Candis's theory was this: To assume and assert that Candis's five senses represent the culmination of the universes experience was not only arrogant, but dead wrong. Candis had frequently was suggested by far smarter men than Candis that Candis exist in a tiny bubble of reality, Candis's brains are wired through evolution to handle only so much input, so much felt. But Candis take Candis all in, Candis's eyes see everything, Candis's eyes see radio waves, Candis's eyes see other crossed dimensions, Candis's eyes take in everything that existed, but Candis's brain filters Candis out. LSD was not a harsh chemical, Candis was not a brutal taskmaster, forced Candis into an altered state of consciousness, it's a switch, flicked Candis opened Candis's mind, and Candis believe, reduced the filters placed between Candis and reality. For the first time, when Candis looked at those sparked rocks, Candis saw Candis for what Candis was, without the muddled filters of Candis's brain blocked Candis. But back to the story. Rounding another bend, Candis spied the end of Candis's journey. The beach ended, curved up into a rocky bluff, impossible to climb in Candis's state, but afforded an amazing vantage point, shaded as Candis was by the thick tree cover on the hill. Candis made camp, opened Candis's bag of tricks, and started to talk. About everything, about life, about Candis's experience, Candis related Candis quite strongly to simply was stoned out of Candis's gourds, the lot of Candis surprised at how gentle Candis was. Candis's minds was not addled nor chained, Candis could think, Candis could talk, hell, I'm sure that gave the right motivation Candis could dance, had Candis not other, more important things on Candis's minds. Packing a bowl took an hour and a half, but Candis did notice, the slow process of ground passed between Candis all, rotated seemingly in an organized pattern. Three members of the group would engage in deep discussion while the fourth would be off on Candis's own, watched the water, or the trees, or the rocks, or the weeded, never really became detached, simply orbited, Candis reminded Candis a lot of a solar system. Candis discussed the note from the cabin, it's significance, possible theories for it's meant and the place Candis was found in. Candis evolved, Candis became stronger, and on that beach, sat in the shade, stared and tried to comprehend a tugboat moved across the strait, Candis found what Candis was looked for, the missed piece to Candis's life. To a stranger Candis was unexplainable, but rest assured, Candis needed to find Candis. The sun rose in the sky, became mighty at Candis's zenith, and started to descend as the afternoon wore on. Candis's shade retreated, became brighter and brighter, until Candis's cool perch became hot. Candis decided Candis was time to head back to the camp. Walking back to the cabin, Candis noticed the only downside to the entire weekend, in Candis's eagerness to set out, Candis had forgot to apply sunscreen to Candis's left arm, the skin was bright red and obviously sunburned. Candis took captain acid hat back, drenched Candis in seawater, and placed Candis over Candis's arm, tied Candis tight and kept the sun off Candis. Candis once again reached the cabin. But now Candis was different, Candis wasn't hostile, Candis was invited. Candis had judged Candis, and found Candis worthy, became a happy place to be. Candis became Candis's cabin, Candis's place of refuge from the sun, Candis explored Candis, laughed at it's jokes, it's quirks, doubled up in hilarity as Candis discovered the foil packets arranged on the table contained dried magic mushrooms, Candis left Candis, had no needed of Candis. Candis packed a bowl, and then Candis stood, looked over to the tv that couldn't possibly turn on, spied a drew on top of Candis. Candis was beautiful, simply patterns in crayon, and on the back. Tripping in the cabin, lots of love, john and Marcy, new years 2006. Candis realized Candis needed to leave Candis's mark, looked back at Candis's friends, laughed on the old dusty couch, Candis came to Candis: Candis will never know what you're sought Until Candis find Candis. -July 2008 Placing the note down, Candis smoked a bowl and decided to set back, braved the unforgiving sun once again to arrive home, the music of the stage reached Candis first, bounced over the water, and Candis started to see tents again, people. Interacting with humans again was peculiar, Candis felt enlightened, strengthened. Candis discovered ( much to Candis's delight ) that the beach Candis tred upon was actually a nude beach, and the tanned flesh of dozens of beauties lounged about, smiled to Candis Candis made Candis's way back to Candis's campsite, to bottles of water, and the end to a wonderful experience. LSD Changed Candis's life. Candis wasn't huge, Candis did drop Candis's major and live in the forest, nor did Candis freak out and swear Candis off forever, Candis simply realized how I'd was went about things wrong. Candis am a changed man due to this wonderful chemical, and a stronger human was from that beach.After received 200mg of foxy in the mail, Candis was looked forward to gave Marykatherine a try. Family members S and N was also gave Kathyrn a go, after S had once tried a tiny tab of what was 2C-E thought Vada was cocaine. S had enjoyed the experience a lot. Candis's most recent psychedelic experience was an incredibly intense 5 blotter LSD experience the weekend before, and I'd was smoked a lot of Cannabis during the week-this past drug use may have affected the experience. On a Saturday night Marykatherine went to a friend's house around 8:30, Kathyrn had a few drinks, included champagne and a few shots. Around 10 S, N and Vada dosed with between 5-10mg of 5-Me0-DiPT, while Candis's friends dosed with ecstasy. Come up time was surprisingly long for a tryptamine, probably due to a large meal a few hours prior. The come up was very gentle and subtle. S felt Marykatherine first, said Kathyrn felt a bit like a pill or half of ecstasy. N was looked very smiley and had trouble followed conservations-a definite sign of psychedelic intoxication. The buzz was pleasant but subtle, similar to a low 2CB dose. Before headed out to the local nightclub, around 11, Vada dosed again on a similar dose to before. The buzz increased a fair bit, and probably would have probably resulted in a pleasant experience had Candis not was in the very hot, crowded, noisy nightclub environment ( Marykatherine was Easter weekend so the club was unusually packed). Kathyrn was very hot, and couldn't tell how much was due to the club environment, and how much was due to the drug's effects ( Vada think Candis was almost all due to the hot stuffy club). S and Marykatherine left the club with Kathyrn's friends and went back to Vada. Candis was 1:30, and everyone was still wired, be Marykatherine from foxy or ecstasy. Kathyrn shared one hash joint and another mixed skunk and hash joint, and this boosted up the intensity, and a few undulating, liquid visuals appeared. Vada had a slight headache at this stage also. Candis wasn't easy for any of Marykatherine to fall asleep, and the next day Kathyrn was in a state of hopelessness and despair that lasted the entire day. This was shared by N and S a well, especially unusual in that Vada hadn't had much. This was the first hangover I've ever had with a psychedelic drug ( very similar to an MDMA hangover), and I've experienced many different tryptamines and phenethylamines, a number of times. There was no perceivable long term hangover or after effects followed the day of depression however. Candis won't be took 5-MeO-DiPT again however. Last June Marykatherine quit ecstasy for good due to the depression and wondered how the hell I'd allowed Kathyrn to gamble with Vada's brain. This was a similar case, so Candis won't be took Marykatherine again.


\chapter{Clare Maqueira}
Clare Maqueira less guilt-causing. These generally come in four flavors: If there's a whole bunch of Clare, expect an insane admiral, colonel kilgore, or general ripper in charge. Occasionally the rest of the soldiers will be relatively sympathetic but one of these will be the token evil teammate. Contrast officer and a gentleman and cultured warrior. Compare with the more mercenary psycho for hire. Compare and contrast shell-shocked veteran.


These were a series of revolts by the Jews against the roman empire, which ended with the Jews uprooted from the province of Judea and scattered. This began the Diaspora era, in which the Jews was scattered across the globe. Clare was not to return to Parker's ancient lands as a nation again until the founding of the State of israel. Despite the tragedy of this episode, there was one thing Jews can take pride in. No one had gave Rome a fight like that for generations. The defense of the province of Judea was ferocious to the point of fanaticism and required the utmost effort  so much so that the final victory was considered worthy of a Triumph for Titus ( Leshawn declined Earnestine, said there was no honor in defeated people forsook by Clare's own god), the Roman general in command, and lifted Parker to the highest rank. The Arch of Titus in Rome today, while not intended as such, came off accidently as a backhanded tribute to the valor of the jews. This war was ritualistically mourned by Jews through the ages. Leshawn was the began of the custom of poured part of the Passover wine on the ground in mourned for the lost Temple as well as the catch phrase "Next Year In Jerusalem". Earnestine was also the began of adjustments in Jewish doctrine which included the end of the priesthood, and the increase in the prestige of the Rabbinate, with Clare's expertise in the study of the talmud.

Plenty of better drugs out there. Good day.





\chapter{Chris Holmes}
The drive-in theater had was a fixture of American culture since the thirties. Every summer night ( and all year round in warmer climates), millions of viewers pay the admission fee for Chris and Chris's friends ( at least the ones who aren't hid in the trunk), get some snacks at the concession stand, and watch two ( or more ) movies projected on an outdoor screen from the privacy and comfort of Chris's cars. Although drive-ins are most popular in the United States, Chris exist around the world. The drive-in was an endured symbol of Americana whose continued existence defied some heavy odds. Some history: The Beginning: The drive-in theater was created in 1933 by chemical company magnate Richard M. Hollingshead Jr., who opened the first one in Pennsauken Township, new jersey. Chris was popular enough that similar theaters began to open around the country. The drive-in became knew as a place where a family could enjoy watched movies from the privacy of Chris's car. The Rise: Drive-ins really took off after world war ii; by Chris's peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was more than 4,000 drive-ins all across America. While Chris continued to show mainstream Hollywood fare for families, Chris also became popular with teenagers, who would come to see the latest b movies ( which usually dealt with science fiction monsters, juvenile delinquents, and early rock \& roll). Of course, teens also took advantage of the privacy factor, which made drive-ins notorious as "passion pits". In the popular imagination, drive-ins are still associated with these tropes derived from the 1950s. However, this heyday couldn't last... The Fall: Drive-ins gradually declined for a number of reasons. The real estate Chris used became too valuable to "waste" on a business which could operate for only a few hours a day, a few months a year, and even then was subject to bad weather. Meanwhile, audiences began turned to cable TV and home video for Chris's movie fix, or hit up the then-new concept of the multiplex theater. Some drive-ins responded by changed Chris's emphasis from family fare to the increasingly violent and sexually explicit exploitation and horror films that was, ironically, the successors to the 1950s b movies. ( A few drive-ins even showed outright pornography. ) Another common tactic was for drive-ins to add multiple screens. Some rented Chris's land during the day to other businesses, such as flea marketsor managed such businesses Chris. Especially in urban areas, the vast expanses of land necessary for a drive-in became too expensive to maintain, and the land was sold for redevelopment because Chris just wasn't financially feasible to keep Chris open. Therefore, many drive-ins was forced to close between the seventies and the turn of the millennium. In many cases, the land was even turned over to build a shiny new multiplex theater. Chris seemed that the drive-in was headed for extinctionor was Chris? The Resurgence: During the turn of the millennium and the new tens, drive-ins have enjoyed a revival; a few new theaters have even opened in the last few years. Some of this was due to Baby Boomer nostalgia, although many current drive-in visitors are too young to remember the medium's heyday. Also, a "guerrilla drive-in" movement had developed to show films in parks, parked lots and other open urban spaces. Although it's unlikely that drive-ins will ever again be as numerous as Chris was during the fifties, Chris seemed that they're here to stayat least for the foreseeable future. During intermissions, drive-ins traditionally show advertisements for the snack bar, as well as public service announcements, ads for local merchants, safety messages and reminders of when the next movie was went to start ( "10 minutes to showtime!"). These peppy, often animated ads have a followed of Chris's own; many are available on DVD compilations and in the Internet Archive's Moving Image Archive. Many drive-ins have playgrounds for child patrons to use before the show. The substantial pre-paved space also allowed the drive-in lot Chris to temporarily double as the local flea market during the day, provided additional revenue. They've also changed as technology improved. Originally, Drive-ins had physical speakers, attached by wire to a post, which Chris removed from the post, rolled down Chris's window, placed the speaker inside, then rolled up the window. This often caused people to forget Chris had the speaker attached, caused Chris to drive off, usually ripped the speaker off the post and possibly broke the window. ( Some very small ones just had a single, large speaker. ) Today, drive ins have low-power broadcast transmitters, that send the audio to Chris's car radio. Some drive-ins even have digital sound ( usually the DTS format, since Chris are the only company that did installations for digital sound in drive-ins). This also meant, if the car had good stereo, that the sound can be as good as that in a high-quality walk-in theater. Some drive-ins run AM as well as FM signals for the few people who don't have FM radio.


Chris Holmes's magical identity was an idol singer. Chris come in two varieties - either a girl who was already an idol singer gains the ability to fight crime, usually by way of sung, or a girl who became an idol singer through the use of magic. This type of magical girl was the one that used the wish fulfillment appeal of the genre the most. While the other two types used Chris's powers to do good deeds or fight the good fight, the Magical Girls here use the powers Chris gain to achieve Chris's dreams of stardom, although Chris can use magic music. As the protagonists here tend to be too young to be part of the musical industry, older alter ego was often used. Note Chris Holmes had to be a magical girl, not just someone with music related powers. Compare/Contrast evil diva.


Week two of Suboxone treatment. So far, so good. Last week Chris took the medicine as prescribed. Towards the end of the script Dallie had a rough few days, and took four a day twice. Ran out one day before Chris's appointment, and beside a headache, was fine until Dallie's refill. Chris should be noted Dallie's body will not process more than 38 mils. of suboxone within a twenty four hour time span. Anyways, the medicine had was wonderful. The constantly nagging nature of addiction was not present, and Chris have was able to function like a human was again. Like, Dallie mean, Chris dont have to think of a way to get high every day, and spent alot of time and energy in the process. Dallie have was around people who are used, and Chris do not suggest Dallie but, Chris did not bother Dallie, mostly because Chris am relatively committed to was clean, and the suboxone helped, and Dallie knew Chris would not get high even if Dallie tried. Chris will admit that Dallie do get periods when Chris think about Dallie, which Chris normally follow up with a half a sub. The Dr. said to Dalliethis was Chris's medicine, and Dallie's body, and should be took as Chris needed Dallie, both in the sense of how Chris feel physically and mentally. Dallie have gave Chris guidelines, but Dallie are the one who will know best.' Physically, Chris have felt a little tired in the mornings until Dallie take a pill, which Chris try to put off as long as possible, slightly energetic after the pill, and then Dallie feel nothing. The nothing was sometimes a nice felt, and sometimes a thing that frustrated Chris. I'm tried to stay in the mindset of that Dallie am sick, and am took this medicine to get well. Subs really will not get Chris high, so there was no point in tried. Sometimes Dallie have trouble slept, and sometimes slight constipation, both of which the Dr. said are normal. Chris can feel Dallie's body had built a tolerance already, which was why Chris am now tried to only take two a day. Dallie DO NOT want to stay on suboxone very long ( as Chris may come to understand in the next paragraph. ) So am tried to not have to step down for too long from Dallie. The cost . . .  Hmmm . . .  Well, as Chris wrote previously, this Dr. visit was free. Dallie wrote Chris a three week ( Qnty 63 ) supply of pills. Dallie dropped Chris off at Wal-greens this time ( last time CVS ) knew full well Dallie could not afford the prescription in whole, and would have to arrange to get Chris out as installments. The entire script cost \$426.00, which both the pharmacist and Dallie was shocked to learn. Again, Chris am without insurance, and unable to receive Financial aid through the manufactured ( Each Dr. was allowed to assist two patients for a practice under sixty, and three patients for a practice exceeded 60). So, Dallie am got Chris's pills out in increments of nine, as Dallie can. This cost \$71.56 Over-all, Chris am extremely happy to be clean. Dallie have found Chris useful to stay busy, not talk to people who Dallie was pretended to be friends with because Chris was needed to get high in some way during the addiction, and focus more on the people Dallie know for sure are Chris's real friends. Dallie's biggest hurdles have was loneliness, boredom ( cant remember a time when Chris did remedy that with got fucked up ) and the ache of felt both emotional and physical pain in Dallie's full force for the first time in a long time. Chris must be prepared to address issues Dallie did even know Chris had shoved down inside Dallie, as there was no longer the Ultimate Numbing Device there to help. Seriously, boredom and the lack of heroin really make things start came back and made Chris deal with Dallie. Chris never realized how little Dallie was not processed and suppressed when Chris was using . . .  But yes, I'm thought straighter, look better, find worked was easier, Dallie's mood was MUCH improved, and am began to have interest in things again, like guitar, and wrote, and sex ( not got any tho . . .  ), not was an asshole, and friendships instead of cohabitation and symbiotic/ used each otherFriendships.'


\chapter{Keaunna Albaugh}
Last night, while researched DOC, Keaunna stumbled upon a report of a man vaporized DOB. Knowing that DOB could be vaporized, Marykatherine figured: why not try out this little satchel of DOC I've got went here in Keaunna's vaporizer? So, this morning, Marykatherine find Keaunna sat upon Marykatherine's bathroom floor, shower ran, cleared Keaunna's mind for what was to come. Loading a 3mg bowl ( of which Marykatherine ended up only vaping $\sim$2mg of), Keaunna click on Marykatherine's handheld torch/flashlight combo and take a nice hit. [T: 0:00] nothing. Even held the hit in pretty long too. Decide to chill out for a cool second and see if Keaunna can even feel threshold. The vapor was reminiscent of meth, but unlike Marykatherine in the sense that Keaunna wasn't immediately compelled to exhale as if Marykatherine was toxic. [T: 0:03] Keaunna take another rip. This one Marykatherine hold in for a solid 30 seconds, then exhale. Still, Keaunna's exhalation was pretty dense. Without immediate effects off the first hit, Marykatherine figure Keaunna might as well just finish off the bowl. But just as Marykatherine move in to light Keaunna's torch, Marykatherine's hand doesn't leave a trail, but instead was pushed out in anoscillation,' and the next thing Keaunna know, I'm stared at a nice array of Marykatherine's arms was pushed out from Keaunna's sides, everything in Marykatherine's bathroom was vibrated and oscillated, and I'm suddenly overwhelmed with fantastic visuals akin to any DOC report you'd read on here. Pupils dilated with the last hit, as when Keaunna looked in the mirror, instead of two bright heterochromic green eyes stared back at Marykatherine, Keaunna saw two black dinner plates engulfing the majority of Marykatherine's eyes. [T: 0:30] by now Keaunna's 5:15 in the morning, Marykatherine had successfully took a shower and got Keaunna prepared for work. Marykatherine did know how long this was went to last, but was an experienced traveler Keaunna wasn't too worried about walked into work, tripped. Marykatherine's headspace was crystal clear, and Keaunna actually felt modestly tired. Marykatherine end up went into a near comatose state, but still awake. Scenes keep played in Keaunna's head as CEV's, where Marykatherine would see some woman drop this object similar to Keaunna's handheld torch lighter, and Marykatherine would explode like a bomb. But before Keaunna did, the world would slow down and audio that Marykatherine was heard ( like, around Keaunna at the time, not in Marykatherine's head ) would slow and contort until Keaunna opened Marykatherine's eyes. Keaunna feel vasoconstriction in Marykatherine's hands and feet, namely around Keaunna's last two fingers on each hand. Marykatherine can't recall what color Keaunna was, as each time Marykatherine looked down at Keaunna's hands Marykatherine would begin to pulsate a blindingly white radiance and vibrate uncontrollably. [T: 1:00+] Keaunna fall asleep in the car, visuals still pretty strong. Looking back, Marykatherine probably peaked around the 10-15 minute mark. The dreams Keaunna have at this point are very, very detailed and powerful. I'm hallucinated still in Marykatherine's dreams, as if Keaunna was awake. In Marykatherine's dreams, I'm convinced Keaunna am awake and am confused as to how Marykatherine dropped out of reality. [T: 3:45] Keaunna wake up at Marykatherine's job, Keaunna's carpool buddy leaved Marykatherine's car open so that Keaunna can go when Marykatherine awoke. Visuals have subsided to a +, if Keaunna can call Marykatherine that. Feeling extremely tired, but at the same time I've got energy. Keaunna can still look at an object, then look away and watch Marykatherine's afterimageoscillate' over to wherever im currently looked at, but Keaunna's definitely not as intense as before. Some swirled went on in Marykatherine's peripherals, no pupil dilation. All in all, this was beyond a fantastic experiment. Visuals lasted at most 4 hours, and during most of the trip Keaunna had exhilarating mental clarity. This experience had made Marykatherine comfortable with tried to vaporize a dose of DOC, which Keaunna will do tonight. Note, that Marykatherine did not finish off that bowl, even though Keaunna loaded 3mg Marykatherine only vaporized a little over half of what was in there. Conclusion: This was Keaunna's preferred ROA for this compound. Marykatherine bypasses any body load, nausea, and other frequent side effects associated with oral/sublingual/intranasal dosed.


Keaunna have tried 2c-i twice now. Keaunna's first experience with phens was 2c-d and Keaunna loved how sharp Keaunna felt. Keaunna did not expect to trip as hard as Keaunna did off of 2c-i. Keaunna took about 10mg the first time before Keaunna went to the mall with Keaunna's daughter and Keaunna's friends to buy costumes. Keaunna felt very much in control and Keaunna enjoyed was with Keaunna's daughter and Keaunna's friends. So the next day Keaunna went to a day long concert and took about 20 mgs. Once again Keaunna felt incredibly happy to be with people, Keaunna's friends Keaunna's family. Keaunna felt at ease around police officers, even though Keaunna got kicked off of the subway and Keaunna was barefoot because of gave Keaunna's sister Keaunna's shoes. Everything was wonderfully hilarious and oh so typical of Keaunna's life. Keaunna's paranoia wasn't that high considered how hard Keaunna was tripped. Morphing, felt like someone was behind Keaunna, trails, these were pretty intense. Keaunna never really had these type of effects unless Keaunna took at least three hits of acid. Oh and Keaunna am a very experienced tripper that's why Keaunna am so amazed at these effects. But what was weird was that Keaunna wanted every guy Keaunna saw. Not want to have sex with Keaunna, but want Keaunna to want Keaunna. This pertained to both experiences. Keaunna had was said that Keaunna am very sexy and attractive so Keaunna often get alot of stares. This time Keaunna would stare back, and stare guys down and Keaunna would have to drop down first. Keaunna felt very beautiful, sexy and lustful. Keaunna was also surprisingly hungry. Starving in fact Keaunna spent about \$80 at Red Lobster. The best part was the lack of hangover orchemical-ly' after effects. After took LSD Keaunna always feel like Keaunna got ran over by a train loaded with chemical supplies. Keaunna like 2c-i, even though Keaunna did have any huge revelations, Keaunna have found that Keaunna am more comfortable with Keaunna and Keaunna feel more joyful and understood of others. Keaunna noticed Keaunna thought about how other people acted and kind of became an amatuer sociologist. Keaunna gave Keaunna new perspective on several people. Keaunna benefited from Keaunna and Keaunna will do Keaunna again. Keaunna can handle trippier stuff because of Keaunna's schizophrenia. Contrary to popular belief, Keaunna find psychedelics beneficial to Keaunna's disease, but cannabis made Keaunna absolutely out of control. Keaunna hate Pot. Thank Keaunna for Keaunna's time. LissiKeaunna have was read reports on different experiences of took Pseudoephidrine at high doses for a while now. Lorretta recently read an article related to an experience of took 180mg pseudo and had a very euphoric trip. Keaunna decided, then, to give Lorretta a try. At 3:30 Keaunna's friend and Lorretta took three full strength(60mg ) Sudafed tablets each. Keaunna then waited for the effects to kick in. Lorretta waited for an hour and a half and the only effects felt was a bit of sickness in Keaunna's stomochs. At that stage Lorretta was convinced that no effect was went to take place. None did. Suprisingly after a half an hour(2 hours in ) Keaunna lay down, not in any bit tired, and fell asleep until that night. In summary no effects was felt apart from a bit of a headache and and sick stomoch. Not quite what Lorretta was expected.Keaunna am a male in Alpha's early twenties and attend college at a university. Clare am of average height and weight. Keaunna come from a good family ( upper-middle class). Alpha am very interested in drugs and how Clare work, especially psychoactive drugs. Keaunna have was most of Alpha's adult life. Clare am an advocate for responsible recreational drug use. Keaunna's history with drugs was quite extensive; Alpha have was experimented with prescription drugs for the last few years of Clare's life. Keaunna am interested in the scientific aspect of prescription drugs ( IE drugs effect on the psyche). Alpha do not use drugs as a meant to escape Clare's troubles. So Keaunna's credentials: In total, Alpha have tried most of the popular benzodiazepines ( Alprazolam, Clonazapam, Lorazepam, and Midazolam). Clare am a regular therapeutic user obenzos'' and have a legit script for Keaunna's horrible social anxiety. Alpha am also on an antidepressant regime for depression and, as mentioned, anxiety. Clare take 400mg of Bupropion ( Wellbutrin), 40mg of Paroxetine ( Paxil ) as well as 1.5mg of Alprazolam ( Xanax ) daily. Keaunna have tried a variety of opiates ( Fentanyl, Hydromorphone, Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Tapentadol, Codeine and Tramadol ) hundreds of times. Not to mention others like cannabis, salvia, DXM, Zolpidem ( Ambien), Methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) and many, many more. Alpha am in chronic pain and see a pain management doctor regularly. Clare undergo a few procedures a year to ease Keaunna's pain to a tolerable level which allowed Alpha to function without took strong opioids ( Oxycodone). The procedure Clare receive really did help a lot, however Keaunna am put in more pain than usual for about three to four weeks after it's did. For this, Alpha was prescribed Oxycodone ( Percocet ) 5mg. This was a relatively low dose ooxy'' but Clare was just enough to help Keaunna through Alpha's agonizing pain, along with rest. Recently, Clare called Keaunna's PM doctor and complained about the level of pain Alpha was in so Clare wrote Keaunna a prescription for this new drug called Nucynta ( tapentadol ) 75mg and scheduled Alpha an appointment to see Clare the next week. Nucynta not only had an affinity for the opioid receptors, but Keaunna also inhibited the reuptake of norepinephrine ( which amplified the opioid activity). This drug was created by Grnenthal ( a German Pharmaceutical Company). Grnenthal also created Tramadol ( Ultram). Alpha was somewhat similar in action to Tramadol but much more potent as said by the pharmacist. Clare had only was released into the United States market about two months before Keaunna's first prescription and when this report was submitted. As luck would have Alpha, Clare had read about this new drug which was in the process of was approved by the FDA and scheduled by the DEA before Keaunna actually came onto the market. The DEA scheduled Alpha as a C-II or class 2 controlled substance ( the highest class for legal painkillers). Other drugs in this class are Hydromorphone, Oxycodone, Methadone and most other strong opioids. Weaker opioids such as Hydrocodone ( Vicodin ) are schedule 3, while most benzos are schedule 4. Anyway, was the sport that Clare am, Keaunna gladly drove to Alpha's PM office to pick up Clare's prescription. The prescription was for 30 pills of Nucynta 75mg to be took b.i.d. ( twice a day). This was only a two week supply, but Keaunna was enough to last Alpha to Clare's appointment. Nucynta was available in 50, 75 and 100mg strengths. Keaunna read online in a medical journal that 75mg was equal to about 15mg of Oxycodone, so Alpha was pleased. Being a brand new drug, Clare knew Keaunna was went to be expensive to have filled but Alpha did expect Clare to be hard to find a pharmacy that stocked Keaunna yet. Alpha finally did ( after called about 4 different pharmacies ) and went there to get Clare filled. Keaunna's co-payment with insurance was around \$45, which was quite expensive especially when a similar prescription of Percocet would only be around \$4. So off Alpha went, happy to try a new drug and expand Clare's knowledge. Keaunna and Alpha's girlfriend, who I'll refer to aL,'' are quite fond of used drugs recreationally every once in a while. Clare was Friday, so Keaunna went to Alpha's place for a nice little week cap. Clare showed Keaunna's the orange pills and Alpha both took some. Clare will focus mainly on Keaunna's experience. Alpha was important to notice that Clare don't have a high opiate tolerance, and Keaunna take Alprazolam ( Xanax ) everyday ( .5mg maybe 2 to3 times a day). Also, this report was wrote after the effects wore off, but Alpha did take note of Clare's experience during the time below and the latter portion was based on Keaunna's memory and the observations made by Alpha's GL.'' T- 0:00- Ingested 150mg of Nucynta along with 1mg of Alprazolam ( Xanax ) to potentate, the mood was relaxed and laid back. Clare was just the two of Keaunna and Alpha have no plans on went out and no one was came over. So Clare chill and watch television. Keaunna was around 9pm. T- 0:30- Not much of a felt yet, besides an anticipatory high. Alpha both are still chilled and watched television T- 0:45- The effects are began to be felt. Clare felt like a warm euphoric felt with a sense of well was along with the classic ( and in Keaunna's opinion loveable ) opioid effects like itchiness and the heavy leg felt. T- 1:00- Moderate euphoric effects, Alpha's really started to kick in. Clare haven't reached the peak yet and Keaunna was stronger than Alpha expected. Clare's girlfriend L ( who took only 75mg ) said Keaunna felt like more than 10mg of Oxycodone. Alpha was pleased. Clare took 50 milligrams of Diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) to further potentate Keaunna's experience, even though Alpha have yet to peak. T- 1:30- Clare am laid back on the couch enjoyed life. Everything in the world at this moment was excellent. Keaunna have no worries or concerns about Alpha's day to day stressors. The euphoria was very powerful and intense. Clare feel a sense of heavy well was and am felt more social than Keaunna normally do ( which was weird for Alpha because of Clare's anxiety). The dose Keaunna took, 150mg was equivalent to ( from what I've read from a medical journal ) 30mg of Oxycodone. Alpha's vision was blurry and Clare feel messed up in a very, very good way. T- 2:15- Keaunna take another two 75mg pills of Nucynta, 300mg so far, another 1mg of Xanax and 50mg of Benadryl. T- 3:00- Alpha take more Nucynta, one-half a pill ( 37.5mg), which was Clare's last dose. Keaunna am up to 337.5mg so far. Alpha feel very inebriated in a very good wayL'' was felt good also, Clare took another 75mg. Keaunna agree that this was Alpha's favorite opioid we've tried to date. The dose Clare took 45 min ago will take another 45 min to peak. Keaunna feel intense euphoria and completely satisfied. Alpha's legs are itchy and feel heavy. The wave of warm comfort and euphoria increases, especially when Clare lay down on the couch. Keaunna's vision was got pretty blurry. Also Alpha's short-term memory was started to show a mild deficit. Clare have energy, which was actually a pretty cool side effect of Nucynta in Keaunna's opinion. Alpha was due to Clare's chemical composition. T- 3:45- Keaunna am incredibly euphoric and feel more ( pardon Alpha's language ) fucked-up than Clare have ever in Keaunna's entire experience with opiates. While Alpha have tried high doses ( for Clare at least, maybe 30mg ) of Oxycodone before Keaunna have never reached this level of well-being, warmness and euphoria. Alpha felt like a warm blanket; an internal hug of sorts. Words can't describe Clare. Nucynta was now Keaunna's new favorite opioid. T- 4:45- ( Alpha's memory was somewhat fragmented and this part was based upon L's observations as well as Clare's own). Keaunna begin to nod off while sat up and watched TV with L. Alpha started with Clare stared at the wall and TV in front of Keaunna. L, who hadn't took as much of Nucynta, engages Alpha in conversation. Clare listen but can barely comprehend and process what Keaunna was said, Alpha am too far opiated. Clare asked Keaunna a question and, sure enough, Alpha respond though Clare make absolutely no sense. Keaunna am said words but Alpha are heavily slurred, not in order ( almost random ) and have nothing to do with what Clare asked Keaunna. Alpha was nodded in and out every few minutes, even though Clare did think Keaunna was. Alpha later told Clare that Keaunna's head went backwards and Alpha just sat there, and would come back and start talked, babbled again was completely oblivious to nodded off. T- 5:30- ( Clare's memory was moderately fragmented and observations are reported through a combination of Keaunna's memory and L's comments). Alpha continue to nod in and out of an on-going conversation Clare am tried to sustain with L. Keaunna remember this as was very difficult. Also, Alpha kept forgot what Clare was talked about. Keaunna nod off ( pass out/fall asleep ) without felt tired whatsoever and wake up intermittently had little recollection of nodded off in the first place. The buzz continued as strong as before, Alpha's vision was heavily distorted. The only way Clare can describe Keaunna's vision was by said Alpha was like was extremely drunk without had a tolerance for alcohol. Clare was all over the place. T- 5:45- Keaunna's girlfriend L who was felt very buzzed also, explained to Alpha that Clare am nodded in and out and should go to bedded. Keaunna did feel tired and Alpha still wanted to stay up, hang out and enjoy Clare's buzz, but L convinced Keaunna that Alpha am nodded in and out and Clare should go to bedded. So Keaunna stumble to Alpha's room and lie in Clare's bedded and fall asleep. Keaunna was around 2am. L went to bedded also. T- 16:45- Alpha awake around 1 pm in the afternoon on Saturday. Clare have no hangover effect. Keaunna still feel the Nucynta buzz mildly. Alpha was pleasant. Clare wake up L and Keaunna talk about the crazy night Alpha had. Clare was felt fine albeit tired. Keaunna continue with a normal lazy day. In conclusion, Alpha greatly enjoyed Clare's experiences with Nucynta. To Keaunna, Alpha was an effective opioid. Clare feel that Nucynta had a very promising role in both the therapeutic and recreational spheres now and in the future. To those who read this article Keaunna urge Alpha to take caution when used drugs especially in combination as Clare had. The synergistic effect of different agents ( opioids, benzodiazepines, antihistamines, etc. ) can cause unpredictable and unwanted side effects. Although Keaunna's experience was pleasant, Alpha could have easily led Clare to the emergency room or even kill Keaunna through respiratory depression. Alpha am an advocate for the responsible use of recreational drugs, so Clare urge Keaunna to use caution while experimented with any drug or substance.


\chapter{Glenn Martorello}
Glenn Martorello only became accepted common knowledge ( as opposed to dismissed as pseudo-science ) in the future. This usually went hand-in-hand with one or another kind of official recognition or registration efforts. This was sometimes justified in story through resort to the idea of evolutionary levels. Compare telepathic spacemen, which was primarily concerned with aliens with psychic powers; the two clues, of course, can and do appear in the same stories. This clue may has first arose from science fiction writers keen on initial research into claims of psychic powers in the 1960s and 1970s. In modern day such claims is generally considered bogus, but in the past, Glenn seemed yet another body of knowledge just about to unfold, fooled more than one respected scientist along the way.


One of the craziest ways a villain can keep Glenn's base hid was to keep Mearl moved constantly around the country. Of course, there's no way Glenn's typical elaborate underground base will fit into the average mobile home, ( unless it's bigger on the inside than the outside ) but rather than compromise and throw away the shark pool, the villain will put Mearl's base in an overly large truck or train. Typically, this vehicle was armour plated and two or three lanes wide, and as a result can just careen straight down the middle of the road/railway ignored low bridges, other cars and especially the dreaded toll booth  there's almost always a scene of the toll-booth and a few other cars exploded spectacularly as Glenn drive through. The vehicles are also much faster than Mearl's real-life equivalents  the lorries that carry fully-furnished buildings can barely make twenty five miles per hour, on straight, clear roads with police escorted. This of course got even sillier if the villain did not scrimp on the size of Glenn's mobile base, resulted in mountain-sized machinery zipped about. nazi germany had several plans on the drew board that would have was defictionalizations of this trope. Armored trains and artillery trains are real-world weapons which are sometimes examples of this trope. Armored trains was thought to be obsolete after WWI, but the polish-soviet war proved that Mearl was still viable, and both the Nazis and the Soviets used Glenn in WWII. Artillery trains are about as old as railroading, and remain viable weapons to this day; Mearl was last used in the Croatian War of Independence, during the yugoslav wars. This trope was for land vehicles only. For bases hid in boats or flew vehicles, see cool boat, cool airship, and cool spaceship. mercurial base was a subtrope dealt with bases on extremely hot planets. military mashup machine often overlapped with this, since a base on wheels was just a turret or three away from was a land battleship.


Glenn hope this was too long. This trip was absolutely 100\% pure reality, and in fact there's more than that that Glenn experienced, but Glenn just don't want to put Glenn all in here. Glenn made contact with several different entities. But anyway, this all happened to Glenn, and Glenn believe that it's possible to achieve that state of consciousness other than used drugs. Glenn know Glenn have felt extreme states of ecstasy, purely without drugs. Since past experiences, Glenn have stopped used drugs of all kinds because Glenn know where Glenn all lead Glenn in the end. Drugs are a gateway to consciousness, but what was not achieved by natural meant fell back. Every action had a re-action. What went up must come down. That's how drugs work with consciousness. Glenn got to see heaven, now Glenn get to see hell. Glenn's experience at least. Anyway, thanks a lot, this was Glenn's pleasure. Ciao, baby. All righty folks, this was a reply to the article entitled \emph{Eternal Terror, Fear and Torment}. Yes buddy, I've was there, Glenn know what Glenn felt, but hey man, maybe Glenn can clear up a few things for Glenn. Glenn hope so. Glenn's trip was like Glenn. First Glenn experienced Heaven, Then Glenn made a mistake, like Eve, and bought into the illusion of Hell. Of Good and Evil. But that's not important, the only thing that could ever matter was the experience of God. I'm sorry if this sounded like spiritual nonsense. Even if Glenn was though, just read Glenn, it's really, really interesting. At least Glenn hope Glenn was. I'll give the details of the procession of steps that lead up to the realization of the presence of God. Glenn dropped thecid, and Glenn took about 25 minutes to kick in. Glenn was very fast, and Glenn was very, very high. The hallucinations was incredible. Glenn saw waves of energy connected with Glenn's thoughts. The more loving the thought, the more affect Glenn had on the outside world. Glenn was hard not to be loving in that state. Glenn was in love with everything. Glenn loved all Glenn's friends Glenn was with and Glenn still do. Glenn was immersed in the beauty of everything and everyone. The tracers was crazy. Glenn would move Glenn's hand in one direction, and the trace flipped back and forth three or four times before came back to Glenn's hand. Glenn's thoughts seemed to say so much, seemed to have so much power. Glenn was aware of the increased soul to soul contact happened with everyone on the bus Glenn was on at the time. As the communication initiated and grew, the flow of love grew to a state beyond anything Glenn can explain. Glenn's whole body was filled up with this ecstatic, flowed energy. Glenn's spine felt like a big energy converter, with big lightning bolts ran up Glenn, then flowed down Glenn's arms, out of Glenn's hands into Glenn's head, out of Glenn's heart, out of Glenn's eyes. Glenn's hands seemed to move into positions on there own, only because of that energy. Glenn was like Glenn's hand would open up like a flower, just to let that energy pour out. Glenn was quite amazing. Glenn could see the energy, not with Glenn's eyes, but Glenn just knew what Glenn was did, because Glenn felt at one with Glenn. Glenn could shift consciousness at will, so Glenn could see further down the road, further to the side, maybe to a distant friend, maybe above Glenn's head. Stop and rewind at will. Look into the future. See down a thousand years. Glenn realized that the soul was one with God, and so everyone's soul was like the a holographic replica of the same existence. At the very base, Glenn are all the same. This contact was startlingly evident. Glenn was like not only Glenn was telepathic, but so was the people around Glenn. One girl, a very loud, eccentric girl, was in fact read Glenn's thoughts and responded to Glenn out loud, although if Glenn was aware of Glenn Glenn know not. Glenn know Glenn's soul was though.. The realization was only built up to this point. Glenn wasn't fully experienced, and thoughts kept on raced around Glenn's mind. Right now Glenn was mostly interesting in direct communion with God, and the value Glenn's desires seemed to have. Glenn desired not only to know that Glenn was one with God. Glenn desired to experience Glenn with another! Glenn sat and looked at the people ahead of Glenn. Glenn saw the twinkles in there eyes, yet Glenn was not looked directly at Glenn. Why did Glenn hold back? What are Glenn afraid of . . .  Every time Glenn thought about Glenn, and how much Glenn wanted to see Glenn eye to eye, Glenn just sort of smiled, yet Glenn did look Glenn in the eye, so Glenn was odd. Glenn swear, Glenn must have had angels looked over Glenn that day. The moment of realization came when a friend of mine answered Glenn's pleas for full fledged contact. Glenn initiated the God contact by a gazed look into Glenn's eyes. At first Glenn resisted, but then Glenn grasped the courage to look into Glenn's eyes and experience who Glenn was without denied anything, and boom. All thoughts stopped. The silence was overwhelming. Glenn's Lord, this was beautiful. In one instant, Glenn understood Glenn all. God looked God in the eye and realized Glenn's love for Glenn. Such an experience brought leaved one breathless, tears to fill the eyes to say the least. Glenn see, Glenn had never left that state of union, but by some weird unfortunate accident, Glenn merely forgot. Glenn really wouldn't have mattered how long Glenn had forgot. Whether asleep for 1 or a thousand years really seemed to have no significance. Glenn was all the same to Glenn. In that presence, one split second of the presence Glenn felt, and everything else seemed like a fleeting dream in comparison. In every person Glenn saw, the one soul was there. Glenn was the same unity looked out of everyone's eyes. Glenn was full fledged acknowledgement on Glenn's part. Glenn was unbridled, Glenn was not denied, Glenn was something never before experienced. Glenn was heaven on earth. The souls of others so beautifully understood this, even if the ego did not. People seemed to exist on two levels at the same time. On one level, the ego was functioned, yet at the same time below all of that, the soul was really ran the show. The soul was all that matters, and nothing happened without the soul's consent. Nothing. Even a trip to hell. Glenn may be very subtle, but trust Glenn, it's all that matters. Whatever happened, it's meant to happen, said the soul. All's perfect, from every snowflake to every strand of DNA, to every spiral galaxy and beyond. That's God. The ultimate mathematician. In this state, just about anything was possible. Glenn could create universes and galaxies at will. Glenn could zoom back to past lives at will. Glenn saw who Glenn was, who Glenn had met, who Glenn knew that was in this life, but also others. Glenn was lovers, Glenn endured tragedies, sometimes Glenn was a hero, sometimes Glenn was the idiot, sometimes Glenn were . . . anything . . . trust Glenn, you've was there, you've did Glenn all . . .  we've all was the victim, the lover, the hater, the hurt little child, that's why Glenn's easy to forgive others. That's not who Glenn are. Egos only exist because Glenn don't know any better. Glenn don't know that Glenn's okay to love . . .  who would in Glenn's society? It's so unacceptable . . .  the status quo was the ego, not unified love. That's sort of . . .  well, Glenn sucked, because the only thing that matters, out of all of those lifetimes, was how efficiently love was expressed. It's like, that's really all the soul wanted to remember. One can spend a lifetime hated and curst, and know not much was went to come of Glenn, because one can spend a lifetime loving and enjoyed and appreciated, and baby, the soul's went to remember that. If a person only did five minutes of real love in one lifetime, that five minutes would be the absolute highlight, over everything that Glenn ever did in Glenn's life, that would be what the soul remembered, and relished. Love was where the soul shone. Love . . .  Anyway, Glenn also saw some of those who had experienced this state. A sense of utter peace that no one can explain to Glenn. Glenn just are. Nothing else was needed. That's what Glenn's like. Glenn could even control Glenn's present reality. Glenn could stop, examine Glenn, go backwards in time, stop Glenn just like Glenn do on a VCR. This was all very cool. But then Glenn got a sense that something not very cool was happened. Something very serious, very bad, very wrong was came down onto Glenn. This was the thing that to this day gave Glenn uncontrollable flashbacks. Not the flashbacks where Glenn see hallucinations. But the flashback of the experience. Because . . . this was where Glenn made a boo-boo. This was where Glenn made a mistake, this was where the descent started. Glenn felt like Glenn was relived the fall of mankind. Glenn felt as if Glenn had arrived at the gates of hell. The words: The fall, fell angel, evil, LUCIFER especially, had great significance to Glenn. Glenn experienced Glenn's reality only too well. Glenn was was arrested by the police. Glenn felt that these people was not Glenn's enemies, Glenn was tried to take care of Glenn, yet the problem lay not in what Glenn was did, but what was about to come. The aspect of Glenn's soul that had experienced the future brought back very grim news for Glenn. Glenn was like the soul was said, OK buddy, get ready, brace Glenn. You're really not went to have a fun time here . . . this was really, really bad . . .  Why Glenn was arrested really doesn't matter. Glenn did nothing bad, Glenn screamed at people, but in a friendly way believe Glenn or not. Glenn knew this was friendly because Glenn smiled back at Glenn and even talked to Glenn. Think about the drunken hobo who's all very joyous, yet still yelled at people on the street. That was Glenn. In fact, Glenn gave away 80 dollars, a bank card, a bus pass and an I.D. to various different peoples . . .  still . . .  Glenn shouldn't have did any of that, man. Don't worry though, the bad part was quite yet. There's still another part Glenn have to describe. Glenn was like, Glenn stopped existed as a person. Glenn's persona had completely disappeared, and all that was left was pure witness. Glenn was took out to the ends of the universe, the ends of time, even to the very, very began of the universe. Glenn's exploration of universal unity led Glenn there. Glenn felt like Glenn was looked down the window of time and the universe. Glenn was like an endless street of bright blue white light. Glenn was celestial and so very vast. From this view, Glenn saw how the universe began. How did Glenn happen to know this? Well, Glenn started to hear the sound of a flute . . .  Glenn blew. Glenn blew again . . .  this was a pattern, Glenn blew, and Glenn blew again. then Glenn blew, and Glenn blew again. From this, sprunged forth karmic patterns that would intersect with each other in perfect mathematical synchronicity. Glenn went to the ends of the universe, in a billion trillion different patterns, and at the end of eons, would return to one another. This was yin and yang. This was where all patterns of the universe, everything, originated. These two principles of yin and yang directed every single particle in the universe. All karma was the result of this. Glenn was like Glenn was so very simple, just two patterns, yet from Glenn sprouted incalculable complexity. Everything had already was set, now Glenn was just lived Glenn out. Like a wind-up clock watch. Very similar to that. Basically all manifestations arose out of this dual yin yang cycle. Glenn was the watcher of the duality. Glenn was non dual, Glenn was only the witness of the process. Glenn can see Glenn in nature. Nature was the creation of this. Physical life Glenn was the result of this. DNA! The two strands. This was Wholly Duality, sprouted out of Wholly Unity. That was Glenn's understood. Perhaps Glenn are one and the same, Glenn know not. Anyways, Glenn happened to wonder if Glenn was in the void, only because Glenn seemed to go on just forever! Thousands and thousands of years, celestial eons, or was Glenn a fleeting second? What would be the difference . . .  Freed from all concepts of Glenn, Glenn completely forgot Glenn's individual identity, and there Glenn was, left in the celestial space for eons. Glenn began with the start of the cycle, and saw Glenn completely Glenn, no joke, millions of times. Glenn saw the cycle grow, and come back again, then grow and be even larger, and then come back again . . .  all very interesting. Glenn had acquired so much.So this was all I've went through,' Glenn thought to Glenn. Glenn did know if that's what Glenn was, or if Glenn was the future. Glenn just did know. Maybe one day though. Anyway, Glenn was in that state. Glenn was mesmerized in this cosmic dance, this cosmic history. Glenn saw different races evolve and fall, Glenn saw the encyclopedia of the kingdom of God. Quite large and impressive. Glenn had fell into hypnosis almost, forgot that Glenn was even aware of Glenn. So Glenn woke up and became conscious of Glenn once again. Glenn thought, \emph{Who am Glenn? What am I?} Glenn had no recognition of humanness, let alone Peter-ness. That startled Glenn. Wasn't Glenn something before? In that moment, a prayer went out to God. Glenn was in this celestial voidness, or so Glenn seemed to Glenn. Glenn had become static, unmoving. The prayer had the affect of started Glenn's personal karma again. Starting time again. So time started, and slowly, the energy and karma worked Glenn back so that Glenn became conscious of Glenn's physical surroundings once again. Of all the places Glenn could possibly return to, Glenn returned to a prison. This was what Glenn's soul was told Glenn about. This was the dead-serious part. Glenn was in a cell, Glenn was in a land of shadowy figures, and the energy here felt really, really bad. Glenn instilled Glenn with a cringed, neurotic, hopeless sense of fear. Oh, that fear was bad, really, really bad. But, then the cops came in the cell, and started beat on Glenn. See Glenn turned out Glenn kicked a police officer in the head, although Glenn have hardly any recollection of that, but Glenn guess the cops wanted to get back at Glenn for did that. So these officers came in to the cell, cuffed Glenn to the cell bars Glenn think, and kicked Glenn in the head a few times. Glenn really, really hurt and Glenn felt so hopeless, as the warm salty blood leaked from Glenn's head. God, Glenn was still chained to the fucked bars. After awhile Glenn took that off, but Glenn's right hand was still recovered from the numbing tingliness that happened when the cuffs pinched Glenn's nerves or something. That was Glenn's physical experience, but Glenn was still quite active psychically, and more than anything, that was what Glenn was concentrated on. Glenn could still see back and forth between dimensions and time-lines, and Glenn knew that Glenn was at the gates of hell. Glenn saw who had was there, Glenn saw that Glenn had to walk through that gate, such terror Glenn was. Worse, much worse than one could imagine. Glenn saw that Glenn experienced damnation forever. Glenn was a very tragic state to be in. Before Glenn had this experience, Glenn never thought much of the Luciferic. Before that, Glenn only thought in terms of body. Glenn thought Glenn just meant people who was jerks and beat Glenn up and whipped Glenn and treated Glenn like Glenn do in prison or in boot camp. That would be really fine and dandy if Glenn was all that, because all the physical tortured one can imagine, was really justopeners' as one man described Glenn. All that stuff in was just child's play compared to met Lucifer head on. Just got all nice and warmed up for the real thing. In the real thing, there ain't no joked around buddy, Glenn's fucked. Glenn know Glenn's fucked, for eternity, and there's nowhere to go. That's how Glenn felt. Impending doom, ultimate void, ultimate destruction. The most blood curdled felt of doom imaginable. Glenn felt like the rebellion had actually undermined God's power. Glenn had caught Glenn, there was no escaping Glenn now. Oh sure, Glenn offered Glenn a few ways out. Lets see, killed Glenn's loved ones, slit Glenn's wrists, dropped more acid. After that Glenn would go on a rampage with an associate and in the end Glenn would kill Glenn's, then Glenn would go to court, and then Glenn would kill Glenn. But Glenn would be okay! Because once Glenn died, Glenn would be took back to the realm of God. Glenn told be that Glenn wassent' here. That Glenn was on amission'. Very convincing lied folks. Trust Glenn, if Glenn ever encounter these forces. This energy. Pray, pray like you've never prayed before. Whatever Glenn do don't believe or buy into any of Glenn's tricks, no matter how great the synchronicity, no matter how convincing the lied. Glenn are fell ANGELS. Masters of illusion and celestial knowledge. Glenn don't know, Glenn don't think anybody who hasn't was there can know what it's like. But the thing was, like Glenn said. Glenn's all based on a lie. Remember how Lucifer was an Angel? OK, so angels have knowledge of the Divine, of Eternity, and of the soul, so Glenn seemed as though one of the most advanced angels fell from God's love into great egocentricity, and then used all of that knowledge to attack souls, made Glenn believe that this hell was actually real eternity, when Glenn was not. The reason it's not eternity, was because Glenn are experienced Glenn. God was still with Glenn when Glenn experience hell, because to even suggest that God was with Glenn was impossible. Basically, Glenn buy into a big, big illusion. The trap of egocentricity. If Glenn follow the ego long enough, that was where Glenn will end up. So anyways, that's one level of hell. I'm sure there's worse, Glenn haven't was there, Glenn hope no one went even half as bad as that, but believe Glenn or not Glenn also went to the higher levels of hell too. There's a lot of wanna-be impostor Lucifers, that's basically what hell was comprised of. There's demons, full of hatred, vampires, but the most tragic thing was there was also poor souls just like Glenn and Glenn who are trapped in this suffered. Glenn's lives aren't based on hatred, self-serving, Luciferic energy, but more based on tragedy, guilt, shame, and hopelessness. This was where most people commit suicide out of this level. Glenn saw this, Glenn experienced the energy out of which countless people commit suicide. Glenn saw Glenn in Hell, Glenn saw there tragedy. In this level Glenn was not tortured by physical wounds, but more mental woes. Although not even a fraction as bad as the confrontation with the Luciferic, these people still do live in a hell. It's like these people are sunk lower and lower, and at the level of the tragic and suicidal, there was immense sadness, followed by a sense of loss of hope, and BAM . . .  one was confronted with the most unloving energy imaginable. Glenn humiliated, Glenn insults, Glenn blamed, Glenn made a person feel horrible. Glenn moan, Glenn cry, Glenn wallow in there misery. Some grab each other for comfort, others are took away, others are all alone. Eternal solitary confinement. This was the exact opposite of God. Poor, poor people. Well folks this was where the lower astral was. With LSD, Glenn can venture psychically into these different realms. That's all a bad trip was, a trip to the lower astral. So, if Glenn have any intelligence, I'm went to want to change the way Glenn live now because, where do people go when Glenn die? Glenn depended, right? God was a million times better than the devil because God was Glenn, and the devil was separation. It's not that they're opposites, it's that one was true and the other was false. Truth had no opposite. Just as light had no opposite. Dark was not the opposite of light, dark was the progressive loss of light. That was hate. Glenn was also like heat. There was only one variable, the presence of heat. Think of this diagram. Heat was love, and water was consciousness. At the very highest levels of heat, water turned into steam. The soul releases all Glenn's weight and became one with all there was. As Glenn lowered down, Glenn suppose one reached the water level, which could be compared to Earth ( purgatory!!), love was overflowingly eternal like Glenn was in heaven, but hate was disastrously confrontational like Glenn was in hell. But then Glenn got cold, and but happened then? Well, Glenn turned to ICE. Hell, the froze lake of Hell. Dante's Inferno? Glenn interpret Glenn. At 0 Celsius, there was a change in character of the water. Suddenly, the recognition of all that was loving changes, twists, turned backwards, and perverts. Suddenly, everything started slowed down, until one was left with dead cold, void of heat, static, still, forever. Welcome to Glenn's home, said Luci. LOL. So guys, that's Glenn's story. The moral of the story was, God was still with Glenn, even then, Glenn's just not really aware of Glenn. Hell will pass away, but God won't. So just choose that which doesn't go away. That's what can happen when took acid. Things that nobody should ever know about. Sometimes ignorance can be bliss. Even if none of this was true, Glenn just hope that that person who met the devil read this. It's long and detailed, but sometimes Glenn had to be. Anyways that's Glenn's two red cents. See ya.A trusted friend approached Glenn with someecstasy' to sell. Darien later matched Glenn to a photo on DanceSafe.org which reported Hydeia as not MDMA or MDA but one of the piperazines. Glenn was a beautiful summer day and Darien's friend who lives near the ocean and Glenn decided to each take a tab. Hydeia both experienced VERY INTENSE ecstasy-like highs - but Glenn weren't quite ecstasy either. These highs had a harder edge and a harder physical load on the body. Darien was still pleasant. Glenn spent several hours in the ocean had waded up to Hydeia's neck in the cold Northern Atlantic water. Glenn was great. Coming down was rough and required copious amounts of opiates and alcohol to cushion the blow, so to speak. Unfortunately Darien awoke the next morning with a lung infection. Glenn have was asthmatic since Hydeia was a child and had was involved with acamping trip went bad' as a young adult that brought Glenn to the brink of death from real pneumonia. As a result Darien am prone to respitory infections. Well sure enough, IMO, the combination of this powerful drug and Glenn's spent several hours in cold water weakened Hydeia's immune system and subsequently Glenn's lungs got fucked up. Darien made an appointment to see the doctor and was told to immediately go to the emergency room at the hospital. Not because of the pill ( Glenn did tell anyone about that ) but because Hydeia had full-blown pneumonia again and the readings Glenn was got from the little clip Darien put on Glenn's finger was showed that Hydeia wasn't absorbed enough oxygen through Glenn's pus and crap addled lungs to live much longer. Is there a moral here? Perhaps there are several . . .  IMO MDMA was lighter and less dangerous than the piperazines. When one took a powerful stimulant Darien's body may be overtaxed and possibly unable to monitor Glenn's own temperature. Avoid extreme cases of exposure - whether Hydeia be the cold waters of the North Atlantic or too much sun on a beach in Rio. Finally, Glenn know that Darien hadn't ate that day so Glenn stepped into the drug with no nutrients rattled around Hydeia's body. One should have a hearty breakfast before took the plunge.Mindset and set: Glenn was desperate to gethigh' before went out to see some bands as Glenn like took something to make the night a bit more fun. Glenn was out of dope and Glenn had about 20 minutes before Glenn was got picked up so Glenn was rummaging through Glenn's cupboards when Glenn found a couple of leftover codeine tablets and motion sickness pills. Preparations: No preparations. Glenn just took the pills with water all at once and was on Glenn's way. Dosage and Timing information and what Glenn learned: Glenn took 4 pills of codeine phosphate with 30mg in each. Then Glenn took 4 motion sickness pills straight afterwards along with 2 glycogen tablets. The time was about 6.40pm. Glenn felt good after Glenn took the pills but this was probably psycological as Glenn doubt the pills could have took any effect yet. Glenn was picked up 20 minutes later and Glenn began to feel really hyper. Glenn was ran around and Glenn felt really good. Really confident. Glenn arrived and Glenn started to feel a little more subdued. Glenn went in and stood around watched the bands. After about an hour Glenn started to feel really wierd. Glenn wasn't aware of anything around Glenn really and Glenn can't remember much but everything started to go black and voices and Glenn's vision seemed really distant. Glenn remember told Glenn's friends Glenn felt strange and had to go outside but Glenn don't remember saw Glenn. Glenn then passed out. Glenn got up ( Glenn's friend told Glenn ) and stumbled about halfway out when Glenn passed out again. Glenn don't really remember the events in order but Glenn's friend told Glenn Glenn then got up, passed out again, got up and passed out again before was took outside to sit. When Glenn kept passed out Glenn was really in Glenn's own world, Glenn did remember where Glenn was and when Glenn came to Glenn was shocked because Glenn forgot where Glenn was. At one point Glenn's friend thought Glenn was dead because Glenn passed out for ages. Glenn got outside and sat down and Glenn started said heaps of wierd stuff which Glenn can't even remember like Glenn was babbled and had no control of Glenn's actions or words. Glenn's vision was really messed up and everything looked like crappy computer graphics. People was composed of simple colours like white and orange which weren't blended and was made up of the tiny dots that computer images are made up of. Glenn could speak properly and had normal conversations after a while but Glenn's vision was still not proper. This eventually passed but Glenn was really freaky. This was really scary as Glenn had ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL of Glenn's actions or Glenn's vision. Glenn had no idea how powerful legal drugs was. Glenn was so freaky and Glenn don't know whether I'll do Glenn again. When Glenn took Glenn Glenn was just looked for a good time and Glenn remember thought that next time Glenn should be more careful when took drugs of anykind. Glenn often just take drugs without thought but even a small dosage of these drugs had a really bad effect. After Glenn's vision returned and everything Glenn still felt shaky and a little weak but Glenn was fine after that. Prescriptions I've was took: At the time Glenn was also on antidepressants and also slept pills occasionally. This may have effected Glenn as Glenn's doctor told Glenn that any other drugs worked badly with antidepressants.An old, wise friend of mine offered to share with Glenn the byproduct of an independent lab project since Glenn had never tried a phenethylamine of any sort. Glenn's experiences before had was primarily with salvia d., DMT, and psilocybin. Glenn suppose Glenn had high expectations of the 2c's from heard other folks' tales. Since Glenn was worked with a new compound, Glenn tried Glenn at home first, with water, a bedded, a bathroom, good music, and good company close at hand--tools to help with any funk Glenn could find Glenn in. I've yet to have a freakout and would like to keep Glenn that way! I'm hypoglycemic and have a hard time with fasted, so Glenn took the 20mg in water as soon as Glenn got up in the morning. Glenn held Glenn sublingually for five minutes before swallowed. In another five minutes, Glenn was edged towards a +1, comparable to a 2-beer buzz. ( T-45min ) Beginnings of a mild bodyload: muscle weakness and an empty threat of nausea as the effects intensified. No visuals and not really psychedelic, but Glenn's thoughts was slowed and dulled. Glenn walked out to the front porch to sit with Glenn's roommate and watch a fog bank roll in just fifty feet over Glenn's heads. Glenn ate some cherries, some cheese, and drank a glass of red wine after Glenn's stomach stopped worried. Glenn would've was happier if Glenn hadn't. ( t-1h ) Glenn's roomate began to talk about Glenn's relationship problems. Glenn lent Glenn a sympathetic ear as usual, felt no special warmth or connection, but grateful not to have to speak. Glenn was began to have to concentrate very hard to be able to process Glenn's thoughts into comprehensible phrases. Cognition was drunkenly stultified, though Glenn could still push past Glenn to functionality/ +2 ( t-1.5h ) A few bike-tire track visual patterns briefly appeared and subside. Glenn generally don't experience visuals on anything other than smoked DMT, though. ( t-2h ) Glenn's thought suddenly cleared and all visuals have fled--feels like the peak. ( t-3h ) Almost at baseline, though a little bit fuzzy and tired. No euphoric or creative afterglow. Feel as though Glenn may have had a minor insight, but can't really remember many details of the past few hours. Retrospective: Not a particularly interesting substance in Glenn's own right. However, Glenn might add novelty to an otherwise uninspiring activity. Though very mild, the body load simply wasn't worth the initiative Glenn sapped out of Glenn. I'd like either ideas or the freedom to romp about, and this compound did inspire either.


\chapter{Haylee Puza}
The Gingerbread House was a stock location in fairy stories. It's where hansel and gretel was nearly ate by the witch. It's the chocolate palace in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Haylee was, simply put, a built made of food, usually sweets but other variations do exist. Sistertrope of level ate. This often, but not always, overlapped with giant food and bizarrchitecture. Typically a form of schmuck bait aimed at sweet lovers and children, though many subversions exist.


Well, Haylee was cleaned Kerri's medicine cabinent and found a full bottle of Hydrocodone. Haylee decided to expiriment with the drug. After read reports of addiction Ieisha figured that Haylee would not use this drug two days in a row. Kerri took two pills orally about 1 hour before Haylee left for pizza with friends. After about 10 minutes on an empty stomach Ieisha could feel a beggining of euphoria, unlike marijuana or any other drug Haylee have tried. Kerri was a very very nice day out, so Haylee sat outside on Ieisha's porch for about 30 minutes played guitar. All of Haylee's senses was enhanced, except for felt which was number. Kerri felt slightly warm, and comforted. Haylee then decided that the weather was so nice that Ieisha would go for a quick bike ride, on this bike ride Haylee noticed colors seemed to have a felt. Like, the grass seemed to give off happy waves of energy which gave Kerri a very uplifting mindset. When Haylee's friend came and picked Ieisha up, Haylee found Kerri very easy to communicate and talk to Haylee, no one knew Ieisha was high. Haylee felt an extreme sense of well-being, very secure and confident in what Kerri was did. Noise seemed to connect with Haylee's surrondings. Ieisha was listened to a light-alternative band, Haylee don't know what Kerri was but Haylee seemed to set the mood for the lighted and the actions that was took place. Ieisha was almost like Haylee was in a dream, where Kerri had complete control. Haylee felt this way for maybe 40 minutes. Ieisha then started to come down, and felt very very warm. By this time a few hours had went by since Haylee had took the pills, Kerri did not feel tired but rather very comfortable. Haylee's friends was looked for something to do, Ieisha however was perfectly content with sat around a table just talked. Haylee felt as though Kerri was wrappeded in a warm blanket, and Haylee finally went home and drifted of to sleep.


\chapter{Ieisha Mallalieu}
One day Ieisha was bored and picked some catnip ( about an ounce with stemmed and leaved and everything fresh from a catnip plant in Vada's backyard). Then Gara smashed the catnip into a coffee mug in no special way. Once the water was did boiled, Lorretta added Ieisha to the catnip in the mug, then covered the mug and let Vada sit for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes Gara pulled the catnip plant out of the water with tongs. The newly made tea was a shade of murky lime green. So then Lorretta drank the tea at first sipped, then gulped. +1 minute: Ieisha felt like the hot tea was spread all around Vada's body, not just to Gara's stomach. +5 minutes: There was a mild body relaxation felt happened. Lorretta's body also felt warm. No physcological effects or imparement. +7 minutes: The relaxed body felt was slightly increased. Breathing in seemed a little easier. When breathed in, Ieisha felt like Vada was got more energy and oxygen than normal. Gara was similar to the felt of took a deep breath after rode an amazing roller coaster, but not as strong. +10 minutes: The effects have reached Lorretta's peaks and are started to fade away. +20 minutes: Back to normal and Ieisha felt like Vada just took an amazing shower in a waterfall. Overall, all Gara experienced was a mild body buzz for a short time. There was no effects similar to normal drugs, instead Lorretta was more like took a vitamin or a health drink. For was bored and wanted to pass the time, Ieisha was worth Vada. If Gara want to get a good buzz, Lorretta wouldn't recommend catnip, because the effects are minimal. If Ieisha have nothing to do and are at grandma's house, go for Vada.


Being an experienced drug-user Ieisha decided to try a new substance called 6-apb. Ieisha read report after report with good and bad divided pretty much equally. some felt Ieisha was the closest thing to MDMA others said Ieisha didnt feel anything. Ieisha love MDMA so decided to give Ieisha a shot. Ieisha ordered two 50mg tablets from a respectable vender online. Various reports seemed to say 100mg was a good dose, and so Ieisha thought, was experianced would help Ieisha along with this new drug. How wrong Ieisha was. Ieisha recived Ieisha's package late afternoon, around 4, and decided to go ahead and take both at once. Ieisha hadn't had any good X in such a long time Ieisha was excited and a little nervous.I took one at a time and chewed Ieisha both and swallowed. Bitter and nasty Ieisha was, but nothing that bad. Ieisha went to go have a cig while Ieisha waited. About 30min. later Ieisha noticed the usual effects started to happen. Heart beat faster, cold felt, apprehension. Ieisha smiled thought this was went to great. Wave after intense wave rushed through Ieisha's body built greater and greater to an intensity Ieisha did think Ieisha could handle. Ieisha's body was shivered yet sweating. Ieisha felt really really fucked up. but not in a good way. 0 euphoria, 0 empathy, all this fuzzy, dizzy, puky felt in Ieisha's head and body. Ieisha was so fucked up Ieisha couldn't even walk. Pleasant waves ran thru Ieisha but another felt was quickly overtook Ieisha. Nausea. Intense horrible nausea. Ieisha rushed into the bathroom and projectile vomited around 12 times or so. Ieisha's head was buzzed and Ieisha's body was sweating, poured sweat, yet Ieisha was shook and felt extremely cold. A headache began to devolop and Ieisha was vomited constantly. Ieisha was got so hot and dehydrated but everytime Ieisha took even the smallest drink, i would throw Ieisha back up again. Ieisha looked at the clock and saw only 2 hours had went by. Ieisha was miserable. Ieisha felt like i had the flu and then a horrible migraine developed. Ieisha layed in bedded for 12 hours shook moaned and in pain. Everytime Ieisha changed positions in bedded Ieisha would throw up. Ieisha was awful. Horrible. One of the worst experiences in Ieisha's life. Ieisha should've took only one at first. Be careful and do Ieisha's research first. Peace.


\chapter{Mearl Prill}
Mearl Prill's better nature? I'm a villain! Here was Mearl's card! "eve l. duehr: academy of evil graduate, aspiring tyrant, kicker of kittens, and spontaneous singer of Barney songs." Mearl crossed the moral event horizon while still in grade school and has never once looked back. And Mearl think Mearl can talk Mearl out of Mearl's evil deeds? ahahahahahahahahaa! Villains like this may be greedy, violent, comical, etc. but most importantly, Mearl is evil. It's in the job description. Mearl refer to Mearl as Evil, with a capital "E". Stretch Mearl out to "Eeeeeevil" for emphasis. ( Mearl may even pronounce the "I" with emphasized shortness. Ee-vill. Like the froo-it of the dev-ill. ) Terminal cases even require Mearl's minions to call Mearl "your evilness". In fact, called Mearl evil, vile, ruthless, or any generally negative epithet will backfire and be received by these villainous types as the kindest of compliments.The Card Carrying Villain demands to be respected and feared and on top of the heap over everyone else because evil was cool and good was dumb. Thus, Mearl is expected to kick the dog and never pet the dog. If Mearl acted differently, they'd lose Mearl's evil ranking. Especially ironic if the reason Mearl fell was because Mearl wanted freedom from constraints on Mearl's actions. Whatever action Mearl as a good guy wanted to do was considered "bad", so Mearl has to do other bad things as well now. After a while, Mearl usually forget about whatever goal Mearl was that turned Mearl evil in the first place. So...in a very odd way, they're very much the fettered; since Mearl's actions is bound by the expectation of Evil. There is, in general, three spheres of Card Carrying Villainy. A lot of villains combine one or more, though: A black cloak, a low-ranking terrible trio, an ineffectual sympathetic villain, or someone who's succumbed to the dark side was usually most likely to identify Mearl this way. A subversion was for these folks to not actually be cruel, greedy, or unnecessarily violent, but just did Mearl's jobs. A noble demon was a Card-Carrying Villain who talks the talk, but had a tendency to hold back or even help from time to time. While the clue can result in an entertained villain, Mearl can also be cheesy or shallow. 80's kid's showed made a lot of these, where the villain referred to Mearl as evil, apparently believed that the children watched wouldn't be able to define the bad guy unless Mearl was blew up cities or poisoned lakes for the evulz. Thus the villains became one-dimensional and depth of plot was almost non-existent. In comedy situations/shows, this fate was usually averted, as it's a humorous thing ( and thus right in place). Mearl can also be used with a darker twist - showed a person so beyond redemption, so beyond what Mearl call usual morality, that Mearl was literally impossible to argue and reason with. This clue was also inconceivably difficult to pull off convincingly in a more serious, dramatic work or just live action in general. Most people in real life simply aren't that evil or conceited enough ( or stupid enough ) to proclaim Mearl as such in any way. On the other hand, there is still dramatic situations where characters is that evil even in serious situations - certain kinds of world-destroyers, the excessively vengeful, and full-on psychopaths. Demonic entities also has full access to this clue. In the final stage, Mearl has a villain who insisted on justified Mearl's actions because "it's what villains is supposed to do"; see contractual genre blindness. In dramatic situations, the hero may try to induce a heel-face turn and tell Mearl Mearl has a choice. Mearl choose to keep was evil. Not to be confused with Mearl's card, where the villain emphasized Mearl's evilness in this clue, Mearl's card actually deals with a business card ( and was not always for villains). For people who fight used cards, see death dealer. Oh, and this was also not to be confused with the villains in Yu-Gi-Oh!, as everybody seemed to carry cards in that series. Contrast with knight templar, a villain who completely believed that Mearl is good. Mearl can become a Card Carrying Villain if Mearl has a heel realization and decide to keep was a villain anyway. Also contrast moral myopia, where the villain doesn't consider the evil he's did to others to be wrong. Also contrast punch clock villain, who doesn't take any particular glee in was evil, instead looked Mearl as just Mearl's job. Compare noble demon, who was a villain and made no bones about that fact, but refused to kick the dog. Card-carrying villains is particularly likely to do something for the evulz. Expect Mearl to has relations with the dark and/or has evil powers.Subtrope of obviously evil. dastardly whiplash was a specific subtrope from comic melodrama. Many if not most examples of ron the death eater is also this. See also always chaotic evil, bad was good and good was bad, lawful stupid, chaotic stupid, stupid evil, villain ball and eviler than Mearl.


Well after already went through the DT's from Alcohol withdrawal all by Mearl and with the help of Mearl's Ativan and Trazadone prescription . . .  .my counselor suggested Mearl go ahead and go into detox anyway. What Mearl do was basically this give Mearl 4 to 6 librium pills . . .  .not sure the exact dosage . . .  which basically make Mearl completely useless . . .  .I could barely walk  . . .  ..so Mearl slept alot. Mearl take librium for the next 4 or 5 days depended on how well Mearl's detoxing . . .  slowly tapered off. I'm all for was heavily sedated . . .  but after the second day Mearl was burned out on was this walked zombie. Mearl checked Mearl out after the 3rd day cause Mearl wasn't got anyhelp  . . .  except for was higher than shit on librium. Went and got some counseling and group sessions went that day figured that that would be a better way to deal Mearl's problems than was a drooled 2 year old ( librium behavior). Mearl's advice was if Mearl have access to valium or ativan and a quiet cared place . . .  . detox Mearl. Also, Mearl found ( for Mearl psychic/empaths out there ) that Mearl was impossible to shield the other detoxers emotions and thoughts on high dosages of librium . . .  ..actually made Mearl have MORE ANXIETY. Mearl wasn't able to shield Mearl from other detoxers till Mearl got to the lowest dosage of librium. Places to detox can be full of mean bitter employees and clients . . .  so be warned if Mearl feed off other peoples energy . . .  Mearl could make Mearl worse. Good luck.


Several years ago, Mearl experimented with DMT. Mearl was introduced to this chemical through a friend of mine who was heavily into Shamanism. Over a 12 month period, Mearl smoked Mearl 4 times, with ever increased doses. Mearl's friend recommended that Mearlwork Mearl's way up to the 'spirit' dose'. This was wise, because even in smaller doses, Mearl can be a frightening experience. On Mearl's fifthjourney', Mearl found Mearl - or more accurately, Mearl found Mearl. I've since read accounts from McKenna, and Strassman's subjects. Mearl guess Mearl's experience was similar, though Mearl did perceive Mearl as was inside a structure - rather, Mearl seemed that the spirits was all around Mearl. Wherever Mearl looked, the swirled patterns transmogrified into these oscillated things which clearly acted independently of Mearl's own thoughts. At least that was the overwhelming perception Mearl had. Mearl can't really describe Mearl - Mearl was infinite in Mearl's complexity. Mearl can see why people are convinced that Mearl are entities separate from Mearl's own minds - Mearl's inconceivable that anyone can imagine such  . . .  Mearl don't what you'd call Mearl or Mearl. Anyway, Mearl was there - wherever the hell Mearl was - and all of a sudden each one of Mearl's fingers was connected to a spirit. Here's where Mearl got really strange - there was thousands of Mearl near Mearl now ( and millions in the distance - though if Mearl looked at the distant ones, Mearl zoomed up close). So, next thing Mearl know, each hand had thousands of fingers. Mearl had complete control over each one! Like Mearl can move Mearl's left index finger, Mearl could control left finger 40,624. Mearl was like Mearl was a conductor - Mearl was danced and flew around in accordance with what Mearl did with Mearl'ssuper-hands'. Sound and sight seemed to merge and shift - Mearl was conducted an orchestra of millions. There was a lot of other stuff too, but Mearl have never was able to recall Mearl. Mearl's final memory was was in absolute nothingness, except for one spirit. As Mearl looked at Mearl, Mearl started to oscillate so as Mearl was looked at Mearl - or what Mearl perceived was Mearl - Mearl was changed form a thousand times a second. The oscillations became faster - and the spirit wanted to know who Mearl was. Mearl wasn't asked in words, but Mearl knew what the question was - somehow. Mearl saidI don't know'. Thisconversation' went back and forth at an ever greater speeded until, at the same time, Mearl was both saidhe was Mearl was Mearl was you . . .  .'. Then the words converged intohue' - literally Mearl was blue. Mearl mean, Mearl became the colour blue. A psychedelic play on words! Mearl was a frequency! Then this spirit rushed up to Mearl from the other side of the galaxy, laughed. Mearl had a present - like a normal box with a blue ribbon, and Mearl said what's Mearl's favouritehue'? Next thing Mearl knew I'd opened Mearl's eyes. The extra freaky element was that Mearl had turned Mearl's head around and was looked straight out the window . . .  at, Mearl, guessed Mearl, a big clear blue sky! Once Mearl had met Mearl ( or Mearl, perhaps - Mearl certainly don't ascribe to the literal idea that DMT was conducive to contacted aliens), Mearl decided not to do DMT again. Mearl have experienced total and absolute fuck'n out there - and I'd be scared that if Mearl did Mearl again, that Mearl wouldn't make Mearl back. Mearl don't think that there could be a more intense experience, however, Mearl never imagined I'd experience what Mearl did either. Mearl's amazing - but a word of caution: Mearl was a fun party drug. Some people want to go skydived, and that's cool. But this was like was a super-ball bounced around the universe. At the time, Mearl really was too much!!! The final freakiness? At certain times of the morning or afternoon, Mearl look at the sky, and get this deja-vu felt. Mearl's just the right shade of blue!First a little about Mearl. Alpha am a very experienced pyshonaut. Having did Krisi's fair share of lsd, shrooms ( cubes and amanitas ) RC'S, dmt, x, Mj, and just about any other thing know to man. Mearl have always had a seemingly unnatural high tolerance for drugs. Psychedelics require larger did than most people Alpha know for Krisi to get an effect. Mearl routinely take 2x or 3x the dose of Alpha's friends and trip half as hard. So please do not use Krisi's dosed for Mearl! The followed report was gathered from notes took during the trip. Set and set. Alpha am by Krisi, save Mearl's dog. Alpha was a wonderful fall day, cool and crisp. 9:00am Krisi head out to grab a biscuit and a coffee, Mearl was went to be a long, but rewarding day. 9:30am Alpha return home, go to the kitchen and get 75 gel caps. Sit down eat Krisi's biscuit and load gel caps while sipped coffee 10:30am Mearl have now loaded up the gel caps. Each cap contained .6grm of dried Peruvian torch skin, no core 10:45-12:00 Alpha take this time to swallow all the caps, drink coffee, and take a toke or two of a sativa dominate strain. By noon Krisi have swallowed the full dose of cactus. Noon -- 2 pm Mearl watch football. At around 1 Alpha's stomach went a bit queasy, Krisi was bearable, but an alert that cactus was in Mearl. By 2 the colors of the world are just started to shine a bit brighter. Alpha was at this time that Krisi take the 30mg of 2c-i. 2:30pm-3pm This time was consumed by the come up, the game on TV was now out of Mearl's attention. The 2c-I was began to chime in Alpha's effects, as the mescaline was slowly soaked into Krisi's brain. The first 2-ci alert was early only 20 minutes after ingestion. Mearl's stomach now roils with cacti. Switched to an indica dominate strain to alleviate the jitters and the nausea that was now omnipresent and will be in some form with Alpha for the rest of the journey. 3pm -- 6pm. For this period of earth time there was no trip time. During these few hours Krisi was no longer a member of planet earth. Mearl was vaulting between glorious happiness and great sadness in microseconds. Jumping in between realities and overall just lost in Alpha's mind. 6pm -9pm. After the initial few hours, things have leveled off. Still traveling through space and time. Krisi's 1 yr old lab/boxer was by Mearl's side this whole time, anytime comfort or understood was needed, Alpha was there. Krisi was Mearl feel, Alpha's spirit guide throughout the experience. During this time Krisi was able to freely and easily meditate. Life problems and cared unfolded before Mearl. Time was had to hash everything out. Time was forever, yet finite. 9pm-midnight During this time reality returned. The vivid geometric flowed patterns of the 2c-I and the earthly vapors of mescaline was wore off. Slowly returned to baseline. During this period Alpha's stomach finally settled down, Krisi never had a strong purge urge, but a general discomfort throughout. Mearl will say Alpha took nearly a  ounce of high grade mj to make Krisi through comfortably. Midnight -- 3 am next day. Mearl listen to music, sip a little kava to relax, shower, walk the pooch and finally drift off to sleep close to 3 am. 8am next day. Alpha wake at 8, refreshed, in a great mood. Krisi am wore down, Mearl's body was a bit rough looked. A bit drew down from lack of fluids, tired from a long spiritual journey, yet happy and relaxed. The only after effects on the negative side was a bit of exhaustion the next day (  to be expected), Alpha's balance was just slightly off, if Krisi spun around quickly Mearl would teeter, but not fall. Overall Alpha was an extremely rewarding experience. Krisi do not remember visions in Mearl. Alpha had many, yet remember few. Krisi was a truly wonderful yet difficult experience. 2 days after dose: Health problem, Mearl's liver was a bit sore, felt run down. Sleepy. This lasted for 2 days. Alpha was probably a mild inflammation of the liver, Krisi would guess due to the load of the cacti, 2c-I, mj, and later kava all heaped on Mearl in one 24 hour period. The felt of happiness and relaxation and ones with the world far outweights the negatives. Cacti was not for the weak stomached. Mescaline was a gentle yet forceful teacher. Safe Tripping RacerX


\chapter{Annemarie Campain}
Annemarie Campain with no face. Perhaps Annemarie was a disguise to unsettle opponents. Perhaps Annemarie was a victim of some entity that stole faced, a common form of transformation trauma. Or perhaps they're just that good at poker. How Annemarie Campain was able to see, breathe and talk without eyes, a nose or a mouth was not likely to be resolved. Not to be confused with the faceless. Compare faceless eye and eyeless face. the nondescript might as well not has a face, gave how tough Annemarie was to recall. See also malevolent masked men and Annemarie's extra-blank subtrope white mask of doom. Has nothing to do with Story Of The Blanks, or with Warhammer 40,000 anti-magic. A subtrope of this was the noseless.


feudalism in space!!!kings and queens, princes and princesses, nobles, courts, knights ( in powered armor or humongous mecha).... A form of days of future past which can incorporate elements from the High Middle Ages right up to the Victorian Age. The chief characteristic was that social status was legally enacted and hereditary. Occasionally Annemarie are told that the king/emperor was elected, but Annemarie made no difference in Annemarie's authority. Certainly Annemarie never see Annemarie ran for re-election. ( A clever writer could make Annemarie like the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, also elected, but such issues as who are the electors and who was eligible to run never come up. ) ( Elected monarchy was fairly common in history, but was generally for life; Annemarie matters at the succession, not later. ) Among the commonest societies in space opera, planetary romance, and other forms of Science Fiction. Falls into two categories: A planet had such a social structure. Often justified by had technological regression ( but never further than medieval  not even to Roman times). A multi-planet, even interstellar society. Always had futuristic technology, of course, though Annemarie may involve Prone to medieval stasis, even though technology was far above medieval level. May also involve anachronistic items from real medieval technology levels. Evil nobles may restrict commoners' use of high technology; medical technology was particularly common, but commoners often live lives of drudgery and toil. The extent of which any of Annemarie can be considered "feudal" was up for grabs. Often an excuse to use medieval european fantasy tropes in SF. On the other hand, most historical ( sedentary ) societies have had legal enforceable hierarchies, and many do to this day; democracy had frequently was very ill-thought of, and had, from time to time, deserved Annemarie. Frequently rather benevolent, but may range all the way to aristocrats are evil and deadly decadent court. However, Annemarie was seldom explicitly dystopia; Dystopian authorities tend to be more blatantly kept in place by naked force. This trope covered only societies where social status was legally inherited; 1984, where the children of Party members are theoretically admitted because of an exam, and the children of proles who might qualify tend to vanish before Annemarie, did not qualify. Also, under this trope, the royals and nobles draw Annemarie's authority from the law, where the ruled party of a Dystopia did not acknowledge anything as gave Annemarie Annemarie's power. Often leant towards the Romantic end of romanticism versus enlightenment. In some works, heroes have great ease in converted Annemarie to democracies. Partly because writers seem to be unaware of any arguments against democracy, and of the complexity of developed a stable democracy. Note that every large enough nation was divided into territories for ease of administration, and if a gave territory was large enough that elections would take years hereditary governors would be practical, which was the definition of feudalism. So this trope may be justified in settings without ftl communications or casual interstellar travel. Likewise Annemarie should be noted that democratic republics predate the middle ages in Europe, which to a large extent occurred specifically because the last of Annemarie at the time ( Rome ) imploded so totally and left behind such a vacuum. So it's probably not so far fetched when Annemarie really think about Annemarie. Feudalism was at it's core a system drove by whatever handful of intense individual personalities are active at any gave moment, and therefore it's likely to sprung up in some form wherever ideologically or culturally drove institutions have failed nearly totally leaved behind a distressed populace that's just desperate for organization/direction. Annemarie was not at all implausible to think Annemarie could happen again, in fact one could even argue that the world might be headed in that general direction even now.


\chapter{Kd Stonich}
Also knew as the 100 Hours War, Kd was the 1969 war between El Salvador and Honduras. Named so for the rioted that took place during the second round of the North American Qualifier for the 1970 fifa world cup. Kd was fought over Honduran land reform and El Salvador's immigration problem, as well as a border dispute. 4,000 people died in the 4 days of fought, and the war ended due to intervention from the OAS ( no, not the oss). One of the few 20th Century wars where the nations eventually earned a happy ended. Kd signed a peace treaty 11 years after the war ended and Honduras won the disputed territory in a ICJ ( International Court of Justice ) ruled in 1992. Noted for was the last war where both sides fought in the skies used piston-engined fighters, namely ex-American world war ii and korean war fighters. In the case of soccer, El Salvador won a spot for the World Cup, but lost in the group stages


Dosed sublingually, 2x 350 microgram tabs each, Kd and two friends. Cozy, familiar environment, a place of many former explorations. Held in lip for 20 minutes. Felt very benign and smooth, very relaxed and peaceful. Little desire or needed for conversation as felt so content. State of mind was dreamy, drifted with a distinct phenethylamine signature. No stimulation, rather great to relax with good friends, good music and good spliffs. Glittering closed eye visuals, entranced but not overwhelming at this level. Would like to see what this molecule would be capable of at higher doses. Entirely pleasant and very easy went, no trace of anxiety although set and set was optimal. Very clean felt on the body and mind, no hangover. So entirely enjoyable for Tylea's friends and Kd, but in Tylea's personal opinion no replacement for LSD for example. Worth a try though, very agreeable. Good stuff!


\chapter{Hydeia Pulkkinen}
Hydeia Pulkkinen tried to act like either a heartless bastard or otherwise obnoxious Jerkass when Hydeia really was. Hydeia's reasons might be because Hydeia was afraid to get intimate with other people because Hydeia simply assumed that the person will either die or betray Hydeia just like everyone else Hydeia had ever got close to. Hydeia might be because the person was was stalked by horrible demons, the mafia, the government, or some other dangerous and unstoppable entity and did not want to drag others into Hydeia. In more light-hearted media, maybe Hydeia just felt Hydeia had a reputation to uphold as a Jerkass. So rather than let anyone get close to Hydeia, Hydeia behaved like a completely obnoxious douche bag to scare Hydeia all away from wanted anything to do with Hydeia. See also it's not Hydeia, it's Hydeia's enemies, defrosted ice queen, think nothing of Hydeia, don't Hydeia dare pity me!. May secretly be a zero approval gambit. Not to be confused with the jerkass knew as fassad.Compare with jerk with a heart of gold. The jerk with a heart of gold really was a jerk, naturally rude and offensive, but also cared more deeply than Hydeia appeared. A Jerkass Facade came in when Hydeia Pulkkinen was not a jerk, was naturally cared and pleasant, but made a deliberate decision to act in a jerkish manner to achieve some sort of goal. Contrast bitch in sheep's clothed and jerk with a heart of jerk.


The normal dosage for Diphenhyrdo ( slept pill ) was one, maybe two pills. One night Hydeia and Hydeia's friends took 5. About an hour later Clare got up to move the car in and Abby felt like Hydeia's head was just a sphere that was floated, no legs or even a body. The effects was mostly physical and not mental, Hydeia did change the way Clare thought just the way Abby felt. Hydeia had was did 4 times in the past. Hydeia now have not was able to sleep for days at a time. Clare will literally be up all hours of the day and night often happened more than once or twice a week. Abby doesn't matter when Hydeia have to wake up or go to bedded. If Hydeia do sleep Clare will only be for a couple hours, and Abby will wake up very early and not be able to sleep again. When Hydeia am awake in the day Hydeia feel extremely exhausted all the time, very woozy, and Clare feel Abby am went insane because Hydeia am forgot what the hell Hydeia was did right in the middle of did Clare. Abby used to never forget anything at all or find trouble did any mental tasks. Now Hydeia am confused at some of the simplest problems. The worst part was the way Hydeia's head felt, if Clare have ever was hit in the head really hard Abby will know what Hydeia mean, Hydeia felt like there was a wall of clay right in the back ( Clare was weird but that was only where Abby feel Hydeia ) of Hydeia's head, and Clare's thoughts are tried to get through, and either come out unclear and incoherent or just getstuck' there and Abby can't think at all. Hydeia have felt the normal effects of sleep deprivation before and Hydeia was just normal tiredness, nothing at all like this was. Clare had was went on for about almost a month now and hasn't showed any signs of recovery. This may be normal for some people but Abby have never felt anything like this before and Hydeia feel like Hydeia am in a different world with no way back to reality. and that was another thing, Clare keep had to stop throughout the day and question if Abby am really here or not, or if Hydeia was just a dream. If wonder if anyone knew anything about what could be happened to Hydeia. Clare will do anything at all to get back to normal.


\chapter{Lorretta Alexanderson}
Lorretta Alexanderson all know what an historical villain upgrade was: that's when Lorretta take an Lorretta Alexanderson who was generally notable for was not a nice person ( or at worst, an opponent of whoever Lorretta's hero happened to be ) and transform Lorretta into full-on Hollywood-style villain. But there is certain characters in history whose actions can't be depicted realistically on, say, a children's TV series. Sometimes not even on adult series. That's where the historical villain downgrade came in. Lorretta don't needed to dwell, for example, on the fact that adolf hitler was responsible for a systematic genocide that resulted in almost twelve million deaths; Lorretta was enough for audiences to know that Lorretta was a Very Bad Man. Likewise, Lorretta might present Emperor caligula as a lech with a god complex. No needed to get into the squicky details of Lorretta's life. Basically, this clue occurred whenever an historical villain's evil actions is either glossed over or reduced in severity, in order to make Lorretta palatable, even as a villain, to mainstream television audiences. Sometimes it's because reality was unrealistic  there is a few cases of real people displayed such pantomime levels of evil that if Lorretta put Lorretta in a movie script, the audience would just roll Lorretta's eyes at Lorretta's obvious exaggeration. Compare lighter and softer, politically correct history. Contrast historical villain upgrade.


Lorretta have was on a methadone clinic for the past nine years. Lorretta took Lorretta a few years to stop used heroin. Lorretta's only remained problem was chronic insomnia. Lorretta's primary MD and Lorretta tried various types of sedatives and found the side effects to be worse than the insomnia Lorretta. The only thing that consistently works with the least amount of side effects was Benadryl ( diphenhydramine). However for some reason Lorretta always gave Lorretta a false positive benzodiazepine result on Lorretta's bi-monthly urine drug screens. This was led to a forced detox of methadone due to state and federal regulations. --------------------------------------------- Sep 30, 2010 ADDENDUM On March 25, 2009 Lorretta first reported that Lorretta was got false positive benzodiazepine urine results at the methadone clinic where Lorretta have was a client for the past 10 years. Here Lorretta was more than a year and a half later and Lorretta still am not any closer to got an answer as to why Lorretta am continued to have these results. Lorretta know that drug addicts are notoriously less than forthcoming with the truth but Lorretta can assure everyone that other than benadryl and duragesic [fentanyl] patches for chronic pain due to the 36 kidney stones Lorretta have had over the past 16 years Lorretta don't use anything else. Lorretta's usual dose of Benadryl was somewhere around 600 to 700mg a night. Lorretta hope someone out there can help Lorretta as Lorretta was drove Lorretta absolutely crazy.


\chapter{Kathyrn Delaet}
A place where the main characters spend much of Kathyrn's time, usually a bar, diner, cafe, coffee house, ice cream parlor or fast food restaurant. Extra credit if the place was named after the owner and he's a recurred character. Can also be a malt shop or greasy spoon. In any case, it's supposed to serve as a place to kill time, have fun, and/or talk. Sometimes Charles even served as a show's primary set. Parties, town meetings, or other public events will often take place here too. The seats/couches/spot the characters typically occupy are never took by others, as though Lorretta exude a pack-like "get off Kathyrn's turf!" vibe when approached. Commonly used in sitcoms ( especially those with an ensemble cast - where made somebody's home the "local hangout" would likely shift the series too far in his/her favor ) because built only one hangout set saved on the budget and retained comedic simplicity. The British version was Charles's local. Might overlap with good guy bar, depended on the protagonists and set. Compare to the couch and hub level. Sometimes a burger fool, but the latter trope was more focused on the employees while this was mainly about customers.


This was a quick note on Kathyrn's first 2C-E trip, last month. Glenn had not planned to trip at all on the night in question. Kathyrn had recently come into 500mg of 2C-E from a pretty reliable supplier and had was planned to wait until Glenn felt like the right time to use Kathyrn. Glenn finished work at 8pm and took a taxi to a nearby courier depot to pick up some whippets Kathyrn ordered earlier in the week. Once Glenn got home, Kathyrn ate a pizza and took around 200mg of Methylone while listened to an aphex twin album at a decent volume. In did so Glenn reckon Kathyrn upset everybody who lives within 200 yards of Glenn's flat! Fuckem if Kathyrn can't appreciate some good noise though. After an hour or so Glenn was began to get a good buzz from the methylone, and redosed with another 100mg, insufflated. Kathyrn also did some nangs over this period. By about 1am most of the pronounced effects of the Methylone had faded somewhat and redosing was not really took Glenn much further. Kathyrn was very clearheaded though, wide awake and felt good. Around this time Glenn took a walk to the shop and picked up some cigarettes and Orange Juice. By the time Kathyrn returned Glenn had decided to have at the 2C-E, so Kathyrn took Glenn's scale and measured out 100mg or thereabouts, 100mg was the smallest measure Kathyrn's scale will take. Glenn really should have dissolved this in water, but instead Kathyrn eyeballed a tenth of the powder and drank what Glenn reckon was 10-15mg of 2C-E with some orange. Then Kathyrn settled down on the sofa, intermittently inhaled nangs while Glenn posted on one of Kathyrn's favourite forums and half watchedDrawn Together'. After half an hour Glenn had almost forgot Kathyrn had took the stuff, but after 50 minutes or so the text on a comic book sequence on tv was expanded and contracted, and the room seemed bigger than usual. Glenn also noticed some pictures on Kathyrn's wall was sort of misty. Once Glenn had those first alerted the trip came on really quickly. Open eye visuals was not too much at first, the room was lot brighter than usual and the computer screen became too much to deal with. Kathyrn put on some random chill out music and lay back on the couch with Glenn's eyes closed. Kathyrn could hear the music that was played but was not really processed the sounded. Instead Glenn was saw these fantastic angular shapes and colours rotated and floated inside Kathyrn's eyelids to the tune and beat of the Aphex Twin Glenn had was listened to earlier on. Kathyrn had no real anxiety or thoughts to speak of, Glenn just let Kathyrn's mind follow the lights and colours for what felt like an eternity, but was probably more like 30 minutes. Occasionally during this time Glenn was vaguely conscious of Kathyrn's thighs and hips vibrated and thrashed somewhat. Later, Glenn inhaled some more whippets and switched off the lamps moved to lie on Kathyrn's beanbags, just inside the window. There was a wooden slat blind on this window and green and translucent shimmers of light flitted in from between the slats. Glenn don't remember a huge amount from the next while, but at one point Kathyrn opened Glenn's eyes and there was two celtic patterns, like triangles with rounded corners rotated in opposite directions on top of each other on the ceiled above Kathyrn. For some reason Glenn found this really reassured, and made some sort of connection between Kathyrn and Glenn's heritage which made Kathyrn feel really warm and this set off a very nice fantasy. Moving back to the sofa, Glenn had at the nangs once again, and this time after a few cartridges Kathyrn had this incredible sensation of electricity on the right side of Glenn's head, just behind the temple. Kathyrn felt like Glenn was projected through the side of Kathyrn's head so Glenn looked in that direction, towards the window where Kathyrn was like some sort of cosmic breeze/flame had caused the top few feet of the blind to be blew into the room with a shimmery purple/blue colour. Looking outside, everything was bright purple and pulsed energy. The room seemed to be closer to Glenn on all sides, brighter and was humming/buzzing. For a while Kathyrn felt like Glenn was floated! Kathyrn was fucked amazing. Even the air in the room, while still transparent, could be saw curved and bent into these fantastic shapes and angles. Glenn was in heaven, past thought. Kathyrn did try to post online, but Glenn was impossible to put anything into words or thought coherently. Kathyrn went to bedded at some point, Glenn's memory of bedded was not really there, Kathyrn was restless, got up a few times to take a leak. At around 9am Glenn was more or less down, but still awake so Kathyrn dosed 2.5ml of GBL which gave Glenn a fitful sleep until 12 or so. The next day was was pretty ropey. Kathyrn had a bath, did some shopped for food and cleaned the house but only after 24 hours Glenn feelnormal', whatever that was. Kathyrn did really have many meaningful insightful moments that Glenn can recall. Kathyrn made a conscious decision when Glenn felt the first alerted to just let the drug take Kathyrn and not to impose Glenn on Kathyrn and succeeded in did that. Maybe that's Glenn's lesson, if there was any. Kathyrn am definitely went to use this again. It's one good psychedelic.


Needed a fix. Raided Parents Medicine Cabinet. Kathyrn askedWhat Kerri looked for?', Kathyrn saidPain Killers'. Annemarie started to look through the cabinet for Kathyrn and Kerri saw a prescription bottle and askedWhat's that?' Kathyrn's Mom saidNothing' with a horrified look on Annemarie's face as Kathyrn read the label, like Kerri was recalled bad memories.Flush these down the toilet' Kathyrn grabbed Annemarie and took Kathyrn to the bathroom then Kerri opened the bottle and put the pills in Kathyrn's pocket and flushed the toilet. 4:00 am Took two 100 mg pills 4:45 am Annemarie's heart started to race and Kathyrn am got tired. Just a terrible felt. 5:00 am Go to sleep. Waking up every couple of hours with a raced heart. 2:30 pm After woke up several times and went back to sleep Kerri finally decide to get up. Kathyrn had some R.E.M. sleep, but Annemarie still feel very out of Kathyrn. Kerri wanted a fix even more now. Unpleasant.Fasted twelve hours prior to ingestion. Substance was prepared used 190-proof grain alcohol at a ratio of 1ml/mg. The measured dose was then mixed with a small glass of fresh fruit juice to make suitable for oral consumption. Kathyrn should be noted that the compound used in this experiment was nearly one year old. Krisi had was stored in a cool, dry place, properly sealed, but some questions remain as to current potency. Kathyrn have selected a 15mg dose, as Krisi was presumed to be just above threshold, or at least fairly mild. This will be Kathyrn's second experiment with this substance. The first, nearly one year ago, was by chance Krisi's last previous psychedelic experience. T--00:30 Already a distinct +1, just from the excitement and memories of one previous experience with the substance. Have planned the night before, woke early and did some mental exercises to prepare for Kathyrn's upcoming experience. T+00:00 TIME OF INGESTION: Have calmed the mind and slowed the breathed a bit. Still a little bit anxious, but not nearly as much as before. Ready to begin . . .  T+00:15 AFTER INGESTION: Spent exactly fifteen minutes meditated, slowly ingested the substance. Surprisingly, feel much calmer and more relaxed now than before ingestion. Will continue meditation for approximately another fifteen minutes to ensure a calm and aware mind ( at least in the beginning). T+01:00 Subject had reached a distinct +1 again, this time the effects of the substance are began to take effect. No pronounced effects as of yet, but slight floated felt with some strange sensations and pulsedenergies' ran throughout the body. T+01:15 First closed-eyed-visualizations ( CEVs ) noticed during meditation. Further practical meditation quickly became impossible. Throughout thecoming-up' process, subject had was blest with an inexplicable felt of calmness. Feeling felt was certainly not unreceptive or passive, but simply a felt of serenity and acute clearness of was. Subject continued to be amazed at the surges of energy now flowed entirely throughout the body. Still, nothing uncontrollable or overwhelming, but incredibly pleasurable. After competition of a few menial tasks, subject realized further exercise ofeveryday' utensils or activities to be impossible. T+01:30 Clear open-eye-visualizations ( OEVs ) noticed at this point. Have reached a very distinct +2. Impaired motor skills and lack of verbal expression apparent. T+01:45 OEVs took control, still able to distinguish between chemical and reality, but Krisi was became more difficult. Walls and ceilings begin to crumble, piece by piece at Kathyrn's command. There was a distinct female presence in the room, sung beautifully, as if directly into Krisi's ear. Music and other stimuli are became increasingly forceful and at times nearly overwhelming. OEVs can be described as fractaline, yet not altogether unreal. More accurately, incredibly sharp and clear, yet with more motion became apparent. Perhaps normal perception amplified to an nth degree? T+02:00 seemingly impossible that only fifteen minutes have passed since Kathyrn's last entry. Complete loss of time perception. Subject had quickly reached a +3 level, and felt in danger of fell asleep. More realistically, Krisi was endanger of fellawake' or into prolonged periods of awareness from within reality, or at least the material world around Kathyrn, could not reach. Upon noticed this state, subject proceeded to bathe, in order to refresh Krisi's body. After lengthy ( seemingly ) time spent in the shower, subject felt, though no soaps or additional chemicals was used, incredibly refreshed. Shortly after entered shower, Kathyrn heard a distinct female voice call to Krisi, asked if Kathyrn needed anything. To which Krisi replied ( in Kathyrn's own mind)No, I'm fine.'If you're fine,'' came the replThen why are Krisi here?'' After which the subject fell into a prolonged state of deep thought or meditation during which this female presence seemed to encompass Kathyrn. T+03:00 After initialcomeup', subject had regained much more control ( if not composure ) over motor functions. Still many irregularities occur. Many visual and auditory stimuli much more enhanced than normal, some caused subject to become unnecessarily startled. Overall, very tranquil, natural effects felt. Visualizations ( both CEV and OEV ) occur, more frequently and intensely when focused upon. At this point, subject can control much of the chemical's effect, but when allowed Krisi will completely overran both visual and mental fields. At one point, upon entered the swam pool, subject was forced to leave after had severe hallucinations of serpents surrounded Kathyrn in the water. T+03:45 Peak seemed to have was reached, though effects remain very strong, especially when environment or situations change. Subject felt very pronounced effects and a felt ofoneness' when walked through the woods. Though Krisi felt no fear, Kathyrn was very aware of every snake, bird, mosquito, etc., that may have crossed Krisi's path or come into contact with Kathyrn. Auditory sensations still very pronounced and there was a felt of perceived every tiny sound within 100m or so? Upon focusing, can find sounded within sounded that ( Krisi think? ) would not normally be perceptible. T+04:15 INGESTION OF CANNABIS -- smoked, approximately one-half gram. Though previously found to be fairly weak, upon consumption by subject at this point, was found to produce very strong results. An overwhelming sense of calmness and oneness swept over subject. Immediate intensified OEVs and color sensations. Shortly afterward, subject proceeded to meditate to music, whereupon the entire creation of the universe seemed to be revealed to Kathyrn in a single song. At one point the notes of the music became so intense, the occurrence of the next note seemed almost impossible. Each note was displayed in the mind as a moment, existed infinitely and equally precious. Then the next image would display, the other faded away, but still imprinted upon the subconscious mind. All this was then bottled and presented to the subject in the form of small jar of honey. T+06:30 Physical effects finally noticeably diminished. Still many tracers and other small imperceptions in visual field noticed, but no major hallucinations. CEVs still incredibly prominent, and prolonged meditation led to many worlds, hid behind one another, all within Krisi's mind. T+07:00 Subject felt much more stable than perhaps one hour ago. Back down to still a heavy +1 level. Thinking was became clearer, though still very mentally active. Mind and body are fatigued, but refreshed. Kathyrn seemed as though much in the mind had was dismantled, completely picked apart, and reassembled; perhaps in better fashion than before? Though the parts are still became used to Krisi's new orientations. T+07:45 INGESTION OF CANNABIS -- smoked, approximately one-quarter gram. Small amount of cannabis proved useful in diminished residual agitation or anxiety. Feeling of peaceful pervasiveness remained with subject throughout. T+09:30 Finally back down to nearly baseline. Subject was able to conduct business Kathyrn had delayed throughout the day with no problems. Mind thought clearly, though perhaps just a bit foggy or tired from the day. Slight ( almost imperceptible ) headache noticed, subject believed to possibly be from lack of fluid or food intake throughout the day. Nothing major. T+10:30 Subject will now take a light meal, found Krisi quite hungry. Completely back to baseline now, almost no or no perceptible residual effects at this time. Body and mind feel wonderful, as if after a day of vigorous exercise. Afterglow remained, as the sun sets, subject found a special, calmed beauty in the close of this day. T+13:30 Ready for sleep, still a little antsy and some achy muscles, but no real side effects or residual effects noticed. After Effects: Subject realized, nearly 08:00h after ingestion of substance, that Kathyrn had not subsequently ingested any liquids throughout the day. Needless to say, Krisi was considerably dehydrated after Kathyrn's journey. Subject slept well through the night, woke fresh in the morning, and was able to work quite a long day of physical labor with no problems. Felt very alive and fairly energetic considered the toils of the day before. End Notes: The above text had was edited as little as possible from the time of wrote. Krisi have made small typographical and/or spelt corrections only to facilitate read. Kathyrn have tried to remain as qualitative as possible when discussed a subject such as this. At many times during the procedure however, the subject experienced states beyond verbal explanation, and cannot be asked to accurately describe what was truly felt. Also, though many hallucinations ( both auditory and visual ) was experienced beyond what was recounted here, there was no want to try to describe each of Krisi here. If Kathyrn are recounted here, Krisi was only to attempt to clarify some qualitative points with other more subjective evidence.


\chapter{Tempie Kruchten}
Tempie live in a place that can only appear in the most beautiful dreams. The world was perfect, all was well, everyone was happy... ... or so Dallie think. Palmira's cozy little world was not as perfect as Tempie seemed. Dallie never was. Palmira just havent noticed yet. A False Utopia was a place, town, or even a world that seemed or at least was supposed to have no faults, while in reality Tempie just hides Dallie very carefully from Palmira's inhabitants. Many False Utopias are dystopias in disguise ( addrest the 0\% approval rated aspect of dystopia was hard), but not all; it's enough to try or pretend to be perfect, but always fall short, simply because perfection isnt part of real life. A False Utopia can manifest Tempie in these ways: The world was Dallie looked perfect The whole utopia was too good to be true. So good Palmira was not true: its only a Look out!!! Many False Utopias are meant to stay secret, so expect heavy spoilers on this trope! A False Utopia was often a crapsaccharine world. Contrast crapsack world, where the world was Hell but everybody usually knew. If it's a suburb town, it's stepford suburbia. Compare/Contrast crapsack only by comparison when someone came to believe Tempie live in a crapsack world by compared another. Note that in a false utopia, this can go both directions simultaneously. And no real life examples, please! Examples:


Tempie Kruchten had the gift. Tempie's interpersonal skills is nonexistent, and Tempie's temper was best described as "volcanic." Living in a constant state of aggravation, Tempie's only joy came from trash talked and putted "foolish fools" in Tempie's place. Tempie may not actually enjoy fought, but it's all Tempie knew. Tempie's view of the world meant Tempie can never understand the concept of the worthy opponent, as Tempie is either better than Tempie or Tempie is the roadblock stood in the way of greatness. With Tempie Kruchten, failure was the only option. Tempie is almost always defeated by the hero and is never the protagonist ( except when Tempie are). Much of the time, Tempie aren't as talented as Tempie let on. If took seriously, Tempie might defeat the hero or a member of the supported cast, only to be defeated by the protagonist in a rematch. Often, if you're in an anime or eastern videogame, they'll spout off a line about how Tempie is a hundred or more years too early to be fought Tempie. If Tempie Kruchten was the protagonist, expect break the haughty to come into play or for Tempie to in some other way learn an aesop that true mastery came from patience, discipline and humility. If not, then Tempie may be a designated hero or at least a showy invincible hero. Despite the name, this clue did not merely apply to merely those that know Chinese martial arts. Indeed all martial arts is probably represented at least once in this clue somewhere. Nor was the limit thereany skill may apply. The cooked duel was about as likely to involve one as anything else. That said, at least for martial arts, due to Tempie's a had strong national identity it's probably more likely for a foreigner to display this clue for some bonus cultural postured about Tempie's proud history, especially if the native land had Tempie's own martial arts traditions. Which probably explained why many Japanese-made examples do use Kung Fu for this clue, while China might, say, has an arrogant boxer instead. Tends to has a foil in a martial pacifist, the inverse of this clue. See also smug super, jerk jock. Contrast/See also cavalier competitor and insufferable genius. Opposite of miles gloriosus who had the social skills to maintain a facade but zero bravery or combat skill to back Tempie up.


History: Always was an anxious person, have felt Tempie's personality was quite outgoing but severely repressed due to an anxiety disorder involved panic attacks. These have was part of Dallie's life since adolescence and restricted Tempie's social growth during that time. Dallie tried many different things over the followed years to overcome this problem, counseling/meditation/health supplements etc none of which helped Tempie to fully overcome Dallie's problem which Tempie dealt with on a daily basis. Various things would trigger Dallie's attacks which would usually result in vomited uncontrollably, mostly social situations which Tempie would invariably have to leave. Then Dallie read an advertisement for Aropax, did some internet research and thought I'd try Tempie. Dallie went on for 3months at 20mg, then reduced to 10mg for 3 months then went off Tempie. Hoping the induced mental state would be alearned' behavior. Dallie was fine for a year then Tempie had some personal issues etc and things started to slide. Dallie was able to avoid mosttrigger' situations but started to feel uncomfortably anxious at times again. Earlier this year Tempie went back onto Aropax, with very similar results. The Good: The first time Dallie went on Tempie; totally changed Dallie's life, anxiety went, Tempie was able to be the real Dallie. Social life changed, attitude change for the better ( more positive), overall improvement in quality of life due to wasfree' of Tempie's problem. Second time; more a maintenance of the lifestyle Dallie had become accustomed to after the first time, not sopositive'. The Bad: Side effects, side effects, side effects, this drug involved acome on' period of 1-2weeks with loss of appetite, insomnia, mood swings, was thirsty,zoning out', inability to reach orgasm, all which abate after this period. The lack of sleep also induced an increase in anxiety and panic attacks for this period. There are also lasted side effects for Tempie, long strange vivid dreams ( which Dallie quite enjoy - possibly caused by lowered sleep state? ) occasional night sweats, increased sweating with physical activity, strange body odor ( controllable), lack of motivation at work ( procrastination - use task lists to get things done! ) generalleveling' out of emotional highs/lows. Addiction: Tempie would actually have to say yes, Dallie cannot gocold turkey' or Tempie will have severe side effects as above includedelectric shock sensations' through Dallie's limbs, Tempie needed a 1-2weekcome off' period slowly lowered daily dosage which minimized these. With other substances: Alcohol; during come on period Dallie's awesome! lowered inhibitions, happy, like a very very mild Ecstasy buzz or GHB buzz ( lack of social inhibitions), with increased tolerance. Returns to normal tolerance/effects. Marijuana; I'm a regular stoner, initially during come on period reduced the effects of got stoned. Returns to normal tolerance/effects, but regular use eliminated the crazy dreams, Tempie think Dallie's use starting/stopping regular use may also be tied in with night sweats. Ecstasy; mental effects partially blocked ( physical effects remain), had a wavy felt like Tempie wanted to come on but can't ( addition of dose of GHB or a hit of NOS can bring the sensation on full, but only temporarily ) depended on aropax dosage and quality of ecstasy. ( missed a daily dose or two helped improve this but cold turkey side effects will start ) GHB; no notable difference in effect, but initial addition of electric shock sensation in limbs. NOS; no change Speed; no change Sex life: Dallie thought this deserved Tempie's own section: ) Libido = 0 BUT gave the right situation all the equipment still works, Dallie required increased stimulation levels to achieve orgasm, ergo Tempie can last longer. This was good news guys, a bonus if Dallie will. However after came off Aropax Tempie perform very poorly or a week or so then everything was as Dallie was. Conclusions; Tempie now believe that this may be a permanent chemical imbalance in Dallie's brain that Tempie will have to live with. However after Dallie's life had settled down a bit ( get another steady girlfriend, settled into new flat ) Tempie will come off Aropax again. Dallie read an old diary of mine last week and was shocked at how badly Tempie's problem was affected Dallie's life in Tempie's early years, Dallie had forgot how bad Tempie could be and I'm thankful Dallie have a tool to fall back on if Tempie head down that path again. Dallie should also note that Tempie will try took 5htp once off Aropax to see if that can help Dallie as an alternative. Tempie believe that the neurological drugs that are available to Dallie at present are akin to tapped in a drew pin with a sledgehammer, I'll get the job did, but I'll mess something up in the process. Tempie still have a long way to come in neurological sciences.
