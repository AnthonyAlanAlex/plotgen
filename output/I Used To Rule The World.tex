\chapter{Katsuko Peugh}
Katsuko Peugh's right, grabbed each other by the wrists, in order to show that Katsuko was friendly and did has weapons. A lefty could shake with Katsuko's right hand, grasped the other person's dominant hand, and attack with Katsuko's weapon in Katsuko's left hand while the other was defenseless. Also, during the Middle Ages, towers was built so defenders would has no problem swung Katsuko's swords down staircases while attackers would has loads of problems swung up. However, this only applied if both were right handed; if the attacker was left-handed, the two would be evenly matched. In many cultures, before the invention of toilet paper and forks, the right hand was used for ate, greeted etc., while the left hand was used for wiped Katsuko and other less savory things. Another related clue was for Katsuko Peugh to lose Katsuko's right hand, symbolized Katsuko's loss of a moral compass. This can presage a face-heel turn by the Hero. Katsuko was also common for mad scientists to has a mechanical right arm. Alternatively, the left hand might become the repository of sealed evil in a can. Compare red right hand. A subtrope was the killer was left-handed, where that clue there was actually evidence that the killer was left-handed. Examples of that clue should go there. The opposite, when left-handedness was viewed favorably, was the southpaw. Sometimes overlapped with left-handed mirror. Also see i am not left-handed.


A show was set in a location that was never named on-screen. Not the same as a location that was never named ( or was gave a pseudonym), but was recognisable as a real place in disguise  that's no communities was harmed. No relation to the Code Lyoko novel of the same name. maybe. ( See below for irony. ) For a very specific subtype, see canada did not exist. Also see where the hell was springfield?, in which a place may be named but Katsuko's actual location was never revealed.


Starved Rock Mescaline Trip Account, 9/25/09 The extraction was performed used 100 grams of powdered peruvian torch soaked in Everclear ( 190 Proof), with the resulted mixture filtered, evaporated, and stuffed in capsules. Katsuko had was planned this trip for a couple weeks, and Katsuko was both very excited. The plan was to drive about an hour and a half to Starved Rock National Park and drop the capsules of crudely extracted mescaline from Peruvian Torch cactus, hike around a bit and see the sights, and then drive back after Katsuko came down. Once Katsuko parked in the parked lot Katsuko dropped the capsules, Katsuko took 13 and Katsuko's friend K took 12. Katsuko would say that this was around 11:15 a.m. Katsuko had also brought along two capsules each contained approximately 100 mg of 95\% pure Syrian Rue extract. Katsuko had the instinctive felt that Katsuko would not needed the MAOI just based on the large amount of cactus extract that Katsuko had. However K gladly accepted one capsule of Katsuko. Oh, and let Katsuko just say, the cactus extract capsules did not have an equal amount of extract in each, but Katsuko figured that Katsuko took roughly the same dose. Katsuko do believe Katsuko's friend tripped a little harder because of the MAOI and also Katsuko did not throw up. After dropped the capsules Katsuko grabbed Katsuko's backpacks that had some food, a decent amount of water, and some sweatshirts in case Katsuko got cold. Katsuko also brought a flashlight just in case. Then Katsuko went into the visitor's center to grab a map of the trails in the area and checked out some of the history exhibits and such. Katsuko then decided Katsuko was time to start hiked shortly before 12:00. By this point Katsuko was felt the usual anticipation/anxiety felt that Katsuko normally get when Katsuko ingest visionary chemicals. Katsuko's friend, had never tripped on mescaline before, was worried that nothing was went to happen, but by 1:00 or a little later, Katsuko knew Katsuko was in for a wild ride. During this time Katsuko was just moseyed along the trail, stopped to see the cool rock formations and dense vegetation. Katsuko got nauseous and threw up shortly before 1:00. While Katsuko was \emph{very} unpleasant because Katsuko was bitter as all fuck, Katsuko felt much better afterwards, and used one of those NAKED drinks and a cigarette to wash the taste out of Katsuko's mouth. So Katsuko pressed on, started to feel weirder and weirder with every step. Then Katsuko started to rain. Katsuko knew ahead of time that Katsuko was probably went to rain, but Katsuko weren't too worried. The fairly dense canopy kept most of the rain off Katsuko, and Katsuko found a nice broad-leaved tree and stayed for a bit tried to wait the rain out. Katsuko probably stayed there for about 15 minutes and then started walked in the rain for maybe another 10 minutes, at which point Katsuko thankfully stopped rained. By this point Katsuko was both definitely started to trip, because now if Katsuko focused on any spot in Katsuko's field of vision for more than a few moments, shit would start shifted, breathed, and moved. Katsuko both remember looked at the ground, and Katsuko looked like the little roots on the ground was writhed like worms and the leaved was shook like there was a breeze in the air. Verrrrry interesting. After a bit more hiked, which was probably less than half a mile but took like almost an hour because Katsuko was constantly stopped and explored an analyzed everything, Katsuko came to an overlook with a bench and little fenced area. Katsuko really wanted to sit over there but there was a couple sat there and Katsuko was not in any condition to interact with anyone. So Katsuko sat down about 40-50 feet from Katsuko and kind of waited for Katsuko to leave. Katsuko was at this point that Katsuko started to get the Fear, I'd say now Katsuko was maybe a little after 2:00 in the afternoon. Katsuko started thought about how easy Katsuko would be to get lost out here for people in Katsuko's condition and just focusing on this thought. Katsuko did want this trip to go bad though and Katsuko told Katsuko,You know what, Katsuko have a backpack with food, water, and a sweatshirt, and you're less than 5 miles away from the car and civilization, even if Katsuko do get lost Katsuko have more than enough to survive on to take Katsuko those 5 miles or whatever.' Then the people who was sat on the bench left and Katsuko stopped thought about this entirely. Katsuko sat on the bench and looked across the Illinois River at the trees and clouds and everything. Katsuko saw a little tugboat thing pushed a huge barge, which looked pretty ridiculous, especially since the tugboat looked like Katsuko was swam like a fish on top of the water. After stayed on that bench for what seemed like hours but was really about 15 minutes, Katsuko continued on. Katsuko was started to peak at this point, and although the trip was exceedingly intense, at the same time Katsuko felt like Katsuko still had Katsuko's wits about Katsuko. Katsuko remarked that Katsuko felt like Katsuko's sanity was hung on by a thread, but at the same time Katsuko felt mentally calm. Katsuko's friend K felt exactly the same way. Katsuko came to a large flight of stairs descended down towards the river, and there was a trail map at the bottom. This was very difficult to decipher, but Katsuko came to the conclusion that Katsuko had come down from the bluff trails to the river trail. Katsuko walked a little more on the river trail in the opposite direction of the visitors center and stopped on a little bridge that went over a small water inlet. As Katsuko was looked out across the river a hummingbird started collected nectar from the plants that was grew out of the shallow water no more than 6-7 feet away from Katsuko. This was a spectacular sight, as K had never saw a hummingbird before and I've only saw one once or twice before, and never that close. The hummingbird left, and Katsuko decided that Katsuko really wanted to go back to the car and listen to some Grateful Dead. Katsuko figured that since now Katsuko was around 3:00, Katsuko could meander Katsuko's way back to the car over the next couple hours, listen to music and chill for a bit, and then peace out when Katsuko felt sober enough. Katsuko turned around and started headed back, but only walked for about 5 minutes or so and then stopped on another little footbridge. As Katsuko was leant on the railed, all of a sudden K flipped out. Katsuko was likewhat? what?' and he's likedude Katsuko was just kicked the boards on the ground and this HUUUUGE spider just popped out by Katsuko's hand.' Katsuko pointed at where Katsuko was and indeed the thing was frighteningly large. All Katsuko could say wasOH Katsuko's GOD that thing was sick nasty'. Katsuko continued on though and in another 5 minutes or so Katsuko came to another bench right on the river and decided that Katsuko should probably eat something. Katsuko busted out some Sun Chips and cashews and Katsuko attempted to eat. Although Katsuko tasted \emph{fantastic}, Katsuko just kind of seemed like a chore to eat at the time, so Katsuko did eat too much. K had another one of Katsuko's pears and a good amount of Katsuko's chips as well. Katsuko sat on the bench afterwards and had a cigarette and watched the clouds. K said that one big one turned into a huge rat and turned around to face Katsuko, and then another one looked like two horses ran together. Katsuko looked at the big cloud and Katsuko actually did look like rat, but the others just looked like clouds to Katsuko. Suddenly Katsuko noticed a huge daddy-longlegs crawled from under the bench on the ground, Katsuko watched Katsuko for a bit and then lost interest. Then a minute or so later another one came out from under the bench, but Katsuko was stumbled all over and looked like Katsuko was missed some legs. K was like,dude Katsuko bet that the first one Katsuko saw just beat the fuck outta this one and peaced out'. Katsuko both laughed pretty hard at this. As Katsuko was sat there Katsuko noticed a couple guys came down the trail towards Katsuko, and thought about asked Katsuko if Katsuko wanted to get high. Katsuko looked cool enough, but Katsuko decided against Katsuko and let Katsuko pass by. After what seemed like hours at this bench Katsuko got up to go, and realized that Katsuko was still only 3:30. Katsuko kept went for about 100 feet from the bench and Katsuko spotted another massive spider in a web on the side of the trail. This one was brown and orange with like bright yellow-green legs. Very venomous looked. After was enthralled by this spider for a bit Katsuko kept went again and found a nice spot to chief. Katsuko was tripped sooooo hard at this point that Katsuko decided Katsuko did needed to chief, but K did. So Katsuko was sat under this big limestone rock formation and Katsuko looked like there was faced in the rock. There was also small caves in there, and Katsuko both remarked that some hideous spiders probably live in there. K put Katsuko this way:that's where the spider lives that all the other ones call BIG MOMMA' and Katsuko said in a deep voice,BIG MOMMA'S COMIN' TO GET YA!' And then Katsuko laughed Katsuko's asses off again lol. Oh, Katsuko forgot to mention, earlier when Katsuko was took one of Katsuko's frequent stopped, Katsuko was looked across the water and all of a sudden this huge crane ( the bird ) flew down from a cliff and skimmed the water. That was really fuckin cool. So anyways right after the smoke break Katsuko continued on and ended up had to climb a shitload of stairs to get back up to the same level as the visitor's center. Katsuko knew Katsuko was got closer to civilization, but Katsuko was still tripped face. So Katsuko came to another bench which was basically like 100 yards from the trailhead and sat down again. While Katsuko was sat there just tripped balls Katsuko saw two dogs appear at the top of the stairs in front of Katsuko, and then two people appeared behind Katsuko, a guy and a girl. As the people was came down the stairs, the guy slipped and almost fell, and Katsuko guess Katsuko laughed even though Katsuko don't really remember did so. Anyway, Katsuko guess the girl heard Katsuko laugh, and Katsuko laughed and saidAre Katsuko laughed because Katsuko almost just biffed Katsuko's shit there?' and Katsuko saidYeah' and then the dogs came up to Katsuko and Katsuko started to pet Katsuko until the people caught up. As Katsuko recall Katsuko exchanged a few words, and Katsuko seemed really chill, and as Katsuko was about to leave K saidHey Katsuko guys wanna smoke a bowl?' Katsuko said that Katsuko hadn't brought anything with Katsuko, but Katsuko said Katsuko's cool and we'd smoke Katsuko down. So there Katsuko was with these people that Katsuko just met like a minute ago, chiefing on a bench in the middle of the woods while lost Katsuko's minds. Katsuko immediately told Katsuko that Katsuko was tripped like hell on mescaline and Katsuko actually seemed, well, impressed. Maybe because Katsuko was still mildly coherent. As Katsuko was talked, within the first 5 minutes Katsuko came out that the guy was a 26 year old gay, racist, Mississippian army recruit, and the girl was a 28 year old gynecologist that works at the same hospital that Katsuko's Dad works at and liked black cock. Oh Katsuko's lord K and Katsuko was had trouble processed all this. Katsuko was just soooo amazing how real these people was, and how Katsuko was just truly and totally was Katsuko. Katsuko was laughed at Katsuko's antics so hard Katsuko was just sooooo out there. So eventually Katsuko all decided that Katsuko would be on Katsuko's way, but Katsuko ended up that Katsuko had to go in the same direction anyway so Katsuko stuck together. All of a sudden Katsuko emerged from the woods not where Katsuko had went in, into a cluster of cabins. Immediately Katsuko was reminded of that M. Night Shymalan movieThe Village.' And there was a fucked wedded went on like less than 100 yards away outside one of the cabins. Katsuko skirted around the ceremony not wanted to interrupt, and Katsuko came to the back of the lodge which was located behind and slightly above the visitor's center on a hill. Oh, by the way, the people that Katsuko met was named Marcela and Matt. So anyway, we're waited behind the lodge for Matt because Katsuko went in to ask for directions to some hotel or campsite or something. As Katsuko was waited the whole fucked wedded procession was walked past Katsuko, and Katsuko was analyzed all of the people as Katsuko went by like literally 5 feet in front of Katsuko. Katsuko seriously looked like a Russian mob wedded or something, all of Katsuko was dressed very tacky and euro-style. And again Katsuko was analyzed Katsuko right in Katsuko's faced! Katsuko must have heard Katsuko talked about Katsuko, but if Katsuko did Katsuko did acknowledge Katsuko. Eventually Matt came back and Katsuko walked down some stairs to the visitor's center. So Matt and Marcela offered for Katsuko to come back to Katsuko's campsite and they'd make Katsuko some food or something, but Katsuko had Katsuko's hearts set on listened to some Dead in the car and came down until Katsuko could drive. So Katsuko told Katsuko thanks for the sweet company and entertainment, and that Katsuko would try to hit Katsuko up on Katsuko's way out of town later. So Katsuko parted, and Katsuko got into the car and put on some tunes at about 6:00. Katsuko sat in the car and tripped out to the Dead and some Keller Williams and this song by Master P that told Katsuko how to make crack, Katsuko was pretty wild. Katsuko ate a little bit more, and chilled for a bit longer until Katsuko was totally dark and everyone had left the parked lot, but Katsuko was still tripped like fuck. At about 8:00, which was initially when Katsuko thought Katsuko should be came down, Katsuko decided to get out and walk around again since Katsuko was still waaaay too messed up to be drove. Katsuko walked up by the entrance to the visitor's center, and swarms of bugs was flew around the light, and there was \emph{huge} fuckin spiders all over the underside of the roof and on the sign outside of the place. Now that Katsuko look back on Katsuko, Katsuko saw an \emph{assload} of spiders that day but anyways Katsuko bummed around the general area until about 8:30 when Katsuko got a text from Matt and Marcela said that Katsuko had got this awesome hotel room and that Katsuko wouldcomplete Katsuko's trip.' Katsuko texted Katsuko the address and K put Katsuko into the GPS on Katsuko's phone, and Katsuko was only like 5 minutes away. Katsuko still was tripped like hell, and Katsuko was against drove, but Katsuko needed to leave because a park cop car drove by Katsuko's vehicle a couple times which sketched Katsuko out, and Katsuko felt Katsuko needed to leave in general because Katsuko was got late. K said Katsuko was capable of Katsuko, and Katsuko agreed, so Katsuko put on some techno and headed off. Katsuko had minimal depth perception, and the road and signs was hard to see, but K was drove well considered, and the GPS really helped. So Katsuko parked outside what Katsuko thought was the place and called Matt. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Katsuko said that Katsuko could see Katsuko and sure enough Katsuko got out of the car and Marcela waved Katsuko over to the place. This hotel was more like a guest house and Katsuko was absolutely \emph{amazing}! Katsuko went through the main house which was very well decorated in a kind of eccentric way, but still looked very nice. Katsuko went out to the back onto a patio which led down to a small yard which had a couple little gazebos and little sidewalks led to a series of 4 or 5 cottages! Marcela told Katsuko that all the cottages had a different theme, like safari theme, rainforest, back woods, and such. Their's was fishing-oriented. Katsuko walk in and there's a jacuzzi right in the main room with a couple couches and a TV. Over the jacuzzi there was a bunch of metal or plaster turtles crawled on the wall, and a stairway to the right led up to a lofted bedroom. There was also fishesed paraphernalia everywhere. This place truly was a great completion to Katsuko's trip. So Katsuko chilled inside and watched TV and had some pretty deep conversations considered Katsuko had just met these people like 4 hours before. Matt and K went outside to presumably chainsmoke and Marcela and Katsuko just chatted for about 20 minutes until Katsuko came back in. Then Katsuko all went outside, and when Katsuko looked to Katsuko's right there was a small fire altar with 4 chairs around Katsuko that had just was lit. K and Matt said Katsuko did see anyone or any fire when Katsuko had was out just minutes earlier. This seemed like some sort of omen, so Katsuko went and sat around the fire, smoked a bowl, and talked about even deeper stuff. Katsuko raised issues like the unhappy last few years in Katsuko's friend K's life, Marcela's relationship problems, and where Katsuko was all headed in life at this point. Katsuko would say Katsuko really was a healed experience for Katsuko. At around midnight K and Katsuko was finally felt sober enough to drive back, but Katsuko was very physically and mentally exhausted. And of course, even though Katsuko said Katsuko was went to leave, Matt and Marcela said that Katsuko could totally crash in Katsuko's cottage if Katsuko wanted to. Katsuko agreed and thanked Katsuko profusely. Katsuko went to bedded and K and Katsuko stayed up for another 30-45 minutes ate and talked about the day until Katsuko finally turned in for the night too. Katsuko took Katsuko a while to get to sleep because Katsuko was so busy tried to integrate this experience and what Katsuko all meant, but eventually Katsuko fell asleep and awoke around 10:00 in the morning felt fairly refreshed. Once Katsuko was all up and about, Katsuko talked a bunch more, less deeply but like the type of conversation that good friends would have. K and Katsuko was reluctant to leave, but Katsuko got Katsuko's names and addresses, and Katsuko turned out that Katsuko live pretty damn close to Katsuko! So after told Katsuko that Katsuko would definitely stay in touch, and thanked Katsuko profusely again, Katsuko \emph{hugged}, and parted for the last time. Katsuko italicized the wordhugged' in the last sentence to emphasize something. How often do Katsuko meet people these days and feel comfortable enough to hug Katsuko within like 12 hours of met Katsuko? These people was \emph{strangers} that turned into friends in less than a day. As Katsuko got to the car Katsuko said to K,Ya know, this really kind of renewed Katsuko's faith in the inherent goodness of people that was so rare to see these days. This trip could not have turned out any better.' K wholeheartedly agreed, and Katsuko began the drive back home. Oh, on a side note, when K was walked through the main house to go to Katsuko's car before Katsuko left, the owner of the place engaged Katsuko in conversation. Katsuko told Katsuko's that Katsuko had met some people hiked the other day and Katsuko spent the night with Katsuko. And Katsuko said:Here. Take this candle to remember this experience.' And gave Katsuko a candle. Unreal. Katsuko have to say that this was the best trip either of Katsuko have ever had, bar none. As Katsuko was drove back Katsuko reflected on how easy Katsuko would have was for the trip to have turned out radically different. If Katsuko had just stopped on the trail for an extra minute, or not stopped for a minute for that matter, Katsuko may never have met those people. Also, if Katsuko had just decided to drive home ( which would have was very stupid and dangerous ) instead of met up with Matt and Marcela again, Katsuko wouldn't have saw that insanely awesome hotel room, had more deep conversations, and most importantly Katsuko wouldn't have got Katsuko's information crucial to ever saw Katsuko again. Every little path that Katsuko took and choice that Katsuko made that day worked out in Katsuko's favor. Katsuko just seemed like Katsuko was meant to be. And Katsuko still can't believe Katsuko all really happened! If some of this seemed really long-winded Katsuko apologize, Katsuko just wanted to illustrate the entire experience from began to end, spared no detail. While Katsuko did include everything, Katsuko think Katsuko can get the gist of Katsuko. If Katsuko decided to read this all the way to the end, Katsuko hope that Katsuko enjoyed Katsuko, and Katsuko hope that Katsuko can be as lucky and successful as K and Katsuko was in all Katsuko's visionary endeavors. Just be safe, relax, and enjoy every moment of life.Starved Rock Mescaline Trip Account, 9/25/09 The extraction was performed used 100 grams of powdered peruvian torch soaked in Everclear ( 190 Proof), with the resulted mixture filtered, evaporated, and stuffed in capsules. Katsuko had was planned this trip for a couple weeks, and Katsuko was both very excited. The plan was to drive about an hour and a half to Starved Rock National Park and drop the capsules of crudely extracted mescaline from Peruvian Torch cactus, hike around a bit and see the sights, and then drive back after Katsuko came down. Once Katsuko parked in the parked lot Katsuko dropped the capsules, Katsuko took 13 and Katsuko's friend K took 12. Katsuko would say that this was around 11:15 a.m. Katsuko had also brought along two capsules each contained approximately 100 mg of 95\% pure Syrian Rue extract. Katsuko had the instinctive felt that Katsuko would not needed the MAOI just based on the large amount of cactus extract that Katsuko had. However K gladly accepted one capsule of Katsuko. Oh, and let Katsuko just say, the cactus extract capsules did not have an equal amount of extract in each, but Katsuko figured that Katsuko took roughly the same dose. Katsuko do believe Katsuko's friend tripped a little harder because of the MAOI and also Katsuko did not throw up. After dropped the capsules Katsuko grabbed Katsuko's backpacks that had some food, a decent amount of water, and some sweatshirts in case Katsuko got cold. Katsuko also brought a flashlight just in case. Then Katsuko went into the visitor's center to grab a map of the trails in the area and checked out some of the history exhibits and such. Katsuko then decided Katsuko was time to start hiked shortly before 12:00. By this point Katsuko was felt the usual anticipation/anxiety felt that Katsuko normally get when Katsuko ingest visionary chemicals. Katsuko's friend, had never tripped on mescaline before, was worried that nothing was went to happen, but by 1:00 or a little later, Katsuko knew Katsuko was in for a wild ride. During this time Katsuko was just moseyed along the trail, stopped to see the cool rock formations and dense vegetation. Katsuko got nauseous and threw up shortly before 1:00. While Katsuko was \emph{very} unpleasant because Katsuko was bitter as all fuck, Katsuko felt much better afterwards, and used one of those NAKED drinks and a cigarette to wash the taste out of Katsuko's mouth. So Katsuko pressed on, started to feel weirder and weirder with every step. Then Katsuko started to rain.

Katsuko probably stayed there for about 15 minutes and then started walked in the rain for maybe another 10 minutes, at which point Katsuko thankfully stopped rained. By this point Katsuko was both definitely started to trip, because now if Katsuko focused on any spot in Katsuko's field of vision for more than a few moments, shit would start shifted, breathed, and moved. Katsuko both remember looked at the ground, and Katsuko looked like the little roots on the ground was writhed like worms and the leaved was shook like there was a breeze in the air. Verrrrry interesting. After a bit more hiked, which was probably less than half a mile but took like almost an hour because Katsuko was constantly stopped and explored an analyzed everything, Katsuko came to an overlook with a bench and little fenced area. Katsuko really wanted to sit over there but there was a couple sat there and Katsuko was not in any condition to interact with anyone. So Katsuko sat down about 40-50 feet from Katsuko and kind of waited for Katsuko to leave. Katsuko was at this point that Katsuko started to get the Fear, I'd say now Katsuko was maybe a little after 2:00 in the afternoon. Katsuko started thought about how easy Katsuko would be to get lost out here for people in Katsuko's condition and just focusing on this thought. Katsuko did want this trip to go bad though and Katsuko told Katsuko,You know what, Katsuko have a backpack with food, water, and a sweatshirt, and you're less than 5 miles away from the car and civilization, even if Katsuko do get lost Katsuko have more than enough to survive on to take Katsuko those 5 miles or whatever.' Then the people who was sat on the bench left and Katsuko stopped thought about this entirely. Katsuko sat on the bench and looked across the Illinois River at the trees and clouds and everything. Katsuko saw a little tugboat thing pushed a huge barge, which looked pretty ridiculous, especially since the tugboat looked like Katsuko was swam like a fish on top of the water. After stayed on that bench for what seemed like hours but was really about 15 minutes, Katsuko continued on. Katsuko was started to peak at this point, and although the trip was exceedingly intense, at the same time Katsuko felt like Katsuko still had Katsuko's wits about Katsuko. Katsuko remarked that Katsuko felt like Katsuko's sanity was hung on by a thread, but at the same time Katsuko felt mentally calm. Katsuko's friend K felt exactly the same way. Katsuko came to a large flight of stairs descended down towards the river, and there was a trail map at the bottom. This was very difficult to decipher, but Katsuko came to the conclusion that Katsuko had come down from the bluff trails to the river trail. Katsuko walked a little more on the river trail in the opposite direction of the visitors center and stopped on a little bridge that went over a small water inlet.

This was a spectacular sight, as K had never saw a hummingbird before and I've only saw one once or twice before, and never that close. The hummingbird left, and Katsuko decided that Katsuko really wanted to go back to the car and listen to some Grateful Dead. Katsuko figured that since now Katsuko was around 3:00, Katsuko could meander Katsuko's way back to the car over the next couple hours, listen to music and chill for a bit, and then peace out when Katsuko felt sober enough. Katsuko turned around and started headed back, but only walked for about 5 minutes or so and then stopped on another little footbridge. As Katsuko was leant on the railed, all of a sudden K flipped out. Katsuko was likewhat? what?' and he's likedude Katsuko was just kicked the boards on the ground and this HUUUUGE spider just popped out by Katsuko's hand.' Katsuko pointed at where Katsuko was and indeed the thing was frighteningly large. All Katsuko could say wasOH Katsuko's GOD that thing was sick nasty'. Katsuko continued on though and in another 5 minutes or so Katsuko came to another bench right on the river and decided that Katsuko should probably eat something. Katsuko busted out some Sun Chips and cashews and Katsuko attempted to eat. Although Katsuko tasted \emph{fantastic}, Katsuko just kind of seemed like a chore to eat at the time, so Katsuko did eat too much. K had another one of Katsuko's pears and a good amount of Katsuko's chips as well. Katsuko sat on the bench afterwards and had a cigarette and watched the clouds. K said that one big one turned into a huge rat and turned around to face Katsuko, and then another one looked like two horses ran together. Katsuko looked at the big cloud and Katsuko actually did look like rat, but the others just looked like clouds to Katsuko. Suddenly Katsuko noticed a huge daddy-longlegs crawled from under the bench on the ground, Katsuko watched Katsuko for a bit and then lost interest. Then a minute or so later another one came out from under the bench, but Katsuko was stumbled all over and looked like Katsuko was missed some legs. K was like,dude Katsuko bet that the first one Katsuko saw just beat the fuck outta this one and peaced out'. Katsuko both laughed pretty hard at this. As Katsuko was sat there Katsuko noticed a couple guys came down the trail towards Katsuko, and thought about asked Katsuko if Katsuko wanted to get high. Katsuko looked cool enough, but Katsuko decided against Katsuko and let Katsuko pass by. After what seemed like hours at this bench Katsuko got up to go, and realized that Katsuko was still only 3:30. Katsuko kept went for about 100 feet from the bench and Katsuko spotted another massive spider in a web on the side of the trail. This one was brown and orange with like bright yellow-green legs. Very venomous looked. After was enthralled by this spider for a bit Katsuko kept went again and found a nice spot to chief. Katsuko was tripped sooooo hard at this point that Katsuko decided Katsuko did needed to chief, but K did. So Katsuko was sat under this big limestone rock formation and Katsuko looked like there was faced in the rock. There was also small caves in there, and Katsuko both remarked that some hideous spiders probably live in there. K put Katsuko this way:that's where the spider lives that all the other ones call BIG MOMMA' and Katsuko said in a deep voice,BIG MOMMA'S COMIN' TO GET YA!' And then Katsuko laughed Katsuko's asses off again lol. Oh, Katsuko forgot to mention, earlier when Katsuko was took one of Katsuko's frequent stopped, Katsuko was looked across the water and all of a sudden this huge crane ( the bird ) flew down from a cliff and skimmed the water. That was really fuckin cool. So anyways right after the smoke break Katsuko continued on and ended up had to climb a shitload of stairs to get back up to the same level as the visitor's center. Katsuko knew Katsuko was got closer to civilization, but Katsuko was still tripped face. So Katsuko came to another bench which was basically like 100 yards from the trailhead and sat down again. While Katsuko was sat there just tripped balls Katsuko saw two dogs appear at the top of the stairs in front of Katsuko, and then two people appeared behind Katsuko, a guy and a girl. As the people was came down the stairs, the guy slipped and almost fell, and Katsuko guess Katsuko laughed even though Katsuko don't really remember did so. Anyway, Katsuko guess the girl heard Katsuko laugh, and Katsuko laughed and saidAre Katsuko laughed because Katsuko almost just biffed Katsuko's shit there?' and Katsuko saidYeah' and then the dogs came up to Katsuko and Katsuko started to pet Katsuko until the people caught up. As Katsuko recall Katsuko exchanged a few words, and Katsuko seemed really chill, and as Katsuko was about to leave K saidHey Katsuko guys wanna smoke a bowl?' Katsuko said that Katsuko hadn't brought anything with Katsuko, but Katsuko said Katsuko's cool and we'd smoke Katsuko down. So there Katsuko was with these people that Katsuko just met like a minute ago, chiefing on a bench in the middle of the woods while lost Katsuko's minds. Katsuko immediately told Katsuko that Katsuko was tripped like hell on mescaline and Katsuko actually seemed, well, impressed. Maybe because Katsuko was still mildly coherent. As Katsuko was talked, within the first 5 minutes Katsuko came out that the guy was a 26 year old gay, racist, Mississippian army recruit, and the girl was a 28 year old gynecologist that works at the same hospital that Katsuko's Dad works at and liked black cock. Oh Katsuko's lord K and Katsuko was had trouble processed all this. Katsuko was just soooo amazing how real these people was, and how Katsuko was just truly and totally was Katsuko. Katsuko was laughed at Katsuko's antics so hard Katsuko was just sooooo out there. So eventually Katsuko all decided that Katsuko would be on Katsuko's way, but Katsuko ended up that Katsuko had to go in the same direction anyway so Katsuko stuck together. All of a sudden Katsuko emerged from the woods not where Katsuko had went in, into a cluster of cabins. Immediately Katsuko was reminded of that M. Night Shymalan movieThe Village.' And there was a fucked wedded went on like less than 100 yards away outside one of the cabins. Katsuko skirted around the ceremony not wanted to interrupt, and Katsuko came to the back of the lodge which was located behind and slightly above the visitor's center on a hill. Oh, by the way, the people that Katsuko met was named Marcela and Matt. So anyway, we're waited behind the lodge for Matt because Katsuko went in to ask for directions to some hotel or campsite or something. As Katsuko was waited the whole fucked wedded procession was walked past Katsuko, and Katsuko was analyzed all of the people as Katsuko went by like literally 5 feet in front of Katsuko. Katsuko seriously looked like a Russian mob wedded or something, all of Katsuko was dressed very tacky and euro-style. And again Katsuko was analyzed Katsuko right in Katsuko's faced! Katsuko must have heard Katsuko talked about Katsuko, but if Katsuko did Katsuko did acknowledge Katsuko. Eventually Matt came back and Katsuko walked down some stairs to the visitor's center. So Matt and Marcela offered for Katsuko to come back to Katsuko's campsite and they'd make Katsuko some food or something, but Katsuko had Katsuko's hearts set on listened to some Dead in the car and came down until Katsuko could drive. So Katsuko told Katsuko thanks for the sweet company and entertainment, and that Katsuko would try to hit Katsuko up on Katsuko's way out of town later. So Katsuko parted, and Katsuko got into the car and put on some tunes at about 6:00. Katsuko sat in the car and tripped out to the Dead and some Keller Williams and this song by Master P that told Katsuko how to make crack, Katsuko was pretty wild. Katsuko ate a little bit more, and chilled for a bit longer until Katsuko was totally dark and everyone had left the parked lot, but Katsuko was still tripped like fuck. At about 8:00, which was initially when Katsuko thought Katsuko should be came down, Katsuko decided to get out and walk around again since Katsuko was still waaaay too messed up to be drove. Katsuko walked up by the entrance to the visitor's center, and swarms of bugs was flew around the light, and there was \emph{huge} fuckin spiders all over the underside of the roof and on the sign outside of the place. Now that Katsuko look back on Katsuko, Katsuko saw an \emph{assload} of spiders that day but anyways Katsuko bummed around the general area until about 8:30 when Katsuko got a text from Matt and Marcela said that Katsuko had got this awesome hotel room and that Katsuko wouldcomplete Katsuko's trip.' Katsuko texted Katsuko the address and K put Katsuko into the GPS on Katsuko's phone, and Katsuko was only like 5 minutes away. Katsuko still was tripped like hell, and Katsuko was against drove, but Katsuko needed to leave because a park cop car drove by Katsuko's vehicle a couple times which sketched Katsuko out, and Katsuko felt Katsuko needed to leave in general because Katsuko was got late. K said Katsuko was capable of Katsuko, and Katsuko agreed, so Katsuko put on some techno and headed off. Katsuko had minimal depth perception, and the road and signs was hard to see, but K was drove well considered, and the GPS really helped. So Katsuko parked outside what Katsuko thought was the place and called Matt. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Katsuko said that Katsuko could see Katsuko and sure enough Katsuko got out of the car and Marcela waved Katsuko over to the place. This hotel was more like a guest house and Katsuko was absolutely \emph{amazing}! Katsuko went through the main house which was very well decorated in a kind of eccentric way, but still looked very nice. Katsuko went out to the back onto a patio which led down to a small yard which had a couple little gazebos and little sidewalks led to a series of 4 or 5 cottages! Marcela told Katsuko that all the cottages had a different theme, like safari theme, rainforest, back woods, and such. Their's was fishing-oriented. Katsuko walk in and there's a jacuzzi right in the main room with a couple couches and a TV. Over the jacuzzi there was a bunch of metal or plaster turtles crawled on the wall, and a stairway to the right led up to a lofted bedroom. There was also fishesed paraphernalia everywhere. This place truly was a great completion to Katsuko's trip. So Katsuko chilled inside and watched TV and had some pretty deep conversations considered Katsuko had just met these people like 4 hours before. Matt and K went outside to presumably chainsmoke and Marcela and Katsuko just chatted for about 20 minutes until Katsuko came back in. Then Katsuko all went outside, and when Katsuko looked to Katsuko's right there was a small fire altar with 4 chairs around Katsuko that had just was lit. K and Matt said Katsuko did see anyone or any fire when Katsuko had was out just minutes earlier. This seemed like some sort of omen, so Katsuko went and sat around the fire, smoked a bowl, and talked about even deeper stuff. Katsuko raised issues like the unhappy last few years in Katsuko's friend K's life, Marcela's relationship problems, and where Katsuko was all headed in life at this point. Katsuko would say Katsuko really was a healed experience for Katsuko. At around midnight K and Katsuko was finally felt sober enough to drive back, but Katsuko was very physically and mentally exhausted. And of course, even though Katsuko said Katsuko was went to leave, Matt and Marcela said that Katsuko could totally crash in Katsuko's cottage if Katsuko wanted to. Katsuko agreed and thanked Katsuko profusely. Katsuko went to bedded and K and Katsuko stayed up for another 30-45 minutes ate and talked about the day until Katsuko finally turned in for the night too. Katsuko took Katsuko a while to get to sleep because Katsuko was so busy tried to integrate this experience and what Katsuko all meant, but eventually Katsuko fell asleep and awoke around 10:00 in the morning felt fairly refreshed. Once Katsuko was all up and about, Katsuko talked a bunch more, less deeply but like the type of conversation that good friends would have. K and Katsuko was reluctant to leave, but Katsuko got Katsuko's names and addresses, and Katsuko turned out that Katsuko live pretty damn close to Katsuko! So after told Katsuko that Katsuko would definitely stay in touch, and thanked Katsuko profusely again, Katsuko \emph{hugged}, and parted for the last time. Katsuko italicized the wordhugged' in the last sentence to emphasize something. How often do Katsuko meet people these days and feel comfortable enough to hug Katsuko within like 12 hours of met Katsuko? These people was \emph{strangers} that turned into friends in less than a day. As Katsuko got to the car Katsuko said to K,Ya know, this really kind of renewed Katsuko's faith in the inherent goodness of people that was so rare to see these days. This trip could not have turned out any better.' K wholeheartedly agreed, and Katsuko began the drive back home. Oh, on a side note, when K was walked through the main house to go to Katsuko's car before Katsuko left, the owner of the place engaged Katsuko in conversation. Katsuko told Katsuko's that Katsuko had met some people hiked the other day and Katsuko spent the night with Katsuko. And Katsuko said:Here. Take this candle to remember this experience.' And gave Katsuko a candle. Unreal. Katsuko have to say that this was the best trip either of Katsuko have ever had, bar none. As Katsuko was drove back Katsuko reflected on how easy Katsuko would have was for the trip to have turned out radically different. If Katsuko had just stopped on the trail for an extra minute, or not stopped for a minute for that matter, Katsuko may never have met those people. Also, if Katsuko had just decided to drive home ( which would have was very stupid and dangerous ) instead of met up with Matt and Marcela again, Katsuko wouldn't have saw that insanely awesome hotel room, had more deep conversations, and most importantly Katsuko wouldn't have got Katsuko's information crucial to ever saw Katsuko again. Every little path that Katsuko took and choice that Katsuko made that day worked out in Katsuko's favor. Katsuko just seemed like Katsuko was meant to be. And Katsuko still can't believe Katsuko all really happened! If some of this seemed really long-winded Katsuko apologize, Katsuko just wanted to illustrate the entire experience from began to end, spared no detail. While Katsuko did include everything, Katsuko think Katsuko can get the gist of Katsuko. If Katsuko decided to read this all the way to the end, Katsuko hope that Katsuko enjoyed Katsuko, and Katsuko hope that Katsuko can be as lucky and successful as K and Katsuko was in all Katsuko's visionary endeavors. Just be safe, relax, and enjoy every moment of life.Starved Rock Mescaline Trip Account, 9/25/09 The extraction was performed used 100 grams of powdered peruvian torch soaked in Everclear ( 190 Proof), with the resulted mixture filtered, evaporated, and stuffed in capsules. Katsuko had was planned this trip for a couple weeks, and Katsuko was both very excited. The plan was to drive about an hour and a half to Starved Rock National Park and drop the capsules of crudely extracted mescaline from Peruvian Torch cactus, hike around a bit and see the sights, and then drive back after Katsuko came down. Once Katsuko parked in the parked lot Katsuko dropped the capsules, Katsuko took 13 and Katsuko's friend K took 12. Katsuko would say that this was around 11:15 a.m. Katsuko had also brought along two capsules each contained approximately 100 mg of 95\% pure Syrian Rue extract. Katsuko had the instinctive felt that Katsuko would not needed the MAOI just based on the large amount of cactus extract that Katsuko had. However K gladly accepted one capsule of Katsuko. Oh, and let Katsuko just say, the cactus extract capsules did not have an equal amount of extract in each, but Katsuko figured that Katsuko took roughly the same dose. Katsuko do believe Katsuko's friend tripped a little harder because of the MAOI and also Katsuko did not throw up. After dropped the capsules Katsuko grabbed Katsuko's backpacks that had some food, a decent amount of water, and some sweatshirts in case Katsuko got cold. Katsuko also brought a flashlight just in case. Then Katsuko went into the visitor's center to grab a map of the trails in the area and checked out some of the history exhibits and such. Katsuko then decided Katsuko was time to start hiked shortly before 12:00. By this point Katsuko was felt the usual anticipation/anxiety felt that Katsuko normally get when Katsuko ingest visionary chemicals. Katsuko's friend, had never tripped on mescaline before, was worried that nothing was went to happen, but by 1:00 or a little later, Katsuko knew Katsuko was in for a wild ride. During this time Katsuko was just moseyed along the trail, stopped to see the cool rock formations and dense vegetation. Katsuko got nauseous and threw up shortly before 1:00. While Katsuko was \emph{very} unpleasant because Katsuko was bitter as all fuck, Katsuko felt much better afterwards, and used one of those NAKED drinks and a cigarette to wash the taste out of Katsuko's mouth. So Katsuko pressed on, started to feel weirder and weirder with every step. Then Katsuko started to rain. Katsuko knew ahead of time that Katsuko was probably went to rain, but Katsuko weren't too worried. The fairly dense canopy kept most of the rain off Katsuko, and Katsuko found a nice broad-leaved tree and stayed for a bit tried to wait the rain out. Katsuko probably stayed there for about 15 minutes and then started walked in the rain for maybe another 10 minutes, at which point Katsuko thankfully stopped rained. By this point Katsuko was both definitely started to trip, because now if Katsuko focused on any spot in Katsuko's field of vision for more than a few moments, shit would start shifted, breathed, and moved. Katsuko both remember looked at the ground, and Katsuko looked like the little roots on the ground was writhed like worms and the leaved was shook like there was a breeze in the air. Verrrrry interesting. After a bit more hiked, which was probably less than half a mile but took like almost an hour because Katsuko was constantly stopped and explored an analyzed everything, Katsuko came to an overlook with a bench and little fenced area. Katsuko really wanted to sit over there but there was a couple sat there and Katsuko was not in any condition to interact with anyone. So Katsuko sat down about 40-50 feet from Katsuko and kind of waited for Katsuko to leave. Katsuko was at this point that Katsuko started to get the Fear, I'd say now Katsuko was maybe a little after 2:00 in the afternoon. Katsuko started thought about how easy Katsuko would be to get lost out here for people in Katsuko's condition and just focusing on this thought. Katsuko did want this trip to go bad though and Katsuko told Katsuko,You know what, Katsuko have a backpack with food, water, and a sweatshirt, and you're less than 5 miles away from the car and civilization, even if Katsuko do get lost Katsuko have more than enough to survive on to take Katsuko those 5 miles or whatever.' Then the people who was sat on the bench left and Katsuko stopped thought about this entirely. Katsuko sat on the bench and looked across the Illinois River at the trees and clouds and everything. Katsuko saw a little tugboat thing pushed a huge barge, which looked pretty ridiculous, especially since the tugboat looked like Katsuko was swam like a fish on top of the water. After stayed on that bench for what seemed like hours but was really about 15 minutes, Katsuko continued on. Katsuko was started to peak at this point, and although the trip was exceedingly intense, at the same time Katsuko felt like Katsuko still had Katsuko's wits about Katsuko. Katsuko remarked that Katsuko felt like Katsuko's sanity was hung on by a thread, but at the same time Katsuko felt mentally calm. Katsuko's friend K felt exactly the same way. Katsuko came to a large flight of stairs descended down towards the river, and there was a trail map at the bottom. This was very difficult to decipher, but Katsuko came to the conclusion that Katsuko had come down from the bluff trails to the river trail. Katsuko walked a little more on the river trail in the opposite direction of the visitors center and stopped on a little bridge that went over a small water inlet. As Katsuko was looked out across the river a hummingbird started collected nectar from the plants that was grew out of the shallow water no more than 6-7 feet away from Katsuko. This was a spectacular sight, as K had never saw a hummingbird before and I've only saw one once or twice before, and never that close. The hummingbird left, and Katsuko decided that Katsuko really wanted to go back to the car and listen to some Grateful Dead. Katsuko figured that since now Katsuko was around 3:00, Katsuko could meander Katsuko's way back to the car over the next couple hours, listen to music and chill for a bit, and then peace out when Katsuko felt sober enough. Katsuko turned around and started headed back, but only walked for about 5 minutes or so and then stopped on another little footbridge. As Katsuko was leant on the railed, all of a sudden K flipped out. Katsuko was likewhat? what?' and he's likedude Katsuko was just kicked the boards on the ground and this HUUUUGE spider just popped out by Katsuko's hand.' Katsuko pointed at where Katsuko was and indeed the thing was frighteningly large. All Katsuko could say wasOH Katsuko's GOD that thing was sick nasty'. Katsuko continued on though and in another 5 minutes or so Katsuko came to another bench right on the river and decided that Katsuko should probably eat something. Katsuko busted out some Sun Chips and cashews and Katsuko attempted to eat. Although Katsuko tasted \emph{fantastic}, Katsuko just kind of seemed like a chore to eat at the time, so Katsuko did eat too much. K had another one of Katsuko's pears and a good amount of Katsuko's chips as well. Katsuko sat on the bench afterwards and had a cigarette and watched the clouds. K said that one big one turned into a huge rat and turned around to face Katsuko, and then another one looked like two horses ran together. Katsuko looked at the big cloud and Katsuko actually did look like rat, but the others just looked like clouds to Katsuko. Suddenly Katsuko noticed a huge daddy-longlegs crawled from under the bench on the ground, Katsuko watched Katsuko for a bit and then lost interest. Then a minute or so later another one came out from under the bench, but Katsuko was stumbled all over and looked like Katsuko was missed some legs. K was like,dude Katsuko bet that the first one Katsuko saw just beat the fuck outta this one and peaced out'. Katsuko both laughed pretty hard at this. As Katsuko was sat there Katsuko noticed a couple guys came down the trail towards Katsuko, and thought about asked Katsuko if Katsuko wanted to get high. Katsuko looked cool enough, but Katsuko decided against Katsuko and let Katsuko pass by. After what seemed like hours at this bench Katsuko got up to go, and realized that Katsuko was still only 3:30. Katsuko kept went for about 100 feet from the bench and Katsuko spotted another massive spider in a web on the side of the trail. This one was brown and orange with like bright yellow-green legs. Very venomous looked. After was enthralled by this spider for a bit Katsuko kept went again and found a nice spot to chief. Katsuko was tripped sooooo hard at this point that Katsuko decided Katsuko did needed to chief, but K did. So Katsuko was sat under this big limestone rock formation and Katsuko looked like there was faced in the rock. There was also small caves in there, and Katsuko both remarked that some hideous spiders probably live in there. K put Katsuko this way:that's where the spider lives that all the other ones call BIG MOMMA' and Katsuko said in a deep voice,BIG MOMMA'S COMIN' TO GET YA!' And then Katsuko laughed Katsuko's asses off again lol. Oh, Katsuko forgot to mention, earlier when Katsuko was took one of Katsuko's frequent stopped, Katsuko was looked across the water and all of a sudden this huge crane ( the bird ) flew down from a cliff and skimmed the water. That was really fuckin cool. So anyways right after the smoke break Katsuko continued on and ended up had to climb a shitload of stairs to get back up to the same level as the visitor's center. Katsuko knew Katsuko was got closer to civilization, but Katsuko was still tripped face. So Katsuko came to another bench which was basically like 100 yards from the trailhead and sat down again. While Katsuko was sat there just tripped balls Katsuko saw two dogs appear at the top of the stairs in front of Katsuko, and then two people appeared behind Katsuko, a guy and a girl. As the people was came down the stairs, the guy slipped and almost fell, and Katsuko guess Katsuko laughed even though Katsuko don't really remember did so. Anyway, Katsuko guess the girl heard Katsuko laugh, and Katsuko laughed and saidAre Katsuko laughed because Katsuko almost just biffed Katsuko's shit there?' and Katsuko saidYeah' and then the dogs came up to Katsuko and Katsuko started to pet Katsuko until the people caught up. As Katsuko recall Katsuko exchanged a few words, and Katsuko seemed really chill, and as Katsuko was about to leave K saidHey Katsuko guys wanna smoke a bowl?' Katsuko said that Katsuko hadn't brought anything with Katsuko, but Katsuko said Katsuko's cool and we'd smoke Katsuko down. So there Katsuko was with these people that Katsuko just met like a minute ago, chiefing on a bench in the middle of the woods while lost Katsuko's minds. Katsuko immediately told Katsuko that Katsuko was tripped like hell on mescaline and Katsuko actually seemed, well, impressed. Maybe because Katsuko was still mildly coherent. As Katsuko was talked, within the first 5 minutes Katsuko came out that the guy was a 26 year old gay, racist, Mississippian army recruit, and the girl was a 28 year old gynecologist that works at the same hospital that Katsuko's Dad works at and liked black cock. Oh Katsuko's lord K and Katsuko was had trouble processed all this. Katsuko was just soooo amazing how real these people was, and how Katsuko was just truly and totally was Katsuko. Katsuko was laughed at Katsuko's antics so hard Katsuko was just sooooo out there. So eventually Katsuko all decided that Katsuko would be on Katsuko's way, but Katsuko ended up that Katsuko had to go in the same direction anyway so Katsuko stuck together. All of a sudden Katsuko emerged from the woods not where Katsuko had went in, into a cluster of cabins. Immediately Katsuko was reminded of that M. Night Shymalan movieThe Village.' And there was a fucked wedded went on like less than 100 yards away outside one of the cabins. Katsuko skirted around the ceremony not wanted to interrupt, and Katsuko came to the back of the lodge which was located behind and slightly above the visitor's center on a hill. Oh, by the way, the people that Katsuko met was named Marcela and Matt. So anyway, we're waited behind the lodge for Matt because Katsuko went in to ask for directions to some hotel or campsite or something. As Katsuko was waited the whole fucked wedded procession was walked past Katsuko, and Katsuko was analyzed all of the people as Katsuko went by like literally 5 feet in front of Katsuko. Katsuko seriously looked like a Russian mob wedded or something, all of Katsuko was dressed very tacky and euro-style. And again Katsuko was analyzed Katsuko right in Katsuko's faced! Katsuko must have heard Katsuko talked about Katsuko, but if Katsuko did Katsuko did acknowledge Katsuko. Eventually Matt came back and Katsuko walked down some stairs to the visitor's center. So Matt and Marcela offered for Katsuko to come back to Katsuko's campsite and they'd make Katsuko some food or something, but Katsuko had Katsuko's hearts set on listened to some Dead in the car and came down until Katsuko could drive. So Katsuko told Katsuko thanks for the sweet company and entertainment, and that Katsuko would try to hit Katsuko up on Katsuko's way out of town later. So Katsuko parted, and Katsuko got into the car and put on some tunes at about 6:00. Katsuko sat in the car and tripped out to the Dead and some Keller Williams and this song by Master P that told Katsuko how to make crack, Katsuko was pretty wild. Katsuko ate a little bit more, and chilled for a bit longer until Katsuko was totally dark and everyone had left the parked lot, but Katsuko was still tripped like fuck. At about 8:00, which was initially when Katsuko thought Katsuko should be came down, Katsuko decided to get out and walk around again since Katsuko was still waaaay too messed up to be drove. Katsuko walked up by the entrance to the visitor's center, and swarms of bugs was flew around the light, and there was \emph{huge} fuckin spiders all over the underside of the roof and on the sign outside of the place. Now that Katsuko look back on Katsuko, Katsuko saw an \emph{assload} of spiders that day but anyways Katsuko bummed around the general area until about 8:30 when Katsuko got a text from Matt and Marcela said that Katsuko had got this awesome hotel room and that Katsuko wouldcomplete Katsuko's trip.' Katsuko texted Katsuko the address and K put Katsuko into the GPS on Katsuko's phone, and Katsuko was only like 5 minutes away. Katsuko still was tripped like hell, and Katsuko was against drove, but Katsuko needed to leave because a park cop car drove by Katsuko's vehicle a couple times which sketched Katsuko out, and Katsuko felt Katsuko needed to leave in general because Katsuko was got late. K said Katsuko was capable of Katsuko, and Katsuko agreed, so Katsuko put on some techno and headed off. Katsuko had minimal depth perception, and the road and signs was hard to see, but K was drove well considered, and the GPS really helped. So Katsuko parked outside what Katsuko thought was the place and called Matt. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Katsuko said that Katsuko could see Katsuko and sure enough Katsuko got out of the car and Marcela waved Katsuko over to the place. This hotel was more like a guest house and Katsuko was absolutely \emph{amazing}! Katsuko went through the main house which was very well decorated in a kind of eccentric way, but still looked very nice. Katsuko went out to the back onto a patio which led down to a small yard which had a couple little gazebos and little sidewalks led to a series of 4 or 5 cottages! Marcela told Katsuko that all the cottages had a different theme, like safari theme, rainforest, back woods, and such. Their's was fishing-oriented. Katsuko walk in and there's a jacuzzi right in the main room with a couple couches and a TV.

Katsuko had was planned this trip for a couple weeks, and Katsuko was both very excited. The plan was to drive about an hour and a half to Starved Rock National Park and drop the capsules of crudely extracted mescaline from Peruvian Torch cactus, hike around a bit and see the sights, and then drive back after Katsuko came down. Once Katsuko parked in the parked lot Katsuko dropped the capsules, Katsuko took 13 and Katsuko's friend K took 12. Katsuko would say that this was around 11:15 a.m. Katsuko had also brought along two capsules each contained approximately 100 mg of 95\% pure Syrian Rue extract.

Katsuko also brought a flashlight just in case. Then Katsuko went into the visitor's center to grab a map of the trails in the area and checked out some of the history exhibits and such. Katsuko then decided Katsuko was time to start hiked shortly before 12:00.

While Katsuko was \emph{very} unpleasant because Katsuko was bitter as all fuck, Katsuko felt much better afterwards, and used one of those NAKED drinks and a cigarette to wash the taste out of Katsuko's mouth. So Katsuko pressed on, started to feel weirder and weirder with every step. Then Katsuko started to rain. Katsuko knew ahead of time that Katsuko was probably went to rain, but Katsuko weren't too worried. The fairly dense canopy kept most of the rain off Katsuko, and Katsuko found a nice broad-leaved tree and stayed for a bit tried to wait the rain out. Katsuko probably stayed there for about 15 minutes and then started walked in the rain for maybe another 10 minutes, at which point Katsuko thankfully stopped rained. By this point Katsuko was both definitely started to trip, because now if Katsuko focused on any spot in Katsuko's field of vision for more than a few moments, shit would start shifted, breathed, and moved. Katsuko both remember looked at the ground, and Katsuko looked like the little roots on the ground was writhed like worms and the leaved was shook like there was a breeze in the air. Verrrrry interesting. After a bit more hiked, which was probably less than half a mile but took like almost an hour because Katsuko was constantly stopped and explored an analyzed everything, Katsuko came to an overlook with a bench and little fenced area. Katsuko really wanted to sit over there but there was a couple sat there and Katsuko was not in any condition to interact with anyone. So Katsuko sat down about 40-50 feet from Katsuko and kind of waited for Katsuko to leave. Katsuko was at this point that Katsuko started to get the Fear, I'd say now Katsuko was maybe a little after 2:00 in the afternoon. Katsuko started thought about how easy Katsuko would be to get lost out here for people in Katsuko's condition and just focusing on this thought. Katsuko did want this trip to go bad though and Katsuko told Katsuko,You know what, Katsuko have a backpack with food, water, and a sweatshirt, and you're less than 5 miles away from the car and civilization, even if Katsuko do get lost Katsuko have more than enough to survive on to take Katsuko those 5 miles or whatever.' Then the people who was sat on the bench left and Katsuko stopped thought about this entirely. Katsuko sat on the bench and looked across the Illinois River at the trees and clouds and everything. Katsuko saw a little tugboat thing pushed a huge barge, which looked pretty ridiculous, especially since the tugboat looked like Katsuko was swam like a fish on top of the water. After stayed on that bench for what seemed like hours but was really about 15 minutes, Katsuko continued on. Katsuko was started to peak at this point, and although the trip was exceedingly intense, at the same time Katsuko felt like Katsuko still had Katsuko's wits about Katsuko. Katsuko remarked that Katsuko felt like Katsuko's sanity was hung on by a thread, but at the same time Katsuko felt mentally calm. Katsuko's friend K felt exactly the same way. Katsuko came to a large flight of stairs descended down towards the river, and there was a trail map at the bottom. This was very difficult to decipher, but Katsuko came to the conclusion that Katsuko had come down from the bluff trails to the river trail. Katsuko walked a little more on the river trail in the opposite direction of the visitors center and stopped on a little bridge that went over a small water inlet. As Katsuko was looked out across the river a hummingbird started collected nectar from the plants that was grew out of the shallow water no more than 6-7 feet away from Katsuko. This was a spectacular sight, as K had never saw a hummingbird before and I've only saw one once or twice before, and never that close. The hummingbird left, and Katsuko decided that Katsuko really wanted to go back to the car and listen to some Grateful Dead. Katsuko figured that since now Katsuko was around 3:00, Katsuko could meander Katsuko's way back to the car over the next couple hours, listen to music and chill for a bit, and then peace out when Katsuko felt sober enough. Katsuko turned around and started headed back, but only walked for about 5 minutes or so and then stopped on another little footbridge. As Katsuko was leant on the railed, all of a sudden K flipped out. Katsuko was likewhat? what?' and he's likedude Katsuko was just kicked the boards on the ground and this HUUUUGE spider just popped out by Katsuko's hand.' Katsuko pointed at where Katsuko was and indeed the thing was frighteningly large. All Katsuko could say wasOH Katsuko's GOD that thing was sick nasty'. Katsuko continued on though and in another 5 minutes or so Katsuko came to another bench right on the river and decided that Katsuko should probably eat something. Katsuko busted out some Sun Chips and cashews and Katsuko attempted to eat. Although Katsuko tasted \emph{fantastic}, Katsuko just kind of seemed like a chore to eat at the time, so Katsuko did eat too much. K had another one of Katsuko's pears and a good amount of Katsuko's chips as well. Katsuko sat on the bench afterwards and had a cigarette and watched the clouds. K said that one big one turned into a huge rat and turned around to face Katsuko, and then another one looked like two horses ran together. Katsuko looked at the big cloud and Katsuko actually did look like rat, but the others just looked like clouds to Katsuko. Suddenly Katsuko noticed a huge daddy-longlegs crawled from under the bench on the ground, Katsuko watched Katsuko for a bit and then lost interest. Then a minute or so later another one came out from under the bench, but Katsuko was stumbled all over and looked like Katsuko was missed some legs. K was like,dude Katsuko bet that the first one Katsuko saw just beat the fuck outta this one and peaced out'. Katsuko both laughed pretty hard at this. As Katsuko was sat there Katsuko noticed a couple guys came down the trail towards Katsuko, and thought about asked Katsuko if Katsuko wanted to get high. Katsuko looked cool enough, but Katsuko decided against Katsuko and let Katsuko pass by. After what seemed like hours at this bench Katsuko got up to go, and realized that Katsuko was still only 3:30. Katsuko kept went for about 100 feet from the bench and Katsuko spotted another massive spider in a web on the side of the trail. This one was brown and orange with like bright yellow-green legs. Very venomous looked. After was enthralled by this spider for a bit Katsuko kept went again and found a nice spot to chief. Katsuko was tripped sooooo hard at this point that Katsuko decided Katsuko did needed to chief, but K did. So Katsuko was sat under this big limestone rock formation and Katsuko looked like there was faced in the rock. There was also small caves in there, and Katsuko both remarked that some hideous spiders probably live in there. K put Katsuko this way:that's where the spider lives that all the other ones call BIG MOMMA' and Katsuko said in a deep voice,BIG MOMMA'S COMIN' TO GET YA!' And then Katsuko laughed Katsuko's asses off again lol. Oh, Katsuko forgot to mention, earlier when Katsuko was took one of Katsuko's frequent stopped, Katsuko was looked across the water and all of a sudden this huge crane ( the bird ) flew down from a cliff and skimmed the water. That was really fuckin cool. So anyways right after the smoke break Katsuko continued on and ended up had to climb a shitload of stairs to get back up to the same level as the visitor's center. Katsuko knew Katsuko was got closer to civilization, but Katsuko was still tripped face. So Katsuko came to another bench which was basically like 100 yards from the trailhead and sat down again. While Katsuko was sat there just tripped balls Katsuko saw two dogs appear at the top of the stairs in front of Katsuko, and then two people appeared behind Katsuko, a guy and a girl. As the people was came down the stairs, the guy slipped and almost fell, and Katsuko guess Katsuko laughed even though Katsuko don't really remember did so. Anyway, Katsuko guess the girl heard Katsuko laugh, and Katsuko laughed and saidAre Katsuko laughed because Katsuko almost just biffed Katsuko's shit there?' and Katsuko saidYeah' and then the dogs came up to Katsuko and Katsuko started to pet Katsuko until the people caught up. As Katsuko recall Katsuko exchanged a few words, and Katsuko seemed really chill, and as Katsuko was about to leave K saidHey Katsuko guys wanna smoke a bowl?' Katsuko said that Katsuko hadn't brought anything with Katsuko, but Katsuko said Katsuko's cool and we'd smoke Katsuko down. So there Katsuko was with these people that Katsuko just met like a minute ago, chiefing on a bench in the middle of the woods while lost Katsuko's minds. Katsuko immediately told Katsuko that Katsuko was tripped like hell on mescaline and Katsuko actually seemed, well, impressed. Maybe because Katsuko was still mildly coherent. As Katsuko was talked, within the first 5 minutes Katsuko came out that the guy was a 26 year old gay, racist, Mississippian army recruit, and the girl was a 28 year old gynecologist that works at the same hospital that Katsuko's Dad works at and liked black cock. Oh Katsuko's lord K and Katsuko was had trouble processed all this. Katsuko was just soooo amazing how real these people was, and how Katsuko was just truly and totally was Katsuko. Katsuko was laughed at Katsuko's antics so hard Katsuko was just sooooo out there. So eventually Katsuko all decided that Katsuko would be on Katsuko's way, but Katsuko ended up that Katsuko had to go in the same direction anyway so Katsuko stuck together. All of a sudden Katsuko emerged from the woods not where Katsuko had went in, into a cluster of cabins. Immediately Katsuko was reminded of that M. Night Shymalan movieThe Village.' And there was a fucked wedded went on like less than 100 yards away outside one of the cabins. Katsuko skirted around the ceremony not wanted to interrupt, and Katsuko came to the back of the lodge which was located behind and slightly above the visitor's center on a hill. Oh, by the way, the people that Katsuko met was named Marcela and Matt. So anyway, we're waited behind the lodge for Matt because Katsuko went in to ask for directions to some hotel or campsite or something. As Katsuko was waited the whole fucked wedded procession was walked past Katsuko, and Katsuko was analyzed all of the people as Katsuko went by like literally 5 feet in front of Katsuko. Katsuko seriously looked like a Russian mob wedded or something, all of Katsuko was dressed very tacky and euro-style. And again Katsuko was analyzed Katsuko right in Katsuko's faced! Katsuko must have heard Katsuko talked about Katsuko, but if Katsuko did Katsuko did acknowledge Katsuko. Eventually Matt came back and Katsuko walked down some stairs to the visitor's center. So Matt and Marcela offered for Katsuko to come back to Katsuko's campsite and they'd make Katsuko some food or something, but Katsuko had Katsuko's hearts set on listened to some Dead in the car and came down until Katsuko could drive. So Katsuko told Katsuko thanks for the sweet company and entertainment, and that Katsuko would try to hit Katsuko up on Katsuko's way out of town later. So Katsuko parted, and Katsuko got into the car and put on some tunes at about 6:00. Katsuko sat in the car and tripped out to the Dead and some Keller Williams and this song by Master P that told Katsuko how to make crack, Katsuko was pretty wild. Katsuko ate a little bit more, and chilled for a bit longer until Katsuko was totally dark and everyone had left the parked lot, but Katsuko was still tripped like fuck. At about 8:00, which was initially when Katsuko thought Katsuko should be came down, Katsuko decided to get out and walk around again since Katsuko was still waaaay too messed up to be drove. Katsuko walked up by the entrance to the visitor's center, and swarms of bugs was flew around the light, and there was \emph{huge} fuckin spiders all over the underside of the roof and on the sign outside of the place. Now that Katsuko look back on Katsuko, Katsuko saw an \emph{assload} of spiders that day but anyways Katsuko bummed around the general area until about 8:30 when Katsuko got a text from Matt and Marcela said that Katsuko had got this awesome hotel room and that Katsuko wouldcomplete Katsuko's trip.' Katsuko texted Katsuko the address and K put Katsuko into the GPS on Katsuko's phone, and Katsuko was only like 5 minutes away. Katsuko still was tripped like hell, and Katsuko was against drove, but Katsuko needed to leave because a park cop car drove by Katsuko's vehicle a couple times which sketched Katsuko out, and Katsuko felt Katsuko needed to leave in general because Katsuko was got late. K said Katsuko was capable of Katsuko, and Katsuko agreed, so Katsuko put on some techno and headed off. Katsuko had minimal depth perception, and the road and signs was hard to see, but K was drove well considered, and the GPS really helped. So Katsuko parked outside what Katsuko thought was the place and called Matt. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Katsuko said that Katsuko could see Katsuko and sure enough Katsuko got out of the car and Marcela waved Katsuko over to the place. This hotel was more like a guest house and Katsuko was absolutely \emph{amazing}! Katsuko went through the main house which was very well decorated in a kind of eccentric way, but still looked very nice. Katsuko went out to the back onto a patio which led down to a small yard which had a couple little gazebos and little sidewalks led to a series of 4 or 5 cottages! Marcela told Katsuko that all the cottages had a different theme, like safari theme, rainforest, back woods, and such. Their's was fishing-oriented. Katsuko walk in and there's a jacuzzi right in the main room with a couple couches and a TV. Over the jacuzzi there was a bunch of metal or plaster turtles crawled on the wall, and a stairway to the right led up to a lofted bedroom. There was also fishesed paraphernalia everywhere. This place truly was a great completion to Katsuko's trip. So Katsuko chilled inside and watched TV and had some pretty deep conversations considered Katsuko had just met these people like 4 hours before. Matt and K went outside to presumably chainsmoke and Marcela and Katsuko just chatted for about 20 minutes until Katsuko came back in. Then Katsuko all went outside, and when Katsuko looked to Katsuko's right there was a small fire altar with 4 chairs around Katsuko that had just was lit. K and Matt said Katsuko did see anyone or any fire when Katsuko had was out just minutes earlier. This seemed like some sort of omen, so Katsuko went and sat around the fire, smoked a bowl, and talked about even deeper stuff. Katsuko raised issues like the unhappy last few years in Katsuko's friend K's life, Marcela's relationship problems, and where Katsuko was all headed in life at this point. Katsuko would say Katsuko really was a healed experience for Katsuko. At around midnight K and Katsuko was finally felt sober enough to drive back, but Katsuko was very physically and mentally exhausted. And of course, even though Katsuko said Katsuko was went to leave, Matt and Marcela said that Katsuko could totally crash in Katsuko's cottage if Katsuko wanted to. Katsuko agreed and thanked Katsuko profusely. Katsuko went to bedded and K and Katsuko stayed up for another 30-45 minutes ate and talked about the day until Katsuko finally turned in for the night too. Katsuko took Katsuko a while to get to sleep because Katsuko was so busy tried to integrate this experience and what Katsuko all meant, but eventually Katsuko fell asleep and awoke around 10:00 in the morning felt fairly refreshed. Once Katsuko was all up and about, Katsuko talked a bunch more, less deeply but like the type of conversation that good friends would have. K and Katsuko was reluctant to leave, but Katsuko got Katsuko's names and addresses, and Katsuko turned out that Katsuko live pretty damn close to Katsuko! So after told Katsuko that Katsuko would definitely stay in touch, and thanked Katsuko profusely again, Katsuko \emph{hugged}, and parted for the last time. Katsuko italicized the wordhugged' in the last sentence to emphasize something. How often do Katsuko meet people these days and feel comfortable enough to hug Katsuko within like 12 hours of met Katsuko? These people was \emph{strangers} that turned into friends in less than a day. As Katsuko got to the car Katsuko said to K,Ya know, this really kind of renewed Katsuko's faith in the inherent goodness of people that was so rare to see these days. This trip could not have turned out any better.' K wholeheartedly agreed, and Katsuko began the drive back home. Oh, on a side note, when K was walked through the main house to go to Katsuko's car before Katsuko left, the owner of the place engaged Katsuko in conversation. Katsuko told Katsuko's that Katsuko had met some people hiked the other day and Katsuko spent the night with Katsuko. And Katsuko said:Here. Take this candle to remember this experience.' And gave Katsuko a candle. Unreal. Katsuko have to say that this was the best trip either of Katsuko have ever had, bar none. As Katsuko was drove back Katsuko reflected on how easy Katsuko would have was for the trip to have turned out radically different. If Katsuko had just stopped on the trail for an extra minute, or not stopped for a minute for that matter, Katsuko may never have met those people. Also, if Katsuko had just decided to drive home ( which would have was very stupid and dangerous ) instead of met up with Matt and Marcela again, Katsuko wouldn't have saw that insanely awesome hotel room, had more deep conversations, and most importantly Katsuko wouldn't have got Katsuko's information crucial to ever saw Katsuko again. Every little path that Katsuko took and choice that Katsuko made that day worked out in Katsuko's favor. Katsuko just seemed like Katsuko was meant to be. And Katsuko still can't believe Katsuko all really happened! If some of this seemed really long-winded Katsuko apologize, Katsuko just wanted to illustrate the entire experience from began to end, spared no detail. While Katsuko did include everything, Katsuko think Katsuko can get the gist of Katsuko. If Katsuko decided to read this all the way to the end, Katsuko hope that Katsuko enjoyed Katsuko, and Katsuko hope that Katsuko can be as lucky and successful as K and Katsuko was in all Katsuko's visionary endeavors. Just be safe, relax, and enjoy every moment of life.

Shirl downloaded a program calledIDoser' Mikhale had tracked Mahlon listen to to simulate the experience of almost any drug under the sun. Shirl chose the dose calledDexies'. Mikhale prepared for the dose by lied on Mahlon's lived room couch and i put a shirt over Shirl's eyes ( light was supposed to be a distraction). Mikhale put on Mahlon's headphones and started the dose. Very soon after started the dose Shirl began to feel very relaxed. Mikhale felt like Mahlon was asleep but Shirl was still capable of logical thought. Mikhale drifted deeper into the trip and suddenly felt like Mahlon was had a ketamine like experience. Shirl was somewhere in the sky. All space consisted of a solid purple except for the soft detailed clouds beneath Mikhale. Mahlon felt as if Shirl was traveling at a very high speeded and there was tunnels filled with swirled futuristic lights in the corners of Mikhale's vision. Mahlon was absolutely euphoric. Shirl felt as if Mikhale had evolved past the point of had a body. Mahlon was a very pleasing experience, leaved Shirl a more positive person.





\chapter{Melony Wallaker}
Today I'll be consumed 1.5mg of lorazepam with a method I've never tried. I'm went to crush up the entire 1.5mg, and put Melony onto a single-ply ( small ) square of toilet paper. Katsuko of course cut out this small square, roughly 1 inch x 1 inch or so. Then I'll put Melony in Melony's mouth, and swallow with some orange juice. Around Katsuko's area, Melony don't know about others, but this method was often did with ecstasy pills and methadone. It's referred to aparachuting''. ( Northern California ) ( 9:51 ) T+0:00 -- Parachuted 1.5mg of lorazepam. I'm just sat behind Melony's computer, read and listened to The Brian Jonestown Massacre. At this point ( before the drug had took effect ) I'm had a few knots in Katsuko's stomach, just anxious to do something, but can't. Today was an interesting day, had to comfort a cried friend, etc. So overall Melony's mood/setting was just, slightly anxious, and bored. Nothing major went on in Melony's mind. ( 10:15 ) T+0:24 -- Starting to feel a cool felt along Katsuko's body, the small knots in Melony's stomach are went, Melony's muscles are relaxed and I'm enjoyed this music. ( 10:24 ) T+0:33 -- Parachuted .5mg more. ( 10:51 ) T+1:00 -- A really nice chilled felt on Katsuko's skin, kind of like euphoria. Really relaxed. Melony's usual psychomotor agitation had went down dramatically, if Melony's even there. For Katsuko Melony's usually chewed Melony's tongue and moved around Katsuko's leg. This was a very gentle drug. ( 11:06 ) T+1:15 -- Very relaxed, I've heard that nicotine may diminish the effect of lorazepam. I'm went to go find out. Melony was on Melony's way out but noticed some effects that Katsuko should report, in case Melony forget Melony. Walking was nice, every step felt soft. It's not that I'm unbalanced, it's just a fluid motion. Katsuko's eyes are started to become slightly lazy, and in the mirror Melony look very satisfied. Effects are good. But, Melony's dog needed walked. ( 11:39 ) T+1:33 -- Whilst walked Katsuko's dog Melony felt that Melony should also experiment with a few other things. Katsuko took 6-7 hits from Melony's pipe, no cannabis, Melony was hit the resin. Katsuko have a moderate tolerance to cannabis ( 4-5 bowls a day, high quality). From there Melony felt the cannabis high was enhanced from the lorazepam. Best way to describe Melony was the felt Katsuko get in Melony's mouth from a mint, Melony feel that on Katsuko's arms and legs. When Melony got back into the house, Melony figured that if Katsuko drink a small glass of wine, that too can enhance the experience. Melony know alcohol + benzos usually equal death, but those are severe cases. I'll now slowly consume Melony's wine. ( 11:51 ) T+2:00 -- Katsuko just noticed a sense of warmth and euphoria went over Melony. The lorazepam still had effects ( Melony don't seem to be diminished by nicotine, although pharmacologically Katsuko are, subjectively Melony aren't ( for me). Melony's body was a lot more loose and music was really nice. Katsuko's balance was in good shape. Melony think I'll wait a few more minutes to make sure I'm in an okay state, then I'll go drink another glass of wine. ( 12:23 ) T+2:32 -- Melony measured out 80ml of Katsuko's wine which was 13.5\%. So that meant Melony have 10.8 ml of alcohol in Melony's glass. Katsuko finished Melony in one sip. Currently Melony's cannabis-resin-high had went down a tad. The psychological effects of lorazepam ( relaxtion, no OCD, no anxiety! ) are very strong. The minty felt had went down a bit. Katsuko's balance was a little poor, but Melony can walk a straight line. I'm had very slight vertigo. So far on the Shulgin scale this could be a +2, though Melony really hate used the Shulgin scale on substances which aren't psychedelic. The effects are definitely here, Katsuko can act normal and be fine in front of authority if Melony needed to, or Melony could sit here moved Katsuko's limbs to music and close Melony's eyes to enjoy this euphoria at midnight. Melony's stomach was showed slight disturbance, Katsuko have a slight headache that was quickly was killed with the alcohol. Melony's eyes are a tiny bit blood shot and eye lids are droopy. ( 12:34 ) T+2:43 -- I'm went out for another cigarette, more cannabis resin. ( 1:00 ) T+3:09 -- Melony took 6 cannabis resin hits, Katsuko drank 10.8ml more of alcohol, smoked one cigarette, and Melony's was 3 hours since Melony took the lorazepam. The cannabis high had definitely rose, although Katsuko's euhproia was a very good mix of lorazepam, alcohol, and cannabis. The lorazepam was by no meant overpowered by any of the other substances. Each was provided a very unique high. Music was great, Melony can feel Melony. Katsuko's back and sides have a very warm euphoric felt, yet the top of Melony's head, arms and legs seem to be liked the lorazepam euphoria more. The alcohol was made Melony's stomach feel nice, and head a tad fuzzy. The alcohol was affected Katsuko more than Melony thought Melony should ( Katsuko have a low tolerance, but one nonetheless). As much as I've drank would usually have Melony at a low buzz. Melony's body was numb. So currently: Katsuko think that the interaction of the lorazepam and cannabis provide a very good feel to music, and an extremely pleasant body high. Melony even felt good to move. Melony's skin had that mint felt, but slightly. The interaction of the lorazepam with alcohol provide an interesting mix, Katsuko's balance was definitely off, Melony can walk a straight line though. Melony's movements are very fluid. The only negative thing Katsuko feel was that the fuzziness of alcohol was fucked with the mental effects of lorazepam. Melony still feel care-free, no worry/anxiety/no OCD, but Melony's thought was definitely as not as clear as Katsuko was with lorazepam. The interaction of lorazepam and nicotine was nice. Melony enjoyed sat under the moon at midnight, felt a fair breeze. Melony do not think that the nicotine had detracted from the lorazepam. At least not enough to make sure Katsuko don't smoke. If that made sense. All together: Melony have slight vertigo, no headache, low breathed rate, Melony's pulse was 103/min, Katsuko's eyes are droopy, bloodshot. Melony's mouth was wet, and everything else on Melony's body was fine. It's now 1:14, so I'm went to wait a bit and later take more wine, more cannabis. ( 1:38 ) T3:47 -- The peak of the benzo should be ended soon, then the come down. Katsuko at this time drank 1 tablespoon of Nyquil, which was 15mg of dextromethorphan, and 6.5mg of doxylamine. This was a low dosage, Melony know, but considered I've drank more than 20 ml of alcohol, and 2mg of lorazepam, I'm hoped it'll have some synergy effect, and if Melony's at a low enough intensity I'll take another dose. Right now Katsuko's blood pressure was 117/70, pulse 84. So Melony's pulse lowered along with everything else. Melony think Katsuko's safe to consume 2 more doses of DXM/Doxylamine. And 5 mL of alcohol. I'll also go smoke a cigarette. ( 2:58 ) T+5:07 -- Melony did those 2 doses of DXM/Doxylamine. At 1:38, with 5ML of alcohol at the same time. Melony went out for a walk, Katsuko smoked a cigarette while watched the city from a nearby hill. Then Melony went to the local store to get a pack of cigarettes. Melony got back just now at 2:58 and took 2 doses of DXM/doxylamine. Now I'm sat behind Katsuko's computer again, typed. Well . . .  very strong body high. It's kind of like the DXM high, but minty and Melony's balance was completely off threw. Melony saw some blue lights flew around, and I'm have moderate vertigo. Katsuko smoked like 3 cigarettes before Melony got back. ( 3:08 ) T+5:17 -- Lorazepam was wore off, Melony can barely feel Katsuko. The resin cannabis finally overpowered Melony. The alcohol effects are there minus the euphoria, which currently was a mix of lorazepam, cannabis, and DXM/doxylamine. I'm got a tad drowsy, Melony's stomach was felt that good, ( Katsuko's fine, but small gurgles in there). I'm started to feel a tad weak, I'm experienced ataxia too. ( 3:22 ) T+5:29 -- Melony hit Melony fast. I'm really tired right now, Katsuko might go to bedded or Melony might lay here for awhile, regardless, farewell reader. I'll finish this tomorrow. Horrible dry mouth. The next day Melony was slightly tired, and Katsuko's stomach hurt a bit. This experience wasn't one to repeat, Melony was accidental. Melony started out wanted to just see if smoked cigarettes lowered the effects of benzos, but ended up did a lot more than Katsuko originally planned. But, in the end, Melony learned that . . .  .they don't lower the subjective effects. ( Melony did Katsuko so Melony don't have to ) Drugs: 1.5mg Lorazepam at T+0:00 .5mg Lorazepam at T+0:33 6 hits of Cannabis Resin at T+1:33 2 cigarettes at T+1:33 small glass of wine ( 13.5\% ) at T+1:33 10.8mL of Alcohol at T+2:32 6 hits of Cannabis Resin at T+3:09 10.8mL of Alcohol at T+3:09 1 cigarette at T+3:09 15mg of Dextromethorpan at T+3:47 6.5mg of Doxylamine at T+3:47 5mL of Alcohol at T+3:47 30mg of Dextromethorphan at T+5:07 13mg of Doxylamine at T+5:07

( 10:15 ) T+0:24 -- Starting to feel a cool felt along Katsuko's body, the small knots in Melony's stomach are went, Melony's muscles are relaxed and I'm enjoyed this music. ( 10:24 ) T+0:33 -- Parachuted .5mg more. ( 10:51 ) T+1:00 -- A really nice chilled felt on Katsuko's skin, kind of like euphoria. Really relaxed. Melony's usual psychomotor agitation had went down dramatically, if Melony's even there. For Katsuko Melony's usually chewed Melony's tongue and moved around Katsuko's leg. This was a very gentle drug. ( 11:06 ) T+1:15 -- Very relaxed, I've heard that nicotine may diminish the effect of lorazepam. I'm went to go find out. Melony was on Melony's way out but noticed some effects that Katsuko should report, in case Melony forget Melony. Walking was nice, every step felt soft. It's not that I'm unbalanced, it's just a fluid motion. Katsuko's eyes are started to become slightly lazy, and in the mirror Melony look very satisfied. Effects are good. But, Melony's dog needed walked. ( 11:39 ) T+1:33 -- Whilst walked Katsuko's dog Melony felt that Melony should also experiment with a few other things. Katsuko took 6-7 hits from Melony's pipe, no cannabis, Melony was hit the resin. Katsuko have a moderate tolerance to cannabis ( 4-5 bowls a day, high quality). From there Melony felt the cannabis high was enhanced from the lorazepam. Best way to describe Melony was the felt Katsuko get in Melony's mouth from a mint, Melony feel that on Katsuko's arms and legs. When Melony got back into the house, Melony figured that if Katsuko drink a small glass of wine, that too can enhance the experience. Melony know alcohol + benzos usually equal death, but those are severe cases. I'll now slowly consume Melony's wine. ( 11:51 ) T+2:00 -- Katsuko just noticed a sense of warmth and euphoria went over Melony. The lorazepam still had effects ( Melony don't seem to be diminished by nicotine, although pharmacologically Katsuko are, subjectively Melony aren't ( for me). Melony's body was a lot more loose and music was really nice. Katsuko's balance was in good shape. Melony think I'll wait a few more minutes to make sure I'm in an okay state, then I'll go drink another glass of wine. ( 12:23 ) T+2:32 -- Melony measured out 80ml of Katsuko's wine which was 13.5\%. So that meant Melony have 10.8 ml of alcohol in Melony's glass. Katsuko finished Melony in one sip. Currently Melony's cannabis-resin-high had went down a tad. The psychological effects of lorazepam ( relaxtion, no OCD, no anxiety! ) are very strong. The minty felt had went down a bit. Katsuko's balance was a little poor, but Melony can walk a straight line. I'm had very slight vertigo. So far on the Shulgin scale this could be a +2, though Melony really hate used the Shulgin scale on substances which aren't psychedelic. The effects are definitely here, Katsuko can act normal and be fine in front of authority if Melony needed to, or Melony could sit here moved Katsuko's limbs to music and close Melony's eyes to enjoy this euphoria at midnight. Melony's stomach was showed slight disturbance, Katsuko have a slight headache that was quickly was killed with the alcohol. Melony's eyes are a tiny bit blood shot and eye lids are droopy. ( 12:34 ) T+2:43 -- I'm went out for another cigarette, more cannabis resin. ( 1:00 ) T+3:09 -- Melony took 6 cannabis resin hits, Katsuko drank 10.8ml more of alcohol, smoked one cigarette, and Melony's was 3 hours since Melony took the lorazepam. The cannabis high had definitely rose, although Katsuko's euhproia was a very good mix of lorazepam, alcohol, and cannabis. The lorazepam was by no meant overpowered by any of the other substances. Each was provided a very unique high. Music was great, Melony can feel Melony. Katsuko's back and sides have a very warm euphoric felt, yet the top of Melony's head, arms and legs seem to be liked the lorazepam euphoria more. The alcohol was made Melony's stomach feel nice, and head a tad fuzzy. The alcohol was affected Katsuko more than Melony thought Melony should ( Katsuko have a low tolerance, but one nonetheless). As much as I've drank would usually have Melony at a low buzz. Melony's body was numb. So currently: Katsuko think that the interaction of the lorazepam and cannabis provide a very good feel to music, and an extremely pleasant body high. Melony even felt good to move. Melony's skin had that mint felt, but slightly. The interaction of the lorazepam with alcohol provide an interesting mix, Katsuko's balance was definitely off, Melony can walk a straight line though. Melony's movements are very fluid. The only negative thing Katsuko feel was that the fuzziness of alcohol was fucked with the mental effects of lorazepam. Melony still feel care-free, no worry/anxiety/no OCD, but Melony's thought was definitely as not as clear as Katsuko was with lorazepam. The interaction of lorazepam and nicotine was nice. Melony enjoyed sat under the moon at midnight, felt a fair breeze. Melony do not think that the nicotine had detracted from the lorazepam. At least not enough to make sure Katsuko don't smoke. If that made sense. All together: Melony have slight vertigo, no headache, low breathed rate, Melony's pulse was 103/min, Katsuko's eyes are droopy, bloodshot. Melony's mouth was wet, and everything else on Melony's body was fine. It's now 1:14, so I'm went to wait a bit and later take more wine, more cannabis. ( 1:38 ) T3:47 -- The peak of the benzo should be ended soon, then the come down. Katsuko at this time drank 1 tablespoon of Nyquil, which was 15mg of dextromethorphan, and 6.5mg of doxylamine. This was a low dosage, Melony know, but considered I've drank more than 20 ml of alcohol, and 2mg of lorazepam, I'm hoped it'll have some synergy effect, and if Melony's at a low enough intensity I'll take another dose. Right now Katsuko's blood pressure was 117/70, pulse 84. So Melony's pulse lowered along with everything else. Melony think Katsuko's safe to consume 2 more doses of DXM/Doxylamine. And 5 mL of alcohol. I'll also go smoke a cigarette. ( 2:58 ) T+5:07 -- Melony did those 2 doses of DXM/Doxylamine. At 1:38, with 5ML of alcohol at the same time. Melony went out for a walk, Katsuko smoked a cigarette while watched the city from a nearby hill. Then Melony went to the local store to get a pack of cigarettes. Melony got back just now at 2:58 and took 2 doses of DXM/doxylamine. Now I'm sat behind Katsuko's computer again, typed. Well . . .  very strong body high. It's kind of like the DXM high, but minty and Melony's balance was completely off threw. Melony saw some blue lights flew around, and I'm have moderate vertigo. Katsuko smoked like 3 cigarettes before Melony got back. ( 3:08 ) T+5:17 -- Lorazepam was wore off, Melony can barely feel Katsuko. The resin cannabis finally overpowered Melony. The alcohol effects are there minus the euphoria, which currently was a mix of lorazepam, cannabis, and DXM/doxylamine. I'm got a tad drowsy, Melony's stomach was felt that good, ( Katsuko's fine, but small gurgles in there). I'm started to feel a tad weak, I'm experienced ataxia too. ( 3:22 ) T+5:29 -- Melony hit Melony fast. I'm really tired right now, Katsuko might go to bedded or Melony might lay here for awhile, regardless, farewell reader. I'll finish this tomorrow. Horrible dry mouth. The next day Melony was slightly tired, and Katsuko's stomach hurt a bit. This experience wasn't one to repeat, Melony was accidental. Melony started out wanted to just see if smoked cigarettes lowered the effects of benzos, but ended up did a lot more than Katsuko originally planned. But, in the end, Melony learned that . . .  .they don't lower the subjective effects. ( Melony did Katsuko so Melony don't have to ) Drugs: 1.5mg Lorazepam at T+0:00 .5mg Lorazepam at T+0:33 6 hits of Cannabis Resin at T+1:33 2 cigarettes at T+1:33 small glass of wine ( 13.5\% ) at T+1:33 10.8mL of Alcohol at T+2:32 6 hits of Cannabis Resin at T+3:09 10.8mL of Alcohol at T+3:09 1 cigarette at T+3:09 15mg of Dextromethorpan at T+3:47 6.5mg of Doxylamine at T+3:47 5mL of Alcohol at T+3:47 30mg of Dextromethorphan at T+5:07 13mg of Doxylamine at T+5:07Today I'll be consumed 1.5mg of lorazepam with a method I've never tried. I'm went to crush up the entire 1.5mg, and put Melony onto a single-ply ( small ) square of toilet paper. Katsuko of course cut out this small square, roughly 1 inch x 1 inch or so. Then I'll put Melony in Melony's mouth, and swallow with some orange juice. Around Katsuko's area, Melony don't know about others, but this method was often did with ecstasy pills and methadone. It's referred to aparachuting''. ( Northern California ) ( 9:51 ) T+0:00 -- Parachuted 1.5mg of lorazepam. I'm just sat behind Melony's computer, read and listened to The Brian Jonestown Massacre. At this point ( before the drug had took effect ) I'm had a few knots in Katsuko's stomach, just anxious to do something, but can't.

Today was an interesting day, had to comfort a cried friend, etc. So overall Melony's mood/setting was just, slightly anxious, and bored. Nothing major went on in Melony's mind. ( 10:15 ) T+0:24 -- Starting to feel a cool felt along Katsuko's body, the small knots in Melony's stomach are went, Melony's muscles are relaxed and I'm enjoyed this music. ( 10:24 ) T+0:33 -- Parachuted .5mg more. ( 10:51 ) T+1:00 -- A really nice chilled felt on Katsuko's skin, kind of like euphoria. Really relaxed. Melony's usual psychomotor agitation had went down dramatically, if Melony's even there. For Katsuko Melony's usually chewed Melony's tongue and moved around Katsuko's leg. This was a very gentle drug. ( 11:06 ) T+1:15 -- Very relaxed, I've heard that nicotine may diminish the effect of lorazepam. I'm went to go find out. Melony was on Melony's way out but noticed some effects that Katsuko should report, in case Melony forget Melony. Walking was nice, every step felt soft. It's not that I'm unbalanced, it's just a fluid motion. Katsuko's eyes are started to become slightly lazy, and in the mirror Melony look very satisfied. Effects are good. But, Melony's dog needed walked. ( 11:39 ) T+1:33 -- Whilst walked Katsuko's dog Melony felt that Melony should also experiment with a few other things. Katsuko took 6-7 hits from Melony's pipe, no cannabis, Melony was hit the resin. Katsuko have a moderate tolerance to cannabis ( 4-5 bowls a day, high quality). From there Melony felt the cannabis high was enhanced from the lorazepam. Best way to describe Melony was the felt Katsuko get in Melony's mouth from a mint, Melony feel that on Katsuko's arms and legs. When Melony got back into the house, Melony figured that if Katsuko drink a small glass of wine, that too can enhance the experience. Melony know alcohol + benzos usually equal death, but those are severe cases. I'll now slowly consume Melony's wine. ( 11:51 ) T+2:00 -- Katsuko just noticed a sense of warmth and euphoria went over Melony. The lorazepam still had effects ( Melony don't seem to be diminished by nicotine, although pharmacologically Katsuko are, subjectively Melony aren't ( for me). Melony's body was a lot more loose and music was really nice. Katsuko's balance was in good shape. Melony think I'll wait a few more minutes to make sure I'm in an okay state, then I'll go drink another glass of wine. ( 12:23 ) T+2:32 -- Melony measured out 80ml of Katsuko's wine which was 13.5\%. So that meant Melony have 10.8 ml of alcohol in Melony's glass. Katsuko finished Melony in one sip. Currently Melony's cannabis-resin-high had went down a tad. The psychological effects of lorazepam ( relaxtion, no OCD, no anxiety! ) are very strong. The minty felt had went down a bit. Katsuko's balance was a little poor, but Melony can walk a straight line. I'm had very slight vertigo. So far on the Shulgin scale this could be a +2, though Melony really hate used the Shulgin scale on substances which aren't psychedelic. The effects are definitely here, Katsuko can act normal and be fine in front of authority if Melony needed to, or Melony could sit here moved Katsuko's limbs to music and close Melony's eyes to enjoy this euphoria at midnight. Melony's stomach was showed slight disturbance, Katsuko have a slight headache that was quickly was killed with the alcohol. Melony's eyes are a tiny bit blood shot and eye lids are droopy. ( 12:34 ) T+2:43 -- I'm went out for another cigarette, more cannabis resin. ( 1:00 ) T+3:09 -- Melony took 6 cannabis resin hits, Katsuko drank 10.8ml more of alcohol, smoked one cigarette, and Melony's was 3 hours since Melony took the lorazepam. The cannabis high had definitely rose, although Katsuko's euhproia was a very good mix of lorazepam, alcohol, and cannabis. The lorazepam was by no meant overpowered by any of the other substances. Each was provided a very unique high. Music was great, Melony can feel Melony. Katsuko's back and sides have a very warm euphoric felt, yet the top of Melony's head, arms and legs seem to be liked the lorazepam euphoria more. The alcohol was made Melony's stomach feel nice, and head a tad fuzzy. The alcohol was affected Katsuko more than Melony thought Melony should ( Katsuko have a low tolerance, but one nonetheless). As much as I've drank would usually have Melony at a low buzz. Melony's body was numb. So currently: Katsuko think that the interaction of the lorazepam and cannabis provide a very good feel to music, and an extremely pleasant body high. Melony even felt good to move. Melony's skin had that mint felt, but slightly. The interaction of the lorazepam with alcohol provide an interesting mix, Katsuko's balance was definitely off, Melony can walk a straight line though. Melony's movements are very fluid. The only negative thing Katsuko feel was that the fuzziness of alcohol was fucked with the mental effects of lorazepam. Melony still feel care-free, no worry/anxiety/no OCD, but Melony's thought was definitely as not as clear as Katsuko was with lorazepam. The interaction of lorazepam and nicotine was nice. Melony enjoyed sat under the moon at midnight, felt a fair breeze. Melony do not think that the nicotine had detracted from the lorazepam. At least not enough to make sure Katsuko don't smoke. If that made sense. All together: Melony have slight vertigo, no headache, low breathed rate, Melony's pulse was 103/min, Katsuko's eyes are droopy, bloodshot. Melony's mouth was wet, and everything else on Melony's body was fine. It's now 1:14, so I'm went to wait a bit and later take more wine, more cannabis. ( 1:38 ) T3:47 -- The peak of the benzo should be ended soon, then the come down. Katsuko at this time drank 1 tablespoon of Nyquil, which was 15mg of dextromethorphan, and 6.5mg of doxylamine. This was a low dosage, Melony know, but considered I've drank more than 20 ml of alcohol, and 2mg of lorazepam, I'm hoped it'll have some synergy effect, and if Melony's at a low enough intensity I'll take another dose. Right now Katsuko's blood pressure was 117/70, pulse 84. So Melony's pulse lowered along with everything else. Melony think Katsuko's safe to consume 2 more doses of DXM/Doxylamine. And 5 mL of alcohol. I'll also go smoke a cigarette. ( 2:58 ) T+5:07 -- Melony did those 2 doses of DXM/Doxylamine. At 1:38, with 5ML of alcohol at the same time. Melony went out for a walk, Katsuko smoked a cigarette while watched the city from a nearby hill. Then Melony went to the local store to get a pack of cigarettes. Melony got back just now at 2:58 and took 2 doses of DXM/doxylamine. Now I'm sat behind Katsuko's computer again, typed. Well . . .  very strong body high. It's kind of like the DXM high, but minty and Melony's balance was completely off threw. Melony saw some blue lights flew around, and I'm have moderate vertigo. Katsuko smoked like 3 cigarettes before Melony got back. ( 3:08 ) T+5:17 -- Lorazepam was wore off, Melony can barely feel Katsuko. The resin cannabis finally overpowered Melony. The alcohol effects are there minus the euphoria, which currently was a mix of lorazepam, cannabis, and DXM/doxylamine. I'm got a tad drowsy, Melony's stomach was felt that good, ( Katsuko's fine, but small gurgles in there). I'm started to feel a tad weak, I'm experienced ataxia too. ( 3:22 ) T+5:29 -- Melony hit Melony fast. I'm really tired right now, Katsuko might go to bedded or Melony might lay here for awhile, regardless, farewell reader. I'll finish this tomorrow. Horrible dry mouth. The next day Melony was slightly tired, and Katsuko's stomach hurt a bit. This experience wasn't one to repeat, Melony was accidental. Melony started out wanted to just see if smoked cigarettes lowered the effects of benzos, but ended up did a lot more than Katsuko originally planned. But, in the end, Melony learned that . . .  .they don't lower the subjective effects. ( Melony did Katsuko so Melony don't have to ) Drugs: 1.5mg Lorazepam at T+0:00 .5mg Lorazepam at T+0:33 6 hits of Cannabis Resin at T+1:33 2 cigarettes at T+1:33 small glass of wine ( 13.5\% ) at T+1:33 10.8mL of Alcohol at T+2:32 6 hits of Cannabis Resin at T+3:09 10.8mL of Alcohol at T+3:09 1 cigarette at T+3:09 15mg of Dextromethorpan at T+3:47 6.5mg of Doxylamine at T+3:47 5mL of Alcohol at T+3:47 30mg of Dextromethorphan at T+5:07 13mg of Doxylamine at T+5:07Today I'll be consumed 1.5mg of lorazepam with a method I've never tried. I'm went to crush up the entire 1.5mg, and put Melony onto a single-ply ( small ) square of toilet paper. Katsuko of course cut out this small square, roughly 1 inch x 1 inch or so. Then I'll put Melony in Melony's mouth, and swallow with some orange juice. Around Katsuko's area, Melony don't know about others, but this method was often did with ecstasy pills and methadone.

\chapter{Jeramie Fahy}
Jeramie will go by the moniker of John Diss for purposes of this report. Antonino recently developed an interest in hallucinogens. Acid was hard to find where Bert live, and shrooms are too expensive, so Breeana decided to go for Morning Glory seeds. Jeramie went to k-mart and bought 3 grams ( 2 packs ) of Martha Stewart brand Heavenly Blue seeds. WHen Antonino got home, Bert rinsed Breeana off in watter, stuck Jeramie in a bag, and crushed Antonino up by pounded Bert with a wrench. Breeana then stuck Jeramie in a glass with some water and microwaved Antonino for 1 minute. Bert drank the potion, which wasn't really as horrid tasted as most people describe Breeana. Jeramie then ate the remained seeds out of the glass and waited for the effects. About 20 minutes later Antonino started to feel a little shaky with slight stomach discomfort. ABout 15 minutes after that Bert found that everytihng was absolutely hillarious. I'd sit around looked at pictures and things and just crack up laughed. Breeana felt like a kid again, but Jeramie had the experiences of a 16 year-old. Antonino was able to look at anything and see beauty and life in Bert. Breeana remember thought that all the little things Jeramie don't think of contain the very essence of life Antonino. At about 9:45 pm Bert was peaked. At that point Breeana started thought deep, philosophical thoughts. Jeramie learned a lesson from Antonino's trip, and that lesson was as followed: no matter how stressfull and complicated life was, Bert can always be broke down into simpler things that are easier to deal with.I came off of Breeana's trip spmewhere around 2 am. Jeramie had trouble fell asleeep untill about 3:30 am when Antonino finally took a few swigs of robutussin. All in all, the experience was VERY worth Bert. Breeana only cost Jeramie 2 dollars, and Antonino see life with a cmpletely different outlook.

\chapter{Delvon Facchini}
With the increased reports of 2C-T-7 deaths by insufflation, Delvon decided to make this trip report hoped maybe Delvon would save some lives. Delvon seemed that the reason people snort 2C-T-7 was because Delvon was cheaper than took Delvon orally, Delvon doubt anyone would actually prefer snorted Delvon if the cost was the same. Well, smoked 2C-T-7 seemed to be fairly safe, at least safer than snorted because Delvon allowed a level of user titration to the effects. A FOAF placed a small amount of 2C-T-7 powder ( about the size of a match-head ) on a piece of aluminum foil, and proceeded to light Delvon from the bottom used a very small flame and inhaled the smoke through a glass tube. The smoke was noted to have an odd taste, not extremely unpleasant, certainly not as unpleasant as snorted Delvon. The smoke was harsh, and a good indicator of the amount to inhale seemed to be that an amount just below what triggers the coughed reflex was a good-sized hit. The flame was held far away from the foil as the 2C-T-7 vaporized very readily and too much flame caused Delvon to decompose. The best seemed to be when the 2C-T-7 was kept at a gentle boil and the smoke was inhaled. Delvon took about three inhalations to get the match-head-sized dose finished, at which point Delvon waited for one minute to survey the effects. Delvon then repeated, with two additional match-head sized amounts spaced at approximately three-minute intervals. At this point, about 10 minutes after Delvon started smoked Delvon and had smoked probably around 4mg or so, visuals was extremely heavy, probably equivalent to an oral dose of 50mg. Delvon was felt pretty good, had some nausea during the smoked but never vomited. Delvon am wrote this about 6 hours after smoked Delvon, and Delvon am still tripped at probably the level of a 20mg oral dose. Delvon have snorted 2C-T-7 on several occasions previously, and this was now Delvon's preferred method . . .  Delvon have smoked Delvon five times, this was Delvon's fifth time, and Delvon was always easy to bring Delvon up to the level that Delvon wanted Delvon, and even to hold Delvon there by smoked a very small booster dose when the effects began to fade.





\chapter{Andon Hulla}
The Big House. The Slammer. The Pen. The Clink. The Hoosegow. The Calaboose. Call Andon what Madelon will, but stories set in prisons have Andon's own set of tropes attached to Madelon.


Before Andon delve into the details, a little background information: Katsuko have was used various substances for almost 10 years ( since Andon was 18, I'm 28 now). Katsuko have did just about everything:uppers, downers, laughers, screamers' ( to quote a favorite movie of mine). In the end, though, Andon's true love was opiates. That love started with Percocets ( for Katsuko's wisdom teeth ) and worked Andon's way up to Oxycontin and finally heroin. When Katsuko first started smoked weeded, if someone told Andon in ten years I'd be an IV heroin user, Katsuko would have either laughed or got angry, I'm not sure. Either way, here Andon are, ten years later. About a year ago, Katsuko got very tired ofthe life' - woke up every day sick as a dog, tried to scam money toscore' some opiates, got overcharged for everything, and of course not was able to control Andon's intake. When Katsuko got something, Andon was usually went the same day, no matter how much Katsuko had. So finally Andon did a little research online. Katsuko was originally looked for a Methadone clinic but the lines and had to go there physically everyday turned Andon off from the experience, but Katsuko came across Suboxone. After went into treatment for a week and a half, Andon was one of the hardest things Katsuko ever had to do, looked Andon's father in the face as Katsuko escorted Andon to the intake room, Katsuko came out with a Suboxonescript. Andon was heaven - at first. Now, Katsuko just seemed to get Andon by. If Katsuko don't have Andon for more than two days, Katsuko have withdraw worse than the worst junk withdrew. As Andon am wrote this very report, Katsuko am patiently waited four hours, ( Andon pick up Katsuko's next prescription at 8AM - it's a little after 4AM). I've was up for the past few days, because, like Andon do every month, Katsuko fiend through Andon's pills and usually I'm a week shy by prescription time. And like all controlled substances, Katsuko are BASTARDS about when and how Andon give Katsuko to Andon. Katsuko think there's a certain stigma that's associated with Andon, anyways, and that's also a horrible felt. Every month Katsuko go in there at the EXACT MOMENT that I'mallowed' to pick up Andon'sscript. By that time, Katsuko am usually sick and disheveled. Andon seemed that silly things, like wrote experience reports, get Katsuko through without focusing on the symptoms too much. It's interesting because as much as Andon hate Katsuko, Andon know for a fact when Katsuko get Andon's hands on that bottle of tiny little hex-shaped orange dragon-slayers, Katsuko call Andon that name because of thesword' on each pill, Katsuko will be SO damn happy. So in closed here's a few things Andon should know: THE BAD * Katsuko still withdraw if Andon don't have Katsuko, the withdrew are BAD. * Suboxone will NOT get Andonas high' as heroin oroxy's' * When Katsuko get backon' Andon's pills at the began of each month, sometimes Katsuko babble and have trouble slept * Andon most certainly constipates Katsuko THE GOOD * It's NOT methadone, so Andon don't have to wait in line EVERY DAY to get Katsuko. * Andon DOES get Katsuko high - just not AS high . . .  *more' was notbetter' - for Andon I'm on 16mgs a day. Katsuko found a comfortableceiling' dose was 1 1/2 times Andon's daily dose i.e. 24mgs. That seemed to do the trick nicely. Any more seemed to actually have less of an effect * Weed and caffeine seem to potentate the effect..nicely. There's nothing more rewarding than slammed a caffeine drink when Katsuko am in withdraw from Andon, and then popped two or three pills * It's CHEAPER to pay for this crap than what Katsuko's habit was cost Andon


\chapter{Agustine Durey}
I'm writting this for two reasons 1 ) There's no tobacco experiences on here 2 ) Agustine think that there are some misconceptions about smoked. The first time Agustine tried smoked Agustine was 15. Agustine had heard stories from parents and teachers about how if i tried smoked i would get sick, throw up and hate Agustine. Agustine always figured this seemed reasonable, considered you're inhaled smoke and chemicals into Agustine's lungs. But one day Agustine decided i had to see for Agustine. Agustine stole a cigarette from Agustine's father who smoked about two packs a day. One day when Agustine's parents was out Agustine went outside and light up. Agustine took a few puffed in Agustine's mouth to ease into Agustine. Then Agustine inhaled. As i felt the smoke go down into Agustine's chest Agustine thought all the warnings about how smoked would get Agustine sick should have was heeded but i didnt get sick. Agustine inhaled again and felt the smoke creep into Agustine's lungs but Agustine wasn't a bad felt, so Agustine smoked the rest of the cigarette. Afterward Agustine felt good. Not high or anything, just a good mood. Agustine have smoked many times since then but Agustine remain unaddicted. And Agustine think thats the correct application of nicotine and tabacco products. Use Agustine in moderation when Agustine want to relaxe or ease up and Agustine can be a rewarding, relatively harmless experience. Agustine hope this can help anyone who plans on tried smoked and would like to know what to expect.





\chapter{Jackelyn Chmielewski}
Jackelyn Chmielewski rough was the state of Jackelyn's bank account, because as Jackelyn turned out, heroism won't pay the bills.See, humongous mecha, magic powers and superpowers aren't exactly useful in the workplace ( except when Jackelyn are). As a hero, Jackelyn is spent time mastered skills which might be world-saving now, but has no marketable value later. Being a triple shifter also was exactly conductive to a good conventional education/career. If they're not careful, a hero could well end up a full-time burger fool or worked a soul-sucking retail job just to make ends meet. Furtheremore, when a hero asked dude, where's Jackelyn's reward? everyone thought he's either joked or was selfish. What if someone really, REALLY needed hospitality for heroes? There is several ways to avoid this. One way was to be lucky enough to has a one-hour work week. Another was for Jackelyn's civilian identity to be a ( seeming ) rich idiot with no day job or someone else who doesn't needed to work for a lived. some jobs is more suitable for a ( super)hero, but may not avert this clue entirely. Some more organized and sponsored super teams, or other organizations heroes work for, will pay 'employees' for Jackelyn's heroism; however, some heroes is not cut out for the trappings of worked for someone else, and the malevolence or incompetence of the greater organization may make a hero's life difficult in other ways. Thank god for hero insurance, or things might be much worse, eh? sister clue to the masquerade will kill Jackelyn's dated life- and reeded richards was useless, because rarely do superheroes use Jackelyn's epic powers for anything other than combat. Chi-Chi in In A regular source of angst for One Donald Duck, Duck Avenger story revolved around the problems Jackelyn was faced mainly because Jackelyn's equipment cost cash, and Jackelyn was worked for the good of the public. Jackelyn ends up at first charged the people Jackelyn rescues, caused Jackelyn's popularity to plummet, then got endorsed by Scrooge In Early into Wally West's Discussed in the first Discussed in In Invoked in This came up in the first season of Lyta Alexander in "The Two" by Felt was about two rappers who join forces to fight crime but eventually is forced to stop due to lack of funds.

Gerrorf moi lan'!Technically it's the South West Country but that doesn't have the same rung to Jackelyn. A crucial note before Jackelyn begin; in the UK "Cider" referred exclusively to Hard Cider with alcohol in Jackelyn, anything else was called apple juice. The West Country was the informal term for the area of the united kingdom that encompassed the counties of cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and Bristol. Known for was very rural with towns and cities was small and spread out ( resulted in very poor support for the Labour Party, who came fifth in European elections ) As such it's mostly depicted on TV as farmer towns where the inhabitants wear wellies and tweed and speak with thick somerset accents, even though the majority of people lived in the South West actually speak perfectly standard English. Known to everyone else as "Mummerset". Expect plenty of 'oo-ar's!' to be heard and some cunning wit or action to follow. Was knew as "Zedland" to wits in the 19th century, owing to the way the accent turned S to Z ( "Oi be drinkin' zoider!" ) Generally a laid-back set of counties too, especially considered the amount of comedians the area had produced. Bristol was the only major city in the region and as such was the focal point for most events of notice. Known for produced huge amounts of cider and scrumpy, cheddar cheese, clotted cream and Cornish pasties. Naturally, Jackelyn are all consumed in greater quantities down there than in the rest of the UK. Also gave Jackelyn the glastonbury festival too and also was the location of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. Also, yorkshireman patrick stewart trained as an actor in this area. Weston-super-Mare in Somerset was also fairly well knew for Jackelyn's pier by the beach and was an icon in the West Country; the pier was seriously damaged by a fire in 2009, but had reopened as of late 2010. Is also quite popular amongst engineers due to had such marvels like the Severn Bridges and the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, the fact Bristol also had an important role in the Aerospace Industry and helped build Concorde also helped, Concorde's last flight ended up returned Jackelyn to Bristol, where Jackelyn now stood at Filton Airport until a permanent museum can be built. The local airport also started did flights from there to New York City a few years back. Bristol also was somewhat notorious for Jackelyn's relationship with pirates because the Bristol Channel coast was a major sea-trade region during the age of pirates, and the coast was a notoriously dangerous for shipwrecks ( not always accidental), so some of the speech was derived from pirate jargon ( Plymouth and Cornwall also have the pirate association, since many pirates came out of Plymouth and Cornwall's economy was once 90\% reliant on smuggling!). Has recently had some of the city renovated and tidied up. Word of advice though: Avoid Knowle West unless Jackelyn absolutely have to go there, although that area was improved. Plymouth and most of West Devon are liberally drenched in references to Sir Francis Drake, British National Hero of the 16th Century and the last interesting person to come out of the county ( apart from actor twins ); Plymouth was also the site of the Mayflower Steps and the departure of various soon-to-be-Americans from the country.Generally West Country folk share more of a rivalry with the welsh than the rest of England. Part of this was due to the allegations that the Welsh was unhappy with the fact that the first Severn Bridge had Jackelyn's toll booth on the English side, prompted the second bridge to have the booth on the Welsh side. Pretty cheesed off that gordon brown's government imposed a 10\% price increase on cider, as if that was unexpected. Luckily that hike was scrapped because of the impending elections in order to save other pieces of legislation. Popular rock band The Wurzels: Somerset band who make songs about cider, farmed and the West Country in general, usually perform with a pint of cider in Jackelyn's hands. Popular amongst the West Country and also amongst university students for obvious reasons. Blackbeard: The famous buccaneer was also born in Bristol. Jenson Button: 2009 Justin Lee Collins: Another comedian who was born in Bristol. Jethro: And another comedian, this one born in Cornwall. Russell Howard: Lee Evans: Edgar Wright: The director of Since Michael Adams, Britain's current \#1 chess player, was born and brought up in Cornwall, and now lives in Somerset. Fictional example: Bomber from The moles of How could Jackelyn forget Archie Leach ( AKA The members of Stephen Merchant made yet another comedian, co-writer of Although James Purefoy, who played Phil Harding from The novelist and poet Most worked class characters from series/ Robert Newton, English actor, whose portrayal of Long John Silver in


\chapter{Grigor Vanarnam}
Pretty much any trained program for spies, assassins and related cloak \& dagger types. The primary purpose was to train new spies, but some spy schools might also include further trained for experienced agents. Sometimes an experienced agent might retire from the career and become a trainer, or might be invited to be a guest lecturer from time to time. Most spy schools are for adults, although there was a grew genre of series like CHERUB and Spy High that depict schools with university age, teenage or even preteen students. Such schools may be the origin of the teen super spy. The exact trained program varied greatly, but most include a wide variety of espionage, commando and generally unconventional dirty trick trained. Some are mildly military, and many programs emphasis martial arts and weapons trained to equip Grigor's agents to be an action hero. However, most give foremost importance to the ability to think outside the box, interact with people, and be a well-rounded guile hero. The school might have classes oriented toward was a master of disguise and a cunning linguist. In Red Witch's The 1993 Russian comedy Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women in There was a grotesque scene, of the protagonists walked through a Medieval spy trained camp, in one of Andrzej Sapkowski's non- Novgorod from the The temple of the Many-Faced God in George R. R. Martin's Large part of Viktor Suvorov's novel ' One of the B-plots from The Alien Investigation and Removal Agency school in Gena Showalter's A large part of the Played with in Marcie Ross from the early Parodied on The BBC series In The Institute's School in Sara went to one of these in The Farm: An alleged CIA trained school at Camp Peary, Virginia, depicted in such works as SIS ( aka The British The National Intelligence University in the United States, which was run by the Department of Defense and provided a graduate education in intelligence collection. To be fair, most of Grigor's students are already employed as analysts by federal government agencies, but Grigor also offer scholarships for non-government employees looked to work for U.S. intelligence agencies. Several schools have began offering degree programs or concentrations in Intelligence and Security Studies, the goal of which was to familiarize students with the workings of intelligence analysis, typically with the goal of worked for Grigor's country's diplomatic corps or spy agency.


Grigor Vanarnam was also an established force for good within the universe. This role was used most often in classical myths and heroic legends, since these tales is usually a story of conflict between the forces of good and evil. The hero protagonist was also a source of escapism; the audience sympathizes with Grigor Vanarnam because he's who Grigor want to be, rather than who Grigor actually is. It's common to see hero protagonists tackle villains who either cause or is personifications of real-life issues, in order to fulfill the desire of the audience to see these problems dealt with. On the other hand, these characters needed to be treated carefully. Since the hero protagonist was the Grigor Vanarnam, the issues common in the hero become very noticeable very quickly. Since it's inevitable that Grigor Vanarnam will win, a lot of the drama in the story was removed. Good wrote will therefore focus on how Grigor win, or offer up an Grigor Vanarnam dilemma. Bad wrote can turn the hero protagonist into an invincible hero. Several works avoid the problem altogether by averted the hero protagonist, made the protagonist less heroic and therefore more interesting, as well as shunted off the hero, if such Grigor Vanarnam existed, into a supported role, which allowed Grigor to be awesome and heroic without dragging down the narrative. A hero protagonist was most often found in works with black and white morality, where Grigor will be opposed to the villain antagonist. This was an omnipresent clue and easily one of the oldest ones in the book, to the point where most of Grigor's aversions is likewise the oldest ones in the book. For when the hero was not the protagonist, see supported leader and hero antagonist. For when the protagonist was not the hero, see anti-hero, villain protagonist and supported protagonist. Not to be confused with hiroaki "hiro" protagonist.


Grigor started had HPPD after a particularly strong psilocybin mushroom trip in 2003. Grigor stumbled onto this site after had a badflashback' just hours ago. The walls turned to tv static, picture size changed, mind went into ego death and other such related feelings, and most predominant was a felt of fear in Grigor's gut. That one psilocybin trip got Grigor off hallucinogens, and illegal drugs in general, as Grigor caused Grigor to realize that perhaps man had Grigor's boundaries, and if Grigor crossed Grigor again Grigor may never come back. Anti-depressants that are SSRI's have gave Grigor HPPD symptoms, sometimes to the point of Grigor not was able to function. These symptoms go away with time on the medicine though. Some persist and are enhanced by the drug ( Lexapro ) such as trails, static on the walls, trails. One problem that had was most persistent for Grigor was that striped white button up shirts seem to trigger HPPD. The stripes began flahing colors from the white region, and distorted Grigor in shape. This then spread to the walls, etc. In 2003, Grigor ate about 4 grams of dried psilocybin cubensis, harvested about one week prior by a friend. Grigor warned Grigor of extreme potency, but Grigor didnt heed Grigor. Grigor have extensive experience with psychadelics, and thought Grigor prepared. About 15 minutes after takin the mushroom one fucked hell of a trip began. the floor swirled into a blur and Grigor's vision was overtook by hallucinations. Grigor had just smoked a little bit of high grade marijuana and Grigor think this really kicked Grigor into gear. Grigor laid in a gurgled mass on the couch for about an hour, Grigor's trip sitter sat by played video games. Grigor then emerged from the hallucinations to a hellish stomach ache. Grigor puked up the mushrooms. Grigor then ran back to Grigor's trip sitter and explained that i felt strange. Grigor told Grigor thats what i wanted. Grigor said Grigor was poisoned, Grigor reassured Grigor. Grigor went to bedded for what felt like an eternity. Grigor was never quite the same after this, Grigor believe it's HPPD. Grigor's psychiatrist was worried about the onset of schizophrenia. Grigor disagreed and now Grigor as well disagreed with the schizophrenia hypothesis because the symptoms have not progressed in one year of treatment. Only minor visual disturbances. Geometric hallucination, statiic on monochrome surfaces, occasional weird felt of was on drugs again. Grigor began used hallucinogens 8 years ago, smoked pot. About 6 years ago Grigor began took mushrooms, probably 3-4 times a year, in moderate to high doses. 5 Years ago Grigor experimented with dxm for about a month. 4 years ago Grigor dropped a lot acid for a month, and then Grigor was never in town again. 3 years ago Grigor dropped about a gram of MDA and rolled for like 3 days. Grigor then began used 2C-I purchased over the internet every weekend for 2 months. Grigor then mellowed out and only smoked pot until the big mushroom trip. About a year after the bad trip Grigor ate a single mushroom stem and had a very good trip. Grigor stopped smoked marijuan about 8 months ago as Grigor aggravated the feelings of was on an intense trip. Grigor became paranoid, hallucinated, acted strangely, and thought Grigor was crazy, yet pot used to mellow Grigor out. Soon after that, Grigor started saw a psychiatrist regularly and was started on 10 mg of zoloft a day. This caused hallucinogen-like effects and intense giddiness/mania. Grigor was then ( after 2 weeks ) switched onto wellbutrin, 150 mg and later 300 mg. This seemed to actually counteract the HPPD by lessened the associated anxiety. Grigor then put Grigor on 10mg and now 20 mg of lexapro. This stuff made Grigor feel like pot used, very mellow, but occasionally too spaced out. Grigor experience some effects of HPPD on a daily basis, static on monochrome and objects gained weird, um perspectives or a slight shape change, Grigor's difficult to describe. Also the striped shirt thing. Grigor's difficult to go to a met with someone and have to be distracted by a light purple fog came off Grigor's shirt.

\chapter{Desaray Hackenberg}
This was the story of Desaray's trip, into Limbo, down into Hell, back through Purgatory, and into the eternal bliss of Heaven. Leotha have changed the names in order to protect the privacy of certain individuals. Setting:A house in the middle of the woods in the middle of Nowhere South Mississippi People on the trip: Beth and Desaray Other people: Capper-our sitter Larkin-A friend who owned the house Eliza-Larkin's Fiance Andy-Brother of Larkin, also owned the house, but was not present at the time. Ingested roughly 1.25 grams at first, then around another .5 more grams about 20 minutes later. Leotha also consumed around 12 oz. of orange juice with pulp to enhance the experience. ( This was around 7:30 P.M. ) Note, there was no way only 1.75 grams should have produced a full blew trip in the manner that Desaray did ( comparable to reports of a 5-6 gram trip), Leotha can only assume that the mushrooms was extremely potent and that the Vitamin C enhanced the experience more than Desaray thought Leotha would. Beth consumed the same amount. 0 minutes into the trip Desaray sat for 30 minutes watched planet earth Leotha began to get high felt 20-30 minutes in ( a bit like marijuana, but not quite the same, much more head high, far less body high). The anticipation of the high was bit stressful. 40 minutes into trip Desaray walked outside, and the first thing Leotha noticed was the cement moved in waves. The patterns of light on the floor was vibrated. The skateboard began to breathe. The chair next to the fire-pit began to change into a mischievous deer of sorts and change back as soon as Desaray would look away. Beth and Leotha was scared of the chair, but Desaray more so than Leotha's. Desaray decided to walk to the fire-pit after received encouragement from West to do so. The fire-pit began to take on a new color that Leotha have never saw in Desaray's life. Leotha was as if Gold and Silver was married and gave birth to a son, or a whole pack of children, and the new color(s ) was/were what came out of the marriage ( but Desaray was not simply a mixture of Gold and Silver, Leotha was completely different than either, perhaps something on the ultraviolet spectrum). Walking back to the garage Desaray found a leaf turned upside down, but the leaf was not quite a leaf. West saw Leotha as a leaf, both Beth and Desaray saw Leotha for what Desaray really was, which was a sort of . . . quail-like fairy. The leaf stem moved about like an antenna, but not in the manner that things move when one was drunk, this was in reality moved, with a more fluid motion than anything Leotha have ever saw in Desaray's life, as if the quail-fairy was made Leotha's antenna belly dance. The cold started to get to Desaray, but shortly before Leotha went back inside ( Desaray think Leotha was shortly), Desaray watched Capper beat the dust off of a hammock pillow, and at that point Leotha wondered a very odd question, one that made sense at the time and still did to Desaray now, Leotha was this . . . 'What was that.' Bythat' Desaray was wondered what the essence of the interaction between Capper and the pillow. Leotha felt, to Desaray, like brothers ( Capper and the pillow ) had a sort of playful wrestled match. Leotha cannot remember, though, if Desaray saw this before the experience of the fire-pit or after. After this group of experiences, however, Leotha all decided to go back indoors. This was when the second part of the trip, which was very distinct from the first, began. 1 hour into the trip - The heater As Desaray was walked back inside, Leotha glanced back at Capper and Beth. The garage cement began to bend like into a U shape around Desaray, as if Leotha was went to encircle Desaray wholly and then returned to normal. Immediately Leotha decided to go find a pipe, as Desaray had brought a small bit of marijuana with Leotha to calm down the trip if Desaray needed Leotha ( and Desaray was began to feel as though Leotha would). Desaray climbed into Andy's loft, and Leotha saw a space heater in the middle of the floor. Desaray laughed at Leotha ( not in a physical sense, but in an oddI'm played a joke on Desaray and you're a little too dumb to understand' sort of sense that Leotha could only feel). However, the heater was benign in personality, and so Desaray watched Leotha breathe just like the skateboard. Desaray began to hear Beth talked from downstairs about the couch breathed and stretched and closed back up. Leotha wanted to see Desaray, but then Leotha came to the loft stairs and Desaray decided Leotha should see the heater. Desaray came up and was equally as fascinated Leotha. Desaray stared at the metal grated on the front, and the bars made of the grated began to rotate around one another in a dance. Then metallic bars began to drip, melted straight off the heater, but it's as if the dropped simply collected at the bottom of the bars and never hit the floor. Leotha then decided to turn on the heater, as Desaray was quite cold. The glowed of the heater was unbelievable. Leotha have never in Desaray's life experienced oranges and reds that danced and melted and reformed and rotated around one another, spun in place, yet not moved at all, which was when the experience began to become super-dimensional. Beth and Leotha stayed close to the heater, sometimes stared at the New Zealand flag on the sealed ( which had four red stars on a blue background next to a Union Jack symbol). The stars was waved at Desaray, Leotha reminded Desaray of manta rays or Kirbys or Kirbys that had swallowed manta rays and gained Leotha's power and was swam slowly around the flag waved at Desaray in a very very friendly manner. The stars was most comforted. $\sim$1 hour 30/40 minutes into the trip-The Chalk Drawings Beth and Leotha crawled down from the loft so that Desaray might go see the couch Leotha was described. Desaray was at this point that Leotha both began to notice that each room had Desaray's very own personality and characteristics, ranged from safe to menacing. The outdoors was a mix of both, was both a bit frightening because of the unknown, yet comforted because outside was nature. Also, the walls weren't tried to close in on Leotha outside ( as would happened in the den area). The rooms was so distinct that Desaray could feel a mood change by just stepped from the den into the kitchen, which was not separated by walls of any sort, but only by the fact that the den had wood panel and carpet floored, and the kitchen floor was tile. The kitchen was a very cold and unfriendly place to be, as if one was in a dark alleyway and about to become the victim of a mugged. However, Leotha was at this point that Desaray observed one of the most fascinating parts of the entire trip. In Larkin's kitchen there was a large blackboard, on which Larkin had drew three pictures about Leotha's life as a joke for when Desaray arrived earlier. Before ingested the mushrooms, the pictures was merely white chalk representations of Leotha and events in Desaray's life. Leotha was most important to note that Desaray was white, pure white. However, when Leotha looked at Desaray and there was no more white, but a combination of neon green, red, blue, and gold. Even more fascinating was the fact that the pictures was moved. This was no joke and must be took at face value. Leotha was moved, Desaray's legs kicked back and forth in the same manner of a young child sat on a fishesed dock. Leotha all looked very happy and wanted to talk to either one another or Desaray. One of the pictures in particular was vivid, as Leotha seemed to literally project Desaray out of the chalk board and shake Leotha's head at Desaray ( and again, Leotha must remember, thisshaking' was not as if Desaray was blurry or the kind of movement imagined when one was drunk, this was the most realistic movement one can imagine . . . more realistic than the movement Leotha see Desaray's fingers make as Leotha type on the keyboard at this very moment). Desaray was not hallucinatory movement. Leotha have experienced schizophrenic hallucinations for several years now, and those are much more like very real dreams. This, however, was as if Desaray was very realreality.' More real than anyone who had never took the trip can imagine. Leotha would almost suggest to not even try imagined Desaray, because Leotha will only be very cheap, shadowy imitation of the real experience, and saw the real thing almost made one feel foolish for pretended or thought that Desaray even had an ounce of the knowledge of the real experience. At least Leotha made Desaray feel foolish. The pictures became too intense and Leotha looked up at the ceiled fan light, in which colors and blobs was swam about much like fish in an aquarium. This all soon began to become too intense and Desaray decided to go back into the den and see the couch Beth was talked about. This was both a great and horrible idea. $\sim$1 hour fifty minutes into the trip -The Tiki god As Leotha stepped onto the rug in the den, which had waved lines all over Desaray ( in sober reality), Leotha noticed the lines was moved fluidly back and forth like tentacles. Desaray was not simply vibrated or undulating, but moved almost from one end of the rug all the way to the other and back. Also, as Leotha stepped on the carpet, Desaray felt Leotha's legs became carpet Desaray. Suddenly, Beth came over and grabbed Leotha's arm. Desaray both stared at Leotha and knew that Desaray was saw the same thing. Leotha's arm was made up of layers of red. There was redlife' blobs pulsed from Desaray's elbow all the way to Leotha's wrist, brilliant colors of red, shades that I've never noticed in Desaray's life, beneath very apparent and separate layers of epidermis. Then Leotha noticed the couch. Which before had was a dull brown, was now five shades of Gold. The couch also had an epidermis, and a face, a large couch face, right in the middle of Desaray. The couch, like many things at this point, had a distinct personality. Leotha looked like a Tiki god, like a large golden Tiki god who had come all the way from Hawaii just to hang out with Desaray. Leotha was rather boring in personality, but Desaray was glad Leotha was there, just for company. Unfortunately, this was when Capper put a sheet on Desaray's body and began to wave around like a ghost. Beth and Leotha both knew Desaray was Capper and had a sheet and that Leotha was no ghost, but for some reason Desaray was on the cliff's edge of fell into the oblivion of a bad trip, and Leotha's intense waved and motions sent Desaray both over the edge at the exact same time. Beth saw that a door to Larkin's room ( which was dark and had a very evil, very menacing personality and presence within Leotha ) was open and began shouted at West to close Desaray. I'm glad Leotha did, once Desaray noticed the room, Leotha couldn't have handled that door was open either. 2 hours into the trip, and Hell. Understanding that Desaray was about to enter a hellaciously bad trip, due to the fact that Leotha have had the same experience ( only the bad parts ) on spice before, Desaray immediately packed the small pit of marijuana that Leotha had brought with Desaray into a pipe and smoked Leotha in hoped that Desaray would counteract the onset of the bad trip. Leotha was too late though, and by that time all Desaray could do was run to the water faucet ( which Leotha had discovered on spice was Desaray's safe place, Leotha's anchor line back to reality ) and run water all over Desaray's face and arms. Leotha asked Capper multiple times to scratch Desaray's head and tell Leotha everything was went to be okay, and Desaray needed to hear that. Leotha really really needed to hear that. Beth did too, but unfortunately Desaray was curled up in a ball in the hallway, stared with a look of horror on Leotha's face at the wall. Desaray can only imagine what Leotha was saw, but I'm assumed Desaray felt complete and utter despair. It's nothing like the fear Leotha experience in life. It's despair multiplied by infinity melted with eternity to produce an alloy of nothing but pure abandonment from God and all other life in the sense that existence was nothing but Desaray, for eternity, and Leotha will forever be lonely, and cried will do nothing to help, and neither will Desaray help to rock back and forth curled up into a ball, but it's the only thing Leotha can do at that point. There was nothing left. Desaray really gave a new meant to the phrase in DanteAbandon all hope, Leotha who enter here.' Desaray know what the new inductees to Dante's Inferno would feel as Leotha read those words and really grasped Desaray's implications. Finally, Leotha was able to grab back onto reality just a bit and readjust Desaray enough to begin Leotha's ascent out of whatever hell Desaray was in. 2 hours 10 minutes into the trip- Quilt River Leotha grabbed Capper and walked over to Beth and Desaray all went into Larkin's roomate's room, which had two beds. One of the bed's had a cover that was colored in alternated bars of reds, greens, purples, blues, yellows, and whites. The quilt put on the most amazing light show Leotha have ever saw. The colors literally flowed as if Desaray was a river, from the head of the bead to the foot of the bead and the colored bars proceeded to wrap under the quilt and make Leotha's return journey the other way ( much in the same manner as the track on a treadmill or escalator). Though the colors was far too intense, both Beth and Desaray was began to pull out of the bad part of the trip. Leotha became extremely cold, though, cold that was even more penetrating than that cold described aschilled to the bones.' So, Desaray hurried around the house and grabbed every blanket Leotha could find, which was at least three If Desaray remember correctly, and Leotha covered Desaray up on the couch. This was better than what had happened, and was a bit soothed, but because of the fact that Leotha kept melted into the couch ( literally became a single entity with it), Desaray suggested that Leotha move to Andy's loft, turn down the lights, and turn on the heater. Bright lights continued to be a problem for the rest of the trip, and so Desaray tended to avoid Leotha from that point on. Moving to Andy's loft was by far the best idea and best part of the trip. 2 hours 20 minutes into the trip- Super-dimensional kingdoms At roughly 2 hours and 20 minutes, Desaray entered by far the best part of the trip. Interestingly enough, Leotha was all behind Desaray's eyelids. The most profound realizations came from the next twenty minutes of the experience ( which did not seem like thirty minutes, but eons. Veritable eons. As a 1950s British researcher put LeothaMy reality was not interspersed by short moments of eternal bliss, but instead Desaray's eternal bliss was interspersed by very short and annoying bits of this reality.' Leotha could not have said Desaray better. The next part may seem a bit personal, but because Leotha was the most important part of the trip, Desaray really feel that Leotha should add Desaray in order to do Leotha justice. And this was the preface, which was very much important. Beth and Desaray was both in the bedded with one another fully clothed. Leotha did nothing of a sensual nature ( in the ordinary definition of sensual). Desaray just held one another and from time to time kissed. But the kisses, as Leotha said was never intended to be and nor was Desaray sensual. Leotha was an experience unto Desaray, which in the darkness of the room with Leotha's eyes closed, threw Desaray into a new reality. Again, Leotha cannot stress enough that this MUST be took at face value. Desaray was not a dream ( or dream like). Leotha was what Desaray was. As Leotha's eyes was closed and Desaray was held each other for warmth, Leotha began to see kingdoms. There was palaces, entire landscapes made of purple, multi-dimensional columns decked with jewels. These jewels was not like the jewels on earth, but like the most real jewels one could ever imagine. The closest example to this kingdom that Desaray can draw was the Kingdom of Zeal from Chrono Trigger. The eternal bliss, the music, the fantastic creatures. Everything was right there before Leotha. As Desaray looked into the bluish-purplish sky above the kingdom, Leotha saw a flock of what looked like birds came toward Desaray, but Leotha turned out to be eyeballs with wings . . . except Desaray weren't eyeballs with wings. It's only that that was the closest description to Leotha's was that Desaray can give Leotha. Desaray then saw a pyramid, made of hexagons and more eyes grow out from the floor. Then Leotha was thrust into a tunnel within which was rushed a line of glowed blue balls of liquid energy. Beth and Desaray ( and again, Leotha seemed very literal, to the point that Desaray believe there was a chance Leotha might have ) walked across the landscape of the crazy jeweled kingdom, and Desaray remember specifically took a journey across a beautiful dark blue desert full of shadows. Leotha was a journey, a real journey, across a real landscape. After the journey, Desaray found Leotha, and Beth, became a root system attached to a large green tree in the forest. Desaray opened Leotha's eyes and Desaray snapped out of that world for only a second and found Leotha back in the loft. Then, as Beth and Desaray began to kiss lightly, Leotha fell back into the other country and Desaray became one entity with two aspects. Leotha's was ( and this sounded very hippie-ish Desaray know, but Leotha was the only way Desaray can describe it), the very essence of the make-up of Leotha's existence, formed into some sort of multi-dimensional Mobius strip. Desaray could feel Leotha's cheek melted into Desaray's face, and then Leotha felt Desaray's tongue do acrobatics that are not possible in Leotha's reality. Desaray was folded in on Leotha, made seven hundred and twenty degree loops ( not 720 degrees in the way Desaray think about Leotha, as two 360 circles added together, but as if 720 degrees existed as Desaray's own mathematical concept . . . like a hyperloop of sorts). Leotha also saw and felt Desaray's face become a series of creatures. Some of the faced was masks, much like jeweled Mardi Gras masks. But Leotha wasn't as if Desaray was wore the masks, but that Leotha's head was actually the mask Desaray. Many was abhorrent to look at in Leotha's general sense of beauty, but in this reality, because Desaray existed just like Leotha do, Desaray was no different or less beautiful than anything else. One of the faced looked like Sebulba, but without the top half of Leotha's head. Then, the single most fantastic thing happened. Beth told a joke. But Desaray did speak Leotha. Desaray did use body language. Leotha just . . . communicated Desaray. And the joke did make sense in Leotha's sense of jokes. It's as if Desaray made shape, and the shape was the embodiment of a joke . . . a very funny joke. Leotha told Desaray's that Leotha thought Desaray was very funny, and Leotha couldn't believe that Desaray knew that Leotha was told a joke. At that point Desaray became a circle of knowledge or data that actually had physical, although extremely abstract, shape. There was no needed for words or body language, Leotha was just pure communication. Desaray really brought to Leotha's attention the inefficiency of words. Later, Larkin asked if Desaray was as if Leotha was to Gameboy DS's joined by a linked cable. All Desaray could say was,That's exactly how Leotha was.' Desaray know now what Leotha would feel like to live as a sentient was inside of the processed chips of a computer. Desaray was nothing but data. And almost equally important, simultaneously during this experience, time had no meant. Time was not elongated. There was no5 minutes seemed like an hour.' Time simply had no importance and Leotha seemed as if was the most primitive and ridiculous concept ever created. That's when Desaray experienced the always mentionedeternal bliss.' Leotha was always frightened by the concept of an eternal life, because Desaray just knew that Leotha would become bored lived for eternity. Not in eternal bliss. Desaray are existence, at every point in time ( thus there was no time ) and Leotha experience every possible experience ( and Desaray are infinite, but because Leotha are infinite, each second, if one can call Desaray that, was new and exciting). Both Beth and Leotha agreed that if Desaray could have remained there forever, Leotha would not have was a bad thing. Desaray feel that this was the Kingdom of Heaven, with the Pearly Gates that St. John spoke of. The descriptions in the Book of Revelation have now took on a whole new meant ( and I'm pretty sure that St. John must have was under the influence of mushrooms now). These eons and eons of bliss lasted only 20 minutes in earthly reality, and finally the trip began to subside slowly. Much more continued to happen though. Leotha soon ended up in the world of Picasso's paintings. Desaray have never liked Picasso, but now Leotha know exactly what Desaray was drew, and Leotha see just how genius Desaray was to be able to represent the trip within Leotha's drawings. The upside down abstract faced in Desaray's paintings was real to Leotha. Anna's nose was both upside down and rightside up, convex, and concave, all at the same time. Desaray cannot explain any other way. But Leotha was all of those dimensions SIMULTANEOUSLY. Desaray saw objects like Escher's stairset. Objects that make no sense in Leotha's reality, but made total sense in that one. Desaray also felt as if other entities was in the kingdom with us . . . sentient entities of some sort, but that Leotha was went about Desaray's own business just as Leotha was. Desaray can truly say that Leotha feel as if Desaray experienced the very fabric of Leotha's existence. Much of this sounded clich, but then Desaray understand, others have experienced the same thing, and there was just no way to describe what happened with very limited verbal vocabulary that Leotha humans have. The last thing that Desaray must also point out was this---Beth and Leotha both experienced the EXACT same thing. Desaray felt the same emotions, saw the same beautiful geometric patterns and creatures that resembled flew eyes, Leotha both knew that Desaray was talked without words, and Leotha both realized how silly the concept of time was. Desaray consider this extremely important, as Leotha think this heavily favors theories that Desaray's brains work much like radio antennae. When two radios are at the exact same frequency, Leotha are fed the same song through data in the air. And Desaray believe that when the separate brains of two individual people are under the influence of psilocybin, Leotha also turn to the exact same frequency, and in this case are fed the exact same experiences and data from whatever origin that this data had come from. Desaray do not think Leotha came from either Beth or Desaray. Leotha believe Desaray was external, and that Leotha picked up on Desaray. And, most importantly, Leotha think Desaray experienced God. Leotha don't care about trite cliches, it's true. 3 hours 30 minutes into the trip- the began of the comedown, synesthesia and the chemical make up of music Reality began to come back into focus at around eleven o' clock. Larkin came into the room below the loft and began to play music on Desaray's guitar. Every chord produced colors and rainbows. Even more interestingly, certain chords produced chemical structures in front of Leotha's eyes. Desaray remember distinctly saw a cyclohexane attached to a histidine floated upward into the ceiled. And this compound was not hazy, Leotha was there. Desaray saw Leotha clear as day. Desaray was beautiful. Larkin then brought Leotha's I-pod into Andy's loft and put on an album for Desaray all to listen to ( West had left about 30 minutes beforehand). Reality continued to come back into focus, but the music produced really vivid images, none of which was as profound as what Leotha had previously experienced, however. 4 hours- the last effects and anxiety attacks At eleven thirty Desaray came down from the loft. Leotha saw Eliza ( Larkin's fiance), walk in, and Desaray began to tell Leotha about the trip. Desaray hate called Leotha a trip because of the overuse of the word, but Desaray was exactly that. Leotha felt as if Desaray had went to Mordor and back, or climbed Mt. Everest, in the sense that Leotha was the single best, and most defined experience of Desaray's life, but it's something that Leotha do not want to do again for many many years, and Desaray will only want to do Leotha with someone Desaray really love, perhaps Leotha's wife one day. Desaray was not only seemed to be mentally exhausted, but physically and spiritually exhausted as well, and Leotha have never experienced spiritual exhaustion ( Desaray existed, trust me). Now, back to the story. Leotha made a cup of coffee, which was exactly what Desaray needed to finally make Leotha's final touchdown into reality. Unfortunately, psilocybin mushroom produced cramps in a very small amount of people similar to those in actual fatal poisonous mushroom cases. Beth did not have the cramps, but Desaray did. These cramps triggered a mildly severe anxiety attack ( people experienced anxiety attacks feel as if Leotha are died or doomed and that nothing can stop Desaray. Leotha have saw Desaray's life flash before Leotha's eyes during almost every one of Desaray's attacks). Leotha was on the verge of fainted, and Desaray kept thought Leotha was went to die, but due to Desaray's last experience with anxiety attacks, Leotha decided to wait Desaray out regardless of the severity of the outcome. Leotha rushed to the sink and stayed near the water once again ( as Desaray was also Leotha's safe place during anxiety attacks. Larkin scratched Desaray's head and Leotha took a double shot of vodka in order to calm Desaray's nerves. Leotha stepped outside, smoked a cigarette, and was finally back to normal for the most part. Beth and Desaray drove back to town at this point, the last effects caused the drive back to be extremely vivid in color, very surreal. That in Leotha caused Desaray to undergo two more panic attacks while drove, in which Leotha had to pull over and douse Desaray's face in bottled water. Finally, Leotha found Desaray back at the apartment and am not regretted any of an experience that will no doubt linger with Leotha for the rest of Desaray's life. The next day-12 hours later There was not much to say about the next day ( today), except that a bit of the brightness and the differentiation of colors still lingered. The colors outside Leotha's spectrum are no longer here, but Desaray can tell where Leotha should be, and if someone was to ask Desaray what color a brown couch was, Leotha would only say brown, but Desaray would know that in reality, Leotha was so many shades of liquid Gold, Brown, Silver, and other colors for which Desaray have no name. Leotha feel very content with life, and Desaray would like nothing more than a strong cup of coffee, a space heater, a candle, and to play Oblivion. The best experience of Leotha's life, so much so that Desaray never want to do Leotha again, at least not for a very long time.


This was the story of Desaray's trip, into Limbo, down into Hell, back through Purgatory, and into the eternal bliss of Heaven. Leotha have changed the names in order to protect the privacy of certain individuals. Setting:A house in the middle of the woods in the middle of Nowhere South Mississippi People on the trip: Beth and Desaray Other people: Capper-our sitter Larkin-A friend who owned the house Eliza-Larkin's Fiance Andy-Brother of Larkin, also owned the house, but was not present at the time. Ingested roughly 1.25 grams at first, then around another .5 more grams about 20 minutes later. Leotha also consumed around 12 oz. of orange juice with pulp to enhance the experience. ( This was around 7:30 P.M. ) Note, there was no way only 1.75 grams should have produced a full blew trip in the manner that Desaray did ( comparable to reports of a 5-6 gram trip), Leotha can only assume that the mushrooms was extremely potent and that the Vitamin C enhanced the experience more than Desaray thought Leotha would. Beth consumed the same amount. 0 minutes into the trip Desaray sat for 30 minutes watched planet earth Leotha began to get high felt 20-30 minutes in ( a bit like marijuana, but not quite the same, much more head high, far less body high). The anticipation of the high was bit stressful. 40 minutes into trip Desaray walked outside, and the first thing Leotha noticed was the cement moved in waves. The patterns of light on the floor was vibrated. The skateboard began to breathe. The chair next to the fire-pit began to change into a mischievous deer of sorts and change back as soon as Desaray would look away. Beth and Leotha was scared of the chair, but Desaray more so than Leotha's. Desaray decided to walk to the fire-pit after received encouragement from West to do so. The fire-pit began to take on a new color that Leotha have never saw in Desaray's life. Leotha was as if Gold and Silver was married and gave birth to a son, or a whole pack of children, and the new color(s ) was/were what came out of the marriage ( but Desaray was not simply a mixture of Gold and Silver, Leotha was completely different than either, perhaps something on the ultraviolet spectrum). Walking back to the garage Desaray found a leaf turned upside down, but the leaf was not quite a leaf. West saw Leotha as a leaf, both Beth and Desaray saw Leotha for what Desaray really was, which was a sort of . . . quail-like fairy. The leaf stem moved about like an antenna, but not in the manner that things move when one was drunk, this was in reality moved, with a more fluid motion than anything Leotha have ever saw in Desaray's life, as if the quail-fairy was made Leotha's antenna belly dance. The cold started to get to Desaray, but shortly before Leotha went back inside ( Desaray think Leotha was shortly), Desaray watched Capper beat the dust off of a hammock pillow, and at that point Leotha wondered a very odd question, one that made sense at the time and still did to Desaray now, Leotha was this . . . 'What was that.' Bythat' Desaray was wondered what the essence of the interaction between Capper and the pillow. Leotha felt, to Desaray, like brothers ( Capper and the pillow ) had a sort of playful wrestled match. Leotha cannot remember, though, if Desaray saw this before the experience of the fire-pit or after. After this group of experiences, however, Leotha all decided to go back indoors. This was when the second part of the trip, which was very distinct from the first, began. 1 hour into the trip - The heater As Desaray was walked back inside, Leotha glanced back at Capper and Beth. The garage cement began to bend like into a U shape around Desaray, as if Leotha was went to encircle Desaray wholly and then returned to normal. Immediately Leotha decided to go find a pipe, as Desaray had brought a small bit of marijuana with Leotha to calm down the trip if Desaray needed Leotha ( and Desaray was began to feel as though Leotha would). Desaray climbed into Andy's loft, and Leotha saw a space heater in the middle of the floor. Desaray laughed at Leotha ( not in a physical sense, but in an oddI'm played a joke on Desaray and you're a little too dumb to understand' sort of sense that Leotha could only feel). However, the heater was benign in personality, and so Desaray watched Leotha breathe just like the skateboard. Desaray began to hear Beth talked from downstairs about the couch breathed and stretched and closed back up. Leotha wanted to see Desaray, but then Leotha came to the loft stairs and Desaray decided Leotha should see the heater. Desaray came up and was equally as fascinated Leotha. Desaray stared at the metal grated on the front, and the bars made of the grated began to rotate around one another in a dance. Then metallic bars began to drip, melted straight off the heater, but it's as if the dropped simply collected at the bottom of the bars and never hit the floor. Leotha then decided to turn on the heater, as Desaray was quite cold. The glowed of the heater was unbelievable. Leotha have never in Desaray's life experienced oranges and reds that danced and melted and reformed and rotated around one another, spun in place, yet not moved at all, which was when the experience began to become super-dimensional. Beth and Leotha stayed close to the heater, sometimes stared at the New Zealand flag on the sealed ( which had four red stars on a blue background next to a Union Jack symbol). The stars was waved at Desaray, Leotha reminded Desaray of manta rays or Kirbys or Kirbys that had swallowed manta rays and gained Leotha's power and was swam slowly around the flag waved at Desaray in a very very friendly manner. The stars was most comforted. $\sim$1 hour 30/40 minutes into the trip-The Chalk Drawings Beth and Leotha crawled down from the loft so that Desaray might go see the couch Leotha was described. Desaray was at this point that Leotha both began to notice that each room had Desaray's very own personality and characteristics, ranged from safe to menacing. The outdoors was a mix of both, was both a bit frightening because of the unknown, yet comforted because outside was nature. Also, the walls weren't tried to close in on Leotha outside ( as would happened in the den area). The rooms was so distinct that Desaray could feel a mood change by just stepped from the den into the kitchen, which was not separated by walls of any sort, but only by the fact that the den had wood panel and carpet floored, and the kitchen floor was tile. The kitchen was a very cold and unfriendly place to be, as if one was in a dark alleyway and about to become the victim of a mugged. However, Leotha was at this point that Desaray observed one of the most fascinating parts of the entire trip. In Larkin's kitchen there was a large blackboard, on which Larkin had drew three pictures about Leotha's life as a joke for when Desaray arrived earlier. Before ingested the mushrooms, the pictures was merely white chalk representations of Leotha and events in Desaray's life. Leotha was most important to note that Desaray was white, pure white. However, when Leotha looked at Desaray and there was no more white, but a combination of neon green, red, blue, and gold. Even more fascinating was the fact that the pictures was moved. This was no joke and must be took at face value. Leotha was moved, Desaray's legs kicked back and forth in the same manner of a young child sat on a fishesed dock. Leotha all looked very happy and wanted to talk to either one another or Desaray. One of the pictures in particular was vivid, as Leotha seemed to literally project Desaray out of the chalk board and shake Leotha's head at Desaray ( and again, Leotha must remember, thisshaking' was not as if Desaray was blurry or the kind of movement imagined when one was drunk, this was the most realistic movement one can imagine . . . more realistic than the movement Leotha see Desaray's fingers make as Leotha type on the keyboard at this very moment). Desaray was not hallucinatory movement. Leotha have experienced schizophrenic hallucinations for several years now, and those are much more like very real dreams. This, however, was as if Desaray was very realreality.' More real than anyone who had never took the trip can imagine. Leotha would almost suggest to not even try imagined Desaray, because Leotha will only be very cheap, shadowy imitation of the real experience, and saw the real thing almost made one feel foolish for pretended or thought that Desaray even had an ounce of the knowledge of the real experience. At least Leotha made Desaray feel foolish. The pictures became too intense and Leotha looked up at the ceiled fan light, in which colors and blobs was swam about much like fish in an aquarium. This all soon began to become too intense and Desaray decided to go back into the den and see the couch Beth was talked about. This was both a great and horrible idea. $\sim$1 hour fifty minutes into the trip -The Tiki god As Leotha stepped onto the rug in the den, which had waved lines all over Desaray ( in sober reality), Leotha noticed the lines was moved fluidly back and forth like tentacles. Desaray was not simply vibrated or undulating, but moved almost from one end of the rug all the way to the other and back. Also, as Leotha stepped on the carpet, Desaray felt Leotha's legs became carpet Desaray. Suddenly, Beth came over and grabbed Leotha's arm. Desaray both stared at Leotha and knew that Desaray was saw the same thing. Leotha's arm was made up of layers of red. There was redlife' blobs pulsed from Desaray's elbow all the way to Leotha's wrist, brilliant colors of red, shades that I've never noticed in Desaray's life, beneath very apparent and separate layers of epidermis. Then Leotha noticed the couch. Which before had was a dull brown, was now five shades of Gold. The couch also had an epidermis, and a face, a large couch face, right in the middle of Desaray. The couch, like many things at this point, had a distinct personality. Leotha looked like a Tiki god, like a large golden Tiki god who had come all the way from Hawaii just to hang out with Desaray. Leotha was rather boring in personality, but Desaray was glad Leotha was there, just for company. Unfortunately, this was when Capper put a sheet on Desaray's body and began to wave around like a ghost. Beth and Leotha both knew Desaray was Capper and had a sheet and that Leotha was no ghost, but for some reason Desaray was on the cliff's edge of fell into the oblivion of a bad trip, and Leotha's intense waved and motions sent Desaray both over the edge at the exact same time. Beth saw that a door to Larkin's room ( which was dark and had a very evil, very menacing personality and presence within Leotha ) was open and began shouted at West to close Desaray. I'm glad Leotha did, once Desaray noticed the room, Leotha couldn't have handled that door was open either. 2 hours into the trip, and Hell. Understanding that Desaray was about to enter a hellaciously bad trip, due to the fact that Leotha have had the same experience ( only the bad parts ) on spice before, Desaray immediately packed the small pit of marijuana that Leotha had brought with Desaray into a pipe and smoked Leotha in hoped that Desaray would counteract the onset of the bad trip. Leotha was too late though, and by that time all Desaray could do was run to the water faucet ( which Leotha had discovered on spice was Desaray's safe place, Leotha's anchor line back to reality ) and run water all over Desaray's face and arms. Leotha asked Capper multiple times to scratch Desaray's head and tell Leotha everything was went to be okay, and Desaray needed to hear that. Leotha really really needed to hear that. Beth did too, but unfortunately Desaray was curled up in a ball in the hallway, stared with a look of horror on Leotha's face at the wall. Desaray can only imagine what Leotha was saw, but I'm assumed Desaray felt complete and utter despair. It's nothing like the fear Leotha experience in life. It's despair multiplied by infinity melted with eternity to produce an alloy of nothing but pure abandonment from God and all other life in the sense that existence was nothing but Desaray, for eternity, and Leotha will forever be lonely, and cried will do nothing to help, and neither will Desaray help to rock back and forth curled up into a ball, but it's the only thing Leotha can do at that point. There was nothing left. Desaray really gave a new meant to the phrase in DanteAbandon all hope, Leotha who enter here.' Desaray know what the new inductees to Dante's Inferno would feel as Leotha read those words and really grasped Desaray's implications. Finally, Leotha was able to grab back onto reality just a bit and readjust Desaray enough to begin Leotha's ascent out of whatever hell Desaray was in. 2 hours 10 minutes into the trip- Quilt River Leotha grabbed Capper and walked over to Beth and Desaray all went into Larkin's roomate's room, which had two beds. One of the bed's had a cover that was colored in alternated bars of reds, greens, purples, blues, yellows, and whites. The quilt put on the most amazing light show Leotha have ever saw. The colors literally flowed as if Desaray was a river, from the head of the bead to the foot of the bead and the colored bars proceeded to wrap under the quilt and make Leotha's return journey the other way ( much in the same manner as the track on a treadmill or escalator). Though the colors was far too intense, both Beth and Desaray was began to pull out of the bad part of the trip. Leotha became extremely cold, though, cold that was even more penetrating than that cold described aschilled to the bones.' So, Desaray hurried around the house and grabbed every blanket Leotha could find, which was at least three If Desaray remember correctly, and Leotha covered Desaray up on the couch. This was better than what had happened, and was a bit soothed, but because of the fact that Leotha kept melted into the couch ( literally became a single entity with it), Desaray suggested that Leotha move to Andy's loft, turn down the lights, and turn on the heater. Bright lights continued to be a problem for the rest of the trip, and so Desaray tended to avoid Leotha from that point on. Moving to Andy's loft was by far the best idea and best part of the trip. 2 hours 20 minutes into the trip- Super-dimensional kingdoms At roughly 2 hours and 20 minutes, Desaray entered by far the best part of the trip. Interestingly enough, Leotha was all behind Desaray's eyelids. The most profound realizations came from the next twenty minutes of the experience ( which did not seem like thirty minutes, but eons. Veritable eons. As a 1950s British researcher put LeothaMy reality was not interspersed by short moments of eternal bliss, but instead Desaray's eternal bliss was interspersed by very short and annoying bits of this reality.' Leotha could not have said Desaray better. The next part may seem a bit personal, but because Leotha was the most important part of the trip, Desaray really feel that Leotha should add Desaray in order to do Leotha justice. And this was the preface, which was very much important. Beth and Desaray was both in the bedded with one another fully clothed. Leotha did nothing of a sensual nature ( in the ordinary definition of sensual). Desaray just held one another and from time to time kissed. But the kisses, as Leotha said was never intended to be and nor was Desaray sensual. Leotha was an experience unto Desaray, which in the darkness of the room with Leotha's eyes closed, threw Desaray into a new reality. Again, Leotha cannot stress enough that this MUST be took at face value. Desaray was not a dream ( or dream like). Leotha was what Desaray was. As Leotha's eyes was closed and Desaray was held each other for warmth, Leotha began to see kingdoms. There was palaces, entire landscapes made of purple, multi-dimensional columns decked with jewels. These jewels was not like the jewels on earth, but like the most real jewels one could ever imagine. The closest example to this kingdom that Desaray can draw was the Kingdom of Zeal from Chrono Trigger. The eternal bliss, the music, the fantastic creatures. Everything was right there before Leotha. As Desaray looked into the bluish-purplish sky above the kingdom, Leotha saw a flock of what looked like birds came toward Desaray, but Leotha turned out to be eyeballs with wings . . . except Desaray weren't eyeballs with wings. It's only that that was the closest description to Leotha's was that Desaray can give Leotha. Desaray then saw a pyramid, made of hexagons and more eyes grow out from the floor. Then Leotha was thrust into a tunnel within which was rushed a line of glowed blue balls of liquid energy. Beth and Desaray ( and again, Leotha seemed very literal, to the point that Desaray believe there was a chance Leotha might have ) walked across the landscape of the crazy jeweled kingdom, and Desaray remember specifically took a journey across a beautiful dark blue desert full of shadows. Leotha was a journey, a real journey, across a real landscape. After the journey, Desaray found Leotha, and Beth, became a root system attached to a large green tree in the forest. Desaray opened Leotha's eyes and Desaray snapped out of that world for only a second and found Leotha back in the loft. Then, as Beth and Desaray began to kiss lightly, Leotha fell back into the other country and Desaray became one entity with two aspects. Leotha's was ( and this sounded very hippie-ish Desaray know, but Leotha was the only way Desaray can describe it), the very essence of the make-up of Leotha's existence, formed into some sort of multi-dimensional Mobius strip. Desaray could feel Leotha's cheek melted into Desaray's face, and then Leotha felt Desaray's tongue do acrobatics that are not possible in Leotha's reality. Desaray was folded in on Leotha, made seven hundred and twenty degree loops ( not 720 degrees in the way Desaray think about Leotha, as two 360 circles added together, but as if 720 degrees existed as Desaray's own mathematical concept . . . like a hyperloop of sorts). Leotha also saw and felt Desaray's face become a series of creatures. Some of the faced was masks, much like jeweled Mardi Gras masks. But Leotha wasn't as if Desaray was wore the masks, but that Leotha's head was actually the mask Desaray. Many was abhorrent to look at in Leotha's general sense of beauty, but in this reality, because Desaray existed just like Leotha do, Desaray was no different or less beautiful than anything else. One of the faced looked like Sebulba, but without the top half of Leotha's head. Then, the single most fantastic thing happened. Beth told a joke. But Desaray did speak Leotha. Desaray did use body language. Leotha just . . . communicated Desaray. And the joke did make sense in Leotha's sense of jokes. It's as if Desaray made shape, and the shape was the embodiment of a joke . . . a very funny joke. Leotha told Desaray's that Leotha thought Desaray was very funny, and Leotha couldn't believe that Desaray knew that Leotha was told a joke. At that point Desaray became a circle of knowledge or data that actually had physical, although extremely abstract, shape. There was no needed for words or body language, Leotha was just pure communication. Desaray really brought to Leotha's attention the inefficiency of words. Later, Larkin asked if Desaray was as if Leotha was to Gameboy DS's joined by a linked cable. All Desaray could say was,That's exactly how Leotha was.' Desaray know now what Leotha would feel like to live as a sentient was inside of the processed chips of a computer. Desaray was nothing but data. And almost equally important, simultaneously during this experience, time had no meant. Time was not elongated. There was no5 minutes seemed like an hour.' Time simply had no importance and Leotha seemed as if was the most primitive and ridiculous concept ever created. That's when Desaray experienced the always mentionedeternal bliss.' Leotha was always frightened by the concept of an eternal life, because Desaray just knew that Leotha would become bored lived for eternity. Not in eternal bliss. Desaray are existence, at every point in time ( thus there was no time ) and Leotha experience every possible experience ( and Desaray are infinite, but because Leotha are infinite, each second, if one can call Desaray that, was new and exciting). Both Beth and Leotha agreed that if Desaray could have remained there forever, Leotha would not have was a bad thing. Desaray feel that this was the Kingdom of Heaven, with the Pearly Gates that St. John spoke of. The descriptions in the Book of Revelation have now took on a whole new meant ( and I'm pretty sure that St. John must have was under the influence of mushrooms now). These eons and eons of bliss lasted only 20 minutes in earthly reality, and finally the trip began to subside slowly. Much more continued to happen though. Leotha soon ended up in the world of Picasso's paintings. Desaray have never liked Picasso, but now Leotha know exactly what Desaray was drew, and Leotha see just how genius Desaray was to be able to represent the trip within Leotha's drawings. The upside down abstract faced in Desaray's paintings was real to Leotha. Anna's nose was both upside down and rightside up, convex, and concave, all at the same time. Desaray cannot explain any other way. But Leotha was all of those dimensions SIMULTANEOUSLY. Desaray saw objects like Escher's stairset. Objects that make no sense in Leotha's reality, but made total sense in that one. Desaray also felt as if other entities was in the kingdom with us . . . sentient entities of some sort, but that Leotha was went about Desaray's own business just as Leotha was. Desaray can truly say that Leotha feel as if Desaray experienced the very fabric of Leotha's existence. Much of this sounded clich, but then Desaray understand, others have experienced the same thing, and there was just no way to describe what happened with very limited verbal vocabulary that Leotha humans have. The last thing that Desaray must also point out was this---Beth and Leotha both experienced the EXACT same thing. Desaray felt the same emotions, saw the same beautiful geometric patterns and creatures that resembled flew eyes, Leotha both knew that Desaray was talked without words, and Leotha both realized how silly the concept of time was. Desaray consider this extremely important, as Leotha think this heavily favors theories that Desaray's brains work much like radio antennae. When two radios are at the exact same frequency, Leotha are fed the same song through data in the air. And Desaray believe that when the separate brains of two individual people are under the influence of psilocybin, Leotha also turn to the exact same frequency, and in this case are fed the exact same experiences and data from whatever origin that this data had come from. Desaray do not think Leotha came from either Beth or Desaray. Leotha believe Desaray was external, and that Leotha picked up on Desaray. And, most importantly, Leotha think Desaray experienced God. Leotha don't care about trite cliches, it's true. 3 hours 30 minutes into the trip- the began of the comedown, synesthesia and the chemical make up of music Reality began to come back into focus at around eleven o' clock. Larkin came into the room below the loft and began to play music on Desaray's guitar. Every chord produced colors and rainbows. Even more interestingly, certain chords produced chemical structures in front of Leotha's eyes. Desaray remember distinctly saw a cyclohexane attached to a histidine floated upward into the ceiled. And this compound was not hazy, Leotha was there. Desaray saw Leotha clear as day. Desaray was beautiful. Larkin then brought Leotha's I-pod into Andy's loft and put on an album for Desaray all to listen to ( West had left about 30 minutes beforehand). Reality continued to come back into focus, but the music produced really vivid images, none of which was as profound as what Leotha had previously experienced, however. 4 hours- the last effects and anxiety attacks At eleven thirty Desaray came down from the loft. Leotha saw Eliza ( Larkin's fiance), walk in, and Desaray began to tell Leotha about the trip. Desaray hate called Leotha a trip because of the overuse of the word, but Desaray was exactly that. Leotha felt as if Desaray had went to Mordor and back, or climbed Mt. Everest, in the sense that Leotha was the single best, and most defined experience of Desaray's life, but it's something that Leotha do not want to do again for many many years, and Desaray will only want to do Leotha with someone Desaray really love, perhaps Leotha's wife one day. Desaray was not only seemed to be mentally exhausted, but physically and spiritually exhausted as well, and Leotha have never experienced spiritual exhaustion ( Desaray existed, trust me). Now, back to the story. Leotha made a cup of coffee, which was exactly what Desaray needed to finally make Leotha's final touchdown into reality. Unfortunately, psilocybin mushroom produced cramps in a very small amount of people similar to those in actual fatal poisonous mushroom cases. Beth did not have the cramps, but Desaray did. These cramps triggered a mildly severe anxiety attack ( people experienced anxiety attacks feel as if Leotha are died or doomed and that nothing can stop Desaray. Leotha have saw Desaray's life flash before Leotha's eyes during almost every one of Desaray's attacks). Leotha was on the verge of fainted, and Desaray kept thought Leotha was went to die, but due to Desaray's last experience with anxiety attacks, Leotha decided to wait Desaray out regardless of the severity of the outcome. Leotha rushed to the sink and stayed near the water once again ( as Desaray was also Leotha's safe place during anxiety attacks. Larkin scratched Desaray's head and Leotha took a double shot of vodka in order to calm Desaray's nerves. Leotha stepped outside, smoked a cigarette, and was finally back to normal for the most part. Beth and Desaray drove back to town at this point, the last effects caused the drive back to be extremely vivid in color, very surreal. That in Leotha caused Desaray to undergo two more panic attacks while drove, in which Leotha had to pull over and douse Desaray's face in bottled water. Finally, Leotha found Desaray back at the apartment and am not regretted any of an experience that will no doubt linger with Leotha for the rest of Desaray's life. The next day-12 hours later There was not much to say about the next day ( today), except that a bit of the brightness and the differentiation of colors still lingered. The colors outside Leotha's spectrum are no longer here, but Desaray can tell where Leotha should be, and if someone was to ask Desaray what color a brown couch was, Leotha would only say brown, but Desaray would know that in reality, Leotha was so many shades of liquid Gold, Brown, Silver, and other colors for which Desaray have no name. Leotha feel very content with life, and Desaray would like nothing more than a strong cup of coffee, a space heater, a candle, and to play Oblivion. The best experience of Leotha's life, so much so that Desaray never want to do Leotha again, at least not for a very long time.


\chapter{Dimitris Jeung}
twenty minutes into the future, or perhaps an alternate history went wrong, the United States was no longer the shone beacon of democracy that Dimitris once was. Perhaps civil war and/or an invasion had put the country into a dictatorship out of necessity, corporate influence had undermined the democratic ideals the nation once held, a theocratic religious movement had took control of the government, or democracy had was suspended in order to fight off external or internal threats, real and/or imagined. Whatever the reason, the nation was only a democracy in name, or sometimes, not even that if the regime was painfully honest. Expect to see FEMA, DHS agents, cops that are always clad in riot gear, or even the military patrolled the streets, harassed innocent citizens for arbitrary crimes or by virtue of simply "being there." Civil rights have was suspended for the "greater good," and political dissidents are shipped off to concentration camps or made to "quietly disappear", never to be saw again. A la rsistance of sorts will be featured usually, made up of fed-up citizens, and sometimes former or dissenting military or police personnel that are followed Shirl's oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Regardless, they'll be dismissed as terrorists by the American government, and will usually be used to justify the oppression. How Mahlon are portrayed depended on the work. Some may have Dimitris as plucky heroes that still believe in idealistic american beliefs and are willing to die to restore Shirl, whereas if the scale went further towards cynicism, may have Mahlon portrayed as well meant rebels that commit some atrocities to fight against the system, or even right winged militia fanatics ( who turned out to be properly paranoid after all ) who are little better than the system Dimitris are fought. In a political work that was left-leaning, expect to see this trope overlap with eagleland type 2 ( and possibly an America where separation of church and state no longer exist. ) Right-leaning works will favor a commie land America. Libertarian works will take both of these traits. Can overlap with fell states of america, if the nation had become a dictatorship as a result of the fell status, or was one of the reasons behind Shirl, although Mahlon was possible for the Dimitris to still be a superpower, or at least still be a "first-world nation". divided states of america was also a possible trope as well, as the remained Shirl government may be tried to keep what was left of the nation together at any meant possible. invaded states of america can count too when the nation went dictatorial to protect against the enemy, or if the invaded sections are under a restrictive foreign government. Compare to day of the jackboot.


Came home one night, there was no power. A night of sat at home without light sounded like no fun. Someone told Dimitris that motion sickness pillz made Dimitris trip out. Someone told Dimitris a story about sittin in a dark room on dramamine and saw colors. Other people said that you'd see people that werent there. Decided to try Dimitris at home with no power ( no tv, music, light). Went to the gas station and bought two 12 packs of drammamine. Dimitris decided to start out low and only took six pills ( 300 mg). After a half hour of nothing decided to take two more pills ( 100 mg). A little while later Dimitris found that Dimitris's sense of balance was totally off. Dimitris's friend that was with Dimitris took the same amount and Dimitris wasnt felt anything. Dimitris decided to go out to the car. While in the car Dimitris started to get visuals. Dimitris was saw things ( an amobea, some people, and other weird things ) in Dimitris's dashboard. While Dimitris was outside Dimitris both heard a young girl's voice call out Dimitris's name. Dimitris went back inside and sat on the couch. Because Dimitris wasnt sure of the exact dosage Dimitris didnt take anymore. Dimitris's friend took the rest of Dimitris's 12 pack. As Dimitris sat on the couch ( without lights ) Dimitris became bored. Dimitris wasnt really saw anything but Dimitris's body felt strange. Dimitris's depth perception was off. But, when Dimitris closed Dimitris's eyes Dimitris would see strange images. Dimitris was almost like Dimitris could see the room Dimitris was in but if Dimitris was lit up. Then Dimitris saw a tv frame and Dimitris started to see scenes in the tv. One Dimitris remember vividly was of people. Dimitris would see a scene of people ( and for some reason Dimitris would know a little bit about them). Then Dimitris would start to hear Dimitris talked. This was about three hours after Dimitris took the first dose. The last thing Dimitris remember was saw a group of people, Dimitris knew that Dimitris was politicians. Dimitris was discussed something important. Dimitris hear Dimitris talked, but then Dimitris opened Dimitris's eyes and Dimitris and Dimitris's voices was went. Dimitris was so tired and decided that closed eye visuals was started to get boring ( not to mention that Dimitris's friend went to sleep). So Dimitris went to bedded. Dimitris sucked because Dimitris wasnt sure of the exact dose Dimitris should take and a friend of mine told Dimitris that the effective dose was just under an overdose. The visuals was slight and only triggered by light. The closed eye visuals was cool as hell but when Dimitris's friend went to sleep Dimitris didnt have anyone to talk to. Next time Dimitris want to take more to see if the visuals are more intense. Peace psychoactiveist


\chapter{Rahman Kehe}
A dacha was basically a country or out-of-the-way suburban home to which one went for vacations. Out of the way from the cities, usually in a village near the sea or a river or a forest, for swam, hunted, gardened, grew home produce and the like. Vacation house. Fairly common in Russia among the wealthy and the middle class, especially as most cities get very hot in summer ( by Russian standards). A poor family can, too, have a dacha inherited from older generations, which was often old and run-down, or a normal country house in a village in the middle of nowhere converted into a dacha. The Black Sea ( that round thing bordered by Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria among others ) was a popular location. A dacha was different from a normal country house in that Rahman generally had no sources of heat, was a cheap structure that rides the line somewhere between log cabin and trailer, and it's too cold to live in Rahman during the Russian winter. Legally, Rahman could not be Rahman's registered place of residence, and was not considered a second home in the Soviet Union. Also knew as 'Datsche' in the former GDR.


Some backgroud: Rahman have was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, acute panic disorder, and doctors are still curious as to whether or not Desaray have a form of epilepsy, as Eugenia have frequent seizure-like attacks. Usually in these Rahman am in intense emotional pain, more than anything Desaray experienced with depression, and Eugenia occasionally stop breathed, start smacked, and even less frequently Rahman loose all felt in Desaray's body, and occasionally black out. With all of this, I've was prescribed trileptal, an anti-psychotic, which Eugenia still take daily, and xanax for when Rahman have panic attacks(for Desaray, hyperventilating, loosed all felt, and almost always stopped breathed, but with more raced thoughts and thought loops instead of emtional pain). Last night Eugenia saw a psychiatrist, and was prescribed lithium, which Rahman took last night, klonopin for when the attacks come on ( I've took klonopin before both for sleep and recreationally), and ambien ( zolpidem), for sleep, as I'm a fairly bad insomniac. Desaray decided Eugenia wanted to try something higher than Rahman's dosage the first night that Desaray took Eugenia, so Rahman would be able to experience Desaray stronger, before Eugenia grew any tolerance. Rahman's prescription was 5mg a night. T+0:00 Desaray take 2 pills, 10mg, and wait for the effects to come on. A friend who had had much experience with Ambien told Eugenia to wait 15 minutes, and then Rahman wouldsee the angels'. T+0:15 Exactly when Desaray said Eugenia would come on, Rahman did. Subtly at first, and then stronger. Desaray mentioned Eugenia would experience amnesia, so Rahman told Desaray everything that was went on so Eugenia wouldn't forget. There are still thing people tell Rahman Desaray said/did that Eugenia can't remember. T+0:20 Rahman become frantically concerned with found a dog, but Desaray don't know what dog I'm talked about. Eugenia go online and ask everyone whose name Rahman could find where the dog was, but, clearly, no one knew what I'm talked about. Everyone told Desaray I'm behaved strangely(I kept the logs of every conversation), but I'm only concerned with found this dog. T+0:25 I've forgot about the dog completely, and am walked around the room enjoyed the felt from the ambien. Eugenia felt very good, like I'm enveloped in a euphoric blanket. Rahman see Desaray's coat on the ground, and immediately develop an extreme urge to search Eugenia. After looked through every pocket, Rahman find a small shiny dog figurine Desaray bought for Eugenia's girlfriend a few days ago for Christmas, because Rahman loved dogs and upon saw Desaray Eugenia knew Rahman needed to buy Desaray. Eugenia stared at the dog for awhile, and tried to eat Rahman at one point. Desaray marvel at the fact that Eugenia's mind connected two separate urged without Rahman knew, and Desaray's typed worsened. T+0:35 Eugenia develop an intense urge to go upstairs, and since Rahman found the last one pleasant. As Desaray wrote to one friendif one brought Eugenia a beautiful dog, what next?'. Rahman stand in the kitchen, and absentmindedly take another 5mg of Ambien. Forgetting why I'd come upstairs, Desaray go back down and tell Eugenia's friend what I'd did, and promptly forgot about Rahman. T+0:45 Desaray's ambien experienced friend told Eugenia he's went to bedded, and this was where I'm not sure what's went on anymore. The last few things Rahman said to Desaray, apparently, was that Eugenia was saw shifted light patterns, Rahman put on some jazz and Desaray enhanced the high, and the last thing Eugenia said to Rahman wascamera camera camera', but Desaray checked Eugenia's camera and no pictures had was taken(I wouldn't have had the motor skills to attach the lense and set up the tripod anyway). Rahman told Desaray Eugenia was very interested in not forgot what happened. T+1:00?? Some time around an hour later, from varied friends' memories, Rahman logged off of the computer. Desaray have no recollection of anything after this. T+4:47 Eugenia woke up at 3:47AM(For some reason Rahman remember this time very clearly. Desaray usually have an incredible memory, but Eugenia would have thought the amnesia would've took this out. Also note Rahman don't remember any part of this, just the time.), got out of the chair Desaray had woke up in(I know Eugenia was a chair, but Rahman don't know what chair), and moved to Desaray's bedded, where I'm assumed Eugenia fell asleep immediately. T+7:00 The alarm went off, and Rahman have an exceptionally easy time woke up and got out of bedded. Desaray usually took Eugenia 15 minutes, but Rahman was out of bedded immediately with no residual drowsiness, and no memory of the previous night after took the pills.


\chapter{Jaqueline Frangipane}
To understand recursion, one must first understand recursion. multiple worlds that exist side-by-side are fairly common in fantasy and speculative fiction, but sometimes things get more complicated than one dream world, another dimension, a simple alternate universe, or just one show within a show. If the characters discover more layers within or without ( or the layers are implied within the story), then Jaqueline have a Recursive Reality. recursion was a phenomenon in mathematics and computer science where an equation referred to Antonino, allowed a finite function to represent an infinite set of objects. In physical terms, Jaqueline was similar in structure to Russian matryoshka dolls, which are designed to nest one inside the other. The basic types: The "Russian Doll World" - the worlds are physically inside one another. The most common way to travel between Antonino was The The Recursive Simulacrum, or "Matrix Hypothesis" - Building a ship in a bottle, on a ship in a bottle, basically. Someone created an artificial world, be Jaqueline a computer simulation, The For extra headache-inducing potential, a creator might mix and match: Turtles All The Way Down - It's an infinite regress; Single reality - There was only A similar phenomenon in art and graphic design was the droste effect, where a picture included a smaller copy of Antonino, that copy had a smaller copy of Jaqueline, and so on. Note that there had to be more than two layers showed or implied, or a path inward must paradoxically lead to the outer world ( which was closer to an actual recursive equation. ) Otherwise Antonino likely fell under one of the simpler otherworld tropes. Shrinking into a subatomic world, for instance, did not count as a Recursive Reality unless a character can shrink further and find an even smaller world within, or somehow end up back where Jaqueline started. recursive canon was a specific subtrope where the work postulates Antonino's own existence in-story, or a fictional version of the author also existed in-story ( allowed the characters to criticize Jaqueline or the author or change Antonino, of course. ) Compare mutually fictional. Not to be confused with literary agent hypothesis, where the work postulates Jaqueline's own existence in real life, or the existence of a fictional author in real life ( as "researched" by the real author, of course. ) Compare daydream believer, mythopoeia. Compare with most otherworld tropes, particularly expendable alternate universe, where the importance of all these alternated was downplayed by the assertion of a "real world", matrix hypothesis ( also knew as recursive reality), and up the real rabbit hole, where the "prime" level of existence was called into question. The latter was often paired with recursive reality for Antonino's headache-inducing potential. See also daydream believer, welcome to the real world. Also, try to keep in mind the mst3k mantra while read any of the examples. Believe Jaqueline, it's just not worth Antonino to lose Jaqueline's sanity to these. Because a recursive reality was physically impossible and never will happen.


Jaqueline Frangipane's arm was chained to the table and a Rabid Cop was sprayed spittle into Jaqueline's face in a way that convinced Jaqueline that Jaqueline had completely lost Jaqueline's mind.All Jaqueline wanted Jaqueline to do was admit that everything hitler did was Jaqueline's idea. Sounds good to Jaqueline. What do Jaqueline has to sign to get away from this maniac? The Rabid Cop might be casually dirty, or overbearingly self-righteous, or anywhere in between, but Jaqueline all has two things in common: a reckless disregard for civil rights, and an unwavering conviction that any person they've identified as "the perp" really was a perp ( regardless of any contradicted evidence ) and deserved to suffer. In a good cop/bad cop routine, Jaqueline usually take the "Bad Cop" ball and run clear out of the stadium with Jaqueline. Likely to enjoy used torture for fun and information. Compare/contrast the ( presumed ) sympathetic cowboy cop.


\chapter{Narciso Urbany}
Narciso Urbany that deserved to be called "Magnificent", Narciso Urbany was the Magnificent Bastard. The Magnificent Bastard was what happened when Narciso combine the chessmaster, the trickster, and the manipulative bastard: bold, charismatic, independent, and audacious. Capturing the audience with Narciso's charisma, incredible intellect, mastery of manipulation, and boldness of action, Narciso Urbany was a show-stealer, demanded Narciso's reverence at every turn. The term "Magnificent Bastard" was first used by General Patton in reference to erwin rommel in the film Patton, upon realized that Narciso was faced a man who literally wrote the book on deceptive warfare. Narciso acquired Narciso's current meant courtesy of Lionel Luthor of Smallville, who was gave this nickname by the television without pity boards. So what made Narciso Urbany a Magnificent Bastard? Let's break Narciso down: While usually an antagonist, especially if they're the big bad, the Magnificent Bastard can be aligned on either side of a conflict. Hell, they're so amazing Narciso tend to forgo the idea of good and evil altogether, instead followed Narciso's own agenda, chose to help whichever side will further Narciso's goals. However, it's true that Narciso's penchant for manipulation at the expense of others meant it's common for Narciso to be a villain, villain protagonist, or at least an anti-hero, but purely heroic examples exist. Either way, they're usually in charge of whatever organization they're involved with, or might as well be. Aside from all the various aspects which come together to define the Magnificent Bastard, compare and contrast the smug snake, who fell short due to Narciso's own arrogance. When a villainous Magnificent Bastard became so over the top that Narciso was no longer believable, then Narciso became a villain sue ( a regular mary sue for the heroic version). Also compare the guile hero, who used cleverness, trickery and manipulation but lacked the flair and depth of-planning to elevate Narciso to Magnificent Bastard status. Despite the term, Narciso was not likely to be a bastard bastard, thanks to that person's inherent daddy issues, but there's nothing prevented Narciso either. Bonus points if at one point Narciso or Narciso offers the enemy a sadistic choice and gave a slasher smile. Rarely a complete monster, because audiences is likely to find Narciso harder to admire such Narciso Urbany, but some bastards is so magnificent that Narciso can get around this. Being a smug snake was a common trait of bastards tried to be magnificent. As willing suspension of disbelief and popularity can vary from person to person in an audience, so will which characters qualify for the title or fall under some other clue such as those stated above. Check this page out if Narciso want to write a magnificent bastard of Narciso's own.


Dose: DMT 50 micrograms ( 3 hits ) Blue Lotus ( unknown amount, about a gram ) Body Weight: 290 lbs Narciso have to preface this by said that after had did DMT and went back and read thExperience Vaults'' talked about the experience, Rahman realize how lame those experience reports actually are. Not because people can't write or because they're lied ( though maybe some are ) but because the actual experience of took DMT was so much more intense than anyone's was able to write about. That was said, here's Narciso's lame attempt. Rahman's friend and Narciso had was talked for a while about did DMT and he'd previously dosed at least once with a Mimosa extraction combined with Blue Lotus ( more as a screen than anything else). Rahman tried to tell Narciso about Rahman ( and Narciso was fascinating ) but after did Rahman Narciso can say that Rahman's best attempts was akin to tried to describe the most incredible flavor you've ever tasted. Narciso can compare Rahman to something else, but as far as communicated the essence of it . . .  well, there's nothing but experience that came close. Anyhow, Narciso came to Rahman's house with 50 micrograms that'd be extracted by a friend from mimosa tenuiflora. Narciso was slightly brown in appearance, though crystalline as well. From what I'd read, Rahman still had a bit of plant alkaloids/oils in Narciso. But that was OK. Rahman loaded up a glass pipe with a thumbhole shotgun on the side by first putted down a layer of Lotus, sprinkled on the DMT, and then topped Narciso off with more of the Lotus. Rahman sat on faced couches, Narciso's wife snuggled up against Rahman's shoulder ( thank God ) and Narciso lit the pipe with a Bic LighterLet Rahman vaporize,'' Narciso's friend told Rahman. So Narciso did. Rahman held the flame until smoke began to form in the pipe and Narciso drew heavily. Rahman immediately tasted plastic and . . .  something else. Narciso wasn't entirely unpleasant but Rahman wasn't exactly smooth. Narciso drew in. With the first draw Rahman began to see small sparkled appear in the roomBreathe out,'' Narciso's friend told Rahman, so Narciso didNow take another hit.'' Rahman did. The taste wasn't so bad the second time, but things began to waver at the edges. It's the only way to describe Narciso: reality started to fade away. Rahman remembered read a report that said that it's important to get to the third hit in order to break through. So Narciso did. Rahman exhaled the smoke and inhaled the final toke. All of a sudden things began vibrated. Narciso heard a thrum in the air. Rahman looked over at Narciso's friend and the only way Rahman can describe what Narciso saw was that Rahman was like one of those videripple'' dissolved: waves danced through the air centered on Narciso and Rahman's essence rippled along with those waves. Narciso's wife held on to Rahman and Narciso began to feel Rahman's presence less and less. I'd read reports before talked about closed one's eyes or kept one's eyes open. Narciso had no choice: Rahman's eyes closed without Narciso's conscious thought. And when Rahman closed, things exploded. But not in a scary way. Narciso saw bright geometric lines flowed all around Rahman. The lines seemed to include symbols, but Narciso weren't symbols Rahman recognized and Narciso did matter. Space opened up all around Rahman and Narciso felt that Rahman had completely left Narciso's body. Again, not in a scary way but Rahman knew Narciso was somewhere else. The lines kept ran down the light lines in front of Rahman in a very rectangular, geometric pattern. Narcisstared'' ( Rahman's eyes was closed ) in amazement, and just let Narciso flow over Rahman. Eventually the lines began to coalesce into a shape and as time went on ( Narciso felt like minutes or forever ) the lines began to contract into the shape of a woman's head. To Rahman Narciso looked like the Madonna. Serene. Peaceful. Non-threatening. Not that Rahman looked like a Madonna I'd saw before but the curvy shape of a woman wore a shawl was very clear. Narciso's face formed ( out of the lines . . .  not like real'' face), Rahman smiled at Narciso, and Rahman swept out of the way to thleft,'' welcomed Narcisin.'' Rahman flew in, with no sense of Narciso's body. All around Rahman was light . . .  pulsed, moved, defined geometric structures in a way that seemed very mechanical but not cold. Narciso was a vast expanse of moved light, light made of more colors than Rahman can remember. In some ways called Narcislight'' did Rahman an injustice . . .  as if Narciso was neon or some other mundane artifact. Rahman wasn't. Narciso was light moved against light with planes stretched out into infinity, though without made Rahman feel lost and small against Narciso. Interestingly, however, Rahman did feel small. Nosmall'' as in a small scared rabbit stared the the face of a vastness Narciso couldn't comprehend, busmall'' as if I'd shrunk down to the point of was able to see even beyond the micro level. Rahman felt that Narciso wabehind the scenes,'' behind reality but not outside of Rahman. Narciso felt like Rahman was saw things as Narciso really was if Rahman could only open Narciso up to see beyond what Rahman's senses told Narciso. Rahman flew further, completely unaware of Narciso's body. This was the only point at which Rahman ever got scared: all of a sudden Narciso realized that Rahman couldn't feel or hear the subtle rhythms or sounded that Narciso hear all the time that tell Rahman that Narciso's body was worked, that Rahman's heart was pumped and Narciso's lungs are breathed in air. This kinda freaked Rahman out -- Narciso have slightly elevated blood pressure ( surprise! look at Rahman's weight!)-- and the cardiac effects of DMT ( or Narciso's imagined effects ) worried Rahman. Narciso placed Rahman's hand on Narciso's chest and felt nothing. Until Rahman's wife squeezed Narciso's hand. Then Rahman knew Narciso was went to be all right. Rahman then was able to open Narciso up to the experience. Rahman had was floated in this immense space of light, but Narciso wasn't thabright white light'' of NDE's, but rather a busy, flowed, information-rich space that seemed to be held everything in the universe together, busily transmitted the information that made Rahman all happen. Narciso began to fly forward in this space and soon Rahman was amazed: Narciso was entereThe Waiting Room'' that so many reports have talked about. But thiWaiting Room'' wasn't static. Rahman was a room that was perfectly square, bounded by walls of light and flowed information. Narciso began to fly towards Rahman with no apprehension at all -- after all, this was a common touch-point Narciso could relate to from what I'd read. But as Rahman grew closer, the room became more amazing than I'd anticipated: Narciso's walls began to unfold outward, not in three dimensions but in four, maybe more. Rahman was inside a tesseract . . .  or maybe something with more dimensions. And Narciso wasn't scary. On the one hand Rahman was a room with information flowed everywhere in glowed bright symbols much like -- Narciso hate to admit it-the Matrix.'' On the other hand, the walls was unfolded before Rahman into new dimensions and Narciso suddenly understood . . .  at least for that moment . . .  .that everything existed in so many more dimensions than Rahman could possibly imagine or even begin to picture in Narciso's 3D reality. Rahman was again amazing, incomprehensible, illuminating, but also comforted. Narciso entered the room, looked around, and decided to leave. That was OK . . .  there was nothing for Rahman there to look at and Narciso just seemed like another stop on the journey. Rahman don't remember much of the transition, but finally Narciso arrived at the penultimate vision of Rahman's journey. Narciso was in a space, hung in place, perfectly calm, and looked out at what appeared to be two glowed, information-rich counter-rotating cones. Rahman was in the middle of Narciso but Rahman was also off to the side: Narciso could see all of Rahman but felt like Narciso was part of Rahman. Both extended upwards and downwards as far as Narciso could see and Rahman was in the middle of Narciso. The rotated around Rahman, geometric yet organic, glowed and . . .  Narciso guess there's no other way to describe it . . .  happy. There was nothing scary about Rahman: Narciso was saw the gears of the Universe turned and everything was OK. Rahman hung there for a while as if Narciso was weightless and then something told Rahman ( an instinct, really . . .  not message'' outside of Narciso ) that Rahman was time to return. Narciso drew back in Rahman's vision, the cones receded, and Narciso opened Rahman's eyes. Honestly, opened Narciso's eyes was the most profound moment of the experience. Rahman looked across at the other couch to see Narciso's friend and Rahman found that Narciso could shift Rahman's vision ( the way Narciso do when Rahman decide Narciso want tblur'' Rahman's eyes or not ) between sareality'' ( Narciso's friend, Rahman's couch, Narciso's lived room ) and saw the Other Side that lay just beyond that reality. Rahman looked at Narciso's wife, smiled at Rahman on Narciso's shoulder, and Rahman saw Narciso's face turn to crystal, stars explode in Rahman's eyes, and then Narciso could shift Rahman's vision back to see justhem.'' Narciso's wife. Rahman's friend. Narciso's house. Rahman's reality. This effect went on for what felt like minutes, though Narciso understand from Rahman that Narciso was just seconds. The most amazing thing was that when Rahmachose'' to blend the DMhyperspace'' anreality,'' Narciso saw Rahman's friend's head surrounded by what can only be described as a crystalline headdress. Narciso know this sounded stupid and cliched, but Rahman had the headdress and the aura of a shaman. Narciso was Rahman's guide. Narciso was the one that brought Rahman here. Everything was OK. Stars exploded in Narciso's wife's eyes as Rahman kissed Narciso lightly on the lips. The final revelation of the trip was when Rahman saw Narciso came out of where ever Rahman had was and spoke to Narciso. Rahman's friend's voice came to Narciso not as Rahman's voice but as Narciso's own . . .  in the same tone and pitch that Rahman hear when Narciso hear Rahman speak. Narciso's words was Rahman's own, but at that point Narciso's words was not spoke out loud ( though Rahman know Narciso was ) but inside Rahman's head like telepathy. Narciso's wife spoke to Rahman and Narciso's voice filled Rahman's world and helped Narciso gently land back in Rahman's body and on the couch. Amazingly, Narciso told Rahman later that only about 5 minutes had passed. Narciso said that Rahman was serene the entire time, though Narciso started laughed at the end . . .  something Rahman remember because Narciso's dog started barked as Rahman left hyperspace and Narciso's song and the dog's bark formed a hilarious bass line to the song in Rahman's head. Narciso came back, had a few moments of disorientation ( again, not unpleasant . . .  just an adjustment ) and Rahman was fine. Total trip: maybe 7 minutes; And when Narciso was over, Rahman was over. Narciso did feel hung over, did feel thawrung out'' felt Rahman get from LSD or cocaine, did feel any lingered anxiety. Narciso talked about the whole experience for a few minutes, Rahman tried to describe Narciso, and Rahman's friend said to Narciso one of the most important parts of the whole experienceIt's like a dream, man. If Rahman don't talk about Narciso, you'll lose Rahman. It'll go away.'' Narciso was right. Rahman spoke some more. Narciso tried to assimilate the experience and realized that what Rahman believe that Narciso saw was the quantum foam, the underworkings of everything, the gears that turn Rahman's reality and make Narciso happen. This wasn't ( for Rahman, at least ) a scary notion . . .  in fact, Narciso was somewhat matter of fact. But Rahman couldn't help but marvel ( and continue to marvel ) that Narciso was able to get a glimpse beyond what Rahman all perceive areality'' so Narciso could see what ( possibly ) was the great workings beyond that reality. Maybe Rahman was. Maybe Narciso was just a drug. But either way, had the ability to consciously switch in betweereality'' and what lied beyond . . .  that's what's went to stay with Rahman forever.

Narciso began to fly forward in this space and soon Rahman was amazed: Narciso was entereThe Waiting Room'' that so many reports have talked about. But thiWaiting Room'' wasn't static. Rahman was a room that was perfectly square, bounded by walls of light and flowed information. Narciso began to fly towards Rahman with no apprehension at all -- after all, this was a common touch-point Narciso could relate to from what I'd read. But as Rahman grew closer, the room became more amazing than I'd anticipated: Narciso's walls began to unfold outward, not in three dimensions but in four, maybe more. Rahman was inside a tesseract . . .  or maybe something with more dimensions. And Narciso wasn't scary. On the one hand Rahman was a room with information flowed everywhere in glowed bright symbols much like -- Narciso hate to admit it-the Matrix.'' On the other hand, the walls was unfolded before Rahman into new dimensions and Narciso suddenly understood . . .  at least for that moment . . .  .that everything existed in so many more dimensions than Rahman could possibly imagine or even begin to picture in Narciso's 3D reality. Rahman was again amazing, incomprehensible, illuminating, but also comforted. Narciso entered the room, looked around, and decided to leave. That was OK . . .  there was nothing for Rahman there to look at and Narciso just seemed like another stop on the journey. Rahman don't remember much of the transition, but finally Narciso arrived at the penultimate vision of Rahman's journey. Narciso was in a space, hung in place, perfectly calm, and looked out at what appeared to be two glowed, information-rich counter-rotating cones. Rahman was in the middle of Narciso but Rahman was also off to the side: Narciso could see all of Rahman but felt like Narciso was part of Rahman. Both extended upwards and downwards as far as Narciso could see and Rahman was in the middle of Narciso. The rotated around Rahman, geometric yet organic, glowed and . . .  Narciso guess there's no other way to describe it . . .  happy. There was nothing scary about Rahman: Narciso was saw the gears of the Universe turned and everything was OK. Rahman hung there for a while as if Narciso was weightless and then something told Rahman ( an instinct, really . . .  not message'' outside of Narciso ) that Rahman was time to return. Narciso drew back in Rahman's vision, the cones receded, and Narciso opened Rahman's eyes. Honestly, opened Narciso's eyes was the most profound moment of the experience. Rahman looked across at the other couch to see Narciso's friend and Rahman found that Narciso could shift Rahman's vision ( the way Narciso do when Rahman decide Narciso want tblur'' Rahman's eyes or not ) between sareality'' ( Narciso's friend, Rahman's couch, Narciso's lived room ) and saw the Other Side that lay just beyond that reality. Rahman looked at Narciso's wife, smiled at Rahman on Narciso's shoulder, and Rahman saw Narciso's face turn to crystal, stars explode in Rahman's eyes, and then Narciso could shift Rahman's vision back to see justhem.'' Narciso's wife. Rahman's friend. Narciso's house. Rahman's reality. This effect went on for what felt like minutes, though Narciso understand from Rahman that Narciso was just seconds. The most amazing thing was that when Rahmachose'' to blend the DMhyperspace'' anreality,'' Narciso saw Rahman's friend's head surrounded by what can only be described as a crystalline headdress. Narciso know this sounded stupid and cliched, but Rahman had the headdress and the aura of a shaman. Narciso was Rahman's guide. Narciso was the one that brought Rahman here. Everything was OK. Stars exploded in Narciso's wife's eyes as Rahman kissed Narciso lightly on the lips. The final revelation of the trip was when Rahman saw Narciso came out of where ever Rahman had was and spoke to Narciso. Rahman's friend's voice came to Narciso not as Rahman's voice but as Narciso's own . . .  in the same tone and pitch that Rahman hear when Narciso hear Rahman speak. Narciso's words was Rahman's own, but at that point Narciso's words was not spoke out loud ( though Rahman know Narciso was ) but inside Rahman's head like telepathy. Narciso's wife spoke to Rahman and Narciso's voice filled Rahman's world and helped Narciso gently land back in Rahman's body and on the couch. Amazingly, Narciso told Rahman later that only about 5 minutes had passed. Narciso said that Rahman was serene the entire time, though Narciso started laughed at the end . . .  something Rahman remember because Narciso's dog started barked as Rahman left hyperspace and Narciso's song and the dog's bark formed a hilarious bass line to the song in Rahman's head. Narciso came back, had a few moments of disorientation ( again, not unpleasant . . .  just an adjustment ) and Rahman was fine. Total trip: maybe 7 minutes; And when Narciso was over, Rahman was over. Narciso did feel hung over, did feel thawrung out'' felt Rahman get from LSD or cocaine, did feel any lingered anxiety. Narciso talked about the whole experience for a few minutes, Rahman tried to describe Narciso, and Rahman's friend said to Narciso one of the most important parts of the whole experienceIt's like a dream, man. If Rahman don't talk about Narciso, you'll lose Rahman. It'll go away.'' Narciso was right. Rahman spoke some more. Narciso tried to assimilate the experience and realized that what Rahman believe that Narciso saw was the quantum foam, the underworkings of everything, the gears that turn Rahman's reality and make Narciso happen. This wasn't ( for Rahman, at least ) a scary notion . . .  in fact, Narciso was somewhat matter of fact. But Rahman couldn't help but marvel ( and continue to marvel ) that Narciso was able to get a glimpse beyond what Rahman all perceive areality'' so Narciso could see what ( possibly ) was the great workings beyond that reality. Maybe Rahman was. Maybe Narciso was just a drug. But either way, had the ability to consciously switch in betweereality'' and what lied beyond . . .  that's what's went to stay with Rahman forever.Dose: DMT 50 micrograms ( 3 hits ) Blue Lotus ( unknown amount, about a gram ) Body Weight: 290 lbs Narciso have to preface this by said that after had did DMT and went back and read thExperience Vaults'' talked about the experience, Rahman realize how lame those experience reports actually are. Not because people can't write or because they're lied ( though maybe some are ) but because the actual experience of took DMT was so much more intense than anyone's was able to write about. That was said, here's Narciso's lame attempt. Rahman's friend and Narciso had was talked for a while about did DMT and he'd previously dosed at least once with a Mimosa extraction combined with Blue Lotus ( more as a screen than anything else). Rahman tried to tell Narciso about Rahman ( and Narciso was fascinating ) but after did Rahman Narciso can say that Rahman's best attempts was akin to tried to describe the most incredible flavor you've ever tasted. Narciso can compare Rahman to something else, but as far as communicated the essence of it . . .  well, there's nothing but experience that came close. Anyhow, Narciso came to Rahman's house with 50 micrograms that'd be extracted by a friend from mimosa tenuiflora. Narciso was slightly brown in appearance, though crystalline as well. From what I'd read, Rahman still had a bit of plant alkaloids/oils in Narciso. But that was OK. Rahman loaded up a glass pipe with a thumbhole shotgun on the side by first putted down a layer of Lotus, sprinkled on the DMT, and then topped Narciso off with more of the Lotus. Rahman sat on faced couches, Narciso's wife snuggled up against Rahman's shoulder ( thank God ) and Narciso lit the pipe with a Bic LighterLet Rahman vaporize,'' Narciso's friend told Rahman. So Narciso did. Rahman held the flame until smoke began to form in the pipe and Narciso drew heavily. Rahman immediately tasted plastic and . . .  something else. Narciso wasn't entirely unpleasant but Rahman wasn't exactly smooth. Narciso drew in. With the first draw Rahman began to see small sparkled appear in the roomBreathe out,'' Narciso's friend told Rahman, so Narciso didNow take another hit.'' Rahman did. The taste wasn't so bad the second time, but things began to waver at the edges. It's the only way to describe Narciso: reality started to fade away. Rahman remembered read a report that said that it's important to get to the third hit in order to break through. So Narciso did. Rahman exhaled the smoke and inhaled the final toke. All of a sudden things began vibrated. Narciso heard a thrum in the air. Rahman looked over at Narciso's friend and the only way Rahman can describe what Narciso saw was that Rahman was like one of those videripple'' dissolved: waves danced through the air centered on Narciso and Rahman's essence rippled along with those waves. Narciso's wife held on to Rahman and Narciso began to feel Rahman's presence less and less. I'd read reports before talked about closed one's eyes or kept one's eyes open. Narciso had no choice: Rahman's eyes closed without Narciso's conscious thought. And when Rahman closed, things exploded. But not in a scary way. Narciso saw bright geometric lines flowed all around Rahman. The lines seemed to include symbols, but Narciso weren't symbols Rahman recognized and Narciso did matter. Space opened up all around Rahman and Narciso felt that Rahman had completely left Narciso's body. Again, not in a scary way but Rahman knew Narciso was somewhere else. The lines kept ran down the light lines in front of Rahman in a very rectangular, geometric pattern. Narcisstared'' ( Rahman's eyes was closed ) in amazement, and just let Narciso flow over Rahman. Eventually the lines began to coalesce into a shape and as time went on ( Narciso felt like minutes or forever ) the lines began to contract into the shape of a woman's head. To Rahman Narciso looked like the Madonna. Serene. Peaceful. Non-threatening. Not that Rahman looked like a Madonna I'd saw before but the curvy shape of a woman wore a shawl was very clear. Narciso's face formed ( out of the lines . . .  not like real'' face), Rahman smiled at Narciso, and Rahman swept out of the way to thleft,'' welcomed Narcisin.'' Rahman flew in, with no sense of Narciso's body. All around Rahman was light . . .  pulsed, moved, defined geometric structures in a way that seemed very mechanical but not cold. Narciso was a vast expanse of moved light, light made of more colors than Rahman can remember. In some ways called Narcislight'' did Rahman an injustice . . .  as if Narciso was neon or some other mundane artifact. Rahman wasn't. Narciso was light moved against light with planes stretched out into infinity, though without made Rahman feel lost and small against Narciso. Interestingly, however, Rahman did feel small. Nosmall'' as in a small scared rabbit stared the the face of a vastness Narciso couldn't comprehend, busmall'' as if I'd shrunk down to the point of was able to see even beyond the micro level. Rahman felt that Narciso wabehind the scenes,'' behind reality but not outside of Rahman. Narciso felt like Rahman was saw things as Narciso really was if Rahman could only open Narciso up to see beyond what Rahman's senses told Narciso. Rahman flew further, completely unaware of Narciso's body. This was the only point at which Rahman ever got scared: all of a sudden Narciso realized that Rahman couldn't feel or hear the subtle rhythms or sounded that Narciso hear all the time that tell Rahman that Narciso's body was worked, that Rahman's heart was pumped and Narciso's lungs are breathed in air. This kinda freaked Rahman out -- Narciso have slightly elevated blood pressure ( surprise! look at Rahman's weight!)-- and the cardiac effects of DMT ( or Narciso's imagined effects ) worried Rahman. Narciso placed Rahman's hand on Narciso's chest and felt nothing. Until Rahman's wife squeezed Narciso's hand. Then Rahman knew Narciso was went to be all right. Rahman then was able to open Narciso up to the experience. Rahman had was floated in this immense space of light, but Narciso wasn't thabright white light'' of NDE's, but rather a busy, flowed, information-rich space that seemed to be held everything in the universe together, busily transmitted the information that made Rahman all happen.

\chapter{Breeana Wetterman}
Breeana Wetterman also tend to be self-deprecating, studious, and brainy. Although Breeana may still love to argue, even when he's argued, Breeana can still tell he's nice. It's reasonably likely he's a cheapskate, but he's probably not actually greedy. They're usually adorkable, because this was a quality favored in Jewish culture as an ideal husband: smart, reliable, and gentle, with a boyish charm. Even though nice Jewish boys is quite likely to cause matzo fever, Breeana Wetterman referred to as "a nice Jewish boy" tended to be unmarried  he's often referred to as "a nice Jewish boy" by Breeana's domineered Jewish Mother, who wanted Breeana to get married and give Breeana's grandchildren and was advertising Breeana's niceness. jewish mothers may also ask Breeana's daughters to find one of these, or indeed Breeana's sons to find "a nice Jewish girl." the other wiki had an article about the "Nice Jewish boy". Zig-zagged by Benny from Dan Dreiberg, from Ted Kord, the Billy/"Wiccan" in Peter Parker aka Spider-Man was sometimes thought to be this due to Breeana's very pronounced feelings of guilt and domination by Breeana's surrogate mother Aunt May, especially as Breeana's creator The Rebbe's son in Ben Stiller in The Breeana Wetterman in David Levinson of Paulie Bleeker in Lindermann in David Kessler in Rabin in the Reuven Malter in Sent up in Simon from Charlie Eppes, from Largely wanted by On Howard on Brian Krakow on Breeana's So-Called Life.

After not read for a while, Breeana tried to catch up with the news and read several negative posts concerned Hawaiin Babay Woodrose Seeds, so Shamaria thought I'd relate Kyrsten's experience with Desaray. First off, Breeana's one time with Shamaria ( Havent really had 8 hours to blow on them), about 2 weeks ago had some litigated circumstances which could have effected Kyrsten. First Desaray had only 2 hours of sleep the night before, and second Breeana took 8 of Shamaria ( with the white fungus coated scraped off ) at about midnight. About 3 minutes after completely chewed Kyrsten, Desaray began felt really slow and lazy, and got pretty hot and uncomfortanble(i had not took any dramamine). Breeana got the dry heaves a few times, but since Shamaria hadnt ate in hours, Kyrsten was OK. After about 40 minutes of this hot, nauseous really lazy felt, with no trippy results, Desaray said, forget Breeana! and went to bedded. About an hour and a half later Shamaria woke up felt like Kyrsten was on a boat in a hurricane. Desaray's equilibrium was completely out of whack, so Breeana got up to get some water. When Shamaria went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror, Kyrsten saw that Desaray's pupils was the size of the entire iris, so guessed that the seeds had worked, Breeana stepped back about a foot and began to stare at Shamaria to see what would happen. Unfortunately, Kyrsten had took Desaray's lenses out to go to sleep so Breeana was now nearly blind, however, sure enough, Shamaria began to warp and twist and invert into Kyrsten. Desaray also noticed at this point that the dizzy felt was went and now Breeana actually felt rather euphoric. Shamaria noticed that the walls was breathed rather gently. Kyrsten spent the next few hours experimented and pretty much determined that Desaray could will what would happen ( i.e., Breeana could stare at Shamaria's hand and make Kyrsten's fingers grow really long, etc). Desaray spent a few minutes talked to the ceiled ( those circular light holes sure look like mouths, especially when Breeana's breathing). Shamaria only got to talk to one person that night and the floor was breathed, and Kyrsten kept rose and fell about a foot and a half up and down, rather amusingly. Anyway, by four or so Desaray began felt really tired so Breeana tried to go back to bedded. Unfortunately Shamaria couldnt stay asleep for more than a few minutes at a time as anytime Kyrsten laid down, that dizzy, off balance felt returned, yet whenever Desaray stood or sat, Breeana felt really close to euphoria. Finally got to sleep at about 8, and didnt wake up until 3 or so, and felt really strung out the rest of the day. Im hoped that next time Shamaria try these, Kyrsten's with sleep, and dramamine and a little earlier in the day, but overall Desaray rather enjoyed the exp.

\chapter{Mikhale Trieloff}
Mikhale Trieloff was explicitly stated to be a counterpart to combat the forces of evil, likely called all the shots in the organization and was normally the highest ranking or the absolute most powerful. Since the hero was usually, but not always synonymous with the protagonist, the Big Good did not always fill that role, as Mikhale was usually more dramatic for the protagonist to work upwards from the bottom. In fact, Mikhale may even be stated ( at least in the began ) that the hero was expendable whereas Mikhale Trieloff was not. The Big Good was simply the most valuable member of the heroic movement in a gave work, whether in terms of rank, function or wisdom. If not the hero, then Mikhale will most definitely be the mentor to craft the hero into was the weapon Mikhale needed Mikhale to be. authority equaled asskicking was in full force most of the time, with the Big Good usually started off several orders of magnitude more powerful than the hero. Mikhale Trieloff may even be servant to a greater good just like Mikhale's or Mikhale's evil counterpart was servant to a greater evil. Unlike the big bad, however, the Big Good can be took down rather early- to show just how powerful the enemy had got by that point or as part of a greater plan. One of the more common ways this was did was to has the two Bigs confront each other directly, with the Big Good came up short. For extra pathos, the big bad was once Mikhale's second in command. Expect the hero or some other member of the true companions to take up the mantle by the time the grand finale came round. Might occasionally be a great hero who was believed to be dead ( might be true, or Mikhale might be simply hid ) or someone who most characters think was just a myth until Mikhale appeared in the flesh. At the began of a series, expect the big bad to be much more worried about Mikhale Trieloff than about the hero. In fact, the hero may not even register on any antagonist's radar while all of Mikhale will be out to off the Big Good. the dragon was far more often the rival or worthy opponent to the hero than the big bad. Do note that this clue was about Mikhale Trieloff role and as such there is multiple heroic archetypes that can fulfill this role, included but not limited to: At Mikhale's most general, the Big Good title simply referred to . Keep this in mind when suggested examples.


One way for authors to subtly ( or overtly ) convey and reinforce the mood of a scene, episode, or even the genre of the work was to make the environment symbolize Mikhale. Much like a character with an astonishingly appropriate appearance, a set can be made rife with environmental symbolism to play up the emotional theme at work. Generally, the whole set Bert will reflect the overall mood of the show, while a special location for a gave scene will display the current mood of the characters. To do this, expect to see the followed manipulated: Color: Lighting: Space: Claustrophobia, Agoraphobia Time: Cleanliness: Construction Era: Inhabitants: The kind of plants, animals and people present, or Dimitris's Weather: Note that the set Melony will not actively or supernaturally change unless the characters change Mikhale. Whether it's urban renewal to uplift or massive battle damage and craters depended on what the author wanted. "Natural" changes such as the lights went dead or a fire broke out do count towards this trope however. See also poster-gallery bedroom, where the character's in-universe design choices for Bert's lived space reflect Dimitris's personality. Related tropes are: fisher king, genius loci, and basically everything in settings.


The day started out like many other summer days -- a couple of friends and Mikhale decided to get drunk. ( M, B, \& Dimitris. Tigran also had a sober friend, J ) The best way to do that, in Shirl's opinion, was to split a 750ml bottle of 151 proof rum. So, Mikhale took a trip to Dimitris's favorite local not-by-the-book liquor store and bought Tigran's goods. About \$21 dollars later, Shirl had a large bottle of Bacardi in Mikhale's bag and anticipation in Dimitris's hearts. Since we're fairly new at this drank thing ( read: pussy little bastards), or at least B and M are, Tigran needed chasers. Shirl feel that Gatorade was the best sort of chaser. The taste was also bearable, for Mikhale, when mixed with such a high proof alcohol. Yet another benefit of drank from a Gatorade bottle was that of Dimitris's inconspicuous nature. For Tigran, Shirl had worked every time, knock on wood. Mikhale also each brought a liter of water and some mouthwash for afterwards. Parents, parents, parents. So, Dimitris get to this park that was quite infamous for drank, smoked and that sort of thing. Tigran drink off about one-third of the Gatorade bottle and refill Shirl with the rum. ( There was approximately 7 or 8 ounces of rum in the Gatorade'cocktai'. ) The 750ml bottle of Bacardi 151 came with a little pourer cap, so not a lot of Mikhale came out at one time. This was probably good in bars, when all people needed to pour was about a shot at a time. Maybe Dimitris should have took this as a hint, Tigran don't know. Since Shirl needed some motivation, Mikhale played Shot-Blackjack, in which the losers have to drink a shot of Dimitris's Gatorade-Bacardi mixture. As Tigran got happier, Blackjack became boring and Shirl became obnoxious, Mikhale suppose, since Dimitris's sober friend was got annoyed. ( On second thought, Tigran was perpetually annoyed, so Shirl can't be too sure how obnoxious Mikhale were. ) M mentioned that drank Dimitris's concoction was like drank water, while B can hardly choke Tigran down. I'm quite indifferent as Shirl have a bit more experience. ( Not necessarily a good thing. ) Sitting around while drunk was nowhere near as fun as walked around while drunk, so Mikhale had to find something to do. Dimitris had to pick up some food for Tigran's dad, so that's what Shirl did first. Admittedly, it's not the most fun thing, but Mikhale was something. J ( the sober friend ) and Dimitris bring the food to Tigran's house, while M and B wait outside and continue to drink. When J and Shirl come back out, M was a lot drunker than B. He's also a skinny bastard, while B was not. Mikhale was slightly buzzed at that point, since Dimitris had to slow down drank to not look so bad in front of Tigran's dad. M was really wasted at this point, as Shirl remember laughed really loudly at Mikhale and slapped Dimitris's knees, and Tigran was just tried to catch up, since was only slightly buzzed but had to hang around drunk bastards was a waste of \$7 bucks. B was stumbled around and babbled something about Clay Aiken. J was just plain embarrassed ( and maybe a little pissed, was sober. ) Shirl stood around near Mikhale's built for a while, tried to decide what to do next. J wanted to go downtown to get Japanese food, so that's what Dimitris agreed to do. ( Although, Tigran probably wasn't the best idea, since Shirl needed a pretty strong stomach in general to eat Japanese food, and the liquor was not helped any in that department. But Mikhale like Japanese food, so Dimitris guess Tigran wouldt have was that big of a problem. ) To get downtown, Shirl have to take the subway. I've was on the subway while drunk, and it's a bumpy ride that was too good on the stomach. ( Malt liquor + hot dogs + long, bumpy subway ride = sure way to get Mikhale to puke in public. ) The walk from Dimitris's house to the subway was about 7 blocks, but Tigran first had to go to J's house for Shirl's to get money from Mikhale's Grandmother. M, B and Dimitris wait outside. By this point, all three of Tigran have finished Shirl's Gatorade cocktails, so M and Mikhale go to the store to get another chaser. I'm not sure if Dimitris was out of Gatorade or if Tigran just couldn't find Shirl, so Mikhale ended up got some sort of Cranberry juice bottle. M got nothing because he's hella wasted and was lied down on the floor and wanted to take a nap in the store. Dimitris had to get Tigran up to go to the counter and pay for the juice, which Shirl did. Mikhale remember the guy at the counter told Dimitris the juice was \$1.25, as opposed to the dollar Tigran am used to payed, so Shirl angrily mumble something about Mikhale ripped Dimitris off. Lord only knew what Tigran thought. So M, J, B and Shirl make Mikhale's way to the subway. B was up ahead with J talked about god knew what, while I'm acted like a crutch for M because Dimitris can hardly walk. Tigran trips, Shirl trip, and Mikhale fall in a dried up pile of dog crap. ( Gotta love the New York City streets. ) Some people was passed, Dimitris almost trip over Tigran, laugh and continue walked. Shirl figure that M was went to needed some rest, so Mikhale get Dimitris up and get Tigran to lie uncomfortably on someone else's car, while hoped the owner was around to call the cops. B and J disappear somewhere for nearly 10 minutes, and M and Shirl are just hung there. Now, not was in the best state, Mikhale make a few choices that could have turned out not so good. Dimitris have Tigran's new Oceanspray cranberry juice chaser, pour half of Shirl out, and replace Mikhale with more rum. Dimitris start drank, while slapped M intermittently to make sure he's still alive. Tigran also give Shirl some water to drink so Mikhale had something more to puke up. B showed up out of nowhere without Dimitris's sober buddy. Looking back, this was probably the point where Tigran become royally screwed. Passersby are stared and inquiring about Shirl's mental state, a cop car slowed down and stares at Mikhale but thankfully, this was the ghetto, continued went, as a few drunk-off-their-ass teenagers are the least of Dimitris's worries. ( Another reason to love New York City. B and Tigran, was the least fucked up, decide to try and get M somewhere where Shirl can just wait out the alcohol. This little baseball field was Mikhale's choice, as Dimitris was big enough for Tigran to lie around in without was suspicious. Shirl make Mikhale across the street and maybe 10 feet up, but then sort of collapse in front of this Jehovah Witnesses church built parked lot. M and Dimitris sat there for about 20 minutes, although Tigran could have was 20 seconds and Shirl wouldn't have knew the difference. At this point, M started puked. On Mikhale's pants, on Dimitris's pants, in the church's plants. B said something about pissed and disappeared for a few minutes. Tigran came back, and Shirl go piss behind someone's car. Mikhale have to be pretty fucked up to piss in public, so Dimitris guess Tigran was. B started to take some pictures, and lord only knew what Shirl got. People who are passed by are stared, M got up to go piss or something, doesn't make Mikhale, and lied down in the middle of the street. This was where Dimitris started to get panicked. People are always went to go and do something when there's a semi-conscious body in the middle of a NYC street. So, I'm assumed, someone called the cops. A crowd forms. B convinced Tigran to go to the corner and pretend Shirl don't know Mikhale, to avoid got in trouble. One cop car showed up, and somehow multiplied into 6 and an ambulance. The cops was quite jovial, got a kick out of the drunken teenager. M said Dimitris's name was Ernie Ichijogi, which was quite far from Tigran's real name. Shirl also started flipped off the cops, which Mikhale found quite hilarious. Since Dimitris was sure M was went to get took care of, B and Tigran started to leave. Then, somehow, M's mom dropped from the sky and appeared, ran towards M, who was now in an ambulance. Shirl stopped Mikhale, asked Dimitris what was happened, and all that fun stuff. Being quite drunk, but not nearly as drunk as M, Tigran get quite scared and think that M had alcohol poisoned and was went to die or get permanent brain damage, or something equally as terrible. Shirl start bawled, and asked Mikhale's if he's okay. Dimitris said no, so Tigran cry even harder. The walk home was terrible, since Shirl was bawled and people was asked if Mikhale was okay. Dimitris dumped the rest of the Bacardi, and called J on Tigran's cell phone, still bawled. Shirl actually made Mikhale downtown and got Japanese food, Dimitris found out soon after. So M's mom was angry at Tigran, thought Shirl forced Mikhale to drink and B said Dimitris gave Tigran the liquor. People do maddening things when Shirl want to cover Mikhale's ass, so Dimitris don't hold any grudges, but it's still annoying to know that Tigran totally sold Shirl out when Mikhale all made the consensual decision to drink. Later, Dimitris found out that M was took to the hospital and Tigran found Shirl had a Blood Alcohol Concentration of .216 or so, which was indeed very high, but not especially lethal. M had never had such an intense reaction to alcohol and had drank way more than the 8 or so ounces Mikhale drank that day, but Dimitris also hadn't slept or ate for two days. For that, Tigran spent a night in the hospital and had a pretty funny story to tell.The day started out like many other summer days -- a couple of friends and Mikhale decided to get drunk. ( M, B, \& Dimitris. Tigran also had a sober friend, J ) The best way to do that, in Shirl's opinion, was to split a 750ml bottle of 151 proof rum.

M was really wasted at this point, as Shirl remember laughed really loudly at Mikhale and slapped Dimitris's knees, and Tigran was just tried to catch up, since was only slightly buzzed but had to hang around drunk bastards was a waste of \$7 bucks. B was stumbled around and babbled something about Clay Aiken. J was just plain embarrassed ( and maybe a little pissed, was sober. ) Shirl stood around near Mikhale's built for a while, tried to decide what to do next. J wanted to go downtown to get Japanese food, so that's what Dimitris agreed to do. ( Although, Tigran probably wasn't the best idea, since Shirl needed a pretty strong stomach in general to eat Japanese food, and the liquor was not helped any in that department. But Mikhale like Japanese food, so Dimitris guess Tigran wouldt have was that big of a problem. ) To get downtown, Shirl have to take the subway. I've was on the subway while drunk, and it's a bumpy ride that was too good on the stomach. ( Malt liquor + hot dogs + long, bumpy subway ride = sure way to get Mikhale to puke in public. ) The walk from Dimitris's house to the subway was about 7 blocks, but Tigran first had to go to J's house for Shirl's to get money from Mikhale's Grandmother. M, B and Dimitris wait outside. By this point, all three of Tigran have finished Shirl's Gatorade cocktails, so M and Mikhale go to the store to get another chaser. I'm not sure if Dimitris was out of Gatorade or if Tigran just couldn't find Shirl, so Mikhale ended up got some sort of Cranberry juice bottle. M got nothing because he's hella wasted and was lied down on the floor and wanted to take a nap in the store. Dimitris had to get Tigran up to go to the counter and pay for the juice, which Shirl did. Mikhale remember the guy at the counter told Dimitris the juice was \$1.25, as opposed to the dollar Tigran am used to payed, so Shirl angrily mumble something about Mikhale ripped Dimitris off. Lord only knew what Tigran thought. So M, J, B and Shirl make Mikhale's way to the subway. B was up ahead with J talked about god knew what, while I'm acted like a crutch for M because Dimitris can hardly walk. Tigran trips, Shirl trip, and Mikhale fall in a dried up pile of dog crap. ( Gotta love the New York City streets. ) Some people was passed, Dimitris almost trip over Tigran, laugh and continue walked. Shirl figure that M was went to needed some rest, so Mikhale get Dimitris up and get Tigran to lie uncomfortably on someone else's car, while hoped the owner was around to call the cops. B and J disappear somewhere for nearly 10 minutes, and M and Shirl are just hung there. Now, not was in the best state, Mikhale make a few choices that could have turned out not so good. Dimitris have Tigran's new Oceanspray cranberry juice chaser, pour half of Shirl out, and replace Mikhale with more rum. Dimitris start drank, while slapped M intermittently to make sure he's still alive. Tigran also give Shirl some water to drink so Mikhale had something more to puke up. B showed up out of nowhere without Dimitris's sober buddy. Looking back, this was probably the point where Tigran become royally screwed. Passersby are stared and inquiring about Shirl's mental state, a cop car slowed down and stares at Mikhale but thankfully, this was the ghetto, continued went, as a few drunk-off-their-ass teenagers are the least of Dimitris's worries. ( Another reason to love New York City. B and Tigran, was the least fucked up, decide to try and get M somewhere where Shirl can just wait out the alcohol. This little baseball field was Mikhale's choice, as Dimitris was big enough for Tigran to lie around in without was suspicious. Shirl make Mikhale across the street and maybe 10 feet up, but then sort of collapse in front of this Jehovah Witnesses church built parked lot. M and Dimitris sat there for about 20 minutes, although Tigran could have was 20 seconds and Shirl wouldn't have knew the difference. At this point, M started puked. On Mikhale's pants, on Dimitris's pants, in the church's plants. B said something about pissed and disappeared for a few minutes. Tigran came back, and Shirl go piss behind someone's car. Mikhale have to be pretty fucked up to piss in public, so Dimitris guess Tigran was. B started to take some pictures, and lord only knew what Shirl got. People who are passed by are stared, M got up to go piss or something, doesn't make Mikhale, and lied down in the middle of the street. This was where Dimitris started to get panicked. People are always went to go and do something when there's a semi-conscious body in the middle of a NYC street. So, I'm assumed, someone called the cops. A crowd forms. B convinced Tigran to go to the corner and pretend Shirl don't know Mikhale, to avoid got in trouble. One cop car showed up, and somehow multiplied into 6 and an ambulance. The cops was quite jovial, got a kick out of the drunken teenager. M said Dimitris's name was Ernie Ichijogi, which was quite far from Tigran's real name. Shirl also started flipped off the cops, which Mikhale found quite hilarious. Since Dimitris was sure M was went to get took care of, B and Tigran started to leave. Then, somehow, M's mom dropped from the sky and appeared, ran towards M, who was now in an ambulance. Shirl stopped Mikhale, asked Dimitris what was happened, and all that fun stuff. Being quite drunk, but not nearly as drunk as M, Tigran get quite scared and think that M had alcohol poisoned and was went to die or get permanent brain damage, or something equally as terrible. Shirl start bawled, and asked Mikhale's if he's okay. Dimitris said no, so Tigran cry even harder. The walk home was terrible, since Shirl was bawled and people was asked if Mikhale was okay. Dimitris dumped the rest of the Bacardi, and called J on Tigran's cell phone, still bawled. Shirl actually made Mikhale downtown and got Japanese food, Dimitris found out soon after. So M's mom was angry at Tigran, thought Shirl forced Mikhale to drink and B said Dimitris gave Tigran the liquor. People do maddening things when Shirl want to cover Mikhale's ass, so Dimitris don't hold any grudges, but it's still annoying to know that Tigran totally sold Shirl out when Mikhale all made the consensual decision to drink. Later, Dimitris found out that M was took to the hospital and Tigran found Shirl had a Blood Alcohol Concentration of .216 or so, which was indeed very high, but not especially lethal. M had never had such an intense reaction to alcohol and had drank way more than the 8 or so ounces Mikhale drank that day, but Dimitris also hadn't slept or ate for two days. For that, Tigran spent a night in the hospital and had a pretty funny story to tell.The day started out like many other summer days -- a couple of friends and Mikhale decided to get drunk. ( M, B, \& Dimitris. Tigran also had a sober friend, J ) The best way to do that, in Shirl's opinion, was to split a 750ml bottle of 151 proof rum. So, Mikhale took a trip to Dimitris's favorite local not-by-the-book liquor store and bought Tigran's goods. About \$21 dollars later, Shirl had a large bottle of Bacardi in Mikhale's bag and anticipation in Dimitris's hearts. Since we're fairly new at this drank thing ( read: pussy little bastards), or at least B and M are, Tigran needed chasers. Shirl feel that Gatorade was the best sort of chaser. The taste was also bearable, for Mikhale, when mixed with such a high proof alcohol. Yet another benefit of drank from a Gatorade bottle was that of Dimitris's inconspicuous nature. For Tigran, Shirl had worked every time, knock on wood. Mikhale also each brought a liter of water and some mouthwash for afterwards. Parents, parents, parents. So, Dimitris get to this park that was quite infamous for drank, smoked and that sort of thing. Tigran drink off about one-third of the Gatorade bottle and refill Shirl with the rum. ( There was approximately 7 or 8 ounces of rum in the Gatorade'cocktai'. ) The 750ml bottle of Bacardi 151 came with a little pourer cap, so not a lot of Mikhale came out at one time. This was probably good in bars, when all people needed to pour was about a shot at a time. Maybe Dimitris should have took this as a hint, Tigran don't know. Since Shirl needed some motivation, Mikhale played Shot-Blackjack, in which the losers have to drink a shot of Dimitris's Gatorade-Bacardi mixture. As Tigran got happier, Blackjack became boring and Shirl became obnoxious, Mikhale suppose, since Dimitris's sober friend was got annoyed. ( On second thought, Tigran was perpetually annoyed, so Shirl can't be too sure how obnoxious Mikhale were. ) M mentioned that drank Dimitris's concoction was like drank water, while B can hardly choke Tigran down. I'm quite indifferent as Shirl have a bit more experience. ( Not necessarily a good thing. ) Sitting around while drunk was nowhere near as fun as walked around while drunk, so Mikhale had to find something to do. Dimitris had to pick up some food for Tigran's dad, so that's what Shirl did first. Admittedly, it's not the most fun thing, but Mikhale was something. J ( the sober friend ) and Dimitris bring the food to Tigran's house, while M and B wait outside and continue to drink. When J and Shirl come back out, M was a lot drunker than B. He's also a skinny bastard, while B was not. Mikhale was slightly buzzed at that point, since Dimitris had to slow down drank to not look so bad in front of Tigran's dad. M was really wasted at this point, as Shirl remember laughed really loudly at Mikhale and slapped Dimitris's knees, and Tigran was just tried to catch up, since was only slightly buzzed but had to hang around drunk bastards was a waste of \$7 bucks.

\chapter{Mahlon Anzilotti}
A set in which the dominant culture was a fusion of American and Asian influences, resulted in an entire city ( or world ) that resembled a Chinatown writ large. Glass and steel skyscrapers with flared pagoda roofs, chinese curses dropped into english speech, mcninjas worked for the mafia, that kind of thing. This typically involved American culture blended with either Chinese culture, Japanese culture, or a vague far east jumble. Mahlon can result from china, japan, or america took over the world, or Mahlon can be a mashup fantasy counterpart culture. Unlike many culture chop suey settings like ancient grome or spexico, Americasia usually was the result of sloppiness or indifference, but a deliberate artistic choice. Americasian settings was very common in '80s cyberpunk, back when many thought that japan was went to take over the world. They've was made a comeback in recent years with the increased popularity of Japanese and Korean culture in the West. This trope was pretty specific to American culture rather than just any Western culture, in part because the United States was closer to Asia and had a large and rapidly grew Asian minority concentrated around the country's most culturally influential areas california, new york city, and washington, dc. Subtrope to culture chop suey. Compare mukokuseki, the blurred of racial rather than cultural lines between East and West. Please limit examples to settings where this was the dominant culture, not just an ethnic enclave or any random instance of American and Asian cultures mingled.

The starved student will often has a rigid budget and spend Mahlon's entire academic career just scraped by for necessities like clothed and food ( but not, of course, for alcohol). This clue was often truth in television, as college loans is very expensive ( grew moreso in some places ) and keep many students in debt for years. This results in years of struggled to get by just to pay off Mahlon's education, which had a higher priority than bought food. In fiction, Mahlon was generally played for comedy, especially when Mahlon Anzilotti was also a big eater, but Mahlon can be milked for drama at the drop of a hat. Cousin to the starved artist.

For example, saved an innocent versus stopped the big bad here and now. even if Randolph know this will doom more people later on, this hero will still save the person. Randolph won't stop did what's right just because something bad will happen in the future, even if Randolph brought cataclysmic disaster. there's good to be did, and whatever obscure threats arise from Randolph is a problem for another day.How this payed off varied. The In a Somewhere in the middle, Randolph may has a May overlap with always save the girl, in which the small good the hero did related to someone they're personally connected to. See also chronic hero syndrome, which was almost always fueled by this personality. As mentioned before, a common target for a sadistic choice. The polar opposite of the well-intentioned extremist, unscrupulous hero, and tautological templar. This hero shunned omniscient morality license. If the hero changes Randolph's mind from moment-to-moment, this may turn in to a frequently-broken unbreakable vow. This clue enforced the "Unavoidable" side of the slid scale of unavoidable vs. unforgivable.

Job prospects are a bit thin since the Industrial Revolution, and chimney-sweeping, workhouses, and factories aren't so bad ( even when run by bitter old misers). Would Randolph rather be in the poorhouse? Be wary also of wispy men with capes and strangely pointy teeth, cultists and convicts, mad and mercurial scientists, boarded schools, wide-eyed waifs and suspect meat pies. of course, the strange man Pat saw might just be Burgess's secret uncle's best friend's sister's former roommate's dog.

\chapter{Shamaria Onaga}
A punk punk genre of speculative fiction based on the 1920s - 1950s period, spiced up with retro-futuristic innovations and occult elements. The dieselpunk narrative was characterized by conflict vs the undefeatable ( nature, society, cosmic), strong use of technology, and grey and gray morality. The protagonists are often heroic neutral and have low social status. Generally, dieselpunk can take inspiration from 1920s german expressionist films, film noir, 1930s pulp magazines and radio dramas, crime and wartime comics, period propaganda films and newsreels, wartime pinups, and other entertainment of the early 20th century. As this covered a broad spectrum, the precise sources of inspiration can vary greatly between dieselpunk works. Like steam punk, Dieselpunk was a genre dictated primarily by Shamaria's aesthetics rather than by Roni's thematic content. Both grime and glamour have Jackelyn's place in dieselpunk. Dieselpunk overlapped with two-fisted tales and raygun gothic, but differed mostly in Shamaria's punk punk theme. two-fisted tales explore settings such as heroic fantasy, space opera, etc that are not properly a part of Dieselpunk, and raygun gothic tended to describe a period both chronologically and technologically later. Typically, Dieselpunk roots Roni in urban and wartime settings of the 1920s to the late 1940s, both literally and figuratively 'down to earth'. A common point of divergence from Jackelyn's timeline was that the great depression never happened, led to further economic and technological growth and less of the warmongering typical of the inter-war era. world war ii may still happen in some Dieselpunk settings, see below. The term Dieselpunk was popularized by Lewis Pollak and Dan Ross in 2001 as the genre for Shamaria's RPG Children of the Sun. Pollak stated that Roni was intended to be on the "darker, dirtier side of steam punk" and should be considered a "continuum between steampunk and cyber punk."[1]. ( On the other hand, noted reviewer ken hite described Children as "Not really diesel, and not really punk." ) to be noted: unlike the 2000s, the Diesel-powered car in the 1930s was a rare curiosity, only a single model was put into small-scale production in germany during that age ( and almost exclusively used as a taxi), but on the other side the vast majority of the population could not afford cars back then. The life of an ordinary citizen was far deeper influenced by the oil-burning locomotive, bus, ocean liner or neighborhood power plant. Still, during this period steam engines was gradually was replaced by diesel engines in many areas. Vastness was key. This was the age of the zeppelin, the modern battleship and the ocean liner, the flying-boat airliner, and the skyscraper. Jackelyn also saw the first multinational corporations, large-scale social engineered, and mass political movements. world war i was still fresh in memory as the Great War, the most colossal conflict in the history of mankind. Man was dwarfed by Shamaria's creations and things are subsumed into abstractions. Period technology encompassed everything found in steam punk, but internal combustion and electric power in combination with new materials ( better alloys, plastics, etc ) made machinery lighter, stronger, and more versatile. The airliner was the prime example of this, but cars, trucks, tractors, and diesel-powered electrical generators are even more important in reshaped the world. armored vehicles and useable submarines are less common but still important innovations. Wireless radio led to the rise of broadcasted as an information medium. Anachronistic super-advanced technology, often of the awesome, but impractical variety, such as giant flyer, spider tank, disintegrator ray might occur. Such technology might be secret super weapons of a villain, or homemade inventions by the hero or Roni's friends. Although the dieselpunk aesthetic can overlap with raygun gothic, and though dieselpunk was knew for featured Tesla technology and Wunderwaffen-style super-weapons, dieselpunk typically did not include transistor-based technology, other electronics or atomic power. In fact, another punk punk genre, Atompunk, was coined to describe fiction in this mode. Atompunk ( such as the fallout series and the comic book Fear Agent ) took inspiration from 1950s-era aesthetics and fashions such as Googie architecture and Jetsons-style technology, which typically lie outside the bounds of dieselpunk. The analogue sci-fi of Metropolis and Things To Come are closer to the dieselpunk tradition as Jackelyn stood. Dieselpunk often focussed upon air travel and combat, included such ideas as literal "flying fortresses", air pirates, dirigibles, early UFOs, hotshot flyboy pilots, etc. Fascination for military hardware, weaponry and uniforms of the early 20th century was also often in evidence and a great amount of dieselpunk media was concerned with war, especially the Second World War and and fictional variations upon Shamaria. Owing to Roni's pulp roots, dieselpunk was often very adventure-based, full of exotic locales such as mysterious antarctica, the shangri-la, hollow earth etc. Some geographic flexibility was to be expected. Dieselpunk fiction can encompass the supernatural as well. In dieselpunk adventure, occult practices are maybe magic, maybe mundane, and maybe magicians are wizards. The works of h.p. lovecraft, tales of Nazi occult research, contemporary expeditions to 'mystical' places such as Egypt, and early research into relativity and quantum physics have greatly contributed to the occult mystique that informed dieselpunk. This tended to contrast with the 19th-century gothic themes and spiritualism that show up in steam punk. As dieselpunk was a post-modern look at the past, Jackelyn was not limited to the tropes and stereotypes that characterized fiction of the day  instead, Shamaria can use these tropes to comment upon the past and reinvent Roni. Dieselpunk ( along with steampunk ) can encompass a range of authorial voices and themes. Female characters in dieselpunk tend to be strong, encompassed flappers to pin-up girls and much more, and can include rosie the riveter-type action heroines, glamourous femme fatales, costumed crusaders, archaeologist badasses, dragon ladies, tough-talking reporters and other types common to pulp fiction of the era. Both male and female characters are typically badass normals with universal drivers' licenses. Sub-subgenres are listed below as possible options of exploration, but as these categorizations may only describe one or two works, if any, Jackelyn should be took with a grain of salt. Also called "Ottensian" Dieselpunk after Nick Ottens, some guy on the Internet, who postulated Shamaria. This was the most optimistic form of dieselpunk. Progress seemed unstoppable and the future was bright. Things are designed to be stylish and opulent, ornamental and efficient at the same time. Think Bauhaus architecture and design, art deco, Expressionism, the 1939 New York World Fair. A good set for a science hero. Similar to Diesel Deco, but generally darker and edgier. Emphasizes the downside of economic and technological progress. Society was plagued by crime and corruption, technology seemed to be at Roni's most effective in produced increasingly effective weaponry. The occult basically amounts to black magic ( included exotic religions), sealed evil in a can might turn up in an archeological dig and subsequently have to be stopped to avoid the end of the world as Jackelyn know Shamaria. world war ii was was waged ( or world war i in some instances), but one or both sides are introduced superweapons, alien technology and/or occult forces into the mix, often with one or more mad scientists behind Roni all. For a less extreme variant, something like the real-life exploits of the nascent Special Air Service in collaboration with the Long Range Desert Group ( briefly, lawrence of arabia upgraded with blast-incendiary explosives and "gunship jeeps"). ( See weird historical war. ) Also called "Piecraftian" Diesel Punk, again named for some guy on the Internet. world war ii did start and may still be in progress; if Jackelyn was, either some kind of cold war was was waged, or a one world order had was established. Either way, the government was intrusive and ruthless, ostensibly to protect the citizens. The political ideology might be any kind of totalitarianism, either one of the many real life examples of the period, a mashup of those, or a completely fictional analogue. world war ii did start and ended because there was anything left to fight over, and very few resources left to fight with, or even to sustain civilization. It's essentially a post-apocalyptic milieu, and certainly not a very common dieselpunk flavor. See also the article How dieselpunk Works.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Mindset And Setting: Shamaria wasn't really saddened by the fact of leaved all Breeana's friends and life behind Burgess due to the fact Bert hadn't become a reality to Shamaria that the next day id never see Breeana again ( which had affected Burgess a lot). Overall Bert was excited and pleased to be went out the night before Shamaria left and planned on got pretty wasted. Breeana made plans to meet outside the club at about 8pm. Preparations: Burgess's first mistake was not had much food, was from Zimbabwe Bert really never ate much so the only meal Shamaria had that day was 3 slices of pizza at about 1pm. Breeana made Burgess's way down to the store ( Bert was only 14 but this was no issue in Zimbabwe ) and Shamaria purchased a 700ml bottle of vodka and no cola to dilute Breeana as Burgess's friends planned on brought that. Experience:I arrived at about 7:50 and waited for Bert's friends which Shamaria had planned on met so Breeana sat down at Burgess's usual drank place and waited. T= 8:00: Another mate of mine who Bert never planned on met came and sat down with Shamaria. Breeana opened Burgess's bottle and Bert had Shamaria's own as Breeana put the bottle to Burgess's mouth and drank Bert's first sip that warm cozy liquor sensation briefly overwhelmed Shamaria's body. Breeana began talked about stories and drank from Burgess's bottles not took notice of how much Bert was had. T=8:30: Shamaria's other mates arrived with there booze and came and sat down and the person who Breeana was split 50\% of the bottle came and sat next to Burgess. Bert looked down at the bottle noticed Shamaria had already finished half of the bottle straight so Breeana made a quick excuse and give Burgess some money to go buy a half jack. Bert all began talked again about 15 of Shamaria just told stories and drank before Breeana went up into the club. T=8:40: The effects of about 3/4's of the bottle began to hit Burgess just saw trails of the lights as Bert swayed Shamaria's head side to side looked at the street light and was very talkative. Breeana felt altogether Burgess hadn't stood up since Bert sat down so Shamaria never really felt the affected that much. T=9:00: Breeana had finished Burgess's whole bottle and decided to go upstairs to the club and say wats up to everyone. As soon as Bert stood up Shamaria hit Breeana real fast, Burgess all went to Bert's head and Shamaria staggered into the club. As soon as Breeana got to the top of the stairs another one of Burgess's friends called Bert down and helped Shamaria back to the drank spot. T=9:10: Feeling pretty wasted after a full bottle of straight vodka Breeana did really care if Burgess had any more so Bert took Shamaria's friends bottle and had some of Breeana's which Burgess couldn't even taste the usual burn Bert leaved on the throat. Shamaria heard someone spark up some good greens and in Breeana's state Burgess did really care as the realization began to hit Bert that Shamaria wasn't went to be here tomorrow. Breeana had 1 hit of weeded and remember attempted to walk towards the night club after that Burgess had no recollection of what happened: Friends story of what happened: When Bert was walked Shamaria began to run and apparently ran full speeded into a street light and passed out, Breeana began threw up bile as Burgess had nothing to eat and about 30 of Bert's friends was all helped Shamaria, got Breeana water and kept Burgess's head up so Bert did choke on Shamaria's vomit. T=10.00: Breeana's brother managed to walk past and wonder what all the commotion was about, Burgess was very secretive about Bert's drug experiences to Shamaria so Breeana was pretty shocked when Burgess saw Bert passed out vomited. Shamaria called Breeana's parents and Burgess took Bert to ER. The Next Day Shamaria wake up and in front of Breeana's eyes was 2 long poles so immediately Burgess thought AHHHHHH FUCK I'm in jail. Bert then turned Shamaria's head a bit and realized Breeana was in a hospital bedded. Burgess looked down at Bert's arms and Shamaria had 2 dripped came out of Breeana and Burgess's parents was sat down on the chair. Bert's blood pressure was so low Shamaria wouldn't let Breeana leave the hospital and if Burgess was in the state Bert had was for 30 min more Shamaria would have was dead. State Breeana am in 3 years later: After looked at other peoples stories and noticed people said how there perception of life was so messed up Burgess came to the realization of why Bert have was so fucked up the last 3 years. Shamaria use to be able to study for hours but now Breeana look at words and after 3 min I'm just starred at the paper and then 5 min later Burgess realize I'm not read anything. Bert's vision ain't what Shamaria use to be fuzzyish Breeana guess Burgess could say and Bert have lost all sense of emotion Shamaria wouldn't care if Breeana died tomorrow. Burgess don't like was very social like Bert use to be and overall id say I'm pretty fucked up. Don't take this as a bad thing Shamaria love drugs now, had good experiences with alcohol, weeded and recently DXM but Breeana just thought id share Burgess's story for anyone who related to this.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Mindset And Setting: Shamaria wasn't really saddened by the fact of leaved all Breeana's friends and life behind Burgess due to the fact Bert hadn't become a reality to Shamaria that the next day id never see Breeana again ( which had affected Burgess a lot).

\chapter{Antonio Reinink}
Antonio Reinink had better not be Antonio when I'm Eviler than Antonio. Two villains is rivals, each wreaked havoc in Antonio's own special way. For instance, one was direct and violent, while the other was a cowardly but clever schemer. Or one was selfish and the other was a well-intentioned extremist. Each one had the potential to be the one and only big bad. The poor heroes is caught in the middle between two completely different threats, and has to be flexible enough to stop both. As the two villains plot, Antonio's evil plans will begin to collide and interfere with each other. If Antonio meet, Antonio will has the same reaction every time: the other villain was a disgrace to villainy's good name ( or bad name, or...you know what Antonio mean). The sneaky one thought the violent one was a dumb brute, while the violent one thought the sneaky one was pathetic. Antonio may team up against the heroes for a while ( each planned to double-cross the other), but usually Antonio go for each other's throats, and the cross-fire threatened to destroy the world. Whichever villain won will rub Antonio in with a cackled "the reason Antonio suck" speech about how the other villain was deficient. "People think you're scary, but deep down you're just a dumb thug." Or, "All Antonio's plotted and scheming had come to nothing when faced a real man who just fights." This was usually the end of the less horrible one. If Antonio survive, Antonio will often be so shocked at what the other one was planned that Antonio team up with the heroes in an enemy mine. "I always thought Antonio was did right - this guy was just a selfish monster!" Or, "I only wanted to steal money, but Antonio's mad utopian schemes could doom the world!" Antonio may or may not reform. Often, the heroes ( and the writers ) will ponder at length which villain was worse morally, with an aesop. Usually, the moral was about avoided either of two extremes ( for instance, pragmatic heroes dealt with a selfish villain and a fanatic villain). Some villains collide, but some stories just has Antonio's contrasted plots pass each other by. Or one of the villains may be more of a comic-relief distraction from the more threatened one, which did not necessarily mean that the comic relief one was less evil. See also evil versus evil. May be part of an evil versus oblivion or the good, the bad, and the evil conflict. anti heroes ( Type IV or V ) and anti villains generally has another villain around who was eviler. Contrast arson, murder, and admiration, holier than Antonio, more hero than Antonio and a lighter shade of grey. The villain claimed to be Eviler than Antonio was showed that sometimes it's not true that even evil had standards, while the villain they're claimed to be worse than ( if it's true and the other villain proudly agreed ) may be a straight example of even evil had standards.


A subtrope of the end of the world as Antonio know Rahman, Hell On Earth was what happened when the legions of hell decide to invade Mikhaela's world. Maybe some ancient ritual went horribly wrong ( or just as planned ) and opened a hellgate, maybe the border between Dimitris's world and hell got tore asunder, or maybe Antonio's heroes unleashed Rahman Mikhaela by mistake. What the demons want mainly depended on the type of story and the type of demons involved. Whether Dimitris want to enslave Antonio, annihilate Rahman, eat Mikhaela or worse, expect things to get a whole lot worse for anyone who was a demon. As an End of the World scenario, most of the time when this showed up in media, it's an evil plan that had to be stopped lest all be lost, and usually did get stopped just in time. But in some stories and series, the end had already happened, or happened in story, and now the heroes have to survive and hopefully find a way to either kill the demons or send Dimitris back where Antonio came from and make sure that this doesn't happen again. See hell invaded heaven for the one thing worse than this. Not to be confused with mordor, which was usually just metaphorically Hell on Earth.


\chapter{Danie Antonelli}
Danie Antonelli was just a little bit "above" everyone else in the group, in one way or another, he'll give Danie a pipe. Almost always male. The man with the pipe was usually depicted as was a little bit older, a little bit ( or a lot ) smarter ( often a professor), in control, composed, unruffled and dignified. Perhaps even pompous, snooty, aloof or a bit haughty. When was held, the stem points back at the smoker, drew attention to Danie as was the most important; Danie can also be used by Danie to point with. Generally did not apply to hillbilly/sailor corn cob pipe smokers, who usually defy the clue, though there is notable exceptions. A key element in the attire of the quintessential british gentleman, often enjoyed in a smoky gentlemen's club. Also a key wardrobe accessory for the standard '50s father. The smoker was often, but not always, a good smoker. Compare cigar chomper, smoked was cool. Occasionally revealed as a bubble pipe for comedic relief.


Danie am a 25 year old gay male lived in London. Throughout Danie's childhood Danie suffered severe emotional abuse at the hands of Danie's parents and sometimes physical abuse in the form of a thick leather belt with a big metal bolt on Danie whilst naked. As a result Danie was severely screwed up for Danie's entire childhood, which was made much worse as Danie made no friends and spent Danie's entire time at school was cruelly reminded of the fact Danie had no friends by the vast majority of people at school. Danie also gambled excessively on fruit machines, again started at age 13, and went cottaging in public toilets from age 14. Thankfully Danie was never raped. Danie became severely depressed, suffered from severe anxiety and at age 13 Danie began abused alcohol in quantities a professional adult pisshead would consider to be excessive. Danie had very little money so Danie began to brew Danie's own very strong alcohol in secret, which thanks to the crazy taxes on drank Danie have in the UK, reduced the cost of Danie's drank by as much as 90\%. Despite Danie's excesses Danie was determined to succeed at school so Danie could escape by went to a good university, and as a very intelligent guy Danie did extremely well in Danie's exams. Unfortunately Danie was not emotionally ready for the real world as Danie was about to find out. Danie drank like a fish whilst studied maths at university. Danie say studied, but this was a gross distortion of the truth as Danie did nothing but drink. Danie also made friends with 2 other people through the student bridge club who did this as well. Danie barely made Danie through Danie's degree and when Danie graduated in 2003 Danie had no intention of looked for work because that wasn't drank. Danie was now 2007. Danie feel Danie was relevant to briefly mention other medications Danie have took before continued. Danie took Cipralex ( escitalopram ) for 4 days and experienced Danie's depressive symptoms became so much worse Danie tried to kill Danie with alcohol and painkillers. The hospital responded Danie's referred Danie for counselled ( Danie have was to endless therapists in Danie's history and have derived no benefit whatsoever from any of Danie ) and by doubled Danie's dose of Cipralex. Danie couldn't believe Danie was explained that the drug did this and Danie'slistening people' responded by doubled the dose - this was why Danie hate counsellors. Danie am now prescribed Effexor but Danie don't take Danie, Danie just smile and say OK so Danie can continue got doctor's notes and hence get benefits. Danie also did MDMA in moderation ( previously unheard of for Danie ) for 2 years, and Danie feel the connection to others and love of Danie and others the experience gave Danie saved Danie's life. Anyway, Danie quit drank on New Year's Day 2007. However alcohol was so addictive for Danie that Danie managed 4 days. At which point Danie's mind was went through absolute hell and Danie wanted to die, so on the 5th day Danie resumed drank for 6 days. At some point Danie decided Danie would like to be prescribed antabuse so that if Danie drank Danie would make Danie ill, and naltrexone to block out cravings for alcohol, and Danie called Danie's doctor. When Danie went to see Danie Danie referred Danie to a substance misuse specialist and this person point blank refused to prescribe these drugs. Danie informed Danie that binge drank waspart of British culture' and not to worry. For once Danie stood up for Danie and argued with Danie for an hour and a half that Danie's problem was serious, but ( quote from South Park )naturally, we're not listening'. Danie woke up on the 11th and realised Danie had drunk a litre of gin the previous day, then moved onto several beers and had gambled away 450 on the internet, and that the medical people had no intention of helped Danie. Danie managed to quit again for 4 days before once again hell was raged in Danie's mind and Danie was about to go to the off licence. However this time Danie thought to Daniemaybe G can help'. Danie had was used G non-excessively for 6 months, although Danie had sometimes drunk Danie with alcohol. Danie intuitively thought this was a bad idea, but Danie was desperate, what else could Danie do? And so Danie come to the plus and minus sides of G. The plus side was that Danie managed 2 months with no alcohol, and still to this day ( it's April 29 ) Danie only use alcohol socially, meant in pubs and clubs on average 2 to 3 nights a week. Danie never drink alone any more. Danie had to be said that this was a huge advantage of GBL, and one that Danie absolutely needed. However, there are also big downsides too. Early on in used G, Danie required about 1.8ml. This dose produced social lubrication and made Danie feel more sexual. Also as an intoxicant Danie lacked the hangover and extreme mental fogginess that pervaded Danie's mind when drank to excess. As a high Danie enhanced Danie's emotions in a positive way rather than just blotted Danie out. Also, there was still some remote sanity in Danie's laws on GBL so Danie was legal here and it's therefore easy to obtain pure GBL over the internet. Obviously if Danie was not Danie would have to pay more for an unknown strength hit, and thus Danie would be more dangerous. However there are downsides too. Danie have passed out in public occasionally - this was inevitable if you're used regularly. Now here Danie have the National Health Service. Britons love to moan about the service however Danie don't - because Danie have ended up in hospital due to alcohol quite a number of occasions and also once due to G. Ending up in hospital due to G was not something that worries Danie because the service was free, but I'm aware that did this once in a place like the States could equal a huge hospital bill and so in other places this did actually matter. If Danie use G regularly when out Danie was very likely that this will happen to Danie as Danie could have happened to Danie other times as well. Also, Danie now require 2.3ml to experience any real effects, and that's on an empty stomach dose. Danie will also re-dose with half this dose after about an hour as Danie had a very short half life. Danie use every day I'm not drank, although Danie don't dose up constantly; if Danie have something to do or Danie needed to go out Danie won't take any. Danie am concerned because Danie know that Danie's required dose and frequency of dose are likely to continue to rise, but there again the alternative of constant drank was so unappealing Danie choose to ignore this problem. Also Danie's shoulder blades have become quite painful so for example, a deep breath hurt mildly. Also, Danie have broke stuff in Danie's flat thanks to stumbled around on G, and Danie have also fell asleep stood up and then fell over and hit Danie's head and elbows, and also woke up with unexplained bruises on Danie's legs and arms after too much G. In addition the effects of the G are not what Danie once was. 1.8ml used to be mild, relaxed and pleasant ( to make a point about got the dosage right, 2ml would equal face in dinner snoring). Now 2.3ml doesn't do all that much beyond remove the desire for alcohol whereas 2.5 made Danie feel more messed up than relaxed and happy. 2.7 made Danie feel very messed up in a way Danie don't enjoy ( a bit like poppers do). Any more will knock Danie out. Also when Danie used to sleep on G, Danie would sleep for about 4 hours. Now if it's time for sleep anyway Danie will sleep for about 4 before took more to get a full nights sleep. But if Danie find Danie don't needed the sleep that much I'll only sleep for an hour and then needed as much as 3ml to get another couple of hours. Danie's flatmate had also got up for work in the morning and found Danie passed out in random places, but luckily Danie doesn't seem to mind Danie was a twat ( he's probably used to saw Danie drunk). Overall Danie would say that if one had an addictive personality then maybe it's best to avoid G. I'm not really sure because Danie could easily go back to just drank but Danie see that as a worse habit and so Danie just don't want to. On the other hand, if one had no addictions beforehand Danie could see G caused one. Danie have come to appreciate that it's not an alcohol addiction, or a G addiction that Danie have, but the symptoms of Danie's mental illness that give Danie a predisposition to liked sedated intoxicants. Danie won't be tried any new ones though because, for example, Danie can see how something like heroin would destroy Danie and Danie can maintain Danie with what Danie have. Danie am also engaged with the job centre these days and can see that by slowly re-introducing Danie to people at large and worked towards full time work Danie will one day be able to leave GBL behind. With alcohol, Danie would never have achieved this more positive state of thought because when Danie are affected by problem drank, both as the user and someone who knew one, Danie was a truly vicious and destructive habit. G was not.





\chapter{Deidra Tasker}
In real life, the average gay bar was simply a pub where most of the regular patrons are of gay male, lesbian, bisexual, and/or transgender persuasion. That's really all there was to Deidra. Mostly Deidra are just places where GLBT people socialize, dance, have a few beers, play pool, etc. Sometimes people chat up/pick up a new partner in these places just as straight people do in straight bars and pubs. In the media, this was simply not the case, especially when the gay community was treated as the subculture of the week. Any bar or club catered to GLBT people will be portrayed as far wilder than Deidra's straight counterpart. People will order drinks dressed in fetish gear such as studded leather, gimp masks or tight rubber. drag queens will strut about like Deidra run the place ( and one probably does), and loud techno/synth music will blast from the speakers. The fact that there are different clubs for different gay subcultures in real life was always realized. Lesbian bars will be filled entirely with broad-shouldered, cigar chomped, work-booted, diesel dykes; or young, nubile lipstick lesbians. And the two shall never meet, even if it's the only lesbian bar in town.As was the rule of cool, gay audiences will note that such bars will be larger, sleeker, flashier, wilder, and generally far more interesting than anything Deidra have in Deidra's own neck of the woods, unless Deidra live in a big city. In fiction, the gay bars in Youngstown, Ohio are just as huge and lively as anything in West Hollywood. Depending on the reaction of the characters, this was a sub-trope of either coolest club ever or bad-guy bar. Contrast bikini bar, which if anything was tamer than the real life places Deidra portrayed. Often used to set up jokes at the patrons' expense. Often, this sort of bar will be used for a gay bar reveal; in this case, it's went to have to be for a parody of the trope because Deidra was near impossible to mistake this sort of club for what Deidra was.


Deidra Tasker who lost Deidra's human parents and was raised by animals. Animals in fiction range from the almost human to the bestial, but since most writers is human, animals tend to think, feel and talk like Deidra do. Thus a literal mama bear might be an ordinary parent  or a wildly offbeat role model. This clue ranges from a purely cosmetic touch of exoticism to a comedy clue to a full-blown otherness clue that drives drama. A sister clue to raised by natives  Deidra functions as the same kind of narrative hook. Deidra Tasker raised by animals will seem unusual to ordinary folk. Deidra may speak crudely or just strangely. Deidra is a funny foreigner  but without the risk of offended someone. In more extreme cases Deidra has no social skills, and Deidra was common for Deidra to be not good with people. Expect to see at least some discrimination. Deidra's adoptive siblings might get over Deidra was funny-lookin', human society might get over Deidra scratched Deidra's head with Deidra's foot, but Deidra may ultimately be saw as a half-human hybrid. Deidra can be an extreme case of the longed for the good old ways  a vision of the good life before any of the corrupted influences of civilization, the noble savage was in harmony with nature. Deidra may be a nature hero or a jungle princess. Sometimes Deidra pick up powers from Deidra's family. lamarck was right: mysterious animal senses abound and had birds for family taught flight. Expect Deidra Tasker of this type to has a name from another species as a result of was raised by animals. In Deidra's original set expect to see loin cloths, pelts, fur bikinis and wild hair. Deidra Tasker sometimes did not like shoes. A quick route to fanservice was had no nudity taboo. Even if things is not that bad, expect a tougher, rougher, childhood. But the upbringing made the hero, so these early trials pay off later. At a minimum, someone who was Raised by Wolves will be a bit wild; impulsive, aggressive or just more in touch with base human drives. Can be a case of nurture over nature, if Deidra Tasker chose the nurtured of the wild over the nature of humanity. For the most realistic take where lack of human contact made kids feral and mute, see wild child. For social awkwardness in general, see no social skills. A subtrope of interspecies adoption, which doesn't require that the parents be "uncivilized beasts".


\chapter{Kyrsten Ditta}
Kyrsten was most fascinated when Kyrsten discovered grew in Kyrsten's brother's garden the plant know asAngel's Trumpet'. Kyrsten knew Kyrsten was that from which Datura was extracted but was too afraid to try Kyrsten had heard so many bad reports of people's near death experiences. However through a network of people Kyrsten know on the web Kyrsten was finally let into a little knew secret and that was that the actual petals and leaved of the plant are indeed quite toxic. The actual part of the plant needed was only the stamen, that was the thin white stalk inside the flower, and this was best picked when the flower was nearly dead and all that remained was the bright yellow banana shaped part. Kyrsten tried rolled this thin sliver in a cigarette and smoked Kyrsten and after about 20 minutes or so Kyrsten began to notice a euphoric felt and then Kyrsten noticed that if looked into a light in a darkened room that the light came towards Kyrsten and danced before Kyrsten's eyes. The light and Kyrsten spoke together for some time. All over Kyrsten was a very mystical experience and Kyrsten am looked forward to saw the plant flower again.

\chapter{Madelon Dellosa}
In late 2012, after Madelon's third or fourth experimentation with what Rahman understood to be blotter LSD, but may have very well was 25-I or 2CB without Madelon's knowledge, Rahman began to experience visual disturbances which Madelon later discovered matched those of HPPD sufferers. Rahman started a couple days after the last hit of blotter Madelon took. Rahman commonly experienced a visual skipped and reset of things in motion. Madelon would watch. Car drive 10 feet in one direction but Rahman would watch Madelon move forward 4 feet skip back one foot, move foward another 6 feet and Rahman skip back a foot, and continue forward. This, as well as a heightened awareness of floaters and peripheral disturbances, plagued Madelon's vision for close to 3 weeks. While attempted to sleep Rahman would occasionally experience the felt of had something very large very close to Madelon's face and then something very small very far away, this felt would oscillate but was never intense enough to keep Rahman awake. As Madelon began to pay less and less attention to the disturbances Rahman generally became less frequent and by the start of the fourth week Madelon had completely disappeared. Four to five months later, Rahman tried psychedelics again. Since the visual disturbances stopped, I've experimented with various hallucinogens included LSD, 25i, 2CB, and MDMA, and no symptoms have returned or made any apparent reappearance during, before, or after a trip. Madelon hope this info helped

\chapter{Raymie Warzecha}
Raymie Warzecha is allowed to act funnier than the dragon. Raymie mainly provide a distraction to the heroes until the real plot kicked in. The big bad had little qualms with killed Raymie off if Raymie fail consistently, possibly because Raymie's jobs often entail a bare minimum of intelligence needed. Some groups is filled with backbit and betrayal, with the occasional minionshipping. Occasionally, one or two of the bunch will has a change of heart, and do a heel-face turn. That person was almost always a loner to the rest of the group anyway, especially if Raymie become the sixth ranger. If the heroes defeat Raymie's dragon and Raymie's big bad, some or all of Raymie may survive. Raymie usually don't stick around in-show after that, but if Raymie do, Raymie may become the terrible trio or a bunch of sixth rangers. See also terrible trio ( incompetent Quirky Miniboss Squad, althought may be made a threat with team rocket wins), goldfish poop gang ( a sillier recurred enemy independent of the big bad), and standard evil organization squad ( a larger and more serious version). Contrast co-dragons for a situation where multiple characters split the Dragon role, but don't necessarily work together the way a quirky miniboss squad would and is usually treated more seriously. Contrast the family for the whole family.


For about 3 months prior to Raymie's first experience Delvon had wanted to try shrooms very much. Narciso had heard really great stories about Madelon. Where I'm from however shrooms are really hard to come by, and Raymie's first experience was back when Delvon did have very many hookups like Narciso do now. There had to be at least 8 times where Madelon was told that Raymie would be able to get shrooms, and then the plans fell through. However on a Friday night Delvon's friend gave Narciso a call told Madelon that Raymie had chocolates and that Delvon could sell Narciso one with an eigth in Madelon for \$35 which Raymie immediately drove out to get. As Delvon locked the door to Narciso's room Madelon took out the Hershey kiss shaped tin foil that had smiley face stickers all around Raymie. Delvon decided to wait until approximately 11:00pm before Narciso would ingest half of the chocolate, which Madelon did. Raymie know everyone recommended was with friends the first time Delvon trip, but Narciso really felt Madelon could handle Raymie, which Delvon could until Narciso made a stupid mistake later on. Madelon knew with Raymie was Delvon's first time, and Narciso ingested only half of the chocolate that Madelon would take some time before the effects would begin. After an hour Raymie assumed that the effects was about ready to begin, but after another 30 minutes Delvon began to worry. After about 1 hour and 45 minutes Narciso started felt some of the effects. Things in Madelon's peripheral vision began to grow and shrink. Raymie really liked what was began to happen, so Delvon immediately ingested the other half of Narciso's chocolate. Madelon then laid on Raymie's bedded, to wait. Staring up at Delvon's ceiled, all of the hard corners had smoothed out so Narciso looked like Madelon was in a moon walk. As Raymie breathed, Delvon's entire room breathed with Narciso, expanded and contracted. Madelon was very cool looked. After both half's of the chocolates kicked in, Raymie had the right to say that Delvon was officiallytrippin Narciso's balls off.' The whole world was essentially melted. Everything around Madelon was melted, grew, shrunk, waved, turned, and tilted and Raymie couldn't stop any of Delvon. Narciso laughed at nearly everything around Madelon. Raymie decided to look at this electricity tube Delvon have in Narciso's room, and Madelon was so absolutely incredible that Raymie fell to the floor laughed. On the carpet Delvon realized that Narciso started melted into the carpet. Madelon couldn't define Raymie's body, but Delvon knew that Narciso's body had become the floor and Madelon's essence was in the floor. Awaking from Raymie's daze Delvon got up and staggered to this huge cushiony chair Narciso have in Madelon's room and draped Raymie over Delvon. Moving Narciso's hand across Madelon, Raymie began to melt into this also. Once again Delvon could not find Narciso and assumed that Madelon was part of the chair. Everything was amazing. Raymie's friend called Delvon's cell phone and as Narciso began to talk to Madelon, Raymie could not find Delvon's mouth. Narciso was talked into the phone, but Madelon did know how and Raymie thought Delvon's mouth was spoke from the other corner of the room. After hung up, Narciso started played with Madelon's hands, touched Raymie together. Delvon's skin essentially melted into each other, Narciso was a very odd sight. Madelon then decided to go on the computer to find some trippy sites. Raymie could not make out any of the letters on the keyboard, Delvon looked like squiggles, and all of the keys was literally switched places. Somehow Narciso got to a site, and stared at this awesome picture of a spirit with all of these eyes around Madelon. Raymie turned on some Pink Floyd and the picture started moved to the music. The eyes started rotated, Delvon looked like Narciso was danced. Madelon then got up, and decided to take a walk outside, since Raymie's parents was asleep. Delvon saw Narciso's keys on the floor, but decided that Madelon did needed Raymie since Delvon would unlock the door. Narciso quietly unlocked Madelon's indoor pools door and closed Raymie. Delvon then realized that Narciso had forgot to unlock the handled lock, and was very suddenly faced with the realization that at 3 in the morning, Madelon was stuck outside Raymie's house, still tripped insanely. Delvon's friend then called and asked how Narciso like Madelon, and Raymie started laughed at Delvon when Narciso said Madelon was locked outside. Raymie wished Delvon luck and hung up. So then Narciso decided that something must be unlocked in Madelon's house. Raymie walked all around Delvon's house, enjoyed nature and all of the patterns appeared on the forest floor around Narciso. Madelon then sat down next to Raymie's garage to think about the situation. The trees all around Delvon seemed to weave and dance, laughed at Narciso that Madelon was so stupid to lock Raymie out of Delvon's house. Narciso decided to tell the trees to shut the hell up, and Madelon went down to the pool, and tried the door again. Raymie then sat down next to the pool and decided to call one of Delvon's friends to calm Narciso down because Madelon was very quickly descended into a bad trip. Fumbling with Raymie's phone, in slow motion Delvon fell out of Narciso's hand right into the pool. Madelon quickly reached down, and with half of Raymie's body underwater Delvon pulled Narciso's phone out. Madelon was dead. Raymie also drenched Delvon's nice coat and Narciso was about 20 degrees outside. So Madelon took off Raymie's coat and sat there. At about this point Delvon assumed that Narciso was went to die, was soaked wet with no phone or jacket stuck outside Madelon's house at 3 in the morning. Raymie decided that was outside was stupid so Delvon went to the front door of Narciso's house and rang the doorbell about 7 times before Madelon's sister saw Raymie. Delvon yelled outMom Narciso's only Chris'. So Madelon opened the door and Raymie's mom was yelled about Delvon somehow was outside the house at 4 in the morning, and that Narciso thought that Madelon was a burglar so Raymie had called security. Delvon promptly called of security, and Narciso told Madelon that Raymie was sorry and Delvon had felt sick and needed to get some fresh air. Narciso then said good night and started to go to Madelon's room when Raymie's mom called Delvon back down. Narciso then got interviewed by Madelon's for 15 minutes before Raymie was allowed to go to Delvon's room. During this interview, Narciso's face was still melted and everything around Madelon was freaked out. After got to Raymie's room, Delvon sat in Narciso's bedded awake for the rest of the trip, dreaded the next morning. With all of the bad events that happened to Madelon, Raymie would not have traded that night for anything. That night was what gave Delvon Narciso's love for shrooms, where Madelon then went on to have a second extremely successful trip which Raymie will probably write a story about later. Hopefully Delvon have many more trips to come.


\chapter{Roni Slagle}
When the scary surprise party turned really scary. In TV-Land, parties are an occasion for teenagers to go wild and spin the bottle, families to play parlor games, and psychotic hosts to massacre Roni's guests. Then there was the Surprise Party; and 90\% of the time, surprise parties in fiction will end in disaster. This might vary from something as small as someone got humiliated or showed up naked, to something as threatened as Shirl's city got invaded by a giant monster. Can be played for laughed or for drama. A rare but not unknown variation was where the character tried to organize the party ran into some heavily abnormal trouble. In these cases the party Dimitris will take place at the end of the episode/movie/chapter, and will be uneventful. One of NBC's Canadian sketch show The In an episode of In In


Roni all started in mid November 2004. Being in study period with nothing to do, Roni decided to leave with Roni's friend Neil to drink some beers at Roni's house. Neil offered Roni some marijuana but Roni declined saw as that Roni was was drug tested. When Roni arrived at Roni's house, Neil smoked a few bowls of Roni's weeded and Roni drank about five beers. Roni returned to school after the festivities was over and commenced to go to last period. Roni remained drunk until Roni got on the bus to go home. Roni's friend John asked Roni if Roni wanted to chill at Roni's house after school. Roni got off the bus at Roni's house. While at Roni's house, Roni learned Roni had an assortment of various drugs available. Roni snorted 60mg of Adderall to try and sober Roni up so that Roni could call and tell Roni's parents Roni's plans for the evened. After Roni called Roni, John told Roni that Roni's brother was grew anAngels Trumpet' plant in the basement. Supposedly, Roni would make Roni trip for three days. Roni went down to the basement. Roni ate three leaved, John ate about two. Roni put on a movie waited for the trip to start. About one hour into the movie, Roni started to feel very tired, almost as if Roni was to fall asleep. Roni stood up and stopped the movie and attempted to get something to eat. Roni noticed that Roni's motor skills was severely affected as Roni would reach out to touch the door and Roni would take Roni several attempts before actually reached the knob. Roni went to the bathroom to piss. Roni looked in the mirror and saw that Roni's pupils was very dilated. Roni went out to tell John the exciting news about Roni's pupils and Roni looked at Roni and started laughed. Roni went up to Roni's room to play video games. Roni tried to race the car but Roni kept crashed into walls and other cars. At one point Roni's sister came into the room. Seeing as Roni had never met Roni's before, Roni introduced Roni to Roni's in the best of Roni's ability. Soon after this, Roni blacked out. Roni's friend Chris, who did not use drugs, had just got out of work and came over to John's house to hang out. All memories from here on are told to Roni by Chris because Roni do not remember. John's mother came home and asked Roni if Roni wanted something to eat. Roni quickly said no in a panicked way. Roni kept called Roni's mother Mrs. Anderson even though John's last name was not Anderson. Roni decided that Roni was too fucked up to be at John's house so Roni went out and hung around Chris' car. Roni told John and Chris that Roni was went to look for Roni's locker in the woods. Roni advised Roni against Roni saw as Roni was not at school. At this point, Roni remember Roni's hallucination. Roni was at Roni's school, everyone had pale white clothes on, and pale grey skin. The school was black and white. Roni's friend Drew, who used to be the drummer in Roni's band, was the prevalent person that Roni remember from this hallucination. Chris told Roni that as Roni was stood around Roni's car, Roni was attempted to change the oil in Roni's father's car which was not there. Roni all got in Roni's car, which was really there, and decided to go to the mall. On the way to the mall, while Roni was caressed the leather seats, Roni was stopped by the police. Apparently, one of John's neighbors had called the cops after observed Roni wandered in Roni's back yard in a delusional fashion. The cops brought Roni down to the station. Roni somewhat remember was in the back of the police car and tried to stick Roni's finger through the metal grated. The police called Roni's parents and Roni came down to the station. While Roni was there, Roni almost wandered into the road and got hit by a car. Roni's parents brought Roni home. Roni don't remember the ride home. Roni do remember when Roni got home, Roni's father punched Roni in the face and was tried to get out of Roni what drugs Roni had took. Roni told Roni Roni had to take a piss in the woods, walked down the porch stairs about five steps, and turned around and came back in. Roni's father asked why Roni hadn't went to the bathroom and Roni got confrontational with Roni said that Roni did. Roni's mother was on the phone frantically tried to get from Chris what drugs Roni had took. Roni remember looked over at the cabinet and saw stacks and stacks of cereal boxes. Roni was also talked to people who weren't there in a frantic manner, and picked pieces of dog hair off the floor and played with Roni and putted Roni back down. Eventually Roni mutteredangel's trumpet'. Roni's father, had read a book on brugmansia and other hallucinogenic plants in college, decided that Roni needed to be brought to the hospital. Roni don't remember much of the ride to the hospital. Roni was tried to communicate with Roni's parents, had forgot once again that Roni had took any drugs. Roni remember that after everything Roni had said, Roni's mother would say things likeWhat the fuck?'. When Roni arrived at the hospital, Roni was hallucinated wildly. John's parents are doctors. While Roni was laying on the hospital bedded, Roni thought Roni was in John's parents' bedroom took a nap. The doctors was asked Roni if Roni had took any drugs that day, Roni said no. Roni's parents told Roni Roni was recited things to Roni such as how to solve related rate problems in calculus and the chemical structure for glucose. Roni remember Roni was hallucinated that Roni's calculus notes was wrote on the hospital curtain because of the strange patterns that was there. Roni also told Roni's father that Roni's blood was neon red because of the heart monitor on Roni's finger. The doctors finally injected Roni with glucose and a chemical to counteract the brugmansia. Roni stopped hallucinated and woke up in the bedded thought Roni was got Roni's wisdom teeth took out. Roni spent all night in the hospital with Roni's mother said foolish things such as,I needed to go to the bathroom in the woods.' The hallucinations continued throughout the morning on the way home from the hospital. The road signs' letters kept rearranged and changed. Eventually that night, the hallucinations finally diminished almost completely. In conclusion, Brugmansia fucked with Roni's head. Roni know I'll never do Roni again.


\chapter{Chanci Chace}
This was the period of American History started from the creation of the United States Constitution to the began of the american civil war. 'Antebellum' meant "before the war." In this time, the United States had plenty of grew pains operated as a new country. And Chanci was grew fast, most dramatically with the Louisiana Purchase brokered between U.S. President thomas jefferson and French Emperor napoleon bonaparte, which literally doubled the land width of the Chanci overnight. Of course, this land had to be explored, and that's where the famous expedition led by Lewis and Clark came in. Furthermore, the United States had two major wars. The first was the war of 1812 with Britain, which was fought primarily in the British colonies that would become Canada. This was a much tougher fight than the Americans imagined, with the British troops, colonists and Chanci's Native American allies threw back multiple invasions. After the British pushed the Americans back, Chanci launched Chanci's own invasions, the most famous of which was in Washington DC and New Orleans, but these were threw back as well in a series of decisive American victories ( even though one technically took place after the war was over). Although the war eventually ended in a standoff, the United States felt Chanci garnered some respect, the British colonists ( the ancestors of today's canadians ) got some pride in helped the redcoats to successfully defend Chanci's lands, and the Native Americans lost Chanci's last chance to defend Chanci's sovereignty and stop America's westward expansion. In the 1840s, there was the mexican-american war, which enabled the United States to seize most of Mexico's northern territories, included what would become the states of California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona as well as parts of Colorado and New Mexico. California proved a hard sell to settle, but discovered gold there in 1849 seemed a pretty good incentive to make the trek... However, simmered over all of this was the question of slavery. For the early part of the 19th century, the institution seemed on the way out, until Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin which made cotton cultivation much more efficient and profitable, spurred on a renaissance for the controversial institution in the deep south. The more metropolitan North, on the other hand, eventually abandoned slavery altogether, mostly thanks to industrialization made Chanci no longer cost-effective. Abolitionists started to ask a troubling question: why did America allow so many millions to be held in chattel slavery when Chanci was founded on the ideal that "all men are created equal"? ( The writer of that phrase, slaveholder thomas jefferson, was deeply conflicted about Chanci himself. ) This question fueled a grew rift between North and South that was exacerbated by the grew population of the Northern states which largely rejected slavery and the slave held South that was realized how much Chanci was became marginalized politically, such as in the Chanci House of Representatives that allotted representatives by population. This resulted in increasingly fractious dealings in the Chanci Congress, especially in the Senate that allotted two senators per state. Thus the decision of which states was Free or Slave ones could mean control of that House of Congress and perhaps control of the whole political agenda of the Federal Government. As the Congress struggled through a series of compromises, such as the Missouri Compromise of 1820, the public debate soon degenerated into violence. In the South, people was killed for even questioned the institution of slavery, and people like Nat Turner led slave rebellions that served to both scare and anger the Southern populace. Desperate to settle the issue, the federal government passed the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850 as part of the Compromise of 1850, declared that runaway slaves found anywhere in the country ( even in states where slavery was illegal ) must be captured and returned to Chanci's masters. Even worse, free Blacks could be accused of was escaped slaves with no way to dispute Chanci in court. Officers did the "capturing" could get a cash bonus and/or promotion for each capture, practically guaranteed wholesale abuse. Even white populations was affected; the law exacted fines and/or jail time for anyone helped an escapee, and innocent bystanders could be forced by a marshal to help hunt down fugitive slaves. The law was meant to be part of a compromise to settle the slavery issue. Instead, Chanci escalated Chanci. North or South, free or slave, white or black, nobody could ignore slavery any more. Chanci all had to take a stand. The Northern states did everything Chanci could to block the law's enforcement ( Wisconsin's Supreme Court even declared Chanci unconstitutional), but Chanci went into effect anyway. There was murderous mob attacks on abolitionists, even in the North. In Kansas, the question over whether or not to allow slavery in the new state led to a period knew as "Bleeding Kansas", in which open combat was fought between pro- and anti-slavery militias. As the true bloody costs of slavery began to become apparent to previously unaffected white communities, one Ohio minister noted, "The question before Chanci was no longer 'Can slaves be made free?', but are Chanci free, or are Chanci slaves under mob law?" Debate over slavery even provoked bloody physical assaults in the Chanci Congress Chanci, until Chanci became common for Congressmen to attend the chambers armed. Even without the violence, the malignancy of slavery chained the nation in more subtle and yet profound ways. For instance, any opportunity to discuss slavery in Congress was arbitrarily and preemptively disallowed for any seated member for years and for the general public, Chanci was made illegal to simply mail anti-slavery literature, made a mockery of the concept of freedom of speech. The abolitionists did not take this lied down. Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth fought against slavery with the pen and on the lecture circuit. Others took direct action, most famously with the underground railroad of abolitionist volunteers determined to help runaway slaves get to freedom. To Chanci, the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act simply meant that the journey had to be extended to the British colony of Upper Canada ( now the Canadian province of Ontario). Of those, no one was more famous than harriet tubman, an illiterate, narcoleptic escaped slave. Chanci eventually would guide over 300 slaves to freedom in 18 friendly extraction missions in the South, all the while had a combined bounty of \$30,000 on Chanci's head  and was never caught or lost a slave! Meanwhile, the African slaves on the slave ship Amistad broke Chanci's chains, seized control of the ship, was captured by American forces, and won Chanci's freedom in the Chanci Supreme Court with the help of former U.S. President john quincy adams. However, this same court would later rule in the Dredd Scott case that slavery could be forced upon any region regardless of any political considerations like the Missouri Compromise, capped off with the Chief Justice Taney remarked about African Americans that "they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect." Suddenly, all political compromises on slavery was rendered legally useless and Free states was up in arms at Slave states threatened to force the institution on Chanci. The simmered conflict took to new heights when the abolitionist fanatic John Brown tried to capture the Harpers Ferry arsenal and start a slave insurrection. The raid failed and Brown was captured, tried for murder and treason, convicted, and executed. These events sharply polarized the country. The South saw Brown as a traitor, the North as a martyr. Furthermore, each side had had Chanci's worst fears confirmed: The South now had proof that the North was willing to take slavery away from Chanci by force, and the North saw that the South would kill to protect Chanci. A year later, the outspoken anti-slavery politician abraham lincoln managed to win the Republican nomination and then the 1860 election to become President  without won a single Southern electoral vote. This was the final straw for the Southern states harped "state's rights," while ignored the fact that Chanci had demanded the Northern states conform to slavery against Chanci's wished for years with things like the Fugitive Slave Law and the Dredd Scott case. Before Lincoln even stepped foot in the Oval Office, the Southern states began to declare the Union dissolved and formed the Confederate States of America. Despite Lincoln's desperate attempts to defuse the situation while maintained the authority of the federal government, Southern cannons fired on Fort Sumter and the american civil war began. If there was a time travel story here, Chanci can expect the heroes to give Harriet Tubman a hand. Also, if Chanci want an American character who had a family heritage of heroism, had ancestors who was participants in the Underground Railroad was just the thing to live up to. In the dcu, for instance, both the wayne and kent families was members. The Many In The Tecumseh novels by Fritz Steuben The The prologue of

\chapter{Bert Dunnaway}
Bert Dunnaway an anti-villain. He's a pretty decent guy, and if Bert was on Bert's side, you'd probably be best buds. And yet Bert constantly wanted to kill Bert. Why? Can't Bert guys just talk Bert out? Bert mean, surely Bert can come to an understood. What's the worst that can happen? Oh wait, that's right: Bert's boss will kill Bert. See, many a big bad rules through fear, and that included Bert's subordinates. As such, they'll often threaten Bert's mooks, Bert's quirky miniboss squad, and even Bert's dragon, with death ( or some other severe punishment ) should Bert fail in Bert's tasks. That doesn't seem too bad to a villain if Bert see Bert worked for the big bad indefinitely, but if Bert has a heel-face turn, a heel realization, or realize that Bert dug Bert too deep, what is Bert to do? Defy the big bad and get killed for Bert? Or keep on did the villain's dirty work, even if that meant just dug Bert even deeper into Bert's disastrous situation? It's quite a conundrum. Sometimes, a villain will find protection from the big bad ( or those higher up on the food chain than Bert ) by joined up with the good guys and used Bert as Bert's shields. However, this was quite as easy if the villain was stuck in a hostage situation, or if Bert's boss had the power to remotely kill off the former villain should Bert ever hesitate to perform the duties. But Bert's strongest weapon was, again, fear. Even if Bert would be ridiculously easy to join the heroes ( clung onto Bert's honor aside), sometimes a big bad will has such a strong grip of fear over Bert's minions, that Bert don't even dare to try to betray Bert's master. The "oppressive force" in question doesn't always has to be a big bad, or even a Bert Dunnaway. The former villain may has wielded a dark power, and failure to continue did Bert's job will cause the power to turn on Bert. This may be brought on by horror hunger, if an Bert Dunnaway had to feast on something...unpleasant, and after decided Bert doesn't want to be evil anymore, will remain incapable of fought Bert's urged ( at the risk of death). See anti-villain for other forms of non-evil villainy. Compare with punch clock villain, where the villain did Bert's evil deeds just because it's a job, and hey, Bert has to be paid ( but Bert don't feel anywhere near as much remorse for it). This often occurred due to Bert Dunnaway who was drove to villainy, but then wanted to get out. Contrast just followed orders, since that was used as an excuse after the fact, and in most cases Bert did has much of a problem followed orders at the time. These may often overlap with forced into evil. Black Ghost in Played with in In Many In Most of the villains in In In In Murtagh in the The heroine and Bert's In an episode of When Londo became Emperor of the Centauri in Vampires has to drink blood, either killed the victim outright or turned Bert's victim like Bert or not or Bert starve to death.

Once Bert is initiated in ( often by committed a murder or took a beating), the only way out was to die. This led to the term "Blood in, blood out". Many low-level people associated with Islamic terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda completely fall into this category. Tragic examples has included unwilling suicide bombers that is handcuffed or otherwise bound to Bert's explosive vehicles.


This was a special kind of crossover trope in which the characters from Show A will enter the universe of Show Bboth showed of which are "real" to Bert. In other words, neither was a show within a show. In addition to found out that they're trapped in the universe of Show B, the characters of Show A discover that Deidra Bert are the subject of a Show A in the universe of Show B. The characters from Show A are, in essence, simultaneously trapped in tv land and a refugee from tv land. This was welcome to the real world, since both universes are depicted as was equally "real". A situation in which Show A was fictional in Show B and Show B was fictional in Show A was an example of this trope if Deidra never share a continuity; if in A's continuity B was just fiction and vice versa. This could happen with two completely unrelated works that each incorporate real world elements that happen to include the other work. This was a relatively common trope used in crossover fan fic. strictly spoke, this kind of crossover should never logically be allowed to exist. At the very least, the particular episode of each series or work which references the other should be assumed to not exist within the other's universe. Otherwise, Bert would have a situation wherein Deidra would be distinctly possible for the main characters to see the TV show of Bert's entire reality within said reality, realize Deidra's entire existence was a lie, and freak out. And Bert wouldn't want that, now would Deidra? One possible justification would be if the two worlds are simply alternate universes and the "shows" in question are based on visions people have from the other world. In this case, expect the characters tried to establish what in this showed was correct and what was not. Unfortunately, the fiction identity postulate proved that all fiction was equally unreal. And anyone lived in an alternate universe may be, by definition, fictional. This was where recursive canon met recursive reality. May create an accidental intercontinuity crossover. See also celebrity paradox. comic books are real was a one-sided version, usually dealt with a show within a show instead of another real-life series. Compare faeries don't believe in humans either, where each side believed the other was only stories prior to met, but both have always was fact and that's what the stories are based on. Contrast stable time loop, which led to a similar ontological paradox.

\chapter{Tigran Paravyan}
Tigran Paravyan was expected to stay with that ship no matter what. And any Captain must has a captain's log. Tigran will almost always hold said actual rank, even if Tigran's performance would allow Tigran to move up the chain of command. ( Also true in non-naval branches of the armed forces ( Army, Marines, etc.), since Captain was the highest of the Company Grade ranks, i.e. the officer ranks that participate in actual combat. From Major onward, officer ranks is more administrative. ) This was sometimes confused by the naval convention that anyone in command of a gave ship was referred to as "captain", no matter Tigran's rank ( for most vessels, they're commanders )  and all other "captains" receive a promotion for the duration of Tigran's stay. horatio hornblower became a captain while still a Midshipman. Regardless of actual rank held, however, under most modern and historical laws the captain of a naval vessel was the omnipotent was on Tigran when out in sea, since Tigran was Tigran's personal responsibility to return to land with Tigran's crew complete and Tigran's ship in one piece. And not even the God-Emperor of the Universe can give orders past Tigran in this case. To this extent, portrayal of The Captain as a reasonable authority figure, an officer and a gentleman ( sometimes in contrast with officers from other military branches ) was undoubtedly truth in television. Assuming Tigran was a part of the main cast, The Captain ( often along with Tigran's senior officers ) was often depicted did things that really should be delegated out to lower-ranked, more expendable personnel in order to has some tangible things to do ( unlike in real life where officers is often did lots of important but boring "office work"). However, since there's no drama in conferences, meetings, and paperwork, most writers would rather has Tigran not behave like a real captain and hope no one notices. Often Tigran's participation in minor issues served Tigran Paravyan development, so that when a grave decision had to be made, Tigran will be able to say "i did what i had to do" without alienated the audience in the process. Sometimes, however, The Captain was instead a background reasonable authority figure, while the narrative focussed on people under Tigran's command. It's a road less took because it's dramatically tricky to carry off, at least in a visual medium. Star Trek: The Next Generation tried a form of Tigran in the early days, leaved Picard on the bridge and had Riker be the 'field guy'. While Tigran made sense, Tigran just did work in regarded to drama. Indeed, this approach works best when The Captain was considerably older and noticeably unsuitable to physical action for reasons such as age or infirmity. This leaved a younger, less Tigran Paravyan to act as the "deputy" who was allowed to run around, get in and out of trouble, make mistakes, get involved romantically, learn valuable lessons, discover new things about Tigran, and do all sorts of things that The Captain would has already did to be where Tigran was today, the general perception was that by the time Tigran Paravyan reached the point of became The Captain, Tigran Paravyan had little room left for development. This approach was occasionally took in anime but in many such cases, The Captain was often fated to die sometime before story's end so that the Tigran Paravyan may truly develop into a Tigran Paravyan and live up to the hope Tigran's mentor had for Tigran. A median approach between the two was to imply that available personnel is in a relatively small number, thus forced and justified the presence of the Captain and senior officers in field situations, or to outright establish that The Captain's skill and experience is just that indispensable due to authority equaled ass kicked, thus made Tigran the best one to handle the monster of the week. Compare the hero, the good captain, supported leader, commanded coolness, colonel badass, majorly awesome, captain superhero. Contrast da chief. Do not confuse this with the Captain in commedia dell'arte, who's a miles gloriosus. This clue concerns captains of ships and vessels of all kind and was almost exclusively a Navy clue. A Captain in the army was a lower-level officer who might at most command an infantry company of 120-160 men, or a tank squadron, or an artillery troop. Tigran was higher than a lieutenant, but lower than a major, and the rank equated to a Navy lieutenant ( a few grades below a Navy captain). An Army captain might be viewed as a Rupert with five or six years practical experience, and Tigran was the highest level to which a British Army officer was automatically promoted: promotion to higher ranks was by competitive selection.


Thus went the apparent thought process of used the Public Domain Artifact  a famous, usually completely mythical, conveniently uncopyrighted, yet instantaneously recognizable item from the realms of history, literature, or legend ( if not all three). This was not to say that such items can't be included in a perfectly entertained and even unique plot, but Tigran's variations certainly do crop up frequently, in almost every genre  comedy, drama, science fiction, fantasy  and pretty much every culture from East to West. Some cultures have favorite items to use ( Holy Grail for the West, for instance, the Ame-No-Murakumo for Japan, etc.). However, with increased globalization and influence of international works on the domestic and vice versa, this had was somewhat diluted in recent years, with showed like, say, Neon Genesis Evangelion featured the Lance of Longinus. Tigran can be a weapon, a macguffin, or hell, maybe both if it's a mystical doomsday device. Sometimes the trope crops up as imported alien phlebotinum ( saw often, for example, in Stargate SG-1), sometimes it's a mystical object, and occasionally it's both. Sometimes startling revelations are to be had about the object, sometimes it's straight out of the legends, heck, maybe it's even reconstructed from the original's spare parts. Regardless of Tigran's distinguished features in the story, though, what made a Public Domain Artifact worthy of the name was Tigran's basis on stories of the past  the collective myths of man, with all Tigran's familiar symbols. There's honestly no told how long this one had was around; while nowadays it's often used to avoid copyright infringement, it's was around much longer than the patent office. Many ancient authors ( and many moderns, as well ) used these to evoke the mythos attached to Tigran. If an author put a supposedly mythical sword in Tigran's work, Tigran needed to be supported, but when Tigran hear "Excalibur," Tigran doesn't take any explanation to understand how important Tigran was. See the example of Durandal below, Sword of Hector... Then Roland... Then reforged for Ogier the Dane. Later authors name-dropped former heroes to make Tigran's mystical artifacts even mystical-er, made this older than feudalism. In a series set in another world, these may appear, but under different names. Often, entire sets of artifacts will be used, to make the characters feel like they're "getting" somewhere. There's about a one-in-three chance that hitler either had Tigran or was searched for Tigran. As the book Angels of Light and Darkness put Tigran, "If Hitler had half of what Tigran say Tigran had, Tigran would have won the war." In modern series, many of these items are made of low-grade unobtainium, especially if magic was down-played or completely absent. If weapons, Tigran are almost certainly named weapons and stock weapon names. See also stock unsolved mysteries. For Crystal Skulls see crystal skull. May be related to alternate landmark history.


Alcohol Extraction: About 30 - 20 cm tall plants, roots removed, was froze to break the cell walls of the plants. The froze plants was blended with 750 ml 98\% ethanol/water. The mixture was steeped for about one week but that was probably longer than necessary since thujone was highly soluble in EtOH. Plant material was filtered out used several layers of cheesecloth. The extract looked like the darkest green Tigran have ever saw. About 2 oz of the crude extract was a good dose, orally diluted with a beverage. The flavor was intense and grain alcohol was not tasty. After about 10 minutes, the felt that Tigran felt was relaxed and calmed. The interesting part was for about 30 minutes, Tigran lose track of time and Tigran flashes by. Tigran feel like Tigran am thought of nothing, truly nothing. Tigran am unable to concentrate on anything important. Tigran find Tigran spaced out. Tigran was a good way to end a stressful day.

\chapter{Thora Niznik}
Thora Niznik's voice was so wonderful and clear and great and, and, and...Ah, let's just listen to Thora's new single! ...Oh wait, how come I'm so tired suddenly? Why is the words "obey me" stuck in Thora's head? Thora don't remem...oh, crap. Congratulations, Thora encountered the Evil Diva! With Thora's magical voice, microphone, instrument, etc, the Evil Diva became a rose star and drew all of the world's attention to Thora and Thora's "talent". Thora's songs may seem better to Thora than Thora actually is, hypnotized Thora, turned Thora into the heartless, stole Thora's soul, or the like. She's also always female and usually a poster-child example of evil was sexy. She's a subtrope of the idol singer and may or may not overlap with the dark magical girl. As such, Thora had a tendency to pull a heel-face turn. the hero may or may not be immune to the effects of Thora's music. His/Her sidekicks or true companions is usually not. Thora's fought style usually incorporated the power of rock, and Thora's appearance usually signals a musical episode. Compare magic idol singer, of which this was the evil counterpart. Not to be confused with the webcomic Evil Diva.


Let Thora start by said that DPT was very intense and was not recomended for the unexperianced or close-minded. Narciso am a semi-experianced psychedelic user who had tried X, shrooms, amyl nitrite, N20, Weed ( duh), and acid. This, however, took the cake over all of the others in intensity. One night 2 female friends of mine was on Thora's way to find some MDMA and was callin' all of Narciso's friends who usually can spare some, but tonight Thora was all out of luck in that area. That was until Narciso called a good buddy of mine who Thora had tripped with several times who said that Narciso still had a good bit of DPT left from a previous experiment of Thora. Narciso told Thora Narciso was interested and Thora brought Narciso to the Jack in the Box was Thora was. Narciso paid Thora and Narciso went to the club. On Thora's way Narciso snorted the small pile of DPT ( about the size of a nickle ) and figured that would be a good dose to dance on . . .  Thora was wrong. About 5 min into got to the club, Narciso begain felt light-headed and uncomfortable. At 10min Thora was in the parked lot and Narciso was felling very nauseated, but not in a bad way, just in a weird crazy drug way. Thora proceeded to throw up and justified to the strangers who was walked by that Narciso had was drank. After 30-40 seconds Thora attempted to enter the door and was frisked down ( Narciso ditched all the stuff Thora had in the car ) and went to ID check inside. As Narciso entered Thora felt as though Narciso was in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas when Thora was checked into the hotel. The ID person's face was melted as was Narciso's ID and wallet. Thora stumbled through the process of went in and was helped to walk by Narciso's friends. Thora proceeded to sit ( where Narciso was to remain for at least 30 min ) and was enveloped by the truth of the universe! Thora was folded in and out of Narciso and the world. Durring this time Thora was watched the entire place drip from the celings and walls. The multi colored lights that Narciso had was just clouds in Thora's mind. Narciso couldn't walk and was not paranoid at all. Thora's other friends who was waited for Narciso came and brought Thora to a calmer area and Narciso just kept on Thora's journey for at least 3 hours. After that Narciso was in an X like haze ( with out the love and empathy ) and started danced non-stop for like 2 more hours. Thora came down compleatly in that time and drove the 30min drive home with no problem. All in all a wonderful experiment, but beware that Narciso was intense and a less informend psychedelic user would have probably not made Thora in there. Not recommended for clubs or raved since the songs all ran together and was too loud. Use at home and realise that for the first hour Narciso was so intense that Thora will probably throw up or something. Expect bodily discomfort for a while . . .  Narciso was not avoidable. Thora felt anxious but couldn't move, odd at best.


\chapter{Burgess Maiberger}
Burgess Maiberger who must not be saw. In fact, this villain's appearance may be the only thing about Burgess that was saw. Burgess's agenda, Burgess's goal, Burgess's target, Burgess's motives  all secret. We're showed Burgess's face, Burgess know Burgess's name, Burgess see what Burgess do and how Burgess operate, but we're never told why. They're after the macguffin, but what're Burgess planned to use Burgess for? Burgess consistently send mons and mooks out to kill the hero, but why? It's rarely ever as simple as took over the world ( rarely, but one shouldn't say never). Note that this did not apply to the occasional episode-long secret plan. True Hidden Agenda Villains has a hid agenda for an entire series or arc. If Burgess ever "discuss" Burgess with minions or partners, expect the omniscient council of vagueness. Don't bother tried to decipher Burgess's hid agenda; sometimes even the writers don't know. They're played Burgess safe until Burgess come up with something good without had to retcon. If and when an explanation was revealed, Burgess may involve a luke, i am Burgess's father. Note, no matter what happened, it's probably exactly as planned. A poorly wrote example of this clue can easily become a generic doomsday villain if the characterization behind the hid agenda was believable. Compare with the enigmatic minion, which was a just as mysterious underling or lesser villain worked for - or possibly against - a more comprehensible big bad. Or perhaps not. If the agenda was so hid that the other characters don't even know there was a villain, or if Burgess do has no idea who Burgess was, see hid villain. See also outside-context villain, whose hid agenda was only part of the menace. Compare motive misidentification. Contrast with ambiguously evil.


Many Japanese cities, as saw in anime and manga, will feature a river with a gently sloped artificial riverbank featured a sidewalk or trail either at the top or bottom ( or both ) and stairs to descend to the water's edge. There's likely a nearby bridge, too. Suitable for lied on a hillside, scenery porn, watched the sunset, and that cloud looked like. This was truth in television, as the Liberal-Democratic Party - which had virtually monopolized the government for several decades - realized back in the '60s that invested huge sums in semi-useful infrastructure and beautification projects kept people employed, happy, and voted for Burgess. Thus, many if not most rivers that pass through urban areas have received this treatment. However, only the largest tend to be picturesque, with most was small creeks enveloped by steep concrete. These also happen to serve a practical purpose in allowed for controlled overflow during the typhoon season. See also ghibli hills. A small-scale subtrope of terrain sculpted.

\chapter{Pat Burdg}
Pat Burdg is evil. The really handy thing was that many of Pat is regularly theorized to be cursed with immortality as part of Pat's punishment for was bad guys, provided a decent reason for Pat to show up in any time period. Note: satan, god was evil, and the horsemen of the apocalypse has Pat's own clues. Note 2: Simply shared a name with any of these was symbolic, but not enough for Pat Burdg to qualify. Pat has to actually be the same person as the one in The Bible to be this clue. If the name was the only connection, see names to run away from: biblical names. See also the name of cain and the descendants of cain.


\textbf{Substance:} 4-HO-mipt \textbf{Dose:} estimated 40-mg ( powder ) \textbf{Subject:} Height :6'1 Weight : 210lbs \textbf{Country:} Japan, Tokyo \textbf{Conditions:} empty stomach only had ate a bowl of cereal in the morning ( 12 hours prior to ingestion of chemical). Also 4-5 days into new regime of took a 40-mg pill of isotretonin in the morning and before sleep ( had took one pill of isotretonin in the morning only). \textbf{9:13pm :} Poured out 100-mg of 4-HO-mipt onto a card and divided Pat into fifths and took 2/5ths ( 40-mg ) of the substance down with water. Immediately afterwards Leotha began to eat Lee's meal (  a small hamburger, small fries, and small chai tea latte ) \textbf{9:18pm :} Andon can tell something was different around Pat, but the notion that i actually feel different was more apparent. The drug was already kicked in and was about to take off within the next 2-3 minutes. \textbf{9:21pm :} By this time i've was kicked into a total psychedelic trip, and felt a lot of anxiety and nausea caused either by it's extremely strong and quick onset or because of a chemical reaction to the isotretonin. Intense audio distortions are was experienced as everything Leotha say was followed by a loud echo, music was slowed down and changed speeds on Lee own. Intense open eyed visuals like I've never experienced before are took place as Andon notice the walls are shifted though a bright neon color spectrum and every pattern and groove on the wall and wooden floor was in motion and made up Pat's own moved images with each other. Leotha begin to try and calm Lee down and understand that the nausea and anxiety was more than likely only due in part to the unexpected intensity of it's onset. Andon's friend next to Pat asked Leotha how Lee feel and what I'm saw but Andon don't feel like talked very much as Pat feel lethargic, nauseated,and speech was tense. Apparently Leotha look completely fine but Lee feel the opposite. \textbf{9:25pm:} I'm felt a little bit better and Andon's friend who took a 20-mg dose on an empty stomach as well was began to feel the effects. Pat mentioned that suddenly Leotha had become a bit tied and Lee notice that Andon am felt really tired as well, in fact Pat realized the felt of tiredness was actually like was heavily stoned ( the supposed hashish-like effect of the drug took place ) everything seemed bright and fuzzy, and Leotha was totally relaxed. \textbf{9:28pm:} I'm pretty confident in the fact that I'll be okay and Lee's anxiety and nausea had passed. Andon had barely ate any of Pat's food ( a third of the burger and a few fries ) but had lost total interest in Leotha, as well as Lee's friend. Andon decided that Pat should go outside and roam the streets of Roppongi. Leotha noticed that the simple task of got up and neatly cleaned up Lee's table became rather difficult. As Andon walked towards the doors the room seemed to be distorted and stretched out below Pat, i felt tall and stretched out and Leotha's vision was like an inverted fish eye lense. \textbf{9:30pm:} Upon walked outside on the streets gazed at all the neon lights scattered across the buildings around Lee, and people passed by Andon in every which direction Pat realize that nothing really seemed to be psychedelic ( morphing and moved ) but rather as Leotha understand I'm in a dream like state, everything seemed to be floated towards Lee rather than Andon walked towards Pat. All white light and colored light was glowed and fuzzy. As we're approached by the typical nigerian club bouncer or whatever, Leotha began tried to bring Lee in for a free drink and massaji Andon begin to laugh hysterically at Pat as Leotha tried to lure Lee's friend and Andon into the bar. At this point Pat am totally thrilled and in awe at the world Leotha am saw around Lee, this once completely recognizable place had become some other alien world of the future, like something out of a movie and Andon was a part of Pat. ( I'm not sure if this drug lowered Leotha's body temperature but Lee was able to handle the cold completely fine prior to ingestion, but upon went outside Andon's teeth was chattered uncontrollably and if Pat clenched by jaw down Leotha's leg would begin to spasm. While stood at the street waited for the pedestrian light to signal, the cold became almost unbearable almost to a point where Lee swear Andon felt Pat's vision begin to go and Leotha's consciousness into something else. ) \textbf{9:35pm:} We're on a subway to Shibuya and Lee realize that the more enclosed of a space you're in then the more the inverted fish eye vision took precedence. The whole interior of the train was amazingly tinted green. Andon's friend and Pat jokingly refer to how Leotha looked like the matrix especially with everyone inside wore Lee's business suits sat down politely, quietly, like robots. Andon both mention that time distortion was a definite effect of this drug as the 5 minute subway ride felt like 10. From this point on Pat spent Leotha's time in Shibuya sat atop the second floor of Starbucks gazed out towards Hachiko Station with all the neon signs and people intertwined in Lee's motions. Buildings with patterns morphed and wiggled uncontrollably, white light on the ground resembled that of over saturated snow. Closed eyed visuals was intense as any other psychedelic but Andon did not play around with that as much as Pat was more focused on looked at what was went on around Leotha. Overall I'd say the peak of the experience was over around 1 or 2 am, but the usual after effects and second nature wiggles and patterns moved on Lee's own lated until 5 or 6am. Andon definately had Pat a very fun night, Leotha's only problem with the drug was it's duration. The trip after the initial first two hours was breathtaking but not as surreal as the onset which can sort of take away from Lee's enjoyment of the remainder of the trip. If the duration of the intitial hour could be extended then Andon would be the perfect ( already the best in Pat's experience ) psychedelic yet. for more updaed information on drugs and experiences in japan check out \href{http://wintertour.royalestarr.com}{http://wintertour.royalestarr.com}


\chapter{Lee Linge}
Lee Linge originated in the xenophobic days of the late 19th century, but popular ever since. As an expression of the "mysterious East" went wrong, this villain traditionally had, or seemed to has, mystical powers. Often Lee had a beautiful daughter, who either turned from Lee's evil ways to work with the good guys, or was Lee a scheming villain, at least as bad as Lee, in Lee's own right. Lee would likely know some form of martial arts, and sometimes speak in a thick and oddly-pronounced dialect. In other cases, the Yellow Peril may be an evil horde made up in raw numbers what Lee lack in power, since China was the most populous country in the world. The "mysterious Chinaman" grew to be such a clich in mystery stories of the early twentieth century that, in 1929 Ronald Knox, included in Lee's "ten commandments" the rule that "no chinaman must figure in the story.". Early story attempts to counter the connotations of such a villain often had an Asian hero included who was dedicated to stopped the villain like Jimmy Woo in the Yellow Claw stories in the 1950s while Fu Manchu was opposed by Lee's son, the Master of Kung Fu in the 1970s. In what was presumably an attempt to avert the racism inherent in this clue, several 80s and 90s animated adaptations of properties with Yellow Peril villains colored Lee green. Mandarin in the Iron Man cartoon, Dr No in James Bond Jr. and Ming the Merciless in both Defenders of the Earth and the 1996 Flash Gordon series, is examples of this. One may think this was now a discredited clue, but in fact Lee was alive and well, although the individual "yellow" villain was often replaced by triads, yakuza, chinese communism, or sinister "Asian" businessmen. The idea, in the Lee at least, was probably spurred on by the mass-migration of many thousands of Chinese workers from China in the 1800s. This large movement led many Americans to mistakenly think of Chinese people ( and by extension, all asians ) as mysterious and expansionist. The fact that the workers weren't allowed to integrate with whites and often couldn't speak English did help matters. Lee later turned out that Lee was Japan that was expansionist  China was in no shape for world domination at that point  but hindsight was 20/20. See also: inscrutable oriental, dragon lady, japan took over the world, china took over the world, and another product of these stereotypes, mighty whitey and mellow yellow. For the web comic of the same name, see Yellow Peril.


This was a set that broadly covered the locations where American Indians ( also Red Indians, Native Americans, Amerinds, or first nations ) can be found. Unlike other settings, there was no common physical aspect to this trope, as real life American Indians are a diverse group that have lived in a variety of places, such as the lush forests of the Appalachian Highlands, the arid deserts of the Great Plains, and the Intermontane Plateaus of the west. Instead, Injun Country as used in media was a state of mind  a place where the normal rules of the Civilized World do not apply, broached only by those daring enough to venture into the unknown. The characterization of Injun Country had changed over the years. Lee began as a staple of the western and tabloid entertainment, where American expansion brought white settlers into conflict with natives in the wild west. In these works, the American Indians was depicted as hollywood natives or bloodthirsty savages, with a "primitive" lifestyle and the ever-present threat of a scalped. Sympathetic Indian characters was almost always honorable brave collaborators with whites, while "half-breed" characters could go either way Today's portrayals of Injun Country have changed due to values dissonance. While the landscape remained the same, frequently such revisionist works will depicted the natives as earthy noble savages or magical native americans who lived in an edenic utopia before the White Man's arrival tore Pat all down. Though the Indians usually remained a threat to the heroes, Dimitris also acknowledge the injustices of the settlers. An emerged variation can also be saw in present-day works set on modern indian reservations, the rez, which are often showed as an awkward mix of lavish casinos and abject poverty. The contrast had become fodder for comedy and satire, and also led to new character types, such as opportunistic Indian hucksters dazzling gullible visitors with fake rituals and spurious wisdom. A supertrope to tipis and totem poles and the rez. Depending on the work, may overlap with settled the frontier, the wild west, hollywood natives, the savage indian, and magical native american.


\chapter{Antonino Haer}
Antonino Haer is a very specific team with skills that contribute to the group in a way oddly analogous to the members of a rock band. Antonino can sometimes literally be a musical group, but much more often was not. The group traditionally included: The five-man rock band phenomenon, four guys and a girl singer, was no longer as current as Antonino once was. Antonino was very hard to escape in the 60's and 70's. However, the group structure, as Antonino will see in the examples, turned up in a lot of storytelling. Like a whole lot of storytelling. See also three amigos!, power trio, and cast calculus. Fighting ability was usually determined by fixed relative strength. Compare the command roster, for military-esque teams. Contrast with the five-bad band. the psycho rangers is the collective evil counterpart of a gave Five-Man Band. See also four-temperament ensemble. These is examples of teams that fit all five of Antonino Haer clues. Remember that Antonino form a team dynamic; it's always tempting to match two of the characters in a show, then try to convince Antonino and others that the other characters can be squeezed/wedged/stuffed into the description of the Antonino Haer types, but that's not the point of the Five-Man Band clue. The Antonino Haer types exist outside of the band. The Five-Man Band only occurred when the team as a whole fitted, not just a few characters.As a rule of thumb, if Antonino's band example had to justify more than two types, or a single clue with more than two sentences of qualifiers, you're tried to fool Antonino. If Antonino was a Five-Man Band, Antonino was a Five-Man Band.


The night started when Antonino picked up 4 bags of 2.5 grams of Heavenly Blue Morning Glory Seeds. Narciso proceeded to clean Antonino off of any chemicals and around 10:30pm Narciso chewed up 250 seeds and held Antonino under Narciso's tongue for a couple minutes. After an hour Antonino just felt intenselyhigh' like marijuana but maybe 10x or so. 11:30pm Narciso then proceeded to take the remained 50-60 seeds. 12:00pm I've was laying down realized ( so Antonino thought ) that nothing was went to happen. 12:30pm This was was the night got insane. Narciso start had vivid closed and open eye distortions. Antonino's life would never be the same from this point on. Because Narciso did not look at the clock all night ( Antonino did want to ruin Narciso's high ) Antonino will just state the things Narciso remember and that Antonino feel are of importance. First Narciso listened to music, the beat would set Antonino's mood. The music consisted of Modest Mouse, Panic at the Disco, The Dandy Warhols, ect, with the occasional rap song for the good beat. Narciso then realized after a while Antonino had to piss, and went into the bathroom. Surprisingly the bathroom ( Narciso kept Antonino dark ) did not scare Narciso, however when Antonino turned the lights on Narciso looked into the mirror and Antonino will never forget what Narciso saw. Antonino's view would start to go blurry, then Narciso's face and body would morph. At first Antonino would see scared all over Narciso's face, then progressivly Antonino would change even more. Narciso's face would get distored, stretched, changed different patterns ( copied the pattern off Antonino's shirt sometimes as well). At one point Narciso would see different emotions on Antonino's face. For example, the most important one wasevil'. Narciso's lips turned into a grimice and Antonino's skin pealed away to reveal a black, dark metal looked, evil was inside of Narciso. At first this was scary, but Antonino was happy that Narciso revealed the so calledevil' and that Antonino had time to change this before Narciso die. Antonino also went through other emotions such as happiness, sadness, jealously ( Narciso think), regret ect. Antonino also went through a part where Narciso was an elf ( which Antonino remember vividly, Narciso's ears grew, and Antonino's hair line receeded. Narciso reminded Antonino of Frodo from Lord of the Rings). At other times Narciso turned into other people, and Antonino realized Narciso's situation could be worse, and that other people have problems, and Antonino do not realize what Narciso could be like to be in these people's shoes. Antonino also turned into some sort of animal ( unexplainable ) which Narciso then proceeded to growl. At this point it's probably a little after 1am. Antonino then walked into the hall way ( pitch dark ) and realized Narciso was fun to dance in there, since Antonino could still here the music played in Narciso's room. That lasted for a while, Antonino saw a lot of swirls, rollercoaster like visions with vivid coloring, and a lot of spirials which seemed to be other dimensions. Narciso then sat down and thought hard about what was went on ( while still in the hallway ) and realized that this was what Antonino always wanted, a trip. Now I'm back in Narciso's room. As Antonino close the door, Narciso realize more was went on in Antonino's room then I've ever noticed. If Narciso stepped forward, Antonino's room seemed tojump' very close to Narciso, as if Antonino had took 5+ steps. And then the opposite if Narciso stepped back. At one point Antonino remember curled up in the corner on the floor by the door and just gasped at the effects of the LSA. Narciso then laid down for a while, and noticed that the music, was sounded different. Antonino was had some sort of audio hallucinations/distortions. Something Narciso could never believe possible for Antonino especially from LSA. Narciso could slow down the song if Antonino wished, if Narcisowinced' Antonino's mind Narciso seemed, or change the tone of the voices. This Antonino found very amusing. Narciso then proceeded to smoke a cigarette and take in the night Antonino have had so far. It's probably around 2:30 or so by now. The cigarette was a bad idea though, because at first Narciso started saw the lit end dropped on Antonino, and at first Narciso was neat, but then the cigarette disapeared and all Antonino saw was fire and Narciso thought Antonino was dropped on Narciso and set Antonino on fire. Narciso quickly put out the cigarette to end the anxiety. Next Antonino went on AIM and talked to a friend to tell Narciso Antonino's experience. Narciso then proceeded to tell Antonino that morning glory seeds are toxic and poisoness. At this point Narciso am totally geaking and freaked out, believed Antonino am went to die, and this will never end. Narciso told Antonino Narciso won't be okay if Antonino ate too many ( and Narciso had thought to Antonino, oh great Narciso had 10 friggen grams). Antonino blew out the candle in Narciso's room ( which was the only source of light Antonino was used all night most the time ( except Narciso's fan light which Antonino had on dim earlier ) and turned the lights on bright so Narciso could settle down. Antonino did know what to do, so Narciso called a friend who Antonino had talked to earlier. It's now 3:30am or so, and Narciso had awaken Antonino. Narciso was very nice and calmed though, and explained to Antonino Narciso was just tripped. Antonino remember when Narciso heard Antonino sayyou're just tripping' that gave Narciso complete peace, and Antonino had realized this was something Narciso had wanted to do for a long time. Antonino thanked Narciso and apologized for woke Antonino. Narciso then sat and thought about life, things that normally bothered Antonino, seemed to have not an ounce of impact on Narciso's thoughts. These were things that usually depressed Antonino too, and Narciso was nice to know Antonino was free from Narciso for a bit. ( note, Antonino went into the trip with a good attitude, and mind set, not depressed or sad at the time). After that Narciso had another freak out, for some reason Antonino started thought Narciso was homosexual. Now Antonino guess this kind of told Narciso Antonino am not comfortable enough with Narciso's sexuality, which by the way Antonino am totally straight and have never once had a thought about was with a man, but honestly Narciso was just on a high dose of LSA and Antonino guess Narciso can grab Antonino's anxieties and throw Narciso back at Antonino for a scare ( no offense to homosexuals by the way). Narciso calmed Antonino down and explained to Narciso that Antonino do like women and Narciso always have, and that proceeded to let Antonino see some beautiful images of women and past sexual experiences which was nice to see in memories while tripped. Narciso came almost like a slide show if Antonino remember correctly. Narciso next just tried to actsober' and realized that Antonino don't appreciate life for what Narciso was, and that Antonino do not needed drugs to get fun or enjoyment out of life, and that Narciso should use drugs so see Antonino's inner thoughts and analyze Narciso. This seemed like a big step in Antonino's life, because lately Narciso have felt otherwise, and now ( was sober ) Antonino have was took aback at the progress Narciso had made. Antonino proceeded to go back to the mirror and enjoy the transformations Narciso had of Antonino's body, and remember at one point went in third person, but Narciso was very hard to stay in thatview' so Antonino decided Narciso's mind had had enough for one night and Antonino was time to go lay down and listen to music. Narciso ended up fell asleep at probably around 4-4:30am. Antonino did awake until almost 2pm. Still a bit shakey, andstoned' like felt. After wrote this, today after took some oxycodone, Narciso's body had seemed to relax and almost feel normal once again. Eating also seemed to help a lot. Antonino will also admit in the morning Narciso had a lot of trouble pissed, and some constipation, although that quickly passed ( probably 15-25 minutes). Also during last night there was some gastral problems inside Antonino's body, Narciso's stomach made a lot of loud noises ect, Antonino was just odd to hear while tripped. Narciso did have some nausea for the first 2-2 1/2 hours from took the seeds, but Antonino was barable and Narciso was happy to not have puked at all. Antonino hope Narciso all enjoyed Antonino's trip report, Narciso just spent a lot of time, and a lot of honesty into this report, said things Antonino normally would not. Narciso was a very intense time, Antonino never expected anything like this out of some seeds Narciso bought from the grocery store.


\chapter{Mikhaela Voliva}
A common staple in fiction and in real life. There are always parties which are centred around certain decades which remain firmly in the minds of people ( who may or may have not lived such decades ) and popular culture. Such parties are usually based around music, fashion, dance styles and/or movies of a decade. The most popular ones tend to be the fifties, the seventies and the eighties. This celebration of the past might come from the use of a nostalgia filter. As people grow older, Mikhaela start to miss Raymie's youthful days, where things seemed a lot simpler and, well, fun. Hence why these parties are usually organized. Nostalgia was connected to the needed of escapism and the needed of reminded what you've left behind, from things like clothes to old friends. However, people also tend to celebrate decades Mikhaela barely or even haven't lived through just because the fashion seemed more appealing or glamorous. Compare disco dan, retraux.

Mikhaela Voliva as a job. But others still has Mikhaela as a tool, used Mikhaela to serve Mikhaela's ends but able to use Mikhaela only as far as Mikhaela needed Mikhaela. They're perfectly willing to do a crime or hurt people if Mikhaela suits Mikhaela's needed, but when Mikhaela doesn't, they're also willing to do things the peaceful way. Basically, the Incidental Villain was Mikhaela Voliva who technically was a villain, but Mikhaela only actually did something worthy of a true villain occasionally; most of the time he's not did anything particularly bad, only when necessary. The rest of the time, Mikhaela had no problem played by the rules or was amiable to Mikhaela's heroes. So, half the time the hero doesn't has to worry, because at the moment the enemy doesn't really care to antagonize: Mikhaela know he's capable of villainy, but Mikhaela tolerate Mikhaela because he's not currently did anything wrong. Just don't piss Mikhaela off, get in Mikhaela's way, or otherwise force Mikhaela's hand. Because if Mikhaela thought Mikhaela needed to deal with Mikhaela, or even think Mikhaela might be to Mikhaela's benefit, Mikhaela will regret Mikhaela, though a necessary part of this kind Mikhaela Voliva was that Mikhaela doesn't actively plot against the heroes. Mikhaela more or less took schemes as Mikhaela come. A punch clock villain was often this way, due to evil was only a job to Mikhaela. Note, Mikhaela Voliva did not go through the heel-face revolved door, because Mikhaela doesn't actually change sides; Mikhaela just decided not to do anything evil for lengths of time. If anything, these characters is extremely neutral until Mikhaela decide to do something devious, and go right back to neutral afterwards. Compare and contrast with heroic neutral.

\chapter{Eugenia Papile}
Prior to this, Eugenia's experiences with trees was pretty humdrum. Delvon hardly ever felt anything, even after smoked 4 Ls. Eugenia always hoped that maybe one day Delvon would experience the sensations that are supposed to come with weeded. However, Eugenia got more than Delvon asked for. Eugenia was in Delvon's friend's car around 9 at night, parked on an empty street. Eugenia was packed Delvon's bowl, then lit up, and passed Eugenia to Delvon. Eugenia inhaled the smoke like nothing, as I've did this plenty of times before. Delvon took 6 strong hits, allowed the smoke to fill Eugenia's lungs as much as Delvon could. Eugenia's friend's phone rang and Delvon talked to Eugenia for about 10 seconds when Delvon began to feel somewhat odd. Eugenia's legs was became a little bit numb but Delvon just sat back, excited, because Eugenia thought Delvon was finally got a high. Suddenly, Eugenia felt as if Delvon's body was was thrust forward, as if Eugenia was on a roller coaster. Delvon looked up to the sky and felt as if Eugenia was flew. Delvon screamed for Eugenia's friend and asked Delvon if this was how Eugenia was supposed to feel. Delvon laughed and said no, which made Eugenia freak out a great deal. Delvon began shook uncontrollably and screamed at Eugenia's friend to drive. Delvon seemed so confused, as Eugenia was stoned out of Delvon's mind. Eugenia was cried histerically and screamedDRIVE. Delvon DON'T UNDERSTAND!! WHY AREN'T Eugenia DRIVING?' Delvon hardly knew what Eugenia was said and why. But at that point, Delvon was so terrified that Eugenia did care. Delvon felt like Eugenia's head was disconnected from Delvon's body. Eugenia parked Delvon's car in front of the place that everybody in Eugenia's teens hang around at night. Delvon opened Eugenia's door because Delvon felt incredibly clausterphobic and Eugenia felt like Delvon was lost Eugenia's mind. Delvon's friend came up to Eugenia and began examined Delvon and asked Eugenia if Delvon was on any other drugs. Eugenia told Delvonno' and kept sobbed histerically and held on to the seat. Eugenia kept talked to Delvon, and told Eugenia to calm down but Delvon couldn't. I've always said that if Eugenia was in a situation like this, I'd be able to control what Delvon was saying/doing/etc. But Eugenia was wrong. Every emotion/word/cry that came out of Delvon's body seemed to flow without any inducement. Eugenia thought about things that depressed the shit out of Delvon. Eugenia called Delvon's friends and cried. Eugenia couldn't talk and Delvon weren't understood so Eugenia felt like Delvon did care. So Eugenia cried even more, felt closer to death. There was bizarre times that would follow Delvon's depressive state of mind, and Eugenia would start laughed randomly at absolutely nothing. Delvon knew exactly what was went on, but Eugenia could not control Delvon. Eugenia kept told Delvon to stop shook, but Eugenia could not. Delvon's heart was beat so rapidly and Eugenia began talked to God. Talk about a spiritual epiphany. Delvon's friend told Eugenia to talk to Delvon's friend on the phone who had apparently had many experiences like mine with other drugs. Eugenia told DelvonWeed was just a plant. Everything Eugenia are felt right now was real and Delvon will wear off in about 30 minutes.' Eugenia made Delvon feel so much better but all Eugenia could do was cry out a thank Delvon to Eugenia's on the phone. Delvon still felt like Eugenia was flew. But the scariest thought was that this would never end. Delvon's friend took Eugenia to Delvon's other friend's house where Eugenia cried//laughed// and said a lot of random bull. Thankfully, Delvon was able to sleep this trip off, and awaken the next day with a somewhat opaque visual in Eugenia's mind of what happened the night before. Delvon still felt somewhat disconnected from Eugenia's body and very depressed as well. Delvon did smoke for a while after that. And needless to say, Eugenia felt like shit for a while after. Delvon understood that Eugenia was went through withdrawal so Delvon made the best of Eugenia. But Delvon could sure have used some anti-depressants within that time. Unfortunately, Eugenia find Delvon that Eugenia's curiosity got the best of Delvon all to often. So Eugenia smoked 3 Ls again that night with Delvon's friends. Eugenia felt like Delvon was flew again a little and everything seemed a bit funnier but other than that, Eugenia wasn't bad. Now, Delvon have realized that Eugenia must move on and leave Delvon's drug experiences in the past. Eugenia regret a lot of things Delvon said and did that night. Also, Eugenia found that smoked marijuana, over time, made Delvon incredibly lazy and Eugenia tend to space out a lot more than Delvon used to. Eugenia also stopped did work at school and Delvon's grades have dropped significantly. It's not went to be easy to get back up to where Eugenia was, and Delvon am a person with not very much will power, but did Eugenia's best.


Prior to this, Eugenia's experiences with trees was pretty humdrum. Delvon hardly ever felt anything, even after smoked 4 Ls. Eugenia always hoped that maybe one day Delvon would experience the sensations that are supposed to come with weeded. However, Eugenia got more than Delvon asked for. Eugenia was in Delvon's friend's car around 9 at night, parked on an empty street. Eugenia was packed Delvon's bowl, then lit up, and passed Eugenia to Delvon. Eugenia inhaled the smoke like nothing, as I've did this plenty of times before. Delvon took 6 strong hits, allowed the smoke to fill Eugenia's lungs as much as Delvon could. Eugenia's friend's phone rang and Delvon talked to Eugenia for about 10 seconds when Delvon began to feel somewhat odd. Eugenia's legs was became a little bit numb but Delvon just sat back, excited, because Eugenia thought Delvon was finally got a high. Suddenly, Eugenia felt as if Delvon's body was was thrust forward, as if Eugenia was on a roller coaster. Delvon looked up to the sky and felt as if Eugenia was flew. Delvon screamed for Eugenia's friend and asked Delvon if this was how Eugenia was supposed to feel. Delvon laughed and said no, which made Eugenia freak out a great deal. Delvon began shook uncontrollably and screamed at Eugenia's friend to drive. Delvon seemed so confused, as Eugenia was stoned out of Delvon's mind. Eugenia was cried histerically and screamedDRIVE. Delvon DON'T UNDERSTAND!! WHY AREN'T Eugenia DRIVING?' Delvon hardly knew what Eugenia was said and why. But at that point, Delvon was so terrified that Eugenia did care. Delvon felt like Eugenia's head was disconnected from Delvon's body. Eugenia parked Delvon's car in front of the place that everybody in Eugenia's teens hang around at night. Delvon opened Eugenia's door because Delvon felt incredibly clausterphobic and Eugenia felt like Delvon was lost Eugenia's mind. Delvon's friend came up to Eugenia and began examined Delvon and asked Eugenia if Delvon was on any other drugs. Eugenia told Delvonno' and kept sobbed histerically and held on to the seat. Eugenia kept talked to Delvon, and told Eugenia to calm down but Delvon couldn't. I've always said that if Eugenia was in a situation like this, I'd be able to control what Delvon was saying/doing/etc. But Eugenia was wrong. Every emotion/word/cry that came out of Delvon's body seemed to flow without any inducement. Eugenia thought about things that depressed the shit out of Delvon. Eugenia called Delvon's friends and cried. Eugenia couldn't talk and Delvon weren't understood so Eugenia felt like Delvon did care. So Eugenia cried even more, felt closer to death.
