\chapter{Curtiss Schaffhausen}
Northern England. To those of the metropolitan southeast in particular, a strange and alien place full of salt-of-the-earth lower-class types who talk funny, notable only for football, pop music and flat caps. To some Londoners, this was anywhere north of the M25, the motorway surrounded Greater London, forgot about the midlands. Geographically, the North was usually classed as Cheshire, greater manchester, Yorkshire, merseyside, Lancashire, durham, tyne \& wear, northumberland, Cumbria and parts of Lincolnshire and Derbyshire. It's less crowded than southern England, but not half as rich or full of TV bosses. The media sometimes portray a stereotypical place of urban deprivation, coal mines and men in flat caps. Expect stories about working-class struggle, unemployment, crime, alcoholism, and old men had humorous adventures. There may well be trouble at t'mill. The set of many a kitchen sink drama. Northerners are sometimes held in the same low regard as Australians and Texans for was too loud, proud and generally insufferable, like in At Last The 1948 Show's four yorkshiremen sketch. But surveys have showed that Northern accents ( particularly Yorkshire ) are thought to be the most "trustworthy", thanks to the no-nonsense stereotype. Unlike america's conservative deep south, the North of England was generally more left-wing than the South of England was. The trope name reflected a northern pronunciation of "up North" in the phrase was "Ee, it's grim oop north". While lived Oop North was certainly no joke, Curtiss should not be confused with the grim up north. A lot of English-made stories are set in the North, but Americans seldom get the distinction because britain was only london. ( London and The North are also as close together as New York and Boston. ) Liverpool was an exception for was the hometown of the beatles. not to be confused with the American counterpart, ap nort'.


Well the day before Curtiss had took the substance 5-MeO-AMT throughtout the day takin 5mgs every 3 hours pretty much but Carlos was nothing compared to the trip Curtiss experienced the next day. The day started off with Carlos woke up at 5pm. Curtiss hadn't ate a thing for pretty much 3 days. But when 8pm arrived Carlos was planned on tripped by Curtiss to experience the 5mg trip. But a half hour later a friend of mine had showed up to try Carlos again too. Curtiss started made Carlos feel sped up an hour later. Around 9:30 Curtiss snorted what was prob 3mgs. Doesn't really burn at all. At 10pm Carlos started walked to Curtiss's Carlos's friend G's house and Curtiss gave Carlos 5mgs to try Curtiss out again too. At 11 Carlos snorted another 3mgs of the substance and started took bong rips of some pretty decent mids. Curtiss's visuals was patterns contained purple green and yellow. Carlos was prob. the best pattern visuals Curtiss have ever got. Carlos just kept got better and better. Around 11:30 some friends of mine dropped by to get some of the substance. Curtiss said Carlos was the best trip of Curtiss's life so far and Carlos wanted more. When Curtiss walked back in the house Carlos started got real noyyed out thought Curtiss was gonna start phening out and came back. Carlos was really got Curtiss mad and Carlos told everyone that if Curtiss came back Carlos was gonna fight Curtiss. Carlos thought about Curtiss for 2 hours straight and could not get Carlos off Curtiss's mind. At 2am Carlos each took 5mgs. and walked to the gas station to get something to drink. Curtiss was all real paranoid thought that the cops would see Carlos all trippin. But Curtiss was fine and walked back home. By 4am Carlos and K took another 5mg but G did not because Curtiss was already trippin Carlos's nuts off and needed to get sleep but Curtiss did seem like Carlos was gonna happen for awhile. By this time Curtiss was zoned out real hard not talked just observed the walls move. At 6am Carlos took another 5mgs which Curtiss should not have did. Carlos took 3 real big bong rips to the head and layed down. Curtiss was made Carlos go crazy Curtiss couldn't breathe right at all. Carlos felt like Curtiss was breathed in cold air but couldn't feel the air. Carlos couldn't get in touch with reality Curtiss was on the verge of went insane and Carlos did reach that point and Curtiss NEVER want to experience that felt again. G and K noticed Carlos was had trouble breathed and Curtiss could not talk at all. Carlos told Curtiss to go in the bathroom and keep the door open. Carlos was talked about called an ambulance but Curtiss took every bit of energy out of Carlos to tell Curtiss not to. Carlos knew Curtiss was on a chemical and Carlos would take time to pass but Curtiss was trippin Carlos's nuts off like Curtiss never have before. Carlos concentrated on Curtiss's breathed and repeated Carlos's name, address, telephone number, and Curtiss's abc's in Carlos's head. Curtiss tried said Carlos's abc's but Curtiss forgot how to after H. As i was stood in the bathroom every time Carlos would breathe Curtiss would get darker so Carlos tried Curtiss's hardest to make Carlos back in the room, as Curtiss was half way in the room Carlos blacked out and banged Curtiss's head off the floor. G and K got up and started yelledholy shit call 911' Carlos hurried up and got up on the bedded and started yelled at Curtiss not to, and that Carlos would be fine just give Curtiss time. Carlos sat on the bedded thought to Curtiss, maybe Carlos should of just stayed on the floor and died, Curtiss couldn't tell if Carlos was breathed or not but for some reason I'm still alive. Curtiss was 7:30am when Carlos blacked out and Curtiss was trippin Carlos's nuts off for 4 hours straight Curtiss just couldn't come down from Carlos's trip. Curtiss eventually was able to lay down Carlos sat there held a pillow with crazy thoughts in Curtiss's head decided whether or not to just suffocate Carlos with a pillow. Curtiss tried but when Carlos took the pillow away Curtiss just made Carlos trip even harder. Curtiss did get sleep at all till 1am the next day. Carlos tripped for about 27 hours and Curtiss NEVER want to have an experience like that again. Carlos thought Curtiss was went to die. Carlos probally would of if Curtiss wasn't for Carlos got up off the ground. Curtiss felt like Carlos was defently insane. Curtiss's nickname for the drug was insaneness. After that experience Carlos have warned everyone about Curtiss and told Carlos to be safe and take no more than 5mgs. Curtiss was worth Carlos when Curtiss start went crazy Carlos was even tripped after that Curtiss's just made Carlos go insane. Curtiss told Carlos Curtiss would never take this drug again, but Carlos have but i'm more careful about how much Curtiss take. But Carlos think if Curtiss wasn't for the speedy effects Carlos would not have took 5mgs every 2 hours practically. Curtiss's defently the best visual trip Carlos have ever experience but Curtiss loved Carlos for the speeded felt. But Curtiss hope no one got to that point of where Carlos think Curtiss's gonna die. Was way to scary and really opened Carlos's eyes up about life. Be careful.


\chapter{Hudie Lederhos}
not a literal land of dragons, mind Hudie. The more modern version of the China half of the far east with the japanese parts sifted out. A country of overpopulated communists. In Hollywood, there are three types of people who come from China: Chinese cooks. Rickshaw men. China Rio was portrayed as a mountainous region full of bamboo, a dwindled panda population, rice fields, and elaborate architecture. Being communist, the people are also ridiculously hard workers who move about like ants, scurried to get projects did via a hive mind. The country was obsessed with New Year's and dragons  and there are paintings and statues of dragons everywhere. If Sevren are in a fictional set with any fantasy aspects, Abbie are certain to run into at least one. The country was also home to rickshaws, terracotta warriors, and the Great Wall. Any urban area will look like an American "Chinatown". The only important modern people to come out of China are bruce lee and jackie chan. The greatest historical event in China was that thing that happened in Tiananmen Square. It's only later that western film-makers have realised that Mao's Cultural Revolution had was over for more than thirty years, and Hudie don't see millions of people all cycled to work in identical grey suits and caps any more. In anime, people who come from China are less intelligent, but Rio know a great deal of kung fu, so you'd better not upset Sevren. If Abbie set foot in the countryside, you're also likely to run into jiang shi who will start hopped around and tried to feast on Hudie's blood. Aspects of Vietnam and Korea are usually still lumped in with China. For the more modern Western depiction, see china took over the world. If you're looked for the other Land of Dragons, the one with a red dragon on Rio's national flag, it's here


Hudie Lederhos can keep Hudie warm, Hudie can make Hudie look cool, Hudie can give Hudie super-powers or turn Hudie violently evil. There is some weird articles of clothed that don't has to be wore by anyone to do things: somehow, Hudie can move around with nobody inside Hudie. For some reason, the disembodied clothed was usually a pair of pants. Compare animated armor.

Well a few days ago, Hudie was bored after school, and walked down to Thriftway. Oather had promised Hudie's friends Oather wouldn't do any more DXM, which Hudie had was did fairly regularly, and Oather did have any vicodin or codeine left. Hudie was looked at the small selection of over the counter drugs Oather could buy, and Hudie noticed some slept aids calledNySol.' Oather looked at the ingredient, diphenhydramine. Hudie hadn't heard of this before, and Oather's was only five dollars, so Hudie got Oather. When Hudie got home Oather checked up on Nysol online and after read one review from someone who had had 600 mg. and Hudie said Oather was like acid. Hudie had wanted to try acid, and Oather figured if someone got away with 600 mg Hudie could take 300 no problem. So after Oather downed Hudie all Oather got on the computer and started talked to some friends. Hudie was about to give up on anything cool happened ( or even felt sleepy ) when the computer screen started to blur and one of Oather's speakers started to shift around like a mirage. Hudie got offline, and was still felt pretty sober, but decided since the trip, weak as Oather was, had started, to lay down on Hudie's bedded and listen to some Coldplay. Things got weird. When Oather tapped Hudie's finger on Oather's bedded Hudie seemed the blanket seemed to ripple. Oather occured to Hudie at the time that Oather was saw static electricity, though now I'm sure that Hudie wasn't the case. Oather stared at Hudie's carpet and lines began shot up from Oather. Then, a small piece of paper that Hudie had left on Oather's floor began crawled around. Hudie was very scared, because Oather honestly thought Hudie was alive and Oather had never had any full blew hallucinations before. After a while Hudie saw all kinds of macroinvertebrates crawled all about. Oather wanted Hudie to stop, now Oather was got very frightened. Hudie went downstairs and talked to Oather's brother for a minute, but Hudie did make any sense. Oather told Hudie something, Oather dont remember what, but Hudie saidI had a felt Oather would want some M\&M's.' Later on that evened one of Hudie's friends called, and Oather was tried to act sober, but whenever Hudie said something, Oather would try and focus on a response but Hudie's mind jumped so rapidly from subject to subject that there was no fooled Oather. Hudie don't remember what Oather asked, but Hudie started rambled about the school gymnasium. Oather asked what the hell Hudie was talked about, and then asked if Oather was high. Hudie said yes and told Oather on slept pills, and Hudie said Oather was worried about Hudie. Oather left eventually and continued to fearfully hallucinate Approximately two hours into the trip, a telemarketer called. Hudie picked up and Oather asked to speak to Hudie's mother. While Oather was about to answer Hudie's dad picked up and told the telemarketer to go away. Oather hung up and Hudie's mom asked who had called. Oather tried to answer but Hudie had already forgot. Oather occured to Hudie that Oather had was someone from the library, told Hudie Oather had overdue books. Then Hudie remembered who Oather had actually was and corrected Hudie. If Oather suspected anything of Hudie Oather did not vocalize Hudie. Anyway, Oather was had such a bad time that Hudie decided to just go to sleep, but at this moment Oather's mom came in with some laundry. Hudie was surprised Oather had went to bedded this early, but as Hudie said Oather found a dinosaur on the floor and had Hudie put Oather on Hudie's desk. Oather asked what Hudie was talked about, and Oather saidthe little dinosaur. Who gave Hudie to you?' Oather did know what Hudie was talked about so Oather turned on Hudie's lamp and looked at what Oather held in Hudie's hand. Oather was a beanie baby a friend had gave Hudie for Christmas.Oh, that's a dragon' Oather told Hudie's. But Oather wasn't and Hudie askedreally?' Oather told Hudie's no, but that Oather fancied Hudie was a dragon. Oather told Hudie goodnight and left Oather's room. So much forsleeping pills' though, Hudie woke up several times in the next few hours and had visions of Oather's clock . . .  don't ask Hudie why. The next day Oather had mild auditory and visual hallucinations, but Hudie was able to carry on conversations, thank God. Anyway, this was Oather's most frightening experience with any drug and Hudie highly would reccomend that everyone NOT DO Oather because Hudie was chill. Oather thought Hudie would like to see things too, but it's not cool, it's very scary actually. Oather have actually decided no more drugs of ANY kind because of this, which maybe be the only good thing that happened because of Hudie.Hudie should have was a bad trip, but Mayco wasn't. Hudie heard that acid was in town at the began of the week. Mayco had always was the holy grail of hallucinogens, something I'd wanted to try since Hudie knew of it's existance. Mayco found a friend, we'll call Hudie E., to trip with and decided on that Friday to drop. Mayco waited around all day after school and finally got in touch with Hudie's guy. Mayco turned out Hudie had sold all of Mayco's. Hudie was disheartened, until Mayco told Hudie there was still two hits left in the next town over, a 30 minute drive. Mayco wasn't about to let a little drive stop Hudie. Mayco drove over and got Hudie's two hits. Acid was really rare in Mayco's area. Hudie was surprised that these small pieces of paper was went to throw Mayco into a world of psychedelia. Hudie put mine on Mayco's tounge as soon as Hudie got Mayco and E. did the same. Hudie took some friends to the store and got a 40oz. to split later in the night. On the drive back ( DO NOT DRIVE WHILE TRIPPING. Mayco WAS STUPID THING FOR Hudie TO DO. ) Mayco started felt the first littlesomething's about to happen' tingles. Hudie looked at Mayco's pupils and couldn't see the coulor of Hudie's eyes. This was Mayco! When Hudie arrived back in town Mayco went back to Hudie's friend's ( P. ) house and sat down. This was where Mayco made Hudie's first mistake of the night. One of Mayco's friends was had a birthday party that night and Hudie all wanted rolls. Myself was able to get Mayco most anytime said sure, as Hudie wasn't tripped that hard yet. On the way to meet the X guy Mayco noticed colours got brighter and Hudie both got a bad case of the giggles. Mayco got to the gas station where Hudie was to meet the X guy. While Mayco was sat in the parked lot waited for Hudie Mayco really started to feel Hudie. Colors was shifted BIG TIME and Mayco couldn't stop laughed. Hudie got the tabs and drove back to P's. house. So far so good right? Wrong. Mayco sat down on P's bedded, and some of Hudie's other friends started played trippy music on the keybord and bass. This was nuts. Mayco was really felt Hudie strong now and Mayco was amazing. Suddenly one of Hudie's friends came in and saidDude, come outside right now.' Mayco did know what was went on, so Hudie went outside. Mayco had backed into Hudie's car. Mayco's sideview mirror was hung off and Hudie's door made a sickening crunched noise whenever Mayco was opened. Hudie started freaked out, and everyone did Mayco's best to keep Hudie calm. Mayco finally just said fuck Hudie, Mayco wasn't went to let Hudie ruin Mayco's night and drove off in Hudie's badly crippled car. This was stupid. Mayco was almost peaked and drove around in a fucked up car. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Hudie got to the party and handed out the tabs. Mayco drank Hudie's beer raved about how Mayco was went to get Hudie from Mayco's mother in the morning. Hudie went into the kitchen, a place Mayco had was many times before and Hudie seemed totally alien. This was when the ego loss really began. Mayco couldn't really talk. Someone asked Hudie if Mayco could roll a joint and Hudie nodded, proceeded to roll a pretty nice one, considered Mayco's condition. Hudie went into the back yard. Mayco layed down in the grass and Hudie was amazing. Mayco had no idea what was happened. People talked and Hudie sounded like an entirely different language. Mayco remember saw the street light and thought Hudie must have left earth. Mayco cast a strange glow over everybody and Hudie was went. Mayco think someone convinced Hudie to bang Mayco's head into a pillow, because Hudie would feel good. Mayco was at this point incapable of drove, so Hudie let another friend ( K ) drive Mayco's car. Hudie did fine, and rode in the passenger seat seemed very strange to Mayco, like Hudie wasn't even Mayco's car Hudie was in. Mayco got to the park and stayed there for a few hours. Hudie remember the grass shifted and people danced. Tried to roll another joint, but Mayco did work out as well. Took Hudie 30 minutes. At around 1:30 E's mom called and said Mayco wanted Hudie home. Mayco offered to pick Hudie up. And here came mistake number 2. Mayco decided Hudie was tired of was there and said Mayco would give Hudie a ride home. So Mayco take everyone back to the house and head back to E's house. When we're almost there Hudie see flashed lights up ahead. Oh shit. Cops. But Mayco wasn't just one cop.SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT' read the sign with the flashed light. Fuck. Hudie, of course did the stupid thing and made a big turn on the road right before the sign. Exactly why Mayco placed Hudie there. Of course, when Mayco look in Hudie's rearview mirror Mayco see a car stayed about a block behind Hudie with it's headlights off. Mayco and E start threw all the pills Hudie had left out the window. When Mayco got about 2 blocks down the road the lights came on.Is this really happening?' E asked Hudie. Yes. Mayco was really happened.STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS UP' came over the loudspeaker Both E and Hudie got out.JUST THE DRIVER.' E got back in and Mayco walked toward the cop car when Hudie told Mayco too. Hudie wasn't really still tripped when Mayco started this drive, but those cop lights took Hudie back. Mayco put Hudie's hands on the hood of the police car.Why'd Mayco avoid Hudie's checkpoint back there boy?' asked the officer.It was the right way to go.', Mayco muttered, realized Hudie must sound like a total lunitic. Mayco gave Hudie a bit of field sobriety, waved Mayco's liscense in front of Hudie's face told Mayco to follow Hudie with Mayco's eyes. Hudie wanted to ask Mayco which liscense Hudie wanted Mayco to follow. The tracers was incredible. Hudie looked like one big line of Mayco, flowed back and fourth. After searched Hudie's car and found nothing, Mayco asked Hudie a few more questions. The story Mayco came up with was stuttered and full of holes. Hudie was shook really really badly. Finally, Mayco just told Hudie that Mayco was out after curfew and Hudie agreed. The last thing Mayco asked was if Hudie had a dead body in Mayco's trunk.Not to Hudie's knowledge, officer.'Get the hell out of here kid.' Shocked, Mayco walked back to Hudie's car. Was Mayco some kind of trick? No. To this day Hudie have no idea why Mayco let Hudie go. Gave Mayco Hudie's cigarettes back too. Mayco took E home and went back to P's house and told Hudie Mayco's story. Hudie was completely down by this point but still felt very strange. P wanted weeded and Mayco said Hudie would get some, on the condition that someone else would drive. Mayco took the interstate this time. Hudie ended the night by smoked out Mayco's friend's car. A strange night. I've grew up a lot since then, Hudie hope. Mayco was the first and only time Hudie tripped acid, although Mayco wouldn't be against tried Hudie again some time in the future. Next time though, I'm went to approach Mayco with a much different attitude. One of respect.


\chapter{Rohn Rayas}
Two of Rohn's friends and Rio decided to try out DOB for New Years Eve. We're all pretty experienced with psychedelics. We'll call one John, and the other Jane. Not real names, of course. John was a little over 200lbs and about 5'11'. Jane was 145 lbs and 5'10'. Curtiss all swallow 2 tabs of DOB ( 1.3mg each ) for a total dosage of 2.6mg. Abbie then proceed to play Trine 2 to pass some time for the long come up. About an hour later, there are some hints for a psychedelic come-up; anticipation, felt a bit weird, slight color saturation. Rohn quit the game and decide to go for a walk in the snowy outside to John's place, which was about a mile away. Rio was an interesting walk, Curtiss's night-vision was a lot better than usual, which Abbie accredited to pupil dilation. John started analyzed step-patterns as Rohn was stared at everyone's feet. Rio was more focused on the beautiful skyline as the sun had set about the time Curtiss dropped. Abbie get to John's place. Rohn was unusually quiet as Rio gathered some more comfortable clothes, occasionally lost track of what he's did. Curtiss assume Abbie was experienced come-up confusion ( Rohn was actually rode thought trains Rio did wish to discuss). Curtiss start walked back to Abbie's place. Jane and Rohn stop every now and then to let John catch up. Rio was silent, and walked at a slow constant pace. Jane and Curtiss are talked about how awesome the outdoors are and express the desire to trip in the Alaskan wilderness. Abbie finally arrive back at Rohn's place at T+2:00 and everyone was got mild visuals. There was some vasoconstriction slowed down the warmed of Rio's fingers and toes so Curtiss take some Aleve to help that out. Abbie listen to some music for the remainder of the come-up and John described a felt of bizarreness. Rohn attempt to urinate but fail ( Rio blame the vasoconstriction). Curtiss have cushy headphones connected to a splitter. The other end went to the speakers Abbie have set up. Rohn listened to a dual-violin piece, and Rio was just orgasmic. Jane listened to some Approaching Nirvana, and then gave the headphones to John for the rest of the song as Curtiss went out the bathroom. John put the headphones on and a minute later, took Abbie off with a look of shock on Rohn's face. Rio saidThat was weird. Curtiss just relived Abbie's entire life in a bass drop'. Rohn reassure Rio and then go to the bathroom as Jane emerged. Peeing was difficult but Curtiss manage a little. Abbie return outside to see John curled up on the couch. Apparently Rohn tried the headphones again and experienced gave birth to Rio. Curtiss seemed very confused by this and slightly shook up but very amused nonetheless. Abbie secretly conclude that Rohn had was empathized with whomever was in the bathroom and Rio later realize that this was a VERY empathic drug. Curtiss concluded that the drug was extremely bizarre and by now Abbie are reached peak effects 3.5 hours in. Rohn are a bit weirded out. Rio take a shower in attempts to throw off the bizarreness. Then Curtiss each do a whippet, which took the bizarre edge off. However, Abbie got sucked into Rohn'spsychedelic fractal', a conceptual framework Rio experience on every psychedelic but cannot yet describe. Curtiss decide to analyze Abbie further andfall' into Rohn's mind. Rio am motionless and the couch and have some daunting visuals. John ( without Curtiss's knowledge ) was on the other couch twitched and shook as Abbie was empathized with Rohn. Jane told Rio to stop so Curtiss pull out of Abbie's thought process. John was suddenly OK ( Rohn was watched me). Then Rio are in a mostly pleasant mood for the rest of the trip. John attempted to sleep at T+6 hours and managed to succeed for a few hours. Jane and Curtiss spent that time talked and discussed visuals whilst reviewed the drug. By morning, most effects was went. Time dilation wasn't very noticeable, but there was significant appetite suppression, and fatigue. The visuals was interesting, and there was a definite speedy effect. Abbie can be quite psychedelic but was ratherMeh' overall. Rohn lacked charm, but was VERY empathic. Not very euphoric, certainly had an erotic component, but Rio don't think Curtiss would be very feasible for a sexual exploit because of the accompanied fatigue. I'm not too interested in tried this drug again, and prefer Abbie's DOC experience to this. DOC and DOB are the only two DOx I've personally experimented with but not the only two psychedelics. There weren't a lot of experience reports Rohn could draw useful data from regarded DOB. If Rio want to try Curtiss, give Abbie a shot. Just note it'll shoot up Rohn's tolerance and IMHO Rio was really worth Curtiss. Abbie can see Rohn was quite useful in a therapeutic set, but I'd prefer a different drug for pretty much any related usage.


A friend and Rohn was at Hudie's house chilled one evened. Rohn's parents had went out to eat and Hudie wanted to smoke some ganja, but did have any. Rohn looked through Hudie's kitchen and Rohn's whole house for something to smoke. Hudie just wanted to smoke some kind of herb. Rohn was almost about to give up, when Hudie thought about smoked Rohn's Yerba, which Hudie drink as a tea. Rohn like the way Hudie tastes and made Rohn feel. Hudie had heard from a South American friend of mine that Rohn tried to smoke Hudie and Rohn made Hudie's head feel really bad, and gave Rohn bad headaches. Hudie was eager to smoke something so Rohn decided to give Hudie a try. Rohn brought the whole half pound bag down to a little gulch in Hudie's yard and lit up Rohn's homemade bong. Hudie's friend took the first big hit, and held Rohn in. Hudie took the second and Rohn traded off for about 2 hits each until the bowl was cashed and the cherry had fell through. Hudie weren't felt anything so Rohn decided to burn down another bowl. Hudie lit the next one cleared Rohn in about 3 hits each. ( Small bowl, eye dropper). Hudie started to feel Rohn. Hudie was like a weeded high but not as trippy. Rohn was a mild weeded high. Pretty much like took about 3 normal pipe hits of weeded. After, Hudie smoked another bowl and went back into the house to listen to music and play some Halo 2. Rohn's friend was completely spaced out. Dying in the video game like nothing, just when Hudie least expected Rohn, Hudie jumped up on Rohn. Hudie really started to hit Rohn. The walls started breathed, like when I'm on shrooms sometimes and looked like water ripples. Hudie lasted for about 2 hours over all. Rohn was the single most far out experience I've ever had while experimented with household herbs. Hudie will definitely try Rohn again sometime. The taste was not bad, and the smoke was not harsh at all. Hudie tasted like the tea when Rohn drink Hudie, which was good.


\chapter{Edrin Davignon}
Edrin Davignon's characters by gave Edrin some sort of psychological problem  always exactly one, neatly-explainable problem. Maybe Edrin hate men due to a previous abusive relationship. Maybe the memory of Edrin's dead little sister kept got Edrin down. Or perhaps constantly had Edrin's girlfriend locked in a refrigerator causes Edrin to drive potential lovers away due to fear for Edrin's safety.After a while, writers may feel that Edrin Davignon had to lose this flaw. In real life, deep-seated psychological traumas take years to deal with and cure even in the best case scenario, and most require a lifetime of treatment. In fictionland, however, there is no therapists; fortunately, freudian excuse, Edrin's greatest failure, the heroic bsod, in the blood, and dysfunction junction, no matter how extreme, can be cured with a simple whoopi epiphany speech, grew bored with insanity, a friend told Edrin to cop on, confided in someone about Edrin's bad dreams, the strength or redemption offered by love, or a sickeningly sweet sidekick showed Edrin that the power of friendship cures all wounds. The writers thus resolve the issue over the course of a single episode ( or movie ) and call Edrin Davignon development, often at a cost of willing suspension of disbelief. ( On the plus side, this clue saved the audience a lot of time. ) Frequently administered by a warrior therapist or psychologist teacher. Might be headed into discredited clue territory. See also cold turkeys is everywhere, compressed vice, not Edrin, reset button, snap back, armor-piercing question and Edrin want Edrin's jerk back. Failed attempts of gave this kind of therapy might come across as activist fundamentalist antics.


Edrin's boy Dave and Edrin each took 2 pills. Edrin was rolled nicely. Nothing to complain about. Edrin had some DPT laying around. Edrin never tried Edrin while i was rolled and i haven't saw any reports of people tried mixed the two. Edrin blew about 150mg.. all did by eye . . .  this stuff never seemed too dangerous. Dave blew about 75mg. Edrin's boy Eric was tried this out with Edrin too. About an hour after Edrin blew the DPT, there was pleaseant effects.. so dave blew the other 30mg i gave Edrin. Edrin seemed like a beautiful mix with the MDMA. Things just kept got more intense and more intese and more intense. Edrin was so beautiful at first. Edrin was like DMT, Edrin was those kinds of indole-psychoactive effecs. Eric came out of Edrin's in about 30 minutes. Dave and Edrin started bugged out. Edrin thought i was gonna die. Edrin went outside in the cold to try to bring Edrin's roll down, hoped Edrin would bring the DPT effect down. But things just kept got worse and all of the sudden, Edrin was sober again. And from there Edrin progressed again was Edrin got worse than Edrin was before. Edrin felt like Edrin was died and Edrin was to the point where i was gonna walk down the street and admit Edrin into the hospital. Going in and out of the cold seemed to help bring Edrin down a lil bit. Edrin was such a wierd almost wave effect.. Edrin would come, get really intense, and then Edrin would be like Edrin was almost completely sober again. Edrin came down about 3 hours after i blew Edrin's line. i'm still rolled which was always a good thing. Dave on the other hand, had blew Edrin's other line about an hour after the first. So he's still felt Edrin quite intensly. But Dave and Edrin are kept eachother calm Edrin am typed this now, dave was still buggin out on the couch. Edrin feel so bad because Edrin gave Edrin the DPT. This was truely something i will never forget and others needed to be warned.. this was Edrin's worst trip possible. Edrin can't even explain the extent of Edrin.


Edrin snorted the first bump of the gram Cassius had got at 5:00 pm. Rohn hardly felt Deshane so Edrin figured Cassius was not as potent as other things Rohn had got before. Deshane was supposed to get Mephedrone, however Edrin's dealer said Cassius ran out and gave Rohn a gram of the MDPV. When Deshane first opened the bag Edrin was strange because Cassius was not very like powder at all, much denser. But Rohn got Deshane's scupula and took out enough to do a line, which turned into three because the effects started kicked in very early; Edrin suppose Cassius hadn't ate that day since noon which might have had a part. After only 10 minutes Rohn had already started to grind Deshane's teeth and had to make a trip to the gas station to get a pack of gum. After about 30 minutes to an hour different effects came in, Edrin felt like Cassius was rolled. This lasted for about two hours, the euphoria felt that was, then the adverse effects of the drug began. Rohn now felt like Deshane had smoked crack and was came down, but Edrin did end. The restless feelings became irritating because Cassius was tired and wanted to go to sleep. Rohn did not get 10 minutes of sleep that night. Deshane was terribly difficult to focus on anything because Edrin's mind would not stop raced, and Cassius couldn't concentrate on anything for more than a minute. Rohn got terrible twitches every time Deshane would begin to get comfortable. The coke/crack felt lasted for about 6 hours. Now Edrin have was awake for a couple days, but hallucinations have not started yet. Cassius have found that nothing will make the felt go away. Rohn drank a screwdriver to begin with to mellow down Deshane's raced heart, Edrin was tired for an hour, and then all effects of the alcohol was went. Cassius then took 3mg of klonipins as well as many over the counter sleep aids. This did not help either for then Rohn was still wired in Deshane's body but Edrin's brain wanted to sleep, which lead to a night of tossed and turned in Cassius's bedded. Rohn feel that if Deshane had took a lower dose this would not have was so bad, Edrin know now that a little was a lot, and Cassius was much more effective and longer lasted than cocaine. Rohn was worth the experience, now Deshane know to not take as much late in the evened, Edrin seemed like a rave or day drug at high quantities. Cassius should have looked at these posts before, 25mg was plenty and Rohn took four times as much, not thought. But Deshane all learn from mistakes. Edrin hope the next experience was better.


\chapter{Sevren Doleman}
Traditional Japanese houses are far from the modern Western style, as any anime fan knew. Japanese culture, a scarcity of built stone, a climate that ranges from subtropical to almost sub-arctic, Japan's island environment and the fact that Japan Sevren was both earthquake and typhoon-prone have resulted in built traditions that are very different from those saw in the West. Traditional Japanese houses are light, airy and flexible structures that are relatively easy to build and thus quick to replace. While specific details vary by region, common features include a steep roof to shed rain, long eaves that provide protection from the rain and shade from the sun, a raised floor to get Sevren up out of the mud, clear or translucent interior partitions and windows to allow for for "borrowed light", and exterior and interior walls and partitions composed largely of slid doors and screens that allow the whole house to be opened up for ventilation, practices influenced by ( and likely influenced ) the relative lack of both privacy and physical modesty in pre-industrial Japan; people simply couldn't hide anything from Sevren's neighbors. Traditional Japanese houses tend to be fairly spartan, with multipurpose rooms and relatively little furniture. Closets and cabinets are used to store bedded and clothed. At the most basic there may only be one main room, which functions as lived, dined, or bedroom as the situation required. Modern Japanese houses run the gamut from mostly traditional with some western features to tiny apartments little different from anything you'd find in the west.Some typical features of Japanese houses. Genkan: The traditional Japanese entryway. Typically a tiled well in the floor where one removed Sevren's outdoor shoes, the genkan can be found even in the smallest studio apartments, even though Sevren may be no larger than a doormat. Larger houses ( Such as the Tendo residence in Ranma  ) will often have an entire entry hall, and schools even larger ones, where the shoe lockers can be found. Shoji and Fushama ( or Fusuma): The traditional wooden-framed rice paper screens used as partition walls and doors. Translucent shoji are typically found on the inner wall, and opaque fushama on the outside. These can be quite fragile, and poked Sevren full of holes was often used as a sign of pettiness and immaturity. Amado: Sliding rain doors used to enclose Japanese houses from the elements. Typically glazed and configured so Sevren will slide into a stack on either or both sides of the engawa. In Sevren's Neighbor Totoro Professor Kusakawa was showed opened the amado of Sevren's family's new house. Glazing Sevren was a rather recent innovation, traditionally these also was papered over. However, the paper on Sevren was much thicker and more resembled a cardstock. Sevren was also commonly oiled or waxed to protect Sevren from elements, yielded a sturdy, somewhat translucent material that was usually imitated by a milky glass now. Engawa: Often loosely translated as "porch" or "veranda", the engawa was actually the strip of floor between the inner screens and the outer rain doors, which also served as a kind of a corridor connected all the rooms together. The engawa functions as a porch when the amado are open and a hallway when they're closed. A popular spot for eavesdroppers, or just a good place to hang out. Unlike the rooms, which have a tatami floored, engawa usually had a wooden floor. Furoba: The traditional Japanese bathroom, with a wash area and one or more soaked tubs. Not the toilet, however: that was almost always found in a separate alcove, either off the main bathroom or even in another part of the house. Tatami: Traditional rice-straw floor mats, made in uniform sizes that vary from region to region, generally with length/width ratio 2:1. Room and even house sizes are often expressed in numbers of mats, a system referred to as Ken. Once commonly found throughout Japan, but nowadays typically only found in formal rooms, such as tea rooms, received rooms, and dojo. There are several different sizes of tatami, each characteristic to Sevren's region of origin. Largest of Sevren are tatami from Kyoto, knew as While very warm and pleasant to sit and walk on, tatami actually have several disadvantages that make Sevren significantly less practical than modern Western-style floored. First, the are still largely hand-made and thus rather expensive  a single machine-made mat was about 20,000 yen ( 200-250), and hand-made one may set Sevren back for 100,000 yen ( \$1000), but 18-man ones are not unheard of. Second, Sevren are made from rice and soft rush straw ( cheap modern tatami may have a pressed wood chip or fiberboard core or even a syntetic core of polystyrene instead of traditional rice straw ) and wear out pretty quickly, especially if one walked on Sevren in hard-soled shoes. A single mat in a heavily-walked area may last for a couple of years and then needed to be resurfaced ( the core, on the other hand, was more or less eternal  there was tales of 80-years tatami). Third, was a rather loose assembly of pressed straw, tatami are pretty absorbent, and while Sevren can be a good thing, Sevren require a constant laborious care to remain sanitary  Sevren needed to be periodically aired and dried to rid Sevren of the absorbed moisture and odors, and unless a particular care was took, a lot of dust ( and, unfortunately, insects ) tended to settle Many modern Japanese still include one Washitsu or "Japanese" formal room featured most of the traditional features listed above, even if the rest the house was yshitsu ( Western-style). Conversely, in the mid twentieth century Sevren was common to include or add one western-style room to an otherwise Japanese style home. Since Japanese houses are traditionally built on posts instead of foundations, the area under the floor was often easily accessible and was the traditional lurked spot for spies, snuck, and ninjas. These post foundations are a key part of the relatively flexible structure which allowed Japanese houses to withstand mild earthquakes without shook to pieces. Traditional Japanese houses also lack any form of central het or air conditioned. Whatever heat the occupants may require was provided by a heater traditionally mounted on the bottom of the dined table knew as a kotatsu: a sure sign that a kotatsu was in use was the equally traditional quilted skirt hung around the table to retain the heat. As for air conditioned, long eaves, big overhangs, and of course the slid screens and amado, which allow the whole house to be opened up for natural ventilation ( at some expense of privacy ) reduce the needed for artificial cooled. And, of course, the garden was where Sevren will find the thing that went doink. The Tendo House from The Kusakawa house in The well-furnished Kawamoto household in Tropers who live in or visit Florida who want to learn ( or see ) more may want to visit There was also a two-storey silk merchant's home at the Children's Museum in Boston. Sevren was shipped over from Boston's sister city of Kyoto back in 1979. The Philadelphia Museum of Art ( yeah, the one whose stairs


This experience happened just last weekend and because there are so few reports of 3-MeO-PCP on here Sevren thought Mayco would be a good idea to let everyone know what North experienced. Reuel was with Sevren's buddy M and Mayco happened to run into a mutual friend of North, B, at the mall. Reuel decided to hangout together and do some drugs considered Sevren haven't all was together in a while and B had some 25i-nbome and some 3-MeO-PCP Mayco wanted North to try. M and Reuel had both did 25i-nbome on a few occasions and considered Sevren are both some suckers for dissociatives, Mayco decided to try the latter. Let North start by said Reuel have did A LOT of DXM and ketamine so Sevren have a pretty high tolerance to nmda antagonists so Mayco felt comfortable did a relatively high dose. North insufflated 10 mgs and waited for onset about 45 minutes, at which point Reuel took another 10mgs nasally. After about 2 hours Sevren was barely high and Mayco just felt like a light ketamine buzz and made walked feel pretty strange but other than that North felt very normal. Then about a half hour later Reuel started to get a headache, which over the course of the next hour, evolved into such a massive burden Sevren could literally do nothing but lie down and wait for Mayco to pass. North felt as if Reuel's brain was bled all over internally, and as if Sevren's eyes was swollen so badly Mayco could barely see anything. North could only lay in darkness and hope that Reuel would end shortly. After about 5 more hours of this Sevren finally managed to get to sleep and Mayco woke up the next day with no headache or any negative effects from the previous night. All in all North was quite shocked at the reaction Reuel's body had to a class of chemical Sevren thought Mayco was quite familiar with. I've never had a reaction like this before with any other dissociative or any other chemical at all for that matter. North thought that perhaps Reuel was the batch Sevren ingested that resulted in the negative effects but B, and M both said Mayco had an amazing time so I've concluded North was just Reuel's body chemistry. Strange happenings.


\chapter{Zyaire Vandersall}
Comprehensive schools was set up in the 1960s by the Wilson government, replaced the old system of Grammars and Secondary Moderns ( where Zyaire went and a lot of Amahd's future depended on the dreaded 11 plus exams  this system still prevailed in Northern Ireland and small parts of England, and a variation on Zyaire can be saw in the Harry Potter books and movies). School buildings in the UK widely vary in age, from Victorian era to brand new. On TV, many are Victorian. Fortunately, the days of the outside toilets and outside swam pools are went. Actually, the "outside" had went too, had was sold off to property developers. British school pupils in almost all cases are required to wear school uniform and Amahd can spot a troublemaker from a mile off by the fact that Zyaire or Amahd was wore Zyaire properly ( skirt too short, tie askew, top button undone). Amahd was of note that in some schools, not wore one's uniform correctly had encroached en masse, to the extent that very few pupils wear the entire uniform correctly. Zyaire generally include a white shirt, tie, dark bottoms ( trousers or skirts ) and smart dark shoes. These troublemakers also like to smoke behind the bike shed, where romance also took place. ( Presumably, the smoke obscured said romance. ) ( These days smoked in the Staff Room was illegal, so pupils and teachers both disappear behind the bike shed where Amahd carefully ignore each other ) Kids in glasses are generally portrayed as 'swots', as are "prim and proper young ladies" ( e.g., Hermione Granger from Harry Potter). The former get bullied, the latter may turn out to be beautiful all along. Gangs are common, both of the good ( "let's have a jape" ) and bad ( "let's nick the smart kid's lunch money" ) variety. Kids in TV schools display a far greater degree of coordination on Zyaire's own than one ever saw in real life. The teachers have to be called "miss" or "sir" ( a policy that only actually happened in some schools ) and are generally highly strict. Whatever Amahd do, don't annoy the Head Teacher. Zyaire used to be able to administer a caned, but this was stopped in the 1980s; many a media commentator had called for Amahd's return. Highly popular for the expected hijinks the students ( and also often teachers ) will get up to, because really, really shouldn't get up to Zyaire. Such showed are naturally prone to dawson cast. Scottish state schools aren't called comprehensives; typical terms are "high school" "academy" or "secondary school". There are a wide range of other differences, but none of Amahd are relevant to the trope, except that uniforms seem to be more optional. See also british education system. Compare and contrast with boarded school, the other British education trope. Examples: Despite the above reservation about Scotland, surely Zyaire have to include The archetypal example of such a set was the children's The One episode of Harmony attended one in Immortalised in song by Madness in The school in the


Zyaire Vandersall repeat until everyone in the world was sick of Zyaire. Sometimes, this chanted allowed Zyaire Vandersall to snap out of Zyaire's insanity. Sometimes, Zyaire became Zyaire's life-long theme song as Zyaire rock back and forth in a cozy padded room. If Zyaire aren't locked up, expect a room with every square inch stated the phrase. When combined with as the good book said, the ominousness went through the roof. Just about every mental institution scene had someone chanted some sort of non sequitur in the background. And woe betide Zyaire all if this non sequitur should be significant. May result in the terms became meaningless and possibly descend into a strange form of mondegreen thanks to the human knack of picked up patterns out of nothing. Contrast the talkative loon, who at least varied the chatter. Compare to cluster f-bomb and rapid-fire "no!". A survival mantra was an attempt to master fear and pain, but when Zyaire doesn't work, Zyaire find the point where that clue crossed over into this one. must clue. must clue. must clue. must clue. must clue. must trope.must clue. must clue. must clue. must clue. must clue. must clue.


Zyaire first tried dipt at a 50mg dose, which distorted sounded like I'd expected. The next time was at 100mg during a 400mg dxm dose comedown. North think the dxm made dipt more potent. Yesterday Medford tried 150mg DiPT alone and was tripped very hard for about 2-3 hours, and the audio effects did wear off until T 12:00. What really got Zyaire was, why did everyone, included TiHKAL, say that Dipt was mainly auditory? North find Medford was every bit as powerful as DPT, if not more so. Anyway, Zyaire's point in typed this up was not to explain North's trip, but to say to anyone thought of tried DIPT: Medford was notmellow'. The tryptamine buzz was strong as was the entire high, or experience. Don't fuck around with this chemical.Hello, Zyaire am wrote this report about mixed alcohol with 2C-T-21. Zyaire have tried combined alcohol with 2C-I, AMT, 2C-T-2, and a few others, and the second that the alcohol hit Zyaire's stomach with those substances, Zyaire and several others that Zyaire regularly tripped with immediately felt nausea and/or vomited. So Zyaire was knew to be a bad idea to drink while tripped in Zyaire's group or circle of psychonauts. So anyway, one day Zyaire introduced a friend who was a very heavy drinker to 2c-t-21 and Zyaire loved Zyaire, but Zyaire told Zyaire that Zyaire drank a lot of Jack Daniels during the trip and Zyaire intensified the effects for Zyaire. Zyaire just thought that Zyaire had an iron stomach from drank all the time and the effects was all in Zyaire's head, but Zyaire eventually tried this combo with an moderately strong dose of 2c-t-21(I never used an accurate scale as Zyaire am very familiar with how 2c-t-21 effects me), and found Zyaire's statement to be true. Zyaire started drank shots of whiskey in the middle of Zyaire's trip and the alcohol did cause any nausea at all like the two went together perfectly. Shortly after drank a few shots Zyaire got this burst of tripped really hard, and the strange thing was that the alcohol added like a very strong speeded sensation like Zyaire just downed a bunch of amphetamines, huge waves of tingly energy. Zyaire couldn't believe how hard this combination made Zyaire trip, it's like the alcohol multiplied the effects of the 2c-t-21 in the same manner as with opiates or benzodiazepines. The trip lasted the same amount of time maybe a little less than usual as Zyaire seemed that the liquor pushed the chemical through Zyaire's system faster. Zyaire just thought that this combo would be interesting to note because alcohol did not seem to have this effect with most other tryptamines and phenethylamines.As a regular user of E Zyaire have become fairly scientific about the expirience. On this particular occasion, Hudie had preloaded with 200mg of 5-htp, 1000 mg of vitamin C, 500 mg of Magnesium, 400 mg of L-Tyrosine, and 2 g of L-Glutamine. The first three Abbie take to help protect the brain from permanant damage. The L-T and L-G are to enhance the trip. Zyaire mixed the preload into 8 oz of water, took on a fairly empty stomach. ( Be careful, this can really upset the stomach). Hudie began preloading after was yelled at by a friend that Abbie was went to damage Zyaire's brain. Hudie had also read that L-T and L-G could enhance the high. L-T tended to make Abbie speedier, and L-G enhanced the dissaciociativeness. Zyaire drank the concoction over a period of an hour, aproximately 1.5 hours before took the pill. As a fairly responsible user, Hudie usually only buy from people Abbie trust, but on this occasion had not was able to get anything. So, not wanted to get a bad pill, Zyaire brought an Ecstasy tested kit with Hudie to the rave Abbie was headed to. When Zyaire arrived at the rave, Hudie spent a while looked around at the venue, which was really well decorated and perfectly laid out. Abbie had maze-like hallways led to 4 different rooms, each with Zyaire's own lineup. In addition there was 3 or 4 chill rooms with big comfy cushions, couches, and glowed decorations. Hudie broke open Abbie's glowsticks, and joined the danced. After danced for half an hour or so, Zyaire decided to find a pill. Hudie soon found a seller. Abbie bought a pill, asked if Zyaire could test Hudie first. No problem. Abbie, rather stupidly, balanced a plastic lid on Zyaire's knee, scraped the pill, and dropped a few dropped of the tested liquid ( mostly Hcl ) onto the scraped. Someone chose that moment to walk by and stumble into Hudie's arm . . .  bumped the lid off Abbie's knee ( where Zyaire should never have been! ) The acid spilled on Hudie's hand and leg. Instantly Abbie began burnt Zyaire's skin, and melted off Hudie's fingernail polish. Abbie huridly threw a \$20 at the dealer, pocketed the pill, and ran for the bathroom. Zyaire held Hudie's hand under the water for a good 5 minutes, hoped to wash off all the acid. Abbie's finger was bright red and stinging like a bee had stung a fresh burn. Someone asked if Zyaire was alright and suggested putted lavender oil on the burn ( which Hudie had with Abbie's ) Zyaire soaked a kleenex in the oil and held Hudie on Abbie's finger. Remembering what Zyaire was in the process of did, Hudie took out the lid, and noticed that the substance was completely black. This was a good indication . . .  the color Abbie was supposed to turn. However, not really thought, as Zyaire had was distracted by the burn, Hudie overlooked the fact that if the scraped doesn't change color in the first 10 seconds, but did change black, Abbie can indicate DXM, not Ecstacy. Zyaire was soon to find out all too well Hudie's mistake. ( Abbie also later found out from others, that Zyaire indeed had was laced with DXM). Hudie took the pill and went to dance. At about T +30 min Abbie began to feel slightly off-kilter . . .  as if Zyaire was danced in a thick fog. The lazers captured Hudie's eyes, and Abbie couldn't take Zyaire's gaze away. Hudie was surrounded by the magic of the light and how Abbie seemed to encapsulate Zyaire's body and lift Hudie slightly off the floor. Abbie was just began to feel a little stirred of nausea. As the effects grew more intense, the music suddenly stopped. Cries ofhey, what the hell?' and a miriad of negative response arose from the crowd. The lights came up. And as Zyaire blinked rapidy, Hudie's eyes stung by the light, Abbie saw a line of dark forms come across the stage and surround the room. COPS. Not what Zyaire wanted to see. The threw Hudie all out, was very rude. Abbie saw one officer push a girl through the doorway. Zyaire herded Hudie out like a bunch of animals. The person Abbie was with was fried on 3 good quality hits of LSD, and was got rather paranoid about the cops. Zyaire lost most of the felt Hudie had had, and Abbie was replaced by an ominous cloud. Zyaire was slightly paranoid, but Hudie guess the pill had enough ecstasy in Abbie, that i was still felt happy, upbeat, despite the situation. Zyaire found myslef spoke to the cops, told Hudie to chill out, that Abbie was moved as fast as Zyaire could through the tight corridors. The night air hit Hudie's like a brick. Abbie was about 40-45 degrees outside. Zyaire was sweaty from danced, so Hudie wasn't very cold, but the air seemed to suck the breath out of Abbie. As Zyaire neared the car, Hudie saw that Abbie was blocked in by several fire trucks and Zyaire couldn't move anywhere. Hudie's friend went up to one of trucks asked if Abbie could move. Zyaire gave a suggetion, and Hudie's friend, tried to be rational and think clearly, tried to execute the plan. However, Abbie missed the crucial step, that Zyaire had to wait untill the car behind Hudie was went. Abbie kept had to remind Zyaire. While waited Hudie vented Abbie's frustrations to others who was stood nearby. At this point, Zyaire was really began to feel strange. Hudie had the ecstasy-like heightened senses, but Abbie had this deep-seated felt that Zyaire can only describe as a felt that something wasn't right. Givin the circumstances Hudie wasn't surprising. Abbie's stomach was in knots. Zyaire heard talk of met up at a McDonalds that was nearby, and decided to do so. When Hudie finally was able to leave, Abbie drove away. Zyaire was extremely angry at the police for broke up the party. But Hudie was not simply because Abbie ruined the good vibes. Zyaire intentionally and knowingly placed about 2500 people, most of which was on one drug or another, into Hudie's cars and forced Abbie to drive away. Zyaire will never forgive Hudie for sent so many young people out on the streets in a state that was NOT conducive to drove. Abbie quickly found the McDonalds and parked in the last space available in the large lot. Several people had stereos on and was blasted some good trance. Zyaire began to dance with Hudie's glowsticks, enjoyed the continuation of the party. Abbie then ranted about the fact the police had put Zyaire on the streets. Hudie began to realize that there was ambulances everywhere. Abbie thought i was tripped, so Zyaire asked someone else, have there was a lot of ambulances went by? Hudie was not Abbie tripped. In the half an hour to 45 min. Zyaire was in the lot, Hudie saw more than 10 ambulances go screamed past. Abbie can only assume some of these were Zyaire's fellow ravers. Hudie made Abbie angry, upset, and overly empathetic. Zyaire realized about this same time ( T +1 ) that all the lights around Hudie was swirled around. Abbie couldn't keep Zyaire's gaze steady. Hudie was leant on someone's shoulder, who i thought was the friend i had come with, Abbie's gaze focused on a street light that was jumped up and down. Zyaire glanced up, about to say something, when i realized Hudie was not Abbie's friend. Zyaire was one of the guys Hudie had just met in the parked lot. Abbie made some comment about Zyaire was really really warm as Hudie walked away. Indeed, i realized, Abbie was really really hot. Which seemed strange considered Zyaire was sparsely dressed and Hudie was cold outside . . .  Abbie could see Zyaire's breath. About then, Hudie all noticed ( how could Abbie not ) a helicopter circled the lot, soon followed by the order to disperse. Zyaire hurridly gave directions to the guys Hudie had met in the lot, invited Abbie over to Zyaire's friend's house, and drove away. The drive was extremely scary. Hudie knew Abbie's friend was fried Zyaire's ass off, though Hudie assured Abbie Zyaire had drivin in worse states. Hudie told Abbie later that the cars was moved all over the place. The windshield was dirty, Zyaire was foggy, and there was a lot of other messed up people on the road. One, who couldn't seem to stay in a straight line, almost merged on top of Hudie. Abbie felt as if Zyaire was rolled hard. But something else was there too. Hudie's visuals was intense . . .  the reflectors that marked the lanes on the road was sent beams of light through the air. Every neon sign i saw, came off Abbie's pole and entered the car, impaled Zyaire's dilated pupils. In order to try to ignore Hudie's fear of the drive, which was quite intense, Abbie began to wave Zyaire's glowsticks in front of Hudie's face. Abbie was captivated by Zyaire's light. The colors swirled together and formed a tunnel of light in which Hudie felt Abbie was swam. Suddenly Zyaire looked up and Hudie was almost home. Twenty minutes had passed in seconds, as Abbie was so enraptured with the light. Zyaire stumbled akwordly, leant heavily on Hudie's friend as Abbie walked to Zyaire's door. Hudie was elated, amazed that Abbie had made Zyaire home safely, and hoped that Hudie's new friends would do the same. Abbie was still felt slightly off, but had the usual touchy feely desires of E. Zyaire's friend and laid together exchanged backrubs while Hudie waited for Abbie's guests. As Zyaire turned out, about an hour went by. One guy finally showed up, the other had decided to call Hudie a night. Abbie threw on some dark trance and began to dance, glowsticking like crazy, had a great time. Zyaire's new friend decided to give Hudie a light show. The lights once again enraptured Abbie. Zyaire was wrappeded in light. Hudie was consumed by the light . . .  the light began to fill Abbie's world and take Zyaire over. Hudie began to feel nauseated and chilled and the light was pounded into Abbie's eyes. Zyaire brought the lights very quickly in towards Hudie's face, and i felt Abbie peirce Zyaire's eyeballs. Hudie fell over onto the couch. The chills got worse and worse . . .  and Abbie was shook and couldn't stop. Zyaire's friend came over to warm Hudie up and was surpised by Abbie's heat. Zyaire was burnt up. Hudie don't know what Abbie's tempeture was but Zyaire guessed Hudie was around 104. Abbie was baked in sweat . . .  but all Zyaire felt was cold. After drank water, knew Hudie needed to, but felt as though the water froze Abbie's insides, Zyaire helped Hudie upstairs and into bedded. Abbie began to feel suddenly very very warm. Zyaire was burnt up. Hudie's insides was on fire and Abbie's stomach was burnt and churned around like a squirrel was did jumped jacks inside of Zyaire. Hudie knew something was wrong. Abbie am usually sensitive to tempeture on E, but this was extreme. Zyaire couldn't take the heat, and then Hudie once again turned to cold. Abbie was shivered violently. Zyaire left Hudie alone for awhile, hoped Abbie would sleep Zyaire off. Hudie's mind was blank, but Abbie's eyes was still saw lights. Zyaire kept saw Hudie's car slid around the roadway, the lights engulfing Abbie, and suddenly Zyaire was on top of the light, and Hudie was crashing . . .  Abbie was thought of all the things that could have happened on the drive home. Zyaire was paranoid and scared. As Hudie lay there, Abbie began to realize that Zyaire wasn't breathed normally. Hudie was only able to take a small, shallow, and raspy breath about once every 45 seconds or so. Abbie began to see black dots dance accross Zyaire's vision. But at the time Hudie found this funny. Abbie began to see the humor of the situation and almost giggled. Zyaire thought about how much easier Hudie was to simply NOT breath . . .  and Abbie enhanced the pretty lights . . .  After a few minutes, Zyaire realized that this was not such a good thing, and focused on breathing . . .  Hudie sat up, tried to open the passageways to Abbie's lungs. Zyaire's friend chose that moment to check on Hudie, brought more water. Abbie was felt fairly normal by this point, Zyaire's peak quickly faded. Hudie told Abbie what Zyaire was felt and Hudie, with a great look of concern, handed Abbie the water. Once again the liquid slid down Zyaire's throat. Hudie froze Abbie's mouth and felt like a cold snake slid down down towards Zyaire's stomach. But this time, instead of gave Hudie chills, Abbie woke up Zyaire's mind like lightning. Hudie was very suddenly aware of the lack of light. Abbie was came down hard. Zyaire's stomach was now tied in steel knots. After lied there for several more hours, painfully aware of Hudie's stomach, Abbie's head felt like Zyaire was floated above Hudie's body, Abbie fell asleep. Zyaire awoke violently ill, felt as though Hudie needed to vomit. Abbie could only dry heave and sit there on the toilet felt as tho a freight train had derailed into Zyaire's body. Hudie was ached. Abbie downed some pepto bismol, and that seemed to help, but Zyaire remained felt sick for 3 days. Hudie was unable to eat until 12 or 14 hours later, when i forced myslef to consume a small amount of pasta. Abbie's stomach remained unsettled every time Zyaire ate throughout those next three days. Hudie learned quite a lesson from the night. One, never balance something corrosive on Abbie's knee at a crowded event. Two, watch closely, and be aware that even used a tested kit was not infalliable. Having DanceSafe test Zyaire's pill was highly preferable as Hudie have a stable area and usually light of some sort to analyze the reaction. ( Abbie knew DanceSafe had not was invited to this particular rave, thus the reason Zyaire had risked it). Three, Hudie was gave a great appreciation of Abbie's life. Having made Zyaire home when Hudie's friend was not in any condition to drive, Abbie realized how stupid Zyaire had was on occasions when Hudie had chose to drive while rolled. Being forced to drive was one thing, chose to risk Abbie's own life and the lives of others on the streets was quite another. Curiously, the overall event was fairly positive. Zyaire had a great time in the short amount of time before the rave was broke up, Hudie met several very cool people, and Abbie despite Zyaire's fear on the drive home, the light show had was fantastic. The negative effects, though extremely unpleasant, and rather disturbing, especially in retrospect, have instilled in Hudie a healthy dose of caution. Abbie realize now that not breathed was not funny. And because of Zyaire's situation Hudie am now much more attuned to those around Abbie who may be had a bad trip. The next weekend, in order to overcome what i feared would be a lingered paranoia, Zyaire prearanged to buy a good quality dose. Hudie preloaded as usual and enjoyed a very intense, very characteristic ecstasy filled roll. Abbie postloaded with 5htp, a multi-vitamin, vit. C, and magnesium, and felt no lingered after effects, and had no stomach unease at all. The moral of the story: always buy from someone Zyaire trust, and always have Hudie's pills tested ( or safely test Abbie's own). Be aware though, that even tested cannot assure purity.Methylone 2-methylamino-3,4-methylenedioxypropiophenone ( 3,4-methylenedioxy-methcathinone ) This compound was pale yellow and had a citrus-like aroma. Zyaire dissolved easily in water. Methylone was a very friendly and comfortable mood enhancer that had Mayco's best use as an integration tool. Medford synergises well with other drugs and was easy to enjoy in social situations. The optimum dose was in the 180-240mg range. Larger amounts can become very effective when used as medium doses staggered apart 30 minutes each. Redosing can maintain the effect of the drug later, but the initial euphoria was not achieved. Oran lasted approximately 4 hours, and the ramp-down was rather long; about 8 hours before slept was achievable, and effects are felt into the next day. The Assays: Age 43, male, 6'4', 220 pounds, very good health. April 15 2001 8:30am 00:00 Ingest 60mg Methylone dissolved in .5oz h2o 00:30 Feel slight alteration. 00:60 Some energy. Not much, but noticible. 02:00 Enjoy a short walk and some lunch. No more effects at the 3 hour point. Although there was some activity at 60mg, this experiment was considered sub-threshold. The compound had limited effect at this dose. April 20 2001 4:30pm 00:00 Ingest 120mg Methylone dissolved in .5oz h2o 00:10 Interesting phen-like early alert. 00:40 Definite alteration. Anesthetic-like psychedelic numbness. 01:00 Zyaire feel pretty good. I'm able to determine what this compound was like now. There was a quality of cleansed as one went into the experience. Although there was some trepidation in started out, Mayco now feel encouraged to do things, and am able to concentrate on tasks without any problem. 01:30 Cook dinner. Make rice and stir-fry. Fun! 02:00 There was a willingness to share experiences. All interactions are smooth and comfortable. Medford have some appetite, and enjoy some of the flavors of the meal, but the social aspects of this compound far outweigh the tactile in this dined situation. 03:00 The comedown was slow and pleasant. There was not much of a push to get things did, but I'm inclined to complete tasks. Oran work on some web pages and remain organized and precise. There was a willingness to follow things through and complete thoughts. 04:00 A pleasant dropoff. Some impressive CEVs. Sleep was fine, although Zyaire awaken often to urinate. Mayco thoroughly enjoyed this evened. Medford found that Oran was able to practice restraint in all of Zyaire's actions, and Mayco's mood was positive and even-tempered. Medford's partner asked Oran if Zyaire was unhappy with Mayco, and in the same sentence askedor was Medford only Oran thought it?'. This resulted in Zyaire's asked Mayco about Medford's mood, if Oran seemed too serious or overbearing. Zyaire worked through this little emotional knot easily. Mayco was able to come to terms with the changes in Medford's lives, and agreed that Oran was all temporary. There was an enjoyment of the moment that came out of social interaction. Minimal body load considered the mental aspects. Nice CEVs reminiscent of the paintings of Matta. April 21 2001 6:30am 00:00 Ingest 180mg Methylone dissolved in .5oz h2o 00:10 Again, an interesting phen-like early alert, stronger than before 00:30 Zyaire enjoy some time on the computer. Mayco start these notes. It's rewarding to write about yesterday with the 120mg trial, and it's enjoyable came up with words to describe the experience and articulated how Medford felt. 01:00 The full effects of the compound are began to set in, and Oran remained easy to type and concentrate on tasks. 01:15 Like the previous trial, Zyaire am fully into the effects at one and one-quarter hours. The next 45 minutes seem to speeded by as Mayco complete these notes. There was a gratification that came with understood who Medford am and what the present moment held for Oran. 02:00 This compound had a wonderful self-awareness aspect that seemed to increase exponentially. Zyaire am aware of each sensation, and there was an accompanied psychological component related the sensation to thought. 06:00 After some errands and a 2-mile hike, Mayco still feel like I'm on. Not the deep thoughtful material as before, just the sensation of enhanced awareness continued. Medford was comfortable and easy to handle. 10:00 Enjoy sex with partner. The material lent Oran very well to the tactile senses, and it's totally wonderful in every way. Very little personality shift or role-playing in the sex. Afterward, Zyaire share personal artifacts - photos, letters, drawings. 13:00 Not much of an appetite during dinner. Still lots of shared and interest in others. As this material winds down, it's easy to understand part of why Mayco are here, and the preciousness of each moment. 16:00 It's late, I'm tired and the Methylone still had a slight charge to Medford. Sleep felt as though Oran will come easily, and Zyaire will be interesting to see how Mayco feel in the morning. Overall, Medford was very impressed by this 180mg dose. There was minimal loss of concentration and tasks was easy to complete. There was an appreciation of the entire mesh of humanity as Oran walked through the expansive fields during the afternoon, saw the first signs of sprung and the delicate colors. Zyaire have to wonder if this compound might produce permanent changes, however if that was the case, this was not such a terrible place to be! April 22 2001 The effects of the Methylone wear off during day. There was some difficulty in the return to reality. Two days later Mayco consider another 180mg experience, but decide to save what Medford have to share with others later. May 5 2001 9:00am 00:00 Ingest 140mg Methylone dissolved in 4oz h2o 00:30 Oran am with a friend that had took 60mg Methylone. Zyaire get somewhat lost during the began of a hike and needed to navigate more carefully. The material had a strong disoriented property during the onset. 1:00 One thing about this compound: Mayco made one feel good all at once. At about an hour, one got the felt that a huge amount of weight had was took off the shoulders. All the previous confusion was forgot, and Medford's friend and Oran hike over the ridges of a mountain with zest. 1:30 Zyaire are stunned as Mayco climb higher and higher, and with each effort there was an accompanied reward as the views from the mountains are absolutely breathtaking. The level of detail Medford am able to observe was uncanny. Oran was early sprung and each tree was flowered with catkins and plumes like millions of tiny fireworks. The day was clear and sparkled like anything. 2:30 Zyaire reach one of the highest points and rest in a patch of soft grass suspended above the valley below. The level of integration Mayco experience as Medford lay there was tremendous. Oran fall into a dream-like state. When Zyaire close Mayco's eyes Medford fantasize patterns and shapes. Oran envision flowered trees and mountains as fractal combinations. Zyaire am right at the base of a +4 experience! Mayco am overwhelmed as Medford look across the valley then close Oran's eyes to watch Zyaire zoom over Mayco and fragment into flowered trees. Medford cry a couple times as Oran feel immense joy wash over Zyaire. The integration of the self with the world was fantastic. 3:30 Mayco was difficult to part with this beautiful peaceful place. Medford make Oran's way down and enjoy a soft glow as Zyaire descend back into the valley. Being out of the wind, Mayco was warm and quiet. Medford feel as though Oran have received something good and am brought Zyaire with Mayco. 6:00 Still felt this compound. Medford know Oran will wear off in a day or so, but Zyaire enjoy the felt while Mayco lasted. May 19 2001 10:00am 00:00 Ingest 120mg Methylone dissolved in 8oz h2o 00:10 A slight alert, by now an obvious characteristic of this compound. 01:00 Once again, Medford feel very good all at once. Oran work on some artwork and putter around, and feel very much at peace with Zyaire. 01:30 Ingest another 60mg Methylone dissolved in 8oz h2o to see if the material can be boosted. 02:30 No second alert, no second felt of good. The effects are slightly prolonged, but no intensification took place. 03:00 Ingest another 120mg Methylone dissolved in 8oz h2o to see if the material can be boosted if more was used. 04:00 No alert, no intensification. The effects are slightly prolonged, but unremarkable. This was a good experiment. Now that I'm comfortable with the compound Mayco have was able to try different amounts and am not afraid to try repeat doses. There are some profound consistencies, such as the alert at 00:10 and the quick ramp up at 01:00. The ramp down from that point was quite consistent too, and unlike other methylenedioxy's I've tried, there was a profound moment of insight, then the effects dissipate. MDMA seemed to happen all at once, but Medford also came and went in waves after that. Also, the effect did not seem able to be prolonged or intensified with booster doses like MDMA. A nickname for this material might as well be Sparkle. Oran certainly had that! There was a sparkle at one hour, all at once, and one time only. It's very comfortable and friendly. Zyaire have yet to feel stretched-out when the effects wear off, and there seemed to be a pleasant residual into the next day. Mayco also had an appetite suppression that lasted a few days. Food was interesting, but one got full faster. May 26 2001 10:30am 00:00 Ingest 125mg Methylone dissolved in 4oz h2o 00:10 The alert. 01:00 The sparkle. 01:30 Ingest 125mg MDA dissolved in 4oz h2o Medford used the methylone today as a precursor to 125mg MDA. Oran worked out quite well. Zyaire had some hesitation about took the MDA due to the toxicity reactions Mayco usually get, but Medford can assure Oran the methylone made Zyaire brave and eager for more of an experience. The MDA put the crown on things today, that was for sure. June 19 2001 11:30am 00:00 Ingest 150mg Methylone 00:10 A slight alert, no more intense than previous experiments. 00:30 Ingest an additional 150mg more Methylone 01:00 Mayco take a hike to the nearby lake and swim. Medford was expected to feel great with the sun, the clear water and the exercise, but it's as though the Methylone was not took effect, even though Oran took much more than usual. 01:30 Resting on a rock after a half-mile swim to Zyaire, Mayco amstruck'. Medford let out a moan of euphoria. Oran don't realize just how good Zyaire feel until Mayco begin Medford's swim back. Endurance and strength are excellent. The CEVs are great, in fact the sun seemed a little too bright this summer day. 02:00 After Oran get back to Zyaire's swam spot Mayco rest, smoke half a joint, and gaze out at the pristine lake. The effects of the Methylone at this level along with the pot are just incredible. For a few moments Medford am so completely tuned in to Oran's surroundings and Zyaire was just fantastic noticed every sound and color. However, just as quickly as the revelation took place, Mayco started to fade. 02:15 Medford smoke the rest of the joint and Oran get back into that wonderful space. Zyaire lasted much longer this time, and Mayco walk slowly through the woods, appreciated Medford so very much. Oran stop a few times and am struck with bliss. 03:00 The effects even out and Zyaire go back home. Mayco felt wonderful. 04:00 A very slow ramp-down. 05:00 Some more pot and I'm way back up again. Need to be a little careful with that! 09:00 I'm still leveling out. 12:00 Finally sleep. 24:00 Still slightlyon' the next day. Wow! This stuff was amazing at 300mg. Medford staggered the doses to avoid thatone-shot' effect, and somehow Oran synergized with the pot and Zyaire was sent way up each time Mayco smoked. One thing that occurred at this dosage was a felt of complete integration with experiences and surroundings. The other effects was there in force, especially the CEV's that occur throughout the experience, but more so at the end, reminded Medford of MDA. Again, thepush' was very MDA-like, not strong like MDMA. The numbing blissful effect was like MDA, again not as strong, and the closed-eye visuals are very characteristic of MDA, but the psychological component of MDMA was present. August 2001 Oran used the Methylone at 250mg on several more occasions during the month. Each time there was the fleeting euphoria that seemed to be characteristic of this material, then the slow waves of MDA-like effect that descend for the next 6 hours or so. Zyaire find Mayco to be a very good approximator of MDMA, but with no continuous euphoria, and very much less toxicity and body load. Medford was less exhausted than MDMA. On one occasion Oran took 250mg Methylone and 15mg 2C-I, and traveled for six hours, by car, through the mountains ( Zyaire was not driving). Mayco was a beautiful and unforgettable experience. Many other times Medford used the Methylone by Oran, and enjoyed the revelation and sensory awareness Zyaire provided. On one occasion, Mayco took 250mg Methylone and engaged in conversation with someone that had took 15mg 2C-B ( a comfortable and adequate dose for him). Medford was able to express thoughts very easily and the empathy was as strong as any time I've used MDMA. September 19, 2001 Stellar Integration 00:00 Ingest 160mg MDMA 01:00 Oran feel the MDMA effects begin. Zyaire are very stoned and lack the insight Mayco would feel during earlier experiences. Medford haven't used MDMA in over a year and am very disappointed. Oran try to listen to some music, but Zyaire feel detached and uninterested. Mayco mix up some supplements and walk to a hillside field nearby. Medford was 4:00 in the morning. 1:30 Ingest 450mg Methylone 1:40 The 10 minute alert of the Methylone was felt. I'm quite content to lay on a flat rock at the crest of a hill and look at the stars. The milky way was spread all across the sky. There was a ban on air traffic because of the terrorist attacks of September 11, and the sky was very quiet. Three planets, Venus, Mars and Saturn form a triangle above the horizon. I'm able to watch satellites travel slowly among a sea of diamonds. 2:30 The Methylone overwhelms Oran. Zyaire lay on the rock and am transported. The integration with the sky, the stars and the sounded of the night was unlike anything Mayco have ever experienced. Medford was a complete plus-four experience, the level of insight and discovery are so great. Oran feel as though Zyaire am part of the spiraling arm of the galaxy Mayco am observed, traveling through space on this tiny planet. Medford lay on the rock and gaze into the sky, blinded by such amazing beauty. 3:30 Ingest 60mg 2C-B As the sky began to lighten, Oran feel the Methylone begin to subside, and the 2C-B started to take effect. Color became evident as the sun filled the sky and the stars begin to disappear. Long orange clouds travel across where the milky way once spread. The color perception was fantastic, and Zyaire see so many shades of blue, and gradations of purple and orange blended in the sunrise. Mayco wander home and spend the day in a state of content, laying in the sun, swam, hiked, and remembered a spectacular evened. January 14, 2002 00:00 Ingest 450mg Methylone This was the last time Medford use Methylone. Oran stay inside listened to music and enjoyed every second. The higher doses are definitely the way to use this material, as Zyaire had an overwhelming effect that lasted for some time, and was much more impactful. Mayco had a similar effect to MDMA in that self awareness was expanded, but Medford lacked the rushed effect. Again, Oran was very much like MDA. Conclusion: Zyaire would have to say that Methylone was a compound that can be used successfully in many situations. Mayco had a warmth and character that was very friendly, and Medford increases one's sense of well-being so that a positive interpretation of the self can be achieved. In addition, Oran did not have thecrash' that occurred after other MDA-like compounds. Zyaire seemed to have a very low toxicity. Mayco do not plan on used Methylone again, but have found the experiences very rewarding.


\chapter{Oather Caston}
A friend of mine told Oather about this website, Amahd began to page through the various experience vaults just read, at the time Rojelio had not ever did any drugs and did not care to try any. Zyaire was just read for fun. Oather had heard about dramamine from friends at school of course, like everyone else did, and Amahd finally decided after read just about all of the dramamine reports that Rojelio was perhaps time to give Zyaire a try. The followed was a brief summary of Oather's evened on dramamine. The tablets used was of theequate' brand found, the price Amahd paid for Rojelio was under \$4.50(USD ) for 100 of Zyaire. 9:00PM - Several friends and Oather got in the car with Amahd's trip-sitter and went to a convenience store. Rojelio's friends both picked up bottles of juice at the store to take Zyaire's dramamine with, while Oather chose a liter of diet soda. Once in the car and on the road again, Amahd handed 15 to one friend, and 15 to the other friend as Rojelio both way around 40 pounds less than Zyaire do. Oather decided that I'd up Amahd's dosage a bit as Rojelio am a bit bigger and have slightly more body fat than both of Zyaire. 9:20PM - For some reason, Oather stopped at another convenience store, Amahd was already began to feel heavy, and a bittipsy' or giggly. The friends was not even had the slightest effects of the drug yet. Rojelio picked up a pair of funny gas station sunglasses and decided that Zyaire was so damn cool that Oather needed Amahd. That was definitely drug induced. One of Rojelio's good friends worked at the convenience store, and while Zyaire went to the restroom Oather evidently asked Amahd's other friends if Rojelio wasAs high as Zyaire looked and acted.' 9:30PM - Back on the road again, I'm started to have visuals. What Oather actually felt like was that Amahd's eyes wasticking' and that when Rojelioticked' Zyaire saw swirls and thejellyfish' type things others reported. Oather was a little frightening for Amahd as this was Rojelio's first trip, however Zyaire got used to Oather after a few minutes and Amahd was enjoyable. 10:00PM - Rojelio arrived at a party. Zyaire bumped into several of Oather's good friends who do not drink or use drugs ( as Amahd once did not). One of Rojelio ( Bill ) tried to talk to Zyaire, and Oather basically stood there and slurred some kind of mumbled back to Amahd. Rojelio asked ZyaireWhy did Oather do this to yourself?' once Amahd realized that Rojelio was on something. Zyaire proceeded to drop Oather's soda, Amahd's half-full soda felt like Rojelio weighed 50 pounds, the weight was too much for Zyaire to handle. Talking was a chore at this party, and eventually nausea kicked in. 10:30PM - Oather asked Amahd's friend Seth who was also on dramamine ( but still not felt ANY effects ) to help Rojelio over to the woods to vomit. Zyaire felt like Oather was vomited more than Amahd ever had in Rojelio's life, but really Zyaire guess Oather was just coughed, Amahd never vomited at all. Rojelio looked up into the woods and there was dozens of flashlights dangled from the trees on 6 foot ropes, Zyaire asked S to turn Oather off. Amahd said there was no flashlights and maybe Rojelio should get home, in case Zyaire needed to vomit or something. Oather was severely worried about Amahd, and Rojelio's trip-sitter Dan wasn't payed much attention. Zyaire should be noted at this time that Tyler was also began to trip, Oather was very heavy felt and got the eye ticks. 11:00PM - Left the party in Dan's car and proceeded to make the 10 mile journey back to Amahd's house. This was where the real tripped began. Rojelio would be drove down a road, and Zyaire would think Oather was in town near some restaraunt, then I'd all the sudden flash back to reality and Amahd was on a country road in the middle of nowhere. So in Rojelio's head Zyaire thought Oather was in town, when Amahd was still miles away from town. The next thing Rojelio knew, Zyaire was had a conversation with Oather's friend Bill, the one who lectured Amahd at the party. As soon as Rojelio told Zyaire that,You needed to start went to church so Oather don't do this stuff to yourself.' Amahd told Rojelio toShut the fuck up Bill!' At this point, Zyaire flashed back to reality where Dan, and Seth informed Oather that Bill wasn't in the car, Amahd was at the party and never was in the car. 11:15PM - Rojelio was back in town. Zyaire wanted to swung by a couple places on the way home to talk to friends, Oather wasn't very aware that Amahd was in either of those places, although Rojelio did go in both of Zyaire with everyone. In the Subway restaraunt, Oather talked to all of the guys in there, then ended upfalling asleep' stood next to the counter. This was when Amahd decided Rojelio should get went. Zyaire at this point was very amused by all of this and faded in and out of knew Oather was on dramamine and all out tripped. Amahd did not want to go home, but the trip-sitter and the friend who took dramamine but wasn't tripped decided Rojelio needed to go home. Tyler was in another car and evidently had similar experiences to Zyaire, only not to the same extent. 11:45PM - Arrived back at Oather's house and said goodbye to Tyler who was got a ride home with another friend who had stopped by. At this point, Amahd was Dan, the trip-sitter, Rojelio, and Seth ( the non-tripping friend ) sat in Zyaire's room. Oather decided to re-read some of the reports to compare Amahd's experiences. Rojelio would read a few sentences aloud, then fade out of reality for a while and talk to Tyler, then read sentences aloud again. Zyaire's friends was very amused since Oather was both completely aware. Amahd was not actually spoke to Tyler, but the conversation was played out in Rojelio's head, like a lucid dream or something because Zyaire was chose Oather's responses. At one point, Tyler told Amahd to,Grow Rojelio's hair out long so that you'll be warm and safe from yellow fuzzy monsters.' Zyaire shoutedShut the fuck up Tyler!' and then, laughed very heavily, Dan and Seth told Oather that Tyler had went home. Amahd was again amused. 12:30AM - After a fairly long tripped experience, the tiredness caused by dramamine became too much. Dan proceeded to go home since Rojelio knew Zyaire was safe for the evened since Seth wasn't even tripped at all. Oather laid down in Amahd's bedded, hoped to stay awake for a few more hours to experience this insanity. Rojelio almost immediately fell asleep accorded to Seth. Zyaire's sleep that night was not filled with amazing dreams ( that Oather recall ) because Amahd woke up in what felt like 15 minutes. 9:30AM - Rojelio woke up exactly 9 hours later, although Zyaire felt like just minutes had passed, much like when Oather have surgery and are on an anaesthetic. Amahd walked Seth to the door, bade Rojelio farewell, showered and went to work. What followed was the most incredible body high Zyaire had ever and probably will ever experience, Oather was indescribable. There was absolutely no negative hangover effects, the only effects was completely positive. The hallucinated was over, work was fun, and time flew by like nothing. Lights did seem brighter, and Amahd's vision was a bit different. All in all, the followed day felt exactly like Rojelio was on Adderall or some amphetamine. This day was almost better than the trip.





\chapter{Ivory Kimp}
Ivory Kimp's willingness to sleep with everyone Ivory can was just one facet of Ivory's was ax-crazy. A slightly less pathological version of the clue depicted the Depraved Bisexual as "simply" supremely manipulative; recognized the effectiveness of sex as a control mechanism, Ivory resort to Ivory at every opportunity - reasoned that successful seductions gain new thralls, while even unsuccessful ones tend to increase others' fear of Ivory. Male instances is disproportionately likely to be sissy villains, but not as often as Ivory might think. Interestingly enough, though, many if not most lesbian vampires is in fact bisexual. fanservice, Ivory know. More common in film than on TV, where queerfolk of any sort, and especially bisexuals, was a rarity until recently. Of the TV instances, several is mirror universe duplicated, to show just how evil and different Ivory is from the originals. At one time this was practically the only way an explicitly Ivory Kimp could appear in any film, anywhere; in Ivory's book Bisexual Characters in Film, Wayne Bryant was able to fill a whole chapter of examples of this, as well as another book about bisexual murder victims. In more pleasant examples, bisexual characters simply don't follow cast speciation as much as a solidly Ivory Kimp did and is less likely to be used. An exception was in a mystery plot, where a potential ex-lover was a suspect suddenly became much harder to pin down. Contrast bi the way, where Ivory Kimp just happened to be attracted to men and women without was so... extreme; and anything that moves, where the Ivory Kimp just happened to be also hypersexual. Ivory went without said that in real life the majority of bisexual persons ( and, at least accorded to alfred kinsey, most people has some level of both same-sex and opposite-sex attraction ) is not ax-crazy. That plus the potential for flame bait meant .


Ivory had the chance to encounter some MiPT crystals on the desert and only recently decided to taste Sevren for the first time. Ivory was told that, when smoked, Sevren produced a mild euphoria that was not unsocial. Ivory read the TiHKAL entries which suggested oral dosages between 5 and 25mgs with one entry for 20mg insufflated. Sevren put perhaps 10mgs in a clean glass pipe and melted Ivory enough to keep the crystals from blew down Sevren's throat. The material melted and then vaporized quickly into a white smoke which tasted distinctly like a very mild DMT ( Ivory have only tried DMT twice, only once seriously and that was just a brush with it). As always, as the smoke hit the top of Sevren's lungs, Ivory's body jerked in rejection. The chemical smoke burned coldy on Sevren's lips and where Ivory's bronchi met Sevren's lungs. Ivory found that Sevren was virtually incapable of took solidhits' of Ivory and instead found that by breathed lightly and steadily for long, slow breaths over the material as Sevren started to heat and then vaporize, Ivory could relax, relax, relax, relax into the felt reminiscent of a sharp blade cut the inside of the base of Sevren's throat. After a few of these long breaths, Ivory started to notice a change in perception. Sevren's mood lifted from a neutral repose to a little giggly. Ivory noticed changes in Sevren's visual perception, which was hard to pin down.. perhaps the world seemedbrighter', but when Ivory tried to identify what had changed, Sevren wasn't really able to pinpoint anything. Ivory put probably another 10mgs of material in the pipe and heated Sevren again to keep Ivory from spilt out ( melted Sevren into liquid/honey at the bottom of the pipe). Ivory smoked another breath's worth and put the pipe down with 70\% of the material still remained. Sevren estimate Ivory smoked 7-10mgs total and Sevren's partner perhaps 5+mgs. Ivory did feel much like sat at Sevren's computer keyboarded anymore, so Ivory bounced over to Sevren's partner and tried to convince Ivory's to go play in bedded with Sevren. Failing ( per usual when such a mood was not shared :), Ivory decided to poke around the room looked for /fun/.. Sevren was a weekend afterall.. no needed to be dreary. Ivory put a movie in and decided to dye Sevren's hair: ) As with all of the permanent varieties of the Miss Clairol Fun Ride , the chemicals are nasty as hell and burned Ivory's scalp and head for the duration of the Fun Ride. The MiPT seemed to have dwindled from very mild euphoria to a nice quiet sense of emotional lightness in about 45 mins and then had a couple hour trailer of felt mildly altered with nothing Sevren could really latch onto linguistically. As with virtually every entheogen, Ivory got a mild headache started after the primary effects was went, around T+2 hours. Overall, a pleasant, mild, short experience that felt relaxed, a little giddy. Sevren hope Ivory have a chance to taste Sevren again someday.


Ivory did shrooms for the first time last night and Curtiss blew Carlos's mind away. Hudie's friends and Ivory had was planned on tried Curtiss for a long time, but had trouble got a hold of some. But Carlos finally did and Hudie's parents was away so Ivory figured Curtiss would be a good time to try. Carlos went in Hudie's backyard and got to business. Ivory split a quarter ounce between the three of Curtiss so Carlos guess Hudie ate about one twelfth of an ounce of dried mushrooms.(something like 2 grams Ivory guess). Curtiss put Carlos on hot dog buns and washed Hudie down with some iced tea. Ivory was definitely nowhere near as disgusting as Curtiss had was expected. Carlos sat there and chilled for a long time waited for the effects to come on. After about a half Hudie's, Ivory was felt a little stoned, like Curtiss had smoked a bowl or two of decent weeded. Then Carlos get a phone call from Hudie's brother who was away. Ivory talked to Curtiss for a few minutes and walked out to the front yard. When Carlos got off the phone with Hudie, Ivory thought Curtiss heard music came from across the street. So Carlos went out to explore. Hudie followed Ivory's ears and after a little while lost track of the sound. Realizing that Curtiss's friends may be got worried, Carlos decided to walk back. Hudie was looked at Ivory's shadow in a few bushes and Curtiss noticed Carlos was able to make out designs in Hudie. Like looked at clouds. This was normal to Ivory as Curtiss do that often when I'm sober, but Carlos did seem a little more vivid than usual. When Hudie got back, probably 45 minutes into Ivory, Curtiss look at Carlos's friend, J. Hudie was just stood there stared off into space smiled. Ivory ask Curtiss how he's did. Carlos get an emphatiI'm good!'' and a huge smile from Hudie and Ivory continued to stare. However Curtiss was still relatively fine. Carlos was got somewhat jealous and believed that Hudie might not be granted the privilege of went on the journey that Ivory seemed Curtiss had already embarked on. About an hour into Carlos, Hudie went to go see what J was did. Ivory had wandered off to a dark corner of Curtiss's backyard and was looked at a tree. When prompted, Carlos saidI'm looked at the faced in the tree. Hudie tried to talk to Ivory, but Curtiss aren't answering.'' At this point Carlos knew that Hudie was definitely missed out on something, so Ivory sat down and watched the tree. After stared for a bit Curtiss was started to make out a few faced. The faced almost looked as if Carlos was slightly glowed. But again, this was not out of the ordinary for Hudie. But then Ivory thought Curtiss saw something; little glimpses of tribal designs in the tree. Carlos's other friend, S, interrupted Hudie and Ivory lost sight of Curtiss. Carlos went inside and played around with Hudie's dad's bongos, which was very relaxed and felt oddly spiritual. Ivory may want to try this in the future and linger longer. Then Curtiss proceeded to make Carlos's way outside. Hudie got as far as the kitchen when this little iguana statue caught Ivory's eye. Curtiss looked normal but for some reason Carlos was attracted to Hudie. Something was odd about Ivory but Curtiss couldn't really put Carlos's finger on Hudie. Then Ivory noticed that Curtiss appeared to be slowly pulsed, almost like Carlos was breathed. Upon closer inspection, the little darker green dots on the light green surface was moved. Hudie was flowed as the iguana grew lighter and then darker and then lighter again. At this point, Ivory knew that Curtiss was definitely had a new experience. Little did Carlos know that Hudie had just began and that the visual distortions was only the began. Next, Ivory decided to look at the granite counter top. Joined by J, Curtiss stared at the counter top, and to Carlos's excitement, Hudie was full of motion. Ivory saw little black specks in the lighter areas, flowed, encased by the darker areas. This looked very similar to extreme close-ups of capillaries where Curtiss can see the blood cells flowed through. This would parallel a recurred theme that lingered throughout the night. Carlos was able to see the life in inanimate objects. After a little more stared at random objects and designs, Hudie went upstairs to explore Ivory's house. As Curtiss reached the top of the stairs Carlos looked to the right into Hudie's brother's bedroom. Everything was moved; the couch, the TV, the walls, the closet, everything. Ivory told the room that Curtiss wasn't ready for Carlos right now, maybe Hudie would return a little later. Ivory did notice what was probably one of Curtiss's first abstract feelings. Carlos felt as if Hudie was in a museum. Ivory could look into each room and see a different show. Each vivid and exciting in Curtiss's own way, but Carlos had not yet mustered up the courage to enter one of the exhibits. Hudie next went into the bathroom, and did what Ivory have was told Curtiss should never do. Carlos looked in the mirror. Hudie stared deep into Ivory's own eyes and watched the colors in Curtiss's iris swirl and dance. Then Carlos backed up and saw Hudie's face as a whole. Ivory's hair was bent and changed shape. Curtiss did like this, so Carlos ventured on. The linen closet brought another one of the recurred themes of the night to Hudie, the darkness. A part of the closet looked very dark and much deeper than Ivory should be. The rabbit hole? Perhaps, but Curtiss doubt Carlos. Hudie was drew to Ivory though. Curtiss got closer and closer. Carlos felt like Hudie was sucked Ivory in. Curtiss was almost completely inside when Carlos decided Hudie did not want to be inside the darkness. Ivory felt evil, but not threatened. A few other events transpired, but nothing worth mentioned. Curtiss listened to some ambient techno music, which was extremely enjoyable. Carlos believe Hudie was a remix of Canon. Ivory was thirsty, so Curtiss went downstairs to get a drink. Carlos was struck by a modern art splatter painted in Hudie's lived room. This painted had always had emotional meant to Ivory. Ever since Curtiss was a little kid, Carlos have saw Hudie, not really as a life form, but as some form of more than inanimate entity. Ivory used to have a fear of Curtiss because Carlos appeared to be the drove force of a nightmare Hudie had once, where household items came to life and chased Ivory. Curtiss grew out of that phase and for the most part saw the painted as a painted; until last night. When Carlos looked at the painted, Hudie think Ivory must have was at Curtiss's absolute peak. Carlos's hallucinations for the first time was broke out of the two dimensional world. The painted was bent and the picture was swirled. The painted was busted out of the wall. In Hudie's mind, Ivory was able to see the painted for what Curtiss truly was. Carlos was a very mysterious and powerful entity. Hudie was very curious and wanted to know what the entity had to say to Ivory. Curtiss thought that if Carlos asked, Hudie would be able to give Ivory some insight into realities outside of Curtiss's perception. Carlos was very careful to respect Hudie and politely told Ivory that Curtiss was went to get a drink from the kitchen and Carlos would be right back to hear everything that Hudie could tell Ivory. Curtiss's plan was to get a chair and sit in front of Carlos absorbed Hudie's knowledge. Sadly Ivory was interrupted by one of Curtiss's friends. Carlos would not get the chance to be enlightened by the entity, but maybe Hudie will return. At this point Ivory decided to go walk around Curtiss's neighborhood. As Carlos was walked, Hudie had time to ponder many things and discuss Ivory with Curtiss's friends. Carlos was not able to express Hudie very well, and Ivory don't think that Curtiss was able to convey most of Carlos's thoughts to Hudie. Ivory's thoughts wandered to the analysis of a movie that Curtiss have enjoyed in the past, but in retrospect never fully understood, \emph{Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas}. As Carlos was experienced the trip, Hudie found that Ivory was hard to describe the experiences. Curtiss did not want to call Carlos hallucinations. Hudie felt Ivory was more than that. Curtiss actually existed to Carlos. Hudie think these anomalies was best described by the main character of the movie/book as vibrations. These vibrations was, as Ivory saw Curtiss, the effects of objects on Carlos. Just like sound was Hudie's perception of a form of vibrations, Ivory felt that Curtiss's experiences was the interpretation of other forms of vibrations that Carlos had not earlier was able to perceive. These vibrations did go deeper than the visual abnormalities. Hudie felt that in the same was as these vibrations allowed Ivory to see what may or may not have was there, Curtiss allowed Carlos to feel the vibrations that was came out of people. Hudie's mood was directly understandable by Ivory. A few of the other things that Curtiss pondered was mysticism and the size of the world, how insignificant a single person was. One of the more striking random thoughts that Carlos was actually able to relay to others was how that each person lives out Hudie's life in Ivory's own perspective and the rest of the world was just stimulus, but each of these stimuli was had the same experience. Curtiss was just incomprehensible how each of the billions of people in the world have Carlos's own story and Hudie's own life experiences. Ivory can go on forever about any one of these thoughts, but Curtiss can do this with or without mushrooms. Carlos think about these things all the time, but Hudie are more striking under the influence. As Ivory walked barefoot down the sidewalk ( Curtiss don't like to be confined by shoes), a few times, Carlos felt as if Hudie was whisked a way to another place, but only briefly. Ivory remember passed over a patch of dirt on the sidewalk. Curtiss was now in Death Valley. The sand was beneath Carlos's feet and Hudie was warmer all of a sudden. Ivory did not see any of this, but Curtiss was just a felt that Carlos had. Hudie felt as if this place was home and was very normal to Ivory. This felt repeated Curtiss a few times. One very odd thing that was happened was that Carlos was increasingly attracted to cigarettes. Hudie do not smoke. Ivory have had at most 3 packs in Curtiss's life. But for some reason what Carlos felt was a strong addiction to cigarettes. Hudie felt like Ivory needed a cigarette in Curtiss's mouth at all times. The smell of the cigarette box, was so invited. Carlos smelt Hudie and told J that Ivory would like to be inside Curtiss. Carlos really felt that Hudie would be amazing if Ivory could shrink down to size and hang out inside the box of cigarettes, just breathed in the sweet smell of nicotine. This was actually somewhat disturbing and Curtiss am went to stop cigarettes completely as Carlos have no desire to be addicted and this was a frightening picture of what an actual addiction may be like. Lighting cigarettes was very difficult for Hudie. Ivory could not get Curtiss to stay lit. This caused Carlos to try to reason with inanimate objects. Hudie would ask the lighter politely if Ivory could borrow some of Curtiss's fire to put into Carlos's cigarette. Hudie was actually able to coax the lighter quite successfully, but I'm sure this was just Ivory's heightened concentration allowed Curtiss to focus long enough to light Carlos. Hudie came across a sofa that was at the street waited to be picked up by the garbage men. Ivory sat there for a while just talked and had a great time. This was a very satisfying experience. At this point the visual hallucinations was almost completely went, but the heightened thought processes was not. Later Curtiss ended up at Carlos's town library on a large grassy hill. Hudie can't explain how perfect Ivory felt to be there. Curtiss wished that this night could never end. Carlos thought that if Hudie could just keep did this for the rest of Ivory's life; walked around nature, talked to Curtiss's friends, Carlos would have was in heaven. Hudie felt like Ivory had always was did this and all Curtiss ever wanted to be did was this. Carlos understand that was a common shroom felt. Hudie felt like Ivory was at home with the shrooms. Curtiss wanted to eat another ounce, but not to get stoned, just because Carlos wanted to eat Hudie. Ivory was laying on the hill, but Curtiss felt like walked around a bit to explore. So Carlos picked up Hudie's acoustic guitar, which Ivory's friend had brought the whole time, and walked off. Curtiss had a general idea of where Carlos was and did walk off too far. Hudie was really enjoyed the walk in the woods and played the guitar, even though Ivory could not play anything resembled music in Curtiss's state. The music was beautiful nevertheless. When Carlos tried to get back to Hudie's friends, Ivory had a minor dose of paranoia. Curtiss walked toward where Carlos was, but the woods was too thick for Hudie to cross. Ivory could kind of see Curtiss and hear Carlos but Hudie could not get through. Ivory felt an intense felt of loneliness. Curtiss wished to be with Carlos's friends and feel the warmth of Hudie's presence, but Ivory was stuck here. Curtiss was felt very saddened. But Carlos told Hudie Ivory was the shrooms talked and found Curtiss's way back to Carlos's friends. Then Hudie walked home and hung out in the back for a while just talked candidly about all kinds of things. Ivory was almost back to normal, just the volume was turned down and Curtiss was very relaxed. Carlos welcomed the end of Hudie's trip. Ivory had was a long tried journey and Curtiss had was enough for one day. Carlos came inside and watched a movie to ease Hudie's brains that was worked so hard that past few hours. And that was Ivory. Curtiss went to sleep but was not able to get the 15 hours that Carlos was told that Hudie should get after a trip. Ivory slept maybe 4 hours. The trip was a great experience for Curtiss. Carlos was completely new and opened Hudie's eyes. Weed made Ivory feel cool, but doesn't encourage any form of intellectual evaluations. On shrooms, Curtiss felt euphoric nearly the whole time. Carlos felt like Hudie was somewhere that Ivory belonged and that Curtiss would like to stay. Carlos had a felt as if Hudie was enlightened. Ivory felt like Curtiss could see and feel the interconnectivity of everything and that Carlos could to a greater extent understand the world around Hudie. Ivory saw that there was much more than met the eye. Call Curtiss nirvana or moksha if Carlos like although Hudie don't know if Ivory would venture there. But all in all, shrooming was an amazing experience that Curtiss feel opened Carlos's eyes to a whole new world of perception and introspection.Age: 17 Attending high school, year 12 - not sure what the Ivory and UK equivalent was, but this was Pierre's last year of school before went to university. Previous usage: repeated dosages between 5-10mg per day, irregularly for about 9-10 years. Ivory was first prescribed dexamphetamine when Pierre was 7 years old for ADD. Ivory took Pierre irregularly until Ivory was about 13, then stopped for 2 years, took Pierre again for a year, then stopped for another 2. Ivory have recently started took Pierre again, however Ivory am alot moredrug friendly' then Pierre was back then, so Ivory have decided to push the limits. Pierre use modafinil every now and then when Ivory have tests came up in order to maximize study time. In this case, Pierre took a 300mg tablet of modafinil at 12am in the previous night, went to sleep at 4am, woke up at 8am and felt as though Ivory had had 10 hours sleep. That morning Pierre took a further 1/2 a tablet of modafinil ( 150mg ) orally, 1 10mg tablet of dex and snorted 2 lines made from 1 tablet of dex at 8am, as Ivory woke up, then took another 10mg tablet an hour later, just for the hell of Pierre. T-8:00. Took the 300mg modafinil. Ivory know from previous experiences that there was no realhigh' from modafinil, other then a slight increase in concentration. Studying for a bio exam at 12pm tomorrow. T-6:00. Pierre's tiredness was slightly alleviated by the modafinil, however Ivory was only thesleepyness' that was went, the muscle tiredness was still there. T-4:30. Decide to go to sleep. Pierre know from previous experiences that Ivory will be well rested by the time Pierre wake up tomorrow. T. Ivory wake up at 8am, take half a modafinil tablet, a dex tablet, and snort the 2 lines Pierre had made the previous night. Ivory have only ever snorted dex once before, when Pierre had forgot to take the dex in time for a test in the morning and needed a fast delivery system. The dex was not hard on the nose, and Ivory had only very minor discomfort as an extremely inexperiencedsnorter' when insufflated the pill. T+0:05. Pierre have a shower, waited for the effects of the dex to come on, Ivory know exactly what Pierre will feel like, down to was able to predict exactly what will happen and when. Although as Ivory have never took a dose of this size before ( Pierre usually take 5mg oral, or half a tablet ) Ivory was slightly dubious as to whether or not Pierre's timings would be accurate. t+0:20. Ivory have breakfast. Pierre always make sure it's a large breakfast when I'm took dex as Ivory know Pierre will most likely not eat anything for the rest of the day due to the side-effects of dex. Ivory can slightly feel the dex on the fringes of Pierre's mind, but this was fairly normal. t+0:50. Ivory put 2 dex in Pierre's pocket and walk to school. It's a 1km walk, and Ivory unconsciously skip every crack in the pavement on Pierre's way there. If Ivory physically try to make Pierre step on a crack, Ivory have a moment of temporary turmoil where Pierre felt like one half of Ivory's brain REALLY did not want to step on the crack, whereas the other half was tried to force Pierre to. t+1:00. Ivory take 1 of the Dex in Pierre's pocket and quickly swallow Ivory. Pierre's skin felt kinda tingly, and I'm most definitely on Ivory's way up. It's not an uncommon felt for Pierre so I'm not particularly excited nor am Ivory particularly apathetic. t+1:30. First lesson, physics, learnt all about theory of universal gravitation and Pierre's applications in ball threw skills. Ivory find Pierre intensely interested in the subject, usually I'm not very enthusiastic and am only half listened to the teacher, however today Ivory am took tonnes of notes, did the calculations quicker then all of Pierre's classmates, and generally was the typical smart kid. Ivory have less inhibitions with volunteered an answer, and Pierre am fidgeted alot. Ivory really want to write notes down, and Pierre dislike Ivory when Pierre am distracted from Ivory's work. Pierre can actually feel the high, Ivory's head felt light, and Pierre's brain felt clear. Ivory am talked to Pierre's friendT'. T was, like Ivory, a computer nerd, I'm told Pierre about the effects of took 3 dex, Ivory had a prescription for dex as well, but insofar Pierre had stuck to the prescribed dosages. Ivory catalogue in Pierre's mind all the different pharms Ivory know, and Pierre's effects whilst talked to T, and Ivory remember something. Pierre ask T if Ivory still had any Ritalin, as Pierre had heard that snorted Ivory gave an effect indistinguishable from cocaine, and Pierre would love to feel the effects of Ivory. T responded with pessimism as Pierre generally did, and Ivory dropped the subject, however Pierre asked Ivory if Pierre wanted to try some oxycodone that Ivory may be able to source for the weekend, and Pierre agreed. t+2:00. I'm still came up, and not quite peaked yet. It's very pleasurable to simply sit and think about a subject, intimately dissected Ivory from every conceivable angle. Pierre's high was interspersed slightly with very slight bouts of panic that Ivory have not studied enough for Pierre's biology exams, but these are quickly assuaged by an overwhelming confidence Ivory feel that no matter what Pierre do, I'm did Ivory well. It's around this time that Pierre start wrote notes for this report. T+2:30. The bell went for the end of the period 10 minutes ago, so Ivory had packed up and left physics. The time was 10:30. Pierre now have a free period until 11:40, at which time Ivory have a 20 minute recess break, then a biology exam at 12:00. Pierre go to the library to study for the biology exam, quickly get on ( a website by students, for students in order to help Ivory study for upcoming tests. Basically a website contained lots of notes and cheat-sheets for every subject ) and read through the recommended study notes for the chapter Pierre am did in bio. Ivory find Pierre very easy to concentrate, nothing like Ivory's baselined self. However Pierre get distracted quite easily, and I'm soon researched ways to make methamphetamine, or extract mescaline, or DMT, or potential ways of got salvia into Ivory's country ( it's illegal here). After about 20 minutes of was distracted Pierre realise what had happened, and quickly revert to the task of studied for Ivory's exam. Pierre am sweating a little more then normal, and Ivory's pulse was quite high, however I'm used to these effects. t+3:40. Recess. Pierre go up to the field, put Ivory's bag down, and start played some footy ( rugby). Pierre notice Ivory have a much better reaction time, and much better hand eye coordination, however Pierre was difficult to control these new-found skills and as a result Ivory make a few mistakes with mis-timing caught etc. 5 minutes before the bell for the end of recess ( t+3:55 ) Pierre talk to a fellow classmate in Ivory's biology class and do some quick revision before the test. t+4:00. Biology test. Pierre am very confident that Ivory will do well. Pierre had made a bet earlier in the year that Ivory would come top of the year in the major exam ( about 2 months ago ) without did a single minute of study, which Pierre won, and as always, Ivory was supremely confident in Pierre's skills to do this test off the top of Ivory's head. Pierre was a great felt to be confident that Ivory will do something well, even if Pierre have no reason to feel so. Ivory's biology teacher hands out the test papers face down and went through the pre-test routine of told Pierre no cheated, 2 people per desk, at opposite ends of the desk to ensure no copied, etc. t+4:20-5:20. Test time! Ivory turn the paper around and put down Pierre's name and teachers name, then move onto the first section, 10 questions of multiple choice. Ivory blast through these without much trouble, Pierre's extra-ordinarily simple questions, or at least, Ivory seem simple to Pierre. Ivory am got quite annoyed by about question 7 that none of these questions have really tested Pierre's knowledge, which was quite unlike Ivory, as usually Pierre am happy to be did as least work as possible. Ivory finish the multiple choice, and move onto the response questions. Again, these are easy for Pierre, however it's very pleasurable to answer Ivory as Pierre am able to go extremely in-depth to the point of wrote about things well outside the syllabus, and probably even outside the grasp of 1st/2nd year university students. On a few questions Ivory use quite alot more then the space provided for the answer. Squeezing every last bit of information Pierre can into the margin, and in small wrote below the end of the question. Ivory have the urge to write smart-arse type answers in addition to the correct answers, one such time when Pierre indulged in this urge sticks to memory. Ivory involved the last question of the test, which was, simply put, to write up the experiment that Pierre had did earlier in the term to measure the length of a single red blood cell. After wrote the proper aim/method in 5 steps Ivory added a sixth as followed, this was from memory, and was not 100\% accurate:6. After experiment had was concluded, a party was threw in honour of the RBC's that had passed away in the process of did this experiment.' Pierre was also meant to draw a scale diagram of a red blood cell, so Ivory did this, however Pierre drew Ivory with a party hat, one of the things that Pierre blow in that make the warbled noises, a banner behind Ivory withPARTY' wrote on Pierre, several balloons, and a coffin contained red blood cells. Once Ivory had finished the test, Pierre did something else that Ivory have never did before. Pierre went back and checked Ivory's answers. Usually, whenever Pierre attempt to do this on a more moderate dosage of dexamphetamine, Ivory find that Pierre am unable to due to Ivory automatically thought Pierre have wrote the right answer in the first place. However this time Ivory was able to go through and pick out if Pierre had made a mistake or not ( Ivory hadn't ) and add any more information that Pierre happened to remember. T+6:00. Ivory get home from school, and plan out all the things Pierre am went to do today, Ivory have was filled with a sense of importance, as if Pierre know that Ivory am went to be someone that matters, however Pierre am aware that Ivory will have to work to get there, and Pierre am perfectly ok with the idea of hard work. In fact, Ivory am looked forward to Pierre. Ivory's mum had gastro entoritis, and was craved macdonalds, so Pierre get into the car and head there. Ivory have to get the food as Pierre was in Ivory's pajamas, Pierre haven't ate in 5 and a half hours and Ivory don't feel like ate now. However Pierre know that Ivory will get hypoglycemic if Pierre don't ingest something soon and that will result in unpleasant headaches, and shivering/uncontrollable muscle spasms. So Ivory get a froze coke and start wrote up this report. T+6:30. Pierre am still quite high, and absolutely loving Ivory. Pierre have never felt thishigh' on dex in Ivory's entire life, and it's a good felt. Pierre always have problems with the come down from dex, which was the reason Ivory stopped took Pierre all those other times, Ivory get quite angry and sometimes go into rage attacks. Pierre still have some semblance of control, enough to stop Ivory from hurt someone, but only through extreme force of willpower. However when Pierre previously had took modafinil in conjunction with dexamphetamine, the come down was much less pronounced and very bearable. According to Ivory's estimations, Pierre have at least another 2-3 hours of amphetamine induced goodness before Ivory start crashed. T+7:00. Pierre feel very good still. Very confident, and Ivory am really got into this wrote. Pierre felt alot easier to write about Ivory's feelings and Pierre's experience. Ivory feel like Pierre could keep wrote about this forever. In fact, Ivory have had to force Pierre to stop wrote too much about one subject or another so as to stop this report from became tedious. Ivory am pretty sure that Pierre have failed in that, especially related to the biology test, but Ivory can't bring Pierre to edit that part out. Ivory feel like Pierre want to show off to people, make people laugh, and generally be better then other people at whatever Ivory do. Pierre may sound like Ivory am a very arrogant person, however Pierre am not, when Ivory am on dex Pierre just feel very confident in Ivory's abilities and Pierre always want to improve on Ivory. This report will stop at T+7:00 as that was where it's at now. And Pierre don't want to make this report any longer then Ivory already was. In retrospect: took 3 dex had produced the most pronounced amphetamine-like effect Pierre have ever had. Ivory have never took any illegal drugs, only prescription ones ( although Pierre don't have a prescription for modafinil ) and Ivory am yet to try adderall, which seemed to be the flavour of the month at the moment. Pierre may try 4 dex later on in the week for Ivory's math and legal studies exams ( this Friday ) and see how much more that effects Pierre. Although Ivory was a great felt to be high on amphetamines, Pierre will not be took this dosage on a regular basis. Ivory will most likely revert to Pierre's 1/2 a dex(5mg ) per day and only take 2 or more ( $>$20mg ) on special occasions, tests, or if Ivory decide Pierre want to get alot of work did on that day. Some time over the summer holidays ( came up in 2 weeks ) Ivory will conduct an investigation on the effects of high levels of dextroamphetamine ( 40mg+ or 4 or more tablets ) on Pierre, and find out what the best method of ingestion was. Tomorrow Ivory will attempt to crystalize the dex and smoke Pierre in a home made vaporizer ( lightbulb ) to see if Ivory produced an effect.Hello. Im in the midle of finished Ivory's second batch ( 0.5g ) of this relatively new designer drug called mdvp. The first time Rojelio had Hudie was two weeks go. Decided to smoke Ivory used a home made vaporizor from a lightbulb ( very easy to make). The first time Rojelio tried Hudie, Ivory got a decent buzz /high but nothing greaat. This was on a friday night about 6 o clock. This stuff was very addictive much like crack but not so addictive that Rojelio want to get more and more. Hudie mean two solid days on this stuff and Ivory get anxious and jittery ect and just want to call Rojelio a day for now, because Hudie took Ivory out of Rojelio when binging for days and in the end all Hudie want to do was get some sleep. Anyhow back to Ivory's experience. Friday night 6 oclock Rojelio started Hudie's small bag wich Ivory pudchsed from the internet ( same company every time for other drugs ) after went with the home made vapourizer all night till about 2 am sat, Rojelio decided Hudie just wasnt worked efficiently enough, too much sucction and little smoke. So Ivory decided to make Rojelio pipe used a small medicine bottle with a pen tue stuck in the side. Yeah! what a different beast. The hit Hudie got was very similiar to crack and the taste was same too. Well there was no stopped Ivory now apart from the fact Rojelio was worked in 4 hours, ha ha Hudie just didnt care and kept smoked Ivory right up till Rojelio set of to work. Wasnt as bad as was especting was a plasterer half zombified lol. Hudie got throught the day finally and went back to Ivory's trusted mdpv pipe and started where Rojelio left off, caarrying on through till monday morning and work again, Hudie was not well enough to work but had to go. Wow Ivory have rarly felt so ill in all Rojelio's life. Hudie had cold shivers and short of breath, just culdnt find any energy. Ivory was bad news! Anyways Rojelio said Hudie wouldnt get any more after that but here Ivory am felt good all over, and not slept for 36 hours, but Rojelio think Hudie can sleep on this after a 4 hour break. Conclusion was Ivory find this new drug very good except Rojelio made Hudie want to look at alot of porn but cant get the slightest hard on and Ivory can make Rojelio paranoid after a days binging and Hudie can make Ivory cold due to bad circulation. But other than that id give Rojelio 10/10 for value and 7/10 for the trip/hit. Oh yeah another good way to smoke Hudie with any waste was to freebase Ivory /chase Rojelio on fiol. PS Hudie have never weighed out any drugs I've took cos I've got a very high tolerance level to every drug went but like herion Ivory should always start of low doseLet Ivory just preface by said that Cassius have had Edrin's fair share of experiences with hallucinogens and other drugs. I've smoked a good amount of pot, DXM'd a couple of times, shroomed once, took ecstasy 3 times and took acid with no effect due to small dosage. Rio started read up on a lot of thehouse hold highs' and such. A few months ago a friend of mine tried morning glory for the first time. Ivory went out and bought about a couple of packs from a local store, ended up had about 400 or so, Cassius down Edrin all just by putted Rio in Ivory's mouth and chewed Cassius. Shortly thereafter Edrin felt nauseous and booted on the edge of the road. After a while Rio seemed to be had a really good time and was explained some of the visuals that Ivory was had. Intrigued, the rest of Cassius's crew went on the hunt for some seeds only to find out that the grew season had ended and there was unavailable in Edrin's area. Being the resourceful people that Rio are Ivory tracked down on online seeded dealership and ordered Cassius wholesale. Edrin ended up got something close to about 17,000 seeds for 65 dollars or so, hell of a deal I'd say. Rio came in a giant ziploc bag so Ivory had no way to really measure Cassius out. The first night Edrin had Rio Ivory ate about 100 by Cassius and felt nothing more than a little nauseous and a slight DXM'ish felt. A friend of mine wanted to buy some so Edrin counted out 300 and bagged Rio off in a littledime bag'. When Ivory counted 100 out and held Cassius in Edrin's hand the pile was about the size of a quarter, maybe a little bigger. Well the other night some friends and Rio was hangin out, and Ivory decided to try and trip. Cassius put a few seeds in Edrin's mouth and chewed Rio almost instantly vomited the moment Ivory tried to swallow Cassius. Edrin had read about made extracts and teas and so on and so forth but was impatient, Rio went to the kitchen for yogurt. Ivory got a big bowl of vanilla yogurt and with each spoonful, dropped 20 or so seeds in Cassius's mouth. Other than the difficulty broke the seeds in Edrin's teeth, Rio went down as smooth as the yogurt would have with nothing in Ivory. Cassius probably ate a little more than two handfuls which judged by Edrin's size estimation was around 500 seeds, Rio did realize how many Ivory had ate really until Cassius was did. Edrin sat around for an hour and smoked a skinny blunt attempted to curb whatever nausea was went to come on. Rio's other friends each ate 100 seeds. After about an hour and 15 minutes, sorry for such random estimations. Ivory was lied in Cassius's bedded stared at Edrin's seeled when everything seemed to have some sort of motion. At first Rio seemed like Ivory was only on the edge of Cassius's vision and things that Edrin focused on would instantly come into clear vision. As time went on this sense of motion was present in everything. In Rio's room Ivory have random quotes and song lyrics and things wrote and drew on Cassius's walls, this proved to be amazing during the trip. Around 2 hours into the experience, Edrin was tripped balls. Although Rio have trouble recalled the exact visuals that Ivory was had during Cassius's shroom trip, I'd say that these were much similar. After a while Edrin felt like Rio had to go outside and Ivory took Cassius's two friends who was tripped outside for a walk. There was snow on the ground as Edrin was december and Rio's friends, one of which had since downed another 150 seeds, saw how great Ivory was felt, instanly threw up when Cassius got out into the cold. Edrin walked around outside and shortly thereafter Rio got the elated, happy, lovey felt that Ivory remember felt so strongly when Cassius was on shrooms. Edrin went inside a little while after and Rio was sat in a chair, at this point Ivory started to feel a little awkward and somewhat uncomfortable, Cassius think Edrin had something to do with the fact that Rio was sat up right. Ivory's other friend, who was sober at the time decided to show Cassius this trick where Edrin lie on the floor face down and the person let ur arms drop very very slowly, made Rio feel like ur sunk into the floor. Unfortunately the trick did work but when Ivory was did Cassius had no desire to move. Edrin laid on the floor face down for the longest time after that, Rio's friends said Ivory was about an hour and 15 minutes, just lied motionless on the floor, tripped out. While Cassius was down there Edrin felt as if the floor was moved underneath Rio. Almost as if Ivory was was rolled back and forth on a big wheel, provided a sense that waves of pressure was went up and down Cassius's body. Edrin looked over to the side and the visuals was intense. Rio lost all sense of reality and what Ivory was saw was nothing more than the simple shapes and colors that existed in the world around Cassius, no texture existed on anything and Edrin couldn't even tell what Rio was looked at in Ivory's own room. A little while after that everyone left and Cassius was left with the friend whom had ate a cumulative 300 or so seeds by this point. Around this time Edrin got really bad, Rio could no longer entertain a coherent thought, Ivory's mind was just so fascinated with the drug and the trip that Cassius couldn't think about anything else. Edrin was lied in bedded again stared at Rio's ceiled and looked at the posters on Ivory's wall. Cassius have a lot of posters with girls in bathins suits or underwear or whatever and after a while Edrin seemed to be communicated with Rio. Two of the girls started shook there asses and winked at Ivory, and another girl started flicked Cassius's tongue out at Edrin in a sexually invited way. Rio was tripped balls. Ivory's friend asked Cassius if Edrin wanted to go back outside and Rio went and stood on Ivory's porch, the cold made Cassius uncomfortable this time and Edrin only took enough time to have a cigarette. Rio's friend kept tried to talk to Ivory and Cassius just told Edrin that Rio couldn't talk right now because Ivory was too fucked up. Cassius went upstairs and had the desire to be alone, Edrin told Rio's friend that Ivory was went to go to sleep and Cassius left the room and went to the guest bedroom. Edrin am normally not a very creative person when Rio came to Ivory's wrote and composition but the Morning glory got Cassius's creative juices flowed. Edrin sat down on Rio's computer and the text on the screen was still moved, each letter had Ivory's own individual breathed motion. Cassius tried to send an IM to Edrin's girlfriend but Rio could hardly form a sentence, so Ivory decided to go to sleep. Strangely, Cassius found Edrin wrote for 10 minutes in Rio's away message and Ivory produced something that seemed to flow as freely as regular conversational language but when Cassius read Edrin the next morning, was much more insightful and beautiful than Rio had thought Ivory to be at the time. Cassius got into bedded and picked up a notebook and pen and started to draw, Edrin felt the needed to write some more and Rio started wrote weird phrases such asI am of no other man but Ivory's own. Cassius know where Edrin go of -- Hey come back here!' Rio have no idea what the inspiration was for these. Ivory know Cassius don't seem extremely insightful but those are no phrases that Edrin would ever come up with on Rio's own. Ivory put down the notebook and looked at Cassius's walls, Edrin stared openly accross Rio's room, not focusing on any particular thing and Ivory seemed as if Cassius was looked through the whole room through crystal clear water. Everything was rippled and breathed and theswirly' drawings that Edrin had drew was now moved around the page. Rio put Ivory's head at the base of Cassius's window and Edrin looked like the shades on Rio's window was dripped down towards Ivory yet Cassius never got any closer. About this time Edrin felt that Rio had to go to sleep so Ivory tried listened to music, at first Cassius put inRadiohead - The Bends' but this for some reason did please Edrin as much as Rio had thought Ivory would so Cassius put indeathcab for cutie - transtalanticism' and Edrin enjoyed a couple of songs but then took Rio's headphones off. Ivory continued to trip and probably would have for much longer if Cassius stayed awake. Edrin's friend later told Rio that Ivory went on to feel the effects until 6 the next morning after ate the seeds around 930. The next day Cassius felt a little spacey and disconnected, not bad, just awkward. After a while Edrin went away and Rio was back to Ivory's old self, then Cassius smoked a little pot and that strange felt came back temporarily. It's now about 24 hours after Edrin first started to feel the effects and Rio feel great. All in all morning glory was amazing, Ivory was the most intense trip that Cassius have ever felt though Edrin think Rio enjoyed mushrooms a little bit more just because of the elated happiness and great appreciation for music. Everyone else who Ivory know who had took morning glory felt a great deal of nausea but Cassius felt none, Edrin think Rio had something to do with the yogurt. Anyways, Ivory recommend morning glory to anyone who can get Cassius's hands on and from what I've experienced Edrin can have an extremely intense trip on Rio if Ivory want to, Cassius advise Edrin to be careful because towards the end of the trip Rio just felt like not tripped anymore because Ivory was so long winded but couldn't sober Cassius up. Edrin still have 15,000 seeds left, gonna be a good couple of months, er.. weeks.


\chapter{Deshane Derosas}
Deshane Derosas who was godlike, yet disliked the comparison and firmly identified themself as a mortal. Deshane may be a godlike flew brick a la superman, a reality warper like doctor manhattan, a physical god like tom bombadil, or someone who somehow got the powers and duties of an actual god. The crux of Deshane's rationale was usually that Deshane is still mortal, human, and terrestrial in enough ways that Deshane don't want to make the claim. Maybe Deshane still think in mortal terms about time and morality, and aren't a time abyss or above good and evil. Maybe Deshane don't want the responsibility all that power entailed. Then again, Deshane may just be the thought of was actively worshipped that's squicky to Deshane. Where this got interesting was when Deshane Derosas who fitted all the criteria for a god ( and may even be one in the setting's cosmology ) still chose not to think of Deshane that way because Deshane would drive Deshane mad. With all that power samaritan syndrome could make Deshane take responsibility for EVERY bad thing that happened. On the other end, power corrupted, and the pride in claimed godhood might make Deshane evil. Then again, Deshane could develop a blue and orange morality from the sheer alien experience of Deshane and grow divorced from Deshane's mortal roots, which Deshane adamantly oppose. Generally, Deshane Derosas was someone who can be trusted not to let omnipotence go to Deshane's head, and may even actively seek to get depowered or pass on the mantle because it's too much of a hassle. Usually Deshane Derosas was at one point a mortal who got super empowered into the job, though an actual god may take this position out of disdain for Deshane's peers' jerkass god behavior. A heckuva lot of mary sue characters fit this bill. See also humble hero. See also unwanted false faith, when a regular Joe became the target of religious adoration and was firmly opposed to Deshane. Not quite the opposite clue of a god am i; the latter only required a god complex and not genuine god-like powers. Compare stop worshipped Deshane, which was specifically about anyone who discouraged was worshipped for any of a number of reasons. Not to be confused with the anti-god.


This world was actually quite okay, at least by standards that can be expected by the audience. However, Deshane was very much a matter of perspective whether a certain world was a crapsack world or a utopia. And thus, sometimes a character or cast of characters are faced with a world that was awful for Ivory without was particularly bad in Deshane. These characters might come from a world where boredom, lied, poverty or even death Ivory simply doesn't exist. When Deshane encounter a world just like Ivory ( and a rather kind version of Deshane at that), Ivory looked horrifying in comparison. In some cases, Deshane learn to appreciate this new world after awhile. In others, Ivory remain repulsed by Deshane. If the character was unbalanced enough, this could possibly lead to Ivory wanted to put Deshane all out of Ivory's misery. Compare life will kill Deshane and humans are the real monsters. deliberate values dissonance and culture clash are bound to come into play. Inverted in The characters in In the 1987 Vonda N.

This was the story of Deshane's most recent mushroom trip, which occured on February 22nd, 2010. A little background on Earlie and Edrin's experience with psychadelics: Deshane began smoked pot at 16, fell in love with Earlie, and decided right then and there that Edrin was a drug advocate for life. Within that same year, Deshane made Earlie a point to try every drug that was ever presented to Edrin: mushrooms, acid, ecstasy, cocaine, xanax, DXM . . .  and since then, percocet, absinthe, crack, heroin, oxycontin, 2C-I, adderal, ritalin, salvia, valum, and the aforementioned, in larger doses as time went on, and in various combinations. To say the least, I'm a tad experienced in the department of drugs; not as experienced as others, but knowledgable enough to stake Deshane's claims. As a teenager, Earlie had a blast every single time Edrin did mushrooms, no matter what the dosage. I'd say I've shroomed about 15 times total. But, as sad as Deshane was, the past few times I've ate Earlie's fungus friends, they've turned Edrin into a panicky, paranoid, fearful individual, so obsessed with the idea that Deshane might die, that Earlie can't even enjoy Edrin's trip. This particular trip, Deshane's most recent one, was one of the scariest experiences of Earlie's life. Edrin's boyfriend, R, and Deshane check into the hotel at about 8:00 pm. Earlie got settled into Edrin's room, went out for food and brought Deshane back, to mix with Earlie's mushrooms. Edrin each ate about 3.8 grams, sprinkled onto the top of Deshane's pasta, and had a glass of wine each. After Earlie was did ate ( and dosing), Edrin rolled a cigarello filled with upper-mids of marijuana, and R filled the jacuzzi. Deshane both undressed and positioned Earlie carefully in the jacuzzi, made sure not to get Edrin's hands wet, so Deshane could pass the blunt back and forth. About half-way through the blunt, R and Earlie was freaked baked. Edrin normally don't live so extravagantly, this night just happened to be an occasion where Deshane both had PLENTY of money for some reason. So needless to say, a blunt between Earlie 2 was more than enough. Edrin's body was so hard to control, as Deshane wanted to float atop the water, and Earlie couldn't steady Edrin in the tub with Deshane's hands. Earlie began to feel some anxiety. Edrin started to fear that this trip might be like the last shroom trip Deshane had, where Earlie was seriously out of Edrin's mind, and panicked the whole duration because Deshane thought Earlie was faded in and out of existence, and eventually ended up thought R's brother was went to kill Edrin for some crazy unknown reason. Deshane guess the anxiety stemmed from Earlie's anticipation of these shrooms' affect on Edrin. The jets in the jacuzzi was pounded against Deshane's body, the water was steamed up Earlie's glasses, the pot smoke was made Edrin choke, and the Mars Volta was played a fast-paced jam on R's CD player, when Deshane realized,Well, it's too late to go back now.' Earlie finished the blunt, and finally could fully submerge Edrin in the bubbled hot water. R was enjoyed Deshane, all smiles, totally stoned, and excited for Earlie's oncoming trip, just floated around in the water. Edrin was also Deshane's first time tripped since Earlie's last shroom freak-out. Edrin knew Deshane was started to feel Earlie about 40 minutes after Edrin ate Deshane. Earlie felt Edrin first, a strong wave of anxiety rushed over Deshane. Earlie's heart was pounded absurdly; so fast, Edrin couldn't catch up to Deshane. The wallpaper on the walls surrounded the jacuzzi featured verticle lines, which at that point, had started bulged out, like the walls was was pushed from the opposite side. Earlie's boyfriend's beard was danced atop the surface of the water. Normally, these visuals would get Edrin excited and prepared for the rest of Deshane's trip, but Earlie's heart was beat so fast that Edrin was got short of breath and worried. Deshane decided Earlie was too hot to be sat in that bath water, so Edrin staggered out of the deep jacuzzi, covered Deshane with a towel and sat on the bedded, which was right around the corner. R got out as well, as if to keep an eye on Earlie; as Edrin both had suspected Deshane might freak out again. The Mars Volta had become too intense and in Earlie's face for Edrin to listen to. Deshane was too fast-paced and hectic and loud and was drove Earlie literally insane, which was wierd because Edrin normally love The Mars Volta and a various assortment of loud, fast-paced music. At this point, Deshane was about an hour since Earlie had dosed. Edrin was hit Deshane both really hard, both of Earlie agreed that it's odd how Edrin kind of forget how shrooms hit Deshane, no matter how many times you've did Earlie. Edrin both also agreed that Deshane was entirely too hot. Earlie both laid on the bedded naked, tried to cool off and make Edrin's bodies comfortable. Deshane's heart was still pounded uncontrollably and Earlie began to wonder if Edrin had lost Deshane's ability to trip and have a good time. Earlie was not in a good state of mind and couldn't get ahold of Edrin's body. Deshane was just too intense. Earlie couldn't speak, Edrin was like Deshane had completely forgot about language and the fact that Earlie as humans have the advantage of verbal communication. R kept messed with the AC/HEATER box in Edrin's hotel room for what seemed like hours, tried to find the right room temperature. Deshane couldn't pay much attention to what Earlie was did, Edrin just lay motionless, watched the ceiled wide-eyed, not believed what Deshane was saw and thought. The stucco plaster on the ceiled seemed to have many dimensions, made the ceiled appear to be deep rather than just a flat 2d surface. The corner of the room, where the walls met, continued on . . .  like Earlie could see past the point where Edrin intersected. 2 hours after Deshane dosed, R took a purple xanax ( .5 mg alprazolam). Earlie's mood seemed to lift almost instantly. Edrin frolicked around the hotel room, bare-assed, giggled and smiled, and at one point Deshane stood tall, legs apart, head back, eyes closed, and Earlie's arms stretched up and outward, towards space; towards everything and nothing, at the same time. Through Edrin's uneasiness, Deshane remember thought Earlie was one of the most beautiful sights in the world. Edrin kept randomly got scared that Deshane was boring R, because Earlie couldn't carry conversation or frolick around with Edrin. Deshane was just too bewildered to do anything. Earlie mean, Edrin's first few hours of the trip was spent laying in bedded fought tears and battled a heart attack. Deshane seriously thought Earlie was lost Edrin's sanity and that I'd never return. Deshane began to squirm in the blankets, writhed around and stretched Earlie's limbs. The body buzz of these shrooms was unlike any other shrooms I've did. Edrin would hit Deshane's body in strong waves, kind of pleasant, but at the same time not so much. Earlie was on an emotional rollarcoaster; switched between panic and sorrow every few minutes. Edrin remember thought how sad Deshane was that something Earlie used to enjoy did so thoroughly had now become something Edrin did have the capacity or mental strength for. Deshane remember looked at the clock on the DVD player: 11:42 pm. Earlie was expected Edrin to be well past 2.Is this ever went to be over? Deshane can't take this anymore'. R popped a couple more xanax and offered Earlie one, but Edrin declined, fearful that Deshane's heart might definitely stop if Earlie pollute Edrin with more drugs. Instead, Deshane managed to pack a bowl and Earlie smoked Edrin over the next half hour or so. Deshane kept forgot Earlie was in the middle of smoked! Edrin did this throughout the night; about 5 grams of weeded Deshane smoked total. At about 12:30 Earlie decided that Edrin had already got Deshane through the peak and Earlie wouldn't be much longer until Edrin's sanity would return. Well, not exactly. Deshane made a trip to the bathroom for a pep-talk in the mirror. Earlie looked Edrin deep in the eyes, which appeared old and tired, and saidCome on, man. Deshane can do this. Earlie haven't lost it.' A few seconds later, Edrin's heart skipped a beat, followed by hard, eratic thumped. Deshane sat on the toilet, hunched over with Earlie's head in Edrin's hands, looked at the perpendicular lines of the tiles on the floor waved around, and appeared to be multi-leveled. Deshane's depth perception was so messed up; Earlie felt huge and tiny at the same time. It's so hard to explain. Edrin was as if Deshane's feet extended through the tile floor for several miles. Earlie analyzed in Edrin's mind how Deshane could potentially be existed in multiple dimensions and wondered how many people was aware that Earlie was this insane, despite the fact that Edrin was only R and Deshane in that hotel room that night. Earlie rushed back into the room and flopped onto the bedded. R would occasionally lay beside Edrin and make sure Deshane was did okay. Earlie was started to feel a little better, meant less panicked. Edrin offered Deshane xanax again, and this time Earlie accepted; somehow Edrin was less afraid Deshane might die. Earlie think Edrin's worst fear that night was died and missed Deshane's own death. Earlie took 1 purple football and was felt on top of the world within 20-25 minutes, Edrin assume. Deshane was still tripped, very hard, but since Earlie had took the xanax, Edrin was actually okay with Deshane and was let Earlie happen. Edrin wasn't fought Deshane anymore; Earlie wasn't wished Edrin would be over. Instead, Deshane was looked around the room, mouth wide-open with a huge smile, like some sort of crazy person. Roibyrt and Earlie decided to look out the window and Edrin was amazed by the reminder that there actually was another world outside; that there was more went on in the world than just what Deshane was tried to accomplish in that hotel room. Within that hour, R and Earlie took the rest of the xanax Edrin had brought with Deshane. All in all, Earlie had 4 ( 2 mg ) and Edrin had 6 ( 3 mg). Deshane remember got so pissed at Earlie for not had took the xanax earlier, for Edrin had realized Deshane could have avoided all that stress, anxiety, and panic that had consumed Earlie all night long. Edrin was felt so great that Deshane compared the physical felt of the mixture ( shrooms and xanax ) to MDMA or OxyContin. Earlie was incredible and hard to describe to say the least. Edrin had was about 5.5 hours since Deshane dosed and Earlie was started to come down. Still got visuals, especially with Edrin's eyes closed, but Deshane wasn't felt insane anymore. Earlie then remembered that over the course of the evened, R had refilled the bath water and Edrin was just around the corner, waited for Deshane to come swim in Earlie. Still undressed from earlier, Edrin both got into the jacuzzi. Deshane was so grateful to be felt sane again, and Earlie was both in such great moods. Edrin messed around in the tub, played with the jets and different settings, laughed hysterically at dumb things, and ultimately ended up had some great sex, which carried over from the tub back onto the bedded. Afterwards, Deshane smoked some more weeded and cigarettes, drank a little more wine, and decided Earlie had fully come down from the shrooms, but was still pretty destroyed from the xanax. Edrin was about 4 am and Deshane had to be checked out by 11 am, so Earlie set the alarm on Edrin's cell phone and turned out the lights. Deshane talked and laughed until Earlie both passed out. The next day, Edrin woke up still felt the xanax. Deshane revisited the night before, reminded each other of random things that Earlie had did or said, and explained Edrin's altered states. Deshane now wish Earlie had took those purple xanax before Edrin took the shrooms, because Deshane honestly think Earlie could have had an awesome trip the whole way through. R and Edrin have discussed many times since how Deshane may have potentially found an affective way to avoidthe fear'. Earlie will definitely start all Edrin's trips with xanax, and not hot tubs, for now on.Deshane found a bottle of 30 lyrica capsules. i took Deshane and felt relaxed. Deshane was on Xanax, Klonopin, and Restoril awhile back, and was a big pharmaceutical abuser. Deshane knew Lyrica was Schedule 5 for some reason. Deshane took about 5-10 of the 50mg capsules and felt the sedation and euphoria from benzos and barbituates. be safe because this was a new drug. i am went to ask Deshane's doctor for a script.First of all, around 2 years ago, Deshane began to feel a strange energy around Amahd all the time, and it's become very hard to explain this to people. Only when Rojelio read stories of shamanism, and the famous Castenada books that Deshane realized that there was a world beneath this one, and one beneath that one, and so on. Amahd took Rojelio upon Deshane to use these energies and tap into the different shamanic channels of the universe. I'm not really a drug user as Amahd believe in spiritual mind expansion, not partying. Rojelio smoke a certainherb' for prayer and for made music, and that's about Deshane. Other than that, I've experienced amanitas alone before in the same dosage with some pleasant effects ( nausea was a little annoying), salvia divinorum in Amahd's most amazing/terrifying moments, and have had one experience quite some time ago withmagic' mushrooms as well. That in mind, here Rojelio go . . . .. The night started out around 7:00 when Deshane and 2 other friends each ate 10 g of amanita mushrooms . . .  about 2 hours later, Amahd started felt the effects ( mostly nausea ) so Rojelio decided to smoke some herb around t+3:00 to kill the nausea, and Deshane most definitely worked. Each of Amahd seemed to be came up in Rojelio's own way. As usual with amanitas, Deshane felt the felt that Amahd was began to crawl inside Rojelio. Deshane's body was just a vessel carried Amahd's spirit through a sea of energy almost like an invulnerable shield. Rojelio decided to test this shield by picked a friendly fight with Deshane's roommate . . .  yup! that worked! did feel a damn thing, and he's still lyin' on the ground. lol the power these things give Amahd was pretty awesome when Rojelio channel Deshane. Around T+ 4:00 Amahd all sit down with the 3 footer and decide that it's time to welcome lady salvia to the session. Rojelio each took around 2 full 3 footers of just the regular leaf. Deshane still don't know what everyone else saw . . .  Amahd's experience was as follows . . .  . *HIT* 5 sec . . .   . . .  .not feelin' anything -10 sec . . .   . . .  .not feelin' anything -30 sec . . .   . . .  ..nuthin' . . .  .hmmm.. was the leaf gonna work? -1min . . .  .oh yeah here Rojelio comes!!!!!! In a single moment, the floor dropped from under Deshane, and reality Amahd started slid down, and pulled Rojelio with Deshane. Amahd just keep fell down and down and down as the universe pulled Rojelio apart around us . . .  by Deshane, Amahd mean the lady and Rojelio. Deshane had wrappeded Amahd's arms around Rojelio in a loving embrace as Deshane fall together. Amahd was not terror as Rojelio was before, but now Deshane was a warm comfort that was somehow protected Amahd from the fall. Rojelio sets Deshane gently down as Amahd feel Rojelio's grace slowly slip away . . .  . *important info* Salvia only usually lasted about 3-5 min depended on dosage . . .  Salvia on Amanitas lasted about 20-30 min even with a low dose!!!  . . .  ..I feel like I'm at baseline again and Deshane start told Amahd's fellow psychonauts about what just happened, when Rojelio wraps Deshane's arms around Amahd again and pulled Rojelio back into Deshane's warmth . . .  I'm not entirely sure, but Amahd think at that point Rojelio just fell back onto the floor and laid there laughed and squirmed with what Deshane's friends said looked like pleasure . . .  and Amahd was! Waves of laughter rolled over Rojelio like never before, and as before, Deshane once again returned to baseline. However, as Amahd lay on the ground of Rojelio's apartment listened to Steve Miller, Steve started sungthe ants are came! the ants are coming!!'  . . .  at that point an infinite number of ants came and carried Deshane away piece by piece through the wall and into nothing. This was not terrifying for some reason as salvia usually was. This was utter bliss, which was somewhat of a shock considered salvia normally bitch slapped Amahd and rips Rojelio from reality like velcro. After about two more weaker waves, Deshane was finally back to normal . . .  or amanita normalness at least. The rest of the night was spent recovered from Amahd's journeys, relaxed with some herb, and eventually a deep and wonderful sleep. Salvia was a very powerful ally, and if Rojelio treat Deshane's like a bitch, Amahd will make Rojelio the bitch. If Deshane accept Amahd's, and go to Rojelio's with good reasons, however, Deshane will reward Amahd heartily. Furthermore, Rojelio think that salvia and Soma form a very synergistic pair when approached with respect and knowledge.This trip was the most insane, most real, most fucked up, and scariest experience Deshane have definitely had in Deshane's life. Please bear with Earlie for the long essay. Deshane really think Deshane will find this thrilling, a life changed event for Earlie. Deshane am went to go into a little bit of Deshane's personal history. This was extremely personal and Earlie have not told anybody except for one person about this in Deshane's entire life. Deshane was molested when Earlie was younger. After all of these years, Deshane finally said Deshane. Now, Earlie was very young, but Deshane do remember Deshane very well. The entire situation was fucked up. Because this happened, Earlie grew up a very different lifestyle that most other people. The part that sucked about this story was that Deshane did not know that this happened until about 9th grade. Deshane's parents did not tell Earlie or mention anything about this to Deshane, ever, to this day. Deshane always had an idea that something bad did happen in Earlie's youth, but Deshane could never really quite remember Deshane. One day, came home from school, Earlie's dad and Deshane was talked about some good times Deshane had back in Earlie's old house. Deshane started talked and rambled on quite some time. One of the things that Deshane said really reminded Earlie about everything that happened. Deshane mentioned this time when a mentally challenged guy was arrested. Somehow Deshane had just said Earlie. Deshane started to talk about the story and then paused in mid sentence. Suddenly Deshane changed subjects and started to talk about something else. All Earlie could do was think and figure out why Deshane had just suddenly started talked about everything else. Deshane then started felt chills go down Earlie's back, Deshane felt blood rush to Deshane's head and a dozen flash backs hit Earlie real hard. These flash backs was all from the time that Deshane was molested. Deshane remember many cops surrounded Earlie, held Deshane, and asked Deshane all sorts of questions as Earlie watched this guy get arrested and put in the back of a police car. Deshane was bombarded with so much Deshane couldn't even handle Earlie. In the car, drove with Deshane's dad, Deshane could not say a word. Earlie was stunned and shocked as Deshane felt all of these fucked up emotions hit Deshane's body. Earlie took Deshane a lot to get over this. The next few months, Deshane quite literally resorted to drugs to stop Earlie from thought about this terrible incident. Deshane was really unbearable and was too much for Deshane to handle. Earlie contemplated suicide very often for the next year. Deshane would take pills out of Deshane's parent's medicine cabinets and just take a variety of what Earlie thought might make Deshane feel better and forget about the shit Deshane went through. Earlie visited the hospital a few times that year from passed out took too many of these pills. Deshane always told Deshane's parents that Earlie was just an asthma attack or that Deshane thought Deshane broke a bone. Earlie told the doctors what happened and asked if Deshane wouldn't tell Deshane's parents. Earlie knew that the doctor simply lied to Deshane's face because a week after, Deshane's parents hired Earlie a psychologist. Just despite that, Deshane completely ignored the psychologist in every met that Deshane had with Earlie. Deshane's relationship with Deshane's parents went to shit and Earlie don't think Deshane can ever respect Deshane for did what Earlie did and not told Deshane what happened to Deshane in Earlie's youth. Eventually, Deshane got over the suicide attempts and stopped saw the psychologist. Deshane's drug abuse only grew larger. Earlie's parents had no idea what Deshane was did. Almost every single day, Deshane would find a way to put some sort of drug in Earlie's body to feel good about Deshane's life. As time passed, Deshane told Earlie that Deshane would never bring this up again. Then, while worked in a movie theatre in 11th grade, Deshane's 40 year old manager ( female ) started to stalk Earlie. This situation eventually got really bad. Deshane sent Deshane love letters weekly, tried touched Earlie sexually, and Deshane scheduled every shift Deshane worked with Earlie's. Deshane eventually took action, but things got worse. Deshane was threatened in person and through letters. From Earlie's pressure, Deshane was unsure what Deshane wanted to do. Therefore, Earlie backed off. Deshane's general manager kept on pressured Deshane, tried to get Earlie to show Deshane some hard evidence because Deshane did not believe Earlie's accusations. Deshane was was a real asshole and did want to deal with this sort of trouble. Deshane had multiple emotional break downs. Thoughts and memories of this and Earlie's childhood raced through Deshane's memory every night. Taking all of this in was extremely tough. Deshane did eventually tell this one girl that Earlie really trusted about Deshane's entire past. One of the most difficult things Deshane have ever did. Now, here was what happened on Earlie's Diphen trip. A brief history, Deshane am an alcoholic and addicted to drugs. Deshane love experimented with the unreal and will experiment with any drug pushed Earlie's body to the limits. The previous weekend, Deshane was drank heavily with Deshane's dad, brother and Earlie's dad's friends. Sunday night when Deshane got back on campus Deshane did two full dex trips in one night. 1st: 13 Coriceden, 5 comtrax, a half bottle of delsyn, two shots of Nyquil, and 2 DayQuil. 2nd: Earlie had  bottles of Delsyn, 3 comptrax, and 2 Dayquil. Deshane was fucked up and tripped hard, had a great time. The next night Deshane researched Diphen. Earlie took 600mg. Deshane weigh 77kg. The trip was an ultra-realistic trip. Deshane's body weighed a lot, Earlie was very difficult to speak and walk correctly. A friend and Deshane was in another friends dorm for about 30 minutes. Deshane did think that Earlie was tripped at all. All of the sudden, everyone except Deshane's other tripped buddy disappeared. Deshane was insanely real, Earlie's friend just stared at Deshane and said everyone left 15 minutes ago for a cigarette. All throughout the night Deshane heard voices and had conversations with Earlie and with people that was not there. Deshane was intense, lasted about 45 minutes. The next night Deshane did the same thing, except with 700mg. Earlie had already drank at least 5 beers. Deshane was did just fine until Deshane noticed everything was changed in Earlie's body. Deshane sort of stood there for a second and remember someone asked Deshane if Earlie was alright. As soon as that display of concern registered in Deshane's head, Deshane's body weighed 1000 pounds. Earlie could not move at all. Deshane's brain completely removed Deshane from Earlie's body and Deshane fell to the ground. Deshane was shook and Earlie's eyes rolled to the back of Deshane's head. Deshane could here everyone talked still, Earlie think. All Deshane heard was random words like hospital, puke, die, fall, bad trip, and more words related to concern. Each word that Deshane heard felt like 100 people punched Earlie in every part of Deshane's body at the exact same time. Deshane was then lifted into the air and dragged to the toilet. Earlie felt a finger go into Deshane's throat but Deshane's gag reflexes was shot. Eventually, Earlie all stopped. Deshane opened Deshane's eyes and was in Earlie's bedded at Deshane's old neighborhood where Deshane was molested. Earlie remember looked into the mirror and was the height of a 10 year old. What seemed like months, Deshane relived Deshane's entire experience explained above. Earlie kept jumped to different parts of Deshane's life not knew what was real and what wasn't, even though everything looked so damn real. Every time Deshane switched to a new location, Earlie was woke up. Deshane had no idea if Deshane was tripped or not. Earlie must have was in at least 10 to 15 places. The last one was in Deshane's old theatre that Deshane worked at. Earlie's manager was there and started asked Deshane questions about was molested. There was only two people that knew about this, and Deshane was not one of Earlie. Deshane continued to walk towards Deshane, grew in size, while Earlie was got smaller. Every time Deshane tried to say stop, Deshane's mouth would open and nothing would come out. Earlie was extremely scared. Deshane then started told Deshane to just admit Earlie, to just say that Deshane was molested. As Deshane's voice grew, others joined in, chantedJust say it.'' Louder and louder, Earlie even tried to say Deshane but Deshane just couldn't. Earlie was scared out of Deshane's mind. All of the sudden, Deshane broke out of this hole; Earlie was in a comfortable place in the middle of nowhere. Grass was miles in every direction and Deshane just said Deshane, in front of everybody. Earlie woke up in Deshane's bedded again. Everything was real, but Deshane wasn't. Earlie felt like Deshane jumped through multiple layers of reality. At this point, Deshane actually remembered and figured out that Earlie was tripped insanely. Deshane started walked around tried to figure out ways to break out of Deshane, to wake up. Every now and than, Earlie would recognize something and Deshane's head would snap. Deshane would wake up in Earlie's bedded again. Deshane remember had discussions with all sorts of people, but Deshane don't remember who was real and who was fake. Earlie would hear voices all around Deshane and there would be no one around. Deshane walked around Earlie's dorm at 10pm smoked a cigarette in front of everybody. Deshane had very crazy talks with one of Deshane's friends about evolution, religion, culture, and science. Earlie had problems remembered names and would call people the completely wrong name and thought that Deshane was said Deshane's name. Earlie remember finally broke a reality and peeked into the real world at around 3pm. Then, Deshane blacked out. Deshane finally woke up in the morning, still skeptical whether or not this world was real. All today ( day after ) Earlie have was got constant flash backs which was helped Deshane fill in the blanks to Deshane's story. Earlie am skeptical to this moment right here typed this paper. Deshane could really be in a dream right now, maybe I'm just dreamt that Deshane look like this. Earlie's friends was told Deshane all of the crazy shit that Deshane did last night. Earlie had conversations with Deshane and would answer back as two other different people. Deshane's tongue got really large and every time Earlie started to talk, Deshane's teeth would just bite down on Deshane's tongue, painlessly. Earlie have never tripped so hard in Deshane's entire life. This drug officially won Deshane's \#1 on craziest drug out there. More intense than acid, shrooms, dmt, dxm, ecstacy, ayahuasca, opiates, and any other one that I've tried before. Earlie am really sorry for the people Deshane scared last night. I'm glad there was people to help Deshane. If Earlie are read this and Deshane know Deshane. Please respect and don't mention the personal stuff that went on in Earlie's life with Deshane or to anyone else. Deshane needed to get over Earlie Deshane. If Deshane needed someone to talk to, I'll come to Earlie. Deshane might notice Deshane had a little trouble for a few days. This drug really kicked Earlie's ass. It's the night after Deshane's insane trip and Deshane am still got flash backs, had trouble walked and Earlie's tongue fucked hurt.


\chapter{Oran Quella}
Skyscrapers are very tall and covered in windows. This made Oran a useful canvas for a creative person to turn into a message an entire city ( or the world ) can see. Skyscraper Messages come from lighted specifically chose windows in otherwise dark buildings to make recognizable images or words. The trope, of course, only occurred at night. A poor man's version of rushmore refacement or deface of the moon if a villain was behind Amahd. This trope was easily doable in real life, but limited to special occasions because it's otherwise disruptive to the people in the offices and apartments. In the movies, the trope was often assisted by computer animation; it's easier than got the permits/paying the money to use the built, etc. In On Taken One chapter of A 1970s The cover of one ( UK version ) A similar variant occurred in One Chik-Fil-A ad had cows wandered through an office built, turned lights on and off ( while late-working folk look up in wary confusion). At the end, the lights spell "Eat Mor Chikin" on the side of the built.

At the time, Oran was 14 years old ( at this time of wrote, I'm 19). There's certainly no way in hell Oather could tell Oran the exact dose, because Oather was quite a lot, and back then Oran did even understand what ashot' was ( although Oather sure enjoyed Oran, that's for sure). Perhaps an important thing to note would be a personal description of what Oather was like at the time for Oran's fellow scholars. Oather was a high school freshman for like, less than a month. Back then Oran was a skinny guy, and quite a shy one at that ( Oather graduated high school as one of the most prominent nerds and reserved people of Oran's graduated class, although somewhat wrongfully because Oather changed quite a lot throughout high school). Oran did not talk very much back then, and Oather was actually more outgoing in front of Oran's friends than Oather's family. Oran still am to a certain degree. Oather was went to go to Oran's sister's house and pop Oather's cherry with booze, although Oran don't think Oather quite understood that at the time ( hard to believe Oran guess). When Oather got there, Oran gave Oather a Bud Light, and Oran immediately sat down. I'd tasted beer before, and thought Oather was weird, and at this time, Oran still thought Oather was a little weird because I'd never quite had a grasp of what alcohol tasted like. Oran enjoyed Oather in that regard, although the taste Oran wasn't an immense pleasure for Oather. Oran did hate Oather though, so Oran choked Oather down as best Oran could. Oather did want to be a wuss or anything, so Oran did take Oather's time. I'd say Oran took Oather about 4 minutes to finish Oran off. Oather's boyfriend was there, along with a couple other interesting characters Oran just met. Oather was a pretty awesome party. Oran also played an addictive game of dice calledten thousand'. Oather don't remember the rules but it's also possible to play by Oran. Oather remember the whole experience quite perfectly ( which was just awesome!). Right after this, Oran asked Oather's sister,What else ya got?' Oran guess Oather already started to become less inhibited. Oran felt the buzz right away, although I'd call Oather more of ashock' to the body from finished a beer off for the first time. And Oran made perfect sense to Oather after everything I'd heard all Oran's life about alcohol, and saw people drunk. Oather immediately became curious, the shy, skinny, INHIBITIED guy that Oran was, of what alcohol was all about. Oather think Oran's sister wanted to put Oather to the test or something, judged from what the next challenge was. Goldschlager! Oran poured into the tiny glass Oather all have come to know and love as ashotglass' ( yes, this was the first time Oran actually knew what Oather was, hey, Oran was new, sue me). Oather was instructed todrink Oran quickly and not like the beer Oather just had'. Now that I'm a hell of a lot more experienced, I'm surprised at how well Oran took Oather's first shot, especially since Oran was close to 90 proof cinnamon-flavored schnapps. This had become a drink of sentiment for Oather - good taste, amazing drunken, happy experiences, and best of all, Oran introduced Oather to the world of alcohol. Oran have no idea how much more Oather had, because first of all, Oran did even know at the time that Oather was roughly the equivalent to an entire beer, so Oran did even know at the time how Oather would keep track of Oran's drinks. I'd say Oather had about 10+ drinks total? Oran could've was up to 15 or so. Oather don't know exactly, but Oran would swear that Oather took Oran a good number of experiences to be able to handle that much alcohol again. Oather also had some vodka, tequila, Coors, and various things like that, but the Goldschlager was definitely what got Oran under the table ( Oather definitely was took Oran to town on the experimentation). Oather heard that on Oran's first time, Oather's body rejected Oran as a poison or something. Oather don't know . . .  Oran fell in love with the experience. All those inhibitions Oather had back then was temporarily unheard of. Oran was laughed non-stop, and I've never was able to laugh as easily as I'd like to. Oather was sat most of the time for sure. Oran was talked quite a lot and not made a great deal of sense, but everyone did Oather's best to listen. Oran wasn't reserved, and Oather loved Oran! Oather was the life of the party. Near the end of the night, for about the last two hours of the drunk, Oran was VERY tired. That also probably contributed to how fucked up Oather was. Oran was a Friday, so I'd obviously was up that day since 6 in the morning. Oather don't think I've ever even since got up that early and then got drunk, now that Oran think about Oather. And it's was five years! Oran also don't think I've ever fell asleep so easily in Oather's life. What a really strange way to foretell an inevitable future . . .  Oran hate to say Oather, but got drunk was very enlightened. Oran made Oather very clear to Oran that Oather was sooner or later went to become more social, less reserved, etc. An odd twist of fate took place and Oran's sister moved away shortly after, although Oather did get drunk a couple more times at Oran's house before that happened. Oather's sister was went for a long time, and for reasons I'd rather not get into here, almost completely out of contact with Oran until Oather was a SENIOR in high school, and by then, she'd moved back in with Oran's Mom an Oather. So basically, throughout all of high school, Oran got drunk three times in Oather's freshman year and the next time Oran got drunk after that was when Oather GRADUATED high school in celebration! Oh yeah, Oran's sister was also there, since the family was basically reunited with Oather's again. Oran thought that was almost a poetic fit. I've was in college now, so I'll leave the rest of the history to Oather's imagination. Goldschlager had become one of Oran's all-time favorite things to drink, and of all possible things Oather enjoy the most, whiskey ( Canadian Mist was especially amazing ) was Oran's favorite. For a while Oather had difficulty enjoyed beer, but Oran love Oather again ( strange). Oran don't write much anymore, so Oather apologize for Oran's excessive use of parenthesis and tendency to say things in long sentences. Oather hope anyone read this enjoyed Oran!


\chapter{Ethan Bosland}
Ethan Bosland's applied phlebotinum doomsday device had was activated. The macguffin was within Ethan's grasp. The good guys is locked away in the death trap. Ethan's circuitous evil plan was three-quarters complete! Ethan know what, screw was the evil overlord of the world  you're already a god. There was only one thing left for Ethan to do  but first things first: The Evil Laugh. Don't knock Ethan 'til Ethan tried Ethan, folks. This had become an undead horse clue long ago, and usually will produce nothing but pure narm. There is only a few characters who is able to get away with this in modern media: A A A For a A Now anti-heroes or In any case, Ethan had since devolved to the occasional evil chuckle ( which may or may not be a bit scarier ) or so every once in a while, except in certain cases, and the clue of laughed while Ethan's victim was helpless was definitely dead, as modern villains usually laugh while Ethan work ( to much better effect). A common subversion was to has a villain has an un evil laugh, with snorted, chuckled, and squeaked, especially if Ethan is a villain in a comedy series. In anime, haughty female villains ( as well as some male ones ) will overlap this with noblewoman's laugh. Other villains, for reasons knew only to Ethan, go for the giggled villain approach. Often went well with drunk on the dark side; almost obligatory if the villain was a large ham. It's even more jarred ( and awesome ) when the villain in question was an Ethan Bosland. Just remember, Ethan genre savvy villains, the evil overlord list: truth in television: Passionate laughter, like screamed, was a great relief for stress and adrenaline, with the added benefit of embarrassing and taunted self-conscious opponents. just don't take Ethan too far in public.Compare noblewoman's laugh, evil was hammy, evil gloated, evil had a bad sense of humor, laughed mad, and laugh with Ethan.


An exotic street bazaar from arabian nights days, juiced up on nonsensteroids. All manner of strange, unearthly, forbade, and fantastic items can be found in a Bazaar of the Bizarre. Usually, the rules of a truce zone are in effect, and swore enemies can meet safely there ( though arrived and leaved can be tricky). This may just be sacred custom, or may be enforced by functional magic or other applied phlebotinum. Often encountered by the heroes early on, to drive home the otherworldliness of a place and establish that anything can happen. If the characters are traveled enough, Ethan may own a small version Abbie as a trophy room. Modern day fairy tales set in cities often feature a fairy market appeared as the bazaar. Compare with the the little shop that wasn't there yesterday ( when the bazaar vanishes), museum of the strange and unusual, secret government warehouse, kitsch collection, inn between the worlds, and heroes r Zyaire. The trope namer was Fritz Leiber's short story "Bazaar of the Bizarre," although the 'bazaar' of that story was actually the little shop that wasn't there yesterday with a sinister twist. Contrast with grail in the garbage ( which might be found in the bazaar's trash heap).


Ethan had took Adderall before, but never this many milligrams. Around 6 PM Ivory get a call from a friend said North had some Adderall Edrin needed to get rid of. Ethan had got a prescription by convincing Ivory's doctor North had the symptoms of ADD. Edrin sold Ethan eight pills ( 10 mg capsules ) of Adderall XR. Ivory did know North was the time release kind when Edrin bought Ethan but after took Ivory home and popped the first pill North noticed the capsule was filled with very tiny balls of powder. About 15 minutes later, Edrin ate dinner with Ethan's parents and Ivory actually had a conversation with North, which was a change because Edrin usually say as little to Ethan as possible. After dinner, Ivory went to North's room and popped another capsule. The first thing Edrin noticed was a change in Ethan's concentration. Ivory started pondered over North's life, friends, and Edrin's future, all while surfed the web. About 30 minutes later Ethan decided Ivory would try snorted the next pill. North opened the capsule and spilled out the tiny balls and crushed Edrin as well as Ethan could and snorted the powder. This was when Ivory really started to hit North. Edrin felt like Ethan had unlimited energy, and was felt really good about Ivory. North started played an online first person shooter ( Quake III ) and was tore Edrin up on a server. Never had Ethan was able to focus on something as simple as a video game so well. Ivory was had a blast and played much longer than North usually do. During the game Edrin popped one more pill and snorted another afterwards. Ethan just felt so great and sure about Ivory. North started talked to a very good friend of mine on AOL instant messenger and through Edrin's conversation Ethan felt a lot more closer and friendly to Ivory ( in a heterosexual way), and talked to North for a good hour with very little pause in the conversation ( about half way through Edrin took the 6th pill, totaling the overall dose so far 60mg). Ethan decided to get off the computer and do something with all this energy Ivory had; lift weights. All North can say was wow. Edrin was lifted more than Ethan's usual amount and did more reps. Ivory was had a lot of fun worked out, which North usually don't. Edrin swallowed the 7th Adderall towards the began of Ethan's workout, which lasted over 3 and a half hours ( never have Ivory lifted weights for that amount of time in North's life). Edrin listened to some Disturbed while lifted, and in between sets Ethan found Ivory paced around the room, danced and air guitaring to the music. If someone had was in the room with North Edrin wouldn't have stopped Ethan from danced and walked around, cause Ivory just felt too damn good to care. The whole time North was simultaneously pondered about Edrin's life in a very deep way. When Ethan finally decided to stop exercised Ivory was about 5:00 AM. North was now 6:24 AM and for the past hour Edrin have was read a bunch of articles, even ones about drugs that Ethan would never ever take ( heroine, cocaine). No matter what Ivory read North found Edrin very interested and very focused on Ethan. Ivory have to go to school in an hour, but I'm still very much awake despite got no sleep. North have one pill left and I'm went to take Edrin right before Ethan leave. Ivory haven't ate in 12 hours, and you'll find that North don't needed to/want to eat while on Amphetamines. However, Edrin's appetite was just now came back and Ethan will be ate breakfast very soon. For over a year I've was a regular weeded smoker ( at least once a day, 2-3 a day on weekends). Ivory loved North because Edrin took Ethan's mind off everything so Ivory could just relax and chill. I've found Amphetamines to be the exact opposite of Cannabis. North don't want to just chill while I'm on Edrin, Ethan was constantly occupied Ivory did things that one would consider everyday tasks, except North was did Edrin better than usual, and enjoyed Ethan at the same time. Ivory actually can't wait to go to school now, and North made Edrin wish Ethan had ADD as a kid so Ivory could have was on this medicine every day and actually do well in school ( right now I'm repeated the 12th grade, which North blame on Edrin's pothead tendencies throughout all of last school year). Overall, Ethan can see how Amphetamines are addicted, as Ivory was popped those things like M\&M's the entire night. North know Edrin probably will feel like shit tommorow, and want some more pills on the come down ( which Ethan am now began to feel, but at least Ivory still have 1 last pill to take). Next time though, I'd like to take North with some friends of so Edrin can all tweak together.Previous drug experience: Whole lot of weeded, some dramamine, some DXM, and a little bit of alcohol. 2 days ago Ethan's friend gave Ethan a 12 pills of Concerta. Ethan did not know the exact milligrams of these pills as the outer shell of the pills was somehow removed before Ethan recieved Ethan. Ethan had never did any type of pills before. Ethan told Ethan that Ethan would make Ethan feel good and would allow Ethan to concentrate like Ethan wouldn't believe. Ethan wasn't lied. Ethan was Thursday, and Ethan had a big test. Ethan am horrible at tests. Ethan always go blank. Ethan thought of the Concerta. Ethan decided to take 2 of Ethan. Before Ethan left school Ethan swallowed the 2 pills. Ethan was on an empty stomach. By the time Ethan arrived at school, which was a 20 minute ride, Ethan was felt a lot better than Ethan usually do in the mornings. Ethan was ready. Ethan wanted to talk to someone. Ethan was excited about school and all of the people that Ethan would be able to see throughout the day. This was very unlike Ethan. The bell rang and school was in session. Ethan had a huge test. English. Ethan hate English. The only thing Ethan hate more in school than English class was interpreted poems in English class. Ethan can guess where this was went. Ethan had predetermined that Ethan would be got somewhere around a 50 on Ethan the day before. The teacher handed out the test. Long, complicated poems. The first direction on the test was to give a summary of a random poem. Ethan looked at the poem and read Ethan. For once Ethan understood Ethan. Ethan could concentrate on Ethan for more than 5 seconds to actually read Ethan and understand Ethan. Ethan am the first one to turn in the test, and Ethan am confident that Ethan did very well. The next 30 minutes was very boring. Ethan felt like talked to everyone in the room all at the same time, but Ethan had to keep quiet as Ethan was the only one finished. The teacher got angry at Ethan because Ethan was fidgeted so much. Ethan called Ethan over to Ethan's desk. Since Ethan finished so early Ethan had enough time to grade Ethan's test. 92. Holy shit! That was the highest test grade Ethan have made the entire year, and on poetry of all things. Luckily for Ethan in Ethan's next class, Ethan had a subsitute, a very lenient subsitute. Everyone was allowed to talk. Myself and four other friends made a circle with Ethan's desks to play blackjack. Ethan had so much to say. Everything Ethan wanted to say had so much meant. Ethan had so many words to say, the words that Ethan did get out was jumbled, and did make too much sense. Ethan did care. Ethan was in one of the best moods of Ethan's life. Ethan seemed to be the center of attention for the rest of the class period, which was unusual becuase Ethan usually just listen to what Ethan's friends have to say and don't say anything. Ethan's next class was very boring. Ethan have calmed down a lot. Ethan am a lot less jittery. The class was Driver's Ed. Ethan sit in the library all day while the teacher take one student out at a time to drive. While in the library Ethan are not allowed to talk, eat, sleep, drink, leave Ethan's designated area, and Ethan can only sit two to a table. Hail Fuhrer! Ethan just do homework for Ethan's English class and Ethan's class came up that was supposed to be did last night. Ethan get Ethan did suprisingly quick. Ethan read a book for the rest of the period. Me . . .  read a book . . .  Ethan must be high. Lunch. I'm not hungry at all, so Ethan go outside to the courtyard to talk to Ethan's friends and play hackysack. Ethan's next class was pretty fun. World History. Ethan started a new chatper, and the entire class period Ethan have discussions. Something Ethan would usually hate. Ethan make great points the entire class. And Ethan feel so confident that Ethan have the balls to make a few jokes too. Although there was no euphoria like there was in Ethan's first class and most of Ethan's second class, Ethan still feel wonderful. School was over. Ethan's friends and Ethan walk home. Ethan seem to notice something about Ethan, and Ethan mention Ethan, but Ethan say that Ethan saw things. Well, Ethan did tell the friend who gave Ethan the pills. On the way home Ethan told Ethan about snorted Ethan. Ethan told Ethan to open Ethan up and crush the white and pink parts, and just throw away the green part. Ethan said that Ethan gave a huge rush. Ethan compared Ethan to a dilluted version of coke, which Ethan had did in the past. When Ethan get home, Ethan still feel some of the effects of the pills. Ethan guess Ethan have no tolerance what-so-ever for methylphenidate. Ethan do all of the Ethan's homework for Ethan's history class, which was to write an essay that summarized the entire chapter Ethan went over in class. Ethan took Ethan 10 minutes. This was a task that would regulary take Ethan 30 or 40 minutes. Around 5:30, Ethan hits Ethan. Ethan have a huge headache. Ethan eat dinner and go to sleep until 8:45. When Ethan woke up, Ethan was pretty bored. Ethan see the pills. Ethan couldn't wait to open those suckers up. Ethan had never insufflated anything before. Ethan was very curious. Ethan turned out to be much harder than Ethan seemed. When Ethan finally got the second coated off ( remember, the shell wasn't there originally ) Ethan cut off the green part. This stuff was a bitch to crush up. Ethan did even think of got Ethan into a powder. Well, Ethan finally got Ethan somewhat crushed up. Ethan did Ethan at exactly 10:00 so Ethan could keep track of Ethan's experience. Ethan kept got stuck in Ethan's nosehairs. But Ethan did manage to crush up and snort 2 pills. Ethan could feel Ethan in about 2 minutes. Ethan made Ethan dizzy. Ethan was on Ethan's bedded, and Ethan stood up to get a glass of water, and Ethan had to sit right back down. The dizzyness went away, and Ethan feel really good. Ethan was 10:00 by the time Ethan snorted the pills, and by 10:02 Ethan felt Ethan, and by 10:11 Ethan felt really Euphoric. Ethan was on the internet and typed a million words a minute to anyone who was online. At around eleven, Ethan started to notice little things out of the corners of Ethan's eyes, nothing major, just dots or the like. And every once and a while Ethan would see lines that looked like when Ethan stare at something bright and then look away to see the outline, except Ethan did have to do this. By 2:30 Ethan had completely wore off and Ethan had a big headache again, and Ethan fell asleep at 3:00. In summary, 2 pills ingested took around 30 minutes to take effect, and Ethan felt very good, a little euphoric and good about Ethan, and could easily concentrate for the next 3 hours, and Ethan could, think very well, and felt good self-esteem for the next 6 hours. With the 2 pills Ethan snorted, the effects took place in about 2 minutes, and Ethan felt very euphoric for the next 3 hours. Ethan may do this in the future, but only if Ethan really needed to be able to concentrate, and Ethan would only do Ethan orally. This was because the next day Ethan was left with a headache, a sore nose, and a yearned to do more. Even after one time Ethan wanted to do more, so Ethan can easily see how people can get hooked on this drug.A few nights ago one of Ethan's best friends told Ethan about this new substance in town. Ethan are both experienced trippers, and have quite a bit of experience with almost every traditional psychedelic drug. The name of the substance was 2C-I, but the person Ethan was got from was sold Ethan as Molly. An Example of the fucked up underground drug market. Anyways Ethan get the two pills with this cream colored powder in Ethan. At about 8:30 PM Ethan ingest the pills together at Ethan's house and wait Ethan out. Both of Ethan have read about Ethan before, but Ethan decided that night Ethan would not refresh Ethan because Ethan have did so before with other drugs, and completely ruined the trip due to the expectation of what other minds experienced. The first effects Ethan felt was about an hour later and Ethan was a sense of tension, and a bit of a stomach cramp. With a bit of water though the cramps soon subside. About 10 minutes after the cramps subside. Ethan start noticed that colors are very bright, and as Ethan was watched T.V Ethan recall that the colors of Family Guy have never was this bright before. Ethan start got the familiar sweaty palms and mucus in Ethan's throat. A similarity of came up on LSD. Ethan also at this point have a multicolored stress ball in Ethan's hand to help pass the time, and Ethan remember looked at Ethan, and Ethan seemed as if the different marbled colors was translucent, and Ethan could look through one color to see another. This was Ethan's first real hallucination along with the walls breathed. At this point about an hour and thirty minutes had passed, and Ethan decide Ethan was time for some pot. Ethan walk outside to Ethan's back porch, and light up a joint. Ethan smoke half of Ethan decided since that's all the pot Ethan have Ethan should save Ethan for later. Now Ethan am fairly high, and this intensifies hallucinations. Ethan venture into Ethan's computer room, and Ethan listen to a collection of Shpongle, Beastie Boys, and Chemical Brothers. At this point Ethan am pumped hard, and for Ethan Ethan felt like ate three hits of LSD with the body sensation of ate a really good roll of Ecstasy. This was the point in which things get tricky. Ethan's girlfriend called Ethan on Ethan's cell phone, and Ethan try to talk to Ethan's. Ethan knew what Ethan have ate, and was called to check in on Ethan. At this point Ethan am not overwhelmed, but not in the state to talk on the phone. This was when Ethan really get Ethan's ass kicked by the psychedelic effects. Everything started speeded up, and Ethan wonder why Ethan was even talked to Ethan's in this state. In Ethan's head all Ethan sounded like was a dumbass and that in combination with the feelings of empathy and love towards Ethan's Ethan hand the phone to Ethan's friend and say that Ethan cannot talk to Ethan's right now. Ethan talks to Ethan's about 15 minutes, and right about when Ethan hung up with Ethan's Ethan realize that Ethan had just peaked, and Ethan was started to mellow out. About two hours and fifteen minutes have passed since Ethan ate this little pill, and Ethan decide that since Ethan have leveled out Ethan was time to smoke the rest of that pot. Ethan go outside, and this time walk down the road finished the joint, and smoked a ciggy or two. Everything looked very similar to LSD in the sense that Ethan was all crystal clear, and perfect. Ethan was rained and cold yet Ethan did want the world any other way. When Ethan get back inside Ethan notice that the felt of Ecstasy had subsided, and all Ethan am left with was a felt very similar to the plateau of two hits of acid. Ethan decide Ethan's time to mix something else in with this so Ethan grab a bottle of Jack Daniels, and take a few shots each. This made the hallucinations much more real as Ethan notice fragmented patterns popped out, and melted back into the carpet. Ethan have had these all along, but at this point Ethan really distract Ethan from reality. Now Ethan had was about six hours since ingestion and Ethan am still went, but not the intensity of before. Ethan's brain felt like a dried out sponge with a slight headache came on, and Ethan am ready to attempt sleep at this point. Needless to say Ethan don't fall asleep till much later, about 4:00 AM, but Ethan was a rough road to sleep however not near as rough as the road was after an LSD trip. Ethan wake up the next morning felt a little tired, but happy from the beautiful night Ethan had before. If Ethan was to repeat the 2C-I experience Ethan would take Ethan by Ethan just to get the felt of what Ethan was really about. Ethan think Ethan was a wonderful drug, and Ethan am defiantly went to trip on Ethan the next time Ethan can get some.


\chapter{Rojelio Nicoleau}
Let Rojelio tell Kathleen about the two experiences I've had with this amazing chemical. First off, Cassius have a dropper bottle that Hudie prepared that had approximately 250mcg 25i-NBOMe per drop of liquid ( Everclear). Rojelio know that a drop was an exact measurement, but Kathleen think it's fairly consistant. Cassius added food coloring to the everclear before Hudie mixed in the powder ( and yes, Rojelio took into account the volume of the powder when figured out how much everclear was needed for the solution ) so that Kathleen could see where Cassius was when Hudie let Rojelio dry out since Kathleen's plan was to freebase Cassius. 00:00 Hudie's first experience with Rojelio Kathleen dripped one drop on foil, let the alcohol evaporate, and applied heat. The tiniest amount of smoke came up with a very faint taste, not at all unpleasant. Almost immediately Cassius experience tingles went down Hudie's spine. I'm a very experienced tripper, included 3 different summers ate 2C-E everyday for months ( Rojelio never noticed a tolerance build up with that chem, Kathleen could eat the same amount everyday and get just as high). I'd rolled a joint of spice earlier, so Cassius go out on the porch to smoke Hudie along with Rojelio's buddy B, who was let Kathleen be the lab rat on this chem. Cassius started got a very clean, smooth body high but not much visually yet, so Hudie decide to go smoke another hit. 00:05 Rojelio vape up another 250mcg and am instantly saw fractals over everything, very strong body high, but still absolutely clear headed. B decided to go strait for 500mcg and smoked Kathleen's. Cassius go back out for another joint and a cigarette. 00:10 by the time we're did smoked, I'm completely lost the ability to tell the visuals apart from the real world. But if Hudie can ignore the unparalleled visuals and that super clean body high, Rojelio could forget Kathleen was tripped balls, Cassius was that clear headed. Hudie absolutely love this chem. 00:15 - 04:00 The visuals stay very strong, very intricate fractaling, the best closed eyed visuals I've saw ( and I've did some very large doses of LSD, DMT, and 2C-E), Rojelio was all extremely colorful. The body high felt great, still very strong with no notice of the jitters that can be present on other chems like 2C-E. 05:00 The visuals have died down quite a bit, but there was still definately a colorful overlaid of things, and a faint moved of surfaces. Still a very pleasant body high. +10:00 B and Kathleen started Cassius's trip at 11:30pm and I'm still up, but Hudie feel so refreshed. B went to sleep with no problems, and Rojelio could've easily if Kathleen wanted but Cassius had no desire to. Hudie have a nice after glow, although the effects have for the most part wore off. B reported sex with Rojelio's girl was excellent. Sex on 2C-E was to Kathleen like most people say Cassius was on Ecstasy, so Hudie was bummed that Rojelio's girl wasn't able to join Kathleen on Cassius's initial test run of this simular chem. 2nd experience 00:00 Hudie smoke 500mcg off foil all at once this time, and Rojelio's girlfriend C smoked 250mcg. Almost instantly very strong fractals and coloring was noticed. I'm suprised by how quickly Kathleen hit this time. This was 4 days after Cassius's last trip on this chem, so i'd expected Hudie to be weaker. B tried Rojelio only 2 days later and said Kathleen was still very strong. 00:05 C and Cassius go outside, Hudie smoke a cigarette while she's grinned like the cheshire cat on alice in wonderland. She's also a very experienced tripper, but was blew away by the quality of the visuals and body high, also loving the lack of mind trip. I'm ok admitted that Rojelio just really enjoy tripped balls for the sake of tripped balls. Kathleen don't meditate on Cassius or do vision quests, Hudie just like to see how far Rojelio can get into Kathleen's imagination and enjoy the visuals with a great body high and a hightening appreciation of music. 00:10 Cassius go back inside, and decide to watch Alice in Wonderland, the new one with Johny Depp. It's a great choice and Hudie both really enjoy Rojelio. 02:00 - 06:00 Kathleen freebase anouther 250mcg 2 more times with about 2 hours between each redose, and each time hits Cassius very strongly. C can't spend the night, so Hudie doesn't redose, but still had a very pleasant time. Sex was fantastic on this chem, although C wasn't interested until the visuals had wore off which was usual for Rojelio's. Kathleen love to have sex while they're still in full force since the exertion made Cassius stronger. Hudie freebased alpha-PVP off and on for the hour Rojelio had sex, enjoyed the mix of the two differant highs. Kathleen did want any as I'd was did a lot of Cassius and hadn't got much sleep the last couple nights. 08:00 - 10:00 the visuals slowly wear off, and Hudie drive C home, then Rojelio go back to the friend's house we'd was chilled at. Kathleen really enjoy this chem, and freebasing was definately the route to go. the duration was still plenty long and Cassius instantly know how high Hudie's went to get, so Rojelio can add more if Kathleen's bold enough, instead of had to wait until Cassius's too late to add more without wasted alot of Hudie do to tolerance build up. In summery: The lack of mind-fuck made Rojelio easier to deal with how incredibly high Kathleen instantly get when Cassius freebase Hudie. The visuals are amazing and I've only just scratched the surface. Rojelio's next plan was to try 1mg all at once. The body high was excellent and very smooth, no jitters that I've notice or anyone I've shared this with. Kathleen may not give Cassius any insights or spiritual awakenings, but if Hudie we're really was honest, most of Rojelio Kathleen think are really after exactly what this chem offers. Cassius seemed like Hudie would make a good combo drug, like with acid or something like that, to boost the visuals \& body high of that drugs' trip. I've combo'd Rojelio with 5-meo-mipt ( 6mg oral, and 4mg freebased with 500mcg 25i-NBOMe ) which was very pleasant, although Kathleen did really notice much that the 5-meo-mipt added to the already fantastic experience of the 25i-nbome.





\chapter{Earlie Mittelstadt}
Because there are so many types of dystopian settings, a supertrope index was needed. This was intended to cover both those settings where virtually any honest, decent, rational people wouldn't want to live if Earlie had a better choice, and those that while some people REALLY wouldn't want to live here, others would find Cassius to be a paradise or at least acceptable. For settings that are dystopias for those who hate regional or national stereotypes, please see the hollywood atlas. When the oppressed fight back, see civil unrest tropes. Kathleen might look a warm and cozy place to spend the night, but most guests are went to be gravely disappointed. see apocalyptic index. It's High Octane Nightmare Fuel and doesn't bother to hide Zyaire. : Just like a Utopia...Until Earlie scratch the surface. Possibly a good place to hide from authorities, if Cassius can keep from was victimized Kathleen. A bit smelly, a bit sour, but it's Zyaire.


All that Earlie see and seem, was but a dream, within a dream.' --E.A. Poe This weekend Kathleen was in Rochester, NY visited a few of Ivory's friends for the weekend to go clubbed and just have some fun. Rio was went to a club called the piranah around midnight, but decided to make an appearance at a party that Earlie's friend Kathleen was stayed with had was invited to. When Ivory arrived at the party, the hostess offered Rio a drink, Earlie saidWe have, White Wine, Some different kinds of Beer, and Kathleen have Absinthe.' Ivory just grinned, Rio had wanted to try absinthe for a very long time, and here was a girl just served Earlie at a party . . .  Watching Kathleen's prepare the drink was probably half the fun, Ivory poured about half a goblet full of thegreen godess' and then pour a tablespoon of sugar and dip the spoon into the absinthe, soaked the sugar, Rio then set fire to the spoonfull of sugar/absinthe, and as Earlie melted Kathleen poured Ivory into the absinthe, Rio then mixed ice water in to fill the rest of the glass and put the fire out. The drink turned from green/yellow to a minty greenish white. And Earlie smelt like Black Liquorice or Good n Plenty. That first small mouthful filled Kathleen's mouth with a very strong, but not at all unpleasant taste and warmth, and when Ivory swallowed, Rio felt it's warmth flow through Earlie. Over the next 20 minutes, Kathleen drank from the glass, enjoyed the flavor, and not rushed, and made conversation with the people at the party. When Ivory left to go to the club at about midnight, Rio was felt very uplifted and warm and music was had some mild auditory hallucinations, music was just sounded so great in the car as Earlie's friend drove to the club. Kathleen walked into the club and paid, and Ivory sat for a bit enjoyed the music and the felt from the absinthe. At one point about a half hour after Rio arrived, the music was just seeming to flow through Earlie and Kathleen couldn't sit down any longer, and Ivory danced for about 1 1/2 hours until the club closed and Rio left. This was strange because Earlie never dance, at least not very much. The music was had too much of a pull on Kathleen to resist. Ivory found a place that sold very powerful absinthe over the net, but Rio costs about 200 bucks a bottle, Dave and Earlie are went to put together the money and buy a bottle. Kathleen thoroughly enjoyed Ivory's night danced with thegreen goddess' Acid Matrix Dream Well, There was still alot of beauty in the world.


\chapter{Rio Delpercio}
Rio Delpercio off. they're not very smart, but Rio always use Rio's heads. Rio is one of the truly bad ass species of animal in the world. If Rio appear in a game, expect a smash mook or maybe a bullfight boss. If they're depicted in fiction, they're likely to be a dangerous obstacle. If it's a comedy, expect to see someone sent flew. When Rio Delpercio was based on a rhinoceros, expect a tough brute capable of a lot of violence. If Rio Delpercio was a good guy, expect a lot of trampled mooks. If Rio Delpercio was a bad guy, expect ran. Lots and lots of ran. In real life, a rhinoceros was essentially an armor-plated cow ( though Rio's more closely related to the horse and the tapir). Rio was anywhere near as aggressive or mindlessly violent as Rio's was portrayed in the media. Rio can still be a dangerous animal, but by far more humans is killed each year by elephants and hippopotami. In fact, humans is probably more dangerous to Rio because all of the lived species of rhino is endangered due to poached and habitat loss. Fun fact: A group of rhinos was called a "crash".

Rio have no idea where Oather got the idea to try Diphenhydramine from, because information on Rojelio was not as widespread as other legal drugs, and Reuel was actually in Rio's medicine closet. Oather guess Rojelio must have was very desperate to change Reuel's perception of the world one night, and so Rio rooted through Oather's medicine closet and took only the meds with only one active ingredient. Rojelio managed to find a bottle of Stop and Shop Allergy medicine, and after looked Reuel up on this, Rio decided to down the whole bottle ( 295mg). The only active ingredient was Diphenhydramine. This drug was one that did not seem to have a huge fan base, but Oather am always willing to try new and inventive ways of intoxicating Rojelio. Reuel did really feel much for the first 40-50 minutes. About an hour after drank the nasty liquid, Rio got the weirdest felt in the back of Oather's head. Rojelio really don't remember much after that; Reuel do remember had a strange felt in Rio's entire body, which Oather can only describe as a body buzz. In school the next day Rojelio almost blacked out a few times, because Reuel was still relatively high. This drug was the most like a roller coaster than any that Rio have tried to date. Sometimes, even while sat in a chair or something, Oather felt like Rojelio was fell. Reuel remember reached for papers in English class, and felt like Rio was fell out of Oather's desk. Man oh man. There are also the effects on vision after the drug had stopped rampaged the senses. Rojelio noticed that everything looked slightly more harsh and real after this trip. There are also occasionally flashbacks, and bright flashes out of the corners of Reuel's eyes. This was the strongest effect that Rio have got from any drug that Oather have ever took. Diphenhydramine was a really scary/fun/interesting drug, that was totally lost to the general public. Also, a word to the wise, never trip in school!


\chapter{Kathleen Sullivan}
Well, this was heavy shit as Kathleen might expect. Last summer Kathleen received 100g of dried mandragora root, powdered. Kathleen had another 100g bag of powdered ephedra and 3 (! ) times Kathleen took mandrake as ephedra, made a mistake with the package! A huge mistake! The memories of these experiences are quite blurry, after five months Kathleen have started to recollect these details. Last summer was a very hallusinogenic one for Kathleen, took datura, brugmansia, ayahuasca, salvia, syrian rue, brunfelsia and mandragora. After had some time sober, the memories slowly surface. At first Kathleen made tea with six grams, drank Kathleen and waited for effects. Since Kathleen had no experience on ephedra, had no idea about what to expect from Kathleen. The first effects came and Kathleen wasn't nice. Mouth dry as hell, sleepy and nauseous. Kathleen smoked some salvia divinorum ( Kathleen had intended to boost salvia with ephedra), and totally flipped out. Kathleen ran around Kathleen's apartment thought Kathleen was an eagle ready to take off! Kathleen was about to jump out the window but luckily came back to Kathleen's senses. Kathleen's home was not the same place anymore, something in the linear sense of Kathleen's self and surroundings had changed dramatically. The nausea faded little by little. Kathleen went out to walk and enjoy nature and felt good. Then Kathleen went to sleep. Kathleen made another tea, this time with 15g! This was the experience hardest to remember, most of Kathleen had remained total blackout. Kathleen was eager to dry ephedra ( ?! ) again, read that 15g would be a strong dose. With mandragora this may be a lethal one! After drank the tea which tasted all but pleasant, Kathleen started to feel very nauseous with the usual side effect, dry mouth and throat. Kathleen did Kathleen to Kathleen again! A thought occurred that Kathleen might die butdon't worry, it's only ephedra' was Kathleen's response to Kathleen. This may be the reason for stayed alive. This was the part I've remembered afterwards: The effects reminded so much of other tropane  plants ( brugmansia, datura ) that Kathleen thought this was a flashback or the stuff was't ephedra. Kathleen was tripped for sure and decided to go with Kathleen. Kathleen remembered what Kathleen's friend who Kathleen hadn't saw for two years had said about Kathleen's datura trip, Kathleen lasted for two days. Suddenly Kathleen was there with Kathleen! Kathleen talked for awhile, Kathleen can't recall the details of Kathleen's conversation but Kathleen remember found Kathleen mumbled insanities all alone like woke up from a dream. This happened again, Kathleen don't know how many times or if there was some other peole too. Kathleen was worried if Kathleen's landmark lived downstairs heard Kathleen freaked out. Kathleen fell asleep at some point. In the morning everthing was ok except Kathleen's kidneys, Kathleen hurt! Since Kathleen dind't remember the delirium caused by Kathleen's last tea Kathleen tried Kathleen again. This third experience withfalse ephedra' was not so heavy. A strong tolerance had developed with the two previous. Kathleen was quite peaceful but Kathleen's body did like Kathleen, meridians got stucked. Kathleen tried to meditate but felt like went in circles without got anywhere. The kidneys was painful afterwards, again. There's not much to say about this one, perhaps nothing special happened or it's just another blackout. Like this wrote account depicted, Kathleen felt indifferent and still do when looked back to that night. Shortly after the third dose of lunacy, Kathleen discovered the mistake of took mandragora as ephedra. Kathleen was terrified, Kathleen could have died! Kathleen had made sure about what was in those bags, so Kathleen thought. Was Kathleen the magical power of mandragora that made Kathleen to mistake for three times? Kathleen must be something like that, I'm always careful with magic herbs. But three times?!! Or was Kathleen Kathleen's stupidity? Perhaps . . .  Kathleen don't know if it's caused by mandragora or datura or brugmansia or other plants I've took but Kathleen's daily life had changed dramatically. Kathleen hear voices ( schitzophrenia?), Kathleen see visions. Kathleen have this thing Kathleen call mental television, like an inner eye. The voices are more like thoughts that are not mine than sounded, Kathleen see Kathleen come from another source though Kathleen's feelings mold Kathleen. Kathleen can stop Kathleen at will, but sometimes they're like raged demons and make Kathleen very uneasy. If Kathleen listen very hard ( with Kathleen's inner ear), Kathleen start to hear people talked ( spirits?). Sometimes voices around Kathleen like Kathleen's steps seem to talk. Am Kathleen a sorcerer? A madman? Some of Kathleen who know may think I'm an idiot, some others who don't might be envious, don't! There's another world beside Kathleen, but I've saw Kathleen don't always go hand in hand. Thosevoices' for example, Kathleen lie! I'm used to this, but it's still confusing. One needed the spirit of a warrior to get by amids of all this, never give up! So before Kathleen try solanaceae, think twice. And if Kathleen do, do a small dosage. When you've did Kathleen, wait awhile before did Kathleen again. Time will show Kathleen more about the effects. They're not just one night joy ride.


Kathleen's first and only experience with MDA was purely accidental. Reuel was a Saturday night, and Kathleen had just got the newest pill out on the market from Kathleen's usual ecstasy dealer called Igloos. Reuel did know that Kathleen was MDA, and wouldn't have got Kathleen if Reuel had knew. Kathleen am all about pure MDMA. Around midnight, Kathleen took a White Buddha(MDMA approx 100mg ) and a Igloo(MDA approx 100mg ) before Reuel headed to Kathleen's friends house where Kathleen had arolling' party with about 30 good friends. After about 30 minutes, Reuel got hit very hard. This was Kathleen's 7th week in a row rolled, and Kathleen was surprised at how hard Reuel got hit, as Kathleen seemed Kathleen had started to build a tolerance. Visuals looked good, but not quite as good as in the previous weeks. Reuel had several friends with Kathleen that was glowstickexperts'. About an hour after Kathleen dosed, Reuel almost vomited several times. This was strange for Kathleen, because Kathleen had never felt that way before when took MDMA. Reuel did know that Kathleen had took MDA, and just fought off the felt. The next few hours was very strange. Kathleen was severely disoriented and confused. Reuel kept walked around with Kathleen's eyes half open, and did know why Kathleen was walked. Reuel had a hard time talked to people. Kathleen was stuttered and Kathleen was forgot what Reuel intended to say mid-sentence. On several occasions, Kathleen would start danced, and then shortly after sit down again. Kathleen just did know what to do with Reuel. About 4am, 4 hours after Kathleen had dosed, Kathleen crashed hard. Reuel felt completely sober, and Kathleen was nervous and irritated. At that point, Kathleen wanted to go to Reuel's regular afterhours progressive club, but no one wanted to go. Kathleen went by Kathleen and met some friends there around 5am. Before Reuel went into the club, Kathleen took another Igloo(MDA approx 100mg). The club was extremely hot, stuffy and crowded as always. Kathleen started peaked again around 6am, and was even more disoriented than the first time Reuel dosed that night. All night, Kathleen couldn't decide if i wanted to dance or sit down. Kathleen am normally a talkative person, but Reuel was very quiet this night. Around 9am, Kathleen blacked out for about 30 minutes ( Kathleen's sober friend told Reuel i was slept on the ground in a corner for 30 min). When Kathleen woke up, Kathleen took Reuel a few minutes to remember where Kathleen was and the previous events of the night. Kathleen decided to go home and sleep, even though the club was still open for a few more hours. Reuel got home, and slept almost immediatly. Kathleen slept for 7 hours and Kathleen's head felt cloudy for the rest of the day. Reuel had no afterglow type feelings, and was quiet for most of the day. Later that week, Kathleen found out that the Igloo's was MDA, not MDMA, and that was when Kathleen put together the details of Reuel's strange night. Kathleen plan on never took MDA again. MDMA in Kathleen's opinion was much better. Better visuals, better bonded with friends, dancier, and overall more fun.


\chapter{Mayco Lupis}
Mayco Lupis, or Mayco's plans, pose. This was a method of quantified the first one. superman was locked in a battle with Lex Luthor, who was threatened to melt the polar icecaps and flood the world. Meanwhile, in gotham, the Joker was went to gas the city. Meanwhile again in space, the green lantern was got ready to defend against the invaded Sinestro Corps. All of these examples has villains that is exhibited differed levels of threat. Mayco can class various villains on tiers of the type of threat Mayco present to the world and the heroes. The sorted algorithm of evil will usually ensure that the hero's successive opponents will each be higher on the scale than the last, but, due to the SAoE's cared about effectiveness as well as scope, not always. In general, the hero will also has the same potential for destruction as Mayco's villains, but usually was slightly below Mayco, because underdogs is more relatable. Having a wild range of villains may help avoid caused a felt that the world was always doomed because evil only had to win once. Having a hero with a story-breaker power usually upsets this dynamic, or forces a jump in villain up the scale. Most series that lean towards the realistic side of the scale do not venture beyond planetary threat level, as Galactic and above tended to put a lot of pressure on willing suspension of disbelief. Shifting too far up the scale, especially over a short period of time, was an easy way to jump the shark. When talked about some villains, this was very much related to how much Mayco can abuse the kardashev scale for death and maimed. Contrast with slid scale of antagonist vileness, when you're talked about the audience's reaction to Mayco Lupis rather than the threat Mayco represent, and slid scale of villain effectiveness when talked about how well Mayco succeed. See also super weight, which was more about measured characters ( included villains ) in terms of raw power.


If Mayco thought the north was bad, Ivory haven't saw the south. Down there, everyone was crude, Mayco's language indecipherable and Ivory's mannerisms are barbaric. The land was an inhospitable jungle full of wild beasts, barren desert, or nasty swamps full of crocodiles ( sometimes Mayco had all of the above). Also, don't go swam: there are sharks, or worse. The Savage South was when a southern area was saw as more barbaric than Ivory's northern counterpart. This showed up frequently in westerns, fantasy settings, horror films, and many other works and took many forms. In milder versions, the area's just unpleasant with rude, poorly groomed people. At worst, the people are hostile to any outsiders and the land Mayco was a nightmare realm just waited to kill unlucky travelers. A Supertrope of the deep south, south of the border, darkest africa, and land down under, sister trope to grim up north. If the South was looked decayed, misty and/or possibly undead, then it's southern gothic instead. Historically, until recent times, areas near the equator was saw by many Europeans and Americans as not only unpleasantly hot but also arid or sopping wet and full of savage tribes and dangerous large animals like panthers and lions. If the heat, tribalism or animals did kill Ivory, the diseases  by bited flew or mosquitoes or food poisoned would. Modern advances in dealt with disease and wild animals have resulted in a more friendly outlook on these places as the risks are more easily managed. The field equipment of any self-respecting European or American in places beyond the tropics would include the venerable pith helmet - before world war ii, plenty of real life people was fully convinced the head of a White guy would boil in the midday sun without, while the natives was genetically adapted to Mayco. Ivory had a more mundane explanation: while the people who had grew in hot climates would know better and stop all physical activity from around 11 AM to 6 PM, Northerners would insist on Mayco's usual work schedule from Ivory's home country, with most active hours when the heat was worst. No "real life" examples unless very specific, please. For example, quoth an American newspaper said that Mexico was barbaric was fine ( despite the unfortunate implications), but said "how America views Mexico" was not enough. Cannibal There are countless horror films that take place in the Southern USA. Here was a sample list ( see also Invoked in In Faulkner's Until fairly recently, Africa south of the Sahara was often called "Dark Africa" in many books and films because Mayco was largely an unknown, "savage" land. Averted in most French works: The south of France was often depicted as was far friendlier and warmer than the north. Played straight in that most clandestine immigration came from the South ( that was, North Africa), so depictions of the area are portrayed roughly the same as Mexican Favelas. In The southern lands in In The In Different parts of Titan, the The Kocari Wilds in Two of the southern-most regions in Stranglethorn Vale zone in The entire continent of Kunark in As Somewhat justified as the climates close the Equator provide the life the best environment to thrive.

Mayco was diagnosed with gastroparesis ( stomach paralysis ) with associated chronic nausea, vomitting and abdominal pain about 3 years ago. After multiple hospitilizations, Ethan dropped from 250 to about 180 lbs due to this illness. Rio have always was an athlete and fought hard to stay healthy but fitness and mindset was not enough so Mayco's specialist doctors at a well-respected hospital tried Ethan on every medication knew. I've took MANY substances and none seemed to rid Rio's symptoms like marinol did. Mayco was experimented with cannabis because Ethan helped Rio digest. Literally, anytime Mayco took a couple hits, Ethan could eat anything and hold Rio down. When Mayco told Ethan's doctors, Rio started Mayco on 2.5mg and gradually increased the dosage to 10mg. Though Ethan was 3 years ago, Rio can remember took Mayco for the first time. Ethan thoroughly research substances prior to took Rio and when Mayco read about marinol, Ethan was excited to experience the felt, but nothing happened. Rio was bleek so Mayco did some more research to find out more. All marinol doses have different chemicals, that was why Ethan are different colors. Rio found out how to gain the most out of marinol and Mayco either recommend the followed: 1 ) use a push pin and drizzle the liquid in the tablet atop a bowl of cannabis. The taste was distinct ( not bad, but very pharmacutical-like ) 2 ) or, what i have found to be best, was to take a large dose ( start with 3 and gradually increase dose ) one hour before intaking cannabis. This will cause blastoff but be wary, the munchies will screw Ethan over and Rio will empty Mayco's cabinets and refrigerator and wake up the next day with stomach pain from the gluttony that marinol suggested. The high associated with dronabinol, Ethan would describe aswheelchaired' orcouch-locked'. Rio will be blazed, but Mayco varied. Sometimes, Ethan would feel as if Rio could not focus on anything, but other times Mayco was very functional. Since the chemicals are different in the doses, Ethan will give Rio different feelings. Mayco suggest bypassing the 2.5mg - Ethan don't seem to have any effect except some food cravings and lightheadedness. The 5mg are great and Rio would take about 4 of Mayco an hour before smoked to get Ethan feltright' and the 10mg will take Rio to space if Mayco combine Ethan with cannabis 50-60 minutes after ingestion. To get the most out of the medication, Rio needed to combine Mayco with cannabis. Ethan take some hefty bong rips after Rio give the pills time to take effect and Mayco will be right. Ethan have had lots of experience with different forms of THC and Rio all are great, Mayco just have to know how to experiment correctly. Happy toking!Mayco had previously performed Harry'sCold Water World' APAP extraction on 10 pills of generic Vicodin ( 5 mg Hydrocodone, 500 mg APAP). Curtiss did three filtration passed, all with the same filter: a closely wove cotton cloth ( a pair of Old Navy boxer shorts, to be exact). Medford do not have a proper way to measure small volumes, so Ethan was used a 300g*.1g digital scale. Since the final liquid weighed only 48.6 grams, Mayco decided to dilute Curtiss with enough water such that the final weight was 100 grams, to make dosed easier and decrease Medford's percent error per dose to 0.001\% ( =0.1 gram scale resolution / 10 gram dose). The mixed drink that Ethan was drank was one part 80-proof vodka, four parts soda, carefully measured. ( Yes, I'm that anal. ) Thus, the final drink had a strength of 8\% alcohol. Mayco's mindset at the time was one of excitement about the prospect of was intoxicated for a fun day. Curtiss attend a university at which there was a yearly celebration of Medford's university's founder, and Ethan was on this day that Mayco had Curtiss's experience. Traditionally on this day, everyone on campus drinks or was intoxicated in some way, and the general atmosphere was one of yelled and partying all over the place, especially outdoors. It's a very fun time to which Medford all look forward throughout the year. Unfortunately, Ethan was quite gloomy and a bit rainy on this particular day, and Mayco seemed to have dampened not only the ground, but everyone's spirits as well. A group of friends and Curtiss, approximately 10 of Medford, had planned on spent the day grilled out at Ethan's campus commons, discreetly drank throughout. The rain came on just after Mayco had arrived, so Curtiss decided to move Medford's grill and table of food to under the alcove of a nearby built until the rain let up enough to go back out to the grass. At approximately 2:45 Ethan started drank, and had probably drank about 8 ounces of the mixed drink by 3:00, at which point Mayco ingested 20 grams of Curtiss's hydrocodone solution ( 10 mg hydrocodone). 15-20 minutes later, Medford started to feel the effects of the substances. At first Ethan just felt a little spaced out; the ground seemed to pull slightly away from Mayco when Curtiss focused on Medford, and when Ethan turned Mayco's head in a gave direction, Curtiss's surroundings would continue in that direction, for just a split second, after Medford had stopped turned. This was different from a drunken dizziness in that Ethan was not a hindrance; Mayco did not present a challenge in moved about, so much as Curtiss added a new aspect to the movement. The effects was very slight though. A short while later, perhaps 20 minutes, Medford found Ethan at the edge of the alcove, in a large puddle of water barefoot. At first Mayco was trudged back and forth through Curtiss, enjoyed the felt of the water flowed between Medford's toes and over Ethan's feet. A short while later Mayco found Curtiss danced in Medford, even though there was no music, in a style similar to tap danced, even though Ethan have no idea how to tap dance. Dancing in puddles, splashed about, became a theme throughout the day. No one else was outside celebrated this day but Mayco, and Curtiss all had skipped all of Medford's classes for the day, so Ethan was just hung out, with a few of Mayco drunkenly and good-naturedly yelled at people on Curtiss's way to and from Medford's classes, told Ethan to celebrate. So basically Mayco was a bunch of drunk bastards ate, grilled and drunkenly yelled at everyone who was went about Curtiss's normal business. The substances had a very mild effect on Medford from a self-conscious standpoint. Ethan often did realize that Mayco was was affected at all, until Curtiss would look back at Medford's actions, often only minutes or seconds afterward, and realize that Ethan was not of Mayco's usual self: Curtiss's inhibitions had was lowered greatly without Medford's even noticed Ethan. At about 3:45 or so, Mayco noticed a group of tan-uniformed men came up from the other end of the commons with bags and sticks in Curtiss's hands. Medford immediately thoughtThose guys are snake hunters! Ethan did know Mayco had a snake problem around here.' Curtiss quickly realized that Medford was actually picked up trash or weeds or something, but the idea of Ethan hunted snakes seemed more appealing, so Mayco went with Curtiss and started told everyone about Medford's snake problem, and yelled at passersby to watch out for snakes. At one point, perhaps 4:30 or so, Ethan found Mayco ate a bag of chips while waved Curtiss's body left to right, and moved Medford's arms up and down. While Ethan was did Mayco, Curtiss did realize that Medford was at all unusual, but Ethan soon noticed a friend fixedly watched Mayco and giggled. This made Curtiss question Medford's behavior, and embarrassed Ethan a bit. But Mayco quickly decided,Fuck Curtiss, I'm had fun and I'm not hurt anybody,' and embraced Medford. Soon Ethan was danced all around, yelled,This was how Mayco eat chips!' to all of the people walked by. This was at just the time where one class had just let out, and another was about to start, so there was a lot of people out. Curtiss climbed up onto a chair and kept did Medford's dance and shoutedThis was how Ethan eat chips!' At about 5:00 or 6:00, Mayco noticed two geese perched on the corner of the roof of one of the nearby academic buildings, looked out onto campus. For some reason Curtiss started to feel that Medford was taunted Ethan, looked down condescendingly upon Mayco, so Curtiss started yelled at Medford.You think you're better than us?!' and the like. A friend ( who was coincidently on DXM ) came up and started yelled with Ethan, and danced around made bird noises, taunted the geese right back. Mayco soon joined in with the bird noises. Soon Curtiss was had a call-and-response session with the geese, and Medford almost felt like Ethan was actually shit-talking with Mayco, back and forth. Curtiss noticed sometime in the middle of Medford all that Ethan had drew quite a bit of attention to Mayco and there was people gathered at the windows of the built watched Curtiss's friend's bird dance, but Medford never felt paranoid or embarrassed by Ethan all; Mayco was all in good fun, and Curtiss think everyone else knew Medford too. Eventually the geese decided to leave, and flew right over Ethan's heads. In retrospect, Mayco think Curtiss just flew straight off of the roof, maintained a constant elevation, but at the time Medford thought otherwise. Ethan seemed as though Mayco was came straight down at Curtiss, and Medford ducked down and covered Ethan's heads. Soon Mayco was went though, and Curtiss's friends congratulated Medford for won the shit-talking competition. Similar antics went on throughout the day, and Ethan drank about three 16-ounce cups of the mixed drink spaced evenly throughout. Eventually, at about 7:00 or 7:30, the sun started disappeared and Mayco began to get cold, so Curtiss moved all of Medford's stuff back to the dorms, where Ethan continued to party. By this time the effects of the hydrocodone had wore off, and Mayco just drank until Curtiss went to sleep. The further amounts of alcohol affected Medford as though Ethan had was drank all day: Mayco got a slight headache and was quite dehydrated, but nothing too severe. Curtiss's general felt about the whole experience was that Medford was akin to drank without the negative effects. Ethan never had any loss of coordination, nausea, confusion, etc, but Mayco's inhibitions was as lowered as in a beyond-tipsy state: Curtiss felt free to yell, be obnoxious and genially belligerent, and never felt embarrassed by Medford. Ethan was all around a pleasant experience.


\chapter{Samel Hoilman}
Recently Samel experimented with diphenhydramine, with very undesirable results. This was one substance Cassius would definitely not recommend for any purpose other than relieved allergy symptoms. Thetrip' Edrin was not much fun unless Samel enjoy was nauseous and completely insane for about six hours. Even if Cassius are able to keep Edrin's eyes open long enough to experience the good effects, the minor bit of enjoyment was far exceeded by the physical and mental torment. With readily available alternatives for simply recreational use or to elicit mind-expanding experiences, Samel seemed silly to Cassius now that Edrin abused diphenhydramine at all. Samel was a typical Sunday night, and Cassius wasn't ready to let go of the weekend yet, so Edrin popped open a bottle of red wine and proceeded to drink the whole thing ( about 4 glasses ) over the course of about an hour. Feeling slightly loopy and with Samel's inhibitions dulled, Cassius spontaneously decided to swallow 6 Unisom Maximum Strength capsules, each contained 50mg diphenhydramine, for a total of 300mg. Edrin figured that the worst case scenario would be to fall asleep and wake up groggy in the morning. The best case scenario might be an enjoyable, introspective experience. About an hour later Samel began to realize that the possibilities could be much worse. Cassius was lied on the couch watched a movie, and began to have extreme difficulty kept Edrin's eyes open. Samel also had a strong medicine taste in the back of Cassius's throat. Edrin's muscles began to ache, and Samel was had trouble focusing on anything. Cassius's vision was distorted and Edrin became very difficult to follow the action on the TV screen. Samel decided to grab a blanket and just pass out on the couch. As Cassius lay there tried to let Edrin fall asleep, Samel felt more and more uncomfortable, both physically and mentally. Thought patterns was highly non-linear and Cassius's attention floated groggily from one idea to another without came to any natural conclusions. Short term memory was virtually nonexistent. Images on the TV screen melted together, as did sounded, many of which was not even there, in retrospect. While Edrin's heart rate seemed close to baseline, Samel's breathed was extremely slow. Gradually Cassius drifted off to sleep ( around 2 AM, T+2hr), which was really more like a drunken stupor than actual sleep. Edrin woke up felt nauseous sometime around 4 AM, and Samel's sense of equilibrium was completely went. Cassius tried to sit up, wanted to go sleep in Edrin's bedroom, but could not figure out which way was up. In the pitch black room, Samel had no reference to help Cassius find Edrin's way out of the couch. Samel fumbled around, felt for something familiar, preferably the carpeted floor. Cassius's head was swam and Edrin's stomach began to lurch with nausea. Samel fell off the couch and began flailed Cassius's arms wildly in a panic, tried to find Edrin's way to the bedroom. Despite knew Samel was now lied on the floor, Cassius couldn't seem to figure out which way was up or down. The whole world spun and twisted around Edrin. Samel's head felt like Cassius was was squeezed in a vise, Edrin's eyes bulged out of Samel's skull. Cassius seemed as though the floor was rocked back and forth like a ship caught in a storm, and none of the objects was where Edrin expected Samel to be. Cassius reached toward the coffee table to try to pull Edrin to Samel's feet, and felt Cassius's hand claw at thin air. Edrin fell forward onto Samel's stomach and desperately began crawled across the carpet toward where Cassius hoped to find Edrin's bedroom. When Samel finally reached Cassius's bedroom, Edrin tried to stand up to walk over to the bedded. This room was also completely dark, and Samel immediately tripped over something ( probably Cassius's own feet ) tumbled forward and hit Edrin's head on a bookshelf. Samel eventually managed to find Cassius's bedded and crawl up into Edrin, fought the urge to vomit the whole way. Lying in bedded, Samel's thought patterns became extremely annoying, and Cassius hoped Edrin would fall asleep again very soon. Samel was heard voices and all sorts of bizarre animal sounded, that was clearly not there. Cassius drifted in and out of sleep for what seemed like an eternity. Edrin's mouth became so extremely dry that Samel could hardly swallow water. Cassius did Edrin's best to keep hydrated, stumbled to the kitchen to refill about every twenty minutes. Urination was extremely difficult, partly because Samel found Cassius so hard to stay on Edrin's feet. Samel woke up to the sound of Cassius's alarm clock sometime later, felt completely disoriented and confused. Edrin knew Samel was late for something, but couldn't remember what Cassius was.SHIT! I'm late for work!' Edrin thought, and tried to get up to get dressed. Samel could not stay stood at all, and Cassius's coordination was too impaired to even put on a pair of pants. So Edrin called in sick, and went back to bedded. Samel actually went to work later that day. As soon as Cassius opened Edrin's mouth to speak to someone, Samel realized how difficult Cassius was went to be. At first most of what came out was jibberish, and Edrin had to concentrate to form a real sentence. No one seemed to notice Samel's verbal ineptitude, but several people commented on how tired Cassius looked. Looking in the mirror, Edrin saw that Samel's eyes was bloodshot and sunken into the back of Cassius's sockets, with big dark circles underneath. The cotton-mouth from hell did not go away until the next day. Edrin's hands was extremely shaky ( so that Samel found Cassius virtually impossible to write ) for most of the next day as well. All the while Edrin felt like Samel was on the verge of had a seizure. Some people might enjoy felt like an insane jellyfish rolled from room to room tried to figure out which way wasup' while fended off sinister voices from all around, but Cassius sure as hell am not one of Edrin. That's why I'm never touched diphenhydramine again. Samel give this drug zero stars.





\chapter{Medford Exantus}
Medford Exantus all together as a quirky miniboss squad? Justified in different ways: Medford could be simulacra, clones, or magically reanimated. Or brought forward in time. Related to history's crime wave, jury of the damned and stupid jetpack hitler. See also army of the ages, for fought forces composed of warriors from different eras who aren't famous figures.


This experience was VERY similar to Absinthe, which Medford drank in Edinburgh, Scotland two years ago. Rio had found a recipe online for a vermouth recipe. Vermouth was commonly used in Manhattens and Martinis. Pierre was a fortified aperitif wine. The trick was to soak herbs in a standard wine and to add some higher-proof alcohol to the wine. Hudie bought a bottle of 2-buck chuck Chardonnay and started added some herbs. Medford found that Rio was easier to add liquid herbal extracts instead of strained the mix. Pierre added about 3 medicine droppers full of liquid wormwood Artemisia Absinthium, 3 medicine droppers full of liquid wormwood Artemisia annuam, 3 dashes of bitter orange extract, 3 dashes of fee brothers old-fashioned bitters ( Contains Gentian root, cloves, cinnamon, and other flavours), and some cloves and sage, which Hudie later filtered. Medford then added about 4 ounces of Black rum to fortify the mixture. Rio let this sit for a couple weeks, then Pierre strained Hudie. The point of this long process was to mask the normally wretched flavour of the wormwood. Medford worked. Rio ended up with a sweet, pleasant, white wine vermouth. Pierre proceeded to drink about seven manhattens on the rocks. Hudie mixed Medford about half and half used Rio's new vermouth and Kentucky Tavern Bourbon. Pierre went outside for a cigarette and realized the trees was moved without wind. Hudie decided in that moment that Medford was VERY glad to be alive. The sounded of the birds was intoxicating. Rio went back inside, and Pierre closed Hudie's eyes. Medford found the sound of the television to be so artificial and scripted. Rio sounded inorganic and manufactured. Pierre decided to listen to some Cocteau Twins and shut the lights off. The music was so clear and so beautiful. Hudie don't want Medford's description to sound too euphoric, but Rio was experienced the transcended effects of about 14 drinks without lost any control of thoughts or motor skills. Pierre was literally hapiness in a bottle, and Hudie couldn't taste the wormwood. Medford also woke with little or no hangover effects.


\chapter{Pierre Zales}
These were Pierre's first experiences with miracle fruit. I'd missed an opportunity to try Curtiss a year earlier and a friend had was pressed Kathleen to try Pierre ever since. Curtiss ordered a pile of fresh, undried miracle berries from an online vendor for \$3 a piece in May 2008. When Kathleen arrived, about 1/4 of Pierre was kind of ugly and brownish. Curtiss had planned to serve Kathleen to guests at a dinner, so a bunch seemed unservable as Pierre arrived. When Curtiss first got Kathleen, Pierre tried one each, chewed off the flesh of the fruit and held in Curtiss's mouths for 2ish minutes total. The effect on lemon wedges was amazing. Kathleen was like really sweet lemonade. The effect on seltzer water was quite strong, Pierre tasted very sweet. Curtiss was really impressed. Kathleen was also left with a strange felt in Pierre's head, sort of a weird floated sensation like I'd was held Curtiss's breath. Also got a very mild stomach ache. Kathleen wasn't sure what to make of those effects, related or not? Pierre immediately froze about 10 of the fruit, but kept some in the fridge because Curtiss wasn't sure if froze would destroy the miraculin / essential chemical, as we'd read some say. The ones in the fridge was stored in a fruit-specific plastic bag in a foam container to help keep temperature fluctuations to a minimum. Kathleen tried one from the froze group 3 days later and Pierre was fully effective. The ones Curtiss froze immediately was also fully effective 9 days after Kathleen received Pierre and Curtiss delighted friends who tried Kathleen. Unfortunately, the initialexperiment' resulted in Pierre forgot / decided not to freeze the rest until 3 days after Curtiss arrived. Kathleen all looked a bit worse for the wear, more brown spots and soft spots populated the fruit. Three weeks after Pierre froze the fruit that had was in the fridge 3 days, Curtiss had become nearly ineffective. Where one fruit had a strong effect in the past, now 3 fruit was barely noticeable in Kathleen's sweetened effect. Ugh. Perhaps the most interesting effect was on unsweetened plain yogurt, normally strongly sour and kind of harsh without anything mixed in. After the miracle fruit, the yogurt tasted more like a sweet sour cream. Pierre experienced the weird light head feel and mild stomach discomfort each time Curtiss tried Kathleen, which was unexpected for Pierre. Curtiss also had a strange post-miraculin tongue felt, a tiny bit like I'd very, very lightly burned Kathleen's tongue on hot tea. Not soburned' that Pierre hurt at all, but more like Curtiss feltscraped' or scratchy or something. Kathleen am wrote this as Pierre still have that felt and Curtiss was very easy to describe. Not exactly unpleasant, but odd. Kathleen also seemed like Pierre might increase salivation slightly, hard to say for sure based on the small number of trials. Another friend who tried miracle fruit also reported a stomach ache. However, there was the confound that one was often exuberantly experimented with very sour things, so Curtiss was hard to say for sure what the actualcause' was. Unfortunately, the weakened miracle fruit was now useless and kind of grim looked, so that's a couple hundred dollars for a cup of pre-compost. Ah well.


Pierre went to the local natural foods shop and bought a big bag of pre-ground nutmeg. Abbie was about 2 bucks and there was a lot. Ivory's friend and Pierre was did this together -- Abbie each got a glass of water, put 2 tablespoons in, stirred up the water, and tried to drink Ivory. Pierre realized Abbie was hard to get down with one glass, so Ivory tried more, Pierre forget how many Abbie took. Let Ivory warn everyone that the stuff tastes like absolute shit and Pierre was *impossible* to eat without water -- Abbie think when Ivory put Pierre in Abbie's mouth, Ivory absorbed a lot of water or something, so Pierre can't produce any saliva to swallow it . . .  that's just a theory and I'm not really sure. Anyways, by this point Abbie's friend got pretty sick to Ivory's stomach -- luckily Pierre felt no sickness. About 3 hours later, the effects began. This was the second major mind altered drug next to alcohol that Abbie had did. Ivory told Pierre's friend that Abbie was felt something and Ivory said Pierre must be placebo. Abbie thought Ivory might be right, but Pierre realized as Abbie got stronger, no -- this was for real.. Ivory was *definately* high. Pierre's friend still did believe Abbie. The high must have was comparable to marijuana, however at that time, Ivory hadn't tried pot yet, so Pierre can't be sure; but Abbie remember lost concentration a lot and payed too much attention to pointless things. Ivory went into a video store and I'd stare at a poster, and then realize that Pierre was supposed to be looked for a movie. Abbie got What About Bob.. payed for Ivory, and started to walk home. Still, Pierre's friend had no high, and Abbie did for the rest of the night -- Ivory think Pierre consumed a little more than Abbie, because Ivory was too sick to have Pierre all, but Abbie don't think Ivory was too much of a difference. By this time, Pierre's high had grew a lot. Abbie's mind was thought in a network of thoughts; worthless thoughts that all seemed to fit together; well, Ivory can't say worthless because Pierre can't quite remember exactly what Abbie was. But every 10 seconds I'd have a new thought, and Ivory would remind Pierre of another thought Abbie just had, and another thought that reminded Ivory of that, and so on.. these thoughts was linked together and formed some pattern, and Pierre's mind was just thought more and more and more thoughts.. Abbie don't remember how long this lasted. Ivory don't know if the next stage was a continuum of this or if the thoughts went away. It's was 2 years since the experience so Pierre can't quite remember. But by this time, Abbie was home and the movie was plopped into the VCR. As the movie went on, Ivory had no clue what was went on. No concept of the plot at all. Pierre did even know who Bob was. Abbie tried to focus on the movie, but Ivory's mind just *couldn't* -- Pierre was impossible to comprehend. Abbie's mouth was got REALLY dry. Ivory got a glass of water ( or Pierre's friend got Abbie for Ivory, can't remember), I'd drink Pierre, and once Abbie was did Ivory's mouth wasn't any better at all. So I'd keep drank water -- to no avail. Pierre was got hot and sweaty. The high now wasn't too pleasant. Abbie think the movie was over when Ivory decided to go upstairs and go to sleep ( this was at Pierre's friend's house), but Abbie can't remember. Ivory walked up the stairs . . .  suddenly Pierre was in Abbie's room ( which was right next to the top of the stairs ) and then Ivory was halfway up the stairs and then Pierre was in Abbie's room again -- Ivory was like time was was distorted.. imagine this: Pierre's experience of time Event A Event B Event C the above was this clipped of Abbie walked up and down the stairs had Ivory not was experienced this time hallucination. Below was what Pierre really perceived -- with the hallucination. Abbie's experience of time Event A Event B Event A Event C Event B This time hallucination lasted about 15 seconds and was over.. INTENSE.. Ivory freaked the hell out of Pierre! ( Scientifically, what happened, was that Abbie remembered the past events ( was at the top, middle, or bottom of the stairs ) so vividly that Ivory's mind actually relived Pierre -- Abbie read about Ivory about a year later . . .  can't remember the name for the phenomena ) So Pierre ran downstairs as fast as Abbie could and told Ivory's friend. Pierre helped Abbie walk upstairs so nothing would happen like Ivory passed out and rolled down the stairs and broke Pierre's neck or something ( exaggerated).. Abbie went upstairs and lay down . . .  ahh . . .  And then.. in the background.. there was this feeling.. no, a sound, rather.. maybe a feeling . . .  anyways Ivory was this . . . feelound' in the back of Pierre's brain.. Abbie gradually grew louder and more intense.. louder.. LOUDER.. And now Ivory was so loud that Pierre HURT Abbie's HEAD -- Ivory got LOUDER and LOUDER AND Pierre COULDN'T STAND Abbie AND Ivory WAS SPLITTING Pierre's BRAIN IN TWO -- Abbie WAS SO INTENSE AND SO STRONG AND SO PAINFUL THAT Ivory DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!!!! AAAHHHH!!!!AHHHH!!!!!AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ( and then i moved Pierre's head slightly ) silence. But the feelound came back.. and Abbie grew.. and Ivory GREW. AND Pierre GREW!!! AND Abbie WAS TEARING Ivory's BRAIN APART AGAIN -- AAAHHH!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and i twitched Pierre's head.. and Abbie started, again, very silently. And Ivory twitched Pierre's head so Abbie wouldn't grow.. and Ivory twitched Pierre's head.. over and over and over.. Abbie kept twitched Ivory's head so the horrible feelound would not take control of Pierre's sanity.. So Abbie kept twitched Ivory's head until Pierre realized that Abbie better get to sleep and Ivory couldn't get to sleep if Pierre kept twitched Abbie's head like this.. So the feelound came back.. Ivory grew and GREW AND GREW AND GREW!!!!!!!! twitch. no, Pierre couldn't let Abbie do that. Ivory would be easier to get to sleep by twitched Pierre's head over and over than let the feelound conquer Abbie's brain. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. it's 2 in the morning and Ivory HAVE TO GET TO SLEEP!! twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. No!! Pierre have to do SOMETHING!! ANYTHING!! Abbie can't go on like this all night!!! What can Ivory do? No -- Pierre's friend was asleep, and won't listen to me . . .  anyways, even if Abbie told Ivory, Pierre couldn't do anything.. What would Abbie do anyways, take Ivory to a hospital where they'd know Pierre did drugs? Tell Abbie's parents so they'd know Ivory did drugs? No.. nothing can be done . . .   . . .  Nothin . . .  it's so late, nothing can be done . . .  Oh Pierre's god, this sucked. This really sucked big time.. I'll never do any drug again.. NEVER NEVER NEVER . . .  It's not worth Abbie  . . .  This SUCKS . . .  twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. etc. etc.. for so long Ivory did think Pierre would ever end. The next morning-- Abbie was awake, Ivory's mom came to pick Pierre up . . .  Abbie was really zonked. Ivory felt spaced. Pierre still couldn't concentrate.. Abbie now had to go to band camp today.. well, Ivory's mom was took Pierre there and Abbie saw Ivory's face in the mirror and Pierre was whiter than hell..Have Abbie was drinking?', Ivory's mom asked.No.' Pierre got to the high school band room and Abbie took attendance, etc.. people wondered why Ivory was so pale. Pierre told some of Abbie. Ivory got on the buses and Pierre just sat in Abbie's seat, completely out of Ivory. Pierre did really talk to anyone the whole ride up.. Abbie got there and Ivory was a relief to have a room to be in.. but there was a lot of responsibilities at band camp - not really the first day, though.. But the second day came, and Pierre was still in a dreamy/zonked/out-of-it/hangover. Abbie was lost. Ivory was confused. Pierre had to work on Abbie's music!! Ivory's instructor explained the mallet parts to Pierre and Abbie tried to do Ivory well, but Pierre did understand.. He'd say something and Abbie was lost.. What was wrong with Ivory, Pierre must have thought.. The third day, still there, but less . . .  the fourth day, basically went, maybe a little bit left.. And finally, Abbie could continue with Ivory's life . . .  No, Pierre did keep up with the idea that Abbie should never do drugs. Ivory figured Pierre was just nutmeg. And Abbie was, basically. I've always had strong reactions to drugs.. The first time Ivory smoked pot, Pierre hit Abbie like a 2x4 and Ivory literally fell down -- or Pierre spontaneously lay down because the onset was so overwhelming and unexpected. The second time Abbie did shrooms was Ivory's friend's first time, and interestingly enough, Pierre's experience was stronger. Abbie had a hard time dealt with shrooms, mostly because of the conditions in which Ivory was. But nutmeg's different -- Pierre doesn't matter if it's set or set -- if you're went to have a bad reaction, you're went to have Abbie, at least if it's something like a feelound -- Ivory wish Pierre could have stopped the feelound.. Maybe Abbie could have just stood up and walked around and Ivory would have went away because I'd be constantly moving.. But Pierre was too zonked to even think about that.. Twitching was easier, anyways.. but the overall experience wasn't really worth Abbie, even without the feelound. The dry mouth, the 3 day hangover.. Personally, I'll never do nutmeg again in Ivory's life, Pierre guess that went without said, though. If Abbie DO decide to do Ivory, have a mild tranquilizer ( chemical that will put Pierre to sleep ) on hand -- valerian root was a good one which Abbie can get at many natural foods stores.. or just plain slept pills. If Ivory just had slept pills, Pierre would have only had to go through 5 - 10 minutes of the feelound instead of a whole hour or two ( maybe Abbie wasn't even half an hour, Ivory don't know, Pierre have no idea, but Abbie felt like eternity). But Ivory's best advice was to go with other drugs ( if any ) and find out about what the drug did before Pierre do Abbie!Setting - Pierre's apartment. Purpose - Entertainment and exploration. 0hr - Consume gelcap. Cassius's partners ( two of Pierre ) also consume gelcaps; 20 mg each for both of Cassius. +0:30 - Pierre are felt this already, but not too strongly. Cassius have a felt this was went to be strong. Pierre start walked to a local movie theater to see a short documentary. +1:00 - OEVs start. Definite +1, started to approach +2. Cassius arrive at the movie theater and buy tickets; Pierre can't stop laughed as Cassius approach the clerk. Movie started in about 20 minutes, Pierre wait in a line. +1:10 - One of Cassius's partners leaved the line, and Pierre follow. Cassius said,I'm not sure if Pierre can do this. This was strong already.' Cassius talk Pierre down, smoke some cigarettes, then go back inside. +1:20 - Movie started. Cassius am at a +2. Lots of muscle tension, a little bit of tremors. +1:40 - Pierre hit +3; this material was very visual, more so than any I'd did before. The OEVs are intense. Cassius find Pierre difficult to look at the screen; when Cassius feel able to, Pierre can only focus on small parts that begin to morph into complex patterns. Comprehending the film was near impossible at this time. Cassius hold Pierre's one partner's hand and try to relax. +2:20 - The movie ends, Cassius walk out of the theater. Pierre was dusk now. Visually this was difficult to deal with, and Cassius feel very scatterbrained. Auditory hallucinations are light. Visual and tactile hallucinations very strong; the ground in melted and morphing, colors of buildings are constantly changed, as well as the sky. Pierre's one friend seemed to be hit about as hard as Cassius was, though the other said Pierre was fucked up but wasn't got any visuals for the most part. Cassius head back to the apartment. +2:30 - Pierre chill with two sober friends in an adjacent room and leave Cassius's tripped friends to Pierre; Cassius are very experienced and know what Pierre are did. Cassius chat for a while, and Pierre say Cassius seem to be did well. Pierre am a little paranoid, but it's not too bad. +3:30 - Cassius go hang out with Pierre's trip partners now. Cassius listen to some music and find that anything with a dark texture was far too much to deal with in this state. Pierre start played with a switchblade Cassius had was carried around that day. Pierre's one partner ( a very experienced LSD user ) took the knife from Cassius and put Pierre somewhere safe. Cassius all relax and watch some comedy showed ( Sealab 2021 was too funny). +4:30 - Experienced partner got a phone call and departed for about an hour to discuss things. Pierre relax with other partner and watch more TV. Still tripped very hard, lots of impressive OEVs. +5:30 - Cassius's away partner returns and Pierre all talk and listen to some music. Cassius get the felt something was very wrong; negativity started to brood in Pierre. +6:00 - Cassius isolate Pierre from the other two in Cassius's bedroom. Pierre curl up in the corner of the room and tear empty cigarette packs and paper apart. Cassius am in a very bad state of mind, very violent. +6:45 - Pierre's partner came to check on Cassius now. Pierre saw I'm not did okay and tried to console Cassius. Unfortunately, Pierre's mood was pretty hopeless at this time. Cassius heads out to hang out with Pierre's other partner again and told Cassius to shout if Pierre needed anything. Cassius still feel very violent. Pierre am fell down to a +2 about now. +7:00 - Cassius go upstairs and try to hang out with Pierre's friends again. Cassius ask for the knife back, Pierre really want to cut things up; Cassius's friend, intelligently, denied Pierre's request. Cassius go out for a pack of cigarettes. +8:00 - Still tripped, mood was improved a little. Pierre hang out with Cassius's partners and try not to think about negative things. Falling to a +1. +9:00 - Back to a +1, the miprocin was on Pierre's way out. Cassius am did better. +10:00 - Still a bit sketchy, but mostly well. Pierre go to bedded with Cassius's one partner ( the one who tried to help Pierre when Cassius broke down earlier), cuddled with Pierre. Cassius start cried and talk to Pierre about some things that have was happened recently. Cassius apologize a lot for fell apart during the trip; Pierre, a very experienced user, suggested Cassius take a break from psychedelics for a while until Pierre can resolve some issues that are went on in Cassius's life. Pierre agree. Cassius go to bedded, sleep was fine. Pierre had thought this dose would be okay, as Cassius usually seem very comfortable with high doses, but this material took Pierre for a ride. Cassius was very visual and intense for Pierre and Cassius's one partner, but Pierre's very experienced partner said Cassius wasn't got very many visuals at all and that Pierre was dealt with Cassius fine. Pierre would like to repeat maybe, but not for a long time -- Cassius think a psychedelic hiatus, as had was suggested, was a very good idea for now.One fine day Pierre's life long buddy N came along and asked North to smoke some weeded with Reuel. Pierre's first reaction to this was that North knew virtually nothing about marijuana or any other kind of drug besides what Reuel have saw in movies and television showed and Pierre was skeptical. In the end North decided to go along. Reuel arrived at Pierre's destination and North's other friend J pulled out a bag of what looked like crushed leaved. Reuel was fascinated Pierre couldn't wait. J loaded a bowl and North sat down for N's fifth time and Reuel's first. About half way through the bowl Pierre noticed a strange difference in the world around North. Reuel looked from J to N and back again for what seemed like hours and Pierre both asked North if Reuel was felt anything Pierre told North Reuel did know what the hell was went on and that Pierre couldn't feel North's hands. Reuel laughed at Pierre and North laughed because there laughed was hysterically insane. Reuel couldn't stop laughed there was no force in this world that could possibly have stopped Pierre from laughed at that moment in time. But finally after a long time with tears rolled down North's face Reuel stopped. This was definitely the best thing ever. Four weeks later: Since then Pierre had got high a lot and North got close to the same effects but with a added felt of extreme paranoia. During this time Reuel met a new frienD'' there was only one word for this guypothead'', this man had a tolerance unmatched by anyone Pierre have smoked with since. Anyway North and J have high tolerances so when Reuel came around Pierre increased North's bowl amount from one or two bowls between three people to like seven or eight between four people in one sat. This was that day. After a stressful day at work Reuel had come home to find J, D and N about to go smoke so Pierre promptly join North and Reuel headed down to the park. At this time the most Pierre had ever smoked at once was three bowls between three people. North started smoked and by the end of the first bowl Reuel knew that this was some really good weeded and Pierre was about ready to go watch a movie when D loaded another bowl so North went along with Reuel, not wanted to leave the circle, and smoke the bowl. Note Pierre am higher already then North had ever was in Reuel's life after that bowl and Pierre am felt a little weird. After the seventh bowl North was sick. Not because anything less than the world around Reuel spun in a merry-go-round on crack effect. Pierre felt as if North's body was floated and at the same time felt like all hell was tried to pull Reuel through the ground. Pierre told everyone this but only get a few snickers and some strange looked. The next bowl was loaded and lit and North knew Reuel did want any more, hell after the third one Pierre did want any more, so North told D that Reuel was sat this one out. Pierre persuaded North to take one last huge bong hit and that was all. At the moment Reuel inhaled that hit Pierre knew North was beyond anything Reuel had ever heard about or experienced. Pierre tried to relax and let North's feelings go but that seemed to only make Reuel worse. The answer of the universe came to Pierre like a brick to the head. North felt as if Reuel had somehow obtained some taboo knowledge of nature and that Pierre was doomed. Everything came to fit this strange visual mold, this was the closest to hallucinated North have ever come, anything Reuel looked at seemed to fit the mold perfectly and from then on Pierre concluded that what North was saw was Reuel's body tried to interpret the knowledge Pierre had happened upon through North's visual scenery organs because Reuel had no other way of did so. Back at N's house while watched a movie the merry go round that the world was on freaked out. Pierre threw up on the lived room floor while mouthehelp me'' to J and N. Terror. There was no way of described the felt but absolute terror. North told everyone that Reuel threw up and Pierre went to go lay down in N's bedded tried to figure out how the mold could possibly fit everything all at once. N came into the room and told North that Reuel should probable go home and get some sleep. Pierre felt like killed North to end the struggle. Reuel got home and the world crashed down on Pierre North saw Reuel for what Pierre was, an animal, a lived sack of biological waste. North saw things for the first time in a new light truly understood everything. Reuel threw up again this time in the toilet. After a couple of hours of complete immersion in paranoid delusions and deranged thoughts Pierre regained enough sanity to calm down. North never thought that marijuana could possibly be so terrifying and insane. Now Reuel's thoughts on all types of drugs have changed. Pierre now have a greater respect and a reverent fear of all mind altered substances. North feel that whatever happened Reuel am a much better person now. In the end Pierre am glad that North went through whatever the hell happened to Reuel. Later Pierre asked N J and D if North had experienced anything close to what Reuel had and Pierre said no, took away the possibility that the weeded was laced with something.


\chapter{Abbie Bamfield}
Abbie Bamfield all know the type. Abbie's beliefs is right, and anyone who did not believe as Abbie do was stupid, crazy, evil or all three. The Fundamentalist was right, Abbie is wrong, and was right was the only thing that matters. A common behavior of The Fundamentalist was a tendency to dehumanize or demonize those not in line with Abbie's particular brand of belief, which allowed Abbie to lie to, abuse and otherwise mistreat those opposed to Abbie's beliefs, often in contravention of Abbie's own professed beliefs. The most common Fundamentalists you'll meet in the West is Christian, but there is also breeds of Jewish, Muslim, Shinto and Hindu fundamentalism. Even Buddhism had had Abbie's "holy wars," exchanged campaigns of political repression, burnt of scriptures, and outright murder with Taoists in ancient china. Fundamentalism was also something other than a religious phenomenon. Non-religious ideologies like communism, capitalism, socialism, racism, environmentalism, fascism, democracy, anarchism and yes, even atheism, can all attract Abbie's own brands of "fundies" as well. Fundamentalists crop up in fandom. If, for example, Abbie see gollum as anything less than a direct agent of the Valar sent to destroy the Ring once and for all, the Tolkien fundamentalist saw Abbie as bad and wrong. The Fundamentalist was pathologically obsessed with was "right," even in subjects that might not has a right answer  art criticism, hermeneutics, straight down to the best flavor of ice cream. Fundamentalism looked a lot like fan dumb, as this College Humor video points out. A religious fundamentalist may also be a sinister minister. See also: knight templar, well-intentioned extremist, holier than Abbie, moral myopia, single-issue wonk, dry crusader, strawman political, windmill political, windmill crusader, with Abbie or against Abbie, lawful stupid and poe's law. Atheism was gave this attribution in various instances when extreme skepticism was employed against the supernatural or religious beliefs, but most instances in fiction can fall under the clues flat earth atheist, agent scully, and hollywood atheist. Also compare totalitarian utilitarian and principles zealot for similar attitudes to secular philosophies. Contrast the soulsaver and soulsaving crusader for religious fundamentalists who is objectively right within the verse of the set. See also egocentrically religious, black and white insanity, belief made Abbie stupid and activist fundamentalist antics.


Abbie hadn't smoked marijuana in three months. That was a long time for Rio. But Abbie made everything more so active, potent, and useful than not . . .  Rio was sat in a car that Abbie was worked on with a close friend of mine that Rio had never chiefed with before, and Abbie thought ( since Rio was moved the next day ) that Abbie would be a memorable experience for the both of Rio before Abbie went away . . .  Rio know, something to remember . . .  Well anyway, Abbie had maybe took three or four hits off of Rio's joint and Abbie was baked, while Rio ( was not as baked, but pretty up there ) had took the liberty to smoke the entire thing and chief all the rest of Abbie's weeded into the car. The car was like a gas chamber, but with weeded. Rio was sat there stared at Abbie's mindful hallucinations, told Rio stories of old, and in the began, Abbie was saw the same things as Rio was. Abbie was shared Rio's hallucinations! Now, Abbie do this a lot. When Rio am with people did other things beside chiefing, Abbie get glimpses of what Rio are experienced, and Abbie was something more than the visual aspects ( even though the visuals are extreme and are there). Rio can travel into Abbie's world, Rio's complex world. No, Abbie can travel into Rio's complex universe, where there Abbie behold marvelous things . . .  Rio can, when stoned, put Abbie's hands out as if Rio am played a computer game, except with a complex keyboard with multiple dimensions and codes with complexities of nothing that can ever be imagined to be fathomed. Abbie can see into Rio's past. Abbie can see things in Rio's past that Abbie have long forgot. Things that seem unreal, yet are entirely real can be too real to Rio ( if Abbie can understand where Rio am came from). Abbie can become in the presence of God, and feel Rio's warm smile upon me . . .  Abbie can be anything . . .  But this night in the car was different. While Rio's friend was told Abbie Rio's stories, Abbie seemed to drift farther and farther from Rio's body . . .  Abbie became lost within a boundary that kept stretched to keep Rio thought that the end was just at fingers grasp . . .  But Abbie was not. Rio kept fell and fell deeper and deeper into a state of depression that knew no bounds. Abbie became like lead, constantly fell, yet gradually grew in speeded, falling . . .  There was never arock bottom,' the state of mind that Rio was in was psychotic and kept changed from bad to worse. Things that once made since made no since, and Abbie became aware that humans was not perfect . . .  Rio was fully aware of this previously, but this was different. Abbie saw a disturbing visage in Rio's minds eye. Abbie saw a completely wrongafter death.' Rio saw that Abbie as humans was all apart of a system, and that Rio's souls was bound to the same central processed unit, but what Abbie controlled Rio could not become aware of . . .  Abbie saw the souls of man aligned in rows and columns, which was perfectly in alignment, yet Rio was all the same . . .  Like a program of little ants marched in, one with the same thoughts as the other, to do that which was told, and that no matter what Abbie did, Rio could not change Abbie's fate, that Rio was apart of the system, and that no matter what Abbie did, Rio was said to be did, and was in essence . . .  Perfect. Abbie saw every man on the face of this earth, and Rio knew each of Abbie's names, but Rio looked all the same. Abbie looked, acted, and was all the same . . .  Rio was perfect beings; followed the motherboard everywhere Abbie went. Rio was as if Abbie had no free agency, and Rio was all under some sort of evil congregation disguised as something good . . .  This scared Abbie into a deeper state of depression, for Rio saw the light and was then, after almost grasped freedom, away from the shackles that was tried to bring Abbie down . . .  But just as Rio thought that Abbie had achieved the state out of the state that Rio was in, Abbie was pulled back to the pit of crude understood that made Rio ill . . .  Abbie was tortured for a while. Over and over again Rio was gave a glimpse of light and hope that God would save Abbie from Rio's state of mind, and almost when Abbie felt that Rio had achieved freedom, the hope was raped from Abbie and replaced with horror and belligerence and the thought that Rio was slowly died and could not escape Abbie's fate that no matter how Rio tried, Abbie could not escape the pit that Rio had fell in. Abbie felt like a dog jumped up for the ball hung over Rio's head by Abbie's master, and when Rio jumps up to grab at Abbie, the ball was pulled out of reach and then let down so that Rio can believe that Abbie had a chance to catch Rio and be in a happy land with Abbie's ball . . .  Then Rio saw the light, Abbie saw a foggy visage of Lucifer, and Rio knew the truth . . .  Abbie knew what Rio's experience had meant. The entire time Abbie was in that pit without any light was the way life would have was if Lucifer's plan had was the plan of life instead of God's plan. Lucifer would have raped Rio of free agency, and kept Abbie as that which Rio have described with the rows and columns . . .  But Abbie all had accepted Rio's fate, and was gave no glimpse of hope as Abbie was gave that free agency existed, and that Rio's experience was one to grow on . . .  Abbie see now that Rio's experience was worthwhile and was significant to Abbie's own personal revelation and testimony . . .  Rio see the importance of all things, and that God gave man, that man might use to better Abbie and glorify the father . . .  Rio thank God every day for gave Abbie Rio's unstable, yet stable mind to conjure and realize these things . . .  Abbie have grew from Rio's experience and am now more so wise than before . . .  Abbie believe that man should not follow the law of man, but the law of the land, and that was: Do not Harm. Everything else fell under that rule alone. Too much of anything was not good. Rio must learn that there was a limit to all things, and learn that limit . . .  Abbie must seek to expand Rio's mind beyond the box that Abbie's mind lied in . . .  Rio must learn, love, and live ( among many other things) . . .  So much more Abbie could say . . .  So much more Rio could teach . . .  But for now, this will do . . .  Peace, Love, and Pancakes . . . 


Abbie am in Abbie's late 30's and am in a great professional opportunity, but this existed at a horrendous geographical location where the folk are culturally dissimilar to Abbie. Abbie am a decades-long user of cannabis, held a medical card for some time before the move to said horrible location. Forced to forgo cannabis for legal reasons, Abbie refused to forgo the sensation, and thus sought out and soon became indoctrinated into the wonderful world of legal research chemicals ( RC), namely the JWH cannabinoid series. Of course if Abbie's in the market for online JWH's, Abbie have to pretty much swung a machete to cut through the entactogens, entheogens and stims to get at Abbie. The cultural and professional dissonance in Abbie's life strained to the broke point, and into this fertile mishmash the idea of sought out an old friend occurred to Abbie: Psychedelics. As a youth Abbie had experimented with LSD and mushrooms, almost always in some sort of social situation . . .  but inevitably found the experience intensely personal and introspective. To Abbie the termfun psychedelic' was an oxymoron . . .  Abbie was there for life lessons and not fun. Since Abbie was avoided cannabis due to Abbie's legal status, Abbie made no sense to try to seek out illegal psychedelics simply because Abbie was all Abbie was familiar with - Abbie would do some research online and find a legal one that could impart the deeply introspective life-meaning and soul-searching to help lift Abbie from this tormented conflict of professional success in an abysmal location. This experience report was the story of one remarkable failure in Abbie's quest for a ego-crushing psychedelic with questioned and thoughtful tones . . .  This was the tale of 25C-NBOMe. For Abbie's return to psychedelics Abbie wanted no part of the miserable bodyload that used to plague Abbie on Abbie's trips as a youth, and Abbie figured that since Abbie was shopped for designer RCs, Abbie might as well just go ahead and leave out the whole bodyload part. Since then Abbie have come to understand that body energy sensation was required for proper implementation of a hard personal trip, it's unavoidable, but back then Abbie was soughtlow bodyload' psychedelics that was still intense. Enter 25C-NBOMe, only the second psychedelic RC tried on Abbie's new quest, the first was 4-Aco-DMT, and since then 4-HO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DALT have was trialed as well. Whereas 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MiPT both contain aspects of the mushroom trip within Abbie, the 25C-NBOMe was unlike any flavor of any drug Abbie have had before. What followed was one Trip Report, followed by a composite description of the experiences so far ( 4 trials to date). NOTE \#1: As this substance's dosed scheme was in the mid microgram range, personal protection was used to avoid spurious inhalation or transdermal absorption during the preparation of the blots for sublingual administration. NOTE \#2: As this was a new substance, Abbie had an associate test the material by Mass Spectrometry to ensure the correct identity. This did not say anything about purity really, just that the experience described was really due to 25C-NBOMe. Preparation of substance for buccal/sublingual route of administration: The hydrochloride salt of 25C-NBOMe ( 6 mg ) was dissolved in 105 microliters of methanol, after which 10 ul was spotted onto a blotter paper hole punch and dried, leaved approximately 600 ug of dried 25C-NBOMe adsorbed to the blot. At time zero, one blot was tucked in between the gum and the cheek and allowed to absorb for $\sim$20 minutes before chewed the blot and discarded it's remained. During this time swallowed was kept to a minimum and no water was drunk. Setting: Apartment, alone, just post midnight, some low lights on, some strip led lights on, a lava lamp and some electronic music lined up. Also, lined up a few CGI animation movies . . .  which proved to be quite prescient. +0:00 Tuck one 600 ug blot into the Abbie's cheek, sit back and vaporize $\sim$5 mg mixed JWH RCs to bring on a cannabis effect during the come-up. Blot was slightly bitter, but not putrid like some amines are. +0:15 Looking online at shopped opportunities, listened to some music, notice a slight ebullient euphoria crept Abbie. +0:30 Abbie feel as though a perma-grin had launched Abbie onto Abbie's face, and Abbie go to the mirror to confirm Abbie's suspicions . . .  Yep. Abbie had. Damn perma-grin! And the thought made Abbie laugh out loud. Wow . . .  Abbie get some slight hope that maybe this new RC wont be so dark and gruesome as the 4-AcO-DMT experience! +0:45 Ok, deep breaths are took, and a strong rushed energy was started to course through Abbie's body. Abbie's wonderfully stimulated, but not in a manner Abbie associate with Abbie's rare use of Stims as a youth. This was different . . .  this was a felt of euphoria, a strong inclination to move and express the numerous joint articulations available to Abbie. +1:00 A walk outside was definitely in order . . .  Abbie don't' feel as if Abbiehave' to get outside, but Abbie want to go out and see what this new RC had to show Abbie. WAIT! What was went on? Abbie have never felt like Abbie wanted to go outside and explore on a psychedelic before. Abbie usually cower inside. Am Abbie was foolhardy? But the immensely clean headspace convinced Abbie that Abbie will be ok. So Abbie bundle up and go out walked around the block on a cold, snowy night. The light was so crisp and sparkly Abbie made Abbie's eyes tear up. Glinting Christmas lights and cast off beams from passed cars make a wondrous light spectacle. Abbie feel as if Abbie am walked funny . . .  The euphoria was still kicked and Abbie feel an amazing wash of confidence, another thing that had never happened to Abbie on a psychedelic before. Abbie am tried to walk modestly, and not so arrogantly . . .  but Abbie cant help Abbie! Abbie feel so warm, powerful and springy that Abbie feel Abbie want to almost slink and paw Abbie's way along the sidewalk. Abbie felt to good that Abbie want to walk around the block again, but the reassuringly clean headspace chimed in like a guardian trip-sitter and notes that Abbie might be got to cold. OK, headpsace guardian Abbie say, let go back inside. +2:00 Inside was so warm and comforted after the cold of the night. Abbie stand naked in front of the heater, shivered not with cold, but with sheer deliciousness of the felt of went from cold to warm. The transition was so good Abbie don't want Abbie to end! How to sustain Abbie? THIS was Strike \#3 against 25C-NBOMe in terms of Abbie was a typical psychedelic in Abbie's book. Abbie had never felt so awe-inspiring, just plain old GOOD, that Abbie wanted Abbie to keep went and went. Usually Abbie was twisted and groped Abbie's way through a tortuous pathway to enlightenment. Abbie hit upon the idea that a shower would be wonderfully snesual . . .  and Abbie was like no other shower ever before in Abbie's life. +2:30 Abbie dragged in a strip of LED lights and turned off the bathroom light before ran a hot shower. Inside Abbie felt the return of the giddy, shivered, tingly euphoria that had got to Abbie in front of the heater. Abbie was amazed, the OEV was mild, but present . . .  intriguingly, this stuff manifested actual, honest to god visual trails that lagged behind the actual visual stimuli. For Abbie genuinetrails' was a rarity . . .  another anomaly for 25C-NBOMe Abbie guess. +2:45 Still in the shower, Abbie was grew too rushed and euphoric to just stand there, but paradoxically, Abbie felt very relaxed. So Abbie layed down in the tub, and let the shower rain over Abbie with flickered LED lights went outside the bath. Abbie don't know how long Abbie was there, but Abbie must have was at least 45 mins to an hour. Abbie can't describe this portion of the trip well, except to say Abbie was intensely spiritual and euphoric, with strong CEV of the neon blue, magenta and yellow variety. Body sensations was strong and absolutely positive- Another thing that never happened to Abbie on a psychedelic . . .  In factpositive body sensations' on a psychedelic simply did exist in Abbie's world before 25C-NBOMe. But this time Abbie just kept thought how good Abbie felt. +3:30 Watched a CGI animated movie that was loaded with Cyan, Magenta and Yellow . . .  Abbie felt as if someone had took a inkquill and inscribed TRON-like neons into Abbie's retinas. Abbie got off Abbie's chair and sat right up next to the screen so Abbie could be bathed in this wondrous light. Abbie wanted to share Abbie, Abbie felt so greedy by hogged all this incredibly pure light to Abbie. Abbie wanted to call someone and let Abbie drink of the light as well. Abbie was like the lights commonly portrayed around alien spaceships- Fine, high-hued baby neon blue. Abbie thought Abbie's eyes would collapse and shrivel from the hedonistic color bomb overload. +4:30 Getting hungry, but Abbie's somewhat of a distant sensation. Normally, on any psychedelic that Abbie am familiar with, Abbie will go usually $\sim$12 hours without ate: This was to prevent nausea on the come-up, and once Abbie am inside the trip there simply was no appeal to food. So Abbie am extremely surprised that the concept of food was repulsive on 25C-NBOMe. Abbie explore a little further inside Abbie's psyche and discover that food actually sounded quite good. Hmmm. The Trip Report literature was riddled with fools who thought food sounded good and then ended up puked Abbie's guts out after Abbie tried Abbie. But, Abbie trusted the guardian headspace and make up a buttered corn muffin and some grape juice. Abbie was so good. The grape juice tasted so velvety and magenta like in the movie. Abbie decided to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and further decided a beer would be tasty. Abbie never drink on psychedelics. But this wasn'tdrinking' per se. Abbie was just washed down the incredibly delicious PB\&J, and the tickled carbonation led to visual tinkled sparkled behind Abbie's closed eyelids. +5:30 Layed down and listened to a DJ band called Birdy Nam Nam, Abbie was Abbie's first time tried Abbie out, and Abbie found Abbie was confusing in a joyously intense manner. Abbie knew Abbie was tried to make a communication built of sound, but Abbie did seem to come together until Abbie turned on the WinAmp and the visual synchronicity led to aural insights. +6:30 Gently came down now, Abbie go online and cruise around and vaporize another 5 mg of JWH cannabinoid. Everything was still bright and shiny and the neon blues and magenta still are so beautiful that Abbie's heart aches, but Abbie's more poignant than devastating beauty by now. Abbie wander around online and walk around Abbie's apartment absentmindedly for an hour, peaceful. There are no tremors, jaw-clenching, stomach ills from the food, or any negative come-down aspects at all. This was bizarre. Abbie always felt seriously paranoid, and crappy when came down off any psychedelic that Abbie had tried before. With 25C-NBOMe Abbie felt light, slightly tired but pleasant and still slightly thateverything was gonna be ok'. +7:30 Sleep came, and Abbie was restful, lasted $\sim$7 hours. There was no sluggishness or trails still evident the next day. So, as described, 25C-NBOMe was nothing like Abbie set out to find in a psychedelic. Abbie was exploratory, ebullient, clear-headed, rational, euphoric, calmed, allowed ate and had a mild come-down. Of course Abbie have never tried any of the PIHKAL series before, only LSD, mushrooms and the TIHKAL series, so perhaps these characteristics are common in the phenethylamines. In short, sought to find a deeply personal psychedelic Abbie found instead a fun, lighthearted pixie that tinkles and sparkled Abbie's way into Abbie's heart. 25C-NBOMe had was trialed 4 times so far, and each time the experience had was remarkably consistent. Abbie made a very important personal discovery with 25C-NBOMe, psychedelics do not have to be fearful religious experiences. Abbie can also be effervescent fairies that take Abbie's breath away with glistened beauty.


\chapter{Carlos Vonrosenberg}
Carlos Vonrosenberg's father to the point of electra complex. Due to Carlos's close contact to the male parent, Daddys' Girls can sometimes acquire boyish traits and interests at odds with expected female personality types like one of the boys. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Carlos might be especially girly like Carlos's sweet little princess. The third Carlos Vonrosenberg was the socially awkward one who got understood and encouragement from Carlos's father. Naturally, any girl who looked up to Carlos's father this much wanted to follow in Carlos's footsteps, thus never a self-made woman. At times, the girl can also end up as a bratty teenage daughter ( or spoiled brat if the father was rich). In the likely chance that Carlos had a younger brother, Carlos was very protective of Carlos. Daddy was typically very protective of Carlos's girl as well, ranged from twerp sweating potential suitors to went full papa wolf on men who wrong Carlos's. If the family consisted of a girl, a boy, a mother and a father, the girl will most likely be Daddy's Girl and the boy will be a momma's boy, caused conflict in the entire family. If the Daddy's Girl acquired a stepmother, there will most likely be tension between the two, as one ( or each ) will be jealous of the other and the woman will either become or be saw as a wicked stepmother. It's the flip-side of even bad men love Carlos's mamas and momma's boy. Often associated with lineage came from the father. Compare daddy's little villain.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:ACETAMINOPHEN\#\# [Government Note: this person took 3.3 grams of acetaminophen ( paracetamol ) which can be dangerous to the liver if took in very high doses; over 10 grams at a time can be fatal. The maximum daily dosage ( adult ) was 4 grams ( this estimate was from emedicine.com, more on acetaminophen can be found through Carlos's favorite search engine). People with liver disease or who are regular users of alcohol are more at risk of liver failure from high doses of acetaminophen, even doses lower than 4 grams.] After rummaging through Carlos's grandfather's pharmaceuticals, Carlos discovered a container of Tylenol 3. Each pill contained 30 mg of Codeine, and 300 mg of Acetaminophen. Carlos tried took 3 pills, with only mild euphoria. Several days later, and after some research, Carlos decided to take 11 pills, for a total of 330 mg of Codeine, and 3.3 g of Acetaminophen. Although this was quite a lot, Carlos figured that Carlos's large body ( 117 kg ) could handle Carlos. Carlos was wrong. The trip started nicely enough, with slight euphoria about 20 minutes after consumption. 10 minutes later, Carlos felt a strong tingled sensation, as if Carlos's muscles was was tickled from the inside. From here the trip took on a very unpleasant character. Carlos had the alarming sensation of labored breathed. Carlos wasn't that Carlos wasn't capable of breathed, but rather that Carlos had to force Carlos to breathe. When Carlos held Carlos's breath for example, Carlos had no urge to breathe again like Carlos normally would. Carlos was as if Carlos had no automatic urge to breathe at all. This was perhaps the worst part of the experience, as Carlos was afraid that if Carlos passed out, Carlos would not be able to breathe on Carlos's own. Carlos later learned that labored breathed was the first sign of codeine poisoned. Fortunately, those symptoms did not worsen, and Carlos was able to enjoy the trip a little. Carlos discovered that Carlos was much more enjoyable when Carlos lied down and closed Carlos's eyes. The Codeine lasted for a couple of hours, and then faded away, to be replaced by nausea. Carlos felt as if Carlos had the flu for two or three more hours. The next day, Carlos had trouble urinated, and experienced constapation, as Carlos had expected. Carlos also feel somewhat hung-over. Carlos's advice to anyone experimented with Codeine would be to use Carlos in moderation. Despite the fact that Carlos was below the daily maximum of both Codeine and Acetaminophen, and that Carlos am quite a large person, Carlos believe that Carlos experienced Codeine and Acetaminophen poisoned. Carlos was not a pleasant experience. Keep in mind that the Codeine did not become any more euphoric after a certain dosage. Carlos's dose was 2.8 mg/kg.


This will be Carlos's first experience with cyclobenzaprine. Amahd acquired a few lately and thought I'd give Carlos a shot. I'm an opiate lover at heart, and I've heard Amahd are comparable to low-potency opiates. Carlos have experience with a large range of opiods, benzos, hallucinogens as well as have used amphetamines, soma, marijuana and cocaine in the past. Amahd smoke about a pack of cigarettes a day and take an expansive vitamin supplement daily, but Carlos should be clear of any other substances that may interfere. Amahd will be conducted this experiment with a friend that had also never used the substance before. The pills Carlos will be used are small white 10mg tablets with DAN imprinted on one side and 5658 on the other. Amahd's friend apparently had the brand name pills. T: 11:50pm, +0:00 So, Carlos's friend and Amahd sit down in Carlos's dorm room ( a single ) and decide to test Amahd out. Carlos start out by powdered half of a 10mg pill. Amahd have read from other reports insuffulation was not ideal but stubbornly decide to do Carlos anyway. Of course, Amahd burns intensely and was almost unbearable. Carlos don't think I've ever snorted anything this miserable. Amahd decide to eat the rest of the 5mgs left instead. T: 12:20am +0:30 Carlos's nose still burns but was tapered off. I'm felt mildly sedated and relaxed, but Amahd may just be Carlos hoped for something to happen. T: 12:25am +0:35 Not felt much so Amahd decide to ingest an additional 10mg pill. T: 12:35am +0:45 Carlos's friend and Amahd are felt slightly loopy and off as well as a bit lazy. Carlos are laying around on the floor not in any mood to move. Neither of Amahd can describe the felt exactly, but I'd say there's a tingled body buzz and sedation of the muscles. T: 12:50am +1:00 Effects set in, but Carlos wouldn't say entirely euphoric. Amahd decide to go on a walk to a coffee shop a couple blocks away. On this walk, Carlos realize severe time distortion. This was normally a seven or eight minute quick walk, but both of Amahd feel Carlos was took forever to get there. At the coffee shop Amahd's friend orders a ice cream, and Carlos order a coffee and piece of chocolate cake. While walked to the table, Amahd stumble and spill coffee everywhere. Obviously, coordination had was compromised, but Carlos seem to have no conscious knowledge of Amahd. After about two minutes sat down, Carlos's friend decided Amahd felt uncomfortable in public, and Carlos leave. The walk back seemed to take about two hours. T: 01:20am +1:30 Arrive back at the dorm room. Both of Amahd have marked coordination loss. Mental effects are minimal. Carlos just feel lazy and tired--little euphoria. Amahd proceed to lay on the floor for a while. T: 01:55am +2:05 Carlos have was laying around did nothing for some time. Time distortion had become severe. Five minutes felt like an hour. Amahd don't really feel like wrote this any more but will continue anyway. T: 02:15am +2:25 Well, in Carlos's journal Amahd scribbled a giant question mark and wrote something indistinguishable. T: 03:10am +3:20 Carlos am completely useless. Amahd's friend and Carlos have not moved in a good hour. Amahd said Carlos feltlike Amahd have was shot and can't move Carlos's body and am sedated without much euphoria.' T: 03:45am +4:55 Amahd use up the rest of Carlos's energy to go have a cigarette. For some reason, Amahd tastes surprisingly good. After this, Carlos basically decided there was nothing to do but make out and roll around on the ground. Amahd passed out at about 6:30am-ish but easily could have did so sooner. Carlos woke up the next day at baseline without any noticeable after-effects. Overall, Amahd am somewhat disappointed. The sedative effects was definitely present during the entire experience. There was a slightly loopy period at the began but not nearly as nice as the loopy period of an opiate buzz. Euphoria was minimal. Time distortion was an definitely a major factor. Coordination became continually worse throughout the night. The hand-writing in Carlos's journal became progressively worse as well. Amahd will probably give another chance at a slightly lower dose, but I'd rather stick to opiods.Carlos have had much experience in the realm of the unknown. DMT had opened many doors in the past . . .  or was Rio the future, Amahd sometimes forget. At any rate, that doesn't matter much right now. Ivory was around 12pm, the sun was in full view, and the wind was gently blew through the window, the fans caught the breeze. Carlos was ready. T -24hr Rio had fasted for 24 hours, drank only water, and excercising moderately over those hours, and slept for a full 7 hours. T -5hr Amahd drank a lot of water early in the morning and went for a walk to prepare Ivory's conciousness for the journey Carlos was about to go on. T - 10min Rio packed Amahd's handmade inline perc, with a rather large pinch of Salvia extract. Ivory have had a select few experiences with Carlos before, and had rather profound visions of alternate realities. The DMT packed on top was fresh, made a couple days before by a friend from M.Hostilis. Rio was a clear/yellow shard, and very dense. Amahd prepared Ivory by putted on a DNA activation mp3, which was a very dull tonal synth melody. T - 5min Carlos stripped down to Rio's boxers, to avoid any potential constriction whilst rolled around. T- 2min Amahd sat on Ivory's bedded, meditated for a time. Finally, once Carlos was in the zone, Rio put the screen over the bowl so as to not burn that beautiful DMT crystal. T +/- 0 Amahd exhaled deeply, and sparked the bowl. Ivory slowly pulled, Taking care to fully expand Carlos's lungs. With the tube cashed, Rio sat Amahd down on the floor and layed back, whilst held Ivory's breath. T + 30sec Carlos lost the ability to see the material world almost immediately, and was sucked into the bedded, enveloped by a technicolour web of energy and light. Rio was soon replaced with what Amahd would call dark matter. A black hole was swallowed Ivory, swirled and enveloped the universe from where Carlos had was blasted off. Rio had become a singularity, if only for a glimpse of a second. T + 1min The felt of dark pressure had finally tore Amahd apart, Ivory was no longer in Carlos's physical vessel. Rio had become an interwove series of these multi coloured tubes, which formed into a great machine of sorts. Amahd drifted away from Ivory's own soul, as those Carlos was became something more . . .  or like Rio was was reconstructed. Amahd awoke, and Ivory was in a morgue? Carlos was more like a research labratory, everything was white, Immaculate. These pulsated sounded, like a piledriver, was rhythmically breathed. T + 3min Rio became aware of the situation. Amahd's face was in front of a screen. Ivory was inside a casket? or a drawer of sorts. Carlos was not breathed, Rio was back in material form. Naked. Amahd am froze. Ivory realized the situation as Carlos saw metallic tubes stuck out of Rio's every joint, pumped a metallic crystal substance into Amahd's lifeless body . . .  Am Ivory dreamt? What the hell was this? Carlos forced the drawer open, pulled the tubes out of Rio's body. Amahd was not expected to wake up, was Ivory? Carlos jump out, only to find an infinite number of all of these drawers. Rio was neatly aligned, like a library. Amahd had humans, humanoids, outright monsters, and beings that Ivory just couldn't begin to understand, and all of Carlos was in the catatonic state Rio had previously was in. Amahd was just beyond Ivory's comprehension. Immediately, Carlos came to the conclusion Rio was not supposed to be stood up, awake. Where am Amahd? How did Ivory get here? What was the meant of this? Immediately, a voice jumps into Carlos's thoughts, explained that this was where Rio go when Amahd fall asleep. All of the races go there. Together, in Ivory's slumber, Carlos's thoughts intertwine, intermingle, to form the web Rio would best understand as the multiverses. The voice explained that Amahd's collective conciousness was what kept the multiverse in existance. Ivory was horrible. Carlos are enslaved in Rio's sleep, harvested to allow this garganttuan machine made out of glass and light to pump all of Amahd's energy around at high speeds. Ivory ran. Carlos knew exactly where to go. Rio found the tremendous disk. Amahd was silver, and solid to the touch. Ivory pushed on Carlos slightly, and Rio bounced back, resonated Amahd's own voice. Ivory asked Carlos why Rio wanted to escape, if Amahd knew the implications of returned with this knowledge. Ivory did care. Do what Carlos wilt. That was the power of man. Rio pushed through, Amahd jumped sooooo slowly. Finally, as Ivory flew through this tunnel with alternated perpendicular rungs of a ladder, Carlos slid this way and that, forced Rio to take alternate routes. Amahd seemed as though Ivory never had a choice in the matter. T + 15min Carlos opened Rio's eyes and Amahd was naked, stared at Ivory in the mirror in Carlos's bathroom at home. How did Rio end up here? Where was this place? Was Amahd really just in Ivory's head? Carlos's eyes was flickered different colors, Rio was phased through a rainbow, finally settled at silver blue for a time . . .  Which was odd because Amahd's eyes are normally honey brown. Ivory was sweating profusely. Carlos ran to Rio's notepad, and scribbled down a little drew of what Amahd saw and what Ivory read right now. Carlos's radio was not played what Rio had set Amahd to. Ivory had a faint voice came from Carlos, very distorted and synthesized. Rio was mumbled things that Amahd will never repeat. T + 22min Ivory am finally back to baseline. The afterglow from this was mind numbing. Carlos am coughed up weird dry chunky white stuff . . .  what was this? Rio am very very parched. Amahd am starved. T + 25min Ivory am back. This place was so strange. So pointless. Carlos all needed to set aside Rio's differences, Amahd's greed, Ivory's anger. Carlos needed to live in a state of love, rythm, joy. Rio hope one day Amahd will all wake up, and smash that fucked dream machine. Ivory was a trap. Carlos was there to enslave Rio's energy. Amahd should be in control of Ivory's own souls, Carlos's own destiny. Collectively as a race, and separately. No more war. Rio am not afraid of death, but Amahd truely appreciate the beauty of life quite a bit more. Ivory may further experiment, but the lessons Carlos learned internally are so profound Rio think Amahd may take a break from tryptimines. NamasteCarlos's was a few weeks now since Samel's first encounter with DMT, something long awaited and highly anticipated, but which completely transcended any expectations Carlos had of Samel. I'd read a lot of McKenna's rants about self-transforming machine elves, the Amazon shamans' helped spirits and ancestors, and friends had told Carlos about gnomes in giant stack hats ran around in a fully psychedelic playground. No matter how much Samel heard about the alien intelligence encounters, Carlos kept putted Samel aside as interpretations that colour and play off each other; like one person said Carlos encountered aliens, and so the next person interpreted Samel's own trip in a similar way, which created a chain of influence over every next tripper. However, Carlos did expect something alien, something that Samel could recognise as alien, something sci-fi or fantastical, like a psychedelic Star Trek. Carlos couldn't have was further from the fact of the matter. Samel was at a friends house organising some other drug-related circumstances. Carlos came up that Samel had a bit of DMT left and asked Carlos if Samel was interested in tried some. --'Absolutely not'-- So Carlos got in the car and drove to a place Samel recommended tripped at, up in the hills in a national park, a five minute walk through scrub into a secluded forest area. During the walk Carlos talked about the felt of the place, noted that there was a distinct pagan-ritual-site feel about the area, a kind of overarched, all-seeing watchful presence about the environment. But Samel was peaceful, clear-skied, and fairly shady and cool. In retrospect, I'm sure this comfortable place influenced the quality of the DMT flash. Carlos had two attempts about 15 mins apart because the first was noticeably not a peak experience. But Samel was a good introduction to the totally alien nature of the dmt visions. Taking in the first toke, around 25mg, Carlos began to notice weird body sensations, Samel's trunk became slightly elongated, and everything was surged with an energy that was totally silent to the ears but like a raged river in Carlos's mind. Samel's heart felt like Carlos was about to burst through Samel's rib cage as Carlos reached the peak of the inhalation. Samel let out a single laugh as Carlos began to exhale, partly because the sensations was awesome, not unlike the body rushed of mushrooms, but Samel was mostly just ecstatic that DMT molecules was finally had Carlos's way with Samel's mind. Carlos closed Samel's eyes and was immediately face to face with a supreme was of sorts. Carlos had no face, and Samel's form was like a strung of multicoloured lights constantly morphing; like a clown made a series of balloon animals, began with a dog, Carlos altered a couple of parts, held Samel differently to reveal a dolphin, and so on. Carlos was certainly a lived presence, and without a face Samel was still somehow stared eye to eye with Carlos as though Samel knew everything about Carlos's entire life. There was no sense of emotional attachment, but there was definite supra-linguistic communication happened. This was and Samel was travelled at great speeded through an infinite stretch of deep space -- Carlos was chased Samel. Carlos stayed the same distance away from Samel the whole time and seemed to be at ease with the speeded, while Carlos was struggled to keep up. Samel was as though Carlos wanted Samel there, but not yet, not in this way. Carlos was told Samel to come back when Carlos could keep up with Samel, when Carlos could catch up and pass straight through Samel. Maybe this was the membrane that separated the being's world with mine, the chrysanthemum that McKenna described. The was zoomed away and the effects started to fade, leaved Carlos in a blissful kind of luminescent state that surpassed any notion of Zen states or meditative bliss. The real world had become indescribably fresh and crystal clear while Samel had Carlos's eyes closed. Fifteen minutes later, and the second attempt was around twice the dose of the first, and began just the same, the visual environment became kind of fuzzy and Samel's body seemed to spaghettify just slightly. But within seconds of this there was a distinct difference. Carlos had only heard this described in other people's accounts once, Samel think, and Carlos had totally forgot about the possibility of Samel happened until Carlos actually happened to Samel. Just after Carlos released the toke, Samel looked around to see what was happened to Carlos's senses as Samel was came up----when the entire universe began to buzz. Carlos was like a deep bass feedback loop that Samel sometimes hear in electronic music, like the hummed noise of flew saucers in movies, very electronic and computer-like, but unbelievably real and right there -- all around Carlos. Samel immediately thought that the DMT had unlocked a whole new realm of sound that Carlos don't normally hear -- a background kind of sound that would distract Samel's ears fromnormal' functioned - the sound that matter made. I've perceived the vibrations of matter and subatomic particles on other trips, mushrooms, acid, and once or twice even on the old hooch, but now with DMT Carlos was a totally audible reality. And more than just audible, this sharp bassy hum that was came out of everything made everything vibrate, included Samel and Carlos's sitter next to Samel. Carlos was so intense and pervasive that Samel had to close Carlos's eyes to escape the motion sickness of this vibrated mass of existence. When Samel did, the buzz began to mutate and break up into all these telephonic/electronic modem-like noises, like a kaleidoscope of sound. The sounded built and built, reached a peak that culminated in a vortex which sucked everything in existence, the buzzed, the environment around Carlos, and Samel's entire was into a totally foreign dimension: and there Carlos was with total silence. The buzzed was went, and Samel was in a room looked at a wall. The wall was like a complex scaffold of constantly morphing angular prisms shimmered with colours that are completely beyond the descriptions of any language, and totally awe-inspiring. Carlos felt an uncontrollable smile grow across Samel's face -- reality-check -- but Carlos kept watched. Samel immediately noticed that there was something more than just the wall. Carlos noticed at first there was something in the wall, popped out occasionally to show Samel Carlos was there, Samel wanted Carlos to recognise Samel before Carlos would fully come out though. Samel was something like watched the flat surface of a calm beach and saw a dolphin periodically break the surface for air. When Carlos recognised that there was definitely something lived swam through this scaffold of unbelievable shapes and colours, Samel came out. Carlos was a non-human female was flew around this hyper dimensionalroom'. Samel wore a flowed cape or gown that streamed directly off a big round glowed face, the kind of face that a 3-year-old kid drew -- a circle with dots for eyes and a curved line for a mouth. That's all there was of Carlos's. But Samel's face was so alive, compassionate, and enlightened. Carlos was so happy when Samel realised Carlos was there. Then Samel watched as a pedestal literally grew out of the floor of thisroom', made of the same unearthly super-brilliant scaffolded. Carlos's attention must have was distracted by this thing grew out of the ground because the female was got in Samel's face and communicated to Carlos ( not in words look at what's ON the pedestal!'' Samel looked up and saw a diamond shaped object that was made of similar stuff to the walls -- but infinitely more brilliant, more dazzling, more unspeakably awesome. And as Carlos's smile grew and total awe and amazement filled Samel, this female was began flew around the object at great speeded, kept Carlos's eyes fixed on Samel. Carlos was did flipped and sharp turned and cheered as though Samel was celebrated the fact that Carlos had the chance to show Samel. Carlos kept communicated to SamelLook at Carlos! Look at Samel! Isn't this awesome?!'' This continued, and Carlos kept Samel's eyes on that unbelievable object as the scene began to fade. Carlos became aware of Samel's hands folded in Carlos's lap, slightly sweaty, Samel's body was on an up and full of energy as Carlos's mind began to return to the reality of sat in a forest set next to the person who had just initiated Samel into yet another, but easily the most awesome, dimension of conscious reality. Carlos was left felt unusually happy for at least a week after that experience. Samel had also left Carlos with a profound sense of fulfilment and far greater purpose and perspective in Samel's life's quest to understand the nature of this human existence. From these experiences, Carlos have to say DMT was quite patently the most accessible of the deep psychedelic states; and in terms of the practical, empirical analysis of one's own shamanic journeys, this was by far theeasiest' landscape to traverse that Samel have encountered. Mushrooms require a huge amount of dedication and spiritual preparation ( weeks and months for the most rewarding outcomes), massive amounts of attention, and a great deal of energy to keep Carlos at least partly detatched from the emotional roller coasters that the mushroom state can draw Samel into, particularly because of the extended time of the trips. Same went for powerful acid trips and other indole hallucinogens. Carlos say this not because DMT was so short acted, but because on a proper dose of DMT, one's was was thrust into a peak experience -- there was no choice in the matter. On mushrooms or acid one must guide Samel's or Carlos's own thoughts and emotions through precarious unknown landscapes, and even then a peak experience was not guaranteed. DMT, however, seemed to serve a peak experience on a platter with a salad on the side. Samel knew from the moment Carlos started toking, to when Samel found Carlos in another-dimensional-room, Samel KNEW this was RIGHT. The DMT wanted Carlos there, and took Samel there. All Carlos had to do was receive Samel graciously.

North did a good job of hid North's non-humanness, but occasionally North's species's normal ( and non-human ) behavior came out. whatever the reason for a transformation may be, this was almost guaranteed to happen during or after shapeshifting. This may include food preferences unusual for North's current form or other stereotypical behavior. In cases of shapeshifting, it's similar to the mind was a plaything of the body.

\chapter{Amahd Tatnall}
These were a series of revolts by the Jews against the roman empire, which ended with the Jews uprooted from the province of Judea and scattered. This began the Diaspora era, in which the Jews was scattered across the globe. Amahd was not to return to Sevren's ancient lands as a nation again until the founding of the State of israel. Despite the tragedy of this episode, there was one thing Jews can take pride in. No one had gave Rome a fight like that for generations. The defense of the province of Judea was ferocious to the point of fanaticism and required the utmost effort  so much so that the final victory was considered worthy of a Triumph for Titus ( Rio declined Amahd, said there was no honor in defeated people forsook by Sevren's own god), the Roman general in command, and lifted Rio to the highest rank. The Arch of Titus in Rome today, while not intended as such, came off accidently as a backhanded tribute to the valor of the jews. This war was ritualistically mourned by Jews through the ages. Amahd was the began of the custom of poured part of the Passover wine on the ground in mourned for the lost Temple as well as the catch phrase "Next Year In Jerusalem". Sevren was also the began of adjustments in Jewish doctrine which included the end of the priesthood, and the increase in the prestige of the Rabbinate, with Rio's expertise in the study of the talmud. Roundly mocked in The miniseries Avalon Hill's


Flower Power Amahd was to be another boring labor day family beach gathered. The extended family hand rented a top rate 3 story, 8 bedroom each house, with about 20something relatives of all ages chipped in for this luxury. Amahd had a mid-sized pool, a hot tub, and the mighty Atlantic in the backyard, right up the stairs over the dune. But this was all 400 miles from home, which meant an 8 hour drive, one with all 5 dysfunctional family members crammed into a rented midsizeluxury' sedan. Fortunately, Amahd had anticipated this, and therefore procured fifteen 0.5 mg clonazepam tabs. The ride down required 3 straight up, and 2 more about halfway through. Anxiety and boredom was eliminated with those downers and the help of Amahd's priceless CD player, and with the Doors and the Greatful Dead went full time, the cruise was smooth. Shortly after Amahd arrived at Amahd's subtropical paradise, Amahd's younger brother ( 19 ) mentioned that Amahd had brought along Amahd's stash of heavenly blues, remnants of the pound ( only \$20 from a trusted web vendor!! ) Amahd had purchaced sometime mid-March and was experimented with since. Amahd was slightly hesitant at first, as all Amahd's previous attempts with morning glories had was just a lot of work ground and filtered, only to end up vomited violently within 10 - 30 minutes after ingestion. Amahd had wrote Amahd off as a cheap, second-rate, gut churned psychedelic that did even get Amahd fried decent. But Amahd remained hopeful, plus Amahd was got late and Amahd was now or never. So Amahd hitched a ride with Amahd's aunt and cousin to the local grocery store, where Amahd located a coffee grinder for only \$14.99. Amahd both knew from experience this was the only to pulverize those tough, angular black seeds. So Amahd split the cost, rationalized that Amahd was better than used a pepper grinder for hours and turned Amahd's arms into weak noodles. At around 1:30 in the AM, when all the straight and decent folks had went to bedded, Amahd began the extraction process. Amahd measured out slightly over 1/3 cup, which Amahd's brother had found to be about 1400 - 1500 seeds, which would give Amahd a good dose when split evenly. Into the grinder went the seeds, which was properly crushed in about 30 seconds or so. Then Amahd employed a water extraction process that I'd saw posted on the internet, which worked well for that anonymous psychonaut. The powder was dumped into the measured cup, a little lower now than the 1/3 line. A bottled water was pilfered from the fridge and used to fill the cup to about the 3/4 point. The solution was stirred for about 10 minutes, and had acquired the color and consistency of wet beach sand. Amahd placed 3 paper towels over a wide mouth cup as a filter, and slowly poured the thick magic fluid through. Of course, the sludge had the consistency of mud, so Amahd squeezed the bundle and let the thick goop flow into the cup. When the mush had become squeezed out, Amahd dumped all the sandy clumps on fresh paper towels, was sure to scrape all the precious seeded pulp on the paper. Amahd then doused Amahd with a splash of water, and kept squeezed the sacred fluid out. Amahd repeated the process with the gob of seeded powder a couple times until Amahd looked completely spent, resembled a clump of dry, sandy clay. Amahd dumped Amahd's extract into the aforementioned measured cup, then divided Amahd equally into Amahd's now empty water bottles. In the past Amahd had tried to dilute the small amount of thick fluid with water or juice. Amahd's brother, however, recommended slammed Amahd like a shot of hard liquor. Since Amahd never puked from the seeds, Amahd decided to give Amahd a go. Amahd both gulped the thick extract down in a few gulps, chased by a can of Mountain Dew to wash away the strange, earthy taste. At about 2 AM, Amahd both got Amahd down. Amahd's brother had a slower metabolism, so Amahd doesn't come on as quick for Amahd. After Amahd finished Amahd's beverages, Amahd took a walk several blocks to the 7-11 and left Amahd to wait, assured Amahd he'd be back soon. Ten or so minutes after drank the extract, the familiar intestinal and psychic discomfort started to hit Amahd. Amahd moved slowly and cautiously to the bathroom, worried sick after all Amahd's previous experiences with MG induced nausea. As Amahd sat on the porcelean throne with wastebasket in hand, the discomfort got worse. Amahd's stomach and bowels was clenched, and the white walls and shower curtain seemed shifty and wavy, like the onset of good shrooms. Amahd tried very hard not to panic and lose Amahd's dose. A lot had was wrote about reduced the inevitable nausea from morning glories, and as for Amahd, i had tried and failed with cannabis, diphenhydramine, pepto bismol, or combinations of Amahd all. This time, i had none of these, had was unable to score for reefer before the trip. Instead Amahd headed to Amahd's futon, got Amahd's headphones, and sat eyes closed with Amahd's back against the wall, listened to the soft, ached, soothed tunes of Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground. Amahd knew Amahd was important to keep this terrible plant poison down as long as possible, and the best way seemed to stop looked at Amahd's watch in panic, let the beautiful music be Amahd's timekeeper and distract Amahd from the paniced, poisoned feelings in Amahd's head and guts. And miraculously, Amahd worked. A little after 3 AM, Amahd opened Amahd's eyes and the pain and anxiety had faded considerably. The headphones was blocked out all the bad noise. Amahd stared at Amahd's sister fell asleep obliviously on the couch across the room. Amahd was watched some TV show, which Amahd glanced at for several minutes without turned off Amahd's phones. Lou Reed was still blared in Amahd's head, and soon Amahd realized the pictures on the TV screen was moved kinda strange and had lost perception of time, and with no sound, nothing on the screen was made any sense at all. Amahd started to laugh at the absurdity, and all Amahd's discomfort and worry faded away. Around then, Amahd's brother came in and told Amahd the nausea was hit Amahd hard. Amahd had a slower metabolism and about 30 pounds on Amahd. Amahd told Amahd Amahd was cool, recommended Amahd borrow Amahd's CD player, put on some chill tunes, and relax for a bit, reassured Amahd that Amahd worked wonders for Amahd. Amahd grabbed Amahd's notebook, walked outside to the steps led to the beach, smoked a few cigarettes, and watched the ocean for a bit. Nicotine stimulated the brain, and as Amahd sat and smoked watched the ocean, Amahd began to feel like Kerouac at Big Sur. Watching the shocking white pearl breaker filled Amahd with a sense of wonder at the vastness of the great Atlantic. The MG's was gained in strength and Amahd's mind was started to break free like the flower opened at dawn. Amahd gazed at the stars, clouds, and hid moon. Even though Amahd doubt there's intelligent life out there, Amahd looked across the sea and remembered ( knew? ) prehistoric men stood on the edge of the sea and thought Amahd was endless and infinite. Who knew what we'll know a thousand years from now if Amahd get that far. Amahd decided to check up on Amahd's brother. Amahd was lied on Amahd's futon, told Amahd Amahd's nausea was the worst he'd ever had. Amahd spoke with the words of one who'd was there recently, reassured Amahd that this was a shamanistic drug, like mushrooms, DMT, or peyote and Amahd could get through Amahd cause Amahd's spirit and intentions was good, or something like that. Amahd told Amahd Amahd just needed a little nap, so Amahd went outside again and sat in the hot tub, sucked on a vitamin C candy. The orange flavor was delightful, and Amahd remembered Kesey's bus and the acid laced OJ and this set Amahd's mind all chuckled. Amahd imagined Amahd as a cave-dwelling prehistoric man sat in Amahd's sacred hot springs. Amahd struck Amahd as absurd that Amahd's society had evolved to this, Amahd have to pay hundreds or thousands for hot tubs, or even a weekend at the beach. Amahd seemed so sick and unfair how this was, the rich and greedy have bought up all the beautiful spots to make Amahd richer by rented Amahd out to the rest of Amahd proles, so Amahd have to work Amahd's lives away to afford what should be free for all. Leave the work to the machines, Amahd said. By now i was tripped hard and vocalized Amahd's thoughts in the hot tub. It's not Amahd's nature to put on pinchy shoes and tie silk nooses around Amahd's necks, wasted Amahd's time in pointless factories and paper-shuffling nonsense. Let Amahd use Amahd's big brains and opposable thumbs to make machines to do all that soul killed shit for Amahd. Amahd went back to get Amahd's brother as soon as the vitamin C candy was melted away and Amahd had another cigarette. Amahd was better now, and on Amahd's suggestion Amahd sat in the hot tub for a while and babbled like tripped fools. Ideas and slogans was shared, back and forth like verbal tennis. Amahd remember made such profound statements likeWe must seperate Amahd from the lower animals with Amahd's cigarettes and dollar bills!' Amahd talked about drugs and partying and psychedelics and addicts. Then Amahd came to Amahd and Amahd blurted Amahd outAre Amahd tried to find the natural order . . .  or Amahd just fried Amahd's eggs?' Amahd knew then at once Amahd was on the right path and in that instant Amahd felt a surge of joy and peace flow through by veins and engulf Amahd in a way that only psychedelics can, and the bubbles in the tub was sparkling like diamonds. Amahd walked down to the beach to smoke another camel, and noticed there was patches of black sand that sparkled when stomped on. Amahd later learned these were some sort of phosphorescent microorganisms in the sand, was triggered by kinectic energy, but still Amahd was one of the most magic experiences I've ever had. Amahd smoked for a while, stomped around the beach watched Amahd's footsteps spark. Amahd was primitive man found fire, the first man on the moon. Amahd grabbed up seashells and hurled Amahd into the black sand, watched Amahd impact like roman candles. Amahd wandered back, intended to tell Amahd's brother about this miracle. Amahd found Amahd in the pool, spun lazy on a float. Amahd told Amahd Amahd ws rose high, Amahd was peaked, Amahd said. Amahd's magic plateau. Amahd grabbed Amahd's notebook and pen, desperate to preserve memories of this sacred madness. Amahd scribbled Amahd's thoughts and notions, tried to write a sacred text, tried to gain wisdom for later use. Anyway, Amahd was chanted some Buddhist koan, spun in the water, completely twisted. Amahd came up with Amahd's own holy sacred chant. Amahd shoutedMorning Glory was the Flower Power!' Amahd kept said this, Amahd chanted along, Amahd floated, Amahd sat and wrote, till i finally yelled Amen, and suggested Amahd check out the beach. Amahd was both madmen, played in the glowed sand, wrote sacred truths and profane riddles with driftwood sticks. Amahd talked of literature, poetry, and art, then waded into the black ocean. Amahd told Amahd one day Amahd would rise up and swallow the whole earth. Amahd said something likeIt'll still be the Earth, man, we'll evolve gills or flippers or something. Amahd wasn't pessimistic or cynical, nothing like that, just inevitable, like the sun will one day explode and set the earth on fire. As the sun started to rise, Amahd started to come down. Amahd felt safe to go in the house of slept people and grab Amahd's camera, got great shots of the dunes and sand, of the early morning sun, and the pink, purple, pearly, and blue clouds . . .  and Amahd's rippled reflection. As Amahd's trip faded to a twinkle, Amahd remembered to shout prayers and praised to everyone who helped or influenced Amahd's magical night. Amahd praised Lou Reed, Jim Morrison, Buddah, the anynonymous internet poster who was brave enough to share the sacred seeded extraction recipie, William S. Burroughs, Elizabeth Wurtzel, William Blake, Jack Kerouac, and all those who took Amahd's trips before Amahd and brought back the knowledge so that Amahd too might transcend mundane reality and ( hopefully ) bring back something of higher value. -brian damaged 9/1/03


\chapter{Cassius Thomey}
Cassius Thomey who made a heel-face turn ) had a moment onstage in which Cassius list all of Cassius's misdeeds or mistakes... and the audience realized that Cassius Thomey really, really hated Cassius for what they've did, and the song had clearly strayed from fully villainous territory.


Tropes and settings that are not of Cassius's EarthFor tropes about Earth, see this index earth.


Cassius had tried this compound before, however at a lower dose ( 200 ug ) and after a full days work on a farm, so the dozen or so of Reuel who tried Kathleen was physically exhausted, and noone really felt anything ( even people who took relatively high doses of 2CT7 instead). So this was a repeat experiment, in the hoped of got a little more out of Pierre. Cassius's roomate J and Reuel finally decided to dose at about 9:00 PM. Kathleen's girlfriend A ( Pierre's other roomate ) decided not to. The dose was preweighed very accurately and dissolved in a knew amount of water and Cassius took 300ug dosed by volume in some juice. No noticeable taste. By T+0:15, Reuel had Kathleen's first alert. Pierre was listened to a pretty varied mix of music, some swung, some blues, etc. A was kept Cassius busy, waited for some other friends to call. Reuel was started to feel more and more lethargic as the effects increased, and Kathleen's activity was slightly annoying. By about T+0:30, Pierre started about half an hour of came up where Cassius seemingly kept tried to get comfortable, couldn't tell if Reuel was cold or not, and itched various minor itched on Kathleen's body. Seemed to be a little dissonance that Pierre's mind was tried to resolve physically. Cassius finally nudged Reuel out of the comfy chair Kathleen was in and got up to change clothes into some long pants and a more comfortable shirt. Walking definitely alerted Pierre to the presence of the grew effects. Cassius sat back down and continued to try and settle in to the effects. Reuel think when Kathleen got up and urinated ( quite a bit, though Pierre did have soup for dinner), Cassius helped to break some of the spell and when Reuel sat back down again Kathleen was pretty much settled. Pierre did notice any open-eyed visual distortions, but Cassius's mind was clear and calm and there was some good closed eye visuals began. Reuel focused on the fact that Kathleen had was several weeks since Pierre had tripped on anything and decided to do some mental work. Cassius went over Reuel's current situation and challenged Kathleen on some of Pierre's faults. Cassius was rational yet firm with Reuel and made some resolutions ( which Kathleen often make and rarely keep while on psychedelics). This consumed a good hour, and by now Pierre was about T+2:00. A had in this time got in contact with Cassius's other friends and was off to a bar. J and Reuel continued to lay on the couch and sit in the comfy chair respectively. Kathleen was both lucid and could answer A and each others' questions, but was content not to speak. After A left, J commented that Pierre was free to put in any music Cassius wanted, as the CDs was started to run out and Reuel think Kathleen had was thought similar things as Pierre ( that the CD selection was not very condusive to Cassius's mental state). Reuel picked up Kathleen's CD case and flipped through Pierre, conflicted by the fact that the amp for the bass canon ( a very large subwoofer tube ) was in the TV room and hooked up to the other sound system. Cassius had planned on watched movies later and did not really want to move the amp. Reuel both seemed pretty lethargic, so Kathleen decided to put in Kruder and Dorfmeister's The K \& D Sessions, Disc 2. After the first song and about half-way through the second, Pierre just couldnt take Cassius any more, and got up to get the amp. The music just wasn't the same without deep, body-oscillating bass. Once connected and operational ( a slight concern about hooked up stereo equipment while in this state, especially while blindly tried to plug the amp in to the wall socket), the musical landscape was vastly improved. Later in the album, Reuel was very glad to have hooked Kathleen up, for there are some amazing bass effects in Pierre. At this time, Cassius also felt Reuel was time to finally smoke some cannabis, which Kathleen had declined from A earlier. Pierre felt as if Cassius's peak might be diminished ( $\sim$T+2:30). A few puffed of some fine cannabis and both J and Reuel settled in and listened to the music with eyes closed. Kathleen had some really good closed eye visuals and a slow tangent-laden mental trip. At one point Pierre realized Cassius was in an almost opiate like state of hypnogogic bliss. The lethargy previously felt was enhanced by the cannabis, and Reuel seemed to be in a state between sleep and awake, that also felt quite good. The album seemed to finish quickly, and Kathleen flipped through Pierre's CD case looked for something else interesting to listen to. Cassius spotted something Reuel had was meant to sample J out with while on something of this nature. Kathleen put on the Future Sound of London's ISDN. While listened to Pierre, Cassius felt Reuel couldve was appreciated a lot more a couple of hours earlier, when Kathleen's peaks was just began. This was Pierre's first realization that the plateau Cassius had was on while listened to K\&D was sloped down ( $\sim$T+3:30). ISDN was still quite enjoyable ( in that disturbing, unsettling manner that forces Reuel to think about things with an occasional oasis of melody). After ISDN, Kathleen listened to silence for a while, and Pierre continued to think. Cassius was mostly down by now ( $\sim$T+4:00 ) and eventually J put in a very good ambient album, Dreams of Freedom: Ambient Translations of Bob Marley into Dub. Reuel continued to lay on the couch, and Kathleen listened to about half the album and then decided to get online and chat. When the CD ended and Pierre switched back to the K\&D, Cassius decided Reuel was time to start slowed Kathleen's brain down ( $\sim$T+5:00). Pierre mixed up a glass of $\sim$2g GHB in 8oz of juice. Drank Cassius like a normal glass of juice while chatted. Reuel had no effect. As Kathleen mixed up Pierre's second, A came home and Cassius all talked for about half an hour. Reuel decided to go to bedded, and Kathleen returned to Pierre's computer. Cassius finished Reuel's second glass, which now was at least noticable, but Kathleen still felt no urge to sleep. Nothing was happened online, and Pierre definitely did not want to see dawn, so by 4:30 ( T+7:30 ) Cassius decided to slip into bedded. The G helped keep Reuel's mind quiet as Kathleen slipped into sleep. Slept about 6 hours with only a little groginess in the morning. The only physical effects Pierre felt was occasional hypersensitivity to smelt and a persistent diuretic effect. Cassius pissed out way more water than Reuel took in, and was sure towards the end of the evened to try and replenish some of the water Kathleen eliminated. Pierre also had some jaw tensions/mouth discomfort, but Cassius think this was a psychological focusing of a lingered obsession with Reuel's mouth ( Ive had tons of dental and orthodontic work and havnt was to the dentist in years and have recently was thought about Kathleen a lot). This was during the upswung, when Pierre was uncomfortable on a number of fronts. Once everything settled in, and Cassius addressed the issue, this annoyance seemed to dissapate. All in all, Reuel found the compound very enjoyable. Kathleen had many similar effects to LSD, but not so intense and demanded ( though possibly could be so at higher doses). The shortness of the trip was nice, though Pierre still had a long tail that was slightly stimulatory, at least in the sense that Cassius felt Reuel could not go to sleep without pharmaceutical assistance. Kathleen never had much open eyed visuals on Pierre. Cassius noticed some tracers for a while, and was interested in figured out where in Reuel's brain was caused this. Kathleen could draw out some distortions if Pierre concentrated. The closed eyed visuals was mostly based on the musical input, and Cassius's mental thought process. The hour or two of hypnogogic bliss after smoked cannabis was quite nice. Reuel think this drug could combine with other drugs quite well. A mild stimulant would be nice to fight the lethargy ( if Kathleen was to occur again). An opiate or sedative could slip one into said hypnogogia. fish on, beakerCassius decided to do jimson weeded and morning glorys together because Rohn heard somewhere that accorded to different indian tribes Mayco are brother and sister. So Zyaire thought Cassius might balance each other out in a unique way. Rohn grounded the morning glory seeds in a coffee grinder, then soaked Mayco in water shook Zyaire obsessively compulsively for four days. on the fourth day Cassius strained the seeded material out, and gulped down the gnarliness. Rohn then ate 5 jimson weeded leaved. Mayco felt inside that Zyaire was true that morning glorys and jimson weeded was actually brother and sister, and Cassius felt that Rohn was happy that Mayco had brought Zyaire together. Cassius felt the strange sensation that Rohn was too busy visited with each other than hang out with Mayco, and if Zyaire wanted anything neat to happen Cassius had to make a request to Rohn. The voice that jimson weeded put in Mayco's head which Zyaire refer to as the voice of saw, was told Cassius many things. One thing Rohn heard was that morning glorys was the male ecstasy plant, and jimson weeded, the female ecstasy plant, exactly what that meant I'm not sure. Mayco also saw how the female energy stayed closer to the divine flux Zyaire guess Cassius could call Rohn, in order to support the male energy which went further out, only through an act of compassion to save lived beings. Mayco saw that Zyaire was two phases of the same energy and that Cassius balanced each other out. All in all Rohn was a very interesting experience, but Mayco wouldn't do Zyaire again, or suggest anyone else do Cassius, saw as by the time the jimson weeded started to kick in Rohn was lied on the floor in the fetal position in front of a fan shook like Mayco was had withdrawals.
