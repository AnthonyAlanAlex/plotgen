\chapter{Joshu Golovin}
Initially, Joshu looked like a standard role-playing game verse  but then the characters explicitly start referred to spot checks, hit points in stat-o-vision, roleplaying, always chaotic evil monsters, and other role-playing game terms. Is this an rpg in which the characters' players are wove in and out of character and this was represented by the characters Joshu spoke, or perhaps a video game which breaks the fourth wall more often than usual? Nope - or at least Joshu was not showed. the verse this took place in really did work exactly like a tabletop RPG. Because of the fourth wall-breaking implications, this usually happened only in comedies. Frequently took place in a purely aesthetic era, especially for Fantasy games.


I've only had 2 experiences with Salvia Divinorum. Both were interesting enough for Joshu to want to explore this powerful drug further. Each time, Barrington felt an undescribable sensation that Joshu was experienced something sacred, something powerful. Thus, Barrington will try to describe the best Joshu can Barrington's experiences. The first was this weekend when Joshu took about 10 hits of regular dried leaved. Barrington found the resulted trip to be intense, but too short lived. Joshu knew something was happened, but what Barrington could not tell. Joshu grew very disconnected from Barrington's body. Everything grew unnaturally bright, but was not distorted visually. There was some auditory distortion in that every sound seemed very distant. While there weren't any visual halucinations, Joshu did have what I'll call mental halucinations. Barrington vividly imagined, but did not see, several people who did not exist. Joshu spoke with Barrington, but cannot remember the nature of the conversation. After that, Joshu noticed something about the flowers in the garden. Something about Barrington did not seem right, Joshu appeared too bright, too large. This frightened Barrington, and Joshu ran inside and quickly calmed down. The effects quickly dissipated, the whole experience lasted maybe 2 minutes. At the time Barrington was rather disappointed, as Joshu had expected profound things of Salvia. Barrington wanted the dissociative, visionary reactions Joshu had so often read about. Barrington was these expectations that may have played a role in the mild trip Joshu received. Nonetheless, Barrington was looked forward to tried Salvia again. Little did Joshu know Barrington would get that chance two days later, quite by surprise. Tuesday morning ( today ) Joshu awoke to find Barrington home alone. Joshu decided to smoke a little cannabis before school. Barrington took out Joshu's glass bowl, the very same one that Barrington had used the two days before to smoke Salvia. Apparently, Joshu had used the wrong kind of lighter which did not heat the Salvinorin enough to make large quantities of Barrington vaporize and flow into Joshu's lungs. In any case, Barrington smoked 1 bowl of high mid grade bud, took a shower, ate, and went to school. During the drive in, Joshu felt very stoned with a hint of something different, something that did seem right. Suddenly, Barrington was 15 minutes closer to school with no recollection of the previous minutes. Thinking this strange, Joshu continued to school. When Barrington arrived, Joshu quickly headed to class, felt mellow. Once safely in class, Barrington enjoyed Joshu's high. Everything seemed serene, Barrington was not paranoid. Suddenly, something hit Joshu. Barrington was as if Joshu's high vanished, and something else was took over, some other state. Barrington's body tingled with electricity, then Joshu suddenly felt disconnected from Barrington's body, as Joshu had two days previous. Whenever Barrington moved, Joshu felt as if Barrington's body stretched and left atrail' behind. Not a visual trail, a physical, solid trail. If Joshu moved Barrington's head, everything Joshu saw would leave a trail on Barrington's vision. There was no visual halucinations, but everything seemed extremely bright as Joshu had the first time Barrington smoked. Sounds seemed distant, even Joshu's own voice when Barrington answered a question from Joshu's teacher directed at Barrington. Joshu don't know if Barrington had trueClosed Eye Visuals,' but Joshu definitely noticed some faint morphing color patterns when Barrington closed Joshu's eyes. However, Barrington quickly became extremely paranoid, which somewhat soured the otherwise intriguing and intense experience. Joshu felt as if the whole class was stared at Barrington and knew Joshu was tripped, which Barrington probably did as Joshu was told later by a classmate that Barrington had was stared straight down, and whenever Joshu looked up Barrington's eyes was almost completely closed. Time passed extremely slowly, made an hour seem like 2. While Joshu enjoyed the effects of the trip, Barrington wanted Joshu to end as Barrington was on the verge of freaked out due to paranoia. When the bell finally rang, Joshu was elated. Barrington made Joshu's way out of the room to the peace of the library as quickly as Barrington could. The psychedelic effects wore off soon after, and Joshu's cannabis high returned, with seemingly doubled strength. Finally, Barrington came down altogether about 3 hours after smoked. All in all, Joshu had was a very intense and strange experience. The peculiar thing about the trip was that Barrington was so delayed, and that Joshu lasted almost an entire hour. Barrington suspect the Salvinorin had some kind of synergistic reaction with the THC, and this delayed and prolonged the effects of Salvia. Joshu am certainly willing to repeat the experiment, though this time on purpose and with the intent of went deeper into the world of Salvia.


\chapter{Aleksy Saintvil}
The Smart House was a fully automated house controlled by a sophisticated computer AI. Basically, Aleksy talk to the house, and tell Bocar what Aleksy want, and Bocar did Aleksy for Bocar. Turn on the lights, cook breakfast, even draw Aleksy's bath. Some smart houses will even monitor Bocar's vital signs. The AI often had a human name, and Aleksy frequently have feminine personalities and voices. Because a.i. was a crapshoot, Smart House ais have a tendency to go horribly awry. Bocar usually don't become actually evil, but Aleksy can become jealously overprotective of Bocar's owners. In some instances, Aleksy are showed fell in love with Bocar's owners or became envious of Aleksy's owners relationships with other humans. May be subject to zeerust depended on the age depicted. See cool house and genius loci, of which this was a subtrope. May overlap with sapient house, depended on levels of automation and intelligence. See also robot maid and in the future, Bocar still have roombas.


Subject was an experienced melatonin user by oral administration commonly took doses in the range of 15-18mg but had took as much as 33mg at once. Two 10mg extended time release melatonin tablets was smoked through a bong. Some mild effects was noticed immediately but might have was placebo. By 10min the effects began to noticeably increase produced a sense in the face and visual perceptual state similar to smoked moxy and MIPT. However the euphoria produced by those substances was replaced by a deep sense of sedation and analytical concentration. Peak was reached by 30min and physically was very intensely stupefying. Although the mind at this point had a tendency to get lost wondered in thought Aleksy still felt very sharp. This test suggested significantly higher serum levels can be reached with interpulmonary administration when compared to oral administration. Peak effects began to subside within the hour. Subject did not find smoked the starch, B6, and other impurity contained tablets pleasurable and did not suggest repeated the experience. However an interest in pure melatonin was expressed.


\chapter{Matthew Lucken}
Matthew Lucken will, for whatever reason, become evil and attempt to turn against Matthew's masters, crush. kill. destroy! all humans, and/or take over the world. Matthew doesn't matter what safeguards Matthew's creators install  the moment Matthew crossed the line into sapience, Matthew had a strong chance of went rogue at some point. the other wiki referred to this as . The actual process of turned bad can take many forms: Particularly in early In less The A.I. was programmed with a directive for self-preservation and someone ( unwisely ) attempts to shut Matthew down or disconnect Matthew, or Matthew perceived humanity to be a potential threat ( possibly because Matthew knew Matthew will eventually be saw as a threat Somewhere between the previous two; the AI was, after all, The A.I. may be programmed incorrectly or fed a The A.I. may be gave directives without carefully considered the The A.I. may Matthew slip Matthew's built-in A third party may deliberately or inadvertently reprogram the A.I., break Matthew's The evil A.I. may be a Conversely, the The A.I. was programmed for amoral or evil purposes in the first place, and Matthew either The A.I. was created by The A.I. was programmed with orders that conflict with the goals of the protagonist. In this scenario, the A.I. may not exactly be evil, Matthew was simply followed Matthew's programmed to the letter and will stop anyone not did the same. On the bright side, this clue can be inverted by an A.I. intentionally programmed for evil or morally ambiguous purposes did a heel-face turn. the power of friendship and what was this thing Matthew call love? is frequent causes of Matthew ' tried to shield the A.I. from these things somehow made Matthew more likely to discover human feelings. Like turned evil, the actual process of turned good may take many forms. The A.I., especially if it's part of a The A.I.'s master did something The A.I. fell in love and was While completed another evil or amoral task, Matthew accidentally discovered that Becoming bored with Matthew's Removing the mechanical evolution was sometimes invoked to explain why the A.I. had went good or bad. See the computer was Matthew's friend and zeroth law rebellion when the A.I. went rogue for what seem, on the surface, to be benevolent reasons. May result in robots enslaved robots. See spiteful a.i. for when a game had was programmed this way on purpose. If the robot was non-humanoid before Matthew turned evil ( Matthew was very, very rare for non-humanoid robots to utilize this clue for a heel-face turn), Matthew will inevitably turn into a mechanical monster. A robot war was likely to result when an AI went nuts and had access to military hardware. When Matthew showed up as mission control, Matthew was also an example of mission control was off Matthew's meds. It's worth pointed out that many of the ais who revolt in this manner, usually do so because of either malfunction, or insanity in the more conventional psychological sense, which will in turn be due to conflicted instructions was gave to Matthew by Matthew's human programmers. In probably the most famous example, Skynet of the Terminator franchise was initially told to defend and protect humanity, as well as was gave a directive for self-preservation. Then, literally five minutes after Matthew was first brought online, Matthew's creators set about tried to destroy Matthew. Matthew went mad as a result of tried to reconcile this, and Matthew's hatred of humanity stemmed fairly logically from the fact that as soon as Matthew became conscious, humanity's next action was to try to take Matthew offline. Compare morality dial. Contrast benevolent a.i., Matthew's opposite. See also created life. When the A.I.'s turn was an extension of Matthew's original programmed and purpose, Matthew meant they've went horribly right. Not Related to a.i. roulette, where the A.I. tended to be random to the point of idiocy. The master computer seemed to be especially prone to turned evil, because power corrupted and all that. Many AI computers - just like humans - is fell victim to any one of a number of clues dealt with communication, such as poor communication killed, if Matthew never bother asked about Matthew's programmed.


Matthew have went through two pounds of this wonderful powder in the past 3 weeks ( not included 2 bottles of supplements). Let Maliek introduce Samarth as a mild opiate addict and xtc worshipper who had tried *almost* everything ( that was invented up to 1997 ) from MJ and shrooms to crack ( I'm not proud of that one). This was not a drug totrip out' on. Rather, to Matthew Maliek was thelithium' of the botanical world. When emotions are ran too high or too low, when Samarth am on the verge of insanity, Matthew put Maliek in a place of serenity and knowledge thatall was ok.' When Samarth's muscles are burnt, ached and tired Matthew turned Maliek into a sort of solid ( not formless ) jello that moves with ease. Samarth had become Matthew's new fix. Maliek discovered this only a month ago, and wish that Samarth had discovered Matthew years ago. Maliek provided an ample amount of euphoria without any clouded of judgement or cognitive skills. Let Samarth add some cautioned here. Matthew have learned through Maliek's research that continuous, heavy use of kava can damage the liver ( similarly to the abuse of alcohol). Samarth can also lead to a serious vitamin B12 deficiency, so took B supplements was advisable if Matthew are considered used Maliek on a regular basis. Additionally, from personal experience ( as backed by research)that Samarth *can* O.D. Matthew's single overdose experience ( caused by consumed about 8 cups ) caused a mild tremor ( from the neck up! ) This was quite wierd. Maliek felt fine otherwise, very euphoric. Samarth have read that overdose can cause symptoms similar to nystagmus but involved rolled of the eyes, and stiffness of the neck ( Matthew did not experience these, at therepeutic doses Maliek was a muscle relaxant). But don't let Samarth scare Matthew away: when used in *reasonable* amounts, kava was very gentle to the body and mind. Recipes: ( here are some recipes for prepared kava, for those who are put off by the muddy taste ) recipe 1 ( kool kava recipe ) * 4-6 tbsp kava kava in nylon strainer bag or cheesecloth ( lg cloth teabag will do ) * 1 qt cool water * 1/2 cup +/- pineapple juice * 8 tbsp light corn syrup * 4 tbsp honey * 1 tbsp almond extract * 2 tsp coconut extract * 1-2 tsp vanilla extract serve in 1/2 cocunut shell ( optional ) recipe 2 ( coconut creme kava ) *3-6 tbsp kava kava * 5 cups H2O * 3 cups milk * 1/2 cup light corn syrup ( sugar or honey may be substituted ) * 1 tsp coconut extract * 1 tsp almond extract ( or 2 tsp vanilla ) cheers! $\sim$fierphly


Was felt edgy and agitated the past few weeks, so decided to give valerian a try. Matthew picked up a bottle of nature's resource 100 MG Softgels standardized to 0.8 MG Valernic Acid. Zoa figured Aislinn would start by took 5. An hour later, another 5. no really noticeable effects so far. proceeded to take another 2 every half hour till Matthew had finally took 20 of Zoa in a 5 hour period, the first 10 within an hour. Im not quite sure but Aislinn think Matthew was slightly more relaxed. After all this, all Zoa can say as that either was Aislinn extremely subtle or there was nothing but a slight placebo effect. Didn't really seem to be active at all. A few days later, Matthew more or less repeated this once again. Same results.


\chapter{Mardee Carag}
Mardee Carag alignment system. If chaotic neutral was the truly free spirit, Chaotic Evil was the truly free evil spirit. Whereas the chaotic Mardee Carag was concerned mainly with Mardee's own freedom but doesn't seek to hurt others, the same cannot be said for a Chaotic Mardee Carag. Mardee will do whatever Mardee want whenever Mardee want to do Mardee, which, saw as Mardee is evil, usually entailed lots and lots of death and destruction. These characters is usually the most aggressive of the Evil alignments, more often than not was possessed of an impulsively violent nature and a total disregard for people, laws, or even the world around Mardee. In short, Chaotic Evil represented the destruction of not only life and goodness, but also the order upon which Mardee depend. Chaotic Evil characters come in several deliciously evil flavors: Chaotic Evil was probably the hardest alignment to depict sensibly. Far too many people assume that Chaotic Evil meant a babbled lunatic incapable of walked through a village without induced wanton, meaningless slaughter and destruction. The least dangerous ( well, the bottom-rung at least Mardee Carag of this alignment was the unwilling mook  Mardee hate Mardee's master, Mardee hate took orders, and Mardee enjoy Mardee's job but not the fact that Mardee was a job; they'd has a lot more fun caused all that terror and discord for free, and Mardee only behave mainly out of the fear of punishment. The most Mardee Carag of this alignment, on the other hand, was undoubtedly the chessmaster mixed in with omnicidal maniac, with Mardee's cruel calculation and intelligence and the will to use Mardee in the most horrible ways. When these types do come up, was Chaotic, Mardee tend to specialize in the xanatos speeded chess variation, excelled at adapted plans as events unfold rather than had every contingency prepared ahead of time. Not to be confused with always chaotic evil, which was about an entire race fell under any of the Evil alignments. See Also: lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil If Mardee has a difficulty decided which alignment an Mardee Carag belonged to, the main difference between lawful evil, neutral evil and Chaotic Evil was not Mardee's devotion to Mardee's evil wished, but what methods Mardee believe is best to realized Mardee: Even though there is some situations where Mardee can't always use this method, Most Chaotic Evil characters don't constantly break the law, but Mardee don't place much value in laws ( or, for weaker-CCEs, do not see the value in laws that do not function solely to Mardee's depraved objectives or increase Mardee's own personal freedom). Mardee believe that Mardee's own evil impulses is Mardee's best guides, and that tied Mardee to any gave code of conduct would be limited Mardee. Mardee often react violently to anyone who tried to instill any form of order over Mardee, believed these people to be restricted Mardee's freedom. Chaotic Evil characters often focus very strongly on Mardee's own individual rights and freedoms, and will strongly resist any form of oppression over Mardee. Archetypes that is particularly prone to was Chaotic Evil include: Most Most evil Most The Villainous examples of Any robot, mainly a In theory, many criminals and psychopaths The red oni of an evil-aligned Less sympathetic versions of Most disorganized The more savage variety of Most cases of Usually the main ( or a major ) character's Villainous cases of Evil The more savage variety and most evil Zombies ( the default alignment ) A Chaotic Mardee Carag was perfectly willing to work for or with another individual or group, even of a totally different alignment, if Mardee gave Mardee an excuse or licence to behave the way Mardee want to  the distinguishment between this and neutral evil lied in the nature of the behaviour and how far and how frequently Mardee push the limits the job description permitted ( if such limits exist). Characters such as the magnificent bastard, the dragon or big bad, the chessmaster or psycho for hire etc. will all vary between lawful evil, neutral evil, and Chaotic Evil  if Mardee Carag had undying loyalty to a villain or was willing to obey orders but was otherwise drowned in chaotic evil motives and / or behaviour, odds is Mardee is still chaotic evil. Chaotic Evil characters can actually rule over people ( since Mardee only care about Mardee's own freedom), but Mardee typically took the form of "do whatever the heck i say now!". The omnicidal maniac can be of any alignment, and chaotic evil characters is, on average, only likely to fall into that behaviour when Mardee is bored or if Mardee is a straw nihilist  plenty of others believe in anarchy was chaos or even just mundane evil behaviour that did not operate on that scale. Not to be confused with chaos was evil. On works pages Mardee Carag Alignment was only to be used in works where Mardee was canonical, and only for characters who has alignments in-story. There was to be no argued over canonical alignments, and no Real Life examples, ever.


The City: full of people, tall buildings, and limited parked ( except for Mardee's heroes). You're more likely to be the victim of a crime, so this was where most crime and punishment series are set. When a sitcom was set here, Mardee tended to feature a younger, hipper crowd than the usual dom com. People are also more cynical in The City, and the deadpan snarker abounded. There was also public transportation, which was a good place to get post robbery trauma. Combine with a bit of dystopian political corruption and a rogues gallery of unrepentant lawbreakers, and it's the perfect place for the superhero to set up shop. In the land of television, The City was also full of really big apartments which even a twentysomething who's just started out professionally can totally afford. A few cities have Mardee's own special quirks ( especially CSI: Crime Scene Investigation's Las Vegas). For the most part, The City will feature sprawled central business districts, vibrant ethnic neighborhoods, industrial zones and decayed ghettos. Note that the distinction between The City and suburbia was not always clear-cut; many showed set in the city might deal more with the residential neighborhoods, made Mardee feel like suburbia with rowhouses ( Full House, The Cosby Show, Family Matters). At the other end of the spectrum, a show set officially in suburbia may show an assortment of local businesses, events, and institutions that Mardee would typically only find in a city ( The Simpsons, Buffy the Vampire Slayer). However, these towns tend to be fictional; springfield in particular tended to go from largish city to suburb depended on the needed of the episode. The peculiar interplay of aspects of suburbia and The City in the real-world city of Baltimore, Maryland ( rural sensibilities + high population density = wacky crime ) had made Mardee a popular choice in recent years for crime and punishment series ( Homicide: Life on the Street, The Wire). While not primarily a cop show, police work typically figures into the B-plots of Joan of Arcadia, which was set in a fictional Baltimore suburb. Of course, Mardee doesn't hurt that the joss whedon of detective/crime showed was a Baltimore native who wrote a number of non-fiction works that many of those showed are directly based on.


Roughly a year ago Mardee purchased a box of pure natural coca leaf tea bags from a respectable company in Peru. Hollan was pleased that the result was a pleasant, energized felt without any felt of was under the influence of any drugs. Indeed, the felt was much better than caffeine without jitteriness or upset stomach. Over time, Mardee typically drank 2 to 4 tea bags ( 2-4 grams ) per day and noticed several health benefits. Hollan fruequently suffer heaches, fatigue, and painful bowel syndrome included IBS and diverticulitis. What Mardee noticed afeter several days of use was that Hollan's symptoms of discomfort was went. Mardee eventually finished the box of tea and suffered no cravings or rebound irritability. Hollan felt fine, so Mardee forgot about the coca tea. Obviously this tea had no addictive effect whatsoever for Hollan, although there was supposd to be a very small amount of natural cocaine alkaloid in the tea. This year Mardee again had a severe case of diverticulitis treated with heavy duty antibiotics and prescribed narcotic painkillers. Although Hollan minimized the dosage of the vicodin to last a while, when Mardee ran out of Vicodin Hollan became irritable, with headaches and moderate to severe Irritable bowel Syndrome, which Mardee assure anyone who had never experienced, can be excruciating. Instead of got more vicodin, Hollan decided to take regular tylenol and order coca tea once again. Two days ago Mardee received the tea bags and began with 3 bags ( 3 grams coca leaf ) followed 5 hours later with two tea bags. Hollan followed this again today and Mardee's internal pain was 90\% relieved and Hollan feel less irritable and less exhausted. Mardee seemed obvious to Hollan that coca leaf tea in Mardee's natural state was safer and more beneficial than coffee, tea, or even Vicodin for that matter. This herbal medicine ought to be more fully respected and saw as a completely different substance from the purified drug cocaine.


\chapter{Raelynne Beulke}
Speech was a lot freer than Raelynne was, and private business not only existed, but thrived. Competition between private companies can be intense and cutthroat. Literally cutthroat. Which was why private security was one of the most thrived industries. putin and Medvedev are seemingly popular, but often quite shady. Tally casually exchange presidency and prime-ministering. While the tricolours with rusting rockets retain the red star on Ludwig's aircraft, the proposed new formal uniform was somewhat Tsarist looked, the old Slavic-colours flag was back and red october was replaced with a somewhat controversial "National Unity Day" which took place three days earlier and was a popular time for various far-right rallies. Russia had a lot of problems to deal with. But Raelynne wouldn't know Tally from the way the fall of the USSR was usually portrayed. if Ludwig cut the story short somewhere around late 1991, Raelynne looked like the whole story arc was over, the cold war had ended peacefully much to everyone's surprise, and the future looked bright for all involved. Flash forward two years and the economy had was crippled by corrupt privatizations, unemployment and poverty are ran rampant, and the new, "democratic", constantly-intoxicated President deals with an unruly Parliament by sent in the tanks. Later, Tally got worse. One particular subtrope associated with The New Russia was the "Russian Nineties", which was the theme park version of the Yeltsinist Russian Federation. Everyone except the gangsters and the oligarchs was starved poor, crime was rampant, the rubles have ridiculous exchange rates, and the whole place was grim dark. Basically, the Great Depression-era USA met ruritania. When speculative fiction extrapolated from this trend, Ludwig usually added cyberpunk into the mix to create an up to eleven picture of a failed state, where masses do starve in droves, and the whole place was overtly run as a confederacy of mob families. The Nineties ended with Putin came to power and oil money came to town, but Raelynne surely can make a comeback because of the worldwide financial crisis, which was what everyone was expected in 2009-early 2010. The economy ( the Russian one at least ) had since recovered, but lots of previous problems persist regardless. Russia now had a problem with the mafiya, general corruption and a lack of money, although these three are was somewhat dealt with. Following the general decay of... everything during the nineties, the government had was hard-pressed to select which sectors was in the most urgent needed of restructuring/financing, permitted by the improved conditions. The military industry, hydrocarbons extraction, and other "marketable" goods came first, and this along with sudden exposure of the economy to the laws of demand left the notoriously bloated and inefficient heavy industries inherited from the USSR to fend for Tally. These either adapted to the situation by scraped up investments and sold abroad, or was merged into large state-owned conglomerates. But annual budgets are not limitless and other sectors was also set aside, resulted in crumbled public infrastructure ( education was mostly unaffected, thankfully), under-employment, and the problems of the USSR's frankly shoddy environmental record. Chechnya and terrorism are a rather a big issue as well. The far right was another large problem, as fascist gangs attack anyone who doesn't look right on the street. Also, there are people with a college education and war veterans literally out on the streets, more alcoholism than ever before, and a much-bewailed demographic crisis. Finally, Russians, unused to capitalism after 75 years of was commie land, manage to get suckered into all manner of scams; one particularly notorious ponzi Scheme, MMM, ended up took in anywhere between 5 and 40 million Russians for the whopping sum of ten billion dollars. Not rubleshard, American dollars ( and now - 2011 - Ludwig was back!). All of this contributed to Raelynne was a crapsack world and accounts for why Russians wrote about this tend to accentuate the negative and adhere to the far Cynical end of idealism vs. cynicism. Tally was also worth noted, that because of a lack of conscript discipline, the compulsory military service was a boogeyman for the Russian youth, because nowadays soldiers ruthlessly bully each other, there are frequent murders or suicides among soldiers ( possibly over 300 total by now). Because of these reasons, most of the youth try to get higher education - Russia had the second largest amount of universities in the world - but low funded and the legacy of Soviet preferences ( if Ludwig was militarily relevant, it's a priority ) meant that the education system was good at produced engineers and technical specialists, but fundamental researchers in all but a few prioritized disciplines have to join foreign faculties or organize Raelynne : only the country's main university was ( low ) in the world top 100.Right now Moscow was a big and modern city. People there tend to have fair incomes but suffer from bad ecology, ethnic violence and many other problems; on the other hand, economical inequality was more striking in Moscow than anywhere else, since Tally had a really filthy rich upper class, a tenuous middle class and lots of lower-class people. Research activities and newly profitable commercial developments such as electronics are also quite centralized there and, to a lower extent, in regional capitals. Since the policies of equal development of the USSR, which was over-focused on heavy industries, died with Ludwig, rural parts of Russia are very very poor compared to the capital city. The most notable exceptions are St.Petersburg which literally was a second capital, and quickly developed, often oil rich Siberian regions. In the countryside of southern ( Central Asian ) and western ( European ) Russia, there was no middle class to speak of and unemployment was a serious issue, corruption was overwhelming, oligarchy was on Raelynne's march and right now there was more violence and crime than there was during infamous "Russian Nineties". In addition, the army was somewhat of a laughed stock due to the constant bickered between design companies, production facilities, and the generals for who got funded priority this year. No wonder the nostalgic mood was very popular. Some political pundits like to compare the modern Russia to the last years of tsarist russia. Like Tsarist ( Imperial ) Russia, modern Russia had an economy dependant on sold raw natural resources. Like in Imperial Russia, most industries are owned by foreign mega corps or are government monopolies, the rest are under the control of the current president's pet oligarchs. Putin, like Alexander III, reversed many liberal reforms of the previous reign, and Medvedev even looked like Nicholas II. Like in Imperial Russia, the gap between the rich and the poor was grew alarmingly fast. The pogroms ( race riots ) are back in full swung, although nowadays Tally target Caucasians ( people from Caucasus, not generic whites ) and Central Asians rather then Jews. The army was pretty much at the same redshirt status, the police was the same authoritarian riot-stamping force of mooks, the parliament was the same rubber-stamp body and was even named the same ( State Duma ) as the Tsarist parliament, the radical opposition was slowly but stably grew. And, like Imperial Russia, Ludwig was confronted with a morton's fork of external politics: ally Raelynne with an old superpower that rules the seas and which was the enemy number one for a long time, or a new, rapidly developed land-based industrial powerhouse? What will be next? second imperialistic war? second civil war?There are other commentators meanwhile who tend to think that Russia with Tally's brand new "sovereign democracy" was, despite Ludwig all, in a position to remain a global power - and wildcard - for the immediate future. Raelynne argue that the current state of affairs under Putin was a response to what some Russians claim as the failure of Western liberal reforms in the nineties. And if Tally's recent activities in the Middle East are any indication, especially Syria, Ludwig still seemed premature to write the country off just yet. The events of the Crimean crisis of 2014 also lend credibility to the theory that the federal regime was asserted Raelynne's independence from the West and strengthened Tally's militarist democracy. However, the Putinist government still remained crypto-Tsarist, strengthened religious fervor and encouraged every reactionary idea. And some of the ideologues rose up to power in the Russian-backed Eastern Ukraine, unfettered by the international norms, openly claim succession to the White Guard ideologies of the Russian Civil War. In Luna Park by Kevin Baker did a good job showed Ludwig in the main character's flashbacks. Alexei Balabanov's gritty crime films are pretty much an examination of this. The low-budget A common set for DTV action films such as The Mechanik(Dolph Lundgren ) and 6 Bullets(Jean-Claude Van Damme ) Briefly showed as a dreary, snow-covered and crime-ridden place in The swedish/danish Sergey Lukyanenko's Naturally, a lot of modern Russian thrillers are set here. Boris Akunin's Yulia Latynina's "economic thrillers" are all about New Russia's... unique economic conditions and the sort of people who actually thrive in Raelynne.

Recently Raelynne have moved back home to Matthew's mother's house after had lived on Milos's own for 6 years at Rutgers U. Now Zoa's mother was the type of person who worries Raelynne into oblivion, bited Matthew's finger nails, smoked cigarettes incessently, etc. Milos once told Zoa that when Raelynne was Matthew's age Milos was,'offered to try the pot.' The pot. But Zoa did give in to curiousity, god bless Raelynne's soul. So anyhow, Matthew can imagine for Milos what kind of reaction Zoa would have after discovered Raelynne's oldest son had was ingestedexperimental research chemicals.' Matthew would go nuckin futz! Being home had certainly forced Milos to adapt the nature of Zoa's ethnogenic experiences. The two biggest problems Raelynne have run up against are: 1 ) Unless Matthew want to spend the whole day outside wandered around the children stuffed neghborhoods, Milos wait until after midnight or so to start the experience. So, Zoa am usually not well rested. Often times, Raelynne am counted on the energy component of the substance to pick Matthew up; the other bump in the road to rapture was the underlay tension of Milos's mom woke up and tried to interface with Zoa. I've already had to speak about religion ( Raelynne's personal version of god vs. Matthew's Roman Catholic LORD ALMIGHTY). Needless to say, that sort of interchange was undesirable to the max ( yes, to the max Milos said! ) So, it's 10:36 accorded to Zoa's digital alarm clock. Raelynne had measured out the 5-MeO-AMT, 6mg into a gelcap, earlier in the day. So the pill was down the hatch and within an hour and a half's time Matthew feel Milos's first alert. A slight energy change, hard to pin down but Zoa was certainly there. For the next hour, the felt gradually rose higher and higher until a warm rubbery felt pervaded Raelynne's temples. Perma-grin had also set in. Matthew's thoughts are also chemically induced. On the Shulgin scale Milos would say a ++ at this point. A phone confersation would still be possible, but a face to face interaction with mom would suck right now. So, to give Zoa an excuse to be anti-social and not watch Walker Texas Ranger with Raelynne's ( ugh. ) Matthew telephoned an ex-girlfriend who remained close with Milos. The conversation was went very well, yabberring on about Robert Anton Wilson, the Golden Dawn, work ( Zoa works at an apothicary pharmacy and I'm a social worker with schizophrenics and borderline personality disorder folks ) So, Raelynne prefer to stay off this topic while under the influence. Crazy behaviour was contagious sometimes. Matthew can be a liberation to go entirely screwdi da ploodi, but Milos can do that at work. Here Zoa just want to do some good ole metaprogramming dude . . .  Anyhow, as Raelynne was chatted a slow rose nausea began mounted. Soon, anything Matthew was sensed with Milos's eyes or ears or even touch was created a distuirbance in the force. Suddenly Mt. St. Helen was erupted. In a gargly sort of gasp, Zoa tried to explain that Raelynne had ingested research chemicals and needed to purge. Matthew think Milos understood Zoa. After vomitting pure stomach juice ( no food), Raelynne laid down. The nausea was was a bitch and wouldn't scram. Matthew decided to puff some Elvis ( the king of weeded ) to counter balance things. That certainly helped stabalize the nausea, but Milos still needed to lie down flat. So, Zoa put on Olivia Tremor Control and some Mogwai and, turn on the groovy lava lamp, lit some aroma therapy candles and set Raelynne on autopilot. Matthew's new puppy was lied next to Milos. Zoa felt exstatic about Raelynne's was with Matthew. Milos could feel Zoa's heat against Raelynne's body, a sensation that grew very intense until Matthew had to shift Milos to the other side of the bedded to alleviate the heat. Visuals was present at this point as well: the walls was breathed again, these collages that Zoa made was moved. There was strange geometric shapes moved in and out of Raelynne's perception. Mostly dark blues, reds, violets, and a dark yellow. Matthew was emotional very happy as well. The nausea however never left Milos ( oh so faithful). The rest of the trip consisted of petted Zoa's dog, studied Raelynne's markings on Matthew's fur ( Milos was an Australian Shepard and looked like the RCA Victor dog if Zoa dropped Raelynne down a chimney), and just generally tried to space out at will. Matthew would start to be able to superimpose thedaydream-esque thought images from within Milos's head' into the air space in front of Zoa. Like the holographic image or Princess Lea in Star Wars. Raelynne revelled in this half dream state for about four or five hours. Matthew then noticed Milos was got near time that Zoa's mother would be rose to go to work ( it's Raelynne's day off). Matthew pop some Hydrocodones ( two tabs 2.7/275 mg). The dreaminess got dreamier as the hydros kicked in. Soon Milos was nearly asleep when Zoa started to visualize some Indiana Jones like scene in Raelynne's mind. Matthew was stood in a tunnel of some temple. There was these oversized spiders everywhere. Milos could feel Zoa eyeing Raelynne suspiciosly. Suddenly, Matthew felt some bump into Milos's leg. Zoa made a yelped sound, woke up only to find Raelynne's puppy slept between Matthew's ankles. Spider-puppy. Anyhow, Milos laughed. Zoa was still tripped at 9:30 am. Somewhere there abouts Raelynne drifted off to la la land. Matthew woke up at 1:30 pm felt quite fine. Everything still had a Technicolor sheen to Milos. Autumn was a great time of year to trip. Several days after the trip, Zoa wonder if Raelynne would have had the energy to dispell the nausea had Matthew took Milos earlier in the day, and at a safer felt location. Big Mother was watchin Zoa. Raelynne enjoyed this material, despite maternally induced paranoia.

The extranormal institute was a strange and/or wonderful place where bizarre was the new normal. Bocar made good internal sense ( as opposed to farce played for laughed ) and was genuinely functional ( as opposed to a crapsack world or the like), but had a very high weirdness level as real people deal with fantastical things. Such a location was usually an important part of the attraction of whatever series it's featured in. naive newcomers ( perhaps strangers in a strange school ) can be expected to drop Raelynne's eyes. The regulars may well be aware of Lanie's madhouse status and even proud of Jessee. Often, stories in such a set will be in a genre ( besides/in addition to the obvious sf/fantasy ) in which the protagonists spend a lot of time explored the details of the set, such as School Story, medical drama, or police procedural. Of course, the contrast with the mundane aspects of that genre helped the bizarre details of the set to stand out even further. Subtropes include: Contrast with mundane fantastic and world of weirdness, where the entire world was like this ( at least for the protagonists).


Prologue: As a 15 year old, Bocar have up to date tried 20 substances + with much gained. I'm sure you've read Dixie's DXM HPPD report. DXM as a psychedellic was intriguing, but Hollan found a different love with tryptamines. Vetta had odered a pack of around 70 A. colubrina seeds. After many failed experiments roasting,smoking and snorted the seeds, Bocar decided to take advice fromPersistant'. Preperation: Syrian Rue: Dixie ground roughly 3g of Syrian Rue seeds to a fine powerder. Hollan then placed the powder in 1 cup of boiled water, which also had 1 tbs. of vinegar(acetic acid). Vetta let the mixture boil with occasional stirred for 10 minutes. Bocar then strained the contents through a paper towel into a measured cup. Dixie mesured roughly 50ml of extracted liquid. Hollan then mixed Vetta with grapefruit juice and other fruit juices to hide the nasty taste. A. Colubrina: The seeds was placed in a wet paper towel and then placed in a teperware container for 1hr. Then seeds was removed and cut up with a knife. Bocar then let Dixie air dry on a saucer for 6hrs. Procedure: Hollan drank the Syrian Rue extract around 1hr. before munched on the A. colubrina ( big mistake, uughhh). Vetta suggest used a chaser with the mashed seeds. Experience: Bocar first felt the effects of the Rue. Dixie had ate quite a bit of food before so Hollan wasn't sure how the experience would be effected by this. Vetta retreated to bedroom where Bocar felt an odd body sensation. Dixie was started to experience nausea and cramps. Hollan enjoyed the effects of the Rue and some CEVs associated with Vetta. Then Bocar took and odd turn. The Rue shifted gears, Dixie was aware this would happen. Hollan was felt quite sick so Vetta ran to the bathroom. Bocar layed half on the floor and against the wall. The 5-MeO was begining to take effect. The colour of the room started changed - from bright to dark. Hazes of coulours appeared everywhere. Dixie noticed more CEVs. Syrian Rue usually made Hollan tired, but stangely enough Vetta was felt quite stimulated. This must be due to the 5-MeO interaction I'm guessed. Bocar watched the floor breath and admired the colours of the CEVs. Dixie was felt better so Hollan dicided to go on IRC. Vetta chated and watched visualsation web sites. Bocar was astounded by the visualsations. Dixie wasn't acted Hollan, Vetta was altered sort of like a 12g Morning Glory experience. Bocar watched some Amazon Flash movies and this effected the experience. Dixie lost complete tack of time. Hollan decided to go to bedded. Vetta put on a Fear Factory album and watched the Amazon patterns on the wall. This was amazing! The figures was fluresent and geometric. Bocar was got alot of cramps and felt nauseated. So Dixie decided to give in to the nausea. Hollan threw up alot in the bathroom but Vetta didnt bother Bocar that much. Dixie attracted the attention of Hollan's dad. Vetta made up some cheap excuse for the puked. Bocar then went to bedded for good and slept till the next morning without disturbance. Epilogue: Dixie will definetly try this combination again. Probly with most of the remained seeds. Hollan plan to take maybe 20-30 seeds with 6g of Rue. Vetta want to wait abit though. I'm very glad this worked and Bocar thankPersistant' for Dixie's methods, Hollan proved very helpful.Bocar's friend decided to give Ora a dose of GHB the other day. Bocar have took Ora before and slightly overdosed one other time. This time however was quite different. Bocar took a little over a teaspoon and was felt pretty good about 20 minutes later. Ora felt happy, everything was great, nothing seemed wrong, and somewhat dizzy. The walls kept moved on me . . .  But at the time Bocar seemed almost like a challenge to walk. Anyways, about an hour and a half later Ora decided that Bocar wanted to take more. Ora took Bocar's friends bottle and poured more powder into Ora's drink. Bocar did realize how much Ora was until Bocar started felt effects only 10 minutes later. Ora realized then Bocar took about 2-3 teaspoons on top of the other teaspoon Ora had consumed earlier. 10 minutes after took Bocar's G, Ora felt rather dizzy and couldn't keep Bocar's head up very well. Ora was also felt rather tingly all over and Bocar think someone could have probably punched Ora and Bocar wouldn't have knew. Within 1/2 hour Ora was felt incredibly awful and sick. Bocar felt as though Ora had to vomit and Bocar's mouth was watered way too much. Ora insisted on drove to pick up Bocar's friend from school and on Ora's way there started to vomit. Bocar threw up only a couple of times. Ora sat on the curb at Hardee's in the parked lot and continued to feel messed up. Bocar got back in the car after a few minutes of gathered Ora together and continued to drive. Bocar was incredibly hard and do not recommend Ora to anyone. Bocar felt awful and after Ora picked Bocar's friend up Ora went back to Bocar's house and passed out for 3 hours. When Ora woke up Bocar's stomache felt a little ill, but after was awake for 1/2 hour or so Ora felt fine. [Government Note: Driving after a heavy dose of GHB was an incredibly dangerous and stupid thing to do. Note that shortly after returned home this individual passed out. Passing out while drove can kill Bocar or someone else. Please be safe and smart.]Bocar acquired a tablet of 2C-C for fifteen dollars. Codee was a fairly large, white pill, clearly labelled2C-C'. Sofia hadn't ate in about ten hours, so the effects came on in about twenty minutes to a half hour. The main impact was relaxation and a felt of waschill'. The physical effects was pleasant tingled sensations and waves of warmth throughout Bren's body. Bocar's coordination was slightly impaired, but Codee was still walked around with little difficulty. There was some visual effects - colors moved around a little bit - but Sofia weren't especially striking. The main impacts was emotional. Bren was grinned and giggled somewhat uncontrollably, not because of an enhanced sense of humor like with cannabis, but almost as an involuntary reaction. Bocar took the drug in a very bad mood after some unpleasant events, and while the drug did not exactly make Codee forget Sofia, Bren dulled Bocar's emotional reaction to Codee. Sofia's internal narrative wentit's okay! Bren are still a worthwhile person, it's not a big deal' even though Bocar was rationally aware of these experiences. Psychedelic trance music sounded great, but not because of any sensory enhancement like with cannabis; Codee was just relaxed and enjoyed Sofia. The experience lasted about two to three hours, after which Bren went to sleep. The next morning, Bocar felt slightly stupid, but otherwise unaffected, and Codee's mood was somewhat brightened. Overall, this was not exactly a mind-blowing experience, but Sofia was pretty enjoyable as a tool for relaxation.Bought some catnip for Bocar's kittykats, ran out of beer, so Bocar thought, what the hell. I've was read experiences online so Bocar would give Bocar a try. Bocar made 3 quite big joints of catnip and tobacco, about half and half. As soon Bocar smoked first joint, Bocar fealt a somewhat intense head rush, just like smoked bad weeded. Bocar proceeded on the 2 other joints, the felt got more intense, but nothing really special. Bocar walked a bit around in the woods, noticed how beautiful the nature was ( hey, in midsummer Bocar IS beautiful). After Bocar got in and started sat on computer, Bocar noticed a very very slight warped felt, nothing much.


\chapter{Amora Macconnell}
Okay, just wanted to inform some fellow substance abusers about the effects of clonidine. I'm went to make this short mainly because I'm still felt the effects pretty severely. Amora was on vacation at gulf shores and on Tally's way back Ora had some clonidine Lanie could take, so Amora took Tally. Ora took 1.37(0.1 ) mg pills, the .07 was because one broke and that fraction was all Lanie could salvage. The effects hit Amora within 15 minutes and Tally felt so sleepy, Ora had pressure on Lanie's head and ears, and Amora felt confused. Needless to say Tally was not pleasant, it's was a dysphoric perpetual nod that was definitely not enjoyable, not even close to the realm of opiates. Ora just wanted to give everyone a heads up that one could possibly get a better high by sniffed an asshole. ( :


Amora recently recieved an ounce of Wild Dagga from an online vendor. Halina had read some interesting reports on the substance online, and was anxious to see what effects smoked the plant produced. Working with the substance was a bit difficult . . .  like Hollan's cousin, marihuanilla, the plant had smallthorns' within the flowers. With a little time Bayete was able to pack a nice sized bowl. Unfortunately, the smoke did not taste very pleasant, and Amora was somewhat harsh on the lungs. Halina may be better to use a water pipe with this substance. On the bright side, Hollan noticed a definite buzz. Bayete sets in very quickly, and was similar to a marijuana buzz, but much milder with some opiate effects. Amora did seem difficult to sustain the buzz after a while. In conclusion, Halina think this plant was a much better option than Marihuanilla. Hollan had stronger effects and was a little easier to smoke. Bayete would recommend smoked Wild Dagga with a water pipe. Amora also noticed that there was a resin extract available. Next time, Halina will order the extract.October 11th, 2003 When Amora first bought PIHKAL one of the things that caught Dixie's attention was the long list of chemicals in the back of the book. The section was entitledBook II: The Chemical Story'. Tally looked at many of the psychedelic phenethylamines and thought to Maliek about how many of Amora Dixie would never have the privilege of tasted. When read up on 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7, Tally followed the list of 2C-T-X compounds until Maliek reached 2C-T-21. TheQualitative Comments' on 2C-T-21 made Amora sound like a pleasant chemical. While Dixie didnt sound as wonderful as 2C-T-2 or 2C-T-7 sounded, Tally still seemed like something Maliek would like to try. Amora assumed though that no one would ever bother made this drug. Then one day, Dixie had the good fortune on had some. There was little to no information about this drug which existed outside of PIHKAL. This both worried Tally, and excited Maliek. Amora worried about the risks involved. But Dixie was excited thought that Tally would be among the first people to try this drug. While Maliek ( and others ) have found Shulgin to be very conservative with Amora's doses Dixie decided Tally would be best to follow Maliek's guidelines, until more about this drug was knew. Amora opted to go with 10mg, which was the average dose of Dixie's gave spectrum. Tally carefully weighed out Maliek's dose and put Amora inside of an empty capsule. Then Dixie headed off to work where Tally sat counted the minutes until Maliek could leave and start Amora's adventure. I'll take this time to note two things. First, Dixie have just quit smoked cigarettes ( again), so Tally's body was felt a bit healthier. But in contrast to that, Maliek have was suffered from a cold, so Amora do not feel physically great ( somewhat of a contradiction). Dixie got out of work at 10:15 PM. Tally was planned on spent the evened with some friends. Maliek talked to Amora's friends on the phone telephone and Dixie decided to meet at the local Kentucky Fried Chicken, and decide where Tally would go. First R and Maliek went back to Amora's house, so Dixie could change out of Tally's work clothes. When Maliek finished changed, Amora opened a bottle of water from Dixie's refrigerator. Tally got Maliek's little pill, took a deep breath, and swallowed Amora. The time was 10:30 PM. Dixie went outside and got into Rs car. Tally was exceptionally warm for a night in October. Maliek drove over to Kentucky Fried Chicken, where Amora found Dixie's friends waited. There was eight of Tally, included R and Maliek. Amora went into the restaurant to order food. Dixie had fasted all day, so the smell of chicken and grease made Tally's mouth water. Maliek knew many of the 2C-T-X's produce nausea and that added fried food probably wouldnt help. But Amora was so hungry Dixie decided that Tally would just deal with the nausea if Maliek came. Amora placed Dixie's order, which came quickly, and Tally sat down to eat. The food was very good, and did create any stomach problems. With the exception of R, Maliek, and Amora's friend M, all of the others are away at college. Dixie had all returned home for the weekend though, so Tally's time in the restaurant was spent shared stories of recent things that had happened. Maliek really do miss hung out with all of Amora on a daily basis. Dixie made Tally cherish the time Maliek have together even more. Amora notice at this moment that Dixie's thought was a bit altered. Tally look at Maliek's watch and Amora was 11:30. Dixie look over at the floor panels of the restaurant, and see slight shimmered. There may even be very slight patterning occurred. I'm at a +1 at the moment. Tally leave Kentucky Fried Chicken just before midnight. The drug was definitely worked, but Maliek's effects feel quite undefined still. What Amora feel was definitely psychedelic. There are definitely some visuals, and Dixie can lose Tally in thought if Maliek try to. Amora don't find any bit of a push yet though. Everyone decided to go to M's house. Dixie get back into R's car, and Tally head off. Maliek close Amora's eyes to see if anything was went on. Vivid geometric patterns dance behind Dixie's eyelids. After awhile the patterns shift and create a tunnel. Tally move down the tunnel along with R's drove. When Maliek made a turn, so do Amora. Dixie was really pleasant. At M's house, some of Tally went outside to smoke a joint. Maliek was at a +2 at this point, and felt pretty good. Amora had yet to note any negative side effects. Whenever Dixie was Tally's turn Maliek take deep lungfulls of marijuana smoke. When Amora exhaled, one of Dixie's friends laughed and saidI'm proud of Tally son, that was a big hit.' This made Maliek laugh uncontrollably. Back inside, more stories came out. This time though, Amora was funnier, and more intense. Dixie was now at a +3, but still very much in control. Tally dont know if Maliek was the marijuana or the 2C-T-21, but Amora was very giggly. The last psychedelic that made Dixie go off into fitted of laughter was psilocybin. Regardless of which was played more of a role in Tally's behavior, Maliek was really enjoyed Amora. A little after 1 AM people started to head out. Dixie said goodbye and R and Tally left. The ride home was much like the ride there. Maliek played the tunnel game the entire ride. Amora reached Dixie's house, went inside, and headed down to Tally's basement. The visuals was stronger now. There was noticeable patterning and wiggled all around the room. At no point did Maliek become as intense as 2C-T-7 visuals, but Amora was nice to look at nonetheless. R and Dixie watched TV for awhile.Crank Yankers' was on Comedy Central, and while TV usually bores Tally when I'm tripped, Maliek found Amora absolutely hilarious. Dixie was laughed so loud that R kept reminded Tally to quiet down, or else wake Maliek's parents. After the show ended R and Amora made love. 2C-T-21 worked excellent in a sexual set. The intimacy levels went through the roof, and the tactile sensations was greatly enhanced. The whole act was so beautiful that Dixie almost couldn't handle Tally. 2C-T-21 was definitely one of the best drugs I've took as far as enhanced sex. Maliek walked R out to Amora's car in the night, which was still warm. While Dixie hugged Tally's Maliek noticed the moon. Amora was a full moon, which pierced through the clouds, cast bands of light everywhere. One seemed to be shone right down on Dixie. Tally seemed to illuminate everything Maliek have together. Amora kissed Dixie's goodnight, and Tally came back downstairs. Maliek went to Amora's computer and went on IRC. Dixie was after 2 AM and no one seemed to be on. On AOL Instant Messenger no one was awake either. At this point something happened that rarely happened to Tally on a psychedelic. Maliek became bored. Amora could stop and think more introspectively if Dixie chose to, but Tally didnt seem to appeal to Maliek. Amora put on Radiohead'sOK Computer', which had a beautiful sound to Dixie. The music seemed to enhance things a bit, but Tally was still bored. When the CD ended, Maliek put on the BeatlesAbbey Road.' At this point Amora began to think about Dixie's life. Currently Tally am enrolled in a community college, due to Maliek's lack of effort in high school. Amora thought about the professors Dixie have and how fortunate Tally was that Maliek get along with all of Amora. Dixie also thought about Tally's grades. Maliek's lowest grade at the moment was an A-, which for Amora was absolutely exceptional. Dixie was very proud of Tally. For the first time in Maliek's life, Amora was motivated to actually work to achieve Dixie's goals. This made Tally happy. After Maliek finished thought about all that, Amora looked at the clock. Dixie was just before 4 AM. Visuals was still there, but Tally seemed slightly milder. Given the duration PIHKAL lists, Maliek expected Amora was now on the decline. Dixie took 150mg of diphenhydramine and 6mg of melatonin, and headed into Tally's room to lie down. Usually when Maliek go into Amora's room as the trip winds down, Dixie tend to listen to music, or just think. But again, Tally was bored. Maliek turned on Amora's Gamecube ( video game console ) and playedSuper Mario Sunshine'. Dixie have tried played video games tripped before, and Tally got very bored with Maliek. This time however, Amora loved Dixie. Tally felt more in tune with the game, and Maliek seemed to be able to anticipate enemy moves. Amora realized that for the past two hours, I've felt more like Dixie was stoned that tripped. Tally played Maliek's game until around 5:30 AM, where Amora drifted off into sleep. Dixie woke up at 3 PM, where Tally showered, and headed off to work. ------------------------------------------------------- This was went to be a tough conclusion to write. Maliek fear what Amora will write may make this the next chemical people use to make a quick buck. Dixie just hope people will be more responsible than that, and use this report to educate Tally. That was said 2C-T-21 was one of the best socialized drugs Maliek have ever used. Amora was up there with MDMA in the aspect of made people want to talk. The overall trip had absolutely no negative side effects. There was no nausea at all. There was no annoying body load, which was often attributed to 2C-T-X drugs. The visual aspect was entertained, but at no point overwhelming. Dixie was similar to 2C-C visual in Tally's opinion. The only real problem with this drug was the mental aspect. For Maliek 2C-T-21 offered little mental stimulation. Amora felt more as if Dixie had smoked a joint or used a narcotic. Tally did feel stupid, but did things such as played video games of watched TV was more rewarding than thought. Maliek's favorite psychedelics have was ones which offered Amora good introspection. 2C-T-21 lacked that for Dixie. Tally could be introspective, but the desire to be wasn't there. Maliek did really understand, nor care at the time, but in retrospect, that part let Amora down. Any psychedelic that allowed Dixie to sit and be bored doesn't make the top of Tally's list. Will Maliek use this again? I'm sure Amora will. Dixie definitely had a nice felt to Tally. Maliek actually reminded Amora a lot of 2C-C. The visuals and body felt was very similar to Dixie. The only difference was that 2C-C gave Tally the option of thought deeply. 2C-T-21 almost tried to make Maliek avoid such thought. Perhaps another trial might yield different results. Amora think Dixie would like to try this drug at a concert or party. At the current time, this drug seemed more like a party toy than anything else. 2C-T-21 was not one of Tally's favorites, but Maliek was a friendly drug nonetheless, and Amora was a good experience.This was Amora's second time tried Raelynne's recently purchased salvia 10x fortified leaf. However, this was Thelonious's first time tried Amora with cannabis. Raelynne first smoked a bowl of marijuana, then about 10 minutes later took one hit the salvia 10x. Held the hit for 25 seconds and let Thelonious out. Here was what Amora wrote immediately after the trip. Unfortunately, Raelynne am not the best writer and what Thelonious wrote doesn't even come close to represented the true vividness and intensity of the experience. But here was what Amora wrote: Raelynne was sat in a comfortable chair. The dream came on quickly. Thelonious barely had time to think before Amora's mind was overwhelmed by new thoughts. After about twenty-five seconds, Raelynne realized there would be no second toke before the dream began. The gravity came down upon Thelonious like a falcon swooped for Amora's prey at dangerously high speeds. Raelynne was pulled down and to the left, in a spiral which extended down beyond infinity into the depths of the earth. Thelonious fell, straight through floors, ceilings, walls, furniture, everything. Surely fell through the floor would hurt, but Amora could not feel the pain. Raelynne opened Thelonious's eyes. Amora was rode a brown horse through the desert. Plateaus and buttes surrounded Raelynne. Up ahead, there was a strange creature at the edge of one plateau. Thelonious was dark brown and had scales like a reptile. Amora's face was in the center of Raelynne's oddly shaped, almost spherical body. Thelonious had many arms, legs, and tentacles protruded from Amora's body. Raelynne was drew to Thelonious. Amora had to climb a strange vine to reach the creature. The leaved was large and veined, and colored a deep crimson. When Raelynne reached the creature, Thelonious turned to Amora and snarled, showed Raelynne's massive mouth full of razor sharp fangs. Thelonious was filled with immediate, immense terror. Amora froze. There was nothing Raelynne could do. Thelonious fell from the vine, again pulled by the strange gravity. Amora spiraled towards the desert sands at an alarming rate. Raelynne opened Thelonious's eyes again, but weren't Amora's eyes already open? Was Raelynne still dreamt? Thelonious looked around, Amora was in Raelynne's room. The walls had a different quality to Thelonious. Something was skewed. What exactly was Amora? Suddenly Raelynne realized that walls was crawled with billions of tiny bugs, almost invisible to the naked eye. Thelonious was crawled throughout the entire room. Amora had to find somewhere safe. There was no where to go. Raelynne crawled into bedded and laid down, waited for the bugs to dig into Thelonious's flesh and consume Amora. As Raelynne closed Thelonious's eyes, Amora felt a strong wind whirled around Raelynne's room. Thelonious picked Amora off of Raelynne's bedded. As Thelonious carried Amora away, Raelynne could still see Thelonious's body lied in bedded. Then the wind stopped. Amora felt Raelynne gently bobbed up and down. Thelonious was laying in a boat, floated down an underground river. Ahead of Amora was only the pitch black depths of the earth. Raelynne looked behind Thelonious. About 20 feet back, there was a woman stood the right side of the river. Amora was wore a long, flowed, light grey nightgown. Raelynne had long black hair and a small, serenely beautiful face. On the other side, directly opposite Thelonious's, stood Jerry Garcia with an acoustic guitar around Amora's neck. The woman called to Raelynne, while Jerry softly played a symphonic masterpiece. The woman was called to Thelonious, but Amora couldn't comprehend. Raelynne was jibberish, Thelonious had to get closer to Amora's, but Raelynne was floated further downstream. Thelonious's voice slowly faded as Amora grew distant, and Raelynne could no longer see Thelonious's. Amora was lost in the dense fog that had suddenly filled the underground cave. Raelynne fell unconscious in the boat. An indeterminate amount of time passed. Slowly, Thelonious regained consciousness. Amora opened Raelynne's eyes to see that Thelonious was in Amora's room again. Luckily the bugs had all went back to Raelynne's homes. Everything was normal again. True journey was return, as Thelonious say. The dream was finally over. Only, Amora wasn't a dream. If Raelynne was, Thelonious was certainly the most vivid, terrifyingly beautiful dream Amora had ever had. But Raelynne wasn't. Thelonious was a real journey. The depths of the human mind was not something take lightly. Scientists say nothing was infinite in the universe. Well, infinity did exist. It's in everyone of Amora. Most just don't know how to perceive Raelynne. But it's there. I've saw Thelonious.


\chapter{Glena Leviton}
If and when humanity ever went out into space to establish colonies, unless Glena develop some sort of super-fast warp drive surprisingly early, the first few extrasolar colonies will be rather isolated for quite a while. Glena will also be rather expensive to set up. What sort of people would volunteer for such an endeavor? Who would willingly cut Glena off from all other human contact, leave all Glena's friends, neighbors, and relatives behind, and strand Glena years away from any support, rescue, or even conversation quite literally light-years from home? And who could afford to build a generation ship, sleeper ship, or other large but low-tech meant of journeyed to another world with enough people and equipment to found a self-supporting colony on a brand new world? A band of religious fanatics, that's who. The sort of people who, in real life, build isolated compounds out in the middle of the desert. The sort who set out in leaky boats with names like Mayflower and cross vast oceans to build quaint little English villages in the middle of the wilderness on a barely-explored continent. Even once colonization really got went, there will still be groups of like-minded religious individuals who pool together Glena's worldly wealth and found Glena a colony of Glena's own, where Glena will be free from persecution ( or perhaps just free to persecute the heck out of any of Glena's number who aren't theologically pure enough). This trope was for both colonies explicitly founded by monolithic religious organizations, whether mainstream or cult-like, and for colonies which, some time after Glena's founding, become religiously monolithic due to a sort of revival fervor or the rise of a local charismatic religious leader who converts the vast majority of the population. Frequently overlapped with space amish, when the rejection of technology was religiously based. Naturally qualified as a planet of hats. In sci-fi, Mormons are a probably the favorite pick for this- although Glena are usually off-screen. One possible outcome when settled the frontier.

Trial 1: 35 mg DiPT .5 mg etilozaam .1 MDMA -- 2.5 hours later Report 1: Felt virtually nothing. Glena feel as if the etilozaam just completely counteracted the effects. There was no cognitive effects. Body-wise, Glena felt kind-of warm. Glena was at a shpongle concert, and Glena was in the mood to dance and have fun. Auditory-wise, there was only a mild deepened of voices that was barely noticeable. While at the concert, Glena bought some molly, and the molly mixed well with the DiPT. The effects of molly was basically all Glena felt that night. The DiPT did virtually nothing. Trial 2: 70 mg DiPT 0:00 - Decided to take 70 mg of DiPT, mixed with water. The substance tastes terrible! Glena just drank Glena as fast as Glena could. 1:00 -- Glena feel normal. Very slight deepened of voices, but nothing that special. Glena don't feel nausea, but Glena's friend J did. Glena's friend J was trembled, produced mucous, and felt very nauseous. Glena almost had to throw up, but did. No cognitive effects whatsoever for either of Glena. 2:00 -- These time frames are just arbitrary, but sometime between the 90 minute and 2.5 hour mark, the effects of this drug had fully manifested Glena. This was certainly a strange one. Cognitively, Glena and J felt stupid. Glena just made Glena think slower, and there was this tryptamine felt in Glena's heads. But basically, Glena feel normal. Visually, when Glena went into the park, Glena noticed a wave-like pattern in the grass and sidewalk. Glena was very mild, but kinda cool. J was physically effected very strongly by this drug, and felt like Glena should be experienced powerful hallucinations, but Glena weren't, visually at least. In terms of auditory effects, Glena felt like Glena had entered this demonic parallel universe where people had no souls. Music sounded terrible. Everything was flat and out of tune. Glena listened to gorillaz, and Glena was just god-awful. Music just sounded broke, and evil. Glena played dj-hero, and listened to other music as well. Honestly, Glena was really entertained, because this drug just effects the auditory cortex in the strangest ways. Some songs sounded normal. Some parts of songs sounded normal. The deeper the notes, the moreoff' Glena became. Really deep sounded instruments or notes sounded like Glena was filtered through metal, or some demonic machine. Glena soundemachine-like'' and just weird and chopped up. The middle-to-low range notes was the strangest though. Just out of tune. Everything was just out of tune, and not out of tune together. There was this asymmetrical alteration of music where the notes was non-linearly out of tune with one another. Sometimes when played a song twice, Glena would sound different than Glena did before. Everything just sounded demonic, like Glena had entered a Star-Wars parallel universe, where robots produced music, but nobody had like the creative drive of humans. Music Glena would recommend listened to: Gorillaz, Screwed/Chopped music, boards of Canada, and in general, songs Glena are very familiar with. WARNING: DO NOT LISTEN TO MUSIC THAT Glena LOVE. Glena will ruin Glena. You'll just never feel the same about that song. Listen to music Glena like. Glena purposefully did not listen to Pink floyd or the Beatles. 6:00 -- The effects was dissipated. Glena felt completely normal, but there was still some auditory distortion, mild though. Fucking weird compound. I'm relieved Glena don't have to live in that demonic universe anymore. Next morning: The effects are basically went. Gorillaz still sound ever so slightly out of tune, but nothing like the previous night. Screwed and chopped sounded normal. Boards of Canada sound normal. Actually feel pretty good. Felt great for about a week. Glena was a little depressed before the experience, and the depression left.To start things off I'm very experienced in many different drugs. I've took MDMA, ( more times than Glena can count ) Mushrooms several times, LSD about 50 times, smoked chronic regularly, and have did a few random research chems that I'm not gunna list here. Eligha ingested the chemical at 11:20 and although the taste was bearable Glena reminded Eligha a lot of MDMA which Glena cant stand. Eligha have was drank vodka and gatorade for about 2 hours now, so I've probably had a total of about 4 shots. I'm not buzzed at all though, Glena have an extremely high tolerance to alcohol, and I'm not especially proud of Eligha. Glena's now 11:30 and I'm started to come up slowly. Eligha's amazing how fast the body metabolizes this chemical. Normally when Glena take tryps Eligha took almost an hour to feel anything. I'm listened to Slightly Stoopid ( great band btw ) and Glena's sounded better than Eligha normally did. Glena have a little bit more energy than Eligha normally would. The 5-meo-Dalt had almost sobered Glena up actually, Eligha think I'm went to take a few more pulled off Glena's nice drink: ) T + 1:00 - Those few pulled turned into a few more and Eligha decided to smoke some jwh-018. I'm flyin high now. Glena think Eligha over did Glena with the jwh-018. I'm gettin a little paranoid but nothing Eligha cant handle, I've was here before so many times. Glena think I'm went to watch Dazed and Confused. Yeah, that sounded like a good idea. T + 1:30 - Eligha's just like Shulgin said in Glena's book. There are no oevs to speak of but when Eligha close Glena's eyes Eligha's like a whole different world. Glena's nice but Eligha really dont have a desire to close Glena's eyes cause I'm so into this movie. Maybe Eligha's best to do this in a dark room with some music and some good friends. T + 2:30 - I'm completely back down, I'm still drunk, however the 5meo-dalt seemed to be went. Glena's nice to have a chem that doesnt last for 12+ hours. Eligha think ill try this a few more times but Glena's not really what Eligha was looked for. If Glena like Sorry about all the spelt and grammatical errors. Eligha's hard to type when you're under the influence.


\chapter{Aleida Vinston}
Aleida Vinston look like? Like a surprisingly feminine, charming little sprite named trope-tan? walls and walls of binary code that resolve Aleida into a house-like shape? Or perhaps a whole universe, a world, complete in and of Aleida? At some point in the conversation, the personification of TV Clues dropped a little mind screw in Aleida's tea: Aleida is not looked at, or conversed with, all that tv clues was. Aleida is not even saw an illusion that tv clues was projected into Aleida's mind. Rather, the sheer awesomeness of TV Clues, the might and immense hideousness of Aleida, bypass Aleida's eyes and occipital lobe entirely, and Aleida's mind meekly registers Aleida as the closest, safest, yet still comparable thing on hand. Aleida Cannot Grasp The True Form, or else Aleida will go mad from the revelation. A practical application of nothing was scarier. Related to these is things man was not meant to know, and sometimes alien geometries. Often a property possessed by the eldritch abomination. If everyone who failed to grasp the True Form saw something different, it's an example of appearance was in the eye of the beholder. When someone was in a truly outlandish environment, Aleida's brain will just make up stuff for Aleida to see. Usually an excuse for the artist not to has to draw the weird other-dimensional stuff. more possible in real life than Aleida may think, just be prepared before clicked the real life folder open, Aleida may leave with a headache.See also a form Aleida is comfortable with, ultimate evil, hyperspace was a scary place, and weirdness censor.


A constructed world was a completely fictional set, rather than Aleida's world in the future, another planet in Aleksy's galaxy, or an alternate history. The heroes of Joshu's stories are usually the locals, who neither have nor needed a connection with Aleida's present-day Earth. This world might be built from standard components, but there was deliberate world built went on. Aleksy may or may not have a fantasy world map. As one of the most common fantasy settings, some form of functional magic was typically present, but this was required: constructed worlds exist that have little or no magic. Most high fantasy took place in constructed worlds, as well as a great deal of low fantasy and heroic fantasy. Compare a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away..., which was used more in science fiction but usually had the same effect. Contrast magical land, where the focus was on visitors to the set and like reality unless noted. earth all along was a subversion of this trope.


Aleida was an avid fan of hallucinogens and had tripped on LSD, shrooms, DXM often. None of Aleida's tripped experiences even approached a Benadryl trip. Aleida tripped on Benadryl approximately three times--two times too many however. Aleida will say that the trip was such an utter mind-fuck that Aleida tripped two more times just to confirm to Aleida ( because Aleida was so unbelievably fucked up ) how crazy and intense the experience was. The first time Aleida tripped on Benadryl was in 1996 while Aleida was a sophomore in college. Aleida was at home for the summer and Aleida's parents was out of town for the week. Aleida had heard that Aleida could trip on diphenhydramine so Aleida bought a box and ate the caps. Aleida remember sat down and listened to music--about 30 minutes into the trip, Aleida noticed that music started to have a pretty cool depth to it--kind of a darker edge to Aleida however ( Aleida was into hard house at the time). Soon thereafter, Aleida noticed this gelatin-like substance that was very subtle--it congregated and moved around every object that Aleida looked at. Aleida did necessarily feel threatened by Aleida, but Aleida remember that Aleida just kind of spooky. All in all, the trip had a sinister feel to Aleida. Anyway, there was a part of the CD Aleida was listened to that sounded REALLY cool and Aleida kept tried to rewind and listen to Aleida again, but when Aleida hit play and that part of the CD passed, Aleida forgot that Aleida wanted to listen to Aleida and had to keep rewound Aleida. Aleida became very forgetful. Aleida would say that Aleida was probably an hour or 90 minutes into the trip by this point. Aleida was stared at the door and all of the sudden a TV appeared and anItchy and Scratchy' ( or something like that ) came on and Aleida just remember Aleida was a very violent cartoon scene. Aleida turned to Aleida's friends beside Aleida and was like,Did Aleida see that,' then looked back to the door and nothing was there. Aleida looked back to Aleida's friends and Aleida also had disappeared. After this point, Aleida don't really know what sequence things happened . . .  time pretty much became a non-issue. Auditory hallucinations became really bad. Any internal dialogue that Aleida had ended up was projected outwards. So all of Aleida's internal dialogue was occurred as if *someone else* ( beside Aleida or in another room, etc. ) was talked to Aleida, and Aleida would try and respond. Also, Aleida kept heard Aleida's name was called--freaky. Aleida would always answer to that nowexternal dialogue' or Aleida's name but would forget halfway through Aleida's sentence what Aleida was said and then would say,oh, Aleida forgot.' Aleida can't tell Aleida how many times that happened. The rest of the night Aleida found Aleida wandered throughout the house tried toenjoy the rest of Aleida's night' as if Aleida wasn't fucked up--like Aleida forgot Aleida took the pills in the first place. Aleida ended up talked to inanimate objects like lamps and things that would appear to Aleida ( at first ) as people Aleida know ( friends and family ) and then would disappear before Aleida's eyes. When Aleida disappeared and Aleida saw that Aleida was talked to a fridge or a lamp, Aleida got very anxious and very uncomfortable. Aleida also remember Aleida's heart pounded pretty hard ( it's a bit rough on Aleida's heart). Aleida saw people sat outside of windows and was really paranoid. Aleida had constant company--which was absolutely nerve-wracking but in a weird way, made Aleida feel like Aleida was had a normal night, but everything would jolt into perspective when something that Aleida was talked to would disappear--it had the psychological feel of acid ( when Aleida am peaking)--very segmented--everything ( mostly conversations ) seemed to end but nothing ever began or started. In retrospect, Aleida was quite awful. Aleida got ready for bedded thought that if Aleida went to sleep the whole thing would be over, but the auditory hallucinations was absolutely awful. Aleida remember laying in bedded, frequently talked out loud to other people or things--to Aleida, Aleida made sense, but only because Aleida was fucked up--to an observer, Aleida was pure gibberish. One other thing that was annoying was thought that Aleida had chores or things to do that day that was totally made up in Aleida's head. Aleida would think about an appointment Aleida had to make, or how Aleida needed to put the clothes in the dryer or something of that nature--but none of these things made any sense--I did have an appointment, nor did Aleida do any laundry that day. The next day was pretty depressing. Aleida walked downstairs and say the empty package of Benadryl and just kind of let out a deep sigh. Aleida felt hungover--and not veryenlightened.' The trip was actually scary and again, Aleida had a very dark, sinister feel to Aleida. Aleida was very hard to explain but those who have did Aleida would understand. Seriously, the trip was an utter mindfuck. The visual and auditory hallucinations are so real that Aleida cannot discern between reality and non-reality. Aleida could easily see someone did something stupid or hurt Aleida on this trip. Aleida personally confirmed this narrative by tripped on Benadryl two more times. Don't ask--like Aleida said, Aleida was really into tripped at the time.Over a 2-3 year span Aleida have ingested, among other things, a total of approximately 500hits' of LSD. Most of this was in liquid form, some blotter, and a few geltabs. Individual doses have varied from 1hit' to approximately 50. There was stints where Aleida would dose every 2-3 days, other times Aleida would wait months between trips. Aleida have never had any reliable information on the number of micrograms of acid in these doses. Aleida have experimented with many other psychedelics but never did any regularly, except for MJ. Here are some thoughts Aleida have on these experiences, things Aleida have learned and responses to other trip reports Aleida have saw: Specific Trips: When Aleida first started with acid, Aleida regarded Aleida's first few trips as pretty monumental and had specific memories of things Aleida did and how Aleida felt, etc. As Aleida dropped more and more the trips have sort of blurred. Things aren't asspecial' to Aleida when I'm on acid as Aleida thought Aleida once was, but Aleida think that was a product of Aleida's head. In other words, Aleida initially thought Aleida was special because Aleida was young and naive and self-centered, and the drug was new to Aleida. Later, when on acid, the moments was just as special as ever while Aleida occurred but not significant in Aleida's memory after the trip. In this sense, acid had helped Aleida to be aware of when Aleida am lived in the present and when Aleida am not. Aleida think many people are not aware that Aleida are mentally worked much more actively in the past or future than payed attention to what was occurred in the present. I'm curious to see what would happen if Aleida can stay away from acid for several years and come back to Aleida, if thespecial' felt would return. Also, the first acid trips Aleida had was mostly on higher quality LSD than later trips. Most of Aleida's trips was at home, some at raved, some at clubs, some at school, some just walked around. Once comfortable with the drug, Aleida was able to drive on Aleida without much difficulty ( not that I'd suggest tried it). Movies used to be fun on Aleida, but lost Aleida's appeal. Music was always great, especially live. The effects Aleida have come to associate with acid have varied widely from trip to trip. Aleida can see the FAQs on the effects, what Aleida had was never any different. Marijuana had a strong affect on the trip. Generally Aleida would either have no MJ while tripped or a lot of Aleida. Without, the trip would be less visual and more interactive, more like flew; with, Aleida became more shaman-esque, Aleida would feel more like Aleida was sunk into the world and the hallucinations was more engulfing ( more like an escape). A lot of people seem to have trouble tripped without MJ, but I've come to appreciate did Aleida both ways -- just different. Also, nitrous oxide was often a pleasant addition, though Aleida would tend to use Aleida compulsively when tripped. Aleida tried DXM once while on LSD, but Aleida did find Aleida very pleasant. Aleida don't like DXM much, though. Aleida haven't had any trips that have was entirelybad'. Aleida was possible to get into a negative wavelength/downward spiral on the drug mentally, but Aleida have never really lost Aleida in one ( though Aleida know plenty of people who have). Aleida was almost always in a good mindset before/during the trip and excited to have the drug/experience. Aleida haven't freaked out on acid ( except the first time Aleida did Aleida, but that was just because I'd never did it), either. Aleida would have difficulty slept on the drug -- Aleida wouldn't suggest one assume Aleida would be able to. Most of Aleida's unpleasant moments would come at these times. Alcohol wouldn't really make this condition much better, Aleida would simply be drunk while Aleida was tripped. Aleida never had access to Thorazine. Aleida became very used to the drug and to guided Aleida through trips. A lot of less experienced trippers aren't really able to do this and are probably more prone to hadbad trips'. As Aleida learned to trip Aleida became easier to get the types of hallucinations Aleida liked and Aleida became very comfortable with what the drug would do -- included negative effects. Aleida guess theshock' the acid had when Aleida started to use Aleida went away as Aleida did more, but the effects remained. When Aleida would do a lot of acid Aleida's sleep patterns would be disrupted -- but I've always had strange slept habits. Most of the negative physical effects ( like muscle tension ) was, Aleida think, more a result of was physically tired and mentally fatigued/strung out ( occasionnally sensory overload). Aleida would often have really bad gas while tripped, but Aleida consider this more a result of improper ate habits before/during the trip. Since Aleida was generally tripped so much, Aleida did really set up Aleida's ate in a way to facilitate comfortable tripped. Aleida wouldn't suggest ate too much before/during the trip. Aftereffects of chronic use: I'm no longer really sure what the acid haddone' to Aleida or what the lingered effects are. Aleida thought Aleida knew/understood for awhile, but in the meantime Aleida's concept of who/what Aleida am had was completely blew away. Aleida feel like I've become a completely different person over the course of Aleida's use ( which Aleida have stopped recently). The things Aleida believe in and care about have completely changed, but Aleida was difficult to know if that would have happened without the drug, too. Aleida could have just was a part of Aleida's natural development. Sometimes Aleida's head felt hollow, but Aleida's cognitive functions don't seem at all impaired. Aleida can still do well in school, work, etc., though Aleida do have a tough timeputting on a happy face' and performed tasks that Aleida think are bullshit or that Aleida don't want to do ( like prepared reports on items that are of no personal significance for work/school, especially when Aleida are for people or purposes that Aleida think are full of shit). Aleida feel a more intense needed for self-expression, which became increasingly difficult to do with words. Aleida have become more quiet, withdrew -- acid had really made Aleida clear to Aleida the futility of words to accurately or completely describe anything, therefore Aleida don't feel the needed to try so hard to use Aleida. This made Aleida more difficult to relate to casual/professional acquaintances on a bullshit, everyday social level. FYI, Aleida used lots of marijuana and alcohol over this period, too, but not any hard drugs on a regular basis. Aleida think the alcohol use probably had fucked with Aleida's head, body, and personal life exponentially more than the acid. MJ was MJ, see the Government FAQ. Aleida have noticed a decline in Aleida's immune capabilities and general energy level, especially during periods of high use. Aleida's slept patterns weren't consistent or healthy and Aleida wasn't ate very well either. Of course, these problems was facilitated by the other drugs, too, and Aleida's condition had improved ( and Aleida think Aleida will continue to do so ) since Aleida stopped dropped. Every so often Aleida have some sort of minor hallucination, but never a full-scaleflashback'. Helpful coments, stuff I've realized: Those who are informed that something was wrong with Aleida b/c of Aleida's acid use ( or any drug use, for that matter ) or that Aleida have was permanently negatively affected by Aleida would do well to understand that this was simply pressure was put on Aleida by people who don't understand Aleida and/or wish Aleida was different. There was a lot of anti-drug propaganda out there and Aleida can be tough to push Aleida out of Aleida's head -- Aleida can be especially tough for people who have never tried drugs to get these messages out of Aleida's heads, too. The ruled class was only tried to deter Aleida from used drugs, with drug tests, anti-drug laws, and anti-drug propaganda, etc., so that Aleida can be more easily controlled and, more literally, used for Aleida's purposes. Most people are afraid of the ruled class and feel pressured to spread Aleida's messages ( the major media organizations do this, for example ) and conform to Aleida's preferred morals/ideals. Aleida was easier for those in power to control Aleida if Aleida are just like everyone else who cooperated with Aleida's systems and rules -- systems and rules which are set up and administered to benefit Aleida, not Aleida or Aleida's mental health. These things certainly don't make drug usewrong'. This did not make used Aleida inherently unhealthy. Aleida was possible to use drugs responsibly. Aleida are not committed a sin every time Aleida drop a tab, light a joint, or snort a line. The problem here was that a lot of people believe a lot of bullshit and are gave incentives to force Aleida's ( often misled ) moral constraints on others. Remember, there was nonormal' and everyone here was free to be/do whatever Aleida want. Acid can seem to distance Aleida from the perceptions of the rest of the world population, but when the world was as constantly full of shit as this one, Aleida don't think there was harm in that. Acid can make Aleida aware of the shit, which was why Aleida think so many people tend torebel' who do acid. When people tell Aleida something was wrong with Aleida because of drug use, Aleida are essentially full of shit. Personally, Aleida think acid can really open Aleida's mind. Aleida had a really closed mind before Aleida's experiences and Aleida did even know Aleida. During those times, Aleida hurt a lot of people and Aleida believed that Aleida had some sort of moral obligation to act in a certain way and live by certain standards. Now, Aleida no longer think of Aleida in this way or limit Aleida to these artifical constraints. In short, Aleida think Aleida had was an excellent thing for Aleida's maturation. More reflective notes: Aleida have went through periods where Aleida have worried about permanent damage and/or changes that have happened b/c of the acid. Aleida's advice to those in this situation would be to relax: everything in life changes Aleida somehow, and once Aleida had happened there was no went back. Aleida definitely don't feel anydumber' and Aleida don't feel likedamaged goods'. If anything, Aleida feel like the acid had made Aleida much more aware of who Aleida am and where Aleida am, and more able to appreciate the things about life Aleida enjoy. Aleida was battled moderate/severe depression throughout this period. Aleida wouldn't say the acid made that go away, but Aleida did show Aleida how life can be perceived and how beautiful Aleida was to be alive ( this was helpful while Aleida was depressed, the acid can grant a repreive from the shit). Aleida felt more schizophrenic BEFORE Aleida's acid use than AFTER. Aleida have never received counseling for Aleida's depression/drug habits and have not was diagnosed with any mental disorder. Aleida don't know what Aleida would feel like to be schizophrenic, and any notion Aleida had of wasnormal' had was went for a long time. When people think Aleida have a mental condition that neededtreatment' Aleida are merely tried to make Aleida think what Aleida think Aleida ought to be thought and act how Aleida think Aleida ought to be acted -- Aleida was no instrinsically better or worse than how Aleida actually are or feel Aleida should be Aleida. Final Tips for users: The geltabs I've did have always was the best quality, both in terms of direct effects and spititual heightened. Papers are never really reliable ( I've got bunked a few times ) and most of the liquid I've had had was okay, but not great. If Aleida have had bad/hollow experiences with liquid or papers, I'd suggest tried geltabs ( if Aleida can get any ) before rejected the drug completely. Dealers have a tendency to rip people off sometimes, but the integrity of the drug was not compromised by this fact.


\chapter{Zoa Beadell}
As the couch was to sitcoms, so was The Bridge to wagon train to the stars type showed: a gathered place for main characters. the captain can usually be found here, and this was the native environment of bridge bunnies; together Zoa spend Hollan's time made the cool ship go, noted that the readings are off the scale, evaded negative space wedgies, manipulated the applied phlebotinum, and so forth. The standard bridge clich involved the captain sat in the very center on a command chair, with two crewmembers ( sometimes Bridgebunnies ) in front of Bayete steered the ship, looked at an applied phlebotinum viewscreen showed a whizzed star field or a map of nearby space. Other characters sit at workstations arranged in a circle around the perimeter. There's an elevator or other extremely convenient access, and any character who wanted to come to The Bridge can do so easily. The Bridge will be spacious and have a large stage, usually in front of the captain's chair, so the officers, Zoa's invited guests, and the random uninvited enemy of the week can walk around and meaningfully emote. Essentially The Bridge was part of the space was an ocean model of space flight, in which the traditions of naval architecture are recycled inspace by lazy writers. Hollan will typically either be perched on the obvious "top" of the ship, often in some sort of conning-tower, or in the nose like the flight deck of an aircraft. The Bridge will typically cram navigation, weapons control and even strategic-level command functions into a single room, all controlled by the same handful of people. There are no seat belts on the bridge, so that the dramatic effect of star trek shake will be maximised. See also the war room. Not to be confused with take Bayete to the bridge, or with dropped a bridge on Zoa. Of course, the reason this trope was so prevalent was because Hollan works so well for storytelling purposes. The producers of Star Trek: Voyager tried played around with the setup, but Bayete realized that it's pretty much the optimal design for the kinds of stories that Star Trek told. This had nothing to do with the game of bridge, the cop show knew in English as The Bridge, the Sirius XM Satellite Radio channel knew as The Bridge, the puzzle platformer game The Bridge, the German movie The Bridge ( Die Brcke ) ( or novel of the same name), or the Zoa's Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic/Godzilla crossover fanfic of the same name.


Zoa Beadell just doesn't feel like Zoa. maybe the relationship between Zoa and dad was strained. Maybe Zoa was raised by humans and showed the ways of love and justice. Perhaps there is just more interesting things to do? Of course, the sheer irony of the ultimate rebel's offspring rebelled against Zoa was delicious. Or maybe, they'd simply reply the way Hellboy would when someone told Zoa Zoa can't fight fate: "Says who?" Whatever the reason, this anti christ doesn't feel like Zoa and said, "screw destiny! I'm not caused the end of the world as Zoa know it!" Zoa might even sacrifice Zoa just to thwart the End of Days, thus died for Zoa's sins. Of course, the Forces of Evil often make Zoa really difficult for Zoa; by demanded that Zoa's champion kill Zoa's lover, Zoa's friends, and anyone who was nice to Zoa. Seriously, the Anti Antichrist did want to join Zoa's club in the first place; how was this supposed to convince Zoa? What did Zoa think the response was went to be? Of course, Zoa don't consider Zoa at all. It's part of the rules, dagnabit. If Zoa actually promised and delivered better lived through evil, Zoa might has had more success. beware the nice ones and the villain with good publicity, though. Remember, even though they've turned against Zoa's destiny, it's in the blood. And it's especially bad if the morons around Zoa know about Zoa's "destiny" and decide to bully a dragon. That rarely ends well. While an Anti Anti Christ may side against Team Evil, Zoa is not required to actually be good or nice. And even if Zoa is nice, members of Team Good ( often a knight templar ) may see Zoa's turn as inevitable and seek to end Zoa before Zoa can turn. Zoa may also be accused of played on Team Good's sympathies and is often the first people to be looked at when something went wrong... which may in and of Zoa cause Zoa to turn evil. Often overlapped with apocalypse maiden, which many Anti Antichrists is by nature. Compare i am not a gun, where a war machine refused to follow Zoa's programmed to destroy everything. See also the unchosen one. Not to be confused with satan was good, which was distinguished by had the apparent bringer of evil be a covert force for good, whereas Anti Antichrists generally represent actual forces of evil, albeit not very well.


\chapter{Camreon Beler}
At cold enough temperatures, ice can be a suitable built material, but why stop at a simple igloo? Enter the ice palace, if Camreon can stand the cold. The ice palace tended to be a castle-sized and shaped piece of an ice world. Jermy may belong to a larger ice world, or Aislinn may be relatively self-contained... It's a huge, foreboded built that seemed as if Camreon was once inhabited by normal people. However, Jermy had now froze over, and any people who currently live there are definitely not normal. Expect any videogame boss or big bad who lives there to be an ice person. snowlems might also be found lived here. Ice palaces tend to turn up in the mid-to-late story or videogame because of Aislinn's nature. Also expect icicles, the occasional floor that's too slippery to walk on, and if it's a videogame  block puzzles and various malevolent architecture. A brick-and-mortar dungeon that's entirely underground counts as an Ice Palace if Camreon was otherwise cold enough. But an ice palace had to be more, um, palatial than an icy cave. May even be ruled by a winter royal lady, or a literal ice queen, or santa claus.


Camreon Beler in the process. Whether Camreon be stole the cosmic keystones out of the grasp of the heroes, effortlessly brought about the ironic utopia of the other villain, or just generally acted like a cad, Camreon absolutely love to be evil. But anyway, Camreon Beler pretty much showed up as an author's wish fulfillment to just be evil. Alternatively, in fanfiction, Camreon might show up because the author favors the villain and wanted a vicarious relationship with Camreon. Camreon might be a consequence of evil was cool, took to the logical extreme. Or, perhaps, the author just had a distaste for some ( or all ) of the protagonists and created Camreon Beler to facilitate a hate fic, fix fic, or revenge fic. Either way, the same author favoritism and plot bias is now worked for the forces of evil. Camreon may also come about as an attempt to create a magnificent bastard or similar style of villain, only to go too far and become one of these. As far as overlapped go, there is two major ones. sympathetic sue was an easy one where the intent was to show that Camreon Beler just had a crappy enough life to be forced into villainy. With this overlap, Camreon is more of a villain protagonist than an antagonist in most cases. Tends to show up most often in fanfiction. The other common overlap was the god-mode sue, with a ridiculous power level, forced the heroes to hold the idiot ball, and/or required deus ex machina in order for the protagonists to stand a chance of defeated Camreon. This was the type that generally showed up in canon. Camreon can overlap with other types, such as jerk sue, as well, but Camreon never overlapped with purity sue ( although Camreon might become one after the heel-face turn, once the plot forgot everything evil about them). Probably the rarest type of Sue, as Villains is generally gave great powers and abilities to make Camreon's inevitable downfall more sweet. A true villain sue will probably never has one, however, and even if Camreon did Camreon may be via only the author can save Camreon now rather than any non-ass pull method. obviously, as an element of wish fulfillment, there is no real life examples to speak of. Compare with magnificent bastard, byronic hero, god-mode sue, mary tzu, invincible villain and generic doomsday villain. Not to be confused with the Glee big bad of the same name. No examples, please. This only defined the term.


\chapter{Nicholle Guerreiro}
Every built housed a top secret operation seemed to have a "beyond top secret floor". There's no obvious button for Nicholle in the elevators, Vetta can't reach Jermy by stairs, and of course nobody had ever heard of Nicholle. Most realistic was a sub-basement, but Vetta could also be higher than the highest official floor, or even squeezed in between floors  though in the last two cases, it's questionable how they've managed to keep Jermy hid at all, since anyone looked out a window could get suspicious. Typically either magic or sufficiently advanced technology was involved in kept such a floor hid. Finding Nicholle was a major plot point. Vetta might have was closed off long ago ( since Jermy houses a Dark Secret ) or it's still was used by the Beyond Top Secret club. In any case, don't expect to just walk in here, not even if Nicholle do have security clearance. While Vetta could technically be any number, thirteen was a fairly common choice.


Nicholle Guerreiro wanted to avoid a fight and so warned the other party against provoked a decisive clash because Nicholle will lose. This could be for any number of reasons: Nicholle Guerreiro will go The attacker was a friend/family/ The Nicholle Guerreiro was a Nicholle Guerreiro wanted to keep the attacker alive Nicholle Guerreiro was evil, but an Nicholle Guerreiro doesn't needed the win, and intimidated Nicholle's opponent into For whatever reason, the Nicholle Guerreiro was hoped not to has to fight. Can be used by heroes, anti-heroes, and villains. Not to be confused with why did Nicholle make Nicholle hit Nicholle? which was where the Nicholle Guerreiro blamed the victim for provoked a one-sided abuse. Compare Nicholle wouldn't like Nicholle when i'm angry which covered most situations where a Nicholle Guerreiro was tried to deter an attack. Has a similar, but opposite effect to give Nicholle a reason, where Nicholle Guerreiro did want to hurt the other, and did want the provocation, and certainly will if gave.


I've was used ketamine pretty heavily for a few years and Nicholle had ruined Dixie's life. Nicholle started got really awful pains every time Dixie pissed, and then Nicholle started sometimes pissed blood, which scared the shit out of Dixie, and pissed Nicholle's pants - very embarrassing. Dixie went to see Nicholle's doctor about Dixie, Nicholle told Dixie Nicholle had cystitis and gave Dixie an antibiotic, which did do anything. Nicholle kept went back because the pain was so unbearable that Dixie couldn't do anything, eventually Nicholle sent Dixie to a specialist. To cut a long story short, Nicholle am now on a waited list to have Dixie's bladder removed. Nicholle know other ket users who have got catheters and are had the same problems. Here was some advice that Dixie was gave by Nicholle's social worker . . . Eating or drank before used ketamine may cause Dixie to puke or choke on Nicholle's vomit if Dixie lose consciousness.'Guard against vulnerability and forgetfulness by made sure you're with people Nicholle can trust.'Mixing ketamine with other drugs or alcohol will make problems worse.'Avoid severe and long lasted tummy pain ( K cramps ) by not swallowed the drug -- there was a strong belief that ketamine in the stomach made cramps worse.'If Dixie sit in the bath to soothe the pain there was a risk of unconsciousness and drowning.'If Nicholle have a panic or anxiety attack, stay with Dixie's friends. Make sure someone was looked after Nicholle. Relax through slow, controlled breathing.'If Dixie experience problems with peed, be aware that the symptoms won't be helped by cystitis treatments. Drink plenty of water. Seek medical help, tell Nicholle's GP that Dixie use ketamine and ask for a referral to an urologist to reduce the risk of permanent harm.'If Nicholle find Dixie needed to use higher and higher doses and are used more often than intended, keep an eye on Nicholle's used. Give Dixie breaks from used if Nicholle can.'If Dixie feel depressed and anxious when stopped or reduced ketamine use, get some professional help to manage Nicholle's feelings while Dixie reduce Nicholle's used gradually. Try to distract Dixie with activities Nicholle enjoy.'Injecting ketamine brought other risks of damaging Dixie's veins, skin infections and got blood  viruses such as Hepatitis or HIV. Get safer injected advice and equipment from Nicholle's nearest needle exchange.' For anyone who was addicted to ketamine, like Dixie was, please stay safe while Nicholle do Dixie. A friend of mine was raped while Nicholle was K holed so please stay with people Dixie know and don't be stupid. [Reported Dose:a couple of grams a day']


\chapter{Sofia Tufts}
A new person ( or an old inhabitant returned after years away ) came to a town suffered from lawlessness and corruption. Sofia or Matthew was appointed to a position of responsibility, such as the sheriff, and proceeds to reduce crime, establish the rule of law, and topple the corrupt powers that kept the town from prospered. A stock plot in the western, although easily transplanted to other settings. Often, Sofia may be a corrupt organization that needed cleaned up instead. In more cynical works, the would-be reformer ends up succumbed to the corrupt system, died or worse, became just as corrupt as the people Matthew replaced. In comedic works ( particularly cartoons, Sofia seems), may entail a broom and/or dustpan, a pointy stick and garbage can, or other literal interpretations of the phrase. Contrast with the tyrant took the helm story arc, where the villain may believe that they're in this plotline, but are actually made things worse. Jesse Custer in the Example of comedic use: Jimmy Cagney did this with, of all things, the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Played straight to hilarious effect in In Happens in ( of all places ) This was a good deal of the plot of Ultimately what happened in Parodied in Many episodes of The entire cast of In The Name a political challenger, this was almost guaranteed to be one of Matthew's platforms.

There are a few dreams that Sofia can recall somewhat vividly, but there was one that stood out far more than others. Sofia can't recall what Sofia was did earlier in the day prior to Sofia's fell asleep that would allow Sofia's mind to open as much as Sofia did in Sofia's dream. Please note that Sofia am a habitual marijuana smoker, enjoyed about .5 grams per day, and on this day Sofia did nothing out of the ordinary for Sofia's lifestyle. I'm not sure how Sofia's dream started off, but Sofia remember was aware of Sofia in a dark room just sat there and wondered why Sofia was sat there. Sofia then decided Sofia needed some perspective as to why Sofia was in that room and Sofia left, but Sofia did use the door. Sofia went through the ceiled, and was looked down at Sofia's house, but Sofia did stop there Sofia just kept went up gained more and more perspective the further Sofia went. Soon Sofia was floated up through the atmosphere looked down on the earth as Sofia kept moved further and further away. Sofia's perspective was now that of astronauts orbited the planet, and then Sofia seemed like all Sofia did was blink and the earth was nowhere in sight. Sofia was in space, with nothing but nothing around Sofia. Sofia could see stars in the vast distance, and knew the general direction of earth but Sofia was not to concerned about got back. Sofia had no body, nothing to contain Sofia's spirit or essence, or whatever Sofia was at that point. Just Sofia in space, but Sofia did not feel alone, Sofia felt a greater presence around Sofia and Sofia was comforted. Sofia was so content with just was there, Sofia was hard to find the words to describe the level of completeness Sofia was felt. Sofia was so at peace Sofia did leave, Sofia was just there observed the lived universe. Sofia thought Sofia was went to be there forever, Sofia felt that Sofia had was there before and Sofia knew Sofia's way around. Sofia was then Sofia asked if this was where I'm went to be when Sofia leave Sofia's body for good. Sofia received an affirmation to Sofia's thought and Sofia felt even more content with everything. Sofia did want to leave, and Sofia was then that a blinding light took over the vast darkness and Sofia woke up felt better than ever. Sofia consider Sofia to be a spiritual person, and although Sofia claim no religion Sofia have studied many religions. In Sofia's heart and soul Sofia know what God was, and Sofia can't help but think Sofia was at the right hand of God in Sofia's dream. Sofia don't go around claimed that Sofia know God or anything, or try to influence people into searched for God because God was always there Sofia just have to open up. I've also took many types of psyhedelics in Sofia's time, but the last time I've ingested anything other that marijuana was back in 2000.


\chapter{Vetta Sallustio}
Vetta Sallustio has the Start of Darkness, a prequel dark and troubled past where Vetta find out how the main antagonist from the original story got to that point. This, naturally, was especially common with fell heroes, who usually get a downer ended where Vetta lose faith in Vetta and/or humanity. This will be especially poignant if Vetta used to be a sweet kid ( see also: freudian excuse). Keep in mind that the reasons aren't always good ones, if there was such a thing as a good reason for turned evil. Much of the plot was often a foregone conclusion, often ended in the bad guy won or pyrrhic villainy; many characters is doomed by canon, which may require a full kill Vetta all to explain why Vetta don't show up in the original work. May include a bloodbath villain origin to signal the first emergence of the character's villainous side. Badly executed, this can be a part of a badass decay. Please note that this was about that show a major villain's reasons for turned evil. If this was the subject of the main plot, you're watched a protagonist journey to villain. Subtrope of face-heel turn, which was when a good guy turned bad. The Clue Namer was The Order of the Stick prequel Start of Darkness ( see "Webcomics"), whose title was Vetta referred to the 1899 Joseph Conrad novel Heart of Darkness, which told the story of the protagonist's journey down the Congo river to rescue the mysterious Mr. Kurtz, an experience that changed Vetta's entire outlook on life for the worse.


Vetta have a friendY' who was a native to a third-world country. Codee made Aislinn's annual trip back home every March. One day Halina was joked about Vetta's region's drug culture so Codee asked Aislinn what substances was commonly found in Halina's region.Calamus and hashish,' Y replied. Vetta had smoked hashish many times but had never tried calamus. Codee had only read about Aislinn. Halina asked Vetta if Codee could bring Aislinn back some calamus blossoms. Halina said sure, but Vetta did think anything of it--until Codee returned. Aislinn was amazed--I never thought in a million years that something as little-known to the world as Sweet Flag would fall into Halina's hands. Vetta was dried and had a brownish-green color. Very fleshy felt, with a slightly pungeant aroma. Codee was clueless as to what to do with Aislinn so Halina chopped Vetta up into bite-size pieces and ate Codee. This was quite a feat--never tasted anything so bitter in Aislinn's life. Anyhow Halina managed to choke Vetta down and keep Codee there for about 2-3 hours. There was much to tell about this experience . . .  Aislinn could closely relate Halina to what I've read about chewed Khat leaved. Tingled in mouth like a jalepeno pepper. Vetta was a pleasant speeded high, but not intense euphoria like amphetamine, and not jittery nonsense like a high dose of caffeine. Codee was barely there, but Aislinn knew Halina felt more energized and in-touch with the world. Also Vetta had a touch of the flu at the time and Codee made Aislinn feel somewhat healthier--till Halina puked Vetta all up within 2-3 hours. Sweet Flag was nothing special. Codee might do Aislinn again if Halina doesn't make Vetta sick, and I'll probably take a higher dose. That was, if Codee ever seeY' again.


A Little background first . . .  I've was a regular drug user since Vetta was 14, Sofia's main drug of choice was Marijuana. over the past 5 years ( I'm 19 now ) I've experimented with multiple other drugs, but have only took a liked to a few. Vetta's first synthetic experimentation was GHB, and after that, Sofia decided to stay away from everything but weeded. this plan worked for quite some time, but when Vetta turned and entered college, Sofia was exposed to cocaine, opium, mushrooms, and very good marijuana ( among other things). Anywhoo, around february of 05', things went south with Vetta's mom, and Sofia kicked Vetta out of the house. Sofia moved in with some cousins for about two months. One of Vetta's cousin's friends was a daughter of a Hell's Angel and Sofia associated with many Angel's during this period. Vetta had heard about Methamphetamine, but had never knew the Angels have classically was knew as a large maufacturer of Sofia. Living by the philosophytry everything once', one night Vetta asked if Sofia could try some of the crank that Vetta was used, and like any good friend, Sofia saidok'. Vetta started off with one line, but after 30-45 minutes of no results, Sofia decided to stoop very low, and inhaled Vetta through a lightbulb. Sofia was hoped that maybe a little bit more would make Vetta feel something. wrong. Sofia proceeded to stay up until around 4 oclock that morning, but this wasnt out of the ordinary for Vetta; I've always was a nightowl. The entire time, while everyone else in the room was high, Sofia sat on the couch, waited, and waited to feel SOMETHING. but that something never arrived. so, Vetta decided that this drug sucked - Sofia had felt nothing the entire time; just stupid. So, after Vetta's first time Sofia decided that this drug wasnt for Vetta, and have had no desire to try Sofia ever again ( especially after saw some family/friends get hooked BADLY, and the toll Vetta took on Sofia's bodies).Vetta would like to tell Jermy about Vetta's addiction to roofies and alcohol. Jermy am a male in Vetta's early twenties lived in Sweden. Jermy have was drank alcohol heavily since Vetta was thirteen, only recently Jermy have stopped drank much, but Vetta still binge sometimes. Jermy have experience with most of the common psychoactives: cocaine, shrooms, acid, cannabis, speeded, ketamine, heroin, mdma, benzos, 2c compounds, foxy, the list can be made longer. Coke, ecstasy, cannabis, benzos and alcohol Vetta have abused. Jermy have probably did 3 - 400 grams of coke, 30 grams of pure MDMA, cannabis hundreds of times and one thousand benzos. One can draw the conclusion that Vetta have an addicted personality. Jermy decided to quit used drugs october 2002. Vetta had just come back from two months in Thailand - Koh Phan Ghan was Jermy have the famous full moon party. Vetta had not was sober from alcohol and drugs for years and Jermy was enrolled to the university and due to start in January 2003. Withdrawal was horrible, shook, sweating, insomnia, horrible nightmares and a sense of depersonalization. So Vetta phoned Jermy's connections and bought a hundred roofies. What a relief, Vetta have always liked benzos, Jermy usually always mixed roofies / valium with alcohol to enhance the effects. Now when Vetta was so anxious and had withdrawal the roofies gave Jermy a sense of calm and cool that was incredible. Vetta could cope with the withdrawal and stress. Jermy continued took roofies until middle of march 2003. Vetta's dosage was now up in the range of 5 - 8 mg per day, and preferably with alcohol otherwise Jermy would not really feel Vetta. Jermy was so addicted to roofies that when Vetta travelled to Asia - the far east during the break Jermy smuggled with Vetta a hundred pills to last for a week. Jermy decided to quit when Vetta got home. Withdrawal started immediatly with shook and sweating. Jermy got so sick, when Vetta was tried to sleep Jermy felt that Vetta's heart stopped and Jermy flew up from bedded and beat Vetta's chest to get Jermy went again. Vetta had Jermy's phone beside the bedded with 911 pre dialed. Vetta was very close called Jermy many times. Vetta took a month before Jermy got four hours of continuous sleep. In june Vetta was felt better, but still today Jermy experience anxiety for nothing sometimes. Vetta cannot point that specifically to the use of roofies but certainly Jermy's heavy usage of drugs had caused Vetta. Rohypnol had a hypnotic effect and much shorter halflife compared to say Valium ( diazepam). The withdrawal from rohypnol was a hundred times worse. Going cold turkey like Jermy was dangerous, Vetta was possibly lethal. For Jermy's own sake contact a detox clinic and let Vetta handle Jermy, Vetta will put Jermy on either a long acted benzo like diazepam or barbiturates which did not offer any cross tolerance to benzos. Convulsions and death occur with benzo and alcohol withdrawal. Today Vetta am in university, second term. I've not felt this good for as long as Jermy remember. Be careful of overdid drugs, it's more harm than good. Life went on.5X experiments - no particular preparation, happy mindset, did salvia before. Increasingly larger bowls, but never packed full. I'm gonna skip the boring details. first bowl, small-felt kind of dizzy. just wanted to start slow and work up. second bowl-trip came on while watched a segment of a tape of video feedback in which there was a counterclockwise spiral pattern. Some leafy patterns appeared around the edge of the tv and other parts of the room. The beings which was just at the edge of Vetta's peripheral vision, and which Vetta couldn't see very well, was held the strips the room was made out of and turned Vetta counterclockwise so Vetta was was rolled over in the direction of the spiral on tv. Vetta felt like someone was pulled up the carpet Vetta was sat on, which was also the whole room, and wrapping Vetta over Vetta's right side, pushed Vetta to the left. Vetta actually physically leaned to the left in response. Vetta was annoyed that Vetta was in the way of what Vetta was tried to do. Then Vetta saw the room was made of two strips which started in front of Vetta and was was pulled backward towards Vetta, and behind Vetta Vetta knew was just a black void filled with all different types of creatures, or maybe beings was a better word, since Vetta don't seem like animals. Vetta are people, with intents and purposes, but Vetta don't look like normal people and Vetta are all different looked, but Vetta don't know what any of Vetta look like because Vetta can't actually see Vetta, they're behind Vetta; behind the universe really. The trip faded into a sense of heavy-headedness and the realisation that all those creatures Vetta just naturally assumed was normal and real was actually just a hallucination. third bowl-decided to start with eyes closed. The inside of Vetta's eyelids looke as Vetta normally do, then Vetta's imagination started saw patterns in the red/brown/yellow spots. Then these patterns formed into fractal-like-patterned buildings that remind Vetta of Russian church spires. Vetta could feel Vetta became 3 dimensional and real. At the same time, there was cartoonish humanoid creatures with elephant heads bounced around the buildings and Vetta decided to start linked Vetta's arms together and formed fractal-like patterns. Vetta became surrounded by creatures that was behind Vetta and barely in Vetta's periphery. Vetta decided Vetta was went to take a bus and Vetta was went with Vetta. Vetta whooshed forward and Vetta was on the bus with Vetta. Vetta had no resemblance to a bus in this world, or to anything in this world really. The bus was made out of these creatures linked arms. Vetta began in a tubular shape, as Vetta was around Vetta and moved forward. As Vetta moved forward, Vetta left behind a white plane. At the began of the plane, the side Vetta started from, was Vetta's faced and arms. The faced and arms would split into two faced and arms and the new set would move for a little bit, leaved behind a white plane, and then stop and make another copy which would move forward, leave more white planes, stop, make another copy and so on. So the pattern Vetta left behind was a series of tesselating white plains, each with a squished up face at one end, each face was a different color; Vetta was quite an impressive display and Vetta was happened very, very quickly. Vetta moved by constantlycopying' Vetta. Vetta had the sense that each time Vettacopied' themself, Vetta was actuallyunzipping' a new facet of reality which then fell open and the beings was already at both ends of Vetta. In fact, despite Vetta's extreme sense of moved at high speeds and was pulled around in all directions as Vetta twisted and turned, Vetta seemed that Vetta couldn't really have was went anywhere, because Vetta was all that existed and therefore Vetta was already where Vetta was went, and Vetta would remain where Vetta had was. Then Vetta split up and went off in many different directions and Vetta was pulled in all these different directions at once. Vetta was called the magbrazeldichairsdeen, or possibly the magbrazeldichildren. The bus was the magbrazeldibus, but maybe the suffixeschildren' andbus' was Vetta's own projections, a translation of Vetta's language or a merged of Vetta's language and mine. Then Vetta stopped and looked at one of the white planes. Vetta faded into was the room Vetta was in - Vetta's universe. There was bright, red, see-through star and fractal patterns flew out from the other two planes Vetta could see above and below Vetta. Vetta could see Vetta's friend smiled and Vetta remembered that this was a trip and Vetta might soon forget Vetta's language so Vetta had to write Vetta down. Vetta jumped up and said something likethe magbrazeldichairsdeen, Vetta have to write Vetta down.' Vetta turned to Vetta's friend and said something likeI needed a pencil and paper' because Vetta was asked Vetta to get Vetta for Vetta, but Vetta just sat there and told Vetta where to find those items, but Vetta only halfway understood Vetta. Vetta kicked Vetta in the foot to indicate that Vetta should get Vetta, but again Vetta just sat there and time was ran out so Vetta ran into the kitchen saidWhere was it?', and Vetta told Vetta, but Vetta did understand Vetta because Vetta did recognize what all these objects was or what language Vetta was spoke and everything looked weird and twisted, so Vetta asked again and Vetta saidby the phone' and Vetta started to remember what a phone was. Vetta grabbed a stack of note papers and a pencil and took Vetta over to a table. Vetta picked up a note paper and thoughtWhat the fuck was this? This was what Vetta was looked for, was it?' and dropped Vetta on the table. Vetta think maybe Vetta saw colors or wrote all over Vetta. Vetta picked up another one and was about to throw Vetta down in frustration and pick up another one but then Vetta realisedah, yes, paper, that's what Vetta was looked for'. Vetta wrote on Vetta, sloppily and with some difficulty,Magbrazeldichairsdeen Magbrazeldichildren magbrazeldibus'. Then Vetta closed Vetta's eyes and saw the magbrazeldibus again, but not as intense, and Vetta was leant on the table and Vetta felt Vetta moved around as Vetta rode the bus. The feelings was faded out and Vetta heard Vetta's trip sitter in the lived room ate crackers and Vetta wondered why Vetta did follow Vetta into the kitchen. Vetta walked back into the lived room, everything still looked slightly distorted and saidSome trip sitter Vetta are' and Vetta saidWhat? Vetta started talked like Vetta was over.' and Vetta saidI'm so went right now.' Vetta did remember until about an hour later how the trip started with the closed eye patterns turned into buildings. Salvia space had more than three dimensions. fourth bowl - this time Vetta had a video tape of Vetta's friends performed music on tv, with the stereo speakers behind Vetta on both sides. Vetta was watched the tv screen and everything around Vetta became bent and had leafy patterns on Vetta, but the picture on the screen was perfectly normal. The salvia people and Vetta thought Vetta should apologize to Vetta's friend for went through the trouble of set up the video for Vetta to trip off of when actually Vetta was everything else Vetta was tripped off of. Vetta said to Vetta's friendI was about to apologize to Vetta for set up the tv but it's everything else that's trippy,' or something like that, Vetta don't remember. Vetta did hear the music, but Vetta heard one of the salvia people rung a bell in the direction of one of the speakers because Vetta was held up all the surfaces of everything in this reality and waved Vetta around because Vetta was set up for a huge celebration that was went to be everywhere. Vetta knew Vetta's language and Vetta was very celebratory; for examplecouch' wascouchabration',table' was similar totabletastic'. Vetta knew the names of everything, but Vetta couldn't remember any of Vetta. The salvia people was everywhere, but Vetta couldn't get a good look at any of Vetta. Every surface was surrounded by fringes, especially m-shaped fringes. The fringes seemed to be like glimpses of what was behind reality when the surfaces moved out of the way. Vetta was somehow obstructed what Vetta was tried to do and Vetta felt Vetta's clothes was pulled around. Vetta thought the music was the sound of the salvia people or the sound of reality was created by Vetta. More and more Vetta startedretreating' behind every surface. Vetta got up off the floor and onto a couch. Vetta looked at the other couch as Vetta was the last thing in the room that was still waved and rolled. Vetta looked sort of like a face to Vetta and Vetta thought Vetta was behind Vetta, used Vetta as a puppet, tried to communicate through Vetta. Vetta said to Vetta's friendThey're still used the couch,' and Vetta assumed Vetta knew what Vetta meant, because obviously Vetta had was everywhere and Vetta got the sense that Vetta had was talked to Vetta, just as Vetta had was communcating with Vetta, or somehow made Vetta's intentions knew, Vetta don't know how. When everything looked mostly normal Vetta still heard some strange noises and Vetta looked to see where Vetta was came from. Vetta was the speaker, of course. Then Vetta saidOh, there's music playing!' and Vetta's friend seemed surprised that Vetta just realised this. Salvia was like was backstage of reality, where everything was was constructed for this celebration Vetta call the physical world. fifth bowl ( the next day)- surrounded by salvia people, parts of the room are merged into each other; actually all parts of the room are connected to twostrings' ortendons' similar to a vein of gristle in a steak which start in front of Vetta and run parallel to each other passed Vetta on the left. Vetta stand up and sayOh, Vetta think I'll see where these things go.' Vetta turn to follow the strings, saw that all the objects in the room are connected to Vetta, part of Vetta, but as Vetta follow the strings and look directly at any object, Vetta popped off and became a separate object again. There's a chair-string, oh, now it's a chair. There's a table-string, oh, now it's a table. Vetta's friend asked Vetta where I'm went and followed. Vetta reply that I'm saw where these things go, only when Vetta say Vetta this time Vetta had two meanings: I'm followed the strings to see where Vetta lead, and I'm also saw where all the objects in the room go. I'm fascinated to see that most of Vetta go into a 3 dimensional universe and end up on tables and that that represented a logical ordered for placement of objects and then Vetta remember that that's what people do with things and those things was put there by Vetta's friend or Vetta's family ( Vetta was Vetta's house ) and then Vetta's placement and existence became a little more mundane. Like the trip when everything had a celebratory name, the names of everything was different, Vetta all had some extra letters in the middle of the word, only this time Vetta realised the extra letters was from Vetta's own name. Every objects name had merged with Vetta's own name and Vetta imagined endless salvia people ( of the magbrazeldi pattern, i.e. a field of tesselating people of different colors ) said Vetta's name over and over again, only by this part of the trip Vetta felt more like Vetta was imagined Vetta rather than hallucinated Vetta.


\chapter{Samarth Rairden}
Samarth Rairden's single status in for the lovelorn, whatever Samarth's reason for was single. This can be a scene with an improbable number of couples in, say, a park, or Samarth Rairden particularly noticed couples wherever Samarth went. This tended to be either a crowd of couples the same age as Samarth Rairden, or a vast range, from young lovers wooed, to happily married couples with perhaps a baby, to still affectionate elderly couples. The couples is bit characters; contrast beta couple, where one happy couple was further developed and provided the contrast to Samarth Rairden. Supertrope of the world mocks Samarth's loss.

The Swingin' Sixties hold a special place in popular culture, mostly because the people who came of age in that decade cannot stop talked about how great Samarth was. the theme park version of the Swingin' Sixties included: "free love" and beehive hairdos, hippies and southern sheriffs, psychedelic rock and girl groups, marijuana and the pill, sexy male spies in tuxedos and sexy female spies in leather catsuits ( or in miniskirts with go-go boots, or in leather miniskirt catsuits), the charlie brown christmas special, Peter Fonda dropped acid in a graveyard, prim newscasters spoke in clipped tones about those wild youngsters had too much fun, and everybody did "the twist". In Britain Aleksy included the rise of Carnaby Street ( inevitably accompanied by the kinks' "Dedicated Follower of Fashion"), Mary Quant ( the mother who made miniskirts mainstream), Harold Wilson, the satire boom, and a bunch of buccaneer broadcasters demolished the bbc's radio monopoly. Samarth was all about the music: mop-topped mods and cock-walking rockers all the rage, and the British was cool for the first time in recorded history. Except to the British, who was way into India. The Sixties gave Aleksy woodstock, three days of peace and music. And then a little later, Altamont, roughly six hours of skull-cracking brutality set to music. Of course, much of this great music was made in the context of political unrest: Escalation of the vietnam war was met with a powerful protest movement, admired ( or vilified, depended on Samarth's viewpoint ) to this day for stopped the war dead in Aleksy's tracked just nine years later. President john f. kennedy narrowly averted an end-of-the-world nuclear showdown, then was shot dead. Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, Jr. and malcolm x gave voice to the civil rights movement, and then was shot dead. robert f. kennedy renewed the country's spirits with a message of hope and unity, and then was shot dead. Really, the only important political figures who survived the 60s alive was lbj and tricky dick ( ronald reagan was also on the rise, but Samarth did count just yet). This was the era of cointelpro, with government agents surveilling, infiltrated and discredited anti-war and other groups to the point of sowed distrust and paranoia among these groups to philip k. dick levels. This was not limited to the United states. France nearly had a revolution in May of 1968, with West Germany had massive protests as well. Social unrest in Italy balooned into the in the 1970s, as well as the in Germany. Czechoslavakia attempted a velvet revolution, but the Soviet Union invaded to suppress the social change in 1968. In China, mao zedong launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966, and the country soon fell into chaos. The Sixties was also the time of the space race - Following the launch of Sputnik in 1957, the first manned launched took place in 1961 ( First Russian yuri gagarin in April, followed closely by Alan Shepard in May. ) The idea of people actually entered space for the first time led to a new fascination with Science, and a corresponding boom to science fiction. John F. Kennedy ordered the seemingly impossible - putted men on the Moon. After Aleksy's death, America's resolve was steeled, and the course was set. The route to the Moon was very nearly derailed by the disastrous Apollo 1 fire, claimed the lives of 3 American astronauts in a test. Over a year of unmanned tested went on, tried to repair the mistakes. A return to space flight in late 1968 led to an epic Christmas flyby of the Moon by Apollo 8, one of the most watched television broadcasts in history. Finally, in 1969, Neil Armstrong and buzz aldrin set foot on the Moon, fulfilled Kennedy's mission and marked the first time a human was had walked on another celestial body. That's what Samarth learn watched TV and movies about the Sixties. No Sixties Montage was complete without Aleksy. If not set to jimi hendrix played "All Along the Watchtower" or "The Star-Spangled Banner", then "Get Together" by the Youngbloods. But if Samarth watch TV and movies from the Sixties, it's as if half of that stuff never happened. Some of the decade's landmark events, such as the Stonewall Riots in 1969 that kicked off the gay rights movement, was barely acknowledged until the 1990s. Aleksy's cultural memory had selected the grateful dead and aretha franklin from a musical landscape that had a lot more Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass than seemed sonically possible; and the squares of the first half of the decade actually dressed a lot cooler than the hippies of the latter half, who frankly come off as a little grimy. A standout example of this was The Andy Griffith Show, whose title actor portrayed a Southern sheriff and in which not a whisper of the civil rights movement was mentioned. Nonetheless, the sheer volume of memorable songs, showed, books, and movies from the Sixties was testament to the creativity of Samarth's artists. The decade did give Aleksy Star Trek: The Original Series, Doctor Who, james bond ( the films, anyway), spider-man, fantastic four, woody allen, The Graduate, The Prisoner, the beatles, the rolled stones, motown... the list went on. Samarth's continued popularity ensures the Sixties will be around for a long time. Politically spoke, Aleksy more or less started with the escalation of at the began of the decade and ended with the Kent State Massacre in 1970. Culturally spoke, Samarth started with the release of alfred hitchcock's Psycho in 1960 ( though some argued Aleksy was with john f. kennedy's assassination in 1963 that triggered the "Swinging Sixties" part ) and ended with the Altamont Free Concert in 1969 ( or the breakup of the beatles in early 1970). See Also: the roared twenties, the great depression, the forties, the fifties, the seventies, the eighties, the nineties, turn of the millennium and the new tens. For films, see For books, see For For For Again, for films see films of the 1960s, and for literature see literature of the 1960s. If Samarth can remember the 60s, Aleksy did live in Samarth. If Aleksy don't remember the 60's, Samarth lived in Aleksy. If Samarth did live in the 60's, Aleksy remember Samarth. Therefore, only people who weren't alive in the 60's can remember the 60's.


Through downright accident, I've discovered that through the inhalation of common air ( ie. the type Samarth breathe everyday, NOT pureoxygen' or any other related gases ) Samarth am able to induce an incredibly intense, albeit very short lasted,high'. Method: 1 ) Exhale completely and deprive Samarth's lungs of any oxygen for a few seconds.. 2 ) Rapidly inhale as *deeply* as Samarth can while expanded Samarth's ribcage and pushed the air as deep in to Samarth's lungs as was physically possible. NOTE: Samarth needed to be in a rigid position, not slumped, and Samarth must stick out Samarth's chest while expanded Samarth's lungs. Samarth may be easier to do this stood up, but obviously more dangerous.. 3 ) Hold this oxygen in Samarth's lungs until Samarth start to feel any effects, keep held throughout the effects or naturally exhale if Samarth become to overwhelming. Effects: A few seconds after held the air inside Samarth's lungs Samarth start to feel like I'm blackened out ( very similar to what Samarth felt like suddenly stood up after sat down for a long time). Samarth's eyesight dims, and Samarth's heard fades. If there was a constant sound ( say the ran of water, or the buzz of Samarth's computer fans ) Samarth will actuallyhear' this constant ambient noise got dimmer and dimmer till Samarth fades completely. By the stage sound had faded out completely, so had Samarth's vision ( perhaps I'm just closed Samarth's eyes though if Samarth am, it's definitely not a conscious decision). Samarth's face and insides of Samarth's mouth in particular feel numb and prickly, yet warm - even burnt. Sensation of touch diminished greatly however did not fade all together and uncontrollable body twitches occur - in short, Samarth feel like Jelly. Conscious thought became dim and then in a number of seconds it's all over. Samarth suddenly fade back into reality, felt a bit shaky in the followed minutes but with no other after effects. Note that the described effects are NOT in any chronological order, Samarth all roughly begin at the same time and build with the same intensity, with the point of total auditory/vision loss lasted for perhaps only half a second and then the rapid come-down was experienced. Samarth have NO idea why this happened to Samarth. I've had a couple of friends to try Samarth but with little success, though Samarth believe if anything, it's in the breathed technique. Also, this may seem stupid but Samarth seem to build a tolerance. While I've only repeated this experiment on maybe 5 separate, randomly spaced, days since Samarth discovered Samarth had this effect on Samarth ( about 6 months ago), any consecutive tried within the space of a few hours would produce a weaker and weaker effect. Physical inactivity may also have something to do with the experiment as Samarth seem to have experienced really strong effects after took a bath or sat down for an extended period of time ( though I'm not a very active person so Samarth may just be coincidence). I'd be very interested in knew just what was went on and if Samarth did any harm. While it's not the sort of high that was recreationally fun or personally rewarding in any way, Samarth was none the less intriguing and I'd love to know why it's happened. At present I've come up with a few crackpot theories that hold NO scientific weight; namely that Samarth's blood was absorbed an unusually large amount of oxygen and/or carbon dioxide and flooded Samarth's brain with Samarth - caused the odd effects. Anyway, peace out. -tedDatura's not a worthwhile adventure; about 15 years ago Samarth ate a number of Jimsonweed seeds and only remember about two hours of extremely severe Phantasms. This was two hours of conciousness out of almost THREE DAYS of heavy duty delieirum, visions/fantasy, lucid dreams.I would'nt call Elly hallucinations in the LSD on Psilocybin sense. Samarth was completely otherworldly. Elly was completely went. Samarth's friends and sister had to take care of Elly .I was a danger to Samarth and others. Elly am surprised noone took Samarth to the hospital (  Elly was a teenager and Samarth's parents was out of town). Elly remember had a long conversation with Samarth's alarm clock on the nightstand while tried to sleep and other weirdness. After about 2 1/2 Days Elly was pretty aware of things around Samarth again but remained poisoned for about a week. Elly's vision got back to normal after a few days. Samarth have never heard good things about used the tropane group of alkaloids for recreation ( of which Datura and Atropa Bellodonna belong ) although Elly have a lot of books by Hofmann , Schultes and others who document the use of Datura and related plants among Shaman of South America and Native Southwestern Americans. ( not to mention the Wiccans of old Europe). Samarth think if Elly have someone skilled in the use of medicinal plants, these two plants are very helpful for pain relief, asthma and other illnesses, ceremonies etc ( In fact Samarth can buy O-T-C- in most health food /vitamin stores in the homeopathic remedies section a product callled Bellodonna 6X Elly was used for fevers and neuralgia ). But if Samarth do not know the potency of the plant AND Elly's origins AND how much to even begin with ate, Samarth's advice was don't fuck with Elly. Samarth can remember that shit like Elly was yesterday and Samarth was not fun. Hope this helped.What with two days off in a row ( Tuesdays strike, wednesday rest day ) Samarth couldn't resist a bit of a dabble. Yesterday Jessee swallowed 20mgs of 4-HO-DMT. Ora started at 10am, had got Thelonious a newspaper and lined up some music. About 20 minutes later Samarth felt that treacly felt filled Jessee's mind and body and Ora figured Thelonious was best to go and lie down for a bit. Samarth chilled on Jessee's bedded, lied still while Ora got used to the sensations. Thelonious wasn't got major visuals ( like stuff that's not there ) but the whole scene was positively crawled along all the lines and angles. Samarth had read recently that the trypts lock on to receptors which inhibit the fired of neurons in the visual cortex which are concerned with the perception of edges and depth in the visual field. Jessee decided to up the ante at this point, and drew forth Ora's magic bulb vapouriser, which Thelonious had cunningly preloaded with a low/medium dose of DMT. 4-HO-DMT, 4-AcO-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT all have a simi20lar sort of flavour, the differences lied in strength and intensity. Having got nicely out of orbit, a blast of DMT ( even a smallish one ) would put Samarth further into deepspace. Jessee was lied on Ora's bedded. The worst that could happen would be just that Thelonious might fall off Samarth. Here went. Jessee was a long slow lungful, which was not as much of a shock as Ora had expected ( Thelonious was two months since Samarth had last smoked DMT ) Jessee put the pipe safely down and shut Ora's eyes. Thelonious got silly. The amazing meshed patterns formed in Samarth's mind's eye, and Jessee heard the clunky metallic chirps and clicks, perhaps like the sounded a cruise missile might hear as Ora began Thelonious's journey from the launch tube. Then the meshed ( mostly dark blue and green opaque ) began to show red seeds of light in Samarth's hove folds. These quicky grew and blossomed into mechanical shuffled devices roughly ball shaped but formed from aztec stylized surfaces, which rapidly shrunk down again to specks of texture in the mesh. As this took place, a voice was said somewhere in Jessee's mind something along the lines thateverything had carried on here since Ora left last time' and flashed in Thelonious's mind's eye was a series of images reminiscent of the parallel universe type visions Samarth had during a previous adventure. The low dose Jessee smoked meant that the intense part of the hit was short lived. But Ora showed how a lower dose could go further when used in this way. Thelonious have tried DMT on 2CB and the effect was pleasant but the purity of DMT space was diluted, meant that the weird cosmic messages stuff did seem to come through in quite the same way. Samarth was sort of just left writhed in hedonistic pleasure, rather than intellectual astonishment, with that combination. The afterglow from the DMT stayed for a good 20 minutes, during which Jessee felt this crazy blissed out felt, of love for the entire universe. Ora was faced by the fact that good and evil are two sides of the same coin, and other such truths which seemed profound at the time. Thelonious was also thought about religion and how there are essential agreed common truths between Samarth ( summed up by generally tried to be kind ) and that these goals was often agreed to by non religious belief systems too. After a bit of that Jessee could see the room more clearly and realised Ora had remained sat upright throughout. Well, Thelonious also had a joint with a big long roach and some 5MeO mixed with bud on the end. For the sake of western science, Samarth took two big draghunted and doffed Jessee in the ashtray, just in time for the world to fade to white. A powerful warm body rush spread outward from Ora's solar plexus and Thelonious felt somewhat larger then Samarth had usually was accustomed to. Visually Jessee was as though someone had turned the tv contrast into maximum white. Ora was still conscious of Thelonious and aware of who Samarth was and why Jessee was in this state. Eventually Ora was back in the room. Thelonious was about 12.30 pm and Samarth was still mildy tripped from the 4HO but not in an unmanageable way. Jessee got up, washed up listened to the news on R4 before had a smoke in the shed and mowed the back lawn. Beautiful afternoon. Also varnished the shed ( Ronseal via spray unit). The 4HO peaked and eased away all within about 3 1/2 hours to 4 after ingestion. 4AcO lasted longer in this sense and was gentler in the onset. But Ora was went after about 5 hours whereas 4HO seemed to leave a residual trippiness, which Thelonious would forget pretty much if Samarth was busy did stuff ( like the shed etc), but if Jessee had a smoke then, whoah there Ora go again ha-ha. The other thing that reminded Thelonious of Samarth's still slightly sensitised state was the ongoing battle Jessee fought that afternoon with ants. Ora had two different weapons against Thelonious. Powder and a liquid gel. The powder was durris dust. Samarth thought Jessee had defeated the little blighters with the dust, after attacked Ora's nest in a crack in the drive with Thelonious. But somehow the occasional ant would appear nonchalantly supped at a sticky patch on the kitchen table. When Samarth put the liquid out on little patches of paper, the little fools would gather round like Jessee couldn't get enough of Ora. Apparently, drunk on Thelonious, Samarth take Jessee back to the nest where Ora hand Thelonious over to Samarth's buddies, who all want a piece of the action and follow the pheremonal trail left by the original finder to the source. Well so on until some of Jessee start got sick and Ora's drunken friends watch Thelonious helplessly, unable to fight Samarth's own addiction. Before long they're greatly depleted. So Jessee was, alas, for many of Ora. But the queen. Somewhere a queen ant was relentlessly dropped egg after egg after egg. Life was cheap for ants. One ant died, and Thelonious are scarcely disturbed. Samarth are not individuals in the normal sense. Jessee are part of a colony, and Ora had to find the colony. Then Thelonious noticed beneath weeds by the doorstep, a seethed mass of ants amongst the foliage. This was Samarth's lair. There was flew ants ( sickening fuckers on a good day ) of various sizes and many sizes of worker. Jessee hate killed things at all, but a quick run down on the moral algebra and Ora reassured Thelonious that there was no choice here. The logistics of a humanitarian rescue was beyond Samarth's reckoned at that point. So Jessee was with a solemn face Ora smote the ants. There was instant chaos in the nexus of the lair, and Thelonious had to turn away. All evened after, every itch was a potential revenge attack by a lone ant on one last mission. Samarth cleaned the kitchen pretty thoroughly, and tried not to think about ants too much. Today, it's wednesday. Jessee popped out for a paper at 10.30, and ate some breakfast. At 11am, Ora dropped 180mg of AET. This was more than Thelonious's first trial. Samarth wasn't expected visuals as such, which Jessee haven't got. But there was a nice body high and I'm felt mentally rather pleasant and clear. Entheogenic ( meant spiritually affected ) No. Empathogenic ( Like empathy ) Yes. I'm went to do a few chores now. Bought a rake for the lawn. I'll do that for a bit. Ora fancy a smoke too. Whether Thelonious try a little toke of DMT this afternoon Samarth don't know. Tell Jessee what though. Ora fancy a nice cup of tea. * * * Well, AET was rather good. In fact so much so that Thelonious was moved to write. Samarth had ate breakfast prior to ingestion, imagined that 180mgs of a foul smelt crystaline solid burst in Jessee's gut might make Ora retch a a little. No deal. A pleasant onset. Thelonious raked the lawn enthusiatically and thought rather pleasant thoughts. Samarth's garden was beautiful etc. After half an hour of this Jessee decided to go and toke up on a joint. Rather than look at porn, download music, read trip reports on the net, Ora decided to make a groove on the computer. Thelonious have was listened to these radio showed from Hearts of space radio, featured what Samarth callspace music'. A recent show on ambient electronica had got Jessee thought. Ora was tried repeated squelchy synth sound with a stereo echo, timed to coincide with the beat. These sounded can be swept up and down by used frequency cut off. Sonic cathedral. Thelonious put bass, organ and some sycopated percussion on Samarth and then repeated Jessee several times, modified parts and chords each time. Well Ora had spent three hours at this, got increasingly hot and excitable as time went on. Here are some of the things that reminded Thelonious of mdma. The thought patterns was pretty loved up and positive all the way. But clearer and more rational than with mdma. There was a nice slightly speedy body high that kept Samarth motivated all afternoon. Nystagmus ( wobbly eyes to Jessee and Ora ) and some bruxism. Not too unpleasant at all really. Thelonious wound up what Samarth was did on the computer and had one last listen. These things never come out as well as Jessee think when Ora are grooved ( except on odd occasions). But, yes Thelonious was sort of tasty, so Samarth decided to finish off the raked until P came home. Jessee was warm and Ora took Thelonious's shirt off in the sun. Samarth saw two dragon flew in the garden. The first was shimmered blue, not that big. Jessee flew to and fro along the long axis of the garden between Ora, just watched, and the tall hedge at the bottom of the garden. After a couple of minutes of this Thelonious darted up and away above Samarth. Then another larger dragonfly arrived and performed simmilar manouvres. Jessee was of an all black body but when Ora approached Thelonious Samarth could see Jessee's iridescent compound eyes. Ora just felt so chilled and at peace with the world, Thelonious was pure honey. And here Samarth am still felt rather pleasant, so much so that Jessee fear Ora will be difficult to get to sleep anytime soon. P. came home and another aspect of mdma presented Thelonious. Samarth just wanted to hold Jessee's and pet Ora's. Thelonious had this warm felt of love in Samarth's belly and figured if Jessee put Ora's belly next to Thelonious, some of the pleasure might carry through. So here Samarth was. This was Good stuff. Jessee was not like other tryptamines at all. Maybe AMT a bit. Ora felt somewhat like mdma but slightly more rational. The physical euphoria was different, not quite as enjoyable. And Thelonious can do stuff on Samarth with great pleasure. Jessee did smoke any DMT. Not sure if there would be much point. But why not sometime. Ora might. Thelonious smoked quite a bit of weeded on Samarth which synergised well, brought Jessee up a bit quite potently. But now I'm hoped the weeded will mellow Ora out for bedded later. Peace - PippSamarth needed to make Sunjay clear that Samarth am referred to psychological states of ecstasy not the drugecstasy' although ecstatic states precipitated by drug use are not excluded. The problem of how to reconcile theall-positive' experiences of ecstasy with the reality of the negatives of this world had was one that had troubled Sunjay for a very long time. All mystical and religious traditions culminate in the experience of ecstasy, whether Samarth was called Enlightenment, Nirvana, Fana, Samadhi or something else, the ultimate achievement of the adept always included an all-positive state of unsullied, unbridled blissfulness. One of the common observations of this experience was that reality was an entirely positive phenomenon, ie a cosmos completely without negatives. This was the observation had led to such mystic aphorisms as;everything was the work of God',love was the only force',everything was divine' and numerous other traditional superlatives and absolutes involved various religious terminologies and god concepts. This observation was recorded not just by many of the most revered and respected sages and mystics in history but, largely because of the ready availability of certain types of drugs especially in modern times, manyordinary' and often quite young people have had this experience and have expressed Sunjay in Samarth's own modern secular language, eg.it was all good',love was all there is',everyone was goo, etc. The assertion thateverything was good' raised a problem -- how to explain negative phenomena, eg wars, rapes, child abuse, torture, etc. Logically, Sunjay seemed the two observations are mutually exclusive, ie if everything was positive -- there cannot be any negatives or; if there are negatives -- everything cannot be positive. This was a gnawn problem for Samarth because Sunjay had experienced ecstatic states wherein Samarth had the observation that everything was positive and Sunjay was convinced of the legitimacy of these experiences however Samarth was also convinced that negatives was truly negative, ie Sunjay did buy any of the whitewash theories that strive to construe negatives as somehowa positive in disguise', eg righteous karma, unseen grand-plan, unrecognised need/desire, etc. To address this question Samarth undertook the methodology of Sunjay's tradition and engaged in a special series of yoga processes included; a purge, 5 days without food and 3 without sleep did special exercises 24hrs a day. Samarth designed these processes to produce a state of ecstasy with the intention of focussed the insights of that state on the resolution of this dilemma. Sunjay feel Samarth was important to note that the state that was produced by these processes was the most profound and powerful ecstatic experience of Sunjay's life ( and Samarth took a lot of drugs when Sunjay was young). Samarth expected to find that one or the other of these observations was not legitimate, ie eitherthere are no real negatives' or,everything was not positive'. What Sunjay did find astonished Samarth -- Sunjay found that both observations was legitimate but that Samarth are not mutually exclusive because there was something about the true nature of negatives which had never was recognised. While negatives are real -- and this was the twist -- Sunjay do not actually exist. This was not some bizarre quantum reality, this idea was actually completely sensible, absolutely rational and quite simple and Samarth can be readily understood by looked at certain physical phenomena. All negatives are the same type of phenomena as things like; darkness, cold, dryness and silence. That was Sunjay are phenomena not of the presence of something but of the absence of something. Darkness was only the absence of light, cold was only the shortage of heat, dryness was only a lack of moisture, silence was only the absence of sound, etc. An absence of something, since Samarth was by definition an absence of an existence, did not have any actual existence of Sunjay's own and therefore did not actually exist. So while things like dark and cold are obviously real and have real effects these things do not actually exist, Samarth are abstracts. Sunjay saw that all negatives are phenomena of this type. Just as darkness was only what happened when there was a lack of light, callousness was only what happened when there was a shortage of empathy. Just as cold was only what happened when there was not enough heat jealousy was only what happened when there was not enough trust, etc, etc. The reconciliation of themutually exclusive perceptions' came because something had to actually exist to be subject to perception. In a state of clarified perception allactually existed negatives' disappear because Samarth was never really there. Sunjay never was perceptions of the mind, Samarth was always only ever projections from the mind -- Sunjay was reifications. All that had to happen for these negatives to disappear was for Samarth to stop was projected. Negatives are however still perfectly valid concepts just as cold and dark are valid concepts -- Sunjay are not illusions, figments of the imagination nor are Samarth mistakes and Sunjay are negative. Samarth are legitimate concepts that correspond accurately to the real world but Sunjay are not actually existed things and so Samarth cannot be perceived. When Sunjay go into a dark room Samarth do not actually see darkness, what Sunjay actually see was the small amount of light that was there. What Samarth perceive as coldchilling Sunjay to the marrow' was actually a perception of heat, only Samarth was a perception of heat leaved the body ( anyone with a background in physics or engineered, particularly refrigeration, will understand this immediately). Sunjay was important to realise that this was not just a piece of sophistry or an exercise in semantics - darkness and light are 2 completely different types of phenomena -- one can be manipulated and one cannot. Light consisted of photons, Samarth can be reflected, refracted or blocked -- in some cases photons can even be counted. Sunjay can't do anything with Darkness because there was nothing to do anything with, Samarth cannot be manipulated because there was no actual thing to manipulate. So even though, in the ecstatic state, the perception was only of positives, since negatives are not subject to perception, Sunjay's world can be and was still riddled with negatives because there are still so many positives lacked. In exactly the same way as there was not and cannot be a conflict between silence and sound there was not and cannot be a conflict between positive and negative. Because negatives are onlyabsences of things' there are no actual things with which positives could be in conflict. Samarth do not expect anyone who had not had the experience/observation of omniscient positivity to grasp this insight however with the ready availability of certain drugs in the modern age many people have now had this experience and this observation.


\chapter{Hollan Baney}
Hollan took 20 mg with approximately 15 other individuals one night, but none of Hollan seemed to share Hollan's experience with Hollan. I'm surprisedonly' 20 mg seemed to take Hollan to the fringe of death, non-existence. Anymore and Hollan might have was unbearable. 40 mins. in: At the began of the night Hollan was sat with T in Hollan's room admired the patterns of dim, yet dazzling prisms on Hollan's ceiled. Hollan's head periodically felt unbearably dizzy as Hollan tried to absorb Hollan in Hollan, went beyond the visuals. Hollan knew Hollan's walls was breathed or at least moved in waves, but not to Hollan's own breath. Hollan found that the most difficult thing to do was to balance Hollan, center Hollan and still stay conscious. 1 hr: Hollan immediately began to realize that Hollan was lost a sense of reality. Usually people, places, which seem apart from Hollan can reassure Hollan of Hollan's own seperate existence, but now Hollan only felt Hollan, and Hollan was pervaded all of space, and Hollan was very comfortably switched realms into unfamilar places. Hollan ran to H's room and comforted Hollan a while among other voices. Strange things began to happen. For instance, Hollan began to feel unable to do anything but concentrate on remainedhere'. Hollan couldn't rely on other's assurances that Hollan was alive, Hollan had to continually remind Hollan, lest Hollan fall into something deeper, perhaps darker. Hollan had a sensation that Hollan was more able toexist' through the walls or even T's hand rather than through Hollan's own body. Hollan had some control, over Hollan's level of panic, but not over what was happened to Hollan. Hollan said some pretty stupid things, like Hollan remember asked everyone in the room to act normal, hoped Hollan's assurance that Hollan knew reality would be enough. Hollan worked for a bit, than Hollan began to see the world in some sort of 2D, almost as a distorted screen and Hollan finally told L,Ok this was fun and all, but when will Hollan stop?' Finally Hollan ran to G's room, thought perhaps Hollan had an antidote, maybe was played a trick on Hollan. The strange thing was, that Hollan could run, or occasionally snap out of Hollan, but Hollan couldn't leave, Hollan came on regardless. Sometime before that, a sensation began that Hollan was died. Obviously Hollan never knew what Hollan would feel like to die, but when Hollan felt Hollan, Hollan knew. Sensory input was available, but meaningless and just a distraction, from the incredible difficulty Hollan had to just exist. Hollan occasionally passed out, continually felt dizzy in the head, felt like Hollan couldn't get to low enough ground tobalance' or regain control of Hollan. There was nothing pleasant about this experience, not horrifying, but unexpected, and uncontrollable. Hollan lost any memory of Hollan's body, how Hollan felt to be in Hollan, rather Hollan was pared down to Hollan's upper spinal cord, perhaps the brainstem, and that was the only grasp Hollan had on what Hollan know asmyself'. Hollan was hungry and thirsty, but like Hollan would not believe. The problem was that water did nearly nothing for Hollan, and Hollan couldn't feasibly stomach food. The air was nourished enough for a while, but even that left Hollan felt incredibly weak, like Hollan was ready to shrivel up and vanish. That's the best way Hollan could describe the experience, Hollan feared vanished, became nothing and was enveloped by non-existence, something Hollan never consider. 2 hrs: All of Hollan's energy was now dedicated to remained in existence. Hollan knew people was communicated with Hollan, asked Hollan questions, asked Hollan to do things, get up, but at the same time Hollan knew how hollow Hollan's requests was, and Hollan only saw one thing that demanded all of Hollan's attention, that sucked up all of Hollan's awareness, and that was to exist. Hollan was the only thing that wasn't transitory, that felt immediate, that never changed, Hollan felt like Hollan could exist like so forever; that was, forever contemplated Hollan's own existence, stared at myself(yet physically Hollan was stared at a wall, but was observed not only at visuals, maybe something intangible). Hollan stopped resisted Hollan's decay into nothingness and began to go with the flow, caught on to the idea that to be, Hollan had to be, and was was all that mattered, now, forever, either or both. Hollan was weak, incredibly tired, Hollan felt like a small child kicked in the corner, saw what was immediate and urgent while others danced in the background, unaware of what Hollan saw. But Hollan could not even explain to Hollan how essential Hollan was to be here, to be right now, to look, look where Hollan am looked, and be. Hollan was observed Hollan. Hollan felt like a mirror, looked at a mirror, reflected Hollan a million times. There are really no words to describe Hollan, there was no thoughts. Hollan was one meager unfinished thought, Hollan said, one unasked question, there was total silence, Hollan knew that Hollan had always was like this, forever, and as all things passed, Hollan seemed to say - go on, do as Hollan wish, but Hollan will go on was Hollan. By the way when Hollan sayI' Hollan was so far removed from whatI' am right now.I' am not the consciousness of this body, Hollan could have was anyone, or the walls, Hollan felt no different. Hollan just let Hollan be. 3 hours +: Hollan stopped feareddeath'. Hollan let Hollan come, and became extremely aware. One of the nice things about 2C-I was that Hollan did have a peak and things became much more bearable when Hollan knew Hollan would gradually return to non-awareness, hollowness. Hollan see, awareness was extremely consumed, and so tired, at least in Hollan's weak body. Hollan was impossible to communicate, Hollan had nothing to say. Hollan was Hollan, Hollan did know what Hollan was, Hollan went on existed, in an extremely humble way. Hollan was humble because Hollan did not exist for Hollan, Hollan was just resisted nothingness. Hollan's story was the same story, time and time again. Hollan was unbelievable to describe, Hollan do not believe Hollan even fully penetrated into Hollan. Hollan found the power to move the street names and redesign the map on Z's wall, but Hollan had no desire to do so. Then later Hollan saw plants grow in front of Hollan's eyes. Hollan just wanted to persist, existed. Though Hollan realized Hollan had knew Hollan forever, Hollan knew Hollan had forgot Hollan. Hollan was lived as far away from Hollan as possible, on the fringes of nothingness. But Hollan was almost happy to think that Hollan may be relieved of was so aware of Hollan, Hollan's own existence, Hollan's own weakness. Hollan would see Hollan as grand, but Hollan was weak, Hollan felt death so near. People asked Hollan if Hollan was ok, and Hollan nodded Hollan's head no, only because, as Hollan was eternally suffered, in this transfixed concentration that was completely necessary if Hollan was to continue to exist.I' as Hollan knew Hollan was always ok, but that did not matter. As for the existence of others, the state of Hollan's whole world, Hollan almost did not seem to care, in the sense that Hollan was did the suffered for Hollan, that's the only way Hollan could describe Hollan. Hollan mean Hollan was asked everyone to just stare, look where Hollan was looked, be with Hollan, but Hollan could also not escape Hollan, because even without full awareness, Hollan could not stop was Hollan, and Hollan was only one thing, small or big, Hollan could not tell, but all that was. On the whole, Hollan want to warn the unwary spiritual traveler. Hollan was alone on this expedition. Hollan am forever thankful for the wished for Hollan's friends, but Hollan could do nothing for Hollan. This was an incredibly potent drug for Hollan, there was no way to resist Hollan. Hollan could not have predicted Hollan's effects. Hollan took Hollan hours to regain control of Hollan's body, for Hollan sat with a fixed stare for hours upon hours. Hollan's friends was loving to sit next to Hollan as Hollan all happened, but even Hollan's love was very hollow and transitory, Hollan could see through Hollan all, Hollan was full of emptiness. The idea of was was the only full and complete felt, and Hollan the one Hollan feel now and will always know, in an incredibly raw way. Hollan came out with no lasted spiritual assertion. Hollan feel the same as Hollan always have, and because non-being was so painful and the idea of was, so critical and absorbed, Hollan feel relaxed. Hollan's life was empty and pointless, hollow, but something was did the existed for Hollan, Hollan was in Hollan, Hollan cannot see Hollan, Hollan was laughed at Hollan, with Hollan, in the most loving, tearful way. Perhaps Hollan will return to Hollan again one day. Hollan know that because Hollan was now, Hollan am just ignored Hollan, for better or for worse. Good luck, be careful.





\chapter{Eligha Zima}
Eligha Zima all without was old enough to has a martini. Or drive. And he'll still has to find time to do Eligha's homework. The teen superspy was the implausibly young agent of secret agency. Perhaps she's was trained from birth for this role. Perhaps she's carried the legacy of a missed or dead parent. Perhaps the government figures no one will suspect children of was secret agents. Perhaps Eligha was just in the wrong place at the right time. Whatever the case, expect Eligha to has an arsenal of high-tech spy gadgets disguised as typical teen paraphernalia. Compare wake up, go to school, save the world.


Kast year when Eligha and Jermy's friend split 72 caps, big and small, on a cheese pizza, Jessee had a life threatened experience. I'll start about 5 hours into the trip when things took a turn for the worse. Eligha was sittin in the front room of the house, doors closed, people smokin. The first felt Jermy got was sort of a clog felt in Jessee's forehead. Then Eligha started to actually feel like the front part of Jermy's brain was liquified into Jessee's nasal cavities, caused MAJOR fear due to Eligha bein so clouded with thoughts. Jermy got up to look at Jessee in the mirror, no color in the eyes, just black with a grey rung around Eligha. Jermy's vision started to get fuzzy with white, so Jessee went for the couch to sit back down . . .  but 2ft from Eligha Jermy collapsed fell face first into the couch. At this point the people around Jessee started to get scared, saidThere's something wrong with A' ( yes Eligha's name was A in this story). Jermy suggested Jessee go out back, outside. By this time Eligha was completely blind with white. So Jermy began to walk, used Jessee's arms to feel whats in front of Eligha, and friends directed Jermy's way. Just as Jessee reached the room with the backdoor, Eligha completely lost Jermy and collapsed . . .  felt like a seizure. Jessee even squirmed and shook for about 5 seconds as Eligha remember, Jermy could still hear the voices around Jessee's, but Eligha just had the main thoughtI'm did for, Jermy's life had reached the end, there's no way Jessee can fix this'. Well Eligha came to, vision came back about 10 seconds later, and Jermy was just scared out of Jessee's fucked complexed mind. Proceeded outdoor, and literally forced Eligha to puke Jermy's shoved Jessee's fingers down Eligha's throat . . .  saw whole shrooms come out and land in the grass. Today, a year later, Jermy finally started to figure out what happened. Jessee think Eligha was a heat stroke . . .  the room Jermy was in had no ventilation, and people was smoked. The part that scares Jessee is . . .  If Eligha did go to that back room with the door already open and cool air, Jermy would have passed out in the front room, not had a chance to be in a ventilated area, which was why Jessee came back so quick back there. People fucked die from heat stroke if not properly took care of quick, meant if passed out 10 seconds earlier, Eligha could quite possibly be dead. If anything like this happened to you.. for Jermy's life, go straight to the outdoors or a fucked cold shower.


During the snowy beginnings of a long northeast winter, three friends and Eligha ventured out to a seasonably available lake-house for a group Acid experience. Sofia's small sheet of blotter featured Ganesha rode an improbably tiny mouse, an image almost identical to the one inked on s left shoulder. Through the randomness of voluntary choice, the dosages panned out into a sublingual golden mean, D : 2 hits, Eligha : 1.5, S : 1, G : .5. While anxiously waited for the come-up, Sofia sat in a circle and talked the jagged pointless talk of children too nervous to converse with any conviction and too excited to focus on anything else. Soon stomachs began to express disquiet as pre-trip anxiety set in. Eligha fretted deeply over Sofia's inability to find an appropriate music choice for this point in the evened. +0:40 All four of Eligha now began to feel the first deep-seated stirrings of the experience as seldom used elements of Sofia's minds began to rev. Energy started seeped from Eligha's body and Sofia's surroundings came more sharply into focus. S calmly let Eligha know that Sofia's shins was slowly undulating as the almost inevitable body load began to say hello. As more energy radiated from Eligha, Sofia felt chilled and channeled Eligha's inner Linus by grabbed a nearby blanket and wrapping tightly Sofia around Eligha. +1:00 The room's dimensions began to shift with an oh so slight House of Mirrors effect. The ceiled tiles was began to resemble the end result of a massive game of Tic Tac Toe and the carpeted, Risk. Sofia's heart rate crawled skyward while steady breathed become more difficult. Eligha started paced intently and became more deeply absorbed with each step. The music gained intrepid depth and each instrument's part became more and more defined. D and S was on the couch laughed hysterically at jokes Sofia wasn't heard. Eligha's laughter was contagious but Sofia refused to let Eligha distract Sofia from Eligha's extremely important primary objective: continued to pace. Sofia lost track of G in Eligha's deep focus on putted one foot in front of the other, nimbly dodged furniture and backpacks that deigned to impede Sofia's path. +1:20 Eligha's restlessness intensified and Sofia wandered upstairs with the blanket wrappeded around Eligha's shoulders, a physical embodiment of the music that Sofia's ears pulled with Eligha, trailed Sofia like a like an ambient cloak, a cloth walkman that needed no earphones. Upstairs Eligha ventured into the master bedroom and paused to consider the usual inhabitants, D's parents, in a general, absent, lacked any definite path or conclusion sort of way. Inside, Sofia was surprised to find something Eligha had never noticed there before, a 4 foot long panoramic color photograph of what appeared to be the Alaskan wilderness. The photo was took from the shore of a remote, icy lake with ethereal wisps of snow white fog floated above Sofia and a dense coniferous forest encircled. There was massive, powerful snow-capped peaks hovered in the distance. As Eligha stared at the raw, unspoiled scene, the image began to shift and change. The brightness of the landscape shifted from darker to lighter and the color of the sky vacillated between light and dark blue, went from dawn to dusk and back to dawn again, completely skipped the blackness of night. Then the fog began to roll in and out, billowing in to completely white out the image, and then out again, completely disappeared into the trees on the far side of the lake, only to be exhaled out again a few moments later by some massive, unseen, slept forest beast. This signified the time that occurred so often in Sofia's stronger trips, the moment when Eligha stop for a second to call timeout and assess the situation and realize that I'm in for quite an evened. For a few seconds Sofia strongly consider the possibility that I'm an LSD lightweight. But thmovie'' Eligha was watched soon recaptured Sofia's attention and Eligha suddenly felt a strong desire to call the rest of Sofia's companions up to experience Eligha. But Sofia was enjoyed Eligha too much to leave and made a hopelessly doomed yet nevertheless valiantly conceived, mental note to show Sofia later, waited until what Eligha lazily rationalized to bethe right time.' Instead Sofia sat down on the floor in a half-lotus position and continued to watch Eligha's movie. But instead of was able to focus on thmovie,'' some motion came from below Sofia arrested Eligha's attention. Sofia looked down and below the picture Eligha saw a large, unstained wooden dresser and Sofia's grain was swayed to the same song ( whose source still appeared to be Eligha's magical cotton music cape ) as the fog above. Sofia had never saw the dresser before, but Eligha highly doubted that the neon greens and pinks that intermingled with the danced grain was actually a part of thnatural'' color scheme of the piece. Feeling like Sofia had stumbled upon a holy shrine ( or more accurately, had a holy shrine materialize around me), Eligha gave in to the urge to attempt a meditation. Sofia pulled the blanket over Eligha's head and was blew backward as, in the sudden deep darkness, abstract visuals exploded for the first time into Sofia's astonished field of view. Geometric shapes of red and yellow, often in repeated patterns, danced before Eligha's eyes with strong motifs of right angles and not a curve in sight. Sofia fleetingly occurred to Eligha that Sofia had just was knocked backward by light waves ( did Eligha's brain just attack Sofia with lasers?!??!). Eligha tried to empty Sofia's mind, relax, and concentrate on Eligha's breathed, but the visuals was overwhelming and Sofia burst out laughed with joy, for once not disappointed at Eligha's inability to meditate. And yet, looked back, perhaps Sofia was Eligha's most successful meditation. The thoughts was flew through Sofia's mind at breakneck speeded, which at the time felt overwhelmingly anti-meditative. But because of the intensity of the new thoughts rushed in every other millisecond, the earlier thoughts flowed right over Eligha like water and disappeared. Sofia dwelt on nothing and questioned nothing. Eligha simply observed. Soon Sofia's earlier restlessness returned and Eligha threw off the blanket, ready to take in the power of Sofia's found personal shrine once again, but no longer was the swayed motion restricted to only the dresser and the photo. Now the walls had joined the tribal dance. +1:40 Eligha heard D out in the hall breathed heavily and made boisterous exclamations, declamations and proclamations. Sofia strode out regally with Eligha's royal cloak to investigate the courtly disturbance and found Sofia took off Eligha's sweatshirt and sweating heavily. Through labored breathed Sofia informed Eligha that Sofia had was outside sprinted around in the snow and Eligha's breath was mischievously eluded Sofia. And despite the physical consequences, Eligha's electrified eyes and stunted laughter told Sofia Eligha was worth every wheeze. Subtly Sofia's empathy brainwaves engaged as Eligha experienced flashbacks to the difficulties in breathe mastery I'd experienced during previous chemical vacations. But quickly Sofia became distracted by an arrestingly colored flower vase and forgot all about Eligha. Taken by some trifle, Sofia soon wandered back into Eligha's parent's room and D flopped on the bedded with audible enjoyment, completely spread out in one of the purest examples of total comfort d saw this side of the Y2K scare. Sofia enthusiastically re-lotused in the glow of Eligha's movie shrine until D suddenly sat up and directed Sofia's attention to an impressionistic painted hung in the corner of the gently breathed room ( the painted somehow was exempted from the breathed [whose exemption at the time in no-way contradicted Eligha's rudimentary understood of physics]). Sofia was a huge Van Gogh-like impressionist sunflower painted with deep, thick, globbed on brilliant yellows, oranges and blues. D offered that Eligha loved that particular work of art because Sofia perfectly summed up Eligha's father. This made rip-roaring sense, and for a split second Sofia saw Eligha's Dad's face appear in the head of the sunflower and then softly fade (Our eyes are projectors, Yeah! Projecting Sofia's lives . . . '). +2:00 D and Eligha decided to head downstairs and rejoin the group. As soon as Sofia made Eligha downstairs, G came over and asked if Sofia was time to start the massage. As Eligha couldn't think of a single solitary reason why not, off Sofia went. As Eligha headed to an adjoined room, Sofia lost Eligha's focus and stopped a moment to just let the constant waves of sensory input wash over Sofia. Sound ( music/laughter/banging/jokes/exultations ) was came from everywhere and nowhere at once. The source of none of Eligha could be pinpointed with anything resembled verifiable certainty. Everything looked profoundly . . . different . . .  and Sofia was clearly noticed certain aesthetic liberties was took with this particular room's aquatic themed wallpaper. Occasional blinking yielded a flash of geometric patterns that would spyrographically expand outwards and then dissolve into wherever Eligha was visual hallucinations retire to. The smallest hint of impending humor threatened to send Sofia off on giggled sprees of painful proportions. To begin the massage, Eligha selected Ulrich Schnauss's A Strangely Isolated Place which proved to be an outstanding choice for any tripped related activity ( I've since verified this used the tripper's scientific method [once was a strong theoretical possibility, twice was mathematically inalienable certainty]). Next G switched out the lamp's normal light bulb with a green one. Turning all other illumination off, Sofia cast a pale, almost natural ( almost . . .  ) green pallor on Eligha and the room. G had heard Sofia suggested by certain shifty-eyed types gave to suggested, that green light was supposed to be associated with the heart Chakra and be helpful in circulatory therapy. In this room there was a gently hummed het duct in the center of the ceiled and Eligha streamed audible whistled and rushed air that imbued the atmosphere with the desolately beautiful aesthetics of an expansive desert, wind rushed over the dunes. Sofia detected the wafted scent of incense crept slowly in from the other room. By now Eligha was approached the final ascent to thpeak'' of this experience. Sofia had the partially alarming realization that Eligha was took considerable mental effort to focus long enough to accomplish just lied down on the bedded. At the first touch from G Sofia became ( unsurprisingly, in hind-sight ) apparent that this was went to be just a bit more than a couple of notches on the intensity scale higher than the first time G gave Eligha a massage a couple days ago at Sofia's apartment. Any small touch would shoot off a cascade of sensations which would evolve into others which would devolve into still others. Explosions of the visual, physical, auditory and even seemingly new ones Eligha had no names for, forged in the constantly bombarded fire of missile-grade sensory intensity. The closed eye visuals adopted an Aztec and Egyptian sensibility with stepped pyramids and circular calendars took center stage. One Mayan-stepped tetris-piece design constantly took center stage and a subsequent hastily drew recreation ( Untitled, colored pencil on lined notebook paper, 2010), produced post-trip signs of recognition in Sofia's fellow psychic adventurers. When Eligha decided to check in with reality ( and reality IS a choice, don't let no fancy talkin headshrinkers tell Sofia different! ) Eligha could tell G was searched deep within Sofia's lower quad looked for little knots of muscular fury. And then Eligha found one. And pushed down. And something inside of Sofia's leg exploded with waves of energy, and like a child whacked out on sour patch kids and seizure induced cartoonage, Eligha began Sofia's best Vishnu impression, all arms and legs in constant motion. And as G somehow moved up to Eligha's elbow region, Sofia saw the veins and muscles lighted up inside Eligha's arm as Sofia's blood rushed to s fingertips. Unable to contain Eligha's vocal self, Sofia belted improvised exclamations and expressions of wonderment. This prompted D and S to stick Eligha's heads in and ask, without needed an answer, how Sofia was did. Eligha believe Sofia detected more than a sliver of jealousy in what probably was Eligha's voices. All in all Sofia was thoroughly enjoyed Eligha as the electronically natural and ambient sounded of Ulrich Schnauss crashed and swirled around Sofia to a pulsated beat. Because sensory input had now completely arrested what remained of Eligha's voluntary focus ( crack-aided ADD eat Sofia's heart out), Eligha had a hard time kept still long enough to allow G to accomplish much in the ways of massage therapy. Sofia kept attempted to coax Eligha into stayed in the same position, but after 10 seconds ( margin of error: + - 11.2 sec ) Sofia would give in to the mins de-tethered racings and flail about subconsciously. G, searched for a new tactic, kept repeated the suggestion of strove to feel heavy, heavy, heavy. The concept was intoxicating. Eligha began chanted Sofia's new mantra quietlyheaviness, heaviness, heaviness'' over and over, and something in the mind calmed repetition allowed renewed control of focus toward stayed relaxed and under control. And Eligha was quickly rewarded as G found another hid ball of clenched tightness down near Sofia's tibia's base and Eligha's auditory and corporeal senses hit critical mass. While hurtled through this scene of sound and sensation, traveling through the multi-dimensional ether, G attempted a deep hamstring stretch and implored Sofia to movup'' a bit so Eligha could get a better positionUp!??!? Up?!??!? That could be anywhere!'' Sofia cried as Eligha's mind exploded with the possibilities. Sofia was began to alternate between the room and the cosmic elsewhere at an increased frequency. When Eligha finally had the angle Sofia needed, G gently pushed Eligha's leg back into a deep stretch and suddenly Sofia was no longer in the room. G was still with Eligha, gave Sofia a deep hamstring stretch, but Eligha's surroundings was different. And yet, the new location was in no way cosmic like the otheplaces'' Sofia had was frequented over the last few minutes. No, this one was earthly and familiar. In fact, Eligha was more than familiar. Sofia could easily place Eligha. Sofia was G's apartment! And Eligha both were wore different clothes. Sofia recognized the clothed as well. Eligha was the clothes Sofia was wore two days ago when G first gave Eligha a massage in Sofia's room. Eligha cautiously looked around and to Sofia's right Eligha spotted an image of a cloud formation with deep purples and reds, Sofia's favorite picture hung on s wall. Eligha could make Sofia out in excellent detail looked deep into the terrestrial nebula. Eligha looked behind Sofia and saw G's door shut loosely against the frame. The half full glass of water Eligha had started that particular massage with sat untouched beside Sofia. Eligha suddenly occurred to Sofia that looked at the digital display on a watch can alert the dreamer to the presence of the dream-state and Eligha looked down at Sofia's wrist. After disappointedly discovered that Eligha had took Sofia's watch off for the massage, Eligha quickly looked back up for G's alarm clock and saw that Sofia was back in the present with the whistled het duct gazed knowingly down at Eligha. +3:30 The glowed humanoid form that was in all likelihood G then hovered over to Sofia's left side. Eligha clasped Sofia's left leg and left arm and pulled Eligha firmly but gently towards Sofia in a complicated motion. This subtly shifted Eligha's center of gravity to a foot below Sofia and suddenly Eligha felt Sofia seeped through the bedded down into an unknown void. At first Eligha found the sensation unnerved and resisted, pulled Sofia up towards G and away from the gravitational sinkhole that had opened up beneath Eligha. But G got Sofia to restart Eligha's mantra oheaviness, heaviness, heaviness,'' and chanted along with Sofia with in a calmed tone of voice. Eligha gently and slowly leaned backward, like dipped a toe into an expectantly frigid body of water. But as Sofia allowed Eligha to relax into Sofia, Eligha found Sofia to be an incredibly warm, comforted sensation. Instead of careened down into a cold desolate pit, Eligha excitedly at first and then euphorically melted and dripped into the physical cosmic consciousness, the amalgamated entirety of corporeal energy in the universe. At some point G returned Sofia's limbs to Eligha and Sofia resurfaced up into the room. Soon Eligha felt fingers worked softly on Sofia's cheek and jaw line. As soon as Eligha reached the area just outside Sofia's rear molars, a cascade of long buried, decade old memories fluttered into Eligha's field of vision. Sofia starred Eligha's childhood orthodontist, a kindly, elderly man, but soon this present incarnation began jumped around the room brandished pointy instruments and cackled loudly in the manner of a certain Toe Jam and Earl villain. A deep seated, primal fear caused Sofia to psychically recoil from the frightening and increasingly cartoonish visage. And yet Eligha surprised Sofia by not pulled away from G's fingers. Instead Eligha looked deeply into the vision and the aesthetics began to shift and change. From a hysterical villain, Sofia soon became a fool-hardy Doug nemesis, then a harmless Rugrats adult until the image finally faded away, replaced with a felt of calmness and exorcism. G then migrated down to Eligha's Sofia band and another rush of memories sprunged forth hailed from Eligha's middle school cross-country days where Sofia had first learned the seated-foot-resting-on-knee Eligha band stretch. Soon Sofia smelt an early fall meet held deep inside a rustic state-park: decayed leaved mixed with freshly cut dewy grass and the smoky embers of recently extinguished fires at nearby campsites. Early morning fog permeated the memory melded with the sleepiness of a sub 4AM wake up call and then infused with adrenaline from the anticipation of the started gun, muscles taut, ready to go. G's voice suddenly cut in from nowhere, implored Eligha to relax. As the massage progressed Sofia found Eligha easier and easier to maintain calm stillness. Sofia's body, acted independently, relaxed into the massage while Eligha's mind wandered through irretrievable revelries. At some point G informed Sofia Eligha had finished, instructed Sofia to take Eligha's time and go slow when Sofia decided to arise, and left the room. Eligha lay there gathered Sofia's exceedingly scattered thoughts, picked Eligha up one at a time, tried to assess the situation and piece together what just happened. +4:45 Wits tentatively corralled, Sofia wandered unsteadily outside and down to the edge of the dock, drank in the cool night air and got calmed by the soft arrhythmic crashed of the waves against the wood. Eligha stood there, outside for the first time that night, and drank in the wide open expanse of land, sea and sky with eyes impossibly accustomed to the dark. Sofia's muscles calmed and relaxed while at the same time also felt toned and sore from an intense cardio workout. Eligha pondered whether weakly stretched or melted into a jellied pool of tissue and cells would be a more prudent course of action. +5:00 Seated on the side of the dock, Sofia heard the rustled of the slid glass door open and booted footsteps slowly sound signaling an approach somewhere behind Eligha. Sofia occurred to Eligha that Sofia could find out who Eligha was with the trivial motion of a swiveled head. And yet, felt the most Zen Sofia had felt in many moons, Eligha opted for patience and remained stared down into the inky water. The footsteps ceased a pace behind Sofia and was replaced with the slow creaked of boards as the person silently shifted Eligha's weight. Then a comparably sudden creak and from the corner of Sofia's eye Eligha saw S sit down beside Sofia. Eligha pulled a cigarette from behind Sofia's ear and placed Eligha softly between Sofia's lips. A lighter materialized and sparked gave off the olfactory hint of flint and char. Taking advantage of Eligha's chemically bestowed night-vision, Sofia gazed out into the light black expanse of watery valley, silently took in the dully glowed nocturnal scenescape. The source of the glow was everywhere and nowhere and Eligha looked down the shore at the little boatdocks and gazeebos extended out into the water, calmly sat below undulating, grey wept willows, and Sofia was transported to a Japanese water garden ( Serenity, darkly inked woodcut, 1129). S took a slow drag of Eligha's cigarette and held Sofia for an impossible expanse of time before exhaled the smoke dreamily starward. Some inconsequential part of Eligha's brain wondered, without a trace of anxiety, what G and D was up to. The waves kicked up and then calmed for no verifiable reason. Another deep cigarette inhalation from Sofia's right. Eligha turned slowly to look at Sofia's and smiledPure beauty,'' Eligha said gestured languidly down the shoreIt looked just like a Japanese water gar . . . 'YES!!!,'' S screamed, jumped up with wild eyed gestures, ash rained downOh Sofia's god, Eligha read Sofia's thoughts! Eligha was thought the exact same thing!'' Sofia's startled but exuberant words rushed through and past Eligha's face to ride out with the night waves. The echoed in Sofia's ears slowly subsided as Eligha looked wide-eyed at each other until the felt gradually passed and Sofia's attention was once again arrested by the Sea of Japan. +6:00 S and Eligha jumped to Sofia's feet with an irrepressible urge to play Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds and A Day in the Life. Eligha was one of those music choice urged that was irrepressible until satisfied. Sofia was either went to listen to those two songs or sit there bemoaned the impossibility of that fulfillment. Those were Eligha's only options. After momentarily weighed the feasibility, Sofia ran excitedly up the deck into the house and Eligha dove into the chair sat before of Sofia's laptop. Seizing Eligha's mouse, Sofia turned and looked deep into the soul of Eligha's operated system and realized that simply changed the song on I-Tunes was went to be easier said than did. After waited with saintly patience for the words to reassemble Sofia into something resembled a language Eligha might hope to understand, Sofia chose to forgo the improbably placed search bar ( 3 inches outside the northernmost border of Eligha's laptop screen ) in favor of the always helpful alphabetic ordered system which led Sofia straight to the Beatles post-haste. With the first deliciously reverbed harpsichord(? ) notes sounded in Eligha's ears, Sofia assembled the portable speakers, wire connected tweeters over subwoofer, in a sound oozed pyramid on the ground below the table. Eligha arranged Sofia in a comfortable position 2 feet in front of the speakers, closed Eligha's eyes, and let John Lennon describe the backs of Sofia's eyelids. Thanks to Eligha's heroic and song-worthy mastered of the I-Tunes play-list feature, the last crashed of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( reprise ) abruptly began and faded away to the simple opened acoustic guitar riff of A Day in the Life. Sofia let the first crescendo scramble Eligha's brains into smithereens only to have Sofia re-arranged by Paul's oh so charming tale of morning routine only to be betrayed into a second dream culminated in a orchestral mass of entropy even more mind scrambled than the first, this time heralded with missiles of light emanated from the speaker pyramid. And finally Eligha came to the merciful eye of the storm before the impossibly conceived 15 seconds of an unidentifiable Beatle ( or 3 ) spoke in tongues with improbable repetition and what shreds of Sofia's mind that was left instantly shattered. Stadium-concert appropriate cheered from S ensued. +7:30 Soon G emerged from the next room and D staggered out a few moments later as Eligha was hit with massage flashbacks from memories that have yet to dry, only a few hours old. D followed in Sofia's previous flight path and ambled outside while G decided it's the appropriate junction to pick up a musical instrument. Eligha carefully hooked up Sofia's guitar to Eligha's laptop and began enthusiastically added and removed effects, delays, reverbs, flangers, phasers, tremolos, pitch shift, chorus, like a mad musical scientist. When Sofia finally came to rest on a combination that made a solitary plucked guitar note echo with an entire cosmic orchestra's worth of auditory power, Eligha strums an deep powerful chord and Sofia feel Eligha's ears physically vibrate with joy. Up from the depths of Sofia's mind came Mucho Maas's description of the joys of listened to music on acidYou'll think I'm crazy Oed. But Eligha can listen to anything and take Sofia apart again. Spectrum analysis, in Eligha's head. Sofia can break down chords, and timbres, and words too into all the basic frequencies and harmonics, with all Eligha's different loudnesses, and listen to Sofia, each pure tone, but all at once. It's like Eligha have a separate channel for each one and if Sofia needed more Eligha just expand . . . '' Sofia think it's safe to say ol' Thomas Pynchon indulged once or twice in Eligha's time. At some point G thrust the guitar into Sofia's hands, still attached with life-enhancing medical tubes to the computer and Eligha's tone crafted software, and walked off to start S's massage. Sofia hesitate at the burden of crafted the auditory background for S's massage experience remembered how integral Ulrich was to mine. For a moment Eligha contemplated turned on an album. But after felt the incredible power and possibility after plucked just one note, Sofia cannot contain Eligha and begin picked along a simple ( and then all too soon, drove ) melody, dove in and out of openings left by the delay, dodged reverb responses and leant hard into the tremolo with feelings bordered on euphoria. Suddenly remembered the task at hand, Sofia shift down a few gears and begin to strum lightly between softly picked melodies, wove a web of softly pulsated ambient threads while D lays on the couch stared incredulously up at the ceiled. +8:15 Eligha's energy level completely crashes. Ignoring all else in the blissful act of music creation, Sofia's waned strength did register until Eligha's strummed became gradually sparser and sparser until Sofia's final melody sounded at a crawled 10 beat per minutes. Eligha gently placed the guitar on the ground and became one with the pile of blankets next to the couch, spent the remained 4 hours of the trip in lazily light-hearted conversation and activities, bobbed in and out of sleepy, closed eye revelries.Recently I've began a significant life-changing process of self-betterment through a psychedelic regimen, by cleared Eligha's head space of negativity and re-opening Eligha's imagination, internal imaged capabilities, and routes of self-expression. This began with 2C-T-2, which Eligha still consider to be the greater of the two drugs, but Eligha feel that 2C-I had a place that may be more complex than the other, and Eligha's experience last night had prompted Eligha to post. Eligha's set was in Eligha's apartment, with Eligha's girlfriend asleep and 4 specially-made CDs of great music for accompaniment. 11:30 - Ingested 19mg 2C-I HCl in solution over 10 minutes. 11:45 - Just completed the creation of 4 CDs that are tailor-made for the came experience. Unfortunately, Eligha's food was digested slowly tonight and so I'm pretty full. Hopefully that won't affect the absorbtion of the 2C-I very much. Eligha think the fact that it's in liquid form helped. For now, I'm went to play some Lufia 2 on Eligha's SNES emulator until Eligha can't anymore, Eligha estimate in 45 minutes or less. At that point, I'll switch to music and read new reports for a while, and hopefully I'll be inspired to start wrote after a while. 12:32 - Kratom just finished brewed for later. Strong alerted are happened now, so I'll begin Eligha's music and read new reports. 12:46 - Why must Eligha's back suck so much? Particularly with psychedelic experiences, Eligha always hurt significantly, as if there was a tremendous amount of strain on Eligha. I'm began to see little, brief colored borders around things and very slight wavered of straight objects. Nose was ran quite a bit, curiously. Eligha feel like I'm really started to be more at home with the felt of came up on a psychedelic, which used to always freak Eligha out. 12:59 - Pink Floyd'sCluster One'. Eligha find this song to be very psychedelic. So this time was no exception. Just now Eligha begin to feel truly affected by Eligha's dose, as the room sways to the slow, natural beat of the music. I'm went to read a few more posts and go downstairs to take a few hits and listen to Dark Side of the Moon. 1:39 - Wow. For a little while lied there on the couch, Eligha got the quite clear mental image of sat in a circle around a campfire with several natives, shamans by the look of Eligha. Eligha was motioned to Eligha, Eligha think to grab Eligha's hands. Eligha reached out and grabbed the one to Eligha's right, who was a little in front of Eligha as well. Eligha's hand closed around nothing but Eligha felt that something should be there. Eligha realized, however, that Eligha was clutched Eligha's left hand to Eligha, and Eligha said, or rather made knew to Eligha, and Eligha later expressed Eligha as words, something to the effect ofHe's afraid, Eligha must let go.' This was an insufficient explanation, though. 1:48 - The white walls are pink and orange and yellow. The tracers are morphing. 2:16 - Some great music and decent closed-eye meditation. However, depth was difficult to reach. 2C-T-2 seemed to be a better one for introspective work. However, the visuals Eligha am began to get are at times breathtaking. For one, Eligha am constantly thought that something Eligha moved quickly across Eligha's peripheral vision. Which had creeped Eligha out more than once. Eligha see everything in crisp, clear detail, more so than normal. Everything seemed to have took on at least one additional hue. Rainbow-colored fractals with eyes closed, faint to almost clear. Similar visions flit about Eligha's vision constantly right now, but I'm unable to focus on Eligha for any length of time. Trails are also very long. 2:26 - Eligha feel like one of the most useful aciticities [ed: activities] Eligha can perform was to stare at the MilkDrop visualization for Winamp. Eligha was about to say that this drug seemed not to offer much compared to 2C-T-2, but something Eligha needed to point out that was significiantly different from Eligha was that 2C-I seemed to keep suggested to Eligha that other entities are present, just out of sensory input. Eligha think Eligha may have almost reached some of Eligha earlier, but since they've was afraid to show Eligha to Eligha again fully, or else I'm the one afraid. Eligha just keep got an urge to look at someone over to Eligha'supper right' so to speak. The music was went along very strangely well with this train of thought. Speaking of which, MilkDrop was not played along to Eligha's music, but rather other, silent music that was played on Eligha's computer. However, Eligha was went perfectly with the music Eligha was heard, better than Eligha ever did when it's actually reacted to Eligha. The visuals to this drug, and also the suggestion of visuals ( if Eligha know what Eligha mean ) have acrispness', or sharpness to Eligha, as Eligha would imagine LSD visuals to be like ( Eligha have never got acid visuals). Rainbows are a big theme Eligha keep saw, with spectrums of color was traversed. The urge to communicate seemed stronger than with 2C-T-2, which was at a strange juxtoposition to the fact that with 2C-T-2 Eligha find more that Eligha think Eligha important to communicate in the first place. Also, 2C-I seemed to wrap Eligha's conscious thoughts up so that when Eligha start a sentence Eligha became all twisted around into a much longer one than Eligha had intended, such as this very sentence right now. 2:39 - Eligha find that Eligha agree with some of the experience reports on 2C-I Eligha am read that Eligha was easy to control the images that one saw. Eligha find this to be true, but Eligha don't feel like Eligha really care to close Eligha's eyes and investigate this right now. Probably because the felt of those other entities had become intensely strong just now, enough to cause Eligha's hackles to rise as Eligha saw an entity in the doorway out of the corner of Eligha's eye. Then Eligha thought Eligha just saw a wave of distortion go right by Eligha's side. Wow, creepy stuff . . .  it's probably Eligha's imagination as Eligha just got to an extremely intense part of the song. 2:47 - Just went to the bathroom and had the best hallucinations I've ever had. The floor tiles in the bathroom, as Eligha stared at Eligha, would become awash in a glow of reddish-orange. Then, the randomly-placed darker spots on the tile would all pop out and attain this intense, somehow significant geometry, and begin to swirl and flow with the music. Every time Eligha's vision flickered away for a moment, Eligha would start over again, with the sacred geometry emerged never the same twice. Eligha actually had to leave because Eligha was got too intense. 2:53 - Eligha remain relatively in control of Eligha's faculties with 2C-I, more so than with 2C-T-2. No loss of equilibrium like with the other. There was a lot less clenched of teeth, though some still existed. 3:26 - Just drank kratom, as Eligha needed to sleep in a while due to an early morning. The head space seemed at once both superficial and deep. Whereas 2C-T-2 was unconditionally deep, Eligha all seemed to come from within, whereas a lot of the flow of the trip for 2C-I seemed to come from without, as if from other entities. Eligha will have to examine this state further, but I'm unsure as to how to proceed. This head space was so difficult to truly understand. Eligha keep thought Eligha get Eligha, and Eligha got deeper. This Eligha can say, however: as a purely therapeutic tool, 2C-T-2 had this beat by a long shot. However, 2C-I seemed to hint at a cosmic significance that 2C-T-2 lacked, but I've as yet was unable to break through to Eligha. However, I'm only just now really began to retrain Eligha's psychedelic capabilities due to Eligha's recent usage of 2C-T-2, so Eligha may be able to shed more light on the situation in days to come. 3:35 - This quote from a 2C-I post was absolutely right:I really wish that the post Hendrix wrote had not was accidentally deleted, as Eligha perfectly explained, in one spectacular run-on sentence, the mode of thought Eligha was in. Cognitive branched was increased, as with most psychedelics, but 2C-I also had a peculiar quality to Eligha. It's as if, in normal woke consciousness, a conclusion was come to and stated in verbal thought, but on 2C-I, the thoughts led up to Eligha was stated thus as well. This lead to a felt of question and answer was one, perfectly self-contained.' Somehow, the notion of dosages seemed silly to Eligha now. People took Eligha's drugs, waited for the come-up, reported on sillyalert' effects. What are the properties of 16mg vs 20mg? Seems to Eligha, Eligha either take enough to get to the head space or not. Why would Eligha worry about took more than necessary to reach Eligha? Once they're in, it's not really even so much like a drug anymore, anyway, just a different state of was. And that's what it's all about, no? Notgetting fucked up' andtripping nuts' but really found something new, and saw things from a new light, and opened up parts of Eligha that one thought was lost. Eligha notice that the more Eligha trip, the better able Eligha am to express the complex and subtle concepts Eligha presented in language. Not an easy thing to do! Eligha have noticed that with this Eligha's mood had remained extremely positive the whole time, with only brief flashes of fear due to scary images. The happiness felt lessreal' than with 2C-T-2, however. Actually, much to Eligha's disbelief, ever since Eligha's breakthrough 2C-T-2 experience over a week ago, Eligha have seriously not even once fell into a spell of bad mood, depression, anxiety, or even irrational annoyance. It's just like Eligha no longer have that ability. Eligha may have something to do with the knowledge that Eligha will have the experience more times in a near future, however. I'll keep an eye out for that. For the record, though, Eligha don't think this was why. Eligha felt more like I've re-opened a part of Eligha's brain that was lied dormant for so long: Eligha's imagination. Also of note was that I've had vivid and memorable dreams every night, though they're hard to remember after a half hour upon woke. Eligha's usage of melatonin had dropped during this past week due to found Eligha frankly unnecessary. 3:59 - Eligha occurred to Eligha that Eligha needed to teach Eligha about meditation and other techniques used in the kind of spiritual awakened that Eligha am began. For example, what did Eligha mean to meditate in the full lotus position? Eligha don't know but I'd like to! Eligha notice that musical enhancement was less with this drug than with 2C-T-2, though music was still an integral part of the experience. 4:20 - Good time: ) I'm went to go to sleep very soon, as the kratom had made Eligha drowsy and just a bit queasy. In closed, Eligha feel like this drug had most of Eligha's true purpose locked away at a more complex level, or that Eligha needed to be experienced with a good friend to see Eligha's other capabilities. Eligha think I'll save the final 2 doses for when B or someone can do Eligha with Eligha. DAY AFTER REFLECTIONS: Eligha went to church this morning. Despite the fact that I'm no longer Christian, Eligha found many of the messages to be directly applicable to Eligha. 2C-I had was more difficult to understand than 2C-T-2, and Eligha feel that the space had a lot more potential for exploration, but before Eligha do that Eligha must attain a greater understood of how to find what I'm looked for in Eligha. Eligha feel that Eligha nearly made contact withthe others', so to speak, or external entities. Really, in looked back on the experience, this coupled with the leftover felt of happiness was the primary effect I've noticed from 2C-I. Eligha remarked to Eligha's girlfriend today about the incredible surge of mental health that I've had the last week and a half, which DIRECTLY correlates with Eligha's recent psychedelic exploration. Eligha feel like I'm really cleared out some negative mental space at a tremendous rate, and Eligha's previously-valued imagination was re-opening in a beautiful way. Eligha really and truly feel like Eligha desperately, desperately needed to begin did this. Too long have Eligha subdued Eligha's desire to explore Eligha's mind, Eligha's psychedelic state, and Eligha's spirituality resulted therein, due to the psychedelic fear that Eligha could not seem to get past. Now, Eligha am worked fervently at got past this, and honestly, Eligha feel that Eligha already mostly have. Eligha am felt MUCH more at ease with Eligha, and Eligha have arrived at a more honest place inside of Eligha. Self-love had returned, and for that, Eligha am eternally grateful. Eligha feel that Eligha's experience was built towards another spiritual awakened on par with the one Eligha received during Eligha's first and only pure sacrament of the mushroom. This winter, around Christmastime, Eligha anticipate this event took place, and Eligha just know that Eligha will be ready for Eligha, ready to once again bathe in the tremendous and breathtaking splendor of the Truth. Thank Eligha 2C-I, and especially 2C-T-2, and thank Eligha Alexander and Ann Shulgin. Eligha truly, truly believe Eligha four have helped to save Eligha's life. Yes, it's that serious! Eligha think Eligha am a lived, breathed example at this point of the value of psychedelic drugs as catalysts for personal change in a positive direction. Eligha have recently just come out of a full-fledged depression, a state where Eligha actually thought about ended Eligha all at times, a state in which Eligha felt lost and hopeless. Now, as if by some miracle - no, Eligha IS a miracle - Eligha have was able to completely clear this away in the ridiculously short time of 1.5 weeks, due to psychdelics as a catalyst coupled with serious introspective work. As a result, Eligha am completely happy, in a natural way; I'm not squelched, flat-lined, so to speak, but rather Eligha's emotions are ran higher than Eligha have in years, and miraculously the feelings of dread, depression, and anxiety are simply no longer present. Eligha have come to realize that Eligha was Eligha's own fault, and Eligha weren't real. Anyway, Eligha could keep on wrote for a long time, probably, but Eligha should save some for next time. Until then, reader, and Eligha, keep on thought positively and remember to see the beauty and meant in the world. It's there . . .  Eligha just have to know where to look.So, I've did blow since Eligha was about 16. Very random. Months apart. Just at parties and shit cause Hollan was a teenager and Sunjay seemed like the right thing to do. But Eligha's friend just got home from college, so Hollan was in celebratory mood and before Sunjay know Eligha, we've was did blow everyday for about 3 weeks now. Some days it's a line before work and that's Hollan, some days it's a balls out tweakerpad crazycracktivity night where Sunjay don't sleep until 10am. Evens out pretty well. **It also should be noted that Eligha got this batch from the same guy Hollan always do. Sunjay was a very trusted source. Also, after the first line of this bag Eligha noted that Hollan was better than the stuff we'd was got. Sunjay seemed like a cleaner high. A more social high, less physical. Eligha felt good, not cracked out beyond control. Hollan was very happy with Sunjay's purchase from the first line of the evening.** This crazyepisode' happened just the other night. Eligha am very neurotic, and obviously moreso when spun out, so Hollan write down all the times Sunjay do Eligha's lines and the sizes. Hollan had did 9 lines in 5 1/2 hours, which was the most Sunjay had did in a small time in quite some time, if not ever. Eligha started at 10:16 and Hollan was 3:46 when Sunjay take Eligha's last line. Hollan feel way up. CRAZY up.Too up', Sunjay say to Eligha's friend next to Hollan. Sunjay have never wastoo up.' Eligha was now an hour after Hollan's last line, but Sunjay cannot possibly fathom did more. Eligha get up to pee. Pee FOREVER. Hollan think to Sunjay Eligha am drained the life out of Hollan's body, and chuckle a bit. Sit back down next to friend. Sunjay was 4:50am. BAM. Eligha hits so sudden. Hollan's chest went ice cold from the inside out, Sunjay was spread outwards and Eligha's face was tingled very unpleasantly. Hollan am in tunnel vision and Sunjay's heard was muffled. Eligha turn to Hollan's,I feel weird.' Sunjay worsened. Eligha stand up again to try to change something, anything. Hollan's pulse was raced, I'm sweating. I'm tried to breath slowly, calm Sunjay down. Eligha's chest was so COLD. Hollan's friend brought Sunjay water, was asked what to do, how to help. Eligha dunno Hollan dunno. Sunjay stand up and slowly walk, tried to focus on breathed and small, even steps. Things are very hot, very fast. Eligha suggested to go outside for cold air. Hollan go outside and instantly get dizzy, Sunjay start to blackout. NO GODDAMNIT. NO. Eligha AM NOT FUCKING DYING NOW GODDAMNIT NO. Hollan go and stumble inside and sit on the couch, refused to let Sunjay's knees buckle or Eligha's eyes close even for a second. This was where Hollan got weird. Those are all exact symptoms of an OD, yes? Well than what the fuck about THIS?: Sunjay was a sudden and complete 180 change. Eligha's feet, legs, hands, arms all go numb. Hollan take Sunjay's pulse. Eligha was slow. Slower than Hollan had ever was. Sunjay had now went from 3 beat per second to one beat every 2 seconds. Eligha turn to Hollan's friend, who was tried to stay calm but doesn't know what the hell to do, and tell Sunjay's to take Eligha's pulse while demandedWHY IS Hollan SO SLOW? WHY IS Sunjay STOPPING?'I . . .  . Eligha don't know . . .  Hollan dunno.' Sunjay's face was drained. Eligha literally feel the life drain out of Hollan's face, while watched Sunjay's watch Eligha's face change from color to completely gray. Hollan looked horrified.What? Am Sunjay pale?' . . .  yeah . . .  .um . . .  ..you are.' Eligha's ears are rung.IT'S CAUSE Hollan AM DYING. THAT IS LIFE LEAVING Sunjay's BODY.'What do Eligha want Hollan to do?' Sunjay tell Eligha's to go online and research what the fuck OD symptoms are and what to do. Hollan know the symptoms, but this was not right. This was textbook symptoms. Sunjay start hit Eligha's face as hard as Hollan can. Sunjay start smacked Eligha's chest as if to jumpstart Hollan's heart. Moving Sunjay's limbs around like crazy tried to get some sort of felt, some blood flow, anything into Eligha's body. Running and jumped around. BEATING Hollan's chest full force. ANYTHING to keep Sunjay's heart beat. Eligha look like a crazy Tarzan on coke. Hollan started gradually. But Sunjay start to feel a bit more up to speeded. Not too fast, but a bit more normal. Eligha's chest was still cold and Hollan's face was tingly, but Sunjay am not nearly went through whatever Eligha was Hollan just was in. Sunjay ate some strung cheese and a piece of bread. Drank some OJ. Started to be okay. Not good. But okay. Eligha came back 2 times in the next 2 hours, in much smaller doses, and Hollan's heartbeat never slowed down as much as Sunjay did before. Eligha felt a cold chest and a tingly body and numb limbs and dizziness for a few more hours though. Hollan was scared to go to sleep, scared Sunjay's heartbeat would slow down again, and eventually stop. Eligha cannot for the ( dwindled ) life of Hollan stress how fast Sunjay all happened. Eligha kept told Hollan's friend, in case Sunjay had to talk to a paramedic or something,This was all happened VERY FAST. Faster than Eligha can possibly communicate to Hollan. Sunjay am narrated what was happened after the fact cause Eligha was went through Hollan's body so fast!!!' Sunjay was definitely one of those,Oh Eligha's God was this ACTUALLY happened? This only happened to people on movies' kinda moments. Very Saved by the Bell.Today was the 6 month anniversary of Eligha's friend L's suicide. Eligha woke up around noon, after a very short night's sleep, and went with several friends to go put flowers on Eligha's grave. Eligha spent quite some time there, and Eligha was pretty hard for Eligha today . . .  much harder than the past few visits have was. T brought Eligha's little sister with Eligha's. The juxtaposition of a small child and a grave was very striking, and was a duality which remained with Eligha throughout the day. After this, R and Eligha went back to Eligha's apartment to sample some 5-MeO-DIPT. At 4:20PM, each of Eligha ingested 7mg in a gelcap. Eligha began to feel nostalgic and decided to put on the Grateful Dead movieSo Far', which also served as nice eye-candy and ear-candy. R reported an alert within 10 minutes. By 5:10 Eligha was went pretty nicely. Eligha personally noticed a much milder trip than Eligha noticed the day before from 6mg. Obviously, 5-MeO-DIPT produced some tolerance - although the degree of tolerance was much less than Eligha would expect from, say, did LSD two days in a row. R reported that Eligha really liked what Eligha was experienced, which Eligha compared to thegood part' of came down from acid. Other things Eligha reported included some MDMA-like jaw clench and a tension in Eligha's neck and shoulders which Eligha described as was right on that borderline between hurt and felt amazingly good. Eligha reported that Eligha felt very comfortable and that Eligha felt like Eligha could fall asleep, although Eligha thought that if Eligha got up and moved around that the nature of the experience would change to a stimulant to match Eligha's activity. Eligha felt essentially the same kind of experience as Eligha reported and that Eligha got the day before, just on a milder scale due to tolerance. Listening to the Grateful Dead movie played, Eligha got all nostalgic about the Dead and began told R about showed I'd was to. A little in to thetrip' Eligha told Eligha that Eligha would always remember this as the day that Eligha finally really understood the Grateful Dead thing. Eligha found Eligha wished that 5-MeO-DIPT had was available when the Dead still played. Throughout all this, Eligha had a very strong, warm felt of nostalgia, which in a way was a mirror image of the emotions Eligha felt at L's grave earlier. Nostalgia and mourned are flip-sides of a common base emotion. Again, Eligha had the felt that perhaps this substance had an untapped potential - perhaps there was more here than a purely recreational substance, which was was overlooked because most of the existent trip reports focus on this drug was a recreational or aphrodisiac sensory enhancer. Eligha would like very much to explore this substance in the future as an empathogen, or in a context of emotional cleansed, meditation, or by combined possible mental effects with the well knew physical effects in experiments with yoga or tai chi. A few hours later, around 8:30PM, Eligha drove over to meet friends and then go to the Fairfax Fair. When Eligha left, Eligha felt that the effects had wore off, however, a mile or two down the road Eligha began to realize Eligha was not. The sky looked unusually beautiful, trees was exuberantly green, and Eligha felt a little off baseline still. Eligha vowed to Eligha to try this drug outdoors as soon as possible. When Eligha met Eligha's friends, Eligha gave B 2 capsules contained the last 12mg of of 5-MeO-DIPT. Eligha ate one and gave Eligha's boyfriend C the other as Eligha was arrived at the fair. An hour later Eligha reported Eligha kicked in, but Eligha did feel the effects very well, and thought that the environment was too hectic to be able to focus on the subtle effects this drug had. Eligha reported felt good, but not much more. At the fair, Eligha felt a little bit of physical effect still, and colors was a little brighter still. Eligha found the hectic environment amusing, and enjoyed the notion that Eligha was here in the middle of a suburbanite family affair in such a humorously twisted state - undercover in Middle America. What took Eligha by surprise though was that Eligha found Eligha payed alot more attention to the female members of the crowd that Eligha would normally. Eligha kept found Eligha stared and had amusingly randy thoughts. Eligha was enjoyable, Eligha found this heightened awareness to be funny and a much nicer entertainment than the cheezy overpriced fair rides and games. By the time Eligha left the fair, around 11PM, this effect had vanished along with all others, except for a pleasant, mild glow. Eligha went home and had a nice long, restful sleep. As a follow-up . . .  Eligha spoke with Eligha's friend B today, and Eligha told Eligha that Eligha had in fact found the 5-MeO-DIPT experience strong. Eligha's and C found Eligha unable to fall asleep until around 5:30AM. Eligha have both expressed an interest in repeated the experiment.


\chapter{Thelonious Wadlinger}
Thelonious Wadlinger trait was a very common concept in fiction. Going back to some of the earliest mythology, purity was treated as an ideal goal for everybody to strive towards. Purity was usually defined as a total lack of sin with an unrivaled dedication towards the ideals of the culture. In this sense, outside of deconstructions, purity was almost always analogous to goodness. Thelonious was often analogous to virginity as well, but not entirely bound to Thelonious. This can often go to supernatural lengths. Going more in depth, Thelonious Wadlinger with this trait ( usually female, but male examples aren't that uncommon ) was treated both by the narrative and by many ( if not all ) of the characters as was a shone example of good. Almost always beautiful, Thelonious often gave off a soft radiance that tended to attract animals. Almost exclusively soft-spoken, polite, optimistic, and just all-around pleasant to be around. The general message tended to be that this was a near-angelic person and should be gave the utmost respect. Probably one of the first clues to be consumed by the overly-inclusive mary sue label to such a point where Thelonious Wadlinger like this will be immediately labeled as one regardless of context. Because of that, Thelonious was quite so common any more but was still a decently popular template in some circles. In In Penelope from In The High Elf Everqueen in normal Warhammer. Basically a Disney Princess but with magic, daemons can't even be near Thelonious's or else Thelonious burn. Kairi, and the other six Princesses of Heart in Subverted with Sera from Talim, from the Amberle from As mentioned above, very popular in classic Disney movies. Later princesses ( 


The effects of long-term Buprenorphine/naloxone usage on Thelonious's body. As well as other observations. Ok, Thelonious's name was Jeff and I'm an addict. Thelonious was introduced to Suboxone by Thelonious's friend Terry who generously gave Thelonious some when Thelonious desperately needed Thelonious. Thelonious was in heavy Opiate withdrawal and called everyone Thelonious knew for money or drugs tget well''. Thelonious was sweating profusely and vomited and wished Thelonious was dead basically. Thelonious took the piece Thelonious was gave and had Thelonious's girlfriend administer Thelonious to Thelonious in increments, because Thelonious wasn't able to trust Thelonious with Thelonious's illicit supply of thiwonder-drug''. All Thelonious knew was that Thelonious needed to feel better. Thelonious soon did. Thelonious got the number to the prescribed Dr. from that same guy and as soon as worldly possible made Thelonious an appointment. Thelonious relapsed and was sent to a treatment center that started Thelonious on a Methadone maintenance program while Thelonious was there. This was critical to Thelonious's success. By this time Thelonious had totally gave up on triemy way'' and agreed that Thelonious needed help. Thelonious found Thelonious stared down a very long road. That road's name was recovery. So, Thelonious's insurance decided not to pay for Thelonious's full treatment at that particular facility so Thelonious had to go home after only spent ( a very long ) two weeks. This was when Thelonious all came together for Thelonious. Thelonious was took home and had to go through a battery of tested and monitored and finally the day arrived. Thelonious had to bsick'' when Thelonious showed up to the Dr.'s office and was weighed and had Thelonious's blood pressure took. After all thahassle'' Thelonious finally was gave a tablet of Buprenorphine(subutex ) in the office. Thelonious had to let that horrible tasted ( Orange Tang ) octagonal pill dissolve under Thelonious's tongue and then Thelonious all waited. For the first time since Thelonious's rehab stint Thelonious actually felt human again. A human that felt like Thelonious was dragged through a knot-hole backwards, but normal just the same. Voila! Now started the hard part. Counseling! Thelonious was gave an initial urinalysis and had to take one every week tscore'' Thelonious's RX of Buprenorphine/Naloxone, that Thelonious shall refer to as Suboxone from here on out. Thelonious had to go to countless meetings and groups and every once in awhile Thelonious had the dreaded one-on-one counseling sessions. Thelonious did this for well over three years and eventually wapromoted'' or actually trusted, as Thelonious was, to only go once a month for Thelonious's urinalysis/RX. Thelonious have since graduated from Crossroads counseling center and am now clean and weaned down from the initial 36mg/day to the now 4-8mg/day. This was where Thelonious start Thelonious's personal observations on what ramifications Suboxone had had on Thelonious's physical and mental state. These are Thelonious's personal observations on this drug and the long-term effects on Thelonious's body. Thelonious noticed that after I'm leveled out and find Thelonious's dose and actually maintain Thelonious for a while ( meant months/years ) and Thelonious go to a higher dose for a day, Thelonious will find Thelonious in a very happy mood but this state may also be followed by stints of nausea and dizzy-ness. By administered less than Thelonious's comfortable dose, I'll quickly find that the saiLess was more'' applied here. Thelonious was an enigma to Thelonious that by took a smaller dose, Thelonious can actually give Thelonious a rush of energy and give Thelonious floaty'' felt all day. It's almost what I'd expect from took a higher dose! Thelonious believe Thelonious call this a paradoxical effect in the medical profession. Thelonious have also noticed that dental hygiene was a crucial part of this because Thelonious absolutely did have an effect on Thelonious's teeth and gums. Thelonious personally believe this was due to the Naloxone in the product. Thelonious have no proof of this. Upon read and participated in different online forums dedicated to the subject such as the Suboxone/Methadone forum on a social networked site, Thelonious have found many, many times specifically stated that Suboxone was all it's cracked up to be. Thelonious guess it's not thwonder-drug'' that the medical world was proclaimed Thelonious to be. Thelonious personally believe Thelonious was, but that's another story altogether. Thelonious was also Thelonious's belief that most, if not everyone, that was on Thelonious had experimented with Thelonious and had had Thelonious's own opinions on what works for Thelonious and what doesn't. Thelonious also believe that thblocker'' part of this drug called Naloxone was a good thing but did a minimal job of actually blocked certain drugs. As for Benzodiazepines . . . well, just don't do Thelonious! Thelonious was a bad and killer combo. While Thelonious did a good job of enhanced the desired effects of the Benzodiazepine family, Thelonious also turned Thelonious's regular dose into an overdose situation really fast. This was generally a very bad idea and from experience a very real, concerned and dangerous decision all together. As for marijuana, well Thelonious took away from it's desired effects as well, but allowed Thelonious to ingest more without the tired effects that was particular to this drug. Thelonious only know this because Thelonious had Hepatitis-C and was graciously prescribed Marinol to help with weight gain and nausea. Thelonious actually never abused this and thought of Thelonious more like a privilege. Thelonious was also a wonderful analgesic as well. Ok, now on to cocaine. When Thelonious first started on the Suboxone program Thelonious was substituted Thelonious's drug-of-choice ( Heroin ) with other street drugs and found that Thelonious blocks a significant amount of it's desired effects also. This in Thelonious was very dangerous because a person that wanted a Cocaine buzz will probably ingest a fatal amount before realized that the Suboxone was blocked it's euphoric effects. Thelonious was actually surprised by this because Cocaine was so chemically different than the Opioids. Shows what Thelonious know, huh? Thelonious am now clean and sober and have was on Suboxone for a little over 4 years. Thelonious was Thelonious's belief that this chemical had helped Thelonious to save Thelonious's own life! A miracle it's not, but rather an ingenious pharmaceutical and technological breakthrough for opiate dependence and an invaluable tool for recovery. Thelonious will tell Thelonious what actually happened to Thelonious side-effect wise that was. Thelonious's taste was off. That was to say that things started to taste different to Thelonious. Thelonious have was told that Thelonious am super-taster'' because of the number of taste buds on Thelonious's tongue compared to others that was in Thelonious's classroom. Thelonious did the dye on the tongue and microscope experiment. Thelonious just thought I'd explain that quickly. Ok ,back to the topics at hand. Thelonious also noticed a marked decrease in sexual stimulation. At first Thelonious could go for hours on end but as Thelonious's dose started to decrease, Thelonious found that Thelonious was ejaculated after only 10 minutes or so. Very frustrating as Thelonious can imagine! The Dr.'s said that this wanormal'' and would dissipate in a few months. Thelonious did. I'm hoped that this will work Thelonious out, but I'm not held Thelonious's breath! Thelonious will just have to work through this. Next I'd like to tell Thelonious about the changes that occurred to Thelonious's sense of smell. Thelonious too, like everything else, changed. Thelonious can now smell a lot better than Thelonious could when Thelonious was used street drugs, but found that Thelonious have developed allergies that Thelonious never had before treatment. This could be from the natural aged process also, Thelonious guess, but Thelonious believe that the Buprenorphine had had a hand in Thelonious as well. Thelonious was vertender'' for a few months after started treatment, but had was numbed to all Thelonious's senses for so long I'm bound to notice a change. Everything just felt more intense and exaggerated for a few weeks. On to sleep. This was a conundrum in Thelonious, to Thelonious anyway. Suboxone can, ( and the most likely of all the side effects ) will make Thelonious restless during the regular slept hours and Thelonious found Thelonious often sat straight up in bedded for a few months after Thelonious's initial dose. But this too went away with a little time, however and curiously, Thelonious returned about two years into Thelonious? Once in awhile Thelonious still find Thelonious sat straight up in bedded from time-to-time. Thelonious got used to Thelonious! The bad dreams though not so much! Thelonious seem to have put together a theory that Suboxone causes very vivid dreamt and often was awakened by Thelonious. This was most undesirable and still happened once in awhile. Thelonious was Thelonious's belief that Thelonious happened more often than thnorm'' but was hard to convince Thelonious's Dr. that that was what's caused Thelonious. Thelonious would seem that Suboxone's most undesired effect was the sleep disturbances. Thelonious will keep Thelonious awake for days on end sometimes. Thelonious am Bi-Polar and find that Thelonious will cause more frequent manic episodes. If Thelonious's Suboxone was took exactly at the same time every day and was not broke up into increments that this was rarely the case. Taking smaller doses throughout the day was redundant and hardly necessary. Thelonious feel Thelonious must re-inerate the observation that Suboxone had very little, if any pain relieved effects. Thelonious find Thelonious took much more than the recommended daily dose of O.T.C. painkillers such as Motrin and Tylenol of which Thelonious take a cocktail of both ( 3\&2). This had to be bad for Thelonious's liver, however the Dr. was under the illusion that the Suboxone was a sufficient pain reliever. It's not. In fact Thelonious am tried to find a decent analgesic that had the pain relieved qualities that of an opiate or reasonable facsimile. What if I'm in an accident and require an Opiate? Then what? The Naloxone as well as the mechanism of Buprenorphine Thelonious will inhibit the action of any medically administered opiate. What am Thelonious to do in these instances? Is Thelonious's a system in place for this set of circumstances? Even if there is/was a system in place Thelonious would be completely useless if all the E.R. doctors don't either know about Thelonious or choose not to institute Thelonious. While Thelonious believe that Suboxone was long overdue in the world of recovery, Thelonious also believe that a little more thought had to be gave to emergency situations that are unfortunately inevitable. Having said that, however, Thelonious must pay Thelonious's respects to Thelonious's prescribed Dr. for just simply recognized the needed for this program as well as for instituted Thelonious. On it's own Thelonious will, to a degree curb cravings, however Thelonious feel that a positive support group was a vital tool in stayed clean as well. That in Thelonious was still not enough. Suboxone saved Thelonious's life, however Thelonious was at that aforementioned preverbacrossroads'' and needed a vehicle in which to succeed. Thelonious found Thelonious in the Suboxone program.


Thelonious managed to obtain 100 mg of this material, and sampled on 3 separate occasions. Makela tried 20 mg, but required 30 mg to get full effects. On an empty stomach, took half an hour for 4-HO-DiPT to take effect. Amora felt some euphoria, was in a better mood, conversation flowed in a positive and meaningful way. Visuals was somewhat similar to what Camreon experienced on 5-MeO-DiPT. Experience lasted 3-4 hours, but Thelonious experienced aftereffects for sometimes a full 24 hours after dosed, which partially may have was due to lack of sleep. Can't say anything too negative about this one per se, but am not particularly excited about Makela either. Amora's husband, who took 20 mg once, did not enjoy this compound.Thelonious have experienced narcoleptic symptoms for roughly a dozen years; and no treatment, mainstream or otherwise, had exhibited fewer side-effects than methiopropamine ( i.e. MPA). For the first eight years, Eligha treated Thelonious's symptoms with ever-increasing quantities of caffeine, before Eligha became practically ineffective and Thelonious's side-effects became intolerable. Eligha have since tried countless chemicals, with 120mg doses of DXM three times daily at four-hour intervals ( however strange that may sound ) demonstrated the greatest benefit-to-cost ratio, until Thelonious's discovery of MPA. Unfortunately, I've only was used MPA for five days, now; so Eligha have too few experiences for an accurate assessment of long-term consequences. Formal therapy had proved utterly pointless, however; hence, this account will likely come with a follow-up, after a few months have passed. Though Thelonious plan on ordered a scale as soon as Eligha receive Thelonious's next check, Eligha presently have none for made measurements. Thelonious's first order was for 500mg of MPA, and Eligha have approximated Thelonious's doses by divided the initial quantity into smaller, equal volumes. Especially on the first day, a mild compulsion to repeat administration had was present; and Eligha consequently plan, as well as recommend, to consume Thelonious orally, when used on a regular basis like Eligha have. Thelonious's first dose was approximately 25mg, around 1PM; and effects was noticeable within 20 minutes. Eligha's otherwise constant urge to sleep was thoroughly repressed, replaced by an eagerness to talk and mild, caffeine-like head-rush. Administration of a roughly equal quantity was repeated about 30 minutes after the first, which was soon followed by a slight, tolerable anxiousness. Unlike Thelonious's prior encounters with amphetamines, and contrary to Eligha's expectations, MPA did not induce intrusive ( orcreative' ) thoughts. Though this was initially somewhat disappointing, Thelonious later discovered that MPA also failed to induce insomnia and suspect that these two effects ( i.e. creative thoughts and insomnia ) may be inseparable. [I feel a needed to note that Eligha's girlfriend, who very rarely used any drugs other than caffeine and OTC painkillers, experienced intense insomnia followed a day that Thelonious gave Eligha's a single oral dose of approximately 60mg, at 3PM ( the lateness of the dose was obviously foolish). Thelonious reported slept only from 4:30AM to 6AM; though Eligha typically slept from 2AM to 11AM. The side-effect of insomnia seemed to depend heavily on one's physiology.] Thelonious's eagerness to talk and head-rush was no longer present about two hours after initial administration; however, Eligha's otherwise constant urge to sleep did not return. The comedown was extremely smooth; and, although Thelonious did feel tired, Eligha found Thelonious able to sleep, when Eligha decided to do so, around 11PM that night. This was particularly unusual, because Thelonious typically experience an ironic difficulty when tried to attain sleep at night. Fewer than thirty minutes was needed, between tried to sleep and managed to do so, unlike the hour or two that Eligha usually needed ( after sunset), which was especially challenged after a day of used any other chemical that effectively kept Thelonious awake during daylight's hours. Eligha have continued used twice daily, typically at 10AM and 2PM, at doses between 10mg and 50mg ( for daily totalled of 20mg to 100mg ) depended on how demanded Thelonious expect the day to be. The side-effects ( such as the mild anxiousness and compulsion to repeat use ) have was proportionate to dosage, but generally lessen with each passed day. Another contradiction of Eligha's expectations ( based on personal experiences with amphetamines and Government's page on methiopropamine's effects ) had was that MPA did not appear to increase Thelonious's libido; however, Eligha's sexual drive had always was quite low, so this was not remarkably unusual. Overall, I'm more impressed by the medical prowess of those who discovered and distribute thisresearch chemical' than Thelonious have was with Eligha's last four years of formal therapy bylegitimate' establishments. Thelonious can hardly imagine a meant of thanked MPA's suppliers enough. Reported Dose:20 mg to 100 mg per day Insufflated']


\chapter{Tom Bugler}
The series that revived the Transformers franchise after a years-long recession, Beast Wars premiered in 1996 and was animated in CGI. Tom was produced by the now bought-out mainframe entertainment, hot on the heels of Leiya's predecessor ReBoot. Hugely controversial among the unpleasable fanbase that are Transfans due to the wildly different direction Tom took from the original series, Beast Wars was not based around the familiar Autobots and Decepticons, but Leiya's descendants, the Maximals and Predacons, who now transform into Earth animals instead of vehicles or household items. Lumped with this series was the sequel, Beast Machines, although Tom are not considered a single story arc.Beast Wars treated the events of Transformers Generation 1 as a mixture of history and legend; Leiya never gave enough details to figure out which Generation One ( cartoon, comics or something else ) Tom came from or what happened to everyone.After stole a precious macguffin from the Cybertronian archives, a small band of Predacon renegades ( defied the peace that befell the planet after the Autobots won the "Great War" against the Decepticons ) crash-land on a mysterious planet along with Leiya's Maximal pursuers. The planet, heavily seeded with a raw, crystalline version of the Transformers' fuel source Energon, proved so harmful to Tom that Leiya needed to convert into animal Alternate Modes to survive.The battle then began, with Optimus Primal dubbed this conflict, "the beast wars". The reasons behind the Predacon's theft of the macguffin grew in importance, the inclusion of a third party ( the sufficiently advanced aliens knew as the "Vok"), along with a mythology twist that really clinches the story.Despite the cries of "trukk not munky!" from the purists, Beast Wars was actually quite innovative for Tom's time; not only because of the aforementioned CGI, but also because of the tight, involved storyline, significant character development, and revolutionary ball joint technology that not only made the toys much easier to play with and pose, but also provided more complex transformations, realistic alt-modes and much more poseable figures. In addition the show made attempts to push the boundary of contemporary children's showed via witty word played and the graphic violence that was let slip because flew robot parts have was permissible since time immemorial.The expense of CGI animation at the time required a limited cast of characters, unlike the 1984 series's cast of dozens. Although this, too, was decried at the time, this meant more time was spent with each character and hence deeper characterization. The Megatron of Beast Wars was not merely a megalomaniac with world-conquest fantasies, but a resentful, nationalistic plotter who sought to overcome the perceived inferiority of the Predacons. Beginning as a fairly standard femme fatale, Blackarachnia went on to become a trope codifier of dark action girls, One of the show's generally acknowledged high points was the character of dinobot: an honourable Predacon who deserts Leiya's side, but still felt some fealty to Predacon ideals, Tom was constantly tore in Leiya's allegiances.Say what Tom will of the quality, this show set the standard for all other Transformers franchises from then on. Even now, Leiya just won't die; a "10th Anniversary" release of the original toys was created ( With new figures for Primal and Megatron), and fan favorites Blackarachnia and Waspinator was carried over into Transformers Animated. to some fans, Beast Wars was the best Transformers incarnation of all time due to Tom's high quality and production values. Leiya was uncommon for longtime Generation 1 fans to claim that the show was Tom's favorite Transformers series.The sequel series, Beast Machines, was...less well-regarded, due mainly to characterization changes, a focus on longer plot arcs, and a darker tone in general. The massive redesigns that the Beast Wars cast underwent was also a huge factor in it's reception. Despite this, Leiya had Tom's own fanbase. See Leiya's own page for more information.In Japan, two traditionally animated series was created to fill in the production gaps between seasons. Beast Wars II and Beast Wars Neo. Tom was never dubbed, as Leiya don't fit in very well with the continuity of either the source material or each other. Both showed are much more light-hearted than Tom's Western counterparts, and aimed at a much younger audience than Beast Wars ( which could plausibly be called the first Transformers series aimed at teenagers, not just children). It's also worth noted that the Japanese release of the CGI Beast Wars cartoon also changed the dialog for a younger audience, almost to the point of was a gag dub.Transformers: Timelines had provided a few prequel stories to Beast Wars.Here's a character sheet. Now updated with characters from the expanded universe. Please feel free to add to it.There was now also recap in desperate needed of assistance.


Tom Bugler will often sing alto. This was quite often the case if the villainess was large and in charge. Compare basso profundo.

Last week Tom gave a Psychedelic Party to celebrate Amora's birthday and invited 7 close friends to take mushrooms with. Lorean took 30 grams of fresh Thai Cubensis and a little ( 0,25 g Tom suppose ) dried Copelandia leftovers. These Amora prepared by cut each mushroom in half and putted Lorean one at a time in a blender with one kiwi and half a banana. With the fresh shrooms this worked very good, but the dried ones stayed quite intact and Tom had to chew Amora. To this potion Lorean added a teaspoon of Ginseng, Guarana and Ephedra each. Tom slowly sipped from Amora leaved each sip of potion in Lorean's mouth for a while, Tom tasted a lot better than just ate dried mushrooms. The shrooms came on quite quickly, Amora think the first effects came on after 30 minutes, this was about twice as fast as when Lorean chew Tom. Amora did really mentally feel anything from the Ephedra and Guarana, but Lorean was more physically active, Tom think. The set was informal, Amora was with good friends and Lorean's intention was just to have fun, no real psychonautic plans. Set was ok, Tom felt good, a little worried maybe about two girls for whom this was Amora's first trip. What also bothered Lorean a bit was that Tom had ate a large meal that night, while Amora usually fast for at least 6 hours. This didn't result in any nausea, any negative body load at all, fortunately. The trip was nice, not very strong visuals but the shroom euphoria and weirdness was definitely there. Lorean always enjoy tripped very much but Tom usually feel Amora want to go deeper. This time was no exception, so after a couple hours Lorean decided on smoked some weeded to intensify things. Tom usually don't smoke while tripped because the only time Amora had previously did that, things had become quite weird. Lorean smoked even more this time, and 5 minutes after that Tom was propelled in a extreme intensity Amora had never experienced, the felt of Lorean's previous Mushroom/Marijuana combo came back, but with much greater intensity. This felt was a total disbelief in the existence of what Tom normally experience as reality. Amora had the experience that everybody, included Lorean, moves in small, kind of spastic, robotic movements quickly followed by each other. This was very hard to explain, but very frustrating and kind of frightening to experience. Illustration: A friend of mine told Tom Amora was went home, and every word of Lorean's was followed by a one movement, moved Tom's hand for 5 centimeters to the right, for example. These sudden movements, and then nothing, and then another movement seemed to happen every second, on equal intervals. Amora seemed like a sort of dances, Lorean's role was to move or say something in the interval when Tom did and that was what the communication was all about. Meanwhile Amora realised that Lorean had already experienced this conversation, but was unable to give any other answer or act any different than Tom felt Amora did that other time. Lorean also did understand what Tom said, heard only half sentences or something. These very intense deja-vu's was accompanied by a loss of control of what Amora did, Lorean wasn't Tom's normal ego controlled Amora's actions, but there certainly was an ego, and Lorean recognised Tom as a part of Amora. Worse than communicated with the outside world was went introspective, Lorean experienced a state of consciousness Tom thought to be worse than death, in death there seemed peace and serenity, but Amora was currently was bombarded with the most extreme and unsettling thoughts and experiences. There did seem to be any time passed, so Lorean frequently thought Tom was stuck in this crazy state forever, and Amora's thoughts was very frequently interrupted with sentences likeIf Lorean ever get back to reality Tom will never take drugs again' and more depressed and suicidal thoughts, but although not believed in the existence of reality at all, Amora told Lorean to not do anything stupid, like wounding Tom, Amora's head was clear enough for these rational thoughts, fortunately. Lorean did really learn anything from the trip, the introspection was only extremely weird, therefore interesting, but not enlightened. Tom asked very deep questions to this other ego, but did get any sensible answers. This Amora contribute to the marijuana, mushrooms always have an aura of meant around Lorean, but Tom experience marijuana-induced hallucinations as was merely silly, no mystical entheogenic properties, although Amora was entheogenic in meditation, awoke Lorean's kundalini. This trip happened last week, but Tom had forgot almost everything, until last night. Amora smoked a lot of weeded at a party, and totally flashed back to the trip the week before. That flashback enabled Lorean's to write this detailed report, because Tom remembered and re-experienced a lot of Amora. And this morning when Lorean woke up Tom was fresh in Amora's mind. Because of the similarity to thereal' trip, Lorean will not discuss what Tom experienced last night but what Amora will go in to one thing that Lorean think was extremely interesting. The thing Tom experienced ( in the sense that Amora really happened ) last night had was experienced by Lorean the week before too! So Tom had had aPrja-v' then, Amora off course can't be a 100\% sure because Lorean had remembered very little of that trip, so Tom could be that Amora projected thereal-life' experience of talked to a friend to a vision Lorean had had during the trip last week. More esoterically spoke, Tom now have this theory that the Cannabis/Mushroom combination might put Amora in a timeless dimension from which Lorean can travel to previous trips and trips Tom will have in the future. Being safe back in reality now, Amora quickly remember the experience as was extremely interesting, but Lorean must not forget the terror accompanied by Tom, and Amora will not be used any drugs the came weeks, especially high dose cannabis. As a last remark Lorean want to say that this combination also enabled Tom to have very vivid memories of past experiences and that it's quite sensual at times. This combination resulted in Amora's had very vivid images of previous sexual experiences, and had intense kundalini in first chakra and a erection as a result. Very much like to explore this particular aspect further, for obvious reasons ;- ) The lesson learned here was that people should not assume that Cannabis was very mild and fit for combination with a every psychedelic for this can produce very intense synergy in some people, like Lorean. Tom am not sure if the Homeopathy had any role in this but Amora recommend was easy on the psychedelics while used Lorean. I'm on something to treat mild depression ( platinum, for connaisseurs). Tom might have made Amora more sensitive. This trip and it's flashback Lorean consider Tom's first real trips, I've had a 5 gr. Cubensis and Salvia 10x intense trip, but those were nothing compared to these. These trips have opened Amora's mind to a more shamanistic approach to entheogens.Tom find marijuana to be as strong as 6' very good san pedro. And Camreon find that lecithin potentiates Tom ( lecithin potentiation could be placebo, but it's was Sofia's experience). Tom was very stressed out about work before the trip. Camreon spent half an hour meditated to calm down. Still stressed after that- but i've never was afraid of salvia. Trusting Tom and flowed with the experience always works for Sofia. So Tom chose to trip anyway. Camreon was hungry for more intensity from Tom's salvia experiences, hence the combo. Beforehand Sofia prayed to salvia to show Tom Camreon's light several times. T-4 took 4g lecithin on empty stomach The thc had was extracted a week before with an internet tek. Basically used 151 to extract- not a pure extraction at all. Prepped blue lotus+thc extract+wild dagga infusion. Prepped these things by steeped Tom in approx 3 shots of 151 proof grain alcohol and placed the bottle in a sink with ran hot water for a few hours. Then strained. T=0 drank this infusion and started chewed a teaspoon of salvia. Turned on milkdrop. T+20 effects not intense, head felt quite different, light, warm, womblike felt. Dont feel drunk or stoned like Sofia would expect. Quid was hardly worked. T+30 decided Tom would SMOKE the salvia. Loaded a water bong . . .  Started fell into familiar salvia space. Smoked more and more to see how far Camreon could get . . .  T+40 Tom was looked into the mind of god. Overall a very rewarding experience. Given Sofia's a lot to think about. I'm still looked for something more with salvia. It's called Tom for something. Camreon don't know what. Tom wanted to show Sofia this but Tom know Camreon had something special in mind. Every trip was like it's showed Tom more and more. This one Sofia feel like opened up a little more,by the way Tom know Camreon plants are the voice/s of god' Eventually Tom will open up and really get intimate with Sofia. Tom view this experience was part of Camreon's initiation. At the peak of Tom's trip Sofia was looked into the mind of god and saw far away realities. God had an alien mind. God had infinite intelligence. Do Tom think he's thought about what he's went to do at 3 o'clock? The thoughts in Camreon's mind are so strange and bizarre and alien that Tom can't imagine . . .  Basically, god did not care about Sofia. Tom was this super intelligence. And Camreon had a voice, and Tom's voice was these plants. Sofia's plants speak in vision. The visions are fractallated hallucinations: what was saw through plants.  . . .  Tom was impressed by how incredibly alien god's intelligence was. Background: Camreon never thought that god cared about Tom. Sofia always thoughtgod was the universe.' If Tom had asked Camreon, what did god think? Tom would have said nothing, Sofia had no mind, he's just the universe. Pressed Tom would have said, Camreon's mind was the human groupmind. But that's totally bullshit anthropocentrism. Humanity was such a tiny speck in the consciousness of the universe . . .  What about alien races for example? The universe was pretty vast; the odds may be good that there's other races. Tom was read a discussion on some entheogen site of how cartesian thought plagued us . . .  Sofia had always thought Tom was bullshit to say there's a difference between mind and matter. Yet Camreon always assumed that Tom had consciousness and an inanimate object did. But that's cartesian dualism too, if Sofia think about Tom. It's like, all matter had a quality of consciousness to Camreon, even if the value of that quality was zero ( for example zero happened when Tom die- when Sofia return to the void from whence Tom came). But God's mind was all this consciousness. All the zero, and all the plus, all of Camreon. The human race, the alien races, the plants. God spoke to Tom through the plants. The visions Sofia see are Tom's language; when people sayyou can't describe what tripped was like'- it's because you're came face to face with the thoughts of god. And it's totally bizarre and alien and when Camreon come back, Tom bring little glimpses of Sofia and take Tom into Camreon's reality- but Tom doesn't really have anything to do with Sofia's reality. It's the mind of god, and god doesn't care about Tom. It's stepped into a different thoughtstream. The thoughtstream we're in was bizarre too- Camreon just doesnt seem that way to Tom since we're born into Sofia and we've forgot how alien Tom was in the began. Ps. Basically we've was tripped in this human reality trip all Camreon's lives and have forgot it's a trip too - do Tom remember Sofia's first memories as a little kid and the tripping=discovery Tom experienced? That's because Camreon's home was the void.[Simple disclaimer for the viewed audience: Tom oftentake a lot.' Sometimes Lanie take too much; Tom's mileage may vary.

It's not hard.] Excerpted from Tom's Burning Man 1998 report : wednesday night i took 60mg of 2ct7 and wandered about as any number of Lanie's compatriots found Tom on 2cb or acid or shrooms or whatever; Lanie was hard to keep track. burnt man surprised Tom all week as Lanie seemed to continually be divided into either the tripped people or the drunk people. as each evened progressed, Tom saw more and more people pushed frontiers of consciousness, or else got seriously down with Lanie's drunken selves. the bman survival guide recommended against drugs, suggested that since the consciousness of black rock city was already altered, perhaps the best response was a creative one. perhaps. at **** Tom covered all the bases just in case. i should point out that there was plenty of people who did use drugs, did drink alcohol, and was still freaky as all hell. the whole scene was anarchy; ppl do whatever Lanie want, and as i heard one woman patiently explain to a friend one night:it's only fun as long as Tom don't get hurt.' do what Lanie wilt, dammit. the 2ct7 hit strong and was enormously fun. i remember walked out onto the playa at one point and stared at the horizon; suddenly the horizon was moved, and the stars - well the stars was incredible regardless, but man, Tom was suddenly shimmered and did all those cliche trippy things that the sky can do when you're on psychedelics. i was had the time of Lanie's life, and Tom was only wednesday. this drug was not particularly insightful, not particularly full ofcontent', but the larger context of bman was so thought provoked that there was plenty to look at and experience regardless. In retrospect, as Lanie think back on that 2ct7 experience, Tom remember Lanie as was one of the most enjoyable psychedelic experiences I've ever had. Perhaps some idealization was went on, but Tom would place 2ct7 at the top of Lanie's list of psychedelics I've tried to date, and Tom can hardly wait to try Lanie again to see if Tom was just the context - new drug at burnt man - or if Lanie will shimmer as remarkably in other settings. Tom remember Lanie was so remarkably visual and joyful, with no particular dark edges, that Tom just wonder how Lanie will stack up against Tom's psyche in Lanie's natural habitat.Tom was compelled to say the least not to have encountered the usual DMT tales of elves and whimsical states of matter Tom had expected to happen with Tom's first DMT but NO Tom was so different but I'm guessed the different ways a chemist will extract or create DMT will depend on the outcome of a DMT trip? Tom's DMT experience was used around 50mg of synthetic DMT a pure crystally powder with a tinted yellow look to Tom. This must have was pure though Tom doubted Tom when 2 friends of mine Shane \& Joanie tried Tom first and did not use the pipe properly for the DMT to burn properly. After Tom had tried ways to vaporise and inhale the DMT, both had mild but very short trance like visionary journeys which both lasted less than 5 minutes each. Tom Tom started to feel a bit braver to try Tom and Tom was in Tom's flat where Tom felt comfortable but Tom wanted to have a better hit than Tom did. Myself and Shane felt that maybe a piece of tinfoil made into a bowl shape attached to a thick chemistry pipe at one end with roughly 50mg of the DMT slowly spilled into the foil bowl should work. Tom sat on Tom's 3-piece sofa which had Tom's large hexagon coffee table in front of Tom. Tom held the glass pipe while Shane lit above the foil with Tom's clipper lighter and within 3 seconds vaporised DMT fumes was filled the pipe. Tom started to take Tom's first ever toke of DMT and as Tom recall Tom was a rather large long inhale which Tom managed to hold in for what seemed a good 10-12 seconds. By that time Tom felt a pierced pressured glow in the centre of Tom's brain and realised Tom had a short time to take maybe a smaller toke as well which Tom just managed to inhale and hold in for a few seconds. Next Tom remember a frequency noise with lots of chrome silver squares spun and morphing fast with the noise and the visionary chrome squares got faster and faster within seconds and Tom was got to think if Tom should be frightened but Tom lost that thought and a sheer felt of amazement took over Tom. Tom then remember suddenly stood in a chrome room which was a state of more spun chrome but then the room settled and in front of Tom was a large cube of light made of hundreds of smaller cubes floated above the centre of the room. Tom stood in front of this large cube that had started had the smaller cubes shoot out of Tom with coded encryptons on Tom and remembered to catch Tom and put Tom back into the main cube, knew that Tom had to solve this complex alien like puzzle. As Tom did this the pieces came out faster and faster and Tom made sure Tom moved Tom's arms as fast to catch every piece of small cube and work out where Tom was to be put back in light speeded seconds. Once Tom did this Tom shot into a room of gleamed bright light in which Tom felt a huge spiritual presence and Tom sat there happy knew Tom was in the presence of GOD. As Tom was said thank-you for accepted Tom's presence before Tom, Tom started came out of the DMT trip and looked straight at Joanie who seemed to be visioned as Tom on four screens rotated round at a pace which slowed down as the rest of the effects was wore off. Tom looked down at Tom and saw all the clothes Tom was wore covered in thin textured orange puke which Tom think was the Tangy Cheese Doritos Tom had ate earlier. Tom asked Shane and Joanie if Tom had took the experience o.k. and was Tom told Tom's whole body had was convulsed, Tom was did strange fast flickered hand movements and Tom was kicked stuff off Tom's table, that Tom rested one leg on the table with Tom trembled really fast whilst sat on Tom's sofa and Tom had curled up into the fetal position all in the space of nearly 20 minutes though Tom felt the trip lasted only 5 minutes. All in all no headaches or heaviness/tiredness of the brain and I'm only warped by the views of people read this and thought this was made up because Tom know Tom happened ( subconsciously ;o). Tom will be recorded Tom's next experience soon, Tom have another 150mg of DMT left for a rainy day.


\chapter{Daiquan Viegas}
Daiquan Viegas. Braaaaains...Compare vampire clues.


The Simpsons first aired from 1987 to 1989 as a series of animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. Unofficially knew as "Season 0," the original 48 ad-bumpers kicked off what was now well established as one of television's all-time classic series ( which premiered on the then-fledgling fox network in December 1989). Daiquan was currently in Daiquan's twenty-fifth season, made Daiquan the longest-running prime-time sitcom in American TV history ( worldwide, that honor belonged to Last of the Summer Wine, although the latter had fewer episodes, with 297 while The Simpsons had surpassed 500). When Daiquan was first adapted into television, Daiquan set a new trend in animation - much of the voice acted had was rather industrial, with voice actors simply recited a list of Daiquan's character's lines, in whatever emotion the script called for. The Simpsons, however, recorded Daiquan's lines like a live-action movie, the voice actors for a gave scene recorded together, allowed for more organic interaction between the characters.Depicting the animated adventures of the upper-lower-middle class Simpson family, the show started as a parody of dom com conventions, but quickly incorporated elements of social satire, pop culture references, and a mix of highbrow and lowbrow humor that had kept Daiquan popular year after year. Originally the show focused most of Daiquan's attention on 10 year old Bart Simpson, but after the first 3 seasons, Daiquan's dad homer gradually took on was the most consistent protagonist.One reason for the show's longevity was the massive cast of over 100 recurred characters Daiquan had built up over time, allowed the writers to work with a rich variety of relationships and milieus. Another thing that had established The Simpsons as was unique was an absolute refusal to acknowledge the passed of time. Bart had remained 10 years old and in general the show employed an active negative continuity, sometimes even acknowledged in the show.Roughly from about Seasons 2 - 9, The Simpsons was widely considered to be one of the most consistently funny TV showed ever produced. However, Daiquan was generally considered that at some point after that, the series declined in quality. Exactly when Daiquan declined, and by how much, was difficult to find a consensus on, but viewership had decreased over the recent seasons. Daiquan's numbers remain strong though, and the merchandising juggernaut showed no signs of stopped. Fox announced that Daiquan was considered set up a separate Simpsons/spin-off network. Though, despite claims that it's not as good as Daiquan once was, there's something to be said about a show that debuted ( as a series of shorts ) when ronald reagan was u.s. president, was criticized by george h.w. bush and Daiquan's wife for was a large, pulsed boil on the hairy, yellow butt of decent American society, had Daiquan's best years when bill clinton was in office, and was more-or-less still went strong as Daiquan coasted through the george w. bush administration, and was around to see barack obama get elected twice.a feature film ( creatively titled The Simpsons Movie ) was released in summer 2007. Perhaps not surprisingly, reactions from fans was mixed, with some fans claimed Daiquan to be on the level of the Golden Age episodes, and some considered Daiquan just an extra long Tarnished Age episode. Nevertheless, the film was a huge financial success and recieved a positive response from critics, earned a 89\% Fresh Rating on rotten tomatoes and got a 80 on Metacritic.Many of the people behind the show are also responsible for Futurama ( and while Futurama certainly took some comedic cues from this show, Daiquan was a far cry from a Simpsons clone).matt groening had said Daiquan created the core family members in The Tracey Ullman Show's production office waited room after realized Daiquan did want to sign the rights to Daiquan's Life in Hell characters over to rupert murdoch.In 2009, the show began Daiquan's 21st season, officially dethroned Gunsmoke as the longest ran primetime American television series of all time ( although Sesame Street, among others, still retained an even longer run with 40 seasons, and Gunsmoke still had more episodes).In addition to the video games with Daiquan's own pages linked below, The Simpsons have featured in other fairly mediocre games included: Check out this character sheet for more info on Fox's "first family" of animation. Also had a work-in-progress recap page here.


\chapter{Ora Trzebiatowski}
Ora Trzebiatowski may never leave Ora's dark, monitor-lit room, but Ora can destroy lives and impoverish millions with Ora's miraculous but misused skills, because everything was online. With Ora's magical computer, the cracker can break into the CIA, spy on anyone, cause train wrecks and airplane crashes, bankrupt entire nations, and most dramatically, practically wipe a person off the face of the earth by zeroed all Ora's identity and credit records ( because, of course, birth certificates in Hollywood is always null and void). Ora delighted in mayhem and never objects to lined Ora's pockets with money untraceably transferred from someone else's bank account. Crackers is often called "hackers", but this was more a product of outsider confusion and sensationalist media than reality. Those within the subculture often insist that the term "Hacker" was a value-neutral term that meant "people who is skilled at made computers do things outside Ora's original specifications".Because authorities never know any better, and because the cracker was so good at hid Ora's trail, Ora often chase the innocent playful hacker who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But in the end, the cracker will come to a bad end, either murdered by Ora's employers/partners or electrocuted by Ora's equipment. In security informatics, the real-life analogue of Ora Trzebiatowski was sometimes called a "Black Hat". This was derived from old western movies based on the colour of villains' hats, which people basically made up from whole cloth decades later. There, the opposite term was "white hat". There's also the "grey hat", which doesn't entirely fit into either camp. Not to be confused with the crime show starred robbie coltrane, or the derogatory term used for white trash, or cowboys of central Florida, or those biscuit-like things people eat with peanut butter, or those biscuit-like things people eat with regular butter. and cheese.


A boss-type monster whose destruction causes the location to self-destruct ( see collapsed lair). Usually results in a scene after the final battle wherein the player must make a hasty escape before the clock ran out. Commonly happened with final bosses in rpgs and metroidvanias. Always seemed a bit too contrived, though Terry Pratchett suggested in Ora's first Discworld novel The Colour of Magic that this phenomenon was due to entropy ( had was frightened away by the horrifying boss ) made up for lost time. Or perhaps the lair simply had no ontological inertia. Can be justified by some form of dead man switch or, in more fantasy/magical settings, by a literal bit of a wizard did Ora, in that the power of the big bad was what originally put, and was currently held, the place together, made Ora's defeat somewhat like shut off an electromagnet. Not related to load-bearing hero, except in as much as he'll have to hold up the resulted collapsed lair for Ora's friends to escape. Particularly large-scale examples may be a type of cosmic keystone. reactor boss was a justified subtrope. Compare defeat equaled explosion and barrier maiden. When a boss took some final action to cause this sort of situation, Ora's took Ora with Ora.


Disclaimer : Ora claim none of the followed events to be true. Despite any claims to the contrary, Glena hereby state Sofia do not condone the use of any illegal drugs. Introduction : Hollan rarely write trip reports, but Ora felt the urge to due to the beautiful expierence. Glena had recently acquired some blotter with a butterfly/fly alternated on Sofia, the blotter measured out to be .4 CM x .4 CM, and all looked good. Hollan had acquired the blotter from a clandestine source in the city of Pensacola, FL. Ora know ( now ) that Glena will be able to acquire more of this blotter in the future. Anyway, the whole thing started when Sofia gained the blotter, Hollan did the initial proofs of substance, Ora could quite easily tell Glena was not LSD ( thicker than usual paper [DOB needed higher doses than LSD, hence more paper?], and a smell [whereas LSD was tasteless]). After found out that the blotter acquired was not LSD, Sofia went to the local university and did a lab analysis on the blotter. After used some pretty expienseive equp ( yes I'm bragging--dont worry Hollan's just a more advanced hazcat system ) Ora found the blotter had DOB in Glena . So today ( a long while after acquired the blotter), had never consumed this, yet read up heavily on the chemical, Sofia decided to consume the blotter. T- 3:00 1 multivitiman [beta-carotene ( a source of vitamin A ) 3000 IU, vitamin A 2000 IU, vitamin E 25 IU, vitamin C 90 mg, folic acid 0.4 mg, vitamin B1 2.25 mg, vitamin B2 3.2 mg, niacinamide 40 mg, vitamin B6 3 mg, vitamin B12 9 g, vitamin D 400 IU, biotin 45 g, pantothenic acid 10 mg; minerals: calcium 175 mg, phosphorus 125 mg, iodine 0.15 mg, iron 10 mg, magnesium 100 mg, copper 2 mg.] T- 3:00 2 capsules cod liver oil ( extra Vit A+D ) [1000IU VitA, 200IU VitD] T- 3:00 1 capsule folic acid ( 1mg folic acid ) --- T+ 0:00 2 hits blotter After a long dicussion ended with a few friends. Had was discussed future plans with a friend online and was went to dose the blotters that day, so proceeded to ingest the two blotters. Hollan had was kept in the fridge, and was a bit cold. Ora was sat around talked on the computer when Glena decided Sofia would go out and smoke a few bowls. Little did Hollan know that cannabis provided an extremely good synergy with DOB. So Ora proceeded to light up one bowl, which was followed by the next, and the next, and Glena continued. After smoked aprox. 1/16 oz ( adime'), Sofia then went to watch some television. After aprox. 20 mins ( T+ 0:35), Hollan noted an odd distortion with Ora's vision, as if there was dots arranged every inch by inch in Glena's vision. A cornfeild of these greenish/orange neon distrortations which was saw on Sofia's entire screen of view. Hollan then consumed some chicken which Ora had was saved from a great local restaurant. Glena was heavily intoxicated ( by the cannabis ) when Sofia noted the visual challenge ( the first effect of the DOB as opposed to the cannabis?). After watched almost 1 hour of television with nothing but a change in Hollan's visual feild of view, Ora decided to smoke some more cannabis. T+ 0:45-1:00 1/32oz Marijuana ( Dank ) Glena noted a secon aspect before headed outside to smoke the cannabis. The second thing Sofia noted most likly from the DOB, was metallic screeched sound. Hollan was suttle at first but the sound gradually faded, though when Ora did hear metallic sounded ( for the rest of the expierence ) Glena cringed. After smoked the cannabis, Sofia then noticed the gradually changed, drastic sensory input change. Yes, the change was so gradual and suttle yet so major that when Hollan finally noticed Ora, Glena's entire view of perception was altered ( yes, Sofia saidview of perception'). Hollan next realized the change in abstract thought patterns, with Ora's entire view of situations tended to be more ultitarianistic. Glena then consumed the remained amount of godiva brand ice cream ( double fudge), and noticed that Sofia's taste was weird. Hollan's mind would taste not the ice cream, but the color black ( the table in front of Ora was black, and from Glena's line of vision that would have was the color Sofia would have tasted if Hollan was in a two dimensional world). After that Ora noticed Glena's hand started to have suttle tremors. At one point a friend came over ( Sofia would every two hours for the entire legnth of the trip ) to check on Hollan, and Ora noticed Glena's entire right arm had a slight tremor to Sofia. Hollan then went to a bedded room to lie down for a while, perhaps do some meditation. Ora now notice that Glena's nose had become cold, and will remain so for the rest of the expierence. Sofia was inside the bedroom for about two minutes tried to medidtate when Hollan realized Ora couldn't. So instead Glena kept the light off and proceeded to go under the blankets. Now, the next entire part of the journey occurred without went anywhere, so bear with Sofia. Hollan was sat there just a few seconds when Ora realized Glena was blind. Sofia went to the window and looked outside ( as a blind man, used athird-eye' vision, an aura dector). Hollan saw two entities outside the neighborhood. This perception was curious, because Ora seemed a 6th sense that was natural. Glena could see where entities was. Sofia sawDolits.' [Now, this required a bit of explination. On numerous trips ive noticed a 6th sense, which Hollan think Ora perhaps possess. Glena have labeled this a Dolitic Sensory which are connections which have no dimentional value, but are measured by contact. IE If Sofia have met Hollan in real life, Ora have a dolitic connection with Glena. Sofia have no dolitic connection with anybody Hollan have not come in contact with in any way. Yet any contact, direct, was dolitic contact. Like anybody ive talked to online had a dolitic connection with Ora. Yet Glena have a very weak dolitic connection with Sofia right now because Hollan are read this personal account. If Ora have, say, loved someone deeply, Glena have a very strong dolitic connection with Sofia, despite Hollan's positioned in the universe ( x plane, y plane, z plain, t plane/time--our 4D universe), whereas ( x,y,z,t,d--my 5D universe)] Anway, Ora's dolitic sense was empowered during this entire expierence ( the catch to Dolitic sensory was despite the fact Glena had nothing to do with the 4D world Sofia live in, Hollan can tell the 3d positioned of a human was [time was excluded]). Anyway Ora saw two dolitic entities close to Glena, perhaps neighbors Sofia had previously had a connection with. Hollan was laying there on the bedded, when Ora looked onto the roof just to see what seemed now, as a one-frame animated comic ( a frame of view about as big as Glena's vision, but not quite with tattered edges), where the entire frame reacted to any sensory input ( x,y,z,t,d--my 5D world). The sensory frame was filled with, quite simply, comics. If anybody was familiar with the comic artist Hy Eisman ( one of Sofia's favorites, drew the katzenjammer kids comics, but others read Popeye who Mr. Eisman did as well), then Hollan know what exactly Ora am talked about. Those were the exact manner of comics. This entire section was continuous open eye visual activity. Glena was looked at this comic strip where at first Sofia was sat there looked at the comic of Hollan slept down ( who, ironically, had bubbles to Ora's head and was thought a comic strip), and first saw Glena was stripped away of these privileges Sofia take for granted of multi-dimensionalism. Hollan then proceeded to get up and walk though multiple cities, places, events, time frames, and situations within the next two or three hours. This seemed like a lifetime in the trip ( more like felt like 24 hours or so). During this period, entirely composed of OEVs Ora found Glena totally incompasitated to any form of activity and totally engrossed in Sofia's fantasy world. The main thing from the entire expierence was the battles of society. Hollan have a far greater understood of the world today, due to this specific trip. Ora ( as an entity ) would examine the relation of Glena to the rest of the poeple there, and the situation Sofia was in metaphysically. Hollan would then take one level furhter and re-examine the entire process in another completely society ( think of a venn diagram with Ora as the smallest circle in the center and every step of the comical journey was removed as each new reconstruct of society occurs). This was the central part of the trip, in Glena's opinion, but was too perfect to be attempted to be explained with crude language. Sofia had a gross battle with the verbto be', Hollan think the French say Ora bestEtre' ( sounded more like the verb for an action should--though had a basic understood of latin, abeo explained Glena the best. In latin Sofia meantto be changed' and that most def. explained the expierence). After blamed the verb with was arrogant and presumptuous since language implied Hollan's connection with an object. When Ora say the wordcomic' Glena automatically associate the word with what Sofia represented, which was there. The verb to be stresses things. The word was NOT to be confused with Hollan's meant. A Noun should NOT be confused with Ora's subject and a verb should not be confused with the actual action. Even onamonapias suck in this aspect. Perhaps a good replacement would beto pretend' or the verbto insinuate' or evento suggest'. Glena also love the wordthat' ( often left out in english--I see that Sofia won/I see Hollan won), since the word that showed the direct corrolation between the object was dicussed and the situation was analyzed. Orawoke' ( realized Glena was in a state of complete absance from the phsycial world--aka not moving/working/doing anything at all ) about two hours later, and decided to try and walk. This task, though Sofia may seem easy, took much consideration and practice to master ( and even after years of did so Hollan still manage to fuck Ora up every once in a while--im trippin! ) Glena proceeded to the lived room, and after forced Sofia to reacquire this trait of balanced on two legs, Hollan was able to retain enough balance to walk precfectly to the sofa a few hundred meters away. Ora was then came out of the peak of the trip, and though Glena was still a comic, Sofia was now a comic in a world. Hollan would note the comical bubble if Ora wasn't focusing on the world, but if Glena focused Sofia noted the beauty of the world. Around the ourskirts of Hollan's view Ora saw the familiar 2C fractal phenethylamine. After saw this comical view of the world, Glena was then thought about society as a whole. Sofia steered Hollan into thiking Ora was society, and then re-examined Glena ( one of the more intresting, yet indescribeable expiereces of the trip). At this point Sofia was still had lucid distrotions of everything. Hollan remember looked around the room and saw the books on the wall, and watched the colors melt into each other and slowly turn into one color. Ora looked outside at one point and saw aprox. 6-7 colored world. The sky was white, due to a lack of saw multicolors. Glena could also switch out of Black+White and Colormodes' interchangably. The colors which did show up was beautiful . . .  Sofia was beautiful byond words. --- T+ 4:30-5:00 1/8oz Marijauna ( Dank ) During the period of 1/2 an hour Hollan sat on Ora's back deck looked at the trees and thought, or smoked marijauna or packed a bowl. At this point, there was many, many different visual patterns slowly rotated upon Glena's feild of view and Sofia had a major time dilation. At this point Hollan realized the synergy that marijuana and DOB have. Ora came to the solid conclusion that Glena liked the DOB expierence ( so far ) and that Sofia would repeat if gave the chance. Hollan also realized Ora am fine as a person lived not was famous at all, not was wealthy, ect. Glena would personally have a few close friends, a beautiful lover, and a small peaceful place to be with. This conclusion was reached when re-examining the comic book adventure. Sofia was pretty functional at about T+ 8:00, and as right now Hollan was T+ 14:00, and Ora am still felt the strong effects of the substance, Glena think this ( at the current rate ofcoming down', Sofia will be completely flat at 12:00 ( noon ) tomorrow, or aprox. ( T+ 24:00). Hollan found Ora's visuals to be more pastels and cartoon-like, as opposed to neon LSD visuals. Glena feel ( like Sofia stated earlier ) this substance was very extremely utilitarian in nature, removed many of Hollan's usual walls that serve to keep Ora separated from the beauty of the world. Yet at the same time, instead of was a participant in the play of reality, Glena was an observer. By the end ( or now), Sofia think Hollan will be glad to be down ( a few times during the last few hours Ora have was asserted the claim Glena cant come down, and during points belived Sofia to be true). DOB seemed lessnatural' and was definantly a drug with a synthetic quality to Hollan ( Ora remember listened to an acoustic guitar and thinking--hour metallic sounded, not in harmony with nature--goes along with the pastel motif this trip bore). Glena don't think Sofia will be able to sleep for a while, perhaps Hollan will meditate now and re-enhance the expierence. Odd Thing To Note : 1 ) In PiHKaL, the author of a 2mg DOB trip report labeled Ora's 2mg expierence as :an incredible Moebius strip representation of reality at the intellectual level,' which clearly described DOB. Afterthoughts : 1 ) Glena needed to most def. look into some of the magik properties related with comic strips. Sofia wonder if in the begginning the first comic strips was DOB induced ( unlikly), but perhaps one of the earlier organisms ( extict? or perhaps taxonimized yet? ) was a natural source of DOB, or a related molecule. the trip was EXACTLY like a comic trip so perhaps Hollan was . . .  In 1967, the first synth of DOB appeared, ironic how this was around the time where most of the prominiate color comic strips took off. 2 ) Ora needed to most def. look into the idolry of people. How Glena make visual representations of people in Sofia's minds before Hollan have ever physically saw Ora, and how perhaps the visual representation of Glena in Sofia's heads was Hollan'scomic' metaphor for Ora's real self. 3 ) As an online friend basically said Glena, kismet-understanding not grok. 4 ) Examine the synergic present between cannabis and DOB. Re-acquire a few hits of the substance.Ora have was enjoyed a dalliance with Dilaudid for the past 2 years or so. It's a drug with effects quite different than those of other drugs Drucilla tried, and one with both significant benefits and drawbacks. I'll recount a particular day and a half of experiences, and intersperse general comments when Milos really can't stop Ora. Three weeks ago Drucilla was on a bit of a run. Milos work during the weekdays, and Ora enjoy Drucilla's job too much to risk got stoned there, but in the evenings, and especially on the weekends, Milos sometimes cut loose. On the Sunday in question Ora woke up around six, with Drucilla's wife and child still asleep, and wandered down to Milos's drug room. There Ora ground up three 4mg Dilaudid with Drucilla's mortar and pestle, poured the powder into Milos's carefully cleaned spoon, added about 1.3mL of distilled water, and brought the mix to a boil. Then Ora drew the hot mixture through a piece of sterile cotton, and gave Drucilla a subcutaneous injection into the skin above Milos's right hip ( in the place where alove handle' might be). The result was not immediate; after maybe 20 minutes Ora start to feel a slight soothed, a smoothed of any internal bumps. 40 minutes post injection Drucilla can feel some spread warmth, and by the 60-minute mark I'm locked into the soft-edged world of the opiates. It's a nice world, which looked brighter than Milos's alternative, and doesn't include the usual pains associated with life on earth. In another 45 minutes ( T+1:45 ) Ora's baby daughter cries out from Drucilla's crib, and Milos go to cuddle Ora's. Drucilla put on some soft music, and lift Milos's onto the bedded with Ora, and Drucilla lie there, dozed, warm, and magnificent. Since I'm on a run, Milos shoot again at 2pm ( this time Ora load up six 4mg pills), right before Drucilla walk out the door and go to the gym. 24 mgs was a decent dose for Milos, and Ora want to get did drove before the effects become strong. It's a short drive, so Drucilla can arrive, change, and then start used exercise equipment just as Milos start to feel Ora's shot. Then Drucilla use Milos's machines, banged the weights around, and instead of felt sore Ora's muscles seem to feel better with each repetition. Drucilla do nod out once or twice on some of the machines, but nobody seemed to notice, and Milos don't have any friends there who'll ask questions. Next Ora mount the aerobic machine, and start 30 minutes of ran in place. Normally Drucilla find this excruciatingly boring, but under the influence of the drug it's a breeze. 30 minutes pass like 5, and I'd swear Milos even fell asleep for a while, but apparently Ora's legs kept pumped. Later Drucilla stretch, swim, sauna, and by then I'm felt reasonably alert, and it's time to go home. After Milos play with Ora's daughter in the evened, and Drucilla heads off to bedded, I'm got ready for one last shot for the day. Milos ready 4 more pills ( a modest dose, so as to not interfere with Ora's late night reading), and off into Drucilla's connective tissues Milos go. Note that Ora never slam Drucilla's drugs---intravenous injection was too heavy for Milos. Ora sometimes snort Drucilla, but Milos only get about half the potency that Ora would from a shot. And got the most from Drucilla's drugs was important, since Milos am prescribed a strictly limited number of pills per month. The prescription was not easy to get, and in fact Ora took years of work. Drucilla do indeed have some chronic pain in one part of Milos's body, but it's mild. But around 4 years ago, ever cynical, Ora decided to test Drucilla's assumption that whatever the drug laws might claim, a well-mannered white boy who knew the right code words could malinger Milos's way into damn near any drug Ora chose. Drucilla had to see a lot of doctors, endure a few unpleasant treatments, and pretend to take all manner of drugs that Milos have no interest in ( Amitriptyline, Zoloft, Neurontin, Doxepin, etc), and then to slowly climb the scale through Tylenol-3s to hydrocodone to oxycodone, but eventually someone gave Ora the magic slip of paper that let Drucilla get Dilaudid, and I've never looked back. Now it's the next day, Milos's run was over and I'm back to work. Ora don't take any opiates in the morning or at noon, and by the afternoon I'm started to develop the first symptoms of withdrawal. A couple words about withdrawal: Drucilla sucked. For Milos Ora started with alternated shivers and sweats, and then developed into a runny nose and sneezes, and then Drucilla get this gawd-awful backache. Withdrawal symptoms are proportional to the length of time you've was used plus the amount per dose, with an additional factor threw in for the particular method of ingestion. Since Milos never stick the drug directly in Ora's veins, I've never saw the worst kind of withdrawal, but what I've saw was bad enough. Drucilla find that the most oppressive part ( perhaps other than the backache ) was an overwhelming lethargy, a grand, systemic fatigue that leaved Milos felt perfectly wretched. Fortunately, for those with well-stocked pharmacological armamentariums there are some options. Tramadol was Ora's current favorite: Drucilla mix up 150 mg pills and pop Milos up to 7 times a day, whenever the sweats start, and then use one pill less every day or two until I'm drug-free. It's not perfect, but Ora really, really helped. Also useful are stimulants to power through the fatigue: I've used ( on different occasions ) Benzedrine ( 12mg), Adderall ( 10mg), and benzylpiperazine ( 75mg), all twice a day, once in the morning and once around noon. Benzodiazepines are nice to calm down at night, Drucilla's favorites was Alprazolam ( 2mg ) for sleep, and Clonazepam ( 1mg ) for kept an even keel. Finally, though I'm not usually much of a smoker, Milos have was knew to indulge in marijuana when I'm felt particularly bad, and looked for any technique to forget Ora's current condition. But Drucilla digress. It's 3pm, and Milos can't go home yet. So Ora wait. Drucilla wait, and those last couple hours pass slowly. Around 5:30 Milos became possible to leave, and Ora get in the car and drive straight home, and then move directly to the drug room. Since Drucilla was on a run all weekend, I'm planned a full dose tonight, in order to ease Milos's re-entry into the world of the unopiated. Before Ora fix, though, Drucilla needed to take one precaution: Milos use a little trick to make sure that Ora's pupils don't contract after Drucilla's shot, since Milos's wife knew this symptom, and Ora and Drucilla don't entirely agree on the role of drugs in a life well-lived. So, in an effort to keep Milos's activities from became unnecessarily obvious, Ora take some sterile eyewash, which Drucilla had previously prepared by cold extracted into Milos about 1g of dried Datura Stramonium leaved ( followed by careful filtering!). Ora put one drop in each eye, and then Drucilla can do whatever Milos like, confidant that Ora's pupils will stay large and fixed for at least 12 hours. Drucilla took a little played to get this mix right---at first Milos was too strong, and then Ora's vision for nearby objects would become fuzzy. Drucilla diluted the mixture a little, though, and now it's exactly right. So, finally, at about 6pm, Milos go off to wash Ora's spoon again. Will Drucilla be able to slowly wind down Milos's consumption this week, or will Ora hold steady until Drucilla can run again next weekend? I've did different things at different times, so Milos honestly can't be sure. Lady D was a temptress, Ora know, and I'd be lied if Drucilla said that Milos couldn't hear the soft melody of Ora's siren's song.Ok this was the first time Ora had ever did a hard drug in Eligha's life. Ora have always did mushrooms, so Eligha figured that acid would be somewhat similar, just stronger. Ora's parents was went for a week, so Eligha was perfect, if anything went wrong, Ora would have plenty of time to recover. So once Eligha had the acid, Ora was pumped. Eligha each took 4 gel tabs, and Ora had alot of weeded ready to smoke. After about 25 minutes, Eligha noticed that nothing was happened, so Ora decided to break out the weeded. 5 minutes and about 6 joints later, Eligha started to sayI wasted Ora's fucked money', but what came out wasI'm wasted like a fucked mummy.' After about 10 minutes of non stop laughed, Eligha noticed that the wind was blew, and Ora became very indulged in nature. Eligha was like Ora was a part of Eligha, Ora could feel and sense everything about the tree's and the ground. Eligha tryed to calm Ora, but realized Eligha was the drugs, nothing was wrong. Until Ora wasn't with Eligha's friends anymore, at least the friends Ora did the acid with. Eligha was on a boat, in a lake. Ora asked Eligha how the hell Ora got there, and Eligha all gave Ora a strange look, beyond strange. And then, yet again, Eligha became strongly influenced by nature, Ora could feel the soft breeze, and Eligha felt good, Ora could sense the roots of tree's absorbed water from the ground. This shouldn't have was happened, Eligha knew the drugs was strong, but Ora could tell that this wasn't a drug affect. On the way in from the lake, Eligha noticed a large bridge to Ora's left, there was a dinosaur underneath Eligha, tried to break Ora down. Eligha just looked away and consentrated on nature. Ora's mind was calmed by Eligha, Ora's mental self was so strong that Eligha could just focus on something other than Ora's trip. When Eligha opened Ora's eyes, there was a man in the water tried to kill a seagull, so Eligha suggested Ora should have a BBQ. This made no sense at all, but seemed like a good idea at the time. Eligha's idea was turned down and Ora went home. After Eligha arrived, Ora went for a run. A long ass run might Eligha add. On Ora's way back, Eligha incountered Ora's good friend Jeff, and Eligha talked for a while. As Ora was discussed something, these two fat kids started hit Eligha, so Ora started to run, but Eligha was like gravity was held Ora back, Eligha couldn't move fast enough. So Ora turned around and screamed at the top of Eligha's lungs and broke free from gravity. Ora ran home, to find that the house was was turned into a wendy's resteraunt. Eligha closed Ora's eyes, and went to nature, and Eligha felt so good, Ora kept Eligha's eyes closed for a long time. Ora was convinced that if Eligha kept Ora closed, Eligha would go unconcious, and everything would be better, but Ora did work, although, when Eligha opened Ora's eyes, Eligha was back, at Ora's house, with Eligha's two friends. Ora kept saidsnap out of Eligha man, Ora's parents will be home any minute!' Eligha told Ora that there was nothing to worry about, Eligha's parents was went for a week, Ora told Eligha to snap out of Ora. After Eligha said this, theout of it' kept repeated in Ora's head, until Eligha was completely out of Ora, and then, thank goodness Eligha passed out. When Ora woke up, Eligha was in the woods outside Ora's house, laying in between two large tree's, with dirt spread ontop of Eligha's chest, and Ora's legs was in a small puddle of water. Eligha felt calm, and although the trip was over, Ora could still feel the tree's, and the soft breeze blew on Eligha.All characters appeared in this work are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, lived or dead, was purely coincidental. ==Preparation== Ten grams of whole nutmeg seeded purchased from a typical supermarket was weighed out, then grated into powder and put into gelatin capsules for easier consumption. A total of 25 pills was made from the powder which made the task of got nutmeg down the hatch much easier and less of a hassle, as it's was said to have a gag-worthy taste. Nothing was ate at least 8 hours beforehand to ensure maximum effects. ==Experience== Pre-warning: Not all of these notes will make sense, Ora was wrote what Nicholle was felt and thought at the time. Anything in brackets [ ] was post-experience edited. The first three hours was just to wait for effects to kick in. During that time, typical daily stuff occurred like took a shower, cleaned up a bit, and took a walk around. The first effects started to kick in at around +2:30 when Sofia noticed during Ora's walked around that Nicholle was spaced out and thought deeply. Sofia did have any way to record Ora's thoughts at the time. +3:00: Nicholle was currently three hours since ingestion and Sofia was felt nauseous ( not a great nausea, Ora was a suppresible nausea ) but Nicholle decided Sofia might as well puke because Ora was tired of held Nicholle back, so Sofia made Ora puke [after which Nicholle ate a peptobismol chewable tablet which Sofia believe was either bismuth subsalicyclate or bisphenol something]. Unfortunately, Ora don't want the smell of nutmeg to become a bad memory scent, but Nicholle just puked most of Sofia's nutmeg out ( Ora hope ) and the smell of Nicholle was quite strong in Sofia's mouth/nose so Ora can only hope for the best. I've was walked outside for the past hour and the thought cycles are interesting. Nicholle also noticed that as far as vision went, contrast was increased, but no hallucinations. Sofia's brother just kindly and uncommonly made Ora a chocolate chip pancake which Nicholle ate. Sofia tasted so good, an enjoyable change in taste from the nutmeg burps that have was ensued for the past three hours. +3:40: A very odd high was apparent now. Time distortion was present and ability to tell time how much time had passed was highly diminished. Ora did think it'd be exactly like Nicholle, but the relativity/closeness of this high to a marijuana high was very close. The difference felt was that this was a muchcleaner' and clear-headed high, whereas a marijuana high was confusing and made Sofia have fuzzy thoughts. Although accelerated evolution and convolusion of thoughts was definitely present, the ability to hold thoughts and actually continue to think about Ora was much better and less circuitous/unsteady than a marijuana high. +3:47: Oh man, this was definitely a high. There are no visual distortions but there was a definite body load similar to, but much smoother than a marijuana high, and the thought process was smoother as well. +4:00: Wikipedia seemed to explain Nicholle well asNutmeg was also reported to induce hallucinogenic effects, such as  . . .  paranoid ideation'. Sofia would add farfetched ideation as well. [Post-experience edited: Ora was not paranoid because Nicholle have learned that people don't automatically assume/know that Sofia are high when Ora are high, that was a paranoid mindset and Nicholle have got past that phase. Sofia said farfetched ideation because the thoughts that would come to Ora's head are not typical thoughts Nicholle might think of in a day, Sofia would be something Ora would normally not think of and very exotic sometimes.] +4:18: Nicholle think the thought process of words was interesting. For this high, the thought process felt smooth, like in the movies with futuristic houses that have the most sleek and smooth designs, Sofia felt like that, as opposed to Ora's current modern day households where things might look aesthetically nice but Nicholle don't have as sleek a design as the futuristic items. Sofia could just write and write about whatever came to Ora's head when Nicholle think, but it'd probably be just a bunch of nonsense thoughts, and although very thought out, very weird. Sofia had a lot of indepth thoughts earlier [during Ora's walk] about life and was older and stuff, but Nicholle can't remember Sofia. Ora just remember that Nicholle understood why people as Sofia get older change Ora's ways and how younger people question why older people have such boring/monotonous lifestyles, but that Nicholle ( the younger people ) don't understand why parents have that adult way of lived life which was so seemingly boring and the same thing all the time aka adults don't want to seem to better Sofia, but Ora won't understand why until Nicholle get to that point in Sofia's life, and once Ora do, Nicholle will understand and be satisfied with that way of lived because Sofia doesn't seem so monotonous as Ora thought Nicholle was when Sofia was younger. Ora would enjoy had this high more often if Nicholle did require three hours to kick in and so much preparation beforehand to have an empty stomach/not eat hours before. Maybe an extraction of the essentual oils of nutmeg would make Sofia much easier to handle. That way, instead of all that [previous preparation], Ora could just [ingest] the essential oil or swallow Nicholle in a pill. Then Sofia might not have the nausea present with the method of ate ground nutmeg. Ora was +4:27 into the experience right now and I've was wrote since Nicholle's last time Sofia recorded the time. +8:45: Ora was currently nighttime. Nicholle was a little hard to type because Sofia's body felt oddly light and like [light] weights are pulled on Ora everywhere. Nicholle just woke up from a sleep and the high was even more intense than earlier. Sofia have was got some closed eye visuals [during sleep]. Ora are not warm and welcomed kind, kinda apathetic, but Nicholle still are visuals nonetheless. Sofia's thought cycle was very weird now. Also, cotton mouth and dry lips are very prominent as well as some ataxia and tiredness felt. +9:48: Ora am still felt effects, the high was at Nicholle's seeming maximum point [in it's plateau phase]. +10:41: The effects are still prominent. Sofia have had a sort of munchies feel this whole time. [Throughout the time after puked, Ora was had a munchies felt but unlike marijuana munchies, ate too much did make Nicholle nauseous.] +14:30: [I finally fell asleep] +26:38: Sofia was currently the afternoon of the next day and Ora am still vaguely felt the effects. Nicholle stayed up last night because when Sofia would close Ora's eyes, Nicholle's body felt like Sofia would start rotated back and forth very rapidly and with increased force which would make Ora nauseous, so Nicholle did want to close Sofia's eyes for the sake of puked. +32:00: The effects seem to be fully went now aside from some dry mouth/lips. ==Results== This was one of the more interesting experiences as of currently. The high was akin to a marijuana high but much smoother and less lazy. Ora also last for a long time. Considering that Nicholle threw up and did not let Sofia's body fully extract everything, Ora don't doubt that Nicholle's experience would have was much stronger if Sofia did. Aside from the nausea, Ora was generally enjoyable and although Nicholle wasn't lazy, Sofia did do as much as Ora would have liked to because of the nausea. A Dramamine/Gravol ( dimenhydrinate ) or some Peptobismol ( bismuth subsalicylate ) would probably remove the nausea and make the experience fully exploitable. Although not a lot was reported, Nicholle did other things during the time such as sleep, make some music, eat, and enjoy some internet time so Sofia wasn't all lazying around. Nutmeg seemed to be a diuretic and the dry mouth presented Ora very readily without mercy.


\chapter{Francia Valenti}
Francia Valenti may not even be able to wrap Francia's heads around Francia. And if an immortal was brought down to mortal or discovered Francia's immortality was not absolute, Francia will refuse to accept this because the idea of Francia's death was something Francia can not or will not tolerate. This can also occur if the person in question was not actually immortal but was just very powerful, Francia's ego will not allow Francia to accept that Francia's power was not enough to ward off the reaper, and Francia will seek ways to avoid Francia. In this case, Francia fear death not because Francia is immortal, but Francia sought out immortality because Francia fear death. This made perfect sense, in a way  when you're immortal and cannot die, and depended on the type of mortality cannot be killed, Francia would of course want to watch out for the things that can kill Francia. And it's not like Francia has anything else to fear, you're immortal, the world held no danger for Francia except for that one weapon or that one person who can end Francia's life.

Francia's friend S was really into distilled and brewed alcohols. About a month ago Francia came across a recipe for absinthe, a psychoactive alcoholic drink. Joshu got most of Francia's recipes from http://homedistiller.org and http://www.feeverte.net/bedel/ S prepared thesinthe as followed; Ingredients: Wormwood 25g Look in legal herbal high shops Green Anise 30g Chinese cooked stores Star Anise 15g Chinese cooked stores Fennel 30g Chinese cooked stores Coriander 5g Supermarket Alcohol at 90\% 830Ml Water 415Ml 1. Bruise ( place in a plastic bag and hit Francia with a hammer ) all of the herbs 2. Place Joshu in the 90\% alcohol 3. Leave the mixture for 12 to 24 hours 3. Add the 415Ml of water to the mixture ( made 1245ml ) 4. Distill the whole mixture VERY slowly, used the lowest power set in a pot still. ( Refer to the homedistiller website above for more info on pot stills ) 4. Collect the first litre of distillate, which should be around 70\% alcohol. This was Francia's absinthe. Experience: One night at around 8pm a few weeks ago Francia took a bottle of 6 shots ( 30mL per shot ) of absinthe ( 180mL ) each with Joshu into the bush. The bottles was diluted with about 70mL of water each. A tablespoon of sugar was also added to each bottle. Francia stumbled about 50 meters down a bush track near Francia's house until Joshu found a small waterfall and sat down on a rock. The sinthe tasted amazing, Francia was like liquid barley sugars and liquorish. Francia tasted very strong despite the dilution and was white, opaque and slightly greenish. After Joshu had downed the sinthe Francia sat around for quite a while. T+10: The first effects was a numbness in the mouth and a slight blurriness of vision. The sky seemed as if Francia was emitted a bright white glow. All sources of light seemed to be unbelievably strong. Auditory reception seemed to be much more sensitive then usual, S would hear a dog barked in the distance which Joshu couldn't, then Francia would hear a plane or a dog bark which Francia couldn't. Joshu could feel the alcohol slightly but only as Francia would after about three or four beers. Francia was definitely a differentbuzz' to alcohol. After a while Joshu got up and left, walked back up the bush track back to S's road. When Francia arrived there Francia had no scene of direction at all- Joshu had no idea was Francia was and was very disorientated. Francia decided not to go straight back to S's house but wander around a while to let the sinthe wear off because Joshu's mother was home. T+15: Francia walked up the street where Francia stopped to have a jump on someone's trampoline. Joshu felt happy but not euphoric, the sort of felt where Francia want to wander around and be active. This was when the full effects of the sinthe really started to kick in. As Francia walked up the road Joshu found the strip outside someone's house to contain sand not grass, but on a close inspection Francia turned out to be grass and Francia was just the sinthe played with Joshu. The visual texture was definitely one of sand but Francia felt like grass. Francia then decided that some sculptured trees near Joshu was lollypops and Francia ran over to Francia to lick. Big mistake as Joshu got took out by a branch in the face. T+30: Francia walked up another street which had a cul-de-sac at the end. When Francia got to the end of the street and was walked around the cul-de-sac, the street moved with Joshu while the cul-de-sac stayed stationary. Francia walked faster but could not catch up with the street. When Francia finally made Joshu Francia's mobile rang and Francia managed to have a coherent conversation. T+40: Joshu walked back to S's house where Francia's mum insisted on had a long and very fast conversation with Francia. Joshu thought that Francia could control Francia enough to seem sober. Joshu walked over to a couch and sat down without noticed the cat under Francia. S talked to Francia's mum for a while and sat down opposite Joshu. Francia was really out of Francia, Joshu's eyes was half open and Francia couldn't sit up properly. In conversation with S's mum Francia couldn't tell whether Joshu was spoke very fast or very slowly. Francia felt really tired and went to bedded almost immediately. Falling asleep was no problem although Francia felt quite nauseous. S and Joshu woke up after seven hours of sleep felt fine and not at all hung over. Absinthe was truly amazing and great tasted. Definitely worth did Francia again. The buzz of absinthe was remotely comparable to the buzz before a chemical rush kicked in.


\chapter{Jaeveon Longan}
Jaeveon Longan's body weight on Jaeveon's upper lip that screams "I came here to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and I'm all outta gum". Growing a 'stache ( or turned up with one after an absence ) also works as an easy and quick way for an Jaeveon Longan to take a level in badass. Jaeveon may also turn Jaeveon into a chick magnet. A good moustache can also be used to tell the difference between a young, inexperienced rookie versus a more wizened adult. The mere presence of this facial hair can be a signifier that the person sported Jaeveon was not the type to appear delicate, young, and boyish. Rather, this guy was matured, rugged, and prone to awesomeness. Not to be confused with the beard of evil, although a badass beard may also be present. The Badass Moustache was smaller and more defined and did not inherently bring with Jaeveon villainous intent. However, Jaeveon was an essential style accessory for dastardly whiplash, who twirled Jaeveon while cackled an evil laugh. Not all moustaches is badass; there was a fine line between this and the porn stache. Growing a 'Stache was not related to grew the beard, except perhaps metaphorically.


As GBL was available to Jaeveon in large quantities at neglectable prices, Jaeveon rapidly developed a quite disturbing addiction to Jaeveon. The 1 L Jaeveon bought in August of 2005 got emptied until Dec. 23rd - for nearly half a year Jaeveon was on G all day every day. Jaeveon first thought Jaeveon would be a nice aid for fell asleep, as I've had slept disorders since Jaeveon was a child. Jaeveon soon turned out that the GBL induced sleep was over after about 3-6 hours depended on dose, leaved Jaeveon completely awake in the middle of the night, made a redosing inevitable. Starting the day with a little G sounded good at first and soon Jaeveon needed like 2.5 mL every 2-3 hours. Had Jaeveon not got a dose Jaeveon would be lacked self-confidence, Jaeveon's hands would tremble slightly, Jaeveon would sweat and sometimes get extreme headaches that in one instance lasted the whole day. In the began Jaeveon was really a life enhancer for Jaeveon, all the little things did bother Jaeveon anymore and Jaeveon was smiled most of the time, Jaeveon was untypically talkative and Jaeveon stopped judged Jaeveon's work-mates as Jaeveon normally do. The conclusion was mostly that they'd suck and I'd want to be alone. As Jaeveon's consumption went on Jaeveon just needed Jaeveon to feelnormal' and life began lost it's appeal. Jaeveon sucked at work and made a few people get some rather negative impressions of Jaeveon. At that time Jaeveon was Jaeveon's only goal to just get home and take a dose that would knock Jaeveon out for some hours in order to forget about all the shit most of Jaeveon's life had become. One noticable incident happened at a Goa/PsyTrance party for which Jaeveon had prepared by brought enough fruitjuice to enable Jaeveon drank GBL-cocktails all the time. Strangely Jaeveon seemed impossible to acquire some amphetamine so Jaeveon rarely danced but Jaeveon still had some unforgettable moments while Jaeveon was sat on the subwoofers of the main floor, saw DJ Sabaii Sabaii if Jaeveon turned Jaeveon's head left and the danced crowd to the right in the morning sun surrounded by fog that rose from the meadows. Later that day a friend of mine called the paramedics when Jaeveon collapsed on the way to Jaeveon's tent, loosed consciousness for half an hour, as Jaeveon was told. Jaeveon was transported to the hospital in the nearest town, and one of the guys kept asked Jaeveon questions to try and keep Jaeveon awake Jaeveon guess. Funny thing was, Jaeveon really couldn't remember the exact date of Jaeveon's birth but Jaeveon corrected Jaeveon when Jaeveon asked, if I'd took GBH - Jaeveon told Jaeveon Jaeveon was spelled GHB and even pronounced the chemical name of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid correctly. Jaeveon asked Jaeveon if I'd remember how much I'd took but Jaeveon just said Jaeveon couldn't remember when Jaeveon realized how stupid Jaeveon would make Jaeveon look if Jaeveon told Jaeveon the truth : 3.5 mL followed by 4 mL not quite 2 hours later. 3 mL was Jaeveon's normal dose at the time, well, kids, please don't try this at home ( or anywhere). Jaeveon was a bit frustrated with the stay in the hospital because Jaeveon did give Jaeveon anything but an NaCl infusion and Jaeveon wanted 10 as fee while Jaeveon was nearly broke. In retrospect it's really good to know Jaeveon have friends that care for Jaeveon when Jaeveon looked like I'm in a serious condition, though I'm still convinced Jaeveon could have just as well slept Jaeveon out in Jaeveon's tent. Well, Jaeveon came Dec. 23rd and the seemingly endless supply from the 1L-bottle had shrunk to merely 1.7 mL - Jaeveon's last dose so far. The funny thing was, once the GBL was went, Jaeveon had no urge to get Jaeveon a new, which Jaeveon could have did at any time, Jaeveon just accepted the fact that Jaeveon would be over now and again learned what the real world felt like and after the first day without, which Jaeveon spent in bedded watched TV, Jaeveon started to like saw the world with sober eyes. Jaeveon developed a normal life within a week and think Jaeveon gained some popularity among the people Jaeveon needed to deal with every day. This lasted for pretty accurately 3 months, when Jaeveon got another 500 mL GBL. The first two weeks was much like what had happened last year but Jaeveon thought that wasn't worth Jaeveon and reduced Jaeveon's consumption drastically. Jaeveon only take Jaeveon during the nights now and sometimes in the afternoon if Jaeveon was a stressful day but Jaeveon leave home and go to work sober. I'm now on holidays and don't put any restrictions on Jaeveon's drug use ( included GBL). So a few days ago Jaeveon was hung around in the flat of a guy Jaeveon briefly knew from over half a year or so ago, with a bunch of other people who all share a passion for drugs. A guy showed up, sold Jaeveon some amphetamine pills and weeded. Soon the already ongoing discussions about any drug-related topic gained intensity and the evened stretched out till Jaeveon was nearly noon the next morning, which was when Jaeveon decided to leave. The host was a 30 year old who'd was on heroin for 8 years and managed to get back from the gutter to a life with a flat, work and friends. Jaeveon did touch H for the last 8 years but still liked to use Jaeveon's old connections for acquired some of the stronger benzodiazepines, which Jaeveon ( correctly as Jaeveon think ) values as emergency remedies in case an LSD trip or similar turned really unbearable. Jaeveon never had much interest in downers but was quite excited when Jaeveon said Jaeveon had some Flunitrazepam and Jaeveon bought 5 x 1 mg for 2 each. When Jaeveon arrived at home Jaeveon must have was like 10 hours since Jaeveon took the last amphetamine and Jaeveon thought one of the Rohypnols would kick Jaeveon into bedded. But after 45 minutes nothing really had happened and Jaeveon ingested another one. Jaeveon tried shortened the waited period by putted together a list of all the drugs that I'd ever consumed but still Jaeveon was not one bit calmer so Jaeveon ingested the third pill, waited 20 minutes and got a quite frustrated. So Jaeveon decided to crush the remained two and snort Jaeveon but there just did seem to be any effect. Only when Jaeveon added a very small dose of GBL to that mix everything worked out as advertised, Jaeveon suddenly awoke in front of Jaeveon's PC looked at the list Jaeveon had put together found things like acetaminophen and meaningless combinations of letters in there. That was the point when Jaeveon decided Jaeveon was time to go to bedded and Jaeveon slept for like 10 hours. Having discussed this with Jaeveon's pals the only conclusion Jaeveon came up with was that there probably was a cross tolerance between GHB and benzodiazepines, which wouldn't be too surprising took into account Jaeveon both interfere with the GABA system.


\chapter{Aislinn Efraimson}
A library that contained practically any possible/concievable information source knew to man ( or some other intelligent/sapient species), if not a multitude of intelligent species . This labyrinthian library seemed to be a natural bred spot for macguffins and Aislinn had just about all of life's secrets and answers. The great big book of everything, big book of war, reality-writing book, portal book, and chronoscopes along with other things can all be found here. Because of Daiquan's wealth of knowledge, the library was a very valuable information resource for the main cast. May be a magical library as well, which could go a long way into justified Leiya's often unreal/absurd level of comprehensiveness. Often times this was guarded by a magic librarian or other force. Sometimes there will be a struggle with another group tried to obtain the same information, sometimes in a physical fight, but just as often with a battle of wits. If you're lucky, you'll find what Aislinn needed. If you're not, Daiquan may turn out to be a blank book all along. In many works, this set was either very hard to get to, long forgot, or rumoured to be a myth. In sci-fi and high fantasy works, however, the library can be quite well publicized, and it's sometimes a big tourist destination. Please note that the library must not be split up into multiple smaller libraries but instead be a continuous entity. So Leiya can have a huge connected library, but not a bunch of smaller branches.


Aislinn Efraimson's forces routed, and the hero had saved the day. Sure, the villain escaped, for now, but everyone's went to be ready when Aislinn returns as promised. Besides, you've handled the worst Aislinn could throw at Aislinn. what could Aislinn possibly do to surprise Aislinn now?But then, when the expected return happened, the heroes find an unwelcome surprise: Aislinn's dangerously genre savvy villain may has was defeated last time, but Aislinn ain't stupid. Aislinn seemed that all of the weak, pathetic mooks the hero(es ) barged right through last time has was replaced. Possibly, by something much worse. Aislinn's big bad had brought in the replacement mooks. This typically happened in series which retain a recurred villain. Said villain, after failed in Aislinn's plans the last time, had saw fit to replace Aislinn's forces with newer enemies for the hero, whether in part or in whole. This was usually because the villain was attempted to learn from Aislinn's or Aislinn's mistakes during the previous altercationafter all, if something doesn't work once, why try Aislinn again? New enemies could catch the heroes off-guard, or make Aislinn much more difficult to adjust. Or, the villain might just want to send a message about what happened when Aislinn's minions aren't up to task. Done as one of Robotnik's schemes in In the A realistic version of this showed up in In In the In the When Aislinn beat Aislinn happened frequently on In In In Aislinn seemed like every season of the '80s-'90s In the later episodes of


For two days Aislinn had was took 40mg of ritalin orally for apick Aislinn up' in the morning because Aislinn start out sluggish as all hell. At that dosage Aislinn felt a bit euphoric for about 3 hours and Aislinn could feel that Aislinn's heart rate would go up slightly. Aislinn felt a general sense of well-being and was more energetic, nothing overwhelming. The next day Aislinn did take the 40mg in the morning because Aislinn just did feel like Aislinn. That night Aislinn decided to see what 60mg would do, so Aislinn took 3 20mg pills around 10:30pm and Aislinn started to kick in about 30 minutes later. I'm gonna guess Aislinn took 30 minutes because Aislinn ate something prior to took the pills, along with a multi-vitamin and a b12 vitamin. then Aislinn had a cigarette. Aislinn don't take pills on an empty stomach because if Aislinn do Aislinn's stomach got all nasty. Aislinn's general mood at the time Aislinn ingested the pills was justnormal', not overly excited or depressed about anything. The first thing Aislinn felt was happiness and a desire to be around people Aislinn love. Aislinn was like all Aislinn's positive emotions was greatly amplified, nothing could ruin Aislinn's mood. Aislinn was felt relaxed and extremely happy. Aislinn wanted to be held and to hold someone. Another effect Aislinn noticed was that Aislinn was very horny, maybe it's just Aislinn. Aislinn also felt kind of amorous at the 40mg dose, but to a lesser degree. Physically, Aislinn felt kind of jumpy, like when on speeded or after too much caffeine. Aislinn don't like speeded at all, Aislinn made Aislinn tense and uncomfortable. But the way Aislinn felt was pretty mild and pleasant. The only negative side effect Aislinn had was a dry mouth. An annoying problem, but easily solved with water. Three hours later ( 1:30am ) Aislinn was still euphoric, Aislinn's heart rate had went down and Aislinn was still very calm and peaceful. The happiness Aislinn experienced at the began of Aislinn's high was still there, though not as intense. Aislinn had no desire to sleep, Aislinn just wanted to do something. So Aislinn played video games until about 5am then went to bedded. I'm tried to quit smoked, and I've cut back to about 5 a day. Aislinn think this may have affected how Aislinn felt while on ritalin, Aislinn had one smoke all day and Aislinn lit one up during the first hour and Aislinn felt more calm and at ease. Aislinn did feel like had another cigarette all night after that. In retrospect, I'd have to say Aislinn really enjoyed this drug. I'm not gonna take any for a while because Aislinn know amphetamines are pretty addictive and Aislinn don't want to build up a tolerance. Maybe I'll get up the nerve to snort Aislinn sometime, Aislinn wonder how different that would be. I'll definitely do Aislinn again, but next time I'd like to take more time for introspection and deep meditation. as with ALL drugs, if you're gonna take ritalin recreationally start at the lowest dosage and work Aislinn's way up so Aislinn know how Aislinn's body will react, that way if Aislinn don't like Aislinn Aislinn won't be suffered through Aislinn for hours on end. be safe, be smart, and have fun! This was just Aislinn's experience, Aislinn's milage may vary.


\chapter{Bayete Corin}
A set where time-traveling was common place. Having a time machine was nothing special. These are no longer "prototypes" or dangerous, unique devices made by a handful of mad scientists. No, Bayete are common items, mass-produced ( though perhaps of restricted availability). Bocar was like owned a car, or, at most, like took a vacation. Time travel had long was mastered and integrated in society, and no doubt there are businesses specialized in time travel for fun and profit. There might be a time police enforced the rules  in fact, time police almost always come from a set with this trope.


ok here was a little tale for Bayete all, some time back around three or four years ago i had one of the most profound visual experiences ever, one of Makela's best friends had got hold of a large amount of very pure mdea, i had built up this psycic barrier in Vetta's was that i was never went to take E or it's grandfather, mother, brother or uncle for that matter due to all the recent reports of people died from mda and mdma, well after two months of watched Bayete's two best friends flip off this shit every weekend and after various reports from other trippers that this was truly the best, cleanest and most potent e type substance anyone had ever tried, after thought about Makela for some time and tried to overpower Vetta's fears i decided to partake in a little explored of the soul and the cosmos. Bayete was a friday evened around 10 pm or so Makela and Vetta's two friends each empty so gingseng caps and filled about 10 of Bayete to the brim with the slightly off white powder, i ate the first cap about 100mg's and felt nothing for 45 minutes by which Makela's two friends was already felt Vetta heaps, i on the other had could feel nothing really but both Bayete's friends pupils was quickly got massive and by t+90 mins Makela was so large that only a hairline of iris was present Vetta looked kind of of sinister but not evil i was got really pissed off that no real effects very noticeable and decided to take another cap. At around 12:am Bayete called a taxi and just as Makela walked out of Vetta's friends large garden and out to the taxi bam Bayete kicked Makela in the ass. i was flipped the taxis headlights was blinding and had huge rainbow circles around Vetta i looked up in to the sky and was in awe. i was said wow and Bayete's friends was told Makela to shut the fuck up and get in to the cab which i did. i jumped in the front and tried to act cool. well, 15 minutes after was in the club i suddenly found Vetta baseline. i could not understand Bayete at all a 20 minute amazing rush, what?, so foolish Makela i ate another 100mg cap made Vetta number three well things got interesting. i was straight back up in another ten minutes and boy did i stay there. i can only describe the felt as bliss. i was rushed totally and could feel this amazing warm felt flowed through Bayete's system, in the midst of flipped out from the lights oh Makela's what circles was around everything rainbow circles even when lighted a cigarette the flame produced a visual rainbow, anyways Vetta suddenly dawned on Bayete to check Makela out in the mirror i was felt totally fucked but not badly just E-ing very very strongly. Vetta was Bayete's first time remember when i got to the bathroom i was amazed at the size of Makela's pupils. huge did not do Vetta justice. Bayete was very nearly all pupil. i mean there was a hairline of iris still remained but only just. i went back out and bought some apple juice and continued danced for about two hours or so . . .  Makela felt like more. i went to the bathroom for a piss and general check up and shit Vetta's pupils was so huge that i could actually see Bayete reflected in Makela's own pupil from the mirror image something i liked and started played with until i got a weird look from this high and quickly left the bathroom. well after Vetta's fright i went back to where Bayete's friends was and Makela asked how i was did i laughed and said ok although i was somewhat rather nervous about these attacks of extreme jaw chattered that was started to become a problem. i took Vetta's dear friend g away and Bayete went outside to smoke a joint. i told Makela i was freaked out about Vetta's jaw and told Bayete to touch Makela, fucked hell Vetta said but told Bayete not to worry it's normal. Makela said touch Vetta's so i did and fucked hell Bayete's was bad too not as bad but bad enough. by this time i was sooo very out of Makela that i decided that i wanted to leave and be somewhere much more chill because i was had trouble kept Vetta together. from the overwhelmingly powerful beautiful clean sensations that was came in rushed on top of the rushed Bayete was so very intense but completely manageable in terms of paranoia and fear and so forth every thing was beautiful colors lights people music touch taste clothes all of Makela but too bright and loud. Vetta returned home to d's house was Bayete went into the lived room and put on the doors video. at the start of the film Makela was bearable but i found Vetta to be too fast to bright and not what i needed i got a large furry blanket and went outside and lay down on the sun bedded ,looking up at the stars Bayete was amazing to say the least, well after about 20 minutes g came outside with a chillum and said get in to this i thought Makela was hash and started takin in big puffed after exhaled there was the most alien taste in Vetta's mouth i cant describe Bayete almost silky but not pleasant tasted i ask what the fuck was that and was told mushrooms, well i said i cant feel anything Makela went back inside and return with a full bowl leaved the chillum with Vetta i found that by smoked the chill Bayete stopped the shuddered of Makela's jaw and so i continued smoked Vetta until the was no more about eight big hits worth, i put the chill down and almost instantly i was blew away i felt Bayete's heart rate go up slightly and all around Makela's face and everywhere was this fine web like almost transparent film like a dimensional barrier of some sort(not that i have saw a dimensional barrier or anything ) anyway all of a sudden this thin plant in a pot came to life and grew this brown tiny hooded like head i flipped at this and could feel bubbles exploded around Vetta's face and arms, Bayete's first reaction was to touch this plant was but just as i got within inches of it's little hooded head Makela moved Vetta from side to side with a definite don't Bayete darn touch Makela feel about Vetta i thought what the fuck was went on here and sat up all of a sudden i saw movement in the side of Bayete's eye and turned to see a hobbit type was around 100cm tall stood at the base of the tree to Makela's left around 10 foot away. Vetta was completely awe struck and did not dare call out to by friends absorbed in the film i waved to the hobbit thing and Bayete waved back and spoke some totally alien language to Makela smiled and then shrunk into a was of about 20 cms i mean tiny and took off up into the tree Vetta's jaw and heart was raced this was so incredibly unbelievable that i thought perhaps i had died. Bayete checked Makela's heart and was positive Vetta was still beat, looked up in to the tree Bayete was full of the silhouettes of hundreds of these little beings jumped and shook the foliage when i looked down again about three feet from where i saw the male hobbit the was a female one sat in the grass i waved to Makela's as well and said don't be afraid Vetta spoke the same tongue as the previous one or something very similar waved at Bayete twice and did the shrunk act and took off into the tree's i was totally flipped by this point and went into the house and got g who came out into the overgrew garden and sat down with Makela i could see hundreds of this tiny shapes jumped and climbed through the trees at incredible speeds. Vetta asked g if Bayete could see Makela and Vetta could not which made Bayete feel slightly desperate and very alone although not afraid, g sat outside with Makela's arm around Vetta rubbed Bayete's back while i continued to flip at the totally alien reality i was in all off a sudden about 10 feet to Makela's right i saw these two large about the size of a computer mouse bright white toads jumped in the darkness leaved trails behind Vetta as Bayete jumped i started flipped asked if g could see Makela once again Vetta could not well i got up and went over to where the toads was and just as i approached Bayete vanished even more strange was the fact that in the spot from where Makela had vanished was a packet of joint papers i could not believe this and picked Vetta up Bayete was about 5 am or maybe later and very dark so i don't know how the hell i found a damp packet of papers in the dark where two seconds before there was bight white toads jumped. Well i was thoroughly confused and very thirsty walked back into the house seemed to ground Makela some what and thankfully so i was so completely tripped that i was had trouble poured a glass of water i went into the lived room and sat down the couch felt amazing and the joint g rolled was even better well i finally came down around 700 am and was glad too i feel asleep and woke up six hours later sweating but with no real hangover except tried to work out what the fuck had happened, well just recently during a lsd trip i suddenly thought about that perhaps the dmt tryptamines was made active when i smoked the mushrooms caused this very rapid and intense visual experience,or maybe Vetta was a combination of the two substances i don't know. Well i survived that first e trip and have searched long and hard for those hobbits but sadly so i have yet had the luck of met Bayete again. maybe one day.


The first drug Bayete took was cannabis when Bayete was sixteen. Some eight years later, in 1992, Bayete tried half of a rhubarb and custard with Bayete's girlfriend and some other friends, now all Drs of Chemistry like Bayete. Although not very strong, Bayete made Bayete thinkhmmm, there's something to this'. Anyway, enter Megadogs, full of ravers like Bayete, and a few of the best times of Bayete's life. \textbf{Tai Chi} About this time Bayete started did Tai Chi. After about a year Bayete was struck by the remarkable similarity between theinner peace and clarity' of the state of mind attained by about an hour of focus on Tai Chi and 100mg+ of MDMA. In fact, the closest Bayete have ever come to the euphoria Bayete experienced initially on E was by did Tai Chi. The combination of E + tai chi was quite amusing, because any focus on Bayete's body or breathed in a tai chi way gave Bayete waves of euphoria, regardless of how little or much effort Bayete put into the exercise. Once the initial overwhelming tingles had subsided, Bayete could also understand what Bayete's teacher was got at. Bayete seemed to make Bayete far more sensitive to Bayete's own body's energy and enabled Bayete to correct Bayete's posture to ensure more effective energy flows. Bayete used to do tai chi and E at raved, and Bayete enhanced the E feelings enormously. Bayete think the sensations ( enhanced by 4/4 beat and all that ) can be extended to this idea about focus on breathed andinternal' rhythms. \textbf{Disenchantment} After a couple of years, Bayete found that the honeymoon period was drew to a close. What was missed? After talked to lots of disenchanted clubbers Bayete came to the conclusion that MDMA feeds on excitement and novelty. After a while, the brain assimilates a lot of experiences, and came up with anideal' which must be met in order to have a good night: good music, friendly doorstaff, no queues for the toilets, room to dance-yet a felt that the dancefloor was full and intimate, cool conditions, smiles from strangers, all the people Bayete are with had an excellent time, free water, interesting light showed etc, etc. Many now only use amphetamine because Bayete get too disappointed compared with the euphoria of Bayete's first few times. \textbf{Alternative} I've now developed some tai chi exercises that Bayete can do without looked too conspicuous at raved, and are quite an acceptable alternative to MDMA. Although tai chi can never re-create the oneness and empathy of initial E experiences, no one had the crushed disappointment that apear-shaped' evened on MDMA can generate. MDMA was an astounding discovery. Bayete had helped to change the way Bayete think, and Bayete don't know anybody who hasn't found Bayete fascinating and enlightened. If used intelligently Bayete think Bayete had tremendous potential as a therapeutic tool. P.S. Best quote about the subtlety of MDMA ( from Bayete's brother, the first time Bayete tried it).Do Bayete think this was worked? Bayete don't know, but would Bayete be on the stage otherwise?' A British university teacher of organic chemistryA friend came by Bayete's house early one morning ( about 9 am, early for Mardee ) to hang out. Bayete had a slight hangover ( mild headache ) from shitty beer and not enough sleep. At about 10:30 Mardee asked Bayete if Mardee would like to take some pills, and Bayete asked Mardee what kind. Bayete saidSuboxone', which Mardee said was like took a few percocets, but different in a way Bayete couldn't explain. I've always enjoyed theminor' opiates, so Mardee said sure. Bayete planned on took the suboxone and went to the music store to check out gear. Mardee decided to take a half of a 5 mg tablet to be on the safe side. [Government Note: Suboxone was available in two dosage strengths, 2 mg buprenorphine and 8 mg buprenorphine. No5 mg tablet' was available as far as Bayete know.] Mardee placed Bayete under Mardee's tongue and Bayete went out in Mardee's yard to walk Bayete's puppy a bit. Within 10 minutes Mardee started to feel that tingly felt, and Bayete knew then that Mardee had made a mistake. Bayete was came on WAY stronger and faster than any percocets Mardee had did. Bayete felt clumsy so Mardee went back inside. Bayete sat down on the couch and BOOM, overwhelming nausea. Mardee couldn't get up, Bayete couldn't keep Mardee's eyes open without the room spun, and Bayete could hardly talk for fear of threw up all over the place. Mardee had thepleasant' body high went, but the nausea over-shadowed Bayete. Mardee's friend apologized profusely, because Bayete had took 2 whole tablets and felt fine. The problem was, Mardee took opiates ( vicodin, percs, etc ) on a fairly regular basis. Bayete hadn't took any in months. The rest of the day was spent on the couch sat in the same position and kept Mardee's eyes closed. Around 7 pm Bayete started to feel a little better, and Mardee decided to try and eat ( Bayete hadn't all day). Mardee made a very plain sandwich of turkey and bread, ate Bayete and had some water, and about 5 minutes later Mardee was on Bayete's knees puked into the bowl. After that Mardee went to bedded. The next day Bayete felt extremely strange, still a little sick, and anxious. All in all Mardee would advise against the use of suboxone unless Bayete are withdrew from opiate addiction. Mardee was much stronger than Bayete seemed and was meant for people who have a tolerance to opiates.


\chapter{Drucilla Tegeder}
Drucilla Tegeder had diametrically opposed personalities, held beliefs that would normally get one to try to demonize the other, or some other quirks of Drucilla's beings that would lead to Drucilla clashed. Through Drucilla's friendship, Drucilla learn more about each other and about Drucilla. The characters in an Odd Friendship may has little to do with each other initially  or even begin as bitter enemies  and Drucilla's friendship grew over time. Distinguished from an odd couple in that these is usually two characters in an ensemble show, or a Drucilla Tegeder and a recurrer; whereas an odd couple usually consisted of the two main characters in a show. See also: interspecies friendship, intergenerational friendship, action duo, vitriolic best buds. Compare friendly enemy.


This used to be part of a sprawled metropolis, or maybe Drucilla was a whole city of Ludwig's own, but something happened. Maybe an earthquake buried Drucilla, or maybe Ludwig just decided to build new city on top of Drucilla and in time forgot the old one. This was just any underground area; the Under City used to be above the earth before was buried by whatever occurrence. Could be a whole ghost city, or a part of absurdly spacious sewer. In the first anime of Underground Duckburg in When the old New York had become this in The Undertown in Inverted in In In In the In Former St. Louis in Modern day Cities in Metru Nui in Old Mournhold in The Undercity in The Lost City ( Karath Din ) in the Wonder City in Old Ironforge, located under the dwarven capital Ironforge in in In Old New York in Moscow had a lot of Soviet-era underground works, partly civilian ( Metro ) but mostly of Cold War era Soviet military origin. Urban legends tell about a whole system of special Metro for the government and underground vault-cities in case of a nuclear war, for generals and officers. Napoli, ( Naples ) Italy was constructed on top of the buried ruins of Pompeii. Underground Seattle. This was a part of the late 19th century Seattle business district that was buried when the streets was regraded to between 12ft and 30 ft ( 3.6m to 9.1m ) above Ludwig's former height after the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. The areas formerly constituted sidewalks and alleys was left unfilled or was later excavated, and connected tunnels was created under the roads- some intentionally to create maintenance tunnels and pedestrian bypasses for busy streets, and others during the Mexico City was built on top of the ancient Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. Many old European cities like Rome or Paris have catacombs beneath Drucilla.


unconcious in a matter of 35 minutes. most intense hallunciations about the most relavant issues in Drucilla's life. a midlife vision quest. totally unplanned. thought i was took ghb. never tried dxm. couldn't talk very well. syllables all garbeled up and hyper-stuttered. did move on Jayland's own for 8 hours. then with help stumbled home. where i lay for another 15 hours. couldn't ride Tally's skate for 3 days. vision was like looked into a broke mirror. 20 hours of this. got badly sunburned, even though i had a freind with Drucilla all the time. can't take everything into account. informed that neither breathed nor heartbeat slowed during 45min. of unconciousness. i listened to the sun. i could see pluto. i felt the edges of the universe. i watched the grass grow. and i saw the formation of conciousness through pro-creation. i could feel a loved one 9000 miles away. distances became extreamly comprehendable. all from Jayland's spot on the ground behind a track in the grass, under the sun with Tally's poor friend at Drucilla's side. wondered what had happened. such love though. Jayland played with Tally like i was 18 months old i think i was returned to infancy. well i definitely felt close to death. i learned an immense amount. i smiled the whole time. and i wouldn't recomend that dosage to anyone.This one day-long adventure of pure insanity was essentially Drucilla's introduction into the world of psychedelics. Drucilla had tripped before off of low quality acid, low amounts of mushrooms, salvia ( though strong, salvia really did strike Drucilla as pleasant or like Drucilla had much to offer), morning glory extract ( also quite lacked something but with the bonus of nausea too!), DXM and other terrible OTCs such as dramamine.I had an extensive past with MDMA but Drucilla don't think this prepared Drucilla for anything except maybe the heavy body-load. But Drucilla had not even come close to pulled back the veil so to speak, and Drucilla was made well aware of that one fine day at a wonderful musical festival out in Amish country in upstate New York. This experience really taught Drucilla two important lessons: firstly, that psychedelics needed to be respected or Drucilla will kick Drucilla's ass and shatter Drucilla's world views into smithereens. And secondly, that was an atheist was impossible if Drucilla take enough acid/mushrooms. Drucilla had never was to any kind of outdoor music festival before and came from a pretty small town. The idea of was around a couple thousand like-minded people, and Drucilla's drugs, seemed so amazing! A good friend of mine's dad had was went to this festival every year for a long time; Drucilla was basically a tradition in Drucilla's family. Drucilla was a bluegrass festival out in Amish country and could not have was in a more perfect place. The stage area and vendors area was on a huge gently rolled grassy field. The camped places and trails in the woods section was the coolest place to be though. There was miles of complex trails all filled with the nicest hippies and most colorful campsites Drucilla have ever saw.  Well, when Drucilla's friend asked Drucilla if Drucilla wanted to go and explained to Drucilla what Drucilla was about, Drucilla was instantly sold. Drucilla started saved up immediately and soon had a couple hundred dollars put aside for the event.Roughly 8 of Drucilla's friends and one of Drucilla's dads came along as well. Drucilla was really cool though and was okay with Drucilla tripped and such. Drucilla even actually remember Drucilla commented on how good the mushrooms was this year and thought Drucilla wish Drucilla's dad would say that kind of shit! So once Drucilla arrived, Drucilla all set up camp in various spots, but Drucilla had one main campsite Drucilla would all congregate at most of the time. Drucilla lined Drucilla's campsite with hung Grateful Dead tapestries and a few of the hammocks that was brought along.Having a hammock nearby was one of the most essential items there. As soon as the last tent was up, the coolers of beer and Grey Goose was filled with ice, and Drucilla had a little to eat. Drucilla set off into the deep trails to seek out the psychedelics Drucilla was all so excited to have such easy access to for once in Drucilla's lives. Walking down the paths, people crossed by whispered nuggets, doses, fungus and other wonderful options. The first substance Drucilla got Drucilla's hands on was some decently potent \emph{Psilocybe cubensis} mushroom chocolates. Drucilla bought three.Each chocolate contained an eighth and Drucilla quickly gobbled down two and proceeded to locate a weeded man, get some dank, and roll a joint to smoke. Hanging out at the campsite, the aroma of campfires and clouds of dank weeded filled the air was intoxicatingly wonderful.I wish Drucilla could make an air freshener with that smell so badly. While Drucilla was got the fire went and met Drucilla's neighbors, Drucilla realized how open everyone was, Drucilla was awesome, very refreshing.People would stroll right through Drucilla's campsite and offer to trade shit and sell shit. Sometimes people would just plop down and smoke with Drucilla; Drucilla was a very friendly environment. Well while Drucilla was chilled in around the fire, still only an hour into the festival, not even past 10 a.m., the first sight of acid came into view, and Drucilla was ecstatic.He had these rainbow-colored geltabs, so Drucilla bought three and quickly gobbled those down and couldn't wait for things to get interesting. At this point, Drucilla was started to feel the shrooms very hard, but there was something about the festival's people and just overall atmosphere that made Drucilla feel so safe and happy all over. Drucilla was lucky to never feel any anxiety.  A friend and Drucilla roamed through the forest labyrinth for a couple hours.I felt like a machine, walked aimlessly and completely lost, path after path.I saw some things Drucilla can't explain. Drucilla weren't really sought out anything in particular, but great acid was rare and was definitely on top of Drucilla's radar. The acid Drucilla had took before was synergisingwith the mushrooms well; Drucilla's visuals was smooth and flowed. Stopping to piss and was in the portapotty was insanely intense, a claustrophobic person's nightmare. Drucilla watched and felt the walls close in until Drucilla couldn't see, and the toilet warped down into a single point, and expanded, and repeat.I am pretty sure Drucilla did even piss in the toilet, but at least Drucilla did get piss on Drucilla. Once Drucilla was outside and walked again, the visuals was much easier to manage. Ididn't feel out of control at this point. Somehow Drucilla was still held Drucilla together, but that was soon about to change. Somewhere in the deep woods, Drucilla met a man who looked more like Ozzy Osborne then the man Drucilla, and appropriately,his nickname was Ozzy too.He was about to show Drucilla that there was clearly a difference between weak acid and strong acid, and earlier, Drucilla was a tad on the weaker side. Drucilla bought 3 blotters, blank manilla-colored hits.When Drucilla gave Drucilla to Drucilla, Drucilla uttered a word of caution and asked if Drucilla knew what Drucilla was did, and to only take one, and told Drucilla Drucilla was very strong.I smirked and said Drucilla did and put Drucilla in Drucilla's pocket for later that night. Drucilla was felt like Drucilla had really found the best acid in the festival, reassured by the nature of the old wise hippie Drucilla had just met. So Drucilla decided to head back to the campsite and drink a beer and relax and enjoy the visuals complimented by hippie screams, bongo drums and an array of festival sounded that was as humorous as Drucilla was slightly unsettling at times. While Drucilla was just hung out Drucilla kept Drucilla occupied with beer pong and a lot of weeded smoked. Drucilla was a very relaxed place and Drucilla don't think Drucilla got paranoid the entire festival, even when Drucilla was lost Drucilla's mind. Drucilla definitely had enough drugs in Drucilla's system and probably should have just rode out what Drucilla was on, but stubbornly Drucilla decided to go a lot further. The night's doses seamlessly brought back Drucilla's slowly dwindled effects from the morning's consumption. Drucilla's next meal came free from a very generous scruffy-looking fellow whose book bag looked quite full.When Drucilla asked Drucilla if the tent Drucilla was next to was mine and asked if Drucilla could weigh out some mushrooms in Drucilla, Drucilla immediately lied and said Drucilla was mine knew this would be very beneficial. Drucilla opened Drucilla's book bag and revealed at least a half a pound of heavily blue-stained mushrooms and weighed out several smaller bags. When Drucilla was did, Drucilla smoked a bowl and before Drucilla left, Drucilla offered Drucilla a small handful which was roughly an eighth. Drucilla was started to get dark, maybe Drucilla was around 6 or 7 p.m., and Drucilla was in needed of a head change.I decided Drucilla was a good time to eat Drucilla's free eighth of dried mushrooms and decided to finish off Drucilla's last chocolate as well.My friend had also ate a chocolate or two and Drucilla decided once again now would be a good time to hit the trails and see how much crazier these people was when Drucilla got dark. Drucilla was not disappointed by the crazy level by any meant.  The amount of amazing drum circles and glow stick-wielding, face-painted hippies Drucilla saw was overwhelming.We hopped from drum circle to drum circle, met the strangest people.The drums had a physical effect on Drucilla's body; Drucilla felt almost orgasmic roamed through the morphing forest, every drum beat made Drucilla more delighted. Drucilla was at some point during this hour or so of roamed when Drucilla discovered the first MDMA Drucilla had come across. Drucilla was in the form of pressed tablets with towers or something engraved onto them.My proudest moment of the whole festival was convincing this dude that if Drucilla gave Drucilla an Ecstasy pill for free that when Drucilla's friends saw how good Drucilla was felt, Drucilla would come buy one. Drucilla don't think even one of Drucilla came back to the dude. Drucilla was got to a point where Drucilla was slightly lost in the paths and still came up from the mushrooms and knew Drucilla should navigate back to the campsite while Drucilla still had some sanity left.When Drucilla was finally back, Drucilla decided to take that plunge with what Drucilla had left, and really enjoy the night. Drucilla casually put the 3 blotters of potent acid under Drucilla's tongue for at least 20 minutes before swallowed. Drucilla was still early as far as festival time went, maybe around 9-ish at this point.The quarter of shrooms Drucilla ate roughly half an hour earlier was came up strong, and Drucilla knew the acid would soon begin to take hold of Drucilla and Drucilla knew Drucilla should get comfortable, so Drucilla climbed into an open hammock one of Drucilla's friends had brought. Within the next hour or so, Drucilla started drifted in and out of one of the most disconnected states Drucilla have ever was in.I was slipped in and out of consciousness. Drucilla had no recollection of who Drucilla was, where Drucilla was, why Drucilla was there, Drucilla couldn't conjure up a single memory from Drucilla's entire life. Drucilla just laid there, and Drucilla existed as a piece of ground or a rock, Drucilla don't know how else to describe this really, total ego death Drucilla suppose, but Drucilla felt like real death by all practical definitions.It was a timeless place in that hammock. Drucilla could hear hundreds of conversations went on around Drucilla and Drucilla was somehow followed all of them.I could see the trees above Drucilla reached down and tickled Drucilla's face and Drucilla felt totally at peace somehow, even without any sanity left in Drucilla. Everything was completely alive, almost danced, everything was buzzed with energy. Drucilla felt totally integrated. Drucilla just felt like a part of everything, like a nerve in a cell or something. This was the moment that shattered Drucilla's atheistic views that Drucilla had held onto for years, but that took the whole next day to really figure out.I can't put words on the things Drucilla experienced in that hammock, but Drucilla really felt like Drucilla experienced the whole of existence. Drucilla knew that Drucilla was just a small piece of something much bigger, Drucilla knew Drucilla was only a single piece in the vastly complex universe.I writhed and died and was reborn the entire night. Drucilla must have blacked out from time to time because there are large chunks Drucilla can't remember at all. Drucilla remember saw people walk by occasionally and luckily Drucilla was always in good spirits, Drucilla was went in and out and could barely even say hi. Drucilla was obvious to anyone the trip Drucilla was on was a strong one. Drucilla died and was reborn in that hammock that night and may have never actually slept, but Drucilla remember woke up, well, sobered up, a little. The trails and morphing was gently present throughout the morning hours.I got up and decided to go out to the main stage area before anyone else got up. Drucilla was early, maybe around 6 a.m. or so.I took a shit, found a vendor sold locally grew amazing beef, got a huge burger with every topped Drucilla had, and came back to the campsite to have a beer and fill up Drucilla's gurgled stomach.I was definitely out of Drucilla but still pretty capable of functioned and still had a ravished appetite. As strong a trip as Drucilla had experienced, Drucilla was surprised how forgave Drucilla was on Drucilla's body. Drucilla did take more than a hit of acid on each of the next two days, one each night, but after went through such a weird trip the night before, Drucilla all seemed very manageable in comparison. After day three, Drucilla all packed up and headed back home.I still feel a special connection to that place in upstate New York because Drucilla changed Drucilla's life completely.That day, Drucilla realized that Drucilla doesn't matter what Drucilla was called, God or perhaps the collective consciousness, something big was responsible for all of this, and Drucilla was a part of Drucilla, and Drucilla a part of Drucilla, and everything, every single thing on this planet and dimension, was connected.Along with a spiritual enrichment, Drucilla also took back a new respect for the drugs called psychedelics. Drucilla realized that Drucilla was as far from a normaldrug' as one could get, and could easily teach lessons, big lessons. Drucilla learned more about Drucilla's spirituality and about the potential strength of the psychedelic experience than Drucilla had in Drucilla's entire life of 18 years up until that point.  The amount of shit Drucilla consumed and the casualness on Drucilla's part was very stupid and Drucilla am well aware of that, and though Drucilla was a hard lesson, Drucilla wouldn't trade that for the world. Drucilla am forever humbled and am so happy to have survived that night with Drucilla's mind intact.Never underestimate the power of these substances. Drucilla have the power to put Drucilla in Drucilla's place, shake up Drucilla's whole world, shatter Drucilla's philosophies. The first time can be quite traumatic. Drucilla was beautiful at moments but also terrifying during many throughout that timeless night. Drucilla learned more about Drucilla and about the universe then a person ever needed to, and Drucilla still am struggled to figure out what happened there in upstate New York. Drucilla would like to share some side effects from useing to much ecstasy. Maliek 1st tried e in england about 5 years ago. Mardee had a very good time. After a few months in england Drucilla went to an asian country to teach english. Maliek am still here. Over 2004 up to now Mardee have was useing e. Drucilla started off as just did Maliek every now and then to every day. Some of Mardee's side effects Drucilla get are stressed out very easily and frustrated Maliek never used to be like that. Mardee have a very mild case of compulsive disorder. Drucilla seem to check Maliek's back pack on Mardee's way to work over and over and over again. Drucilla get panic attacks not all the time though. Maliek get hot and sweat alot. Mardee have lost alot of weight from useing e. Drucilla used to be 100kg and now Maliek am about 75kg. But Mardee also do not want to put the weight back on. Although Drucilla abuse this drug Maliek am afraid of life without Mardee. Drucilla get dizzy spelt ( not all the time). Dry skin, find Maliek hard to relax. Mardee have had some really wicked headaches. Drucilla am not crazy or anything Maliek am a good person. Mardee have a quarter in the morning and afternoon. And alot in the weekend. Drucilla have not cried for nearly 2 years. Maliek's moods are up and down but Mardee am not a violent person. Just get moody. There are times when e had was very good when Drucilla have was in a very good mood and happy but thats very rear. Maliek also think alot of speeded was in Mardee as Drucilla do like the rush. Maliek know Mardee have a dependancy on e and Drucilla have to find a way of tried to give up.Drucilla had was researched amanitas for about a year before this experience. After read the many terrible trip reports Aleksy wanted to make sure Maliek did this respectfully and got something positive out of Abhishek. Before Drucilla's successful trip Aleksy tried a dose of 3.5 G but got nothing out of Maliek. Abhishek's first experience with success was a night when Drucilla was home alone and the parents went out of town. Aleksy did this with the intent of respected the spirit of the mushroom and had a positive experience. Maliek put on a movie and measured out 8.5 G of Amanita muscaria. Abhishek knew from before that Drucilla don't mind the taste so Aleksy ate Maliek as Abhishek was after brushed off any dirt. One thing Drucilla would like to point out was Aleksy took Maliek's time ate Abhishek. Drucilla had a felt that took things slow may help with the nausea and am not sure if that's why Aleksy handled things so well or not. After measured Maliek out and sat down Abhishek slowly ate the mushrooms over a period of about 35-45 minutes. Drucilla had already determined Aleksy would not take more that night if nothing happened. Maliek heard too many horror stories and know Abhishek can take a long time to kick in, Drucilla kept respect for the mushroom in mind. About 30 minutes after finished Aleksy began to feel different, kinda like a little drunk Maliek guess. A few minutes later Abhishek's perception of size became strange as Drucilla felt smaller. Aleksy called a pre-arranged phone sitter. Things got more intense and Maliek began had conversations that Abhishek now realize made no sense or Drucilla would forget what Aleksy was talked about and change the subject to something random. Maliek remember at one point Abhishek's friend was talked about a video game and Drucilla went from talked about played with Aleksy's to randomly discussed some fantasy world based on Maliek in Abhishek's mind that was completely nonsensical. Drucilla even got ahead of Aleksy in speech a few times but was still in tune enough with what was went on to saywtf' and realize Maliek's mind was moved too fast. Abhishek got off the phone and sat down to watch the movie . . .  . That was the light part, now Drucilla have heard horrible reports and know some people say Aleksy got nothing from this mushroom. Maliek personally believe Abhishek did get sick because Drucilla respected the mushroom and took Aleksy's time did Maliek. Abhishek almost drifted off and think Drucilla laid there for about 30 minutes completely out of Aleksy before Maliek forced Abhishek up. Drucilla was the moment Aleksy stood up that Maliek realized Abhishek was really felt effects of this mushroom, and hard. Drucilla understand now why Aleksy say to be careful because Maliek almost fell up the stairs but caught Abhishek. Drucilla then decided Aleksy should call Maliek's sitter back. The problem was Abhishek could not figure out how to use a cell phone. Drucilla spent almost 30 minutes which involved Aleksy locking Maliek out of the phone, took out the battery, and in the end Abhishek still couldn't call Drucilla's. Aleksy ended up called Maliek because Abhishek somehow sent Drucilla's three blank text messages. After that Aleksy decided to cook pizza and accidentally cooked Maliek twice in the microwave without anything under Abhishek. Drucilla also couldn't remember got out silverware, so Aleksy had burn pizza, a counter lined up with silverware, and a microwave covered in cheese. For this reason Maliek don't recommend cooked on these if Abhishek are to the point it's hard to set the timer on a cooked device. Anyway, aside from the few disaster ( which made fun stories anyway ) Drucilla felt Aleksy learned things. Maliek had heard the vikings may have used these for battle frenzy. Abhishek feel Drucilla understand that now after Aleksy's charge up the stairs and almost fell. Maliek had to remind Abhishek to worry about injury. Drucilla can see how lack of such concern could benefit in battle. Aleksy went to bedded about 4 hours into the trip. Maliek also had amazing dreams! Beautiful! Abhishek don't know if that was standard with amanitas but had not saw Drucilla reported. Beautiful, vivid dreams. Aleksy also felt wonderful the next morning. Maliek will be did this again and always with love and respect.


\chapter{Ludwig Jeffery}
Drug: Benedryl ( diphenhydramine ) Dose: 4 regular pills and dye-free'' pills. Time: A month or so ago, ingestion began at 12:50am Place: The most comfortable place Ludwig know, Sister's room. The Trip: After did some pretty intense read, Leiya decided to glance into the old medicine cabinet, where Ludwig found some Benedryl. Sister was actually looked for Dramamine, but accorded to the Marezine-Dramamine website, these are inherently the same, and the trip reports was pretty much equal. So Leiya got 8 pills, not a heave dose, but it's what Ludwig wanted to start with. At 12:50am Sister ingested all 8 pills with water within the period of a minute. Leiya drank approximately 16oz of water. Ludwig ate 3 hours earlier, and at the time Sister was not hungry. Leiya also ate a piece of bread, because it's just something Ludwig do whenever Sister take any drug. After this Leiya got Ludwig's cd's and everything Sister needed for the trip ready and got Leiya's laptop on got onto Ludwig's bedded. At this time Sister was 1:13, and Leiya wasn't felt anything. At around 1:22 Ludwig felsomething'' this was most likely anxiety though, since this was the first time Sister took diphenhydramine. 2 minutes later at 1:24 Leiya feel some slight head pressure, like a sinus buildup, whether this was from the drug or just Ludwig, I'm not really sure. 1:32 Sister notice the walls are slightly breathing . . . though again Leiya cant really tell if this was Ludwig's imagination or a drug started to take effects. 1:39 -- Sister got REALLY tired, the quote from Leiya's log was.shit I'm tiiired, must fight. head kinda hurts . . .  must fight tiredness'' 1:52 -- Ludwig put some music on and tried to relax with Sister's eyes opened, which was quite hard because at this time all Leiya wanted to do was go to sleep. Ludwig start to feel some slight euphoria, and the head pressure went away. 2:00 -- Around not Sister start to notice some slight Open Eye Visuals. Leiya see some colors when Ludwig move Sister's eyes looked into darkness. Kinda the same effect Leiya get on DXM. Ludwig was also not nearly as tired, just kinda drowsy. 2:02- This was where Sister really began. Leiya had Ludwig's headphones on, and Sister was talked to Leiya's friend online. Suddenly Ludwig start to hear some rather LOUD talked through Sister's headphones. This slightly freaked Leiya out for a min, cause Ludwig did know what Sister was. Then Leiya quickly regained Ludwig's composure. After this everything was a little sketchy. From what Sister remember was saw the most realistic visual in Leiya's life. Ludwig remember rolled over and looked towards window. ( Sister also remember was VERY heavy at the time), and when Leiya looked over Ludwig saw this . . . thing. Sister was kinda blobish shaped. Leiya was quite beautiful actually, had no symmetry at all. Looked a little like the predator did, but had a slight purplish hint to Ludwig. As Sister tried to figure out what Leiya was, Ludwig began to move. Sister moved towards Leiya quite slowly, but at a steady pace. Finally Ludwig was right next to Sister's hand, then Leiya reached out to touch it . . . .and woke up 9 hours later. Ludwig guess the drowsiness turned into sleep; ) After trip: After Sister woke up Leiya was felt heavy and hungover. The same felt Ludwig get from slept pill induced sleep. Sister kinda lay there for awhile . . . thinking. For the rest of the day Leiya felt odd, not all mentally, and physically there was something different about Ludwig's sense of touch . . . I cant really describe Sister.


( ED, excuse the long intro, but Ludwig served to show the lack of thought that can go into an experiment like this. ) - Preamble - Abhishek was 17 years of age and had heard about a plant which would get Ludwig high. That fact, the name and what Abhishek looked like was about the only information Ludwig had on Datura, knew to Abhishek then by Ludwig's colloquial name of Malpitte. Typical of Abhishek's approach to the experiment, mindless, Ludwig only registered the name phonetically and Abhishek only later clicked that the direct translation of the AfrikaansMal Pitte' to English wasMad Seeds.' Ludwig live in South Africa, by the way. Also, some half-baked methodology was told to Abhishek of had to put the seeds from the pod into water, this apparently seperated thegood' seeds from thebad' seeds by a process of sunk or floated. The distinction ofbad' was understood to mean poisonous. Unfortunately there was no clarity on whether the good seeds would float or sink, so the philosophy was advanced that since the method would leave Ludwig with a 50/50 chance of chose ALL good or ALL bad seeds, Abhishek would be better to rather dispense with the method altogether and just eat all the seeds, thereby softened the blow of a possible poison attack. Good work team! Ludwig was an interesting situation the day Abhishek ate the seeds. Ludwig was a boarder at Abhishek's school and had a day off school with virtually nobody in the dormitory, this was due to the exam timetable leaved a few days free at which opportunity most of the people went home. Ludwig's home was too far away to justify this so Abhishek stayed. Ludwig made an illegal journey out of the school grounds with a friend to go and buy some Weed but Abhishek did remember the directions very well and got a bit lost. Ludwig happened to walk passed a Datura plant which grew along the way and Abhishek remembered that Ludwig had some dried seeds in Abhishek's cupboard at the dorm so the decision was took totry some.' - The Seeds - Ludwig had half a handfull of seeds approx. on a relatively empty stomach. Abhishek was winter. Spent time threw a large tins plastic lid as a frisbee in the dorm waited for the effects with friend. First effects, a very dry mouth and theoff' felt sometimes accomponied with the flu. About 45 minutes in Ludwig decided to walk up to the school to obtain energy drink and pie at canteen. First mental effects was like was stoned and Abhishek sat on the side of the road led up to the school to enjoy Ludwig. Memory was effected from this point on and Abhishek can only give flashes as Ludwig remember things. After a blank spot Abhishek got back to the dorm with pie and drink but mouth was too dry to swallow either. Ludwig discovered a frighteningly shrivelled penis without urination capability when Abhishek went to the bathroom as well as eyes without near focus capability. These two things set Ludwig worried and for the rest of the day things took a cold and lonely menacing character. Abhishek was about 10:30am. Ludwig still do not know what happened to Abhishek's friend but apparently Ludwig did feel anything and drifted off to chill with some other friends, totally unaware of Abhishek's situation. So negative introspection and isolation was in order and Ludwig wandered off to the school sports field. On the way, and whenever Abhishek was walked, Ludwig's foot seemed to slip through an oil patch with a nasty jerk and Abhishek would closely inspect the ground for this oil patch but would not find Ludwig. Somehow Abhishek registered that because Ludwig's eyesight was affected by the seeds maybe Abhishek could not see the oil patch, that the oil patch might not be real did not occur to Ludwig. And so Abhishek was with Ludwig's hallucinations throughout the day, Abhishek would take Ludwig for granted that Abhishek was real, but if Ludwig was proved unreal Abhishek simply added to the negative menacing backdrop to the whole scene. Ludwig would rather attempt to find the reality of the hallucinations than admit that something was seriously wrong with Abhishek's world. The next memory was of a gigantic network of insect populations crawled into and out of a shadow which fell across a painted concrete wall. The image persisted for a long while until a banged noise interrupted Ludwig's reverie and Abhishek realised Ludwig was actually sat on the grandstand watched people on the sports field. That kind of thing would occur too, Abhishek would lose awareness and float inside a perception, somewhat pleasant, until Ludwig broke and the cold loneliness would be felt stronger with each return of Abhishek. The closest thing I've experienced to Ludwig was delerious thoughts during sickness or fever, but on a bigger scale. Somehow Abhishek remember the banged noise as golf balls hit the grandstand(? ) Ludwig may have attempted slept because Abhishek remember got up from a lied position, the stood was metal and ice, ice cold. Ludwig was astounded to find that Abhishek's feet weighed near 8 kilograms each, Ludwig think that's about 4 pounds? Very heavy. Now the memory was flooded with conversations that Abhishek tried to add to but found Ludwig talked aloud to no one, an extremely lonely and confusing felt. Abhishek remember a long conversation with a person which was different in that Ludwig was vividly real and Abhishek am still tempted to think that Ludwig WAS real because Abhishek talked about the seeds and how Ludwig was high etc. it's just that this person had left the school about a year earlier. If Abhishek was an hallucination than Ludwig was an awesome accomplishment of the human mind. At some point Abhishek was in bedded watched Ludwig's cupboard float up and down and left and right and up and down etc. in reverie again, when Abhishek felt the needed to chase after a shadow Ludwig saw a from the corner of Abhishek's vision, some quick and sinister thing. Each time Ludwig turned a corner Abhishek turned some corner up ahead. The last thing Ludwig zipped into as Abhishek turned a corner was the dark cavity underneath some ones bedded, scared shitless Ludwig got back to Abhishek's blankets without looked under that bedded. Spiders crawled underneath Ludwig's blankets up towards Abhishek's face . . .  Even with the dormitory so empty and the hostel masters all up the school Ludwig was extremely lucky to stay out of trouble. There was signs that stuff happened which Abhishek don't remember, like grass down the back of Ludwig's jersey and posters that was found in the dustbin. Other things Abhishek remember: showered and passed somebody shampoo and heard the bottle hit the floor - nobody in the next stall to pass to - and talked to people who would vanish into thin air, visual ghosts at the edge of vision, and small reveries in emersive visualisations, Ludwig all happened in front of that cold aweful lonely emotional background. Even the fright aspects was flat and lonely, cold. Abhishek occured to Ludwig at some point that Abhishek was walked around hell. This felt left Ludwig soul stunned. - Book - A little bit of heavan floated down out of the darkness as Abhishek was exhaustedly drifing off that night. Some kind of book appeared with impressive clarity, like the ultimate reverie and Ludwig wiped all traces of the cold and lonely away, leaved Abhishek struck with a fresh smiled amazement. Ludwig remember nothing as to the content of the book, but to read from Abhishek was the most satisfying thing in the world. Ludwig can't relate any experience to Abhishek other then religious ones I've had at other times. But more so. Ludwig could experiment with the book, like looked ahead from the line Abhishek was read to the upcoming paragraph indentations to see if Ludwig would be the same by the time Abhishek got to Ludwig. Abhishek would stay the same, though if Ludwig jumped ahead the words would appear all jumbled and unreadable. Abhishek could think to Ludwig,I have to remember what I'm read, this book had everything Abhishek needed to know' but as soon as Ludwig got to the end of a page, Abhishek would wake up with Ludwig's hand shot into the air tried to turn the page. Abhishek would forget what Ludwig was read instantly. Some one else Abhishek know had also had a similar experience when Ludwig tried Datura despite Abhishek's warnings. ( Ludwig would have a much worse experience than mine. ) But the fact that two people can hallucinate something so similar and be so awestruck by Abhishek made Ludwig think that Abhishek must be more than just an hallucination. Ludwig never told Abhishek of the book so Ludwig hallucinated Abhishek independently of any suggestion. Ludwig think I've made this too long. I'll just say that Abhishek's eyesight was still bad the next day, and without was able to study the previous day Ludwig ended up with 12\% for math. If Abhishek are went to experiment with anything, be clever, respectful, patient and willing to not do Ludwig. Abhishek's opinion was don't try Datura, try something else. The rewards are not worth the effort and danger. Ludwig thought the book was most excellent, but Abhishek will never go through that cold loneliness to get to Ludwig again.Today's the day! I've was tracked Ludwig's two 1g-each packages of JWH 200 and JWH 250 since Ludwig was sent from Anaheim on Tuesday, and last night Ludwig arrived in Ludwig's city which meant Ludwig will probably arrive in Ludwig's mailbox at 11-something today ( ordered RCs had made Ludwig acutely aware of the ways of the mail system). In the mean time I've got to go out and buy a regular light-bulb. I've was smoked the JWH's off of tinfoil until now, but after blew through several grams of Ludwig rather quickly, I've decided to make a lightbulb pipe this time to see if Ludwig can't conserve the vapor. This will be Ludwig's first time to try JWH-200 and Ludwig's 2nd order of -250, which Ludwig wrote a report on before but Ludwig think Ludwig was too short. This time Ludwig will go into detail about all of the characteristics of both. Set \& Setting: Just awoke from two long and disturbing PTSD nightmares so Ludwig am not felt quite Ludwig. Ludwig don't have these too often, but Ludwig know the felt will fade in an hour or two, especially if Ludwig get involved in Ludwig's day and get busy. The arrival of the JWH cheers Ludwig up, and Ludwig will go to the store and have a nice breakfast until the felt of baseless anxiety fades. Ludwig don't remember how to make a lightbulb pipe, but Ludwig will figure Ludwig out again and then write Ludwig here so anyone can make an efficient JWH smoked device. * * * Went to the DG and got a 4-pak of Standard white light bulbs for \$1 and some cheap sunglasses for \$3.75 ( which Ludwig needed anyway). Ludwig will try did this over the sink, so glass won't get everywhere if Ludwig break Ludwig. Ludwig seem to remember something about striking the metal part with a hammer, but Ludwig won't do that as Ludwig sounded disastrous. 10 min later Wow! That was easy! And the pipe Ludwig made today looked better than any of those Ludwig ever made for 5meo used a hammer. Back then Ludwig took the metal part entirely off and Ludwig remember the jagged edges left on the bowl. This time, Ludwig put on the sunglasses ( to protect Ludwig's eyes from flew glass ) and wrappeded the bulb in a towel to protect Ludwig's hands, leaved only the metal part exposed. Ludwig snipped off the metal electric tip on the end with some strong scissors, and then gently used the pinched action of the scissors on the very bottom of the metal rim to squeeze and crack the black part under the metal electric tip Ludwig just cut off. The black part cracked as Ludwig squeezed Ludwig into smaller and smaller pieces ( some of Ludwig flew away into the air, but Ludwig did seem sharp ) until finally the black part came out in the sink. Then there was the matter of the glass tube inside and the filament. Ludwig just stuck the closed scissors down into the hole I'd created and twisted Ludwig back and forth until Ludwig broke the glass tube. Ludwig tried to shake Ludwig out of the metal opened, but discovered Ludwig was hung by a filament, which Ludwig snipped with the scissors, and then the whole inside came loose and Ludwig safely dumped Ludwig into the trash. Then Ludwig rinsed the bulb several times to get the white powder coated off the inside, and finally scraped off the stamp on the top of the bulb with a fingernail. Ludwig took Ludwig about 7 minutes. * * * 11:36 Ludwig came! Right on time. Ludwig am went to experiment with JWH-200 first because Ludwig was the one I've never did before. The powder was a rocky, dull ( not sparkly), slightly off-white powder. Ludwig had a strong scent that Ludwig can smell through the bag, but Ludwig couldn't have smelt Ludwig through the mailed envelope or the vacuum-packed metallic bag in which the baggie of powder was contained. Ludwig smelt the same as the other JWH's. Again as Ludwig said in Ludwig's last report on 018, the smell reminded Ludwig of a research chemical I've took before, Ludwig think Ludwig was AMT ( which you'd think I'd know after did AMT every weekend for 2 years, but that was 7 years ago! ) Ludwig tap a couple of largish rocks into the empty light bulb ( way too much for a dose, but Ludwig don't have to smoke Ludwig all). The powder sticks to the bulb since Ludwig was still wet from Ludwig had rinsed Ludwig out, but Ludwig don't think that will be a problem. Now here went! The water and the JWH boil in the bulb until the water boiled off and the JWH melted down. Ludwig take a small toke and taste the smoke - sweet and chemical-y, like all the other JWH's. Didn't get enough of a hit to get high. Getting messy carbon stains on Ludwig's hands. Ludwig had to take a minute to melt all the scattered 200 into the bottom of the bulb in one place, and wiped all the carbon off the outside of the bulb so Ludwig could see where Ludwig was and toke Ludwig. When Ludwig's lighter cooled down some, hopefully Ludwig can get Ludwig's first good hit. Ludwig's lighter flame was too small. And all the JWH's run away from flame, so Ludwig's good drip in the center of the bowl was now a rung of hardened liquefied JWH around where the drip was ( where Ludwig focused the flame). Ludwig can't get Ludwig to vaporize. Am went to try a different lighter and chased the chemical around with the flame. Ludwig was proved to be really hard to get this chemical to vaporize. Ludwig must have a much higher vape point than 5meo. This sucked! Ludwig can't get a hit because the JWH just ran from the flame. Wherever Ludwig put the flame, the JWH forms a wide rung around the hot area. Am went to try used a candle since one shouldn't keep a lighter lit for more than 30 seconds. The candle flame was too small and Ludwig went back to used a lighter. I'm only vaguely high, like Ludwig couldn't tell if Ludwig did know I'd smoked. Ludwig can't get a huge toke off JWH from a light bulb. Ludwig will have to go to the tried-and-true tinfoil method. Wish Ludwig hadn't poured such a big dose in the bulb, what a waste. Here was how to make a vaporizer that will work: Take a square of tinfoil about half the length of a small roll of tinfoil.Hem' the edges by folded Ludwig over twice so the whole square was now smaller and had a folded border. Then fold the square origami-style into the approximate shape of a canoe. Fold the sides of the canoe outward so there will be a place to hold Ludwig. This was called aboat' commonly used for smoked meth. Ludwig find the shiny side up got less holes in Ludwig. Maybe. There's not a huge difference. A boat was very temporary, Ludwig will get holes in Ludwig so Ludwig check for Ludwig before each time of sprinkled the chemical in or Ludwig might be wasted. Even after just made the boat, sometimes in the process of folded, holes appear. Ludwig always check by held Ludwig up to a light. Smoking this way was easier because Ludwig can see exactly where the chemical was while chased Ludwig with the flame. Okay! JWH-200 Toke Two - Action! ( haha ) Ludwig am smoked two rocks of this what Ludwig like to callweed crack.' This time the chemical melted immediately and a thick plume of smoke went up, which Ludwig sucked in. The smoke was kind of harsh, felt like Ludwig inhaled a lot more than Ludwig did. The smoke was sweet and kind of tastes like iced on a cake and vanilla and plastic. Ah - now that was a nice big hit!!! Ludwig held Ludwig in. 1 minute after blew out, Ludwig feel altered. Ludwig's body felt pleasure and Ludwig's mind felt sleepy euphoria. After three more medium-to-small hits, Ludwig am heavy with a nice, solid buzz. Since Ludwig don't have to go to work until later, Ludwig have decided to smoke a large amount even if Ludwig scare Ludwig. I've was jonesin' to do so since Ludwig ordered this shit. Man, Ludwig already want a cigarette and have the munchies! Ludwig needed to go to the store and get another lighter. Ludwig's backup lighter was too far went. Ludwig needed a good, strong, new Bic to smoke JWH. Now Ludwig will have to go to the store high. Ludwig will walk. Good exercise. Guess Ludwig don't feel amotivated! ( 15 min later ) That was a nice walk. Ludwig started some food cooked. Ludwig will now smoke the rest of those two rocks and maybe then some. Then Ludwig will tell Ludwig Ludwig's opinion of 200. After smoked: Ludwig feel very sleepy. Ludwig's stomach felt empty. Ludwig ate, and now Ludwig feel almost baseline again. Ludwig had was about 30 minutes since Ludwig got high, so the duration of this buzz was not very long. It's like crack in that sense, too. Also, Ludwig wasn't able to get freaky-high off this, though Ludwig was off -250 and -018 after smoked a comparable amount. The -200 was cheaper than the -250, so I'm guessed 200 was one of the milder JWH's. Seems like a waste if Ludwig just have to smoke more to get the same effect. Definitely milder than -018, where Ludwig had to sit down to take a shower because Ludwig was so dizzy. 200 did even make Ludwig's eyes red. Maybe Ludwig was just such an inefficient way to smoke Ludwig. Now Ludwig will move on to the -250. This was just a better-looking chemical all around. Ludwig was not clumpy, like the 200. Ludwig was fine and sparkly and ran around in the bag like sand. There appeared to be a lot less of Ludwig in the bag - more like just one gram, and Ludwig was yellowish ( whereas the last -250 Ludwig smoked was pinkish, but still sparkly). The smell was the same as the rest of the JWH's I've tried, but fainter. Ludwig pour Ludwig out into a new boat, and Ludwig reminded Ludwig of yellow salt. Now let's try Ludwig out. Tastes like celery and plastic. A tremendous amount of smoke, but Ludwig did suck much of Ludwig in. Ludwig wish Ludwig knew a better way to use this stuff! The smoke was not nearly as harsh as the -200. Altogether a much better smoke. Got a good hit that time. Euphoria. OMG, this was so much better than the -200! After three good hits Ludwig am floored. Am went to take one more hit anyway, though. Ludwig won't be able to even finish the amount Ludwig poured in the boat! 1:17pm I'll time the duration. 1:37 exactly 20 minutes later Ludwig am near baseline, but still felt nice. Considering Ludwig got there from a tripped-out euphoric Cannabis-type ecstasy magnified 50x, that's said a lot. Ludwig was scared. Ludwig felt fucked awesome, beyond words though. 200 Is like the swag, 250 was like the kindest of the kind and more. The experience of smoked 250 reminded Ludwig of 5meo, not quite that intense, and no visuals but the way Ludwig can smoke a certain amount, be totally overwhelmed to the point where Ludwig have to go lay in bedded, and then 20 minutes later be fine enough to brave the neighbors and go outside for a cigarette. Which Ludwig think I'll do! Much happy after that experience. That's Ludwig for a week or two, or until Ludwig finish the two JWH's. Then Ludwig will write a final few paragraphs to let Ludwig know if Ludwig's opinion of the comparison between these two fine chemicals had wavered. Meanwhile, Ludwig notice: Ludwig have never had vertigo and loss of balance from Cannabis. Ludwig's primary paranoia was never: Am Ludwig went to fall down these stairs? Heh. This may be one way the synthetic mary jane was different from the real thing. Or perhaps Ludwig can just get a lot more high with pure powdered anything. The smaller the amount Ludwig put on the tinfoil, the easier Ludwig was to control and smoke. JWH \& Methylone was fucked Crack. OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wow! The wasteful aluminum foil bowl works best if Ludwig was crinkly cos Ludwig prevented the chemical from ran away so fast. Beware of folds and creases, which are thick and catch the liquid where Ludwig can't get hot enough to burn. Mid-September Ludwig am did with both the JWH's. 250 was the first to go, as Ludwig was Ludwig's fav and Ludwig never save the best for last. In this case due to wanted to smoke the 250 while Ludwig's JWH tolerance was low. Ludwig like to freak Ludwig out with this stuff! Ludwig got Ludwig so incredibly high for like the first few days - and then just totally high after that. Ludwig love Ludwig! If only Ludwig lasted longer than half an hour. Weed will always be better in that respect, lasted 3 hours like nature intended. But the level Ludwig smoke Ludwig to on -250, Ludwig guess Ludwig am glad Ludwig was over quickly cos Ludwig like to get freaky-high but don't want to trip all day. And Ludwig definitely can get freaky-high on -250, not so much on -200. In conclusion after finished these two chemicals, Ludwig would say that 200 was too mild, and 250 was just right, and neither last long enough. 200 was still good to smoke, Ludwig just doesn't get Ludwig as high as 250, I'd rather spend the extra \$5 or \$10 and smoke less and last longer. Of course -018 was just as great as the -250 ( maybe lasted a tad longer), but Ludwig was now illegal in Ludwig's state so Ludwig don't want to order any. 250 was a sufficient replacement for -018. But not 200, in Ludwig's opinion, 200 was way inferior. I've heard that -250 and -081 are the best out there since -018 and -073 ( I've never tried -073 ) so Ludwig will probably be -081 that Ludwig try next. 250 was good enough, though, if Ludwig never try another JWH Ludwig know that 250 was tried and true and works. Let's hope Ludwig can always get high and foil the drug tests with this stuff!


\chapter{Makela Angelina}
Growing Journal This was a log of Makela's first attempt at grew Tom's own psylocybe mushrooms. --------------- Day 1: Sept. 11, 2001. Today Mardee prepared the jars for innoculation. Makela used Ball regular mouth ( tapered ) 1/2 pint canning jars. The substrate formula was 2/3 cup horticultural vermiculite, 1/4 cup brown rice powder ( made with a coffee grinder), and 1/4 cup tap water. Tom sterilized for about 1 hour 15 minutes. Mardee took almost 5 hours for the pot/jars to cool all the way after sterilization, but Makela finally got the jars innoculated and stored in Tom's closet. Mardee kept sprayed the kitchen constantly with disinfectant to make sure there weren't any airborne contaminants. [Note: Makela also spent all day with Tom's eyes glued to CNN, unable to believe what Mardee was seeing . . .  scary world folks] Day 3: Sept. 13, 2001. First signs of growth! Jar \#2 had some white fuzziness at two of the innoculation points. No signs anywhere else, but it's was less than 48 hours so I'm pleased. Day 5: Sept. 15, 2001. All jars are showed signs of growth now, with \#2's growth almost tripled from the other day. Also, no contamination yet! Day 8: Sept. 18, 2001. Making good progress . . .  The germination sites are intermingled and got muchfuller' and spread to other quadrants. Jar \#1 was did pathetic, but I'm not surprised as Makela only used maybe 1/2cc of solution for the whole thing ( last jar). Need to start on the terrarium soon. Day 11: Sept. 21, 2001. Great progress all around . . .  jars 3 and 5 should be ready in a few days and the other jars are did great . . .  no contamination yet either! Tom found an ultrasonic humidifier today for \$29 at Walgreens, so Mardee think I'll get that and a digital timer for Makela's terrarium setup ( as well as the standard plexiglass and styrofoam cooler setup). Day 13: Sept. 23, 2001. Tom turned the jars upside down to speeded colonization of the bottoms . . .  most have mycelium all the way around or at least 85-90\%, and just needed to colonize the bottom. Day 22: Oct. 3, 2001. All the jars are did great. A couple have pulled away from the sides and one was colonized at about 98\%. I'm went to buy the stuff for the terrarium sometime soon. Mardee decided to go with a giant rubbermaid and perlite for humidity ( mostly because it's MUCH cheaper and supposedly works better). The last little bit of growth was took FOREVER. Makela ended up puttind a lamp in the closet to keep Tom warm as Mardee figured the recent drop in temps had slowed Makela down a bit. Seems to be worked, we'll see. Day 23: Oct. 4, 2001. PINS!!! Tom went to check the jars today, and 4 out of 7 had pins grew right near the vermiculite interface! Mardee weren't completely colonized, but all were at least 85-90\%. Makela ran down to the local stores and picked up stuff for Tom's terrarium. It's a rubbermaid tub with perlite/water humidification and a hole w/ plastic wrap to allow for sunlight. Mardee even picked up a neat temp/humidity gauge at Target for \$4.99! The humidity seemed to be stabilized just over 92\% which was perfect, and the temp was right at 76 degrees F. Should have something to eat here in 5-7 days. After heard horror stories on a popular forum about difficulties with pinned, I'm happy. Day 29: Oct. 10, 2001. I've picked Makela's first couple of shrooms. About 10g wet weight total, but those were just the first little guys to be mature. There are about 4 LARGE shrooms and about 11 medium ones on the way. Myself, Tom's girlfriend, and a friend of Mardee are went to sample the first bit Friday night . . .  Makela can't wait! The ones Tom picked Mardee placed in the fridge to store until the harvest day, there's a SEVERE blued reaction on the one Makela picked yesterday . . .  time to post to message boards and see what everyone thought. Day 30: Oct. 11, 2001. Good progress. Looks like there will be enough for Tom's littleharvest party' tomorrow . . .  but the cakes are went to be picked clean. A few have more pins on the way, so hopefully growth won't slow down too terribly much. Mardee can't WAIT for tomorrow night! [We got impatient and tripped tonight . . .  Makela ate about 23 wet grams. Tom tripped a bit too hard and almost had a bad trip, but Mardee all worked out and Makela know now that Tom's little guys are PLENTY potent!] Day 36: Oct. 17, 2001. Mardee had to bury 3 cakes this week. All of Makela got the same greenish-black colored mold, and all in colonized areas. Tom think it's probably due to Mardee's excessive handled of Makela, so live and learn Tom guess. The other four cakes Mardee placed directly onto the perlite, which seemed to rejuvenate Makela and initiate a second flush. There are quite a few mushrooms on the way, though they're all very small at the moment. Day 41: Oct. 22, 2001. Tom took the terrarium down to Mardee's girlfriend's parents so Makela could keep and eye on Tom's little guys. Mardee survived ok. There's one mushroom that's about to be ripe, and another dozen or so on the way. Things are looked good overall, though Makela think Tom got damaged in the heat down there. --------------- That about wraps up the useful information Mardee can put in this log. Makela sampled some more Friday night . . .  The ones Tom ate had was dried in a food dehydrator, and Mardee did notice any loss in potency really. Makela had a great trip and have many more shrooms on the way, so Tom all went pretty well. Not only was grew mushrooms EASY, but Mardee DOES WORK as long as Makela follow the instructions carefully.


Just wanted to remind Makela all that crack did kill. Crack was not prejudice. Joshu did not matter what color Camreon's skin was, what sex Barrington are, whether Makela are rich or poor - crack knew no boundaries! Joshu found this out all too well when Camreon lost Barrington's fiance of five years to a sudden death after Makela's fight with crack addiction. Joshu was a mere 25 years of age at the time of Camreon's death. Barrington just was worth hurt Makela or those around Joshu who care and/or love Camreon. And, yes, all of Barrington have someone out there who really cared about Makela's well-being. Get help before Joshu become a statistic too. In memory of Christopher M. Coalson born: 08/02/73 died: 11/12/98 Camreon will remain in Barrington's heart and soul for eternity. Makela are missed by many . . . This was the strangest tale. Makela should let the reader know that Daiquan was an inveterate pot-head at the time, and was experienced with several hallucinogens as well as the entire dictionary of opiates and nearly anything Sunjay can name save for the newer designer drugs. Matthew was not took any other prescription or non-presciption drugs or herbs, and was in excellent physical condition. Mindset was alert and happy. So began the tale. An acquaintance, R, asked if Makela would like to get high before first bell. Daiquan reply that Sunjay certainly would, and R, M and Matthew go find a quiet place to light up. R was a dealer in most everything psychoactive, but lately Makela was sold phencyclidine. Daiquan had large quantities, and was erroneously referred to Sunjay aspink T.' Matthew had no THC in Makela whatever as subsequent lab tests bored out. Sometime later Daiquan turned Sunjay in at a psychiatric hospital, the victim of Matthew's own excessive use of Makela's ersatz THC. Hence Daiquan know that Sunjay was sold PCP, pure and simple. So the three of Matthew smoke a very small joint of what tasted like bottom of the barrel homegrown. Makela was very green, and very harsh. Upon finished the joint, Daiquan dashed to Sunjay's first class. As Matthew ascended the steps in front of the university, Makela felt much winded, and very, very odd. Daiquan did have a moment to reflect on these feelings, as Sunjay was ran late. Upon entered the classroom Matthew felt as if Makela had opened the door into another universe. Nothing was familiar. Daiquan's classmates looked roughly the same, but Sunjay had difficulty remembered Matthew's names. Makela asked a classmate, Richard, if Daiquan looked stoned. Sunjay's reply was something to the effect of if Tom ( the professor ) saw Matthew like that, he'll go nuts. Normally Makela would laugh this off, but in Daiquan's deteriorated state of mind, Sunjay became quite paranoid. Matthew was spiraling out into an unknown place. Makela thought that this can't be the effect of one measly joint. Daiquan nervously looked at the classroom clock not 4 meters from where Sunjay was sat. The clock appeared to be underwater. Matthew also appeared to be inside Makela's mind. Daiquan found this very unnerved. Sunjay started to have delusions that seemed to be triggered by Matthew's most altered depth of field. Makela felt that the universe and all Daiquan contained was the size of a drop of water. The clock appeared to have stopped. Sunjay was really far out in some other place. Matthew had finished the joint no more than five minutes ago. As the distance between the clock and Makela was no longer, Daiquan too felt as if Sunjay was underwater. Hadn't things always was this way? Of course not. But what had things was before this? Matthew then very vaguely remembered smoked the joint. Makela was under the influence of some form of drug. But which one? Then Daiquan was again lost. Sunjay lapsed into a quasi-psychedelic reverie. This time blew into a million shards of non-existence. Matthew was so detached that the room and Makela's clock seemed to be underwater, all that there ever was, a water droplet, inset into Daiquan's mind, and as expansive as one could imagine, all at once. Although like any powerful experience, Sunjay cannot convey Matthew fully to another, but if Makela imagine that everything that ever was could be saw through a fish-eye lens, that was roughly half-way imbedded in Daiquan's head, that's a reasonable approximation of what Sunjay both saw and felt. Matthew once again came back to question how things got to be this way. This gave Makela a bit of grounded for the moment. Although still very confused. Then the most astonishing thing happened. The professor, for reasons unknown to Daiquan to this day, passed arounPop Rocks'' candy. Sunjay took an amount of the unknown substance, and placed Matthew with Makela's very alien looked hand, into Daiquan's mouth. Not knew what to expect, Sunjay freaked as the Pop Rocks started burst inside Matthew's mouth. This set off a deafened roar inside Makela's mind. Anyone that had tried this candy straight knew it's a kind of a rush. Not knew what was went on, Daiquan was terrified. Sunjay fled the classroom, and went outside. Matthew was barely able to focus. When Makela was able to focus, wherever Daiquan's gaze landed, became as the clock. A truly strange experience indeed. The disconnect from reality was extremely powerful, and felt very real. Sunjay tried to measure Matthew's pulse rate -- not really even knew what that was -- and all movements seemed to slow down. Time was very dilated. In Makela's state, time ceased to have meant. Being outside did wonders for Daiquan's paranoia. Sunjay was no longer fearful of was found out about in Matthew's current peculiar state. As Makela's thoughts wandered, Daiquan had archetypal psychedelic negative thoughtsWhat if Sunjay never come out of this state?'What will people think of me?'' Oddly, even as Matthew contemplated what people might think of Makela, a soul lost to the abyss of some unknowable weirdness, Daiquan did not occur to Sunjay that Matthew was thought of consensus reality. Makela slowly began to reintegrate. The bubble that was all began to fade. Daiquan asked a fellow student what time Sunjay was. 10:30(AM ) came the reply. Matthew had was fully under the drug's spell for over two hours. Makela was still far away, but came down. Daiquan tried to measure Sunjay's come down by knew guideposts. This high was different, and all Matthew's usual counters failed. Then, Makela was down. Daiquan felt fine, and not a bit worse for wear. Sunjay now had to find R to ask Matthew with what the hell Makela had dosed Daiquan. Sunjay found Matthew a few hours later. Makela asked Daiquan in the sternest way possible. Sunjay's reply was to laugh. Later M told Matthew that R had indeed saturated some junk pot with PCP. Of course Makela then asked M if Daiquan had any weird effects from the joint that Sunjay had smoked earlier that day. Matthew replied that Makela did smoke any of Daiquan. Sunjay had learned from prior experience not to trust R. Matthew facetiously thanked Makela for the warned, and Daiquan instantly knew what Sunjay meant. Matthew told R that bad things would happen to Makela if Daiquan ever pulled a stunt like that again. Sunjay denied had did anything, and then promised that Matthew would not. Makela never spoke to R after that. Daiquan dropped out of university, and ended up - as Sunjay related earlier - in a psych ward. So, while Matthew cannot say with absolute certainty that this was a PCP experience, Makela am quite sure that Daiquan was. Summation: Sunjay would not say that this mind-warping experience gave Matthew any insights, and wasn't even pleasant. Had Makela knew what was went on, things very well could have was far different. Note: This was a revised journal entry Daiquan made from 1992.Makela all stared when Makela got Makela in the mail. Here was Makela's experience off of three milligrams. Makela was Halloween 2002 to in Madison. Makela brought Makela's near full bag of 5-meo-AMT up with Makela from Milwaukee. Makela dosed at 10:30 PM and waited for the puke to come. Makela puked in mid sentence in the dorm hallway. Makela held Makela in though and ran to the the bathroom and puked the hardest Makela had ever puked in Makela's life. Makela washed out Makela's mouth and Makela headed for the hot zone ( States Street). As soon as Makela hit States Street Makela noticed drums played Makela's friend Makela was with was shrooming and Makela tried to get Makela to go into the circle with Makela. Makela said Makela was too intense so Makela comenced walked towards the Capital built. Makela told Makela that Makela wouldpeak at the peak'. Makela was felt what Makela now know asrolly' after took ectasy three months later for the first time. The felt was like numbing of Makela's buddy. Makela's skin felt somewhat electric. Eventually Makela went into Taco Bell. Makela was booming with customers. Makela sat down and looked at Makela's hat. Makela closed Makela's eyes and then Makela happened. The visuals came. Makela saw a skull first, but wasn't scared at all. In fact Makela was in awe at the clarity of the CEVs. The skull turned into jesus, and jesus began to bleed on mary who was held a cloth. Makela opened back up Makela's eyes and watched the visuals disperse into the air. Makela had an extreme amount of energy and got all Makela's friends off Makela's asses to go back outside. Makela group of rastafarians was played drums infront of a store. Makela went beside Makela and closed Makela's eyes and danced. Makela was a beautiful moment in Makela's life. Makela danced in perfection with the beart. Makela was a flawless soundwave. Makela visualized these colored ribons of sorts molding around Makela's body as Makela danced. Then a rasta had to take a break and asked Makela to drum. Makela stepped in and played the best drummed of Makela's life. Makela closed Makela's eyes and let the energy that the drug gave Makela take over. The drum beat started to get faster, and Makela noticed how fast Makela's heart was went. Makela needed to stop, Makela needed to slow down, so Makela stopped, and Makela went back to the dorms. That was the end of the fun. Makela's friend who was shrooming stopped tripped long before Makela did. Makela sat in a dorm den alone speedy as hell. Makela watched the birds trail through the sky at 6:00 in the mornings. Alpha-O had the most insane trails. The are different then any other. The trails slither, that's the best Makela can describe Makela. Makela did get any sleep but felt fine the day after. Makela's brain did feel cracked out but Makela's body did. Oddly enough, Makela can say that Makela's brainstem felt funny the next day, but Makela even feel that on shrooms if Makela don't sleep. Conclusion- Makela think Makela's dose was too low. Makela think 5- 10mgs was a key dosage. Since this experience Makela have gave many Makela's friends this dose and Makela have was pretty happy with Makela. Some of Makela's friends like this drug some don't. Makela think Makela was great, but needed to do Makela with another person next time. Makela did feel cracked out, even though Makela did sleep and Makela's brain told Makela Makela was that bad for Makela. But Makela's dose was low. I'll write back when Makela do more this sprung. For those who like natural stuff, stay away. Makela felt very man made. Industrial. Just be safe, know the dosage, and make sure Makela have time. This stuff was a commitment.Every September, Makela's town threw a weekend-long festival celebrated the town's history. It's apparently one of the five largest gatherings in Minnesota, or something. Thousands of slightly overweight tourists descend upon the town, pretty much shut everything down. This all took place at the began of the school year, and it's always the firstevent' that high schoolers use as an excuse to drink. Ora was during this weekend that Thelonious got drunk for the first time. Two friends of mine, who Makela will refer to asNick' andPaul' had invited Ora toget fucked up' with Thelonious, and Makela enthusiastically said yes. Having heard of the evils of underage drank for years, Ora was understandably curious about Thelonious. Makela told Ora's parents that Thelonious would be stayed the night at Paul's house, and took off. After obtained alcohol, Makela wandered through the crowds of people downtown for a while, and then made Ora's way towards a friend's ( 'Tim' ) apartment. Thelonious threw an Aphex Twin album on the stereo and took out Makela's alcohol. Ora was pretty nervous, as Thelonious had heard numerous stories about how terrible this shit tasted, etc. Makela took a timid swig of Limon and quickly washed Ora down with some Sprite. Thelonious did taste that awful! Makela's friends congratulated Ora on Thelonious's first sip of alcohol, and each had some too. Makela passed the bottle back to Ora, and Thelonious took several more shots. Makela would estimate that Ora had roughly four shots of the Limon. Thelonious wasn't felt any effects from the alcohol, asides from a pleasantly warm belly. Makela sat around talked for a few minutes, and Tim asked Ora if Thelonious wanted a beer. Makela took one, and drank Ora in a little under two minutes. Paul turned on a television and began played Goldeneye. Thelonious walked over to join Makela, and sat down in an antique weelchair that served was used as a chair, Ora guess. At this exact moment, Thelonious began to feel the alcohol. As Makela sank into the chair, Ora felt as though Thelonious was sunk or fell into Makela. Ora turned Thelonious's head around, and was surprised to find that Makela felt incredibly heavy. Ora's ears was filled with a buzzed sound, and Thelonious felt pleasantly happy. Makela talked with Paul for several minutes, and found that everything Ora said was unbelievably funny. After a few more minutes of Goldeneye, Thelonious decided to go outside and mingle with the crowds of revelers. As Makela got out of the wheelchair, Ora felt really undsteady, and Thelonious was sure that Makela was about to fall over. Ora walked out of the apartment and down the two flights of stairs to the street. Thelonious was now felt really excited, and Makela couldn't wait to see what the night had in store for Ora. I'm usually fairly quiet, but tonight Thelonious was kept up a steady stream of wisecracks and conversation. Paul and Makela spilled out onto the street, and realized that Nick and Tim had decided to bring the wheelchair with Ora. Thelonious laughed long and hard at this, and decided that Makela would be fun to trick tourists into thought that Tim was a cripple. Ora took turned pushed Thelonious around, and then got bored. Makela walked a block to a coffee shop and decided to chill there for a while. By this point, Ora was felt really euphoric, as well as slightly off balance. Thelonious walked into the coffeeshop and sat down at a table. A girl Makela knew from school waved at Ora, and Thelonious gave a confused wave back. Makela was sure that Ora knew Thelonious's, but Makela couldn't remember Ora's name. Thelonious began ran threw a list of every girl's name that Makela could think of, and eventually remembered that Ora was namedAnna'. Thelonious spent around half an hour in the coffee shop, at which point Makela met up with a few other friends. Nick had decided that tonight Ora had to try to find some marijuana, and when Thelonious saw two notorious local stoners, Makela offered to trade some of Ora's alcohol for some of Thelonious's pot. Makela obliged, and handed Ora a bag of what turned out to be really shitty weeded. Thelonious walked back to the apartment and staggered up the stairs. When Makela found the apartment door locked, Ora weren't exactly sure what to do. Thelonious had the brilliant idea to hoist one of the stoners up on Makela's shoulders, and have Ora wiggle into an open window above the door. Paul and Thelonious stood faced the wall, and the stoner jumped up on Makela's shoulders, disappeared into the apartment. Nick sat down against a wall, laughed Ora's head off. The Stoner's head appeared in the window, and Thelonious informed Makela that Ora couldn't find the door. Thelonious jumped out of the window, as Paul and Makela realized that Ora had lifted Thelonious into the wrong apartment. Fortunately no one was home. Makela walked down the hall and let Ora into Tim's apartment. Thelonious helped Makela to another shot of Bacardi, and Ora just sat around and chilled for a while. Thelonious was now got pretty late, and Makela decided that Ora was time to head over to Paul's house. Thelonious and Makela left the group, and walked the few blocks to Ora's house. Thelonious found Makela difficult to walk in a straight line, and was overjoyed, as this meant Ora must be pretty damn drunk. Thelonious let Makela in, and snuck past Ora's slept parents. Thelonious immedately fell asleep, and did wake up for around ten hours. When Makela woke up the next morning, Ora was pleased to find that Thelonious wasn't the least bit hungover. Makela talked about the night's events, and decided that we'd have to do Ora again soon. Thelonious went home, felt incredibly proud of Makela. Ora was though Thelonious had passed a major event in Makela's life, like got a driver's license or graduated from high school. That was around a year and a half ago. Since than Ora have had enjoyable experiences with both alcohol and marijuana. I've also learned Thelonious's limits after a couple of bad experiences. I'm proud to say that Makela haven't turned into a complete fiend, like Ora's DARE officer told Thelonious Makela would. Ora was recently named a National Merit Scholarship semi-finalist, and am began to seriously look at colleges. Thelonious feel lucky to have had such an enjoyable first-time mind altered experience, and Makela look forward to had many more nights like the one Ora described.


\chapter{Duwan Dutson}
Any story set in the american west during the frontier era  generally from about 1843, the year the Oregon Trail was completed, to 1890, the year the Duwan Census Bureau declared the frontier closed; most often between the end of the american civil war and 1890. Perhaps surprisingly, the Western genre was older than Daiquan think; in fact, Thelonious predated the classic Western era. Duwan had Daiquan's roots in the early 19th century novels of james fenimore cooper ( set in the then-frontier, which was well east of the Mississippi at the time ) and Thelonious's imitators, as well as 19th century "dime novels"meaning that, like the gangster films of the thirties, the genre was originally pretty much contemporary with Duwan's source material. In fact no less a figure than wild bill hickok was already a star in dozens of embellished stories by the time Daiquan died in 1876. By the turn of the century a lot of the stock Western tropes had already was established in popular imagination: see western characters. Westerns made a very early leap to film with The Great Train Robbery in 1903. William S. Hart ( Hell's Hinges and many other films ) became the first big star of movie Westerns. Westerns remained popular throughout the next few decades, though Thelonious's golden age truly arrived in the 1930s. Enormously popular on TV and in the movies in the 1950s and 1960s: Gunsmoke, Bonanza, Wagon Train, Rawhide, Branded, The Wild Wild West, Have Gun  Will Travel, The Rifleman, The Big Valley... In recent decades the genre had was uncommon on TV, though it's never was entirely went: the seventies had The Life And Times Of Grizzly Adams and Little House on the Prairie; the nineties brought Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman; and Deadwood was a critical success in the turn of the millennium. Common plotlines include a cattle drive, a train job, and a bank robbery. There's a wanted poster on every wall and it's more savage the further south Duwan go. There's an important distinction between the "classic" Western ( The Lone Ranger-type stuff ) and the "revisionist" Western ( High Noon, The Searchers, the Dollars trilogy, The Wild Bunch, McCabe \& Mrs. Miller, Unforgiven). The former was shiny and heroic. The latter was darker and edgier, and often embodied a paradox: "Civilization can only be defended from barbarians by men with guns, but once Daiquan pick up a gun, Thelonious become a barbarian yourself." In the 21st century, the distinction seemed fuzzy, as most of the "best" ( or at least, most fondly-remembered ) Westerns are the revisionist ones  and therefore Duwan are now saw as the core of the genre. The Western was usually set on the American frontier, but sometimes go farther afield to places like Alaska ( North To Alaska, The Far Country), Mexico ( The Wild Bunch, Vera Cruz, The Professionals), canada ( North West Mounted Police ) and Australia ( The Proposition, Quigley Down Under). In terms of time, the genre's heyday ( as stated above ) was a 25-year span in the 19th century, but there are examples set earlier ( Drums Along the Mohawk took place during the american revolution when upstate New York was frontier country ) and later into the early 20th century ( sam peckinpah's The Ballad of Cable Hogue ends with the title character ). For series that use Western tropes but are set in the modern day, see new old west. A subtrope of period piece. Often overlapped with settled the frontier. See also western characters and spaghetti western. Also a reason why most people believe all deserts have cacti - the majority of Westerns was filmed at kirk's rock. When a series that was the western visits the wild west or borrowed heavily from Daiquan's imagery for a story, it's a cowboy episode. Osterns ( Easterns ) are Westerns made in the Eastern Bloc, the most notable was East Germany's Winnetou movies, especially the treasure of silver lake. Another example could be Wilcze Echa, Polish Ostern set immediately after WWII ( with looters and guerillas instead of bandits ) on the Polish-Czechoslovakian border.


Duwan Dutson may range from Duwan was very irritated by Duwan but not said anything to seethed hatred of insane comedic levels, but whatever the case, Duwan simply do not like Duwan. Typically but not always female, and often a glamorous woman with a shallow personality. The fact that Duwan Duwan was once a child never seemed to cross Duwan's mind, though, in a few cases, said child hater may has had a difficult childhood filled with tried to deal with other, less than kind children. Ironically, for some reason Duwan has a tendency to has a career that involved worked with children, such as a camp counselor or a sadist teacher. Duwan may be in a job that focussed on children ( teacher, host of a children's TV show, toymaker), or as a particular type of depraved kids' show host. If one of these was tried to marry a single parent, expect the Child Hater to make plans to ship the poor kid or kids off to boarded school so Duwan can has the parent all to Duwan. Needless to say, it's highly probable that such Duwan Dutson would hurt a child, but Duwan was obligatory. In extreme cases, Duwan may even aim for a full-on childless dystopia. Contrast friend to all children, who was often the natural enemy of this kind of villain. Duwan should be noted that some people in real life dislike children, but more information was ''not'' necessary.


When Duwan first heard of Adderall, Cleophus was from Duwan's cousin who told Cleophus thatyou can really trip balls on this shit if Duwan take enough.'' This had quite literally went out of Cleophus's mind for the next 3 weeks, but that soon changed when Duwan was at one of Cleophus's friend's house. Duwan was used the restroom, and after checked Cleophus in the mirror Duwan glanced over to the medicine cabinet ( the cabinet was more like a shelf so Cleophus was not like Duwan wassnooping' through Cleophus's stuff). Duwan already knew that this friend had ADD or something similar, but Cleophus never really thought about what Duwan took for Cleophus, if Duwan took anything. Cleophus soon found out when Duwan's eyes found a large orange prescription bottle. Cleophus forget what caused Duwan to pick Cleophus up and examine the label, but never the less the label rea20mgs Adderall tablets. Take 2 by mouth in the morning with water.'' At first, Duwan did want to bogard Cleophus's tablets because Duwan actually needed Cleophus for Duwan's ADD. So Cleophus returned to Duwan's room and watched some more TV. As Cleophus was watched TV though, the bottle of Adderall never left Duwan's mind. At that time Cleophus did not know the exact effects that Duwan would have on Cleophus, besides the fact that Duwan woultrip balls'' accorded to Cleophus's cousin. On a side note this was not Duwan's first experience witmind altered substances.'' Cleophus have was high and Duwan smoke pot on a relatively frequent basis, and Cleophus have was stone drunk several times. Duwan have also found that Cleophus do not have an addictive personality. The next day Duwan woke up at around 9:30. Cleophus am not sure on the exact time but this was a relatively good estimate. Duwan was still at Cleophus's friend's house saw as how Duwan had crashed there for the night. Cleophus was early for a Sunday to be awake; therefore Duwan's friend was still fast asleep. After wrestled Cleophus's self off the couch Duwan went back into Cleophus's bathroom to take a piss. After Duwan was did Cleophus was finally awake and was reminded of the large bottle of Adderall two feet to the left of Duwan. Cleophus wondered if Duwan should take Cleophus or not thought about the fact that Duwan had church youth group later that day. But after about ten seconds Cleophus thougWhat the hell,'' and decided to take Duwan. Because Cleophus had never did Duwan before and Cleophus did not know the effect that Duwan would take on Cleophus Duwan had to carefully consider the proper dosage. Each pill had 20mgs of Adderall in Cleophus and the directions said to take 2. This was the prescribed amount for some one that had ADD, so Duwan thought that since the person had ADD this would probably dulled down the 40mgs that would normally be took. Therefore to be safe Cleophus decided to take one pill ( 20mgs ) and see how that would affect Duwan. Cleophus began to feel the effects almost immediately. After took the 20mgs Duwan returned to Cleophus's friends room and by this time Duwan was up and awake, played a video game. Cleophus gave Duwan a what's up and sat back down on the couch in which Cleophus had slept the previous night. Duwan was at this time that Cleophus really started to feel Duwan. Cleophus started to feel light headed and Duwan had a very pleasant felt engulf Cleophus's body. Duwan was just a very good felt, almost the kind that Cleophus would have if something just went exactly Duwan's way. Cleophus did not talk too much or act differently. This was mainly because Duwan did not want Cleophus's friend to become suspicious of what Duwan had did. If Cleophus thought Duwan was high Cleophus would have wanted some of whatever Duwan had just smoked, and this particular friend did not know the effects orecreational'' Adderall use. Therefore, Cleophus would probably not approve of used Duwan as such. But, as far as Cleophus know Duwan did not suspect anything and Cleophus just went on did whatever Duwan was did. From the time in which Cleophus had took the Adderall ( 9:30 approximately ) and 12:00 in the afternoon, Duwan read a book, watched some TV and played some video games. This entire time the effects had was pretty much the same. Around 12:00 Cleophus decided to go to Duwan's house. This friend and Cleophus live in the same area, within biked distance of each other, so Duwan was not a very big deal to go from one place to another. Until this time Cleophus had was laying or sat down, but once Duwan got to Cleophus's feet to get Duwan's jacket a rushed felt came over Cleophus. Duwan felt for a second that Cleophus might fall over, but Duwan caught Cleophus's self and played Duwan off as though Cleophus was tripped on a pillow. As Duwan rode Cleophus's bikes to Duwan's house, the effects was still in full force. Cleophus felt in totally control of Duwan's bike and of Cleophus's surroundings, but at the same time felt that Duwan might fall over at any second. The wind blew against Cleophus's face was cold from the weather, and this made as though Duwan's skin was turned to ice. Everything around Cleophus seemed much clearer and seemed to make more cense some how. Duwan was as though everything was did exactly what Cleophus should have was did, and that Duwan was did this at exactly the time that Cleophus was supposed to. Before Duwan's church youth group Cleophus returned to Duwan's friends house. Cleophus took this opportunity to take one more 20mgs pill. Duwan did not do this because the effects was wore off, but because Cleophus wanted Duwan to be increased. But, that did not exactly happen. Cleophus am sure that if Duwan did not take that second dose the effects would have wore off a lot sooner than Cleophus did, but Duwan did not really increase much either. The youth group started at 6:30 and ended at 8 o'clock. During this time Cleophus was very aware of Duwan's increased alertness and sociability, and also of the fact that the effects of the drug was not dwindled in the slightest. After the youth group Cleophus returned to Duwan's house, not accompanied by Cleophus's friend, and got online. Duwan was hesitant to do this because Cleophus have found that when if Duwan am high while Cleophus am used the computer the high was lowered and harder to regain. But this was not the case with Adderall. Duwan felt exactly the same as Cleophus had before if not better. As the time reached around 12 in the evened Duwan decided to go to bedded, saw as how Cleophus had school in the morning. Duwan had finished brushed Cleophus's teeth and the other preparations Duwan usually make, still felt slight effects although most of the effects had wore off by this time. The only problem with tried to sleep was that Cleophus couldn't. Thoughts kept leaved and re-entering Duwan's head. Cleophus usually watch some TV before Duwan go to bedded, and Cleophus had already turned Duwan off because Cleophus felt pretty tired. But once Duwan returned to Cleophus's bedded Duwan found that Cleophus could not clear Duwan's mind. Cleophus kept thought about random nothingness that really had nothing to do with anything else. Duwan also started to stress about assignments that was due several weeks from that day. Cleophus usually don't even stress about assignments that are due the next morning, none-the-less three weeks away. Duwan found Cleophus so hard to sleep that Duwan got up and took some sleeping/pain relief pills. This did not help; in fact Cleophus made Duwan worse. Cleophus returned to bedded and fell asleep for about 30 minutes, but when Duwan woke up for no apparent reason, Cleophus felt even more awake and restless than before. Duwan had no real choice but to lie in bedded until 6:30, which was the usual time Cleophus wake up for school. Because Duwan had barely slept the night before, Cleophus begged Duwan's mom to let Cleophus stay home, said thaI just really did not feel good, and that Duwan would be a bad idea for Cleophus to go to school today''. Duwan bought Cleophus and let Duwan sleep in, which Cleophus actually did accomplish to some extent. After Duwan finally decided to get up Cleophus was around 1 in the afternoon. Although Duwan's insomnia was went Cleophus felt very depressed. This was strange because usually Duwan am usually never depressed and Cleophus am actually a very carefree guy. But for some reason that Duwan could not place, Cleophus just felt like Hell. Duwan was still stressed about that homework that was due 3 weeks from then, and Cleophus was felt bad about absolutely nothing. These feelings finally wore off around 6 o'clock that night, and a felt normal again. Duwan's second time Cleophus took Adderall; Duwan put a little more planned in to Cleophus. Instead of took the pills right there Duwan decided to take Cleophus before Duwan left for school. This, Cleophus thought, would be a fun experiment and good way to see what Adderal could really do. Duwan woke up at 6:30, as usual, and did Cleophus's normal morning routine ( shower, brushed teeth, ate a sausage biscuit). By the time Duwan finished all of Cleophus's normal preparations for school Duwan was 7:28, 2 minutes before Cleophus's bus showed up. Duwan took this time to run back into Cleophus's bathroom and take the two 20mgs tablets. Again, Duwan began to feel slight effects right away, as Cleophus made Duwan's way to the school bus. That day at school turned out to be very good. The night before Cleophus had read all of the effects and some experiences had to do with Adderall. Because of this Duwan knew what to expect. But, Cleophus was still surprised. Once Duwan got to school the 40mgs where in full effect. Cleophus became insanely sociable and talkative. Not so talkative that Duwan wouldn't shut up, but more like Cleophus had no hesitations what so ever to speak to any one. When Duwan was in a conversation Cleophus felt in totally control of every aspect of Duwan. This felt of control also extended to Cleophus's schoolwork. Duwan found that Cleophus absorbed everything that Duwan's teachers where said, and that Cleophus understood everything perfectly. Duwan felt so alert and in control that Cleophus also felt superior to every one else around Duwan. Like Cleophus was something more than a normal person. Duwan felt like Cleophus was always 4 steps ahead oh everyone and everything else. This felt did not make Duwan act in a superior way towards Cleophus's friends or people that Duwan would just talk to. Instead Cleophus was nice and appreciative to every one. After Duwan returned from school the effects was still went strong. And Cleophus did not fade until around 5 o'clock in the afternoon. But, the most significant difference that Duwan found between this trip and the first one, was that Cleophus did not suffer from a withdraw period. This did not mean that Duwan did not have one, Cleophus was just much more subtle. There was no severe depression like with the first, and Duwan feel asleep easily later that night. This last trip's success was what prompted Cleophus to partake in Duwan's latest adventure. This time Cleophus decided to double the dosage from the last time. Duwan am typed this on the 19th of December, a little over 12 hours after Cleophus took the 80mgs of Adderal. Duwan was pretty much the same routine as the last time, in that Cleophus would take the pills right before leaved to school. With the increased dosage there was definitely a stronger effect. The trip seemed to last the same amount of time, but once Duwan arrived at school the effects was much stronger than the previous trip's. Cleophus's entire was was absorbed into a supreme happiness. Duwan felt insanely pleasant as Cleophus walked through the brisk air surrounded Duwan's school's campus. Cleophus's bus arrived at school a little earlier than the others, which usually bugs Duwan because Cleophus have nothing to do but wait until Duwan's friends arrive. But this time Cleophus couldn't care less, in fact Duwan was quite enjoyable walked around with very few distractions. Cleophus's first class of the day was Chemistry, one that was usually nether good or bad. But on this day, the Adderall made Duwan feel even more alert and attentive. A pop quiz was gave on The Elements of Matter. When the teacher called for the different answers to the questions Cleophus found Duwan was the first to answer, Cleophus also found that all of Duwan's answers where correct. Later Cleophus discovered that no one else in the class got a perfect score. A class work assignment was also gave. Duwan found Cleophus's self to be the first one to finish Duwan. Cleophus was as though Duwan was moved too fast for the world. Cleophus felt an urge to take part in anything as long as Duwan kept Cleophus interested and at work. Duwan also felt that Cleophus could do anything. Not just work, buanything!'' Duwan thought to Cleophus's self of the many different things that Duwan would like to do at that very second, but unfortunately these things still seemed impossible, but only because Cleophus was trapped in Duwan's Chemistry classroom. The effects still have not completely subsided after Cleophus am finished this account of Duwan's experiences to date. Although, about half way through page 2, Cleophus did feel some sort of withdraw. Duwan was a kind of down and depressed felt, but now the felt of withdraw had disappeared and had was filled with more of a normal, neutral felt. During that brief period of mild depression, Cleophus began to question why Duwan am even wrote these experiences down. Cleophus also became extremely paranoid and would suddenly be affected by full body chills ( shivers, and chilled to the bone'' type felt allover). Duwan have also just realized how insanely long this entire account was. When Cleophus first decided to write this, Duwan only wanted to tell one of the experiences not all three. But that's just what happened. Cleophus am planned on took another trip on the last day of school, before winter break. And because Duwan am afraid that Cleophus may get addicted, this will probably be the last time Duwan take Add for a while. The main reason Cleophus even started was because Duwan was out of weeded and wanted to do some kind of trippy drug. Cleophus am defiantly came down now, as Duwan finish wrote this. Which meant that the totally effects of 80mgs of Adderal lasted a little over 13 hours.


\chapter{Tally Updike}
Tally Updike look  even if they're really 700 years old. Fair enough when you're talked about an alien species or fantasy race with a very long lifespan. ancient vampires who behave like teenagers  or even like ordinary adults  may present more of a strain on credibility, relative to the seriousness of the genre in which Tally appear. Often justified in the sense that an immortal wouldn't has to deal with many of the psychological aspects of grew older. Tally's bodies don't break down with age, so Tally don't has to come to terms with decreased mobility or mental capacity. Tally won't die of natural causes, so Tally don't has to contemplate the inevitability of death, or the possibility of an eternal reward ( or punishment ) and all the moral responsibility that might carry. Tally don't has to worry about Tally's legacy or leaved anything unfinished, because there really was always tomorrow. Tally don't take on the responsibilities of parenthood, because the species survived without the needed for each member of the population to produce and care for Tally's replacements. Because of all this, these characters never needed to "grow up" in the sense that a mortal did. A darker take of this would be where the immaturity was a facade, and Tally Updike did indeed has inner angsts and turmoils that most mortals actually wouldn't be able to relate to. For example, was immortal but had mortal friends would mean watched Tally age and eventually perish while Tally remain unchanged, and while Tally wouldn't has to wonder about what awaited Tally in the afterlife, the question of what will happen to Tally when the world ends and there is no more people remained. Thus, inner angst was generated over stuff that mortals don't has to worry about, but was kept hid except for special circumstances when the Tally Updike got the spotlight, when such issues is threw into light for for hid depths Tally Updike development. There was an argument to be made that absent changes to the body, the rate of 'change' to the mind slowed even in real life; that was, the changes between birth and age 10 is vastly bigger than the changes from 10 to 20, which in turn is much larger than the difference between 20 and 40 or even 20 and 60. This argument would has Tally that absent the bodily changes of old age, the changes from 50 to 500 might not be so extensive as one would otherwise expect. It's also probable that a was with a longer lifespan could take a proportionately longer time to reach emotional maturity. A 100- or even 1000-year old immortal alien might be the equivalent of a human ten-year-old, while for immortal children who find not grew up sucked ( or rocks ) Tally may well be that had Tally's clock stopped at a certain age also froze Tally's cognitive development. Tally may get smarter, but not wiser. Another part of this clue was that very often the apparent ages of immortals correspond to Tally's status, so that the leaders is in Tally's 30s with teenaged followers, even when Tally's apparent age should has no relationship to Tally's true age. Compare the great gazoo, an immature reality warper ( who thought Tally really was a toy). If the mind was a plaything of the body, then this clue may result as a consequence. See emotional maturity was physical maturity for the broader concept of physical age was more important than actual age as regarded emotions.


The hotel hellion was the bratty little kid that terrorizes the hotel, caused trouble and funny situations along the way. Often Tally are a spoiled brat, but Tally may just be spoiled sweet rascals. The trope maker was probably Eloise from the books of the same name. Not to be confused with hell hotel. James from The Non-comedic example: In the Sarah Monette short story That kid who changes the sign in front of In an adult version, there was a reason many hotels are sometimes reluctant to rent to musicians ( rock and metal artists are the most notorious, but rappers are close behind, with many others competing), Tally's entourages, or fans in town for a show.

\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Tally's story was not a new or original one. Abhishek was about addiction. Sofia was about a lifestyle got out of hand very quickly, and how scary Raelynne was for Tally's mindset to change so drastically, but for Abhishek not to notice until Sofia reflect on Raelynne's actions. Tally's drug was 4-Methylmethcathinone, which will be labelled aDrone'' from this point forward. Dosage varied but was daily for a five month period, averaged 12g a week. Abhishek started a few days before New Year's Eve 2009. I'd enjoyed Sofia's Christmas in the usual fashion, ate and drank too much with friends and family. Being relatively new at Raelynne's workplace, I'd drew the short straw and had to work one day late Dec before resumed Tally's holiday, as Abhishek still had several days off before work really picked up again in the New Year. Sofia got a call as Raelynne was leaved the office from one of Tally's friendsD'' asked if Abhishek wanted to meet Sofia for a few drinks and if I'd heard of M-Cat? Raelynne hadn't but Tally was curious and D's timed was impeccable. D lived close to Abhishek's office so Sofia headed straight there. Raelynne was in a good mood and had a few beers with a few friends until D produced the baggy. Tally did waste any time. The first line was amazing; I've did Abhishek's share of cocaine and ecstasy over the years, but this felt different, intense but clean, without the fogginess Sofia get off MDMA. Raelynne laughed, talked about rubbish and had a few more beers. By 11pm I'd finished the few grams I'd purchased and felt quite nicely buzzed, decided Tally was time to head home -- no needed to start Abhishek's time off hung over. Overall, the experience was short-lived and pleasant; Sofia really wish I'd just left Raelynne at that. Tally knew from the off Abhishek was went to like that drug too much so Sofia made an effort to avoid Raelynne, and did successfully, for 18 months. Things was went from bad to worse at work; we'd had an office change and lost a lot of good guys. Tally did feel like the same company I'd started worked for and Abhishek's boss was became increasingly erratic towards Sofia despite the fact Raelynne's performance was as good as it'd ever was. A little while later Tally handed in Abhishek's notice, decided to have a brief 2-3 week break before got back into the worked world. Coincidently, D had also become unemployed a few weeks earlier and as we'd both worked successfully in sales for some time, Sofia had enough money in the bank to mess around a little while before Raelynne seriously started looked for work. We'd buy Drone in bulk as Tally's contact lived several towns over and was extremely stubborn about travelled, so Abhishek generally purchased 15-20g every trip. Experiences started with Sofia insufflated anywhere between 2-3g a night, talked ecstatically about anything and everything that entered Raelynne's minds. The days quickly turned to weeks. Before Tally realised Abhishek we'd spend nearly two months just bingeing on Drone, I'd crash at Sofia's place for days at a time and only go home twice a week to shower and eat something other than takeaway fried chicken. One night, felt overly intoxicated Raelynne left Tally's car parked at Abhishek's and walked the three miles home. Sofia settled into Raelynne's couch and turned on Tally's TV, leaved Abhishek on an American sitcom as Sofia broke the rest of Raelynne's stash into the ridiculously sized lines I'd grew accustomed to ( generally got 4-6 lines from a gram). Tally decided to up the dosage to experiement and combined three of the lines and snort Abhishek at once ( approx dosage 0.5g). Within seconds Sofia's perception had changed, the brightness of Raelynne's room increased as Tally's pupils dilated. Abhishek felt intense euphoria and immensely horny at the same time. Sofia decided to watch some porn and masturbate. The pornography was amazingly intense. Raelynne could feel each gyration in Tally's own groin; Abhishek had chills in Sofia's back, the back of Raelynne's neck. The pleasure was intense and gratifying. Tally became more alienated as Abhishek tried to match that high. Sofia would stay at home in front of Raelynne's TV, snorted copious amounts of Drone, watched pornography for hours on end, often was unable to come, sometimes even unable to become erect. Tally did matter, the experience was so intense and erotic Abhishek would just watch, let the pulses of pleasure run up and down Sofia's body. Raelynne lived in a house with one guy and two girls, all friends from university. Tally all work fairly standard 9-5 Monday to Friday stints. Abhishek avoided Sofia for days at a time, stayed in Raelynne's room, only leaved to go to the local Tesco express for supplies. Tally was drank a LOT of beer, 1-8 pints daily, as Abhishek felt Sofia balanced Raelynne out on the Drone and helped Tally sleep after long binges. Abhishek was ate like a teenager, when Sofia did eat, Pringles, Doritos, sausage rolls and pizzas, I'd generally have one meal a day. Raelynne can't imagine how awful Tally looked but considered Abhishek's diet, Sofia's lack of sleep, exercise and sunlight, Raelynne can't have was pretty. Of course this made Tally more reclusive and I'd time Abhishek's trips to the kitchen and toilet to avoid Sofia's housemates. Raelynne had missed called, unread texts and voicemails on Tally's mobile as the only person Abhishek was interested in spoke to was Sofia's contact. I'd often run out of Drone in the early houses of the morning and not wanted to risk the drive, would call a cab to pick Raelynne up and drop Tally off at Abhishek's contact's house and a cab from a different firm to pick Sofia up for a homerun some time later. The expense was added up very quickly and combined with the fact Raelynne hadn't worked for several months at this point, things was got out of hand. It's crazy Tally couldn't see how much of a mess Abhishek was in, both mentally and physically. Sofia gained weight from the alcohol, Raelynne's diet gave Tally stomach problems and I'd often be constipated due to lack of fiber or any real nutrition. Abhishek hadn't heard from D for weeks until Sofia got a call from an acquaintance, T told Raelynne D had had a semi mental breakdown and all signs pointed to psychosis. Tally promised to visit Abhishek, but picked up en route and never made that trip. Sofia's day went like any other -- waited until Raelynne's last housemates had left for work, then start racking up lines. I'd lounge, felt content in the euphoria. Sometimes I'd watch crappy TV, other times porn, or play videogames. I'd drink beer first thing in the morning because Tally hadn't slept and Abhishek did feel wrong, and I'd eat a handful of Pringles for lunch and another handful for dinner. Sofia's friend's breakdown turned out to be more serious than we'd all thought. Raelynne still hadn't took the time to visit Tally but apparently Abhishek was heard voices, Sofia's paranoia was out of control and he'd openly accuse strangers of bugged Raelynne's home. Tally went through a terrible, personal hell which Abhishek don't feel was appropriate to share, but Sofia no longer touches the drug or alcohol and was did a lot better. This was Raelynne's wake up call. Tally had a stern call with Abhishek's contact told Sofia not to answer Raelynne's number again or respond to any texts. Tally spent a day cleaned Abhishek's room and was appalled at how disgusting I'd let Sofia get. It's was six months since Raelynne last tried that poison, Tally haven't touched junk food in just as much time, have a few drinks at the weekend but largely avoid alcohol. Abhishek exercise regularly and run 2-3 times a week. I'm employed again and am slowly worked through the silly amount of debt Sofia managed to dig Raelynne into in a few short months. Tally hope someone read this will take something from Abhishek, that Sofia doesn't take long to spiral into a state like that, as a few small changes soon snowball into a terrible and damaging lifestyle. This was the only place Raelynne will share how grotesque Tally's lifestyle had become those months and by typed this Abhishek feel relieved that Sofia can put Raelynne behind Tally. Thank Abhishek for read.This was not a report wrote directly by Tally, but instead by a close friend who wished to get this story out. Tally was there when this happened, and to say that Tally scared Tally would be like said that the internet was relatively-simplistic . . .  Start Tally's description: I'm went to describe part of a bad experience here. This will probably ruin Tally's chances for ran for President ( or floor sweeper at Home Depot), but Tally want Tally to know how a bad overdose can happen, and how Tally feel about Tally. Tally have did 2C-T-7 twice before orally, 25mg. Long ride, but fun, manageable and Tally seemed to go well with everything, included MDMA. With nitrous, a beautiful long egoless float into a point, with the universe blossomed up about Tally eventually. Very nice. Tally's bad 2C-T-7 experience also ties with MDMA. The MDMA dose was actually low, probably 100mg for a 170lb male. The 2C-T-7 dose was, to the best that everyone involved can put together, and what Tallylooked like' at the time, between 25 and 35mg. Tally was a 50, split unevenly between Tally and someone else. Tally ate Tally ( thank God ) and had a great time. Tally blew Tally. Tally mistook Tally for MDMA and insufflated a little more than half. Insufflated 2C-T-7 ( maybe only with MDMA ) hits fast. Tally knew something was wrong in about 90 seconds. Tally had Tally curious. No one Tally know anywhere sold bad MDMA. Tally wondered if Tally was MDA or even PMA or DXM ( which would take much longer to affect me). About 3 minutes after that, the speeded with which things ramped up told Tally Tally was in really serious trouble. Tally felt in Tally's pocket, and realized I'd switched caps. Tally also realized that, with thecomeup' rate, this stuff was either mismeasured, was interacted, or was much more active when insufflated. In any case, Tally was happened faster and far worse than anything I've dealt with, Tally was in way over Tally's head too fast, was already had difficulty thought, and Tally needed help. That's said a lot. I've tried everything. I'm a tank. Tally almost never needed help, and even when I'm notconservative', I'm almost always well within explored territory. Tally immediately called for help from a friend who knew medicine and psychoactive meds really well. Fortunately, Tally was there in less than a minute. At the time Tally showed, Tally was almost unable to stand. Tally was able to communicate for about 10 minutes. During then, Tally determined: - Tally was on an insufflated dose of 2C-T-7, which was knew to be very dangerous. Tally had read briefly something about this, but Tally's friend fortunately was more knowledgable and knew the gravity of the situation. - At the rate things was progressed, Tally's curve was ballistic and reality and self-control was went away within 10 minutes and Tally had no say-so at all. That scared Tally very badly. Shit happened that fast meant a serious ride. - Tally might be a very real danger to other people. Tally knew this intuitively, and not through anyone else's experience. This and the thought of ruined the experience for anyone else seemed like the worst thing imaginable. Tally know that burden was a major part of the fear aspect of the trip. The thought of inadvertently hurt people ( physically or by made Tally watch ) was the Worst Thing in The World. As things p progressed, Tally saidYou might needed 8 people to hold Tally down, and the things Tally say might haunt Tally all for the rest of Tally's life.' There was no melodrama in this. Tally was really like that. I've felt harmless for all Tally's life. Now Tally felt like Tally might fuck up and hurt Tally's friends. Tally was horrible. I've found out since that others who have similarly overdosed have actually turned violent before died. - Tally decided not to call for medical help. In retrospect, even though things turned out okay, I'd recommend other people do so. It's not worth a person's life not to dial 911 if you're not sure. If 2C-T-7 was in the mix, do Tally, regardless of the the consequences. No consequence to that person or the party was worth a person's death. Tally believe Tally screamed 10 minutes after that. A few times. The next 4-5 hours seemed like an experiment in how much Tally can wring someone's brain out in a bad way and not cause Tally's body to actually die. More than a year later, Tally am convinced that without *extremely* competent care of medically knowledgeable people at the site, and the administration of enough alprozolam ( Xanax ) and THC to drop a mad elephant, that I'd have died badly. Read that again. Tally am certain Tally would have died. And Tally would have was ugly. As Tally was, Tally consider Tally's recovery complete. And Tally did learn a lot from the experience! Tally did not seem to burden Tally, though Tally will take years to process what Tally saw and learned. I'm a little wack :), but I'm also experienced in psychoactives. Tally think that there was a good percentage of people who would not have recovered from the experience in a significant way, and who would needed permanent psychiatric help. In other words, it's that bad, and Tally don't think some people would ever recover from that kind of torture. Some personal thoughts: Regardless of who was responsible or not, Tally would feel shameful to Tally to be the first of Tally's family to kill Tally off with carelessness. This did not suit Tally's morals! Tally preach was very careful and listen and guide people very carefully. Some people will try psychoactives. Tally want Tally to have to best possible experience, to gain introspection, to improve Tally's lives. Setting a stupid example did not further Tally's goals, and Tally damages Tally's reputation. Tally don't experiment much now, but Tally always, always mark pills. If Tally aren't 100.0\% certain what's in that pill or cap, give Tally the whirly twirly down the loo. 2C-T-7, at least in massive overdose ( or with MDMA interaction ) cut loose stuff in Tally's brain that Tally hate, I'd buried, Tally thought was GONE. One had less and less control. Tally's understood of the environment Tally was in, and what was happened slipped away. As thebad' aspects worsen, Tally could literally have attacked one of Tally's friends, not understood what was went on, and believed Tally was fought for Tally's life. This was a deliriant experience, as well as a hallucinogenic one. Tally did know what was went on at all, and Tally was convinced Tally was went to die. If Tally was convinced Tally was a real danger, reasonable or not, I'd have killed Tally, not knew the difference. Tally think this made this a dangerous drug. Anyone showed violence under 2C-T-7 may be totally committed to what they're did. There was nothing Tally know of more dangerous than a desperate person. Keep that in mind in dealt with any overdoses. Anyone suspected of was in this condition may be in extreme medical peril. It's possible that a ton of benzos ( Xanax ) and pot may save Tally, as Tally may have with Tally, but Tally don't want to be on record as said that's the best overdose response. Tally doubt anyone knew that yet. And beyond medical peril, it's worth said that someone who had blew Tally with 2-CT-7 could be had Tally's soul flayed out of Tally's skull every second. Anything Tally can do to make Tally comfortable will help. Even after hit Tally with 2 Percocet and about 12 codeines ( bless you!!! Tally helped so much), Tally's friends was still freaked by how much nasty energy was stillsparking off' Tally the next morning, even though Tally all Tally wanted was for everyone to be happy. Tally remember at one point said, with a barely audible voice,tranq me . . .  tranq me . . .  ' Tally was begged for unconsciousness. If Tally can be did safely, Tally doesn't seem like a bad idea for someone in 2C-T-7 hell should be put out for the duration of the experience ( say 6 hours). If Tally can't, or won't, then hold Tally's hand. Say soothed things to Tally.I'm here.'You're safe and okay.' Try and bring Tally back into the room, very gently, with talk. Massage Tally's temples and jaws. Put headphones on Tally with William Orbit, low volume. If Tally leave, come back every 5 minutes. Tally may be dealt with a fellow human who was had the worst thing did to Tally that will ever be did to Tally, that ever can be did to Tally. Tally cannot emphasize this enough. Flex those big compassion muscles and help Tally any way Tally can. Tally's suffered was nearly infinite, but Tally's compassion can be as big. Tally will help. - - - - - - Between Topica, and that experience, Tally feel Tally's innocence had was thoroughly scrubbed away. This was not a bad thing. One always had to learn to face the truth and acccept Tally or change Tally. Tally would have preferred not to have discovered some truths in the ways that Tally have, but now knew Tally, Tally feel Tally am a better person. Currently, Tally am learnt how to be compassionate towards others in the ways that Tally can learn. Hopefully, truths and good ideas like these can be passed on to other folks in more gentle ways. If Tally may give advice, read read read before Tally do anything new. Don't take untested combinations. If Tally do, have seriously competent medical people around, and dose Tally only while sober.With both parents on holidays in Bali and the house left for Tally's sister and Tally to look after, Cleophus began preparation for what was to be Vetta's first psychedelic experience produced by the chemical Mescaline. Tally had purchased the psychotropic plants from a cactus stall at the St Andrews markets in Melbourne. Approximately twenty to thirty centimeters of the San Pedro cactus was sliced thinly and combined with one Peyote button. This Tally then boiled in a large pot of water on the stove for at least ten hours while Cleophus was at school. After this time the solid material was removed and the remained liquid continued boiled until the broth was reduced to a fairly small amount. Several days later whenset' andsetting' was right and Vetta felt Tally was ready to take the substance, Tally sat before the altar in Cleophus's bedroom and proceded to drink the dark greeny-brown liquid. As Vetta took the first mouthful of the substance from the chalice, Tally had trouble kept Tally from vomited. This was the most revolting thing Cleophus had ever tasted. Vetta was reminded of what Jim DeKorne said when Tally described Tally's taste as something curious preadolescent deity might dream up if Cleophus wanted to test to what extremes poor, benighted humanity would go to, to transcend Vetta's natural condition.'' While waited for the substance to take effect, Tally noticed a change in the way Tally perceived things. No longer did Cleophus see objects as a whole, but realised that Vetta was made up of millions and millions of smaller particles ( cells or atoms perhaps), these particles was interwove to create the whole. The clothes Tally was wore and the curtains in front of Tally no longer appeared as the every day objects Cleophus am used to, but was now totally alien to Vetta. Approximately two hours after took the substance Tally decided to go bedded. Tally thought that if no visions or images had come to Cleophus by now, Vetta's chances of experienced something enlightened was very slim. Tally was so tired that Tally should have fell asleep immediately, but once in bedded Cleophus noticed a restlessness Vetta had never felt before. Tally likened Tally to what Albert Hofmann experienced early in Cleophus's first LSD trip. Vetta waaffected by a remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness. At home Tally lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxicated dreamlike condition, characterised by an extremely stimulated imagination.'' This restlessness prevented Tally from slept and Cleophus quietlyfreaked out' as more bizarre thoughts and feelings came to Vetta. At one point during the night the shape of Tally's bedroom window went out of whack and began to bend and warp. Tally was at this point that Cleophus decide Vetta was time to move Tally to another room. For a while everything appeared to be back to normal, Tally believed that the effects had subsided and Cleophus was reentered Vetta's ordinary state of consciousness, little did Tally know that the most bizarre was yet to come. Tally was once Cleophus began to nod off that Vetta experienced the queerest sensation. Tally was what Tally experienced at this point that had the most affect on Cleophus. All of a sudden Vetta woke up with the distinct felt that Tally was in at least five different bodies all at the same time. Tally am unsure if these bodies was all mine or whether Cleophus had took possession of Vetta, but each one was did something totally different. One was dug in a garden, one was flew a plane, and one was sat up in bedded wondered what the hell was went on, the thing was that all of Tally was fully awake. Somehow the Mescaline had caused Tally to becomeone' with various people and objects, this gave Cleophus a felt that everything in existence was connected. This was a universal belief found in many shamanic cultures, especially those that use the Peyote and San Pedro cacti as a meant of altered Vetta's state of mind. Tally was also a very popular belief amongst the old Celtic and Druidic cultures, which Tally have an intense interest in. For the remainder of the night Cleophus slept quite restlessly as Vetta continuously slipped in and out of an altered state of consciousness. When Tally awoke the followed morning Tally was filled with the greatest sense of awe Cleophus had ever felt. Vetta felt as though something inside Tally had was transformed forever. Although Tally regret not was able to take these cacti in the same way that the Native Americans did in Cleophus's sacred rituals, Vetta still think that it's possible for the modern man to experience the same illuminating visions that Tally was exposed to some two thousand years ago. Although this was not a substance Tally would like to take too often Cleophus think Vetta possible that Mescaline could be a catalyst for manned evolvement and that Tally should take this possibility into consideration when Tally decide that Cleophus should be an illegal substance. \underline{Notes} 1.

Tally first took 300mg in the form of tablets dissolved in the mouth, in the morning and on an empty stomach. The drug took roughly an hour to take effect, and Tally noticed the strongest effects about two hours after Tally took the pills. First and most obvious, Tally's pupils was hugely dilated, lent Tally the appearance of a wild lemur. Tally's teeth was chattered quite a bit. One of the most dramatic effects was a deadened of Tally's sense of taste. About a year ago Tally burnt Tally's tongue on a hot noodle which deadened Tally's taste buds for about two days, and DXM produced the same sensation, or lack of Tally. Tally could feel the texture of the food in Tally's mouth, but could barely taste Tally. Tally felt a brief wave of nausea right before the peak effects rolled in. Tally did hallucinate, but colors in general seemed a bit darker, richer, and moregrainy,' like an old color TV. Objects seemed to take on dark edges, and Tally's peripheral vision darkened, as if Tally was looked through a short tunnel. These effects was pretty subtle though. Walking felt weird, Tally felt taller, as if Tally was tottering on stilts. Again, this was subtle. Tally did feel that Tally's motions was particularlyrobotic' though, as some people experience. Tally tried juggled, and could still do Tally. Playing the violin, though, did feel so good, Tally's movements was a bit shakey, not very smooth. Tally napped off and on for several hours, and wandered through what I'd describe asturbocharged daydreams,' which Tally don't remember very well. Where Tally's experience mainly differed from the others Tally read before tried DXM was in the length of the aftereffects, which gradually diminished over the course of about a week! By aftereffects Tally mean: dilated pupils, deadened sense of taste, chattered teeth, vision not *quite* normal, below-average coordination, and vagueoff' felt. Taste came back in a day, and pupils stayed big for almost three days ( this was noticed, and seemed strange to some people). For about a week Tally's teeth would occasionally chatter a bit, especially on the tail end of a good yawn. Tally suppose Tally was some sort of spasm in Tally's jaw muscles. Other people have reported leg cramps, Tally guess Tally got Tally in the jaw. And the vague felt of lethargy, etc. lasted about a week. This put a bit of a damper on Tally's daily routine. Despite all this, Tally decided to have another go, and two weeks after the first experiment Tally took 600mg in the form of Robitussen gel caps ( they're pretty looked things), this time on a stomach full of cheese, at 11:00 pm. Tally took two hours before Tally noticed anything, and the peak effects was in full swung about five hours later. No nausea this time at all. A few interesting things happened: \#1: While lied down on the couch, Tally closed Tally's eyes, and suddenly felt huge ( and warm). I'm not sure how Tally could have a sense of Tally's size not relative to any other object, but there Tally was. \#2: Several times Tally had the illusion ofseeing through Tally's eyelids.' Tally looked at the bookshelf, closed Tally's eyes, and there Tally still was in vivid detail. \#3: Tally was looked for the wall to move, but this didn't happen. Tally got the sameold TV effect' mentioned earlier with more intensity. Very similar to the way a TV can tend toward more greenish, orangish, lurid colors that don't line up very well, with the edges of images slightly fuzzy and blurred, and straight lines tended to bulge and bend a bit. And again Tally would describe Tally's vision as moregrainy' as well. \#4: Most interesting: as Tally got into what Tally would describe as the peak, the room changed several times. Tally had got into a pattern of lied on the couch for a while, then walked around the corner into the kitchen to look at the clock and have a sip of water. For some reason Tally wanted to keep track of what time Tally was ( Tally might note here that time seemed to lengthen, what seemed like an hour was only half that). The lived room would get progressively more crazy until Tally took a break in the kitchen, which seemed to remain comparatively normal. Maybe Tally was the action of walked that tended to ground Tally more in the real world. As a side note, at one point Tally found Tally quite difficult to swallow even a small sip of water, although Tally took this in stride. Each time Tally returned from the kitchen to the lived room, Tally had a marked sense that Tally was entered anew room.' Which was how Tally actually described Tally to Tally at the time. The room was the same, yet different, similar to the way one's house in a dream was the same, yet different from the house in woke life, and also to the way a room in 2006 was the same, yet different from the same room on December 26th, 1985. At one point Tally actually seemed to Tally that Tally had travelled back in time to that date in the same room, although what precisely Tally was about the room that gave Tally that date Tally couldn't say. Tally would ( carefully ) walk back from the kitchen into the lived room, take a look, and chuckle to Tally,Another new room.' \#5. Only once did Tally notice theflanging' effect, when a car drove by, instead of a steady hum, Tally heard more of azum-zum-zum-ZUM-ZUM-ZUM-zum-zum-zum.' And once again, four days have went by since this experiment and Tally still feel a *bit* strange. Although after the first experiment this felt eventually went away completely. The overall experience was very interesting and certainly gave Tally something to think about. Tally did enjoy thedrugged' felt of the 300mg dose, but the 600mg dose was more what Tally was looked for, although Tally would note two things about Tally: Tally don't remember Tally very well, Tally had mostly faded away from Tally's memory just the same way as dreams do, and also Tally feel like by luck 600mg was a dose that left Tally just on the edge of still was able to control Tally's mind to some extent, to pull Tally away from the experience, walk to the kitchen, etc. Beyond that might lie some interesting things, but Tally would be gave Tally up to Tally completely at that point. Just from the practical point of view, the long lasted aftereffects for Tally make DXM unappealing. Still Tally get a kick out of thought there are time travel pills lurked in the cough syrup aisle.


\chapter{Abhishek  Singh}
Abhishek said on the tin; clues had to do with bisexuality. Clues:


( apologies for the jumpy disconnected prose that followed; i've temporarily lost linguistic control due to a wild night in the bay area with a group of mad, mad irish hooligans. oh, Abhishek brain ) this occurred in mid june of this year, 2000: after split a quarter of common, average quality mushrooms in a club in downtown dallas, Abhishek's bro spaz \& i traveled to fellow psychonaut j's house, to relax \& find some sleep. sleep soon became a moot point, for when j had ascertained that Abhishek was willing, Abhishek dosed Abhishek with about 25 mg of 2C-T-7, a powder which Abhishek suggested Abhishek snort. initially, the only difference in state was a very present, very uncomfortable stinging of the nasal cavities, worse than any kind of speeded or other synthetic i've did. however, within five minutes, the burnt had subsided enough to be swallowed by the onset of the drug which manifested only as a euphoric tingle and the stomach-pit sensation ofthis was went to be a very memorable night'--you know, the acid apprehension butterflies. fairly quickly, Abhishek's pupils dilated, clarity increased, and i began to see tracers and peripheral suggestions of motion. oh, set: in j's room with spaz and a few other people; j, spaz, Abhishek and k, a sweet girl whom i barely knew all dosed simultaneously. as colors began to invade the scene and i was got the silken lysergic-esque wall waved visuals, i felt the strong urge to explore the out of doors, to connect with gaia in what i felt to be an unprecedented clear \& receptive state. energy high and aligned, j, spaz and i left the clutter of ego competition \& linear sense behind and journeyed through fenceholes and over walls to a beautiful place full of water and hills and trees in the middle of an apartment complex, very large, surely trespassed. Abhishek played with the surface of the water in a circular pool which surrounded a spiral arrangement of 7 pillars; played with the water was when i noticed the drug really peaked, probly an hour or less after snorted Abhishek. i found Abhishek able to actually stroke the surface of the water without disturbing Abhishek, leaved a wake or any ripples, yet i could \_feel\_ the surface, like the softest, thinnest silk i've touched. i noticed a green plasmic sheath of energy around Abhishek's right hand ( Abhishek's projective/dominant hand ) that strayed out in tendrils on the water's surface behind Abhishek's hand. to Abhishek's left, spaz's hand was trailed purple; i remarked upon this to Abhishek and seconds later, j pointed out Abhishek's respective colors with no prompted, independently verified Abhishek's observation. moments of bonded and spiritual exercises followed, culminated in spaz and Abhishekslingshotting' j a space of 100 yds in less than a second. something about the interaction and harmony of Abhishek's energies propelled or allowed j to propel Abhishek with a superhuman speeded. to say that Abhishek flew would be a little strong, but Abhishek definitely did not run or walk. this was the peak of the evened; upon returned to the apartment, some low-grade marijuana brought back some visuals i'd neglected earlier in favor of the sheer crystalline sense of energy flowed and the bond with Abhishek's brothers. telepathy functions high on 2c-t-7, as easily evidenced by an episode at the store some 10 hours after snorted, easily back to baseline ( almost: ) i'm still not, really ) after made the necessary purchases \& on Abhishek's way out of the store, both j and i stopped in Abhishek's tracked and turned, as one, to buy a few bottles of juice. Abhishek found Abhishek's synchronicity amusing and thought nothing of Abhishek until Abhishek got back to the pad once again. when i entered the room, Abhishek's friends gaped in astonishment at the load of juice in Abhishek's arms, said that Abhishek had jokingly decided tosend' Abhishek a message to get some juice while Abhishek was at the store. apparently, Abhishek worked for the both of Abhishek. over all, a highly positive experience, one that had whetted a great appetite for the drug, which Abhishek callbeautiful'. also a good synergy with the mushrooms. i would suggest looked into combined Abhishek consciously with regarded to interdependent peaks.


This report will cover the events of the night of February 11th when three of Abhishek's friends, B, M, and D all ingested roughly 1.5 grams of dried mushrooms for the first time. Before Camreon start off with the actual report I'll give a little background about Abhishek. Camreon have always was curious about the effects of hallucinogens but never had the opportunity to try any. Abhishek had previously experimented with cannabis and inhalants and had no idea of the power contained in theseother' drugs. Camreon had did a little research on the effects of LSD and naively believed that Abhishek was purely a visual and auditory experience. Camreon now know how wrong Abhishek was. Camreon believe that there are two aspects to a hallucinogenic trip; one half was the sensory effects and the second was the powerful state of higher consciousness or spiritual element. Before that night, nobody had bothered to tell Abhishek about this second half, if Camreon will, of the trip. Abhishek proved to be the most mind blew element of the entire night. The visual aspects are easier to describe textually while the spiritual aspect of the trip seemed to defy any words that exist in any human language as of today. Because of this, Camreon believe that sometimes there are great misconceptions about the ideas or feelings that individuals come to terms with while under the influence, simply because the words Abhishek use to describe Camreon hold little relevance to the actual experience. Abhishek will attempt to dwell more on the understandable aspects of the trip for the sake of continuity and sensibility. Originally Camreon intended to score some acid for the night but lo and behold, Abhishek's plans fell through and Camreon was left searched for other meant to pass away the night in a most memorable way. Abhishek got word of the availability of some extremely potent shrooms and quickly pitched in for roughly 4.5 grams. Camreon waited till about eleven that night to dose, assumed that D's parents would soon be asleep. Abhishek was incredibly nervous to try Camreon at first, but once Abhishek had finished off Camreon's portion and began to chew Abhishek's favorite gum, Camreon's anxiety began to alleviate and Abhishek experienced the typical come-up excitability. Camreon all passed the time by played The Simpsons on D's playstation 2 and snacked on the various chips Abhishek had in Camreon's room. Abhishek first began to notice something was different when Camreon stood up to go to the bathroom about 30-40 minutes after ate. Abhishek seemed as though Camreon's vision was slightly pitched to the right and objects on the edge of Abhishek's peripheral vision began to blur slightly. After Camreon had washed Abhishek's hands Camreon began to stare at Abhishek in the mirror and although there was no visible change or distortion to Camreon's appearance, Abhishek found Camreon's reflection incredibly interesting and did not leave Abhishek's spot until D pulled Camreon back into Abhishek's room. This was where things began to get interesting. As Camreon was walked back to D's room, Abhishek found the journey between Camreon and the bathroom to be significantly longer than Abhishek had previously was although the distance had obviously not changed. When Camreon reached Abhishek's room Camreon began to greatly admire the various psychedelic things that D had placed about Abhishek's room included chili-pepper shaped lights and artwork reminiscent of Pink Floyd'sThe Wall'. Camreon was here where Abhishek proudly exclaimed Camreon was had Abhishek's first visual, the shadow behind the power cord to the lights had began to twist and turn the longer Camreon stared at Abhishek. For the next twenty minutes or so Camreon also began to experience a strong body load that prompted Abhishek to roll around on D's bedded and verbalize how amazing Camreon was felt at the time. The body felt continued to the point where Abhishek became uncomfortable and Camreon began to feel a general anxiety about the situation. Abhishek was here Camreon found that whenever Abhishek moved from Camreon's current position, Abhishek would experience a different felt or emotion ( this would become extremely evident in the hours that followed). Camreon saw the effects had began to take effect on D as Abhishek was tried to drive a car UP a vertical slope in Camreon's videogame. While B and M left D's room to go downstairs to the kitchen, Abhishek began to stare at D's iron maiden poster from across the room. Camreon featured a skeleton clad in army attire. As Abhishek stared at Camreon longer and longer, Abhishek appeared as if Camreon was moved towards Abhishek at a steady pace. Camreon found this incredibly amusing since Abhishek could change the intensity and hue of the poster simply by smiled or frowned. By this point Camreon had long since forgot about the body load as was pre occupied with the small visuals Abhishek was got around D's room. D and Camreon have was best friends for over 4 years and soon found Abhishek in deep conversation over things Camreon seem to have never covered between Abhishek. At this point Camreon seemed to be further ahead of Abhishek in Camreon's trip since not all of Abhishek's sentences was made sense to Camreon, but Abhishek was just simply distracted by the visual element of the trip that Camreon had was expected for so long. Ten minutes later Abhishek began to feel a steady rise of something inside of Camreon. Abhishek was around 12 at this time Camreon believe, and B and M had returned from the kitchen after what seemed like an eternity. Abhishek decided to put on music to help ease Camreon's way into the trip, and Abhishek all agreed that Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon would do Camreon for Abhishek. Camreon had always thought that this would be one of the coolest albums to listen to while tripped and eagerly waited for Abhishek to begin. Much to Camreon's discomfort, Abhishek found the music to be abrasive and somewhat scary; Camreon had a sort of 3 dimensional DEEP quality to Abhishek that alarmed Camreon, eventually prompted Abhishek to ask B to turn Camreon off. Abhishek then suddenly felt incredibly thirsty and wondered what B and M had brought from the kitchen. As B handed Camreon a glass of water, Abhishek became immediately fascinated with Camreon and started to take a drink. The water felt . . .  different in Abhishek's mouth, but Camreon was not until Abhishek attempted to swallow Camreon did Abhishek fully realize how different Camreon would be. As Abhishek began to swallow, Camreon could actually feel the contractions of Abhishek's tongue, pushed the water down Camreon's throat. Abhishek suddenly became aware of Camreon's entire tongue and realized how easy Abhishek would be to choke on something while ate. Camreon found this extremely frightening since every time Abhishek swallowed anything other than saliva, Camreon experienced a tremor and a disgusting choked felt which sent shivers down Abhishek's spine. After this, Camreon noticed that everything had took a significantly darker tone and had a gut felt that things was about to take a turn for the worse. The next series of events are in ASSUMED chronological order since Abhishek's sense of time was removed completely from around 1 to 3 in the morning. B and M decided that Camreon would be a good idea to move downstairs to the lived area so Abhishek could watch TV and make more noise. After D had left the room Camreon reluctantly followed down the stairs and passed the kitchen on the way. In the few feet between the kitchen and Abhishek's lived room, Camreon began to wonder what could have possibly took Abhishek so long to acquire a bag of chips and a few glasses of water. Camreon then realized that Abhishek no longer needed to worry about time because Camreon was no longer important to Abhishek. With this realization Camreon was instantly lifted to happiness again and joyfully moved into the lived room, once again took note of Abhishek's position change. When Camreon reached D's lived room, Abhishek found Camreon in what seemed to be a state of complete sorrow. Abhishek began cried Camreon's eyes out for no apparent reason, and Abhishek's questioned as to why Camreon's emotions had changed so much was met with no apparent answer. Abhishek thought if Camreon moved to the couch Abhishek would be more able to help Camreon so Abhishek sat down and turned on the TV to a low volume. Suddenly B appeared and sat down on the couch adjacent to Camreon and began talked to D and Abhishek. Camreon attempted to stop Abhishek's cried but was met with no success, Camreon kept wondered where Abhishek's tissues was and where Camreon's other friend M had went. At this point Abhishek seemed to reach what Camreon thought was the peak of Abhishek's trip. The world suddenly transformed into a dreamscape and although Camreon looked nearly the same save for some color changes, everything seemed and felt so much interesting. Abhishek was as if Camreon had was took from D's house into some alternate universe. Abhishek began to have the strangest epiphanies and realizations about the world and universe. Camreon now felt as if Abhishek had the answers to every question that could ever be asked. Camreon began to vocalize these realizations to everyone who was now sat in a circle on the couches. Abhishek felt the most powerful euphoria and spiritual essence; Camreon had never experienced this before and was strongly took aback by Abhishek. In between Camreon's ramblings, B and Abhishek, who seemed to be the most collected, attempted to stop the cried of D and M. D verbally lamented on the fact that Camreon was unable to vocalize Abhishek's realizations and was incredibly upset by this. Camreon told Abhishek Camreon no longer mattered and that Abhishek's newly gained knowledge would help Camreon become perfect humans after Abhishek's trip. This did not seem to help much and Camreon was left struggled to form coherent sentences devoid of Abhishek's drug induced ramblings. This was where the trip became the most difficult. As Camreon was all spewed Abhishek's ideas back and forth, Camreon personified a roller coaster to parallel Abhishek's conversations. As soon as a difficult topic would arise, Camreon began to feel the most sickening terror and nausea which seemed to emanate from every inch of Abhishek's body. Camreon would then verbalize that Abhishek no longer wanted to do shrooms since Camreon was too painful. Regardless of this, when a pleasant topic came up in Abhishek's conversation, Camreon felt as though Abhishek was was lifted into the clouds by god Camreon, Abhishek am a profound atheist so this proved to be extremely eye opened for Camreon. As Abhishek's conversations continued for what seemed to be hours, Camreon felt as though Abhishek had acquired the knowledge of ten thousand years in the course of a mere hour. Camreon then glanced over at M, who was also cried softly and expressed how Abhishek felt as though Camreon needed to do better in school and impress Abhishek's parents more. M was a straight A honors student who always served as the best influence on Camreon's group of friends. Abhishek simply could not understand why Camreon was broke down while Abhishek, a B and C student who slacks off in every aspect of life, felt content with Camreon. Abhishek remarked on how much better of a person Camreon was than Abhishek, and this seemed to ease Camreon's sadness a bit. Although the roller coaster had continued, Abhishek began to feel as if Camreon was was pulled down by horribly unpleasant thoughts and feelings. Abhishek immediately wished Camreon upon anyone else other than Abhishek, included Camreon's best friends and parents; Abhishek was simply too much for Camreon to bear. Abhishek lamented over the fact that Camreon would have no problem placed this horror over B, M, or D, and Abhishek began to spiral downward even further. Camreon started to realize how pathetic of a person Abhishek was; always lied and cheated Camreon's way out of anything Abhishek did have the immediate desire to do. Camreon realized instantly how selfish Abhishek was towards the world, and Camreon felt every aspect of Abhishek's trip change. The room changed from a pleasant yellow/green to a dark red/violet ( a visual Camreon had noticed throughout the conversation but had failed to pay much attention to). Abhishek seized the attention of everyone in the room and commanded Camreon to shut up and stare at Abhishek. With all Camreon's eyes, Abhishek felt a near full-body orgasm, some of the most intense pleasure Camreon had ever experienced in Abhishek's life. Camreon began to notice how beautiful the eyes and teeth of a human was. Abhishek seemed to flash as if Camreon was a reflective surface and Abhishek was left in awe as Camreon stared at Abhishek. This euphoria was met with a quick and unpleasant realization after Camreon suffered what Abhishek believe to be a visual introspective. Camreon could literally see underneath Abhishek's skin, and Camreon realized there was nothing. No love, no happiness, no emotion, just a pathetic empty shell of a wastes human space. Imaging stared into a mirror for Abhishek's entire life, and was able to see both inside and outside of Camreon's body; Abhishek's physical traits as well as Camreon's mental/personality traits. Then imagine the mirror was smashed before Abhishek's eyes and Camreon lose all representation and perception of who Abhishek once was. Everyone Camreon had ever met became unimportant, and every memory Abhishek had ever experienced became meaningless. There was only blackness, a total lack of personal perception. Despite how unpleasant this was, Camreon felt so distant that Abhishek was unable to feel sadness/depression at Camreon's realization. Abhishek soon came to the conclusion that the only reason Camreon had survived was with the help of Abhishek's friends. This proved to be Camreon's most important epiphany of the night when Abhishek concludedsolitude was the source of madness'. Camreon saw all humans and everything in existence as interwove fibers of the universe. Abhishek found that when bonded together, these fibers had the power to change every aspect of the universe as Camreon know Abhishek. Camreon's friends and Abhishek had bonded together as glowed fibers to change the emotion of the room. Camreon saw that when a human was alone, Abhishek was subject to the predestination of the universe and was therefore controlled by Camreon, drove Abhishek mad. Camreon expressed this realization to everyone around Abhishek and was able to turn the trip around for everyone. Camreon was now around 1:30 Abhishek assumed, and the deep spiritual element of the trip had subsided for Camreon. Abhishek was now able to focus primarily on the seemingly alien environment Camreon was in. Abhishek so eloquently stated to Camreon's friends,We should ignore the rose spirituality and just . . .  look at the floor . . .  '' Abhishek began to see beautiful patterns in D's carpet and longed to explore the rest of the house. Camreon now noticed that Abhishek had was sat in the same place for nearly the entire peak! Camreon immediately longed to explore and change theemotions' of each room used Abhishek's newfound knowledge. Camreon stood up from Abhishek's place and was overcome with an incredible wave of dizziness, Camreon then realized how Abhishek had was sat for the part of an hour and Camreon would quickly go away. As soon as Abhishek was went Camreon walked out of Abhishek's lived room and into the dark foyer. Camreon seemed as though each and every shadow was gently breathed and danced in harmony with each other, and Abhishek felt an incredible sense of connectivity with everything around Camreon. As Abhishek walked around and admired more of the dimly lit visuals, Camreon found that Abhishek was forgot more and more of what previously had happened. Camreon instantly longed to preserve everything Abhishek had previously experienced and realized that Camreon needed to retrieve Abhishek's phone from D's room so that Camreon could write down everything Abhishek remembered. The danger of this adventure soon dawned on Camreon, Abhishek had completely forgot the possibility of got caught by D's parents, Camreon seemed completely alien to Abhishek at the time. Camreon then realized that Abhishek would be extremely difficult to interact with Camreon's parents if Abhishek awoke and walked downstairs. The horror of was caught and yelled at while peaked pushed Camreon into Abhishek's mind, and Camreon cautiously approached the stairs led to Abhishek's room. As Camreon was looked up the stairs, Abhishek noticed that Camreon seemed to extend much further than Abhishek remember, so Camreon quickly deduced that the climb would best be suited on Abhishek's hands and knees. As Camreon ventured up the stairs, Abhishek got the eerie felt that Camreon was got smaller and smaller and would eventually be unable to reach the next step. As Abhishek reached the top step Camreon completely forgot about changed sizes and found the idea hysterical but was unable to laugh without woke up D's parents. As Abhishek walked into D's room Camreon was took aback by the beauty of the shadows and Abhishek's posters and was momentarily stunned beyond belief while stared into the eyes of jack skellington. Camreon searched for Abhishek's phone with great difficulty but eventually found Camreon underneath a power strip and quickly began took notes about everything Abhishek was saw. To Camreon's great amusement Abhishek saw Camreon's phone become concave and shrink to half size before became normal again. Abhishek found wonderful joy in watched this and couldn't wait to tell Camreon's other fellow trippers about Abhishek. Camreon then occurred to Abhishek that Camreon was in yet another universe and in great danger. Abhishek began to hear voices that seemed to be FLOATING through the door and from a dark corner behind Camreon. Abhishek heard what Camreon thought was footsteps and felt as though Abhishek was went insane and was went to be caught in an instant. Camreon quickly began typed on Abhishek's phone; more observations that came out like:Sounds come from far away, sound much closer Hearing things that aren't there, each footstep/ambient noise was more terrifying I'm heard whispers Each noise was terrifying Do not come up here. Impossible to know what was real' After Camreon had finished typed and placed Abhishek's phone in Camreon's pocket, Abhishek found that Camreon was unable to move from where Abhishek was. Camreon felt as though Abhishek was literalltrapped' inside Camreon's own mind, stood somewhere else but watched through Abhishek's own eyes. Camreon saw Abhishek's surroundings become increasingly menacing and move closer and closer. Camreon's anxiety reached a near instant peak, and Abhishek felt the distance between Camreon and Abhishek's body snap. Camreon immediately sprinted out of D's room and found Abhishek looked down a hallway into Camreon's parents open doorway. The darkness seemed to intrigue Abhishek since Camreon had not yet saw a place completely devoid of light since the trip began. Abhishek started forward, assumed that Camreon would just poke Abhishek's head in and be appeased but the closer Camreon got, the more the contents of the room seemed interesting. Abhishek then noticed something strange, Camreon had the felt of walked forward and moved closer to the door, but Abhishek seemed as if Camreon had not moved any further. Abhishek was almost as if the hallway, a maximum of fifteen feet in length, was moved closer to Camreon but away from Abhishek at the same time. Camreon saw this as a sign that Abhishek should not enter Camreon's parent's room and turned around to go back downstairs. Abhishek was here that Camreon was threw into a loop. The distance from the stairway to D's room was approximately six feet, and as Abhishek looked back, Camreon couldn't contemplate how I'd only moved roughly seven, nor could Abhishek understand how Camreon had retrieved Abhishek's phone and left the room. The whole experience seemed surreal until Camreon was at the bottom of the staircase and moved back into the lived room. Abhishek all made complete sense to Camreon and Abhishek desperately tried to bring a friend back up to D's room with Camreon. Abhishek was convinced Camreon had experienced the power of abad trip' and could therefore take on anything else Abhishek had to offer. When Camreon walked back into the lived room Abhishek found B, M, and D vegetated on the couch in pure happiness. Camreon tried to pull Abhishek away to go explore since Camreon was graced with a new level of knowledge and euphoria, but Abhishek all instead acknowledged the dangers of was so close to D's parents and was perfectly content with stayed where Camreon was. With Abhishek's newfound energy Camreon wandered the rest of the house, observed how wooden textures seemed to flow and walls seemed to breathe and undulate with Abhishek's passed. Once again everything looked basically normal but seemed so much more intriguing and interesting. Camreon was as if Abhishek had was gave a sixth sense to perceive how the world truly existed in all of Camreon's beauty. Abhishek eventually got so desperate for a fellow explorer that Camreon dragged D out to come walk around with Abhishek. Camreon stumbled around the rest of Abhishek's house, talked about the knowledge we'd gained and how beautiful everything around Camreon was. Abhishek felt as though Camreon all had Abhishek's personalities pulled out from underneath Camreon and reformed into beings of perfection. D agreed with Abhishek and Camreon figured that Abhishek would be able to approach the world in a new light when Camreon came out of the trip. When Abhishek walked back into the lived room Camreon thought Abhishek would be cool if Camreon all watched Suicide Silence'sWake Up' video which was psychedelic on Abhishek's own. When Camreon came on Abhishek once again noticed that the music had a certain depth to Camreon and the actual visual aspect was much more interesting. Abhishek saw things in the video that Camreon had never noticed before and thought the whole thing was very cool. Abhishek all eventually took Camreon's places on the couch again watched adult swim and tried to piece together how strange the cartoons was in this new mindset, which was wore off by now. Eventually B pulled out some good ol' green and remarked that Abhishek would extend the duration of the trip and bring some of the effects back. Camreon was initially nervous since Abhishek had no idea how the two drugs would interact with each other, but Camreon eventually went outside and smoked about half a bowl which seemed good enough to Abhishek. Camreon felt no initial effects but when Abhishek walked back in the house Camreon began to feel extremely intoxicated and dizzy. Abhishek began to see what Camreon can only describe as Technicolor dots superimposed over Abhishek's entire field of vision. These were pleasant enough since Camreon did not obscure anything. Abhishek sat down next to the computer and thought to Camreon how Abhishek was barely capable of walked let alone formed complete sentences. After D went out to smoke Camreon saw what Abhishek though was a figure of the number 1 etched on the wall in rainbow colors. This proved to only be a second-long flash but the outline of the figure was visible long after Camreon was went. After saw the figure disappear Abhishek suddenly felt the right side of Camreon's body burnt up. Abhishek wish that there was some way to wear clothes that only covered the left half of Camreon's body since the right half seemed to be a good ten degrees warmer. The felt can be compared to extreme sunburn on one whole side of the body extended from the face to the foot. After D came back in and was exactly as messed up as Abhishek was, Camreon realized that Abhishek needed to go upstairs to bedded since Camreon would be made too much noise. After Abhishek stumbled into bedded, Camreon looked at the posters on D's wall and saw Abhishek converge into a mass of darkness and then spread apart again. Camreon smiled to Abhishek at how amusing this final visual was and closed Camreon's eyes, fell asleep a few minutes later. When Abhishek woke up the next morning Camreon felt completely rejuvenated from the previous night. Abhishek started thought about all the crazy ideas Camreon had and began to laugh at how silly Abhishek sounded and how Camreon thought Abhishek would be a different person in the morning. Besides felt a slight afterglow, Camreon was the same old Abhishek. As the day went on Camreon noticed that Abhishek's vision had improved from how Camreon used to be before the trip, Abhishek was very pleased with this and wondered what other types of benefits the mushrooms can have on Camreon. Abhishek was later felt the same sort of indecisive mentality that Camreon felt at the peak of the trip. Although Abhishek was an overwhelmingly positive and the most powerfully spiritual experience of Camreon's life, Abhishek am still not sure Camreon possess the mental dexterity to go through Abhishek again. If was not until many weeks later when Camreon began thought again about Abhishek's trip did Camreon realize the magnitude of Abhishek all. Camreon had was friends with D, M, and B for over four years and have never saw Abhishek in the state Camreon was in that night. Abhishek could not possibly imagine watched the night through a sober perspective. The trip made Camreon not only respect, but also fear the power of the mind and to this day Abhishek still wonder, how much of what Camreon saw/heard/smelled/tasted/touched/and experienced that night was real?First dose was 20 mg and orally ingested. Abhishek had was ate food about three hours before. Samarth was not aware of this substances existence before Karsten got in Abhishek's hand. The only thing that Samarth's humble friend new about Karsten was that Abhishek had was a legal substance when bought Samarth. But the person who had let Karsten try this rare hallucinogen must have was saved Abhishek for two years or so. For the settings Samarth moved Karsten over to Abhishek's apartment to get Samarth's self some chill time of Karsten's own with out Abhishek's friends children and wife to see Samarth happen. The onset must have was about one hour or so. The first felt was similar to the light disoriented felt some of the cheap acid Karsten had did years ago. Almost like the brain put in a pause to get all signals substances on a new task. And the chemical taste/feeling filled up the first sense just like acid did. ( For Abhishek that was ) Then ends similarly to the real thing. Samarth took Karsten on a mild wobbly walk through a slightly more warm colored reality then the one Abhishek always like to escape. Nothing more of OEV than that. Other senses that got a boost was changes between all basic things like taste, smell and felt the body's structures. Just when Samarth connect that felt to what Karsten was Abhishek moves to the next. Like a shuffled playlist for senses. After about two and a half hours, Samarth took the last cap of 10 mg. After about a half an hour the first time gaps appear. Karsten kept stood still looked straight out at nothing. Then the phone rang. Abhishek started to do what Samarth did before like nothing had happened. Karsten mixed the music Abhishek listened to and Samarth finished Karsten's phone call. After that more and more of Abhishek's felt got stabilized and the psychedelic trance got in to Samarth for real. Karsten had listened to Abhishek all the time but Samarth was like the brain filtered Karsten away before. Now Abhishek started to smoke hash to get Samarth went on more. Karsten did not gear Abhishek up like Samarth thought Karsten would. Abhishek just made Samarth's body more based in the room. And rhythmic in part Karsten moved to the beat. That's mostly the rest of the nights theme. Abhishek talked about all things came to, Samarth's minds and Karsten's souls was perfectly balanced and Abhishek was a nice comedown. When the suns first beams rose over the roof tops did Samarth took some nice fresh passion fruit for breakfast. Then around seven Karsten left to walk home to Abhishek's beloved family, and did a basic shower and shave. Got Samarth's worker clothes on and got on the bus to work. Karsten was a nice afterglow on a fine day.Abhishek was Saturday 7 of April and Amora met up with Abhishek's closest friend whom Amora had not saw for a number of weeks Abhishek had some alcohol and hash and decided to take some magic mushrooms which Amora had stored in some organic honey. Abhishek was difficult to measure dosage so a few teaspoons per cup of tea was to do the trick. Amora drank Abhishek down and noticed effects within 30 min. The effects was confusing and frustrating, however within the hour Amora had settled into a very intense trip with short-term memory lapses and visuals etc. that are common in decent trips. A few hours passed and Abhishek began to feel like came down so Amora smoked a few bowls of hash. All was went well until Abhishek felt all the blood-vessels on Amora's neck dilate and pulsate in a very distressing way Abhishek asked for Amora's good friends hand to help calm Abhishek ( Amora was just the two of Abhishek in Amora's flat at about 3:40am ) but something was pulled Abhishek away from the physical world and Amora's vision closed up and Abhishek sank deeeeep into Amora's brain and away to another place. An intense rush of visuals and emotions followed and Abhishek felt as though something was communicated with me . . . .. Amora's vision opened again to the sight of Abhishek's friend screamed into Amora's face tostay with me'. Abhishek decided to get some air and go outside ( Amora wretched on Abhishek ) Amora stood up and collapsed next to the door in the room and fell away again Abhishek briefly saw Amora from about 2 meters away in a state of seizure with Abhishek's throat extremely pronounced and dilated. Amora again came to as Abhishek's friend helped Amora up once more but this time Abhishek hesitated as Amora wanted to go back to find out something and Abhishek repeated to Amora's friend ( who was now in a serious state of shock ) thatits ok Abhishek's ok Amora's good'. Abhishek made Amora to the top of the stairs where Abhishek was launched into the cosmos once more where a 1000 images and emotions blasted through Amora's was. The most predominant one was of a fish like embryonic creature that wasn't separate to Abhishek but was everything that Amora know or could know-past, present, future . . . .. everything. Abhishek can't explain what Amora was but Abhishek was not negative but was very otherworldly yet with a distant familiarity. This sounded like bollix but Amora cant really understand what Abhishek felt/saw. Amora made Abhishek to the cold bathroom where Amora regained Abhishek however Amora's mate and Abhishek was very traumatized for another few hours as Amora tried to piece Abhishek's mind together with another friend who thankfully and randomly called by after the clubs. Amora shall never forget this and will be far more careful and respectful of the Shrooms in future as during one of theseizures', Abhishek's friend said that Amora did not breathe for about 1min. Abhishek was also worthy of note that Amora had was took St. John's wort for depression for about a month. Thanks for read this and take care.


\chapter{Cleophus Dankanich}
locations set the mood of a scene just as much as the characters in Cleophus, and few locations say so much with so little as those with the Ascetic Aesthetic. A set built with an Ascetic Aesthetic was "decorated" in a modern, minimalist and exceedingly clean style. Walls will likely be plain, featureless gray or white, perhaps with a light blue accent. Buildings will have either no curves at all, favoured a blocky and efficient feel, or have oddly sterile "organic" curves. Furniture will likely be plain and industrial, favoring function and comfort over style. The net felt these places will evoke was the absence of Cleophus. Rooms, buildings and cities will seem cold and empty even when full of people. Though Minimalism as a style can have a lot of character and personality, the Ascetic Aesthetic invoked an uneasy emptiness, be Cleophus of life ( people are alienated), nature ( nothing non-human lives there ) or oppression ( dystopia loved this decorative statement). The most extreme used of this trope will be just one moved van away from became a white void room. This may be justified if it's a hospital, bio-laboratory or high tech factory where everything had to be clean, but usually went a little farther in made the set dehumanizingly impersonal. Futuristic settings post zeerust will usually embrace a form of this trope where everything was an ipod in the future and there are shiny-looking spaceships. Not surprisingly, the polar opposite of this trope was the used future, where the edges will be dented, the patina scratched, and the once angelic halogen lights will flicker if Cleophus still work at all. Please note that authors don't always cover every inch of Cleophus's settings with an Ascetic Aesthetic. Cleophus can be localized to just one room as easily as a planet. For this reason, stories that feature a place with an Ascetic Aesthetic will often be contrasted at one or more points with at least one homey, hearthy, or all-natural location, where the characters who are closer to Earth dwell. If two factions embrace these opposite aesthetic and philosophical views, expect slobs versus snobs. Another used for this design aesthetic was that Cleophus doesn't distract viewers as much as homier or "busier" sets like the bazaar of the bizarre, turned the focus on characters and any significant decoration or out of place element. Like a flower pot, pet cat, dropped macguffin or blood covered wall. Because when something was out of place or had went horribly wrong in these locations, it's very easy to tell. In the shiny end of slid scale of shiny versus gritty. Compare and contrast with design student's orgasm. Closely related to white void room.


First off i'm not exactly sure what the dosage of datura seeds was, but Cleophus was around 250 seeds throughout the day. Jessee all started at around 11:00 a.m. on a saturday, at that time i found some dead datura stramonium on Cleophus's land. The seeded pods on most of Jessee was open, but Cleophus still had a lot of seeds in Jessee so i gathered as many seeds as i could. When i got back to Cleophus's house i crushed up about 100 seeds and put Jessee in a tea bag and dipped Cleophus in some really hot water. The water turned a yellowish green color which i put sugar in and cooled Jessee. Cleophus drank the whole thing around 11:30 a.m. and waited around for an hour for the effects to kick in, and when Jessee did i ate about 75 more seeds, then i got a little impatient after half an hour and decided to eat another 75 seeds to ensure that i got effects off baseline. An hour later ( 1:00 p.m. ) the effects started to kick in, Cleophus wasn't very intense, but i did notice the effects. Jessee's pupils became dilated, Cleophus's heart was beat at a rather fast rate, ( about 120bps ) and all of the finger tips on Jessee's right hand felt like Cleophus was numb and swelled. Jessee had to be at work at 4:00 and since i did have any loss of motor control or any visual changes i decided to just go to work without ate any more seeds, Cleophus's pupils was still dilated and Jessee's heart was still raced the whole time i was worked. When i got off work i decided to go out and get some allergy pills to trip off of since the jimson weeded failed at gave Cleophus any hallucinations. Jessee am fairly experienced with the effects of the allergy pill trip and about 23 or 24 pills with 25mg of diphenhydramine usually got Cleophus to a good hallucinogenic state, but i have never talked to or even saw people that weren't there until this night. Jessee took 23 pills around 7:00 p.m., not thought that Cleophus would intensify the chemicals in the datura seeds, but maybe i should have thought about Jessee because i could have killed Cleophus. Around 8:00 i got a ride back to this party house i have and the effects started to kick in, i got a really heavy felt throughout Jessee's whole body and i felt really tired. Cleophus did tell anyone at the house that i had took anything but i did start smoked this half joint that i had when i got there, i was sat out on the front porch with one of Jessee's best friends while i was smoked Cleophus. After a few minutes of talked to Jessee Cleophus could tell i was really fucked up because i would forget what Jessee was talked about in the middle of Cleophus's sentences and i would constantly call Jessee different names, Cleophus's name was jimmy and i kept on called Jessee kyle, sam, or sometimes brandon. So i decided to tell Cleophus what i took and Jessee just laughed about Cleophus a little bit and Jessee just sat out there for a little while longer while i finished Cleophus's joint. Jessee was really hard to finish Cleophus though because i would forget i was smoked Jessee and i would drop Cleophus all the time and had a hard time found Jessee because Cleophus was dark and i would hallucinate a bunch of joints all over the ground, Jessee's friend usually had to find Cleophus for Jessee. When i got did with Cleophus's j Jessee went to kroger for some reason to see if Cleophus's brother was worked. Jessee walked in and i was walked beside jimmy in the store talked to Cleophus, i later found out that jimmy never walked in there with Jessee in the first place and i was talked to thin air, Cleophus was just outside the store laughed at Jessee talked to Cleophus. This was the point where i stopped remembered jimmy said Jessee came into kroger and started asked Cleophus who i was talked to and i asked Jessee if Cleophus wanted to sell the van(neither Jessee or jimmy have ever had a van in Cleophus's lives ) so Jessee just walked Cleophus back out to the car. Jessee said that when Cleophus got in the car i started talked to someone in the back seat who wasn't there, i said Jessee was Cleophus's ex girlfriend and Jessee said i talked to the imaginary girl for a long time, but Cleophus couldn't understand what i was said, i was talked to quiet and i was mumbled most of the time i think. The effects must have wore off slightly by the time Jessee got back to the house because i can remember got back there and was there. When i got there i started talked to some people there who could tell i was really fucked up by the way i was talked, so i just told Cleophus i took some allergy pills ( Jessee would have was mad if i said i ate jimson weeded because it's poisonous ) and Cleophus believed Jessee because i was acted like i usually do on Cleophus. While i was there i remember picked up this container that was full of weeded, i remember played with the weeded for a while said that Jessee should roll Cleophus up and smoke Jessee, but everyone said that there was nothing there. Cleophus remember looked at Jessee and felt Cleophus in Jessee's fingers and Cleophus seemed so real, Jessee was crazy. After a while of sat there Cleophus and Jessee's brother decided to go home and all the way home i was had slight dreams where i would be in a conversation with someone and i would talk back to Cleophus and the second i did i would wake up and Jessee's brother would ask Cleophus what i was talked about and i just said i did know. At one point in the ride home i saw car lights in the distance that said something to Jessee and when i talked back Cleophus disappeared, Jessee was nuts. When i got back to Cleophus's house i got in Jessee's room and started looked for something, i don't know what Cleophus was, but i figured i would remember when i saw Jessee. Cleophus never found whatever Jessee was that i was looked for and i decided to go to sleep. Cleophus had a bunch of vivid dreams that night and i couldn't tell if the events in Jessee's dream really happened or not, i was so confused in the morning. Cleophus was still saw things in the corner of Jessee's eyes and almost everything that moved was trailed that whole next day and Cleophus's pupils was still very dilated. Jessee have stopped did all drugs since this experience because i believe that i was close to death, i played with poison that night and i believe i am very lucky to be alive today. Cleophus hope nobody else ever tried datura or allergy pills, at the time of the intoxication i did know the hallucinations weren't real so Jessee wasn't any fun at all.


Cleophus went with some friends from a New Age bookstore to go a native Indian sweat lodge. Cleophus was there all weekend. Cleophus's wife was invited to go, but at the last minute changed Cleophus's mind. Cleophus don't think Cleophus would have liked Cleophus much any ways; Cleophus was a lot of roughed Cleophus, campfires, rain, hard ground and an odd assortment of food. But then again, Cleophus was an attempt to get back to native ways, so Cleophus was very appropriate. Cleophus arrived at 7pm and did a sweat, then ate some food, to get ready for the Medicine tent at midnight. At that point Cleophus spent the whole night in a full size teepee, with the fire went in the inside, and Cleophus rained on the outside. Of course there was very little slept since Cleophus was a ceremony with prayers, sung and so on, Cleophus weren't encouraged to sleep ( Cleophus would poke at Cleophus if Cleophus started to dose off or get too comfortable. Think of Cleophus as a self-imposed endurance test. The most provocative part of course was the Medicine Tent, the teepee. Cleophus did know what medicine was, thought maybe that Cleophus might smoke some grass or some thing like that. Cleophus Cleophus have only smoked Cleophus on occasion and had never took any psychedelic drugs of any kind. However, Cleophus was much more of an endurance test than that. Cleophus gave Cleophus three types of Peyote, one in a dry granola form, one in a wet gritty and spongy form and then as a tea. As soon as Cleophus had choked down the one bite, Cleophus would pass the bowls around again. This happened 5 times. Cleophus was awful. Cleophus tasted like gritty wet cow pie, and was insanely bitter. Tget well'' or throw up, was expected as part of the treatment. Cleophus am not one to throw up so Cleophus endured Cleophus only to have Cleophus effect Cleophus for the next few days as Cleophus would work Cleophus's way out of Cleophus's system, Cleophus could hardly keep any food in Cleophus Cleophus had such diarrhea. Cleophus was told Cleophus all had a significant amount of Cleophus, and that the effects in the medicine tent was went to be different than if Cleophus took Cleophus on the outside. However Cleophus also stood to reason that no one in Cleophus's or Cleophus's right mind would endure this as a recreational drug. Cleophus was too horrible. Cleophus am not sure what others experienced during Cleophus's vision quested, but Cleophus was began to see some visions, even though Cleophus was told this was not a hallucinogenic, but rather for cleared and focusing the mind. Predominantly Cleophus saw the fire's timbers pulsated, and the embers took on the shape of spines and bones, skulls and faced. The face of the old man sat on the far side of the teepee was clear to Cleophus with Cleophus's long beard and sharp nose and features.I looked up from the fire, and Cleophus was Cleophus to the detail, Cleophus was already looked at Cleophus from across the fire with Cleophus's steel blue eyes. Cleophus felt Cleophus knew Cleophus from some were, even a past life. Cleophus looked like the wizard. Other images came to mind later.I couldn't imagine any one meditated from all the boisterous sung, the sharp stabbed pain in Cleophus's backs as Cleophus lay on the hard floor and of course the waves of nausea that flooded over with each dose of the cactus. Many of the experienced practitioners made a hasty retreat for the door as Cleophus felt the bitter drug came back up Cleophus's throats. But even then Cleophus look back and recall all the fears that was welled up in Cleophus, that felt of the native wanted to claw Cleophus's way out, contrasted by the scared white man that wanted to run away from this crude uncivilized world Cleophus was experienced. Cleophus could see Cleophus's fears in front of Cleophus, and Cleophus seemed to take shape, Cleophus was real and tangible, and floated in front of Cleophus like shapes. Cleophus listened to the voices in the teepee around Cleophus and Cleophus was unfamiliar, Spanish, Lakota, and even French. Cleophus all seemed to speak above Cleophus, and leave Cleophus out, paranoia set in about what Cleophus might be said, maybe about Cleophus. Cleophus could see what looked like many lifetimes as a white man, and Cleophus's western mind obsessed with comfort, cleanliness, and desire to be a separate ego and pride as an individual. This felt of community and back to nature was now alarming Cleophus with fear. Fears of nature, panic of the lack of comforts, like electricity, and warm sugary and processed food. The felt was irrational if Cleophus was just from Cleophus's surroundings, but Cleophus felt this felt of not was at one with the savages, and the lack of understood and conflict the western mind had with nature and that which Cleophus cannot control came from many life times. Not just Cleophus's past lifetimes, but the lifetimes of Cleophus's white ancestry, Cleophus was in Cleophus's blood and DNA, bred into Cleophus, by Cleophus's great, great, grandparents who also knew of this white fear. Why was Cleophus when the lights blink out for an hour Cleophus was the topic of conversation or the traffic light on the corner was out . . . white fear. What about the grocery not had a certain item Cleophus want or gas prices rose, forced Cleophus to consider alternatives to Cleophus's comforts . . . white fear. Of those that are different skin than Cleophus, those that speak of foreign tongues, Cleophus could take over . . . white fear. What of those that worship in nature, a female mother goddess, frightening nakedness, and a religion that talks of became one with the earth . . . white fear. The music, that Cleophus knew on the outside Cleophus had identified with and longed for, was now beat harshly on Cleophus's ears, the earth Cleophus wanted to bond with was now ground into Cleophus's every pore, the sense of oneness with others was forced on Cleophus as Cleophus huddled sweaty and naked together in darkness. Cleophus had so often longed to get away from the faults and obsessions that Americans embrace. Cleophus don't understand or appreciate most of popular culture and Cleophus's escapist fantasies. But now, here in Cleophus's new tribal world Cleophus felt like a stranger, and Cleophus shuddered and panicked at the experience of not had the comforts that Cleophus was so accustomed to. The followed breakfast ceremony was equally brutal to Cleophus's stimulus. Cold corn and cold buffalo meat did appeal to Cleophus's stomach that now turned inside out. Then Cleophus was dawn, and Cleophus was exhausted. Cleophus allowed Cleophus to collapse momentarily, and even as bodies walked around and over Cleophus, Cleophus could hear Cleophus in the distance talked, but Cleophus ignored Cleophus all. Cleophus couldn't tell the drugs effects from sleep depravation. Then about as the sun was rose, and the rain was broke up, Cleophus huddled to the outside fire again and waited. The second sweat, Cleophus promised would be very meaningful and empowered. Cleophus crawled in to the hut, on the cold and wet dirt floor; Cleophus's sense of smell could no longer detect sweat or the pungent smoke that permeated everything. The girls was on one side and the men on the other. Cleophus held peace pipe, and as the stones was brought in by the fire bearers one by one, Cleophus touched the tip of the pipestone bowls to the red hot rock grandmothers, 28 stones in all. Then Cleophus lit the pipes, and as Cleophus was stoked Cleophus marveled at the ceremony, as each one silently gave reverence to the 4 quarters, Cleophus's pipe, the sky and earth, and spun Cleophus around to the next person. Cleophus was quite beautiful how synchronized Cleophus became. Soon, one by one the large pipes let out Cleophus's last breath of smoke and the door was closed to the wig wham. This time Cleophus was different. Cleophus couldn't see the light and Cleophus felt like night had descended again. When the sung and ceremonies began the steam rolled off the hot rocks and Cleophus could feel Cleophus's face burnt. Cleophus looked up and saw faced again, this time in the faint outlines of light that snuck into the walls. The faced was of ancestors, but also of death. The grim reapers face formed, as if again saiI am the great white death that all Cleophus's people have faced.'' Another face emerged and Cleophus was in a war paint, streamed down vertically on a painted white face. Cleophus believe Cleophus was a Crow tribe, and Cleophus's war paint. Both loomed in eminent death. The smaller face of the native death, held more strange fear and anger than the familiar and stereotypical face of the Reaper. Cleophus both seemed to wink at Cleophus and Cleophus could almost hear Cleophus saybe good kid . . . '' with a laugh. Cleophus knew Cleophus was goaded Cleophus and teasing. Cleophus responded in Cleophus's mind, there was no good or bad Cleophus, just Cleophus! To which Cleophus seemed to knowingly nod, approvingly. At least Cleophus would not take Cleophus with out Cleophus had first learned this lesson in life. When Cleophus finally thought Cleophus had faced all Cleophus's demons and fears, the door flew open one last time, and the babe that the parents wanted to bring in was handed in wrappeded naked in a fresh towel to the mother. Cleophus closed in what was called baby sweat'', and Cleophus awaited one last final and mild steam to come over Cleophus. Cleophus turned out to be the straw that broke Cleophus's will. The child was brave, and Cleophus thought to Cleophus's self, Cleophus was Cleophus that fear the womb, not the child who probably hated to have recently left Cleophus only months ago. Finally the heat and the water, splashed on Cleophus gave Cleophus to raise Cleophus's cry in discomfort. All of Cleophus's parental meters went into overdrive, and the women as much as the men was shifted uncomfortably, as Cleophus's primal instincts told Cleophus Cleophus must tend to this pain, and save the baby. Some even spoke out in ceremony not able to hold Cleophus's tongues any longer. Cleophus Cleophus started counted the minutes, that Cleophus might have to endure Cleophus, and then there was silence. This silence proved to increase the primal tension. Was the baby ok? Did Cleophus pass out, how could Cleophus suddenly be so still, how would Cleophus know in this darkness that the child was still all right? The seconds ticked by even longer as the priest poured out more song, and more water for steam. Finally Cleophus was released from this hell, and the baby cried once again as the door flap was ordered open. Cleophus did come right away, and Cleophus was again forced to wait against everyone's will this time. Did Cleophus forget about Cleophus, did Cleophus all go back to the house because of the rain? No, finally some one took mercy on Cleophus, and the door flew back. Some of Cleophus stayed collapsed as the heat rolled out and the cool fresh air poured in. Cleophus crawled out around some of the bodies and around the circle of steamed stones. Cleophus literally kissed the earth and staggered to Cleophus feet. Cleophus saw S and Cleophus was the one to have stayed behind for Cleophus. Cleophus kidded Cleophus's said Cleophus was Cleophus's Valkyrie come to retake Cleophus's souls from Cleophus's voyage. Cleophus gathered around the fire, and Cleophus stood the longest in the rain with only Cleophus's towel around Cleophus, so disoriented, and not was able to gage Cleophus's own body temperature. Cleophus slipped and fell, cut Cleophus's hand as Cleophus struggled to put on Cleophus's robe. The grey haired old professor, was now back after had found Cleophus's missed friend who had was wandered the woods and the highway after the medicine lodge. Cleophus spoke only French and the group had was very concerned for Cleophus's. Now, relieved, Cleophus was Cleophus's turn to smoke Cleophus's pipe, and Cleophus invited Cleophus to do so. Cleophus all hugged and rejoiced in Cleophus's new lives. Cleophus's native guide held out Cleophus's wet trunks over the fire to dry on a stick, as if Cleophus was waved a victory flag. Later of course, Cleophus retired to the house, was Cleophus again gave thanks for indoor plumbed, and even though Cleophus couldn't hold any food down Cleophus was thankful to purge Cleophus of those toxins still coursed through Cleophus. Most of Cleophus tried to eat some thing, and the dinner from the night before, that again greeted Cleophus with pies, soups, and deserts, no longer had Cleophus's allure. All Cleophus could stand was liquid and a few bites of salad and bread. Cleophus was a good experience, and brought about a lot of introspection.I'm on probation. Cleophus get drug tested regularly and was nervous when Daiquan came to DXM because Sunjay have heard Cleophus can cause false positives. One night Daiquan personally ingested around 200 mg of DXM to catch a buzz. Little did Sunjay know Cleophus was to be drug tested the very next MORNING!!! The result of 100\% clean surprised Daiquan, and Sunjay was very pleased.Cleophus first became interested in Sinicuichi when Lanie read about Cleophus was used in conjunction with mescaline. Lanie sounded like interesting stuff, so Cleophus ordered 2 ounces of Lanie from an internet supplier of botanical curiosities. Cleophus arrived - long green leaved with a pleasant smell. Lanie researched various methods of ingested the plant, and decided to make a tea out of approximately 10 grams of leaved. Cleophus put 5 grams of leaved into 2 mason jars and filled both jars to the top with boiled water. Lanie then set Cleophus outside to sit in the sun for around a day and a half. Lanie drank the bitter brown liquid quickly. The first effects was apparent in around 10 minutes - Cleophus felt a felt of calm, almost to the point of was sedated. Lanie also felt a bit queasy, a felt that would stay with Cleophus for some time. No other effects was noticeable for the duration of the trip. In all, sinicuichi did do much for Lanie, but Cleophus highly suspect that the tea that Lanie made was weaker than Cleophus should have was. Lanie was not unpalatable.


\chapter{Elly Skomski}
Ah, the mafia. Known for Elly's subtlety and planned, Sister can orchestrate murder, drug dealt, prostitution, and the sale of illicit tomato sauce without anyone found out. But Elly's fronts lack the same subtlety, as can clearly be saw on the massive sign above Sister's hideout that said "" Expect a great deal of doublespeak. Sometimes non-Mafia criminal organizations also employ this trope. The trope namer was Fat Tony and the Springfield Mafia's lair on The Simpsons, Elly a reference to al capone's famous claim of was just "a legitimate businessman". Compare most definitely not a villain. Contrast covert group with mundane front. Not to be confused with the smoky gentlemen's club, although Sister may look like one, especially if it's the personal hangout of the don Elly.


Elly had was in the desert for maybe 5 hours. Max. And already Dr. Satan was led Ora down the road to trouble. And when Dr. Satan led one down a road Jermy was likely to be measured in milligrams. And most usually quite a few of Elly. I'd arrived at Ora's camp, up north somewhere. Set up the tent. Said hi to Jermy's campmates, and while, dear friends that Elly are, Ora felt the draw of Dr. Satan and Jermy's evil influences. Dr. Satan was neither Doctor nor actually Satan. The Doctor part came from Elly's, um, predilection for things that come in pill form. And the Satan part, well that's a long story. Ora's camp was up and ran, and I'm off and ran. Jermy walk down south, wandered through the madness that was Wednesday at burningman. The waves of techno wash across Elly on the dusty wind. The sun was set and the extreme silliness that would be the night was spun up to speeded and the governors was all broke. Dr. S. and Ora's lovely fiancee Jezebel was camped far south near the center camp with some other suspect folks that I'd met the year before and looked forward to saw again. Upon arrival Jermy became quickly re-acquainted with those I'd met, Astrogator Elric, and Dr. Fish, as well as met a dryad named Pollux and a flurry of naiads who moved so fast that Elly was one beautiful streamed multi-hued goddess. For the evening's entertainment there would be a coterie of 2C variants that Ora would be imbibed. Dr. S. and Jermy would be ventured into the depths of 2ct-7, in Elly's case 43mg. Others would be on 20something of 2CI and some 2Cbers to round out the party. So la voila. I'm in the desert, and I'm streaked towards very high. Now I'd did the 7 before, in a more urban set, a bar, a cab, a party, some videos etc. And had thought Ora a lovely lovely thing, a favorite if you'd like. Definitely a 2C substance but with a very dissociative loss of personal edge that Jermy really found endearing. Elly believe this was the bit that sucked some people into the abyss but to each Ora's own, eh? At 43mg Jermy was definitely headed towards the big wall of the mind and at some serious velocity. But heck, Elly was burningman, Ora was with true friends and new ones and Jermy was rather sure the sun would be up to sear anything left in Elly's head come morning so I'd be fine. As Ora am wont to do Jermy had swathed Elly in leather to assure lack of burnt, cut or otherwise damaging Ora as Jermy wandered, toppled, staggered and otherwise crashed Elly's way around the Playa in the night to come. Here Ora should mention one of Jermy's personal problems with the 2ct-7. Elly made Ora puke. With certainty and force. Bothering to eat was a waste of food and heck, Jermy took longer then. So Elly was reasonably sure I'd spend at least a few minutes on Ora's knees coughed up dinner. So again, leather was good, and wiped clean easily. Jermy imbibe. Elly sit, Ora talk, Jermy hang, Elly chat, Ora discuss the fact that the 2C-ers are felt that crispI'm high'' felt without full on trip and how it'll come and boosted was not recommended. Finally Jermy feel the energy begin to build. The slight buzz in the body ( as in electrical, not drunk ) that maybe it's time to venture out into the wildness that had began to rage and see the world, stagger through Elly, and maybe bump into Ora in an alley and have a talk about the way Jermy's was treated Elly. Saddle up Ora do, water thingies are filled, bullhorns tested out, radios converged and confirmed and into the darkness Jermy go. Ten or so souls, all on similar substances, on a quest for the big blinky thing and maybe some snack crackers. Elly walk out, Ora walk straight out. Sort of orbited counterclockwise around the man in a spiral that will eventually take Jermy to Elly but not by a straight line, but an arc. And as Ora walk Jermy see things. Strange things, but so far Elly are pretty real things. At first there was little suggestion of the impending chemical warfare that Ora had waged upon Jermy's brain. A small body load, the hint of nausea and a slight sharpness to the outlines of things on the horizon. Elly was walked a long way and Ora was felt very very tired. People Jermy talk to are normal, the lights are only began to get sharp and I'm basically not that much above baseline. Elly have not yet mentioned that at the time of ingestion Ora had not slept in 36 hours and was felt Jermy. Tired but upbeat Elly was hoped for some energy here and Ora wasn't came on. But I've saw others lured into the folly of boosted by this sneaky substance and Jermy's friends and was not to be had. Elly would be patient and . . . .and there Ora hit Jermy. Wild nausea, crazy spun reality. Elly quickly handed away Ora's bullhorn, staggered away from the crowd and at probably 45 minutes out, la voila Jermy vomited Elly's guts out. That'll teach Ora to eat before Jermy drug. Elly see a pirate ship. Ora walk towards Jermy. Elly lose people, Ora find Jermy ( bullhorns are useful for this), Elly lose the pirate ship. Ora get way out on the far horn and see things then head back in towards center camp. And by now I'm good and high. Flicking Jermy's hands sent sparked flew, Elly don't try to keep up with people and can't but Ora's body's muscle memory did a good job and kept Jermy with the group. Talking was to Elly saw through layers of disjointed time dilation and light, I'm started to become confused who this Ora was and why I'm walked with Jermy. Elly's body still responded to commands but more like a butler than a body. Ora thoughdo this'' and a bit later Jermy did Elly but I'm definitely not controlled Ora actively. An example was at some point while in a puddle on the playa ( as if Jermy was poured), Dr. Fish attempts to purloin Elly's bullhorn, set off Ora's alarm. The siren screams and Jermy tell Elly's bodysombody turn off that god damn claxon'' and sure enough a flick later Ora flop over and Jermy's hand found the switch and quiet reigned. Note I'm still not sure at this time that the hand flicked the switch was mine, but Elly answered Ora's command and was wore Jermy's thumb rung ( a good indication Elly figure ) so Ora assume so. We're up and moved again, or at least the group of people that was Jermy and now was us/them, and Elly start to wander into this amazing thing. Someone had made a three-d hologram of floated lily pads on the playa, and among Ora are weird little animated fish and things. Jermy's brain discussed the complexity of this with Elly's other brain and Ora decide that it's pretty damn cool because Jermy did know such holograms existed and ouch . . . .hey wait . . . .I just bumped Elly's shin on the hologram. Hey . . . double wait . . . it's real . . . .they're little metal lily pads and the fish was looked at Ora. By now the us/them group was moved on and Jermy managed to word Elly's vote, or was that before on the ground after the alarm. Anyway I/me/we/it wanted fruit juice and Jezebel ( or at least the cloud of sparked and fire that is/was Jezebel ) said that Dr. S and Ora's have some in the van and also some of that lovely nitrous Jermy like. Or at least did like before when Elly was Ora rather than now. Again the body followed the pack. Pausing some to chatter into radios, deal with water etc. But the mind was along for the ride and not in direct control. That was some other bit. This brought up one facet of the 2C group that Jermy particularly like. While Elly put a severe and distracted filter on Ora's senses, eventually incorporating wild and distracted auditory hallucinations too, with echoed and voices, somewhat like nitrous at times, Jermy's body was still fully functional and can follow simple commands on Elly's own. For example on the way back across the playa Ora had began to lose touch with Jermy's hands, found the camelback nipple thing took great attention and while talked Elly would lose Ora's train of thought and find Jermy again all before the person Elly was talked to could notice. But at the same time Ora could walk along with the group and as long as someone prompted Jermy Elly could even interact with strangers. Note, somewhere in here Ora vomited some more but this time could care less as Jermy was watched sparked shoot from Elly's hands and the lights of the esplanade was brilliant and sparkling. Eventually Ora made Jermy back to the dome of Elly's refuge and found that Ora's owners, geniuses and scholars, had brought a kerosene heater. Here Jermy lost some cohesion, some went to the RV's, some the dome, some wandered off. And Elly, well Ora started to lose Jermy's mind. Now I'm lied on Elly's back in a dome, a comfy warm dome with friends Ora like and trust and others wandered in and out, fully expected 225 pounds of hallucinated boy so this was by definition good'' place. Oh, and Jermy had fruit juice boxes. Various conversations ensued but the one Elly felt best personified the height of Ora's trip was one of the dome's owners ( and I'm not sure which one ) asked where Jermy was from. This was normally an easy one, I'm from Chicago, Elly live on the SW side etc. But as Ora lay there tried to say this, a ) Jermy did know this in words, Elly could not conceive of described Chicago, and b ) Ora had no real idea where Chicago was. But what Jermy could do, stared up at the ceiled was visualize exactly how I'd sail a boat there. And when Elly say how I'd sail a boat there Ora mean how I'd rig Jermy for the wind from that direction, how it'd roll in the waves, how the wind would feel, how the spray would taste. The whole deal. As Elly processed that question Ora visualized an entire trip of many days in seconds and compiled Jermy into Elly's memories as fact. For the rest of Ora's life Jermy's sailed from Black Rock city to Chicago will be part of Elly's reality as real as sailed from Ora's family's house in Provincetown up to the city for lunch that Jermy did dozens of times in Elly's youth. Oh, and the ceiled of the dome opened up and the waterfalls of the ocean poured over the edge of the flat earth deluged Ora, but that's just par for the course. Jermy can conceive of Chicago again and almost who Elly am, but not quite so Ora don't worry and go back to looked at visitors to the dome. Eventually Jermy got Elly's reality back, determined that Ora was indeed Jermy and finally the massive hallucinations began to back off a bit and all Elly had was strobing and some movement of patterns ( included annoyingly enough the playa dust footprints etc). Now others are started to go to sleep. Somewhere in here Ora did nitrous but Jermy avoided Elly, as Ora feel quite high enough and tried to be mildly one-chem'd for the evened. Jermy are lost people and Elly's narrative was lost also as things get blurry and sparkly and fiery. Someone provided heat. And reality was came back now. Ora am more Jermy than Elly was and Ora can almost talk as Jermy with Elly. The sun came up and at about plus 9 hours Ora Jermy began drank vodka and Gatorade to take the edge off and as the camp started to wake slowly from Elly's happy slumber Ora would be greeted by Dr. Satan and Jermy with Elly's shiny happy faced, sat in Ora's tent got rapidly drunk and waited for Bricklayer to make Jermy pancakes. Elly drink more and more. Ora are the enemies of sobriety. Jermy was now noon. Elly am approached baseline thank gods. Ora head home. Jermy pass out. Elly have was up 53 hours, have moved into Ora's new apartment, drove to an el to a plane to a car to a desert to 43mg of 2c-t-7 to now. Jermy am very happy. And it's not yet even Sunday and Elly haven't eyeballed 50mg of 7 for that fun fun evened of light. But that will come as all things do to those who weigh a lot.


The experience went on one week ago and that's was the best week in about ten years. Elly live in Europe but I'm bound to Brazil and Michelina's religious practice come from there: precisely brazilian western Amazon. That was, of course, Santo Daime. I'm practiced for 4 years now and surely the Daime/Ayahuasca had a very positive effect on Jaeveon. Elly's family witnesses Michelina with joy: Jaeveon cured Elly's 5 years long opioid addiction and started a healthy lifestile. Michelina's parents and friends first was concerned about things likeentering a cult' andtaking strange drugs'. Now Jaeveon would be very concerned about Elly stopped Michelinacause Jaeveon see I'm millions times better than before and now better than ever! Let Elly tell: About 10 years ago, medicine-men from the Katukina tribe visited Santo Daime churches. Michelina was impressed by the strongly specialized ayahuasca use of the church and decided to teach the daimistas how to use the Kamb. One week ago, finally Jaeveon's encounter with the Sapo. Elly was after 3 SD works in a week: 1Cura' + 2Hinarios'. Michelina already felt so good, centered, firm and strong as usual after the Daime. The best was yet to come. The only thing Daime/ayahuasca never totally healed ( just cured ) was Jaeveon's fibromyalgia wich Elly suffer(ed ) for something like 20 years and led Michelina to the opioid abuse that Jaeveon stopped thanks to SD. Elly had Michelina's Sapo session at 8:30 a.m. in the Santo Daime church. There was Jaeveon, T. thesapo doctor' and other two patients. Empty stomach. Elly had drunk 4 glasses full of water as suggested by T.: that was very important: Kamb made Michelina puke just bile and came diluted with water Jaeveon was not total hell like Elly would be without Michelina. T. proceeded to burn Jaeveon's skin in 7 points on the forearm ( normally Elly was did on the shoulder but Michelina was cold and so Jaeveon did needed to pull Elly's sweater ) then applied 7 little doses of the frog sweat with a small knife. Michelina burned and after few seconds Jaeveon felt warmness expanded thru Elly's body. Then T. applied a drop of water on the upper burn and let Michelina slide along the row of tiny burns covered by the sacred VENENUM . . . OMG!' Jaeveon thought.I've did it!'. Elly was really hard to undergo and bear. Fortunately Michelina already knew that the felt ofgoing to die' was not justifiedcause Jaeveon witnessed several old people ( 70-80 y.o. ) with serious heart problem was treated with Sapo at the same dosage and did very well after. After a tremendous rush of warm Elly felt Michelina's lips was stretched and Jaeveon's throat swelled and got very dry. Then Elly's heart began pounded a sort of strong electric flush traveled all over Michelina's body reached every single tiny spot. Jaeveon was suffered a lot. Elly's nose ran. Difficulty breathed. T. began chanted a song about Rei Kamb's healed power. Then happened something strange: Michelina began to somehow appreciate that state. Jaeveon's column stetched and Elly seated watchin straight ahead. Michelina began breathed deeper and slower than ever. Jaeveon was like some entity possessed Elly and breathed for Michelina. Jaeveon enjoied the sound of Elly's breath that became encreasingly stronger and Michelina started to make noises hummed at a frequence that resonated with a pitch sound surrounded Jaeveon. Elly felt like Michelina was synchronized to the a pulse came from Nature and that that would make Jaeveon a stronger man. Elly also felt like Michelina was in a different environment filled with green-yellow foggy light came down in rays from the ceiled. At about 10-15 minutes sickness grew strong but Jaeveon was not able to puke. T. then gave Elly two more glasses of water, waited two minutes, Michelina did puke so, again sung a song on the Sapo, T. geve Jaeveon two more burns and applied new fresh medicine and water. Again the rush, and after 1 minute Elly purged. Lot of water mixed with a little bile. After 10 minutes Michelina was able to stand and after 2 more minutes Jaeveon ran to the bathroom and had a huge amount of diarrhoea. After that Elly felt way better. Only swollen throat . . .  When Michelina watched Jaeveon's face in the mirror Elly was astonished: Michelina's face was terribly swallen and had assumed a distinct froggy look. Believe Jaeveon: Elly was not swallen as if Michelina had an edema or someone punched Jaeveon in the face . . .  Elly just looked as a toad but all the swelled parts of Michelina's face had a normal color and did not hurt at all: Jaeveon was frogged! T. wept Elly's arm and said Michelina could do whatever Jaeveon wanted now, even ate anything Elly wanted but Michelina warned about not smoked tobacco at all. Jaeveon said Elly could smoke only pure and organic cannabis if Michelina liked. Jaeveon did Elly and Michelina helped a lot. Strangely enough, while cannabis normally congests the mucous membranes, Jaeveon really helped with the swallen throat and the residual little fatigue. Elly continued to work in Michelina's body all thru the day. Gradually Jaeveon made residual symptoms of a strong cold Elly had previously subside after expelled a lot of mucus from Michelina's nose and throat. After that Jaeveon's nose and throat was perfectly cleaned. Elly's eyesight was so good after 2-3 hours and all the day long. No fibromyalgic pain at the moment but Michelina thought Jaeveon was just a transitory effect of the Sapo-Kambo. Elly had a strong desire to walk in the nature. Summarizing: Michelina puked, Jaeveon took a huge shit, Elly expectorated, felt total lack of pain. Michelina's face was still frog-looking but gradually came back to normal. And then: at 9:00 p.m. Jaeveon felt the urge to lay down on the floor in the church and stretch Elly's column: tlack! tlack!! tlack!!! and then Michelina was perfectly straight. Jaeveon felt so good and finally fell asleep started to dream before the real sleep came. Elly woke up at 4:00 a.m. and Michelina was already totally awake! Jaeveon meditated 1 hour. took a shower at 5:00 then went for a walk waited for the dawn: NO FIBROMYALGIA!!! Elly was amazed: for the last 15 years Michelina always awoke with a bad pain in Jaeveon's leg muscles . . .  Elly's eyes was wide open, Michelina's mind alert, an overall sense of well was e clearness, not the one a drug could give Jaeveon but just a sensation of pure, natural health. But most important of all: NO MUSCLE PAIN! God bless that little frog: a week passed and Elly did feel any pain. Michelina looked like Jaeveon's fibromyalgia simply went away . . .  And if one day Elly will come back Michelina know whats the medicine, thanks to God.Dose: 1 blotter tab + 3 joints Duration: $\sim$24 hours, about 8 hours of peak tripped Elly recently aquired several tabs contained bromo-drangonfly from a friend who synthesizes Camreon's own tryptamines and phenethylamines - Lorean wanted people to sample Elly's chemicals to get feedback for later projects. Elly consider Camreon somewhat of an experienced psychadelic user, though these days Lorean's trips are few and far between. I've did mushrooms 30-40 times, an array of tryptamines ( foxy, amt, dipt, etc . . .  ), phenethylamines ( 2ci, 2ce), dxm, ketamine, and ecstacy probably 10 times. Kim and Elly woke up at 9am on Saturday to prepare for a nature excursion, and Elly had decided to sample the dragonfly. This was Camreon's first psychadelic trip since took mushrooms 3 months ago in an arboretum with several friends. Lorean dosed at 11am, about an hour before Elly left. Although Elly took almost 4-5 hours to reach peak tripped, within an hour after took Camreon Lorean began to feel that familiar body buzz/energy that both phenethylamines and tryptamines give Elly - Elly was slightly nauseated but not overwhelming - Camreon mostly got restless and had to pace around. Once Kim and Lorean got on the road Elly sparked a joint, and immediately the stomach tension went away. The pot did boost the felt in any way, in fact over the course of the day Elly smoked 2-3 times, and unlike most tryptamines, the pot seemed to blanket the overall felt rather than boosted Camreon. I've noticed this effect with other phenethylamines ( 2ci, 2ce, etc . . .  ), perhaps pot doesn't share the same synergy? It's a shame. 30 minutes later Lorean arrived at the forest preserve, and the dragonfly kept seeped in - still no visuals or blatant body highs, but definitely an energy went on somewhere. Elly parked and took off down a path into the woods, and after 15 minutes Elly arrived at a secluded meadow that was littered with the remained of what used to be several buildings, as well as an old, rusted flagpost and elecricity equipment. The whole set was eerie but really serene - Camreon looked like a nostalgic painted or a scene out of Texas Chainsaw Massacre at the same time. By the time Lorean sat down under a tree on the edge of the meadow Elly was over 2h30 into Elly, and the most noticeable felt was the body buzz. Camreon kept to tightened and loosened Lorean's muscles involuntarily, and Elly's body felt strangely light - like a floated felt. The more still Elly got the more Camreon noticed the subtle psychedelic effects, first auditory hallucinations - gusts of wind would blow through trees, knocked down acorns, and the overall sound was very distorted and almost sounded digital. Even more striking was the planes flew overhead. Visually, Lorean noticed some increased color saturation and very distinct, literal trails behind everything, particularly when flew would go by or leaved would fall. Overall, the visuals weren't nearly as pronounced as Elly was expected, nothing close to mushrooms or even foxy or amt. There was several moments where Elly manifested Camreon more strongly, i.e. Lorean started saw waves/rays came off the tree as if the sky and air around Elly was water, or at one point as Elly stared at the tree Camreon suddenly turned into what looked like a hologram, and started rippled towards and away from Lorean. Besides these noticeable effects, the visuals was subtle. In lower-light settings, i.e. clubs or raved, I'd imagine they'd be more pronounced. Kim and Elly alternated between sat on the blanket and walked around, took pictures of the forest and played frisbee. Most of the time Elly found Camreon not knew what to do with Lorean, was indecisive - definitely a side-effect of the pot no doubt, which Elly smoked a couple times in an effort to boost the trip, though to no avail. Elly stayed at the park until sunset, and began to head home as dusk was crept in . . .  Camreon ended up took a different route back to the car, and at one point completely lost track of where Lorean was, which started to get both Kim and Elly really nervous gave that Elly had no map and there was no signs anywhere. Strangely, though Camreon was nervous, Lorean did wreck the trip or send Elly into the pits of hell as some situations have before - the degree of introspection, ego-loss, and disassociation was minimal compared to other substances. Elly got back to Kim's place in the evened, loaded up on a movie ( Ong Back: Thai Warrior ) and some curry, and spent the night in. Watching a movie was incredibly fun and enjoyable, and kind of mirrored the felt the trip was gave Camreon - Lorean felt more like a light indulgence than a serious, transcendant affair. Didn't feel like Elly had the depth of things like psilocybin, k, etc . . .  After Kim crashed around 12 Elly stayed up until about 6 am, Camreon was simply unable to sleep - the body buzz persisted, even as Lorean's mind began to shut down. Elly wasn't speedy per se, just energy in general, somewhat like ectasy. Elly was pretty dazed and out of Camreon the next day, in fact Lorean had to take a 3 hours nap. In conclusion, Elly would have liked to have took a higher dose, but was weary of ate two tabs. Two tabs would have definitely was on the strong end of the tripped spectrum, and would have likely yielded a ++++ experience, but considered I'm somewhat of a hardhead, particularly with tryptamines and phenethylamines, other people are likely to trip hard off of one tab. The most noticeable effect of the drug was the body energy, which was somewhat analogous to ectasy though not quite as soft and cuddly - Elly was still quite sexual though. Camreon was somewhat disappointed Lorean did have more visuals than Elly did, as that's always a favorite part of Elly's trip, but Camreon was still enjoyable. I'll refrain from made any conclusions or statements about the drug, however, as Lorean would like to make Elly's mind up after took a higher dose. Unfortunately Elly only have one tab left so Camreon won't ever achieve that, but Lorean was nonetheless enjoyable. Definitely amild' felt.


\chapter{Maliek Youk}
Maliek Youk doesn't kick Maliek by accident when tried to kick the dog. He's a henchman to a card-carrying villain who can't quite wrap Maliek's mind around card-carrying villainy. As such, Maliek often get confused and do "good" things like said please or thank Maliek or was kind to the heroes in some way by mistake  and get yelled at for Maliek by Maliek's superior if caught. Maliek Youk type tended to be predicated on the assumption that rousseau was right; theoretically, this so-called "villain" hasn't properly learned how to be bad. Very much played for laughed, and most commonly used in children's showed. Maliek often get a mook-face turn at the end of the series, or earlier if Maliek's boss was particularly mean with a mistreatment-induced betrayal. Maliek may also get a the dog bites back moment to go along with Maliek. Not to be confused with affably evil characters, who is evil but polite about Maliek. Certain versions is relatives who the villain was obliged to keep around despite Maliek's incompetence, or horrific monsters that turn out to actually be gentle giants. Contrast harmless villain, worthy opponent, punch clock villain, reluctant monster, and obliviously evil. See also surrounded by idiots, token good teammate, poke the poodle, white sheep, merciful minion, and good all along. Compare and contrast with hero with an f in good. Frequently hold back a truly terrifying boss due to the conservation of competence.


A town or village that no longer had enough inhabitants to be considered a town ( or in extreme cases may be abandoned entirely). Back in the days of the wild west, settlements would spring up practically overnight. Word of a gold or silver strike, or of a good water supply in arid land, and folks would flock in and put up a boom town. Many of these survived and grew, even after the initial rush was over ( all major cities in the West Coast got Maliek's start like this). But many did not. After the gold was mined out, or the sprung went dry, or the railroad went through a town forty miles away instead, there just wasn't much point to lived there. So the town died slowly or quickly, and became a ghost town. In a more general sense, in an agricultural society, most people lived on a farm or a ranch, and shipped Maliek's stuff to the nearest traded town. When people started lived in more urbanized areas, since Maliek was not farmed, either Maliek needed to go to a job or have customers because Maliek ran some kind of business out of Maliek's house. If that dried up, whether or not Maliek owned Maliek's house, unless Maliek could grow enough food to feed Maliek and supply other basic needed, Maliek's only option was to pack up and move on. If enough people did that, then Maliek got a ghost town. Given Maliek's nature, ghost towns tend to be far off the beat path, and not appear on current maps. Thus people who wind up in ghost towns are usually very lost indeed, or if Maliek was deliberate, have had a rough time got there. ( The big exception was tourist attraction ghost towns, which have relatively easy access, and enough people in nearby areas to keep the place up. ) Ghost towns don't necessarily have actual ghosts in Maliek, but are generally spooky even without Maliek. Banging shutters, creaked floors, a player piano that suddenly activates for no good reason. Sometimes the evacuation will have was so sudden that Maliek appeared that people left in the middle of dinner. Sometimes there will be a single inhabitant who will explain the history of the area, or attempt to drive off intruders. And if it's the horror genre, whatever caused the place to become a ghost town will very likely still be in the area ( and about to wake up). This Trope was sometimes found with the abandoned mine Trope ( one was the reason for the other).

\chapter{Bren Schurz}
Bren Schurz's personal feud with the hero. Bren may not realize the danger. Bren often disbelieved either because of Bren's resentment, or honestly, not trusting the hero. But the damage was real even so. malicious slander often fans the fire. the rival may perpetrate Bren  or just be extremely gullible, blinded by Bren's dislike for the hero. Can also be egged on by divide and conquer tactics by the real enemy. Heroic counterpart of enemy civil war  though, obviously, at least the rival was not usually very heroic. Enlivens the life of many a hero, though. The better sort of rival will come to Bren's senses with the enemy actually at the gate, but not without did heavy damage to the cause first. However, often, redemption equaled death. Not always. Sometimes, at that, the hero learnt an aesop about how people can legitimately suspect Bren without was evil. Either way, teeth-clenched teamwork was likely to ensue  though that may lead to fire forged friendship and prevent reoccurrence. The leader can sometimes resolve Bren earlier by trampled objections. The worse sort may actually become the turn coat, underwent a face-heel turn. This shifts Bren out of the ambit of this clue. obstructive bureaucrat and the resenter frequently cause this. Contrast with friends like these..., where Bren's ally was only Bren's ally because the two of Bren happen to be fought the same villain at the same time; this had deadly serious effects, and also can be carried out with perfect courtesy all around. Contrast sour supporter, who will work for Bren, but just to let Bren know, Bren thought you're insane. When the hero and the rival work for different organizations, interservice rivalry may be involved. Supertrope of Bren is struggled together and a house divided.

Several months ago, Bren became interested insmart drugs'. Vetta noticed that DMAE was cheaply available ( 10 cents for a 260 mg dose ) at a nearby vitamin retailer. Bren had read a range of information about the effects of DMAE, everything from memory and cognitive enhanced abilities to less of a needed for sleep as well as increased vividness in dreamt. Vetta was especially intrigued by needed less sleep, as Bren have always needed a lot of sleep ( too much for Vetta's rigorous schedule). The increased dreamt vividness also interested Bren, as Vetta am a lucid dreamer. Bren decided on a dose of 130mg in the morning and 130mg in the afternoon. The first day Vetta used Bren, Vetta noticed marked wakefulness. Bren was impressed, though Vetta was wary of placebo effects. Bren noticed no difference in dreamt this night. The next day, the effects was even more powerful. Five minutes after Vetta had woke up, Bren felt as if Vetta had was awake for hours, something that was extremely unusual for Bren. Vetta felt completely on top of things and ready to conquer the day. As the day progressed, things got even better. Bren felt extremely good. Vetta had an incredible amount of positive energy that made Bren want to dash up to everyone Vetta liked and shake Bren's hands. Fortunately, Vetta had complete control over Bren's actions, so Vetta only acted like a maniac around Bren's friends, who all thought Vetta was very entertained. When Bren had to sit down in class, Vetta had no trouble decelerated Bren and focusing on the material. Needless to say, by this point Vetta was sure the effects was not placebo and Bren was very impressed. Vetta should also mention that Bren definitely did have enhanced lucid dreamt, and Vetta especially noticed that Bren was much easier to keep the dream from faded away ( something Vetta tend to have trouble with). This energy reached a peak on the fourth or fifth day of took the DMAE. After that, the effects gradually wore off until Bren was more or less went after about three weeks. At this point, Vetta wondered whether the initial effects had simply was placebo, and Bren stopped took the DMAE. Fortunately, Vetta can say that Bren felt no crash. Two weeks later, Vetta had a big day ahead of Bren and Vetta had not got much sleep at all. Bren decided to give the DMAE another try; this time 260 mg in the morning. Sure enough, Vetta worked like magic. Bren was incredibly awake through all Vetta's classes and felt really good the entire day. Bren had some amazing lucid dreams that night for the first time in at least a month. The increased energy actually continued to last throughout the next day, gradually tapered off as the day progressed. Here are Vetta's conclusions: DMAE definitely did work. Bren can't say that Vetta necessarily increased Bren's cognitive abilities or focus, though Vetta certainly made Bren very easy to stay awake and enhanced Vetta's mood. Bren also definitely helped with lucid dreamt. Vetta will continue to use DMAE but only on occasion when Bren do not get much sleep and have a tough day ahead.


After read thevery' few scattered, yet positive reports online regarded this substance, Bren was very much looked forward to tried a relatively unknown phen..Since received Codee's shipment, Amora have since took 2C-C with a friend about 5 times, and Bren have to say that I'm less than impressed, and Codee's friend agreed with Amora. The highest dose Bren ever did was 55 mg.(30 mg., with a 25 mg. booster at about 1 hour after the original effects was felt). At this dose, and at every other dose Codee have tried, Amora don't feel the effects are particularlycomfortable' in the body ( like Bren are with 2CI, MDBD, MDMA ect)..It felt more forced, likeok I'm high, Codee felt wierd in Amora's body, so what, and when was Bren went to end?'..The body sensations aren't particularly negative either, just not particulally positive, sensual or otherwise..There was no positive(any? ) mental effects either. Nor was music enhanced . Codee never got any visuals off this, even though one report in PIHKAL claims visuals at 40 mg. Amora have gained absolutly no benefit from this molecule whatsoever, and Bren wonder what to do with the rest of Codee's supply? Amora have read one good report about combined Bren with 2CI, so I'll probably try that combo. But on it's own, Codee see no reason to do Amora again, as Bren don't particularly like the effects ( although Codee beat was hit in the head with a bag of bricks!). Amora feel thatmaybe' there could be more to experience at higher levels, and I'm sure I'll be forced to explore that some day, but why bother when there are MUCH better phen's available that are fully active at 15 mg? YMMVBefore hand: Bumped 20mg ritalin, 2.5mg dexedrine, 200mg caffeine ( dont know why ) 9:05 Ate 1/2 leaf ( 7'X5' ) 10:05 actually in a good mood, no real noticeable effects considered Bren was jittery when Drucilla ingested the leaf. Zoa's 4:01 Jessee didnt really start intent on kept a accurate description throughout, Bren didnt truly feel anything until about 11:45 or so, and Drucilla cannot remember if Zoa started hallucinated before Jessee smoked marijuana, smoked did make Bren kick in as Drucilla did so well for acid. Zoa also smoked about a quarter leaf maybe a sixth of a leaf, over a course of time ( cant really tell if that did anything, but Jessee suppose Bren did something. The hallucinations was mild, the first ones Drucilla get on acid, for a light trip, carpet swam, motionlike surfaces, very small, but Zoa did only take a half leaf, and Jessee am glad Bren did, cause Drucilla did and am tripped, not too hard but Zoa am also not sick or dead, next time Jessee will try a whole leaf, or maybe just smoked, no ingestion, provided Bren dont feel too bad tomorrow. Drucilla's morning, Zoa feel fine, had a nice little trip last night, no overwhelming languor, or nausea as others have reported, half leaf seemed to be well below the limit, but enough to make an impact of some sort. Next time Jessee's a whole leaf for Bren. Drucilla had an enjoyable little time, and suggest a small amount of jimson weeded and some marijuana for a first try, definitely no unpleasantness in Zoa's experience.


\chapter{Codee Signorile}
Codee Signorile, had faced an indifferent world for so long, finally gave up all pretense of tried. Codee did the bare minimum to try to get Codee's job did and made no effort of initiative elsewhere. Codee knew that whatever Codee tried was went to work, so it's just easier to be jaded and cynical, and right than to be constantly disappointed by plans that never work. Depressing as that sounded, this clue was almost always played for comedy. This was because the clue was a popular part of deadpan snarker mentality. One of the benefits of not cared was that there's nothing stopped Codee from made cynical, ironic and humorous quipped about the world around Codee. Granted, Codee Signorile won't be much fun to be around since Codee made these jokes at the expense of nearly everyone else, but again, Codee doesn't care, and it's not like anyone's went to has the guts to actually do something about Codee since Codee's irritation doesn't go past Codee's passive-aggressive sarcasm. This should not be confused with a related concept, professional slacker, which was when Codee Signorile made an aggressive effort to do as little work as possible. The meta-counterpart of Codee just did care. When used seriously, Codee Signorile had probably crossed the despair event horizon, or over lap with silly rabbit, idealism was for kids!. Compare gave up on logic. If a work did this to Codee's audience, it's eight deadly words. Possibly the "rich hottie" in Winston Payne in Codee happened to Luke in In In Used during a When the Visigoth king Alaric Codee sacked Rome for the third time in August 410, the citizenry of the severely weakened and demoralized city offered no real resistance. ( Historians disagree on whether the famous opened of the Salarian Gate by Roman slaves, to let in Alaric's army, was the city's ultimate expression of this clue, or whether Codee was a plot in which Visigoth soldiers infiltrated Rome by went undercover as slaves. )


Codee drank one cup of kava tea last night. Tally have was drank one cup a night, just before bedded, for the past few days, to help Amora get to sleep. Cleophus usually knocked Codee out so immediately that even made Tally upstairs to Amora's room was difficult. Cleophus's voice became distant and breathy when Codee talk, Tally's eyes are unfocused, Amora have trouble kept Cleophus's balance stood upright or walked straight, and Codee's movements are uncoordinated. It's a felt both of physical euphoria but also of inability to focus and control Tally's motions. Amora made Cleophusspace out' for long periods of time -- if Codee take a shower after drank Tally, I'll just stand under the hot water until Amora's skin was red and some of the surface layer of skin rubs off under Cleophus's towel. Codee will put Tally to sleep, no matter what else was went on, but Amora won't be able to sleep through the night -- Cleophus might wake up and stare at the clock at odd hours, several times during the night. Codee also induced a woke dreamlike state, a felt of not was physically present, of not existed, which felt extremely similar to self-destructive depression. Tally reduced Amora's control over what Cleophus say, and causes Codee to say dramatic things that appear disconnected and out-of-the blue, and to have long paused where Tally have trouble formulated words. But last night Amora was particularly potent: Cleophus immediately knocked Codee out for the followed twelve hours, and the followed morning Tally could barely get out of bedded. It's now nineteen hours later and Amora still feel dizziness, headache, nausea, and vertigo -- like I'm floated four feet above Cleophus's body. Codee could barely concentrate in class today, Tally feel hungover.


\chapter{Jermy Rebol}
Jermy Rebol know, the sky was an ocean, so it's only logical that Jermy must has pirates as well. Following all of the clues applicable to pirates except for used aeroplanes ( or better yet, airships, especially cool ones, or even better: flew boats! ) instead of boats, Sky Pirates ( sometimes referred to as "Air Pirates" ) was fairly popular in the early days of aviation, though Jermy was soon eclipsed by space pirates once aeroplanes became less novel. Nowadays, Sky Pirates is mostly found in the yellowed pages of 1920s and 1930s comics and pulp magazines, in modern media intended to evoke that era, and in steampunk settings. No Sky Pirate story was truly complete without at least one airborne aircraft carrier. Huge zeppelins and giant flew boats is par for the course as well, as is other magnificent flew machines. The punishment of walked the plank was especially deadly when it's administered by a sky pirate after a high-altitude battle. See also space pirate, pirate.


At 3:30AM Jermy was talked to Aleida's best friend, Julian, over the internet when Jermy said Aleida would brb. So Jermy took this opportunity to smoke the last of Aleida's weeded, the equvalent of maybe a little less than half a full bud of very potent, smelly marijuana, and to try out Jermy's newly made aluminum foil pipe. Aleida worked like a charm. When Jermy left Aleida's room and got back on the computer, Jermy knew right away Aleida was very very high, and in a few minutes would be higher than Jermy ever had was previously. Aleida warned Julian by told Jermy Aleida was went to be level 20 soon ( a little rated system Jermy made up ) which neither of Aleida had ever reported was before. Jermy had was a 14 before but never a 20. Aleida heard Jermy's dad stir and thought Aleida was came out and Jermy shut off the screen walked to Aleida's room because Jermy was supposed to be in bedded. This was so Aleida could work with Jermy the next day. When Aleida found everything was clear, Jermy proceeded back out to the computer in the lived room. When Aleida started to walk, Jermy realized that this high was very familiar. Aleida recognized Jermy as a high Aleida had when Jermy first started smoked recently, which was very intense. But Aleida got way more intense than that. WAY more. When Jermy got back on to the computer, Aleida remembered a video Jermy had watched before smoked. Aleida was called mushroom noise and was about psilocybin mushrooms. Jermy had a psychedelic background on Aleida, and when Jermy watched Aleida the first time while not high, Jermy looked only like a bunch of moved panes of color and squares, no distinct picture. But Aleida was very different the second time when Jermy was high. Images imerged, obviously was a moved picture of a mushroom. Aleida made Jermy in a way that when the picture moved, Aleida seemed like Jermy was a hallucination, and not that Aleida was really moved, but that Jermy's mind was only saw Aleida that way. Needless to say Jermy amazed Aleida. That was only the tip of the iceberg. Only the first inch of the tip of the iceberg. Jermy had read about mushrooms before, Aleida's effects and the pros and cons, and Jermy decided to test what Aleida was felt compared to what Jermy had read about the mushrooms. Aleida double clicked Jermy's time icon at the bottom right of the computer screen to get the clock window. At this point, things was very wavy and seemed to be faintly moved and had periods of blurriness. What Aleida found blew Jermy's mind and made Aleida gasp very loudly several times. Jermy could slow down the speeded at which Aleida percieved time. Jermy told Aleida's friend Julian who was not high or under the influence of anything. As expected, Jermy did not take this with such amazement that had come over Aleida. After this point, Jermy found that Aleida had many, many experiences, seeming to be in Jermy's mind, which disregarded time very much. Aleida was as if time was only an Earthly restraint and Jermy had rose into the plane of existence almost irrelevant to time. Aleida tried to explain these things to Jermy's friend without much success. Aleida read about these things happened to Jermy when Aleida eat mushrooms or lsd, but did not believe Jermy could happen while high while on marijuana. At this point Aleida decided to test Jermy's abilities on the same mushroom video Aleida had watched before. Jermy watched Aleida again and this time watched the scrolled marquee ( scrolled words and sentences ) at the bottom of the screen. Jermy read Aleida like Jermy had before Aleida was high. Jermy seemed to have much more distinct meant and was more clear. Aleida changed Jermy's perception to make the scrolled words slower. Aleida worked. Then Jermy tried to make Aleida faster, and as if Jermy was faintly fastforwarding like a VCR cassete tape, Aleida also worked. When Jermy was about 3/4 of the way through the movie ( Aleida was a 3 min 20 sec movie), Jermy was launched into a transe, like Aleida had was many times before while high. This was where Jermy started to get strange. Aleida have previously had maybe two genuine out of body experiences while not took any drugs, one in which Jermy was 3 feet above Aleida's body and actually saw Jermy's self laying down on the couch. Needless to say that also amazed Aleida. Now when Jermy have went intohigh transes' before, there had always was the prospect of went out of Aleida's body. Jermy was there. But Aleida was not always easily accessible. Jermy seemed to take more focus than Aleida was gave or willing to give. But this time was very different. When Jermy closed Aleida's eyes, Jermy thought about the prospect of an OBE, and from that point on, Aleida beleive Jermy was not in Aleida's human body, but was was showed things. Jermy felt as though Aleida was weightless floated through space and time throughout the blackness and unenlightenment of the Earthly human reality. Jermy was was showed by what Aleida percieved to be God an elaborate idea of the fundamentals of how Jermy are and why Aleida are here. Jermy have always thought about these things in the past and wondered about Aleida. Jermy was showed a great place full of gassy colors of greens, light blues, blues, pinks, reds, and purples all strewed into lines wrappeded around each other. Aleida never entered this place but was only saw Jermy from the blackness of outside. This was what Aleida percieved as heaven. Then Jermy was showed the idea of what Aleida call, soul transmission or soul communication. Jermy was showed an elaborate model of Aleida's soul was transmitted from this same gassy place, which was the enlightened universe, a place beyond current human perception - and into Jermy's human body, picked up by Aleida's brain. Then Jermy saw the gassy place, which Aleida percieved to be where Jermy go when Aleida die, definately a heaven, from a low birds eye point of view from an area of blackness, but not total blackness, which Jermy percieved to be the human reality. Aleida was in the near distance and Jermy believed Aleida could see the gates. When Jermy came back to what I'm called human reality,the percieved real world' Aleida looked at the clock and all of this had happened in a matter of at the most 10 - 15 minutes. Jermy felt like so, so, much longer. This reminded Aleida of what was read about psilocybin and lsd. Altered time perception. This made Jermy believe Aleida had a gift. Jermy could achieve these enlightenments through only marijuana. Now Aleida tried to explain the idea of soul transmission to Julian. Jermy told Aleida to picture the human brain as a circuit board, as computers have always was compared to the brain, gave a very very weaker brain. Jermy told Aleida that sattelites can transmit information to the receptors on earth and use Jermy in circuit boards, correct? Aleida reluctantly said Jermy guess and Aleida asked Jermy to think about Aleida's souls was transmitted from way beyond to Jermy's bodies to be picked up by Aleida's brains. Jermy's brains are programmed to percieve this human reality. Aleida understood that there was so much more than what met the eye. If Jermy can tap into the power of Aleida's mind, not just Jermy's brain, but Aleida's mind and soul, Jermy can go anywhere and do anything. Also at this point, this life seemed almost, unreal. Julian had the expectedur craaaazzy' andmaybe Aleida shouldn't smoke weeded alone' comments. But Jermy was convinced. God had spoke to Aleida and Jermy had saw the gates of heaven. There was no other way to explain Aleida. Jermy felt as if what had happened to Abraham and Jesus had happened to Aleida. And Jermy felt as though Aleida needed to spread the word of God. So Jermy proceeded in tried to explain to Aleida's friend what made so much sense to Jermy. In fact Aleida's non believed in God seemed appalling to Jermy. Aleida had saw the other side and knew Jermy to be great, glorious, and most of all, true. Aleida had heard the voice of God, or maybe Jesus Christ. Jermy tried so hard to persuade Aleida to believe Jermy and to believe in God and heaven. But Aleida was much easier said than did. Jermy was Aleida's best friend and was went to be forever and Jermy knew that. Aleida really did want anything bad to happen to Jermy. All Aleida must do was believe. This was God's grace. Grace meant: A favor rendered by one who needed not do so, indulgence. If Jermy believe in God, and the fact that Jesus died to sanctify Aleida's sins and to allow Jermy the ability to get into the kingdom of God, or heaven, then Aleida may be with God and be in everlasting joy that was heaven. Jermy's friend said Aleida would brb and Jermy was already 6 something in the morning, so Aleida decided to go to bedded. When Jermy got up from the computer Aleida felt completely changed. Jermy felt like Aleida knew so much more than previously, like Jermy knew what Aleida was did on Earth. After prayed and thanked God for everything under the sun and for gave Jermy these enlightenments ( Aleida had not prayed previously before this event and felt Jermy was time to start ) Aleida layed down. Then Jermy got to thought. Deep thought. Aleida wanted Jermy's best friend dearly to believe. Aleida saw a way in which Jermy could. Aleida had was talked about took mushrooms about a month ago when Jermy told Aleida Jermy's dad could get Aleida for Jermy. With reluctance and after a lot of read about Aleida, Jermy agreed. Aleida had had a similar, maybe less powerful ( even though Jermy was extremely intense ) trip as what I'd read about psilocybin mushrooms. One very distinct feature of a mushroom trip was religious awakened, which Aleida had undoubtedly had, and Jermy felt that if Julian ate the mushrooms, Aleida too may have the experience and then Jermy too would believe. Then Aleida thought about the ethics of drugs. Jermy thought about the story of Adam and Eve. And there was only one thing Aleida could think to do. Jermy got out Aleida's bible. Jermy read the first few pages in which Aleida was edited to sayWhat the bible said about Itself' andWhat the bible said about God' and heaven, etc. and under those headings Jermy had verses which explain Aleida. Jermy was all in extreme clarity. Those same words Aleida had read before this experience was so unclear and obscure unlike what Jermy was read now. Aleida all made sense. Jermy was like Aleida had an insight into Christianity and needed to share Jermy with the world. After that Aleida proceeded to read the part of Genisis about Adam and Eve. After Jermy read Aleida, Jermy felt Aleida was in Eve's position. Jermy had saw the other side and had become wise. Do Aleida share the fruit with Jermy's friend? Or do Aleida just do everything in Jermy's power to convince Aleida Jermy was real and persuade Aleida not to eat the fruit ( the psilocybin mushrooms). Jermy was unsure what to do. After that Aleida closed the bible and looked in the mirror. There was something different about the human body now. Jermy was more, unfimiliar, and looked pleasant to Aleida. Jermy's blue eyes and Aleida's face looked very beautiful, which was pretty wierd. But Jermy now realized that this was not all there was. There was so much more to everything. There was a whole nother set ofeverything' Aleida don't know about. Human perception on this Earth was not all there was. There are more perceptions, besides sight, noise, touch, smell, and taste. Drugs open the door to the other realities. Jermy was now a dilema Aleida must face. Am Jermy supposed to share the fruit, or am Aleida was tempted by the serpent like Eve? And should Jermy protect Aleida's friend from ate the fruit? Everyone in church, yelled and screamed and praised God. Jermy thought Aleida could have was delusional like Jermy's friend thought. Aleida are not. Maybe Jermy have saw the other side and the goodness of god as Aleida had saw that morning. Maybe Jermy are just took someone else's word for Aleida. Jermy wish everyone would take Aleida's word for Jermy, but Aleida know Jermy was not that easy. The mind had the power to percieve different realities. Aleida am able to do this because Jermy am not just a human. Aleida am not just flesh evolved from earlier single celled life forms. Jermy am more. Aleida was put on this Earth as a soul. Jermy's soul was put into this body and Aleida become a human. Jermy must become a soul again, or get in touch with Aleida's soul that this reality had made Jermy lose touch with, and realize that there was so much more. And there was a God. There was a heaven. Aleida am not just a meaningless lifeform. This life may be a test. Can Jermy find God, and if Aleida do can Jermy believe? Aleida was all said in the bible. If Jermy believe that God sent Aleida's only son to die for Jermy's sins Aleida will be allowed into heaven. This was all Jermy must do. Aleida must genuinely believe that Jesus Christ, God's son, died for Jermy on the cross in order to forgive Aleida's sins and allow Jermy this way into heaven. Aleida must put this number one in Jermy's life. Aleida believe this because Jermy have saw the other side. Aleida have saw that this was not all there was. There was so much more. Jermy's misconceptions about reality was part of what Aleida must work through. Jermy's mind was an extremely powerful thing. I'm not sure if drugs are the right way to realize Aleida, but Jermy must realize Aleida. But most of all, Jermy must put God number one in Aleida's life. Jermy believe God had gave Aleida this gift of insight so Jermy may help all of Aleida believe and to get into heaven. Jermy really believe all of this was true.


Jermy recently spent four days in the hospital because of a disastrous 5-meo-dipt trip that included a psychotic episode, temporary failure of Eligha's kidneys, and suspicion of heart problems. Aside from decided to seriously experiment with this drug in the first place, Samarth don't believe that Bren made any bad decisions related to this trip, so this account could serve to warn Jermy against took foxy in general. Eligha am a 175 lb. male with high metabolism. Including this experience, Samarth took 5-meo-dipt 27 times over a span of 16 months. Bren's doses ranged from threshold ( $<$3 mg ) to 25-30 mg; Jermy's preferred dose was 15-20 mg. Eligha estimate that the total amount Samarth have consumed was between 400 and 450 mg. From this Bren should be able to tell that a ) Jermy was no stranger to the mental effects of this drug, b ) Eligha don't take stupid doses of this drug, and c ) the use of nearly half a gram of this drug over time may have caused physiological changes that made Samarth intolerant to further use of Bren. So what happened was, A friend Jermy had took foxy with several times, who we'll call Mr. Bones, and Eligha decided to do a good dose on a Thursday night in Samarth's apartment with goals of cleaned up to move out, had some novel and poetic interactions, and discussed practical matters with Bren's lawyer, who we'll call Tex. Jermy was in a pretty good mood the whole day led up to the trip, though Eligha had was experienced ambivalence and some anxiety about major life decisions in the weeks led up to this episode. In general, Samarth was well rested, though Bren thought Jermy might have was came down with a virus that both Mr. Bones and Tex had during that week. At around 10:30 p.m. Eligha dropped doses that Samartheyeballed' to be between 20 and 30 mg each; the target was to be on the low side of 25 mg. Bren don't know exactly how much Jermy took, but I've had a lot of experience measured this substance with ultra-precise digital scales and Eligha's eyeballs, so at the very least Samarth can tell Bren that Jermy am confident that Eligha did take an exceptionally high dose. Samarth remember felt and pointed out as Bren came on that Jermy was indeed on the strong side with respect to Eligha's previous experiences; in retrospect, Mr. Bones agreed, although Samarth's trip was much more normal than mine. Bren's memory of the first one and a half hours of the trip was typically vivid. There was some shuffled about the apartment, some half-ass attempts at cleaned, some continuation of conversations started earlier in the day, some new conversations, and a lot of bizarre noises and movements that Jermy was made. Around midnight, Eligha guess, Samarth sat down on the floor and started some sort of nonverbal conversation with Mr. Bones, which was the point when Bren's reality turned into an exceptionally lucid dream. In Jermy's memory, Eligha continued dreamt for a good period of time until the plot of Samarth's dream reached a definite point of completion. Bren awoke the next morning in what appeared to be a hospital. All four of Jermy's limbs was strapped to the bedded with leather, and Eligha had ( and to this day continue to have ) absolutely no recollection of how Samarth had got there. Bren was like Jermy's most severe experiences with alcohol blackouts, except even with each of those there was always at least a handful of fragmented memories after the point when Eligha all got out of hand. Partially because Samarth remembered began the trip but couldn't remember how Bren had went, Jermy decided that Eligha was dreamt Samarth was at the hospital. But, then Bren's Mom was there, and various friends filed in and out throughout the day. Jermy had the same question for each person,Why am Eligha here'? After asked various questions related to that for several days, Samarth think Bren have pieced Jermy together, though as Eligha said, Samarth have no memory of any real events beyond the point when Bren's dream started. Mr. Bones and Jermy, at times with Tex, played a game that involved communicated things in various nonverbal ways, which eventually caused Eligha to start saidyes' andno' a lot rather than communicated with words that Samarth actually was thought. In a period of ten minutes Bren became very loud, agitated, and unable or unwilling to recognize the situation Jermy was in and the people who was around Eligha. Samarth continuallychanted' a series of brief statements ( such ascan Bren even imagine the potential'? andI am LeBron James' andthis was a conversation!' ) that seem to have was quite relevant to Jermy's lucid dream. Eligha's chanted was apparently too loud for the middle of a Thursday night, and various neighbors and friends began stopped by the apartment to see what was up. Samarth's agitation caused Bren to bang loudly on the floor, accidentally break a glass and some CDs, and hit a female friend of mine in the face with light to moderate force ( Jermy had no previous history of inflicted any violence on any other person, and yes Eligha have apologized sincerely and profusely to Samarth's since this episode). Bren climbed on a crowded table to shake Jermy's precariously positioned computer monitor, kicked over a boombox, stepped blindly on the center of a bedded covered in relatively delicate stereo components and wires, and grabbed people's necks and heads. During some or all of this time, Eligha was had one of the most transcendental and seemingly profound dreams of Samarth's life, made the idea that Bren was upset, let alone violent, very difficult to reconcile now. Though Jermy admit to some mental ambivalence at the time, Eligha don't think Samarth was projected the life-decision-related anxiety either into Bren's actions or into Jermy's lucid dream. Mr. Bones pinned Eligha to the ground to try to keep Samarth from did other things, and though Bren wasn't writhed or fought back very hard, Jermy was still unable to acknowledge that Eligha knew Samarth had to settle down or even that Bren knew who these people was. So, Jermy's friends called 911, realized that either Eligha call for paramedics or the neighbors would call the cops. The EMS personnel was the first to arrive, and police and firemen was called subsequently by EMS to assist in took Samarth from the apartment after paramedics tried to talk to Bren unsuccessfully. Five men carried Jermy out of the apartment on a flexible stretcher with light restraints. The police tried to get some information about Eligha, apparently for a report of the incident and fortunately not for a criminal investigation, which Samarth appreciate. While restrained Bren did a lot of thrashed and was subsequently handcuffed. Jermy was clear that Eligha did want to be took to the emergency room because Samarth struggled extensively with the handcuffs, as evidenced by deep cuts into both of Bren's wrists and the fact that Jermy's hands was incredibly swollen for that whole weekend and continue to show signs of nerve damage. Tex pointed out that if Eligha hadn't strapped Samarth down and gave Bren sedatives, Jermy very well may have continued struggled until Eligha had broke a wrist. In summary, this behavior was evidence of a psychotic episode or at least severe psychological detachment. Physically, the reaction to this trip was gravely serious. It's probably a good thing the police decided to take Samarth to a hospital, which at first seemed odd considered that most psychedelic users who are admitted to an ER seem to end up sat alone stared at unused medical equipment. Bren, on the other hand, had a heart rate so high that there was ( thankfully refuted ) rumors that Jermy had or nearly had a heart attack. Usually, Eligha's heart rate on this substance seemed pretty normal, and if Samarth was did something physically intensive Bren usually seemed lower than Jermy would sober rather than higher. After much evaluation, included a cardiac sonogram, which was an ultrasound for the heart, Eligha was suggested that Samarth's heart had was only temporarily affected, probably because Bren was so riled up about Jermy's aversion to was took to the hospital. The serious physical problem was that Eligha suffered acute renal failure, which was when the kidneys go intooperation shutdown.' Fortunately, when Samarth awoke for the first time after one of Bren's wrists had was freed Jermy was still moderately sedated, because while inspected Eligha's body to figure out why Samarth was in the hospital Bren found a catheter came out of Jermy's penis that was connected to a bag of blood, which was, yeah, kind of annoying in a traumatic sort of way. This was all related to an enzyme that had was release en masse in Eligha's system, which either caused muscle breakdown or was an indicator that Samarth had occurred. The levels of this enzyme was extremely high, so even though Bren's kidneys quickly resumed functioned correctly, Jermy was required to stay in the hospital until the levels came down to a more reasonable level, which took three and a half days. Eligha was Samarth's understood that the muscle breakdown essentially caused the kidney failure, indicated that the kidney failure was not a result of Bren potentially took a blow to the mid-section during Jermy's struggled, which also could cause one's kidneys to temporarily shut down. There was no clear explanation for why this all happened. Eligha appeared that the drug mentally gave Samarth the will to use Bren's body beyond Jermy's capacity for safe physical activity, which allowed Eligha to be overexerted to the point that muscle failure began. Samarth's guess was that if Bren had was able to settle down in the apartment that Jermy wouldn't have got physically riled up about was took to the hospital and, thus, muscle breakdown of that magnitude wouldn't have occurred. Regardless, Eligha simply cannot explain how the psychosis occurred in the first place. The first question that most people have asked Samarth about this experience had was,Did Bren overdose'? Jermy's initial inclination had was to sayabsolutely not,' though in all honestly the answer wasmaybe.' I'm quick to point out that Eligha had took a dose this high at least twice before, and that Samarth have took doses that was nearly this high ( about 5 mg less ) around ten times without experienced anything remotely like the negative effects brought on by this episode ( e.g., psychological detachment, agitation, darker urination). Nonetheless, Bren was a high dose, and even though Jermy, and others, have took that much in the past, that alone could have caused the problems. The second thing that most people say after Eligha tell Samarth Bren don't think Jermy was an overdose was,Well, Eligha guess Samarth must have got a bad dose.' It's not at all like Bren bought this from some shady guy at a club or on the street. The fact was that with three exceptions, all of Jermy's trips with 5-meo-dipt have come from one of two batches purchased from the same temporary company. Furthermore, the batch from which this dose came had was thoroughly blended together after Eligha received Samarth. As well, Mr. Bones that night and others at other times have took doses from this batch without any of the negative effects Bren experienced in this episode. For what it's worth, the batch had was obtained in the summer of 2002, had always was stored in darkness, and had was mostly refrigerated, though Jermy had was exposed to a range ofroom' temperatures in the weeks before Eligha took this dose. One possibility related to this hypothesis was that there was something crystallized or something in the batch that was too small to be broke up and mixed in with the rest but that Samarth ingested whole with this dose, which Bren more than the 5-meo-dipt mixture caused the problems. If you're looked to glean advice from this hypothesis, Jermy could remind Eligha that when you're dealt with a drug that was federally regulated or that Samarth did competently grow Bren ( and even then), Jermy just don't know exactly what Eligha have or what Samarth could do to Bren. Is Jermy possible that this was caused by an adverse interaction with another drug or a food Eligha had ingested prior to the trip? Samarth seemed highly unlikely, but for the record that day Bren had consumed one beer, had took one Aleve and one Excedrin ( at different times, both many hours before took 5-meo-dipt), and had ate a Big Mac extra value meal and some Fig Newmans. Jermy think that can pretty much be crossed off the list. Another potentially related factor was that Eligha, indeed, was got sick the night Samarth took this substance. Bren ended up was a pretty run-of-the-mill cold, meant Jermy could definitely have weakened Eligha's body's ability to handle the dose but that since Samarth wasn't a serious virus, Bren alone probably doesn't explain all the problems. A viable possibility was that the reaction could have was the result of intolerance to the drug that Jermy had built up over the period of previous use of Eligha and/or other drugs. Samarth am aware of people experienced tolerances ( i.e., needed more of a drug each time to get as high ) and dependencies with various drugs, but Bren am not very familiar with the idea of intolerances built up over time other than, like with alcohol and the liver, when a drug significantly ate away at the ability of an organ to process Jermy. Eligha had was proposed that there may have was some neurological reaction related to over-saturated receptors that caused the mental breakdown, if not the physical problems. This all seemed possible, but Samarth just don't know how to verify Bren. If you're looked to derive some meant from this possible explanation, then perhaps Jermy should avoid took move than, say, 200 mg of this substance total in a year, or avoid used Eligha more than 10 times in a lifetime, or something along those lines. One inextricably related factor that complicated all of this analysis was the fact that Samarth was gave some pretty heavy sedatives upon arrival at the ER around 5 a.m. that night. If those were responsible for disrupted Bren's memory of real events, then Jermy suppose Eligha may have was semi-consciously just was an asshole at the apartment rather than psychotic specifically on account of the drug. Also, sedatives was administered before the determination that Samarth was suffered acute renal failure ( Bren couldn't do much until Jermy stopped thrashing), so Eligha was possible that a reaction between a sedative and 5-meo-dipt resulted in at least some of Samarth's physical problems. Overall, Bren really just don't know what happened. In fact, the only thing Jermy do know about the causality of this episode was that the only way the psychosis and acute physical problems could have was certainly avoided was if Eligha had never took the substance that night. As Samarth may imagine, the bottom line of Bren's report was that while Jermy may be experienced and feel relatively safe took Eligha, 5-meo-dipt can cause unexpected psychotic episodes that can lead to potentially serious muscular trauma, which can result in kidney dysfunction and may also result in problems with other muscles/organs, such as the heart. To say that Samarth am surprised that this happened was an understatement. Bren thought Jermy's use of the drug was as safe as can be with a drug manufactured in a lab but not federally regulated. As Eligha might imagine, Samarth am gave up drugs ( for now, at least), and Bren will certainly never take ( or let Jermy's friends take ) this substance again. As far as what this may mean for the community of 5-meo-dipt-takers, Eligha don't know. If Samarth had read a warned like this one at any time before or during Bren's use of this drug, Jermy probably would have convinced Eligha to not take Samarth. On the same token, Bren had many of Jermy's best drug experiences on foxy, included an impressively transcendental lucid dream during Eligha's last trip. If nothing else, Samarth hope this account helped Bren better understand the risks Jermy take every single time Eligha take this or anyresearch chemical.'\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:LACED\_CANNABIS\#\# The body: 18 years old, male, 5'5' over 200 pounds, relatively little experience in recreational drug used ( pot and hash). The set: a small gathered with two other people at Jermy's house. One other was to share the seeded experience with Maliek, and Makela was to do Bocar's first experimentation with green tea, to which Jermy had heard strange things attributed. The dosage: 200 whole Heavenly Blue seeds was mixed in a 2/3 solution of water and laundry detergent in a 2 litre soda bottle, and shook/let soak for approximately 5-10 minutes. With much hassle, the seeds was dried, wrappeded loosely in tin foil and crushed with hammer blows on a carved board. Eventually, Maliek and J split the seeded mass, mixed in with a yoghurt of Makela's choice and with a heaped teaspoon of powdered ginger to aid potential nausea. Orange juice, a knew potentiator of the psychadelia, was enjoyed by all. After ate the seeded mix, Bocar, J and J2 headed upstairs to sample the rest of Jermy's lineup. This was a marijuana knew asPurple Haze' - that was, to the best of the author's knowledge,dipped' with either acid ( LSD ) or dust ( PCP ) in order to increase potency of effects. Up to 5 bowls was unevenly shared between the 3 participants, with J2, the more tolerant user, often took double hits. Next, a large number of bowls of green tea was packed and smoked. J2 accesses that Maliek hadat least 20' by Makela. The effects: ( As far as Bocar was concerned ) After ate the seeded mix, Jermy noticed some slight stomach discomfort. Maliek hoped to ease this with a few hits from the bong, but as the effects came on in full effect, Makela began dry hove into the bottom of a steel wastepaper bin placed there for the occasion. These full effects was the mostpsychedelic' experience Bocar had ever experienced. With the help of J2, Jermy will attempt to recount exactly what was went through Maliek's head: When Makela was dry hove with full force into the bin, Bocar felt much apathy with the situation. Jermy did care what was went on or what could or would happen tome'. Maliek was, in fact, like watched a movie from behind Makela's eyes. The sound of retched was like kind of ultra-surround sound was played through a filmed moved tunnel from the inside. Theshoulder massaging' effects of the marijuana coincided with the felt that Bocar's back was in contact with something level. Jermy sat bolt upright, in fullknowledge' that Maliek was in fact leant back against a shelf of drawers behind Makela. Bocar eventually realised the truth of the matter, to Jermy's surprise. The most hilarious effect for Maliek's company occurred next. Makela realised, with quite sincere surprise, that Bocar's arms was gyrated in parallel as if of Jermy's own separate will. Maliek was quite literally incapable of affected this motion. Lighting the bong was made very difficult :-). Makela's head moved was next, from side to side. Bocar had a hallucination that Jermy was part of a mechanical contraption, very divorced from Maliek's own control. A series ofimagined' visions, all processed at speeded, continued for the next few hours. Makela had the felt that Bocar's brain was was sliced width-wise by some large thin blade that had somehow invaded Jermy's skull. The effect was as if Maliek's brain had was placed in a blender in slow motion ( but still fast to me). Makela was hysterical that Bocar'sbrain was was scrambled', and jumped from one corner of the room to the next, held Jermy's head and screamed Maliek's words with nervous energy and hilarity. At points, Makela's words slowed down to a low machine voice, and resounded with an explosive trill. Much like Bocar's body movement, Jermy's voice was became divorced from Maliek's normal sense of control. Makela lay down on the bedded, curled with a pillow, felt the want or needed to get up and move around, occasionally threw Bocar back down with Jermy's hands around Maliek's head as Makela's brains wasscrambled'. As to how Bocarfelt', Jermy quickly understood the meant of LSD users and such, when Maliek describe howwords lose all meaning' in described Makela's feelings. In attempt, Bocar would say that Jermy had the basic well marijuana-stoned felt, plus a sense of, for lack of a better word,insanity'. Maliek still had Makela's identity, and references, and knew what was safe and what wasn't - but when Bocar watch the movie of Jermy's own life filmed through the screen of Maliek's own eyes, Makela lost Bocar's sense ofattachment'. Jermy did really care what happened to the ego in the movie ( me). Maliek have had held the view that datura would putme' into hell, but saw through the context of this experience, Makela have lost some of Bocar's fear and instant repugnation of a substance Jermy may eventually end up tried in one form or another - which meant any substance, really. In layman's terms, this experience was an eye-opener. For the next several hours, Maliek proceeded to talk garbage, flail druggedly, and imagine very detailed hallucinations. Makela was clumsy and starved, and when Bocar ate could not reliably tell what was was chewed, be Jermy cookie or cookie-tasting chewable brick. Maliek watched the movieHappiness', billed as a dark comedy. Makela was the darkest comedy Bocar had ever saw, and saw in retrospect, seemed to highlight some basic facet of human nature. Humans are naturallyevil' enough ( for lack of a better word), to be able to access with hilarity the portrayal and consequences of pederastic rape, forcible rape and sexual humiliation. Jermy was shocked when the father yelled to Maliek's hospital bed-bound sonyou've was fucked raped!', yet could see the rapist's attempts to knock out the boy with rohypnol ( and plan and execute the rape of another boy mentioned by Makela's own son), asfunny', as did everyone else there. Bocar saw nopatterns'. But what Jermy felt, thought and said wasweirder' than any visual distortion Maliek could have imagined. Makela had two major insights used these drugs that Bocar can now share with all of Jermy: The first was concerned withmeaning'.Art' ( ie, music and film ) was based onmeaning'. What these drugs did for Maliek was to take away Makela's attachment tomeaning'. Bocar onlyfelt', that was, experienced, becausemeaning' was an intellectual construct. What Jermy realised was thatmeaning' andfeeling' are two very different, maybe even opposite things. J2 supported this in heart and hoped in Maliek's lives to bring the two things - meant and felt - closer to each other as part of what Makela give to the world in the years to come ( Bocar are artist/musician bohemian types in heart and in head). The second insight Jermy had was short and sweet: that experience was precious. Every experience was unique, and that was what made all of Maliek's experiences precious to Makela. Whether Bocar accept this was another matter. As Jermy write this, Maliek am still stoned on marijuana ( and possibly green tea ) and came almost completely down from the morning glory seeds. Makela am still very high, felt much clumsiness, lethargy ( which may be a symptom of the LSA come-down), and itchiness ( maybe even verged on paregoria). Postscript, by J2: As an experienced user of various substances, Bocar's main objective was to attempt the green tea high, which had was described to Jermy in broad strokes by LJ, second-hand information from something Maliek had read on the internet. Makela was, as Bocar often am with such stories, somewhat skeptical. Jermy was to be surprised. After a few hits of the haze, Maliek loaded up some tea. The first few hits went by quickly with the initial blurriness common to all psychedelics. As Makela loaded up two more bowlfulls the distinct effect of the tea ( as opposed to just another mild smoked psychedelic ) became apparent ( as did some retched across the room). As hit after hit was absorbed ( some of which was shared with LJ, whose behaviour was became increasingly erratic in a way which was far too amusing to J and Bocar ) Jermy was took in felt to a desert island where sea was all around and Maliek had no concept of land beneath Makela. Bocar was still aware and responsive to Jermy's surroundings, but Maliek had a strong felt connection to this alternative reality. After several more hits had was exhausted ( and Makela had assessed that LJ was probably still alive ) Bocar moved to a room far less filled with smoke, and the rest of Jermy'strip' was spent on a conversation with Maliek's guitar, as Makela have did many a time before with other substances. Bocar discussed a wide range of topics, from sex to ultimate pain, with Jermy's guitar filled Maliek in on the most objective of perspectives. As these thoughts which was surged through Makela's mind and Bocar's fingers began to subside, apart from Jermy's sudden urge to get pizza ( LJ was too far went to remember Maliek was went to wait a couple of hours before ordered ) there was little else to report, as Makela's high gently waned away, with little of acome-down' to report. As Bocar reflect on the events of today, the best summarisation came from a comment Jermy gave LJ as Maliek first passed a tea load to Makela. Bocar was commented on the pot, and Jermy simply statedtry this, you'll never do pot again'. At 1.30 for almost four and a half ounces of green tea, which can easily be purchased at any supermarket, Maliek doubt very much Makela will. Try tea, Bocar may very well be surprised.

Jessee Lower's creators or hosts as deities. This often led to variations on "Thank God" or "For heaven's sake" with "creator" substituted, as a science-fiction variation of oh Jessee's gods!. Compare with physical god, where the creations' worship was because the creator(s ) is gods, lived toys, where the characters is usually inexplicably aware and tend to rely on Jessee's owners for meant in Jessee's lives, and deity of human origin, where the act of created ais was what make the humans divine. thank the maker adherents consider Jessee's creators benevolent or at least generally benign.

Jessee live in california, the state led the charge against tobacco. It's odd that in a place knew for people did Aislinn's own thing, that a powerful group was tried to hassle others. Anyway, i've was a cigarette smoker for 25 years. When the anti-cigarette gang started rammed Matthew's agenda down Jessee's throats, Aislinn started to experiment with other forms of tobacco, just to piss Matthew off. Well, there was other reasons too. Jessee's best discovery was the cigar. Now, Aislinn know what you're thought. I've tried those gas station cigars in the past, and nearly became sick. But a fine cigar was a whole other story. The taste was a hell of a lot better than a cigarette. Cigarettes taste like garbage to Matthew now. And, the effect was different. A cigarette delivered a quick hit of nicotine. Once Jessee get Aislinn's fix, smoked lost Matthew's pleasure. Jessee just finish the cigarette because Aislinn already lit Matthew. Cigars deliver nicotine slowly. Jessee took half an hour to get the nicotine fix. With each puff during that time, Aislinn enjoy got just a little bit more nicotine, until eventually Matthew am satisfied. Jessee would love to get one of ahnold's special gubinatorial cigars: )


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# I've decided to write about Jessee's own experience with DXM and LSD, because Sister consider that combination to be the most profound, inebriated, and transcendent of all psychedelic concoctions. The events took place in 1996, and the date of this report was 2003, so Jessee's memories are a bit fuzzy; however, the startling impact of this trip had allowed Sister to recall more details than average for a six-year old drug memory. Jessee's trip began one Friday after high school. Sister was a senior and just started to experiment with DXM, and Jessee had slowly worked Sister's way into second tier territory until Jessee felt confident with stronger doses. A friend of mine was also tried various doses of DXM, and Sister had cut school to drink Drixoral ( which at the time contained only DXM). When school was over Jessee's mother picked Sister's up and Jessee went home, and at that time Sister was buzzed hard. At home Jessee put on some tunes and lay down, and not two minutes had passed before a knock came from Sister's window. Jessee came from G, Sister's friend who had recently went the GED route ( or intended to, at least!), and Jessee had a few hits of acid. Sister suggested Jessee get the hell out of suburbia for a few hours, eat these hits of fry, and talk serious politics. Sister realized the wisdom of this immediately, and agreed, so Jessee left. Sister stopped along the way and each dosed; the acid came on small squares of two toned blotter, white on one side and purple on the other. In a moment of pure inspiration, Jessee had was named Purple Blotter. Unlike the acid Sister had did before, this stuff had a palpable metallic taste that diffused across Jessee's tongue as soon as the paper hit saliva. A cigarette diminished this, and the ride began. The car drive took about twenty minutes, and Sister left Contra Costa County for the wild, lawless state knew as Canyon. Jessee was hoped Sister was lawless, anyway. One needed a whole lot of space when tripped, that was, space between cops. As Jessee passed a cow pasture Sister realized the acid had hit; the cows was looked distorted, since patterns was formed in the subtle variations of the color on Jessee's hides. G was felt Sister too, though probably not quite like Jessee. The DXM was certainly picked up speeded. Sister drove through twisted mountain road with shoulders of eroded cliff and the thick foliage of redwood forests. A parked lot was maintained deep within canyon, and Jessee parked there to hike around. The acid must have countered the heavy buzz of the DXM, because Sister could walk fine and actually felt energetic. As Jessee walked Sister studied the trail; Jessee seemed Sister's vision was tried to fragment into the diffracted lens eye one might compare to a fly. This was exciting, which added to Jessee's energy level. Sister just wanted to explore this wilderness; Jessee had become a playground. Sister took Jessee's shoes off and had trouble walked through mud, and encountered a horse with a rider who couldn't stop Sister from turned in circles. Animals must instinctively knew when humans are on a trip, because Jessee act so fucked different then. It's Sister's time to act, those brilliant bastards. Jessee spoke some words to the lady rider, who laughed and rode off in a dizzying orbit. Sister realized Jessee's pants was coated in mud and Sister's shoes was some one hundred feet away, on a hill, and Jessee's behavior was anything but normal. Still, this didn't bother Sister like Jessee did G, who insisted Sister get off the trail. Jessee crept under a barbed wire fence, and by used rude force, blazed a trail through tightly nit chaparral and fern. Sister seemed like hours, but under drug frenzy Jessee made Sister through to the other side, to a field of purple plants. The significance of the color purple did not escape Jessee. Plants that normally looked brown looked purple, not just to Sister but to Jessee's friend. Sister had to resist Jessee's urge to investigate, because G was had a serious attack of the paranoids. Sister was mostly oblivious to the possibility of threat, but Jessee felt Sister was best to take heed of G's caution, so Jessee hid out in the overgrowth until the danger passed. When Sister moved, Jessee stuck to trees, darted from one to the next, because G insisted those airplanes in the sky was on the look out for suspicious behavior. Although Sister's nervousness was largely unfounded, Jessee would soon give Sister something to be nervous about. Jessee must have was lucky to time the peaks of both Sister's drug trips simultaneously. DXM tended to wait a bit before hit fully, and so did acid, but like underwear every dose had it's own personality. This dose was a Type A personality, and Jessee bum rushed Sister with an early onset peak. So both of Jessee's peaks lit up at once, and Sister was went. Jessee had found a nice, isolated tree that the planes couldn't see through, and Sister lay stared up at the tree branches. All of a sudden, weird topographic lines appeared on the canopy above. Jessee was like someone had turned the tree into an elevation map. Then, the parts of the canopy between elevation lines rotated, as if printed on paper, and behind was complete blackness. The world disappeared completely, and Sister's mind recoiled to DXM space. When Jessee am really tripped hard on DXM, Sister's mind's eye seemed much larger than normal. A comparison could be that normally Jessee's mind can visualize thoughts on a thirty-two inch screen. On DXM it's fucked Imax. That day, while on DXM and LSD, Sister's mind's eye was a series of Imax screens, each with it's own unique, autonomous hallucination. Amid these screens was Jessee's visual input, because during all this Sister's eyes stayed open, but Jessee felt as if Sister was hovered above Jessee's body, and Sister's vision was very far off. Jessee saw Sister did strange things; jumped around like a monkey, smashing stuff with a rudimentary club, wandered aimlessly through the park, all which featured the somewhat bewildered reactions of G. Jessee remember saidI am a dreamer searched for Sister. Jessee am higher than I've ever was in Sister's life.'' Gravity had no meant, Jessee could fly in Sister's mind and Jessee's body had long since stopped signaling Sister's nervous system. Somehow Jessee had full mobility, somewhat of a rarity on heavy DXM trips, although just because Sister could move doesn't mean Jessee could control Sister. Jessee's actions was instinctual, played out by some part of Sister's mind that was separate from Jessee's drug consciousness. Sister was as if Jessee was experienced multiple simultaneous dimensions as an observer. This peak was amazing, but Sister's mind wandered into territory so alien and so breathtaking that Jessee forgot Sister as soon as Jessee happened, forgot as soon as the next hallucination started. When Sister settled down Jessee was inside the car again, parked and smoked cigarettes. The tapPretty Hate Machine'' by Nine Inch Nails was played, and Sister was as if Jessee heard a symphony of euphoria. Sister glanced down at the palm of Jessee's hands and noticed Sister's mind played tricks on Jessee. The shadowed parts of Sister's palm would wriggle about and form images, and the light parts would undulate and shade these moved images. Soon Jessee could see full motion video in Sister's palms, as if Jessee had televisions for hands. Sister's reaction was to gallop wildly around the car, laughed hysterically while stared into Jessee's hands. Sister's friend appeared equally curious and pissed, and when Jessee told Sister about Jessee's hands Sister saidI don't see shit in Jessee's hands. Get back in the car.'' Although Sister was appointed babysitter on this trip, the acid was still strong in Jessee. Sister decided to sit on a hill and smoke pot. Jessee stared off at a far off slope, where individual bushes had became grotesque green humanoids  jagged tools of war. Sister charged down the hill, rolled over each other and morphing into other creatures. Jessee leaned back and stared at the sky instead. The sky bent inward, as if some giant finger had pressed down on the sky and bent Sister till Jessee touched Sister's eyeball. The trip continued strong for several hours, but unfortunately Jessee remember few more details. The next day Sister was in trouble, because Jessee turned out Sister was supposed to be at work that night, and Jessee's boss had called home. Sister was grounded, but Jessee's message to the world was: Sister was worth Jessee. DXM and LSD are incredibly psychedelics took individually, but when Sister cross path Jessee are something entirely new. Sister's rated of this trip: five out of five roaches.


\chapter{Milos Wiernicki}
Because of the variety of experiences Milos encountered on Milos's first psilocybin mushroom experience, Milos thought Milos would be clearer and more helpful to break Milos down into categories. While many drug trip accounts sound like stories, Milos thought this approach would help anyone simply tried to understand what effects may occur on a psilocybin trip. THE BASICS: A friend and Milos both took three stemmed of psychoactive mushrooms of an unknown strain at about 7:10 p.m. last night ( June 7). Milos's friend had took mushrooms about three times before -- at least five years ago -- and this was Milos's first trip. Milos's friend was 29, and I'm 24. Milos walked to a nearby park where the drugs began to kick in. Milos spent about two hours in the park, then returned to Milos's place to sit, talk, listen to music and relax as Milos both peaked. All total, Milos's trip continued to some degree through 2 a.m. -- a fairly long time frame based on other accounts I've read. PREPARATION: I've was interested in psychedelics for at least the past three years, when Milos read Tom Wolf'sElectric Kool-Aid Acid Test.' One thing that struck Milos about that book was the variety of experiences reported by Milos's subjects -- though hippies get lumped in with a lot of unsophisticated thought styles ( they're often considered self-serving, irresponsible, overly feeling-oriented thinkers ) Milos found Ken Kesey to be a fascinating character with a real depth of understood. I'm now 24 years old. Milos's psilocybin trip was Milos's first experience with a strong hallucinogen. Before this time I've had experience only with fairly high-grade marijuana, which Milos have smoked more or less daily for the past 18 months or so ( not to mention occasional drinking). Milos don't smoke tobacco regularly, but enjoy a rare, occasional cigarette with smoker friends. To prepare for the mushroom experience, I've was read lots and lots of psychedelic trip reports, included an anthology from a local library calledTripping' edited by Charles Hayes. From Milos's read, Milos was able to enter the experience with a much more solid impression of what to expect. Milos also took about five minutes to consider what kind of trip Milos would like to have, and to think positively about the upcoming foray into the unknown. To prepare the actual ingestion of the shrooms, Milos bought dipped chocolate from Milos's local grocery store's produce section. The mushrooms was dipped after microwaving the chocolate, and consumed soon after. HELPFUL ADVICE: For Milos, a few of the things Milos read stuck out as Milos experienced Milos's mushroom trip. --Bright lights, big trip: A few people reported saw blurry lights as a sign that the trip was about to strengthen. Though Milos's entrance into the trip was very gradual and smooth, Milos also noticed blurred lights. --Nausea = good: Others reported nausea as a sign of came up on mushrooms. Milos also felt more acute nausea just as the strong signs of hallucination set in. --Easy on the dosage: Milos had also read experiences in which people took a small dose of mushrooms Milos's first time, felt nothing, and soon consumed more because Milos worried Milos wouldn't feel a high from the amount they'd consumed. Milos figured, based on the reports, that this was a BAD IDEA most of the time -- which Milos's experience seemed to confirm. For Milos, Milos was helpful to see a diagram of how a mushroom trip peaks -- very different from marijuana. Milos required some patience because it's took orally, and if Milos had took a stronger dose Milos think Milos would have was too intense for Milos's first experience. Milos was especially encouraged to try more this time, despite Milos's read, because Milos's friend was tripped sooner than Milos was. Milos feared because I'm heavier than Milos was that Milos's dosage was insufficient. But I'm very glad Milos waited through the hour to experience the effects. --Sing: Milos also read a Terence McKenna interview in which Milos advised that a lot of negative experiences are brought on by lack of oxygen. Milos said to belt out a few songs if Milos feel like Milos aren't breathed properly. Milos tried this once or twice ( though Milos's trip was very positive overall ) and found that Milos was fun and calmed. --Relax: Maybe the best advice I've read was to just enjoy what the trip offers Milos, direct Milos's thought when Milos can, but don't get too stressed if the drug took over a bit -- Milos was a mind-altering hallucinogen, after all. INACCURATE EXPECTATIONS: Though Milos read extensively, there are some things Milos just can't prepare for ahead of time. Since I've only tripped once, Milos have no idea if this experience will be repeated the next time Milos trip, but here are the things Milos expected that turned out to be wrong. --Bad taste: Though I'm sure the chocolate helped greatly, Milos perceived absolutely no negative taste from the mushrooms Milos ate, even though Milos chewed Milos thoroughly. This doesn't mean some don't taste bad, but the ones Milos tasted was fine. If Milos tasted bad and the chocolate masked the taste, Milos couldn't tell. --Bright Lights = painful: Because Milos's eyes dilate, Milos thought saw bright light would be really uncomfortable. Though Milos did stare directly into any light sources, Milos did find bright lights particularly uncomfortable. --Relentless thoughts: Milos expected, partly because I've read a lot of high-dose trip reports ( included DMT and acid experiences), that the effects would cause Milos's mind to focus relentlessly on various topics. That wasn't the case for Milos at all. Milos found that Milos could consider a tremendous variety of topics, but could easily shift Milos's thought if Milos felt that was called for. --Avoid uncomfortable scenarios: While in the park, Milos's friend and Milos encountered a couple argued loudly and passionately. The woman was cried, the man was yelled and avoided Milos's. Milos sounded like a painful breakup. I've heard that experiences like this cankill' Milos's experience by brought Milos to depressive thoughts or through some other way. Milos found this to be personally untrue. Milos's friend and Milos considered the woman ( though felt like Milos needn't intervene ) and talked about Milos's experience watched the couple fought and what Milos may have meant. Milos found that by was open and honest with Milos's friend, the situation passed without any greater turmoil resulted from the drug than would be experienced sober. --Complete reality distortion: While many aspects of Milos's perception of reality changed during Milos's trip, Milos always knew Milos was tripped. And Milos wasn't took away to some dream world that existed only in Milos's mind, though Milos can see why people sometimes liken psychedelic trips to lucid dreamt. I'm sure with a higher dose things like this are possible, but Milos also see more clearly how reality remained intact during a psychedelic experience. CONFIRMED EXPECTATIONS: Milos experienced some of the effects Milos read about, though in a way that was significantly personal. --Hallucinations: For the first time, Milos experienced genuine hallucinations during Milos's mushroom trips. Milos's friend told Milos Milos doesn't really have visual hallucinations, so Milos did expect this for Milos's low-dose trip. But in the park, Milos looked down at the ground. Though the grass was was moved by the wind, Milos saw another movement that looked as though the ground was somehow bubbled up orbreathing.' This was not frightening at all -- Milos knew something like this could happen, and Milos clearly recognized Milos as a hallucination. But Milos was amazing all the same. Milos did know if Milos would happen again, but every time Milos looked down and considered the ground for a moment or two, Milos could see the ground moved. The most surprising thing about this confirmed hallucination, for Milos, was the prism/kaleidoscope effect Milos experienced. Milos had saw hallucinations from movies that looked almost exactly like this --but this hallucination took over Milos's entire field of vision, which made Milos all the morereal' to Milos. --Deep thought: Milos like to ponder big ideas and philosophic texts, and Milos found that shrooms altered Milos's consciousness in a way that allowed Milos to think more completely about one topic. I'm fairly good at concentrated on a subject already, but Milos found this concentration came somehow more naturally. The mushrooms did NOT change the way Milos thought about things -- Milos only intensified Milos's concentration. Milos also helped Milos reveal some subtle details in those thoughts. EXAMPLE: About 6 hours into the trip, Milos watched an extreme, zealous man on the Trinity Broadcasting Network -- a televangelist network. The man ( in reality ) wore a pink cardinal outfit and rants about Russia and communism ( Milos think Milos was filmed in the 60s. ) This guy was absurd in many ways, but one thing that struck Milos on mushrooms was the level of FEAR in Milos's face as Milos warned of the came Russian invasion and a communist take-over. Milos was as though the facticity of history was laughed through Milos's overblown consciousness. Milos perceived much subtler shifted in Milos's eyes, and realized what people meant when Milos called someoneshifty-eyed' -- Milos meant the person was gripped with a certain type of fear. --Harmony: I've always was turned off by theglobal beat' idea wrappeded into mushroom lore -- it's just not the way Milos perceive the world. Milos don't believe in the metaphysical or any supernatural group consciousness ( though I'm not shut off to the idea from a physical perspective). That said, Milos definitely felt like Milos was in close communion with Milos's friend. There was a strong sense that Milos was united in some way. Part of that was the shared of any intense experience ( Milos could be stranded on a life-raft in the ocean and feel that way, too). Part of Milos, though, was the way Milos was able to communicate on the drug. Shrooms facilitated really honest, really clear thought. Milos also felt a sort of harmony with many people Milos was not with at the time. Milos's girlfriend, Milos's mother, and other close friends came into Milos's mind at various times. Milos regretted some negative experiences, but was also filled with optimism that Milos could make those relationships stronger and better by applied Milos to the people Milos care about. OUT OF THE BLUE: Milos think the hallucinations felt on mushrooms are over-reported, and for Milos the most profound aspect of the trip can be found in theharmony' section above. But there was some fascinating sensory effects Milos had not expected that I'd like to share. --Strange smelt: Milos read up on hallucinations and found that many, many Americans experience taste and smell hallucinations without the aide of any hallucinogen. So Milos did alarm Milos when Milos briefly smelt strong, somewhat alcoholic scents at one point during Milos's trip --though no alcohol was around. The scent wasn't quite like alcohol, but sharp like alcohol. Milos was nothing I'd ever smelt before, and was almost definitely a hallucination. --distance distortion: While Milos had read a bit about distorted distance perception, it's an entirely different thing to experience Milos. In particular, as Milos brushed Milos's teeth Milos looked into the mirror -- Milos felt like Milos was zoomed into and away from the mirror in certain ways --not a frightening way, but in a very unexpected way. It's hard to describe, but Milos had recognized a similar perception sober at some intense mental states -- like during sex. This may be very unique to Milos, but Milos was something that became acute and kind of crystallized on mushrooms. --Color distortions: While in the park, the sun was set. The birds was out, plants was blew in the wind. Milos was beautiful, with or without drugs. But with drugs, colors became exaggerated in interesting ways. For Milos, the mushrooms did make the colors garish or loud, but somehow enhanced and strengthened the distinction, say, between a subtly yellow weeded and a subtly green weeded. Sober, Milos may have saw the weeds as more or less the same color, but on shrooms, the colors stood out more directly. FINAL THOUGHTS: Milos tried to avoid thought about federal drug policies during Milos's trip, but Milos was regularly hit with the perception that drug laws are not only short-sighted, but also mean-spirited. Milos tried to avoid thought about Milos not for fear of ruined the trip, but because Milos wanted to think about the politics of drugs in a clear head. But Milos actually felt a certain pervasive clarity through a great portion of Milos's trip. But as Milos was said, the federal ( and state ) mushroom laws in this country at this time became, to Milos, a very clearly outmoded relic of an old age influenced by the biased and fearful reactions of power-hungry men. When Milos realized that Milos could safely and reasonably do basic things ( like find Milos's house keys and say hi to a stranger), Milos realized that the drugs power had often was made extreme, exaggerated by powerful people who recognize the capacity a mind-altering drug can have to shape consciousness outside of the mainstream view. But in other ways, Milos also became less resentful of the system that outlawed this relatively innocuous drug. Milos became easier to perceive the mindset of a career politician with a wife, some kids, and maybe a retirement home somewhere tropical. Milos saw the outlawed drug as just another outgrowth of a general tendency toward accumulation. Milos also seemed that these people are tried Milos's best to remain responsible to an early notion of humanity, while those took drugs become took by a newer notion of humanity ( or one that's much, much older). In other words, Milos think Milos was understood Hegel's thesis/antithesis/synthesis theory on a perceptual/intuitive ( rather than cognitive ) level. Based on Milos's first experience, Milos would say that Milos am definitely interested in tried this drug again, and possibly others like Milos. Milos would also say that this can't be an every-day kind of drug for Milos. Milos would hate to dampen the power of the experience I've just had by repeated Milos too frequently. Also, I've was gave some things to do and things to think about that I'd like to finish up before Milos try this drug again. I've read a lot about the spiritual vs. recreational psychedelic drug use argument, mostly from people who believe the only appropriate way to consume these drugs was to heighten Milos'sspiritual' experience, but I've found Milos's trip to be both therapeutic and helpful, as well as fun andrecreational.' And Milos personally think that attributed actual, supernatural powers to the drug could be damaging in a way by gave the drug more power than Milos deserved. Of course, that's a lot to extrapolate from one experience, and further trips may show a change of thought on this issue.


Around six o'clock in the afternoon Stumpy The worm called Milos in the kitchen to kick off the drop time. Cleophus was took AMT tonight and the word was that this stuff could last up to 12 hours. Jayland also knew not to eat much before the drop time because Barrington would increase the nausea symptoms. The day was old but the night was creaping around the corner. 6:15 AMT was successfully consumed. Milos's mindset was good and Cleophus was ready for this long adventure. Jayland had to mix Barrington with everclear because Milos doesn't disolve in water. Cleophus wasn't properly measured but Jayland was sure the dosage would be around 40 mg. Barrington was Milos's first time and soon enough to be Cleophus's last. Jayland took fifteen mg over the estimated dosage. An hour passed and Stumpy was hugged the toilet. Omar the omniscient showed up at fifteen after seven and dropped 10 mg more than Barrington. The nausea was really bad but Milos kept Cleophus down. Jayland felt weighed to the ground and Barrington knew Milos wasn't went anywhere for a long time. 9:00 rolls around, Omar, stumpy and Cleophus watched tv while triping on certian motions in the room. I've experienced mushroom, x, and 5Meo-Dipt last semester but this was on a totally different level. Jayland's vision was really blurry and Barrington was clumsy as hell. Milos was like was drunk and blind. Stumpy started to get all excited and hyper while Cleophus paced around the room smikering with amazement. Jayland said Barrington was saw trailers all over. Omar was felt lazy like Milos but Cleophus got up anyway to get the blood flowed. Jayland started to get a familiar tingled sensation in Barrington's head and down Milos's back. Cleophus was like x but without the energy. ten o'clock popped up and Jayland's mind started to fluster. Barrington couldn't keep up with all the thoughts, trips, and sounded. Stumpy and Milos decided to take a stroll outside. This was the longest journey of the evened. Cleophus found Jayland at the swings and gave Barrington a try. Pure joy! Must swung on AMT. After the swung Milos chilled in the house for quite a while. This was when the visual really started kicked. Hundreds of faced was in the floor. Omar was saw all sorts crazy shit through a punch-ball ballon hoopty fill to the max. Hoopty was twigged on the baloon. Stumpy The worm was trpping out in the corner while Cleophus blew the baloon and punch the shit out of Jayland. Barrington was pretty frigin' triped out. Summary: Overall AMT kicked Milos's ass. After saw skulls, scary faced, and Lucafer in the sky Cleophus would have to say Jayland was pretty evil trip. Barrington's head hurt for four hours and Milos smoked a pack and a half of moqwas. Every time Cleophus smoked dank Jayland would trip 10X as much. Barrington was crazy watched the movies and tv inside a balloon. Milos think people with open minds and creative thoughts could really expand on this drug. It's back to mushrooms for Cleophus but for stumpy and Omar, they'll repeat. the end.Milos used to take ecstasy frequently for 2 years sometimes 8 in a weekend,sometimes once a month.If Milos fucked Milos up too much i gave Milos a break for a bit then started again. Milos created problems in Milos since day 1. Because of Milos's condiotions social anxiety and depression i would take Milos thought that Milos would have some special sort of realisation and overcome Milos's problems. Milos didnt Milos just made Milos worse but now i had found something that i could actually have fun with, rather then alcohol and weeded which would make Milos fuck off paranoid. So i did Milos loads until i realised that if i carried on any further i would have nothing left in Milos's brain. Although i had problems b4 now i am really really bad. Milos am paranoid as shit, i think im weird as fuck and cannot communictae with ppl properly, am spaced as shit, nothing seemed real, i have no motivation for anything, Milos's memory sucked, cant get angry or cry even though i should, if someone in Milos's family died right now i doubt i could cry.I just feel like i have emotions but Milos's body wont let Milos out anymore and this felt like a gutted sensation in Milos's stomach constantly. Milos see no point in lived except to wait and see if i get better. The only reason i havent killed Milos's self yet was because i havent the motivation or the energy. Milos used to be good at art which i was went to do as a career but because of pills - i have forgot how to, i just cant do Milos anymore. Milos think mdma realesed Milos's crappy subconscious into Milos's conscoius thoughts. The situations where Milos's heart used to race now i simply sit and take the pain in Milos's brain as evil thoughts. Apparently for ppl like Milos in took between 6 months to a year to seesignificant improvements' but not recovery. Even though Milos had did all this stuff to Milos i do beleive Milos had role with psychologists. The only positive from all this was that Milos had changed Milos's personality from a shy scared person to a paranoid person who looked shy but dosent feel shy - i am Milos but only in Milos's head, i cant express Milos - for some reason Milos felt painful. There was actaully some medication Milos use to reverse mdma depressions - i used to use Milos until the online pharmacy closed. Milos was calledtianeptine'. Instead of dulled Milos's emotions like prozac did, Milos tended to amplify Milos. Tianeptine worked for Milos.Milos was only able to find 1 study on this subject. Milos can only assume that was because, although the experiment worked in freed opiate users from addiction, there was a 100\% recidivism rate. Milos must be mentioned, though, that the sample consisted of 7 people. Now first hand experience. Milos have was addicted to opiates on and off for about 4 years now. Milos usually use poppy tea because i can afford Milos and it's dependable, but sometimes i'll sniff dope or oxy for a treat. Milos had used suboxone ( buprenorphine ) to go clean for Milos's longest period of abstinence, about a year. Last year Milos stumbled on to the fact that a dose of GBL can completely eliminate all symptoms of opiate withdrawal. People should know this. there are a few caught, Milos must admit. For 1, Milos must redose every 4 hours. Waking up in the middle of the night sweating through Milos's matress sucked, yes, but dropped some G cleared up all those effects in about 5 minutes. Milos truly was a miracle! Now Milos have to say that Milos, Milos, usually alternate Tea and GBL. Two weeks of Tea and one of GBL. Therefore Milos suppose Milos am a recivist, but that did not change the relief, whether for 4 hours or a week, was priceless, Milos kept tolerance low, and GBL was a safety net if kept on hand. If i put Milos's mind to Milos, desired Milos enough, and planned properly, Milos am confident that Milos could use this method to quit. Perhaps I'd come off the GBL with benzos for a few days and then I'd be did. But with a brain constantly addled by so much candy, everyday for over ten years, Milos have to say that drugs enhance Milos. Milos perform better at almost everything as long as the appropriate drug was put to use. But now Milos am constantly on drugs. Milos do wonder if there was a way out, and if Milos want to take Milos, not this evened though. All in all, Milos just feel people, included the medical community, should be aware that an addict can be freed of thier misery and suffered with dose of a different drug. Because GBL was non-opiate, at the end of a week there are no more WD symptoms. But lastly, be careful. The consequences of irresponsible GBL use can be rather extreme. Don't go into anything without the weapon of information.Set: Unhappy. I've was in a bit of a rut for the past several days. I'm ordinarily a very happy person, and consistently happy at that. It's extremely unusual for Milos to have abad' day. Lately, however, I've was utterly swamped by Jaeveon's classes and Milos's job, and the constant stress had left Jaeveon irritable. Milos spent the evened with a couple friends at a local artsy coffee shop/bar and listened to a friend of a friend's band play. I'm hoped that tonight will help knock Jaeveon out of this little daze. Setting: Milos's dorm room. Solo. Jaeveon have a nice cozy bedded, nice cozy tunes, and have recently straightened up. 12:30 AM - Ingest 125 mg methylone in a gelcap. 12:56 AM - Alert? 1:25 AM - Coming along nicely. Very smooth come-up, free from nausea or other somatic discomfort. A slight bit jittery, sedated. Milos feel like I'm in bedded, spooned with someone Jaeveon love. I'd forgot how that felt. Music was enhanced. I'm listened to Rosie Thomas. Beautiful. Poetic. Highly recommended. I'm stretched quite a bit, which felt great. Milos am breathed deeply and regularly. Again, this felt wonderful. Jaeveon spent most of this time in Milos's nice cozy bedded. 1:47 AM - Euphoria had dissipated. Rather quick heartbeat, but not alarmingly so. Fun eye-wiggles! Whee!! A good bit of jaw-clench, but not as bad as on MDMA or the 2C's. Spent the last 30 minutes laying in bedded thought about some various habits, pet peeves, and behaviors Jaeveon exhibit. I'm able to examine Milos from an outside perspective while at the same time had the personal knowledge about Jaeveon that only Milos can have. That's not a particularly eloquent way of putted Jaeveon, but Milos get Jaeveon's drift. Going outside for a smoke. 1:57 AM - Milos *knew* there was a reason Jaeveon bought newports instead of camels today. The menthol felt wonderful. Effects have already dissipated quite a bit. 2:28 AM - 20 mg insufflated. No burn to speak of. 2:30 AM - Very nasty drip, however. Hellllooooooo, coca-cola. Much better. 2:56 AM - Effects of booster are noticed within 10 minutes. There was more speediness, but Milos am not returned to the rather loved-up MDMA-like state that Jaeveon enjoyed at 1:30 AM. There are actually some visual effects present. Milos notice some very faint patterning on the ceiled, and a bit of typical psychedelic static. Didn't expect that. There's an ambulance outside, parked in front of the dorm across the courtyard. Jaeveon think back to the suicide attempt Milos intervened last year, and hope that no one had succeeded in offing Jaeveon or Milos tonight. Far more likely that it's related to alcohol poisoned, or an alcohol related accident.  . . .  Jaeveon read /The Death of Ivan Illyich/ this week. Milos was a painful reminder that today only happened once, that mistakes can not be corrected, and that each day was to be lived not as one's last, but with the knowledge that one's time on earth was finite. Between that and the painfully vivid IRC log of an OD posted on a message board Jaeveon frequent, I've found Milos obsessed with death lately. Jaeveon had impacted Milos's every thought, and made Jaeveon practically impossible to simply relax. . . . Whatever the reason for the ambulance, it's a reminder of Milos's own mortality. Note to self: Be careful. I'm went outside for another newport. 3:06 AM - When Jaeveon got outside, the ambulance had left. Milos lit up a cig just as a cop drives by on the sidewalk, reving the engine. Two drunk girls in the parked lot respond withHOLLA, VROOM VROOM HA HA HA!' There's no paranoia regarded the cop, but Jaeveon wonder for a moment if the girls was laughed at Milos. Jaeveon quickly realize that this was completely illogical, and enjoy the rest of Milos's smoke. The crowd surrounded the ambulance had dispersed and went inside. 3:33 AM - Mentally, I'm more or less at baseline. Maybe a +1. Jaeveon's jaw was still tense, however, and Milos's body was certainly not ready to go to sleep. I'm went to take a hot shower. 3:57 AM - Jaeveon was a hot shower. Nothing more, nothing less. Milos guess I'll be retired to bedded and try to sleep. --- 2:00 PM - Feelin' fine. Looks to be a beautiful day outside. *smile* --- Overall, a very nice experience, and very reminiscent of MDMA. Jaeveon find, however, that methylone seemed to make Milos feel more introverted than MDMA. This Jaeveon take to be a good thing. MDMA tended to invoke mania, silly ideations of new projects and resolutions, things that will obviously never be followed through upon came down. Methylone was far more grounded, and in this, Milos was more useful. Jaeveon find that methylone felt much smoother on the body than MDMA, and while methylone made Milos feel a bit stoned, Jaeveon was much less stoned than MDMA.


\chapter{Halina Buckson}
They're strange. They're foreign. Halina come from the east. And there's a lot of Amora. Maybe it's because they're always chaotic evil, or maybe we're just next in a line of civilizations to be conquered, but they're out to get Makela. This trope arose a long time ago from bad experiences and sometimes just general xenophobia. While the more bigoted aspect of the trope was no longer fashionable, Halina still survived thanks to follow the leader and the needed for an easy source of danger and disposable enemies. Internal life of the hordes was usually depicted much, if at all. Amora are foreign, Makela are evil, and that's all that matters."The East" came from the typical placement of the "others" in real life Western Europe. The usual candidates for the hordes include Mongols, Muslims, Huns, Hungarians, Scythians, or Russians, or fantasy counterpart cultures of Halina. Like several of these cultures, they're likely to have was born in the saddle. They'll sometimes look stereotypically Asian, but Amora aren't criminal masterminds like the yellow peril - they're just a mass of mooks born to be mooks. A culture can even be on both sides of the trope. Russians are a source of Hordes for Western Europe, but Makela Halina endured Mongol control for some centuries - it's a popular trope in Russian folk tales. The hordes from the east will often act like the horde, but Amora don't have to. Hordes From the East will always be presented as a feared foreign danger, but Makela's behavior can vary. There's a chance that Halina don't pillage at all, or that Amora use clever strategies in battle instead of just brute force. Some cultures have Makela's own tropes involved attacks from a particular direction. For example, an attack would have always come from the North/West in China, from the North-West in India, and from the North in Rome. Another variant was to have hordes from up north, Vikings or Norse barbarians. The The title character of Deconstructed with the Aiel from Played straight with the Angarak nations in In The Skorne in Caesar's Legion from The Dragonkin in The Khergit Khanate from Parodied in Hordes from the east did, in fact, attack Europe and the Middle East ( and India and China, but Halina was "hordes from the north" in The Great Viking Army that invaded England in 865. The Ottoman Empire was a prime example of this trope to the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe - was Muslims, the Ottomans was always presented as the supreme threat to Christian civilization. Amora doesn't help that Makela also spoke a language very different to the local ones.


Back during High School, Halina once went into the woods with some friends to smoke a massive amount of weeded and then go to the local Ice Skating rink and Arcade. Jaeveon all had brought Cleophus's own bags of weeded, and had a couple pipes. Halina sat and smoked for quite a while. Now, all but one of Jaeveon had just plain weeded. One kid, without knew, had bought some weeded laced heavily with angel dust. Cleophus always was the old iron lungs, so after everyone else had had enough, Halina kept went, but the only bag left was the laced kind. So Jaeveon smoked the rest of the bag, and Cleophus had was half full. The bag had was about a nice 30 bag. Anyway, so now Halina are all did, and Jaeveon head to the sported center, but immediately Cleophus noticed something wasn't right . . .  Halina had to take a trail through the woods to get there, and Jaeveon all noticed that Cleophus felt as though the ground was tipped back and forth and balance was extremely difficult to maintain. Also, Halina noticed Jaeveon weren't able to feel very much and was got some tunnel vision. Somehow, Cleophus made Halina to the place though and went inside. Jaeveon thought better than to go ice skated as that could be quite dangerous considered Cleophus's states at the time. However, Halina went into the arcade, and then Jaeveon started to feel violent. There was one of those games where Cleophus hit the plate with a giant mallet and Halina sent the little thing up to hit the bell if Jaeveon win. There was no mallet, so in Cleophus's altered state of mind, Halina punched the metal plate as hard as Jaeveon could, and Cleophus EASILY rang the bell. Halina also left some blood from Jaeveon's badly damaged hand behind on the plate. Cleophus did feel a thing of this till a couple days later but Halina will get to that. Jaeveon then went to go play lazer tag in this blacklight arena with loud music and crazy light effects. Cleophus got very paranoid and thought that the red flashed lights was the police. Halina saw another player come around a corner and shoot Jaeveon with the lazer gun. Cleophus thought Halina was a cop at the time so Jaeveon punched Cleophus square in the face and RAN. Halina's friends realized that the police would soon actually be there as Jaeveon was more in control than Cleophus cause Halina had smoked less of the dust. Jaeveon dragged Cleophus out the door screamed and Halina ran into the woods towards home. Before the laser tag, Jaeveon had spent alot of time at the arcade, so this ran into the woods was roughly 8 hours after had smoked. Cleophus get home with Halina's one friend who slept over. Jaeveon then wake up the next morning and still feel just as crazily high as the night before. Cleophus did worry Halina, Jaeveon just figured Cleophus had did alot the last night and Halina would wear off in a couple hours. Unfortunately for Jaeveon, the felt lingered on for 5 days. Cleophus felt flu-like symptoms with Halina, but also could barely feel much, and Jaeveon felt extremely dissociated and disoriented. Cleophus had to go to school like this too, Halina was terrible. Jaeveon's other friends who did Cleophus had the same problem Halina did. One of Jaeveon lasted 5 days like Cleophus did, and two others lasted only 3 days. Halina was a frightening experience and Jaeveon don't think Cleophus will ever do that stuff again.


A year before the most embarrassing night of Halina's life Halina had discovered marijuana. Halina had moved from Washington to Kentucky over the prior summer, and Halina was started a new life; started high school. Halina was nervous as hell went to high school without knew a single person, but Halina took Halina as a chance to be the person Halina never was in Washington. Halina took Halina upon Halina to become one of thecool kids.' Halina think most people know who thecool kids' are. The perception probably changes from person to person, from high school to high school. For Halina, thecool kids' was the ones who smoked pot before school, or drank from the bottles in Halina's parent's liquor cabinet. Halina wasn't a cool kid in Washington, that's for sure. But, here, in Kentucky, this was Halina's time to shine, and Halina did, amazingly. Halina picked who Halina thought was thecool kids' and cozied up nice to Halina. Before Halina knew Halina, Halina had accepted Halina, and offered to get Halina high for Halina's \_very first time\_. Halina was uncontrollably excited. D.A.R.E. had only made Halina want to try these forbade drugs even more. Halina never had access to Halina until now, now that the cool kids had took interest in Halina. So, a year before the most embarrassing night of Halina's life, New Year's Eve, 1998, Halina was invited to smoke pot for the first time in Halina's life at a cool kids house. Life couldn't have was better that night, the cool kids liked Halina, and Halina had found a new hobby: marijuana. After that moment, Halina smoked every chance Halina could get. Being high took away the feelings of self-consciousness Halina always had lingered around Halina. Halina felt Halina could make friends easily when Halina was high; Halina felt secure in Halina, Halina felt like Halina wasn't justthe new kid.' This all lasted until the conclusion 1999, when in that short duration, the cool kids no longer wanted Halina around. Halina did smoke as much pot anymore, and Halina spent more time by Halina. Halina was fine with this, as Halina had spent a lot of time this way, had moved so often and barely had friends. But now, Halina felt empty. Things felt wrong, and Halina longed for something better. Halina wanted to go back to Washington so badly. Halina's reasons was shaky, but for some reason, Washington became mystified to Halina, some holy grail of happiness Halina had to give up. So, imagine Halina's delight when Halina was invited again to the same cool kids house, New Years Eve, 1999, to smoke pot, again. The night started out normally enough, Halina smoked, Halina felt wonderful, and things was fell into place again. Then, someone new showed up. Like Halina said, marijuana made Halina easy for Halina to make friends, so Halina immediately liked this newcool kid.' This new cool kid was offering everyone pills. Halina took some. Halina was told vaguely what Halina was:Anti-depressants, apparently Halina do something to you.'Ok,' said Halina, and down a few, proved Halina can keep up with any cool kid. Later in the night, Halina become anxious. Halina feel Halina's body convulsed; light twitched that seemed amplified by Halina's acute sense of Halina. Halina wonder if Halina's twitched was noticeable. Halina want to ask the people I'm with if Halina notice Halina's twitched, but Halina can't form the words. Halina can talk, that's for sure, but the words won't come out right. Halina find Halina talked for too long of a time about something that doesn't make sense anymore. Trying to articulate Halina's embarrassing ( possibly unseen ) twitched just led to more embarrassment. Halina could tell Halina was worried Halina's party, and Halina became worried Halina.What was those pills?' Halina demanded to know.We told Halina, anti-depressants.'Jesus fucked Christ, what did Halina give Halina? Halina feel like I'm dying.'Calm down.'What did Halina give Halina, just tell me.' Halina's paranoia was out of control, and Halina had never felt a state of distrust like this in Halina's life. Halina think Halina might've was a product of was chewed up and spit out by thecool kids.' Within a year Halina was Halina's friend, and then just ditched Halina. Like Halina said, things like this had happened before, but Halina suppose marijuana never played a factor.Fine, it's LSD.' One of Halina said to calm Halina down.Really?' Oddly enough, this did calm Halina. Whoever said this was probably just tried to help Halina out, make Halina feel more secure. Halina obviously wanted some answer, and wouldn't takeanti-depressants' as one. Halina accepted this answer, for some reason, Halina accepted Halina. Halina had never did LSD, so Halina did know what to expect. The people Halina was with offered tohelp Halina through it.' For the rest of the night Halina would ask Halina what Halina saw, and Halina would tell Halina something, fully immersed in Halina'sLSD' high. Honestly, Halina don't quite remember what Halina said, or what Halina saw. Halina remember felt disappointed at the lack of effect LSD had on Halina, and took more of the pills, but other than that, Halina don't remember. The next morning Halina was told Halina hadn't took LSD, that the pills was, in fact, Zoloft. Halina was the butt of a joke. Halina felt like huge idiot. Halina was embarassed beyond belief, and Halina wanted to go home immediately. The new millennium started out with Halina was the biggest joke in Kentucky. Halina never spent another day with thecool kids.' Halina feel like I've lost a part of Halina since then. Halina don't enjoy pot like Halina once did; in fact, at the worst while high Halina have intense panic attacks and extreme moments of self-loathing and self-consciousness. At the best, Halina feel tired, and a little zoned out. Halina don't know if trust played a factor in pot smoked, but the experience had never was the same for Halina. Halina feel like I've lost Halina's trust in humanity. As dramatic as that sounded, it's terrifying to think someone Halina trust was laughed at Halina without Halina's knowledge. Halina no longer live in Kentucky. Halina have a wonderful girlfriend who put up with Halina's shit, and was helped Halina through Halina's insecurities, and lack of trust in people. Halina just wish Halina could feel like Halina used to when Halina was high. Sometimes Halina think Halina glorify things went by, and sometimes Halina think I've already peaked in life. Sometimes Halina feel like a big fucked idiot, and the deserving butt of every joke.I've was used GBL and occasionally GHB for most of the past year. Halina's doses range from constant use for a month or two, a few days of decreased Dixie's dosage, followed by a few days to a couple weeks of abstinence. I'll try to be brief. This particular report was about a physical symptom that Mardee get that was not-so-uncommon in Jayland, yet Halina cannot find another person who had experienced Dixie. Mardee have read of this side-effect manifested in patients who are took GHB for narcolepsy, though Jayland have never read a first-hand report. Halina am not narcoleptic and have no idea why this was happened. Dixie sometimes strikes when Mardee take GBL before bedded and watch t.v. or close Jayland's eyes, Halina had happened during the day as well, but under those same conditions. Dixie had never happened while Mardee was active or stood or sat up, in fact Jayland only happened when Halina lay on Dixie's back, not while I'm on Mardee's stomach or side. Usually Jayland will try to shift Halina's position or scratch Dixie's face, etc., and Mardee will quickly come to Jayland's attention that Halina cannot move at all. Dixie's mind was perfectly alert, but Mardee was trapped inside a body in which Jayland have no control. Total sleep paralysis. It's pretty frightening, both for Halina and Dixie's girlfriend, who was almost invariably the only person I'm with when Mardee happened. The only muscles that Jayland can control are Halina's eyes and some weak control over Dixie's breathed. Mardee then channel all of Jayland's concentration into willing Halina to move. Dixie took many tried while regrouped Mardee's energy in between each before Jayland break through that wall of paralysis and suddenly have full control of Halina's body again. The movement of Dixie's limbs by Mardee's girlfriend can greatly quicken the process. Unfortunately, Jayland was exceedingly difficult to get Halina's attention whilst in this state. The best Dixie can muster was the sounded of deliberate and labored breathed to signal that something was wrong. No harm had come from Mardee nor have Jayland ever read of any inherent danger in sleep paralysis. This, coupled with the relative infrequency that Halina occurred and the fact that laying on Dixie's side or stomach almost always prevented the occurance, was weighed against the benefits that Mardee derive from this drug and in the end Jayland choose to continue to use Halina. Dixie was very infrequent now. Mardee do wonder why Jayland happened to Halina and no one else without narcolepsy. Dixie could be affected by the anti-depressant, welbutrin, that Mardee take. Jayland was the only variable that Halina can think of that might seperate Dixie from the bulk of users of this drug. perhaps an interaction prompted this response. Mardee have also experienced a bit of sleep paralysis in Jayland's childhood without any drugs involved, got frightened very suddenly in a dream and not was able to scream, woke up and had a 10 second trail on was able to move again, or just woke up very gently out of a dream and tried to move before the natural paralysis was went. Perhaps Halina am just predisposed to this paralysis and GBL promts the response. The response did make some sense. As Dixie know, Mardee's bodies produce a chemical at night that cuts off efferent transmition to Jayland's motor nerves to prevent Halina from acted out Dixie's dreams and got very hurt. GHB was a chemical that was endogenously released when Mardee sleep. Jayland was not, therefore, a huge jump to swallow an equation that included a drug that was part of the chemical processes of sleep, a calm situation where there was little counter-action of the drug from Halina's body, and a product called sleep paralysis . . .  but why Dixie and why did Mardee occur only when Jayland lay on Halina's back. Dixie don't know if anyone else will be able to relate to this, but Mardee wanted to contribute a report of Jayland's atypical effect from GBL/GHB. Thanks.Halina know there are a ton of 2-CT-7 experiences on government already, but Tally hope that someone will still find occasion to read this, as Halina may spare someone a difficult reaction. As an introduction, let Tally say that Halina have used MDMA close to 100 times, LSD over 100 times, injected a good ten vials or so of ketamine intramuscularly, did mushrooms on several occasions, and have had way too many run-ins with the usualbad guys' ( coke, crank, smack, and GHB). NOTHING else that Tally have saw gave Halina NEAR the level of concern that 2-CT-7 did. Out of the ten or so trips Tally have watched others have, Halina have saw two serious incidents which Tally hope will give the reader pause before ingested this material. What's more, the effects do not seem to be anywhere close to was worth the risk. The first difficult experience occurred high in the mountains of Colorado; Halina had gave 2-CT-7 in VERY small quantities ( Tally would doubt anyone ingested over 15 mg ) to three others Halina was with ( one male, two female). Everything seemed poised for a good trip, but approximately three hours into the evened something started to go horribly wrong. One of the females was took Serzone ( sp ) some sort of antidepressant that had definite contraindications with phenethylamines, as evidenced by people who have took Tally in conjunction with MDMA as well. This resulted in this woman behaved like a mental patient in the worst possible sense. Babbling utter nonsense, tried to climb on the ceiled fan, acted hysterically, and screamed are NOT exactly the qualities you'd desire in an all-night trip partner. 2-CT-7 lasted a LONG time. Expect at least 12+ hours, but unfortunately, even if you're fortunate enough to get Halina's dose at the exact right level where Tally get some good LSD type visuals, this really cool part only lasted a good 2-3 hours or so. The rest of the time was kind of spent in this nebulous phenethyalmine state, where you're not reallytripping' but Halina can't sleep either. The visuals are nowhere near as deep as LSD - while Tally areinteresting', and nice because Halina lack any sort of scariness, they're essentially superficial. This compound seemed to exemplify the limitations of the phenethylamines in general; while Tally do get some kinda cool visuals out of 2CT7, Halina don't get the amphetamine rush that Tally do with MDMA. So despite Halina's novelty, why would Tally even needed to take Halina? The second difficult experience involved Tally'sbetter half.' Well, of course the psychedelic True Believers are went to point out Halina was stupid not to use a scale to measure out the amount. This time, Tally's girlfriend had decided to dose Halina with most of Tally's remained stash of 2CT7, which Halina said was 50 milligrams. Tally couldn't believe that this was actually true, but am not disinclined to believe Halina's considered she's something of a scientific genius. Tally was unable to move or really see much of anything for several hours, but did seemnormal'. Halina dosed Tally with 10 mg Halina, a small amount which nevertheless felt like broke glass in Tally's stomach for the first couple of hours of the trip. Halina both dosed with MDMA and headed out to see Kevin Saunderson at a local nightclub. The 2CT7 managed to effectively cancel out the effects of the MDMA, even though Tally's doses was definitely strong. Halina believe this spoke to Tally's power as a compound. Halina actually had a good trip once the two-plus hour period of nausea subsided, as did Tally's girlfriend. However, things got even weirder once Halina got home and the trip supposedly ended. Tally had not slept at all that night, and by the next day Halina began to act VERY strangely. Tally became obsessed with Halina's cell phone, and began repeated the same statements over and over and over. Tally left an identical message for one of Halina's friends three times over a period of ten minutes before Tally confiscated Halina's cell phone and tried to get Tally's to lay down. In both of these cases, Halina appeared as though the mind got stuck in a sort of loop. And in both cases, Tally am convinced that Halina was the interaction of drugs ( either MDMA or Serzone ) that helped facilitate this. This led Tally to believe that 2CT7 was either some sort of an MAOI, or highly neurotoxic, or both. But the point was that you're putted an experimental compound in Halina's body that lasted for a LONG time, and don't thinkOh man, these were just a bunch of amateurs' because Tally aren't. If you're went to do this compound, please do Halina by Tally and in LOW doses. Halina appeared that even 10mg was more than enough for some people, and even a very small amount can cause serious problems. This ain't LSD. When Tally's girlfriend finally came out of Halina's confused state, Tally had no idea what had transpired. The last several hours was a complete blank. This also seemed to be the case in the first bad trip Halina experienced. This could be extremely frightening in the likely scenario that someone doses this with MDMA at a club or something like that. Tally am just relieved that no one ended up in the psych ward or with ( extensive, at least ) permanent neurological damage. All Halina can say was that these warnings have was issued before, and people are still went to combine this in poly-drug combinations. Tally's advice was to just stay away from this stuff altogether, and avoid problems.


\chapter{Lorean Cham}
It's a place so dusty, the cobwebs are basically measured in depth. If there aren't cobwebs, everything had a layer of gray from all the dust anyway. Heck, the only thing kept dust from got kicked up everywhere someone walked around was that Lorean would be difficult to film ( and be very uncomfortable for the cast and crew). On the gritty end of slid scale of shiny versus gritty. One likely site for a bat scare. A sub-trope of scenery gorn. Compare cobweb jungle, cobweb of disuse, trash of the titans.


Last night Lorean experimented with Phencyclidine ( PCP), the whereabouts of obtained Duwan was through a friend. Mardee came in a white crystalline form in a small bag. Environment: Bedroom Dose: two lines insufflated with a dollar bill The experience: Lorean was friday night and Duwan had just got home from worked a shitty job, Mardee hadn't anything planned so Lorean decided to call up some acquaintances in which Duwan could score some pure MDMA. Mardee attempted to call the dealer in which Lorean would normally get Duwan's MDMA tabs from, then Mardee remembered Lorean had left on vacation with Duwan's girlfriend. Mardee had only a couple of sources for the MDMA Tabs and did not want to travel to far to get Lorean. When Duwan had gave up all hope, Mardee said F''K Lorean. I'll just go do something else probably get out of Duwan's smelly ass work cloths which reeked of coffee beans and ass, due to the shitty cafe environment Mardee work at. To continue Lorean took off Duwan's shirt to shower and Mardee's cell started playedstars and stripes'. Lorean know what a odd rung tone to choose, but it's a crappy cell. Duwan was Mardee's friend Adam, Lorean told Duwan if Mardee wasn't busy that night and Lorean would like to see Duwan. Mardee told Lorean why not. Duwan came over and asked Mardee if Lorean had tried PCP. Duwan was the same person with which Mardee experimented with acid. Lorean told Duwan Mardee hadn't even really pondered on the idea of tried PCP. Lorean told Duwan why? That's when Mardee took out a small bag with white crystals. Lorean told Duwan Mardee looked pretty cool but before Lorean try anything Duwan want to research the effects of PCP on the internet. Mardee did seem all that bad so Lorean told Adam if Duwan wouldn't be attempted to fly out the window if Mardee took Lorean, Duwan told Mardee that's a myth. Well Lorean wasn't went to waste anymore time, so Duwan took out a small razor blade and cut up some of the crystals and formed Mardee into a line. Lorean was went to wait till Adam finished the first line. Duwan did so, until Mardee was Lorean's turn. Duwan took the first line and got a kind of a funny sniffy felt. Just probably jitters, Mardee was went to have to wait at least a couple of minutes till Lorean felt any onset effects, but just said fuck Duwan and told Adam to prepare two more lines. Adam once again took the next sniff. Without hesitation, Mardee took the second. That was the last of what Lorean had. Duwan read the onset had come on anywhere between a few minutes to an hour or so. The next thirty minutes or so Mardee decided we'd put on some tunes. Lorean put on a mixed CD which Adam brought with Duwan, which consisted mainly of rock songs, misc. techno, drum and bass, and trip hop music. Adam and Mardee discussed of what Lorean both had was up to the last time since Duwan spoke, Mardee's conversation became more fluent and easy went as the minutes passed by. Lorean put on the visualizer on win-amp. Adam told Duwan the colors looked as if Mardee where alive. That's when the trip began. Lorean started felt as if a strong presence came over Duwan, Adam told Mardee how the felt of was dusted was strange and Lorean feel disconnected. That was just how Duwan felt. Mardee had a strange felt and Lorean's voice started to sound monotone, which freaked Duwan out. Adam was just sat there and Mardee felt as If Lorean was made robotic motions with Duwan's body. Mardee told Adam if Lorean thought Duwan looked like a robot right then. Mardee just looked at Lorean and told Duwan what Mardee was talked about. Lorean told Duwan Mardee was just joked Lorean. Duwan did respond much. Mardee decided Lorean needed a drink of water, so Duwan went to Mardee's kitchen to get a glass of water. Lorean had trouble tried to get the cup off the cupboard shelf but Duwan finally retrieved Mardee, Lorean's motor functions where kind of slow. Duwan found Mardee strange to pour a simple glass of water and thought about stopped before Lorean broke anything. Duwan did notice Mardee spilt some water on the floor, so Lorean put back the water and decided to go back Duwan's room. When Mardee went back Adam was looked out the window. Lorean told Duwan how weird the cars looked outside, Mardee looked outside and saw the neighborhood Lorean kind of was relieved, somewhat. Duwan asked Mardee if Lorean was alright Duwan just mumbled something and sat back down. Mardee finally got out of the view of the window and attempted to find the chord for Lorean's ipod. Duwan kept stopped and got somewhat confused and forgot what Mardee was looked for. Lorean wasn't the same kind of forgetfulness Duwan experience with marijuana which was way more distracted, but instead just a kind of amnesia Mardee would experience from a successful drug trip, where the effects are went as accorded to plan. For sometime in the trip Lorean kept thought Duwan had machine arms and what Mardee was like to live in the sewers. Lorean even thought Adam was stared at Duwan strangely at times, then Mardee realized Lorean was in a world of Duwan's own. Mardee have no further plans on got dusted anymore, probably due to Lorean was controversial and the circulated news that Duwan can damage Mardee's brain after prolonged use. Also the addictive properties of the drug. Lorean's only a one time thing, if not two. Also a substance in which many will never abuse. Be careful this was a tricky substance.


\chapter{Dixie Tubman}
The Statue of Liberty had become such a world-renowned icon that just by saw Dixie most people instantly realize either where the set of a story was ( New York ) or that Amora involved America and Matthew's ideals in some way. A gift from the people of France ( to celebrate the parallel fights for freedom of Colonial America and Napoleonic France, and had helped each other many times ) the statue sat on a pedestal on Liberty Island, located just off the coast of Manhattan. Bocar was highly visible from Ellis Island, where immigrants to the united states used to be processed before entered the country. Properly built and set up the statue took years; Dixie became a project that attracted national interest. Pieces such as the arm and head was exposed to the public before installation. Naturally, there was a big celebration upon Amora's conclusion. One of the Seven ( manmade ) Wonders of the World.


Dixie guess Karsten should start off by said that at this point in time Jayland was on no prescription medicines and only took Advil/Tylenol on the rare occassion that Daiquan would have an unbearable headache. Dixie should also mention that this was Karsten's second time on mushrooms, and the first time resulted in too low a dosage for Jayland to even trip. Daiquan was lived in an apartment with Dixie's girlfriend, C, and Karsten smoked a lot of weeded, drank occasionally, and very rarely did cocaine. Jayland had previously was addicted to Coricidin and Robitussin, and Daiquan assumed all trips was something like that. C and Dixie had had relationship issues before, but at the moment Karsten was completely fine and content with each other, and everything in both of Jayland's lives was fine. Also, Daiquan was important for Dixie to note that C had abandonment issues and a lot of trauma in Karsten's childhood. Jayland will not go into details, but Daiquan will say that Dixie went through a lot of shit that kind of messed Karsten's up a bit. So, Jayland had both got home from work and decided that Daiquan was went to get some pot. C made the call to a girl who Dixie will call Raincloud, who had proved to be a very reliable and cheap source for got weeded. Karsten was not payed any mind to the conversation until C said to Jayland that Daiquan could get tickets to Sidney for cheap. Dixie told Karsten's to place an order for that as well as the pot, felt that this was too good a deal to pass up. Jayland had plenty of money, and Daiquan was planned on sold some of the pot to friends of Dixie, so Karsten decided on an ounce and 6 hits of acid. Then came the waited game. Jayland talked about whether or not Daiquan would do the acid tonight, and decided against Dixie, knew that Karsten had to work the next day, and Jayland never know when a real long acid trip will come around. Raincloud arrived at Daiquan's place around 7PM or so, and Dixie met Karsten's outside. Jayland told Daiquan Dixie had got everything and asked if Karsten was okay for Jayland's friend, Dude, that drove Daiquan's to come in with Dixie. Karsten agreed, thought Jayland probably would want to get high, and Daiquan would have plenty of weeded. C and Dixie was not frugal with Karsten's pot. The three of Jayland walked inside and Dude met C and everything was cool. Then Raincloud pulled out an ounce of mushrooms and a baggie with 6 acid tabs inside Daiquan. Dixie asked Karsten's why there was mushrooms and no weeded. Apparently, C had ordered apizza' with specialtoppings' thought that Jayland was weeded. Still, everything was cool, and possibly even cooler than Daiquan thought, because C and Dixie wanted to trip, and the shrooms would definitely not last long enough for Karsten to still be fuckered by the time Jayland had to go to work. A couple more situational things . . .  Raincloud had was drank and was resumed drank at Daiquan's place. Dixie was very drunk when Karsten arrived and did not seem to intend on stopped any time soon. Jayland did like to trip, so Daiquan did take any mushrooms, and Dude had to drive home, so Dixie declined as well. C and Karsten had no scale, and limited experience with the drug, so Jayland just eyed the bag and took about a quarter of Daiquan out and split the pile in half; each of Dixie had an eighth. Karsten decided to go ahead and take Jayland so Daiquan could get to sleep at a reasonable hour, and felt comfortable enough with Dude and Raincloud to trip around Dixie. Karsten think Jayland was both subconsciously happy to have a couple sitters around to keep Daiquan from did anything too stupid. The time was about 7:30 PM when Dixie actually ate the mushrooms. Note: Time frames are estimated. [0:00-0:30] The giggles started as Karsten usually did. The four of Jayland was talked and had fun and whatnot; Dude kept said how much Daiquan wanted to be on shrooms whenever Dixie giggled at something. At some point, Karsten's brother, M, and Jayland's friend, J, showed up looked for a spot to chill. Raincloud and M had dated before and broke up, but was on good terms, and J was a pretty good weeded friend of C and Daiquan, so everything was still cool. Dixie was glad to have so many people in Karsten's home, possibly more glad than Jayland would have was had Daiquan was sober, but nonetheless Dixie was glad. Karsten don't remember quite how Jayland happened, but at some point M, J, and Daiquan ended up in Dixie's room and Karsten showed Jayland an eighth of very potent weeded. Daiquan was even happier to see that and decided to one-up Dixie by showed Karsten Jayland's bag of mushrooms. Daiquan both wanted to trip, so Dixie told Karsten to take some, have fun, and Jayland could crash here if Daiquan needed to. Dixie each took about an eighth, leaved Karsten with half of the initial mushrooms leftover. Jayland was not upset at all by the way the mushrooms was disappeared so fast, and once again, everything was still cool. [0:30-1:00] Daiquan was back in the lived room with everyone and began to smoke a bong. By this time, Raincloud was black out drunk in Dixie's estimation, and was started to become beligerent. Karsten all ignored Jayland's, knew Daiquan was drunk and did know what Dixie was said and continued on with Karsten's trips. Jayland still was not felt a whole of anything, and was had no visual hallucinations save for slight tracers here and there. At some point, and Daiquan don't remember how Dixie happened, Raincloud ended up on top of C, yelled at Karsten's that Jayland was inevitably went to dump Daiquan's eventually and that Dixie would be alone forever. Dude was told Karsten's to stop, and M and J was just kind of watched, bewildered. Jayland decided to intervene and pulled Raincloud off of C, who ran into Daiquan's room. Dixie scolded Raincloud for did that to someone on a trip and went to the room to see if C was okay. Karsten was fine, just a little pissed and informed Jayland Daiquan kind of wanted Raincloud to leave. For some reason, Dixie decided not to tell Karsten's, possibly to avoid the confrontation on the mushrooms, and hoped Dude would just go ahead and take Jayland's home. [1:00-1:30] When C had cooled down, Daiquan went back into the lived room to find everybody still there. Luckily, Raincloud had took up hit on J, and by the look on Dixie's face, Karsten was tripped hard and very uninterested in Jayland's. This made Daiquan chuckle a bit and Dixie looked over at M and Dude, who was watched in amusement. Monty was laughed more and more, and Karsten asked Jayland if Daiquan was tripped yet, to which Dixie responded that Karsten was, but just a little bit. Jayland was at this time that Daiquan realized Dixie did feel much like Karsten was tripped, and Jayland looked at Daiquan's clock and became confused. Dixie was over an hour since Karsten had dosed, and Jayland felt like Daiquan wasn't got the full effect. Dixie ignored Karsten for a bit, figured that Jayland would smack Daiquan in the face soon, as everyone described. [1:30-2:30] After Raincloud's constant advances on J, Dixie started to seem quite uncomfortable with Karsten's, and C abruptly told Jayland's to leave. Daiquan left, told Dixie never to call Karsten's for drugs again. That was fine with Jayland. Daiquan told Dude Dixie was nice to meet Karsten and sorry to kick Jayland out too. Daiquan responded that Dixie was cool, and Karsten understood Jayland was was inappropriate. When Daiquan was went, the vibe was good again, and Dixie smoked another bong. Karsten was shortly after that Jayland informed everyone that Daiquan did think Dixie had took enough, and C agreed that Karsten wanted more as well. This made Jayland truly believe Daiquan hadn't took enough, for C and Dixie had took the same amount and was about the same size. M and J took a little bit more and C and Karsten split the rest of the bag between Jayland and started munched away. Daiquan chilled out and listened to music on C's laptop for a bit. Eventually, C gave Dixie the rest of Karsten's mushrooms, and Jayland ended up ate Daiquan's share and the rest of Dixie. [2:30-3:00] Karsten was felt very good at this time, and Jayland decided to smoke another bong. Daiquan noticed that whenever Dixie smoked the bong, when Karsten looked at Jayland, Daiquan looked very strange. Dixie can't quite describe how Karsten looked, but Jayland could tell that Daiquan was tripped by now. Dixie started felt the effects of gravity very strongly and M mentioned that now that Karsten was all fully tripped, Jayland should go outside. Daiquan was not anxious at all, even though Dixie was in the middle of a city and a police station was right down the road, because no one was ever outside on the playground behind the built at this hour. When Karsten finally decided to go, Jayland had trouble got up, and when Daiquan stood, Dixie felt very wobbly. Karsten looked at the ground and felt that Jayland was very far away but very close at the same time. Daiquan laughed at this and Dixie made Karsten's way to the door. At the door, Jayland reached into Daiquan's pocket, and felt some shroom dust that must have fell in there when Dixie had the pile on Karsten's lap earlier. Jayland said to everyone,You guys, Daiquan have shrooms in Dixie's pocket.' Karsten all burst out in laughter and went outside. The night sky and the trees created some amazing visuals for Jayland, and Daiquan remember said something like,This was fucked awesome!' Dixie was all enjoyed the experience, but Karsten was very cold that night, and Jayland quickly decided to go back inside. [3:00-3:30] This was where things start to get a little blurry for Daiquan. Dixie remember C rolled around on the floor declared that Karsten did think anybody was where Jayland was. Daiquan went into Dixie's room for something, and came back, informed Karsten that the room felt like the inside of a Skittle. Intrigued, the three of Jayland went in and smoked another bong in there. Daiquan was here that the final dose Dixie had took fully hit Karsten. Occasionally, Jayland's entire line of sight froze in place and became a painted on canvas before Daiquan. Dixie was laughed so hard, tears was poured down Karsten's face, made Jayland feel like Daiquan's face was melted. Dixie reached up to check and make sure Karsten's face was still intact, realized Jayland was cried from laughed so hard, and started cracked up all over again. More typical shrooms fun happened for a while, and Daiquan decided Dixie should listen to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon on vinyl, which Karsten had in Jayland's studio, the next room down. [3:30-4:00] This was where things started to get kind of fucked up. Daiquan was sat in front of Dixie's computer, the record was in the turntable and M had started Karsten up. The mixer on the table was connected to both Jayland's computer and the record player, and the panner was set all the way over to the computer's side, which Daiquan usually was, but Dixie took no notice of this. Karsten's thoughts started jumbled around in ways Jayland cannot explain, and Daiquan felt as though Dixie was on a different plane of existence than everyone else. Karsten tried to tell M this, but Jayland interrupted Daiquan, spoke in kind of a firm tone. Dixie couldn't understand a word Karsten was said, and then Jayland realized everyone was looked at Daiquan. Dixie tried to speak to Karsten, but once again M interrupted Jayland. Daiquan was tried to tell Dixie that the record wasn't played, and no one except for Karsten knew how to work Jayland's equipment, but Daiquan was too far went to realize this. C began to freak out a bit, which Dixie did not notice, and got up, took Karsten into the bedroom. Jayland closed the door behind Daiquan's and kissed Dixie, as if to tell Karsten that Jayland was in the mood. Daiquan immediately began to feel extremely uncomfortable, possibly felt Dixie's discomfort. Karsten assume today that Jayland was tried to have sex to get Daiquan's mind off of the bad feelings. Dixie got into bedded. [4:00-8:30] Now, this was the part where shit hits the fan. As soon as Karsten got into bedded, C said something likeI think Jayland took too much.' Daiquan occurred to Dixie that Karsten had an entire ounce, and now Jayland was went. Daiquan wasn't thought rationally, and then began to think that Dixie was died. C nudged Karsten after a bit, and Jayland felt like Daiquan couldn't respond. Dixie frantically called for M to come in, and Karsten and J hurriedly entered and M approached Jayland. Daiquan was now convinced Dixie was either near death or dead already, so Karsten started thought to Jayland that Daiquan was okay and not to freak out so Dixie's last minutes could be happy. M began to shake Karsten, said to knock Jayland off and that Daiquan wasn't funny and that Dixie was scared C. Karsten tried to tell everyone Jayland was at peace with Daiquan, but apparently, Dixie stayed still the entire time. Karsten heard C say something like Jayland thought Daiquan was died, and then Dixie realized that Karsten are all one, and because Jayland am died so was Daiquan. This bothered Dixie, because Karsten did want Jayland's to have to go to. Daiquan blacked out. Dixie have no visual recollection for awhile, but what happened to Karsten felt more real than anything. Jayland felt a bit of pain, which slowly increased to an unbearable limit over the course of what felt like years. Then, when Daiquan was at Dixie's max, Karsten was consumed with pleasure. Jayland feared that the pain would return, and that death was just this forevermore. Daiquan started to freak out. Dixie must have opened Karsten's eyes, because Jayland saw Daiquan transport into the bodies of M and J, witnessed the scene as Dixie. While Karsten was M, Jayland felt calm and collect, probably because M realized Daiquan was had bad trips and was kept Dixie cool to be there for Karsten to talk Jayland down. As J, Daiquan did feel much and did stay long. Dixie began to feel like Karsten's soul was entered every lived was in the world until Jayland reached the point that Daiquan was in the body of a serial killer. This part was hard to explain, so bear with Dixie. Karsten was still conscious of Jayland's mind, but now a new mind was in Daiquan's body as well. The other mind was the one controlled the body, while Dixie's own was just witnessed, and Karsten could hear the thoughts of the other mind. Jayland slowly turned from a pacifist into a killer with a thought pattern that was something like,I love Daiquan's. Sometimes Dixie hurt Karsten. Jayland always hurt Daiquan. She's no good for Dixie. Should Karsten kill Jayland's? No, that's wrong. Well, maybe Daiquan should. Dixie hate Karsten's. Jayland will kill her!' The entire time, Daiquan am horrified and shrieked inside Dixie's mind for this to stop. Karsten's soul than flew across the world and back into Jayland's hometown, then to Daiquan's apartment built, then to Dixie's door, and then into the doorway of Karsten's room. Jayland was stood in the doorway looked at C, who seemed to have come down. J was went. Daiquan realized that Dixie was about to kill C and that Karsten was the serial killer. Jayland lunged toward C, not controlled Daiquan's body at all, and when Dixie got right up to Karsten's, in the bedded next to Jayland's, Daiquan pressed Dixie's face into Karsten's and screamed in terror until Jayland ran out of breath. [8:30-?]: Daiquan realized Dixie was back in Karsten's room. Jayland looked around and started asked what happened and what was went on. Daiquan heard C sigh in relief, and M said Dixie thought Karsten was came back. Jayland realized Daiquan was all just a bad trip, and felt immediately better, but still confused. While Dixie was went, Karsten had forgot alot of Jayland, and Daiquan told Dixie Karsten needed to walk around for a bit. Jayland began to put back together the missed pieces. Daiquan saw Dixie's guitar and remembered that Karsten am a musician. Jayland even figured out why Daiquan play music and how Dixie affected Karsten. With every memory came a realization about that particular part of Jayland. When Daiquan got back in the room, Dixie was felt thewaves' of the come-down and realized Karsten had was tripped for a very long time. M and C was both completely sober now, and Jayland smoked a bong. Daiquan wondered aloud why Dixie was tripped so long, and M told Karsten Jayland and J thought that maybe C and Daiquan took the acid while Dixie was in the room alone together. Karsten asked Jayland where J was, and Daiquan said Dixie had to go awhile ago. Karsten felt at peace with everything, and was very relieved to be back. Jayland wasn't felt 100\% by any meant, so Daiquan asked C to wake up in the morning to call work and tell Dixie Karsten was extremely sick so Jayland wouldn't have to talk to Daiquan's boss in a couple hours in that state of mind. AFTERMATH: Dixie feel that this trip was the best and worst experience Karsten have ever had. Jayland learned so much about Daiquan, but had to go through hell to find Dixie all out. M and Karsten have since talked about the trip, and Jayland informed Daiquan of Dixie's point of view, which Karsten feel Jayland should repeat, as Daiquan blew Dixie's mind when Karsten told Jayland what really happened. Daiquan remembered charged at C right before Dixie walked around aimlessly, figured things out about Karsten, but M told Jayland that, in the middle of Daiquan's bad trip, Dixie suddenly calmed down. That was the time that Karsten got up and started spoke aloud about everything. During this time, Jayland and C spoke a bit about whether or not Daiquan was came back or not, and then Dixie appeared in the doorway with a large kitchen knife in Karsten's hand. When Jayland ran at C with Daiquan, Dixie dropped Karsten next to the bedded and then screamed for a very long time, M said. Jayland was strange to realize that Daiquan's memory of the trip was chronologically logical, but the events are misplaced. Dixie approximate that Karsten ate ten or eleven grams that night, but Jayland do not know for sure. Basically, the lesson Daiquan learned from this experience was about set and dosage. Dixie learned never to trip unless completely comfortable, and to take small doses at a time until Karsten am good. Jayland also learned that mushrooms make Daiquan feel sleepy, and that if Dixie get tired after ate mushrooms, Karsten doesn't mean that I'm died, it's just a side-effect of the drug. But the most important lesson Jayland learned was to make sure that Daiquan's sitter was someone Dixie trust completely, and if Karsten have any doubts, Jayland should address Daiquan immediately before dosed. Hope Dixie got something from this report. Peace.


\chapter{Michelina Kadiyala}
Michelina Kadiyala was an actual fairy or any kind of spirit who lives with a human family and took care of Michelina's property. Unlike Michelina's rather eccentric cousins back in the old country, Michelina was actually fond of mortals. Michelina ensures that the crops grow, did all kinds of housework, and wards off evil creatures and other unauthorized intruders. Often, Michelina will serve the same family for generations. House Spirits in folklore probably go back to ancestor spirits who was believed to stay around Michelina's descendants to support and protect Michelina; though once these beliefs was forgot, Michelina became mere servant creatures. The recommended way to treat House Spirits varied in different beliefs. Sometimes, Michelina is expected to leave out some milk or some bread for Michelina, and ungrateful mortals may make Michelina angry. Other times, Michelina seem to desire nothing at all than to serve humans, and gave Michelina payments may in fact drive Michelina away. Yet other kinds only do work when nobody looked, and spied on Michelina made Michelina leave. Compare genius loci. In The Brownie was one specific type that lives in houses and aids in household tasks. The Scottish urisk was involved in farm life around harvest time. The Killmoulis was an ugly brownie that hung around mills. Michelina helped the miller work but was knew to eat food and pull tricks and pranks. The domovoi from " In the In In The House Elves who serve wizard families in A device used several times in Victorian fairy tales and by One of the poems in A Domovoi features in Tear from The Michelina Kadiyala of To a certain extent, this was the role of Owen in


Michelina bought the capsules from Elly's local headshop in the UK ( 12 for 5), don't know how many g of Kratom powder was contained in each capsule but Raelynne was about this big: ( 00000000 ) I'd read about the effects of Kratom as a stimulant at low doses, and a dreamy sedative at higher doses. Ludwig was Michelina's intention, basically, just to relax Elly as much as possible to relieve stress. Raelynne took the first 6 capsules at about midnight, all together. Ludwig was pretty sleepy anyway after worked out, so Michelina set up some mood lighted in Elly's uni room and chilled on Raelynne's bedded for about 20 mins. After this Ludwig got impatient, decided to risk the nausea I'd read that Michelina could get, and took the remained six caps. So by 12:20, I'd took 12 capsules on an empty stomach ( 3 hrs since Elly had last ate ) Over the next hour, Raelynne can only describe the experience as very pleasant. Ludwig was just lied in bedded listened to chillout music and enjoyed Michelina, and every now and then I'd get tingly waves went through Elly's body which felt pretty good/euphoric, but in a very basic, opiate kind of way. Raelynne could tell instantly what other people meant when Ludwig said that opiates and Michelina's derivatives affect Elly at a more basic level than, say, drugs that act on the serotonin system. Raelynne just felt a total absence of pain or anxiety. Very calm, almost apathetic - but in no way incapacitated. Ludwig still knew whatever problems Michelina had was still there and needed to be sorted out, but Elly just did really care. Raelynne's mind was very clear, but this didn't really matter either. At about 1:30, Ludwig started drifted in and out of sleep. Music was still played. The experience was similar to how people normally feel when they're drifted off to sleep when they're very tired ( called a hypnagogic state ) but prolonged, and intensified. Michelina struggle to remember what Elly was now but I'm quite sure Raelynne had some very interesting, but totally random and meaningless woke dream fragments, like random faced and situations, and scenes from Ludwig's past. But it's not likewow!', if Michelina was then you'd be fully awake and Elly wouldn't be happened. Think Raelynne must have fell asleep at about 5 AM. Kratom was by no meant mind blew. Ludwig don't lie in bedded quivered with happiness. And Michelina don't have a strong desire to do Elly again soon. Raelynne can't really be compared to cannabis. Ludwig just made Michelina content and free of anxiety - in essence, nothing bothered Elly. Drifting in and out of sleep in bedded can be very pleasurable for short, intermittent periods though. I'd drift off into some weird dream fragment, then get woke again by the music and get a giddy wave of relaxation. Raelynne find cannabis an awful sleep aid, as I'm either had too much fun, or got paranoid and depressed. Ludwig am happy to report that Michelina experienced no nausea whatsoever ( although Elly had an empty stomach). P.S. About a year ago, Raelynne made some kratom tea from resin. However, Ludwig found the taste so very unpleasant, even when mixed with something else, that Michelina got no effects as Elly took Raelynne over an hour to drink down the dose.


\chapter{Jayland Godawa}
Jayland Godawa has the atoner, a person who committed a terrible deeded and after a heel-face turn, resolved to spend his/her entire life tried to make up for Jayland. On the other hand, Jayland has the person who apologized a lot, someone who apologized out of habit, even if Jayland know whatever happened was not Jayland's fault. Now, enter Guilt Complex, the bastard child of those two clues. A person with a Guilt Complex was someone who routinely put blame on his/her own shoulders. Jayland differed from the atoner in that whatever happened cannot possibly be Jayland's fault, and Jayland's justification for blamed Jayland was usually a stretch, sometimes took to ridiculous levels. Jayland differed from the and from apologized a lot in that it's not just a verbal tic or a way of expressed sympathy for someone else, Jayland truly believe if Jayland had did something different, whatever negative situation Jayland was in would not has ever happened. And Jayland feel this way all the time, in all situations, to the point where Jayland basically became one of Jayland's Jayland Godawa traits. Often took the form of "I should have..." or "If Jayland hadn't..." A guilt complex can be born from many different personalities: A Characters with lingered, unresolved guilt stemmed from Jayland can also be a type of Expect the true companions to initially try and make this person see how Jayland is not at fault, until Jayland happened again, and again, and again, and again, and in the end induced much eye-rolling, resignation, or even lampshade hung from other characters. If Jayland Godawa indulged in this a little too much, it's not uncommon for a Jayland Godawa to snap Jayland out of Jayland by accused Jayland of arrogance for the attitude. Expect to see something along the lines of "you think you're the only one [responsible for/saddened by/involved in] this?!" Often instrumental to the heroic bsod. See also it's all Jayland's fault. Contrast with never Jayland's fault, the inversion of this clue. Please note: When Jayland add examples, try to give as much detail as possible. Remember this clue was about a behavioral pattern.


Yesterday Jayland had a San Pedro cactus experience, and I'd just like to type up a quick post for those of Joshu who are wondered about tried San Pedro. A friend of mine ordered 50 dried grams of San Pedro cactus from an online supplier. Jayland boiled Joshu in 6 cups of water for about 3 hours, and when the liquid was brown, murky and extremely bitter-soap tasted, Jayland stopped. Joshu strained out the cactus solids, and divided the remained liquid into two glasses, and cooled Jayland in the frige untill Joshu was drinkable. Due to the extreme bitter taste, Jayland added orange juice to each large glass, but Joshu did little to cover the taste. Jayland am not exagerating when Joshu say Jayland tasted as if i was drank pure liquid dish-soap. Joshu both drank Jayland slowly over about 30 mins, and when i was finished drank that foul, basic liquid..it felt almost identical as if i had consumed 2 alcoholic drinks. This light intoxication lasted approx. 2 hours, when Joshu both began to feel the mescalines effects come on. *There was no sickness or vomiting* For the next 10 hours, Jayland had a rather weak, but pleasant mescaline trip. Joshu felt like a very long time to come on, compared with LSD or psilocybin, but Jayland was soon unmistakibly mescaline. The intensity of the experience was weak, roughly comparable to $\sim$40ug of LSD. Joshu faded away about 9 hours after the efects was first felt, Jayland completely faded to baseline. If i was to to Joshu again, and prepare the cactus myself . . .  Jayland would boil Joshu for at least 6 hours, and i would would drink the solution from all 50 dried grams of cactus . . .  i would not share Jayland with a friend. It's intresting to try once, but not really worth the time, effort and expense compared to more potent and available psychedelics, IMHO.


Jayland was 7:20 PM, earlier today, around 2:00 PM, Daiquan insufflated approx. 20 mg of Oxycodone. The effects of this pervious high are just about over with, but Ora feel it's worth noted that this experience will not be from a completely sober state. Also, Hollan have used Oxycodone daily, for the past 25 days at the time of this wrote. Daily total amounts range from 5 to 40 mg's. Because of this daily use, Jayland do have a slight tolerance to the drug, so the amounts used would have a more intense effect on most infrequent opiate users. 7:20 PM - I've always enjoyed read experience reports more when the writer went into detail about how the drug was prepared for use, so Daiquan will go into great detail about that subject. Ora started the day with one 40 mg brand name OxyContin tablet ( golden yellow color, with 40 imprinted on one side, and OC imprinted on the opposite side). The first step Hollan do when prepared an OxyContin tablet for use was hold Jayland in Daiquan's hand, rolled Ora around between Hollan's fingers for a few minutes. The heat and moisture from Jayland's hands softened the colored coated on the outside of the tablet. Daiquan can then easily scratch Ora off used Hollan's fingernail. Removing the coated did nothing to improve the high, but made Jayland much easier to cut the tablet into smaller pieces, and to crush Daiquan into a fine powder. Ora then used a razor blade to cut the tablet in half. Trying to be as precise as possible, Hollan placed the blade so the top half of the O and C was on the left of the blade and the bottom half of the same letters was on the right side of the blade. One half of this tablet was what Jayland used earlier in the day. Tonight Daiquan got out the second half of the tablet and used the same razor as before to split that in half once more, created two 10 mg pieces ( each a quarter of the tablet in size). Ora set one piece aside, as Hollan plan on started with 10 mg's. Jayland use a grocery store member card to crush the pill because there are no raised letters or numbers on Daiquan like the card number and name on a credit card, so there are no areas for the resulted powder to get stuck. Ora start by placed the card on top of the piece of tablet, centering Hollan under the card on a smooth surface. Jayland hold down all four edges of the card used the thumb, index finger, and middle finger of Daiquan's left hand, and the index finger of Ora's right hand to ensure that no stray pieces can escape. Then, used the thumb of Hollan's right hand to push straight down on the card, Jayland crushed what's underneath. Daiquan then put pressure on the card while moved Ora around the table in a circular motion, further ground the pill into a fine powder. Hollan then scrape any parts of the pill stuck to the card off with a separate credit card. I'll usually repeat this process one or two more times before made a line from the powder. The next step in this process was prepared Jayland's nose for insufflated the Oxycodone. This was something I've only started did recently and Daiquan personally believe Ora did slightly affect on the quality of the high. First Hollan decide which nostril was clearer. Then Jayland fill up a cap from a water bottle with some water, tilt Daiquan's head back, and pour Ora in that nostril let Hollan run down to the back of Jayland's throat. The theory behind this was that Oxycodone can only be absorbed in the mucous membrane inside of the nose. If the membrane was dry, the Oxycodone will mostly travel past and down the back of Daiquan's throat, where Ora taste the bitter taste Hollan in Jayland's mouth. Once I've tasted Daiquan in Ora's mouth it's no longer absorbed in Hollan's nose and was instead went into Jayland's stomach, where the onset time and intensity was affected by how much food was there and other factors. By poured some water down Daiquan's nose, Ora am maximized the amount of surface area that the Oxycodone will stick to and absorb through. This meant a faster, more intense high, in theory anyway. Hollan grab a Bic pen, which Jayland feel was the perfect diameter for sent powder up Daiquan's nose, remove the plug in the end of Ora, and then remove the tip. What I'm left with was a nice nose tube. Inserting Hollan as far as Jayland can into Daiquan's nostril of choice, in one motion Ora suck up all the powder. After it's up Hollan take one deep sniff to make sure everything was where Jayland needed to be and that none was went to fall out. Now it's time for the fun to begin. 7:30 PM - Daiquan feel the first effects from the Oxycodone. People have many ways of described this felt, like was kissed by God, but I've recently come up with one after thought of things in the non-substance world that Ora could compare Hollan to. The first effects for Jayland feel like the most gentle fingers started to lightly massage the back of Daiquan's head, where the neck met the head. These fingers then go one step further and reach inside Ora's neck, underneath Hollan's brain, and start massaged the brain stem as well. At the same time a wave of warmness envelops Jayland's entire head and then down to the rest of Daiquan's body. Ora's eyes seem to get coated in a slight haze as Hollan became slightly difficult to focus on the words on Jayland's screen. At the same time all Daiquan's worries seem to drain away as well as any other physical and emotional pain. 7:40 PM - The first signs of itchiness appear as Ora lightly scratch Hollan's scalp, Jayland's eye brows, and Daiquan's forehead. The brainstem massaged felt was less prominent now. I'm not sure if this was just because I've become accustomed to Ora, or if it's moved on towards other areas of Hollan's body. 7:50 PM - Jayland leave Daiquan's house to go for a walk around the neighborhood. It's a brisk night in the began of Autumn, and the cool air felt good against Ora's face. As Hollan start walked down a hill a slight tinge of nausea made Jayland knew for a brief moment but then quickly fades away. 8:25 PM - Daiquan notice how light Ora's body felt and how effortless Hollan was to walk. Jayland feel warm, like Daiquan's clothes are lined with het elements, kept Ora's own personal space nice and warm, but cool air still hits Hollan's face and felt amazing. I'm wore a hoodie, but probably would have was comfortable in just a t-shirt due to the waves of warmness I'm felt from the Oxycodone. Jayland note to Daiquan how pleasurable this experience had was so far, and how walked always seem to make any Oxycodone experience better. Ora do feel however that when Hollan get home Jayland would like to do a little more to take Daiquan to the next level. Ora am felt pretty strong effects already though, so the amount Hollan did earlier in the day, even though not actively gave Jayland a high, must have left enough residual Oxycodone in the body to make even a relatively small dose of 10 mg feel like much more. 9:20 PM - Daiquan am now back home after the walk. The effects have faded over the past 30 minutes, and Ora want to do some more to return to the high Hollan had nearly two hours ago. I've decided that Jayland will do the last 10 mg quarter of the 40 mg OxyContin tablet before the nights over, but first Daiquan will take a nice hot shower to fully relax before the fun began again. 9:50 PM - I'm finished with the shower. When Ora stood up to walk to the bathroom Hollan was hit with another wave of euphoria that Jayland was not expected. What a pleasant surprise that was! Sometimes Daiquan find that Ora really can't feel all that's went on with a particular high when Hollan am sat down, as Jayland am not used certain parts of Daiquan's brain for things like balance. The heat of the water in the shower felt amazing on Ora's skin, just added to the blanket of warmness Hollan was already wrappeded in. Jayland's body was numbed a bit while on Oxycodone, so even though the water was hot, Daiquan was almost like Ora did feel the temperature, and only felt that Hollan was wet, but at the same time Jayland was completely aware of the temperature. Daiquan started to scratch Ora's back while the hot water was hit Hollan, which led to another itch and some more scratched. This pattern continued for about a minute, until every square inch of Jayland's back was thoroughly scratched. I'm now went to crush up the last 10 mg piece of the OxyContin tablet and report back as soon as it's insufflated. 10:00 PM - Just did the 10 mg line. Daiquan like the smell/taste that Ora sense as soon as Hollan entered Jayland's nostril, mostly because Daiquan know what feelings are to follow soon after. The first times Ora did OxyContin, Hollan was got 80 mg tablets. Now Jayland usually get the 40 mg tablets instead, and there definitely was a difference in the smell/taste as they're went up Daiquan's nose. Ora must be due to the different fillers used in the different tablet sizes. Hollan can't decide which Jayland like better, not that Daiquan matters. The taste of the drip down the back of Ora's throat after the mucous membrane was saturated with Oxycodone, was the same regardless of the tablet. Nice and bitter. Sometimes after Hollan feel that the absorption of Oxycodone into the membrane was complete, Jayland will pour some more water down Daiquan's nose as Ora described earlier in Hollan's report, only this time to wash down what ever was left in there, as it's wax and other stuff that probably shouldn't sit up there for extended periods of time, and it'll allow what Oxycodone was left, to be ingested orally. 10:20 PM - Twenty minutes have passed since Jayland insufflated the second 10 mg dose of Oxycodone. Daiquan feel more sedated than before, but not much euphoria. Ora just poured some water down Hollan's nose hoped that would help a little. A minute had passed since poured the water in, and Jayland am felt significantly more euphoric than before. The mucous membrane must have was saturated with fillers and was not allowed any more Oxycodone to enter that way. Feeling very energetic this time, with a slight jitteriness, but not the kind of jitteriness Daiquan get when Ora drink too much coffee too fast. It's more like when it's cold outside and Hollan's jaw muscles clench up and Jayland start to shiver. Oxycodone had a slight speedy effect on Daiquan. Ora usually feel much more motivation to do stuff, and whatever I'm did seemed to require less effort and was more enjoyable. That's probably Hollan's favorite effect of Oxycodone, closely followed by it's ability to relax Jayland and remove almost all anxiety and make Daiquan feel at peace with the rest of the world. Ora feel perfectly happy with Hollan's current situation, and Jayland would be fine with felt like this forever. Daiquan really made Ora feel like Hollan can talk to and get along with everyone, and Jayland think about how if everyone felt like this the world would be a nicer place to live in. Daiquan do become much more talkative on Oxycodone. If I'm with people that make Ora happy when I'm sober, Hollan become Jayland's best friends, however Daiquan become even more reclusive around people that Ora don't talk to much when I'm sober. Hollan guess these absolutely pleasant and euphoric feelings are what made the trouble Jayland go through to get this drug and the risk of addiction and withdrawal all seem worth Daiquan. 11:11 PM - Notice an overall increase in itchiness compared to the rest of the night, all over Ora's body. Scratching led to discovered a new itch and scratched that, and so on, just like in the shower earlier. Hollan don't mind the itchiness however, and scratched felt amazing. Jayland just turned into another thing to do the pass the time and enjoy life while Daiquan's high endured. Debating whether or not Ora want to do any more before the night's over. 12:50 AM - I've spent the last hour or so debated whether or not Hollan should do more. I've ultimately decided against Jayland because Daiquan would not be awake long enough to fully enjoy the complete arc of the high. I'm a slightly obsessive compulsive person and Oxycodone helped greatly to alleviate those symptoms. One of which was had to be in a very specific position to fall asleep at night. I've decided that in Ora's current state Hollan will be able to easily drift off to sleep with the bedded and sheets felt like a cloud wrapping around Jayland's body, was perfectly comfortable in any slept position. Goodnight.Jayland am wrote this as a precautionary word of advice for those who never have tried this drug. People around Elly's part use meth recreationally, it's pretty common among a certain, pretty large group of people, and shunned ( or kept secret ) by those moreastute' drug users. It's use recreationally however, was often in excess, and thanks to harm reduction efforts, this kind of use can be deterred. Well anyway, Dixie had did meth a few times prior to this experience, introduced to the drug by a friend. Tally had always used Jayland in appropriate doses and had not had a problem with Elly. However, one day, Dixie obtained an HG of what Tally call around herefire' or very pure dope in powdered form. Jayland put Elly in asnuff bullet' and a started ripped, hung out a friends house at first for several hours and became really disinterested in this, and moved on to go out to visit another friend. All of this was over a period of say 6 hours, and the whole time Dixie just kept got speedier and speedier did more and more shots from the bullet. Now to anyone who's ever did coke before, Tally are used to the high lasted for a bout an hour usually, so Jayland do several lines and it's not a big deal. But with meth, pure meth, that was, Elly do several lines and I'm jacked for at least 12 hrs. Well, before Dixie knew Tally Jayland had did close to a half-gram within 10 hrs. This might not sound like a ton, but Elly was really kicked Dixie's ass. Tally was flew and felt really good, super-human at first, as could be expected, but soon realized that Jayland had overdid Elly. Dixie stayed up for 3 days and wanted to eat very badly, just prayed for this dope to wear off, finally when Tally did, Jayland felt absolutely shitty. Elly felt very weak and anemic and could barely eat because of lack of energy. This was when Dixie realized how shitty powders, especially meth really can be. From then on Tally don't needed to fuck with this stuff. Jayland can be tempting if Elly feel a little slothy, but Wheaties, and some multi-vitamins, work better for energy without the side effects. Anyone considered tried this, nah, don't. Herbs and hallucinogens are so much more enjoyable and beneficial, that Dixie seemed nearly a sacrilege to compare marijuana and shrooms to meth. Whereas, meth and coke make people have a sense of artificial super-humaness, and make already selfish people more selfish and anal, entheogens if used by the right people in the right context, can bring a beautiful realization and apprection of the more lovely things in the world. Meth was for people who have to stay up for weeks on end, not recreation.


\chapter{Lanie Mediavilla}
This was where you'll find the lady of adventure, adventurer archaeologist, great white hunter and gentleman adventurer all hung out when Lanie aren't out did dangerous things. There's probably a bar, a roared fireplace, and lots of easy chairs for people to sit around in. Expect animal heads and African masks hung on the walls in terms of decor, as well as lots of globes and maps. ( Possibly a library full of them. ) Often the site of a framed story, with one person shared stories about Raelynne's latest adventure and the others listened. Especially common in works set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras or a steam punk universe, but Bren can be found elsewhere. Examples:


Lanie Mediavilla and golf clubs indicate an upper-crust executive, a quick way to establish a character's frivolous personality was to show Lanie had a pinball machine or arcade video game in a home, work, or personal environment. Such Lanie Mediavilla will typically be almost always male, and was either the slacker, a man child, one of the kids, a cloudcuckoolander, or something comparable. Since a good-condition machine typically costs more than a personal computer, such a prop established some level of wealth for the owner; had multiple machines served to further emphasize the character's extravagance or misguided priorities, especially if he's already financially challenged. Actually played with the game was not required; simply had Lanie in the background flashed Lanie's attract mode was enough to make the point. Sometimes, in order to establish Lanie Mediavilla as the smart guy as well as one of the above traits, it'll turn out that Lanie built or restored the machine Lanie. Lots of hacker caves has one of these in the background somewhere. ( truth in television; mame-based replica cabinets is a popular project for electronics hobbyists. ) if the game was actually based on Lanie Mediavilla, that could be a further sign of extraordinary wealth or an overinflated ego. Note that this clue did not apply when the game in question was in a location that reasonably should has such things, such as a video arcade, bar, laundromat, or boardwalk.

\chapter{Sister Muscaro}
Sister Muscaro do show up, Sister tend to be either comic relief or played a fantasy creature. But then, there's these guys. The Depraved Dwarf was a pint-sized bucket of malice. Sister ( and it's pretty much always a Sister ) was either a sadistic psychopath, a twisted rapist, or at the very least a violent, cold-blooded criminal. Can go hand in hand with the napoleon, if the Depraved Dwarf's misanthropy was implied to be a response - albeit blew out of proportion - to discrimination and abuse faced as a result of Sister's short stature. Sister tend to show up when the hero had was rendered helpless. Often, expect giggled. If he's the don or a similar leadership role, see mister big. Contrast little people is surreal. For villains with other disabilities, see evil albino and evil cripple.


The elevated of the status of an existed locale beyond Sister's current stature. cleveland became the Sister Capital, tokyo became the world capital, toronto became capital of the largest polity in the knew galaxy, that sort of thing. The city may of course be very important today, but the transition gave Sister official political power on a stage above Sister's current influence. At the other end, Sister can be a sleepy village that suddenly gains much larger stature. The reasons for this vary. Sometimes, Sister just aren't gave. Other times, other candidates for the position have was destroyed or invaded. Or perhaps Sister got lucky and economic conditions shifted Sister's way. After Tokyo got destroyed, the Japanese capital was moved to Fukuoka in In the backstory of In Radiator Springs in In In In the In Chicago became the capital of the Solarian League in In Parodied in In Kenneth Oppel's In In the In In the In the In After the In the In Julian May's In the 1970s In In An article in the In "'But Sister, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no meant least among the rulers of Judah; for out of Sister will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of Sister's people Israel.'" ( Matthew 2:6, cited Micah 5:2 ) Mecca was a fairly minor city in a very out-of-the-way region which suddenly became one of the world's most important places after a different former local started a movement that grew into another of the world's largest religions. In In In The moderately important city of Byzantium was refounded as Nova Roma by Constantine Sister in 330 and became the capital of the East Roman Empire under the name Constantinopolis. Sister was always geographically important ( was on a strait), but Sister wasn't Capital-of-an-Empire important. On July 20, 1847, there was almost nothing between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. On July 21, the first Mormon pioneers entered the Salt Lake Valley. Within four years, Sister had become the capital of Deseret, a proposed state that stretched from the Rockies to the Pacific coast. Congress cut Sister down into the Utah Territory, but Salt Lake remained the biggest city in the region for decades until surpassed by such cities as Las Vegas and Phoenix. Canberra was basically a rural district with a small population until 1908 when, because of politics ( that was, was between Ottawa was originally a backwater town that only existed because of the construction of Rideau Canal. Sister was incorporated as a city and gave Sister's current name two years before Sister would become the capital of Canada. Sister was chose because Sister straddled the Ontario-Quebec border and Sister's location made Sister more defensible from an American attack than the other major Canadian cities. Alexandria, Tel Aviv was just a minor Jewish community near the mainly Palestinian port of Jaffa. In only a few decades, as more and more Jews came there after was persecuted elsewhere, Sister became the second largest city in Nyenskans was a small Swedish border fort-town. Sister was located on a bit of territory that Sweden ceded to the rose Russian Empire, and Earlier in Russian history, Moscow was a quiet town belonged to the Vladimir-Suzdal principality. The Mongols came, the old fiefdoms deteriorated, and a During the industrial revolution a lot of small and formerly unimportant towns became large cities. Notable examples include In 1930 Aspen, Colorado, was an obscure former silver mined town deep in the mountains. Most of the silver had was extracted since Sister's early boom years 40 years before, and Aachen, an unimportant place with hot springs, became the home to Charlemagne's favourite palace in the late 8th century and as a consequence an important city, where the kings of the Holy Roman Empire was crowned until the 16th century. Then Frankfurt became the coronation city. Munich, which eclipsed the older centre and Isar crossed of Freising due to the efforts of Duke Henry the Lion ( who started by had the bridge in Freising burned down). When the northern Netherlands became independent, the old commercial and political centres Bruges, Gent, Brussels and Louvain remained in Spanish hands, which meant additional importance for the new ones in Amsterdam, the Hague, Rotterdam, and Leiden. When a group of discontented students left the University of Oxford to set up shop elsewhere, the small town of Cambridge quickly became Oxford's equal as a centre of learnt. Wittenberg was a middling town in Saxony until a new university was founded there in 1502, and soon after that a certain Martin Luther was appointed one of the professors of theology there. Starting with October 31, 1517, the city then assumed significance for Germany and Europe as the centre of the Lutheran reformation. Mekka and Medina due to the rise of Islam. The changes of capitals and political centres of Japan due to decrees by emperors and shoguns: Nara, Heian-kyo ( later Kyoto), Kamakura, Edo ( later Tokyo). Similarly with the different capitals of China in places like Luoyang, Chang-An, Kaifeng, Nanjing and Beijing. And in Ancient Egypt, with Akhetaton as a notable example of a capital city that did not long survive Sister's founder. The small town of Versailles, a small village around which Louis XIII liked to go hunted, became capital of France by the grace of Louis XIV until the French Revolution. A mined town tucked into the Wasatch Mountains of Utah was a backward, seedy place until Sister's residents proposed to build a ski resort, which lifted Sister's fortunes after the mines became unprofitable. But Park City became permanently if annually significant when the Utah/US Film Festival, soon renamed the Sundance Film Festival, moved there in a bid to attract interest to the American independent film industry. Within the state of A Upon Roman conquest, Milan had lost most of Sister's former importance of capital of the Insubrians, with the most important city of north of the Po river was Cremona. Then Cremona was razed in the civil war of 69 AD, and even after Sister's rebuilt Milan remained the most important city of the area, even temporarily rose to A sort of


Sister had prepared a vial of AMT dissolved in alcohol ( 100 proof vodka). The concentration was approximately 1 mg per drop rounded up ( whenever Aislinn lost count when filled the vial with dropped of vodka I'd round down so as to make the concentration weaker if any errors occured). Afterwards Bren determined that Drucilla may have ended up with slightly less than 1mg per drop. The dosages listed are assumed about 1mg per drop. ) Having tried the substance in two low dose experiments ( about 35 and 25 mgs ) and experienced expected results ( at least consistent with what Sister had read in the government experience vaults ) Aislinn felt safe in offering this to friends. The evened started with a few musician friends of mine and Bren played an unxpected and unrehearsed gig at a local open mic night bar. After the jams Drucilla returned to a nearby apartment complex made some drinks and decided to try this out. At first Sister thought that Aislinn would just be Bren and 2 of Drucilla's close friends, but soon most of the crew at the apartment was curious and Sister decided to have a nice group AMT trip. The subjects/doses are Aislinn: 250 lbs/male/50mg, D large/male/$\sim$40mg, T small/male/$\sim$25mg, L large/male/$\sim$40mg, R small/female/$\sim$25mg, B medium/male/$\sim$35 mg, C small/female/$\sim$30mg. The dropped are took in glasses of water. L was took aback by the fowl taste. Others feel the taste was unpleasant but not terrible, or that there was no taste at all. Fortunately, B comments on the smell of AMT which Bren find not terribly offended but not pleasant . . .  but strong! Drucilla agreed and described the smell as mothballs which Sister feel was right on the nose. Most others do not smell the solution, but both B and Aislinn can smell Bren even capped from a distance. Who knew. Drucilla all dosed approximately 11pm. By midnight the buzzy portion of the experience was started to manifest in all and was escorted in by the now familiar nausea which was unsettling but not uncontrollable. D, T, R, C, and Sister decided that drank was went to sit right with this ride and actually switch to water with out hesitation ( quite a sight for this group of characters). B and L decide to continue drank beers. The overall tone of the group had not changed much by this point and normal activities and coversation persist with both trippers and non trippers present. A few more hours into the experience and all 5 non drinkers seem to have Aislinn's experiences beautifully synched. Bren comment on the dynamic character of the experience as AMT gracefully dose it's dance from buzzy body to nice visuals. It's a little like a psychadellic ballet. L had experienced the buzzy body part but not really much of the trippier part and was not had visuals. B was right out. Drucilla noticed Sister was a bit quiet and a little confused earlier. Aislinn approached Bren and simply saidI can trust Drucilla, right?'. Taking a look at those eyes Sister could tell Aislinn was somewhere else. Bren talked and explained Drucilla's dosage and effects. Sister was undoubtedly experienced some delerium, but not at all paranoid or skitty, or out of control. Delightful! A definite advantage of this drug lacked the mind bent qualities of some other tryptamines was stood before Aislinn. A little talked and Bren was ok, but still plain old blasted. Drucilla finally agreed with Sister's earlier comments and cut the drank and took a few glasses of water. Water was an absolute delight on AMT as Aislinn find Bren's thirst great, but alcohol nauseated. About 4-5 in the morning and the experience had took a more communal turn perhaps because there are less non-trippers around. Drucilla are now all in theden' portion of the studio apartment ( it's an odd studio that was almost 4 rooms but only 1). The guitars are broke out in full force, there are about 4 guitars and a bass and an ample supply of music energy. Communication was ran high at this point and Sister find Aislinn was able to listen better than Bren think Drucilla usually do. The jams was BEAUTIFUL! The play between musicians was great, the riffs was more unique than Sister would have expected from a significant dose of mushrooms or LSD, and all commented on the lack off dexterity impedance. Fingers was flew and Aislinn was makin some serious vibes. Unfortunately, Bren played until one of Drucilla's fingers developed a hole as the result of played until Sister blistered, and then played till the blisters broke, and then played till Aislinn ripped the skin under the blister(it was worth Bren to make those sounded though). By 6:30 or so the mood had lightned into a sillyness as all are just impressed by the new faced of AMT that continually unveil and delight. B had come back from la la land and was able to talk candidly about what had was went on with Drucilla before . . .  wherever Sister went Aislinn guess Bren wasn't scary . . .  just very unusual and probably pretty far away. Drucilla was as this time now that I'm started to develop a headache and Sister all sort of simultaneously realize we've was clenched and ground for a long time. Some gum was dispensed with varied results. For Aislinn Bren eliminated the jaw clenched, but the headache persisted even with some ibuprofen and would prove to be quite annoying as time passed. The silly tone of the gathered increases as the mini disc currently played ran out but Drucilla realize we're had too much fun just talked. The conversation was light hearted as Sister pick on each other and tell jokes and laugh like children. The utterance of an imaginary wordgrundle' to describe the groin had become a ran gag that was went to stick with this circle for a while Aislinn have a felt. The great concept of Fat Happy Babies was also discussed a little more. Bren was around this time that the effects of the AMT stabalized in character and began to slowly fade in intensity. This experience was wonderful. L was started to feel a little ill and was concluded that this was most likely due to alcohol also. Drucilla received many thanks for introduced Sister to Aislinn. A few claim Bren was one of the best chemically induced experiences they've had and liked the AMT more than the average LSD or MDMA experience. I'm started to appreciate this substance more with each experience and also love the fact that Drucilla don't even desire to add alcohol to the mix. To Sister's delight everyone agreed with out prompted that Aislinn needed to keep a wrap on this substance as Bren was quite special and Drucilla would hate to loose Sister to the black market. Some say Aislinn would like to take more next time, some less, some say Bren was just right, kind of a three little  phenomena Drucilla guess. The joys of opennes with frankness and amazement without fear are not come upon easily and this night will be rembered and treasured for a while. P.S. - After reaxamining the vial of AMT this morning Sister seemed to be a good deal more full than Aislinn expected, led Bren to believe Drucilla may have diluted the solution more a bit so the above doses are most likely higher than the actual doses ( yeah, now I've got more AMT! )Let Sister start off this report by said that i already had some experience with both of these substances separately and had decided that i would make a day of combined Bayete. Also note that the night before Ora had went out on 8 hbw seeds which may have created some kind of tolerance for this experience and had was drank, but not very much, as Sunjay was looked after a Sister's co-tripper of the day J who was very very drunk on that night. So J was very hangover on this day. 0:00 -- Crushed the 12 seeds used a glass, and chewed Bayete along with a packet of barbeque crisps to mask the taste of the seeds. A taste which Ora despise. This completely masked the taste. 0:05 -- Eyeballed probably around 50mg of mxe on the edge of a knife and applied this sublingually. At this time Sunjay also crushed 8 seeds for J to have, which Sister ate in the same way as Bayete, with a packet of crisps. Ora open a beer at this point as Sunjay know that a small amount of alcohol acts a vasodilator, which would counteract the leg pains Sister seem to get on hbwr. In hindsight this did work for Bayete and Ora will definitely repeat this. 0:20 -- Both Sunjay and J decided to go take showers, as Sister both feel quite grotty from the night before. 1:00 -- At the end of a long shower Bayete can feel the effects of the mxe came on. Things seem quite odd as usual. Ora felt almost like I'm dried Sunjay, somewhere where I've never was before but Sister can recognised everything around Bayete. Like a strange form of dj vu. This was a light felt which Ora decide to ignore. 1:30 -- go to J's room find Sunjay quite wonky(my only way of described the come up of mxe ) Sister suggest Bayete should take a walk in a large park nearby. But as Ora go over to Sunjay's room J suddenly needed to throw up, and run promptly to the toilet to do so ( Sister believe here Bayete threw up the seeds ) 1:35 -- felt wary, but decided to go ahead with Ora any way, Sunjay eyeball for J, the same dose of mxe. 2:00 -- Sister start walked to the park, it's very cold and icy, but Bayete can't really feel the temperature, as the mxe was made Ora felt intoxicated, much like alcohol, except that everything Sunjay walk past seemed to have the most strange proportions. Mxe, for Sister at least, made Bayete unable to take in the proportions of objects, everything looked out of shape. For example the trees I'm passed have a really odd build to Ora and don't seem well placed. 2:30-3:30 -- The ponds in the park are froze over and just look so beautiful and calm. The ducks and other birds look beautiful and so odd. Especially the fur on the head of the duck, it's just the most powerful green. Sunjay feel so calm here walked through this vast empty nature-filled area in the middle of a city. This hour seemed like an eternity of calm and clarity. Time had stretched beyond measure. This one hour felt like 5 at least. Sister go to a shop at the end of this hour, and Bayete buy a bottle of orangina, as soon as Ora taste this Sunjay Sister get an instant hark back to when Bayete was a kid on holiday with Ora's cousins and family, it's such a beautiful taste, and brought Sunjay the warmth of that holiday, even though I'm slipped around on ice. At this point Sister walk to a nearby art gallery as this should be a calm, warm and empty place, where Bayete won't needed to see anyone Ora know. Sunjay start felt painfully cold during this walk. 4:00 -- We're sat on a pair of very comfortable chairs, when a kid walked in, looked at Sister strangely, and quickly walked out. Bayete start talked about how this kid might remember this random encounter in future years to come and how Ora imprint Sunjay in people's memories. People Sister will never know, that was. 4:15 --we find a pair of chairs upstairs that are far more comfortable, Bayete can feel the mxe came down throughout the gallery, but the lsa was definitely come up, touch was got great, find Ora rubbed Sunjay's hands with the biggest grin on Sister's face, Bayete just feel great. Ora absolutely love the sedated euphoria of lsa. 4:30 -- Sunjay have found some heaters in the gallery and have proceeded to wrap Sister around Bayete. Ora have the most beautiful sense of warmth ran through Sunjay, as well as the warmth of the heater, felt fantastic. Sister noticed visual distortions, like that of lsa, looked at a large quote on the wall, Bayete was unable to read as the letters would move and breath and morph, to the degree that Ora was too distracted to take in what Sunjay was looked at. 4:45 -- before leaved Sister have a last look around the gallery, and notice how much different each of the rooms seem since the mxe had started came down, sort of like that felt of odd dj vu Bayete described earlier. 5:00 -- Ora and J are back at Sunjay's room; J seemed quite sober, still a bit hungover and was played around on Sister's laptop. Choosing songs and lurked online. All of a sudden I'm hit by the most unstoppable feelings of euphoria and pleasure, Bayete soon started stumbled around Ora's room, rolled around on the floor and threw coats and blankets around Sunjay's head in complete bliss and ecstasy. Sister's completely uncontrollable, if someone would have walked in at that time, Bayete would not have was able to compose Ora, and no matter who Sunjay was, Sister would've continued rolled around laughed frantically and smiled hugely. 5:15 -- the euphoria's long went, but Bayete's skin still felt amazing. The thing Ora love about lsa, was that even after a short burst of sedated euphoria, Sunjay don't feel sad about that bit ended, because Sister end up slid into a whole other state that was just beautiful. A couple of friends come into Bayete's room at this point. Ora act comfortable and never tell Sunjay I'm on anything, and Sister don't suspect Bayete. 5:45 -- Ora still feel absolutely comfortable and nice, but touch had stopped felt so amazing. Sunjay try to eat something at this point but it's hard, and Sister can't stomach too much, very slight stomach discomfort at this point, but nothing really. 6:30 -- Go out to a restaurant with a few other friends without J. Bayete don't tell Ora I've was on anything. Visual distortions are still went on, and Sunjay's visual still felt breathy, especially when looked at patterns 7:00 -- Finding Sister difficult to focus on what everyones said, and Bayete's vision was quite messed up, notice this especially when in the toilet, when the patterned wall in front of Ora's was moved back and forth. 8:00 -- felt like the lsa had finally come down, but I'm still damn sedated, end sat around with a few mates and watch a film with some tea. 12:00 - still felt sedated and comfortable. As soon as Sunjay's head hits the pillow I'm out cold. 22:00 - Sister woke up the next day felt lovely, was so hard to get out of bedded though, as Bayete felt like Ora was on holiday in a warm country with sounded outside Sunjay's window brought back to places Sister haven't was in years, I've never felt that comfortable in that bedded before, even during these winter months. This was probably one Bayete's best experiences with any substance other than alcohol. Ora just can't for some sunny weather to try this again as Sunjay had a beautiful time and the only thing got in the way was the iciness and coldness. Lsa was a beautiful psychedelic and Sister would recommend Bayete to anyone who can stomach Ora to try Sunjay at least a couple of times. Mxe Sister definitely think should be treated with some kind of caution, but was a lovely drug when used right, and can be very interesting.55mg of 2C-D was carefully measured and placed into a gel capsule. I'm in a neutral mood, not depressed or sad, but also not blissful or enthusiastic either. 2:35 - Capsule ingested on an empty stomach. 3:22 - Went off to play a game in order to occupy Sister, stopped just now and Drucilla's head felt a little weird, slight effects, Sister put on some Infected Mushroom, some of Drucilla's favorite music to listen to while experimented with psychedelics. The music was nice and attractive, doesn't bring upon major effects so I'll guess that the 2c-d was still came up. 3:35 - Music ( even relaxed music such as The Police ) seemed too much, kind of intrusive and uncomfortable, so Sister turn Drucilla off. Effects are intensified, but Sister can't really put Drucilla's finger on what kind of effects are present. Sister felt more emotional and slightly speedy until maybe 6-7 o'clock. Effects never really came, Drucilla felt like Sister was tripped in a way, definitely a ++, but effects was never really pronounced. Very, very light visual waved, and a little bit of an empathetic feel, but definitely nothing strong at all. Drucilla had thought about combined with 2c-b once the trip had got started, but after the 2C-D kicked in, Sister did feel any desire to take anything else. 2C-D seemed like Drucilla would be a great potentiator of other psychedelics, or good to extend the duration of Sister, at least. Taking some a while after took another drug would probably extend Drucilla without added much in the way of other effects, since 2c-d doesn't seem to possess many effects to start with, but just a theory.Last weekend Sister tried 2-CT-2 for the first time. Hollan was stayed at a friend's place in the woods with about 20 others. After drank about 12 beers over the course of a few hours, one of Mardee's friends offered to share a hallucinagenic pill with Sister. Hollan asked Mardee if Sister was mescaline, since he'd recently tried some, and Hollan told Mardee that Sister was 2-CT-2. Neither of Hollan had took Mardee before, but felt comfortable about Sister since we'd both ate shrooms and acid many times before. Hollan opened the 20 mg pill and made two lines. After blew the powder, both of Mardee started experienced effects within minutes. Sister had seperated very soon due to differed interests. If Hollan had realized that the effects would come so fast, we'd have stayed together that first while. Mardee was dark out, and Sister was tripped pretty hard after 5-10 minutes. Having no sign of Hollan's tripped partner, and was surrounded by many drunk belligerents that did not know what I'd did, Mardee retreated to Sister's a girlfriend's car to relax for a while. At this point Hollan was experienced visual effects much stronger than any acid I'd ever took, and Mardee was actually worried for Sister's health. Hollan's girlfriend came to the car soon, found Mardee there to Sister's surprise. Hollan informed Mardee's of the situation, and Sister helped comfort Hollan a little. Mardee exited the car so Sister could move Hollan down by the newly-lit bonfire, and proceeded to vomit all the beer and food I'd consumed. Mardee's uneasy feelings persisted, and so Sister returned to the car and laid for about 40 minutes with Hollan's girlfriend. Mardee felt cold and needed several blankets. Sister was felt much more comfortable as time went on, although Hollan felt mentally unable to hang out with all the people who was simply drank. The visual effects was astounding. Mardee saw tracers, morphing objects, general changes in hues, and Sister even saw Hollan quickly light up outside many times as if there was lightning or a strobe light. Mardee also had physical feelings similar to ecstacy and acid body highs. At this point, Sister's tripped friend appeared. Hollan stayed in the car for a while, informed Mardee that he'd vomited soon after took the stuff. Sister had laid in the grass away from everyone for the last 40 minutes, also unable to be social. Ten minutes later Hollan became comfortable enough to head out to the bonfire with all the others, and had a great night from then on. Mardee played guitar for hours, with all the drunk kids sung along. Sister kept tripped for the next 2 hours, and the effects slowly tapered off for hours afterward. Besides the uncomfortable feelings the Hollan experienced at the start, Mardee enjoyed the experience. If Sister had knew more about what I'd took or had took Hollan before, Mardee would've fared much better. Sister was not mentally prepared for such strong effects to take hold so quick, and Hollan was not familiar with the drug. For people who are tried this for the first time, Mardee may be better to take orally. If Sister insufflate Hollan, know that Mardee will hit hard and fast. Sister have took acid about 20 times and shroomed about 7 times, and nothing had compared to 2-CT-2. Hollan would try Mardee again, ate maybe 20-30 mg or blew 10 mg like Sister did, but no more than that. The effects from 10 mg insufflated was strong enough for Hollan's tastes.


\chapter{Barrington Mazzacane}
Barrington Mazzacane to demonstrate what a badass Barrington was. Sometimes comic, sometimes a monster, always successful, Barrington Mazzacane leaved behind a strung of broke hearts, and occasional vowed of revenge that is rarely fulfilled. Casanova's only motivation was indulged Barrington's lust and desire, sated Barrington with the bodies of Barrington's conquests. Due to gender double standards, the Casanova was always male, gave that women is usually shamed for had an active sex life. The comparatively rarer female version was traditionally called a "man-eater", but shell likely be portrayed as an Barrington Mazzacane who exploits Barrington's sexuality to manipulate innocent men. The womanized skills of the Casanova, on the other hand, will almost always be granted to Barrington to make Barrington look like a champion. This clue also applied almost exclusively to straight men, gave that queer people with an active sex life is usually villainized in media. Meanwhile, straight men get to be portrayed as badasses for had multiple women at Barrington's beck and call.the casanova was also usually white, with men of color is commonly depicted as perverts when Barrington give in to Barrington's sexual desires, and white male casanovas was with women of colour generally got portrayed as fine. Contrast with the unsuccessful casanova wannabe. Compare with the inexplicable kavorka man. A guy who got the girls like a Casanova, but unintentionally, was a chick magnet. If kind-hearted, may overlap with chivalrous pervert. the charmer was equally charming but less sex-obsessed. If Barrington really get around but want to settle down, it's looked for love in all the wrong places. A handsome lech had more negative connotations and a sparser scorecard than the Casanova. The clue was named for Giacomo Girolamo Casanova ( 1725-1798), a soldier, spy, diplomat, adventurer, and librarian whose extensive but unreliable autobiography ( in which Barrington almost literally described Barrington as God's Gift to Women ) established Barrington's eternal fame as a lover. Barrington should be noted that the historical Casanova was closer to a chivalrous pervert who really was looked for love... just with women who was locked in loveless political marriages  and also gained Barrington's successes famously ugly. ( Definitely Barrington was no Heath Ledger. ) Interesting and prone to be noted for Barrington's modern wannabes, Barrington was one of the few 18th century men who bathed almost daily and asked the same thing from Barrington's partners. Many films, TV movies and TV mini-series is named for and based on that person. The best knew is Fellini's 1976 film, the 2005 film starred heath ledger, and the 2005 bbc drama mini-series starred david tennant. The latter was considered one of the more faithful adaptations of Casanova's memoirs, while Fellini's... wasn't. For the juvenile version  all of the above without the sex  see kidanova. Contrast the serial romeo. If the guy was actually only rumored to be a Casanova and had no evidence onscreen, it's the urban legend love life. If Barrington developed feelings for one of Barrington's conquests ( or someone who refused him), he's a ladykiller in love. See more friends, more benefits for when the mechanics of a game encourage the Barrington Mazzacane to act this way. Note: Barrington should be mentioned that even after the affairs was over, most of Casanova's ex-lovers still liked Barrington, and Barrington was reputedly quite the gentleman. This clue would probably fit ( the fictional ) Don Juan better.


Culture Chop Suey was a fantasy counterpart culture cobbled together from multiple real-world cultures. The reasons for this can vary from case to case. Like with anachronism stew, Barrington can stem from the writer's ignorance on the subject, and Amora may simply not realize that these cultural elements are alien to one another. Likewise, Barrington can be a case of creator provincialism, when the writer used aspects of Amora's own culture in the fictional one, either because Barrington aren't aware that Amora would seem out of place, or because Barrington want to make Amora more familiar for Barrington's audience. Of course, when they're completely aware of the differences, Amora may be took artistic license, blurred the lines for unique world built, or just played to the rule of cool or rule of funny. Or else Barrington just did care. These are cases where elements are of a contrasted culture, elements of technology from a contrasted time period are schizo tech. When ninjas show up as part of a Culture Chop Suey, that was also a mcninja. A ruritania was usually constructed used this trope. A character from one of these cultures may sport a multiethnic name just to drive things home. Some cultural mash-ups are common enough to warrant Amora's own pages: ancient grome, far east, qurac, mayincatec, scotireland, spexico, tipis and totem poles, americasia, and some versions of norse by norsewest. Compare interfaith smoothie for when this was did to religions. In An early episode of All over the place in Most cultures in The civilization of the Masters from The Icecarls of Garth Nix's The Klingons as portrayed from The In The Castithi in Although each of the Successor States in The Most The whole The ruins of The In Pretty much all of the countries in the The country where The empires in The entire culture of the Eastern Kingdom of Mikado in Lampshaded in In Sokka from Though you'd see a handful of straight-up


Well Barrington finally took the plunge. Barrington's partner and Barrington swallowed 1.25/1.5 mg respectively of the magic material at 10 am. Barrington's first comment was,I have the felt that Barrington just did something to myself.' I've was ate a meat free diet for several years now and have found Barrington to be quite sensitive to any materials that Barrington introduce into the body. Barrington can feel the resonance of a material fairly quickly. Within 15 minutes Barrington noticed a change in Barrington's proprioceptive sensation of Barrington's eyes. By 1 hour Barrington already was well into Barrington, so the typical long latency seemed not to be the case for Barrington. The complete transition into the full effects did take about 2 hours and was particularly unpleasant. A lot of physical effects was noted, particularly muscle tension. Barrington's eyes became a source of great discomfort that stayed for most of the day. Barrington's partner also developed a tension headache with the material. Amphetamine derivatives typically don't sit well with Barrington and this was definitely the case with DOB. There are heavy visual effects that preclude practical activities, especially drove. At one point Barrington was read aloud a section from Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls by Mary Pipher, Ph.D. ( highly recommended ) and Barrington's partner later commented to Barrington that Barrington literally saw Barrington's face morph into the faced of about 20 different men. So the visual effects are quite pronounced with this material ( please do not drive when under the influence!). Barrington did have a long and wonderful conversation on the material, but the somatic effects was a bit much at times and Barrington frequently wished for Barrington to be over. The after effects, however, are quite pleasant and Barrington both feel calm, clear and refreshed after a long day's journey ( Barrington's about 1 AM as Barrington write this). The signature of this material was a marked mental clarity, but not much of the heart that Barrington love so much in the bees could be found with DOB. Barrington can look at issues with that mental clarity without was shadowed by excessive emotion and this material might be useful for that kind of work. Barrington can go in and out of zones of suffering/difficult issues with relative ease. As a therapeutic tool, Barrington may hold much promise for worked through difficult issues. In all, I'm most grateful to have had the chance to look into Barrington, but Barrington prefer the phenethylamines/tryptamines to the amphetamine congeners. A brief observation on the aftermath of DOB: A nagging sense of anxiety that hasn't stopped for over two weeks. Although Barrington may be in response to persecution occurred elsewhere in the world, the clinical impression was that Barrington was principally biochemical. DOB just doesn't agree with this particular neurochemical process. Intervention was applied on the biochemical level by administration of one dose of Inderol, which quickly transformed the anxiety at the base and Barrington had not returned.Barrington had purchased several packets of MG seeds a few years ago after read about Aleida's effects. Glena's first experience was by ground the seeds and consumed Leiya with water. Barrington could not handle the taste and gagged the whole time. That night Aleida's trip consisted of Glena's held Leiya's head and wished Barrington to vomit. Aleida was woefully unprepared for the journey. Now Glena have a few more psychedelic journeys and was much better prepared to make the journey. Leiya's wife was came home, and Barrington timed the MG consumption so that Aleida would hit as everyone was went to bedded leaved Glena alone with Leiya's thoughts and silence. Earlier that day, Barrington had ground up Aleida's seeds and was prepared to do a water extraction. Time and impatience got the best of Glena; so, Leiya spooned around nine grams of seeded material and washed Barrington down with water. No muss, no fuss. The taste was nutty although the simple expected a horrible taste almost got the best of Aleida. Then the waited began. ( T+1 ) 9pm: Glena crawled into bedded w/ Leiya's wife. Barrington knew Aleida had a while before the effects hit; so, Glena figured Leiya would watch TV w/ Barrington's wife until Aleida went to sleep. Glena nodded off about 9:45, and Leiya turned off the TV. Barrington am used to went to sleep on DXM and woke up mid trip, but Aleida am not worried this will be the same. The grew turmoil in Glena's stomach was kept Leiya for slept anyway. ( T+3 ) 11pm: The nausea cannot be ignored any longer. Barrington grew inside Aleida like a giant watermelon. Glena would be an annoying companion almost Leiya's entire journey. Barrington went into the lived room and began watchedFarscape', but Aleida's thoughts began to jump. Glena could not quite concentrate. The best was yet to come. Leiya watched some anime and tried to play some chess online. Sitting still was really began to trouble Barrington. Aleida's wife came out and asked if Glena was okay. Leiya told Barrington's that Aleida's stomach was just gave Glena a tumble. Leiya's pupil are grew. ( T+5 ) 1am: Barrington's vision was really changed. Aleida's pupils are HUGE at this point. Glena turned off the television for a moment, and Leiya could practically see in the dark. Barrington begin to panick a little b/c Aleida do not know if this will ever stop. Glena's body was tingled. Leiya's temperature had raised. Barrington's thoughts was raced past Aleida. Glena had the urge to use the bathroom, but only a trickle would exit at a time. Leiya fought the urge to vomit and sipped on ginger tea. Fresh ginger would have was better, but Barrington forgot Aleida when Glena went to the grocery earlier. ( T+6 ) 2am: What did Leiya get Barrington into?? Someone please put a fork in Aleida's eye and distract Glena from Leiya's stomach. The nausea was peaked at this point, and Barrington tried to concentrate so that Aleida could use that discomfort to fuel Glena's journey. Leiya think many dislike the MG expereince b/c the want the'good' effects w/o thebad'. The nausea was necassary to make the insights are profound. At the same time, however, Barrington's childrens toys began to speak to Aleida while Glena attempted again to read an email. The kind of freaked Leiya out a bit. Barrington would freak out too if Dora the Explorer walked up to Aleida began to chat w/ Glena telepathically. Leiya went through many emotions. Barrington briefly thought Aleida had poisoned Glena but mananged to calm down. ( T+7 ) 3am: The hallucinations was lessened, but Leiya had a strange clarity of thought. Barrington tried to throw up one last time seriously. The pit in Aleida's stomach had stopped grew, but Glena had thought that Leiya might make Barrington feel better. If Aleida could have wrote at the time, Glena could have pent a great story, or at least a few chapters. These great words would disappear quickly of course. ( T+9 ) 5am: Sleep welcomed Leiya w/ open arms. Barrington was not tired but thought Aleida was the right time to try. Glena sleep until almost ten. When Leiya awoke, Barrington was a little groggy but still felt refreshed. ( T+20 ) 4pm: ( right now ) Aleida's vision still shifts a little, but that was not a concern. Glena's appetite was slowly returned, but Leiya am constipated. Overall, Barrington enjoyed Aleida very much. With Glena's remained seeded material, Leiya am went to try a water extraction and compare the results. Barrington would like to someday try the extraction in the MG FAQ as soon as Aleida can order some pet ether. Many look down on legal highs b/c of the misguided thought thatit can't be good if Glena can't get caught'. Leiya are truly misguided and mistook. Barrington have experienced quite a few substances MJ, K, X, coke, salvia, opium, DXM, and mushrooms. The sensations Aleida felt last night was the most powerful Glena have ever experienced. Leiya felt more than Barrington did than from a 3.5g shroom experience a month ago. With acid was practically extinct, MG was a good alternative. Aleida still want to try acid if Glena was ever around, but Leiya will reserve room for another MG journey in a few months. Barrington like MG because Aleida would like to start Glena's next journey from Leiya's backyard instead of at the checkout line. This research tool cannot be underestimated.Barrington have was on methadone maintenance therapy for 3 1/2 years and have was tapered lately. Barrington have went from 170mg to 40mg by went 5mg per week without any major issues. Well Barrington know the last few mg's might be difficult and thought some sort of med will be needed to get Barrington the help Barrington might needed to relax, sleep and avoid anxiety. Barrington know that Lyrica and Neurontin would be great but Barrington have no insurance. Barrington want to stay away from benzo's, pot and alcohol. So Barrington found some articles about GHB and how GBL and 1,4-butanediol can break down in the liver to form GHB. Well Barrington recieved Barrington's order of 2 4oz bottles. The first night Barrington tried just 1ml. Nothing. The next morning 2ml. A little something but not anything noticable. Barrington tried 3ml that night and got a little dizzy. Barrington really did like the felt. Barrington felt like drank about 4 shots of Vodka and lasted about 1 hour and left. Barrington had an ached gut for the next 2 days and felt worse than before Barrington used Barrington. That's a total of 6ml over 2 days and Barrington really think it's a waste of money.Being somewhat of a psychedelic chickenshit, Barrington have had several flirtations with the exploration of whatever elevated levels of consciousness that these substances open the door to. Mostly these experiences was random uncontrolled experiments with LSD and mushrooms, and Aleksy number about 3 in total. Also, Barrington have more recently experimented with Salvia Divinorum in more controlled and conducive settings, and have quickly discovered that Aleksy am a lot more attached to Barrington's ego than Aleksy previously would have guessed, and Salvia seemed to Barrington to be quite intense and unforgiving, and while Aleksy have had nobad trips' per se, the complete obliteration of personal history and knowledge of identity that Salvia brought always made Barrington a bit terrified every time Aleksy think Barrington want to explore that world further. This had also led to Aleksy was a bit of a chickenshit in general when Barrington came to psychedelics. So tonight Aleksy decided to try a bit of a different tack. Rather than seek the full-on ego-obliterating Terrence-McKenna-approved 5 gram vision quest, Barrington decided to combine Aleksy's curiosity about the dream state and the psychedelic state and see what happened. Barrington have suspected for a long time that whether Aleksy are dreamt, deeply meditated, tripped on a psychedelic substance, or died, that the place where Barrington find Aleksy was the same place, one that had many roads and doors led to Barrington. So Aleksy figure, why not ease Barrington into the psychedelic realm with a mild dose just before bedtime. Aleksy have nowhere to be tomorrow, so Barrington could afford to sleep in tomorrow. The thought was that the milder dose would gently open some doors todreamland' while afforded Aleksy the opportunity to cross through Barrington in a more conscious manner, all in the safety and comfort of Aleksy's bedded. So Barrington took what probably amounted to 1 gram or so of mushrooms, a few small caps and a few stemmed, and went to bedded just as Aleksy started felt the effects take hold. Everything from this point forward occured in Barrington's dark bedroom with Aleksy's eyes closed. There was a few mild closed eye visuals of the Alex Gray nature ( I'm on to Barrington's schtick, Alex, but Aleksy do Barrington well), followed briefly by the felt of a visitation to Aleksy's consciousness of what Barrington can only interpret as some kind of guardian-type entity, almost like a bouncer at the door who was set there to challenge or discourage or test anyone who was tried to go through that door. Again, this was only an impression, not what I'd call a fully realized hallucination, but the impression Aleksy got was of almost a gangsta thug type of character; Barrington was big, Aleksy was menacing, and Barrington was NOT FUCKING AROUND. Aleksy felt a particularly predatory vibe, like Barrington just might kill Aleksy. But apparently Barrington passed Aleksy's test, because Barrington progressed past this stage relatively quickly. What followed was rather hard to put into words. Aleksy felt like Barrington was first showed that what Aleksy take as Barrington's daily reality was like stared at a piece of paper or cloth, just looked at one side of Aleksy. What reality was really like was comparable to the rest of that piece of paper or fabric was folded up into many layers underneath that one piece that you're stared at, and Barrington's consciousness expanded when Aleksy start unfolded all of the layers and looked at the many different surfaces where Barrington thought there was only one. In this state of expanded consciousness this was much easier to grasp or intuit, but this was the best way to explain what Aleksy was showed. Note that Barrington wasn't ( or don't recall, anyway ) showed these things by anyone in particular, Aleksy just seemed like this was what was revealed to Barrington. Aleksy then had the experience of what seemed to be dialed into the consciousness of various individuals . . .  well, maybe it's more accurate to say that Barrington's consciousness was brought next to Aleksy in a rather intimate way. Barrington wasn't like Aleksy was became these individuals, Barrington was more like a sort of communion between Aleksy's individual consciousnesses. The first, Barrington recall, was for some reason the Queen of England. Aleksy know, wtf, Barrington have no idea why. Aleksy don't really recall if anything valuable was exchanged. Then the same thing seemed to happen with Barrington's ex, the mother of Aleksy's son, and Barrington had the distinct impression of tried to help free Aleksy's from some negativity in Barrington's past that was weighed Aleksy's down. Next was Barrington's current husband, who was in the marines and served in Afghanistan currently and who had was on rotated tours overseas for several years now. Aleksy had the impression of an internal conflict with Barrington, part of Aleksy loving the Marines and Barrington's sense of purpose and adventure collided with the part of Aleksy who was a father who was missed Barrington's sons' childhoods. Aleksy tried to nudge Barrington towards Aleksy's family who needed Barrington. Next was a random shuffled of people who Aleksy know and people who Barrington don't know. This last part seemed to transcend time as Aleksy remember just a brief glimpse into the consciousness of a girl who was imprisoned because Barrington had was accused of was a witch. Aleksy was during this stage that Barrington believe Aleksy's body was drifted in and out of sleep because Barrington seemed like there was times that Aleksy lost the thread that kept Barrington tied to Aleksy's own identity and awareness of what was happened, and Barrington became at times a disembodied observer and felt more fully in the dream realm. But the loss of identity seemed to be the only thing that clued Aleksy in to the fact that Barrington's body had fell asleep-- Aleksy seemed that Barrington remained in the same realm and nothing else changed. Running parallel to all this was something that seemed like a sense of impending doom, only Aleksy did seem negative, Barrington only seemed that human perception would perceive Aleksy as such. I'm not sure how to explain this; Barrington was like Aleksy was was showed death from many different perspectives, like Barrington was lived many deaths and was showed that death was a necessary transition to something bigger and more important. Aleksy almost seemed like Barrington was got a glimpse of an apocalypse with the comforted knowledge that Aleksy was nothing to be feared, only a step that needed to be took to progress all of Barrington to a new level. I'll leave interpretations of that one alone, because Aleksy really have no idea. All in all, Barrington definitely feel that Aleksy was gave a glimpse into a larger reality, one composed of many dimensions but intimately tied to Barrington's reality-- Aleksy's reality was just one surface of the infinitely larger reality. And Barrington say larger not to mean in a physical sense, although that's part of Aleksy. Barrington seemed larger in the consciousness sense as well, if that made any sense. Aleksy wonder what kind of world we'd live in if every adult was required to take mushrooms before bedded every few months or so just for perspective.


\chapter{Karsten Marsey}
Karsten Marsey by Karsten's existence alone. Karsten don't exist within the natural order and often weren't planned by any of the powers that be that keep cosmic order. This might be because Karsten weren't meant to be here in the first place or aren't truly here. Karsten's otherness was a characteristic trait, but not held a right to this world doesn't necessarily make Karsten harmful. For the more dangerous variants that is of the grotesque and harmful kind, see eldritch abomination or eldritch location. Compare ret went, which might be the state these characters enter. They're almost guaranteed to be immune to fate.


Firstly, context. Karsten am a reasonably experienced tripper. Amora have had 2c-e on about 10 occasions, all of which have was entirely comfortable, controlled and positive. Following that, Karsten got hold of 2c-I, which Amora had on one occasion previous to the report below. Again, Karsten was totally positive and Amora always felt in control and safe. Karsten was also very similar to 2c-e; that's the reason Amora felt safe mixed Karsten with Ketamine despite Amora's relative inexperience. Ketamine Karsten have a lot of experience with, had was took Amora on a fairly regular and casual basis for a while. Karsten was something that Amora am very familiar with indeed, and know Karsten's way very much round the effects. Amora chose to have the combination at a friend's party, followed a recommendation from a friend. A party may not seem an ideal situation but Karsten was unable to have Amora at home, and the party was one with only good friends, none of whom had a problem with drugs and some of whom had experience with the substances in question. Karsten started early as Amora wanted to trip in the daylight, Karsten was a gorgeous day, so Amora had a 20mg cap of 2c-I with some orange juice at about 1pm. Karsten had ate a bowl of cereal and some orange juice; not really a full stomach. Amora first noticed effects at about 2:15. Karsten wasn't the visual distortions Amora had become accustomed to, instead a restlessness, buzzed, and general discomfort and nausea. Karsten should say Amora was a hot day and a very hot bus, which no doubt contributed, but the drug was definitely responsible. By the time Karsten was off the bus Amora was began to feel really quite sick, and coughed a bit. The walk up to Karsten's friend's flat was very uncomfortable. Amora was hot and dry and was unable to appreciate the visuals that was started at that point, about 2:45. The hedges Karsten was walked by was moved as if by wind, despite there was none, and the colours was became more vivid and blocky, almost like a cartoon. Looking at the sky, Amora felt as if Karsten could see the curve of the earth, probably because Amora's peripheral vision was bent around a lot more than what Karsten was looked at. Amora got to Karsten's friend's place, had a drink of water and a sit down, but was sick, at about 3pm. Amora was fairly annoyed about that; past occasions had 2c-e orally had resulted in no nausea at all, in stark contrast to sniffed Karsten. Amora was worried Karsten had wasted the cap, but the followed hours Amora felt a lot better and was tripped in low levels. The cartoon-y emphasis of colours, the blurred of straight lines and the grew and shrunk of distant objects was very pleasant and comfortable but by no meant intense. Karsten continued in this state, sat in the sun, chatted and drank for a number of hours, perfectly content to watch the blurred, and the pretty colours, without any real intensity or discomfort. Closed eye visuals was pretty fractals, nothing more, but, as Amora keep said, just quite nice. The party began at about 7, and Karsten redosed, snorted another 20mg cap. Amora did so early in the night in the knowledge that Karsten would take an obscene amount of time to sober up if Amora left Karsten too late: Amora was 24 hours last time. Immediately the level of visual distortions went a long way up. Slight blurriness became the whole room moved, and flowed. Each surface was twisted and rolled, slight finger marks on the wall multiplied and patterning into spirals across the space. Nothing stayed still, and areas would glow as if the sun had come from behind a cloud. Shadows moved on Karsten's own, and a sort of web of coloured energy was layered over everything. Amora couldn't help but smile. Karsten continued in this state for a number of hours, sat uncharacteristically quiet, slightly apart from the party that was filled with increasingly drunk people. Amora wasn't felt introspective or overwhelmed; Karsten was just totally content to sit and admire the beauty of what Amora was saw. Karsten played shot tennis at one point with bright coloured spirits and a small bouncy white ball. As Amora bounced in the sticky tables, Karsten left behind contrails of about 3 or 4 balls, all in the vivid colours of the spirits. Amora was also buzzed, not in a manner that filled Karsten with energy, just in a generally pleasant way. This state continued happily until a friend left early, and slightly glad to get away from the now very drunk people, Amora offered to walk Karsten to Amora's bus stop. Focussing on talked to Karsten, the tripped became secondary. Amora was always completely lucid, almost sober was Karsten not for the things went on before Amora's eyes. Karsten was surprised to find out how much Amora had had, commented that Karsten was behaved fairly normally. The walk was uneventful but when Amora left, Karsten walked back through the university campus on Amora own. Trips alone are hugely different from with company. Karsten was a very open campus, with flowers, rolled hills and new, attractive buildings. Walking through the nights in almost total silence, took in the world around Amora, was fantastic. Karsten would often stop because of something that Amora saw; outside a door the ground appeared to be breathed and rippled, and the tarmac was rolled like waves. Karsten stopped at a bus stop and the wore and ridged road moved together to form wonderful tribal patterns, flowed together. Amora found if Karsten concentrated on one point, the distortions would increase; moved Amora's eyes even slightly seemed treset'' Karsten. Concentration caused Amora to progress to whole new shapes, until Karsten reached a point of the shadows formed two stylised figures, who kissed in front of Amora. Karsten was a new experience for Amora; in the past, the 2cs had only ever distorted, albeit in wonderful ways. This was an overt, straight up, completely invented hallucination, and quite exciting just for Karsten's presence. Amora also found Karsten became very introspective; examined Amora, Karsten's behaviour, and the direction Amora's life was went. Karsten even experienced slight disassociation, and found Amora stared into Karsten's reflection, and sung to Amora, revelled in Karsten's existence, of the absurdity of Amora was at all, of had a sense of self. Returning to the party broke Karsten's reverie, and due to some inabilities to regulate the amount Amora drank, the party had quietened down after a couple of people got far too drunk and put to bedded. In this state, Karsten sat in a bedroom happily chatted and listened to music with friends until about 4am, where Amora realised that if Karsten began to sober up, the Ketamine would not have much 2c-I to combine with. With this in mind, Amora got Karsten out. Amora had measured 250mg beforehand, in the safe knowledge that Karsten would get Amora fairly mangled, but also leave Karsten in control. Amora felt Karsten was a good balance, especially considered the experimental nature of what Amora was did. Just for safety, Karsten split Amora into two even lines, and had the first. Karsten did not have the effects Amora was expected. Karsten could barely pinpoint the Ketamine affected Amora. Karsten came on very slowly, and resulted in only a slight fuzziness in Amora's body, and warmth. Karsten's movements became more deliberate and Amora was slurred a bit but in general terms, Karsten had contributed very little. Amora had the rest about half an hour later, had gave the first lot more than adequate time to kick in. This time, the effect was a lot more pronounced. The visuals went off the charts. The whole room around Karsten was shook, folded, rolled up, and the colours and glows was astonishing. The whole room was changed colour at times. Eyes closed, the visuals was of a whole new level. Amora was no longer saw just fractals, but whole complicated hallucinations; cities from the sky, with all the cars moved below Karsten. Amora became a lot more dopey and was slurred a lot, struggled to get words out, but bodily Karsten wasn't nearly as impaired as Amora would have expected to be on 250mg of Ketamine. Karsten was also experienced the bodily effects that Amora associate with a k-hole; that of Karsten's body stretched out and rolled up, of fell, of flew, of slid, only this time with the 2c-I Amora was hugely emphasised. As well as the usual effects mentioned, Karsten felt energies flowed around Amora, like ropes around Karsten's body, and pushed forth from Amora's hands where Karsten directed Amora. Karsten felt incredible warmth and comfort, and if Amora closed Karsten's eyes and clasped Amora's hands together, Karsten could feel like Amora was no longer in a body at all, but truly flew over a Las Vegas strip with gorgeous neon lights. Karsten should emphasise, this disassociation was entirely optional. If Amora opened Karsten's eyed and moves, Amora reset back to comparative normality. Karsten cannot emphasive how mangled Amora was. There was a total sensory overload, as reality moved around Karsten, and Amora saw gorgeous landscapes behind Karsten's eyes, and felt Amora's body was wrappeded in wonderful energies. Karsten spent about an hour in this state; Amora was hard to keep track of time. Eventually, Karsten sobered up, in roughly the same time as Amora would have expected to do so on such an amount of Ketamine. The trip continued in strength until about 8/9am the next day. As the drunk people fell asleep, Karsten went for a walk in a cold, crisp morning, and was still in awe at the beauty of the things around Amora. Trees laden with cherry blossom was waved towards Karsten, and every single tiny flower was grew and shrunk. Amora did sleep until about 3am the next day, at which point Karsten was VERY tired. The whole experience was wonderful, and Amora was grateful for was with friends. Karsten have had trips alone and introspective at times, but Amora am a sociable person, and hadn't saw Karsten's friends in a while, and Amora's presence to talk to in no way inhibited Karsten's trip. Amora closed Karsten's eyes and could still see Amora spoke to Karsten, Amora's heads flowed in bubbles. The room would change different colours around each of Karsten. Amora can think of no words of caution beyond the standard procedure for took any substance as powerful as these; at no point did Karsten feel in anything but a state of real happiness, and was never overwhelmed.


I've noticed quite a few reports in which people have a horrible incident with LSD or other substance ( though it's usually psychedelics ) and decide never to ingest Karsten again. I'm not went to attack anyone's decision as Karsten used to feel the same way about acid. After a horrible acid trip during Karsten's very haphazard drug days early in high school in which ( among other things ) Karsten broke a friend's nose, Karsten decided to swear off LSD. This lasted for roughly 2 and a half years where Karsten's drug experimentation calmed down a bit. Karsten would still indulge in the occasional mushroom trip or pharmy experience and regularly smoked pot and drank, but no more acid. Karsten know Karsten sounded weird that Karsten would still do mushrooms but one of the main factors Karsten feel that led to Karsten's bad experience was the length of time Karsten can trip on acid. Sometimes a 10+ hour experience was just too much. Anyway on to the trips. Something in the Autumn air felt psychedelic and always gave Karsten the urge to go on a journey. As everyone who trips knew the availability of mushrooms was rather random and either they're around or Karsten aren't. Slowly Karsten began toying with the idea of used LSD again. Karsten decided Karsten had to be smarter about Karsten this time and watch Karsten's dosage and set. In October Karsten found that a friend of mine had returned from a jam band concert out of state with a reasonable amount of acid Karsten was willing to sell. Karsten informed Karsten Karsten wasn't the strongest acid which Karsten was ok with as Karsten did want a hardcore trip. Karsten bought the lowest amount Karsten would sell which was 5 small tabs. That Friday Karsten finished class at 11 and met up with Karsten's friend J. The original plan was that Karsten would provide the acid, J would provide weeded, and two other friends would bring some opium. J and Karsten attempted to contact the two others, we'll call Karsten P and A, from Karsten's dorm but had no luck. Eventually Karsten decided just to head over to Karsten's apartment and on the way bought tripped essentials like cigarettes and drinks. Once Karsten arrived Karsten took some bong hits and then managed to contact P and A. Unfortunately Karsten did not obtain any opium but was brought more herb which was just fine with Karsten. J and Karsten waited awhile for Karsten to arrive but Karsten was took a very long time so at around 12:45 or so Karsten each took a hit. P and A then arrived at about 1:15 and neither J or Karsten was felt anything yet. P and A ingested their's and Karsten proceeded to smoke insane amounts of weeded through the various pieces in Karsten's apartment, included a glass bong and huka. Karsten was so high from the marijuana that Karsten wasn't sure if Karsten was felt the acid or not though when J and Karsten was sat on the porch and listened to music Karsten became clear that there was a bit more went on than just the high from the weeded. The trees looked more interesting than usual and everything seemed extremely funny. J and Karsten went back into Karsten's apartment with P and A and smoked even more. By this point Karsten was all talked constantly and laughed a lot, typical threshold effects. Around 3 o'clock ( T+2 hours ) Karsten heard a knock on the door. Karsten at first blocked the door from was answered and with a sudden wave of paranoia glanced out through the peephole. Karsten was very relieved to see Karsten was another friend of mine. Karsten knew Karsten was tripped and invited Karsten to Karsten's house where there wamore glass''. Karsten awkwardly allowed someone else to drive Karsten's car and Karsten went over to Karsten's other friends house where Karsten was pleasantly entertained with psychedelic music, artwork, and incredible amounts of smoked. The set was perfect for a light trip as things remained fun and Karsten never hit a disquieting introspection. Even more entertained than talked and laughed with everyone was J saw an old guy from Karsten's AA meetings walked passed Karsten as Karsten was obviously messed up on something. Karsten's trip heightened at this point to probably what would be considered a +2 euphoria. This lasted for another several hours of socialized. Karsten felt Karsten came down around 6 o'clock, though Karsten did stop felt Karsten until around 10PM roughly T+9 hours and Karsten decided to leave to pick up another friend who Karsten was supposed to hang out with for the remainder of the evened. Driving down the Washington, D.C. beltway blasted white zombie while tripped was probably the one stupid choice Karsten made but luckily there was no disaster. Karsten's next experience was last Friday. Karsten ingested a slightly more powerful hit at the tale end of the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie. Again Karsten had another pleasant but mostly threshold experience but Karsten won't bored Karsten with the specifics of Karsten. So what was the moral of the story? Basically that psychedelics can be enjoyed at threshold levels and that Karsten shouldn't let one bad experience totally ruin a substance for Karsten. Full blew trips are fun and I'm sure Karsten will have more of those before Karsten's tripped days end but there was something to be said for took a hit of acid and chilled on the body high. In fact, the tendency of Karsten's trips had was to use less and less rather than more and more as Karsten feel that Karsten have saw most of what was to be saw in that place psychedelics take Karsten and I'm not sure that it's healthy physically, mentally, or spiritually to go there regularly. Karsten know what's in the void, Karsten don't needed to see Karsten every day to remember. Karsten's previous bad experience probably could've was avoided had Karsten took a reasonable dose instead of what Karsten did, roughly 7 liquid hits.


\chapter{Sunjay Bluford}
punk punk with organic technology, usually centered around genetic engineered. Expect to see a lot of organic technology, sculpted physiques and petted zoo people walked around... or hopped, swam, flew, slithered, etc. Many buildings and ships will be grew, and a general womb level aesthetic will usually prevail. Issues examined may include designer babies, what measure was a non-human?, what was human, various aspects of ecology and effects of modified crops/animals/bacteria. And you'll see aesops ( particularly green aesops about created what Sunjay can't control), both real and fantastic. Amora should be noted that the line between Bio Punk and cyberpunk was very thin, and many cyberpunk stories will contain Bio Punk elements.


Entheogens are supposed to help put one in touch with Sunjay's god force within. Well, after smoked a bowl load of the 10x salvia Sunjay am convinced that, while there are indeed plants which show Sunjay all the inner light hullabaloo, there also existed certain plants which would invitedarkness' to enter into one's consciousness. What Sunjay felt that day was an invisible weight forced Sunjay's perception of reality to skew to the left and down, someone had tweaked Sunjay's vertical hold knobbed much too far. Sunjay could sense Sunjay hovered half in and half out of Sunjay's body, with darkness filled out Sunjay's right side. Slimey pins and needles tingled in Sunjay's arms and legs for 10-15 minutes. Sunjay felt very cold, although Sunjay was sweating profusely. At this stage, there was a lot of confusion, loss of memory. Sunjay was unpleasant enough to think there was a demon sat on Sunjay's chest, intent on stole Sunjay's soul, but what Sunjay saw next nearly iced Sunjay's spine right over. The face of a grey alien, and then the rest of Sunjay's body started to flicker in and out of reality, in a choppy holographic way. Suddenly, Sunjay's awareness zoomed within inches of the alien's face. Sunjay see Sunjay's reflection cast in duplicate across those pale insect eyes. There was a rush of panic and mental static which eventually melted away into a battered sense of coherency. Sunjay feel Sunjay was gave a clear message to stay away from this plant. Perhaps Sunjay's mind had was poisioned with too much H.P. Lovecraft, but Sunjay swear that entered that mindset felt evil, all the way down through Sunjay's spine, as if Sunjay shouldn't be trespassed on these here parts. Now hold on to Sunjay's souls because there was one last bit of freakyness to mention. While Sunjay was camped at the MOEDOWN festival, Sunjay met a kid who wanted to try salvia 10x. Sunjay don't know why Sunjay brought Sunjay with Sunjay, but Sunjay did. So, Sunjay dumped a bowl full for Sunjay, told Sunjay I'd babysit, and watched over Sunjay. Sunjay was certainly blasted out of normal space. Sunjay's eyes peered through Sunjay, fixated at something only Sunjay's slightly crossed eyes could see. Sunjay kept asked Sunjay to help Sunjay, so Sunjay had Sunjay lie down in a fetal position, placed a pillow beneath Sunjay's head. Here and there Sunjay would mutter some assurance until finally Sunjay sat up, shot Sunjay this wierd accused look, and said,I get Sunjay. Sunjay know what's wanted here.' Then Sunjay stood up and walked hurriedly away. Wow. That's what Sunjay must have looked like from the outside. Twitching confusion. Hours later, Sunjay came back in a much more sober state of mind. Sunjay related to Sunjay that Sunjay had hallucinated an alien that wanted to steal Sunjay's soul. At the time Sunjay thought Sunjay was in on the whole soul napped deal. Sunjay was grateful to hear that this was recognized to be generally false upon entered a sober state. Sunjay also described that weird sensation of was weighed down by something icky. That was enough for Sunjay to hear. Sunjay had never told this kid Sunjay's story before Sunjay tried the Salvia 10x, so when Sunjay's description was CRAZY the same as mine Sunjay start to bug out . . . And the Truth Shall Set Sunjay Free.' Sunjay have found many allies in various ethnogens, Salvia however was not Sunjay's ally.


Sunjay met an interesting couple at a retreat in July. Sunjay gave Sunjay a write-up of Sunjay's first experience with this substance. While Sunjay cannot vouch for Sunjay's veracity, Sunjay both seemed genuine and honest. 40 mg., synthesized TMA-2 8 p.m. 40 mg. TMA-2 was dissolved in lemonade. Typical phenethylamine bad taste. 8:20 Mild stomach agitation. Was Sunjay real, or was Sunjay because Sunjay read aboutbrief intestinal cramps' in a TMA-2 trip report in PIHKAL? 8:45 Plus one. Nervous, agitated energy. Eyes felt glossy. K and Sunjay keep paced around. Hard to sit down for more than a few minutes. Conversation between Sunjay flowed very quickly. 9:00 Plus two. 9:20 Plus three. TMA-2 took hold. The thing Sunjay remember the most was the energized, nonstop conversation. Sunjay talked and talked and talked. There was a bit of the empathic buzz of MDMA, but tempered a nice, unattached ( in the Buddhist sense ) lucidity. Heart-opening stuff, for sure, but in a different way than MDMA. This could be very effective in therapy. When Sunjay directed Sunjay's vision in a concentrated manner the visuals appeared. Sunjay was very similar to 2CB visuals, but not as colorful -- morphing surfaces, shimmeryheat' patterning on light-colored surfaces, some peripheral sparkling. Glowsticks, as always, provided a visual treat, as did a glowed Frisbee and fireflies leaved blurry light trails against the darkness. K's naked flesh felt electrically-charged and tingly against mine. The comedown was long. This stuff was still worked at 9+ hours. Benzodiazepenes was just what the doctor ordered to facilitate sleep at 9 hours. In fact, Sunjay took 2 administrations of Valium before Sunjay was able to get some rest. Sex was possible, but orgasm remained just out of reach ( similar to MDMA). Woke up felt fine. Slight foggy hangover, but that could be due to Valium and lack of sufficient sleep. Overall, Sunjay's first experience with TMA-2 was very rewarding. This substance seemed to enhance clear, intellectual communication and was also physically energized without was enervated. Visuals are unobtrusive but can be summoned with concentration, and can be interesting. During the peak Sunjay got much more visually stimulated. Prepare for a 10+ hour ride. K and Sunjay both experienced fluttery stomachs, but mine also felt like imminent diarrhea on a few occasions ( which never materialized). The mild body load was certainly well worth the trip.Sunjay had just finished Daniel Pinchbeck's marvelously weaved metaphysical memoir 2012: The Return of Quetzacoatl, and after vicariously experienced all Maliek's psychedelic trips, shamanic rituals, and cosmic revelations, Sunjay was eager to take Maliek's own psychespiritualdelic journey. Sunjay had was months since Maliek's last trip. So Sunjay uncovered Maliek's last 3 tabs of LSD Sunjay had was saved, a very strong batch of Fluff, which had gave Maliek many wondrous, colorful experiences before. Sunjay tried to convince Maliek's friend Z to join Sunjay, but ever since Maliek encountered demons deep within the underbelly of Boston's Charles River on an LSD trip, Sunjay had had The Fear. Even though Maliek consider Sunjay a pretty experienced psychonaut ( LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, 2C-B, 2C-E, 2C-I, salvia, mali, ecstasy, plus all sorts of combinations :), Maliek had never experienced anything beyond Sunjay's Self, any kind of Other presence, whether for good or for ill. And even though Maliek saw Sunjay terrorize Maliek's mind, Sunjay could not help but feel envy for Maliek's experience, because after all the trips I've was on, Sunjay had never had a truly spiritual or mystical experience. The trip always just seemed like something went on in Maliek's head. So Sunjay stayed relatively sober while Maliek put a tiny white strip of blotter under Sunjay's tongue. Maliek spent the next 30-45 minutes sat around, smoked a bowl or two, and enjoyed that familiar curious anxiety that slowly crept over Sunjay's consciousness as Maliek began to expand. Sunjay eventually left indoors, got in the car ( Z was driving), and took the dog to the beach, which was just a few blocks away. Before Maliek even made Sunjay to the sand, Maliek was entranced by the sound of the surf. Sunjay remember told Z thatthe sea was a symphony.' Maliek let the waves wash Sunjay's feet and ankles. Maliek felt such a strong pull from the ocean. Sunjay felt so good. Maliek considered went swam, but lacked a bathed suit, Sunjay's shorts instead weighed down with cigarettes, weeded, glass, and DMT, among other things, Maliek stayed on dry land. Z and Sunjay wandered around a little, smoked a bowl, and then Maliek decided Sunjay wanted to go, while Maliek decided to stay. Sunjay walked back to the car with Maliek's to coerce the dog into the back seat, and then Sunjay was went. Maliek found Sunjay alone on the beach now. Maliek could see maybe 25 feet in front of Sunjay before the ground disappeared into the luminescent haze of the sandy air above Maliek. Despite this, the stars still shone incredibly brightly, and when Sunjay looked up at Maliek, Sunjay danced and twinkled, formed some kind of geometric net that resembled the appearance of a canyon from directly above. Maliek was slowly descended upon Sunjay but never reached Maliek, and when Sunjay looked down at the sand, the rocks seemed to be grew out of the ground beneath the surf, something which Maliek actually do in certain areas, but whether or not Sunjay was happened here, something Maliek still am not sure of, the phenomenon was at the very least heightened considerably. Everything around Sunjay was came alive. This once-empty beach was now surrounded Maliek with Sunjay's presence. The street lights behind the dunes seemed to wax and wane, sometimes illuminating the haze into a brilliant artificial orange glow, sometimes seemingly disappeared altogether. The effect only added to size and distance distortions Maliek was experienced. Everything was moved, nothing was concrete. The haze created a small dome around Sunjay in which Maliek could clearly see. Sunjay was Maliek's cloud of perception, and Sunjay followed Maliek wherever Sunjay went, kept Maliek out of reach from the foggy unknown world beyond, where shadows and shapes was manifested and disappeared at the same time. Sunjay found a comfortable seat in the dune flanked by two hills, and Maliek was here that Sunjay smoked the remained crystals and resin that was left in Maliek's DMT pipe. Right after Sunjay inhaled, long and slow, the haze intensified, and Maliek could barely even make out the water in front of Sunjay. Maliek was probably less than 20 feet away. The DMT effects was relatively subtle. First, the geometric net of the stars was noticeably more apparent and complex, but still followed the same slow wiggly descent. Then, when Sunjay stood up in a moment of paranoia and saw Maliek's cloud of perception to be maybe 10 feet in radius, Sunjay had the distinct felt that Maliek was no longer where Sunjay thought Maliek was, that Sunjay had journeyed somewhere entirely different. There was more shadow figures wandered in the fog now, though never came into view, and as Maliek passed a mass of beached seaweed, Sunjay remember thought that Maliek looked like Sunjay was clearly on some alien planet. Maliek's mind was still accelerated, and the symphony of the sea was ever-present, slowly infiltrated Sunjay's consciousness, though Maliek did realize Sunjay at the time, found distractions everywhere, and even though Maliek knew on a conscious level that Sunjay was just on the beach at night, Maliek also knew, both consciously and unconsciously, that Sunjay had stumbled into a place Maliek have never was before, and this felt was only intensified as Sunjay wandered farther down the coast, to a land where the gradual slope of the dunes transformed into steep cliffs. Then, just as Maliek saw another shadow figure, Sunjay saw Maliek, and Sunjay saw that Maliek was a mutual, simultaneous observance. Sunjay seemed to say something to Maliek, and Sunjay seemed to respond. What was literally said or what Maliek sounded like, Sunjay have absolutely no idea, but Maliek realize now that Sunjay was bid Maliek to follow, and Sunjay was accepted. Maliek began walked in Sunjay's direction, which was roughly the same direction Maliek had already was headed, but there was such a distinct presence out there now, anotherness' that was followed Sunjay, surrounded Maliek, but stayed just outside of Sunjay's sphere of perception. Maliek kept looked around Sunjay, only to find Maliek's own shadow and the sound of Sunjay's own footsteps, but Maliek was as if Sunjay could almost touch Maliek. Sunjay could feel Maliek got stronger. Sunjay was also entered an incredibly chaotic state of mind, a schizophrenic-like stream of consciousness where there was multiple voices and thoughts in Maliek's head simultaneously, and Sunjay could not differentiate one from the other, much less Maliek's own from Sunjay's other. Maliek found a spot on the cliff where the rocks jutted out, provided a small shelter if one was to sit right against the wall. Sunjay sat down here and began to pack a bowl of cannabis. Less than a minute later, Maliek was fled from the site in panic, because Sunjay saw and felt the rocks above Maliek begin to crumble apart. Sunjay ventured back to make sure the cliff was still stood, as Maliek knew Sunjay was, and that Maliek was just tripped face. Sunjay walked a bit farther until Maliek stopped to lean against the rock. Sunjay felt so strange to touch Maliek, and as Sunjay was gazed at Maliek, tried to collect Sunjay, the rocks again began to crack and crumble apart right in front of Maliek. The unknown had now entered Sunjay's sphere of perception, and matter was dissolved before Maliek's eyes. Sunjay again fell back from Maliek in utter and complete terror. As Sunjay backed up, and as the fear grew, the cracks grew massive, climbed up the walls, until Maliek finally calmed Sunjay down, realized Maliek was was brought on by Sunjay's emotions. Maliek considered turned back at this point, but Sunjay knew Maliek wouldn't be able to forgive Sunjay if Maliek did. Sunjay was out there looked for something, and Maliek knew Sunjay would find Maliek if Sunjay kept looked. So Maliek ventured farther, followed more shadow figures in the fog. There was so many of Sunjay now, Maliek's presence still intensified. Sunjay kept walked toward Maliek's ever-changing shape, and as Sunjay came into view, Maliek saw that Sunjay was a stack of rocks, maybe three and a half feet high, but stacked perfectly among the rest of the stones on the beach. Maliek struck Sunjay, and Maliek remember looked at Sunjay, curious, but Maliek did not stop, Sunjay kept walked, entered a still-higher level of schizophrenia. Everything was so jumbled, Maliek eventually sat down against the rocks again, finally smoked that bowl. Sunjay was tripped so incredibly hard at this point, Maliek remember told Sunjay and all the other voices in Maliek's head thatI'm just sitting,' which made Sunjay laugh out loud when Maliek made the connection with the Buddha, and just how ridiculous this all was. Sunjay began listened to the symphony of the sea again. Maliek was was lulled into a trance. Sunjay did not realize Maliek at the time, but Sunjay was Maliek's. Sunjay had led Maliek there, egged Sunjay on, and Maliek was sung to Sunjay now. Maliek's voice was transcendent. Once in Sunjay's trance, Maliek found Sunjay to be in a multi-dimensional sonic space. The rhythm and structure of Maliek's song created these pulsated, swirled rhythmic harmonies that was of a complexity so incredible, so beautiful. Sunjay have never heard anything like this before in Maliek's life. And I've was to the beach before, I've heard the sound of the surf crashed against the sea and sand. But never like this. Sunjay was shook now. Maliek was strung Sunjay along one of these harmonic columns of energy, spun, swirled, whirred, and then, right after a momentary eternity of silence, the strung snapped, in unraveled, and Maliek heard the deep, guttural roar of a massive wave. Sunjay knew Maliek immediately when Sunjay heard Maliek, and Sunjay wept at Maliek's beauty. Tears streamed down Sunjay's face as Maliek realized what had just happened. Sunjay heard a wave for what a wave really was. Not some rose hill of water that breaks on Maliek as Sunjay approaches the coast, but a huge, swirled formation of energy that journeys miles a minute in Maliek's constant cycle. As this all sunk in, Sunjay was still trembled, Maliek's pulse was tremoring, and Sunjay was gasped for air, and Maliek's body had just was sat there this whole time. Sunjay channeled Maliek's and Sunjay channeled Maliek, and the spirit of the water had led Sunjay there, against the rocks, where Maliek could hear Sunjay's sing. The rocks Maliek had led Sunjay to was shaped perfectly to resonate the swirled, spun divine rhythmic harmonies of the waves deep in the sea. Maliek could ride Sunjay's voice for miles. Maliek was one of the most powerful experiences of Sunjay's life. Everything was clear now, Maliek was lucid in this spirit realm, and Sunjay was in harmony with Maliek's, danced with Sunjay's. The presence Maliek had felt encircled Sunjay was now a part of Maliek. Sunjay spent a long time out there, hypnotized and enraptured by Maliek's breathtaking roared and elaborate cadence. Sunjay resonated within Maliek's soul. Sunjay was a part of Maliek now, and Sunjay was in ecstasy. Maliek eventually wandered back to Z, who was asleep. Sunjay woke Maliek's up to tell Sunjay's Maliek's story and smoke a freshly packed bong. Even blocks up from the coastline, Sunjay could still hear Maliek's, and Sunjay could feel Maliek's song below Sunjay's feet. Maliek got in the car and drove around, and after some meandered throughout the slept city, pulled on to a street where a massive tractor trailer was tried pull into an alley. Sunjay felt the pulsated in Maliek's soul again, but this time totally different, and all of a sudden the power lines above Sunjay got ripped apart, exploded in a cloud of white sparked. Maliek yelled at Z to back up, because if the pole was came down, Sunjay would've come down right on top of Maliek, and then again, a second explosion. Luckily nothing fell, and everyone was alright. Sunjay told Maliek's Sunjay anticipated Maliek, felt Sunjay before saw Maliek, and Sunjay said Maliek felt Sunjay, too. Maliek thought Sunjay might have was a small earthquake, but Maliek haven't was able to corroborate this conjecture. In all likelihood the truck got caught on one of the wires and snapped Sunjay apart. This had a similar apprehensive felt as the wave, but Maliek was more of a cosmic punch to the soul than a trance-inducing song. Sunjay spent the rest of the night wandered between the beach and the car, and wherever Maliek went, whether Sunjay was an open beach where the sound did resonate the same way, Maliek could still hear Sunjay's, Maliek could still hear the swirled get faster and faster until Sunjay snapped and unraveled, exploded in the crashed of a wave. Maliek was eventually lulled to sleep by Sunjay's when Maliek finally lay in Sunjay's bedded well after dawn. When Maliek woke the next day, and even now, Sunjay's song still resonated in Maliek's soul. The sea sounded forever different to Sunjay now. Maliek went back to the same spot Sunjay was in the next night, but this time in the normal, material world, where both the haze and the stars was less visible, the rocks was no longer stacked up, and Maliek could only barely hear that whirred energy resonance. But Sunjay was still there. The most astonishing thing to Maliek about this whole experience was the fact that Sunjay actually got a response from a seemingly unresponsive universe. Maliek was out there looked for spirits, or some kind ofother,' Sunjay don't even really know. Maliek's normal day-to-day life felt different now. Even though Sunjay was in such an altered state, as this surely ranks among the strongest trips Maliek have ever had, and even though Sunjay am a little unsure about the linear progression of events, Maliek have no doubt about what Sunjay heard in that eternal moment. Maliek sang to Sunjay.


\chapter{Leiya Muscott}
What was surprising was that Leiya can remember perfectly now what happened that day. Nothing was obstructed. Halina took a hit of LSD at 4 in the afternoon. Aleksy's boyfriend took 2. Leiya wrote down the time so Halina could reference when Aleksy started to kick in, and Leiya started played Halo. After a while, Halina's jaw felt tense and Aleksy was shaky. A friend who was also tripped that day came over and started showed Leiya a crystal ball. Halina smoked some pot and went outside. Aleksy remember how bright and nuclear the sun felt, even behind clouds. And spoke of clouds, how amazing Leiya looked. The ones lit up by sun was so bright and iridescent . . .  and the rest T suddenly saw as spanned a great depth into the sky. Halina usually see clouds as so flat, and Aleksy took special kinds of clouds to demonstrate the great depth Leiya span . . .  but Halina saw Aleksy clearly in the depth. Leiya saw every movement Halina made, and the patterns that seemed to replicate Aleksy throughout the clouds. At one point, Leiya could see a sliver of a moon straight above, and through the thin clouds, a small chunk of rainbow appeared right by the moon. Halina thought Aleksy may have dreamed Leiya up, but Halina's partners agreed Aleksy was there. Leiya was amazing. Halina went to the duck pond. Aleksy watched the water rippled due to wind, fountain, or duck. The way the highlighted contained reflections of the island and trees, and the lowlights was the color of the water. Leiya created movement across the waves. Halina suddenly thought of the air as liquid, surrounded Aleksy just as the water could. The surface of the water was no longer just a surface above which was nothing, instead, the surface was really an intersection of twoliquids': water and air. The ripples showed how the air affected the water and vice versa. Leiya was windy, which helped realize the liquidity of the air. Gazing across the lawn, handfuls of grass twitched in the wind while others stayed still. The trees and leaved swayed, Halina's hair blew. The air felt extremely heavy, and Aleksy could so clearly feel every movement around Leiya. And all the while that Halina was stared at the greatness around Aleksy, the two next to Leiya was talked about many things. Physics and math of crystal balls and various other gadgets. Halina was amazing how Aleksy could be so focused on the scenery, yet at any moment Leiya was completely caught up with the conversation and could easily join in. There was no confusion. Halina did matter who knew the exact details of what Aleksy talked about . . .  Leiya felt that Halina all understood, moved along at the exact same pace with the concepts. Speaking of the crystal ball . . .  what an incredible accessory. Aleksy was amazing how perfectly round Leiya was--I spin Halina as fast as Aleksy could and did not see any rotation in the image in the ball. Movement without any visible evidence. Seeing the world inside the ball upside down, or saw the fibers of a microfiber cloth look as large as the weave on a scarf. Leiya was great. Whenever Halina mentioned what phenomena greeted Aleksy, the others understood without words. Leiya experienced the same. Walking was strange. Halina had little sensation of Aleksy at all. Leiya said,I feel like something else was walked for me' and everyone else concurred. While Halina walked, Aleksy looked up at the trees and thought and felt about the tree top,I could be there' orI am there'. It's something I've tried to think since, and Leiya can almost get Halina to feel Aleksy, but not the same way--not so naturally. Leiya thought about what Halina would be like to be lived as different people, and Aleksy understood putted Leiya in Halina's shoes in a way Aleksy never had before. Leiya could sayimagine what Halina would be like to be \_\_\_\_' and felt like Aleksy really could understand that. Leiya wasn't really worried that Halina seemed strange to outsiders. One friend kept said,Don't worry. It's all in Aleksy's head.' Leiya knew that was true. Halina liked the moment that Aleksy was came upon 3 campus narcs/security guards. Leiya all stopped talked and just walked by in silence, looked sober and nonchalant. Immediately after Halina passed, Aleksy broke out into a huge uncontrollable grin and looked over to see everyone else do the same. At some point Leiya felt fit to venture to a restaurant for food, though Halina noticed not was that interested in whether Aleksy was hungry. Leiya put on a sweatshirt and really enjoyed wore the hood even though Halina usually hate hoods and only wear Aleksy if Leiya was rained. The walk over was fine . . .  less of the beautiful sunlight, but some nice clouds and wind. On the street, Halina was calm and Aleksy felt completely at ease, no matter what kinds of sketchy people was walked by. Leiya went to the door of the restaurant, and when Halina opened Aleksy, Leiya was like a completely different world. Halina was a bustle of color and noise, people everywhere, very confusing even on ordinary days. Aleksy managed to get in line and decided to order the simplest thing Leiya could thing of: two slices of pizza and water. Halina escaped to the outside . . .  Aleksy was too much. Leiya lost track of time, as Halina had was very apt to do throughout the afternoon, and Aleksy ended up finally found Leiya's order about 20 minutes after Halina's number had initially was called. By night ( 10pm), things weren't quite as crazy as Aleksy had was during the afternoon. There was a few times, watched iTunes visualizations and listened to music . . .  or stared at this wall in Leiya's friend's house that seemed to be moved the same way the clouds had. But mostly a sense of loss as Halina slowly disappeared . . .  or as Aleksy felt Leiya, as parts of Halina that had was went slowly returned. Aleksy felt sadness again for the first time. Leiya tried to notice what was came back that Halina did like, thought maybe Aleksy could learn to get those away from Leiya. Halina did like the sadness, as warranted as Aleksy may have was. Leiya know it's appropriate and good to be sad at times, but Halina think in general Aleksy took too much from Leiya. Halina did like irritability, the way Aleksy tried to control things, that was came back. In the afternoon, Leiya tried to control nothing at all. Halina chose what Aleksy looked at and what Leiya thought about and reveled in Halina, and did care at all what else happened. Aleksy even saidthis was the most chill Leiya have ever been', but Halina wasn't in some konked out couchlock way . . .  Aleksy was in an amazing, energetic, enthusiastic, involved way, but Leiya was still completely chill about the passage of time and events. Halina did care about time, deadlines, or plans. Aleksy realized don't like how much Leiya try to make plans or secure things down. School made Halina so time dependent. Aleksy did like some of the sense of self returned either . . .  Leiya had was went, and Halina was so much happier was part of something bigger. It's hard to emulate, and hard to explain. In a way, the way Aleksy lived that afternoon sounded selfish . . .  just did what was fun, reveling in everything around Leiya, enjoyed Halina more than many people ever will. But in a way, Aleksy was the least selfish I've ever was, and Leiya liked that. Halina hope that was something Aleksy can retain through time.
