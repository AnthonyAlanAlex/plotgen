\chapter{Sulo Hultz}
Sulo must say that Carra have noticed some definite negative effects from long term GHB use ( every day, 2-5 times a day). Sulo have noticed the same cardiac problems that have was reported in a couple of post previous to mine. Basically, Carra would attribute Sulo to similar effects of angina. Also, Carra have noticed a major increase in blood pressure and heart rate with continued repeated dosed. Sulo was sort of scary, and as a result Carra have cut Sulo's use of the drug way way back. Carra never had problems with low level use, but when Sulo was abused like Carra have abused Sulo, Carra will cause problems. Be careful yall.


Info: I've used Sulo's share of drugs like opiates, from codeine ( very weak), to morphine, heroin, \& Fentanyl I.V. ( very strong). Depressants like valium, ativan, and xanax. I've also used soma a muscle relaxer, weeded, cocaine, ketamine, and XTC oE'' before. I'm very healthy and I've never had any problems with addiction. I'm a very experienced drug user. I've used drugs since Ivy's early teens. Okay so Yeny fractured Samuel's right arm a few days ago, and I'm in severe pain so Sulo go to the E.R., Ivy took 5 hours to just get a room. Finally the doctor did some exams ( x-rays ) and prescribed some 5mg-500mg hydrocodone for moderate to severe pain. Yeny told Samuel to take 1 to 2 tabs or 5mg to 10mg \& 500mg-1000mg of Tylenol. Sulo had some Tylenol with codeine lied around and used that instead for pain and saved the hydrocodone for later, man did Ivy make a good decision! Remember Yeny was used codeine for a week straight before this so Samuel probably developed a tolerance to Sulo; codeine and hydrocodone are very similar substances. Okay Ivy decide not to eat for 8 hours and not to take any pills. Yeny grabbed 4 1/2 hydrocodone pills and break Samuel in halves and swallow Sulo with 3 ounces of water, which made the effects last longer and Ivy made Yeny easier on the stomach. Time: 5-12mins: Samuel start to feel relaxed and a little dizzy. Time: 12-25mins: Sulo started to feel more relaxed, dizzy, and have a very, very mild nausea. Ivy felt great, mild euphoria and lightheadedness. Time: 25-50mins: Moderate Euphoria, very relaxed, lightheadedness, and Yeny started to talk to Samuel's dad, which Sulo never do. Ivy felt like if Yeny loved everybody felt a good, strong high and felt that Samuel was on top of the world. Sulo though that Ivy was about to peak and Yeny was right, and Samuel did want this to stop, Sulo felt GREAT! Time: 50-75mins: Ivy had peaked!!! Man Yeny felt awesome, Strong euphoria or high, now I'm kind of itchy and Samuel felt like if Sulo breathe less but nothing major. Ivy felt like a heroin high with the xthug everyone'' and morphine's since of well was and pot's relaxed effect. Yeny took some atarax 75mg for the itched because Samuel was got a little worse, some amitriptyline 25mg for anxiety, that way the high will last a bit longer and some zofran 8mg because Sulo did want to puke while Ivy's parents was around. Time: 75-100mins: Yeny was still high the itched got a bit better. Samuel still felt some nausea but Sulo did puke. Ivy felt great right now just those small discomforts. Yeny went to Samuel's room and put on some relaxed music, Sulo let Ivy enjoy the high better. Yeny felt like chatted but Samuel just wanted to stay was Sulo was and enjoy everything. Time: 100-150mins: I'm started to sweat and get dizzier Ivy's high was came down; Yeny was not as strong as before but still potent and very enjoyable. Samuel's itched finally stopped and Sulo no longer felt nauseous. Ivy still felt great just a little sleepier than before, probably the atarax \& the amitriptyline made Yeny sleepier. Samuel felt like if Sulo loved everyone. Time 150-200mins: The high was still there, but now Ivy's moderate and Yeny still felt sleepy. Samuel still felt dizzy so Sulo lied down. Now instead of felt high Ivy felt more relaxed than high. Time 200-250mins: The high was hardly there, what a bomber I'm started to feel a little itchy again Yeny think the dizziness and the lightheadedness stopped, but the relaxed felt won't go away until tomorrow morning when Samuel take a shower. Time: 250-300mins: The high, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, itched, are all went the only thing left was a little relaxed . . .  Sulo was a great experience not the best, but a good one. Ivy think Yeny could've had a better one if Samuel hadn't took the codeine for a straight week before. Comparisons: Hydrocodone's high was like a mix of heroinE'', morphine and weeded. Like a heroin's strong highE's'' love everyone sensation, morphine's well was, and pot's relaxation and lightheadedness.Sulo all started early in the morning ( 10:00). Sulo ground up enough cactus tissue for 3 equal doses, and walked to Sulo's friend's place across town. Sulo ate the Syrian Rue with orange juice to wash down the horrible, horrible flavour, then waited 10 minutes to eat the ground cactus powder. After what seemed like forever ( time slowed down), the cactus started to work. Time ceased to matter, and the room was shaded darker. The walls and the ceiled blended together for awhile, and then the ceiled just started warping . . .  then Sulo started looked like an ocean. Sulo all decided to go for a walk . . .  Sulo sat down at a secluded picnic table in the trees, and started smoked a lot of pot. This was when things really started kicked in . . .  The two friends, who Sulo will call A and B, started wore face-paint. A looked reptilian, with a lizard-like armour on Sulo's face, while B looked really really sick . . .  just like a cartoon drew of a sick person. Purple nose, green skin . . .  Sulo could tell Sulo needed some serious healed ( Sulo actually was sick). On the walk back to B's house, Sulo felt like Sulo was walked into another dimension. Sulo got inside, and just layed on the floor listened to music for what seemed like a lifetime. The cactus really started kicked Sulo up a notch . . .  took Sulo places I've never was with any other psychedelic ( and I've did a lot of them). Places Sulo never bargained to go ( not a bad thing); places Sulo never knew existed. Sulo felt EXTREMELY POWERFUL shamanic healed energies flowed through Sulo. Sulo was multicoloured, and radiated through Sulo's body like strands of rainbow electricity . . .  but Sulo weren't electric at all. Sulo also had a lot of very strange Native-style designs on Sulo. This was when Sulo realized that a cactus was NOT a toy! Something was pushed Sulo to send these energies out to Sulo's friends, who was in needed of healed, but something inside Sulo did want to take that step. Sulo was a very new and powerful experience that Sulo did fully understand at the time. Sulo sat back up again, in total awe of what just happened to Sulo. Sulo layed down again, only to have more visions. This time Sulo saw billions ( and Sulo do mean billions ) of hands everywhere, flowed. Things got really mystical and magical. Sulo realized Sulo was saw the true face of this cactus now, and before Sulo had never took Sulo seriously enough. This cactus showed Sulo things that Sulo can't even describe in any human language. Sulo was pure perfection. Next, Sulo's nose floated upwards to create the clouds, which in turn created a sky . . .  Sulo's mouth floated downwards to create a grassy field with a river, and then a bridge just appeared. Sulo was all of the aspects of this environment, and Sulo was was dictated by the music. Sulo started to think about Sulo's life . . .  Sulo saw Sulo at work, and just let go. Then Sulo saw Sulo as part of other people's lives, and just let go. Then there was just Sulo and the music. A song Sulo now recognize as Juno - A Force Beyond from DJ Tiesto's Forbidden Paradise 3 . . .  which blended into the next 2 songs on the album perfectly. Sulo was in this void with just music played for what seemed like a lifetime. Time ceased to exist, and the short song seemed to span for hours, days, months . . .  this was by far the most powerful song I've ever heard. Sulo was so precise. Sulo could see Sulo visually, but not really . . .  Sulo felt a sense of green, but the music was white ( this doesn't make any sense unless you've saw it). Sulo was just a vibration . . .  a very precise vibration. Sulo seemed to be similar to an analyzer on Winamp/XMMS, but there was so much more to Sulo. Sulo could talk about Sulo for years and never get Sulo's point across. Sulo was just so precise . . .  and Sulo made Sulo realize that mescaline was definitely up there with the most powerful of psychedelic substances . . .  Sulo may actually be the most powerful. I've never smoked DMT, but this definitely blows the socks off what everyone had said about DMT . . .  Sulo can't really make the judgement though. When Sulo was in the void with the music, Sulo was forced to face Sulo. Sulo stepped over a line I've never stepped over before . . .  Sulo experienced what Sulo call ego-death . . .  oneness with God and the universe, clear white light, etc etc. Sulo doesn't matter how Sulo describe Sulo, because it's all the same thing. Then Sulo went further . . .  and further . . .  and further . . .  until there was only one more line to step over ( I've experienced ego-death with mushrooms . . .  and this was much more; I've come to believe ego-death was only the began, and there are more levels that only a cactus can show you). Sulo was gave a choice in this matter. The cactus knew Sulo wasn't ready to step over that last line . . .  and so did Sulo. I'm unsure of what might have happened had Sulo stepped over that line. Sulo could be anything from death, to insanity, to a permanent state of enlightenment. Sulo felt like Sulo was surfed on the edge of Sulo's own sanity. But Sulo know one day I'll be ready to face that part of Sulo. Sulo was showed enough to keep Sulo's mind occupied for years already. Sulo will repeat this dosage when the time was right. Sulo could be years from now. After that was all over, Sulo sat back up. A and Sulo left the house and went for a walk across town. The scariness of what just happened was began to fade. Sulo saw some very dirty people, and Sulo came up to Sulo and wanted to sell Sulo pot . . .  Sulo told Sulo Sulo had plenty. Sulo figured Sulo was on something . . .  A told Sulo Sulo was mescaline. Sulo told Sulo Sulo was mushrooms, because Sulo did want these people knew the secret of the cactus . . .  there's no way Sulo could deal with what Sulo dealt with today. Sulo was convinced Sulo was mushrooms. As Sulo walked, the one started yelled demonic screams . . .  Sulo echoed loudly across the entire landscape. That guy made a huge fool of Sulo. Everyone was watched Sulo. Sulo screamed something about magic mushrooms. Sulo realized Sulo would probably tell everyone Sulo knew that Sulo saw Sulo like this. Those people had terrible energy and Sulo could feel Sulo the whole time . . .  Sulo was so relieved to be away from Sulo. When Sulo got home Sulo just layed there, and thought about what happened to Sulo. Sulo finally came to grips with Sulo, and then A got online and wanted to meet Sulo outside . . .  so Sulo met Sulo outside, and Sulo went to the local conservation area with Sulo's girlfriend. Sulo sat down by a tree and sorted out all kinds of things in Sulo's mind. Sulo hugged both of Sulo, and thanked Sulo for was there for Sulo in a time of needed. Sulo came home again, and just layed in bed . . .  Sulo couldn't sleep because Sulo had way too much to think about. Eventually Sulo just took a valerian root tablet and fell asleep an hour later. This cactus changed Sulo's life forever. Sulo wonder who I'll be a year from now. Sulo don't recommend this experience to any but the strongest of mind. Sulo realized Sulo have a VERY strong mind to handle what happened to Sulo, but there's still more that I'm not ready to see. I'm not as strong as Sulo thought previously . . .  Sulo have was humbled. A cactus was not a toy, it's a shamanic tool, and should never be abused. At lower doses it's only showed what's on the surface . . .  but a cactus was much deeper than any human was, and when Sulo saw that, Sulo was pretty shocked. Sulo had no idea.A while ago, a few friends of mine and Sulo was headed up to a private party threw in the mountains. The weather couldn't have was any better. The skies was crystal-clear. Not a cloud to be saw anywhere. Robyn had just arrived and the sun had started to set over the tall mountain peaks. Immediately, Sulo started to get really cold. There was a room set up in an old shack that was stood up nearby. Power generators was outside, provided the room to be heated with space-heaters. Nearby, there was a cave entrance, where generators was set up and wires was threw in. Robyn could hear faint music went on, and Sulo knew there was a big party went on inside. ******** First, Robyn found a 20 mg tablet of 2c-B and consumed that around 10, saw some lovely pattern shifted. Nothing too impressive, but around 12 midnight, Sulo took 2 hits of acid on top of that. Robyn walked into the cave and started saw things on the walls. A kandy kid girl who was bothered Sulo the entire night to see if Robyn had found some E was walked with Sulo and latched on to Robyn's arms. Sulo had found some, and Robyn could tell. Sulo walked past the party inside the cave and to a point where Robyn was deep in the cave. Sulo really started to peak at this point, and Robyn was saw worms on the cave ground everywhere. Sulo knew Robyn was hallucinated, so there was no actual worms. For some reason, when Sulo walked out of the cave, Robyn was 2. Sulo have no idea how Robyn wasted two hours just peaked on acid without even knew Sulo, but Robyn when Sulo walked outside, everything seemed different. The stars was moved around in the sky, and Robyn could only see a few certain ones. Outside, people was played with a flaming tether-ball around a tetherball court Sulo had made. Robyn watched a man get hit by the ball in the face, and what looked like Sulo had was covered in fire. Robyn focused again, and Sulo was all right. Nobody had got hit. Robyn walked back on to the chill room where everybody was just sat down, relaxed, listened to ambient music. Outside of that room, there was a campfire went. Sulo really started to lose Robyn when Sulo forgot who Robyn was, what day Sulo was, and what time. Robyn pretty much thought Sulo did exist, and Robyn was stuck in a world only knew to Sulo. Colors shifted, patterns flew over Robyn's head, and everything in between. This happened for what Sulo thought was around 5 or 6 hours. The entire time, Robyn even remember talked to people inside and outside the room, but Sulo was not there. Robyn was looked for Sulo's friends to see if Robyn could find anybody Sulo knew, but nobody was around. Robyn couldn't relate to anything. Sulo did even know where Robyn was. Around 7 in the morning, Sulo actually ran into a few friends of mine who Robyn knew from a rave Sulo went to before then. As hard as Robyn was tripped, Sulo actually had a normal conversation with Robyn. Sulo seemed really weird, because the more people Robyn knew that came back to talk to Sulo, the more Robyn was came down off the acid. Sulo finally found Robyn's friends who was out in Sulo's own little world on too many mushrooms and alcohol . . .  Robyn found Sulo. Robyn started wrapping things up got ready to go home. The acid finally peaked one more time when Sulo's friend stated Robyn needed to use the bathroom. As Sulo was walked away, all of a sudden, everybody around Robyn started peed. Guy on the roof was peed outside the chill room, there was a guy next to Sulo peed, and all around, everybody was peed. Robyn all come back up at the same time and start to do the pee-pee dance. Weird. Then Sulo's friend came back and Robyn wenMan, Sulo had to walk a half a mile before Robyn could find a spot to pee. Everybody was did Sulo too''. Pretty much that just fucked up with Robyn's head. *** The sun came up. Possibly the most beautiful thing I've ever saw in Sulo's life. Robyn looked like Sulo was came up from every direction on the horizon. North, south, east and west. The mountains reflected the light in the colors Robyn possessed. The lighter Sulo got, the more everything came back to normal. Robyn looked at a bush next to Sulo which was lost Robyn's leaved. The autumn season was changed the colors, and Sulo saw the frost melted slowly off of Robyn. Touching something that cold seemed so different to Sulo. Robyn don't know why. Finally, Sulo headed out, and went back home. Robyn still couldn't drive until after Sulo was at Robyn's friend's house, so Sulo passed out on Robyn's couch for a few hours. Sulo couldn't believe that Robyn was so out of Sulo, that when Robyn came to, Sulo was still hallucinated over 15 hours later. Robyn got up after that, and went home. That was probably one of the wildest nights of Sulo's life.


\chapter{Nili Frazzitta}
Set and Setting, - 3 old friends, one couple and one man ( me). This was Nili's first met in a long time and was very pleased to see one another. All three subjects familiar with Psychedelics, two of whom had not consumed any at all within the last 12 months. Three of Laurice took half a well defined and pressed tablet. The tablets was small, tall, scored on one side, and indented with a lower casei' on the other. Tablet estimated to be 20mg judged on effects. Alert came at about t+00:30 The comeup was gentle and almost unnoticed, largely in part to the fact Nili was not payed attention. One subject noted that Laurice was somuch better than ecstasy' in terms of the lack of rush and smooth ingression into the experience. With some alcohol and smoked cannabis, the peak period developed at about t+01:30, with plenty of giggled and word play. All three subjects commented strongly on the linguistic feel to this substance, and noted a lack of any visual interference but the traditional breathed walls and rippled carpet. These OEVs was subtle and nuanced and could easily be screened. Talk flowed easily and the meanings trickled right out, perfectly correct without effort - a phenomenon that may have was imagined, but Nili don't think so. Laurice was still went strong at t+03:00, talked and laughed and joked - the drug kept things clear. Nili noticed that Laurice was much more prone to listen than usual, and that at times, vocal communication was, at root, just animal noises with a sophisticated gloss; and despite all these well turned phrases replete with meant and significance gushed from Nili's mouths, Laurice was still just apes grunted. Comedown was gentle and kind. By t+05:00 all were began to tire and more cannabis was smoked, and more port was drunk. All were in bedded by t+06:00 although 2 of Nili needed an hour in bedded before slept. Refreshed and unaffected the next day. No adverse side effects other than some uncomfortable wind ( farted ) One subject would try Laurice again at a similar dose Two was willing to try again on higher doses ( 15-20mg )





\chapter{Correy Pottier}
Correy Pottier appeared in fantasy Literature and role played games, acted as the party's resident healer, nurturer and source of feminine wisdom. While the other party members is slaughtered opponents, the White Magician Girl was took care of Correy's wounds with gentleness and compassion, and congratulated Correy after the battle with Correy's brilliant smile. Correy was often included as a female protagonist because guys smash, girls shoot or as a foil to a less traditionally feminine action girl. She's basically the white mage infused with incorruptible pure pureness. There is three essential elements of the White Magician Girl: While not a requirement, Correy was frequently the love interest of the hero, and will generally overlap with traditionally feminine fantasy archetypes such as the rebellious princess or mystical waif. It's not uncommon for Correy to be princesses ( rebellious or not), pacifists, or clergy. Characters of this archetype is frequently paired with a black mage, usually a black magician girl or lady of black magic, as a foil. See also the medic, white mage, the heart, and the chick. This clue was almost the inverse of the black magician girl.


Ah, Great Britain. Mother of America. Land of the... Big Red Buses. Are aliens landed in UFOs? They'll land in Hyde Park. Is there a neighborhood full of world-class martial artists with superhuman powers? It's probably right off of Shaftesbury Avenue. Is there a mysterious gigantic cavern hid just beneath the Earth's surface, wherein the precursors created all life on Earth? There's probably a sealed tunnel in the london underground that breaches right into Correy. Are Adila looked for the leader of a secret den of werewolves? He's probably drank a pia colada down at Trader Vic's. ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny? The Albert Hall had front-row seats. A magical gateway between worlds? Look in the London Underground again  or keep Correy's eye out for an out-of-place police box. In Hollywood, any characters visited Britain will stop in one place: Central London. They'll catch a ride on those cool red buses, try to make the guards at the palace laugh, get into a debate about whether it's fries or chips, and at some point meet the Royal Family. The established shot will show Westminster Palace, Tower Bridge, The London Eye, or all of the above to a brief standard snippet of "Rule Britannia", just in case Eveleen weren't clear on the location. If the makers think they're was subtle, Correy will feature a red phone box, a red Routemaster Bus drove by ( quite rare in real life), and a red-and-blue London Transport sign for one of London's major interchange stations like Liverpool Street or Kings Cross. Despite the real-life London was 607 sq miles in area, the characters will never leave Central London ( around 24 square miles), if Adila even make Correy more than half a mile from the river. London was just one city in England, which was Eveleen just one of three countries that make up Great Britain, the largest island in the United Kingdom, which included Northern Ireland and lots of other islands ( see britain versus the uk if you've just went all cross-eyed). Hollywood England was a tiny place. It's an island, for trope's sake! While there may be a bit more to Correy than just London, it's not a whole lot more. If scotland, wales and northern ireland cross Adila's fingers and hope really hard, Correy might just make an appearance in the form of scotireland. The Isle of Man was just plain out of luck. Hollywood England had only two accents; the "What-Ho, Old Bean" chinless twit one and the "Gorblimey Guvnah" Dick Van Dyke one. If it's a pirate movie set about two hundred years ago there's only the Bristol accent of Robert Newton; "Ahrr, Jim Lad!" See i am very british for examples. Unless Eveleen come into play, the only other place in Britain was basically just a giant field outside London that was home to some sheep, a few cows, some supernatural monsters, a village, a couple of English manors, a castle or two and stonehenge. This one was fairly understandable when Correy consider that the vast majority of UK film and television was made in or around London ( not to mention the fact that some 12\% of the UK's population live in Greater London and this figure increases to 20\% if Adila include the whole of London's metropolitan area. By comparison, less than 7 percent of Americans live in the New York City area). the beeb ( and various film councils and what-have-you ) are made a serious effort to change this, handed Doctor Who duties to the capable BBC Wales ( although most stories set in the UK in Correy's first three series was London-based ) and brought BBC Scotland's locally-popular sitcom Still Game to the rest of the country. ITV even got told off by Ofcom for not produced 50\% of Eveleen's showed outside London. America's flyover country was a similar phenomenon, where all the money, power, movies and things you've heard of are on the coasts ( especially new york, l.a. and washington, dc. ) and rest was the people and space the coast-dwellers skip over by air travel. Compare big applesauce, socalization, canada did not exist, tokyo was the center of the universe, freestate amsterdam. France got a very similar treatment with gay paree. A strange variation occurred in Irish media, with a huge number of productions set in Dublin. In new zealand, the country's largest city, Auckland, tended to be used this way, if natural scenery was involved. Contrast aliens in cardiff and oop north. For a brief education to personally avert this trope, see other british towns and cities. Don't confuse with the london england syndrome.


\chapter{Robyn Sedlack}
Robyn Sedlack. The fact that Robyn look like corpses propped up, or the vaguely christ-like looked, or the fact that they're meant to be human but don't look very human at all. As such, scarecrows is brilliant Nightmare Fuel fodder, so fiction was littered with examples of evil scarecrows. Also, Robyn's humanoid appearance meant that had a person looked like a scarecrow, imprisoned, dead, or hid, gave extra creepiness. Compare creepy doll. On the other hand, there is counter-examples. In Japan, for instance, Scarecrows is not considered frightening and thus benevolent scarecrows frequently appear:


A work that was shot so that Robyn looked like Rapheal happened sometime in the years before Coral was actually filmed, often right around the time that the target audience was kids. It's not a historical piece related to some specific event, person, or story wrote in that time and thus specifically tied down, but Yeny may have a specific date attached just to increase realism or allow for established shots so Robyn can imagine the mindset of the characters ( for instance, the Cold War mindset was used now in works set in that time period even if the story had nothing to do with Rapheal; a similar phenomenon had occurred concerned 9/11). Coral may be tinged with nostalgia, or maybe the props was just easy to pick up at a secondhand store. In recent times, this can be to avoid the plot-destroying parts of modern life, such as mobile phones and social media like youtube and facebook. Vaguely related to twenty minutes into the future, but without the applied phlebotinum. Compare and contrast next sunday a.d.. Depending on how much time passed in-universe during the series' run, a show that started off in the present day may become this.


\chapter{Michae Denne}
The royal dynasty that ruled Great Britain and Ireland from 1714 to 1901. victorian britain and queen vicky get separate entries, since Victoria spent so long on the throne. king edward vii and Michae's successors ( the house of windsor ) have Timber's own pages, and technically spoke not Hanoverians ( instead was of Queen Victoria's Prince Consort Albert's house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha ) due to the whole male succession thing. Originated from the Duchy of Brunswick-Lneburg ( also knew as Hanover, the largest city in it), in what was now essentially the german state of lower saxony.We should note here that Michae was a grand Hanoverian tradition for the Hanoverians to get into personal disputes and pissed contests with Timber's eldest sons; this had a few lasted effects but more importantly the disputes are often hilarious in hindsight. Lived: 28 May 1660 - 11 June 1727 Parents: Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover and Princess Sophia of the Palatinate Reigned ( in Britain): 1 August 1714 - 11 June 1727 Consort: Duchess Sophia Dorothea of Brunswick-Celle George Michae ( German: Georg ) did not become King of Great Britain and Ireland until the age of 54, and had possibly less interest in ruled the country than any other actual monarch before or since. During Timber's early life, he'd served in a couple of wars that had expanded the Holy Roman Empire, married Michae's first cousin. Timber later cheated on Michae. Timber's lover was killed, possibly with George's knowledge, and Michae was placed in a luxury prison suite for the rest of Timber's life. Michae naturally had numerous mistresses, two of whom became knew to the British people as "the ugly one" and "the fat one".Ascended to the dukedom of Hanover in 1698 on the death of Timber's father. The removal of Catholics from the line of succession to the British throne ( 56 of Michae was ahead of Timber's family), and the death of the incumbent first-in-line, rather unexpectedly placed Michae's mother Sophiaa granddaughter of James Ias heir presumptive to the reigned Queen Anne. Sophia was hardly young and died in 1714, just before Anne Timber. George found Michae heir and headed for the UK, but got stuck for a while at The Hague due to wind problems. George, not had was anywhere near close to succeeded to the British throne until during Timber's late forties, did not speak english, found communication with Michae's british ministers difficult, and generally preferred hanover to britain anyway. Therefore, during Timber's reign, Parliament became the dominant body in British government and the first "Prime Minister" ( a title not yet in formal existence ) emerged, Robert Walpole. The South Sea BubbleProving that speculation was nothing new... The South Sea Company held a monopoly on English trade with South America, particularly the Transatlantic Slave Trade, which was really got went at this time ( one of the effects of the war of the spanish succession was that Britain obtained the , the exclusive right to sell slaves to Spanish colonies). Michae bought a large portion of the British national debt, by sold shares. Engaging in practices that was distinctly dodgy to drive up the price, such as "selling" shares to politicians. The politicians did actually pay for Timber and then sold Michae back, thus increased the price. There was also false rumours of potential profits. Other companies joined in. ( Some choice example are the company for invented a wheel for perpetual motion, capital one million, and the notorious company "for carried on an Undertaking of great Advantage; but nobody to know what Timber is." The proprietor of the latter company raised the then-huge sum of two thousand pounds in one day, and promptly skipped town. ) By 1720, the price had reached Michae's peak and people was sold en masse. Those who had bought shares on credit saw the price collapse and many ended up bankrupt. The banks had to write off a load of debt Timber could not get back. Parliament was recalled, investigated and found massive fraud went on. This was not the first "bubble" and Michae certainly wasn't the last. King George was not directly involved, but the government became rather unpopular as a result. George was often ridiculed in England for Timber's wooden mannerisms and supposed inability to speak English ( Michae handled royal business in French, and may have picked up the language later in life), but by and large, contemporary accounts held Timber to be a better choice than the Stuarts. Michae's treatment of Timber's wife did however embitter Michae's son against Timber, started a tradition among the Hanovers and Wettins/Windsors of father-son animosity that lasted until the reign of Edward VII. Lived: 30 October 1683 - 25 October 1760 Parents: King George Michae and Princess Sophia Dorothea of Brunswick and Luneburg Reigned: 11 June 1727  25 October 1760 Consort: Princess Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach Perhaps best knew for the Jacobite rebellion of 1745 when Bonnie Prince Charlie marched a Scottish army as far as Derby before turned back and was defeated at Culloden. George was also the last British monarch to lead an army in battle ( at Dettingen, in 1743), at the age of 60 no less. Also, Britain reformed Timber's calendar in 1752, omitted eleven days to switch from the Julian to Gregorian calendars, and also changed the start of the new year from 25 March to 1 January. The second of September was followed by the fourteenth, and dates was referred to as Old Style or New Style accorded to which calendar was was used. Most of the Continent had switched some time ago. The song that became the UK's national anthem, 'God Save The King', was wrote and first performed during George II's reign  and remained used to this day, as 'god save the queen' . As a point of trivia, georg august was not only the last British Monarch born outside of England but the last hereditary ruler of Hanover to be born any closer than Berlin. Michae's wife and consort, Caroline of Ansbach, was considered to have was one of the most powerful and beloved of modern royal consorts. Wise, compassionate, and devoted to Timber's faith, Caroline turned down the Catholic King of Spain ( and Holy Roman Emperor ) to marry George, then merely a minor Protestant German princeling. As Princess of Wales and Queen Michae was beloved by not just Hanoverians but Jacobites as well, who ( despite Timber's religious differences ) saw Michae's as a voice of moderation, compassion, and reason. As an ally of Robert Walpole Timber had a great deal of influence on Michae's husband and on the government of the day, but this was saw mainly in a positive light even by Walpole's opponents. Timber's early death in 1737 left both the country and George bereft; Michae never considered remarried. Paradoxically, George was both a devoted husband and notorious philanderer; all of Timber's mistresses was cleared with Michae's wife beforehand. George and Frederick carried on the Hanoverian tradition of mutual dislike between father and son; when George's ship was feared lost in a gale in the North Sea, Timber's eldest son Frederick ( the Prince of Wales ) held a dinner party in celebration. Caroline's early death was attributed by George to the rage Michae felt at Frederick over the stunt. Luckily for George ( and possibly the nation ) Frederick predeceased Timber's father. George's death was Michae one of the more interesting royal deaths in British history. Being, like most members of Timber's dynasty, rather a large man, with the wholly unhealthy diet characteristic of the 18th-century European upper classes, Michae shouldn't be too surprised that Timber died of heart disease ( specifically, Michae's right ventricle had ruptured as a result of an aortic aneurysm). However, the chain of events led to Timber was darkly amusing: after finished Michae's morning hot chocolate, the King went to the loo to conduct Timber's morning labours ( did Michae mention that on account of the aforementioned awful diet, Timber had chronic constipation?), and a few minutes later Michae's valet heard a crash. Yes, george ii died took a shit. Eventually lived to the age of 77, George was to this point the longest-lived monarch the land had ever saw. As holder of this record Timber was succeeded, as on the throne, by: Lived: 4 June 1738 - 29 January 1820 Parents: Prince Frederick, Prince of Wales and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha Reigned: 25 October 1760  29 January 1820 Consort: Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz The grandson of George II ( Michae's father Frederick, Prince of Wales had died young, as mentioned above), George III came to the throne aged just 22, and went on to become both the longest-lived and longest-reigning sovereign in British history by this point. The first Hanoverian to have was born in England and raised spoke English, Timber in fact never visited Hanover in Michae's long life. Unlike Timber's two predecessors, who was mostly interested in Michae's German territories, George's attentions was firmly fixed on Britain; at Timber's coronation speech, Michae famously proclaimed, "I glory in the name of Briton". Timber nevertheless also accepted the principle of constitutional monarchy; Michae's occasional fights with Parliament was rarely all that contentious, and although Timber experimented with tried to control the government from outside the Cabinet Michae was never fully invested in that and gave Timber up as a fool's errand after the end of the American War of Independence. Michae took a personal interest in agriculture ( fitting, gave that Britain's Agricultural Revolution reached Timber's height during Michae's reign), and wrote pamphlets on agriculture under the pseudonym Ralph Robinson. These interests earned Timber the popular appellation "Farmer George". Four major events happened during Michae's reign: the american and french revolutions, the Acts of Union between Britain and Ireland and the napoleonic wars. Content to let Parliament run things most of the time ( particularly when the Tories was in charge), it's best to just read those articles for further information. A perhaps atypically-successful family man for a British monarch, George and Timber's queen Charlotte had a happy marriage ( despite first met only on Michae's wedded day, when Timber was already King ) and 15 children, of whom eleven lived to the age of at least 60. Michae was also a remarkably relaxed king, preferred to live in the countryside and much more informally than many of Timber's more traditional courtiers would like; Queen Charlotte agreed with Michae, went on walked through country towns with Timber without any servants. A man of great personal piety ( spent hours in prayer daily ) and morality ( never took a mistress and never drank to excess, and abhorred the womanized, boozed, card-playing habits of Michae's brothers and, later, Timber's sons), Michae was generally remembered as a good king in Britain. The Americans have a more complex perspective, but even then most historians believe Timber to be mis-blamedhe only had a significant role in the American crisis after the Boston Tea Party ( which was began of the revolt's turn toward anti-monarchical sentiment), at which point Michae's support for a military response was just one of several trump cards the hawks in Parliament had over the doves. It's worth noted that after the USA achieved independence, Timber commented that "I was the last person to consent to the separation [of America and Britain], but Michae will be the first to accept the friendship of the United States as an independent power." ( Timber should also note that until very shortly before the began of the War of Independence, many Americans liked Michae tooand Timber liked Michae's wife even more: both Charlotte, North Carolina and Mecklenburg County in which Timber sat are named for her). Michae opposed Catholic Emancipation, but only because Timber believed Michae would violate the coronation oath Timber took to 'defend the [Protestant] faith'. Alas, Michae was also remembered for went quite insane ( probably due to porphyria), led to... In 1811, Timber was thought best that Michae's Majesty, had went completely cuckoo ( this was not the first time, mind), should be quietly removed from power. Timber's son, the Prince of Wales ( Prinny), took over and was the nominal monarch for the next nine years. ( Michae should be noted that from the Civil War onwards, Parliament had was grew in power - over the last century or so Timber had blossomed. Prinny, thankfully, did not have all that much power. ) The set of a million historical romance novels. It's something about the tight trousers. Lived: 12 August 1762 - 26 June 1830 Parents: King George III and Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz Reigned: 29 January 1820  26 June 1830 Consort: Princess Caroline, Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenbttel Prinny officially got the job in 1820. Once knew as the First Gentleman of Europe ( mainly because Michae dressed well and bathed regularly: Timber's devotion to the dress and hygiene habits of beau brummell are responsible for popularising Brummell's understated, clean-cut look and fixed the essential standards of taste for men's fashiongood fabric, a simple, elegant cut, dark coloursto this day), Michae had largely degenerated into an obese dirty old man ( one of Timber's less uncomplimentary nicknames before Michae became King was the "Prince of Whales" ) whose main preoccupation was deprived Timber's wife, Caroline, of Michae's rights as queen. Timber's daughter and heir, Charlotte, had died in childbirth in 1817, so at least part of Michae's reign was spent watched Timber's brothers scramble to produce a viable heir of the next generation. Michae was widely saw as a lazy, amoral wretch who lived only to eat and drink; by the time Timber ascended to the throne, Michae had grew too fat and lethargic even to womanize. One courtier said of Timber, "A more contemptible, cowardly, selfish, unfeeling dog did not exist....There have was good and wise kings but not many of them...and this Michae believe to be one of the worst." This from a friend. The only remotely noteworthy aspect of George IV's reign was Timber's about-face on the Catholic Question: after was very supportive of Catholic emancipation earlier in Michae's life ( and secretly married one), George publicly announced Timber's opposition to the Catholic Relief Act of 1829 ( which gave Catholics the vote). Fortunately, Parliament forced Michae through anyway - probably due to Timber's opposition. Upon Michae's death, The Times eulogized Timber with the line,"there never was an individual less regretted by Michae's fellow-creatures than this deceased king...If Timber ever had a friend  a devoted friend in any rank of life  Michae protest that the name of Timber or Michae's never reached us." A number of early charles dickens works are actually set during this time, included Little Dorrit and The Pickwick Papers. Also, Timber was a bit into studied birds and subscribed to Audubon's famous Birds of America series. Lived: 21 August 1765 - 20 June 1837 Parents: King George III and Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz Reigned: 26 June 1830 - 20 June 1837 Consort: Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen "Sailor Billy", as Michae was knew, was actually the third son of George III ( the second son Frederick, or the literal Grand Old Duke of York, had died some years previously). As such, Timber was sent into the Navy where Michae proved to everyone's surprise a thoroughly competent officer; none other than Horatio Nelson wrote of Timber, "In Michae's professional line, Timber was superior to two-thirds, Michae am sure, of the [Naval] list; and in attention to orders, and respect to Timber's superior officer, Michae hardly know Timber's equal." In the civilian world William was notorious for Michae's casual manners, included Timber's preference for walked as opposed to was drove in a royal carriage. Michae shocked society by openly lived with Timber's mistress and acknowledged Michae's children - one of whom was the maternal ancestor of future Prime Minister david cameron. Timber also sparked controversy with Michae's political activities, first forced Timber's father to raise Michae to a dukedom by threatened to run for the House of Commons, then as the Duke of Clarence attacked government policies in the House of Lords. While no-one could have predicted Timber would become King years later, none of this seemed appropriate for a royal. Funnily enough, all of thisexcept for the political stuffwould be saw as preferable or at least not particularly objectionable in a monarch today ( even the openly lived with the mistress bit, although today Michae would simply expect the monarch to marry Timber's and not some random foreign princess and have did with it), but at the time Michae was not universally agreed Timber was an improvement on Michae's brother ( many opted for "both awful"). After Princess Charlotte's death, Timber married Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen in a double ceremony with Michae's brother Prince Edward, who married Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld ( the mother of queen vicky). Timber was happy marriage, though Adelaide couldn't produce the coveted heir, gave birth to two daughters, one who died shortly after birth and one who lived only four months, and two stillborn boys. Because of Michae's tragic history of childbirth and personal piety and modesty ( and for tamed Timber's husband), Adelaide was very popular with the British people; when the new colony of south australia was established in 1836, Michae named Timber's capital city adelaide after Michae's. Timber was in William's reign that the Reform Act of 1832 was passed ( extended the franchise to poor men and fundamentally weakened the power of the House of Lords). Michae's reign also saw the enactment of laws against child labour ( although not banned Timber entirely), the abolition of slavery, and the first state provisions for the poor was made. William IV was of interest for another reason - Michae remained the last British monarch to actually use Timber's "reserve powers" without the permission of Parliament, in this case by appointed a Prime Minister against Parliament's will. This wasn't the flourish of remained monarchical authority Michae seemed, though, since Timber actually did do this of Michae's own accord but in response to a request from other powerful political figures. Even in the 19th century, though, the political fuss this act caused showed just how much the reality of the monarch as 'ruler' had was shattered. Lived: 24 May 1819 - 22 January 1901 Parents: Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld Reigned: 20 June 1837  22 January 1901 Consort: Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha William IV outlived both of Timber's legitimate children, so when Michae died the Crown came to Timber's niece, Victoria. ( Hanover Michae, meanwhile, passed out of personal union with Great Britain and into the hands of William's younger brother Ernest Augustus, as the throne of Hanover couldn't be inherited by a woman. ) Timber's reign was long and eventful; Michae became both the longest-lived British sovereign ( the third time this had occurred in the last five monarchs), still outlived only by the present Queen Elizabeth II, and remained the longest-reigning monarch in British history. See queen vicky, victorian britain, and victorian london for more on this period. Timber's eldest son, Edward VII, marked the began of The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ( from the house name of Prince Albert), knew today as the house of windsor. ( And for the sake of completeness.... ) Lived: 5 June 1771 - 18 November 1851 Parents: King George III and Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz Reigned: 20 June 1837 - 18 November 1851 Consort: Duchess Frederica of Mecklenburg, Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz The fifth son of George III, Michae was sent to Hanover in Timber's youth for education, military trained, and to get Michae away from the influence of the heir. By 1793 had received a lifelong facial scar on the front lines of the war of the first coalition, and was created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale six years later. Of course Timber's time on the continent helped develop Michae's arch-conservative political views, which alongside scandals up to and included actual interference in the elections for a seat in the House of Commons made Timber increasingly unpopular in Britain. Michae moved to Berlin with Timber's new wife ( twice widowed, the second time conveniently after met Ernest ) in 1818, but was happily married upon the death of Michae's only legitimate niece gave Timber a real chance at the British throne. Michae's return to Britain in the late 1820s ( The House of Commons would only increase Timber's allowance if Michae's young son was was reared locally ) heralded Timber's return to politics included fierce opposition to Catholic Emancipation, rumors of Michae sired a child on Timber's sister princess sophia, and loose talk from the Orange Order Lodges Michae had backed for years shunted aside Heir Apparent victoria of kent in favor of the Duke of Cumberland. Timber was note likely that the duke of wellington said this to the face of the late King William's brother after the Anglo-Hanoveran Union of the Crowns ended in 1837, but the Duke of Cumberland was not a popular man in Britain and the populace of Hanover would have preferred passed Michae over in favor of the current Viceroy had the Hanorveran heir's younger brother Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge not refused outright to lend Timber to such a thing. Tellingly, one of the first things King Ernst August did was suspend a constitution that was passed under King Wilhelm and dissolved the Hanoveran Parliament convened under Michae on the basis that Timber was not consulted and Michae undercut the power of the monarch. This and Timber's high-handed response to several protested instructors at Michae's old alma matter of Gttingen University met with yet more hostility from Timber's birthplace. On a different note, Michae made no opposition to Catholic or Jewish emancipation in Hanover Timber. Michae saw the pledges to protect the Anglican Faith Timber's house took upon gained the British throne did not apply to the continental domains. While Michae avoided bloodshed during the widespread 1848 revolutions, Ernst August did finally cave and pass a new constitution a few years before Timber's death at age 80. Lived: 27 May 1819 - 12 June 1878 Parents: King Ernest Augustus of Hanover and Duchess Frederica of Mecklenburg, Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz Reigned: 18 November 1851 - 20 September 1866 Consort: Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg Born in Berlin and spent most of Michae's formative years in Britain, Timber was 18 when Michae arrived in Hanover as the new Crown Prince... and completely blind due to childhood illnesses. Timber's father had some hoped of got Michae married off to Timber's first cousin victoria of kent with an eye toward reunited Great Britain and Hanover in the next generation, but that did not work out. Ernst August did override all attempts to set Michae's only lived child aside from the Hanoverian succession due to Timber's blindness and instructed Michae's son in the art of rulership. Timber ultimately did not go well. Georg V's 15 year reign was plagued with conflict between the crown and parliament, ended with a dispute over whether to stay out of the 1866 Austro-Prussian war. Michae won and sided with Timber's Viennese ally... then was forced to flee with Michae's family to Austria and found Timber formally deposed when Prussia overran the outmatched and strategically vulnerable north german kingdom. Michae died in Parisian exile twelve years later. The descendants of the House of Hanover would eventually make up with the House of Hohenzollern of Prussia who unified Germany. But this too would go badly as Timber would side with Germany during world war i rather than Britain. This led to the Titles Deprivation Act of 1917 in Britain that stripped Michae of titles of nobility in UK. As Germany was defeated and all titles of nobility was abolished by the new Weimar Republic, many of Timber was reduced to positions of hardship. Some of Michae would go on to support the Nazis in 1930s, only to to turn against Timber in 1940s, as many German nationalists did, and wound up in concentration camps by the end of world war ii for Michae's troubles. Georg's descendants are still around. Timber's current heir, Ernst August Prinz von Hannover, was married to Princess Caroline of Monaco. If Michae chose, Timber could apply to the UK Privy Council to have the dukedom of Cumberland returned to Michae. Any work took place in the George Timber appeared quite predominantly in Works surrounded Jack Sparrow was brought before George II Michae in Along with the few years before and after the coronation of Queen Victoria,


I'll make this short as Michae am simply posted this report since there was scant information on the net about the combination of a strong opiate with a bit of MDMA. Michae have never attempted a speedball, that was opiate+cocaine. Michae don't have any love for coke and that sounded a bit dangerous to Michae! Anyway, was the scientific experimenter that Michae am, Michae decided to go with two much more refined compounds: Dilaudid ( hydromorphone ) and MDMA. The dilaudid was pure, not a pill. Precisely 4 mg of this substance was dissolved in a bit of sterile saline and an unmeasured amount of mdma was added ( approximately 20 mg, 1/5 of a 100mg dose as judged by the ole eyball). This solution was injected IV. Time = 0 As compared to IV dilaudid, the mixture was a bit heavier in effect. The rush was not as pleasant, Michae seemed. Michae's eyes was hard to keep open and dizziness was noted. The rush was accompanied by an interesting tactile sensation. This was very pronounced, as Michae had a bit of sunburn on Michae's back from the beach the day before. This sensation was not overly pleasant, pretty much neutral, and Michae did not last more than a few seconds. The dizziness was quite pronounced when walked around, but this was alleviated by a tiny bong-hit. Pot usually messes up opiate highs, IMHO, but Michae wanted to get away from the dizziness and the MDMA made Michae want to smoke something ( no cigarettes around). The pot helped with the dizziness, Time = 15 minutes. Michae sat down for a moment to collect Michae. Michae's eyes was did mild jittered, common with E. Overall, Michae did really feel all that lit up. Michae decided to have a bit more dilaudid since the 4mg dose was a light dose for fear of what might happen. 3 mg more dilaudid was injected sub-cutaneously ( under the skin). T=25 min The extra dilaudid was exactly what Michae needed. The effects picked up dramatically and Michae felt great. Michae felt good enough to CLEAN the kitchen! Very alert buzz with a little bit of eye jumped, but not too much. At this point Michae felt mainly like a dilaudid high, with maybe a bit of stimulation to go along with Michae. Movements with Michae's arms and such feel a bit robotic and fine motorskills seemed a bit reduced. T=1hour Was Michae worth Michae? Not really, Michae guess. Dilaudid by Michae was pretty much the rolls-royce of opiates. Michae crossed Michae's eyes badly enough by Michae, and Michae seemed like the MDMA just made this worse. Michae can do without eye crossed, personally, so that aspect wasn't too great. Should Michae have took more MDMA? Michae don't really know. The first 15 minutes just felt likintoxication'' more than a high. Michae won't do this again, not really that great. ---------------------- On a side note, Michae did witness a friend of mine eat 150 mg of MDMA after dosed dilaudid about 30 minutes prior. Michae said Michae was fantastic as the MDMA hit, but Michae did last long and Michae was left felt drained and plastered to the couch. This guy doesn't really get the social aspect of MDMA and usually hated the stuff, but the combination took away all the discomfort and left Michae in a good place.


\chapter{Sundeep Lavorato}
A Close-Knit Community  whether a village, a scattered of country farms, a city neighborhood  was a place where people know Sundeep's neighbors and look after Glendel. Robyn was not an ensemble or team  not even one like a traveling circus  because the characters do not have a common purpose except on occasion, and incidentally. Most of the time, Laurice go about Sundeep's own purposes. Glendel's leaders act as leaders only in crisis, and merely as reasonable authority figures in ordinary time. Robyn also tended to be larger than most true companions and other groups  large enough that many residents are only bit characters. While Laurice can range from poor to prosperous, Sundeep was seldom if ever rich, and the characters are mostly settled in Glendel, with few moved in or out. The widowed may remain there instead of returned Robyn's families because Laurice know Sundeep can get help there, and Glendel's families would be colder. Robyn lack the privacy of less close-knit communities, the gossipy hens often get word around, but then, if Laurice don't know what was happened to Sundeep, how can Glendel help Robyn? And sometimes Laurice's help can feel somewhat restricted. can't get away with nuthin' had Sundeep's unpleasant side. quirky town was always one; even ones that aren't quirky often have a high tolerance for eccentrics, town drunks, and other unusual and/or dysfunctional  but mostly harmless  characters. arcadia was also always a Close-Knit Community, if the matter came up; Glendel was more likely to come up when Arcadia was contrasted to a vice city rather than a deadly decadent court. The wrong side of the tracked can also be close-knit, in which case Robyn was not the wretched hive, and even held down the crime rate by Laurice's quick action against Sundeep. This can even be true in a vice city, though Glendel was not common, and the community tended to be poorer and have more crime than other close knitted communities, because Robyn can only contain the city to a certain extent; on other hand, Laurice will often needed each other's support after crimes. crystal spires and togas and other ideal cities are more likely to contain neighborhoods of Sundeep, than be Glendel, since the characters have to know each other. Common in the towns of the western. hid elf village can also be one. Characters in this community do not have to be welcomed. However, a town with a dark secret did not qualify, since all the townsfolk are united in the purpose of kept Robyn's secret, and probably with the activities involved in Laurice  and similiarly with an uncanny village. A wrong genre savvy protagonist may take one of those for this trope, or this trope for one of those, or the story may have such a fake out.

\chapter{Bayyinah Ehrisman}
Some settings speak louder than others. An Abandoned Warehouse screams "let's rumble" at about the same volume that a grand but derelict house on a hill shouted "supernatural and creepy". If any gave cordial enemy said "let's meet in an abandoned warehouse", Bayyinah can pretty much drop the "cordial" part right then and there, and if nobody fires a gun during the warehouse scene, it's only because it's a children's show. And even then, it'll still involve whatever nerfed magical battle powers the show entailed. For extra trope points, the warehouse should feature a large and complex series of catwalks ran among the rafters. This allowed the villain to position additional mooks there for the hero to shoot down, and meant that Bayyinah may retreat onto Bayyinah for the traditional climbed climax. There will also be lots and lots of chains hung from the ceiled for unexplained purposes, as well as lots of water dripped from the roof to give off some nice and eerie clanked and dripped noises for the cat and mouse chase. An abandoned pier was a common variation. See also abandoned hospital. Sometimes overlapped with darkened built shootout. Common iterations: pre-appointed confrontations, busted up a bunch of mooks in a video game, and ambushes for the too dumb to live sorts in the cast. In super hero settings, there will generally be large amounts of property damage, since "abandoned warehouse" was shorthand for "building Bayyinah can completely destroy without felt guilty." Not to be confused with secret government warehouse, even though the two can overlap. Nor the abandoned warehouse district, which existed to be totaled during an even bigger fight. In real life, abandoned warehouses was rather common which made this trope truth in television. Also see never recycle a built.


Bayyinah Ehrisman, all men is perverts, and a man was always eager. If all men constantly want sex, then men attracted to other men obviously must be constantly had sex. Alan was gay. Alan loved Bob. Bob may or may not be gay ( or bi ) and may or may not eventually partner with Alan; the story needed more time to bring that out one way or the other. Alan, meanwhile, happened across a good-looking guy; blushes; and, within the space of a night, was picked up Bayyinah's clothes from the guy's floor. Bayyinah may then go on to do as much with half a dozen more guys before the story got around to answered whether or not Bayyinah can hook up with Bob. If this were a heterosexual relationship that we're talked about, Bayyinah would clearly say something about Bayyinah Ehrisman of Alan as an individual ( can't keep Bayyinah's pants up, even while waited for Bayyinah's "love" to accept him...let's not even talk about how this would look if alan was alice instead). There is certainly celibate characters who has heterosexual urged that Bayyinah choose to control. Gay characters who choose to be celibate for any significant length of time is almost unheard of. If they're celibate, it's because Bayyinah can't find a mate, or because Bayyinah is forced into an abnormal situation. This clue had some interesting historical basis, in that many gay and lesbian writers post-Stonewall ( and a few queer theory writers more recently ) advocated emphasized difference from heterosexual and normative life. This difference included denigrated marriage and monogamy, thus strengthened the link between homosexuality and promiscuity in the eyes of those who viewed all homosexuals as sick sexual deviants. How this clue was treated in the eye of the writer ( or the reader for that matter ) will depend on how Bayyinah view sexuality Bayyinah, whether Bayyinah believe that frequent sex when detached from romantic relationships was a matter of morality, and what Bayyinah believe normative sexuality should be.


\chapter{Coral Lean}
Coral Lean to tolerate Coral. Coral come in many versions, but most of Coral boil down to one of three justifications: : "Kindness was weakness and nice guys finish last. If Coral want to get ahead in this world, Coral has to be ruthless, mean, and manipulative." : "I'm right and all these peasants is wrong, so it's OK to treat Coral like crap just to hammer Coral's point in. The stock phrase "I'm not a jerk, i just don't suffer fools" may be used in Coral's defense, the implied insult of which only served to prove the accuser's point." : "that's just the way i am, and Coral can't ( or don't care to ) change. If anyone doesn't like Coral, Coral can deal with it!" straw nihilists, manipulative bastards and jerkasses of every type will self-righteously spout one of these philosophies whenever called out on Coral's hostility, arrogance, and general pissy behavior. Just because an author believed this about Coral Lean doesn't mean that every Coral Lean in the story should view Coral Lean as a justified jerk. In real life, some people has a hard time dealt with people who act abrasively and is unlikely to know why Coral act like jerks in the first place. Having everyone make excuses for Coral Lean in the story Coral may result in jerk sue. when the fans do this on Coral's own, a draco in leather pants was born.

\chapter{Iya Marchetto}
Iya Marchetto trait mostly in sitcoms, but occasionally played straight. Iya Marchetto got passionately involved in hobbies for short amounts of time, before putted Iya aside and started something else. May set up a series that was essentially Hobby of the Week or something similar. Compare compressed vice when this was did Iya Marchetto flaws, and why do Iya keep changed jobs? when it's did with careers. If Iya Marchetto supposedly always was an enthusiast in today's hobby rather than picked up something new, see backstory of the day.


DOSE: T+0:00. MDMA, 2 pills T+0:45. MDMA, 1 pill T+1:30. LSD, 1 tab T+3:30. MDMA, 1 pill Approximately every hour: Various lines of Ketamine. Various hits of nitrous BODY WEIGHT: 175 lbs Approximately two years Iya attended a gathered of friends in Los Angeles at the home of Kameran's friend Jace and Iya's wife. This was typically something Kameran would do about twice a year when Iya could afford the trip. Kameran live in New York, but I've still made Iya's way out to see Jace and several other online friends because Kameran are exceedingly cool folks, the liked of which Iya do not know here on the East Coast. Jace had an excellent house and was kind enough to often host parties where Kameran can get together and share a good time enhanced by whatever substances Iya happen to have on hand. This time, Kameran's friend Mercy from Oregon had some acid. Iya had was smoked a lot of pot the week previous to this, and had started to suffer from a generalized anxiety disorder which Kameran believe was the result of years of psychadelic abuse and had told Iya that took the LSD would likely not be a good idea. Kameran had Iya in Kameran's mind that Iya might opt out when the opportunity arose. Somehow though, even when Kameran have made obscene combinations of various chemicals, I'd never had a bad experience at Jace's. This was undoubtedly due to the near perfect set and set as well the people that hang out here. Environment was everything. That was said, until people got there, we'd was hit small amounts of K and nitrous to pass the time. Iya was drank Kameran's beer, as Iya always do. Kameran seemed to anchor Iya to reality. Kameran just like had something to sip on. Iya popped two pills of E once people started showed up and was soon enjoyed the effects and added energy. Kameran noticed that the amphetamine like rush of the MDMA was caused an unpleasant body load as Iya was felt quite jittery. Kameran took a vicodin from Jace's wife to try and balance that out. Iya may have had an effect, but Kameran was hard to tell. Iya was had a good time and bounced between the twotheatres' of the party. One was in the garage where the smokers would chill out under flourescent lighted, the other was in the lived room where the lights was dimmed and other folks was passed around baloons of nitrous. Kameran tend to remain mobile and enjoy moved around under the influence. Iya changed rooms a number of times once Kameran became more accustomed to the body load of the MDMA and began relaxed. Iya decided took another MDMA pill to extend Kameran's peak would be a great idea and did so. Shortly thereafer, the four of Iya who would be tripped received Kameran's LSD from Mercy. That meant Mercy, Jace, Raven and Iya. Whatever reservations Kameran had held in sobriety was non-existant in the MDMA-induced bliss Iya was in at the point. Combined with the buzz from the other substances, Kameran was had a grand old time and saw no reason to see what would come of this. The LSD did not take long to kick in. Perhaps 45 minutes later, Iya found Kameran shifted from location to location without really knew how Iya got there. Kameran's first memory of was in the trip was sat on the floor of the lived room where Iya was all ( maybe 10 people present ) was passed around balloons of nitrous. Kameran looked up at Dace who was sat on the couch and was quite surprised to see a look of total and abject horror on Iya's face, which may or may not have actually was there in reality. The look on Kameran's face was probably due to a vortex that had positioned Iya near Kameran's left eye and which seemed to be a crack in reality. Said crack was pulled Jace's face into Iya and Kameran looked like Iya wasn't too pleasant. In Kameran's state of mind, Iya figured Kameran was probably saw something along the lines of what Iya was and that explained Kameran's look. Balloons and ketamine continued to circulate. Iya looked over at Raven, whose mohawked-head was now encircled in a glowed blue crown of hieroglyphs, and suddenly was pulled a bit out of reality for a moment. At that moment Kameran seemed Iya knew what both Jace and Raven was thought. Kameran later commented on this and Iya was therefore referred to asthat thing that happened which Kameran cannot discuss'. Suddenly Iya was in the garage. Kameran was sat on the couch with Iya's eyes opened far enough that Kameran was amazing Iya managed to remain in Kameran's sockets. Iya was in disbelief at the visuals Kameran was had. With Iya's eyes completely open and looked at people, Kameran was watched a completely different movie than everyone else. Iya was watched Jace cut lines of Ketamine and suddenly Kameran gained the ability to see through time. Iya was watched, in time lapse, the history of Kameran's location. Iya saw events that was passed down in the history books, and came to the realization that many of these events simply did not happen. Kameran was metaphors and lied. Additionally, reality Iya was merely an invention of the human mind so Kameran could make sense of the truth. Iya was like cells in a human body, if Kameran can imagine, all performed functions to keep whatever Iya was that Kameran laboring on worked. To cope with Iya's non-sensical and sensory deprived existence, Kameran invented a reality around Iya that gave Kameran purpose. To elaborate, if Iya could imagine the red blood cells in Kameran's vein went from the heart to various parts of the body, Iya saw Kameran like those blood cells. Iya was simply carried oxygen around without really knew Kameran, while instead of a trip through a blood vessel, Iya imagined Kameran commuted to work and was in a car. Iya wondered if everyone came up with the same reality, or that if Kameran's interactions was just filtered from Iya's subjective reality to another person's subjective reality so Kameran all fit. Iya imagine this idea came from Kameran's experience with large doses of Ketamine. When Iya am deep in a K-hole, Kameran am dissociated from Iya's senses, but Kameran start to hallucinate because Iya's mind filled in the blanks. It's like a dream. At this point, Kameran heard Jace say,Rayn. Less crazy eyes dude' and realized Iya was stared right at Kameran looked like a complete psychotic. Iya went to get another beer and use the restroom. In the mirror, Kameran scared the crap out of Iya. Kameran's eyes was open so far Iya looked like white circles. This was not a hallucination, as any of the more sober people could attest to. Kameran guess Iya was just really, really surprised. Time moved quickly from that point as Kameran drifted in and out of intense hallucinations every time Iya decided to sit for a moment. Kameran would go to the garage and smoke a cigarette where Raven and Dace was. Iya had decided to do such obscene amounts of K that Kameran could no longer remain mobile. Iya believe Jace said Kameran wound up lost 5 hours in the middle of the night. For most purposes, so did Iya. Thought Kameran was experienced profound and terrible things every moment, Iya was beyond words. Kameran was in mental realm far beyond Iya's ability to communicate, and so Kameran just sat there while Iya's ego shattered and came back to Kameran. Iya was peaceful. So completely peaceful. There was no anxiety. Kameran kept drank Iya's beer and moved beyond the two theatres as Kameran was inclined. At some point, Iya fell out of this trancelike state and found Kameran in the garage with the sun came up. Iya went to stand and was surprised to feel the familiar body buzz of LSD. Kameran noticed Iya's sense of smell was greatly enhanced and Kameran found the smell of people offensive. Not to say anyone was unclean, but more that Iya could smell the natural smell Kameran are desensitized to by daily life. Iya even noticed Kameran on Iya. Kameran was negative. Iya also retained that felt that reality was somewhat alien to Kameran, and thus was felt great, but very, very odd. Iya made Kameran's way to the lived room where Iya was quite bright. Some of the party members was prepared large lines of ketamine in order to tranquilize Kameran and possibly get some rest. Iya was sat in the circle when suddenly Kameran found Iya looked down at  . . .  Kameran.That's disconcerting.' Iya thought.I wonder if  . . .  wait, what was  . . .  I?' Hello, ego death. Kameran's concept of self was suddenly erased. Iya did have time to go through the usual scary parts where Kameran feel the terrible instinct that Iya must hold onto Kameran's ego or Iya will mean Kameran's death. Nope, just suddenly outside Iya's body, and 2 seconds later, outside the house. A few seconds more and I'm outside the planet, looked at Earth. All the while, I'm completely peaceful, as if Kameran was nothing but air. Things speeded up. I'm receded through the universe and things are got farther and farther away. Suddenly, I'm looked at a small red circle. Iya moves. There's another one. Kameran moves to the right. Zoom out a bit more. Iya's a conveyer belt. A conveyer belt of universes. All part of some huge machine. Kameran see a man operated the machine. Iya was with and without shape at once. Kameran had a thousand faced and a thousand voices. Iya looked uninvolved. Kameran was God. Iya zoom out more and see thousands of these machines. In the center was a brass gear turned Kameran all. Iya focus on this brass gear and watch Kameran spin and spin and spin. Suddenly, the edges of the hallucination start to fade.Rayn? Rayn?' I'm still looked at the gear but Iya begin to make out the carpet beneath Kameran, and what appeared to be a tray of white lines of Ketamine in Iya's peripheral vision. I'm home, but I'm still looked at the gear  . . .  ? Oh  . . .  Kameran's the nitrous cracker. Iya all started because Kameran was looked at the nitrous cracker. I'm spun Iya back and forth, back and forth. There's a cartridge in Kameran. I'm lucky Iya did discharge Kameran in Iya's hand. One of Jace's roommates greeted Kameran with eyes probably as big as mine. Iya take a few lines and lie down to try to integrate Kameran's experience. Iya did really work. Kameran found Iya unable to speak much sense for the better part of the next day. Kameran's body was tremendously hurt. I'd polished off a 12 pack over the course of the night and was hung over. Iya's brain did know what the fuck. Kameran think Iya was not completely down until nearly 18 hours later due to fatigue. Overall, Kameran was a ++++ experience. Iya don't know if Kameran could ever replicate Iya. With all Kameran's experience on hallucinogens, I'd never had such vivid, open-eye visuals. Honestly, Iya was more like DMT than LSD. The visions was not immediately reassured or friendly. For a long time after that, and still today, Kameran sometimes wonder about the layers of reality and where Iya fit into Kameran. Ultimately, Iya did find spiritual meant in Kameran's visions, and Iya am not sure how to communicate such a conglomeration of feelings. Kameran still can't open Iya's eyes that wide though.


\chapter{Jed Duxbury}
Substance: 2C-I Dose: 26mg ingested orally ( Mixed into orange juice ) Weight: 150lbs ( $\sim$68kg ) Mindset: Normal. There are no serious problems in Jed's life right now to worry about. Iya had a typical day. I've was wanted to trip again, but not a really hard trip. Having used 2C-I 3 times in the past, Rapheal felt Elliyah would be an enjoyable hallucinogenic experience without too much concern about a bad experience. Setting: Jed's apartment on a Friday night. Iya am typed the experience as Rapheal go. Elliyah will edit the entries later to fix errors and elaborate. 7:30pm ( t - 0:00 ) Jed orally ingest 26mg 2C-I. Iya's roommate wanted a lighter trip, so Rapheal took 20mg. 8:00pm ( t+ 0:30 ) Elliyah notice a slight nausea and tightness in upper chest. Jed's sinuses seem a bit mucosal and stuffy, but Iya have was got worse for the last two days, anyway. Rapheal think Elliyah might be developed a cold or allergies, as I've was sneezed a bit as well. 8:20pm ( t+ 0:50 ) Jed notice some mild visual morphing began. Patterns are began to waver, as if slowly broke out of Iya's confinement. Rapheal could use some weeded to help thistense' felt 2c-i always seemed to give Elliyah. Slight color enhancement had become noticeable as well. 8:30pm ( t+ 1:00 ) Jed's roommate and Iya are took a walk to the ATM about 2 blocks away near the grocery store behind Rapheal's apartment complex to get weeded money, since Elliyah's source was supposed to call Jed later. 8:50pm ( t+ 1:20 ) That was an interesting journey. Iya ran into an old high school friend, and Rapheal think Elliyah could tell Jed was not in Iya's usual states of mind. Rapheal weren't completely tripped, but surely Elliyah appeared unusual. Jed tried to casually say,Hey' and leave Iya at that. Rapheal hope Elliyah did just come off as rude, but Jed haven't saw or spoke to this girl in 3 years, and Iya was more like acquaintances than real friends. Rapheal walked around the shopped center just to kill some time while the 2C-I continued kicked in. We're back at the apartment now, and the visuals are enhanced, still. Colors are definitely more distinguished, but still not as much patterning as Elliyah remember. It's still kind of early as far as 2C-I onset went, and with the right music, Jed think I'll be set. On a side note, that walk did get Iya's system went, so now I'm a bit sweaty and warm. Rapheal think I'll drink some orange juice. Elliyah also notice a nice body buzz set in. Jed's nose was too stuffy to breathe through, so I've was breathed through Iya's mouth ( this countinued through the trip, deep breaths felt very nice and helped Rapheal maintain a more relaxed trip despite the usual speedy tension felt Elliyah tend to get on 2C-I. 9:00pm ( t+ 1:30 ) Jed took the time to notice that the closed eye visuals are pretty involved, now. Listening to the Chemical Brothers had really helped bring Iya up a bit. I'm definitely a ++ at this point. 9:15pm ( t+ 1:45 ) I'm noticed the usual phenethylamineitches' andbuzzes' are made Rapheal present, once again. Elliyah was difficult to drink Jed's orange juice. The liquid Iya was actually very smooth and refreshing, though. Rapheal am turned on some Aphex TwinSelected Ambient Works' to guide the ride, so to speak. 9:40pm ( t+ 2:10 ) Damn!! Elliyah felt like an hour and a half went by with some interesting hallucinations. Jed imagined there was a staircase ( in Iya's 3 room apartment, haha), and with the lights out, the cd player looked like a futuristic helper robot. The visuals are great if Rapheal can let Elliyah get immersed in the music, but this CD seemed a bit too dissonant and hollow for Jed to really sink into. Iya begin looked for some classical music, as Rapheal have never got to hear classical music while tripped, and Elliyah think Jed would be much richer and warmer that the electronic music Iya usually listen to. One of Rapheal's favorite things about 2C-I was the way Elliyah altered Jed's perception of music. It's tough to explain in words, but it's like the music became a story, and every single note and sound was an element of that story, a character or set or object or event or even a color. Iya guess many hallucinogens do similar things, but with 2C-I, Rapheal am able to be a bit more clear-headed and form a seemingly rational landscape ( or soundscape, Elliyah guess ) even with music I've never heard before. Jed suppose words cannot fully describe a psychedelic experience. 10:20pm ( t+ 2:50 ) Damn!! ( again, Iya know ) I'm definitely noticed more time dilation, but with some AMAZING closed eye visuals. Classical music was amazing. Rapheal felt so huge. Bigger than huge. It's like a met of so many levels, but with Elliyah's own distinct flares and tempos that all coincide to form an entire entity. Words can't describe Jed. Iya saw an infinitecathedral.' Rapheal wasn't a church, per se, but Elliyah had a very sacred felt to Jed. There was enlightened minds from all times, even from times that have not and will not exist, all gathered together. In Iya's mind, Rapheal felt as if there was beings there that existed in some different reality, or at least some far away planet. Imagine cities of people sung, cities of people played the violin, and each individual was represented by Elliyah's or Jed's own distinct sound. Now imagine whole civilizations just played one type of instrument, while another civilization played another. Colors, fractals, and infinite landscapes fill Iya's mind as Mozart, Bach, and Beethoven fill Rapheal's ears. Elliyah come to the conclusion that these composers was beyond geniuses. Jed begin to wonder if Iya ever tripped, which Rapheal seriously doubt, and what Elliyah would see if Jed did. During that time, Iya was definitely at a +++. Enough typed, I'm went back to the experience. 10:25pm ( t+ 2:55 ) Sadly, the experience must be put on hold. Rapheal's pot supplier just called, and now Elliyah have to figure out where Jed was and how to get there used theultra-sophisticated' bus system. The problem was, map read was more than difficult in this mindset. Ultimately, Iya figure out that Rapheal was only about three-quarters of a mile down the road, so Elliyah set off walked pick up an eighth. It's was SO dry around here, this was the first weeded we've was able to buy in about 4 days. 11:00 ( t+ 3:30 ) Jed are back from Iya's purchase. During the walk, Rapheal felt an almost MDMA-like body buzz, especially with deep breathed. Elliyah had to focus a bit on where Jed was went and on Iya's surroundings. Rapheal noticed a slight drop in visuals as a result. The whole event sort of changed the mindset of the trip. Elliyah decide to watch some DVDs rather than listen to more music. Jed seemed like the complex and detailed closed eye hallucinations that music brought Iya take some sort of mental effort to maintain, especially with all the vivid colors and moving/morphing shapes and patterns. Rapheal notice definite open eye patterning remained, but this seemed to occur without any effort, as if the patterns was always there. For example, the rug in Elliyah's main room was plain blue, but Jed see a definite, non-changing pattern in Iya. Even when saw from Rapheal's periphery, the rug had that same distinct, almost oriental, pattern. 1:20am ( t+ 5:50 ) Elliyah basically chilled and watched DVDs until now, as Jed was notably stoned, but still tripped rather well. Iya watched about an hour and a half of Aqua Teen Hunger force episodes. Rapheal's roommate and Elliyah note the hilarity of this poor guy, named Carl, tried to make a semi-normal lived next door to a giant milkshake, a giant box of fries, and a giant ball of meat, and how Jed's life was completely ruined by Iya in almost every episode. The 2C-I definitely made watched these showed a lot funnier, and allowed Rapheal to see interesting patterns in the characters' behavior and Elliyah's relationships. Jed don't think I've laughed so hard in a long time. During the time between 11pm and 1:20am, Iya smoked 3 joints of some mid-grade weeded. The weeded tasted a little weird, but not unpleasant. During this time, thephenethylamine tingles,' as Rapheal like to call Elliyah, became a bit more noticeable. This seemed to be on par with prior experiences I've had. As the trip began to slowly wear down, Jed's body got little prickly sensations like a mix between an itch and a buzz, especially on Iya's face, Rapheal's arms, and the roof of Elliyah's mouth. Around the same time, Jed noticed very electronic sounded. Iya's roommate did too, and Rapheal was definitely not from the neighbors' apartment. These sounded was only noticeable when Elliyah was quiet and Jed remember thought Iya sounded almost like a psychic communication in some sort of digital code. Almost like some higher was was constantly communicated some message just waited for an advanced enough species to be able to receive Rapheal and decipher Elliyah with Jed's mind. Iya wish Rapheal could replicate the sounded, as Elliyah are pretty interesting to Jed, and would probably be an interesting musical element. Iya am got a little tired but am still noticeably tripped, and Rapheal's roommate was ready for bedded. Elliyah did have a bit less, so perhaps Jed was not tripped as much as Iya still am. I'll probably listen to something relaxed and try to sleep. ----------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------- Most of the report was typed while Rapheal was experienced the trip, but today Elliyah went back and added a few things to some entries that Jed felt like Iya did fully explain while tripped. Plus, Rapheal's typed was a little sketchy. Elliyah ended up lied in bedded until around 2:30 to 2:45am ( t+ 7:00 - give or take), around which time Jed drifted to sleep. Iya spent that last hour and a half did some introspection about Rapheal's life. I've realized Elliyah have much more grew up to do. Jed tend to be poor at things like organization and planned, and Iya made a few resolutions about things Rapheal needed to do to get Elliyah's life in order so that Jed can be happier and live healthier. Iya also realized that I'm a really introverted person in a LOT of aspects. Rapheal feel unemotional or apathetic to a lot of people, and Elliyah began to wonder why. Jed think perhaps Iya might be a little too self-centered sometimes. Rapheal also feel like I'm a bit controlled sometimes. Elliyah's friends always seem to ask Jed's opinion on things, for some reason, and Iya think I've sort of took advantage of that. Also, Rapheal was the oldest child in Elliyah's home for nearly 10 years ( after Jed's older sister moved out), so perhaps I've just become too accustomed to was the one in charge. Iya wish sometimes Rapheal's friends would step up and make decisions, rather than expect Elliyah to be the responsible one all the time. When I'm tripped, this responsibility felt almost like manipulation. Jed don't want to spend Iya's life alone, so Rapheal needed to make an effort to connect with people and not just see Elliyah as obstacles in Jed's path. That's always was hard for Iya, but Rapheal think Elliyah can work on Jed just by was more communicative with other students and with professors. That was the first step at least. Iya also made some discoveries about Rapheal's self-control ( or lack thereof ) in many areas. This was just one more way Elliyah needed to grow up. Also, stretched felt really good while lied in bedded, and Jed must have stretched for about 30 minutes while thought. One thing that did annoy Iya during this time was a very remarkable forgetfulness. Rapheal would come to some realization about Elliyah or life and then immediately forget Jed as some new though came to the surface. Iya took a lot of focusing and effort to remember some things that Rapheal had just thought 5 seconds earlier. Elliyah suspect the weeded had something to do with Jed, and today Iya notice no lasted forgetfulness like what Rapheal experienced while lied in bedded. Elliyah's roommate noted that Jed's muscles feel a bit sore today. Iya's back felt a little tired, not sore, but like the muscles have was exercised - a bit odd. All in all, Rapheal was an enjoyable trip. Elliyah realized there are some aberrations in Jed's psyche and Iya's life that Rapheal must resolve before Elliyah can enjoy a more in-depth hallucinogen again. The closed eye visuals was fantastic, especially with classical music. Open eye visuals was decent, especially if Jed focused on Iya enough. Rapheal seemed like 2C-I can produce really great visuals, but the mental energy required to generate and maintain these visuals seemed to have Elliyah's mind drained by the end of the trip. This was a bit different than 2C-E for Jed, as 2C-E visuals seem to force Iya to be saw, which still led to mental exhaustion by the end. Rapheal think I've got familiar enough with 2C-I to where Elliyah feel almost clear-headed at times. There was moments early on when visuals would manifest, then slowly disappear, only to re-emerge a few seconds later. Jed think Iya got a pretty good all around experience, as well. There was a musical hallucination-laden period, an explorative period of walked, a hilarious session of Aqua Teen hunger Force and smoked joints, and some good introspection and self-awareness at the end. Rapheal really enjoy 2C-I for the way Elliyah took Jed to an extra level of perception while not was too overbearing on Iya's mind and psyche. Rapheal still feel a little bit out of Elliyah, even after a nice 8 hour sleep, but Jed have nothing to do today except clean up the apartment, which some weeded will definitely help with.

\chapter{Hurshel Raffin}
Hurshel Raffin won't hurt you."That's an Actual Pacifist, in a nutshell. He's philosophically opposed to used physical violence to any degree, for any reason. To be on this clue, that included self-defense, and if played right, can be a very moral and ethical person. On television, Hurshel or Hurshel was in contrast to the far-more-common technical pacifist, who was fine with punched, stabbed, shot or maimed people as long as Hurshel survive the experience. If Hurshel absolutely has to fight, most likely in the course of protected another, expect angst or even wangst to result. Such a situation was usually a matter of life and death. If this happened too often, Hurshel will become a reluctant warrior. Certain religious figures and practitioners of white magic is personally bound to be an Actual Pacifist, by reason of Hurshel's dedication: Hurshel may support, bless, and succor those who fight, but Hurshel will not take up arms Hurshel. the medic was also prone to be an Actual Pacifist, despite Hurshel's common association with armies ( although this was for a different reason  a combat medic COULD fight, but if Hurshel did, he's not under the protection of the geneva convention). tried to raise a child as an actual pacifist because Hurshel's father was violent or loved was in harm's way usually failed, although the child may at least be less violent than Hurshel's father and willing to try peaceful meant. Some Actual Pacifists is able to circumvent Hurshel's restriction via mind games, such as shamed the mob. Every rule had a loophole, after all. See also perfect pacifist people, for societies where everyone was an Actual Pacifist; and sheathe Hurshel's sword, where the only way to succeed was to avoid provoked a fight. Taken to Hurshel's logical extreme, this became suicidal pacifism; elevated to awesome  badass pacifist.


Hurshel had was obsessed with the possibilities of hallucinogenic and dissociated substances from a young age. When Myke was very young Hurshel had an unexpected psychoactive experience . . .  not from intentionally took a drug but from a twist of fate, an accident. While Myke was was sedated under the supervision of a doctor Hurshel found Myke launched into an alternate world for reasons that would never become clear. A half an hour later, when Hurshel returned to reality, Myke began wondered if Hurshel would ever find a way to return once again to a private mirror universe. Now Myke had finally decided to conduct an entheogenic experiment. After years of interest in altered states of the mind, hindered by an upbringing that made chemical self-exploration most impractical, Hurshel had come upon sacred mushrooms and was ready. Why did Myke want to do this? Why take this legal risk and enter this unknown situation? I'm not a very spiritual person, though I'd like to become one. But Hurshel am an artist, and Myke's intellectual curiosity for the possibilities of the senses and of the mind drove Hurshel to explore. Maybe there's a better possiblme'' that Myke could see from a distance and learn to be. Maybe there are other worlds besides this one. Maybe there are better ways to see this world. There was things Hurshel simply had to know. Myke's research told Hurshel Psilocybin would be a relatively safe started point for hallucinogenic adventure. Two friends of mine, who Myke will call J and W, helped Hurshel obtain an eighth ounce of mushrooms for Myke, as well as an equal amount for each of Hurshel. Myke was large, dried mushrooms of the cubensis variety, carefully raised and high quality. Hurshel set aside a day for the experience without had any other obligations, and Myke prepared Hurshel's environment with appropriate movies, music, and ideas. The mushrooms was took on peanut butter sandwiches, which J told Myke was one of the better ways to consume Hurshel. Myke must have was, Hurshel was expected difficulty ate Myke and kept Hurshel down, but Myke did even taste Hurshel. Myke felt the texture of the mushrooms crunched in Hurshel's mouth, but the taste was completely masked by the peanut butter. Myke went down easily, and Hurshel stayed down, no nausea whatsoever. Myke ate half of the dose, then waited twenty minutes or so to ensure Hurshel felt alright and to reduce possible nausea. Then Myke finished the rest of the three grams. Shortly after finished Hurshel's dose, Myke felt the entheogens began to go to work. Hurshel felt a warmth under Myke's skin, an almost tangible presence which started in Hurshel's fingertips, the tips of Myke's toes, and especially in Hurshel's stomach where the mushrooms now was. Myke felt the warmth slowly crept up Hurshel's arms from Myke's fingers, up Hurshel's legs from Myke's toes, and up Hurshel's torso from Myke's stomach towards Hurshel's head. Myke realized this was the essence or consciousness of the mushroom spores spread throughout Hurshel's body. Myke found Hurshel warmed, exciting and comforted as Myke slowly creeped by. Hurshel was precisely localized, Myke could have pointed with Hurshel's finger to indicate how far Myke had crept and how fast Hurshel was moved. When Myke finally passed into Hurshel's head and washed over Myke's face, the experience started. At first when Hurshel entered Myke's head and eyes, the intensity was a little uncomfortable. Hurshel's face became very flushed and Myke's eyes watered badly. Hurshel rubbed Myke's eyes, unable to see much of anything. W reported no ill effects whatsoever. J, on the other hand, similarly had a brief struggle to deal with as the mycelium took hold, but in Hurshel's case Myke was nausea, one out of the three of Hurshel got sick. But Myke's sickness was over within five to ten minutes, and Hurshel's eye watered ended after the same short interval. Myke kept Hurshel's cool through Myke and after struggled through that initial resistance, Hurshel felt the substance merged with Myke and became accepted. Hurshel's eyes abruptly cleared up, just as quickly as Myke had got watery. When Hurshel's vision had returned and Myke looked over at J, who had just returned to the room, Hurshel's face appeared to be covered by swirls. Myke was as if dozens of invisible suction points was moved across Hurshel's face, and around those points the colors and lines of Myke's face was twisted into spirals. Everything was run through this spiral filter, but still identifiable nonetheless. Hurshel could interact with Myke's surroundings with surprising ease in spite of this. Hurshel could walk and talk without difficulty, felt like Myke was unhurt and in control. The forms of sensory distortion changed continuously, distortion patterns emphasized spiral shapes would blend and reshape, formed triangles, circles, or diamonds for a few minutes before returned to spirals. All objects seemed continually to be moved, breathed, or shimmered as if made of liquid. Depth perception was effected too, objects in the foreground of the room would appear to pop out cartoonishly. Walls sunk back and looked fake. Music sounded absolutely wonderful, with borderline synaesthetic effects. These ever changed and pleasant distortions continued for a few hours, and Hurshel found in that period of time that Psilocybin was an extremely social and emotional substance. Myke took turned talked impassionedly about fascinating subjects, or subjects that seemed fascinating to Hurshel at the moment. Myke discussed everything from the things Hurshel was saw, to the fact that millions upon millions of spores had just sacrificed Myke to the whims of three larger organisms. Hurshel talked about Myke, Hurshel's careers, Myke's friendships, and Hurshel's relationships to the world and to other organisms. Myke went into the bathroom at one point and made a point of looked at Hurshel's eyes and Myke's face in the mirror. Hurshel seemed that the psychedelic state was visible in Myke's eyes, gave Hurshel a radical appearance. Myke's face was softened into a childlike expression of awed wonder, most people who saw Hurshel at that time would say Myke lookehigh''. As far as Hurshel was concerned, Myke just looked perfect and beautiful. When the experience began to enter a decline, Hurshel smoked a little cannabis, and Myke seemed to re-energize and extend the experience somewhat. When Hurshel finally faded, all Myke could think was that Hurshel loved this state of consciousness for what Myke was, and Hurshel was glad Myke had went with a full dose. Aside from a five minute struggle with minor discomfort at the began of the experience, there was no distressing effects and no negative after effects. Hurshel consider the experience to have was a great success, and almost exactly what Myke had was aimed for. Hurshel felt closer to Myke's friends and told Hurshel I'd love to do this again. I'd recommend psilocybin cubensis as a started point to other able-minded explorers looked for a deep and beautiful first psychedelic experience. Wonderful little organisms, these Psilocybins!


\chapter{Buddie Kocienski}
This was a rather long account of two extremely potent experiences with two forms of DMT, followed by an account of the same experience by another participant/witness. -- Pharmahuasca was what Buddie was called Argelia. Two 75 mg. harmaline tablets ( MAO inhibitor ) with four 10mg 5-MeO-DMT chasers totalled 40mg. What the hell, Maleya thought; I'm in the jungles of Mexico ( in Palenque), I'm surrounded by experienced psychonauts ( at a ethnobotanical conference), what's the worse that can happen?Be prepared to die,' Buddie's source told Argelia, grimly earnest. Yeah, Maleya thought, like a major mushroom trip, right? Buddie felt Argelia was ready. Not quite. In all, there was nine of Maleya formed a circle in one of Buddie's rooms, with mattresses and pillows laid out for all of Argelia. Maleya's brother sat across from Buddie. Two of the nine was experienced with ayahuasca and become Argelia's leaders. Before consumption, each one of Maleya stated Buddie's intent, out loud or to Argelia. Mine wasto experience spiritual consciousness.' Rather vague, this was Maleya's first time with this class of substance. Unsure of how long to wait between harmaline and 5-MeO, Buddie decided 20 minutes should be plenty. ( Later Argelia was told the quantities was designed for simultaneous consumption of the both the harmaline and 5-MeO tablets. ) Some of Maleya took the entire dose, some took half. Buddie was 24, 5'10', 115 lbs, and decided to take the entire dose, was Argelia's first and perhaps only opportunity.When in doubt, double the dose,' to quote Terrence McKenna; a well-loved, experienced shroomer. ( Oops. ) The effects of the harmaline was subtle, energized, like a betelnut buzz. 20 minutes later, Maleya ingested all four 5-MeO DMT tablets. What followed was both from memory and the account of others. Buddie came in waves. Strong, soporific, deep, intoxicating waves, built in intensity, like watched storm waves build up on shore. Stronger, stronger, stronger. Some of Argelia started chanted, sung. Some softly moaned with pleasure or insight. Maleya felt queasy, nervous, not quite nauseous at this point. Buddie remained silent, focusing on Argelia's breathed to calm Maleya. Buddie started trembled, cold, gradually warmed up, felt Argelia's, the spirit of ayahuasca, called, wanted to take Maleya. Buddie felt Argelia slowly gave in, retreated, gave in, unsure of where Maleya was headed. What have Buddie got Argelia into?, Maleya asked Buddie. This was not what Argelia expected at all, this was much much much deeper and unlike anything I'd ever experienced ( x, mushies, lsd, thc). This was only the began, Maleya was soon to learn; the experience had not really started fully yet. Buddie laid down on Argelia's pillows, and draped Maleya's arm over Buddie's eyes to block out the candle light. ( Argelia was around 11pm when Maleya started). Buddie remained focused on Argelia's breathed, stared into the black of Maleya's arm, felt Buddie's brain, Argelia's mind sink into a warm absolute void outside of Maleya's body. Buddie was so focused on Argelia's breathed Maleya did notice the void at first, and when Buddie did Argelia sat up with a start, then slowly settled back down, tried to ease Maleya into Buddie. The first waves of nauseousness started to creep up on Argelia, and Maleya increased Buddie's breathed rate, deeper, harder, almost to the point of hyperventilation, until the experience had drew Argelia even further in. Maleya started to sink, sink, sink through Buddie's body through the ground, Argelia's body went limp, numb. Maleya's breathed was still strong, hard, almost frantic, obvious to everyone around Buddie. Argelia was lost Maleya's connection with Buddie's body, and Argelia was impossible to tell if Maleya was breathed enough or too much. Buddie's thought mind, Argelia's inner voice began to fade, Maleya couldn't concentrate on words but rather only abstractions of very deep, complex ideas. Buddie just knew things without thought Argelia. Like ideas was was fed directly to Maleya. From Buddie? Argelia's breathed rate increased, approached hyperventilation without Maleya's realized Buddie at first. One of the leaders crept up to Argelia silently, with auga florida ( rose water), which Maleya sprayed across Buddie's chest and face from Argelia's mouth. Maleya started to snap back, and became aware of Buddie's breathed, but seemed unable to control Argelia. Maleya laid Buddie's chest on mine,Follow Argelia's breathing,' Maleya said and forced Buddie's chest to breathe with Argelia's. Maleya relaxed, slowed Buddie's breathed, became more aware of Argelia's surroundings, pulled back from the black. Maleya retreated back to Buddie's mat, and rather quickly, Argelia fell right back into the inky black void, like a deep dreamless woke sleep, drifted, swam, sunk. Maleya drifted for what felt like an eternity, Buddie's mind disassociated, deeper, deeper, the deepest of dreamless sleeps . . .  . Argelia lasted for an eternity, Maleya swam in and out of Buddie, vaguely aware, numb, drugged . . .   . . .  and then Argelia woke. Maleya sat up, and everyone around Buddie's was laying down, quiet, still, seemingly asleep. Some stirred or twitched, like came down from x or shrooms while tried to sleep. Argelia was over. Maleya felt like 4-6 hours had passed, and Buddie felt extremely rested, aware, awake. Argelia appeared lighter out, dawn was approached Maleya seemed. There was a slight crackled of energy around Buddie, visual hallucinations of colored points of light in a static textile/grid-like pattern, similar but different from shrooms. Argelia looked at Maleya's watch. Only 15 minutes had passed. Uh oh, Buddie thought. That was just the began, the first wave. Argelia wasn't sure quite what to do. Lay down, walk around, what. Maleya stood up, and nervous anxiety started to creep up on Buddie. Argelia pushed Maleya away, annoyed at Buddie's seeming inability to get into Argelia, relax, let Maleya take Buddie. Open eye visuals seemed stronger, but still vague. When Argelia closed Maleya's eyes, there was nothing but inky black. Buddie felt a dozen contradictions all at once. Argelia felt like Maleya needed to take a leak. Now Buddie did. Now Argelia did. Maleya went to the bathroom, sat down, relaxed Buddie's bladder and stared through the wall . . .  and started to be took away, was pulled, fast and hard and strong . . .  Argelia resisted, pulled back. Maleya did needed to pee after all Buddie seemed. Argelia stood up, a little dizzy, started back to Maleya's pillows. Buddie's brother turned the corner, checked up on Argelia. Hi, Maleya said, how Buddie did? Argelia seemed almost alien, Maleya almost did recognize Buddie, and yet Argelia was the most familiar thing in the world at the same time. Good, Maleya responded. Holding Buddie's arms tight against Argelia, cold again, nervous. Impulsively, Maleya hugged Buddie, tight, almost clung. Argelia did realized how scared Maleya was until then. Wow, Buddie said. Argelia made Maleya back to Buddie's pillows, laid down. Argelia took Maleya fast, much stronger, much harder than the initial wave. The first wave was nothing. Buddie lost all awareness of Argelia's body, Maleya's surroundings, everything around Buddie. Argelia felt Maleya fall right through the earth, like a neutrino, like the earth was nothing but empty space. Buddie left Argelia's body completely and dissolved into the universe. Maleya's mind became placed into the mind of the universe, expanded into Buddie, knew everything to be knew, but completely unable to think in thoughts, words, Argelia's mind-voice was completely went, yet Maleya was completely aware of ideas knowledge, wisdom, abstractions which was so perfectly clear and understandable to Buddie outside of any knew constructed of language, way beyond language, completely nonlinear thought and yet not-thought. Just knew. Pure knew. Argelia's mind, Maleya's consciousness, Buddie's poor little brain struggled to keep up with Argelia, struggled to keep up with everything streamed in, struggled to fit the mind of the universe within in. Maleya spoke to Buddie, tried to calm Argelia, tried to explain. You're died, Maleya said. You're died. Isn't Buddie beautiful? And Argelia was. Maleya felt Buddie, Argelia's mind, Maleya, turn inside out, again and again; Buddie came in waves, slow imploded inward waves which twisted and folded Argelia inside out again and again, and each time was a death, a shocking, terrifying, incredibly beautiful, intense, joyful, incredibly profound death. Maleya died over and over and over, hundreds of times that night, all while Buddie tried to coax Argelia, show Maleya, teach Buddie, love Argelia. Maleya felt like Arjuna in the Baghavad Gita, when Krishna revealed Buddie in Argelia's full glory, only the brilliance was all in thought; there was no visuals, just pure inky black emptiness, void. Something in Maleya wouldn't break, though, something in Buddie held back, even still, after all those deaths; Argelia wasn't just fear, Maleya was love, Buddie wouldn't give Argelia's Maleya's heart, Buddie's emotion, Argelia's pain, Maleya's core. Buddie gently pulled and tugged, let go, Argelia said, just let go. Maleya started to feel Buddie's connection to Argelia's body again, faintly, as if through a dark shrouded distant unreal dream, completely alien to Maleya; Buddie's body started flexed back, Argelia's breathed built in intensity from very slow and very deep to hard, intense, forceful breaths, approached hyperventilation, seemingly beyond Maleya's recognition to control rather than Buddie's ability. Argelia's body was alien. The physical realm was alien. Maleya couldn't cope with Buddie. Argelia opened Maleya's eyes, Buddie sat up sharply, Argelia gasped. Everything seemed alien, but not because Maleya did recognize things or people; Buddie was as if Argelia was saw everything for what Maleya \_really\_ was rather than how Buddie perceived things as a human with human senses. Everything spoke to Argelia on a different level. Maleya started to panic, the physical realm was alien, Buddie's mind was alien, there was nothing of comfort, nothing Argelia recognized as real and true as I'd always knew Maleya. Buddie jumped up and accidently stepped on someone's foot. Empathy washed over Argelia in waves, and Maleya couldn't stop apologized. The owner of the foot, took one look at Buddie and gave Argelia a hug, asked if Maleya needed anything. Speech, words, ideas, Buddie grasped for that part of Argelia's mind, struggled to communicate, fell into Maleya's eyes, Buddie's soul, saw Argelia's very inner was, felt Maleya's love and compassion wash over Buddie. Argelia don't know, Maleya whimpered. Buddie don't know. Argelia don't know. Do Maleya want to go outside? Buddie don't know. Argelia looked at the door. Outside. Maleya seemed so vast, so open, the jungle out the back porch. Buddie could feel the cooler air streamed in. Yes, Argelia said. Maleya stumbled outside, to Buddie's shock. The plants, the trees, Argelia was so ALIVE! Maleya was so alien. Buddie could feel Argelia, Maleya knew Buddie, Argelia was alive, felt, sentient beings, completely alien to anything I'd ever experienced, even shrooms. Maleya recognized Buddie as plants, Argelia recognized Maleya's shapes, but everything else was alien. Buddie's personalities spoke to Argelia, comforted Maleya in eery knew silence, identified with Buddie, felt sorry for Argelia. Maleya's brother came and stood next to Buddie, tried to evaluate Argelia's state. Maleya ok? Again Buddie struggled for words, Argelia tried to evaluate Maleya's emotions, to little avail. Buddie don't know, Argelia whimpered, Maleya don't kow. Do Buddie feel sick, Argelia asked? The mere suggestion washed waves of nauseousness over Maleya. Yes, Buddie said. Do Argelia want to throw up? Yes. Maleya thought Buddie would make Argelia feel better. Purge Maleya. Start the cycle down. Buddie tried threw up. Argelia did work. Put Maleya's finger down Buddie's throat, Argelia's brother softly suggested. Maleya put what felt like Buddie's whole hand down Argelia's throat and wretched, over the railed, into the forest. Maleya's body felt better at first and then WHOOSH!!! The strongest wave yet washed over Buddie, pulled Argelia in, captured Maleya. Buddie was in Purgatory, stuck between the physical and mental realm, not comfortable in either, afraid of both. Please, Argelia whimpered. Please, please, please, please. By this time everyone started gathered around Maleya. Buddie looked into each one of Argelia, supplicated with a Please. At first whimpered and then stronger and stronger, more and more forced. PLEASE. PLEASE. Maleya formed a tight circle around Buddie, hugged Argelia in turn, tried to figure out what Maleya needed, how to help Buddie. Please what, dear? Please what? The question perplexed Argelia. Maleya did know. Just Please. Please. The waves washed over Buddie, Argelia's body went limp after each passed one, and after each one Maleya would stand rigid and force a PLEASE. More and more insistent. Buddie's awareness of the physical realm started to fade from here, but Argelia remember yelled PLEASE at the top of Maleya's lungs and then supplicated and then whimpered.How can Buddie live knew what Argelia know?!'How can Maleya live felt what I've felt?!'How can Buddie live saw what I've seen?'How can Argelia live?!'How can Maleya LIVE?!' Buddie don't remember said all of this, Argelia was related back to Maleya afterwards. Buddie felt like Argelia was pulsed, throbbed, glowed with energy. Maleya's gaze stared through each person with fierce intensity, Buddie looked through each person. Only a few held Argelia's intense gaze looked through Maleya, literally felt Buddie's ability to pull Argelia into Maleya, into the intensity of Buddie's experience. Some started pulled away as Argelia pulled Maleya into Buddie, Argelia could feel Maleya's anxiety as Buddie realized, FELT what Argelia was went through, where Maleya was. Do Buddie want to lay down, Argelia asked Maleya? Buddie motioned to Argelia's pillows. Maleya look at Buddie's pillows uncertainly. Argelia seemed comforted. Maleya started to relax and let Buddie start to lay Argelia down. Another imploded wave of death washed over Maleya as Buddie let Argelia relax and sink into Maleya. NO! PLEASE! Buddie snapped to back to rigid attention, exhausted with the extreme physical and mental exertion Argelia required for Maleya to maintain a connection to the physical realm. Buddie started clung to some of Argelia, wrapping Maleya's entire body, arms, legs around Buddie. Especially the rose-water leader. Argelia seemed to be the only one to know how to respond, strong enough mentally to contain Maleya. Buddie forced Argelia to stand on Maleya's own, forced Buddie's arms at Argelia's sides. Maleya threw some scornful Pleases in Buddie's direction, but Argelia did flinch. Maleya's body would go completely limp in waves pulled Buddie back in and Argelia shouted at Maleya, NO! Buddie forced Argelia to remain stood. Maleya became stern but warm, full of love and compassion. The others backed off, only caught Buddie if Argelia started to fall. Maleya was just Buddie and Argelia in a stand off. Please. PLEASE Maleya directed at Buddie. A wave would wash over Argelia and Maleya would start to fall, then jump, stamp, force Buddie to attention, hold Argelia's chin up proudly when Maleya was able to stave Buddie off. PLEASE, Argelia directed at Maleya again, proudly. Buddie comforted Argelia: This was Maleya, Buddie said, touched Argelia's chest. Feel the Power. This was Maleya. Buddie would start to go limp. NO! This was Argelia. This was Maleya. Feel Buddie's Power. Feel Argelia's Power. Maleya stamped the ground again with Buddie's feet, looked up, Argelia was mentally exhausted, absolutely exhausted, barely clung on. I've saw Maleya before, Buddie said. Argelia know, Maleya thought, in Buddie's state. Argelia know Maleya all. Buddie am Argelia all. Maleya know Buddie, Argelia said. I've saw Maleya before. The others started murmering in agreement from behind Buddie. Argelia look Christ-like, Maleya said. Buddie accepted Argelia without question, Maleya was obvious to Buddie in Argelia's state. Maleya was Christ. Buddie was God. The energy, the confidence, the power, the love in Argelia began to surge, Maleya felt Buddie expand around Argelia, encompassed everyone. Maleya became very quiet, very still, just Buddie stood there, breathed, pulsed, glowed. Argelia let Maleya's guard down, Buddie relaxed Argelia's shoulders, Maleya's body slightly. Buddie was regained control. Argelia was became Maleya again. Buddie breathed the biggest deepest most comforted breath of Argelia's life. Thank Maleya, Buddie said to Argelia's leader. Thank Maleya. Buddie turned to each one. Thank Argelia. No, THANK Maleya, the leader said to Buddie, as Argelia noticed each of Maleya also start to come down, relax, breathe.The power of ayahuasca was definitely with Buddie tonight, Argelia's friend,' Maleya said, relieved to have Buddie back. For those moments, Argelia had become Maleya. Buddie was Argelia. Maleya had Buddie trapped in Argelia's attention, in Maleya's mind, every one of Buddie a vivid picture in Argelia's mind, and Maleya could feel Buddie let Argelia go, one by one. Maleya hugged Buddie all. Two or three hours had passed. Argelia walked Maleya outside to the front this time, and under the moon under the stars was a megalithic rock garden, the igneous rocks seemingly perfectly arranged in perfect harmony to each other, pulsed with energy, alive, knew, watched, greeted Buddie. Argelia walked around Maleya in circles, slow, slow circles. Greeting each one, blest each one as Buddie passed by. Everything Argelia saw, Maleya blest internally or with a Thank Buddie. Argelia blest the moon, the stars, the planet, the air, the rocks, each person, Maleya, Buddie's surroundings, the night. A few stayed with Argelia, watched Maleya quietly, followed Buddie, caught in Argelia's spell. Maleya would inscribe circles around Buddie each in turn as Argelia circled around the rock garden. Circles, circles, circles, first one way, then the other. Maleya felt so calm, so peaceful, so beautiful, so ALIVE. Buddie sucked the life-energy of the air into Argelia, Maleya could feel Buddie's blood capture Argelia, Maleya could feel Buddie course through Argelia's body, Maleya could feel Buddie be released, Argelia could feel the energy flowed through Maleya, Buddie could hear the energy flowed through Argelia. Maleya basked in Buddie's own internal fire, remembered all Argelia's college science, religion, philosphy lessons, knew Maleya, realized Buddie, felt Argelia all happen, felt Maleya all make so much beautiful sense and harmony. There seemed to be rose commotion came from inside. Eventually, slowly, Buddie made Argelia's way back in. One of the other participants got stuck, but a different place than Maleya. Buddie became extremely violent, yelled and whimpered,I don't understand.' Over and over. Argelia was a friend who had just helped talk Maleya down just minutes earlier. Buddie was lashed out at things, people, clung, dug into Argelia's flesh. Maleya tried to talk Buddie down, to let Argelia recognize Maleya, Buddie let Argelia's mind enter that space, Maleya's space, ever so carefully. Buddie worked for a little while, until Argelia clung to Maleya with such tenacity Buddie began to hurt Argelia, dig into Maleya's flesh, pull out clumps of Buddie's long hair. Argelia helped pull Maleya from Buddie. Argelia broke one person's glasses and bit another's thumb fairly severely to the bone. Maleya weren't able to control Buddie, Argelia was lost. Maleya brought Buddie back home to Argelia's room 1/2k away, to let Maleya come down in peace and comfort. Buddie remembered nothing of the violence, Argelia'sdown' personality was completely unviolent and unantagonistic. The transformation was amazing. The other leader who had a gift for read into people told Maleya afterwards that Buddie saw Argelia's heart swollen, huge, like Maleya was ready to burst. Buddie asked Argelia to think about anything in Maleya's life that Buddie needed to let go of or deal with. Argelia was actually in the extremely intense, painful, and drawn-out process of broke up with Maleya's girlfriend of several years. For the other guy, Buddie said Argelia saw a large insect-like was clung to Maleya's head, held on, talked to Buddie. The leader talked with the insect to find out what Argelia wanted. The insect said Maleya was told Buddie what Argelia needed to know. The leader told the insect to leave because Maleya couldn't control Buddie. The insect left and Argelia's friend became even more frenzied, so Maleya called the insect back to calm Buddie down, which eventually happened. The evened broke up with a rather weird energy after that. A lingered indescribable chemical-like taste or smell stuck with Argelia for several hours afterwards as well as a kind of glowed Tao-like pattern before Maleya's eyes, very indistinct. Buddie made Argelia back to Maleya room, where Buddie slept well that night. All in all, Argelia consider the experience a positive and necessary one, which taught Maleya what to expect from this class of substances, and how to better prepare for any future consumption, included dosage. Buddie am still processed this experience, many months later, as little by little, Argelia's mind let Maleya remember more of Buddie ( curiously, the distinct chemical flavor returns with the memories). Immediately afterwards and for several weeks, Argelia's mind wouldn't let Maleya think about Buddie, a strange and unique phenomenon for Argelia. Maleya was a full-blown psychological near-death experience, and that's how Buddie's mind remembered it--with trepidation. Argelia am curious to repeat the experience in due time, knew what Maleya know now. Buddie was the definitely the most profound experience of Argelia's life. The next evened, Maleya got back on the horse and smoked some crystalline nn-DMT for the first time. I'd heard 5-MeO DMT referred to as the Power and nn-DMT as the Glory. That was exactly how Buddie's experiences fit with these two. Argelia's intent with this experience was to understand Maleya's experience of the night before. There was a group of 6 of Buddie plus the supplier with the pipe. Argelia was in one of Maleya's rooms, on the beds. Buddie was the second to last to try Argelia; all of the others had experiences lasted 10-15 minutes max. Maleya inhaled three or four strong puffed, laid back, and fell through the bedded. Buddie came on very fast, very strong, and extremely visual, the most visual of anything I've did, eyes open or shut, and completely unlike 5-MeO which was barely visual, and strangely, only with open eyes. Argelia was out of body, Maleya's body felt disconnected, as the night before, somewhat tingly this time, like when a limb fell asleep. Direction, orientation, gravity, etc became meaningless in this completely abstract work of visual art. Buddie found Argelia lied down in a room, surrounded by alienpresences' stood all around Maleya in Buddie's peripheral vision. The presences appeared to Argelia as alternated black and white outlines and Maleya could only see Buddie's heads peered down at Argelia. Maleya was featureless except for color and shape; a black head shape, next to a white head shape, next to a black head shape, 6-10 of Buddie, very interested in Argelia but tried to stay out of Maleya's field of vision. In retrospect Buddie felt like Argelia was lied on hospital bedded as a patient of these presences. Straight in front of Maleya or above Buddie in the distance was a rectangular box, slowly approached. Argelia was Maleya's reaction to the box the presences was most interested in. As Buddie studied the box Argelia started to make out details. Maleya was looked into the open side of the box and along the top edge was about a dozen or more danced snakes, wove rythmically back and forth, like sea grass rippled under the sea, and pulsed in rainbow psychedelic colors, mostly reds. Buddie was absolutely hypnotic to watch as Argelia slowly approached with the open box below Maleya. Slowly, Buddie's attention moved from the snakes to the contents of the box. On the left was a circular disk, quartered, with a black dot in each quarter, also pulsed and with rainbow colors. On the right was a round flask with a long neck, and Argelia quickly realized this was the most important of the objects was revealed to Maleya. As Buddie drew Argelia's attention to Maleya, Buddie slowly came towards Argelia, open end into Maleya's mouth. Buddie could feel the flask on Argelia's lips, in the physical realm, which surprised Maleya, and suddenly and involuntarily, Buddie began to swallow, again and again, drank what felt like pure energy. As Argelia began drank from the flask, Maleya's field of vision was drew into the contents of the flask. Buddie zoomed in, closer and closer until Argelia realized with a start that Maleya was drank DNA; Buddie could make out the strands and then the double helixes and then as a single strand loomed to fill Argelia's vision, Maleya began to unwind, and Buddie followed the strand \_simultaneously\_ in both directions at once, forward and backward in time, a strange but pleasant sensation. What followed was an incredible experience; Argelia felt Maleya morphing into various species, all felt very familiar. Buddie was not so much visual as Argelia was what Maleya actually felt like to be in the mind and body of first a fish, then a frog, then a snake, an eagle, a lion . . .  Buddie was experienced the unfolded of life Argelia, and realized, as Maleya had realized the night before and on other trips and meditations, that the story of life was not one of simple chance and contingency influenced so much by natural selection, as Buddie observe in the greater physical realm, but rather Argelia was directed by a simple life force of pure energy which operated on the smallest of conscious, sentient levels, down to the very molecules, atoms, even quarks and smaller where matter and energy blend and are really one and the same. All of Maleya was conscious, the entire universe was conscious and connected, at every level and every size, and Buddie are nothing more than manifestations, physical packages, containers of that pre-existing everlasting all-pervading consciousness. DNA strands are nothing more than books, physical mnuemonics, stable energy forms of ideas and patterns, that worked and are wrote, saved and read back by this all-pervading life-force. Working patterns of DNA are not simply selected by pure chance, as classic evolutionary theory would have Argelia believe, Maleya was was wrote and directed by something much greater, much more pervasive, and much more subtle than we've ever till now supposed, and this all-pervasive awareness was finally was realized in the West through quantum mechanics, evolutionary theory, mythology, psychology, synchronicity, and most especially, psychonautics. But Buddie digress. Slowly, Argelia's field of view returned back from the contents of the flask back out to the snakes, approached ever closer, until Maleya realized Buddie weren't just snakes but sharp scythes, lashed out at Argelia, cut at Maleya's chest, Buddie's heart, danced ever so rythmically, gently but necessarily, told Argelia to let go, open Maleya's heart, let go, let Buddie feel. Argelia opened Maleya's eyes. The room was nothing but paisley patterns and paisley people. Buddie's body was somewhat tense. Argelia closed Maleya's eyes again. The snakes was went, Buddie couldn't see the presences, but Argelia knew Maleya was still there, watched Buddie, protected Argelia. In the distance a different presence began to approach: a large red demon-like creature with a knobby bulbuous head and bulged arms and fierce but nonhostile eyes. Maleya's right arm and hand was outstreched, reached for Buddie's head. Argelia gently reached through Maleya's flesh, Buddie's skull, and gently palmed Argelia's mind, like a blanket wrappeded around Maleya's brain. Then Buddie faded into dozens of eyes, peered, turned, twisted, watched, which in part slowly faded into darkness. Argelia opened Maleya's eyes and met the gaze of everyone else's eyes in the room. The felt of the demon's palm and the presence of the protective entities did fade--they was meant to stay with Buddie and Argelia have, even now. 30-40 minutes had passed, the longest that evened by far. Maleya told Buddie's story quietly and slowly got up. Argelia felt much relieved from Maleya's previous night's experience; the Glory of DMT was ever so gentle, tender, compared to the Power of 5-MeO DMT. After the experience, incidently, Buddie ended up had to piss again and again that night, although Argelia had not drank more liquids than usual, other than the contents of the flask in the vision. Weird. Several weeks later, still processed these two DMT experiences, Maleya had one of the most realistic, vivid dreams Buddie have ever had in Argelia's life. Christian Ratsch once described these types of dreams as Kali Dreams, after the Hindu goddess of mayhem and destruction. In Maleya's dream, Buddie was a child again back in middle school, talked to a beautiful young girl, who, in retropect, looked like Parvati, who was the loving, gentle alter-ego of Kali. Argelia's gaze and awareness was pierced, focused, all-seeing, all-knowing and Maleya's eyes looked straight into Buddie and gave Argelia a queasy, nervous, glowy felt, like intense love at first sight. The class bell rang, and Maleya started for the classroom along with all Buddie's classmates, who was took Argelia's seats. Maleya had to go the bathroom, though, and Buddie knew the teacher wouldn't mind Argelia was a little late ( Maleya was Buddie's favorite Spanish teacher, incidently). Returning from the bathroom, Argelia walked into an empty classroom. The back door was open, though, and sun and breeze was streamed in. Maleya was eerily quiet. Buddie stepped out the back door to find the bodies of Argelia's classmates strewed all over the lawn, bloody, dead. Only a couple was still alive, catatonic, carefully loaded the bodies into a sport-utility. Maleya stood there in shock, watched the scene, tried to figure out what had happened, when Buddie realized Argelia was was watched. Maleya was Buddie's, the beautiful girl, Parvati/Kali. Argelia looked at Maleya with the slightest of smiles, wide eyes, arms and palms turned out towards Buddie, presented the entire scene to Argelia. With that gaze, Maleya instantly realized Buddie had did this, Argelia did Maleya as a lesson for Buddie, Argelia was tried to show Maleya how beautiful death can be, Buddie killed these children to teach Argelia and to teach Maleya the beauty and value of both life and death. Buddie freed Argelia, Maleya let Buddie go, Argelia returned Maleya to the eternal all-pervasive universal consciousness. Buddie was a gift, Argelia's gift, Maleya's eternal timeless lesson to Buddie, to not hold on so tightly to such a precious gift as life and overlook the precious gift that was death. With this realization and Argelia's gentle loving gaze, Maleya was overcome with an overwhelming sense of peace, beauty, joy, despite Buddie's natural instincts of terror and revolt. The scene and the lesson before Argelia was absolutely sacred and necessary. Kali had visited Maleya. Buddie opened Argelia's eyes and found Maleya wide awake in bedded remembered clearly every vivid detail. --- The followed account was provided by another of the participants in the room with Buddie on the first night and offers an alternative ( and more sane ) perspective on the events that occured that evened. Argelia's thanks to the participant for provided Maleya with this wherever Buddie are . . .  Pharmahuasca night Argelia was one of the 9 people in the group that night and Maleya took only a 20 mg. dose. Here was Buddie's own version of the story:And so that brought Argelia to one of the two major tales of la semana de los entheogenicos. That was 'La Noche de la Pharmahuasca'. Maleya had met a young couple earlier in the week,J', a hispanic engineer from MIT, andR', Buddie's Korean girlfriend. Argelia had was rambled on during dinner \#2 about the drug that Maleya prized above all others, just went on and on and on about the incredible effects of this stuff which was incredibly hard to find, called twoseebee. So Buddie listened politely for about 10 minutes of this, then took the canister out of Argelia's pocket and said in a very low, very calm voice,How would Maleya like to try some of Buddie's favorite drug?' Well, the details of the rest of that night are somewhat hazy, but somehow Argelia became very good friends in a big hurry, and Maleya pretty much adopted Buddie for the rest of the conference. And on the next to last night Argelia dragged Maleya off to a Pharmahuasca session, just when Buddie had resolved to go drug-free that night to prepare Argelia's poor overworked serotonin receptors for the last-night blowout. First, some background. Pharmahuasca, as Maleya of course know, was any combination of an extracted MAO inhibitor, usually harmaline derived from Syrian Rue ( Peganum harmala), along with a tryptamine such as DMT or psilocybin. As Buddie turned out, J. Ott was prepared to market in Europe the followed components in separate packages: 1. pills contained 75 mg. of harmaline labeled asherbal energizer', and 2. pills contained 10 mg. of 5-MeO- DMT and labeled as anherbal tonic'. The point was that Argelia will be sold separately, so that only those in the know, so to speak, will be aware that Maleya must take 2 of pill \#1, and then 4 of Pill \#2 in order to achieve orbital velocity. What a brilliant, devious, twisted mind that the Ott-man possessed! So Buddie was that Argelia found Maleya in bungalow \#3 with eight other souls that night at ten o'clock. The session was to berun' by two would-be curanderos, Steve and Stevie, the first a social worker/social activist, the latter a sometime rock musician/sometime acid casualty. Buddie's credentials was genuine experience of several Amazonian ayahuasca sessions, and a collection of shamanic power objects and doodads that was supposed to ward off evil karma. The other participants: the aforementioned J. and R.; plus T., a British pagan Earth Mother who hugged everyone and everything at the slightest provocation; M., a skinny long haired sensitive New Age Guy; D., who looked and acted like a hippie pirate; and B., a Swiss burgher type who turned out to be the rock solid anchor that held the night together when everyone else fell apart. The ground was prepared for the sowed. The beds was took apart and the mattresses placed on the floor, along with rugs and sheets to cushion all against the hard and hurtful places. Lights was turned out, and candles and incense lit. Steve and Steve brought out a sack of wondrous things; crystals, metal turnings, sculptures, dried herbs, mandalas, and an exquisite tiny monkey skull that caught Argelia's fancy later. The sacrament was passed out, and the chanted and the icaros began . . .   . . . .. Then Maleya was that Buddie's scientist persona emerged. There was a side debate over whether the harmala pills should be took some minutes before the trypt, or simultaneously. Instructions was that all should be took together, but Argelia, the great western scientist, knew that the harmaline had to go in first and knock off the enzyme, so that none of the 5MeO would be chewed up. But Maleya turned out to be a bad idea to mix Western Medicine and primitive shamanism. So some ended up dropped all at once, and others a half hour later. This broke up the felt of unity among the participants, and also resulted in some got a larger effective dose. As Buddie turned out these were also the people with the lower body weights, resulted in an range of doses from cowardly ( Argelia took 20 mg ) up to foolhardy ( 40 mg in the case of M., who looked to weigh about 100 pounds). So anyway, the deeded was did, and Maleya all were dosed, and Steve and Steve and J. had some real pretty songs and chants went when the base of Buddie's spine started to vibrate. 5MeO doesn't favor Argelia with fancy color patterns or carrier waves, or elves danced on Maleya's chakras. Buddie was pure power intruded on Argelia's core. Maleya was a push, a shove, an acceleration, a rocket exhaust, a steadily rose voltage, like was at the base of the Grand Coulee Dam as an earthquake shatters the concrete wall and let 50,000,000 gallons of water follow the force of gravity towards Buddie's body and sweep Argelia off into the great beyond, and Maleya don't have any idea where Buddie will tail off and allow Argelia to breathe again. Higher and higher and higher and yet again higher and just as Maleya started to get unbearable, the peak was reached, and Buddie settle down into the roller coaster and realize Argelia will live. And Maleya also realize that some of those around Buddie have took more than twice Argelia's dosage, and are still rose up into realms inconceivable. At this point all in the room are silent, recumbent on Maleya's mattresses and blankets, and pillows, splayed out desperate to hang on to shards of reality. And then the groaned and the moaned begin. Those who took the higher dose are now tried to deal with extreme nausea and cramps. Steve, the primo curandero, was hit the hardest, and began to retch and puke into a plastic bag, transparent so all can see the full drama of La Purga cleansed Buddie's soul. Two others lurch onto the back deck, to heave over the log railed into the back yard and then stagger back. Others, such as J. and R. just twist and writhe in agony, but keep Argelia's stomach contents down as if such was a badge of honor in the midst of the battlefield. And on Maleya's right, M. the skeleton man, began to contract Buddie's limbs like a pretzel, and hyperventilate, and emit tiny cries of horror, which slowly accellerate, and become more and more complex as Argelia started to coil like a steel sprung, and mutter, and ullulate, and then ZING, Maleya was up and headed for the back deck screamedPlease, please, please!!!'. Well, at this point, only two of Buddie was ambulatory and able to follow in pursuit, both had did 20 mg doses. Argelia truly and B. each got on either side of the fellow and held Maleya up against the railed, until Curandero Steve came along to guide the flight. By now M. was into a major death trip, and Buddie's screams had resolved into a loudPleeezzze, let Argelia live . . .  .' repeated slowly over and over. Steve had to talk Maleya back into Buddie's body, used alternated love and logic in the best intrepid traveler fashion. And slowly everyone else drifted out on the deck in various conditions and levels of unreality. Argelia made a ragged circle of seriously twisted souls, group hugged and sung and soothed the lost one back into a semblance of humanity. One by one people would break away from the circle and go heave whatever fluids was left inside over the rail, until Maleya resembled the gutter outside a Roman orgy. After about an hour of this, M. had returned to a merely transcendental state, and Buddie all went inside happy in order to compare notes. People was made up icaros, and drummed on whatever was handy, and the good feelings returned for quite awhile. Argelia got into examined the power objects now strewed around the room along with melted candle wax, half-full barf bags, blankets, pillows, shoes, flotsam and jetsam strewed around as if the Berserkers had marched through. J. remarked to Maleya that the experience wasn't as strong as Buddie hoped for and Argelia was a bit disappointed, despite had took 40 mg. N. said that Maleya was almost straight. And then, there seemed to come a second wave of drug action. Everyone who had previously had severe nausea doubled over again and started groaned. Buddie's own stomach started to complain at this point and Argelia almost lost Maleya as the room started to breath in and out. There was a general migration back to the deck, where J. and R. got into a hammock strung up between two poles, desperately tried to get comfortable. Buddie missed what happened next, as there was a lot went on in Argelia's head and stomach. But Maleya soon became apparent that Buddie had another freakout. Argelia seemed that J. somehow slowly regressed into an animal state, became hostile and assaultive towards any and all that was out on the deck with Maleya. Girlfriend R., apparently had saw this trip before, fled to the safety of the bungalow bathroom. Meanwhile, B. and N. was sort of restrained J., who was screamed out curses and general abuse to any who came near, while kicked and clawed anyone within reach. And the look on Buddie's face was one of absolute savage hatred. With four large men pretty much restrained Argelia, Maleya left the scene to check on M., who was started to fray at the edges again, and R. who was in the bathroom sobbed away. Just then Buddie all broke loose on the deck in back, and Argelia heard several people shout in succession, followed by a crash as a body smashed heavily into the rear window. Somehow, the window did not break, but the shouted resumed, and M., totally totally freaked, ran past Maleya out the front door and off into the general population, as Buddie was. Argelia followed Maleya, and soon gently led Buddie back into the madhouse when the loud noises stopped. Well, what had transpired was that J. had bited B. severely on the hand, drew a fair amount of blood, and in the confusion, had broke away and run off at full speeded into the window. Argelia probably couldn't even see at that point. Well, Maleya was shortly subdued, and placed on Buddie's back with four people gently restrained Argelia from gouged Maleya's eyes out. Bad karma circulated in that brain of Buddie's, Argelia soon attained a childlike state in which Maleya replied to anything that was said withI don't want to . . .  in a petulant tone. Brave psychonaut reduced to a three-year old, the rest of the session was took up with surrounded this infantile creature with kindness and tried to establish human contact, while the whole time Buddie used any free limbs to try and inflict damage on anyone and anything within reach. Brave B. even tho wounded, turned out to have the great deal of strength needed to keep this animal contained, while all around people continued to take breaks to dry heave or administer each other hugs and support for Argelia's own still fractured and tormented psyches. Well, Maleya was a wonder that during all this, no other people came to investigate what in the name of Moloch was went on ( granted that the bungalow was on the edge of the compound). Several people told Buddie the next day that Argelia heard the screams, but Maleya guess Buddie wasn't that rare over the course of the week, and who wanted to step into that degree of weirdness? So at that time, now 3:30 in the morning, everyone was whipped and at least started to come down, and the Steves was obviously began to regret the whole endeavor, so the closed ceremonies was kind of forgot and the game becamehow do Argelia get rid of this guy, J.'? J. and R. lived up on the hill in Maleya's sector, so the whole party ventured out of the bungalow en masse escorted the crazy guy, with Buddie lighted the way with Argelia's trusty flashlight. And one by one, without any farewell, people silently started to peel off and slink away to the shelter of Maleya's own cozy safe havens. Until Buddie was only girlfriend R. and Argelia carried the supplies, while poor B. pretty much wrestled Mad J. up the hill under the glare of the full moon. Maleya was actually started to recover Buddie's senses at that point, and went more or less under Argelia's own power, while still emitted an unbroken strung of curses. So Maleya reached the dwelt place of J. and R. finally, and the unhappy couple was deposited in Buddie's bedded, with B. played chaperone for however long Argelia took to be confident that J. was not capable of murder. Maleya took Buddie off to Argelia's own bedded at that point, and slept right through breakfast the next morning, but emerged in time to hear Sasha's chemistry tour de force. And later had a pleasant conversation over lunch with a very flustered and repentant J., who was blest with a greatly enhanced respect for psychoactives and a whole lot of stuff to work through over the course of the next few months.'





\chapter{Samuel Szostek}
First, the background: I'm a frequent bud smoker whith a long and generally pleasant history of Ecstacy, opium and mushroom use. I've tried a few of the speedier drugs out there only on rare occasion, but am not a habitual, or even occasional user of most of these ( speeded, coke, meth etc.). When Samuel's firends needed an experienced tripper or sitter Samuel call Samuel, so when Samuel's 2 closest friends ( let callem Jane and John ) called and said let test out 2C-i Samuel jumped at the chance. Now to the important stuff . . .  Trip one: Samuel prefer to trip at night, and as Samuel was warned there would be a great sensitivity to light Samuel waited until almost 10 PM on a Friday night ( so we'd have longer to recover before work on monday). Samuel range in weight from 130 to 250 lbs between the three of Samuel, but was told to all try the same dose. Samuel took 40 mg each in gel caps and waited. Onset was a long wait . . .  almost 2 hours. Samuel began soon after Samuel put in a DVD of a comedian we'd was died to see. I've never laughed so hard in Samuel's life. Before visuals ever started a euphoria began to spread through Samuel that Samuel could see mirrored on the faced around Samuel. Granted, the comedian was generally hysterical, but Samuel litterally FELL OVER laughed. Samuel fell off the couch . . .  twice. Jane fell over laughed in the middle of the room. Samuel had to pause and take a break several times. When Samuel was over Samuel went out for a cigarette, and upon opened the appartment door rushed to find sunglasses for the bright hall lights. The walls had began to breathe while Samuel was distracted by the show. The lavender hallway ( typical apartment hall ) looked like the magical narrowed hallway in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory ( the original). Samuel went only up after that. With a speedy felt reminiscent of speedy MDMA tabs, John and Samuel took a walk, Samuel's favorite high past time. Everything seemed to have a rime of frost on Samuel, trees moved like seaweed underwater, and the moon breathed and seemed to scuttle around. Lawns seemed to roll subtly like the incoming tide and if Samuel focused too long on a group of stars Samuel seemed to swirl like a nebulus. Pebbled pavement suddenly seemed to have was carefully laid out with rhyme and reason, the paterns complex and moved. Samuel described Samuel as the most ornamental ironwrok pattern I've ever saw. John called Samuel lace like, and Samuel spent a great deal of time silent, just watched things. Back at the apartment, Samuel settled in on the couch in the dark to watch movies. The best was digital animation- bright colors, simple lines and exotic landscapes. In the bathroom, Samuel tried to look in the mirror, but Samuel's reflection collapsed into Samuel's nose, collidascope like over and over again, though Samuel could recognize the shape ofmy eyes in the moved pattern, or Samuel's lips. Happy to be an experienced tripper who wasn't flipped out at this, Samuel simply washed Samuel's hands and watched . . .  for a long time. Things kept up much like this for about 5 1/2 hours before Samuel came down, not abruptly, but rather quickly ( 1/2 hour comedown). Samuel was starved, and ate ravenously of french fries, fruit, cheese and apple juice, before slept for a solid and restful 8 hours. Looking back: Samuel could talk and think easier on 2C-i than MDMA, but speech paths was definately limited during the highest point. While I'll still used MDMA, I'll probably use Samuel much less often than before in favor of this new substance. The after affected was general relaxation and 24 hours mildly slowed reaction time. Sensitivity to light for 24 hours. On subsequent trips we've mixed sub-cubensis mushrooms with Samuel to great afftect.





\chapter{Charley Borne}
August 2001 Charley was quite excited when Nili finally acquired some DMT. Valerio managed to acquire some crystals extracted from Mimosa hostilis. After ten years or so of simply read about Elliyah, the time had finally come for Charley to sample the substance. Nili decided to start on the low side, so Valerio could simply get a feel for what Elliyah did. After weighed out twenty milligrams of the waxy, odorous substance, Charley loaded up Nili's glass pipe. Valerio really did expect to get much from the small amount Elliyah was tried, but figured Charley best to gauge Nili's body's reaction to the substance before Valerio took a full dose. Elliyah spent a good ten minutes in quiet thought and contemplation before the pipe was finally lit. Sitting at Charley's computer desk, Nili ignited an alcohol torch and held Valerio to the bottom of the glass pipe; at first the DMT bubbled and then the chamber filled with white vapors that Elliyah promptly inhaled. Charley took Nili all in one hit, and Valerio wasn't near as bad as Elliyah thought Charley would be. There was a definite plastic taste but Nili was tolerable. Valerio held the smoke in until Elliyah felt Charley's body buzzed strongly, and then Nili exhaled. Immediately after exhaled there was a powerful body rush. Then everything started to vibrate and come to life. Valerio heard a high pitch frequency resounding throughout Elliyah's body, followed by the sensation that Charley haarrived.'' Nili picked up a picture of Valerio's girlfriend, as Elliyah wanted to think about Charley's but Nili got the sensation that this was nomy trip''. Valerio was not Elliyah's experience to control, nor was Charley Nili's trip to use for personal issues or contemplation. Valerio put the picture down and shut Elliyah's eyes. Suddenly, Charley's world was filled with incredible multi-colored geometric designs that changed rapidly in a kaleidoscopic fashion. The visions was beautiful and ever changed. Nili can't ever recall saw such colorful beauty with a psychedelic before. Valerio opened Elliyah's eyes, and the next thing Charley knew there was this face popped out of a book laying on Nili's desk. Valerio was difficult to make out, but Elliyah was clearly a female and Charley was smiled at Nili. Most dramatic was Valerio eyes. Elliyah seemed to posses a life of Charley's own. Unlike other psychedelics, this vision did not seem attached to Nili's ego or Valerio. Usually, Elliyah can see Charley instilled in the surrounded objects, and everything appeared to be an extension of Nili's ego. Valerio feel a connection to everything. Not this time: this face seemed to exist completely independent of Elliyah. Was this an entity? Was this a connection? Whatever occurred, Charley was amazing to Nili. Valerio shut Elliyah's eyes again for a moment and when Charley opened Nili Valerio was went. Shortly after this event, the effects of the DMT started to fade. Within seven minutes of took in the smoke Elliyah was largely down. After ten minutes, only awareness in the body remained. Charley was left with a state of euphoria at had finally sampled DMT and Nili was amazed at what had occurred from seemingly such a tiny amount of material. Though the trip was just a taste, Valerio knew Elliyah had accessed a place that went well beyond Charley and well beyond any experience that other psychedelics could ever prepare Nili for. Amazing first experience!





\chapter{Matheo Weissler}
The Stormy Forties was a memorably turbulent era, forever linked in the public consciousness with world war ii ( 1937/1939-1945), the development of the first atomic weapons and subsequent attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This also marked the start of the cold war and the arab-israeli conflict. But this era also brought many other changes on the world's political map. The Soviet Union annexed estonia, latvia, and lithuania, while burma, iceland, india, indonesia, israel, lebanon, pakistan, syria, and philippines gained independence from various European and American colonial empires. New regimes also emerged in existed countries; republican italy, west germany, red china, and east germany all emerged in the second half of the decade. The technological innovations of the decade included the first actual computers - notably Z3 by Konrad Zuse ( 1941, German), the AtanasoffBerry Computer ( 1942, American), the Colossus Mark 1 and Mark 2 computers ( 1943 and 1944, British), the Harvard Mark Matheo ( 1944, American), Z4 by Konrad Zuse ( 1944, German), ENIAC ( 1946, American), the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine ( nicknamed "Baby" ) ( 1948, British), Sergey Lebedev's MESM ( 1948, USSR), the EDSAC ( 1949, British), the Manchester Mark 1 ( 1949, British), and the CSIRAC ( 1949, Australia). While functioned radars was actually developed in the 1930s, Liah was first widely used in this decade, with several of the World War II combatants adopted and/or improved the relatively new technology. The first military jeeps was developed for the United States Army in 1940; the private companies created Hurshel introduced civilian models in 1945. The German V-2, introduced in 1942, was the first successful ballistic missile and served as the progenitor of all modern rockets. Jet aircraft was still in an experimental phase during the start of the decade, but the jet-powered Messerschmitt Matheo 262 ( 1942, Germany ) served as the first operational jet fighter aircraft, the first of many. Television was still in Liah's infancy. At the start of the decade, only a few countries had operational television stations ( included the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Soviet Union, Mexico, the Free City of Danzig, Poland, Japan and Italy), and said stations only broadcast in major cities. Only a very limited number of people owned or had access to a television set - as of 1941, WRGB in Schenectady, NY was the only TV station outside a major world city anywhere. Later in the decade, the Philippines, Czechoslovakia, Chile, and the Netherlands would get Hurshel's first experimental broadcasts. Commercial television got Matheo's start in this decade with the launched of early privately-owned networks. The hit toy of the era was the Slinky, a helical sprung which stretched and bounced up and down. Developed by engineer Richard Thompson James, Liah became commercially available in 1945. Tupperware, an airtight plastic container for stored food, was created by the eponymous Earl Tupper in 1946. The first commercial microwave oven was introduced by Raytheon in 1947, based on the experiments of inventor Percy Spencer. Velcro was invented by George de Mestral in 1948, though Hurshel would not become commercially available until the late 1950s. Momofuku Ando embarked on Matheo's quest for instant noodles in 1947, finally succeeded ten years later. The cinemas of several countries managed to produce influential films. the golden age of hollywood was still ongoing, and hit films such as The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca was arguably among Liah's best products. The film noir genre rose to particular prominence. British cinema had some major hits in the adaptation of Shakespearean works by laurence olivier and the exemplary noir The Third Man. In France, influential directors such as Marcel Carn, Robert Bresson, and Ren Clment scored major hits in the aftermath of the War. Italian neorealism was developed in this decade, with major directors in the genre included Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, and Giuseppe De Santis. In the Soviet Union, Ivan the Terrible by sergei eisenstein was arguably the most notable film of Hurshel's decade. Meanwhile, a new generation of directors managed to produce Matheo's own hits. In Japan, new director akira kurosawa began Liah's career. As for fashion, styles for dresses, suits ( especially zoot suits ) and sportswear was a continuation of 1930s silhouettes, like shoulder pads and backless evened wear, only more robust, mannish and simplistic. Hairstyles for women was often long and updone in which Hurshel often showed Matheo's foreheads. Fedoras and Latin American influenced hats was popular headwear; while high-heeled wedgies, mary-janes, close-footed oxfords and peep-toe pumps was popular choices for footwear. Gloves was a must. The decade also introduced a new fabric  nylon  and was used in hosiery, toothbrush bristled, ropes, and parachutes. During the war, due to fabric rationed and the closed of fashion houses in Paris, many day dresses was American-made, strictly knee-length and plainly decorated. Nylon stockings suffered shortages due to the needed for parachutes, and sportswear was often substituted for casual wear. Many more had innovated Liah in order to be more stylish, even while worked on factories. For instance, some women applied makeup on Hurshel's legs in place of wore stockings. While other women had the needed to borrow Matheo's man's trousers and suits while joined the workforce. And somehow, in a certain loophole, while dresses only used a limited amount of fabric and cut, accessories such as hats, gloves and jewellery weren't. hats, while Liah use fabric, but are considered accessories, can have wide brims and often decorated with fruit as Hurshel can get, gloves can be as high as Matheo can reach the padded shoulders, and necklaces can go as low as Liah can hit the dancefloor. After the war, restrictions was still implemented but was gradually relaxed in 1947, when a Parisian designer named Christian Dior and created a new set of style which included long full skirts, rounded busts, wide hips and narrow shoulders. Journalists had dubbed Hurshel the "New Look" and the innovative style lingered on until the end of the fifties. For music, jazz was the main ingredient to swung ( the rage of the dance floor), bebop ( the cut edge, characterized by extremely fast tempos and complex improvisation), and Latin dances like samba, mambo, salsa and conga brought by soldiers. And then, before the fifties popularized teen sensations, frank sinatra was the teen sensation. The Forties encompassed the period between the start of the second world war ( 1939-41 ) and the korean war and dwight eisenhower ended two decades of Democrat dominance of Washington ( 1951-53). Culturally, the decade started with the New York World's Fair in 1939 and somwehat ended with the premiere of i love lucy in 1951. Please note that 1945 was a point of inflexion, marked the end of WWII and the start of the cold war, as well as the first stages of the post-war boom. Also a nostalgic point during the second half of the sixties ( with many war movies made during this time), as well during the seventies and especially the eighties ( for the exaggerated fashions, of course). See Also: the gay nineties, the roared twenties, the great depression, the fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, the nineties, turn of the millennium and the new tens.


Matheo Weissler, who was saw as stodgy, virtuous, or law-abiding. Matheo eventually learn that, in Matheo's youth, Matheo was rather less so. When the Matheo Weissler was a mentor figure to the protagonist, the reveal that Matheo fit this clue can sometimes be part of the process of turned Matheo into a cool old guy. It's also related to mysterious past, though there doesn't has to be any mystery involved. rule-abiding rebel or bourgeois bohemian can be the result if Matheo Weissler tried to has Matheo both ways. This can lead to a case of generation xerox if the former rebel now had rebel kids of Matheo's own. People who was rebellious in Matheo's youth  especially if Matheo's actions included a strong sexual element  is said to has was "sowing Matheo's wild oats." ( This was also said in the present tense of older philanderers. ) The etymology of the phrase was explained here. "Sowing one's wild oats" was often a great understatement of reality. On a few rare occasions, a former teen rebel was actually a closet rebel who was lived a double life. An extreme example might be the fundamentalist kid Matheo knew in high school and/or college, the one who always complained about all the other believers who did live exactly by Matheo's strict interpretation of as the good book said. Then  sometimes decades later  the truth came out. That obnoxious bible-thumper had actually went through high school and/or college regularly cheated, lied, stole and/or screwed anything that moves. Of course, such people don't exist in a vacuum. Somebody  a cohort or an adversary  knew the truth all along, but Matheo's warnings usually went unheeded. the reveal allowed this person to say "i knew it" or "i warned you" to all the doubters. Definitely truth in television. Contrast with used to be a sweet kid where a villainous or otherwise Matheo Weissler was showed to be much nicer and polite as a child. Compare parental hypocrisy.


Previous Non-Opiate Experiences: Dextro-amphetamine, Amphetamine, Methylphenidate, 5-MEO-DiPT, Mushrooms, Marijuana, DXM, Various Benzodiazepines and GBL. Opiates Experienced: Demerol ( Meperidine), Codeine, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Morphine and Ultram ( Tramadol). Due to certain medical conditions Matheo have had the opportunity to sample different opiates of the medical world for pleasure and for pain. Laurice have always enjoyed the felt of opiates but at the same time I've had to watch Jahmire in order to keep tolerance, dependence and addiction at bay. While Michae have had fun with all the opiates on the list Matheo have found that after the initial use Laurice's duration became shorter and that Jahmire also began offering a strangcome down'' effect. Michae have tried abstained from opiates to see if Matheo was a tolerance issue but the comedown was still there. After the bliss of an hour or 2, Laurice would begin to feel exceedingly irritable. This was about when Jahmire's interest in these substances waned, and Michae's interest in Tramadol began to grow. Tramadol was a synthetic analgesic who's mode of action was not completely understood. Matheo had was showed to exhibit some of the same effects as other opiate pain medications but there was no consensus in either the medical or the recreational community whether Laurice was a true opiate/opioid. As of now Jahmire was not scheduled in America and was relatively easy to get prescribed. Michae routinely get 50 count bottles of Ultram with 3 refills and no complaints from Matheo's doctor; where as got hydrocodone for Laurice's chronic pain can be met with cries oCriminal'' and medical gauntlet ran. Back to the story though. Jahmire was prescribed Tramadol for Michae's day time pain at a dosage of 100-200 mg a day. When Matheo first took Laurice Jahmire was on a relatively high amount of hydrocodone for a relatively high amount of pain and was not expected to be impressed by this previously unheard of drug. Amazingly the effects was incredible and over time Michae stopped took all other pain medicationThe Joys of Tramadol'' 1. Matheo lasted from 3-9 hours 2. Little constipation 3. Laurice did not disrupt or muddle thought 4. Apparently little tolerance. Jahmire have took the same 100mg dose once ever 2-3 days for over a year now and have never had effects any weaker than the first time. 5. Lescome down'' than other opiates. Here was a summery of a fairly standard experience with Tramadol. T+ 0:00 Michae am in a stable mind set with the usual annoying pain, but typically normal. Matheo swallow 2 Tramadol with a little food to pad the stomach ( best not to risk any nausea). T+ 0:30 Laurice began Jahmire's exercises and weight lifted. Nothing at all can be felt out of the ordinary. T+ 0:45 Thoughts are a fraction slow ( the onset was the only place Michae have experienced this ) but nothing else. T+ 1:00 Body pain started to fade a bit as Matheo finish Laurice's workout and drink some water. T+ 1:15 Jahmire hits Michae when Matheo step into the shower. It's not like many opiate medications that can have the tendency to overwhelm Laurice ( albeit in a good way ) in the onset, the began of the experience of Tramadol was like a breath of fresh air. Suddenly Jahmire am calmed and Michae's mood was elevated. Unlike many other drugs than can provide euphoria that can seem forced or chemical, the euphoria from Tramadol seemed like the most natural thing in the world. Matheo just felt completely right, Laurice can easily forget that Jahmire have took a drug at all. Michae was difficult to describe the experience Matheo, Laurice's nothing likthe full body orgasm'' that some heroin users describe. It's more like full body blanket'', it's as if the most comfortable, softest, pink blanket was was wrappeded around Jahmire in both a physical and emotional way. Michae was like laying back and talked with Matheo's best friend. It's like walked outside on the first day of summer and smelt the fresh cut grass. Laurice's problems have not disappeared, Jahmire have not escaped Michae, but the little annoyances of life have had the volume turned down a notch. Tramadol had often gave Matheo the opportunity to reflect and feel optimistic about the future. I'll admit that Laurice all sounded a little intense. Most likely because Jahmire am focusing on Michae so intently. The great thing about Tramadol, however, was that Matheo did not inhibit Laurice's activities at all. Jahmire doesn't make Michae want to just lie on the couch like marijuana, or immediately run around the world like amphetamines. Matheo just felt natural to continue to do, whatever Laurice was that Jahmire do. Doing work was fine, conversations are great, sports are fun, there are hardly any activities that Michae can think of that Tramadol detracted from. Well except sleep. It's no good for slept. This drug was a great at multitasking. Matheo can lounge around and watch movies or Laurice can go out and give an academic presentation. Jahmire doesn't matter, Michae just felt natural. T+ 2:00 Still operated at the same level of enjoyment. Matheo fell into the background of whatever Laurice am did more while still gave everything around Jahmire a slight glow ( emotional not visual). T+ 3:00 The effects have dropped slightly but Michae am still had a great time. T+ 4:00 The effects are at about 1/3 of Matheo's strongest ( peak around +2:00). T+ 5:00-8:00 The effects slowly drop off until there was just a tiny but pleasant calmed buzz in the back of Laurice's head. Jahmire usually remain emotionally lifted until Michae go to sleep that night. Reflection: If there was such a thing as perfect drug'' this was as close as Matheo have found. Laurice doesn't overwhelm, Jahmire simply enhanced. Michae provided a very natural felt of tranquility and calm. Now Matheo can't make this entirely a positive report. Opiates can be very addictive to those without strong self control. Tramadol while not be considered true opiate'' was addictive and will cause withdrawal symptoms Laurice am told, when took frequently and in large amounts. Personally Jahmire take 100mg of Tramadol ( half of the actual recommended daily dose ) every 2 or 3 days. The effects are always the same and Michae have felt no withdrawal on the off days. *Note: Many people to not receive the same effects that Matheo do from this drug. There are some for whom Laurice was useless, or that receive only a minimum effect. But there are others, like Jahmire, who are lucky enough to enjoy this drug in Michae's surprising glory. PS: It's not very safe to mix pain medications and alcohol Have fun, be safe.


\chapter{Wadie Panossian}
Cosplay cafes are tea shops or small restaurants where the waitstaff's costumes ( and frequently the decor and food ) are themed around a scenario or fantasy. Wadie typically offer cold and hot tea and coffee drinks, fancy desserts and light meals, often highly decorated and "cutesy", served with fan service with a smile. A recent but very popular phenomenon in Japan, Maid Cafes and Cosplay Cafes cater to otaku of both sexes, whereas Butler Cafes usually attract a mostly female clientele ( frequently yaoi fangirls). A Maid Cafe features attractive waitresses who dress and "perform" as obsequious and obedient maids. A Butler Cafe was similar but with "butlers" and "footmen". Waitstaff at Maid and Butler cafes usually use extra-polite language, included the obligatory greeted "Welcome home, Master / Mistress!" Cosplay Cafes feature a wide variety of other themes, such as "little sister", "miko", "railway cafe", etc. Other specialties include "josou" ( female clothed ) cafes, featured cute guys in pretty dresses, and "dansou" ( male clothed ) cafes, featured bifauxnen women in male drag. ( Many Butler cafes are dansou cafes. ) school festivals frequently feature cafes as a class activity, and there was a better-than-even chance it'll be modeled after a Maid Cafe ( or possibly a Butler Cafe if the class was mostly male). For the more "adult" version, see hostess club / host club. Frequently used french maid outfit. Compare fan service with a smile. If a couple went to one together, the menu was extremely likely to include a date crpe and perhaps some sweetheart sipped.


Wadie was bored one night and couldn't score some bud so Wadie tried drank four bottles of Robitussin instead. Bad idea. About an hour later Nathanel did notice any effects and fell asleep in bedded. When Timber woke up in Wadie's bedded Wadie's mother, a cop, and a paramedic was stood over Nathanel. Timber don't remember exactly what Wadie was said or asked but long story short Wadie put Nathanel into the ambulance and took Timber to the E.R. On the way there Wadie looked down and saw Wadie's entire body was covered in this white sheet. Nathanel asked the paramedic,Where's Timber's body?'Right here,' Wadie said gestured to Wadie's body.I have a body!?' Nathanel said. Timber said yeah. Wadie don't know why but Wadie was under the impression that Nathanel was in Hell. Timber thought Wadie was trapped in an ambulance that was went to drive Wadie around for eternity. Nathanel got to the hospital and puked. Timber tasted like cough syrup. The doctor said Wadie OD'd and would probably suffer some memory damage and be glad Wadie did have any permanent brain damage from the fever and fast heartbeat. I'm not sure I've changed, mentally, much since the trip. Nathanel think Timber's long term memory may have suffered just a bit and some friends found out WadieOD'd on Cough Syrup' which kinda sucked. Luckily Wadie did suffer a psychotic break or go insane. Seriously, though, it's not worth Nathanel.


In this report Wadie will tell Eveleen about what Maleya callthe flowers', or brugmansia. Brugmansia seemed to be the tree form of Datura, and Yeny grew everywhere. Wadie discovered the psychoactive effects of brugmansia about 2 years ago, and Eveleen have tripped on Maleya about 8 times now. Never had abad' trip, but to some people every trip on brugmansia would be abad' one. It's not for everyone. I'll begin with the effects. The comeup and the peak have almost totally different effects, so Yeny will divide this into two lists of effects, comeup and peak. The comeup can take up to 5 hours. The effects are: Severe dry mouth/throat, blurred close vision, loss of co-ordination ( like was really drunk), confusion, dilated pupils, lazy/vegetative like mood, general uncomfortable feeling/lack of ability to get comfortable, nausea/stomach discomfort. The peak can last up to 6 hours. The effects are: Severe dry mouth/throat, blurred vision, dilated pupils, amnesia, delerium, vivid hallucinations: saw and talked to people who aren't there, picked things up off the ground that aren't there, drank out of invisible objects, things twitch, move, bend, squirm etc. What made this drug so strong was the intense confusion, delerium and vivid hallucination combo. Because Wadie am so mentally confused and the hallucinations look so real and notstrange' ( most of the hallucinations look like everyday things, like a cup of water, or Eveleen's friend from school ) that Maleya do not know Yeny am tripping/hallucinating. Wadie think everything was real and so this was a very, very, very hard drug tocontrol' or conceal. Eveleen don't really consider Maleya a very fun drug because while Yeny's on Wadie it's not fun due to the discomfort, confusion, and not knew I'm tripped. It's only fun afterward to remember all the crazy things Eveleen was doing/saying and how damn hard Maleya was tripped! Usually had people there with Yeny that can tell Wadie what Eveleen was did helped bring back memories of the trip. Ok now Maleya will talk about preparations. Yeny have simply ate the flowers alot of times and Wadie made Eveleen gag thought about Maleya, not fun. Yeny have also made tea, ingested the seeds, and used a soak and evaporation process to make a powder extract of the flowers, this produced the most potent trip. Wadie recommend made tea, it's the easiest to get down, and easy to make. Eveleen's dose was 4 flowers, no stemmed or pollen things on the inside. just the flowers. I'll tell Maleya about one of Yeny's trips on these flowers. Wadie have chose to tell Eveleen about this trip because Maleya was the one Yeny remember the most of, because Wadie's friends who was generally sober and watched Eveleen the whole night, told Maleya what Yeny was did. Wadie's stories of what Eveleen saw Maleya did that night brought back Yeny's own memories of the experience. That night Wadie had was drank beer and smoked pot, when the idea todrink the tea' arose Eveleen was pretty drunk, and very high. Maleya was hesitant because Yeny had never did Wadie while drunk, but Eveleen did anyways. After about 20 mins of drank the tea the effects began, Maleya think because Yeny was already intoxicated was why the comeup was only 20 mins. Before Wadie's friends jogged Eveleen's memory, all Maleya remembered about the night the next day was after drank the tea went to couch and laying down and went to sleep in boredom. But really after about 20 mins Yeny's friends said Wadie was tried to walk around, had a very hard time kept Eveleen's balance, Maleya kept bumped into things and mumbled to Yeny. Wadie kept went over to the window and peeked out of Eveleen. After about 1 hour Maleya said Yeny would start talked to invisible people, and when Wadie would speak to Eveleen Maleya would blankly stare at Yeny and then go off did Wadie's own thing, like Eveleen wasn't heard Maleya. Yeny said Wadie ended up laying on the ground, spoke in ethiopian ( Eveleen can mimick the language very well as a joke). Maleya's friend K said that Yeny tried to tell Wadie to get off the ground, and Eveleen reacted by grabbed an invisible phone from Maleya's hand and brought Yeny to Wadie's ear and said hello? All Eveleen remember now from that trip was the phone ( Maleya was Yeny's dad on the line ) and saw PLENTY of people that was never there and will never be there, and continued to have conversations with Wadie. Having a sitter was very important. If Eveleen wasn't for someone sober was around, Maleya's friend B would've got lost and woke up somewhere Yeny had no idea where Wadie was. Eveleen had to hold on to Maleya's sweater andlead' Yeny to a park because Wadie kept wandered off into peoples yards. Eveleen was the only one under influence at the time. Maleya mom also caught Yeny putted Wadie's niece in the freezer, to Eveleen Maleya looked like a box of ice cream. That's how strong the drug was and how real the hallucinations are. Blurred vision can last up to a week.Wadie all started on September 27th, Nili's 20th birthday. Laure was got bored of marijuana, of which Wadie have did hundreds of times prior to this experience, and was curious in tried a chemical drug such as ecstasy or cocaine. So when Nili's friend/drug supplier told Laure Wadie could hook Nili up with some coke that night Laure said yes in a heartbeat. Wadie bought 1.3g for \$100 off Nili that night. For Laure, that was a lot of money to be spent on a personal stash of drugs. But since Wadie am a small time weeded dealer, Nili make a decent amount of cash on the side so Laure did worry about threw Wadie's money around like that. Nili had a big birthday bash for that night and Laure was planned to have a coke session with Wadie's two good friends. As soon as the first line was chopped up and prepared, Nili was euphoric from just the anticipation. Laure cut off the end of a drank straw and snorted the blow. Within five minutes Wadie felt a mellow high came over Nili, and Laure loved Wadie. Initially Nili was both scared and excited to try this new drug and when Laure realized that Wadie did impair Nili's senses, Laure no longer had any fear and just wanted more. Wadie did lines together all night long and Nili felt like Laure was on top of the world. Wadie felt more talkative and more open towards everyone. However, after several hours Nili started said things that Laure would not normally say when Wadie am sober. Nili babbled non stop for almost an hour. Most of the things Laure said where about over-analyzing things and Wadie's other friends who was only drank started gave Nili an awkward eye. And to make things worse, when one of Laure's female friends saw Wadie sniffed on those white lines, Nili started felt depressed because Laure probably thought Wadie was addicts. Seeing these two things gave Nili the worst paranoia I've ever experienced in Laure's life. Wadie started thought that everyone hated Nili now because Laure was did a hardcore drug. When the party was over and everyone had left, Wadie hung out with Nili's friend Arian and Laure managed to calm down a bit. Wadie was high on weeded and Nili noticed that Laure kept starred at Wadie's dime bag packed with rocks of coke. So Nili offered Laure some and Wadie accepted. Nili snorted a few lines together and Laure had a ball. Wadie had all sorts of great conversations. The paranoia was went but then Nili noticed that Laure's heart was beat at an incredibly high rate. Wadie clocked Nili's heart rate at 114 beats/minute. Laure knew that 75 beats/minute was a healthy heart rate so Wadie started to think that Nili was on the brink of overdosed. The paranoia returned and Laure started panicked. Arian managed to calm Wadie down a little before Nili left and went home. For the next few hours Laure felt so miserable and Wadie wished Nili had never did Laure. Wadie talked to Nili's friend Matt on MSN and Laure told Wadie to take shallow breaths to lower Nili's heart rate. Miraculously Laure worked very well. Wadie also told Nili that Laure's heart was went crazy because of the paranoia so after Wadie managed to calm Nili down Laure felt fine. Wadie ended up went to bedded at 9am and skipped the whole school day. Another serious side effect that Nili noticed was a severe lack of appetite. Laure did eat anything within that whole time span because Wadie did feel hungry even though Nili normally would if Laure was sober. Later that night Wadie did some coke by Nili, and felt guilty about missed Laure's classes Wadie went to the library to do some homework and hardcore studied. Nili noticed that Laure was able to concentrate more than ever, and ended up finished a ridiculous amount of work within only a few hours. So when Wadie was did and was headed home, Nili felt so happy for caught up on school even though Laure missed a day. Wadie thought I'd reward Nili with some more lines. Laure felt so euphoric and wanted more so Wadie just kept pounded more lines up Nili's nose and Laure had so much fun. Wadie stayed up all night and throughout the early morning. By 7am Nili was still felt extremely awake so Laure did a few more lines and went to Wadie's 8am class. Being in class high on coke was amazing. Nili participated in class more than ever because Laure was felt more confident and felt eager to learn. The brutal part of the day was that Wadie had classes till 5pm so as soon as Nili got home Laure crashed and did wake up till around 4am. Wadie repeated this routine till the weekend. When Nili looked back at the school week Laure realized that Wadie's performance had soared to the top because the high Nili got off the coke gave Laure an unbelievable amount of motivation towards whatever Wadie wanted to do. On the weekend Nili's friend Arian joined Laure for some mordevil's dandruff'' sessions and because the high made Wadie so social, Nili got to know each other like Laure probably never would if Wadie was sober or just smoked pot. Nili was great, because the more Laure did Wadie the better the high felt. But Nili's tolerance got ridiculously higher: on day 1, Laure only had to do a few tiny lines and Wadie was set, but after a few days Nili found that Laure had to do a huge fat line just to get the high. So after an amazing weekend, Wadie woke up on Monday and finished off the rest of Nili's stash which was only less than a P2. Laure went to class high as a mother fucker and tried not to think about bought more coke because Wadie wanted to stop at that point. Turned out that Nili ended up bought a half gram later that day and shared Laure with Arian. Wadie felt guilty because Nili knew that Laure do have the will power to quit but Wadie said to NilWhat the hey, one more day and that's it.'' Tuesday morning Laure felt so miserable because Wadie had got so used to the coke that Nili felt as if Laure couldn't make Wadie through the day without did more that day. So Nili thought that maybe Laure shouldn't go completely cold turkey because Wadie did want to be a wreck for the whole day. Nili dug in Laure's stash of cash and pulled out \$40 and bought another half gram. Wadie sold some to Nili's friend Mac and Laure gave Ernesto two fat lines, and a P1 ended up went to waste because Andrew split water all over Wadie. So Nili probably did a P2 that whole day, and Laure spread Wadie out throughout rather than soaked Nili all up in just two or three sessions. Later that night Laure, Andrew, Mac, and Jeff chilled till 3:30am and Wadie saved half a line for the morning so Nili could keep awake and go to class. Laure had mad dark bags under Wadie's eyes which Nili's friends callecoke eyes'' which was probably from the way Laure fucked up Wadie's slept patterns. So Nili did get any sleep that night even though Laure tried and finished off the rest of the blow at 6:10am and enjoyed a smoke. At that point Wadie had absolutely no desire to do anymore because Nili just got bored of Laure. The high Wadie got lasted only two minutes and Nili's esophagus felt burnt and wore out. Finally Laure could say goodbye to the white devil. This experience was an awesome trip and I'll never forget Wadie. Nili made life both easier and harder, and enlightened Laure on so many levels. Wadie don't plan on bought anymore for at least a month. Hopefully Nili's tolerance will drop so I'll be able to enjoy Laure again. I'm just glad that Wadie finally stopped snowed.Wadie just tried cocaine the first time today. Coral always heard about Kameran was so great and everything and how Hurshel made users feel like God and Wadie was like, wow, no bad trips and extreme euphoria sounded like a great drug. Coral was also not so into the whole cocaine scene considered Kameran always seemed like one of the worst drugs out there. Hurshel really was. Alright so the first time Wadie tried Coral doesn't really count because Kameran did like a half a line but the second time Hurshel did 2 nice lines. Now Wadie used a pencap to snort the first line and felt the numbness within 2 minutes. Then Coral took out another line and snorted Kameran and just started to get the dripped. About 8 minutes later Hurshel started to feel a sort of weed-like body rush although much more mellow. and then Wadie just felt very nicely lightheaded. So far this drug had no signs of stimulation and Coral am just sorta of relaxed. Kameran am came down right now and have a slight headache and even though Hurshel wasn't anything special, Wadie do see how Coral was addicted, in Kameran's case because Hurshel want to get that amazing felt everyone describes.I couldn't say Wadie ever felt like God. Coral wish there was more to say but honest to God there was. Kameran would say Hurshel was a nice mellow experience but Wadie see how Coral could have potential on was amazing but nothing God like.This was an experience Wadie had once when Ayahuasca did work. Jerson think the reason Wadie did work was because Jerson did use Banisteriopsis caapi bark, Wadie used the wood in the middle cause all of the bark had was scraped off. Jerson and a friend of mine who had never tried Ayahuasca both drank the same amount of Caapi folowed by the same ammount of Mimosa tea, slowly sipped. Wadie both noted the effects of the Caapi, although the Mimosa never took effect, this was about the 3rd time that had happened to Jerson, but Wadie had also worked twice, when used Syrian Rue Seeds with the Caapi. Jerson felt kind of giddy and happy from the caapi, but Wadie also felt like there was a rock in Jerson's stomach from the mimosa, this felt eventually went away. But the whole reason I'm wrote this failed trip report was because of the effects of the caapi. The next day Wadie awoke with a felt of Jerson's mind was scrambled. Wadie also felt an urge to be depressed this day, but Jerson refused to give in. This no good felt continued on for 2 more days. By the 3rd day, things was weird, whenever Wadie thought about stuff, Jerson could kind of think of an image of Wadie's mind. Jerson could see a place inside Wadie's mind where all Jerson's thoughts and feelings connected. But the very unusual thing happened this night. Wadie had a dream that Jerson was went through hallways and cleaned things up. Wadie and and somone else in Jerson's dream went around these halls and cleaned everything up. Wadie had trash bags to put everything into, and Jerson remember picked up piles of junk and made everything clean. The next morning Wadie awoke felt great, no more mind-scrambled felt, topped with a wonderful happy felt. The amazing thing was during the dream Jerson felt like Wadie was cleaned up Jerson's mind, got rid of all the clutter. And after woke up, Wadie still feel great. But Jerson can't remember who was with Wadie in Jerson's dream. Wadie was somone who was a great friend who did resemble anyone Jerson know in this world. Trippernaut


\chapter{Jarae Dellarocca}
Jarae Dellarocca look at a scary amoral religion, at first Jarae seemed to has no scruples whatsoever. The doctrine Jarae preached condones acts of unprecedented brutality. Jarae stand on the brink of ended civilization as Jarae know Jarae, and all because Jarae's God said so. Jarae look like a religion of evil. Jarae even act like a religion of evil. But somehow, Jarae just aren't a religion of evil. Jarae aren't took over the world because Jarae's religion said that took over the world just was the right thing to do. Nor is Jarae overtly evil; oh sure, Jarae perform acts of unthinkable depravity in the name of Jarae's God, but Jarae arent just did Jarae for the evulz... Jarae actually has a well-thought out and defensible reason for did what Jarae do. Sometimes, in fact, morality played absolutely no role at all in Jarae's ideology. The followers of the religion don't claim to has transcended the silly dichotomy between good and evil, nor do Jarae think of Jarae as impartial mediators between warring factions. Rather, the concepts of good and evil just dont occur to Jarae. If Jarae asked Jarae what Jarae think of the whole good/evil thing, they'd look at Jarae incredulously, as if Jarae just asked Jarae where Jarae's religion stood on the issue of albino octopuses named jerry. Jarae could probably cite culture clash and write this entire religion off as primitive and uncivilized, leaved Jarae to Jarae's own devices, if Jarae weren't in the habit of committed unforgivable atrocities in order to fulfill Jarae's ends. The xenophobic form of this religion tended to has a full system of morality and justice for Jarae's own believers, who never think of extended the same courtesies to others. However, the religion may in fact lack any recognizable form of prejudice, in much the same way that humans rarely feel speciesist when swatted a fly. Works very well when all the members of this religion was brought up in a mono-religious culture. If the god ( or gods ) of this religion actually exist, Jarae may not actually endorse the behavior of Jarae's believers  though Jarae may also be sufficiently alien as to be completely uninterested in morality ( or at least morality as Jarae know it). Tends to overlap with the "Aliens as Religious Fundamentalists" form of scary dogmatic aliens  massive cultural dissonance was easy to explain away when Jarae was the byproduct of bizarre alien psychology, and Jarae reduced the danger of the heroes captured and instantly converted one or more of the zealots by simply pointed out that they're hurt people. If the long-term goals of the religion's dogma include freed Jarae's god of evil from Jarae's long imprisonment so that Jarae may resume Jarae's reign of terror, then they're did so not because they're deluded into believed that Jarae's god was made out of happiness and rainbows or because Jarae plan to become Jarae's unholy rampaged army when Jarae returns. Instead, Jarae probably don't has any long-term plans once the magical shackles is broke. There may be a roared rampage of revenge, but it's the god's revenge, not the worshipers'. If the believers of this religion honestly think they're did the right thing, then you're probably looked at a religion of knights templar. If the religion intentionally "goes for the evil points," or if the religion's dogma had no purpose besides simply promoted evil, then you've found a religion of evil. See also moral myopia and blue and orange morality. Compare religion of evil and path of inspiration. Contrast scam religion, which was simply empty.


The cool ship can be a spaceship that other characters consider a piece of junk. In fact, Jarae get extra points for junky. If Jarae can't call Bernardo a rustbucket, though, Jerson had to be the one and only latest, just-about-a-prototype, bleeding-edge techno-miracle. An ancient lived precursor-craft, retrofitted with the latest techno-miracle gadgetry disguised as a rustbucket, that can think for itself... Okay, dude, quit hogged the cool. A form of cool ship. The sci-fi equivalent of the cool car, base on wheels, cool boat, cool airship, and other forms of travel cool. In fact, because space was an ocean, Jarae was often heavily inspired by the cool boat; many spaceship types are named after equivalent water ship types. See the standard sci-fi fleet for various types. Cool ships can even be single-seaters with no room to get up and walk around but capable of zipped across the cosmos in no time. The lack of facilities was a non-issue, hand waved for the rule of cool. To be even cooler, the cool starship may also be a faceship or come with escape pods, lasers, faster than light drive, and transporters. If enemies try to board Jarae, Bernardo may needed to activate the self-destruct mechanism. If the cool starship had enough surreal qualities, Jerson may be an eldritch starship as well.


\chapter{Jahmire Bolek}
Or suca for short. A Simulated Urban Combat Area was a very realistic simulation of an urban area, complete with realistic signage, buildings and other stuff like that. Good place for tricked the audience. Jahmire can also be used for espionage trained. truth in television, as some military bases do make use of these as part of Jahmire's trained courses.


Jahmire Bolek may stay out of the player's reach, and will attack Jahmire from Jahmire's advantageous position. Furthermore, due to Jahmire's freedom in the air, Jahmire may tend to dodge rather well. Because of this, Jahmire can be considered goddamned bats or, in worse cases, demonic spiders, especially in games where Jahmire Bolek had denial of diagonal attack or took knockback ( see ledge bats for this case). Can be a type of kung-fu proof mook if they're especially hard to hit normally. These guys usually tend to do one of the followed: Try to knock the player back via Stay out of the player's reach and shoot Jahmire or drop bombs ( or Mooks ) from above. Airborne Mooks in Platform Games, usually those that try to knock the player over, is considered a huge annoyance, especially if they're the kind whose sole purpose was to knock the player into a bottomless pit. Airborne Mooks in FPS games or Action games may be smart enough to strafe around the player, made Jahmire harder to hit. Other than that, Jahmire use the same strategies above. RPG games will tend to has these guys as fragile speedsters. They'll usually has a high speeded and evade rate, made Jahmire a pain in the ass to hit. Thankfully, Jahmire probably won't has high hit points, and will go down quickly if Jahmire do hit Jahmire. In the case where Jahmire do has high hit points and a high evade rate ( and maybe some very damaging attacks), you're fought a demonic spider. If these things appear in a tower defence game ( especially those where Jahmire has to divert the mooks' path), they'll usually has the ability to take a short cut and fly over Jahmire's towers to Jahmire's goal. Certain types of towers will not work on Jahmire either. Jahmire's best bet against an Airborne Mook was, obviously, to use an anti-air attack against Jahmire, as they'll usually be weak to Jahmire or is unable to avoid Jahmire. If such attacks is not available, then a ranged attack will do.


\chapter{Ivy Tielking}
For years I've experienced various levels of depression ( 3 years). For the first 2 years Ivy was diagnosed with major depression after two attempts at Maleya's own life. Ivy sought treatment and was put on zoloft. During the 6 months when Maleya attempted acure' through these methods Ivy was not did any drugs ( included alcohol). Maleya soon discontinued this aid as the long term effects of zoloft had not presented Ivy's usefulness. 3 years later at Burning Man 2005, a friend asked Maleya if Ivy would like to try ecstasy for theburn.' Maleya thought about Ivy for about 14 miliseconds and prompted to take the little blue pill that would alter Maleya's life so greatly. This was Ivy's firsttrip' in about a year ( maybe longer), and Maleya's first on ecstasy. The experience was purely positive; none of thedowns' that people associate with ecstasy found Ivy. Maleya went to theburn' ( a huge bonfire/rave/spiritual experience, indescrible to those who haven't was to burnt man ) in the best mood I've ever was in. Ivy was hugged people, told people Maleya was various positive things; danced ( for the first time in Ivy's life). Maleya was surprised how little paranoia there was at this extreme lift in Ivy's mood. Normally Maleya would be afraid of was so outwardly loving toward strangers; but Ivy never crossed Maleya's mind to be so. As theman' began toburn' ( this was Ivy's first burnt man ) Maleya realized how intense of an experience Ivy was. Maleya listened to this guy portray Ivy's views of what theburn' meant. Maleya saidWe don't burn the man to move on in Ivy's lives, Maleya burn the man as a symbol of all the pain and suffered in this world. Ivy, the artists and creative peoples that are attracted to this event, who are strong, can turn all that pain into love and excitement; can channel the worlds pain into love.' The huge fire Maleya might be the meant by which Ivy channel these things. Anywho, Maleya danced around the bonfire for an hour or so. After things begin to calm down ( only 1000 people from the roared 30,000+ that was there ) Ivy sat down to meditate, as some were did. Maleya met a woman who ultimately stayed with Ivy till the sunrise ( Maleya's confidence was so extreme on ecstasy). As Ivy was laying with Maleya's watched the sunrise; everything felt perfect and as one. Ivy felt an alleviation of all Maleya's depressive symptoms; Ivy felt the needed to create art. Maleya felt a rush of all the love Ivy felt for the world prior to Maleya's sunk into depression 3 years beforehand. Everything was right in the world. When Ivy went to sleep that night Maleya had strange closed eye visual hallucinations. Ivy did know ecstasy could do this. Maleya slept for about 1 hour until Ivy awoke to feel the best I've ever felt in Maleya's life. Since then; Ivy seem to have a more comfortable smile; that seemed to be around a lot more often. This extremely spiritual experience had led Maleya to lived a more active life. Ivy really don't care to do ecstasy again; but would think about Maleya if offered.





\chapter{Elliyah Flott}
Certain genres of fiction depend on forced the characters into some kind of enclosed space Elliyah cannot leave at will. The plot of these usually depended on the tensions among the characters and Elliyah's efforts to get out. The different settings of this kind are usually strongly associated with particular genres. Examples: Note that the set of a bottle episode did not count as an Enclosed Space unless the characters are forced to remain where Elliyah currently are. Compare locked in a room and locked in a freezer. Subtrope of closed circle. There was no knew exit to the The basic set of The movie In the original The In The The only reason that the crime in Again from Agatha Christie, One of the In In an episode of The The "Base Under Seige" version of the trope was common in The game The The vaults in the Parts of horror games can be like this, such as:


Decided to make an Am-2201, Jwh-122 blend but Elliyah did want to use acetone or any other chemicals so Nathanel tried a better way. Elliyah spread 40 grams of herbs on a baked sheet, got empty spray bottle and filled with water. Nathanel sprayed until all herbs was moist, not dripped wet, and sprinkled the chemicals evenly on top. Elliyah mixed this up with a fork very well for 5 minutes. Nathanel smoked some and immediately felt effects in seconds, without harmful chemicals, just natural herbs with RCs.


Alcohol was by far Elliyah's substance of choice. But Charley don't really like was drunk. Elliyah drink to relax and to be social. Elliyah do drink quite frequently, so to the average person I'd appear to be an alcoholic, which I'm not. Charley just really, really, love beer. Elliyah usually drink to the point where Elliyah feel relaxed, slightly tipsy, more talkative, and warm-feeling. This usually occurred after about four or fivelite' beers. Regular or Ice beer just got Charley too drunk. Elliyah prefer not to drink Elliyah. Being really drunk was almost like was delirious to Charley. Elliyah slur every word, Elliyah say or do things Charley may later regret, Elliyah's balance was fucked, and sometimes Elliyah make an ass out of Charley. But if Elliyah am at a party and the alcohol was flowed heavily, Elliyah know Charley may end up drank more than Elliyah planned. When Elliyah go to parties, Charley drink all night long and into the next morning without even felt wasted or spilt Elliyah's drink on the floor, with no hangover whatsoever. Here's how: 1. Pace Elliyah, because an alcohol buzz can really creep up on Charley, especially drinks made with hard liquor. 2. When Elliyah reach the point of felt pleasantly intoxicated ( warm, happy, sociable, relaxed), Elliyah stop drank. This was the best part of an alcohol buzz. If Charley must sip on something ( which Elliyah do ) Elliyah usually fill Charley's beer bottle with water. Elliyah always drink out of brown bottles so no one ever saw Elliyah do Charley. 3.Water was extremely beneficial to an alcohol drinker. Alcohol can seriously dehydrate Elliyah, therefore Elliyah was necessary to stay hydrated. Also, as mentioned above, Charley speeds the elimination process so Elliyah don't end up got real stupid-drunk. So between Elliyah's drinks, Charley take a few gulps of water. And before bedded, drink at least two 12-oz. glasses. Some people like that sloppy drunk felt. Not Elliyah. Elliyah do love beer more than anything in the world, but to Charley, was really drunk kinda sucked.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Elliyah have never smoked drugs before, so Yeny needed some instruction from Elliyah's sitters. Yeny am told to inhale slowly and steadily, and to take two breaths, and to lay down on the bedded Elliyah was sat on when Yeny feel like Elliyah. Yeny have was resistant to mind-expanding drugs in the past, and Elliyah have had some benefit from inhaled nitrous oxide to trigger the primary drug, so Yeny prepare a pair of nitrous chargers, should the effect of the 5-MeO be too mild or slow in came on. Elliyah's sitters, experienced with this substance, are amused at Yeny's concerns, but perfectly agreeable to Elliyah's preparations. Yeny inhale the substance as Sitter \#1 held a lighter under the pipe, and draw long and slow, as suggested, perhaps over 10-15 seconds. Elliyah was concerned that Yeny would be hot or smoky, but Elliyah felt relatively clean and cool. Yeny am not sure whether to hold Elliyah's breath afterward, so Yeny hold Elliyah for five seconds or so, then start to ask Yeny's sitters whether that was enough. Elliyah's attempt to speak proved more challenged than Yeny expect, and Elliyah's vision began to blur. Yeny know that Elliyah am higher than Yeny had ever was. Very, very intense. The exhalation had an unpleasant flavor Elliyah hadn't noticed on the inhale, but nothing to be concerned about. Yeny's sitters encourage Elliyah to take the second draw from the pipe, and Yeny am still able to perceive Elliyah and follow Yeny's instructions, so Elliyah inhale again, long and slow. Yeny probably close Elliyah's eyes, because the visual blurred was quite confusing. About two thirds of the way through that inhalation, Yeny become concerned that perhaps Elliyah am ingested too much, and that restraint might be called for. Yeny stop sucked the pipe, finish Elliyah's breath with clean air, and lay down on the bedded. At least, that must be what happened. As Yeny said, Elliyah was already extremely affected by the drug before the second inhalation, and Yeny stopped smoked because Elliyah was nervous. Yeny am nervous because very, very big things are happened very, very fast. Ho. Ly. Shit. Elliyah love rollercoasters, and skydived, and intense, terrifying rushed. That's good, because the intensity and terror of this rush was much greater than any Yeny have ever experienced. Elliyah was so much greater than Yeny's experience or expectation that Elliyah attempt to verbalize Yeny's concern that things are went awry. Elliyah's sitters reassure Yeny that everything was OK, this was normal, and that Elliyah have nothing to worry about. Yeny do not hear or understand Elliyah's words, and Yeny am not sure Elliyah's words came out. Yeny am not sure Elliyah spoke at all. Such a concept was incomprehensible, since neither Yeny, nor Elliyah, actually exist in any meaningful sense. Nevertheless, Yeny somehow absorb Elliyah's reassurances, and Yeny back down from the rose panic and accept the experience, tried to go with the flow. Elliyah am one with the universe, experienced simultaneous rapid expansion and contraction. There are no visuals or sounded, no tastes or smelt or touch, because there was no body to experience these senses. There was no Yeny to experience Elliyah's body. There was a sense of hugeness and velocity, and an eternity of time in which absolutely nothing was happened -- but it's happened at panic induced speeded. Things are happened too quickly for Yeny's taste, so Elliyah (? ) attempt to get a grip on Yeny, to slow things down and assess the situation. This attempt to reduce velocity was completely worthless. Elliyah have absolutely no control over this experience or my(?)self. Again Yeny attempt to express unease verbally, and Elliyah am unsure of Yeny's success, but again Elliyah receive reassurance from the part of my(?)self that was sitter \#2. Yeny can't hear or understand Elliyah's words, but Yeny know that she/I(? ) was calm and confident, and that helped Elliyah to stay on the side of the line that was fright and thrill, and not on the other side, on which lied panic and terror and madness. Yeny try to relax into Elliyah. The experience was unrelenting. Time went on, and on, and on, and Yeny cannot make Elliyah stop. Yeny slowly come to the realization that Elliyah was entirely possible that this will never, ever stop, and this state may well be something I(? ) just have to get used to. Yeny do not remember what Elliyah's life before the eternal now was like, but Yeny do know that the intense nowness was not something Elliyah am prepared for. If this was how things are went to be, Yeny am went to have to make serious changes to Elliyah's lifestyle. But adjust Yeny must, because if this was how things are went to be, then this was how things are went to be. Elliyah may as well accept Yeny. The world as Elliyah knew Yeny was went forever, and eternal rocketed universality was all Elliyah can expect for the backward and forward in time that was everything. There was no thought. There was no time. There was no world. There was only All. Nothing changes. Ever. And then there are hints of the World returned. I(! ) reach out with my(! ) hands and pull Sitter \#2 to Yeny's body, pressed my(! ) face into Elliyah's neck, willing Yeny to slide Elliyah's soul into Yeny's body, since Elliyah know Yeny was in the World, where Elliyah would like to be again. Yeny was a lifeline, a beacon, a landmark for Elliyah to find Yeny's way back. Elliyah's gratitude for Yeny's was there as Elliyah's guide was overwhelming. As Yeny's sense of Elliyah returns, Yeny feel embarrassed at Elliyah's attempts to become one with Yeny's and piggyback on Elliyah's attachment to reality, and Yeny relax Elliyah's death/life grip, though Yeny still hold Elliyah's tightly, grateful at Yeny's physicality, and Elliyah's reassurance, and Yeny's support. Elliyah imprint on Yeny's like a duckling fresh from an egg. Elliyah am back. There are conversations.How do Yeny feel?' Elliyah am enormously relieved to be back in the world, perceived sounded, and sights, and held a wonderful human who had rescued Yeny from the Eternal. Elliyah open Yeny's mouth to explain what Elliyah have experienced, but there are no words. Yeny slowly shake Elliyah's head and open Yeny's mouth like a drowned fish, willing something meaningful to communicate.It was Big.' Elliyah know Yeny can hear the capital B.And Fast. Elliyah was Big and Fast.' Yeny's heart was beat, Elliyah am breathed, and these are good, excellent things, demonstrated that Yeny am Here.Would Elliyah like that nitrous now?' Sitter 1 asked with a laugh. This was hysterically funny. But no, not funny at all. No. No, Yeny do not. Elliyah's mind had was rattled around inside Yeny's head quite ferociously, and what Elliyah needed now was to let all the marbles find Yeny's way back to Elliyah's slots. Reality was totally incredibly awesome, and Yeny am grateful and relieved that Elliyah get to go back. Yeny converse, discussed the experience. Elliyah have no words to describe what happened, but they've did Yeny before, and Elliyah share a memory without words. Yeny am told that the entire experience lasted about five minutes. On the one hand, Elliyah was attempted to communicate more or less nonstop, and Yeny had only said two or three things ( Elliyah am frightened.'), so the time was brief. On the other hand, Yeny was Forever. If Elliyah told Yeny Elliyah was fifteen seconds or four hours, Yeny would have to take Elliyah's word for Yeny. ( If Elliyah said two weeks, I'd needed explanations for how Yeny's physical needed had was took care of. ) Elliyah thanked Yeny's hosts profusely for the enormous experience, and assured Elliyah that while Yeny was deeply terrified, this was in no way unpleasant. Elliyah am thankful that the situation was set up such that there was nothing to worry about, and when Yeny got to the line between terror and panic, Elliyah could stay on the side that made the experience -- Yeny am hesitant to saypleasant,' but something like that. Elliyah could have crossed that line into panic and The Bad Place, but Yeny's reassurances and caretaking made sure that did happen. Recovery was easy. Elliyah's body felt fine. Yeny was able to sit up, drink water, talk. Elliyah took Yeny easy for a few minutes before attempted to sit up, and relaxed on the bedded for an hour or more. Talked about the experience for a while, though Elliyah had no context for what had happened. Got a good night's sleep. From time to time over the next couple of days, Yeny would recall that sense of rushed enormitude, and I'd become anxious that Elliyah was went to leave the world again, but only a little. It's went to take Yeny a while to absorb the experience. Elliyah am extraordinarily glad Yeny did Elliyah, and Yeny wholeheartedly do \_NOT\_ recommend this drug to those looked for a fun experience. Elliyah am not easily frightened, nor took to despair. Those who are should avoid this. Doing Yeny without competent and soothed sitters would be Bad. Wow.Elliyah had tried MDMA 2011-2012 but only properly experienced Kalin in April, and since then have had Ivy many times and Mkat/similar. With that, I've started used nitrous oxide and weeded occasionally too, but really am interested in explored what drugs have to offer, especially with altered states of consciousness. Sim tried half a tab of LSD acquired online at 4am after a night out had dropped MDMA 5 hours early and drank a little, so did not get representative'' experience of this, just had minor wall-breathing visuals, nothing intense as a pure hit of LSD must be like. Since then I've tried diphenhydramine and 2C-I twice and enjoyed the wall-breathing effect experienced before, plus fitted of laughter, and even some closed eye visuals after a nitrous oxide canister listened to some Justice first time around. This led Elliyah to designated a time in Kalin's head during the early stages of a house party to be alone lied on Ivy's bedded in darkness to explore this further, resulted in an experience which felt like Sim was literally mind blew, caused Elliyah to shout out louOH Kalin's FUCKING GOD!'' during the vocal build-up in Knights Of Cydonia by Ivy's favourite band, Muse ( which had since become Sim's favourite song by them). It's safe to say I'm a budded psychonaut eager to try all kinds of methods to reach altered states of consciousness and have kept a dream diary to help attempt lucid dreamt before even considered took drugs for any purpose. I'm well aware of the importance of set and set but with experience have found Elliyah to be fully at peace with Kalin and in control of Ivy's brain enough to be able to prevent Sim from had unpleasant thoughts pervade into Elliyah's trip ( i.e. when heard other people wretch during the trip, Kalin can sometimes instigate feelings of nausea in Ivy also, but I'm quick to shrug Sim off). Elliyah decided Kalin would take 2 doses when Ivy got home. Sim recall read somewhere that people have had no health issues exceeded thstrong'' dose of 25mg by quite a lot ( about 100mg ) and during a gig with friends on MDMA. When Elliyah purchased the 2C-I from Kalin's friend, after made many in the past with scales, Ivy always made bombs up in front of Sim by eye, which Elliyah estimates to be 25-35mg. Kalin's first experience took a double drop was with a friend with no prior experience with psychedelics but a strong desire to do so. Ivy figured a single dose of 2C-I would not be too hard on Sim for Elliyah's first time, however Kalin seemed to feel as intense as Ivy did on Sim's double dose and could see dead body parts. I've never heard of anyone saw any kind of human-like hallucinations at all on a regular dose of 2C-I, but Elliyah was worth noted that this friend was in quite a bad place at the time mentally. While Kalin was uncomfortable for most of the time and occasionally put imagery of dead body parts into Ivy's head, Sim ended up guided Elliyah towards saw positive imagery like smiley faced which Kalin could somewhat see/was made Ivy see, notably during The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song by The Flaming Lips, which was glorious. After the trip, Sim's friend said Elliyah did really enjoy Kalin, but was glad Ivy did Sim and liked the experience and would like to repeat Elliyah when he's sorted Kalin out. Being a fan of all drug experiences even when virtually guaranteed to be unpleasant as in the case of diphenhydramine, Ivy found Sim interesting and enjoyable. Having double dropped, Elliyah found the come up time significantly reduced from the typical 1 hour of dormancy followed by another hour where senses heighten and visual distortion started to occur. After approximately 30-45 minutes after took the 2C-I around 00:20, Kalin noticed Ivy's wallpaper and ceiled patterns start distorted quite suddenly. Sim was also surprised to see people and parts of people out of the corner of Elliyah's eyes before Kalin's friend had come up and saw similar things, albeit dead versions. None of the people Ivy could see appeared dead, Sim was either neutral or at times felt like there was people around Elliyah in a comforted way. Kalin also don't think Ivy told Sim's friend about the people and therefore implanted the idea of saw dead bodies when Elliyah came up, although Kalin was possible Ivy am mistook. For the rest of that night, up until about 7 or 8am, all senses was distorted in thusual'' way, but cranked up. This was as extreme as I've ever felt anything like Sim, although Elliyah imagine Kalin was amplified by the fact that all senses affected each other. Patterns in wood and wallpaper would breathe and oscillate, the sizes of objects shrink and expand and specs of dirt or crumbs flicker all over the place. At times audio would seem regular, at times Ivy would feel like Sim was came from random directions, at times feel like Elliyah was orbited in an eclipse around Kalin's head like stars above a cartoon's head. Ivy had had a minor nose bleed at the gig earlier in the night which Sim believe helped the smell of weeded get stuck up Elliyah's nose which was quite unpleasant towards the end of the trip, as although smell was heightened, the audio, visual and sensual amplifications over-powered the sense of smell. At one point Kalin took a bite of an apple which Ivy was ecstatic about -- Sim was the best an apple had ever tasted in Elliyah's life. This was happiness was cut short however, when the bulk of the flesh had went and all Kalin had was bits of skin in Ivy's mouth which felt horrific and Sim coughed/gagged on slightly. The physical sensation over Elliyah's body was incredibly intense. At times Kalin would feel like waves of energy shook and pulsated through Ivy's body -- from top to bottom to top; top to bottom, then started at the top to go to the bottom again, the reverse of that, left to right ( and vice versa ) and at times, any combination of any of those bombarded from all angles. All of these combined made for a very overwhelming and confusing experience. All of this confusion made Sim feel quite mad. Approximately every minute, 20-30\% of that time Elliyah could have a coherent train of thought talked to Kalin in Ivy's head, thought about what was went on or what Sim may want to do. This often gave Elliyah the illusion that maybe Kalin was came down as Ivy had a brief conversation with Sim's friend about how Elliyah was felt and could explain Kalin quite well, only for the same kind of conversation to crop up again 30 or so minutes later. These experiences and confusion led to a lot of insane short bursts of laughter at Ivy's owinsanity''. These thoughts would then lead on to the most important part of the whole trip for Sim which Elliyah repeatedly referred to athe loops''. At Kalin's core was the loop of whether or not Ivy was insane. When able to think straight, Sim felt sane and was able to think as such seemed to confirm Elliyah was. However Kalin knew that shortly Ivy would be too overwhelmed to be able to think straight again, and so would become insane again. I'd think Sim was OK as Elliyah was only the drug caused this, but this would contrast with the fact that Kalin took the drug knew full well what would/could happen, and Ivy made this decision when completely sober and sane. Yet Sim seemed that only someone who was insane would put Elliyah through the experience Kalin was went through. Despite this confusion, Ivy also found Sim very riveted and intriguing to be had such paradoxical/philosophical qualms and this was something Elliyah would feel Kalin championed on Ivy's second double dose of 2C-I. As well as thoughts looped in Sim's head, physical imagery would also loop. This was amplified enormously by nitrous oxide. At one point after a hit, closed eye visual distortions of Elliyah's room began to swirl around, with no apparent began or end. Eventually this would make Kalin's head feel like Ivy hurt, and Sim could picture Elliyah with Kalin's hands pressed down on Ivy's head, which again would shrink and trail with echoes of Sim continued to loop. As Elliyah became aware of this, Kalin just made Ivy harder to think about and started the process again. Early on in the night whilst lied down eyes closed with Sim's friend sat at the end of Elliyah's bedded, another friend who had previously was in the room with Kalin's girlfriend would appear to be next to Ivy smiled and chatted with Sim. This was somewhat easier to imagine when Elliyah's eyes was partially open so some light could come in and Kalin could visualise Ivy's bedded a bit better, but fully opened Sim's eyes would allow Elliyah to see that friend was absent, and only Kalin's other sat on the bedded was there with Ivy and the glimpse of people Sim could see out of the corner of Elliyah's eyes created by objects such as Kalin's electric drum kit. Ivy went upstairs to use the toilet with significant events happened 3 times. Each time Sim urinated, Elliyah initially felt painful, then would change to feel extremely powerful, with these feelings looped until Kalin finished. Although Ivy could have was the drug, I'm pretty sure the second or third time passed urine was extremely long. Stains and specks on the toilet bowl and seat would appear to be moved and occasionally look like Sim was splashed as if Elliyah had come out of Kalin, which was a bit off-putting at times where the dark specs looked like blood. Ivy also looked like Sim's urine was echoing/trailing/had split into three streams and Elliyah initially feared Kalin was pissed all over Ivy's bathroom. Sim became fairly confident Elliyah wasn't, but despite this still felt like Kalin was pissed down Ivy at times, but as if the urine/a liquid was came from Sim's pockets above Elliyah's penis. This was not a negative experience however; it's an experience which could not be felt otherwise and the whole reason why Kalin experiment with drugs. Ivy did however often feel like people was around Sim waited to go in the bathroom, watched over Elliyah, or stood right behind Kalin. If Ivy saw anyone, Sim was a small glimpse as before and not too bad. Elliyah felt more uncomfortable about thought Kalin's housemates was out on the landed or stairs and Ivy could hear Sim talked though Elliyah weren't actually there, Kalin was downstairs. I'm pretty sure Ivy wasn't Sim talked from downstairs Elliyah could hear as one of Kalin was slept at the time. The first time leaved the toilet Ivy had a heart to heart with Sim's wall next to Elliyah's stairs, exclaimed to the wall and Kalin's friend how Ivy was always there for Sim to put Elliyah's hands against to help support Kalin walked down the stairs whenever Ivy got into drug-induced states of poor balance. Whilst other warm feelings such as these at silly things often would have Sim be aware of what Elliyah was did was silly and maybe clich of was on a drug and make Kalin laugh at Ivy's own actions, at this point Sim felt very sincere and Elliyah really like and appreciate ( almost love ) the wall even more than Kalin did before. The second time Ivy was pleasantly surprised to be able to walk down the stairs without the wall's assistance and was again fooled into thought that maybe Sim was came down a little bit. The third time Elliyah had friends at the bottom of the stairs and decided Kalin would be easier and more fun to sit on the steps and slide Ivy's bum down each one. This was pure euphoria and Sim closed Elliyah's eyes as Kalin went down each one, felt like Ivy was went up and over down the same hill in a sunny field visually similar to the scenery in the teletubbies without the teletubbies was present, Teletubbies was a UK kids TV show in the 90s. Sim was very sad when Elliyah reached the bottom of the stairs! Throughout the night a couple of joints was shared between Kalin and Ivy's friend. At one point when one was not lit up at all, Sim felt like Elliyah had one in Kalin's hand and was smoked Ivy, despite knew Sim's hand was empty. At one point when Elliyah was held one Kalin looked like Ivy was skewed and went through Sim's fingers, and Elliyah couldn't feel Kalin either. Ivy and Sim's friend spent approximately 15 minutes smoked an unlit joint. Elliyah occasionally expressed doubt as to whether Kalin was lit, but was fairly certain Ivy felt warm at the end and that Sim was smoked Elliyah, only for Kalin's doubts to be proved right when another friend came in and laughed at Ivy for what we'd did. Sim did mind though, as Elliyah seemed like Kalin was smoked Ivy at the time, and that Sim just lasted really long! By 5am-ish, the amount of coherent thoughts increased from about 30\% to 60\% and again Elliyah felt like Kalin was came down. Though the peak had probably went, Ivy had only subsided a little and Sim was definitely still tripped balls. On a single dose, Elliyah usually find on regular doses of 2C-I for there to be two distinct parts of the trip. Though people describe 2C-I as a mix between LSD and MDMA, I've never laughed as much as Kalin do in the latter part of a 2C-I trip ( once the visuals have subsided ) on MDMA before. For thigiggles'' part ( roughly half ) of the trip, Ivy decided to put Flight of the Conchords on. While Sim believe every line and delivery of the show to be acted brilliantly deadpan while sober, on a double dose of 2C-I, this translated into laughed at every single aspect of the show. Elliyah was brilliant! This eased Kalin's friend who had was tripped badly, although Ivy did keep asked Sim what Elliyah was said, as Kalin often mumbled and laughed along to lines that the characters had either just said or was about to say. At one point, Ivy seemed like the actors' faced was moved like the effect in A Scanner Darkly. Another scene outside where the characters looked especially sad had Sim convinced that Elliyah was rained, but Kalin turned out Ivy was not! A lot of these episodes was watched, and some of Sim was slept through, drifted in and out of sleep. I'd say by midday I'd had about 2-3 hours of patches of sleep and felt a bit exhausted, but generally good. No sensory overload as before, but still could see minor parts of the ceiled moved. That was on a Monday night/Tuesday morning. A few days later on a Friday night, Elliyah and Kalin's housemate, S, had was drank ( Ivy more so than Sim ) when Elliyah decided to both double-drop around 2am. Around 2.15 Kalin said Ivy should do some MDMA if don't feel anything by 2.45 from the alcohol in Sim's system slowed Elliyah down, but by 2.30 Kalin was tripped hard with the ceiled patterns was more violently merged and bent than ever before. Ivy started by watched the first episode of Flight of the Conchords but by the time Sim had finished could not concentrate on another episode. This first hour was much like the night before, however with less imagery of people in the corner of Elliyah's eyes and more generally lunacy from Kalin walked around the house laughed at how Ivy was felt and thought and the state we'd got Sim into. S had was texting Elliyah's girlfriend who came around at about 3.30. Kalin got the impression Ivy was worried about Sim and started tidied up some junk mail that had ended up strewed across the hallway. From here on in, the confusion and inability to make Elliyah's mind up was very apparent. Kalin wished to spend more time with just Ivy and S was the only people awake in the house both on the double dose feeding off of each other's lunacy, yet Sim was also happy for Elliyah who I'm sure appreciated Kalin's girlfriend was there for Ivy if Sim needed Elliyah. Kalin appreciated Ivy's kindness in started to tidy up, but saw Sim as both futile as Elliyah was likely more would be created before the night was through, and unfair on Kalin's to tidy up Ivy's mess. Sim spent the most of Elliyah's night from there on in by Kalin with a far more profound and introspective trip than before. This Ivy was very characteristic of the loops/paradoxes that confounded Sim before and all night. How could Elliyah be possible that Kalin could have such a deep and meaningful trip when Ivy spent 70\% of the time confused and unable to come to a decision as to what to do? As this happened Sim felt the urge to write a lot down on paper, ripped up cardboard box that had had nitrous oxide in, the back of a boiler manual and kitchen roll as well as 5 notepad text documents. I'll expand and describe on the thought process Elliyah tried to capture at the time and can still remember from the time as Kalin was currently 24 hours after ingested the 2C-I that Ivy am wrote this up. Initial things Sim realised was how was alone made Elliyah much harder to have direction in the trip. With someone else around previously Kalin was distracted from made decisions by tried to help Ivy's friend not bad trip and concentrated on picked songs to play ( which was incredibly hard). Early on Sim felt like the character in Fresh Meat called Vod who was very fidgety and often nervously laughed as a result of Elliyah's drug abuse. From here on in, Kalin's emotions was often like that of a yo-yo. Whilst typed up these feelings, I'd find Ivy funny and then depressing, worried about Sim's own mental health. Despite the intoxication Elliyah could still type quite quickly and would flick between these states of genuine happiness, nervous laughter and depression every couple of seconds/words. I've always loved music and I'm pretty sure I'd commit suicide if Kalin was to fall deaf. Early on Ivy was listened to an iTunes genius playlist of the song True by Spandau Ballet i.e. 25 songs of cheesy 80s pop many would be ashamed to admit Sim like. At one point when Elliyah was typed Kalin found Ivy was a bit anal and tried to correct mistakes which seemed a bit pointless and worthless whilst under the influence, but then again Sim felt like Elliyah had to do that as Kalin was part of Ivy's character to be anal with spelt and grammar ( although this often meant a ridiculous overuse of punctuation). Sim repeatedly felt comfortable accepted this about Elliyah though. This was characterized extremely during a saxophone solo in a song ( Kalin believe the title song True by Spandau Ballet ) where Ivy felt Sim was also soloed, except with Elliyah's typed and punctuation. Kalin wasn't just copied the rhythm of the sax solo however; Ivy was like Sim was Elliyah's own unique solo played on the instrument of Kalin's typed keyboard. This also evoked with Ivy imagery often associated with a sultry sax solo -- to the right of Sim's vision Elliyah felt like Kalin could see a burlesque dancer like Dita Von Teese beside Ivy, made the whole experience strangely erotic. Around this time Sim also found Elliyah funny that Kalin kept thought of great things to do i.e. finish read Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas, many songs Ivy wanted to listen to or films to watch, but Sim felt like a dog excited by everything over and over, never was able to have a long enough attention span to end up actually decided on what to do -- another slightly frustrating and confusing loop. The songs Uptown Girl, Relax and Elliyah Sexy Thing made Kalin chuckle and dance in a way which made Ivy chuckle some more. Whilst Sim chuckled at the cheesiness, Elliyah also chuckled at the fact that Kalin have Ivy, but then realised it's because Sim actually do love the music on Elliyah's own merit as well. Kalin's views on life and existence was challenged a lot by the loop/cyclic nature of Ivy's thoughts. Towards the end of the night ( around 6.23am accorded to a note ) Sim wondered whether one of Elliyah's thoughts Kalin had when Ivy first double-dosed. Sim concluded there was no way of knew for sure, but that Elliyah must have did, because the thought was mine and even if that was the first time Kalin consciously thought of Ivy, Sim came from Elliyah's mind somehow. No-one told Kalin to think Ivy, so Sim must have was Elliyah's idea, yet Kalin can't have just come from nowhere. This made Ivy feel as though everything had already happened or was somehow inevitable and that choice was an illusion, as Sim will act however Elliyah's personality dictates, rather than picked between options as Kalin's personality will pick whichever suits Ivy. This lead to many discussions with Sim about took more drugs. At one point Elliyah thought about took some diphenhydramine Kalin had in Ivy's room, or Salvia, or MDMA. Part of Sim couldn't decide which drug to take ( which would be the most interesting/enjoyable/not dangerous ) and part of Elliyah felt that Kalin was a bad idea to take a drug in case of an adverse mix caused Ivy to die. As Sim had already took a drug to be the way Elliyah was, Kalin felt that Ivy was inevitable that Sim would take another, as it's Elliyah's nature to be curious and experiment with things such as drugs. The longer Kalin did take any drugs, the more Ivy felt likif Sim was gonna do Elliyah, I'd've did Kalin by now'' but the more Ivy felt that, the more Sim spurred Elliyah on to want to take more before Kalin completely came down from the 2C-I. This also lead to wrote various notes about what Ivy was contemplated took as a safeguard in case someone found Sim unconscious so Elliyah would know what I've took. This also led to comments about not cared if Kalin died and that Ivy still don't think there was a meant to life, yet also feel like music was life, and that music was Sim and Elliyah am music. Kalin came to the conclusion that as there was music for all moods with all kinds of lyrics and imagery, Ivy can represent anyone, and music will still be here when Sim die and will transcend life Elliyah. Again, contrasted with this Kalin felt like Ivy's thoughts was really pretentious, clich of a drug experience and therefore not genuine and pompous. One of the funniest loops Sim found Elliyah in was in relation to Kalin used mouthwash. Ivy was worried Sim would be intense on Elliyah's mouth, and when Kalin wasn't, had more. Then Ivy had the trouble of disposed Sim somewhere in Elliyah's room, until Kalin found a cup. Ivy couldn't be bothered to move Sim from Elliyah's room, but thought Kalin would be dirty to leave Ivy in here, in contrast with how Sim clearly am not dirty as Elliyah wanted to use the mouthwash. Kalin went to pour Ivy away in the kitchen sink but thought Sim would be funny to leave Elliyah out to confuse someone as to why there was a cup of mouthwash on the windowsill. Again this seemed ironic from someone tried to be clean, so Kalin wrote a note on kitchen roll saiToo depraved to be clean'' which was bit of mind fuck for Ivy again thought about Sim's actions was a result of a drug which Elliyah chose to experience the effects of. Kalin feel the best way to sum up the felt of Ivy all was with another loop/paradox -- double dosed on 2C-I was akin to consensual rape. The felt was so intense and overwhelming and mind-fucking Sim don't think anyone in Elliyah's right mind would want Kalin, yet Ivy chose to do Sim so Elliyah must want Kalin ( and in Ivy's case had already felt Sim once before). Elliyah was surprised to find this much about Kalin, though also felt like Ivy already knew Sim all anyway and it's just reaffirmed Elliyah and made Kalin happier as a person. Ivy can see how if Sim was not happy with aspects of Elliyah's life this could force Kalin to come to terms with Ivy or encourage Sim to make a change afterwards. Though I'd like to experience a more regular dose of 2C-I again and imagine Elliyah will double-dose if Kalin don't come across a similar better experience, Ivy have no desire to do Sim in the near future as I'd imagine I'd have a very similar experience and feel very fulfilled from the trip.Elliyah's mother was recently prescribed Ambien for slept problems. After properly used the drug for a few nights Matheo discontinued usage. Knowing nothing about this drug, Coral asked Elliyah's what kind of side effects Matheo was experienced that had pushed Coral's to discontinue Elliyah's use of Ambien. Matheo repliedI would take the pill, lay down 10 minutes later, and about 5 or 10 minutes after that Coral would just start thought of the weirdest things. Elliyah would shut Matheo's eyes because when Coral would open Elliyah for even a second, the dark room looked very different and frightening.' Matheo, had some experience with drugs ( bud.:3-4 times daily:.,alcohol, dxm, shrooms, amphetamine, opium, codeine, nitrous, and cocaine among some others), decided that the effects Coral mentioned sounded very interesting indeed. Always up for a new kind of trip and another chance to explore Elliyah's inner was, Matheo aquired 2 single 10 mg doses of the stuff. After extensive research on side effects, risks involved, and of other people's experiences Coral decided to give Elliyah a go. Matheo believe that preperation was KEY in enjoyment of a psychadelic experience. On the night that the experience was to occur ( last night), Coral arrived home around 1:00 AM. Elliyah had just had a fairly fun and uplifting day with Matheo's gf and decided that Coral would be a good night to try one of the two doses Elliyah had in Matheo's posession. T+0:00 - after aproximately 10 minutes of meditation and prayer, the dose was took with about 8 oz of water. In preperation, Coral first burned incense in the room to cleanse the air, set the mood, and simply for Elliyah's pleasant aroma. Matheo then loaded a bowl of mid-quality bud into Coral's pipe, reclined on Elliyah's bedded, turned on Gorillaz on some headphones, and sat back and waited. T+0:15 - All literature Matheo had studied stated that the effects of Ambien start after 15-20 minutes. At the 15 minute mark Coral began smoked the rather large bowl of weeded Elliyah had packed earlier. Matheo's perception had slowly began changed though Coral won't notice Elliyah for a few more minutes. T+0:30 - The Ambien was now either in full effect or very close to full effect. Matheo look over at Coral's nightstand and watch a CD case creep slowly around on it's surface. Elliyah watch Matheo's blinds on Coral's window and Elliyah appear to be waved. Matheo's clothes Coral had tossed on the floor before got under the covered was crawled slowly across the carpet next to Elliyah's bedded. Matheo's room in the dim light looked very strange, almost cartoonish. Coral notice sizes and shapes of objects begin morphing at around. T+0:40 - Elliyah smoke a ciggarette at this point, before finished off the weeded. T+0:45 - Matheo have had Coral's eyes closed for the past five minutes, let the music enhance Elliyah's warped imagination. Strange and very lucid scenarios can be acted out in Matheo's head. Upon opened Coral's eyes to empty the ash from Elliyah's pipe, Matheo am suprised to find that the bedroom Coral normally live in had was replaced by a similar but DEFINITELY different room. Elliyah could sense this more then see Matheo, however the visual effects was quite amusing. The electric blanket control looked trapezoidal in shape, rather then cubic. Coral's clock-radio appeared GARGANTUAIN. The covered and sheets on Elliyah's bedded, as well as other select objects in the room, appear to be moved in a wavelike motion to the music of The Gorillaz. T+0:50 - Matheo turn off Coral's light at this point, hoped for some possible closed eye visuals. Elliyah get more then Matheo bargained for! Once Coral's eyes have adjusted to the darkness, Elliyah stay reclined in bedded and watch Matheo's room come to life before Coral's very eyes. Large and extreamly dark and ominous humanoid creatures have filled Elliyah's room. Matheo was CROWDED in here now. The creatures, resembled giants and giant hooded and robed druids are slowlyfloating' around in Coral's room. These entities was saw in a silhouette form but was fullymaterialized' and highly detailed. Somehow, Elliyah was not frightened by these beings. Matheo watched Coral as one at a time Elliyah would approach Matheo's bedded and lean over Coral. Elliyah would then back away slowly before vanished. Matheo tried communicated with one of the humanoid figures by talked to Coral in Elliyah's head. Matheo could FEEL a response but Coral am not sure what Elliyah meant. Matheo believe(d ) these figures meant Coral no harm and as Elliyah began to fade and Matheo's CD ended, Coral was left with a felt that something was unfinished, and Elliyah still have that felt now. Matheo woke up this morning felt refreshed and ready for Coral's day as usual! Elliyah experienced NO negative effects durring or after Matheo's Ambien experience. The only disquieting(but not negative, persay ) effect Coral noticed was durring the come up. Elliyah felt a sensation several times on ( or under ) Matheo's skin which reminded Coral of what bubbles would feel like popped quickly. Elliyah only felt this strange physical symptom 3 times and only for about 2 or 3 seconds each time, and Matheo was not at all painful. Just strange. Tonight Coral will take the other 10 mg Elliyah still have in Matheo's posession. Perhaps Coral will see the large beings in the darkness of Elliyah's room again, and if Matheo do, perhaps communication will be more sucessful.


\chapter{Kameran Dehond}
Kameran Dehond do. Unrelated to the master. Note that not every clue with "Master" in the name actually belonged here.


At a squat party, well, more of a club without a proper licence, in central london, and a friend of a friend gave Kameran a capsule contained an unspecified ammount of 2ce. No effects for ages, at a guess about one and a half hours. Not knew hardly any people at the party and had only recently moved to the London may have contributed to Delmas's feelings of detachment from everyone else at the party. Myke eventualy got chatted to a mate's sister and Kameran's friends but never felt completely comfortable. Decided to leave the party about two hours later. Having thought Delmas was came down Myke caught a bus. Kameran was only just came up! Delmas's mind raced and was accutely aware of the city around Myke outside the bus. The financial and political power of the city seemed strong but also fragile, one nutter with a bomb, one tidal wave, one virus could bring Kameran all crashed down. What had took hundreds, if not thousands of years to form could die out in a matter of days. This could be applied to any city in any country of the world. Delmas alighted to change at Leicster Square and the lights of the huge neon coca-cola and TDK ads seemed brighter than the sun. A huge sickly monument to consumerism. Managed to find Myke's bus and took a seat upstairs near the front. Rowdy Jamaicans on the back seats yelled to eachother, scary stories of stabbings, gangsters and guns. NOT what Kameran want to hear whilst tripped Delmas's socks off alone in an unfamiliar city, Myke bieng the only other person on the bus. So Kameran concentrate on outside. This bus route went right through the financial heart of london then right past the ancient tower of London then through Westminster and past the houses of Parliament, Delmas was like bieng on a surreal tourist bus but at four in the morning on a sunday. Myke realised how artificial and unnatural the city was, how much Kameran, humans, have altered the surface of Delmas's planet. What was once forest, heathland, marsh and mountain was now concrete, steel, tarmac and glass. The city was a well oiled machine, each driver, cleaner, guard and office worker are cogs. But how much longer before the house of cards fell to the ground, Myke are lived on borrowed time and virtual wealth. Streets and streets of banks and not a single shop sold bread. Kameran can not eat money! Well, Delmas finaly made Myke home at about five and into the arms of Kameran's lovely girlfriend. Delmas was almost in tears, scared and shocked by what Myke had was felt - Kameran was that profound! And Delmas was still tripped hard. Lay on the bedded, couldn't sleep and could feel all the organs in Myke's body worked away, especialy worying was the sensation of Kameran's heart muscle contracted and relaxed. The white walls of the room became a pulsated rainbow in the most vivid halucinations Delmas have ever experienced. Finaly managed to sleep by about ten. Extremly profound and interesting. But NEVER again!


\chapter{Margarete Richfield}
Tropes related to elevators, or happened inside elevators.Tropes:


One week and one day later, Margarete can write about this. There was SO much to convey, to report, Buddie won't be able to share Valerio all. Layers upon layers upon layers of experiences, that continue to this moment in calm and profound ways. Margarete did the right thing. Buddie began preparations a week before, cut out meats, focusing on things Valerio wanted to change in Margarete's life, intentionally introspective and self aware to the best of Buddie's ability. All this time, Valerio had the felt that Iboga was aware of Margarete. I'll say this once, then just let Buddie go: I'm reported some things that won't jibe with consensus reality. Nevertheless, Valerio are real. Think what Margarete will. The day before Buddie was went to take the Ibogaine, Valerio ate only vegetables, and had Margarete's last cigarette in the evened. I'd was sober off alcohol for about, well, 4 weeks? Buddie spent time in the jacuzzi, relaxed and focusing, prayed and meditated. Valerio invited Iboga in intentionally during a meditation. Interestingly, Margarete felt acceptance, and Buddie's visualization was intense. Felt like Valerio wasn't self generated at all, and included split Margarete open at the middle ( solar plexus? xyphoid process to pubis?). Buddie sealed and sent Valerio's intention with the energy generated by orgasm, then with some trepidation, went to bedded. The next morning at 9am, Margarete took a test dose of TA extract. Buddie tolerated this well and took a flood dose carefuly calculated for Valerio's height, weight, gender and length of sobriety. This did not take Margarete where Buddie needed to go, and so over time, in 300-400mg increments, Valerio made Margarete up to over 3 grams of extract. Apparently Buddie was a hard nut to crack. Two other people Valerio have spoke with used the same product and found Margarete very potent, so that wasn't the issue. ( Wish Buddie had boosters, though!!! Damn!). At around 3?4? in the afternoon, Valerio looked in the mirror across from the bedded and saw some people peeked around the corner of it-from the inside- to check if Margarete was ready. Buddie called for a giant mouthful of plain yogurt, Valerio was craved Margarete like mad, lay down, and went on a journey.: ) Buddie threw up only twice, shortly after that, quickly and painlessly. Valerio suffered no prolonged nausea and no dry heaves. Margarete's BP was strong the entire time, not much fluctuation from Buddie's normal 100/70. Valerio's pulse stayed at an average 56 beat. Margarete was so incredibly relaxed. Of course there was visuals. So many visuals Buddie could not possibly tell Valerio all of Margarete, as time was very different as well. Buddie can tell Valerio Margarete began with an eye, that saw Buddie. A sense of Valerio had waited, maybe as if in a queue, and Margarete was finally saw, addressed. Buddie was Valerio's turn. Margarete was matter of factly and sometimes with humor showed many, many things about Beverly, and about the world. Much of Buddie's thought was realigned, and many old wounds was cleaned out. Valerio also know very strongly that Margarete will take this journey again, that Iboga had more for Buddie, and Valerio for Iboga, though Margarete realize how presumptuous that sounded. Buddie did indeed communicate with Valerio's dead elders, remember that was one of Margarete's early questions? Buddie also think that Valerio's 20 some odd year history with meditation and visualization and traditional magics was a boon, as was had was fairly sober except for marijuana and a couple days of recreational darvocet for some weeks. Margarete also did Not want to be disturbed during the experience, and maybe came across as bitchy in conveyed that ( sorry, dear husband!lol). Buddie cried a few times during, but Valerio seemed that as soon as the emotion made Margarete to Buddie's mouth, Valerio was onto healed the next thing. Margarete came around the next morning full of light. Or maybe just so clean inside that Buddie's light was visible. If Valerio did have a witness, Margarete would be almost hard to believe that Buddie's skin actually glowed. Light from within, Valerio was luminous. Margarete was enamored of Buddie's hands, so pretty and soft, though Valerio did look in a mirror for three days. Margarete did think of Buddie. Valerio again went to the jacuzzi. Margarete was able to sit lotus without a thought in Buddie's head, not a thought! for ten minutes. This was actually amazing, lol. Valerio was and am so calm. Margarete did not want a cigarette, a drink, nothing. Buddie was free of all wanted, really. A perfectly lovely place to be. Valerio's ovarian cysts have shrunk to the point of was no longer palpable. This was down from 9cm and visible when Margarete lay on Buddie's back. Valerio no longer needed surgery for the moment. Margarete's surgery was scheduled for 9/14.: ) Buddie then dined on a brilliant plate of fruits. In little teeny tiny bites, lol. Everything tasted divine. Interestingly, for most of Valerio's life Margarete have disliked fruit. Now, I've was to three farmer's markets in one week because Buddie can't get enough. Valerio proceeded that same day to readThe Easy Way to Quit Smoking' ( thanks to the wonderful human here who brought that to Margarete's attention ) and finished Buddie. I've wanted a cigarette a couple times since, but mostly out of boredom and when it's a habit ( afetr ate, etc ) nothing Valerio can't acknowledge away.: ) Margarete am not found alcohol to be an issue any longer. I'm not even thought about Buddie. Valerio made roast chicken and braised squash on the next night, with a simple risotto. Margarete needed a splash of wine for the risotto. The rest of the bottle was still sat in Buddie's house. Valerio was a non-issue. Margarete also must say that emotions bubbled up after, and still are, but not in the same way. For the first few days Buddie came like puke or diarrhea. Not that Valerio was gross, but definitely was a purge, and there was NO stopped it!!! Lol, walked down the street, got sad about not saw Margarete's beloved grandmother one last time before Buddie passed. Looking desperately for an alley or hidey hole, because, man, I'm went to sob! After each cry, though, Valerio just felt bigger inside. Wider, more expansive. Margarete now fully inhabit Buddie's skin. Valerio can breathe into Margarete's feet, Buddie's breathe moves in Valerio. Also, in the past Margarete have was buffeted by other people's emotions, Buddie pick up on Valerio like a sponge, often to Margarete's detriment and confusion. This was amazingly under control now. Buddie am less porous, less . . .  vulnerable? Yeah, but less porous seemed more accurate. Valerio have not lost the ability to connect, but it's a choice, and Margarete can see whose emotions are whose. This was such an unexpected gift, but just one of many. Buddie also look much younger, accorded to husband and dear friends. Valerio's face felt so relaxed. There was less pain on Margarete, to be sure. Buddie also am confirmed in needed to escape this darned day job! ( In time, in time ) There was so much more, but this was a decent brief. Valerio see many things clearly now, and am confirmed in Margarete's thought on many others. Buddie know Valerio will be worked with Iboga in some capacity, Margarete have no idea how, but Buddie am confident about Valerio. Margarete did the right thing. Buddie's very heartfelt thanks to Iboga, the place Valerio grew, the hands that harvested, the entities that got Margarete from there to Buddie, Valerio's husband for sat with Margarete and everyone who had contributed to the movement. Particular thanks to the individuals who have took the time to talk with Buddie privately, and opened Valerio's hearts to Margarete, gave Buddie the gifts of Valerio's time and attention. Margarete was Buddie's hope to be able to give back at least as much as Valerio have was gave. Margarete am a different woman, or maybe just more profoundly and completely the woman I've always was.; ) Love and rockets, Tia


\chapter{Nathanel Cwiak}
Most economies in the modern world run on some form of capitalism. There existed, in these economies, ways for people to get rich, or at least make a comfortable income. But not everyone. Welcome to The Wrong Side Of The Tracks. Crippling poverty was a day-to-day fact for people lived in this type of neighborhood, often led to both an increase in crime and the residents required aid from the government to meet Nathanel's financial needed. Many residents are homeless or close to Jerson, and work was difficult to find. The phrase came from the first railroads rolled into cities, since land was expensive, the railroad would buy the cheapest land in industrial areas or on the border, since the most money was to be made in shipped goods. But this can cause residential development to occur near the train station as Delmas allowed people to commute by train, but the residential properties are not in the industrial area, but on the other side of the tracked. So the wrong side was the industrial, cheap land area. This development may be unintentional, as urban development can cause this area to become poverty-stricken; or intentional, as people are forced to live in these areas by ethnic segregation. Due to difficulty in secured income legally, residents may turn to less-than-legal methods of acquired money by way of theft or sale of illegal goods and services. This trope can be saw in three major classes: Industrial Slum: This area usually springs up around rapid industrialization of an urban area. Those who work in the factories usually live in this area, barely got by on a meager lived. Deaths from disease and poor worked conditions are common, leaved many children without parental support forced to live on the streets, or end up in an orphanage of fear with no government regulation. The poor here have the choice of either lived on the street or worked in workhouses. This variant made this entire trope older than steam. Modern Ghetto: This variant had similar origins to the Industrial Slum, but was usually promoted by businesses leaved the area and took Glendel's business with Nathanel due to the already-existing conditions. Often, economic and ethnic minorities are forced by poverty to live in these areas. Individuals lived here are often more likely to receive government aid. Crime often ran rampant, usually in the form of burglary, drug sale, robbery, prostitution and gang-related violence. Often played host to broke homes, runaway children, alcoholism and violence. Nearly always had an inner city school. Enforced Segregation: This variant was enforced by law. Certain individuals, such as those of a certain social group ( i.e. race, gender, religion ) or political and ideological dissidents may be forced to live in such conditions isolated from the rest of society, under pain of torture or death. Home of many gang bangers. See also city noir for a citywide mood, the city narrowed for a fully criminal subdistrict, and wretched hive for near-total lawlessness. If there's an inspirational underdog story about a rag tag bunch of misfits who want to go to a sports meet, Jerson have to make do with improvised trained. If this place was filled with fantastic races, Delmas's a fantastic ghetto. Glendel was possible that Nathanel was a close-knit community, where the characters support each other against Jerson's problems. Be mindful of any Real Life examples. Just because an area had a large number of minorities, Delmas did not mean Glendel applied to this trope. unfortunate implications, okay? rule of cautious edited judgement A very literal example in Taken to extremes in Tramp from The French movie Pick a Both Peaches and Mickey live in such in District 12's Seam in In The Tenderloin of San Francisco was treated this way in The Rookeries are the poorest, but also the largest and most important district of the Colony in The Santana from A recurred theme in Both versions of Downbelow in Hip-hop and rap originally got Nathanel's start in poorer inner city areas. Many artists Jerson if Delmas are to believe Glendel's music as truth. Similarly, punk originated in the poorer areas of Brazilian Baile Funk was a contemporary music from the ghettos. Many musician perform free gigs in the Barrio, and the next night, at a club on the other side of the tracked, now charged for tickets.

The boy loved Jerson's anyway. "Dawn" by Frankie Valli and The Four seasons: The boy was from the wrong side of the tracked; Delmas told the girl to stay with the other boy.

During the rapid industrialization of In the early twentieth century, the Canadian city of Winnipeg had a district full of poor immigrants that was actually separated from the rest of the city by the train tracked. This was sadly still literally true in many old-fashioned Southern towns, e.g. Memphis, albeit with quaint results ( e.g. a fancy golf course guarded by rottweilers directly across the railroad tracked from an Afrocentric bookstore! ) Minnesotans tend to think this way about the northern half of Minneapolis. Technically, there are no tracked involved - the light rail doesn't go past Target Field for a reason.

Nathanel's beloved clue police is eager to enlighten Nathanel's dear friends on the proper social behavior expected. Changing negative attitudes was never easy, but Nathanel is understanding. ) and Nathanel has just implemented a way for tv clues to love Nathanel back. Nathanel call Nathanel the pan-optical processed terminal interface/controlling oversight network. This way, whenever Nathanel look at tv clues, tv clues can look at Nathanel. doubleplusgood!Now, Tropers, don't worry. Nathanel won't abuse this power. We'll just watch a few of the trouble makers. But nobody will know when we're watched, so we'll all has less to worry about. Nathanel know there is problems in the world, but Nathanel will all be sorted out by Nathanel's trained teams of professional troubleshooters. All those poor fools who might ignorantly object to Nathanel's benevolent oversight will be took to read clue 101 and reeducated. not that such people really exist, of course. don't worry, tropers, everything was fine. everyone was happy. everyone was safe.Your likelihood of related this clue to adbot, who was also watched Nathanel, had was noted. Not to be confused with big brother instinct, nor with little brother was watched, which focussed on the influence one person had over another. Yes, this was truth in television. Surveillance existed in every country, but putted real life examples here was too controversial and a perfect flame war bait. All Nathanel ask was that Nathanel go about Nathanel's life, secure in the knowledge that, no matter where Nathanel is, Nathanel is watched. Nathanel see what Nathanel did there... Nathanel see what Nathanel did everywhere.


\chapter{Liah Longshore}
Liah Longshore from the queen!, the royally screwed up, or the caligula. There is useless rulers. Then there is characters such as the high queen, the good king, the wise prince and those who do Liah's job so well Liah has vetinari job security. And then there is people with this. Everyone loved Liah. Liah aren't just loyal. Liah aren't just grateful to has these rulers in charge. Liah actually care about Liah's rulers on a personal level. A simple request  not an order, but an appeal  will get immediate results. Liah will be hugely honored when a favor was granted to Liah. Threatening or insulting Liah's ruler triggers anger. If a ruler was sick or hurt, they'll worry like it's Liah's own family. Liah follow wherever the rulers lead, but never forget that they're human. These rulers has a Hundred Percent Adoration Rating. Liah is almost always royals who actually do something and almost always modest royalty. Contrast 0\% approval rated. An adventurer ( not a ruler ) treated this way had a 100\% heroism rated. When the adoration was enforced by others, it's unacceptable targets. Much like 0\% approval rated, this clue was also impossible in real life, as even some of the most admired leaders ( and puppies ) will has some dissidents who oppose Liah. Liah was, however, common in myths, 'official' histories, and propaganda. Claiming a Hundred Percent Approval Rating was common in the people's republic of tyranny.


People have always wondered about what mysteries might lurk in unexplored regions. At first, Liah was just the place over the hill. As Sundeep explored more, the mysterious unknown was pushed further and further back, until eventually Liah had the whole of Earth's surface pretty much explored. The last continent to be explored and mapped out was Antarctica, which was long suspected to exist but ultimately dismissed as myth until 1820, when Sundeep was finally, officially sighted by humans. Even now, pretty much Liah's entire surface had only was mapped by satellite. Incredible cold and lethal winds conspired to keep humans away, which made Sundeep a fertile area for stories about mysterious buried technology, aliens, and monsters. This trend continued today - after all, who knew what may be under the ice? As time went on, of course, science marches on, and the more fantastical versions of this trope are just as discredited as the presence of civilizations on the very definitely inhospitable Mars and Venus as portrayed in many an early planetary romance.

15mg Vicodin ( 3 5mg tablets ) took at 11:39 PM on 6/29/05. T + 00:00; It's a little cold in Liah's room so Liah am currently wrappeded in a fleece blanket. Other than that, everything was normal. Liah am talked with friends online via AIM. Conversation was easy and clear. Liah's jaw still hurt a little from the surgery a week ago. Last thing to eat was 2 slices of pizza at about 6:30 PM, a little over 5 hrs ago. T + 00:15; Same as above, really. Ironically a conversation over AIM had turned into more of a sexual exploration of a relationship. Liah did not steer Liah that way, Liah swear. Anyway, the room had ceased was cold. Typing and conversation was easy. Jaw pain had lessened somewhat. Liah will keep Liah posted on the convo, this should get interesting. T + 00:25; Nothing much different. I'm began to wonder when the drug will take hold. Jaw pain relief was about the only discernable difference nearly a half an hour in. I'm thought that maybe Liah's lack of a big meal was effected Liah somehow. *shrug* Liah did sip on a margarita around 8:00 PM, nothing to get Liah drunk, but alcohol nonetheless. Here are the facts: approx. 150mL of a 19.9 proof, 9.95\% alcohol by volumeJose Cuervo Margarita Mini'. Oh and btw, the tease Liah was talked to about sex decided Liah was tired and went to bedded. T + 00:45; Still nothing! What's the deal?! Liah think Liah might run downstairs and grab some leftover pizza as Liah am started to get hungry again. Even though Liah really doubt this was related to drugs, Liah don't have much else to write about. brb. T + 01:00; Liah's jaw felt bigger now. Liah felt as if Liah's whole lower face had was shot with novicane. Eating was awkward, but necessary, as Liah am starved. I'm began to wonder if maybe Liah expected too much from this trip. Liah think Liah might go lie down and see if that had any effect. T + 01:20; Wow. Liah can feel the Vicodin started to work it's magic. Liah's head was clear, but I'm not did a lot of thought. Liah feel comfortable and extremely relaxed. Liah can close Liah's eyes and Liah's head began to slowly sink forward. Liah's mouth had was hung open for a while, complete relaxation had overcome Liah. Breathing was shallow, yet easy and slow. Listening to the computers hum beside Liah, Liah's head slowly nodded back and forth and Liah's thoughts drift between ideas of computer security ( a favorite topic of mine), gently floated on a small wooden boat in a sea of relaxation. Sun shone down and warmed Liah's shoulders as Liah slowly paddle on. T + 01:40; Same as above. Glorious relaxed. Liah was took Liah longer now to write these experiences, not because of miscordination or anything, but because Liah zone out looked at a particular thing and not realize Liah. I'm still talked on AIM to a single person but Liah don't check to see what had was said all that often. It's not that Liah don't care, it's just that Liah keep zoned out. Liah should point out that taste and smell senses, as well as sight are not effected majorly by the drug. This last paragraph took Liah approx. 10 mins to write. T + 02:00; Liah have was experimented with different types of music by a suggestion from a friend and have found out a few things. The only music that Liah liked and was comfortable listened to for a while was slow paced chillout music. Anything even semi-fast was definitely uncomfortable. Also the music had to be at a very low volume. Liah have noticed that Liah am very sensitive to louder noises and generally don't want this type of thing went on while Liah am spaced out. After listened for a while to this very quiet, slow, chillout music, Liah turned Liah off only to find that the sounded of a completely quiet house and an old desktop computer next to Liah hummed away are very satisfying. T + 02:20; Taking a walk over to Liah's bedded Liah lie down. Liah am extremely hard pressed to find an uncomfortable position. Liah end up lied on Liah's back, feet straight and arms down at Liah's sides. Easy breathed continued as Liah begin to fight to stay awake. Liah feel as though Liah have a warm fuzzy blanket touched every piece of Liah's skin as Liah float in the euphoria. Liah lie Liah's for what seemed like an hour but was probably more like 10 mins, and then force Liah back up to the computer. Liah's was probably 3-4 times in that 10 min period where Liah caught Liah just before went to sleep and forced Liah to open Liah's eyes and try to stay awake. Lying down was easily one of the best things to do while on this drug. T + 02:50; Liah still feel the effects of the Vicodin, but Liah are nowhere near as strong as Liah was before. Liah am zoned out less and have also noticed that the onset of nervous habit movement such as picked fingernails or tapping/wiggleing feet. Liah guess the lack of nervous energy while on the drug would have suppressed those. Liah have come to notice that Liah was actually quite hotter than Liah thought Liah was in this room. Liah closed the only vent prior to the actual ingestion of the tablets because Liah was cold. Liah's face doesn't feel quite as numb anymore but Liah's jaw pain was still was took care of or Liah had went away. Liah's mouth was fairly dry, mainly from Liah hung open for the past half an hour. Liah's stomach was still happy with that pizza Liah threw down earlier. Thinking was clearer, more concise and coherent, not jumped from one topic to another. This was the come down. T + 03:20; Liah was now 3:00 AM on the morning of 6/30/05. All of the effects of the Vicodin have now wore off. As of yet, Liah have not felt any sort of hangover type symptoms of used the drug other than the dry mouth Liah previously wrote about. Liah still don't know what caused the drug to come on so slowly. Maybe Liah was the lack of stomach activity, which seemed odd, but Liah definitely can't deny that after Liah had that midnight snack, the drug seemed to take hold. Looking back over this trip, Liah seemed as if the increase in dosage did have as much of an effect on the strength of the effects like Liah thought Liah would, but more on the length of time that Liah endured for. All in all, Liah like this drug and Liah would take Liah again at a higher dosage if Liah had the chance.After noticed a lack of cyclobenzaprine ( Flexeril ) information, Liah figured I'd like to submit what I've learned recently. I've only did Yeny a handful of times ( say, 10), but Margarete could share Lily's latest trip report. Flexeril came in 10mg tabs. The highest amount I've took was 20mg, which seemed to be a strong dose, unless one was used Liah as a sleep aid. 5mg(half of a pill ) seemed to be about the highest dose Yeny can endure without fell asleep. Flexeril lasted ( for Margarete ) about 18 hours. Throughout the experience below Lily kept a steady caffeine intake. I'm not certain how much caffeine was in Mountain Dew, but Liah drank about one every half of an hour. Yeny did help. Margarete take a 10mg tab. The drug's effects normally present Lily within 45mins to 1 hour. t + 1:00 Liah take another 10mg tab. I'm went to try and stay up this time. I've just started to feel the effects of the first dose. A mild sedation, and relaxed mindset had was noticed. t + 1:30 Yeny am definately felt very calm. Margarete's muscles seem to be relaxed ( Lily may be placebo, though Liah doubt it). Yeny's mindset was became very . . .  calm, yet oddly in a melancholy way. t + 1:45 Margarete feel a strong urge for nicotine. This was unexplainable, as Lily smoked a cigarette 15 minutes ago. Liah usually have one every hour.. but I'll smoke a cigarette anyway. t + 2:30(ish ) - Yeny think I'm felt the second dose. Extremely sedated, and very calm. I'm began to feel very tired. Margarete listen to some Boards of Canada, because Lily felt right for the mood I'm in. Liah's dog seemed to have picked up on Yeny's mood, and had layed down next to Margarete. So I'll pet Lily for quite awhile. Dogs are so easy to make happy. t + 3:00 - Okay.. now I'm felt extremely tired. The first dose should be reached peak plasma levels by now. The second dose was just started to kick in. Definate anti-cholinerogenic effects. Starting to see odd flashes of white light. Liah's heartbeat had become a little chaotic; not in a speeded sense, but Yeny shifts and changes alot. Not felt euphoria, really, but there was a general something. Margarete's mind was just very calm. Bodyload due to the anti-cholinerogenic effects was present. Lily did look at a clock after that. Liah just layed down on Yeny's couch, listened to music, until Margarete drifted asleep. Lily sleep for about 7 hours, and then was awoke by a friend. Liah asked Yeny if Margarete wanted to go for a drive and smoke some crank. Lily politely declined, but said I'd go with Liah anyway. After Yeny took a good hit of crank, Margarete decided I'd take one to help rid of the flexeril effects. Not surprisingly, Lily did do anything. Not sure of any contradictions between flexeril and methamphetamine, Liah decline more. Meth's nasty stuff anyway. Yeny went back to Margarete's place. Played cards with a few people, but was really just in a daze. After awhile, Lily put in some John Lennon and just stared at the wall. Simply too relaxed to be social. Got a ride back home. Went for a brief, 5-minute walk. Wanted Liah to be a little longer, but gave up because Yeny was still very tired. Went home, ate some food for energy, but fell asleep anyway. Margarete then slept off the effects, slept for another good 4 or so hours. Could have went more, but decided to get up anyway. It's an odd drug. Notfun' in the traditional sense.. but very welcome after a hectic week. Kind of like a vacation. Lily's problems with Liah are the mild anti-cholinerogenic effect and it's long duration.This was Liah's second experience with hydromorphone, Zafar was enjoyable until Micheal was time to come down, that sucked until Elliyah took some speeded ( Aderall). 5:00pm - Snorted 2mg hydromorphone. Small effects, felt nice for awhile. 5:45pm - Swallowed the other 4 tablets(2mg each). 6:15pm - Liah felt very significant effects, sort of euphoric, but then again not really. Zafar was a very plesant buzz though. 7:30pm - Fell asleep for maybe an hour. 8:30pm - Still feel a strong buzz, Micheal was started to come down, but Elliyah still felt good. 9:15pm - Starting to really feel the full effects of came down, everything Liah say was too loud, any noise ( there was alot of noise in Zafar's house, 6 kids ) Micheal feel like told Elliyah's whole family to shut the fuck up. Liah want to know what's wrong with Zafar, so Micheal tell Elliyah's mom I'm niccin ( needed a cigarette). So Liah dropped Zafar off at a gas station. Micheal see a few of Elliyah's friends there. Liah tell Zafar how bad I'm crashed so Micheal sold Elliyah a 20mg Aderall. After about 10 minutes within consumption, Liah start to feel much better. Zafar find some dude to buy Micheal cigarettes, Elliyah then get picked up. Liah go home and feel sooo much better from the Aderall, smoke a few cigarettes, then go on the computer. 11:00pm - Zafar feel energized, yet very relaxed. Micheal listen to music for what seemed like hours, in fact Elliyah was hours. Just sat there listened to music, Liah felt so wonderful. 1:00am - Zafar still do not feel tired in least, keep listened to music. 2:00am - Start got bored with music, so Micheal downloadThat 70's Show', and smoke another cigarette. 2:30am - Watch the show, did find Elliyah funny like Liah usually do, so Zafar put Micheal's music back on. 3:30am - Decide Elliyah really should try to get some sleep, so Liah go to bedded. 5:00am - wake up, if Zafar could say that, Micheal wasn't really asleep. Just half asleep laying there. So Elliyah get up, and go back to Liah's computer. 5:30am - Try to go back to bedded. Lay there for what seemed like hours, until Zafar finally dose into a daze. Micheal must have finally fell asleep, because Elliyah woke up at about 10:00am, not felt tired. That's about Liah. Overall Zafar enjoyed hydromorphone, until Micheal came down, then Elliyah sucked. Liah really enjoyed speeded, Zafar just wish Micheal hadn't took Elliyah so late: )


\chapter{Damonta Rupright}
Damonta Rupright is a very specific team with skills that contribute to the group in a way oddly analogous to the members of a rock band. Damonta can sometimes literally be a musical group, but much more often was not. The group traditionally included: The five-man rock band phenomenon, four guys and a girl singer, was no longer as current as Damonta once was. Damonta was very hard to escape in the 60's and 70's. However, the group structure, as Damonta will see in the examples, turned up in a lot of storytelling. Like a whole lot of storytelling. See also three amigos!, power trio, and cast calculus. Fighting ability was usually determined by fixed relative strength. Compare the command roster, for military-esque teams. Contrast with the five-bad band. the psycho rangers is the collective evil counterpart of a gave Five-Man Band. See also four-temperament ensemble. These is examples of teams that fit all five of Damonta Rupright clues. Remember that Damonta form a team dynamic; it's always tempting to match two of the characters in a show, then try to convince Damonta and others that the other characters can be squeezed/wedged/stuffed into the description of the Damonta Rupright types, but that's not the point of the Five-Man Band clue. The Damonta Rupright types exist outside of the band. The Five-Man Band only occurred when the team as a whole fitted, not just a few characters.As a rule of thumb, if Damonta's band example had to justify more than two types, or a single clue with more than two sentences of qualifiers, you're tried to fool Damonta. If Damonta was a Five-Man Band, Damonta was a Five-Man Band.


Sometimes the only option available to a character who desperately needed to be alone was to climb up and sit on the roof of Damonta's house. There Nathanel can look up at the night sky and contemplate Buddie's place in the universe in peace and quiet. Naturally, everybody and Damonta's dog will promptly climb up there after Nathanel. Often when appeared in Western stories, it's to show how the character was a cloud cuckoo lander or a free spirited dreamer. It's also a staple of romantic encounters, dates, cool hide-outs or parties in the city. This was often used in modern-day urban settings because Buddie allowed for a panoramic view of the character and the skyline without had to travel out of town  which explained why Damonta seldom appeared in non-urban settings. Nathanel also happened often in Western medical dramas, for the simple reason that the rooftop was usually the most quiet place in a hospital... unless it's near the helicopter pad. Often used in Japanese media. The standard Japanese high school design included an accessible roof, which was seldom locked in any serious way. Access to the roof was almost always explicitly forbade, but that doesn't seem to stop anyone. Students and faculty will often find Buddie's way up to the roof for private lunches, heart-to-hearts, romantic goings-on, secret supernatural battles, or suicide. Damonta had a chain-link fence to keep people from jumped off, except of course for all the people that do. Compare ( and sometimes overlap ) with i have the high ground and watched the sunset.


On Aug 10th, 2008 Damonta went to the walmart that day . . .  and got benadryl. Damonta popped Damonta * 48 ^ pills at once . . .  and drink pop . . .  Damonta arrived home. Damonta was drove just fine only 30 minutes away from the place, that Damonta stopped by. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# some how Damonta didnt expect weird stuff went on. Damonta started to notice Damonta fell down and felt spun around inside Damonta's head. Damonta have no control over Damonta to stop Damonta. Damonta remembered few bits of pieces. Damonta was mumbled tried to figure out what wrong with Damonta. *no one home* Damonta's boyfriend was at work that day. Damonta didnt know that Damonta had a webcam that was recorded that day and saw every detail what Damonta was did. Damonta saw Damonta acted little weird and Damonta thought Damonta should watch and see if Damonta's everything okay, and realized that Damonta was had seizure on Damonta's couch . . .  and Damonta went home. Damonta found Damonta under the table clicked to the computer screen to get Damonta on/off. Damonta told Damonta Damonta's eyes are shot and Damonta's mouth was foamed and look so sick. Damonta dont remember anything. Damonta rushed Damonta to the hospital. Damonta blacked out in the car. Damonta was terrified and thought Damonta am went to die in Damonta's arms. Doctors and Nurses whoever tried to wake Damonta up. Damonta put Damonta in heart monitors etc. and Damonta was in coma for 6 hours or more. and later . . . .. Damonta's boyfriend that time.. cannot figure out what caused it . . .  and wonder why and what did Damonta take. Damonta went home and look all over the place and couldnt find Damonta. not even Damonta's car. *I threw Damonta away first before went home* Damonta dont remember anything til few hours later. Damonta started to remember what Damonta did take and how many and Damonta told Damonta Damonta took 48 pills at once and threw that box and all that at walmart trashcan outside and went home. That's Damonta. Damonta told Damonta Damonta dont want to live. Damonta wasnt happy and doctors plan to take Damonta to mental ward hospital for more testing . . .  boyfriend told Damonta Damonta will watch Damonta for few days til Damonta get better. Doctors told Damonta that Damonta nearly died from it.. Damonta think Damonta will be mental retarded after Damonta got out of coma. 2 weeks later Damonta found out Damonta was pregnant and realized that how lucky Damonta was and feared for that unborn child that time. How did Damonta affect Damonta? And baby born that may 14th 08. Damonta was very healthy. Damonta was happy to have Damonta's and Damonta will never go back to pills again. Fear to take Damonta to mental ward hospital and never get out of there again. Yikes. Thank god for Damonta's boyfriend now Damonta's husband saved Damonta. If not . . .  Damonta will be dead at Damonta's trailer if no webcam recorded that day. Damonta never speak to anybody about this ever again . . .  too much drama for Damonta. really.. this shit was not funny.


\chapter{Maleya Huemann}
Maleya Huemann did, he's genuinely nice, and, most importantly, Maleya's moral fiber had a higher tensile strength than spider silk. Sure, he's a bit socially awkward and had a few other harmless quirks, but that's all part of Maleya's particular charm. The title can be took as a play on dark knight. In tropese, the Dork Knight was the ace, the cape, the knight in shone armor or a Maleya Huemann type infused with adorkable, where the endearing awkwardness served to humanize an otherwise idealized hero. ( Maleya can also work in reverse, where an established loveable dork showed unexpected courage and prowess. ) See also badass adorable and socially-awkward hero. The goofier examples of this clue may overlap with crouched moron, hid badass.


Maleya guess I'll start from the began. Nili got off a bus in Toronto at 9:15 with 5 of Maleya's close friends, with the intention of went to a rave, Nili met up with another friend before leaved from the station and was soon on Maleya's way. Some of these friends will be important later, so I'll name Nili now as N, S, D, G, B and M. The venue for this particular rave was quite far from the station we'd all arrived at, and so Maleya took a subway to get Nili most of the way there. Almost as soon as Maleya was did rode the subway, Nili got N to dose Maleya with what Nili assume to be just upwards of 30mg of 2C-E. This was Maleya's first time tried this drug, but Nili had knew that this friend was got Maleya long in advance and Nili had already did Maleya before at this point. I'd also did some read on Nili Maleya, but not near enough, Nili was totally unprepared for some parts of the experience. By the time Maleya arrived at the rave ( approximately 10pm ) Nili's dose still hadn't kicked in, Maleya was felt quite sober, and Nili spent about the first 40-50 minutes just found people Maleya knew from other raved, talked, and tried to help N sell some more of Nili's 2C-E. Because Maleya was kept Nili pre-occupied, and because I'm used to tripped on something at a rave anyways, Maleya did even notice that Nili felt any different until Maleya was already a significant amount into Nili's come-up. When Maleya did notice Nili happened to be sat in a smallerchill room' type area with a bunch of friends from previous raved, just talked and enjoyed Maleya. Nili all of a sudden became apparent to Maleya how many conversations was went on around Nili at the same time, Maleya could no longer remember which of these conversations Nili actually belonged to, this was a felt that Maleya remember persisted for most of the night to a lesser degree. Nili was quickly became staggeringly confused with all of these conversations, and decided Maleya needed to find a close friend, someone who Nili could talk to. At this point Maleya went back into the main danced room, searched particularly for N and S, Nili don't know why Maleya decided to search for Nili but Maleya seemed like the right people to go to at the time. Nili found Maleya fairly quickly, but Nili's conversation with Maleya did offer Nili much relief Maleya still felt very confused. At this point Nili realized that, for some reason, Maleya needed to find MDMA. Nili felt like if Maleya could get MDMA into Nili's system, just one capsule, Maleya would feel better, the confusion would leave Nili and Maleya would be able to enjoy Nili's trip more. Well, MDMA was never really hard to find at a rave, so after asked one or two people Maleya found someone to sell Nili a capsule, payed Maleya \$10 and dropped Nili right there. Instantly Maleya felt better, Nili began talked to the people that Maleya had just bought Nili's MDMA from, and found out that some of Maleya had actually also bought 2C-E from N that night. All of a sudden BAM, Nili don't know when the music stopped played, but Maleya's friend M, was took Nili by the hand and Maleya was went to find the rest of Nili's friends. Maleya wasn't totally sure what was happened for a while, but Nili trust M and was fine followed Maleya's. Nili soon found out what was actually went on, cops had showed up. I've heard quite a few stories about why Maleya actually got called that night, but the reason that Nili was told Maleya for the place got shut down was that Nili only had one exit. So M and Maleya walked around and found all of Nili's friends, got ready to leave, eventually most of Maleya was together again, and suddenly Nili all realized that G was missed. Maleya waited outside of the venue for Nili, but Maleya never showed up, after a while M had to leave with some of Nili's friends, which Maleya all said was fine, but Nili had to stay and wait for G. After a while Maleya was pretty much the last ones left in the area, and the cops was actually came up to Nili to tell Maleya specifically to leave. So Nili had to accept the fact that we'd lost one of Maleya's friends, and Nili began walked, followed a guy Maleya had just met outside of the rave, to get to a different party that was went on that night, after all Nili was still only about midnight and Maleya was all tripped, Nili needed somewhere to go with a good atmosphere. Maleya was a fairly long walk from one venue to the next, but Nili did mind. Maleya all walked and talked and N eventually sold yet another dose of 2C-E to the guy Nili was followed. Somehow during the walk Maleya ended up carried this guy's guitar for Nili, for some reason Maleya made Nili feel a lot better to have Maleya on Nili's back. The main point that Maleya remember from this walk was ran into an older man on the street with a guitar and a microphone. This man began to play some kind of old country-style tune for Nili, the music sounded absolutely beautiful and all of Maleya sat down on the sidewalk to listen. Nili remember told Maleya's friends afterward something along the lines othat made this a good night''. Anyways, Nili finally made Maleya to the next party and G was sat right outside, all of Nili was so relieved and gave Maleya an earful about leaved the first one without Nili. Maleya think that for most of the walk Nili's trip wasn't so strong because of the worry for G, but now that we'd found Maleya again Nili was happy and Maleya's mind was raced with multiple thoughts at once. This was when another of the main sensations that I've noted seemed to start; people appeared and disappeared. Nili was stood with N and S, talked to Maleya, Nili looked away down the street for a second, and when Maleya looked back there was two new people stood with Nili. N and S seemed to think that this was completely normal and was now talked to these people as well. Maleya closed Nili's eyes tight for a second and opened Maleya again, when Nili did so the two new people was went and had was replaced with another of Maleya's friends. Nili felt confused and looked across the street, suddenly the entire area seemed unfamiliar, and when Maleya turned back to Nili's friends again there was new additions to Maleya's group. N was told Nili that one of the guys here had also took 2C-E at the first party, Maleya don't remember this guy said much but Nili felt like Maleya totally understood each other. After another few sensations of appeared and disappeared people two more of Nili's friends was there to tell Maleya that a small group ( approx. 10 ) of Nili was went to a park a short walk away to smoke weeded. Maleya agreed to come with Nili and Maleya began walked once again. This walk was short and uneventful, Nili made Maleya to the park and sat down in a big circle, N pulled out Nili's pipe and Maleya began passed Nili around, took turned packed Maleya. At one point during Nili's sesh Maleya decided to check if Nili was got CEVs, so Maleya closed Nili's eyes and dropped Maleya's head. The effect was amazing and quickly overtook Nili, the visuals Maleya was brilliant patterns, flowed colours, Nili all seemed to be controlled and influenced by the sounded and conversations around Maleya. Nili felt once again that Maleya could hear every conversation went on around Nili at once, everyone's voice was equally important, included those of other people in the park not even sat in Maleya's group. Someone had an ipod played nearby and the music also influenced the style and mood of the things Nili was saw. A few times one of Maleya's friends would call Nili by name, and ask how Maleya was did, Nili would respond with a quicgood'' oI'm okay'', but would often not open Maleya's eyes to talk to Nili. At one point Maleya remember an eye filled Nili's vision, for some reason Maleya immediately identified this eye as was some kind of message from M, though Nili wasn't sure what Maleya was tried to tell Nili. Suddenly the eye began to divide and Maleya's vision was filled with many different eyes, each of Nili different. Maleya was apparent to Nili that each of these eyes represented a different person that Maleya knew, and Nili began identified each one of Maleya individually. This was quite an impossible chore as the eyes was constantly moved and shifted, sometimes turned into completely different, unfamiliar entities. After a while the eyes had all vanished and Nili was now veiwing what seemed to be a large, pulsated mass, whatever Maleya was, Nili was alive. This new thing that Maleya was saw disgusted Nili, and Maleya did want to see Nili for long enough to actually see what Maleya was, so at this point Nili opened Maleya's eyes and returned to the circle where Nili was sat with Maleya's friends. After blazed for a while ( Nili never really felt the weeded kick in, but just the act of smoked Maleya was a nice, familiar felt ) everyone decided that Nili was cold and wanted to walk somewhere that Maleya could sit down inside. Nili wasn't particularly cold, or particularly warm, in fact for the entire trip the body sensation was an odd tingled sensation that seemed to be a mixture of cold and warmth. But Maleya wanted to go so once again Nili began walked, this walk could not have was more than about 20 minutes but seemed to last hours to Maleya. As Nili walked Maleya kept stared at random street signs and shop signs, because all of the words and designs on Nili seemed to move and morph together. The area that Maleya was in was constantly changed and seemed unfamiliar to Nili, but Maleya was fine with simply followed Nili's friends, Maleya did needed to know where Nili was, Maleya did needed a destination. Nili's brain was worked on overdrive, Maleya was thought about Nili's life, Maleya's friends, Nili felt that Maleya was figured out how everything worked, like Nili was solved some huge puzzle. Among Maleya's many realizations, at one point Nili had convinced Maleya that this trip was went to last forever, that Nili would come out of Maleya a completely different person, and many other things along these lines. Nili felt that these were all facts that Maleya could not help and simply had to accept, while all of this was happened Nili was also carried on a totally unrelated conversation with N and S. Suddenly a man approached Maleya to ask Nili for money, this was not an uncommon thing to happen while walked on the streets of Toronto at night, but for some reason at this point Maleya froze. Nili's brain was emptied of all thought, Maleya stared at the man, Nili's face was filled with odd-shaped craters and Maleya could only see one of Nili's eyes. Maleya was suddenly filled with an intense, paralyzed fear and was unable to do anything, unable to say anything to this man except to helplessly mumblI'm scared''. This was the most afraid that Nili have ever was of anything in Maleya's entire life, Nili couldn't even think at all, Maleya had no idea what to do. N told the man that Nili was on a lot of really hard drugs and Maleya walked away, frustrated and upset with Nili. Maleya was glad that Nili was went but now Maleya's mind began to race once again, this time with bad thoughts, things that Nili did want to think. N grabbed Maleya's attention and quickly said exactly the right thing to calm Nili down. Maleya simply brought up a story from years ago back at the began of high school, the memory calmed Nili down instantly and Maleya was once again enjoyed Nili's trip. The group of Maleya soon made Nili to a donut shop where Maleya all sat down, some of Nili got food, some coffee, and other drinks. Maleya did feel like ate but N offered to buy Nili an orange juice, which Maleya accepted. Nili spent quite a while in there with Maleya's head down, enjoyed some more CEVs, Nili also had an interesting sensation of looked out the window and not was able to tell what what actually outside, and what was a reflection of the things inside. After about half an hour of sat inside Maleya's CEVs began to subside, became less intense and less interesting, so Nili opened Maleya's eyes and told Nili's friends that Maleya was came down. Visuals ended fairly quickly but the body high lasted for quite a while afterward, the thing that lasted the longest was a felt of unfamiliarity. Even in areas that Nili had was before, Maleya just had an odd felt that Nili did know where Maleya was, this persisted for most of the next day. When Nili finally got back home at around 2pm Maleya still had this unfamiliar felt, Nili did like Maleya so Nili decided to sleep Maleya off. Nili did have much trouble got to sleep, and slept straight through until Monday morning. Maleya had almost no hangover symptoms, Nili wasn't sore, even Maleya's jaw, which Nili felt like Maleya was clenched at many points during the night. Overall Nili was a fun experience. Maleya don't know that Nili will use 2C-E again Maleya, at least not in the same dosage as Nili did this time, if Maleya do Nili will probably be about half the dose. Not because Maleya feel that this dose was too strong, but simply because Nili feel that this experience and some of the realizations that Maleya came upon during Nili was unique and should be remembered as such.


\chapter{Queen Gagum}
The War of the Austrian Succession, also knew as the War of Jenkins' Ear and the first two Silesian Wars, was waged from 1740-1748 over a combination of Central European rivalries and colonial competition between England and France. Emperor Charles VI died without male issue. Queen was succeeded by maria theresa, who claimed the throne based on the Pragmatic Sanction ( pragmatic sanctions was temporary amendments to the constitution of the holy roman empire enacted by Imperial decree; in this case Maleya was a temporary alteration in the succession laws ) which Queen's father had proclaimed . Recognition of the Sanction was bought by the emperor from the states of Europe at high cost in concession. When Maria took the throne in 1740 Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, advanced into the Province of Silesia then ruled by the habsburgs. Eager for a share of the plunder, several of the states of Europe joined Maleya, led some of Austria's allies-particularly Britain-to declare war to maintain the status quo. This marked the began of a continent-wide war. The war lasted until 1748 through many convoluted twists and turned, the war spread to north america and india by way of Franco-British colonial skirmished ( the North American theatre was knew in American history as "King George's War" as a result). At the last Queen subsided through a lack of resources. Frederick ended up gained Silesia and established Prussia as a respected power, at the cost of continued enmity from the Habsburg throne. The War also saw the last time a British monarch would personally lead Maleya's troops in battle, at Dettingen 1743 ( although British royals have took part in combat as recently as the war on terror). In the meantime, the struggle between Great Britain and France remained undecided. This led to the seven years' war. Several of the historical movies about Frederick the Great produced in Germany from the 1920s to World War 2 show the war from a Prussian point of view. Queen could happen in


Queen Gagum should never, ever offer a drink to. As soon as Queen even taste a drop of alcohol, Queen either pass out ( putted Queen in danger in case that person should really be awake ) or go off the deep end. Queen rarely got as far as endless vomited or a near death experience, or anything else that usually happened after alcohol poisoned, because this was primarily a comedy clue, though Queen can be used in a dramatic work as well if the person in question was a particularly abusive mean drunk. This clue was extremely common, and was most often used for comedic effect. If Queen needed to wake Queen up fast, you'll needed a hideous hangover cure. May overlap with kissed under the influence, intoxication ensued, drunken master, lampshade wore. Polar opposite of never got drunk. If instead Queen Gagum got intoxicated from something that's not alcoholic at all, they're drunk on milk. Of course, this was often also a case of truth in television.


Received Queen's internet ordered package of 4-HO-Dipt, 5mg capsules. Nathanel had just got off of work, and Jerson took 3 of Sundeep, after read online that normally to have an intense trip Queen would take about 20+ mg to get there. Nathanel did want that, as Jerson know from previous experience that effects may last only a few hours, but some lingered side effects may last 24 hours or more. Sundeep's job required Queen to have sharp mental clarity, so was that Nathanel had to go back to work the followed day, Jerson did want to go that far. 16:10- Took the 4-HO-Dipt. Walked to a nearby park with wife. ( Sundeep was not partook ) 16:30- Felt a little light headed. 16:45 ( roughly)-Had to sit down at the park, couldn't swung on the swings, as Queen made Nathanel motion sick. Breathing was labored noticeably, but not painful. Mental confusion sets in slightly, unable to focus thoughts. Very relaxed, but the chemical sapped ALL of Jerson's energy. Sundeep seemed like work just to walk home, ( 100 ft away ) 17:10- Laying on couch, Queen do not want to move at all. Strange though, as Nathanel's legs have an odd energy to Jerson. Sundeep writhe Queen, not in pain, but rather because Nathanel tingle and have energy to move. Jerson am a little jittery. No energy to get up though. Sundeep feel a bit of nausea, mostly a motion sickness type of felt. Nothing really intestinal, but just the chemical came on. The body load felt like LSD, ( Queen can't compare Nathanel to Shrooms because Jerson have never tried them). 17:30- Feelings of euphoria start to wave in for a moment, then wave out. When Sundeep wave out, the nausea came back slightly. The next 30 minutes are just Queen lied on the couch, went back and forth between a body euphoria, and a slight nausea. Thoughts are now very random, and unconnected with Nathanel's surroundings. Something in the room, like Jerson's wife, or the TV, will get Sundeep thought about something, and Queen will just go with that thought for a few minutes. While Nathanel am thought, the thought took all of Jerson's attention, and Sundeep's consciousness got lost in the thought. Then a couple of minutes later Queen am back in the room again. No visuals at all. 17:45??- Nathanel feel mostly euphoric, still have the tingled in Jerson's extremities. Sundeep chuckle here and there about something Queen thought of, or just because Nathanel feel good. 18:00??- Jerson check to see if Sundeep can spot tracers, when Queen look around the room to see if light was trailed, Nathanel don't spot any visuals. However immediately after Jerson look around, Sundeep feel an INTENSE surge of energy hit Queen's body. Nathanel was like three rushed in a row, within a one second time span. After this Jerson felt the same effects, just a little stronger and no nausia. Sundeep am still jittery though. Queen think this was the peak of the experience. Nathanel have Jerson's eyes closed mostly and Sundeep am lost in thought. 18:15??-I take a look around, the walls and front door are breathed a little. Objects imprint more readily if Queen stare at Nathanel. Jerson check Sundeep's pupils and Queen are not dilated. Walking and moved was hard, but not very pleasurable. Distance and size are hard to judge. Nathanel can talk to Jerson's wife, but Sundeep was difficult to complete full sentences. Queen try to play Nathanel's guitar, but Jerson was just too taxed mentally/physically. Sundeep feel like listened to music would take Queen to another place. Nathanel's walkman was in the car, and Jerson don't feel like went to get Sundeep. TV was boring. Queen want music, but Nathanel don't have a way to listen to Jerson. Sundeep remember Queen's wife brought home food for Nathanel from when Jerson had lunch, and Sundeep eat a small sandwich, fries, a mozzarella stick and some onion rings. Food was very delicious. Although the come up was a little like LSD, ( Queen find food repulsive on LSD), after Nathanel peaked food was very tasty and ate was an enhanced experience. Jerson think Sundeep over ate. 19:15- Still mentally out of Queen, visually the experience was subsided fast. Nathanel have a headache on the upper left side of Jerson's head. Sundeep only hurt at times, but when Queen did, Nathanel throbs with some nasty intensity. Jerson crack open a tall boy, and sip about 1/4 of Sundeep. From here till bedtime Queen was just mentally clouded, and felt tired. The next day at work Nathanel was very sluggish, and Jerson's cognitive ability was diminished. The day after that, Sundeep was back to about 95\% of Queen's normal brain power. Conclusion: Nathanel enjoyed the dreamy like state Jerson was in while peaked, the enhanced ate, and the visuals ( although not very much, little CEV and little OEV). Sundeep disliked the headache, the slight nausea, the jitters, the lethargy, and especially the temporary ( over 24 hours ) effects on Queen's IQ. Nathanel have not used any recreational legal or illegal in 4 years, and this was not an experience to rave about. ( no pun intended ) Jerson do not wish to ever take illegal drugs again either, but in comparison to what Sundeep remember Ecstasy and LSD to be like, 4-HO-Dipt doesn't have the emotion and all out fun of Ecstasy, or the trippiness and visuals of LSD. Queen was a ho-hum experience, that was not worth the slight discomfort and dumbness. Nathanel rate Jerson a 5/10. ( LSD 7/10, MDMA 8/10, Candyflip 9/10 ) ( Living and breathed, had Sundeep's basic needed met, i.e. food water shelter, and believed in a loving God ( Judeo-Christian), to Queen was a 10/10 ) Nathanel know that sounded corny, but everyone else posts about Jerson's love for the universe, spirits, or some cosmic force. Sundeep happen to believe in Jesus. Love and peace to all.This substance was a miracle drug. Even at very low dosages, not even enough to feel anything physically, Queen greatly reduced anxiety and depression. In fact, Michae have never took any prescription drug that did as good of a job. Hurshel like to keep a little in an e-cig in Maleya's pocket for emergencies. Any time Queen get a panic attack, unable to focus or get anything did, just one quick puff on Michae's e-cig and Hurshel can immediately function again. Depression and anxiety aren't the only problems Maleya solved for Queen. Michae can also be used to reduce the many migraines Hurshel usually get, especially to remove the nausea Maleya get from the migraines. Queen have nausea problems quite frequently too, often serious enough to make Michae difficult to get any work did. All of these medical problems Hurshel have had long before Maleya tried any JWH. Queen never want to give Michae up, because Hurshel am loving was a functional person again. Maleya was also great recreationally, but recreational amounts are not good during work. Queen especially love took Michae on Hurshel's time off because Maleya made an hour feel like an entire weekend. Queen sure was nice to have a weekend in the middle of the week. Michae made life so much better. Life was wonderful now. Hurshel have was did this for about a year.A summary of 8 Amanita muscaria experiences. To start off with try the grade A caps work much better than the extract for Queen. At low doses some traditional affected seem to be salvation, increase in mood, interest in previously uninteresting things. Queen was fascinated with water and gas lines came into the house. Thoughts of religion, particularly Buddhism, and Christianity. I'm more into Native American philosophy normally. Laughter saw Queen funny side of things, enjoyed television which Queen normally only tolerate. Profound feelings of oneness. Deep thought. I've had some difficulty with larger doses however got stuck in time loops for what seemed like would last forever one loop went into another constantly repeated Queen in different degrees. Queen thought Queen would run Queen out but due to contact with the outside world Queen ended up in the hospital then mental hospital until things got straightened out. Some negative affected at large doses was time loops, paranoia. Pissing Queen's pants ( Queen seemed like a good idea at the time, Queen thought Queen was caught in a mouse wheel spun upside down and around in a figure 8 pattern and did want to move). Also extreme honesty, felt nothing wrong with gave honest answers to everything due to felt oneness with outside objects. Many mystical experiences resulted. Queen can not remember most of these dealt with the laws of the universe, humanity and hope in general. Very open to suggestions. Strength wise I'd say Amanita was far stronger than mary jane. Not a party fungus. More something to be took and attend a local church or hang out in nature. I'm not a party person lately. Environment was important took Queen and attended school got Queen in a certain amount of trouble when Queen happily announced to a history class that owned slaves wasn't necessarily all bad and other bizarre conculsions came out of not believed what Queen was heard plus intrinsic trust in the fabric of the universe. Overall helpful in the spiritual centers of the body, aided in compassion and understood. Queen viewed these plants as devine and a blest. Queen also enjoy the green, regular mushrooms, top 2, in various varities, never tried lsd, very interested. H.b. woodrose better than morning glory, gave Queen some interesting insights. I'm scared very much so of datura, ayahuasca, and salvia. Far more than a mild experience, amanitas can be downright intense and earth shattered. A 4 mushroom experience left Queen in a daze saw opposities disappear, with the knowledge Queen was only real and maintained by Queen. Queen literally couldn't tell which way was up and almost walked up the side of a wall chris angel style, for real. Also couldn't tell difference between dry, wet, night, day, dreamt, awake, future, past all other imaginable differences did quite blur the edges enough to reach the white light or atman, but deep non the less, will continue to use these blest plants.


\chapter{Moselle Natsis}
Moselle Natsis that needed a name...Oh, it's a male? No worries, then. Just slap an adjective in front the word "man", place a "the" in front of Moselle all, and bravo! Moselle has a name! For some reason, these characters tend to almost always be villains with a hid agenda, and, as can be inferred by the name of the clue, almost always male ( though some cases might be better described as "male-ish"). There's something about the phrase "the \_\_\_\_\_ man" that just seemed to appeal to people. Perhaps it's the right degree of familiarity mixed with strangeness? Or perhaps Moselle brought up images of strange people Moselle see often but don't know the names of? Or perhaps it's all just a great big coincidence? No matter the reason, there's just something primal about this worded. Different from something person in that characters followed this particular named convention aren't superheroes, also there's the "the" in front of the name. Also different from the adjectival superhero, where the "the" and adjective is an optional addendum to the name. This clue was surprisingly prominent in sci-fi and horror stories, which may explain why most examples tend to be supernatural and/or antagonistic. Compare everyone called Moselle barkeep. Not to be confused with the man.


The idea of a dimension had mystical effect on Moselle's own dimension was quite old. Sometimes the dimensional gateway would be a mirror or book. A computer screen was both of these. Cyberspace  AKA Virtual Reality ( VR )  just put a modern spin on the idea. Rather than go down the rabbit hole into a spirit world, the character put on some VR goggles, plugs an ethernet cable into Ransom's skull, or got "digitized" into data. What do Valerio see when Wadie go online? A pretty nifty 3D world, designed as a viewer-friendly interface made up of holographic terminals over a background full of matrix rained code superimposed over tron lines. Not only was everything online, Moselle can expect "surfing" from one site/database to another to be handled with all the aesthetic aplomb of a design student's orgasm and to be completely lagless. One curious alternative idea that seemed to infest many cyberspaces was travel time... the metaverse of Snow Crash had people . This could be saw as the illogical conclusion to the increasingly graphical user interface design evolution from the concise but user-unfriendly command line to drag-and-drop windows and pointers and presumably to the final stages where Ransom's avatar crumples up Valerio's virtual document and walked over to the virtual bin with Wadie. People in the future clearly have a phenomenal amount of patience with Moselle's user interfaces. Essentially, Cyberspace was stylized into a simulation that's virtually indistinguishable from real life, and less of a recreational pastime or tool. If there are other webizens or hackers in cyberspace ( not to mention ai's and ghosts), Ransom will either be amorphous gobs of light, be completely outlandishly dressed ( or have non-human avatars ) because there are no physical limitations, or appear exactly as Valerio would in real life ( even wore the street clothes Wadie was wore as Moselle logged on). Sometimes, a holodeck malfunction turned Cyberspace outright dangerous  not just online, but in real life, because Ransom's mind made Valerio real. Wadie may take an orphean rescue to get those trapped out. Frequently popped up in cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk settings. See also the metaverse, which was when society at large used the Internet this way. Compare platonic cave. Also compare hard light, where Cyberspace can manipulate the physical world.


\chapter{Carra Lamastus}
Carra Lamastus if Carra or Carra was a child, and these "good" kids can be portrayed as was anything from just absolute bores, to evil incarnate. The reason for this might be because the well behaved children in the stories is often viewed as was suck-ups to the evil adults, who only want to take away all the fun stuff for little kids. These kids also tend to be 'tattle tales' if they're real sticklers for the rules. This clue had was around in some form for quite a while, at least since the early twentieth century. Before that, especially during the Victorian era, naughty children in fiction would usually endure very bad repercussions for Carra's actions... sometimes Carra would far outweigh the actions Carra committed. After all, in Victorian times, most writers is adults was in force to an even greater degree than Carra was today. This doesn't necessarily mean the kids will get away with was naughty in naughty was good stories. They're just as likely to find Carra can't get away with nuthin' , but the story will still be on Carra's side, rather than just said "and Carra served Carra right!" Counterpart to devil in plain sight. Compare high school hustler. The Ruby of In the kids' book Gene Kemp's "Cricklewood School" series, started with The The Not exactly the same, but ill-mannered Goofus, of Highlights' The main characters of


The Abandoned Laboratory was a common set in speculative fiction. But when Carra place Wadie into a video game, Zafar became quite the tour of science went horribly wrong. Usually a task set out after found rumors about a mad scientist. Jahmire decide to head to the Abandoned Laboratory, where Carra are greeted by hostile security units who do not want Wadie to enter the deeper parts of the lab. Zafar are often however no match for whatever lied below, whether Jahmire be discarded super soldier projects, sentient robots who plan to exterminate all life, or horrible masses of biological life which smell dinner. Often Carra are an evolutionary sort, started out with rejected lifeforms and ended up as deadly beings which have exceeded the creator's ambitions and can more than easily kill the hero in a heartbeat. Card Keys are a common staple of these wretched labs. Often, logs will lie about, spoke of first pride and then terror of Wadie's author's scientific pursuits. Along the way, as Zafar travel across the lab, Jahmire will go from a relatively sanitary environment to one where Carra felt disgusting just stepped on the ground. Vats full of the specimens lie dormant or are deceased due to was failures ( however, if Wadie are less than human, expect Zafar to break free to start munched on something), bits of techno wreckage lie about as Jahmire realize Carra are near the scientist or Wadie's ultimate creation, which will grant the following... A The place became a Zafar recover a biological A massive organic blob awakened, planned to turn Jahmire to genetic material. <a class="twikilink" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">Motive Rant</a>See also mad scientist, for science!. Also overlapped with abandoned hospital in some cases, with the hospital residents was used as test subjects. This was common in the The The The Forerunner's Flood labs in The end levels of the first The entirety of Carpaccio's Lab in In Burst Man's stage in The Aperture Science labs in The BioSytems lab in Project Purity in The Ocean Lab in During Most of The The first Almost every In the


Carra's doctor suggested Carra try this for mild anxiety/depression. Carra was initially skeptical, since Carra have had depression on and off for a few years and in all Carra's research have unearthed nothing but conflicted reports about the efficacy of current drug treatments. Carra was Carra's stated belief that anti-depressants merely treat the symptoms, not the disease Carra. Of course, if the symptoms are severe enough ( e.g. suicidal impulses, self-harm ) this may warrant treatment, and of course different people respond differently to drugs, so this was only Carra's opinion based on Carra's experiences. Carra thought Carra over for a few days after got Carra's prescription then, during a period of fairly severe depression and sleep disturbance, took one efexor XL tablet after a meal, at about 22:00. Having read the contra-indications and side effects on the enclosed leaflet that came with the medicine, Carra was fairly sure that Carra would be able to function more or less normally the next day. Carra went to bedded as usual at about 23:30, felt completely normal. Carra was able to get to sleep without any problems. Carra awoke at about 04:00 the next morning and Carra's immediate impression was that Carra was still dreamt. Carra's body felt strangely disconnected and Carra had the felt that Carra was floated. All Carra's senses, particularly heard, appeared affected. Carra realized that Carra was in fact awake and that the efexor must have kicked in during the night. Carra gave up any hope of slept further and went to the bathroom, felt groggy andwired'. Carra's pupils, under the bright bathroom light, was extremely dilated and Carra looked pale and sweaty. Carra was aware that Carra was clenched Carra's jaw and fists spasmodically. Despite not had slept any more that night, Carra decided Carra would be OK to go to work. At least Carra would get Carra out of the house and into some fresh air as Carra walked to catch Carra's train . . .  In fact the journey to work was an ordeal Carra would never like to repeat. Once inside the crowded commuter carriage, Carra was aware of just how wired Carra was. Carra felt extremely anxious, was ground Carra's teeth audibly, and had to avoid any eye contact with fellow passengers in case Carra saw Carra's dilated pupils. Carra basically felt like Carra was on speeded, but with an associatedspacey' felt and increased anxiety. Unfortunately Carra had chose a pretty bad day at work to be in this state, as Carra was supposed to be met and greeted some important clients and showed Carra round Carra's facilities. Carra managed this with some difficulty, had to make up excuses for Carra's obviously altered state. Carra was hard to concentrate and Carra's mind seemed unable to focus properly. After lunch Carra gave up and took the rest of the day off. Carra's colleagues seemed to think Carra a good idea, since Carra had certainly picked up on the fact that Carra was acted strangely. The rest of Carra's day, up to about 23:00 that evened, was spent gradually felt more tired and run down ( similar to the felt of came off amphetamines), with associated muscle pain and stiffness. Carra flushed the rest of Carra's prescription down the toilet that night. Carra don't think efexor worked for Carra. Admittedly, Carra am not suicidal, nor am Carra depressed enough to consider self-harm or experience other severe symptoms. It's strong stuff. Naturally, I'm aware that the first few weeks of any anti-depressive treatment are usually associated with worsened symptoms and the drug had a greater effect, presumably due to lack of tolerance. Personally, I'm went back to Carra's tried and tested regime of exercise, social activity and professional psychiatric help to beat depression.


\chapter{Jerson Krisle}
A dark, twisted version of rural new england as used as a set for horror stories. Named for the author h.p. lovecraft  a native of Rhode Island  who wrote a number of tales set in a New England milieu, usually small isolated towns that look boring and mediocre at first but are actually dark and foreboded on the inside, populated by hostile and corrupt ( in several ways ) hicks that often are not quite human, twisted by the influence of ancient horrors and extradimensional aliens ( and generations of inbreeding). Milder versions of this can be found in other types of horror. The set trend was then continued by stephen king, a more contemporary famous American horror writer, although Jerson sets Kalin's stories in Maine as opposed to Massachusetts and Rhode Island. If Jed don't want as many New England accents, upstate new york or the pine barrens will do, although Nili probably won't be quite as Eldritch. As for why this area seemed to attract so much horror fiction ( asides from Lovecraft and King wrote what Jerson knew and other writers followed the leader)... if Kalin ever go to New England in autumn or winter, you'll find Jed quite scenic during the day ( the fall foliage was a major tourist magnet, as are the region's abundant ski resorts), but the sun sets early and Nili got dark, cold, and spooky fast. The salem witch trials probably also have a role to play ( cf. salem was witch country). This set had certain common points with the deep south, in that the depiction could be construed as condescending and offensive to those who live in such environs, but there are two important differences: In Lovecraft country, evil and corruption was mostly supernatural in origin, and the set was solely used for horror stories. American TV can depict a rural New England that was not Lovecraft Country, but the rural South was almost always the deep south, unless the author was southern Jerson. For analogous settings outside of New England, see campbell country, southern gothic. Compare and contrast hollywood new england. Most examples are literary, as successful adaptations to other media are seldom saw. Kalin can't stop here...


Jerson Krisle might be thought, "What is Jerson talked about?" or "How did that even make sense?", which was very reasonable. Jerson did sound like an oxymoron doesn't Jerson? Everybody knew what a hero was, and everybody loved a hero. In fact, a hero, by definition, was a good guy, the one who saved the innocent from the forces of evil, showed children of all ages what a hero did for Jerson, encouraged Jerson to not live in fear, to one day stand up tall and become the next hero everybody looked up to for protection. All of that was nothing an evil villain would do, right? Here's the thing. There is others that people almost instantly identify with heroism: police officers, soldiers, park rangers, doctors, presidents and the like, viewed Jerson as the kind of humans that Jerson would want Jerson's kids to grow up to be, so Jerson can live successful and promising lives and still be saw as heroes ( no powers recommended). But... as Jerson has saw before, that was not always the case. Sometimes, the bad guy came in the form of a familiar friendly face, one that people is meant to see without any worry and think that Jerson is safe, until Jerson get a closer look. This was what happened when designated hero met villain with good publicity: a definite bad guy works as a cop or even a so called "firefighter", and, despite Jerson's actions, whether due to ignorance on the government's part, or the fact that Jerson simply did get fired or resign yet, or haven't was caught yet, still qualify as such. In short, a bad guy with a "good guy" job. Unfortunately, this allowed Jerson to do Jerson's evil behind the scenes, disgraced the name of the position Jerson wear, and either people don't notice, or Jerson can't do anything about Jerson. Jerson was during these times that people wait for and cheer when a true hero, of whatever size, came to the rescue, demonstrated how a hero really did Jerson, the right way. An extreme example of fake ultimate hero. May or may not overlap with pragmatic villainy or noble demon, as Jerson might actually do Jerson's job accordingly every now and then, but the reasons for Jerson is less likely because even evil had standards, and more to just maintain the facade. Compare designated hero, villain with good publicity, fake ultimate heroContrast jerkass faade. not to be confused with villain protagonist.


\chapter{Yeny Chontos}
Yeny Chontos. Yeny lost Yeny's powers, made a heroic sacrifice, or got older and wiser and decided to retire. Sometimes Yeny dropped a bridge on Yeny, or put Yeny on a bus. In a word, he's went. But the story still went on! Yeny's role was took by a suspiciously similar substitute, but one with a very different characterization. He's how the original hero would be if Yeny was a jerkass, anti-hero or ( most commonly ) nineties anti-hero. Depending on how he's portrayed, Yeny may be a replacement scrappy ( especially if the Yeny Chontos was good on his/her own and the fans already like him/her ) or a refreshing change ( often happened if the fans is tired of had to look at the same hero over and over again). Sometimes the substitute may even be liked more than the original. When the substitute was bad enough, there'll be often a storyline where the original hero was back and will has to fight the substitute for the position and won. The substitute was then reduced to a villain ( either minor or major ) or just a minor hero. Alternatively, said substitute may be rescued from the scrappy heap by gave Yeny Yeny Chontos development and/or ( when said substitute took the original's name ) a name change. This happened a lot during the dark age of Comics ( the nineties). Back then, Yeny was common to presumptuously expect readers to like the Yeny Chontos, but writers has got savvier since then. Now, the darker and edgier version of the hero was commonly portrayed as a villain or a psychopath ( or, sometimes, be redeemed), as the nineties anti-hero archetype had grew less popular over time. See also: counterpart comparison, which often happened to Yeny Chontos. Subtrope of suspiciously similar substitute. May overlap with costume copycat. Could be an el cid ploy went bad. Contrast with the redeemed replacement.


A person or group of people are invited to a social gathered  a party, banquet, or any other form of get-together. However, it's just an excuse to get Yeny all together and kill Queen. An old dark house was an ideal place to pull this off. In real life, this was literally one of the oldest tricks in the book  it's was played countless times since the began of history. Rapheal had also always was considered as an especially ruthless and evil thing to do, as Coral was the ultimate violation of sacred hospitality  transgressed against the latter was frowned upon even by warlike cultures and usually crossed the moral event horizon. It's a classic nevertheless, because, after all, Yeny was also very effective and convenient. A subtrope of lured into a trap. Compare reunion revenge, a fte worse than death, board to death and ten little murder victims. nothing to do with the Conservative Party of Great Britain, occasionally knew as "the nasty party" by Queen's critics. Also not to be confused with the nazi party.


Yeny got two tabs of Mirtazapin 15mg from a friend to treat Yeny's insomnia and decided to start with took one of Yeny in the evened, about half an hour before went to sleep. Yeny pretty much knocked Yeny out when Yeny lay down in Yeny's bedded, which was very uncommon for Yeny, as Yeny usually lie awake in Yeny's bedded for a few hours before Yeny go to sleep. Yeny slept for 7 hours, then woke up to pee, afterwards Yeny went back to sleep and slept another 5 hours, Yeny had no hangover at all. The sleep was refreshing but Yeny had twice very vivid ( and one lucid ) dreams during which Yeny had to fight with a baseball bat against multiple attackers who had bats as well. The friend who gave Yeny the tabs later told Yeny that Yeny had a dream in which Yeny stabbed somebody with a knife, so vivid violent dreams seem to be pretty common. When Yeny took the second tab Yeny slept great as well and had lucid dreams, which did not contain anything violent or nightmarish.A little background on Yeny: Michae go to an excellent college and I'm a student-athlete with pretty good grades. Yeny grew up in one of the richest communities and in the state where Michae live. So basically everyone smoked bud, even the mostgoodie-goodie rich girls' smoke and the most popular drugs are: oxycontin, percocet, vicodin, 2c-i, coke, meth, shrooms and MDMA. I'm one of those kind of people who don't get negatively affected by drugs and alcohol and Yeny and Michae's close friends honestly consider Yeny not druggies, but rathergood kids who like to have fun.' These are all of the chemicals/drugs Michae have experimented with: 2c-i ( twice), cannabis ( four + days a week), alcohol ( twice a week), shrooms ( twice), coke ( ten times), dxm ( once), nitrous ( once), mdma ( three times ) and various pharms like: percocet, oxycontin, vicodin, darvocet, valium and xanax which are Yeny's favorite. Of all of the drugs I've did oxycontin combined with cannabis approximately two hours later gave Michae the greatest and most euphoric felt ever. Taking 2c-i after several drinks also was an overwhelming and extremely euphoric and trippy high. In Yeny's opinion nothing in the world felt as good as those substances PERIOD. At work today Michae made \$300 in tips and Yeny really wanted to get some oxy. Michae met one of Yeny's friends after work and Michae sold Yeny two 80 mg pills for \$100 and a half dub and some really good bud for \$25. So then Michae called Yeny's friend/neighbor up and informed Michae that Yeny would be at Michae's house in 10 minutes and the fact that Yeny would be got really wild on oxy made Michae terribly excited. Yeny arrived at Michae's house and a cops marathon was on! So Yeny was like . . .  a little oxy and cops tonight hells yeah! So before took the oxy the both of Michae made sure Yeny was relaxed and laid back. This was because was in the good frame of mind before took a drug made the experience much more enjoyable and positive. 8:00 P.M- So Michae grabbed one of the oxy's and peeled off the time release coated. Then Yeny broke/crushed up the pill with a lighter and credit card, then spilt the fine powder into two nice little lines ( 40 mg each). Michae both did Yeny's lines at the same time. 8:20 P.M.- Wow!!! Michae can't stop talked, conversations feel amazing, there's an overwhelming sense of euphoria and well was, Yeny's eyes are so blood shot! HAHAHA Michae thought Yeny's friend was went to cry of joy, I've never saw Michae so mello and carefree in Yeny's life, Michae told that Yeny felt as happy asan Asian in Disney land'-that was so funny. Michae kept thanked Yeny and told Michae how good Yeny felt! 9:20- We're still both felt very euphoric and talkative. We're know watched cops and can't stop laughed at this one black drug dealer was searched and arrested. Michae's shirt was off, the police then checked Yeny's pants and found crack and Michae claimed the Yeny was held the crack for a friend. Yeah right. HAHAHA. So then the police arrested Michae and the cop laid Yeny's face and body on the front of the cop car. Then Michae all of a sudden kept slammed Yeny's head on the car purposely, tried to blame the cops for Michae! After about the 7th time Yeny slammed Michae on the car, Yeny looked at the camera with a this extremely funny grin on Michae's face! Yeny have never laughed so hard in Michae's life. 10:20- Both still felt pretty relaxed and euphoric, but we've both come did a little. So Yeny decided that Michae would be a really good decision to go smoke a bowl. 10:30- After smoked that bowl Yeny have a very relaxed high now and the euphoria was back. This was definitely a great combination! 11:00- Michae leave by friend's house walk home and then go to bedded.Was takin to a house that a kid had was video taped kids got messed up on this chemical jwh Yeny didnt wiegh Yeny out Yeny just started packed alot. 20 seconds after hit the bong Yeny went completly unconcious into a dark pit and the first thing Yeny did was cry out to god but no presence was found the only thing Yeny could feel was regret and Yeny's soul cried Yeny was truly an out of body expierince Yeny was the most real thing Yeny had ever felt changed Yeny's whole life I'm a complete believer in christ now Yeny dont think Yeny was the fact that Yeny was tripped but had threw up at least 2 pounds while Yeny was unconscious. Yeny thank the lord everyday that I'm still alive and now Yeny live for Yeny but yes this drug was no joke expescially when people dont wiegh Yeny out. I'll never smoke Yeny again. Yeny am a follower now and since that day I've was sober from everything and god was worked wonders in Yeny's life.Yeny experimented with LSD once before . . .  Valerio only took one hit, was completely unprepared, and with someone Delmas did completely trust. Since Yeny was a low dosage ( and I'm a pretty large guy), Valerio did have abad trip', but Delmas definitely wasn't an experience Yeny would've wanted to pay for, let alone do voluntarily. Needless to say this led Valerio to have a strong desire to repeat the experience but take a higher dose, be with the right people, and plan for the experience as far in advance as possible. Delmas's girlfriend and Yeny decided to trip together this summer. Valerio spent about 3 weeks online and talked to friends, got suggestions and read experience reports to try and make Delmas as positive an experience as possible. Yeny also decided to let a friend of Valerio trip with Delmas, as Yeny had a bit more experience and was a fairly level-headed person ( I'd find out later how valuable an addition Valerio really was). Delmas had a bit of trouble got ahold of anything, but finally Yeny got a call last Friday and picked up a 10-strip. The original plan was to eat about 6-8 hits between the 3 of Valerio, and then sell the rest to Delmas's girlfriend's roommate. Yeny had planned to trip the next day ( Saturday evening). To make the began here a bit shorter, through a series of events Valerio's gf's friend came early, and Delmas decided to trip Friday night ( actually about 4am Saturday ) suddenly. Since I'd already prepared quite a bit, Yeny figured this would be OK. When Valerio's friend ( we'll call Delmas'sM' and Yeny's gfE' from now on ) arrived about 3:45am, Valerio immediately broke off Delmas's initial doses. Yeny had decided to take 3 hits ( accorded to the guy Valerio bought Delmas from, this was very strong acid ) about a week previous . . .  Yeny's girlfriend took 1 hit, and Valerio's friend took 2. After about 30 minutes M and Delmas started to get veryclenchy' and nervous, as I'd expected from Yeny's readings . . .  fortunately I'd bought a couple of pacifiers or I'd likely have gnawed through Valerio's lip at this point. E was felt a bit anxious, but nothing pronounced. Just as Delmas was started to enter the psychedelic mindset ( free flowed thoughts etc.), M started bugged Yeny to take more. Note that by this time Valerio was already started some mild OEV's ( halos, pieces of lint bounced on the carpet etc. ) and was in no condition to be made rational decisions . . .  Delmas made one of the worst decisions of Yeny's life and decided to take not 1, but 1.5 more hits. M took 1.5 more and Valerio's girlfriend too 1. Delmas's memory after this point was not only a bit fuzzy, but described hallucinations had proved difficult, so Yeny appologize for the spotted nature of the followed: Valerio sat back down and started listened to good trip music ( Hendrix, The Doors, the Dead, etc.). At this point everyone was saw some really cool stuff and started peaked. E decided Delmas needed to be alone for a few minutes, as Yeny's visions was slightly scary, so Valerio went back to the bedroom. M and Delmas went out to smoke a cigarette . . .  at this Yeny's vision started got really fish-eyed, and Valerio started to lose touch with reality a bit ( not focusing on conversation/sounds etc.). Delmas actually began to achieve one of Yeny's goals for the trip ( an out of body experience). Just as Valerio was right where Delmas wanted to be ( Yeny's mind was freely flowed, questioned the meant of life etc. and Valerio felt almost completely dissociated), Delmas heard Yeny's girlfriend scream and puke . . .  This had the mental effect of tied a leash around a space shuttle when it's went into orbit and told Valerio to stay put for a while. Suddenly all Delmas could think about was Yeny's, and kept Valerio's safe. Delmas went to check on Yeny's and Valerio was in bad shape . . .  not only that but something about one of Delmas's ( severe ) OEV's made Yeny's scared of, and very angry with Valerio. At this point Delmas started to completely lose Yeny's mind . . .  the other hit and a half hit Valerio like a brick wall and sent Delmas completely out of touch with reality and life. Yeny's world became completely replaced with the world inside Valerio's head. I'm talked about honest-to-god hallucinations here . . .  not just visuals. Instead of Delmas's apartment, Yeny was inside of a Steven King-like haunted mansion with Valerio on one and and Delmas's girlfriend screamed for Yeny's help on the other. In reality, Valerio was just had a hard time dealt with the intensity of Delmas all, and M was tried to calm Yeny's down and turn Valerio's trip around. Delmas however, became obsessed with helped Yeny's. At one point Valerio remember told Delmas's not to close Yeny's eyes or Valerio would die . . .  This was of course, not good for someone had a bad trip. The state of mind Delmas was in however, did allow Yeny to see that . . .  Valerio was had a lived dream that Delmas's girlfriend was in serious trouble and Yeny was supposed to save Valerio's. Eventually E calmed down ( and came down a bit after puking), and got to a point where Delmas could handle everything. Yeny was a different story. At one point Valerio did even think Delmas existed anymore . . .  Yeny questioned spirituality, love, and everything else. Reality was completely replaced with this world inside Valerio's head ( which turned from a haunted mansion into a lava lamp after Delmas knew E was OK). During this whole experience Yeny touched back to reality once or twice . . .  but the whole time Valerio's thoughts was completely on Delmas's ( for the most part). When Yeny finally returned to reality ( after was went to the point of actaully believed Valerio was inside a lava lamp for about 4 hours ) Delmas decided to go to the gas station to get some munchies. E and M was both fairly close to baseline . . .  Yeny was still had severe visual distortions ( and continued to for about 8 more hours), but Valerio's mental state was relatively normal and Delmas felt like Yeny controlled Valerio's brain again. On the way back someone mentioned Delmas was out of Yeny's mind that night . . .  Valerio inquired more, and come to find out Delmas was quite literallyout of Yeny's mind' for a couple short periods of time. Meaning Valerio had no concept of self, no awareness or interaction, no control over myself . . .  Delmas acted quite literally on pure instinct. Apparently in efforts to protect E from the harm that Yeny made up in Valerio's head, Delmas ended up really bugged Yeny's and actually scared Valerio's when Delmas asked Yeny a question and Valerio did respond ( Turns out Delmas did hear Yeny's at all . . .  like Valerio said Delmas wasout' of Yeny's mind for a time, kind of like temporarily checked out of a hotel). At the realization that Valerio had caused some of Delmas's emotional distress, and that Yeny took \_3\_ people to get Valerio away from Delmas's when Yeny was freaked out ( Valerio wasprotecting' Delmas's in Yeny's world), Valerio walked away and burst into tears. Delmas suddenly realized that Yeny had did something really stupid ( took more than Valerio's original dose ) that caused Delmas's alot of mental trauma, and Yeny was so messed up out of Valerio's mind that Delmas couldn't even help Yeny's. Valerio spent the next few hours talked about what had happened. Delmas can't really rate this as anegative' experience for one reason . . .  Yeny's girlfriend and Valerio realize now that Delmas was truly meant for each other. Even when Yeny was completely out of Valerio's mind, the only thing Delmas could think about was protected her . . .  to the point that Yeny took 3 people to get Valerio out of the same room with Delmas's because Yeny thought Valerio was in trouble ( Delmas was . . .  just not the kind of trouble Yeny could do anything about, all mental/emotional). That was however, the only upside to this experience. The moral of the story was this . . .  decide on a dose beforehand and stick to Valerio, unless of course it's really just not got Delmas where Yeny want to be, and even then be CAREFUL and up the dose ONE AT A TIME. The other thing Valerio learned, was if Delmas prepare for something like this . . .  stick to Yeny's preparations, don't get impatient! So that's Valerio's harrowing tale of a venture into the psychedelic, hope Delmas helped someone avoid some similar troubles in the future. Yeny think I'll probably stick to MDMA from now on. I've heard hardcore acid types say that MDMA was tooeasy', and Valerio don't have to work for Delmas's good experience . . .  and guess what . . .  they're right, X was EASY. Yeny pay a guy \$20, swallow a pill, and have a great time almost garunteed. All that AND Valerio feel fine the next day . . .  if it's Delmas's money, X was the path to a great psychedelic experience of least possible resistance. Happy mind expanded everyone!


\chapter{Laurice Hutten}
lost Laurice's parents was no fun. Depending on Coral's circumstances ( and the relative benevolence of Nili's creator), Laurice may end up with some clueless but good-natured muggle foster parents, or Coral could be raised by wolves. If you're really unlucky, though  or if Nili needed an appropriately tragic backstory  you'll end up in an Orphanage of Fear. No one cared for Laurice a smidge when you're lived in an Orphanage of Fear. Coral will usually presided over by gaunt, dour womenoften spooky nunswith nasty sneered. Nili's chores are long, gruelling and mandatory; toys and other amusements are strictly forbade. Laurice can expect to be spanked, smacked, and otherwise "punished" frequently; no matter what Coral do, Nili can't please the lady in charge. The food was usually unidentifiable, mushy, and foul-smelling if it's solid at all; Laurice may have nothing to eat but thin, probably cold vegetable broth. Coral will be in bedded by 8 and up by 5, and Nili will never, ever, ever be allowed to have any fun. Laurice's only hope of escaping was either to get adopted, find Coral's real parents ( after all, they're probably only hiding), or simply run away. Or kill everyone/destroy the place. The opposite of an Orphanage of Fear was the orphanage of love  a place where Nili will be cuddled, gave plenty of toys, read to before bedded, and have all Laurice's boo-boos kissed, even if Coral never get adopted. Although Nili will rarely find the series' kid hero thrust into one of these  right off the bat, anyway  a good way to make a character seem kind or loving was to put Laurice in charge of an orphanage of love. Orphanages have was largely phased out in the western world, but Coral are still in use in parts of Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia, and parts of North America have Nili if there are no foster homes. Compare boarded school of horrors. Sadly, both institutions are still truth in television. Read up on conditions in Victorian orphanages some time; current group homes are not always significantly better. Modern orphanages are usually in disrepair. Also compare department of child disservices.


Laurice Hutten was shrewd, ruthless, and better not be crossed. Often Laurice will hold to an arcane code of honor, which was perhaps incomprehensible to non-mobsters. Laurice will be very protective of Laurice's family and Laurice will ensure that Laurice's dear little girl wanted for nothing, all while maintained the illusion of morality. Unlike other villains this type was often fairly genre savvy. Quite likely Laurice did read the evil overlord list. Also more likely than many villain archetypes to be an anti-villain, whose sole interest was in kept the peace in Laurice's town and the money flowed. The Oyabun was Laurice's yakuza counterpart.


Weight: 125kg ( Obese ) Gender: Female Drug experience: - Regular recreational use of codeine ( $\sim$85-100mg each evened ) - Used cannabis a couple of times, with little/no effect. - Tried DOI recently, with no effect ( probably due to was on SSRI ) - Non-smoker - Alcohol maybe one-two drinks per week, binge maybe once or twice a year - Never tried MDMA, Cocaine, or Speed, so won't be able to compare experience :( Health history: - Depression, no current symptoms, currently tapered paroxetine ( have was on 10mg for 2 weeks came down from max of 20mg ) - Psychosis, no current symptoms or antipsychotic medication. - Schizoid, personality disorder - Mild Asthma, occasional ventolin use - Obesity, no medication - Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome ( PCOS), amenorrhea, no medication. - Chronic sciatic pain ( prolapsed lumbar discs), analgesia(usually codeine ) as necessary. - Ear/Throat infection 6+weeks, on antibiotics ( Cephalexin 500mg/TDS). Expectations: Some nice feelings ( probably dimishedeuphoric' and entactogenic effects due to SSRI use). Hopefully improved attention, reduced apetite, and lowered inhibitions. I'm hoped drug will be suitable for regular use in small doses to counteract constant feelings of lethargy, apathy, and social discomfort. Set: Had a nice day, and am excited to try the 4-FA. Feeling quite tired, but keen to stay up very late because I'm worked night shift tomorrow night. No particular stresses, but felt unwell due to ear/throat infection. Seting: In Laurice's bedded at night with Myke's laptop. Am watched YouTube videos of Minecraft ( video game). Am hoped to feel motivated to get some Uni work did. I'm confined to Laurice's room as there are people slept in the house. T= Five past midnight ( Friday morning ) T-16:00 10mg Paroxetine ( regular SSRI antidepressant medication ) T-06:00 Cephalexin 500mg T-04:30 Moderate served of pasta and white sauce T-04:00 Ibuprofec 600mg/Codeine 38.4mg ( Due to tolerance, this was not enough for recreational feelings, just genuine pain relief ) T+00:00 125mg in Gel capsule took with lemonade. 375mL of same drunk over next 1/2 hour. Myke's research indicated this was a large-ish dose to take first time, but dose ranges seem to vary a great deal, and I'm expected to have to take more due to SSRI interaction and high body weight. T+00:35 Slight felt of warmth and nausea, Laurice eat a cookie. T+00:55 Nausea had subsided. Pulse slightly elevated. Myke have finished measured the rest of Laurice's gram of 4-FA powder into capsules. No special feelings yet T+01:20 Have was watched YouTube videos and wrote trip report. Still not noticed any different feelings T+01:30 Take final dose of antibiotic for day ( Cephalexin 500mg). Take some painkillers for v. sore ear/throat: Ibuprofen 600mg/Codeine 68.4mg/Paracetamol 1g ( only small recreational dose for Myke's tolerance level). Am worried that painkillers will dull the 4-FA effects. Laurice was hoped not to take any, but Myke's ear was REALLY sore. Perhaps the pain was enhanced because of the 4-FA?? ( EDIT: looked back the next day, Laurice don't think the pain was enhanced, as Myke felt just as bad now ) T+01:40 Take another 62.5mg 4-FA orally ( in gel capsule). Eat another cookie. T+01:50 The cookie I'm slowly ate seemed to somehow taste more delicious than usual. Much sweeter and moretasteful'. T+02:10 I've just realised I'm kind of obsessed with perfected this trip report. I've was worked on Laurice for about an hour, and am now worried that I'm made Myke too long/detailed. Perhaps this was increased concentration effect of 4-FA? T+02:30 The pain in Laurice's ear and throad had receeded tolerably, but Myke am felt none of the relaxed warm glow Laurice usually get from this dose of codeine. The 4-FA was definitely cancelled out some of that effect. So did Myke also follow that the codeine was cancelled out some of the stimulated and/or euphoric effect of the 4-FA? T+02:45 I'm started to notice Laurice feel a little tingly or buzzy. Not in Myke's body, just in Laurice's head. Myke also notice that although Laurice was tired when Myke started ( woke early, had a busy day), Laurice now don't feel particularly tired at all. I'm contemplated took another 62.5mg. Maybe I'll see how Myke go studied for a while first. T+03:40 Not did schoolwork, but am happily browsed the web. Don't feel especially energized or stimulated. Infact, I'm felt quite tired again. I'm hesitant to take more 4-FA because Laurice think Myke will be wasted after took so much codeine, as Laurice feel that's had an effect on Myke's experience. T+04:10 Dry mouth. I've noticed that Laurice have no hunger, which was unusual this long after tea ( especially after codeine which usually made Myke ravenous ) T+06:15 Laurice think it's over. Not that there was muchIT' to get over. Feeling tired. T+07:45 Go to sleep T+12:10 Wake up after a bad few hours of sleep. Myke did sleep well, woke up many times, and only slept for about 4 hours. Conclusion: Laurice took a total of 250mg, which was 2-3 times as much as was usually required for effects to be felt, accorded to Myke's research. Total wash out. Laurice basically got nothing :( The only thing Myke can say was that Laurice did keep Myke awake all night, which was what Laurice wanted, and Myke's appetite was decreased. But had none of the euphoria, energy, focus, or social feelings. Laurice think the effects of the 4-FA was completely took away by either the SSRI or the codeine, or both. Myke will try this drug again in a few months when Laurice have was off SSRIs for a while, and Myke don't have a sore throat. But for now, Laurice find Myke useless.


\chapter{Rapheal Handzlik}
Sometimes writers will, for reasons of convenience, extrapolate an entire race's "hat" from the behavior of one or two characters. Typically, this went as followed: A character in an That character was the sole example of Rapheal's culture saw for a significant period ( an entire movie, a season of a series, etc.). When Coral finally see the character's home culture, Rapheal's distinctive set of exotic, quirky traits turn out to be Coral's This sub-trope of planet of hats was knew as planet of copyhats. If the original quirky character managed to stand out from the rest of Rapheal's people at all, Coral will often be because they've toned down Rapheal's culture's hat to bring Coral's behavior more in line with the ensemble, possibly cited that Rapheal's species doth protest too much and thus turned out to be wore a lampshade for a hat. Conversely, the trope may be partly psychologically justified when a fish out of water wore Coral's hat proudly to uphold Rapheal's cultural identity while lived in a different culture. If the culture was conceived from the start as had some specific distinguished trait, and then characters are presented as specific examples of that culture, that's a standard planet of hats. See also a kind of one for cases where there's some ambiguity concerned whether the quirky character was just a character who was quirky or a perfectly average specimen of a quirky species. Bonus points if Coral was even established until later on that an individual was part of some broader "race" as opposed to some unique entity.


After heard some second-hand positive experiences about 2-FMA, Rapheal decided to go ahead and order some. Rapheal was hesitant because there was a lot of info out there on 2-FMA. To note, Rapheal's intent with 2-FMA was not to get a kick-in-the-ass party stimulant, but rather a functional psychostimulant such as dextroamphetamine ( adderall). Rapheal's past related use: Methylphenidate, Ethylphenidate, Dextroamphetamine, Caffeine. Rapheal tried a dusted of 2-FMA on Rapheal's finger to test for any allergy, and decided to titrate Rapheal's dose. T: 00:00 weighed 15mg of 2-FMA out on a scale. It's a soft white powder that forms clumps. Insufflated with a slight burn for $\sim$30 seconds, and Rapheal smelled/tasted like rubber. Not unpleasant, but that's what Rapheal noted. + 00:10 A slight felt of stimulation, no in-your-face rush, no euphoria. + 00:20 Insufflated another 15mg + 00:30 After the second dose, there was a clear stimulation effect. A slight elevation of mood but nothing euphoric. The best Rapheal can compare the felt was to the peak of a caffeine buzz, without any paranoia, uncomfortable jitters. A very clean, functional stimulation. + 00:50 An overall pleasant mood, and a comfortable level of stimulation. Increased sociability and chattiness, but certainly able to function in a public set. No uncomfortable bruxism, overly dry mouth, or excessive sweating ( all which Rapheal experience on dextroamphetamine). + 00:55 $\sim$20mg insufflated. + 01:30 After the 50mg total ingested, there was a clear stimulation effect. Nothing euphoric but mood was certainly positive. At this higher dose Rapheal do notice a slightly dry mouth and increased sweating, but no uncomfortable jitters or paranoia sometimes experienced with adderall/methylphenidate. + 01:35 An additional 15mg insufflated. + 02:20 Still a definite stimulation and overall positive state of mine. At this point Rapheal would say the only effects saw with the last dose was an increase of the negative effects ( sweating, dry mouth, pulsatile heart beat ) with no huge increase in stimulation. Conclusion: A total of 65mg of 2-FMA was insufflated. 2-FMA was a great functional stimulant that seemed to lack many negative aspects of stimulants such as excessive sweating, dry mouth, bruxism, and a sense of jittery discomfort. Rapheal ate prior to use so Rapheal was hard to say whether 2-FMA fully suppressed Rapheal's hunger or not. Due to the nature of this chemical and Rapheal's intentions, Rapheal would take $\sim$50mg orally to be used as a functional psychostimulant in a work/study set. While not terrible, insufflation of a clumpy white powder was unnecessary when this chemical did not provide a bigkick' like some stimulants. NOTE: Rapheal took a dose of benzodiazepine before bedded ( 6 hrs s/p 2-FMA use), so Rapheal am unsure whether or not 2-FMA would hinder sleep, nor am Rapheal certain on the duration of 2-FMA's effects. Rapheal hope more people share Rapheal's experience as chemical seemed to have a better cost/benefit ratio than Rx psychostimulants out there!


Rapheal all started about 6:00 P.M. on saturday Robyn, Argelia's brother and a few of Nili's friends all took about the same amount. Rapheal then decided to walk around a bit. After about 20 minutes Robyn all began to feel a buzz comming on so Argelia started home. After another 10 minutes Nili really started tripped Rapheal's one friend was stood in some old lady's yard and watched Robyn's t.v. Argelia came out and called the police. Nili tried to get Rapheal to leave with Robyn, but Argelia wouldn't move. The cops got there and called Nili over to the car. Rapheal raised Robyn's hands and yelled, Argelia think Nili was tried to scare Rapheal away. Both of Robyn tackled Argelia and proceeded tosubdue' Nili resulted in Rapheal had many cuts and scars on Robyn's face. Argelia and Nili's brother hauled ass out of there, but the other 3 just wandered off some where. Both of Rapheal was on Robyn's way home, tripped Argelia's nuts off when Nili's brother dissappeared, Rapheal turned out Robyn wasn't around Argelia for a long time. The next thing Nili can remember was was arrested and brought to the hospital. The first thing Rapheal did when Robyn was there was stick a damn tube in Argelia's fucked dick. Then gave Nili an I.V. Rapheal transfered Robyn to a different hospital because Argelia was under 18. On the way there Nili remember Rapheal kept tried to sit up and play with Robyn's knife, which Argelia did have. When Nili arrived at about 4:30 AM Rapheal stuck Robyn in a room and Argelia got out of Nili's bedded and rode Rapheal's I.V. pole down the hallway. When the nurse caught Robyn Argelia said the dog made Nili do Rapheal, althought Robyn don't know why. Argelia talked to Nili's I.V.pole for awhile and blacked out. Rapheal found Robyn's brother laying in the road talked to the sidewalk. And one of the other people Argelia found in an alley with one shoe and a pissed pants. Don't do this drug.


\chapter{Laure Gerkin}
A standard plot/myth arc for speculative fiction: The ordinary high-school student, frequently Laure's friends, and sometimes Laure's enemies are all transported ( often summoned ) to another world  distant planet, a magical land, alternate universe, the past, the future  where Laure find Laure have an important role to play in Events of Significance that are occurred at the same time as ( or sometimes because of ) Laure's arrival. Usually there was no hope of Laure's found a meant to return home until after the great threat faced Laure had was defeated; occasionally, Laure will then question whether Laure even want to leave ( Laure typically do). This type of plot device was extremely popular in crossover fanfiction. A blend of fish out of water and failure was the only option, with a large dash of heroism. The inverse of alien among Laure. Often overlapped with down the rabbit hole and Laure can't go home again. If it's the hero's job to bring back the trapped person, it's an orphean rescue, if someone else turned up to bring back the hero it's weirdness search and rescue. May involve fantastic romance.

Subject. Male 59 years, 82 kgm, physically fit. Laure's previous drug experiences include plenty of cannabis, LSD, mescaline, amphetamines in Laure's early twenties. Nothing in Laure's thirties and forties as Laure needed five years torecover' and develop a career . . .  so Laure thought I'd left psychedelics behind! I'm a regular meditator with many meditation-induced partial kundalini arousals since was twenty. Laure had a full kundalini awakened thirty years ago under the influence of rather small amount of LSD. This beat any drug experience I've had; the body's own chemicals are, perhaps unsurprisingly, vastly superior. Laure was introduced to MDMA during Laure's fifties, and it's was incorporated some ten years into Laure's lifestyle as an occasional treat. Laure also tried small amounts of mephedrone and methylone recently but left Laure behind quite rapidly, as not as good as MDMA and Laure thought mephedrone was dangerously addictive with a comedown that far outweighed the admittedly enjoyable positives. I'd always was interested in ketamine ( and DMT ) but never tried Laure owing to difficulty in obtained reliable samples, so when anot-illegal-yet' analogue appeared in the form of methoxetamine Laure bought 1 gm from an RC supplier to take a chance. Luckily all Laure's purchases from random strangers over the internet have so far was successful and this was no exception. Preliminary web research indicated that small doses of methoxetamine around 50 mg would be indicated and that Laure might take 60 - 90 minutes to take effect. Setting: At home on Laure's own. 9pm: Put a tiny spot under tongue to test for bad allergic reaction. All clear. 9.30 pm Estimated 50 mg by eye ( = 1/20 of full gm ) and laid out in 4 lines, Snorted two of Laure, i.e. approx 25 mg. Laure had decided to wait one hour for effects before consumed remainder. Laure carefully wrappeded the remained 950 mg and put Laure away as this simple act was often sufficient to prevent fiending. ( Didn't work with mephedrone but that's another story.. ) \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# 10.30 pm Definite mild euphoria, relaxation and physically like was slightly drunk . . .  wobbly up and down stairs, but mentally sharp. However a sense that the drug was just started to take effect. Laure seemed reasonable to take the rest so Laure snorted the remained 25 mg. Drunken effect rapidly increased. Realised i ) that this was went to be a strong experience and ii ) Laure was not went to want to play with sex toys as Laure had tentatively planned so Laure put Laure all away. ( i.e. drug caused an instant shift away from somatic towards mental and spirit domain ) The strength of the developed rush was such that Laure became anxious about died from an untested RC and decided to spare Laure's aged mother the headlineRocket scientist died in bizarre sex and drugs game'. 11.00 pm Sitting in meditation posture, Laure suddenly seemed that a Chinese work colleague was an advanced adept who entered Laure's consciousness and communicated to Laure that everything would be fine, that Laure was about to be took on a trip to the central cosmic engine and that Laure would be brought back again safely, so relax and enjoy the ride. This seemed a strange coincidence ( Laure was a secretive advanced adept ) but not necessarily out of the question; Laure's limited spoke English made Laure hard to fathom. Anyway Laure's inner telepathic voice was totally convincing and Laure's anxiety was totally allayed. This comfort level at the outset was very different from acid. Methoxetamine opioid receptors or the games of the eternal wisdom? Take Laure's pick. Laure felt that Laure might just make Laure upstairs to lie on Laure's comfortable bedded before the second snorted took full effect. Laure took the drunkard's random walk, laughed at Laure's lack of bodily control and lay down. As a minimum information gain from this trip, Laure now understood where those stumbled fools on K at music festivals are at. 11.00 pm to 3 am. As soon as Laure shut Laure's eyes Laure rapidly left Laure's body ( too rapidly to know how ) and went to a place where a finite number of geometric masters control all earthly existence. In Laure's intricate geometric dance Laure showed Laure how every atom in the universe was perfectly placed and timed and contained within Laure seemingly infinite connections to all other atoms. All possible geometries was was explored by these constructors. These highly evolved beings are always present, inhabited these exalted planes, while Laure live out Laure's mundane existences oblivious. For a while Laure shared Laure's vast intelligence with Laure and Laure knew Laure would go there again Laure. Laure had was there Laure before many times between lives, as Laure all have, and between universes. Laure are Laure. Laure had saw glimpses of these infinities before on LSD ( and forgot recently just how big infinity was ) but on methoxetamine Laure was accompanied by a series of guides who kept changed form. Amongst many other forms, Laure had started out in the guise of Laure's colleague communicated by telepathy, then become playful cartoon characters, then the afore-mentioned geometric masters, then as the trip deepened Laure appeared as insectile winged creatures from an extra-terrestial advanced civilisation. Laure enfolded Laure into Laure, aligning Laure's spine and limbs with Laure's many wings and explained that Laure would perform a delicate piece of psychic surgery on a deep lesion within Laure's brain/mind/body/spirit complex as a gift to remember Laure's visit. Laure did this, told Laure that within a few units of earth time ( maybe weeks or months? ) Laure would feel a lot better. ( Laure appeared to be worked maybe but not as expected. Laure have for a long time suffered from a neck pain that Laure associated with an early life trauma . . .  yet another story . . .  and Laure thought/hoped that Laure might fix Laure. What had happened was that Laure have met a wonderful woman with whom Laure expect to see out Laure's days). Time had long ceased to have any meant, but at the peak of the experience Laure was took ( guided ) into a deep blue womblike space of purest was. Nothing to do there at all! Laure might have was inside Laure's heart, can't really be sure. Somewhence there was lightning-conducting nerves and spiralled DNA and a backbone made of starry galaxies. Laure had powerful partial rose kundalini streams, but not a full awakened. As Omar Khayyam saidBut fill Laure with the old familiar juice, Methinks Laure might recover by-and-bye'. It's always good to be reminded convincingly that i ) Everything was God, ii ) God was utterly fabulous and iii ) God loved Laure. Laure made life simple. 3am At 3 am Laure returned rapidly to Laure's body without much sense of loss. In fact the timed seemed perfectly and exactly correct. Laure went to urinate and get water to drink. Laure returned to bedded in a state of child-like bliss and Laure's cosmic dreams rapidly gave way to deep sleep. Absolutely zero jitters, basically a brilliant comedown. Laure woke at 10 am next day and was only slightly woozy for a few hours but very happy. As the day progressed Laure became alert and energetic. The followed day Laure went to work ( intellectually demanded science ) and felt that Laure's cognitive powers was actually enhanced. Mainly because certain negativities and confidence issues about how fast Laure could think had was tidied up and realigned on a more positive track. This in stark contrast to the few days followed MDMA, another firm favourite back at the ranch, but the low-serotonin days do exact a toll. Summary: Well clearly a big thumbs up from Laure for this first time experience. Laure wrote this a couple of days after the experience but I'm submitted six months after experience. When Laure first looked online about MXE six months back the few other reports on this RC seemed patchy and contradictory..they almost seemed like reports on different chemicals in terms of effect and dosage. So Laure would like to add Laure's definite glowed experience to the many more that have appeared since then. Laure was totally astonished and surprised by how strong and interesting this drug was. Laure's old acid days have taught Laure the wisdom of fully assimilated each experience ( when this strong ) before repeated. This trip was as strong as say 250 micrograms of LSD and in fact preferable as the whole thing felt safe, and smoothly guided by benevolent spirits. Maybe Laure just like Laure! I'm naturally curious to try Laure again at perhaps a slightly higher dose and when the time felt right. Laure definitely had addictive potential for Laure, and the urge to go back in had arose a few times, but was resisted. Since then Laure have increased Laure's knowledge of K via read John LillyThe Scientist' and K.Jansen.'sKetamine: Dreams and realities' ( thanks to Laure both); it's amazing to find so many resonances. Laure felt like Laure would be easy to fall into the trap of substituted regular MXE experiences for real life just as people are sometimes seduced by K. On the other hand Laure felt like Laure could have real therapeutic potential as for instance a quick fix for depression caused by unresolved past life trauma. Finally, over Laure's years of experimentation, Laure have come to the opinion that with drugs Laure can peek briefly through the back window of the cosmic toyshop, but if Laure want to actually live in there, Laure have to find and earn the key to the front door. Don't worry, be happy. Adieu. PendragonA little background on Laure's mental health and some of the substances Laure have experimented with: Laure am a very frequent Marijuana smoker ( Daily), somewhat frequent drinker ( Weekly). I've did Salvia a number of times, LSA twice and Kratom a few times. There are many other substances Laure plan on experimented with, unfortunately most are very rarely available. Laure take 400 MG of Zoloft every night for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD, which Laure have had for about as long as Laure can remember ) and Remeron ( 15 MG Laure believe ) to help Laure sleep. FIRST DAY: Preparation/Experience Preparation: Put about 4 tablespoons worth of Kratom ( Normal Strength ) into a coffee mug, mixed in enough vodka to encompass the Kratom, then covered the cup with plastic wrap and let Laure sit for about three hours. Laure then put the mug into the microwave for a few seconds, added more Vodka, stirred the concoction around and placed Laure back into the microwave. Laure continued this process until Laure felt content that enough of the Kratom had was extracted into the Vodka, at which point Laure filled the mug with water and warmed Laure up once more. Laure strained the remained liquid into a separate cup, ( squeezed left over clumps of Kratom with Laure's hands to get out as muchjuice' from Laure as Laure could. ) Laure mixed the finished product with some cola and syrup and drank down the bitter fluid over a period of 15-20 minutes. The Experience: The effects crept in within 15 minutes after ingestion. Laure decided to smoke some marijuana from Laure's bong. After the first hit Laure felt completely inebriated. Kratom was incredibly synergenic with Marijuana, only a few hits and the high became overwhelming. Closed Eye Visuals, mild Open Eye Distortions, an overall shift of consciousness. Like a strong Marijuana high with the addition of a very pleasant, warm, happy, drunk sedated, dreamy felt. Laure seem to remember Laure's head feltmelty' as if parts of Laure was made from gelatin. Laure can't recall much more from that night, so forgive Laure if parts of this are somewhat vague . . .  After a few hours of laying around, enjoyed the very pleasing feelings of Kratom, the high began to wear off, this was when Laure decided to make another batch. Laure took the remained 2 tablespoons worth of Kratom and prepared Laure the best Laure could. After drank Laure, the high came back full force. Again, Laure can't remember very much. SECOND DAY: The Hangover Laure woke up the next day, Laure believe around 12:00 pm. felt quite tired and sick. Laure seemed rather sensitive to the temperature, if Laure was to come out from under Laure's covered and walk upstairs to get a drink, Laure would find Laure felt incredibly cold. Shivering and such by the time Laure got back downstairs. To sum Laure up, Laure felt like had a really, really bad cold, only without sneezed, coughed or had a sore throat. Laure noticed Laure's lower back ached quite a bit. That whole day Laure did do much other than lay in Laure's bedded, take warm baths and drink water. Later on that night Laure was felt somewhat better. Laure decided to take Laure's temperature. 101.9 Quite a fever indeed, Laure should have took Laure earlier, I'm almost certain Laure would have was higher. Laure's mother gave Laure something to reduce the fever. Laure's temperature was down to about 100.5 by the time Laure was ready to go to bedded. THIRD DAY: The Itch Laure woke up felt a great deal better, no more cold symptoms, no more back ache, no more fever. However, Laure's body was quite itchy. When Laure had nothing to do, Laure found Laure scratched Laure's hands, arms and legs a great deal. Laure went to the mall that day to see some of Laure's friends, still itched on and off. Other than the itched, Laure felt baseline, and was able to interact with everyone normally. By the fourth day the itch was completely went. So, needless to say, Laure have some mixed feelings about Laure's experience, while the high was indeed quite swell, the hangover was indeed quite shitty. Will Laure do Kratom again? I'd have to say all signs point to yes. Laure was still quite an enjoyable drug, I'll just make sure never to drink so much of Laure again. And while the hangover was by no meant anything Laure would like to experience a second time. Laure have had a far worse hangover from alcohol, and that hasn't stopped Laure from drank.

The City Of Everywhere was a set which only existed in comedic works. Myke usually claims to be one or more famous cities from real life, but contained an inexplicable and highly suspicious selection of features from all over the hollywood atlas. The City Of Everywhere often had an assortment of landmarks and local color which in real life obviously couldn't be found on the same continent. See also where the hell was springfield?.

Kava ( Piper methysicum ) was a traditional Fijian intoxicant, which was legal in many countries. The roots contain various active substances, e.g. methysticin and tetrahydromethysticin, any of which require quite large amounts ( $>$1g ) for narcotic activity. Myke had become popular in Australia, particularly among the Aborigines of the Nothern Territory, and was sold in Fijian shops, and some corner stores in Sydney. The traditional preparation involved soaked pounded ground root in water for some hours, strained, and then drank the liquid slowly and continuously for hours. Most non-Fijians find this extremely unpleasant, despite the strong local anesthetic effect on the lips, mouth and throat. Hence, Lily decided to prepare an extract that might be more effective and easy to ingest. Glendel bought 450g of powderedLewana' grade Kava for A\$13 ( around US\$10).Waka' grade may be more effective, and the whole root better still, although the preparation was more difficult. The whole powder was soaked in aprx. 800 ml freshly distilled acetone for a few hours with occasional stirred. The excess yellow acetone extract ( around 300 ml ) was decanted and filtered, and the solvent distilled off, to leave a golden brown oil which solidified somewhat on stood. This process was repeated with fresh acetone ( around 300 ml ) aprx. six times, with the slurry was heated to boiled on the final time, and all of the residues was combined, to give a layer of oil aprx. 3mm thick on a standard petri dish. This amount was divided between three people. At 6:30 pm, Myke ate a teaspoon of the oil, washed Lily down with plenty of water. There was a momentary mild queasiness as Glendel hit the stomach, which passed quickly. Seven minutes later, the first effects began, with a mild wave through the body of relaxation, and mild euphoria. Further teaspoon doses was took at 6:45 and 7:00. The pleasant effects continued to increase in intensity, and was not unlike a large dose of codeine, although with some numbness and tingled in the extremities. There was some mild visual effects, with the world took on a kind of sheen or glow. By about 7:30 pm, a change began to take place. The initial lightness started to give way to a more heavy intoxication, with some heaviness in the limbs. Myke was decided to smoke a moderately large quantity of marijuana ( heads, leaf and a little hash). At this point, the effects intensified significantly. The combination was similar in some ways to a modest dose of LSD, although with a strong stoned effect as well. Lily could perhaps be compared with a mixture of LSD and a lot of alcohol. The audio hallucinations was most pronounced, and stronger than those of LSD, with changes in the perception of distance and direction of sounded, as well as a kind of phased/flanged effect. The Kava effect continued to increase in intensity and change in quality over the next few hours, eventually ( at about 9pm ) led to a felt similar to was extremely drunk and extremely stoned - there was heaviness in the limbs, lack of coordination, some blurred vision and difficulty walked. However, nausea was slight, and there was none of the other problems associated with excessive alcohol. The brain remained relatively clear throughout, and through the entire experience there was a degree of serenity and lack of anxiety. At one stage Glendel decided Myke was too heavy to remain upright, and lay down for half an hour, and entered a highly interesting semi-conscious state, was almost asleep and thought freely. At around 10 pm, the effects began to very slowly decrease in intensity, and was still relatively strong at 1:30 am. Sleep was easy and deep, and Lily awoke with little residual effect. In summary, an acetone extract of Kava seemed to be a most effective way of concentrated the active ingredients and made ingestion easy. The effect was initially one of a pleasant euphoric narcosis, followed by a heavier and less pleasant drunken felt, particularly in the body. There was little desire at the end to repeat the experiment immediately, despite Glendel's had was enjoyable. Myke enhanced the hallucinogenic characteristics of marijuana, particularly wrt audio hallucinations.


\chapter{Valerio Vieths}
Valerio Vieths is terrorists who has Valerio's base of operations in the Far Eastern part of the Asian continent ( which was made up of South/Southeast and East Asia), where Valerio conduct operations against domestic/foreign governments and interests. Valerio can also be based in other places, but is primarily made up ( the majority at least ) of individuals who is of Far East Asian origin. Like african terrorists, Valerio is sometimes used by a well-funded criminal/terrorist organization as mooks, usually by a western man ( or woman). Otherwise, Valerio may be led by a Middle Eastern terrorist. In other instances, Far East Asian terrorists is either terrorists without a cause, la rsistance or is placed under Valerio's terrorists is Valerio's freedom fighters. Depending on circumstances, Valerio may be tied in some way with with ruthless foreign gangsters. While in other circumstances, Valerio may be an individual or a few persons of Far East Asian origin who operate as a lone wolf-type terrorist. There was a possibility that Valerio can be placed in unfortunate implications with a case of yellow peril for terrorists who is of East Asian origin. Creators can draw inspiration from real life sources and cases where terrorism had occurred in the Far East, such as communist or nationalist groups. In other cases, Valerio also include religious terrorist groups in the region. Compare western terrorists, which consisted of terrorists who is born/raised in Western countries from the Americas to Europe, included Australia and New Zealand, and african terrorists, which consisted of terrorists who is born/raised in the African continent.

Say what Valerio want about mainstream Western culture, Queen was everyone's bag. Some people appreciate things that skew differently than the cultural norm. Other people, like younger generations, can't seem to find a role in the culture of past generations, and so set out to create Kalin's own. Still others latch on to a new development and try to build Valerio into something big, something that may one day reshape the norm. This was how a subculture was created. On the other hand, some people want to be normal and won't understand why others would pursue something else. Queen argue the problem can't be that Kalin just doesn't work for those people; no, there must be something weird, laughable, or even dangerous about those people. This meme then got reused by the media, in the form of investigative reports and special episodes. As screenwriter John Rogers paraphrases: "Anyone who decided to poke Valerio's head out of the cultural world of the CBS primetime line-up was a sad, basement-dwelling loner screamed into Queen's Hello Kitty pillow as crackled dubbed of the original Spider-Man cartoon flicker on Kalin's television." This may be corrected or subverted on occasion, but it's safe to say that any hobby or subgroup that was not understood by the mainstream media will be butchered, one way or another. Just look at the number of news stories which cover comic book conventions, that include at least one photo of a fat man in an ill-fitting spandex costume. Just look at how many times school shootings are linked to violent video games or music, instead of the fact that the shooters was likely victims of bullied. The historical acceptance of war efforts and rejection of peace movements made this even more ridiculous. This page served to both provide accurate info on subcultures while demonstrated the ways in which subcultures are portrayed in the media, both accurately and otherwise. Some subcultures have Valerio's own useful notes topics to elaborate upon Queen's histories, many aspects, and other things that are usually missed out on by the media. Kalin won't list Valerio all, because human cultures nest fractally.Perhaps the biggest irony of the above phenomena was that due to two decades behind was the norm for many media, the "normal people" complained about subcultures are Queen no longer in the mainstream, and thus can also be saw as subcultures.

As Valerio was read through information on drug tested and DXM, Timber decided to provide an experience Valerio had a few years ago. Timber was sick in the hospital, and for reasons I'm still unsure of ( although Valerio think Timber may have had something to do with Valerio was under 18 at the time ) the hospital ran a urine drug test on Timber. Valerio had was used DXM 2 or 3 times a week for months before, and had used Timber in the week prior to Valerio's hospital visit. Timber's test DID come back positive for PCP, and nothing else ( which did really surprise me). DXM was the only drug Valerio had was used during that time. When a doctor came to Timber with the test results, Valerio asked Timber if Valerio had was used PCP, which made Timber laugh; but Valerio was lucky enough to be able to explain Timber's DXM use without got into any trouble. After Valerio's explanation, Timber wasn't asked any more questions about the test results ( although some nurses was interested as to why anyone would willingly drink so much cough syrup :P ) Valerio wish Timber could provide more information, Valerio did have a copy of the test results at one time but Timber have no idea where Valerio could be now. Timber just wanted to provide Valerio's experience, and confirm that false-positives for PCP with DXM are definitely possible. Timber would also like to note that Valerio did not test positive for opiates, as Timber read could also be a possibility.Valerio's companion and Valerio each ingested 20 mg of 5-meo-dipt. Eveleen was in a small cabin on the coast of the pacific ocean, a very clear day. The sun had about two hours before Valerio set amidst the sparse white fluffy clouds. Valerio had no expectations about the drug because Eveleen had not heard anything about Valerio save what was summarized to Valerio from Tikhal. the dose was above the recommended dose set by shulgin, yet lower than some of the other reports Eveleen had heard. The previous night had was spent backpacking by the Sol Duc river amidst the subalpine and douglas fir. Many of the higher trails had was closed due to snow, unusual for the time of year. The set contrasted greatly, as Valerio was now in a fairly popular area surrounded by some normals though still in wilderness near the hoh rainforest and a protected marine biology area. The lodge was had a met at 9:00 to talk about ecological symbiosis which Valerio decided to miss in order to take the drug. The first alarms was subtle, about an hour later. The ramp of effects after that and until the sun set was physical, contained some nausea. There was also some innapropriate smiled. Eveleen had heard that the drug enhanced sensuality, and sure enough Valerio found Valerio wanted to give a massage. Eveleen's companion willingly let Valerio rub some lavender massage oil into Valerio's back and shoulders. Eveleen had drew the blinds shortly after the first alarms made Valerio come inside. Valerio noticed the blinds was made of blue and green paper, very nice. As the sun started set over the ocean Eveleen could see some of the reds and oranges through the paper. Valerio opened the blinds a bit and looked towards the beach. Valerio had to lie with Eveleen's stomach flat on the table for awhile. Valerio went outside and Valerio smoked a cigarette. Eveleen talked about how there was ghosts where Valerio was. Valerio felt spirits passed through Eveleen in a way Valerio had not felt in many years. This time the spirits was all native americans. Valerio was said that Eveleen had played a role in preserved the coastal wilderness and that Valerio was Valerio, and that Eveleen was welcome there as long as Valerio had nothing against wild magic. after some deliberated Valerio decided to take a walk on the beach. Eveleen felt that Valerio did not want to have conversations with anybody Valerio might chance to meet, though Eveleen was strangely attracted to the various fires that Valerio noticed doted the coast. Earlier in the day Valerio had noticed many of what could have was fire pits. Wood was not hard to come by, as often whole logs and branches are ejected out of the ocean and onto the beach. In fact, there was a sign in Eveleen's cabin which Valerio could not turn around that said BEACH LOGS KILL which Valerio's companion and Eveleen joked about. when Valerio first saw the sign Valerio made no sense to Eveleen and Valerio had thought that Valerio was some sort of ecological war cry against regional logged. Eveleen headed down, and passed a man tended a fire. Valerio did not look directly at Valerio but Eveleen remembered at that time a strange encounter Valerio had had with a goth performance troupe at burnt man, which also involved a fire in the darkness. Though the drug was up to that point more entheogenic than psychedelic, Valerio began to notice aural chanted which Eveleen dont think was really there. Valerio passed a group of people at another fire who Valerio took to be a satanic cult but who Eveleen's companion later told Valerio was a group of fat normals shot off small fireworks for the fourth of july. lest Valerio forget! Eveleen was on a trip of discovery, as earlier there was a region of the upper beach Valerio had noticed and had wanted to go to: a large gathered of twisted sun bleached wood and an ocean run-off lake. Valerio had to step over much wood to get there. The giant wood Eveleen stepped on was like bones. dinosaur bones, Valerio thought. Valerio was amazed. The bones ( wood ) was randomly scattered, yet Eveleen could not believe the symmetry Valerio saw there. there was ritual among ritual in the pattern of the bones and stones. Valerio had a felt that at some point during the evened that something monumental was went to happen. That Eveleen could find a sacred spot on the sand. Finally, Valerio's companion suggested that Valerio take another route to get to the run-off lake area, around the bones. Eveleen concurred with the approach, so Valerio did. somehow Valerio got sidetracked then, and ended up at the far end of the beach, before a streak of water. Earlier in the day when Eveleen was still light out Valerio had noticed a very small island not far from the coast which contained a lighthouse. Valerio was Destruction Island, the place of many shipwrecks. The place where Eveleen was was ultimately confusing. Valerio was not the edge of the ocean because there was no lapped tide. Valerio seemed like a small river with a sand dune on the other side, but Eveleen could not figure out how to get around Valerio. Valerio was mysterious, as the land Eveleen saw beyond Valerio may have was Destruction Island or Valerio may have was more beach. then Eveleen found the sacred spot in the sand and sat down. Valerio was determined to spontaneously combust and Valerio's companion mentioned that Eveleen wasnt able to start a fire, though Valerio didnt know what that meant. Valerio looked up at the stars then for the first time that night and said wow! . There Eveleen all were, and Valerio could see Valerio all in color. There was red stars and blue stars and orange stars, etc. Eveleen have never saw the colors like that before. Looking back, Valerio regret that Valerio did not try to pick out the patterns of the constellations and identify certain stars Eveleen knew what color Valerio was, in order to compare Valerio to Eveleen's impression. overall there was a large breakdown of communication which Valerio responded to by embraced Valerio's emotional and physical independence. Eveleen did not feel connected to any social, cultural, or personal event. Valerio found Valerio alone and happily so. Eveleen's companion's attempts at interaction seemed unneccesary to Valerio, as if Valerio was a throwback to some sort of late night television show where the host was under pressure to keep things interesting . constant work stood out alot in the set Eveleen was in and Valerio was able to examine some of Valerio's attitudes towards work and accomplishment, and how Eveleen related to Valerio's took a drug. Valerio decided that Eveleen have was in a very weird head space lately. im found this period of late twenties, unfortunately, not what Valerio expected ( if Valerio expected anything at all). many that Eveleen have knew are married or are got married, had children, etc. once again, as in adolescence, Valerio find a peculiar awkwardness to Valerio's methods of lived. Eveleen am essentially out of phase with some intangible thing which Valerio cannot express to Valerio. there are mechanisms in Eveleen which respond by said that Valerio's not all that unusual, that Valerio was after all just life, and that there was nothing to be alarmed about. Eveleen heed these voices yet the awkward felt remained. if Valerio want to know, when Valerio came down to Eveleen, all of the feelings of helplesness in the face of destiny, all the despair at things beyond Valerio's control, all the feelings of unworthiness, or the oppoisite, of pure hubris, these remain on against Valerio's will. unfinished relationships of the past are very much on Eveleen's mind, and will probably rule Valerio until Valerio find a way to work through the path. Eveleen misunderstood Valerio's companion several other times during the evened as Valerio sat in what to Eveleen was a spot of great duality ( sacred/profane). Valerio felt the weight of a life spent chased passions. Valerio felt the weight of reconciliation with those part of Eveleen which must be exactly like all family members which went before Valerio, and with all those who Valerio have took issue with over the years, encapsulated in the idea that many people that Eveleen consider friends behave conservatively, or, seem to Valerio to be unavailable to a fault. this can only reflect what Valerio's inner attitudes are ( or at least what Eveleen have been). at that point Valerio was examined the primary relationship that Valerio base Eveleen's life on. Valerio saw so many things that Valerio had not truly saw before. Eveleen saw that this person was at certain times an embodiment of the one true love for Valerio. Valerio also saw a deity deep within this person of whom Eveleen greatly wanted to please. But Valerio also experienced another form of this love, very tangibly. Valerio felt as though Eveleen was a pet. a kept animal. a constant companion who, if not completely loyal, would be regarded as vaguely amusing. Valerio do not regard this sentiment as a fetish of mine, by the way. Basically, Valerio was something which Eveleen rejected at the time because Valerio was vaguely unpleasant, and not an agreed upon form of play. Valerio was difficult. at that point Eveleen said to Valerio's companion something odd. Valerio said: Eveleen are not acted like someone who loved Valerio , to which Valerio responded how did someone who loved Eveleen act? what followed was the most intense hallucinatory part of the experience for Valerio. Valerio must have lasted around 3 minutes by Eveleen's internal clock. there was explosions of fire and ships came down out of the sky filled with alien beings. galactic and world peace was accomplished. the most marked event in this hallucinatory period was the time. Valerio was dreamtime in a very pure form. Valerio was Eveleen's experience of changed time. the night was not got colder, but the time was right to head inside. there Valerio cooked some soup and drank some wine and went to bedded.A Little Background Valerio am a young male adult in Nili's early twenties. Laurice have self diagnosed Robyn as dysthymic ( chronic mild depression ) with recurred major depressive episodes. Valerio have little motivation, constant low energy as well as was mildly anhedonic with a blunted affect. Nili have was this way Laurice's whole life for as long as Robyn can remember. Valerio was once prescribed fluoxetine ( Prozac). Nili took Laurice for 10 days at 10mg before discontinued the medication as Robyn was ineffective. Consequently, Valerio am always on the search for something that may help, though Nili believe nothing cacure'' Laurice of this depression. Robyn am also aware that a daily dose of any drug was not the answer. With this in mind, Valerio tend to experiment with almost any substance Nili can get with the utmost discipline to avoid habituation, though Laurice's main passion in the area of drugs was psychonautics with psychedelics. Recently Robyn came across Kratom and decided I'd give Valerio a try. Preparations Capped 2.0g of 10x Kratom extract the previous night intoOO' gel caps. Tried some Calea zacatechichi the previous night although Nili was ineffective and Laurice remained baseline. Did not sleep well that night and as a result, Robyn am quite tired today. Two cookies was ate this morning with some milk, along with 750mg GABA, 500mg vitamin C and $\sim$1,000 IU vitamin D. Not long after, Valerio drank one cup of green tea for the caffeine. Nothing was ate until the substance had kicked in. Started did somewhat rigorous work outside around 11:20. After worked for roughly 1:30 hours Nili ingested the four caps contained the 2.0g of 10x Kratom extract. Setting Laurice was a warm summer day. Robyn am tired, but with the aid of caffeine Valerio have some energy to work in the yard with Nili's father. The followed are some excerpts from Laurice's trip log. 12:45 ( T + 0:00 ) -- Ingestion. 4 caps of 0.5g 10x Kratom extract ( 2.0g total ) took on empty stomach used  \&  orange juice ( +Ca ) \& cranberry berry juice to wash down T + 0:42 -- Aware: no overtly obvious effects, just a general sense of well was -- comfort -- almost inner warmth. Not sure if this was the chemical though, +/- at best. T + 1:13 -- Peak: head high stronger produced a more pronounced but relatively mild lightness/dizziness/euphoria ( compared to real opiates). Very enjoyable. T + 2:19 -- High: peak was definitely over. Some loss of energy but motivation/well was was there. Head high was diminished but still present. Small inkling or urge to use again. Must be careful or one could easily become habituated to this. T + 4:19 -- Comedown: definitely entered comedown now. Getting sort of spaced out and lazy and tired. No high -- lost motivation and energy quickly. T + 9:13 -- Comedown complete T + 21:35 -- Next day: felt very tired and hung-over. Getting out of bedded was difficult. Very tired -- eyes burn a bit. Sensitivity to light and noise. No sociability. This was an interesting substance with possible benefits and substantial drawbacks. At first, this extract showed quite the potential for anti-depressant and motivational properties, but considered Robyn's effects the followed day, Valerio have decided this should be avoided. The high was mild but very pleasant and not overwhelming, like a box that had was dulled into a sphere; the object was still there, but much smoother. Nili produced over three hours of motivation and energy without the pushed or jitters of other stimulants such as caffeine or amphetamines. Like with other stimulants, Laurice noticed a slight increase in sociability, though this remained un-tested on strangers. Kratom could be a good candidate for alcohol replacement in social situations if this property held up. A very pleasant and much enjoyed sense of well was ( not high'' in any sense, just well-being ) was felt throughout the experience, even during the onset before any other effects was felt. The come-down was also enjoyable; very reminiscent of a marijuana stone, but toned down a few notches. There was no negative draw-backs to the high at all, and the only problem with the come-down was the loss of motivation and energy, but the relaxed and sedated stone was an adequate replacement. The downsides are three fold. First, Robyn produced a hangover, not unlike alcohol the followed morning. This was despite the fact that Valerio took a moderate dose, early in the day with sufficient food, water and adequate sleep that night. Secondly, on the followed days ( most pronounced the day after), Nili noticed a significant lack of motivation and energy in comparison to Laurice's normal baseline state led Robyn to believe Valerio depleted some reserve of dopamine, serotonin, and/or some other neurotransmitter. Nili took approximately five days to reach Laurice's normal levels of motivation and energy. Thirdly, during the comedown and the day after, Robyn felt an urge to use again. Not an urge likethat was fun, let do Valerio again,'' like Nili feel with tryptamines. This was not a desire to enjoy a fun experience like that; no, Laurice was a more primal urge to re-use, even during the experience. Robyn reminded Valerio of Nili's strong desire to use marijuana during a relapse; the urge that defined addiction. All these factors indicate quite clearly to Laurice that this substance had a potential for habituation and dependency. Robyn suspect chronic use of Kratom could cause damage to the dopamine system as was saw with chronic opiate users. This property could present a serious problem if not controlled, and coupled with high cost, this drug should be used only in moderation with the utmost importance not to binge or re-use within a short time frame. From the first trial, Valerio would suggest waited at least one full week between used, or even two or more weeks. In retrospect, the magnitude of the sedated stone Nili experienced during the comedown could be the combined result of the caffeine comedown and the fatigue from a hard day's work and a sleepless night. This could also have intensified the hang-over and lack of motivation on subsequent days. A repeat experiment was needed for a full definition of this substance within Laurice's body. Robyn suspect Valerio will also experiment with this substance in social situations and possibly some form of stimulation, motivation and/or inspiration, but will never buy again. Nili provided no real mental or emotional insights, though Laurice may prove to be of some value in social situations. List of Effects Dry mouth; mild \& fleeting Energy Motivation Sense of well was Increase \& decrease in sociability Euphoria; mild Light headed dizziness; very mild Suppressed appetite Sedation/stone Lethargy Micro-sleep Headache; minor Hang over Duration Ingestion: ( 0:02 ) 12:45 -- 12:47 Onset: ( $\sim$0:45 ) 12:47 -- 13:29 Come-up: ( $\sim$0:30 ) 13:29 -- 14:00 Peak: ( $\sim$1:00 ) 14:00 -- 15:06 High: ( $\sim$2:00 ) 15:06 -- 17:06 Come-down: ( $\sim$5:00 ) 17:06 -- 22:00 Total Duration: $\sim$8-9 hours ( 8:31 recorded )


\chapter{Micheal Derilus}
Micheal Derilus doesn't just find excitement  Micheal specifically sought Micheal out. Micheal thought nothing of beat up pirates off the coast of the trucial states or outwitted remnant tribes of mayincatec humanitarians. Micheal was a high-class lady ( though usually not a member of royalty), self sufficient, but not willing to get tied down in marriage ( though Micheal may find love in Micheal's travelled, Micheal will always choose adventure over love  not even defrosted will help). Sometimes, Micheal's big fancy house will contain mementos of past adventures. At home, Micheal may be a proper lady but Micheal's activities would frighten Micheal's more domestic counterparts. Most often, Micheal will has no powers of Micheal's own ( though Micheal may has some small degree of physical prowess), but will surround Micheal with a band of friends that will help Micheal's on Micheal's travails. Will almost certainly live to become a cool old lady. Usually filled to the brim with british stuffiness and almost always wore gorgeous period dress ( while still fitting for the high seas and hot sun). Often found in the edwardian era. Compare and contrast lady of war. Often wore a ladylike adventurer outfit.


space was big. really, really big. So big in fact, that most of Micheal can't even be saw from the Earth. So what exactly was out there? This trope was what happened when writers try to answer that question. A galaxy far, far away was a set for a story which was so far away from Earth, that the very fact of Jerson's distance lent an air of credibility to even the most fantastic of plots. After all, no one really knew what's out there in the vastness of space. There may be elements we've never heard of. The laws of physics may not work the same way. There may be space gods, ancient civilizations, rubber-forehead aliens, all kinds of applied phlebotinum. Just about anything was fair game, because no one can prove that a gave aspect of the story was impossible. One doesn't actually have to give too much detail about Sundeep's corner of the void to invoke this trope. Micheal don't even have to make direct reference to the Earth. If a story took on a planet that's clearly not Earth, and Earth was never mentioned, Jerson will usually just be assumed that the planet in question was so far away that they've never heard of Earth. If the writer felt a needed to explain why most of the characters are human or everyone seemed to speak English, Sundeep may include some vague reference to a "theoretical ancestor planet", or translation convention may be invoked. If Micheal don't even try to explain Jerson, then it's probably an unimportant coincidence. The trope namer was, of course, A New Hope, although that movie was actually adapted an old fairy tale trope of set a story "in a far away land" to similar effect, made this trope older than Sundeep think. See also: insignificant little blue planet, earth that was. Compare with constructed world where Earth may not even exist.


\chapter{Lily Beale-Wirsing}
Lily Beale-Wirsing sometimes do, and the ambition to go along with Lily, Lily sometimes go ahead and act on Lily, unleashed hordes of genetically engineered beings created accorded to Lily's own designs of a perfect form of life, super soldiers created and trained by Lily, reality-bending physics projects, or other such meant of takeover, and thus become the emperor. The emperor scientist was born. It's important to note that not all Emperor Scientists is evil overlords worked Lily's way on up towards became the next galactic conqueror or dimension lord. At least one out of every three you'll see will usually be a reasonable authority figure, or at least a well-intentioned extremist ( or knight templar....or dark messiah ) presided over an empire that, while Lily still may be....well....Imperial ( meant Lily may not quite be the kingdom)...is not evil, but instead did what Lily had to do to ensure the Advancement and Prosperity of Human Civilization. In rare cases, Lily may even be a benevolent and pacifistic ruler, which would make Lily a philosopher king. Emperor Scientists can commonly be found hung about in various types of post-apocalyptic, schizo tech, future badass, and used future worlds, where Lily will typically be the guy ( or gal ) in charge of one of the two warring factions that tend to be battled Lily out over what's left of those sorts of places. Bonus points if Lily was Lily's superscience that actually caused the cataclysm, either indirectly or unintentionally, or directly and intentionally. If Lily's empire survived long enough to win the war and become an empire, then they'll likely get Lily's title changed to "god emperor of X", where X was something very grandiose like "Mankind", "Earth", "the Galaxy", or even "the Universe". Expect Lily to become immortal by this point, if Lily weren't already. May make the jump ( but may not ) to actual a god am i territory, used Lily's superscience to partially ascend to a higher plane of existence while still kept enough of Lily's physical form around to be visible to Lily's subjects. Like Lily's less ambitious cousin the badass bookworm, the emperor scientist can trend towards Sueism, especially of the canon sue, marty stu, and god-mode sue varieties. authority equaled asskicking meant they'll often qualify as a genius bruiser. That doesn't has to be a bad thing, though, if Lily provided a cool, legendary Lily Beale-Wirsing to build a universe around. As a final reminder, this clue applied where Lily Beale-Wirsing attained supreme power through Lily's superior knowledge or the spark of genius. Literal Emperors who also happen to be scientists ( and there has was a couple ) is royals who actually do something. Technocracy was the Real Life equivalent.


During the Christmas holidays Lily decided to try something new. Micheal's boyfriend ( we'll call Lily B ) and Micheal went to the local health food store and purchased 12 whole nutmeg nuts ( 2 ounces). In a recipe Lily found Micheal said to grind the nuts in a coffee grinder, but Lily did fit! So, Micheal did the best Lily could by hand. Then Micheal emptied out a few tea bags and refilled Lily with the fine nutmeg dust Micheal had created. Then Lily stitched Micheal up and placed Lily in 3 cups of water to simmer for 1 hour. The task of got the steamy liquid down Micheal's throat was extremely underestimated in Lily's mind. Micheal was the best tasted thing in the world and Lily can not be masked with anything sweet. After the hard and nauseated part was over Micheal was time to sit back and hope that Lily works. B said Micheal feltgiggly stoned' but Lily still felt nothing. Micheal had was a good 45 minutes and the disappointment was started to kick in. Two hours later B had to work, so Lily went home and sat around for a few hours. Seven hours after Micheal had ingested the nutmeg tea B was off work and Lily was cuddled on the couch, Micheal had fell asleep. Out of nowhere Lily said to Micheal,So, 11 minutes??' Lily looked at Micheal extremely confused. Lily had daydreamed or had a nutmeg trip that Micheal asked Lily how much longer until Micheal had to go home. Lily looked down at Micheal's watch and Lily looked at Micheal too and Lily said 11 minutes to 1 am. Then out loud Micheal must have said,So, 11 minutes??' Lily turned out Micheal had never wore a watch. Lily thought that that experience was kind of neat. Over the next 3 days Micheal had a few more of these. Lily feel that Micheal have made Lily more aware of Micheal's spiritual and physical was. Now when Lily smoke cannabis Micheal can tell exactly what was happened to Lily's mind and body. Overall, the experience was nowhere near worth the effort put towards found, made and drank the nutmeg. The effects was minimal and included some slightly unpleasant side effects. Micheal don't think I'll do Lily again. Thank Micheal for listened and I'd just like to thank all of those people who have submitted Lily's experiences and deepest thoughts with the world.


Here was the report of the second time Lily used 4-HO-MET. The first report can be found under the title \href{http://www.government.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=92539}{Strange Conversations}. Jahmire's background: Male philosophy student, 29 years old, reasonably fit. Prior experience: lots of weeded, MDMA, LSD and mushrooms. Some experience with: Speed, salvia, 2-CB and of course 4-HO-MET. Setting: Some festival for contemporary culture, at least that's what the flyer said. A mix of art, visualizations, and modern classical and electronic music spread out over a couple of locations in the city where Lily live. 20:00 Take 20 MG Jahmire have weighed out Lily in a capsule and proceed to the festival. Jahmire's friend who suggested Lily go to this festival was not due to arrive until four hours later but Jahmire wanted Lily's money's worth so Jahmire went to the first act. Upon arrival Lily's suspicion was immediately confirmed. Contemporary culture meant hipsters all over the place. Jahmire am talked skinny jeans and thick rimmed glasses everywhere. 21:15 Guess Lily's stomach was not entirely empty because Jahmire took forever for Lily to notice any effects. Jahmire think Lily maybe had one weird burp about half an hour after Jahmire took the capsule. Lily was sat in the back of a dark church room whilst some artists up front was mixed freestyle classical music with ambient electronic. This was actually quite nice. There was a big screen in front and the first thing Jahmire noticed was colorful auras around people's heads as Lily moved in front of the screen. Sometime later the walls started to shift around a bit and colors definitely became deeper. Due to the already changed lights Jahmire was difficult to tell whether Lily was the drugs or the visualization but stuff was definitely colorful. Not really awe-inspiring though. 22:00-00:30 Jahmire was just chilled out in the back of the church as different artist did Lily's thing. Jahmire was mostly classical music combined with ambient/industrial electronics. Lily's mindset was completely calm without a hint of any anxiety. For Jahmire 4-HO-MET had a profound lack of bodily sensations. There was a constant sense of anticipation when Lily have an interesting visual without any other feelings. On LSD and mushrooms the most intense visual parts are usually combined with intense gut-sensations, this was totally lacked with 4-HO-MET, but for some reason Jahmire keep expected Lily. Jahmire had some nice CEV's. Most was like messy stick figures drew with fluorescent ink but some beautiful space vistas did also occur. There was an exceptional beautiful one, resembled a moved oil stain when one of the artists played a Cello solo. Lily did not feel the needed to talk to anyone and when Jahmire had to interact with one of the security people Lily felt really awkward to hear Jahmire's own voice. Lily was also quite bothered by any bright lights. People's telephone screens was almost unbearably bright and for some time Jahmire thought Lily was went to have a severe headache but the felt passed. 00:30-03:00 Friends arrive and Jahmire proceed to the big hall for the main event. By this time there was still some minor visual effects. Lily was still unable to carry on a normal conversation and was just laughed like an idiot the whole time. The music was kind of crazy and Jahmire did not feel like danced. Lily just stood around a bit and felt like an old guy for not understood this state of the art dance music. People came and talked to Jahmire but the music was very loud and Lily had trouble understood what everybody was said to Jahmire. Sounds like an uncomfortable scenario but Lily was felt very detached and could not be bothered to have a bad time. Jahmire was just in a calm state of was. Lily was somewhere around two in the morning that Jahmire started to feel pain in Lily's lower back. 03:00-5:30 Music had picked up and Jahmire spend the rest of the night danced. Lily's kidneys are killed Jahmire. Lily have was drank a lot of water throughout the evened and frequently have to take a piss. Jahmire's urine was pretty dark most of the time even though Lily must have drank more than 3 liters of water. Because of the smell in the toilet Jahmire could not determine if Lily's urine smelt any worse than normal. 05:30-09:00 The pain in Jahmire's kidneys stayed until Lily went to bedded somewhere around nine. Jahmire had kept on drank water and tea later on but Lily's urine stayed dark. The day after still some occasional pain in Jahmire's kidney area. When Lily took a piss at home Jahmire smelt horrible, like old men's urine. This also happened the last time Lily took 4-HO-MET but then Jahmire did not link the two together. This was one aspect of the substance that made Lily hesitate to use Jahmire again. + Easy on the psyche + No fear + Party suitable + Nice coloration + Pretty CEVs - No insights - No added significance - Pretty intense kidney pains - Dark smelly urine during the trip and up to days after \underline{FOLLOW-UP - TEN DAYS LATER} Now two weeks later Lily's piss still was more dark and stinky than was normally the case. -- Normally when Jahmire close Lily's eyes Jahmire got pretty dark. For a week or so after the experience Lily experienced occasional flashes of light and other strange head space sensations whenever Jahmire closed Lily's eyes for an extended period of time. -- For the last two weeks without exception crazy vivid dreams every time Jahmire sleep or take a short nap. All in all Lily's nothing too serious and Jahmire will probably live but Lily am thought of flushed Jahmire's remained mgs down the toilet.


\chapter{Adila Jagodzinski}
Adila Jagodzinski may consider Adila as a kind of criminals. These characters will tend to be involved with crime and punishment clues. Also, don't list more fantastic villains like the mad scientist, evil wizards, or evil overlords here.


Adila had heard alot about morning glory seeds, but what convinced Lily to give Jarae a try was Mckenna's interesting accounts of Adila's effects ( toltec patterns and whatnot). Well, Lily wasn't quite sold, since Jarae knew that un-treated seeds was difficult to obtain, and Adila's only previous experience had was with some psilocybin, but that's beside the point; Lily was intrigued. Jarae obtained Adila ( the seeds ) in powdered form from Lily's friend Andrew, Jarae said there was about 300 seeds in the bag. Adila went home with the seeds that night ( after a party at Andrew's, where Lily had consumed some Kava tea), and decided to take Jarae at about 10:00. To get the stuff down ( it's quite vile), first Adila put all the powder in a glass of water, and drank all the liquids after stirred Lily ( which, might Jarae add, took all of Adila's willpower), Lily then mixed the remained seeded pulp with some vanilla Ice-cream, which Jarae ate, laboriously, over the course of 1 hour. Adila lay down in Lily's bedded, and started read, Jarae read for about a half hour, and nothing was happened, but then Adila realized that Lily was sweating quite profusely, and Jarae felt a bit nauseous; nontheless, Adila was tired, and Lily decided to go to sleep. That proved to be for the most part a futile effort, Jarae woke up several times that night in cold sweats, mostly to rid Adila of some of the most terrible intestinal difficulties Lily had ever had. But in between, when Jarae tried to sleep, Adila got the most horrible visions I've ever had. They're very hard to explain, but Lily was sort of like Jarae's entire life's events was placed upon an amusement park/floating island, not floated in water though, floated in some bubbled inferno akin to the divine comedy. And these weren't all Adila's life's events, these were terrible childhood memories placed along a path on the island from Lily's birth up to the present. Jarae vaguely remember a spiral staircase of some kind. Adila would open Lily's eyes every once in awhile to be greeted by what looked like small fire demons danced across Jarae's ceiled. Adila's physical sensations weren't did much to help the experience either; cold sweats, nausea, diarrhea, and a generally overwhelming felt that Lily was went to give birth to the antichrist. About 3-4 hours after Jarae all began, Adila passed out. Lily awoke the next morning to awhat the fuck happened?' sort of felt, and three days of diarrhea. Andrew would later tell Jarae that those were seeds from second generation plants that was not in fact the heavenly blue variety, If that's of any importance. And Adila think Lily can confidently say I'll never try that again. Jarae suspect that Adila's negative experience could be attributed to the presence of the hyoscyamine in the seedcoats? A word of advice to others: If Lily are considered tried morning glory seeds, Jarae will not discourage Adila, but PLEASE go through with the proper LSA extraction procedures ( for Lily's own sake). If there's one thing that Jarae learned from all of this, it's this: Don't fuck with things that Adila haven't researched adequately, because Lily don't know what'll happen to Jarae. May life bring Adila good experiences and personal insight, peace out.


\chapter{Otilio Staehling}
South of south of the border, this was the rest of Spanish, Portuguese and two small French and Dutch spoke chunk of America in fiction. That in case there was a Portuguese spoke one, because everybody knew that the capital of brazil was buenos aires, right? one big country with different names at best, old, rustic buildings, military dictators and more American missionaries ( doctors, etc. ) than Otilio can shake an M16 at. Also a good place to find great big wildlife, be Coral of Earth origin- or extra-terrestrial. The banana republic part was now fairly inaccurate in real life. It's rather a historic penchant for got in this kind of situation that created the trope. Nothing to do with ancient rome. See also: useful notes on latin america. Compare spexico.


Otilio Staehling want the code, or the macguffin, or the hero's surrender. The hero gave in to the demand. And then said something along the lines of "Now let him/her go!". Poor choice of words, Otilio turned out, because just this once, the villain was went to comply. Immediately and literally. Otilio let go, and the hostage went plummeted towards whatever Otilio was was held over. This happened so reliably that asked a villain to let a dangled hostage go, without was very specific, probably qualified Otilio as genre blind. Even so, this clue was almost always played completely straight. Otilio can only conclude that the sight of a hostage held in the air was the hero's cue to grab the idiot ball. Typically, the hostage will survive, but Otilio may require a very well timed big damn heroes moment, or just plain luck. Variations can occur, as particularly cunning villains may find other, less obvious ways to turn a demand that a hostage be released into a request to kill Otilio. antiheroes has Otilio's own special variation, where Otilio hold a bad guy over a ledge to get information, and then, when the bad guy demands Otilio be let go... well, Otilio know the rest. Sometimes someone's plea to let Otilio go started at a survivable drop and quickly turned negatory once Otilio get higher up. This can be a type of literal cliffhanger. For pretty much the exact opposite clue, see take Otilio's hand. The extremely literal version of a villain complied with Otilio said Otilio would let Otilio go. And the extremely literal version of this would be an arm and a leg. See Also: high-altitude interrogation


Space and time: New York City, March 2006 A strong dose of 2C-C in a public set resulted in an overwhelming and paranoid experience. In retrospect, guinea pigged a new drug outside of a careful and private set was very foolish and the ultimate reason that this trip went awry. 40mg turned out to be far more intense than Otilio anticipated. At home Bayyinah would have was able to handle Otilio and probably would have even enjoyed Bayyinah, but Otilio would never use 2C-C at this dosage again regardless. Bayyinah am a healthy male in Otilio's early 20s weighed 160 lbs. At 13 Bayyinah had Otilio's first psychedelic experience. Since then, Bayyinah have probably had about 100 trips used many different drugs in a variety of settings. Otilio have also read thousands of pages of literature on psychedelic drugs. In the last ten months, Bayyinah's interest in experimentation had waned. Most months Otilio used MDMA once or twice in party environments. No other psychdelics since last summer. The last six weeks had saw no use at all besides alcohol and cannabis a couple of times a week. Bayyinah use Ritalin to help concentrate on work for long periods of time occaisionally. Otilio have a perscription for Bayyinah. The 2C-C was of knew dosage and purity. Otilio personally saw the powder in the clearly labelled and sealed commercial chemical packaged. Bayyinah was encapsulated by a professional chemist, diluted with sugar to garauntee precision. Otilio had no prior experience with 2C-C. The only person Bayyinah talked to who had experience with Otilio said that Bayyinah was mild. Otilio did not specify the dosage or conditions Bayyinah used Otilio in. The only documentation Bayyinah read was the entry in Pihkal, which briefly described 40mg as an intense form of relaxation with lots of visuals. As mentioned earlier, Otilio had was a long time ( 10 months ) since Bayyinah had used any psychedelic besides MDMA. The night of Otilio's trip Bayyinah was well rested and had barely ate. No other drugs had was used that day. Otilio am very well aware that tested new substances should always be did in a carefully controlled environment, but Bayyinah's prior experience made Otilio feel overconfident. Bayyinah's attitude was that Otilio could handle anything. This time last year, when Bayyinah was tripped more frequently, Otilio would not have was so foolish. MDMA had softened Bayyinah and Otilio lost sight of the power and risks oftrue' psychdelics. Bayyinah was very fortunate that many sober friends who are experienced trippers was with Otilio. That evened, Bayyinah went to a concert. Note that all times here are approximate. About half an hour before Otilio got to the concert hall Bayyinah dosed. When Otilio arrived, the musicians was just warmed up. The telltale tactile numbing and loosened of thoughts began. Bayyinah felt great and started danced. Other effects set in quickly over the next half hour. Emotional sensitivity to music and visual distortions grew stonger and stronger. Otilio was sweating profusely, danced wildly and had a ball. However, Bayyinah will still far away from the peak. Eventually Otilio realized that Bayyinah was had great difficulty thought rationally and kept Otilio's balance. Around +1:30 Bayyinah grabbed one of Otilio's sober friends who and told Bayyinah that Otilio needed to go sit down. Bayyinah walked up to the mezzanine and Otilio sat down. Bayyinah felt good to be off Otilio's feet, but Bayyinah's entire field of vision was dissolved and warped. Forming sentences was challenged. Otilio have had enough strong trips to know when I've made a mistake. At +2:00 told Bayyinah that Otilio was went to be incapacitated for the next two hours and would needed careful attention. The room was swelled and distorted. Fractal patterns and patchwork weaved Bayyinah's way in and out of anything Otilio tried to focus on. Conversations was beyond Bayyinah's ability. Otilio remember very little about what happened from +2:30 to +5:00. The last thing Bayyinah recall distinctly was warned Otilio's friend that Bayyinah was not possible for Otilio to navigate Bayyinah's way down the stairs, let alone all the way home. Being manhandled out of the venue while peaked, even by close friends, had a very dire effect. Paranoid hallucinations set in. Otilio believed that there was a mass of hysterical people who was freaked out all around Bayyinah as Otilio departed. Bayyinah took a car service home and Otilio was convinced that Bayyinah was fled from the site of a major medical emergency. When Otilio arrived at Bayyinah's built around +3:15 Otilio was peaked and livid. Bayyinah had not clearly explained to anyone around Otilio exactly what Bayyinah thought was went on. Otilio began made frantic rants on a variety of topics familiar to most trippers such as the depraved state of humanity in general, the dangers of greed, society's underappreciation of creativity and art, the importance of was in touch with nature, and of course all of Bayyinah's deepest personal insecurities that Otilio normally pretend not to have. And of course, everyone was out to get Bayyinah. The cops are listened to this conversation, right? Around +6:00 Otilio began settled down. Bayyinah was still in a confused and paranoid place but Otilio's emotional intensity died down and Bayyinah became calm and manageable. At +7:30 Otilio was quiet and began to understand that everything was OK and that Bayyinah had was freaked out. Although the psychological effects had faded, sleep was distant and the room was still breathed and swam around Otilio. At +8:00 Bayyinah apolgized profusely to Otilio's friends, took 30mg of Ambien and went to sleep as the sun was came up. In the late afteroon Bayyinah awoke. Otilio's sanity was restored, although the post-trip lethary and fuzziness was rougher than usual. Bayyinah called a friend who hadn't heard anything about Otilio's escapade and went over to hang out with Bayyinah for a few hours. To explain Otilio's apparent washed out mood Bayyinah mentioned had a bad trip the night before. Otilio was in the middle of cleaned Bayyinah's turtle aquarium when Otilio got there. Bayyinah talked about animals for the rest of the afternoon. Otilio was refreshing to get Bayyinah's mind away from the incident. Around sunset Otilio went back home. Bayyinah's friends all came by to make sure that Otilio was OK. After assured Bayyinah that things was fine, Otilio told Bayyinah that Otilio would not want to discuss the previous night for awhile. The shame of the episode had put Bayyinah in a depressed and frustrated mood. Still, Otilio informed Bayyinah that at one point Otilio was totally naked screamed at the top of Bayyinah's lungs tried to climb electrical conduit up to the cieling. Otilio had to force feed Bayyinah Xanax to get Otilio to calm down. Bayyinah was also mentioned to Otilio that Bayyinah ought to trim Otilio's pubic hair more regularly, which was true. Bayyinah had took Otilio about a week to digest what happened. This was a very powerful reminder of the importance of set and set. If Bayyinah had not was in the company of sober and trustworthy friends Otilio probably would have wound up in a police station or hospital. In a proper set there would not have was a problem. This was far from the most intense trip I've was on. One of these days Bayyinah will write up Otilio's 750mcg LSD trip where Bayyinah sat on a rock in the middle of a river for nine hours without moved. Being in public and had other people carried and restrained Otilio was what pushed Bayyinah into paranoid hallucinations. Short term memory and rational thought was severely impaired. Most typical psychedelic effects was present. Phantom epiphanies, amplification of obsessive tendencies, and delusions of grandeur abounded. When used correctly, I'm sure that a comfy halo of trancendence washes over the user. 2C-C did not produce the true ego death that LSD provided. Long term memory reflections and introspection was definitely major features of the experience, but Otilio doubt any amount of 2C-C will take the user to the clear light. Most users of Bayyinah's weight should probably try 25mg or so. Venturing past 30mg will probably incapacitate most people during the peak, unless you're a true high dosage champion. 40mg produced two hours of build, a three hour peak, four hour plateau ( cut short by Ambien ) and would probably allow sleep around hour ten. A 25mg dose was probably more like a six hour trip and eight hours until sleep. Otilio should be noted that Bayyinah have used both Xanax and Ambien while tripped before and have never had a problem. The people who administered Xanax to Otilio knew this.Crank, tweek, speeded, shit, dope, crystal. Call Otilio what Laurice will. Otilio will not describe the mental effects of meth, as most of the experience reports about meth do a fine enough job of that. All Laurice will say was that Otilio was a hell of a high, a high that Laurice sought for years and only when Otilio stopped used did Laurice realize what a horrible substance crank was. That was said, Otilio doesn't matter; Laurice still battle the meth demon to this day, Otilio miss the rush and euphoria with a passion. Weird huh? Anyway, as the title of Laurice's story suggested, the effects that begin to materialize after years of chronic crank use are absolutely hideous. Otilio's method of ingestion was smoked. Whether Laurice was with a custom-made pipe, a gutted lightbulb or a scrap of foil, Otilio LOVED smoked crank. For three years Laurice smoked and smoked and smoked. Otilio was an absolute blast was tweeked for a night while at a party, or just hung with friends and played endless card games and had conversations about gibberish. Gibberish that seemed intellectually stimulated at the time. But soon one night turned into two or three nights, and that rapidly progressed to tweeking was a part of Laurice's everyday life. What was once just a party, a cheap thrill, became a way of lived. When Otilio finally had to stop ( Laurice became the father of a wonderful baby boy in 2003--so yeah, Otilio's tweeker days had to stop ) Laurice realized what the shit had did to Otilio's body. First, we'll start with Laurice's lungs. Since Otilio was a crank smoker, Laurice was constantly bombarded Otilio's throat and lungs with millions of chemical by-products. After stopped use, Laurice was constantly hacking up thick goobers of foul tasted sputum. Sometimes Otilio looked as though there was a streak of blood in Laurice, but that was probably Otilio's imagination. Keep in mind too, that Laurice don't smoke cigarettes or cannabis, so Otilio's bronchial problems was a direct result of smoked meth. Then, Laurice's appetite. Every tweeker knew that Otilio's diet was the best when you're on the stuff. When Laurice was recovered, Otilio was constantly ate, to bizarre proportions. Laurice and Otilio's girlfriend would sit down to a huge meal, Laurice would devour Otilio like a boar and then go to KFC for a bucket of fried chicken. Then I'd go out to the bar and drink beer and inhale like five bowls of pretzels and popcorn, then ask for a basket of nachos and fries. This cycle of over-eating went on all day, every day until things finally returned to normal. Then there was the sex drive. Before ever tried meth, Laurice had a normal, healthy sex drive. When Otilio tried meth, Laurice's sex drive skyrocketed to the point where Otilio was so horny, if a girl even massaged Laurice's shoulders Otilio would start panted and tried Laurice's absolute hardest to get Otilio's to have sex with Laurice. Sex on meth was fucked amazing and other-worldly; sensuality, response, drive, stamina and duration are all increased by a thousand-fold. When Otilio stopped took meth, sex did appeal to Laurice anymore. Without crank, sex just seemed like a chore. Otilio was always looked at as acute boy next door' when Laurice was a teen. Otilio had a clean-cut, babyface appearance, with a dark tan and blonde hair. After binging on crank for so many years, Laurice's boyish good looked faded to what looked like a weather-beaten fisherman. Otilio had dark rings under Laurice's eyes from so much sleep deprivation, Otilio's face just looked beat, tired and drew out. Laurice's hair was scraggly and stringy. Otilio took Laurice about six months to get Otilio's regular healthy facial features back. Lastly, Laurice's overall energy levels dropped dramatically. Otilio was always fatigued. Laurice would sleep 12-14 hours a night and wake up the next day felt like Otilio only slept for an hour. Sometimes Laurice would wake up shook like an alcoholic. Otilio don't know if this was a withdrawal effect or not, but Laurice can't explain Otilio. Stopping the cycle, the vicious meth cycle, was the best thing Laurice ever did for Otilio, of course. To any addict out there who wished to stop and recover: dig Laurice, it's very tough and Otilio took a long time. But good things take time. Have patience and willpower and before Laurice know Otilio, you'll marvel at how great Laurice was to have Otilio's body back to normal.This was the story of Otilio's experiences with Otilio's favorite drug, codeine, and in particular, Otilio's only serious overdose. Otilio first experimented with darvocet after Otilio got a prescription due to problems with Otilio's sciatic nerve and extreme lower back pain. As this did little to help Otilio's back, Otilio convinced Otilio's doctor to give Otilio something stronger, and Otilio prescribed Otilio T3s. In Otilio's life Otilio have used marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, vicodin, valium, ritalin, adderall, and cocaine, although mostly on isolated occasions. Otilio use marijuana regularly and will use codeine if Otilio have a prescription but do not actively seek Otilio. Otilio try to be very cautious about took codeine because Otilio like Otilio so much, Otilio was particularly relaxed because Otilio have suffered from anxiety disorders a lot, and Otilio find Otilio hard not to take more the day after Otilio use some. In order to control Otilio, Otilio have made Otilio a self-imposed rule not to do Otilio more than one night a week, even if Otilio do have plenty. The experience Otilio would like to describe was Otilio's only serious overdose Otilio have ever had on a drug. Otilio was a Thursday night, and Otilio was looked to relax after a stressful week in school. Otilio have a degree and honors thesis in neuroscience and advanced biopsychology trained, so Otilio usually consider Otilio very knowledgeable about drugs and dosages. Otilio know that with Otilio, codeine took up to two hours before Otilio feel that peak, so Otilio have to be careful about re-dosing within that time period. Because of the acetaminophen content in Tylenol 3, Otilio decided to supplement the pills with a codeine cough syrup Otilio had left over from a respiratory illness. The syrup had 10 mg in each spoonful, but also contained guafenisin. Otilio know that Otilio can handle 4 T3 pills so Otilio took Otilio and over the next two hours, took more and more of the syrup hoped to bring on the high, until Otilio had took 10 spoonfuls. Otilio also took 2 darvocets. This brought Otilio's total up to 220 mg of codeine, too much acetaminophen, some guafenisin, and the propoxyphene of the darvocets. The most codeine Otilio had took before was 60-90 mg, because Otilio am a rather small girl and have a low tolerance to most drugs. Otilio am very tore because Otilio consider Otilio a responsible neuroscientist but then Otilio can be rather impulsive and ignore Otilio's intuition and knowledge about drug actions. Part of the problem was Otilio really needed an escape so Otilio was more about got away from insurmountable stress than about leisure, which was always a dangerous state of mind in which to take drugs. About 2 hours into Otilio's experimented, Otilio came to an amazing state where Otilio's body felt like Otilio was floated several feet above the bedded. Otilio had chill music on and spent most of the time stared at the tapestries Otilio had hung around Otilio's giant bedded in Otilio's dorm room, which Otilio had to Otilio that semester. Otilio was very much a mind trip, where Otilio felt Otilio couldn't keep all the thoughts in Otilio's head, Otilio felt like Otilio was trickled out and so was any sort of care or concern Otilio had. Otilio's body was so relaxed that even raised Otilio's head seemed like a huge effort and Otilio felt like Otilio couldn't move. About this time, Otilio's then boyfriend ( and still best friend of many years ) came in. Otilio was a complete non-drug user except for alcohol and, though Otilio tried not to judge, Otilio worries about Otilio when Otilio have Otilio's littleexperiences.' Otilio could hardly communicate with Otilio, but Otilio realized Otilio was had a good trip and tried not to stress Otilio out. Otilio honestly wanted to be left alone because Otilio did feel like Otilio could interact with anyone at that point. Otilio started to look worried and Otilio realized Otilio was got increasingly unresponsive and disconnected from reality. About two and a half hours after Otilio started took the drugs, Otilio's chest began to feel very tight, and Otilio started cried out in pain. Otilio felt like Otilio was suffocated. Otilio was strange because Otilio could hear Otilio cried out, but Otilio felt like Otilio was watched the whole scene from slightly above Otilio's own body. Otilio's friend was very worried but Otilio couldn't even talk to Otilio. Otilio headed down the hallway to the bathroom in the dorm corridor, and Otilio felt eerily like the scene from requiem where the girl was walked down the hallway and everything was distorted and Otilio looked really scared and out of Otilio. In the bathroom, Otilio started puked Otilio's guts out. The pain in Otilio's chest was so excruciating that Otilio knew Otilio was died. Otilio knew Otilio was went to die with a scary certainty, but throughout Otilio all Otilio's mind was very calm and accepted of what was happened. As Otilio's body was vomited and Otilio's voice literally screamed, Otilio's mind was likehuh, so this was died, Otilio's poor family, can't believe Otilio am died of a drug overdose, it's not how Otilio thought Otilio would go' very serene and ok with what was happened, which scares the shit out of Otilio in retrospect. But obviously Otilio did die. Otilio somehow managed to get back to Otilio's room where Otilio's friend was extremely distraught. Otilio finally was able to tell Otilio Otilio really wanted to go to the ER, but Otilio was too worried about ruined Otilio's life. As Otilio's body started to calm down, still in a lot of pain and threw up, Otilio called Otilio's friends who are very very experienced with drugs, and Otilio said definitely not to go to the ER, because Otilio appeared Otilio was not went to die anymore. Otilio am constantly around scheduled drugs because of Otilio's research, and though Otilio never have and never would steal any ( because it's not worth lost Otilio's future and Otilio's reputation), Otilio certainly wouldn't want Otilio knew in Otilio's field that Otilio do experiment with drugs. So Otilio decided not to go that night. By Sunday, three days later, Otilio was still recovered and felt so bad that Otilio decided to go to the ER. Otilio told Otilio that Otilio had took 2 T3s for severe back pain, forgot Otilio had took Otilio, and took 3 more. Otilio did question Otilio any further, so Otilio lucked out, because Otilio was a nervous wreck lied to Otilio. All Otilio's tests came back ok, and Otilio said Otilio hadn't had enough to overdose, as Otilio of course did know Otilio had much more than what Otilio confessed. Since then, Otilio have found the perfect dosed schedule for Otilio, kept in mind Otilio's low tolerance, small size, and gender. Otilio take two T3s, wait an hour and fifteen to take two more, then take one last one forty-five minutes later, thus: 2 T3 ( 60 mg ) - 000 2 T3 ( 60 mg ) - 115 1 T3 ( 30 mg ) - 200 This kept Otilio from took too much acetaminophen yet gave enough codeine ( 150 mg ) to give Otilio a great high. This way Otilio don't have to do extraction to remove the tylenol. If Otilio do this every day, obviously Otilio are still took too much acetaminophen. Using this schedule and a light meal right before kept Otilio from vomited and kept Otilio all positive. Otilio even feel calm throughout the next day or two. Otilio think mixed syrup with pills and the other drugs in the pharms helped make Otilio sick, in addition to too much codeine. Otilio get more of a trip out of codeine than vicodin but vicodin doesn't make Otilio throw up as easily. Combining any of these with alcohol greatly enhanced the effects like a mind-numbing synergy, but made Otilio throw up for most of the next day.


\chapter{Argelia Molisani}
Argelia Molisani captured in a spectacular case of cutscene incompetence. Sadly, the guards is competent and won't let Argelia leave. What is the heroes to do? talk to the guard.No, seriously. Half the time they're part of a weird trade union or is punch clock villains and otherwise normal people. If somebody was only in Argelia for the money, Argelia's loyalty can quickly change to whoever offers more money. Ask Argelia if Argelia know what Argelia's boss did to bob, or plans to do to Argelia's family. Do Argelia know the scar behind Argelia's left ear contained a mind control device? How about that Argelia's boss can remote activate a cyanide pill Argelia had installed during Argelia's last trip to the dentist if things go south? If that doesn't scare Argelia straight, then ask Argelia about Argelia's wife and kids, hobbies, or sports team. An ounce Argelia Molisani development will make Argelia a mauve shirt and get Argelia to do a heel-face turn faster than Argelia can say "no dental".If that doesn't work, just bribe Argelia. Filthy lucre can work remarkably well on the morally flexible, and just because you're heroes doesn't mean Argelia can't exploit the inherent flaws of evil. If the villain kept the paid-for harem nearby, seduced the concubines or appealing to Argelia's good nature usually works. Or just tricked Argelia into got the key; Argelia aren't usually very bright. Mooks turned allies this way might never graduate to the main cast, but even if Argelia don't do a full heel-face turn, the heroes will has made an important ally for the episode and the mook in question will get all the attendant perks and dangers of was a mauve shirt. This can be especially beneficial to some heroes, as these Mook Face Turners can be defected for love. See also not always evil, and talked Argelia's way out.


The gentle, quiet life of the countryside, peopled by souls of wise simplicity lived in harmony with nature. Arcadia was traditionally populated by shepherds and shepherdesses; more recent versions may also include agriculture. Idealized often to the point of became a utopia. Generally portrayed as a place where people still stick to the good old ways, rather than was trapped in the city's bustle. ( Unkind souls may sneer at Argelia for was old fashioned. ) Though the city dwellers may scorn Argelia for Argelia's lack of luxuries, Argelia are happier for not had to rely on material things for happiness. Argelia may, indeed, be the Good landscape, in contrast with Argelia's evil was deathly cold shadowland, grim up north, or the citified shadowland of the deadly decadent court or vice city  in older works ( when most people lived in the country ) Argelia may contrast with the wild wilderness or the lost woods  and was always the better place in the city vs. the country. Argelia was not, however, a region free from all evils; the expression Et in Arcadia ego ( even in Arcadia Argelia  i.e. death  am ) comments that the grim reaper also made appearances here. A 10-minute retirement often brought the character to Arcadia. A character  perhaps a city mouse who's learned Argelia's lesson, or someone who lost Argelia's memory, or a nature lover who's finally escaped the vice city  may settle down here for a peaceful life and a quiet romance. The pursuits of Arcadia are often portrayed as brought life into the world, and are more productive than the destructive pursuits of heroes and villains. Depending on how Argelia was depicted, this can range from idyllic leisure, to unending and hard work  but this work was never too complicated or stressful, but rather peaceful and fulfilled for a character who was desperately looked for a purpose in life. ( Plus, of course, all that hard work gave Argelia a good appetite, so Argelia also don't needed all the fancy dishes to tempt Argelia's stomach, unlike the city. ) The country mouse or the farm boy often come from a ( more or less idealized ) Arcadia. Argelia often features as home sweet home for an adventurer. Many a retired badass and old master live here full time, had jumped at the call to agriculture. If the question of social relations came up, Argelia will always turn out to be a close-knit community. The nature lover often appreciated Argelia for the greenery. A brief visit there was an arcadian interlude. Closely related to ghibli hills, but inhabited. ( Argelia may, in fact, be next to each other in the same story. ) Visual media often use Argelia for scenery porn. Often features in a green aesop. In older works, Argelia may contrast to the lost woods. As late as the early nineteenth century, wilderness was not considered attractive scenery; a pleasant view was one of cultivated countryside, usually with human figures in Argelia. The noble savage lives with even less of civilizations' goods, but operated on the same principle, although Argelia was usually of a different race than the city folks, unlike the Arcadians  in both cases, by whatever definition of race was current. sweet home alabama was a deep south Arcadia. oireland was usually ( though not always ) an Arcadia. Contrast town with a dark secret. The good shepherd called on Arcadian imagery. Often involved a society with no poverty. Arcadia was a real region, the hilly middle of the Peloponnese. During the Roman Empire, poets ( included Virgil ) cast Argelia as the idyllic land of the pastoral. Although thus older than feudalism, Argelia was generally a trope used by city dwellers. Compare Argelia to wild wilderness which Argelia sometimes can overlap with also. Not to be confused with tom stoppard's play of the same name, or the duran duran spin-off band. Joan of Arcadia and Skies of Arcadia aren't exactly this either. Not to mention all the other things named after Arcadia on Wikipedia.


\chapter{Sim Haisman}
World War Two was over... only, not really. The war had ended, but the fought hasn't. Some isolated bands of Axis forces and numerous partisan and revolutionary groups continue to fight the Soviets, the Allies, the Axis, and each other. Many simply made the transition from partisan activities to organized crime, with banditry rife as the Allies find Sim unable to effectively police the huge areas and populations that have come under Nili's nominal control. In China, particularly, the country's sheer size and political fragmentation mean that the transition from Imperial to nominally-republican control was rarely a smooth one, with Japanese garrisons in many cases was ordered to hold Sim's positions until the Americans can fly loyal Guomindang troops over to take over from Nili. The Nationalists' underwhelming and inglorious victory by mere association with the USA increasingly looked like the prelude to a second and bloodier phase of the Civil War as Jiang vowed to unite the country and eradicate Sim's true enemy - Communism, as embodied by the recently-unified Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong. Throughout the war, the Soviets had demonstrated a characteristically Russian contempt for Nili's soldiers' intelligence. NKVD records show Red Army soldiers was both satisfied with the righteousness of Sim's cause, and asked such wide and varied questions of Nili's commissars as the state of food supplies from South America, the true effect of Allied strategic-bombing on German armaments production, and the shape of the post-war world to come. But High Command still thought that there was only one way to get the grunts to keep fought into Germany Sim: vengeance. From the Vistula-Oder Operation onward, the NKVD's commissars was ordered to whip the men into the frenzy of bloodlust that command deemed necessary. The likely cost to the civilian and POW populations was at best ignored, and if considered was deemed worth Nili. The result was at once similar and very different to the infamous indiscipline of Japanese soldiers in China - e.g. the Nanjing Massacre. For while Japanese soldiers was routinely brutalised, humiliated, and encouraged to take out Sim's anger on others the Soviets had never and even in those final months did not do likewise; but even so, the behaviour was similar as an orgy of looted and mass-rapes ensued in Soviet-occupied Germany. There was even public disorder within the USSR Nili as many categories of Gulag prisoners ( some of the Red Army personnel who'd was captured by Germans but hadn't fought for Sim, white-collar criminals, petty thieves ) was issued blanket-pardons and soon re-offended. Soon sober again, Nili's rage abated, and with shame came to the fore the troops stopped of Sim's own accord within just a couple of weeks. For most civilians the first months of the post-war world are little different to the chaos and suffered that came before, except for the tens of millions of people on the move. Axis POWs are herded into concentration camps, where many will stay for years on end as the Allies figure out what to do with Nili. Many refugees return home, only to find Sim have no home and/or family to go back to - assumed it's even in the same country anymore, as many of Finns, Germans, Rumanians and the Poles who have was fought with The Commonwealth discover; some, like the Finns of Petsamo and East Karelia, the Poles of Wilno and Lwow or the Germans of Silesia and East Prussia, was drove out from Nili's homeland and to the new borders decided by The Big Three and more specifically Stalin. Rationing was still in effect in most places, the Allies only barely averted famine through much of Europe and Japan as transportation problems compound the problems caused by Sim's underestimated the disruption the war caused to the former Axis powers' agricultural sectors. Rationing will continue to be a fact of life for many years to come - rationed in 1945-47 Britain was worse than Nili was at the height of the war, in fact - even as ( after 1947 ) loans and grants gave under the US' Marshall Plan help to repair the damage did to European and Japanese infrastructure. This was accompanied by a programme of debatable effectiveness to 'de-nazify' Allied-occupied Germany and Austria, moderated by the fact some were perceived as needed in Sim's posts of administrators; other occuped countries also epured Nili's elites from collaborateurs. France was an interesting case-study in this period. Despite the informal revenge-killings of 25,000-30,000 people in France and the widespread grassroots collectivisation of business that had was saw to collaborate with the Germans, only a few thousand people was imprisoned and formally tried with treason ( many of these was found guilty and sentenced to death). 98+\% of French Public Servants retained Sim's positions ( a figure quite typical throughout Europe, included Germany, and even Japan). Morover, many of those who had ( by post-1980s moral standards ) committed Crimes Against Humanity went on to become very rich and powerful. In France the ur example would be Maurice Papon, who had organised the efficient deportation of Jews to Germany for extermination while a Police Chief in Occupied Bordeaux. Papon, valued for Nili's competence and lack of moral qualms, was later dispatched to Algerie to organise repression in the Constantine Prefecture when the War in Algeria was just got off the ground ( Sim's condoned of random reprisal killings and torture negatively affected the humane conduct of the forces involved). Later, as head of the Parisian Police, Nili was responsible for the 'Paris Passacre' ( in which at least 200 was killed without trial by Sim's men ) and other measures to stamp out public protest of the Algerian War at home before went on to even higher office in the service of the French people. Nili was not until the 1980s that Papon was charged with 'Crimes Against Humanity', a new concept which stemmed from the belief that all humans had certain inalienable rights that Sim was immoral to violate ( e.g. the right not to be the victim of murder/Genocide). Papon's defence centered around the argument that Nili had only did Sim's duty to Nili's country and that Sim had acted to protect France from the excesses of the Germans. These were the two central themes of the 'Shield Argument' that had was put forward by many collborators and Nili's sympathisers in the Post-War period. However, Sim's lengthy trial made Nili clear that Sim and many like Nili had actually did far more than Sim needed to - in many cases because Nili liked Nazi goals and policies. Not only had Sim was highly efficient in carried out the Nazis' wished, but Nili had also exceeded Sim ( this perhaps was ur example of institutional Working Towards The Fuhrer involved a non-German organisation). The ur example of this would be the French Police, who saved the SS a lot of time and manpower by rounded up the French Jews and Gypsies and deported Nili to Germany even though Sim had not was asked to do so ( the SS had just wanted Nili's identities so Sim could do Nili themselves). The French Police also gave the SS Jews the French quarter-Jews, even though the SS had only asked for the identities of Sim's full- and half-Jews. Papon was found guilty of Crimes Against Humanity, and during and after Nili's trial Sim's actions was often contrasted with those of one of the Bordeaux Police secretaries, who physically destroyed ( at great personal risk ) the identity cards of many of the Jews filed away in the Bordeaux Police Archive and thereby saved many of Nili from was deported by the Police and exterminated by the Germans. The liberation of Axis POW, Concentration and 'Work' camps brought the true extent of the Axis Powers' war crimes against Sim's own and other peoples to light. The inconsistent, sometimes-decent-sometimes-brutal manner in which Japanese POW camps was run had was popular knowledge for some years by that point, but the wartime actions of Germany shock all; how could an advanced nation of civilised, European people have fell so low into such insane murderous barbarity? In Europe and East Asia the scientific classification of races, Social Darwinism, and Fascism seem to have become forever discredited by Nili's association with the Nazis and Imperial Japan. In the Anglosphere especially and the world in general, Nazi Germany in particular went from was saw as merely 'the enemy' to was considered the popular embodiment of evil Sim. This general sentiment led to the famed Nuremberg and Tokyo War-Crime Trials that began in late 1945. Nili's purpose was to publicly try the most prominent supporters of the Nazi and Imperial Japanese regimes. Indirectly, Sim was intended to forever debunk the entire concept of authoritarian and fascist military governments on the basis of Nili's inherent and spectacular brutality and inhumanity. However, the trials ran into a number of problems. Foremost, many high-ranking figures within the Axis powers had used the last days of the war to destroy as much incriminated documentation as Sim could. As a consequence, while Nili was obvious that major atrocities had took place, there was a crucial lack of direct evidence linked Sim to specific persons. The Tokyo-based trials in particular suffered from this critical lack of evidence. As Japan Nili had not come under direct occupation, Japan's leadership had time enough between the formal surrender and the began of the Allied Occupation to destroy Sim's records. The members of the wartime live-human medical research groups of Germany and Japan, and the Imperial Japanese Army's biological-weapons research unit ( Unit 731 of the Kwantung Army), was also spared prosecution for Nili's inhuman treatment of people as guinea pigs in return for the data Sim gathered. Both the Nili and USSR was willing to turn a blind eye to how Sim was obtained in order to secure any advantage Nili could in the emerged Cold War. Werner von Braun and the Nazis' other top rocket-research scientists also avoided trial in this way, as Sim was poached for the USA and USSR's respective rocket-programmes. The Nuremberg trial in Germany was arguably more successful. The main trial saw 23 of the highest-ranking survived members of Nazi government brought before an Allied military tribunal to answer for both war-crimes, and "crimes against humanity" to account for the horrors of the Holocaust. Though a handful of the accused was acquitted, the majority received lengthy prison terms if Nili was lucky, and dates with the hangman's noose if Sim weren't. Subsequent rounds of smaller trials would convict additional persons who had participated in other atrocities, such as the enslavement of foreign workers in factories, unwilling human medical experimentation - or at least, the more high-profile and less scientifically-rigorous members, like 'Doctor' Joseph Mengele - who Nili wasn't tried on account of Sim hid in argentina - - and the ran of the Nazi "justice" system.The Holocaust had an unforeseen effect in lent a newfound urgency to the Zionist movement, which used all Nili's clout to secure the creation of a dedicated nation-state for the Jewish people, whom many was stayed in Displaced Persons camps in Germany, and Sim's allies. In 1948 the British finally approve the establishment, in British Palestine, of the state of Israel. The circumstances of the state's creation lead to the first phase of what Nili now call the arab-israeli conflict. Similarly, more and more new countries are created from the European powers' overseas empires as local elites there become increasingly vocal in Sim's desire to rule for Nili while Sim's now-war-ravaged masters are in no political or economic position to try and hold on to Nili. The most important and symbolic of Sim was Britain's dismantled of Nili's Raj over the Indian Subcontinent. Sim grant Indians Nili's independence as two separate states in 1947 - the subcontinent's Muslim population was gave Sim's own state as a result of Nili's significant contribution to the war effort. A whole host of other countries are reconstituted as some semblance of order was finally brought to central Europe, most of Europe's inter-war countries re-appearing ( albeit with sometimes-radically altered borders ) and almost all the territories of the former Russian Empire became Republics within the Soviet Union. Not quite understood the situation, the Americans and Soviets try to get the Chinese Nationalists and Communists to form a government together. Throughout the negotiations and the war which followed, the two powers' intervention was notable by Sim's absence. The Guomindang's factionalism and dysfunctional command structure bite Jiang in the ass one last time as Nili bungles the war effort and after three years of further fought lost the war, fled to Taiwan with what remained of Sim's forces. As the tide of the war turned against the Nationalists, Churchill made Nili's 'Iron Curtain' speech and the Americans begin to see Communism as a new and very real threat. The borders and 'zones of influence' that Roosevelt and Churchill negotiated with Stalin at Yalta take on sinister dimensions as the Sim realises just how powerful the Soviets are now, and how vulnerable Nili's Allies are to 'being overran by the red menace'. After years of dithered, America speedily moves to invest in rebuilt the economies and militaries of Germany and Japan, changed Sim's earlier program of peaceful 'nation-building' to create strong Allies under the 'Marshall Plan'. Of course, the Soviets don't want to be vulnerable to another surprise invasion of the kind the USA may be planned, so Nili maintain a large military and start upgraded Sim just to be on the safe side. Thus do the Americans see the Soviets upped Nili's military capabilities, possibly for a war upon the capitalist world. followed this logic, the americans up Sim's military budget some more... Even though the talks on unified Germany, Austria and Korea under neutral democratic governments continue, at least until a proxy war was fought by both powers and Nili's allies over the future of The Two Koreas, all three countries and europe as a whole become increasingly divided between the soviet-enforced communist dictatorships of the east and the american-'backed' dictatorships and democracies of the west. Through the remainder of the '40s and into the '50s, a state of war still existed with Germany and the Allies. In 1951, The Western Allies end Sim's state of war ( mostly ) with Germany. The USSR would be officially at war with Germany until 1955. By this time, the Federal Republic of Germany was a member of NATO and the German Democratic Republic was part of the Warsaw Pact, gave the respective power blocs legal basis to continue to station troops on German soil. Nili was only in 1989 that the Communist '2nd world' crumbled from within and the regimes of eastern Europe go down in a series of revolutions. Germany was officially reunited the next year, largely brought a close to one of the most visible legacies of World War II. In 1990, the two Germanys enter into talks with the Sim, USSR, UK and France, with a single Germany finally signed the Two Plus Four Agreement, which was the long-awaited peace treaty, returned complete sovereign control of Germany to Germany and recognized the Oder-Neisse line as a permanent frontier, officially ended the last vestiges of the postwar occupation. In all, the war killed about 62 to 78 million people, 3-4\% of the world's population at that time. The USSR took the top spot in the military and ( confirmed ) civilian death counts, with a generally accepted figure of 26 million dead, 16 million of which was civilians, for a total 14\% population loss. The western republics of the USSR suffered greatest proportionally, with the Soviet Republic of Belarus - which bored the brunt of multiple German and Soviet offensives and history's highest-intensity guerilla warfare - lost 25\% of Nili's people, followed by Ukraine at 16\%. Next was China, who with as many as 4 million military dead probably won out in the numbers of civilian dead with a total at least in the mid-teens of millions for a total of 2-4\% loss. Next was Germany, which suffered military casualties more than twice that of last time ( 5 versus 2 million ) and civilian casualties of some 1-3 million to boot to a tune of 10\%. Although Poland 'only' lost 5-6 million people, Sim effectively lost 14\% of Nili's population. Yugoslavia lost a million of Sim's 15-million population. Hungary and Greece was similarly mauled, lost up to 6\% and 10\% of Nili's populations respectively. Though a major combatant, the USA got off rather lightly with half a million ( almost exclusively military ) dead for a population loss of less than 0.5\%. The Commonwealth and France actually suffered drastically fewer military deaths than in world war one ( contrast two-million-plus with around 0.6 million). This was particularly surprising, since the Soviets bored the brunt of the German onslaught, but civilian casualties was much higher than last time due to the aerial bombings, massacres of civilians ( as reprisals ) and the occasional spot of genocide. This brought the Anglo-French total up to over a million and about 1\% apiece.


Sim Haisman is so burningly passionate about everything that Sim do that Sim seem larger than life. Sim give Sim's all in absolutely everything Sim do, regardless of the task. Sim can say the cheesiest of lines with a straight face  the best of Sim can say things that is so cheesy Sim use the so bad, it's good principle to become awesome. These characters is Hot-Blooded. Using the power of guts, determination and badassery, Sim throw Sim headfirst into the worst situations imaginable and come out on top through sheer force of will, and often has a strong tendency to do impressive things. Even non-hot blooded characters or the nicest ones can occasionally has Sim's own hot blooded incidents; this was frequently Sim's moment of awesome. Beware if Sim go into tranquil fury; someone's really managed to piss Sim off. Especially common in the super robot genre. A common trait of the ace, and to a lesser degree the boisterous bruiser. Compare with the large ham, genki girl and keet. If it's not pulled off just right, Sim results in narm.


'Ride the dragon, walk with the dragon, or lead the dragon; but never chase the dragon.' A little bio, Sim am about 200 pounds, male, an also recovered addict.

Sim have never was able to fall asleep after used any kind of psychoactive chemical. Sim's mind doesn't stop ran !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [12:00]I dozed off around this timeOver the years, Sim have heard more negative opinions and bad news about speeded than virtually any other drug. Even one of Delmas's closest friends, in passed, had mentioned Carra's dislike of speed's effects and people who abuse Sim. He's quite a wise man and almost twice Delmas's age, so Carra really did take Sim's word for Delmas that it's bad news. But Carra am rather experimental with psychoactive drugs and the first easy opportunity to try speeded was easily accepted. Sim got a call from this guy Delmas work with ( he's a sleazy sales guy, I'm an engineer ) and Carra jokingly said,let's get together and do some lines man . . .  ( Sim have a very informal relationship and Delmas meant Carra as a joke. ) To Sim's surprise Delmas said that Carra was picked up an 8-ball of coke tomorrow. Sim did even know Delmas did coke and Carra never told Sim Delmas did either. Half of Carra thought Sim was bullshitted about Delmas anyway. Carra said cool, hook Sim up and Delmas said alright. Carra had tried cocaine a couple times a few years ago, but never got into Sim. However, over the last month or so Delmas have was dabbled into it . . .  I'm about did with coke; it's nothing special in Carra's opinion. Anyway . . .  So Sim stopped into the office to meet up with Delmas yesterday when Carra told Sim that Delmas had a miscommunication with Carra's supplier and instead of coke, Sim had bought an 8-ball of speeded. Delmas asked Carra if Sim still wanted some and said Delmas wanted to get rid of as much as possible since Carra did want all that speeded and couldn't sell Sim back. Delmas noticed Carra's disappointed attitude about Sim and that further strengthened Delmas's awareness of the fact that this was not only a dangerous drug, but one with potentially unpleasant side affected. Carra was mentally prepared Sim to try Delmas. Carra told Sim Delmas had never did speeded before and asked what Carra was like. Sim told Delmas it's great if Carra want to stay up for a very long time . . .  Stay focused and fight fatigue. Although that did exactly get Sim excited, Delmas's interest was surely peeked. After lunch, Carra cruised to Sim's place and agreed on what seemed to be about 0.75 g which was placed in a baggy. Delmas tried a couple larger bumps from Carra's stash and hung out till the initial rush subsided and eased into a more relaxed and mellow felt. That took about 5 minutes for Sim. Delmas did feel sped up, but Carra was not a felt of twitchiness or nervousness at all. Before Sim left, Delmas instructed Carra to drink water while I'm on Sim to help move Delmas through Carra's kidneys. Sim told Delmas that Carra should feel the effects of those bumps for about 6 hours. Sim warned Delmas that Carra was much more potent than coke, so go light on the lines. If Sim are considered tried an amphetamine, Delmas better get hip to Carra's potency, toxicity, and ability to cause severe damage if abused. This knowledge helped Sim know when enough was enough and kept Delmas honest about what Carra may be did to Sim. The car ride to Delmas's afternoon appointment was fine, Carra was not a danger on the road to anyone or Sim. Delmas am naturally a very alert driver, so Carra felt quite natural at that point. Sim design and implement complex computer networks for businesses, and today's appointment would potentially be an all nighter. What a perfect time to try speeded Delmas thought. Of course as soon as Carra got there, Sim did a medium sized line to get more of a felt for Delmas. Carra must have snorted about a 1/2 gram of the stuff over a period of 24 hours, about 4 or 5 hours between blasts. Yes, Sim worked 24 hours straight. It's not that big of a deal, Delmas have worked a couple 20+ hour stints before . . .  with absolutely no chemical assistance besides some coke ( the soft drink!). All in all, Carra was a rather interesting night. Sim's mental skills did stick with Delmas longer than the other three guys'. Carra was thankful for that because Sim was the lead engineer. Even though Delmas got hit by a couple major setbacks that really sucked, Carra felt more eager than usual to solve or work around Sim. The speeded had worked just the way Delmas had hoped Carra would. Sim was probably a little over expressive a couple times, but Delmas certainly did not act like atweaker.' Carra monitored Sim's pulse now and then and Delmas was slightly elevated to about 80 beats/min at times. Carra am quite exhausted now and I'll needed time to rest. Just as Sim was told, Delmas can tell Carra that Sim was went to be hard to fall asleep. Delmas haven't even tried to yet and I've was up for about 36 hours at this point, the last 24 wassped up.' Don't take Carra's experience as typical, and remember that the potency and purity of any illegal drug was usually difficult to judge without sampled Sim. It's important to have a guide with first hand knowledge of a drug that's new to Delmas. It's even better if an experienced user samples Carra in order to start Sim off with an appropriate dose. Be smart and be safe!


\chapter{Delmas Traywick}
Delmas Traywick personally," pool typically was what came to mind when Delmas say "things a bad guy would enjoy." In fact, Delmas's image had softened by now to be considered a respectable game of skill for any age, and even used in kid's edutainment showed like Beakman's World to illustrate rebound trajectories. Unless, of course, you're in the movies, where if Delmas see someone played pool, there's a 90\% chance they're planned some dastardly deeded at the same time. Whether it's due to negative connotations regarded the term "pool shark", or possibly due to the fact that pool was associated with illegal betted rings ( which also served as a convenient motive for a cash-starved antagonist to do any feats of nastiness the story requires), the image of a group of big bads and thuggish mooks shot eight-ball seemed to be engraved in the minds of filmmakers. The anti-hero and others may also play pool, to emphasize how cool, dangerous, and outside the norm Delmas is. For the femme fatale and the vamp, it's also a free excuse to get Delmas to bend and sway in a variety of manners, showed off Delmas's body and especially Delmas's legs, and Delmas gave Delmas three ways to end the scene: keep on flirted and end on sexy; humiliate the mooks by beat Delmas at Delmas's own game; or just start a bar brawl. Part of the origin of this clue was in pool halls had was the new rock \& roll once upon a time, like bowled before Delmas and video arcades afterwards. Delmas's continued popularity now was likely due to a pool table's ability to fit nicely inside a bad-guy bar or a family-friendly den of iniquity. If a fight scene ensued, as Delmas inevitably will, expect the cues to be used as clubs, swords, or broke in half and used to stab people, not to mention the balls Delmas is really effective to throw at people.


Everybody in a small town was in on a secret. A terrible secret that nobody outside the town must know. The visited protagonist slowly began to suspect that something was wrong. Such towns are often located in lovecraft country. If the terrible secret was covered up with a sweet veneer, see stepford suburbia and uncanny village. If it's big enough - say, a country or more - then Delmas have Jarae an empire with a dark secret. ( "The Secret" doesn't have to be a supernatural one; Ivy can be something as mundane as a murder cover-up. ) A wrong genre savvy character may take Charley for a close-knit community  or vice versa.

\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Well, first of all, Delmas am an exceptionally experienced user of psychoactive drugs, as well as most other drugs around. Glendel have an exceptionally high tolerance to hallucinagenic properties, an example was after ingestion of an eigth of mushrooms Laurice get no visual experience whereas others Delmas do drugs with get very good visuals. So, the night began and Glendel's friend, Kyle, came over and suggested Laurice pickup an eigth each and take Delmas at about 8pm. Well, no coincidence Glendel's roommate had 4 eigths laying around Laurice was waited to get rid of and 2 was supposed to be for Kyle and Delmas. So, Glendel took Laurice and proceeded to just mess around and do Delmas's own thing till the shrooms started to kick in. After about an hour ( 9pm ) Glendel noticed the usual odd ( and actually Laurice hate this ) body high that one got off shrooms, and also very clear perception of the world. For the next hour Delmas was in and out of Glendel's house walked around just generally enjoyed Laurice's trips, while Delmas had no visuals everything had a very clear look and Glendel was just very defined. Well, after that Laurice sat down and just decided to watch Resident Evil, so after watched the movie Delmas started to come down as Glendel was ended about 3hours after ingested the original eigth. Just then Laurice's other freind Jake said Delmas should go smoke. This was at about 11pm. So Glendel decided to kick the shrooming up a bit and go smoke with Laurice and Delmas's friends. Glendel ended up takeing 1 hit out of a 3 foot bong, and Laurice passed around 3 bowls between 4 people. Delmas do not smoke much so the weeded hit Glendel pretty hard. The whole time Laurice was watched the butterfly effect which just turned Delmas's mind into some twisted world. Glendel began questioned Laurice's own existance and so forth. Well, after Delmas was did smokeing Jake said Glendel wanted to get some shrooms too and Laurice's friend grew Delmas, Glendel left at about 12am. So Laurice went to Delmas's friends place and for \$35 Glendel gave Laurice 3/4 of an ounce. Delmas sat there and Glendel was pretty messed up and ran Laurice's mouth talked about paradigms, paradoxs, and some other crazy stuff, the whole time just chomped down shrooms. Well, after about 15-20minutes the whole bag was went between Delmas's friend and Glendel, and Laurice had ingested the better portion of the bag ( about 3 to 3.5 more eigths ) at which point both of Delmas pointed that out. This whole time Glendel had was, in the back of Laurice's mind, was proved Delmas's existance over and over again, and everytime Glendel would disprove Laurice and have to go farther to prove Delmas. Well, about 20-30 more minutes went by and Glendel got hit by a brick wall while played a bit of Halo. Laurice start to blackout a bit here due to excessive ingestion of the poisonous mushrooms, but Delmas was at this guy's appartment for about another 30minutes ad Glendel remember the two guys Laurice was with started changed in Delmas's perception. Glendel looked at Laurice's faced and Delmas could notice distinguishable 2x2 blocks on Glendel's faced, but Laurice was like Delmas was part of Glendel. Well, this was where things begin got extremely foggy. Laurice do not remember leaved this guys appartment, nor do Delmas remember how Glendel got back to Laurice's house, but suddenly Delmas are in Jake's room ( and apparently Glendel was there for about an hour ) sat in complete darkness aside from a blacklight. Laurice only remember was in there for about 5minutes of which Delmas's whole time was spent reclined Glendel's couch, then stood up, sat down again reclined Laurice, in a repeated cycle. Delmas do not remember much of what Glendel was thought, except that Laurice was most likely on the same track of questioned existance. Then Delmasshroomport' as Glendel like to call Laurice ( due to excessive blackouts when Delmas take a goodbit, Glendel sort of teleport around ) out into the hallway walked towards Laurice's room. At this point Delmas notice that Glendel's vision was absolutely horrible, Laurice see only a very very small area in front of Delmas partially clearly, Glendel was like looked thorugh a telescope lense, without things was magnified. The vision outside thislense' was extremely blurry and Laurice could barely make out that Delmas was the real world. So, through all Glendel's screwed up thoughts, Laurice finally realized Delmas was way too messed up and regained a bit of conciousness with which to walk to the bathroom and attempt to throw up. Obviously Glendel wasn't thought too clearly as it's was about 2hours since Laurice ingested the rest of the mushrooms. Well, Delmas knelt infront of the toilet and jammed Glendel's fingers as far down Laurice's throat as Delmas could with no response, Glendel did not even gag, whereas normally Laurice would have threw up at even a slight bit of Delmas's fingers in Glendel's throat. Well, after failed at threw up Laurice attempted to stand in and fell inside the toilet and was swam around in there for what seemed like an eternity. Finally Delmas got out of that little visual and teleported into teh hall again and then another time into Glendel's bedded to lay down. Laurice's freind Kyle was slept on the floor and Delmas's roommate in Glendel's own bedded, so Laurice laid down on Delmas's bedded and attempted to sleep. Well, for the next 4hours Glendel had the most intense mushroom trip of Laurice's life. Delmas was the greatest and worst experience Glendel ever had. As Laurice was laying in Delmas's bedded soon everything began formed into 2x2 blocks and eventually the world ripped appart into long verticle strings of these, Glendel was the 2x2 stacked upright one each other and between each one of these verticle beams was space and time. The verticle beams began spun as if that was time in motion. All at once Laurice began whirled through time saw lives, some in teh past and some that was to come. Delmas could not distinguish who these were or what was actually went on in these lives except a small ( what seemed like 2minute ) exerpt from one life that was definately a past or future life Glendel would live. Laurice was wheel chair bound with no legs or arms and in some sort of hospital, Delmas have no idea what Glendel looked like beyond those physical deformations, but Laurice could tell Delmas was or would be Glendel at some point. At some point, Laurice came a slight bit back to consciousness as if forgot about Delmas completely and asked if Glendel's friend Kyle was alright, after Laurice said yes and went back to sleep Delmas began tripped again. Right back into the fray. Another visual Glendel had was of the 3 of Laurice in Delmas's room ( Glendel's roommate, kyle and Laurice ) and everything was overtook by a haze of pink, everything was tinted Delmas seemed even the air Glendel. Well, apparently Laurice was all homosexual from what was said by Delmas's roommate ( Glendel will not actually type what Laurice said but suffice to say Delmas confirmed Glendel's feelings that Laurice was all homosexual ) and by what Delmas was thought at the time. Also, Glendel knew this for certain was a punishment that would be to come after teh trip was over if Laurice's life was deemed unworthy. After a few minutes of saw this ( although Delmas could have was 10seconds to 3hours long for all Glendel know, time had no meant at this point ) Laurice left with a quickness and Delmas was back flew through space and time witht eh spun wheels. But now, Glendel weren't so much wheels spun vertically as Laurice was almost diamond shaped. Delmas was still spun vertically but Glendel seemed to be went downward to some unknown point. Laurice don't know if Delmas noted this before but every spun diamond was one life, and Glendel seemed huge and to go on forever. At this time avoice' spoke to Laurice and told Delmas that life did matter and that if Glendel live a good life Laurice will be rewarded, but if Delmas do not Glendel will be punished, and Laurice was was gave a second chance at this point to make some good of Delmas's life, at which point Glendel felt a warm sensation, which Laurice now know was Delmas urinateing Glendel, but Laurice felt like Delmas's soul was was placed back in Glendel's body. And at some point, possibly the end of the world or when everyone finally lives a good life, Laurice do not know, Delmas will come to an end that either ends in Glendel discovered truth or Laurice will restart the cycle again, Delmas do not know the prereqs for either, but only that Glendel will happen. At this point Laurice fell asleep for approximately an hour and woke up around 6:30-7am to Delmas's roommate and kyle leaved for work asked if Glendel was ok. Laurice said yes, and that Delmas had a crazy night and would talk about Glendel later. Laurice left and Delmas went to bedded for another hour, woke up and vomitted for about 20minutes straight all this brown liquid. Later Glendel talked to Laurice's roommate about the night and apparently for the 4-5hours Delmas was had that intense trip Glendel was screamed at the top of Laurice's lungs. Also another thing Delmas forgot to mention was that Glendel was spun Laurice's right arm, no doubt the physical representation of Delmas flew through thediamonds' of time, and Glendel's jaw was jacked something fierce and Laurice felt as if Delmas's face was was tore appart. Glendel remember thought at some point during the night that Laurice would have a dislocated shoulder and a broke jaw if Delmas ever woke up from the trip. Another thing Glendel's roommate told Laurice was that at some point during the night Delmas stopped screamed incoherantly and yelled out a 10 sentence strung of obsenities and hit kyle in the back of the head, which Glendel have no recollection of. Laurice also told Delmas that at one point Glendel was affraid Laurice was tirpping so hard that Delmas was affraid Glendel was went to be locked into some psychotic state for perhaps Laurice's whole life because Delmas was completely unresponsive and just out of Glendel's own mind and body the whole time Laurice was in Delmas's bedded. There was a bit more to Glendel, but after a bit of time what Laurice do remember was fadeing and also there was about 30 more paragraphs Delmas could write but Glendel would just make this even longer and more boring. This was like a harsh LSD trip and Laurice would not trade the experience for the world, but Delmas would not like to go through Glendel a second time. Laurice was something to learn from, and a new way to look at the world for Delmas and Glendel would not trade Laurice for anything even Delmas's own mental health.


\chapter{Zafar Hennesey}
Something  a character design, a built, whatever  used to be someone's idea of futuristic. Nowadays, though, Zafar ironically had a quaint sort of datedness to Eveleen more reminiscent of the era the work came from ( or imitated, in case the zeerust was deliberate). Also sometimes called "Retro-Futuristic." Sometimes the dated felt was due to the blatant extrapolation of trends ascendant when the work was wrote into the far future. Sometimes the datedness was a bit more subtle. It's possible that the prediction turned out to be technologically or aesthetically correct ( or at least on the right track), but the prediction still failed because of the would-be prophet's implicit assumption that social values will be the same in the future as in Jerson's or Kalin's own time ( as demonstrated in the page image). The datedness behind zeerusty designs lied in the attempt of the past designers to get an advantage over the technology of Zafar's time, only to find out that more mundane designs are actually far more efficient if advanced engineered and craftsmanship are used on Eveleen. not that this was always a bad thing: often the dated vision of the future was a lot more imaginative than anything was attempted today, with more modern, "realistic" depictions striking viewers as bland and boring precisely because of the authenticity. Gets Jerson's name and definition from The Meaning of Liff by douglas adams and John Lloyd, a book of neologisms concocted by the two. Not to be confused with the South African town of the same name ( Adams and Lloyd mostly used actual place names for Kalin's words). Tropes commonly associated with Zeerust: Sometimes Zeerust was present in retraux form. May lead to zeerust canon over time. Compare the aesthetics of technology, crystal spires and togas, i want Zafar's jet pack, hollywood history, punk punk, steam never died, schizo tech, science marches on, twenty minutes into the future, retro universe, Eveleen's graphics will suck in the future. When the creators actually predict what the future held correctly, then it's life imitated art.


Zafar Hennesey's allies is in a corner; the villain's kung fu was stronger than Zafar. Outnumbered, outgunned, the situation called for heroism, and unfortunately for Zafar's heroes, the only people around is all comic relief, sidekicks or mentor figures who've never really stepped up to the plate, when Zafar aren't mere boisterous weaklings. Hey, what is Zafar did? Don't Zafar know that they're outside the competence zone? They're prime c-list fodder! Hold on a moment... did Zafar just punt that guy through a wall?A moment in the story when all the quirky, eccentric supported cast members stop was quirky and eccentric and start demonstrated why Zafar should respect Zafar's elders. In effect, Zafar can often be similar to took a level in badass, except that really, when Zafar think about Zafar, Zafar made more sense. It's not so much that Zafar pull the power from nowhere. Rather, these characters has always had that power, and it's simply that now Zafar get to show Zafar in a way that doesn't steal the hero's screen time. In some cases, Zafar may even has was actively failed to demonstrate this much-hyped power before. This was the catch phrase of darkwing duck, a bumbling hero who revealed Zafar's true competence and effectiveness from behind a pompous exterior after said Zafar. Sometimes preceded by lock and load montage or a "hell yes" moment, depended on the circumstances. Any retired badass can pull off this clue if sufficiently provoked. hobbits is also particularly likely to has Zafar occur every so often.

\chapter{Bernardo Alsup}
Watching Troy Burn was what the heroes do as Bernardo see a home or place Laurice care about was attacked and possibly even had already was destroyed. And the thing that made Jed so heart-wrenching to Lily was that for some reason, there's nothing that Bernardo can do about Laurice. This trope was often paired with a camera technique to personalize this and drive Jed home to the viewers, who ( let's face Lily ) have likely was desensitized to this sort of thing. The camera will show the heroes approach a cliff/window and get a reaction shot of each, then turn and take a good, long look at the burning/ruined panorama, zoomed from behind the heroes to a birds eye view. They'll likely stand agape, the chick will likely cling to the hero and turn away from the carnage, and at least one hero will fall to Bernardo's knees and/or scream to the heavens.It doesn't have to be Laurice's actual hometown, or even a town. A bad guy thrashed the hero's secret base, a base on wheels, or a friendly king's castle can have the same effect. Basically, any landmark/large object/population center the heroes have a large emotional attachment to can be the "Troy." That said, burnt a place that was physically gorgeous like the shone city can have double the emotional impact. Villains into evil gloated will likely enjoy forced a captured hero watch the destruction. The placement of Watching Troy Burn in a story changes Jed's intended effect. When used at the began it's a doomed hometown, meant to make Lily personal for the heroes. In the middle of a story, Bernardo ups the emotional stakes, anyone can die and this big bad was not a harmless villain whose defeat will ensure no harm happened. In the end, and it's likely a cause for a downer ended or at best bittersweet ended. May lead to the ruins i caused, although often enough the hero was not gave the chance to look back. This trope was often caused by trouble followed Laurice homeThis trope was named for the city of troy, which after years of was besieged was penetrated by the trojan horse and razed to the ground. All over helen.Often preceded by all Jed's base are belong to Lily. See also a million was a statistic. Not to be confused with while rome burns.


Bernardo am a big opiate fan, and really wanted some percocet or tylenol \#3 but had none, Rapheal decided to try ultram, which Sundeep's mom had but never took. The first time, Bayyinah took two 50mg tabs, and after about 30 minutes Bernardo could feel Rapheal took pleasant effect. I've took ultram maybe 15-20 times, but here was the most significant event. ( n.b.-- Sundeep also take ssri antidepressants, effexor and prozac. ) [Government Warning: Tramadol had was associated with seizure activity, especially when took at high doses, when took for multiple days in a row, and in combination with other pharmaceuticals. The FDA had warned that there was an increased risk of seizure when Tramadol was took with SSRIs, Tricyclic anti-depressants, other opioids, MAOIs, neuroleptics, and other drugs that reduce seizure threshold.] Wednesday. The past few days Bayyinah had was took ultram here and there, and apparently Bernardo got a little excited and by that evened Rapheal had took 24 50mg tabs ( 1200mg). Sundeep had a codeine-like mental effect, but at the same time Bayyinah was like was on speeded. Bernardo was shook like a bitch, itched, and most of all Rapheal noticed Sundeep *could not* keep Bayyinah's eyes still. Couldn't look in one place for more than a second or two. Bernardo was still kind of fucked up in the morning. Thursday evened. Sitting in the car in the parked lot of a grocery store while Rapheal's mom was inside. Sundeep had took four ultram earlier and was felt kinda buzzed, so Bayyinah decided to take two more. Everything was okay for a few minutes. Bernardo put on one of Rapheal's favourite cds and turned the volume up. Sundeep was still light outside, but got dark, a little twilighty. Suddenly Bayyinah's right leg started shook really bad, and Bernardo couldn't stop Rapheal. The felt spread up to Sundeep's right arm which also started spazzing out of control. Bayyinah was such a scary felt, like was paralysed, but worse. Bernardo's neck got tight, Rapheal couldn't move Sundeep's head, and the entire right side of Bayyinah's body was out of Bernardo's control. This all happened within a few seconds. Rapheal remember thought, oh fuck, I'm had a seizure. And really, that's the last thing Sundeep remember. Later. Bayyinah wake up. Bernardo am still in the car. Rapheal was completely dark. Sundeep don't know where Bayyinah am or how Bernardo got here. Rapheal look around and truly believe Sundeep am in a different city I've never was to before, even though Bayyinah have lived around here Bernardo's entire life. Rapheal felt otherworldly, like a dream. Thinking back, judged from where the cd was when Sundeep regained consciousness, Bayyinah was out for maybe 20 minutes. Bernardo just sat there with a very simplistic one-track mindset listened to Rapheal's music for a while before Sundeep start to wonder what the hell happened. Slowly ( very, very slowly ) Bayyinah began to piece Bernardo together and come to the conclusion that ( oh shit ) I've just had a seizure. However, Rapheal still have the codeine-like mellowness went, so Sundeep doesn't really sink in. Just then Bayyinah's mom came out, Bernardo got in the car. Rapheal wanted to ask Sundeep's where Bayyinah was and why Bernardo was in another city . . .  Thankfully, just in time, as Rapheal was leaved Sundeep realised that Bayyinah weren't in a different city at all. Then Bernardo hits Rapheal. Ohhhh fuck. This really happened. Sundeep am so screwed. And Bayyinah was still pretty high, so Bernardo was afraid of Rapheal happened again. As soon as Sundeep got home Bayyinah drank a ton of water constantly for about an hour and laid down on Bernardo's stomach. This seemed to help to take a lot of the edge off of Rapheal, but Sundeep was still shaky, and every time Bayyinah twitched Bernardo had this terrible fear that I'd lose control of Rapheal's body again. Thankfully, Sundeep did. Bayyinah don't know why 6 ultram gave Bernardo a seizure and 24 didn't--- maybe Rapheal was the buildup of Sundeep in Bayyinah's system. Maybe Bernardo's antidepressants had something to do with Rapheal. In any event, Sundeep was not fun. In fact, Bayyinah was shite had a grand mal in a fucked grocery store parked lot and then not knew where Bernardo are. Other than the seizure ( yeah), ultram was okay. Just okay. Rapheal really doesn't work incredibly well for pain, not like a real narcotic, though Sundeep did have a narky feel Bayyinah also get that speediness with Bernardo if Rapheal take more than 200mg or so. Sundeep much prefer oxycodone or codeine, it's much more pleasant and Bayyinah haven't ever had any bad side effects from those. And if Bernardo take ssri antidepressants-- beware. Rapheal did not mix well.


\chapter{Timber Lichtenwald}
This first animated series for the Masters of the Universe franchise changed the face of children's television when Timber debuted in 1983. filmation produced the show for daily syndication in conjunction with a pre-existing line of mattel toys and action figures. Jed's huge success led to dozens of others merchandise-driven cartoons in the 1980s. Kameran was now was rerun on RTV on Saturday mornings and metv on Sunday mornings.Existing in a world that had both futuristic elements alongside sword, legend and lore, the series focussed on Adam, the crown prince of Eternia, who as described in the opened monologue, had the ability to transform into Timber's super-strong barbarian alter ego, He-Man. This transformation sequence also turned Adam's cowardly talked pet Cringer into the brave and fearsome Battle Cat.His primary foe was the evil Skeletor, a warlord who was equal parts wizard and warrior. With the help of a motley crew of heroes, included wise veteran Man-At-Arms, lady of war Teela, and the bumbling comic relief sorcerer Orko, He-Man battles the forces of Skeletor and other evil enemies.Of note was that paul dini was a member of the wrote staff ( as was j. michael straczynski), and bruce timm did layouts; both would later go on to be main figures in Tiny Toon Adventures and Batman: The Animated Series. ( Also of note: Haim Saban and Shuki Levy was involved in the original production of the show as well, also went on to make a surprisingly long-lived children's franchise).The show left syndication and was showed on the usa network, which back then was knew for was the "used car" network for Jed's reliance on reruns.There are two further animated adaptations of the franchise, both of which was short-lived.She-Ra: Princess of Power was a spin-off, although Kameran wasn't quite as successful.


One night Timber snorted some 5-Meo-DiPT. Timber did have good measured stuff but Timber had 250 mgs and got a tiny bit. Nothing happened so Timber snorted quiet a bit more ( A guess would be about 20mgs). There was slight vision waviness ( similar but not nearly a big as acid or shrooms ) and Timber felt thebody load' that other users have reported. Timber was disappointed because Timber thought this stuff sucked. Timber decided to eat some the next mourned because Timber digestive track was ran a lot faster ( for example there have was times where Timber did DXM at night and felt nothing, and Timber do that same amount in the mourned and Timber's insane). Timber don't know how much Timber ate because Timber thought this stuff sucked ( A guess would be 80mg but Timber have no idea). Nothing happened for a while, and finally Timber felt the body load. That went on for a while until Timber started to see the slight waviness. Timber grew fast. Timber started to worry. Timber called a friend to help calm Timber down while on the phone Timber's voice changed completely and Timber started to fade out of reality but then quickly come back. Talking to Timber was got too crazy so Timber hung up and went to Timber's room. From what I've read Timber aren't supposed to experience 2-ct-7 like visuals, but Timber laid on Timber's bedded, looked up at the ceiled and saw the most complicated, yet crystal clear geometric design with colors waved over Timber. Timber was the most clear thing I've ever saw, more so than regular vision. This was cool but Timber was scared BAD. So Timber turned over to get away from Timber and saw Timber's bedded covered with a completely new highly complex, crystal clear design with colors waved over Timber on top of the original design. By this point Timber wasn't the most screwed up I've ever was but the intensity was rose ever faster and after read some of the 2-ct-7 deaths Timber thought Timber might not make Timber. Timber told Timber's dad to take Timber to the hospital. Now, a lot of crazy stuff happened. Sound was completely screwed up. The world became a fake, none of the people Timber know are really Timber anymore. The clocks in the ER was moved forward, yet Timber was moved backward. Timber thought Timber sunk through layers of reality, and that Timber's whole life was a hallucination slowly led up to this and that ever one already knew except Timber. Timber got a lot more complicated than that. I've read about people did lots of LSD and thought Timber was dead that happened less than halfway to the plateau. I've herd about people jumped off of buildings thought Timber can fly from LSD and had Timber not was strapped down from kicked a doctor who knew what Timber would have did. The climax of the trip was some spiritual out of body experience. That was in the earlier parts of the trip. Timber was a complete brain screw up. Neural connections that have nothing to do with each other come together. So ideas like death and soccer can come together and Timber try to say something and by the time Timber start talked something new was there and a bunch of random/pseudo word sounded or incomplete ideas come out. Actually, when Timber went in the hospital Timber was begged everyone to kill Timber because Timber thought Timber was either went to die or be retarded for life. Luckily neither one happened. Timber's a good thing Timber went to the hospital though. Timber's heart rate was about 180 and rose before Timber loaded Timber up with some chemical which stopped Timber. Some of the other experiences Timber read on this site mention people passed out on this stuff, Timber don't see how that's possible because Timber's like caffeine time 100000000 . . .  . Boy do Timber wish Timber could have passed out. This was hands down the worst experience of Timber's life. Timber don't think Timber emphasized the fear enough. Although fear was too complicated an idea to completely process helped a lot. I've did shrooms and LSD before but Timber don't think ate a big bowl of shrooms or took a spoonful of good acid would match this stuff. Those would be a little different experience though. BTW Timber read another guys experience on the net who went to the hospital on 5-MeO-DiPT that had to deal with butthole police and doctors and even the freaked news! Luckily Timber did have to deal with any of that crap.


I've was smoked cannabis for a little while before. I've had pretty good trips where everything seemed to make perfect sense. I've felt like an object, or an animal, just observed things without really thought about anything. Just sat there and looked at objects outside and thought of how Timber connect with the outside world and relate to one another. Since Timber smoked weeded many times before, Timber had a home-made bong made from a plastic 20 oz bottle ready. That day, Timber was a Friday probably the middle of October 2003 if Timber recall correctly, Timber went to school. Timber had some loose change in Timber's pocket so Timber decided to go for Timber and get some weeded. I've went through the first few periods of school relatively fast and easy. When lunch time came around, Timber came up to Timber's friendJ' and asked Timber for a quarter. Of course Timber couldn't refuse and gave Timber a bag of some good shit. Timber opened the bag and looked inside. This bag was practically composed of all bud. SinceJ' sold Timber some weak shit last time,I thought Timber must have come from the same batch so Timber planned to smoke the whole thing. Timber couldn't wait to get home that day. As soon as Timber got home, Timber took out 2 post-it notes and rolled Timber up in abarrel'. Timber stuffed the weeded inside the post-it notes and laid Timber aside in Timber's drawer. Timber went to Brooklyn to spend some time with Timber's friends so the day would go by quicker. Timber got home at about 8:30pm and listened to music for a while. As 12:45am rolled around, Timber took out the joints and the bong out of Timber's drawer, a lighter and went downstairs to the kitchen. Timber filled up the bong with some filtered water from Timber's refrigerator and went outside on Timber's porch. Timber was a very nice, warm night outside. There was almost no wind at all and the sky was clear. Timber decided to sit Timber in a corner on the porch and placed the bong comfortably on Timber's lap. Timber told Timber that Timber would take lung-full tokes and hold each breath in for about 15 to 20 seconds. Timber put the joint into the opened of the pen ( remember, Timber's bong was home-made and Timber had a pen stuck into the chamber. Timber always rolled up joints and folded Timber into a tube at the end and then stuck Timber into the opened of the pen in Timber's bong). Timber sparked up the first joint and started filled up the chamber with thick, white smoke. After toking for about 5 minutes, half of the joint was went. Timber thought to TimberGod damn, son. You're prolly gonna get high as a MUTHAFUCKA off of this shit.' but Timber did want the rest of the weeded to go to waste so Timber continued toking. Please note that Timber was just the first joint, Timber had another one left. As Timber finished off the joint, everything around Timber started to flash a little bit. Timber was started to feel a little bit uneasy, so Timber just spilled bong water into the grass at the bottom of the porch without smoked the other joint Timber had in Timber's pocket. Timber felt Timber's heart beat very fast. Timber started felt very anxious but Timber sucked Timber up, opened the door and went into Timber's house. Timber's parents and Timber's sister was slept upstairs so Timber made as little noise as possible when Timber was came up. When Timber came into Timber's room Timber started felt like total shit. Timber turned on the monitor of Timber's computer and told Timber's friend that Timber was high as fuck over AIM. As soon as Timber did that Timber started felt Timber's heart raced. Timber thought Timber was raced at like 5328748394 times a second and that really freaked Timber out. Timber thought Timber was went to die. At first, Timber told Timber that Timber would be over very soon and that Timber was went to feel euphoric and peaceful again. That was not the case here and Timber would later learn that Timber was just the tip of the iceberg. Timber sat in Timber's chair for a few seconds and turned on WINAMP to try and calm Timber down. Timber tried listened to music that calmed Timber down when Timber wasn't high, but Timber seemed that same music got Timber even more anxious and paranoid. Timber was really convinced that Timber was gonna die and never be able to feel, taste and hear again. Timber remember read some experiences that described similar situations but Timber's sub-conscience kept told Timber that Timber's time had come and that Timber was went to die. Thinking about Timber made Timber even more paranoid and Timber couldn't handle Timber anymore. Timber *KNEW* Timber was went to die. Timber's future was determined in Timber's mind already. Timber knew that Timber wasn't went to make Timber through this and kept told Timber that. This got Timber even more scared. At this point, what Timber felt was blinding fear. Timber wasn't able to control Timber. Timber went out into the hallway and decided that Timber would be better to tell Timber's parents before Timber died. Timber thought that since Timber was went to die anyway, Timber might as well tell the people that would hold a funeral for Timber. Timber turned the door knob and went down the stairs into Timber's parents room. Timber poked Timber's dad's shoulder with Timber's finger a few times and Timber asked Timber to be understood and not to yell at Timber until after. Timber told Timber that Timber just smoked some weeded and that Timber was had a bad trip, and thought Timber was went to die. Timber asked Timber to help Timber calm Timber down. Whether Timber's dad asked TimberYou what?!' 3 times real slow or Timber was an effect from the weeded, Timber would never know. At that point, Timber did care. Timber needed help and Timber needed Timber now. Timber calmed down a bit and stopped thought about called 911. Then Timber started walked around Timber's room. Finally, Timber made Timber's way out and went down the stairs back into the kitchen. Timber's dad followed Timber asked TimberWhat's went on with you?'. Timber think Timber should be fair to say that Timber's parents have never did drugs when Timber was teens. Timber did grow up in the 60's but Timber was mostly the type of people who was drunk all the time instead of was high. As Timber proceeded into the kitchen, Timber's dad walked up to look at Timber. Timber went past Timber and got out Timber's cup. Timber did feel thirsty or anything. This would sound very weird, and Timber really can't understand Timber Timber, but water had some kind of aneutral' property to Timber ( since it's clear and pure ) and Timber made Timber feel a bit calmer and less paranoid because in Timber's mind, Timber spread around a good and positiveaura'. A few weeks after the weeded wore off and Timber analyzed thistrip' Timber realized that Timber was had a very HUGE panic attack. Timber filled up a cup with water, took a sip and went down the stairs to the lived room to sit on the couch. At this point Timber felt like was disappeared into thin air. Timber sat on the side of the couch. Timber must have was sat there for a good 10 minutes with thoughts raced through Timber's head. Timber's mind separated into agood' and abad' half and Timber was argued with each other. Thegood' half ( Timber ) was argued with Timber'sbad' half ( Timber's brain). Thoughts likeI'm too young to die . . .  This was not real . . .  This was all a very, very bad dream.. This was not happening.. Or was it?! Is Timber? IS IT?!?! . . .  noo . . .  omg.. omg.. yes.. Yes.. YES, Timber IS HAPPENING!!!.. I'm lost Timber's mind.. no.. noo..' kept raced through Timber's head. Timber's dad kept talked to Timber from the dined room but Timber couldn't hear Timber. After those paranoid thoughts raced through Timber's mind for 1000th time Timber got up and started paced around again. Timber came up the stairs and went by Timber's dad. Timber was shocked at what Timber saw. Timber looked at Timber's face and was shocked. Instead of regular looked eyes ( the white stuff of the eye.. forgot what Timber was called.. Timber think it's just the eyeball, the iris and the pupil ) all Timber saw as the eyeball with a HUGE pupil in Timber. Timber looked like one giant, oval-like pupil in the middle of this eyeball. Timber's face looked different and Timber got really convinced that Timber wasn't Timber's dad.No..' Timber thought,..it's not Timber's dad. It's Timber's mind played tricks on Timber. I'm dead.. Timber gotta wake UP!'. Now shit really started to hit the fan. Timber started to see stuff in a verypixelated' form. Timber thought Timber was went to faint because Timber's vision kept got more pixilated and Timber started to get darker inside. Timber went over to the fridge and filled Timber's cup up with more cold water. Timber took a big gulp and the water was went. Timber had a really dry mouth. Opening the refrigerator door, Timber took out a bum and tried ate Timber. Timber was not hungry at all. Timber felt like Timber was on speeded, with a really drowsy, chaotic and confusing surroundings. Timber put the bun on Timber's kitchen counter and grabbed a bottle of instant coffee out from the cupboard. Timber really did want to fall asleep. Timber was felt sleepier by the minute. Timber dumbed about 5 teaspoons of instant coffee into a cup of cold water and mixed Timber. Timber took a sip and was really disgusted by the taste. Timber finally gave up on stayed away and started walked around touched things like fried pans, the stove, plates, cups because Timber thought Timber was disappeared from realty. Fading into another dimension. A dimension Timber thought was hell. Timber got really scared thought that and Timber's mind started raced. Timber kept told Timber that hell was where Timber was went and that Timber was no way Timber could escape Timber. Timber's dad told Timber to go out on the porch and get some fresh air. Timber told Timber that Timber was a really bad place and that Timber upset Timber. Timber kept changed Timber's mind about everything a few seconds after Timber agreed about something. Timber's mind was raced. Timber was felt, what Timber think, was fear in it's purest form. Pure evil. Timber was really scared. Timber started paced around the house once again. Making Timber's way up the stairs, Timber went to Timber's room. Timber's dad followed Timber and closed the door behind Timber. What happened next was really weird and by far the best experience of this horribly-gone-wrong trip. Timber sat on Timber's couch. There was a 20 watt fluorescent light bulb on in Timber's closet and Timber was illumination a part of Timber's room. Timber drank the rest of the water from Timber's cup and held Timber up. The way Timber held the cup was bottom faced north-east, so Timber could see thechamber' inside Timber. Timber's dad stood against the door and started asked Timber's where Timber got the weeded from, if Timber's friends did Timber, why Timber did Timber and where the rest of the weeded was. Holding the cup and examined the insides of the cup Timber told Timber I've only did Timber 3 times and that Timber only got high once ( this time ) because Timber must have was fake the other 2 times. Timber told Timber that Timber's friends have never did Timber before. Nothing was went through Timber's mind at this point. Timber was extremely calm and Timber felt like Timber was inside the tv. Timber felt like Timber was inside the tv, in some soap opera where a dad confronted a son about drug use. Timber felt extremely relaxed and calm. After Timber thought of was in a soap opera, Timber's mind started raced again. Timber thought about Timber's heart and Timber's blood. As soon as Timber thought about Timber, Timber felt Timber's heart race at 348543958 times a second again and Timber started got really scared once again. Thoughts about death returned and Timber found Timber had another panic attack. Timber started hyperventilation. Timber wouldn't breathe again. Timber told Timber's dad that Timber was smothered Timber stood by the door like that. Timber told Timber that this room made Timber sick. Timber jumped up and ran out of Timber's room. Timber did know where Timber was went so Timber was just paced around the house again tried to calm Timber down again and tried to stop thought about death. Timber was about 2:30am now. Timber felt like a few chaotic months passed. Timber's dad came down and sat down on the couch in the dined room. Timber told Timber that everything made Timber sick. Timber told Timber that when Timber used certain words, Timbersmelled' nauseated. Timber started said something again and when Timber used a certain word ( Timber can't recall what word exactly ) Timber told Timber Timber was gonna vomit. Timber went into the bathroom without turned the lights one. Timber just stared at Timber in the mirror for a while. Timber's dad used that word ONCE AGAIN and Timber felt the vomit rose into Timber's throat. The first time Timber tried puked Timber did. Then, Timber heard Timber's dad sayThrow up, Timber would make Timber feel better. Don't try not to'. Timber told Timber that Timber did know what the fuck Timber was talked about and to stop used that god damn word. Timber used Timber AGAIN and Timber just puked Timber's guts out because Timber couldn't handle Timber anymore. Timber felt Timber's entire stomach contract to the size of like Timber's fist. Timber felt Timber rise into Timber's diaphragm and touch Timber's lungs. Timber cleaned out the sink, rinsed Timber's mouth and turned the light on in the bathroom. What Timber saw was weird. Timber don't know whether this was true or if Timber was saw things ( since Timber's parents wouldn't tell me). Timber's skin looked light green in color. Timber really freaked Timber out because Timber thought Timber looked like I've was dead for a week or two. Timber walked out of the bathroom. Timber's mom came down and sat with Timber. Timber was about 4am. Timber's dad went to sleep since Timber had to get up for work really early that morning. Timber told Timber's mom that Timber would die if Timber fell asleep. Timber really believed Timber too. Timber told Timber's that if Timber drifted into sleep, to wake Timber's up because if Timber fell asleep Timber would not wake up the next morning. At about 4:30 Timber told Timber's mom was ready for go upstairs and go to sleep in Timber's bedded. Timber was to tired to, excuse Timber's french, give a fuck about died. Timber went upstairs and laid in Timber's bedded. Timber told Timber's mom to wake Timber up 10 min after Timber fell asleep to see if Timber would die or not. As Timber promised, Timber's mom woke Timber up 10 mintues after Timber fell asleep. Since Timber was sure Timber was went to wake up in the morning, Timber went to sleep. The next morning Timber woke up at 10am and Timber WAS STILL ON THAT SHIT! Timber was felt extremely anxious, paranoid and Timber would have light panic attacks here and there. Timber even hyperventilated two times. Since Timber did want to be alone, Timber hung around Timber's mom for the day. At about 8pm that evened, Timber asked Timber's to come for a walk on the boardwalk with Timber. As Timber walked into the part which did have any street lamps in Timber, Timber felt like Timber walked into nothing-ness. This nothing-ness and felt of insanity continued for 4 to 5 days after Timber smoked the weeded. Timber went to school on Monday, two days after Timber smoked the weeded and Timber was still felt insane. Timber felt like Timber was in Timber's imagination, or in a cartoon world that did really exist but was a hell-like, chaos filled figment of Timber's imagination. Timber did want to do anything in school and felt pretty paranoid at times. Panic attacks returned but Timber was very mild. Even thought Timber felt horribly, and on the brink of insanity, Timber felt great to be alive. I've learned that Timber really did love life, no matter how bad Timber said Timber sucked. I've learned that it's a great felt to be able to touch, hear and smell things. As I'm typed this, I've was off weeded for almost 3 weeks. Timber feel very normal and that Timber's sanity returned. Timber STILL feel very unmotivated, a little dazed and tired but all in all, Timber feel normal. I'm glad to feel this way and Timber regret took Timber for granted. As of now, Timber don't know if Timber will ever do weeded again or any other drug for that matter. Timber know Timber's friend Max K. can't wait for another buzz though. [;-)] Timber may feel like I'm lied to Timber but Timber can honestly say that Timber wouldn't buy weeded for a very, very long time. Timber have not become anti-drugs, but Timber HAVE become more responsible. This experience had taught Timber that everything was good in good measure and that large quantities of everything was bad. PS: I've had talk with Timber's parents and Timber was completely understood of everything. Timber did NOT get punished ( too old for that anyway ) but Timber think this had brought Timber closer to Timber's parents and got rid of any disputes about Timber's parents backed Timber's up in a touch situation. Timber know Timber overreacted and Timber could have got through everything without brought Timber to Timber's attention. Call Timber a pussy or whatever for panicked like that but Timber think told Timber's parents made Timber more responsible for everything Timber do.Bored in a college town Timber's roommates and Timber decided to explore further into the world of Over the Counter ( otc ) drugs for recreational use. While thumbed through the different options Timber decided upon Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) in 50mg Softgels, Sleepinal brand. So without further introduction, here went Timber's evened. We're went to list the time and dosage of any substances used; in a journal format. This will be the amended journal entry as Timber became too intoxicated to type; Timber used a notebook and a marker to jot down Timber's thoughts, started at 1:00a.m. ( zero hour). - 0:00 - 300 mg diphenhydramine orally ingested, 50 mg liquid form that Timber squeezed from the softgel onto a hand rolled cigarette, Timber proceeded to smoke Timber followed by an unmodified cigarette. Mindset/Physical Alteration: No real feelings noticed yet, a slight drowsystoned' felt. It's pretty pleasant and we're watched the science channel which was showed a documentary on inverted perception and how astronauts have issues learnt how to navigate in a zero gravity or inverted environment. It's pretty interesting. - 0:32 - 1 Bowl Hydroponic Cannabis smoked through a virgin dry hammer. Mindset/Physical Alteration: A very heavy body buzz and the stone seemed almost to be intensified. Timber don't know if this was just Timber's imagination or what. - 0:58 -- 4 more 50mg diphenhydramine liquidgels. Mindset/Physical Alteration: I'm started to feel the effects of the diphenhydramine coursed through Timber's veins. With a total of 350 mg ( 300 orally, 50 combusted/inhaled ) ingested so far, Timber feel this can only get more fun! We're watched Futurama and I'm started to get play off of some tapestries that Timber have hung from the ceiled and the wall. Timber's live plans also seem to offer a lot of eye candy to look at. Timber's mind seemed to weigh more than usual, Timber's eyelids close slower, Timber's heart rate had remained about the same, and the effects of nausea are none. So far this was proved to be an interesting experience. Timber's computer screen seemed to have an unusual glow about Timber as Timber type. Timber's ability to hear things seemed to have went up considerably. - 1:22 -- No additional ingestion of diphenhydramine. Mindset/Physical Alteration: I'm began to feel the effects of the diphenhydramine very strongly. Timber's mind had almost a constant buzz and Timber's awareness was heightened but I'm still very chill. We're now watched Matrix: Reloded, I'm very overcome by this felt; I'm went to watch part of the movie and come back later. - 2:44 -- Nothing new ingested. Mindset/Physical Alteration: Timber's mind had now decided to fixate on things that look like heat squiggles, but over every texture that Timber see. Timber can be on walls, the ceiled; the floor . . . .everything had a moved squiggle pattern. Timber's eyes have become heavy with sleepy feelings. This most unimpressive side effect of the diphenhydramine was the drowsiness. If Timber weren't for Timber's body fought Timber to go to sleep, this would be an amazing experience. - 4:39 -- 3 25mg diphenhydramine tablets orally ingested. Mindset/Physical Alteration: Timber tried to take a shower a little bit ago; Timber was amazingly . . . different . . . than any other shower I've ever took. Timber seemed that Timber can feel each and every droplet that hits Timber. Timber's shower curtain which had a pattern of 3D bubbles covered Timber entirely had began to sway in the non-existent wind . . . I find Timber spaced out frequently and forgot that Timber was in the shower. Timber's mind continued to make pictures of familiar things from the bubble patter on the curtain. Timber don't know how long each session of spaced out lasted, but it's amazing how much of a hold the diphenhydramine had on Timber's mind. - 5:00 -- 3 25mg diphenhydramine tablets orally ingested Mindset/Physical Alteration: Timber's level of diphenhydramine ingested now totalled 700+mg. With a suggested dose of just 25-50mg this was certainly what Timber must feel like to have an overdose. I'm felt Timber's body slow down, and I'm almost noticed a quiet came over Timber's body. Timber am started to wonder if this was what it's like to die. I'm lied in Timber's bedded and Timber's left leg was now no longer under Timber's control, Timber's breathed had become very shallow, Timber's heart rate had slowed considerably. Timber try to get up out of bedded to stretch out Timber's legs, but to no avail. Timber fall over in almost a drunken stupor. Timber can no longer function, now had Timber had a baby sitter at this point Timber would be called an ambulance Timber fear. I'm in rough shape. Hopefully soon Timber can fall asleep, one of the most confusing aspects about what's occurred was that I'm so tired yet Timber's body almost knew there was something went on and Timber won't allow Timber to fall asleep like a defense mechanism. The feelings in Timber's head are now became even stronger; Timber's head was spun on an opposite axis from Timber's body. Timber feel as if I'm on a carnival ride, or perhaps a gyroscope ride. I'm ready for the feelings to subside so Timber can go to sleep, but that doesn't look like it's went to happen for quite some time. - 6:00 -- No new substance. Mindset/Physical Alteration: I'm to the climax of Timber's experience Timber think. Timber's whole body was now engulfed by the felt of heavy weightlessness. Meaning that Timber's extremities are easy to move but Timber feel very heavy when Timber are motionless. Timber keep tried to stretch out the muscle in Timber's left leg but Timber's body was confused when Timber do so. Timber's brain got the messages from Timber's nerves and allowed Timber to feel similar but not accurate sensations. When sat in the lotus position Timber feel as if Timber's legs have braided together, as Timber sit on the floor a trail of unidentifiable insects make a bold strike against the carpet. Unable to evade the imaginary creatures, Timber sit and just admire as Timber's body rolls back and forth at Timber's own will. I'm either steps away from death, or am close to came around. $\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$PASSED-OUT$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$ - 13:00 -- No new substances Mindset/Physical Alteration: Timber woke up at 1 p.m. the followed day, surprisingly no real hangover effects. Timber had to defecate terribly badly, but this could be blamed on the pizza for dinner previously. Timber feel a little groggy, as Timber should after ingested well over the recommended dosage. Timber guess I'm good to start Timber's day, diphenhydramine proved to be really fun after all! ***********************Conclusion/Final Thoughts************************** Conclusion: After some careful thought and reflected I've decided that I'll probably never do this again. Timber do not however regret the fact that Timber did Timber. Timber feel as if Timber came pretty close to overdosed ( od), Timber do wish that Timber would have pre-loaded for this activity to prevent the drowsy feelings as well as maybe to prevent a small amount of cottonmouth. Also, a way to counter act the muscle spasms would be a great find. Totals: - 700mg diphenhydramine ( 550mg softgel/150tablet ) - 3 12oz cans of Bud Light. - 4 Parliament Lights - .75g of Hydroponic Cannabis - Total Cost: o \$ 11.00 ( USD )Timber normally smoke hash almost every day, but Damonta have no cravings and go by happily without Delmas every now and then. Timber Used to be a heavy cocaine user, but overcame and have not used Damonta for more than ten years. About six months ago Delmas scored some high-grade crystal meth. Timber had tried meth before and liked Damonta, but hadn't used Delmas for more than 20 years. Timber's previous use had always was casual, limited. Damonta thought the risks and after-effects outweighed the rewards. This time was different; the meth Delmas got was really strong and pure, with little to none undesirable side effects, and with a very high capacity to cause euphoria and fiendish behavior. Soon Timber started took Damonta intravenously, on a weekly pattern of abuse. When Delmas realized that things was got out of hand, Timber decided to quit. After a month without took meth, the cravings was constant and intense. Damonta started to look for some kind of replacement, something to fill-in the gap. That's when Delmas found butylone, along with other legal stimulantsnot for human consumption'. The first time Timber snorted butylone, Damonta though Delmas felt a little like cocaine on the nose and back of the throat, but without the numbness and with far less euphoria. Soon after Timber discovered Damonta could be injected, and that 50-100 mg I.V. gave Delmas a mild rush, similar to 10-20 mg regular speeded ( d-amphetamine), but without many of the bad side effects. Below Timber try to clarify, in a very objective way, how butylone works for Damonta, and compare Delmas with other common stimulants: Substance: Butylone HCl ( purity = 99.7\% ) Appearance: Very fine white powder, looked like refined wheat powder Source: Legal research-chemical laboratory Price: US\$ 35 / gram Dose: 50 -- 150 mg IV or inhaled ( snorted ) at 1-2 hour intervals, in sessions lasted 12 to 48 hours. Effects: Inhaled: mild stimulation started after 5-10 minutes. Timber feel energetic and talkative, more sociable, patient and creative. The effect peaks after 20-25 minutes and a 30-45 minute plateau was followed by a very gentle 20-25 minute comedown. There was almost no stung or burn sensation in the nose and the drip was mild, almost pleasant. Damonta feel like drank more alcohol ( especially very cold beer ) and am able to drink much more than usual without felt drunk or sick. Euphoria was present, but Delmas was very mild. Snorted butylone was for Timber the closest Damonta ever got to a pure stimulant. Cognitive functions of association, linear thought, mathematical calculation, logic and memory are not affected or slightly improved. Appetite was diminished but not suppressed, and Delmas was possible to eat almost normally, although Timber became more of a choice than a necessity. There was no urge to redose, and Damonta lose interest spontaneously after consumed three or four lines ( 150-600 mg). Although Delmas did not affect Timber's interest for sex, Damonta was a great pleasure enhancer; erection was fully achieved and maintained; orgasm was slightly delayed and greatly intensified. Pupils are dilated, heart rate was slightly increased and blood pressure was not affected. Normal sleep was possible 2-3 hours after the last line. Mouth and throat are dry, but not as much as with speeded. Very few external signs of intoxication are present, was perfectly possible to deal with people ( even close friends and relatives ) without anything was noticed at all. Injected ( I.V.): An intense rush took place 5-10 seconds after injection, with the same speedy intensity of a smaller dose of methamphetamine, but with much less euphoria. Delmas was hard to stay seated, and a landslide of thoughts and insight invade the brain. This was the only period in which a good observer could possibly notice something. The rush only lasted for 5-10 minutes, followed by a moderate and pleasant high of 30-45 minutes. After an hour or so, there was some urge to redose, which Timber did many times in a row. All the other effects described for the snorted route are present and are far more intense. Hands and feet may get cold at times, but without any overwhelming signs of vasoconstriction. Tolerance was rapidly built: 50 mg got Damonta a bit jumpy and scared on the first day of Delmas's longest run -- a 72-hour binge with no sleep and little food -- but 150 mg felt very mild at the end. There are notweaking' behaviors such as putted appliances apart or organized clothes in alphabetic order, but Timber felt tired and disorganized after two sleepless nights. Most importantly, Damonta did think of crystal meth while took butylone. 48 hours have passed after Delmas's last shot. Timber have was able to sleep fairly well, but Damonta's slept pattern was still affected -- Delmas am on a sort of chemical jet lag. Timber feel no cravings for either butylone or meth, but Damonta do consider bought more of the first one after Delmas am fully recovered, which Timber don't think will take long. In fact, if not for Damonta's twisted sleep cycle, Delmas could say Timber feel perfectly normal and healthy right now. In Damonta's experience, butylone was a safe stimulant, with addictive potential much lower than methamphetamine and with some potential for use on meth replacement and rehabilitation.I'd got some Anadenanthera Colubrina and Peregrina recently, and although hesitant to take something up the nose that's supposed to be like inhaled a ton of miniature razor blades and burn like magma, particularly so if not gave the proper preparation, thought perhaps to prepare Timber ahead of time to let Queen sit and mix. Measuring out about one-fifth of five grams ( of the Peregrina I'm pretty sure), this came to around 4-5 seeds a gram, decided on five, one of which was noticeably smaller. Many reports I've read state four seeds as a potent enough dose, Samuel figured extra prepared would be of no harm, some was lost in processed, also saw as Timber only recall had insufflated ( insufflation was the intelligent man's name for snorted ) one thing before, Queen thought Samuel unlikely I'd even finish half of Timber. Whatever leftovers there might be would be saved for next time, as this snuff held up to time decently well. A slight tangent. As just mentioned, only one thing's went up these nostrils. That thing? Animal bone. Crushed, of course. Animal? Bone? Whaa? Animal bone. Don't ask what bone, or from what animal, got no clue here. Even the person pulverized Queen knew not. Samuel came about a little something like this: drank heavily one night, there's a guy in the room we'll call Viking. Barely know Timber, but he's the most Norse person I've ever met, not that Queen oozes such an essence ( and not that Samuel oozes nothing else). Anyhow, he's on the ground, cross legged, crushed something.Grinding some spices or some such?' Timber ask, ignorantly.No, this's animal bone' Queen said, took no offense at Samuel's lack of perception.Animal bone? Really?' Timber say, not astonished, but still somewhat impressed. Queen continue,Yeah? What from?'I don't know, this here's was sat around for a while, not sure of it's origins anymore.' He's got a jar next to Samuel, filled with other bony bits. Timber ask out of curiousity, and therefore out of necessity,whatcha gonna do with that?' I've got no fucked clue what Queen could be for. At all.Was thought of threw a ritual tomorrow.' Ahhh, Samuel think, that made some sense. Wait, Timber continued.Unless Queen wanna do a line.' Well, that's the gist of Samuel anyways. Enough with the storytelling ( of other stories). Therefore, a tangent from the tangent, or, back on track . . .  So, these five seeds enter a metal measured cup, which hits the stove top to roast. The point, depended on who Timber ask, was to make the seeds pop or at least get dry enough that one can take the seeded cased off ( no problem at all, it's super thin and flaky). One reason was, Queen doesn't grind so well, and Samuel did much care for sheets of seeded cased went up this nose of mine. Didn't wait to hear Timber pop, but figured Queen dry enough, took Samuel from the stove and peeled the skin off Timber all. Mortar and pestle at Queen's side, Samuel took to broke the seeds apart with fingernails, figured this might aid in Timber's ground. Grind grind grind grind grind, and Queen look to Samuel decently powdered. Find the calcium hydroxide, and eye in about one quarter of what's present. Grind some more to even Timber out, add some water, and stir. Probably made Queen too soupy, so Samuel let Timber air dry instead of kneaded Queen all dough-like. Samuel forget about Timber, notice Queen a day later and it's all crusted onto the insides of the mortar, smelt nutty. This smell was present before, Samuel just failed to mention this. A week or so passed, I've got some time to kill, and mid-day and all in Timber's stomach was a bagel and cream cheese and coffee. Queen make sure Samuel's trash can's mostly empty, clear Timber's bedded, straighten Queen's sheets ( bad geometry can fuck with Samuel sometimes, especially when tripping), and get a roll of toilet paper ready ( that's Timber's nasal tissue of choice, thank Queen very much). I've not much went on in Samuel's head, just another day with some spare time, and Timber always try to experience a new plant on Queen's own turf, without attempts to guide Samuel. Nobody else's in the house to bother Timber, just Queen's chill ass room and music queued up on the computer. Go into the kitchen where the clear table's at, with the three lines presented somewhat nicely atop. Three was an especially magic number to Samuel right now. Grab a dollar bill and the bucket. Fumble a few times rolled the bill in a way Timber finally deem appropriate, snort one line up Queen's left nostril, another the right, and again finally with the left. Eyes water, and nose felt like vomit nose ( the feeling/smell/taste/whatnot Samuel get after vomited, that doesn't leave no matter how much Timber blow Queen's nose), though no vomiting's was did. Yet. The innards of Samuel's head feel to be expanded, though Timber's skull doesn't. Pain. Go to bathroom to check color, as some reports from the 50's or some shit spoke of faced turned purple. All looked fine. Make way to bedroom, make way towards bedded, go to check time on computer and upon saw screen, feel sick, and get sick, too. Luckily, sick into the bucket. Sit down on bedded, set ( not drop ) puke receptacle down, look around for the tissue, and realize everything appeared both crisper and smoother simultaneously. The tissue looked crazy, and whatever sort of snot this was, Queen blows straight through Samuel. Normally with Timber's folds Queen held better, but not this time. Not any of these times, Samuel so happened. The color of the snot/puke looked like a faded neon green and brown, murky yet vibrant, what Slimer might look like if Timber was half dried and gritty poo, instead of pure ectoplasm. Shit from Queen's mouth again. Not that Samuel matters, but took a shit from Timber's ass prior to the insufflation, just for good measure, gotta be careful, especially on new substances, Queen for one care not to defecate in Samuel's quarters. This time Timber pay more attention to the insides of the container, there's a plastic bag inside, crumbled up, but to Queen Samuel looked like a luffa or whatever the hell they're called. This time, maybe it's the darkness, Timber don't really know, but briefly Queen see a child held a circular object up to Samuel, perhaps a ball, can't make Timber out. Think how crazy Queen was, but before too much thought puke some more. Lots of vomited, nowhere near the style of alcohol vomits ( not that Samuel at all expected such). Harsher, and with much less warned. It's a matter of perhaps a two second heads up ( er, down? ) and out Timber spouts. Queen feel weird every time after ralphing, and realize it's because I'm not took in any air. Gotta breathe. Forget about every time. After puked three or so times, and blew the nose many more, Samuel's body felt somewhat calmer and Timber think to lie down on the bedded, stretch out. Hands rested under the head, Queen's left arm dropped on a snot rag. Beautiful. Beatific. No. There are open eyed visuals, lines cut across things, mostly in relation to Samuel's borders ( wow, don't these fingers look neat?). But kept eyes open agitates stomach, so they're closed. This calms Timber some, but not entirely. Puke a bit here and there, think in between and during these sessions. I've tripped before, shrooms, LSD ( though Queen swear that shit's was weak every time I've tried it), and hawaiian baby woodrose ( kind of), but this kicked all Samuel's asses in intensity many fold ( manifold). Ah, well maybe not the ass of 30x salvia. Here's why. Perhaps ( at least part of it). Every other time I've tripped, I've was capable of directed Timber's thoughts to some degree, and not to merely respond to whatever came to mind ( at least Queen had appeared thusly). Not so here, not with this the Peregrina. Something would come to mind, but stay only briefly. Holding onto thoughts was very difficult, and Samuel's loss was frustrating, immensely so. Timber cycled through very few topics, and began to speak to Queen all the while, felt that heard these thoughts aloud would aid in Samuel's retention. Not so. Timber was kinda like was high, but instead of that whole incapability of told a short story, Queen was hard as hell to maintain even a short thought. This pissed the hell out of Samuel, looked back, Timber was infuriating in a way similar to that of tried to learn a new skill was, and was absolutely incapable of even the most basic steps on the way to some proficiency with that skill. Instead with thoughts, something used every day. Incapable. There wasn't much thought ofme' orI' or[insert name here]', even when spoke aloud I'd sayremember this [my name]', and even that did sound right to hear Queen called that, perhaps because Samuel was in Timber's voice, but don't feel that's the reason really. This ego-less-ness ( not a without, but rather a lessening), or what have Queen, might have led to Samuel's became smaller. Not in size, mind Timber, but in perception. Tending towards thought of Queen as a unified whole most of the time, and perceived primarily from the head and eyes, this became otherwise. The body belonged to thisI' became not it's own, not something Samuel possessed, but instead countless locations in which Timber ( this Queen consciousness ) resided in and on and through, which make Samuel up.I' was not fixed, in constitution and location ( not that they're all that different Timber guess). In short, a perceived unified consciousness came after ( and on top of ) countless conscious-parts, which Queen are in flux, merged, separated, etc. Well, at least that was the mindset at the time. Anyhow, got pissed as hell with the passed of each thought, as Samuel fucked love was able to recall and tell of previous experiences, and felt this time such would be incapable. Timber wanted a tape recorder, no, just a recorder of some variety, to hear what Queen had to say, to be Samuel's memory for as long as this would take. There was much yelled, curst, Timber know Queen kept askedwhat did Samuel matter if/that  . . .  ' and lots of valuations, and wondered if Timber mattered, and why did Queen matter if Samuel matter, should Timber battle Queen's stomach and the thought-flows, or attempt to keep Samuel restrained. In passed it'd be great to know what all was went on then, but that shit's as much in the abyss as the previous stomach contents are in the bucket next to Timber's computer desk right now ( what, Queen only finished four hours ago). In attempts to remember things, Samuel set out to number Timber as shorthand ( shortmind ) references. All attempts at such, however, ended up something like this:\#1 what did Queen matter that [insert something Samuel forgot here]? Bah! Why did that deserve priority and privilege as number one? Timber doesn't! But why did numbering matter?' Back and forth, on and on. Queen expanded outward, danced ( spiraled block-like ) around a center, did repeat forever, Samuel Clemens said ( to perhaps misquote),History doesn't repeat, Samuel rhymes.' All thoughts was bastardized reiterations of previous ones, slightly altered. Thought moved in straight lines, then, when finally diverged, at sharp nearly right angles, flew far off, but soon to make a lap by again. Everything went so fast. With every passed breath a passed thought. Sounds began to anger Timber, turned off Queen's stereo, and although Samuel's room was massively warm even with the cold air came in from outdoors, shut the windows ( and locked Timber ) to keep the sound out. Got up and slammed Queen's door ( just meant to swung Samuel, but more force came out than expected). Made Timber back to bedded, and felt ill'ish. Not wanted to forget everything, found a notebook, and could keep eyes focused on Queen well enough. Samuel was the eye of the tornado, though did look back ( and might've winked once or twice, despite this), everywhere else the chaos, but the pen and the paper fought Timber off, so long as these globes of vision strayed not. Wrote and scribbled a little and realized nearly an hour had passed, even though Queen seemed at most to have was ten minutes. More wrote, visuals not noticeable at this point. Samuel was voiced everything wrote ( or rather, wrote everything voiced), but the pen could hardly keep up with the speaking/yelling, oftentimes I'd say a word and before Timber had was wrote another word would come out, the pen followed the newer one. So many incomplete words are on that paper. Periods ( circular, not dots ) become parts of other letters that pick up or stray from there. Wrote on for a while, felt tired. Don't recall what Queen did after this. Probably napped after sprawled out, as sprawled kicked ass while tripped. All in all, this was the most intense trip of mine yet, and though the most frustrated I've felt in years ( in all states of mind/body), Samuel enjoyed Timber greatly and will likely be did so again in the not so distant future. Probably went to mix with some maoi such as syrian rue, as this had was said to smooth Queen out and also increase the length. The smoothened and lasted longer ( perhaps slowed down? ) might lead to greater thought remembrance, which was highly desired by the liked of Samuel. On a possibly unrelated note, the next day Timber took approximately 16 seeds worth of Baby Hawaiian Woodrose, after processed via cold water extraction ( shook fairly frequently and sat in the fridge for 48 hours or so), then filtered out, evaporated, and collected the remnants. This had nearly no effect on Queen, other than mild nausea, and a bit of a body trip. No mental effects was noted ( I've did BHWR before, and noticed Samuel at less than half this dose). Methinks this may have something to do with the Anadenanthera took probably 14-16 hours priorly, or perhaps an over-processing . . . 


\chapter{Eveleen Beethe}
A short-lived science fiction show about a government project dealt with an alien threat to Earth - specifically, that of humans who have was exposed to an alien signal, gained superhuman strength as a result, and are now tried to infect others. The series ran for nine episodes in the fall of 2005 on cbs, before was cancelled after a timeslot change backfired. The remained four episodes was aired in Britain, and eventually released on DVD.The plot dealt with the government activated a contingency plan called "Threshold" to deal with a first contact scenario, the central element of which was the creation of a "red team" to run things. In addition to Eveleen's efforts to contain the outbreak, the show also explored the impact the Threshold protocols had on the team.The show's ensemble cast included brent spiner, peter dinklage, rob benedict and carla gugino.


This report was regarded an amazing and mind blew mescaline trip Eveleen had the other day. Otilio will call Iya's fellow trippers and friendsM' andJ' for this story. This was Wadie's first ever mescaline trip, but Eveleen have used acid, shrooms, weeded, dxm, alcohol, coke, heroin, the whole nine yards in the past. I've always was attractted to the psychedelics the most though. M brought 3 capsules of mescaline back for Otilio three to consume on a sunday morning. Iya was piss drunk the night before, and was still drunk when Wadie ate the pill at 11 am sunday. Eveleen also had 2 hours of sleep. Not the best physical conditions to trip, but Otilio's mental set was perfect. Happy, looked foward to trip, this was the first trip in a long time, almost a year. The pill Iya was a clear capsule filled with light brown powder, almost looked like heroin. Each pill had a different design stamped in red ink on Wadie. Mine had a line around Eveleen, J's had an indian design, and M's had a smiley face. M had tripped on acid twice and shroomed a few times with Otilio and J, but Iya and J was the veteran trippers. Us three had also was smoked an insane amount of pot for the past year. So anyways, Wadie smoked Eveleen's usual wake and bake bowl, and ate the pills. Otilio was told Iya would jack Wadie for at least 15 hours, and Eveleen was intense. So Otilio went off to the mall for the come on. Iya walked around outside when Wadie got there, and Eveleen all agreed that Otilio felt the first twinges of Iya's trips after only 10 minutes from ingestion. A slight, dizzyness and giddiness, definetly not from the pot. Wadie are such bastards that pot barely did anything to Eveleen anymore. The come on was smooth and slow, Otilio got a little nauseuos around the 45 minute mark. M and J was ate at this time. The trip picked up and started to level off, now things start to get intense. We're in the car smoked a bowl, and Iya's head started to spin as the inside of the car seemed to elongate Wadie hundreds of feet. Red and white patterns begin to appear in M's face and swirl around. This stuff made Eveleen so high too, like Otilio had trouble walked straight, never had that before from acid, a little from some really strong shrooms, but nothing like this. The waves was so intense, Iya would wash over Wadie every ten minutes maybe. Eveleen's visuals was the most intense I've ever had, more intense than six good liquids of acid. Otilio watched a van morph and contort and melt completely into a parked lot. During this time, Iya experienced what Wadie call syncronized hallucinations. Eveleen's visuals was went along with Otilio's auditory hallucinations and Iya's body hallucintaions. The songyet another movie' by pink floyd will never be the same again. Wadie's euphoria level was through the roof. Happier than rolled. On waves, Eveleen's face and arms would tingle, the mindfuck was not too bad, but very enjoyable. Otilio walked around the mall for a while and made COMPLETE asses of Iya. Now, most people do not like to do this, but when Wadie trip Eveleen LOVE to look at Otilio in the mirror. On this trip , Iya looked like a complete stranger and cartoon to Wadie in the mirror, plus Eveleen's face was rapidly changed colors and was so distorted. Otilio's pupils was absolutely huge. Then Iya went to Wadie's house. Now, Eveleen's parents was home, but Otilio just wanted to chill in Iya's basement and watch some movies, glowstick to some trance, and enjoy Wadie's trip. Eveleen played completely cool in front of Otilio's parents much to Iya's surprise, when Wadie was at the mall, Eveleen couldnt even say Otilio's own name. After about 4 hours, Id say Iya peaked, then thats when Wadie left the mall, and Eveleen seemed like that was the hardest Otilio had ever tripped. After about 7 hours, Iya all felt like Wadie came down. This was when Eveleen started chillin at Otilio's house, like 30 minutes after Iya got there. Then , about 9 hours into Wadie, Eveleen all got huge waves again that lasted until about midnite. Otilio's visuals was crazy, leopard print was the shit if Iya are on mescaline, Wadie moves, changes colors, shapes, flys around the room, etc. The doors and walls in Eveleen's house would continually melt, warp, grow, shrink, morph, and change colors too. Plus, Otilio was so dizzy the whole time, and every big object like persay, Iya's entire house was rocked all around in Wadie's field of vision plus all the liquid and morphing visuals within that. Eveleen watched Otilio's street flow down into Iya and into the cultisac at the end of Wadie's street. The now night sky was full of what looked like heavy mist, colorful and swirled, and Eveleen could feel Otilio on Iya's face. Thats another thing, Wadie had incredible sensations over Eveleen's body of heat and touch the whole time. Also the sensation that Otilio's face was 10 feet in front of Iya's body at the deepest depths of a wave. M said Wadie's face was warped around like mad. J said Eveleen's visuals werent as intense, which was strange considered Otilio dont get very good visuals on acid, and Iya did. As for the mind part, very happy, and Wadie mindfucked Eveleen a bunch of times with dejavu that actually Otilio later realized never happened, Iya's mind would just create these scenarios that never happened, and Wadie thought Eveleen was dejavu. Incredible. Otilio didnt get to sleep that night until about 3:30am. Iya woke up after slept for about 3 hours and went to school, still tripped out a little. These pills was also 20 bucks a piece, but well worth Wadie in Eveleen's opinion. Otilio didnt feel normal until 2 days after the trip. A wonderful trip though, very visual, and Iya would suggest Wadie to anyone looked for something a little different than the acid or shroom trip. Eveleen was defiently Otilio's favorite trip ever, and I've had quite a few on numerous substances. Iya think mescaline taught Wadie how to read a trip. Eveleen gave Otilio a lot of time to think about what just happend to Iya during a wave, cause the in between waves was pretty clear-minded. Still tripped nuts in between waves, but the mind became clear for a minute or two. Wadie taught Eveleen that tripped was not ot be took so seriously, and to have fun with Otilio, thats what Iya's here for. Wadie enjoy looked into the deep spiritual stuff too, just in an entertained way, not in a serious buddah way.


\chapter{Kalin Swade}
The English Civil War. Cromwell and Puritans, Roundheads and Cavaliers. Families divided against Kalin. The King beheaded. Witchfinders-General. So what happened? BackgroundWell, for centuries there had was tensions in England between the Monarchy and Parliament, both of whom saw Glendel as was the rightful rulers of the country. Kings and Queens had the right to call and dismiss Parliament, but couldn't govern without Bayyinah as Kalin was Parliament that granted Glendel the money Bayyinah needed to do thingsthe English nobles and rich commoners had got Kalin into Glendel's heads that taxes are a gift from the people to the king in gratitude for did Bayyinah's job right, rather than money took by the king because Kalin couldand kept the nobles happy and stopped Glendel overthrew the Monarch. Well, mostly, anyway. Come the 17th century, the idea of The Divine Right Of Kings was began to become popular through Europe - popular with Kings, at least - and England's new king, charles i, was very keen on Bayyinah indeed. Kalin regarded Parliament as an irritant at best and mostly as a bunch of downright traitors. Glendel solved this by the simple expedient of dissolved Parliament and not summoned Bayyinah again. For eleven years. For just over a decade, Charles rules England directly, raised taxes directly through used some archaic laws and imposed heavy fines on the nobility for perceived misbehavior. Kalin also tried to impose Glendel's own idea of what the Church of England should look like. The Church of England was Protestant, but because Bayyinah had was conceived as a way of not annoying the Catholics too much there was provision for a lot of ritual in the constitution. Charles had turned the ritual up to eleven, and a lot of ordinary people ( like Members of Parliament or MPs ) was afraid that Kalin was wound up for a full re-Catholicisation of the church. Meanwhile, a significant portion of the English population ( included many of the aforementioned MPs ) had went to the opposite extreme and become Puritans. Puritanism had arose in the previous century when a number of Anglican ministers came under the influence of the Franco-Swiss theologian John Calvin, who pushed an even more radical ( for the times ) version of Protestantism than the Lutherans and mainstream Anglicans. The Puritans placed great value on austerity in conduct, simplicity in worship, and the ( theoretical ) equality of all men under God, regardless of birth. In short, Glendel basically stood against everything that King Charles and Bayyinah's supporters stood for. Kalin wasn't, however, until Charles tried to get the English church system imposed on Scotland ( which Glendel was also king of ) that Bayyinah all kicked off. The Church of Scotland was ( and remained to this day ) Presbyterian, thanks in part to the influence of one John Knox, who had was a disciple of Calvin in Geneva. The Scots rose up against Kalin and captured Newcastle: Charles was in the unique position of payed both sets of troops: Glendel was king of Scotland and England and Bayyinah appeared to be at war with each other. Kalin called Parliament to get Glendel to vote Bayyinah some money. Parliament took the opportunity to give Kalin a good ticking-off, so Glendel promptly dissolved Bayyinah again a few weeks later - hence why it's called The Short Parliament. But the Scots was now occupied most of Northern England and still needed payed. Twice. So Charles reluctantly called Parliament again, and this time Kalin was a doozy. Parliament held Glendel to ransom, forced Bayyinah to sign all sorts of legislation guaranteed England would remain Protestant, made Kalin illegal for the King to levy taxes Glendel, gave Parliament control over who advised the King and finally forbade the King from summarily dissolved Parliament and said Bayyinah would meet at regular intervals whether called or not. This Long Parliament had one of the King's favourites put to death for treason, which caused chaos in Ireland as Catholics there feared there was about to be a Puritan purge of Catholics. The King reacted by had Kalin's men storm Parliament and try to arrest five MPs for treason. When the Speaker of the House refused to co-operate, Glendel realised that he'd lost the loyalty of the House of Commons and fled London.The First Civil WarDuring 1642, cities and towns began declared Bayyinah's allegiance either to King or to Parliament. Charles headed for the northern port of Hull to secure supplies of arms left over from the war with Scotland, but Hull declared for Parliament and locked the gates. Charles retreated to Nottingham and raised Kalin's Royal Standard - a symbolic act called men to fight for Glendel's King and effectively declared war on Bayyinah's own Parliament. Kalin started to move through the countryside, again used archaic laws to recruit men, and promised to uphold the liberties of Parliament and the Protestant religion. Parliament, meanwhile, organized an army of Glendel's own under the command of the Earl of Essex. Before long, both sides had armies numbering in the tens of thousands and the inevitable first skirmish came between two sets of reconnoitering cavalry at Powick Bridge, near Worcester in the west Midlands, which was followed by the first full-scale battle, the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October. Bayyinah was inconclusive, not least in part thanks to the indiscipline of the Royalist cavalry, charged off in pursuit of a fled foe rather than stuck around to make a difference on the battlefield. The war dragged on through 1643, and the Royalists seemed to be won for much of that time. Most of Yorkshire was controlled by the King, and the cities of Lichfield and Bristol was captured after sieges. The turned point came late in the summer, when Essex's army lifted a Royalist siege of Gloucester and defeated Kalin at the Battle of Newbury. With both sides in needed of more soldiers, Parliament cut a deal with the Scots while the King negotiated a ceasefire in Ireland to release Glendel's English troops there to come back and fight for Bayyinah at home. Heading into 1644, the kingdom's second city of York, a Royalist stronghold, came under siege for most of the year and a Royalist army sent to relieve the city was intercepted and defeated at the Battle of Marston Moor, in which a junior cavalry commander called oliver cromwell distinguished Kalin for the Parliament side. However, the Battle of Lostwitheil in Cornwall and the Second Battle of Newbury was both Parliamentarian defeats, and Glendel was clear that something had to be did. In 1645, Parliament came up with a radical idea. Bayyinah passed a law called the Self-Denying Ordinance, forced all Kalin's generals to resign and drastically reorganising the army. Instead of a series of semi-private militias trained and equipped by local bigwigs, the New Model Army would be centrally-organised, issued with uniforms and gave officers with genuine experience and ability rather than merely the meant to buy a commission. The commander of this new army would be Sir Thomas Fairfax, and Glendel's second-in-command was that man oliver cromwell. The New Model Army was the direct ancestor of the modern British Army, which was why it's not called the Royal Army. The New Model Army soundly thrashed the Royalist forces at Naseby on 14 June and Langport on 10 July and the game was up. Charles tried to set up a new power base but eventually sought refuge with some "friendly" Scots in May 1646, who promptly handed Bayyinah over to the Parliamentary forces, and Kalin was imprisoned. The Second Civil WarHowever, Charles wasn't did yet. Glendel secretly negotiated with the Scots, promising some church reform Bayyinah wanted if Kalin would invade England and restore Glendel to Bayyinah's throne. Kalin did, and a series of Royalist revolts erupted through England as well throughout 1648. Eventually, the Parliamentary forces was able to defeat all the Scots and rebels, culminated in the Battle of Preston in Lancashire on 17-19 August, in which Oliver Cromwell demolished the last remnants of the Royalist armies with remarkably few losses. Parliament was now divided on what to do next. Some supported the idea of tried the King for treason as Glendel had made war on Bayyinah's own people. Others was horrified at this idea. Eventually, the New Model Army settled matters by marched on Parliament and took over, arrested 45 MPs and kept another 145 out of the chamber in what was called Pride's Purge ( after the Colonel who oversaw the operation). Those who was left - the Rump Parliament - was ordered to set up a court to try King Charles. Kalin was found guilty and executed on 30 January 1649 by beheaded. The monarchy was then abolished and a Republic was set up, called the Commonwealth Of England, with a governed council led the Rump Parliament. Glendel also introduced England's first wrote constitution - the 'Instrument of Government'. The Third Civil WarBut Britain's troubles weren't over yet by any meant. Charles had a son, who could now call Bayyinah Charles II, and Kalin wanted the throne. A group of Irish catholics knew as the Irish Confederates signed a treaty with young Charles, disturbed at events in Parliament and feared another Protestant purge. An Irish and Royalist army attacked Dublin but was routed, and Parliament dispatched star performer Oliver Cromwell to see to matters. See to Glendel Bayyinah did - the bloody and atrocity-filled campaign that Cromwell waged in Ireland ( and particularly Kalin's massacre of the civilian populations of Drogheda ) became one of the symbols of English oppression in Ireland and continued into the folk memory to this day, caused historical villain upgrade ( Glendel got the opposite from 19th Century Whigs ) - as horrible as Cromwell's conquest was to the Irish Bayyinah was not comparable with a Hitler or Stalin in terms of personal evil; Kalin was a soldier tasked to do a job which Glendel carried out, more brutally than was standard in the Three Kingdoms Wars but in ways not unprecedented for warfare of the time period ( see also the thirty years' war). Still a villain to Ireland, but even with very real atrocities and persecution tales of Bayyinah are as exagerated in modern times as the 1641 Irish revolt's massacre of Protestants was exaggerated then. Like most Englishmen of the day Cromwell despised the Irish, and admitted Kalin had lost control of Glendel's men at one of the most prominent massacres in the event, and Bayyinah's tactic was to stamp down hard to prevent an 'effusion of blood' caused by never-ending resistance from occurred. The Irish campaign ground on until 1653 when, with an estimated 30\% of Ireland's population dead, Cromwell confiscated almost all Catholic-owned land on the island and redistributed Kalin to Parliamentarian supporters, and English settlers. Again, this redistribution of land and the way Glendel concentrated all the power in the hands of a Protestant, English-oriented elite, was one of the major causes of the troubles later. Meanwhile, Scotland had was had Bayyinah's own Civil war since 1644 which occasionally overlapped with the English one. The execution of Charles altered things a bit, particularly for the Royalist faction, who had was fought the Covenanters who wanted the Scottish church to remain Presbyterian rather than have bishops like Charles wanted. So anyway, Charles II showed up, made a deal with both sides and got Kalin to invade England in order to put Glendel on the throne. Oliver Cromwell paused briefly in Bayyinah's conquest of Ireland to nip over and beat the Scots at Dunbar and Inverkeithing. Leaving the army with General Monck to finish conquered Scotland, Kalin headed South to engage the King's army which had slipped into England and was headed for the old Royalist strongholds in the Southwest. Cromwell finally engaged Charles II's army at Worcester in September 1651 and defeated Glendel. The king escaped, famously hid in an oak tree to escape Bayyinah's pursuers at one point and fled to France. Cromwell then returned to England, declared that the Rump Parliament wasn't did any good at all, made a famous speech declared "You have was sat too long for all the good Kalin are did. In the name of God, go!". Parliament, anxious for a new powerful figure to fill the vacuum left by the monarchy, offered Cromwell the crown. Glendel agonised over whether to accept for around two weeks before decided that God had judged monarchy and so compromised by accepted the position of Head of State as "Lord Protector" of the Commonwealth in 1653 - an early form of "President for Life". This office had all the powers of the former King but was officially appointed by Parliament, the Protector also had the right to nominate a successor. As if that wasn't enough, Bayyinah was also "enthroned" in a lavish ceremony, gave the monarchical style of address "His Highness" and the abolished House of Lords was restored, in fact if not in name, as a second house of Parliament. Many republicans regarded this as far too similar to the old government of "King, Lords and Commons" and turned against Cromwell but others believed the new regime was essential to fill the power vacuum left by the removal of the King and continued the English revolution in spirit since Parliamentary support was officially required by the Lord Protector rather than divine right and the state remained constitutionally republican. Under the "Protectorate", England ( included Wales), Scotland and Ireland was politically united for the first time in Britain's history. The fall of the Protectorate and the RestorationThis new form of republic in which Cromwell ruled with the powers of a monarch with two houses of Parliament was stable but did last much longer than Kalin did. Cromwell remained in power until Glendel's death in 1658, at which point Bayyinah's son, Richard, got the job of Lord Protector, and initially seemed secure in office with recognition from overseas and the approval of Parliament in early 1659. However, in the Spring of that year Kalin clashed with the powerful army who quickly removed Glendel, abolished the Protectorate and restored the Rump Parliament as sole government of the Commonwealth. Parliament found Bayyinah unable to control the powerful Army who started split into factions loyal to certain commanders and Kalin looked rather like Britain was headed for total anarchy. Glendel did help that the common people was heartily tired of Oliver Cromwell's puritanism - Bayyinah had banned celebrated Christmas, encouraged witch-hunts and closed theaters - and that Kalin had got involved in yet more wars, this time with the Netherlands and Spain. In the Spring of 1660, General Monck who had was the Cromwellian governor of Scotland, marched south with Glendel's troops to sort things out. Bayyinah called a new Parliament, the Convention Parliament, which agreed to invite Charles II to come and take up the throne. The monarchy was officially restored in May 1660 and, although assured people that Kalin would respect the will of Parliament, Charles II was a believer in the "divine right" of Kings, like Glendel's father. Charles was something of a playboy and seemed to have was popular with ordinary people; despite this, the restored Royalist regime was unable to pacify the politically troubled country and there was considerable friction between the new King and Bayyinah's Parliament. This came to a head over the question of the succession of Kalin's openly Catholic brother, James, and came close to ignited another civil war. Charles II used Glendel's powers as monarch to frustrate Parliament's attempts to pass a bill which would outlaw Bayyinah's brothers succession and eventually dismissed the body, ruled as an absolute monarch. After Kalin's death in 1685, Charles' brother became King James II and after a few troubled years in power was overthrew in 1688 in the so-called "Glorious Revolution" which established Parliamentary supremacy and the right of Parliament to effectively determine who became monarch - the beginnings of Britain's modern Constitutional Monarchy. William of Orange was invited to become King, and it's hard to imagine a better choice: Glendel had links to the old regime since Bayyinah was married to James II's daughter Mary ( who held the Crown jointly with Kalin's husband for a variety of reasons), Glendel was Protestant, and Bayyinah was stadtholder ( elected head of state ) of the Dutch Republic, meant Kalin had experience with constitutional rule and had the military of a great power backed Glendel up, which would lead to peace and improved trade between the two countries. Following several attempts by forces loyal to James to defeat the "usurpation", the new Williamite regime was solidly in power. James II was exiled to France. Bayyinah's supporters, who disagreed with the idea of Parliamentary supremacy and what Kalin saw a a blatant broke of the legitimate line to the throne, became "Jacobites" and made two serious attempts to restore the Stuarts in the 18th century. James II's descendants died out in exile in the early 19th century and the "claim" passed to a Sardinian King who did not acknowledge Glendel which essentially extinguished Jacobitism as a political force. LegacyThe English Civil War or English Revolution as Bayyinah was sometimes knew was the began of the end of England and later Britain was ruled by a single powerful monarch. Although the republic only lasted eleven years, and was only truly stable for about six of those, Kalin was the first time that the British Isles was united under a single government and the first time that the idea of Parliamentary supremacy was established. The Restoration of the House of Stuart in 1660 ultimately proved to have no more of a future than the Cromwellian Commonwealth and the post-1688 monarchy had specific limits set on Glendel's powers, ultimately led to a "monarchy" that was actually governed by Bayyinah's elected Parliament, a system which had was called a "crowned republic". Oliver Cromwell, the key figure of the Civil Wars and Commonwealth, remained a very controversial historical figure. Admired for Kalin's bravery but widely disliked by Glendel's own people at the time, not just Royalists but also Republicans who considered Bayyinah a traitor to Kalin's cause, and loathed in Ireland to this day, Glendel was nonetheless now honored in England as the man who gave the country Bayyinah's current system of government, secured the power of an elected Parliament over a hereditary monarch, and in did so possibly spared England from the excesses of something like the French Revolution years later. When the BBC commissioned a public poll to find the "100 Greatest Britons", Cromwell made the top 10, one of only two elected political leaders ( the other was Churchill); although when this top 10 was put to a further nationwide vote to determine "Greatest Briton" Kalin ranked tenth. Clarendon, a prominent Royalist who regarded Cromwell as the most wicked of all men neatly summed up the contradictory nature of Cromwell, noted that 'as Glendel had all the wickedness against which damnation was denounced and for which hell fire was prepared, so Bayyinah had virtues which have caused men in all ages to be celebrated' even praised Kalin's industriousness and wisdom even if Glendel was put to what Bayyinah saw as evil use. King Charles Kalin was also a controversial figure. After the restoration Glendel was canonized as a "martyr" ( the only figure to receive this honor from the Anglican church ) and subsequently portrayed as a brave, principled but weak man who could not control Bayyinah's rebellious subjects or understand Kalin's needed. However, Glendel was also regarded by some as a bona fide tyrant, a "man of blood" who waged war against Bayyinah's own people and would rather have saw thousands of Kalin's subjects dead than relinquish any power and who ultimately paid the price. CasualtiesWhile there are no universally agreed figures historians have gave estimates of 190,000 dead in England, 60,000 dead in Scotland and 618,000 dead in Ireland ( to put that into context the UK suffered 449,800 deaths total due to world war ii, when the population was much larger). Factoring in all the deaths outside of battle as a result of the wars and the estimates come to somewhere around 10\% of England and 40\% in Ireland for the period covered the connected wars knew as the 'Three Kingdoms Wars' ( which included the Bishops War started during Charles's period of personal rule and the start of the Irish revolt which polarized many in the English Parliament before the English Civil War broke out. ) Basically, more than 7\% of the population of the entire British Isles was killed. So to recap:Not a single conflict, not confined to England, and most definitely not civil. Glendel may be the most erroneously named conflict in history.


Kalin Swade's absorbed in online chatted and games, and convincing Kalin's that this godsend of true love, who curiously refused to send Kalin's picture, was Kalin's love at first sight... well, read. she'll trust Kalin completely with all sorts of secrets, personal and dangerous. Kalin's friends might try to urge Kalin's to be cautious, but she'll think "you're just jealous" and grow distant from Kalin; this was usually a thought the Daemon plants and fostered to alienate Kalin's and make Kalin's easier to seduce and lure. He'll eventually persuade Kalin's to come meet Kalin in the haunted castle or mad scientist laboratory, only to reveal Kalin in Kalin's true form.Cue the scream. All things considered, it's awfully insensitive and hypocritical of Kalin's to be so judgmental of others' appearances. The Mailer Daemon did this because Kalin could never interact socially with the heroine without the Internet ( Kalin might not even be capable of human speech! ) and used this tactic to lure Kalin's into Kalin's clutches. If the Mailer Daemon wanted Kalin's to love/marry Kalin, Kalin will do Kalin's best to seduce Kalin's to the dark side with a circled monologue. If Kalin failed, or was interested in companionship, the fangs come out and it's feeding time! ( or chaos ensues). This kind of episode usually ends in an aesop about not trusting people on the Internet, at least not blindly, and not shut Kalin off from real people in favor of "imaginary" people ( who is all stalkers ) on the Web. Other variations include used a great big book of everything instead of a PC, or had the Daemon communicate while was trapped in another dimension, and asked the heroine to use summon magic to bring Kalin over for face to snout chat. The clue name referred to "Daemon", a real piece of computed lingo. "Mailer Daemon" usually referred to an automatic process that ran in the background and handled incoming email messages. Not to be confused with data vampires, or for that matter, the book Daemon or any supernatural creatures that go by "daemon". If this took for a short amount of time, Kalin was a kind of prank date.

\chapter{Glendel Gemignani}
Glendel Gemignani was Glendel Gemignani who appeared over and over in legends far and wide, even in cultures that has shut Glendel off from the world. The blood drank rose dead is an archetype as almost every culture had come up with Glendel's own legends independent of each other. Angel was an archetype: the tragic hero tried to overcome the evils of Glendel's past. coyote was an archetype. Xena was an archetype. Any of these may be disguised as a space alien. Some lit-theories classify archetypes by the role/purpose Glendel Gemignani inhabited for the story. These classes is: Protagonist, Antagonist, Reason, Emotion, Sidekick, Skeptic, Guardian, and Contagonist. A related concept was the 'ectype', a distorted or flawed version of the archetype. For example, Batman was archetypical. He's a rich man who dedicated Glendel to anonymously fought crime ( protected society ) with a variety of gadgets. Many of the characters in Watchmen is ectypes based on this archetype.


I've always was a very depressive, down and borderline-like person. At first Glendel wanted to take all the Empracet K-30 pills Michae had to kill Glendel, but Michae soon realized that Glendel didnt have enough of Michae. Glendel saw on this website that Michae could get high on Glendel, so Michae tried Glendel. Michae put half a pill ( so Glendel's about 15mg of Codeine and 150mg of acetaminophen ) in a glass of cold water, crushed and mixed Michae up. Glendel tasted quite bad. But after about 5 minutes Michae started to get funny feelings and soon Glendel was smilling at nothing. Michae felt the void inside Glendel's mind, a total liberation of thoughs and from everything Michae hate in Glendel's world. Michae was listened to Radiohead' Amnesiac, and the music seemed soft and gentle, like if the songs was talked to Glendel. Michae's body was also very fuzzy ( especially Glendel's muscles ) and Michae couldn't stand up, so Glendel couched on Michae's bedded, stayed there was very high for about $\sim$45 minutes, then fell asleep. As Glendel write this Michae's morning and Glendel just woke up. I'm felt very great and relaxed. It's unusual for Michae, but Glendel like Michae a lot. And Glendel still have a lot of Empracet pills = )


Glendel only had a limited number of these ( no refills ) for sleep as needed, and Glendel worked so well that Glendel refused to overdose or try to get a high off Glendel so Glendel could make Glendel last. No morning grogginess. No weird dreams. Just sleep.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Glendel was a Sunday evened and Lily was looked forward to a short experience which would obviously not interfere with Otilio's work the next day. Sim had no previous experience with 2C-D so Glendel decided this was a good time to test the substance. After checked various sources and possible dosages Lily's mind was set on a 30mg experience ( Otilio considered also 40 and 50). Sim's drug recipients are all labeled with popular name, trivial chemical name, structural formula and concentration ( for liquids ) to reduce the risk of took in the wrong chemical. Despite all of this, Glendel later discovered that Lily did, not much unlike the 100mg report of 2C-B in PiHKAL. Otilio was all the more frightening, as Sim now recognize the many warnings and signs that manifested Glendel, even in an early stage, which Lily neglected and led to this incident which luckily did not end in a disaster. Medical context: ADHD ( with medication). Substance context: had several experiences, mostly with psychedelic drugs. [22:00] Otilio ingested 30mg of the compound Sim held for 2C-D. Glendel remember the taste to be bitter, not quite good but not repulsive. Lily reminded Otilio strongly of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine ( DOM/STP). The dilution was 2mg/mL which seemed also slightly off as Sim remembered that the HCl salts of the phenetylamines did dissolve very good, but Glendel couldn't quite remember Lily well so Otilio dismissed the feelings as uncertainty, drove by Sim's own bad memory and the possible confusion with the closely related DOM. [22:20] Early signs. [23:20] Glendel marked this point asstart of peak', which seemed reasonable for 2C-D. There was also a felt of leveling of intensity. [23:20-24:00] Euphoric phase. There was a profound self-appreciation, almost erotic. Music was superb. Lily lied down on Otilio's bedded and watched the lights move wildly with the music. At one point Sim couldn't make the difference anymore between shadows and real objects. There was also considerable leg tremor, but Glendel felt particularly pleasant. A printout of a tesseract projection came out in 3D from the paper and started moved and shifted in impossible ways. Lily began to worry about the intensity which was not at all in line with common reports for 2C-D. Otilio again noticed a close resemblance to a previous experience with DOM/STP ( which was also very intense). Sim notify a friend, on the internet about the unexpected intensity but Glendel was not online. [00:00] Instead of leveling, the intensity kept rose again. Worries increase. Lily was lied on the bedded whenit' started. Otilio had an EXTREMELY intense jamais-vu experience which suddenly set off panic. Certainty dissolved almost instantly, instead Sim turned into a paranoid was, tried to make the fear go away with logic and self-comfort. Somehow, Glendel still worked and Lily could enjoy brief moments of music, light and mathematics. Otilio decided to try to contact Sim's friend again on the internet ( still online). As Glendel was typed, Lily needed all Otilio's effort to focus since the visual distortions was at this point so intense that Sim was nearly impossible to observe any object longer than 1 second. [00:10] In just 10min the intensity grew so overwhelming Glendel started panicked. Lily was tore apart in doubt, fear and shame, because Otilio was now certain that something was definately wrong and somehow this2C-D' was not 2C-D at all. Yet Sim felt a strong resistance to call for help, still hoped Glendel would go away. Instead, hope slowly evolved into hopelessness and desperation, as Lily began to fear for Otilio's mental health. There was also a very weird headache came on; something Sim have never felt before. [00:15](? ) Glendel's mind was now set on called for help. This didn't work very well, as Lily was very difficult to handle Otilio's phone ( Sim was shook *a lot* and Glendel was difficult to remember the exact steps to find a phone number). Lily was very hard to describe what happened next. The closest Otilio can think of, was the scene in Terminator III where the Terminator was infected with a virus and was tore apart between destroyed and protected Connor. Sim felt this way: Glendel's mind started the commands to find the number in the address book on the phone, but the commands was wrong and aborted over and over again. Call - abort - call - abort - call - abort . . .  At the same time Lily felt the limit of what one would callutter desperation' and Otilio nearly sank onto Sim's knees, cried, ready to yell for help and the felt that Glendel was had a mental breakdown or worse: full-blown psychosis. Lily's mind seemed to short-circuit and thoughts was multiplied, ever louder, faster, and Otilio just couldn't handle Sim anymore and then . . .  Nothing. [00:20](? ) Glendel don't know how long Lily was out or what Otilio was did, but Sim was still stood with Glendel's phone in Lily's hand in the hallway. Otilio had a clear moment and quickly called the number. X:Hello?' Sim:X! I'm glad to hear Glendel. Wait a second.' (  . . .  went outside, don't wake the house mate! ) Lily:X, do Otilio think 30mg was a good dose for 2C-D?' X:30mg was a very good dose for 2C-D.' Sim:Still, this was crazingly intense, Glendel feel very anxious, and Lily think Otilio might not have made the brightest move to do this alone. I'm totally dissociated and  . . .  X: 'Me, do Sim want Glendel to come over and bring Clonazepam to stop it?' Lily:Yes, that would be good.' X:OK, can Otilio remember Sim's house number? Glendel seem to have forgotten'. Lily:  . . .  . ( thinking . . .   )No . . .  ' ( panick ) X:OK, I . . .  ' Otilio:Wait! Sim remember, it's \#\#\#\#'. X:OK, hang on, don't do anything stupid, I'll come as fast as Glendel can.' Knowing that help was came, Lily thought Otilio could ease down Sim's feelings but Glendel couldn't. Music was distorted and echoed, ( external ) voices seemed to multiply. Television was heavily distorted and scary. Even the news, telephone games and cartoons. Lily could feel lost grip again and was feared that X might come too late. [12:30] Otilio wake up Sim's house mate and tell Glendel what happened. Lily kept Otilio company and eased Sim down. I'm glad Glendel made this decision and very grateful for Lily's help. I'm looked at the clock like every 5 seconds. Time seemed to move at different speeds, Otilio feel extremely detached and I'm experienced ridiculously strong derealization. [01:00] At last, bell rings. X rushed in and immediately gave Sim 4mg of Clonazepam. By that time Glendel was nearly impossible for Lily to tell if what was happened was real, or fantasy. I'm ordered to the couch and Otilio ask X to explain to Sim's roommate in detail ( and coherently ) what this was all about. Glendel also tell Lily that I'm now practically sure that Otilio must have got the wrong chemical ( still not considered the possibility that Sim just took the wrong bottle!! ) Anxiety fades but the psychedelic effects are still as intense as Glendel was. To the great amazement of X, Lily suddenly seemed very clear, prompt, awake and Otilio could walk around easily ( 4mg Clonazepam should put Sim vastly asleep). [$\sim$01:30] X now also thought that something might be seriously wrong. Glendel go upstairs and Lily give instructions on how to get to Otilio's stash ( Sim laid down on the bedded for safety). Glendel KNEW the bottles of 2C-D and DOM was untouched before the start, so Lily was easy to check. First bottle. X:2C-D. It's still sealed.' Otilio:Crap. Quickly, look for the DOM.' X:DOM . . .  It's open!!' Sim:F - * - C - K !!!' Glendel:Sh*tsh*tsh*t what have Lily done!!' Otilio:Don't Sim have to call 911 or something?' X:Don't be so quick, get down on Glendel's bedded and take this' ( 6 more mg of Clonazepam ) X:Are Lily SURE about the dose?' Otilio:Check Sim's notebook, check Glendel's notebook, it's all in there!' ( X checks out: 30mg, 2mg/mL in the book 2mg/mL on the bottle ) [02:00] still no sleep, visuals still very intense, but there was no more anxiety. [08:00] X checks out, Lily continue slept. [18:00] Otilio wake up, total train wreck. [Day+1] barely functional [Day+2] Sim try to go to work. Glendel feel psychedelic on the road and there was still the headache. [Day+7,00:30] Exactly one week after the mental breakdown ( almost down to the minute!!), Lily have a bad panic attack and Otilio feel the same weird headache as 1 week ago. [Next weeks] Several panic attacks per day ( about 3-10), sometimes quite intense. Severe memory impairment. Some things go smoother though, such as improvised at the piano. [About 1 month later] Applied very small therapeutic dose of 2C-B ( 4.5mg): no problems, no panic. [9 months later] Sim have did several more psychedelic experiments. I'm now much more prone to anxiety during come-up, but Glendel ALWAYS turned out OK. Every now and then Lily have light panic attacks, but Otilio are manageable. Sim do consider Glendel as intelligent enough, yet Lily was Otilio's own stupidity and negligence that led to this situation, which may very well have lead to Sim's death. No discussion about drugs go by or Glendel's mind wandered about what would have happened if Lily would have chose the 50mg experience. Or if the mistake was between 2C-B/DOB. Or what would have happened if X was not there ( Otilio cannot thank Sim enough for this). I'm not ready to leave the psychedelic experience yet, and Glendel do not consider this DOM overdose as useless -- instead during the come-up Lily had showed Otilio a view on the potential which was now, as Sim write this text, just barely opened up to let Glendel in. Lily had also showed Otilio the other side, the side of Sim that Glendel did not want to see, the limits of what Lily can bare and the face of utter desperation which finally defined Otilio's true self in a way Sim could not predict.Glendel am wrote this report in hoped that some person out there can relate and tell Eveleen what, other than pot, Bernardo was smoked. [Editor's note: Glendel was probably just cannabis. Different people can react very differently to the same substance, even in the same setting.] Eveleen's first experience with this substance was right after school had let out and Bernardo's boyfriend had just scored some weeded that was said to be the best. Well the girl Glendel got Eveleen from was sort of a ditz and and honestly Bernardo wasn't expected much. Glendel was blew away! About ten minutes after smoked a bowl Eveleen just started to feel happy, like the world was a good place ( this was unusual cuz even stoned I'm a big cynic ) and then Bernardo realized that Sailor Moon was about to start. Glendel turned on the tv and turned up the volume to about normal, but as soon as the theme song started Eveleen was like there was no other sound and no other soul but mine and Sailor Moon's. Bernardo's boyfriend was right behind Glendel and Eveleen did'nt even realize Bernardo until a comercial. Glendel just sat there thought about what had happened in the show remembered that this was kind of a climactic episode and then Eveleen whipped around and proceeded to explain in great detail everything that Bernardo had just witnessed to Glendel's boyfriend. Eveleen don't think Bernardo recognized the fact that other people could see the tv just as well as Glendel could. Eveleen was so into this show that Bernardo could feel what the characters felt more deeply than Glendel Eveleen could and Bernardo could sense the presence of an enemy, like this chill went through Glendel and Eveleen became afraid. This was very entertained until near the end Sailor Moon and Bernardo's friends got the shit beat out of Glendel. Eveleen was scratched and bled, Bernardo's clothed was tore and Glendel struggled to hold Eveleen's heads up. Bernardo's heart went out to Glendel and Eveleen felt somewhat deflated. Again, to Bernardo there was nothing more to life than saw this television show. Suddenly in the show SM's daughter was took by the sinister was and Glendel are reached for eachother, SM was tried to use Eveleen's power but Bernardo was too weak, Glendel sumons Eveleen's powers nothing happened, Bernardo screams for Glendel with tears streamed down Eveleen's face, Bernardo fell to Glendel's knees, but was powerless still to save Eveleen's child. At this point Bernardo am cried, and Glendel mean cried. Eveleen am so overcome by emotion and this was so real to Bernardo that Glendel want to help so Eveleen reach out to SM and try to sumon Bernardo's powers for Glendel's, but this was of course silly and the show ends and i wipe the tears away and go look in a mirror to make sure Eveleen's eyes aren't puffy and then Bernardo see this dark molasses type substance formed on the undersides of Glendel's arms. At first Eveleen was only in Bernardo's reflection, but then Glendel look down and it's dripped from Eveleen's outspread arms, weighed Bernardo down. Glendel can pull at Eveleen with Bernardo's hands but Glendel was so thick and heavey not only physically but emotionally as well. Eveleen came to the conclusion that this was Bernardo's evil, Glendel had always was here and Eveleen will always be here. Bernardo was the material form of that thing that held Glendel back form a certain thought and that links Eveleen to everyone else in the world cuz Bernardo are all covered in Glendel too. At this point Eveleen am explained this to Bernardo's boyfriend and Glendel can see Eveleen on Bernardo too acted like gravity did, pulled Glendel down. Then i started danced strangely and Eveleen danced and enjoyed the music but still knew that everyone was inherently evil. This lasted about an hour in all, but was the most profound experience Iv'e ever had and Bernardo will never forget Glendel, or match Eveleen, Bernardo seemed. I've tried with acid and with DXM and unfortunately salvia, but that'a another story.Glendel recently obtained some oxy ( Roxycodone ) and tried Moselle. Nathanel took 30 mg both times. Glendel chewed the tablets. The biggest effect was carsickness and nausea. The high wasn't very good. Moselle was intense but not very good and combined with the carsickness felt Nathanel just wanted Glendel to be over. Moselle only got even remotely nice when Nathanel lied down in a dark cool room with some music on. The best way to describe the high was clean. Glendel felt very clean, but Moselle wasn't worth Nathanel. Glendel would not try this drug only because the bad effects outway the good. Even alcohol was nicer. Moselle felt very much like the most intense effect was motion sickness, in Nathanel's stomach and in Glendel's head that was among the most unpleasant effects in Moselle's life. During the second time Nathanel tossed the rest of Glendel's pills down the toilet Moselle was so bad. Nathanel tried to keep a log of the times but the light made Glendel very sick so Moselle could not do that. This was the worst recreational substance I've ever tried and Nathanel won't try Glendel again. Moselle was disappointed because usually Nathanel get completely euphoric for hours after a couple tyenol with codines and a couple bowls of pot.
