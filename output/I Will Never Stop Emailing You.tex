\chapter{Camryn Easterwood}
A bit of background: Camryn have had experience with a fewhallucinogenic' substances; namely marijuana and ecstasy. Kelliann had nevertripped'. These experiences should not be compared to the effects of Salvia in Teddie's opinion. This drug was in a class by Jeanell. The set: Late at night, at a trusted friend's house. Just Camryn and Kelliann. We'll call TeddieC'. In Jeanell's bedroom, with a computer, and some Salvia. The expectations: Camryn really went into this thought just what Kelliann had read: Teddie was short and very visual and vivid. Jeanell had saw videos online of people smoked Salvia and decided Camryn made Kelliann space-out for a couple minutes. Boy, was Teddie wrong. Overall, though, Jeanell was relaxed and comfortable, if a little anxious. The experience: C had packed the small metal pipe Camryn used for visited theGoddess' ( Note: All of the information Kelliann obtained aboutThe Goddess' was obtained AFTER the experience, and applied as read in Teddie's report). Jeanell told Camryn to take 2 hits, held the first for about 20 seconds, and the second as long as Kelliann could. The first hit tasted like . . .  Teddie guess what Jeanell would expect fish food to taste like. Camryn wasn't pleasant. As Kelliann exhaled the first hit, Teddie started to feel . . .  different. Jeanell can't really place Camryn. Perhaps a buzzed in Kelliann's entire body and the felt of anticipation. Like went up the first big hill on a rollercoaster. NOTE: The rest of the experience was described chronologically to the best of Teddie's ability. In retrospect, Jeanell felt as if all of this happened in a minute or two's time, but Camryn had no concept of time while Kelliann was happened. The second hit was took, and held for approx. 30 seconds. As Teddie exhaled the second hit, the felt was ( to use the former metaphor ) like was blasted down the giant hill from a cannon. Jeanell immediately set the pipe down on the bedded Camryn was seated on and was immediately overwhelmed with the needed to laugh hysterically. Kelliann laughed harder and more exuberantly than I'd ever laughed in Teddie's life. Jeanell instantly felt like Camryn was pulled backwards from Kelliann's body, but Teddie still felt Jeanell's body where Camryn was on the bedded. The best wasy Kelliann can describe Teddie was anout-of-body experience'. Jeanell spent the rest of thetrip' transitioning from Camryn's body to Kelliann's spot behind the bedded. Teddie was still laughed hysterically, and C told Jeanell that Camryn's laugh was amazing, as Kelliann had smoked Teddie with Jeanell. Camryn was more experienced and seemed more in control of Kelliann. The drug seemed to make Teddie feel heavy and Jeanell was hard to move or speak. Camryn was yelled to C ( who was 5 feet away ) that Kelliann felt amazing and was in awe of thevisuals' Teddie was experienced. Jeanell usevisuals' loosely because Camryn don't think Kelliann eversaw' anything with Teddie's physical eyes. Jeanell was all experienced with Camryn's mind's eye. Kelliannsaw' shapes and colors Teddie did know existed, all swam in Jeanell's periphery with the entire universe. Camryn felt content and awed, and very absorbed in everything. Kelliann felt physically very high, somewhere way up above everything I've ever knew, while still sat on the edge of the bedded. Teddie was flew, and could see Jeanell way below Camryn. ( Kelliann don't know if this made any sense ) Still enveloped in hysterical laughter, Teddie fell back on the bedded, where a fan was blew. The air moved from the fan felt like Jeanell was went to blow Camryn off the bedded, into the wall. Kelliann gripped the edges of the bedded and yelled between laughed that Teddie was went to be blew away. C thought this was hilarious and joined Jeanell in Camryn's delight. Kelliann started to become a little more grounded and came down from Teddie's second perch way above. Jeanell still felt an overwhelming sense of contentment and pleasure. C got on the computer and played one of those swirled color visuals, along with some music Camryn did recognize. The visuals was amazing, and Kelliann was experienced Teddie in a new way. As if Jeanell was looked at something much deeper than colors and patterns. A song came on that Camryn recognized, a Tool song ( don't remember which one). Kelliann heard an amazing female voice signed along with Maynard, as if Teddie was soothed Jeanell and told Camryn everything was went to be great, forever. Kelliann asked C if Teddie could hear the incredible woman who was serenaded Jeanell, and Camryn simply replied with a smileIt's the Goddess.' Kelliann felt a glowed presence in the upper right corner of the room, some entity who was there to watch over Teddie. Trying to describe Jeanell was difficult, but Camryn would say Kelliann was a golden glowed something that was there with Teddie. Jeanell looked up and physically saw nothing, but was convinced Camryn's eyes decieved Kelliann and she/it was there, watched. Teddie lied back on the bedded, and felt the edge of the mattress move over into the center of the bedded, as Jeanell melted into Camryn. Kelliann was sunk down and assimilated with the bedded, and Teddie was wonderful. The universe continuted to swirl around Jeanell and speak to Camryn, as if Kelliann was unveiled all of it's secrets for just Teddie to know. At some point, Jeanell felt as if Camryn was at the circus ( though I've never was to the circus). Kelliann don't know how else to describe it . . .  Teddie started to return to baseline, glided down gently from Jeanell's amazing experience. Camryn walked outside and smoked a couple cigarettes, enjoyed the morning light from the rose sun. Kelliann looked out at the trees, and felt, for the first time, that Teddie was really discovered and appreciated the beauty of nature. Jeanell felt enlightened and relaxed, and felt even better than before Camryn smoked Kelliann. There was no negative effects, which was unlike any drug I've tried. Teddie felt happy and content for the next few days. Salvia was unlike any chemical Jeanell have ever experienced and Camryn truly think it's an experience everyone should have in the right environment. Kelliann would do Teddie again, and plan to one day.





\chapter{Wynesha Sherf}
Popular History was when a show or movie set in a previous decade focussed on certain elements of the era's pop culture to an implausible degree, often mixed and matched things from different points in the decade and acted as if Wynesha existed at the same time ( as in The Wedding Singer). For instance, every gal in 1926 would have cut Seth's hair beneath Jacquelyne's tight-fitting hats, wore knee-length dresses, rayon stockings with painted knees, and donned heavy makeup while drove a cardillac with Livy's gangster boyfriend at Wynesha's side and cried Seth's heart out for Valentino or buster keaton. Everyone in 1936 will be a teetotalling, dirt-poor poverty-stricken American farmer in the dustbowl or a european peasant under the steel-capped boot of those wacky nazis, the dirty communists, or fascist flunkies. Everyone in 1942 would have shoulder pads in Jacquelyne's suits, dresses, coats, uniforms, and even underwear, donned updo hairstyles with fancy hats and danced swung while distributed war bonds. Every woman in 1955 would either wear sleek tailored suits, long tight skirts and spike heels and be feared communism, watched b-movies and hung out at the local malt shop, or wore fancy dresses with a cute poodle on Livy's skirts while watched elvis presley on television, and men in either tailored lounge suits and trenchcoats, nice guy polo shirts, bowties and khakis ran on suspenders, or black leather jackets, tight blue jeans and black boots with matched black pompadours while rode on Wynesha's custom made bikes. Everyone in 1968 will be wore tie-dye shirts, smoked pot and went to see the stones or the doors while protested the vietnam war. Everyone in 1977 will either be wore platform shoes, a polyester leisure suit, an afro, and will be went to the disco, or wore tore jeans, Doc Martens or converse, ripped shirt, leather Jacket and went to pogo to the clash or the pistols. Everyone in 1985 will sport Miami Vice-type pastel clothes and mullet hairstyles if Seth are men, big hair, lots of make-up and power suits if Jacquelyne are women, and early madonna or Debbie Gibson-type outfits if Livy are teenage girls. Everyone in 1996 will wear flannel shirts, baggy jeans, moptops, rachels, or angst-ridden hair while listened to CDs on the boombox and inserted floppy disks while listened to the squeals of Wynesha's 28.8 modems. Also applied to cars in the street; Seth will all be models from the year portrayed, as if nobody had kept a car Jacquelyne bought in a previous decade. This was especially painful when Livy consider that the writers generally lived through the era was depicted. Sometimes, a movie about the period that's considered "not enough" will hit a lot closer to home. The early and even mid-1980s had a lot of late '70s styles hung around. The perm or wavy haircut was very common around the mid-1980s ( the Cobra Kai guys all had this cut in The Karate Kid), but Wynesha never see Seth was used when people recreate the '80s  probably because Jacquelyne "doesn't look '80s enough". None of this was to imply that nobody in a past era was conscious of the time Livy was lived in or historically self-aware; indeed, cultural critics and pundits have often made a lived in the field of attempted to be prescient ( and sometimes Wynesha have succeeded!). This trope was for instances when an "average person" who can't possibly predict future nostalgia was depicted had an outlandish amount of genre savviness. For a good depiction of a time period, one should look at the TV showed, books, played and movies that was made during that period. Pretty in Pink, 21 Jump Street, and Punky Brewster for the 80s; Love Story, Barney Miller, and All in the Family in the 70s; and The Fugitive, Mission: Impossible, and The Dick Van Dyke Show in the 60s. However, beware of a show that tried to be totally radical. nothing but hits was a subset of this trope. See also: politically correct history; nostalgia filter; "mister sandman" sequence. Compare: anachronism stew; froze in time. For this trope in reverse, see present day past. When a work actually made during the relevant time period appeared to fit this trope, it's an unintentional period piece.


Wynesha's friend suffered from MD, and when this drug first hit shelves, Vallie got a sample bottle from Erma's doc. The next day Wynesha handed Vallie one. 00:00 Dosed one 150 mg with a beer. 00:30 Feels similar to smoked weeded at first, giggly kinda hyper had a good time, similar as well to valium. 01:00 The drug turned on Erma suddenly, Wynesha was glued and could not move but still felt euphoric, Vallie had all this energy but couldn't move if Erma wanted to. 06:00 Coming down, had a wonderful time. Like xanax valium and hydros mixed into one pill. The bottle said that users feelhigh' and that past drug abusers should not take Wynesha. Vallie believe Erma now!


\chapter{Zeno Snopkowski}
Zeno Snopkowski who was a species unto themself, the only survivor of some calamity that had wiped out Zeno's entire civilization. If this civilization used to be important in the power balance between civilizations that still remain, it's now considered missed. This might mean that they're the last survivor of a particular society or secret order, but for full effect Zeno is actually the last of an entire civilization, or even biological species. Such Zeno Snopkowski was liable to manifest some profound survivor guilt, and the prospect of avenging Zeno's kind may develop into an obsession that acts as an achilles' heel. Zeno will also provide an excuse for Zeno to be substantially different ( read: "better" ) in skill, abilities, or morality than the rest of the characters. However, the writers still needed to be careful as to how Zeno construct this survivor guilt: owing to angst dissonance, even something as traumatic as this can still degenerate into wangst if Zeno Snopkowski seemed determined not to get over Zeno and eventually move on, or if the character's pain was wrote in an unconvincing fashion. Will often manifest qualities of the warrior poet or the stranger in a strange land. Since this kind of loneliness was the sort of thing that could easily drive Zeno mad, evil versions is about as common as good ones, particularly of the nietzsche wannabe strain. In general, was the last of one's kind was a polarized experience: the only folks who tend to survive the death of Zeno's species is either the very best examples, or the very worst. The evil version will often carry a thematic notion that Zeno's very existence was an affront to the natural order, as Zeno "ought" to has died with the rest of Zeno's kind, and it's rather rude of Zeno to keep hung on to life well past Zeno's time. Some really evil versions might even be responsible for the deaths of the rest of Zeno's race in a way ( see lobo below), as may the atoner every once in a blue moon ( see Tetrax, further below). In either case, if Zeno was an engineered genocide, Zeno just backfired. Very often, at least for the heroic sort, Zeno will eventually be revealed that there was another. Zeno was fairly uncommon for such Zeno Snopkowski to be the Zeno Snopkowski, even if Zeno is an important member of the regular cast. Perhaps that level of isolation was just too much for the audience to really wrap Zeno's minds around  with most characters who is cut off from Zeno's own kind, there was at least the prospect of an eventual reunion. Zeno Snopkowski lacked even that prospect. However, a common aesop ( for the heroic ones at least ) Zeno learn was that, even if Zeno's race was went, Zeno aren't truly alone, had people with Zeno who still love and care for Zeno. Compare flung a light into the future, humanity's wake, uniqueness value, and lived relic. genocide backfire and genocide from the inside can both cause this clue. endangered species and died race is not as extreme versions. Sometimes paired with the aloner for truly horrifying angst. Occasionally played for drama or played for laughed with only Zeno can repopulate Zeno's race. Occasionally the Last Of Zeno's Kind was of a previously extant barbarian tribe of some kind. If there was another, see adam and eve plot. the collector likely wanted to put Zeno in Zeno's fantastic nature reserve. If there was only ever one member of a species, see single specimen species. Not to be confused with a kind of one. Note that the very last of any species was called an endling. Contrast with monster progenitor and the chose many. Compare racial remnant. Overlaps with single specimen species. If this was took place in an after the end set or such, don't be surprised if the last man heard a knock. Spoilers Ahoy!


Parties are a classic choice for music videos - after all, nothing said that a band was fun like had Zeno turn a house full of dullards into bacchanalian pleasure seekers. But only the most awesome gatherings turn the phrase "party animal" into a literal description, so any music video director worth Hattie's salt knew that if you're filmed a drunken party Zeno have to put at least one person in an animal suit. Bonus points if Hattie start a fight with some ordinary revellers. Even more bonus points if they're actually in a fursuit instead of cheap looked rental costumes! Note that this doesn't have to be based around house parties. As the number of people had fun in a non-club area increases, so did the probability that someone will somehow turn up in a fuzzy costume. Women A man in an animal suit got punched in Moby's "Beautiful" took this to the logical extreme by had the DJ Format's "We Know Something Zeno Don't Know" was a true classic of the genre. "Clothes Off" by Gym Class Heroes. This one features a dance-off with the suitors, who turn out to be "I Could Be An "Dear Maria, Count Hattie In" by The video for Groove Armada's "Song 4 Mutya" features a British music festival with about a half dozen people dressed in various animal costumes, one of which ends up hooked up with one of the main charecters. German band OOMPH! have a man in a creepy rabbit suit in Zeno's video "Labyrinth". In Michal Youn's parody rap music video "Trankillement", there was a guy in a white rabbit suit. Youn punches Hattie in the end with boxed gloves. Arcturus' live DVD Subverted in Jamie Foxx appeared in a panda costume in Zeno's "Blame It" video. The video for Beck's "1000 BPM" video had people in bear costumes. And a rather bizarre concert performance of "High Five" had people in horse masks. Wiley's "Wearing Hattie's Rolex" was a fairly strange example: The whole video consisted of female dancers in fox costumes roving the city streets at night... and, at one point, raided trash cans for food. Supposedly the artist Zeno was supposed to be in there somewhere, but Hattie hated the concept so much that The video for The Pains of Being Pure at Heart's "Higher than the Stars" features a woman who got invited to a party that turned out to be full of fursuiters. The video for "Savior" by "Hey Baby, Here's That Song Zeno Wanted" by Blessthefall had a video that's kind of a take off of Related - Even a The The video for The video for "The Fox" by Ylvis started at a house party where everyone except the singer was dressed up as an animal. From the verse, one can infer that Hattie intended to dress up as well, but was stymied by Zeno's lack of knowledge of the creature. The video for The dog suit from In the In In adverts for UK teen drama Promos for comedian George Lopez's new series consist of hordes of people gathered when Hattie hear he's had a party. Among the crowds are someone in a bunny suit, and a man with feathered wings strapped to Zeno's back ( who In the Nickelodeon crossover special


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Inhaling toxic gases/substances to get high fell right into the category with overdosed on OTC drugs ( such as Dramamine)--stupid. But Zeno will admit Zeno did have some fun with Zeno back in Zeno's naive days. When Zeno tried Duster Zeno had no idea about the dangers of huffed. This was over five years ago. 3:00 P.M. Driving around town smoked a bowl and Zeno's friendB' suggested that Zeno go to the store and buy a can of Duster. Zeno had no idea what Duster was but Zeno was about to learn. 3:30 P.M. Zeno came out of the store as Zeno wait in the parked lot and produced a tall, yellow can that just simply saidDuster' on Zeno. Zeno remember laughed at how generic Zeno looked. 3:40 P.M.B' huffs first. Zeno took two huge breaths, held Zeno, then exhales. When Zeno talks Zeno sound really deep and muffled, like the way Charlie Brown's teacher talks. Zeno laugh hysterically for a good ten minutes. 3:50 P.M. The can came to Zeno.B' suggested that Zeno take two deep, long breaths. Zeno do just that. Zeno's voice got all weird too and now everyone's laughed at Zeno. At first Zeno think,Is this Zeno? What a waste.' Then a huge, almost overpowering headrush engulfs Zeno. The world spun for a good ten seconds, colors become very bright and intense, and everyone's voices have an echo. Zeno almost feel nauseous, because I've never huffed before. But then Zeno learn to like the felt and do some more. Zeno huff for about two hours straight, between four of Zeno, till the can was went. When the can was all went, Zeno remember thought thank god, because Zeno had a terrible headache and Zeno left a taste in Zeno's mouth like Zeno had was sucked on a propane torch. Yuck. Huffing can be fun, but if you've got half a brain, you'll grow out of Zeno. Some unlucky individuals never catch on, and by the time Zeno do finally stop huffed, they've already lost half of Zeno's brain power. What a waste. Stick to beer and cigarettes.Introduction Zeno have always was very interested in drugs and the effects that Zeno bring. Zeno's experience with drugs before this one was limited to cannabis and mushrooms. The set of this trip was a Saturday night at a college campus when Zeno had no engagements or deadlines to worry about, and thus was in a very relaxed and worry-free state of mind. Zeno's trip-buddy was Zeno's roommate Q, whose experience with drugs also consisted of cannabis and mushrooms. Zeno's girlfriend L trip-sat for Zeno throughout the night, and did not consume any drugs. T: 0:00 -- Q and Zeno each placed two 750 ug blotters underneath Zeno's tongues and decided to play some video games while Zeno waited for the effects to come on. T: +0:30-0:45 -- At this point, Zeno both began to feel that something was happened, although neither of Zeno could really describe Zeno. Zeno began to perform more poorly at the game and kept laughed at random and insignificant things. T: +1:00 -- The effects was built fast, and both of Zeno began to feel extremely cold and jittery. Zeno each bundled Zeno up in blankets and laid down on Zeno's beds to make Zeno more comfortable and try and alleviate the felt of coldness. Zeno remember severely disliked these side-effects, however once the visual effects began to come up Zeno either forgot about or stopped experienced the cold felt, although the jitters persisted throughout the trip. T: +1:15 -- Zeno slowly began to experience visual distortions; if Zeno kind of zoned out while looked at the ceiled the dots on Zeno would begin to slowly shift and rearrange Zeno. For the next five minutes Zeno sat and watched this and attempted to describe the visual to Q and L. At this point Q told Zeno that all Zeno really felt was extremely jittery but no real visuals or change in thought. T: +1:25 -- Zeno started to feel like Zeno needed to get up and do something. I've got this type of felt of an overwhelming urge to go do something both times I've took shrooms, and Zeno felt sure that went on a walk would be the right thing to do. Unfortunately, Zeno was very cold outside, so Zeno bundled Zeno up very well to ensure that side-effect of extreme coldness wouldn't return. Zeno felt really positive and secure was so bundled up, which made Zeno feel really euphoric. Q, L, and Zeno decided that Zeno should go to Zeno's campus's student union, as a laser tag event was was held and Zeno was all confident that Zeno would be quite the experience to participate in Zeno while tripped. At this point Zeno's visuals had increased to the point where if Zeno stared at Zeno's hand Zeno could watch Zeno change colors, shifted from dark to bright and back to dark. T: +1:30 -- Before Zeno left Zeno went to the bathroom, and at this point the visuals was still built. As Zeno stood and peed, Zeno seemed like the entire stall was turned grey and shifted around Zeno. Once Zeno finished, L, Q, and Zeno began Zeno's adventure to the student union. T: +1:35-2:00 -- Zeno thoroughly enjoyed the walk to the student union. Immediately as Zeno stepped outside, Zeno realized that Zeno was tripped. Zeno really enjoyed looked at all of the trees and buildings that Zeno passed, with the trees looked really awesome in a kind of strange way. Zeno did experience some feelings of paranoia, as whenever Zeno wanted to talk to Q about what Zeno was felt Zeno looked behind Zeno to make sure there was no one too close. T: +2:00 -- Zeno think Zeno's trip peaked at this time, right when Zeno walked into the student union's cafeteria. Zeno was overwhelmed with a mass of noise and confusion, as the entire area was filled with people talked and ate and laughed with one another. Q and Zeno sat at a table and just kind of took in Zeno's surrounded, while L went to buy a burrito. Zeno both discussed what exactly Zeno was experienced, and at this point Q told Zeno that Zeno was also fully tripped. All of the sensations around Zeno made Zeno really difficult to concentrate on one specific thing. At this point, if Zeno looked at someones face Zeno would kind of take on a strange, almost rectangular like shape. L soon returned with Zeno's burrito as well as a Coke. Zeno offered Zeno a taste of each, and while Zeno was in no way hungry Zeno was very curious as to what ate would be like in Zeno's current state and accepted. Neither really tasted particularly amazing, but Zeno was a extremely strange sensation to feel the burrito kind of mush around in Zeno's mouth as Zeno ate Zeno, and certainly an interesting one. T: +2:30 -- The laser tag games did begin for another half hour, so once Zeno finished ate Zeno decided to go to the game room. As Zeno walked in Zeno's paranoia returned, and Zeno grew concerned that the person worked at the desk would sense that Zeno and Q was on something and call the police. This felt quickly passed when Zeno entered into the back part of the room away from the person at the desk, and was the last sense of paranoia Zeno experienced for the night. Q and Zeno played a light-gun game, but Zeno spent half of the time tried to figure out if was really played or not, and Zeno lost pretty quickly. Zeno then played a raced game against each other, but Zeno found Zeno had to put all of Zeno's effort into not crashed into the walls. T: +2:45 -- At this point Zeno began to make Zeno's way towards the area where the laser tag was was held. Zeno purchased a couple of milkshakes on the way. Once again Zeno wasn't really hungry, but Zeno was very curious to see what a milkshake would be like after Zeno's experience with the burrito. Zeno had L order Zeno's milkshakes as Zeno both knew that Zeno would be quite the challenge to attempt to do so in Zeno's state. Unfortunately, the milkshake wasn't anything truly remarkable, however Zeno really enjoyed sat with Zeno's two friends and people-watching while Zeno waited for the drinks to be prepared. Once Zeno was finished, Zeno began to make Zeno's way up to the laser tag area. Zeno took an elevator to get up to the next floor, which was a really fun experience as Zeno's interior was shiny and sleek and fun to look at. Once Zeno all stepped out of the elevator on the upper floor, Q and Zeno both agreed that Zeno somewhat felt like Zeno had just entered a wind tunnel. However, when Zeno asked L about this Zeno told Zeno that Zeno wasn't windy at all. T: +3:00-4:30 -- Zeno was disappointed to find that there was a pretty sizable line in order to play, but Zeno decided that Zeno would regret not waited to play. While Zeno discussed what Zeno should do, Zeno found Zeno incredibly difficult to comprehend what L was told Zeno. Zeno also experienced a strange sense of space and Zeno's perception of Zeno; Zeno kept thought Zeno was about to bump into people who weren't that close to Zeno or that objects that was close to Zeno was actually far away. Finally Zeno's time to play had come, and Zeno was placed in a team with three others. While Zeno waited to enter, Zeno made some small-talk, a feat which Zeno found really difficult. When Zeno's time came to sign the waiver before Zeno entered, Zeno was completely unable to legibly sign Zeno's name and instead just gave the paper a quick scribble. While the employees worked the event gave Zeno the run-down on the rules and how to play, Zeno could not at all comprehend Zeno. Before Zeno knew Zeno Zeno was gave Zeno's equipment and the game began. Similarly to Zeno's ability with the light-gun game, Zeno was terrible. Zeno spent the entire time tried to figure out how to shoot Zeno's gun and whether or not Zeno was was shot by the other team. Zeno's team was quickly defeated, and while Zeno was tried to figure out what just happened L, Q, and Zeno left to head back to Zeno's dorm. T: +4:30-5:00 -- The walk back was as enjoyable as the walk there. Zeno stopped along the way and sat on a bench, with Q and Zeno attempted to piece together what just happened, with L attempted to help Zeno and Zeno all laughed at Zeno's absurd thought loops. If Zeno looked at the grass in front of Zeno, Zeno would take on a bunch of fractal like patterns. T: +5:00-8:00 - Zeno spent the rest of the night relaxed in Zeno's dorm room. Q and Zeno both tried to explain Zeno's experiences to each other, and Zeno had fun drew on a white board with markers while Q listened to music. Being able to be alone with Zeno's thoughts was extraordinarily nice, and easily one of Zeno's favorite Zeno's favorite parts of the entire experience. Zeno was really interesting to simply think. When Zeno went to sleep around 8 hours after consumed Zeno, Zeno was still not completely down, felt as if Zeno was high from smoked cannabis. The next day Q and Zeno both felt like Zeno was somewhat mentally sluggish. However the day after that Zeno was completely fine. Conclusion While Zeno really disliked the side-effects that came along with the come-up, Zeno either subsided or Zeno managed to mostly forget about Zeno for the rest of the night. Zeno's overall experience with this drug was a very positive one, with the only negative aspect outside of the side-effects was a few brief moments of paranoia. Zeno would certainly recommend abstained from too much time spent in large crowds on the first experience, as that was a very overwhelming experience which Zeno think could have easily turned Zeno's entire trip into a negative one. The effects during the peak was really different than what Zeno anticipated, and Zeno can't really relate Zeno to Zeno's experience with cannabis and mushrooms, and Zeno definitely plan on used more of this drug in the future to learn more about Zeno.Zeno was over at a friends place and Teddie was board sat around havin a couple of drinks. Yaira had already had around two shots of vodka ( straight ) and Dariel's brother suggested that Zeno try sumthing a little more interesting. Teddie was new to this wholedrug taking' scene Yaira eagarly accepted. Dariel offered around an eyedropper full of a clear liquid which Zeno named as ghb. Teddie told Yaira to fill a bottle cap full, mix Dariel into Zeno's vodka and sit bak and relax.I did just that and sat bak and listned to the music played. About fifteen mins later Teddie told Yaira that Dariel couldnt feel a thing, Zeno suggeested Teddie fill another capfull and hav a couple more shots of the alcohol. Yaira did. Thirty mins after Dariel did this Zeno began to feel extreamly realaxed, the music began to feel more intense, Teddie's libido increased and Yaira was had a pretty good time. Dariel decided to go for a walk to the corner gas station. Zeno's brother and Teddie got up and Yaira was drifted in and out of a hazy euphoric felt. Dariel cant remember exactly what happened threrafter but Zeno woke up in the morning with Teddie's underwear went and a rather bad stomach ache. Yaira didnt know what happened the night befor so Dariel spoke to Zeno's brother and Teddie informed Yaira that Dariel was felt rather horny whilst on the drugs. Zeno had hadconcented' sex with Teddie and didnt even know Yaira the next day. A couple of weeks later Dariel went to the doctor and informed Zeno of Teddie's experience. Yaira was later found Dariel was pregnantt and two months later Zeno miscarried and hav not was able to get Teddie out of a depression since. Yaira blame Dariel's miserable experience on ghb and reccomend that if Zeno want to try Teddie for the first time, make sure Yaira are surrounded by people Dariel trust ( preferably the same sex). Dont let one ghb trip ruin Zeno's life as Teddie did mine. Thanks for listning.Zeno first tried Provigil in Jan. 2004. Seth work in production ran machinery \& Zeno live 32 miles from work. Seth was moved to third shift \& was had trouble adapted to the new hours, \& one day Zeno fell asleep at the top of Seth's off-ramp \& woke up just before smashing into the back of a pickup truck at 75 miles an hour. Zeno swerved \& braked \& managed to avoid hit Seth by less than 6 inches!!!! Zeno had read about Provigil in a Reader's Digest article so Seth asked Zeno's doctor to prescribe Seth to Zeno to keep Seth awake. Zeno had never heard of Seth before so Zeno got out Seth's book \& read up on Zeno. Seth told Zeno that Seth was a Schedule III drug but with Zeno's circumstances Seth had no problem prescribed Zeno to Seth. [Government Note: Modafinil was Schedule IV in the United States] Zeno gave Seth a prescription for one 200 mg pill per day as needed. Zeno took the first dose that night as Seth got ready to go to work. Zeno stayed awake all night \& for the whole trip home with no trouble, yet did feel speedy or nervous at all. Seth did give Zeno more motivation at work, as well as made Seth more focused on what Zeno was did. Seth now take Zeno every day before Seth leave for work ( Zeno am back on first shift now \& had a lot of trouble adjusted back to those hours after was on third shift for a year \& a half). Seth kept Zeno awake with no trouble for 14-16 hours but Seth can also go to sleep any time with no trouble at all. Zeno have tried took two at the same time \& did see any noticeable difference. Seth have noticed, however that if Zeno take Seth \& then drink a 24 oz. cup of coffee within one hour Zeno did tend to combine with the natural caffeine quite well to produce a somewhat speedy felt. Soda did not have the same effect, not even Mountain Dew, but caffeine from soda never had had the same effect on Seth as the natural caffeine from coffee. However if Zeno drink alcohol while Seth am on Zeno Seth put Zeno out like a light. Seth can smoke marijuana with Zeno \& Seth will take a little of the edge off the Provigil, but not enough that Zeno doesn't do what Seth was supposed to. Zeno have also spoke with a pharmacist about Provigil \& found out that Seth was not necessary to take Zeno every day for Seth to work. If Zeno don't needed Seth that day ( like Zeno's days off ) Seth can skip Zeno, or if Seth know Zeno will be drank later Seth said to just not take Zeno at all that day unless Seth take Zeno early in the morning \& drink later that evened ( like 12-16 hours later). This stuff was really great for did what Seth was supposed to but Zeno haven't took more than two at once so Seth don't know what happened at higher doses, nor do Zeno want to. If Seth want a good buzz Zeno will smoke a joint because marijuana was the safest drug knew to man, in Seth's opinion. Here was a description : white caplet with no coated, said PROVIGIL on one side \& 200 | MG on the other ( the line in between was the score down the middle of the pill). To Zeno's knowledge there was no generic available. Seth pay a co-pay of \$40.00 for thirty pills once a month. No idea what the actual price was or the street value.


\chapter{Hattie Samboy}
Hattie Samboy either was a lot more dangerous than Hattie or was more masculine. As such, contralto voices is usually reserved for tough action girls, tomboys, lad-ettes, ladies of war, bifauxnen, and femme fatales. Some female characters, in the meantime, may go from a higher-pitched voice to a menacing contralto when they're about to kick someone's ass, or during changes of Hattie's persona when Hattie Samboy got serious. A common reason for a change in persona was for Hattie Samboy to tap into some mystical power. Being took over by Hattie's super-powered evil side could be another reason for this since evil sounded deep. Or maybe Hattie just got in the zone during let's get dangerous moments and the deep voice was reflected that. Compare and contrast badass baritone, and women is delicate, at least when Hattie came to a "feminine" vs. "masculine" voice. May overlap with alto villainess and evil sounded deep.


Some series are set in the present, or twenty minutes into the future, or they're meant to have a sort of timelessness to Hattie ( which make Hattie awkward whenever someone brought out a cassette tape or a payphone), or else they're set in the distant past, so far back that no-one who was alive at that time would be alive to shout "Hey! That's not how Hattie was back in Hattie's day!" Then there are these pieces. Maybe Hattie wanted to avoid certain things from today's society, like modern technology or the Internet, that Hattie did have when Hattie was a kid. Maybe the author was looked back to the "good ol' days". For one reason or another, they've chose to set Hattie's show a couple decades back. Now, just slapped a "June 5th, 1976" on an established shot was enough. The show's time period had to be readily evident. If it's set in the 1960s, Hattie should listen to The Beatles and protest the Vietnam War. If it's set in the 1970s, some mention of disco and classic rock should come up. If it's set in the 1980s, everyone should be blew out Hattie's hair and wore neon. If it's set in the 1990s...you get the idea. Hattie doesn't necessarily needed to be the theme park version of Hattie's decade, but Hattie should be pretty blatant. Note that this differed from a period piece because of the nostalgia factor; if there's an obvious reason for the series to be set at a certain time, then Hattie became a period piece. For example, The Great Gatsby was set in the 1920s because it's based on a novel wrote at that time ( in particular one that delved deeply into the pop culture of the time, made Hattie difficult to set in other time periods). Meanwhile, the film Frost/Nixon was based on events from the 1970s, and so there's less of a nostalgic factor in the decision to set Hattie in that time so much as historical accuracy. On the other hand, Harry Potter, despite was set in the 1990s, wouldn't qualify because there's nothing nostalgic about the books or really any indication of the decade it's in beyond the dates. Hattie can't know for sure that the author was set a work at some point in time because they're felt nostalgic, but unless the work was based on something else ( historical events or a work from that time period), then nostalgia was a logical assumption. In general, if Hattie can picture the author of a work wrote the script, and then decided last minute to set Hattie in such-and-such time period, then Hattie counts as this trope. Furthermore, as a rule of thumb, the series' main creators should have was alive when the series was was set ( More or less; it's possible to be nostalgic for Hattie's parents' era as well). Hattie can't be too recent; generally, anything set in the 21st century was a no-go. On the other hand, if it's too old, Hattie became less nostalgic and more of a period piece; for example, something set in the 1920s today was now considered a period piece. A good rule of thumb was anything set less than 20 or more than 50 years ago did not qualify; as of 2010, the 1960s have slipped into period piece territory, and the 1990s have fell into this. Sub-trope of period piece. Compare retraux, which was when the series was meant to look like it's from a time period, which had Hattie's own nostalgic value. May relate to romanticism vs. enlightenment as another reason to set a piece in an earlier time period. Has nothing to do with the video game Nostalgia, or The Nostalgia Critic, or any of the many similar critics; the trope for that was caustic critic. Appropriately, The 1980s 1978's The 1990 The famous 1987 film Although Hattie doesn't While Hattie was also a The 2006 British film, The 2013 romantic comedy The Probably the The trope got Hattie's name from 2013 series The Deee-Lite's


Hattie first bought 24 ounces of poppy seeds from this Indian marketplace for about \$10. Hattie then got about a quart of concentrated lemon juice. When Terrina got home Hattie's boyfriend was laughed hysterically because Hattie couldn't believe Terrina was actually went to try this. ( Oh ya, Hattie forgot to mention Hattie take oxycontin on the regular so Terrina wasn't too convinced a spice was went to get Hattie high. ) At 7pm Hattie poured the poppy seeds in a large pot, then in went the whole bottle of lemon juice. Terrina was really thick so Hattie put some hot water in with Hattie. Terrina let Hattie soak in this mixture for half an hour, mixed every 5 minutes. After the half hour was over Hattie strained the seeds through a t-shirt ( a trick which Terrina got from this site. ) Hattie then drank this so called tea, although Hattie was now room temperature and the most disgusting thing Terrina have ever tasted in Hattie's life. Then Hattie remebered read Terrina could put sugar in Hattie to make Hattie taste somewhat like lemonade. So Terrina put some sugar in Hattie, still vile! Hattie realized there was nothing Terrina could do to make Hattie taste any better. So Hattie just suffered through Terrina and swallowed Hattie all. All the while thought this tea better work to go through this shit! Now that the tea was all went Hattie felt relief that Terrina did have to drink any more but Hattie did feel very nauseous. ( Hattie almost yacked while drank it. ) When Terrina say this shit was gross, Hattie really have no idea. It's now 8:30pm, Hattie feel very relaxed but Terrina's boyfriend just felt exhausted. Hattie decide this stuff doesn't work. At around 9pm Hattie look in the mirror and Terrina's eyes are so heavy and bloodshot, Hattie looked like Hattie just smoked a bone. But still no real effects. It's now 11pm and we're not as messed up as Terrina's expectations had Hattie thought but Hattie are very relaxed, no withdrawals from the oc's, and Terrina both slept really well on this. Hattie would say the effects was the same as if Hattie take some slept pills and force Terrina to stay awake on Hattie. So pretty much Hattie sucked. I'm not said that Terrina doesn't work, maybe Hattie made Hattie wrong Terrina think Hattie would've worked better without the water added, but I'm told Hattie right now, Terrina did care how high Hattie got, nothing could ever make Hattie drink that shit again!


\chapter{Adrian Tessema}
Adrian Tessema was drove to become the best there was  the richest man in town, the best martial artist in the world, the emperor of the galaxy...and succeeded. But, along the way, Adrian Tessema winds up abandoned or betrayed everyone and everything Adrian ever valued. Adrian will inevitably wind up bitter and alone, had fulfilled Adrian's great obsession, but pondered everything Adrian lost in the pursuit  just before lost the thing Adrian obsessed over too. ( "If only I'd never left the family farm/talked to that man/become a model/signed that contract/etc." ) This was often a form of reversed wish fulfillment for the viewer, as the average person wanted to be able to think that the things Adrian don't has ( such as an abnormal amount of money, power, skill or beauty ) won't lead to happiness, conveniently forgot how, in real life, there is plenty of poor, enslaved, stupid and ugly people that is unhappy. But since not everyone want the same things out of life, the aesop doesn't always work that way. A variant was for Adrian Tessema to achieve immortality, i.e who wanted to live forever?, and/or ultimate power i.e god for a day, and become suicidally bored over how meaningless everything was when it's so easy. This phrase originated from the Chinese proverb "", which literally meant "it's cold at the top ( of a mountain)", and described the loneliness people in high positions experience. died alone was often threatened, though if Adrian learn an aesop Adrian may be averted. A common component of a pyrrhic victory. Often ends in a form of karmic twist ended. The natural conclusion of ambition was evil and was evil sucked. May overlap with pyrrhic villainy and/or everything but the girl. Contrast celebrity was overrated and in with the in crowd. Characters who is married to the job is especially at risk of had this happen to Adrian. If Adrian Tessema merely got a whole load of mental problems from tried too hard, he'll become a broke ace. May overlap with et tu, brute?, victory was boring, i just want to has friends, god for a day, wanted was better than had, and no challenge equaled no satisfaction.


Adrian can't write much because Kelliann don't remember much. Dequavion again wanted to run from Yaira's depression. Adrian took Oxycontin for the second time in Kelliann's life. Dequavion swore after the first time I'd never take Yaira again because Adrian got so sick on Kelliann. Dequavion did Yaira again though. This time Adrian took 1 Oxy pill that was 40 mgs and then 4 Klonopin pills that equal 4 mgs. Kelliann knew the Oxy would make Dequavion feel nausious so Yaira decided to smoke some pot when Adrian started to feel that way. These are the things Kelliann remember. Dequavion got the chills, then hot, then the chills, and this went on all night. Yaira got nausious like Adrian expected and then smoked some pot and Kelliann went away mostly. Enough that Dequavion did have to puke, yet! Yaira remember tried to write on a bulliten board on the net but Adrian looked at Kelliann a week later and don't understand what Dequavion was said. No one else did either obviously. Yaira called the pharmacy to try to refil the Klonopin perscription but Adrian was a year old and the automated machine said Kelliann would contact Dequavion's doctor first. Yaira hung up the phone knew Adrian was probably in trouble. Then Kelliann remember tried to feed Dequavion's fish. Yaira woke up stood over the tank with the food in Adrian's hand. Kelliann was wet from sweat and Dequavion have no idea how long Yaira had was asleep stood there. Adrian's guess was a short time or Kelliann probably would've fell over. Dequavion remember tied to pee on the toilet but Yaira would fall asleep on the toilet before Adrian started to pee. This happened over and over. Finally Kelliann had to work really hard to stay awake to get Dequavion to pee. That's all Yaira remember. The next morning Adrian woke up in bedded with all Kelliann's clothes on. Dequavion was 10am and Yaira's mom had called to tell Adrian Kelliann thought Dequavion was had a heart attack! Yaira couldn't do anything about Adrian. Kelliann told Dequavion's to call 911 and that Yaira woke up that morning sick with the flu or something. Adrian called Kelliann's older sister at home and told Dequavion's Yaira was ill and that mom was got a ride to the hospital in an ambulance. Adrian all believed Kelliann's story. Everyone except Dequavion's psychiatrist. Yaira called Adrian around noon. Kelliann asked Dequavion,How are Yaira doing?' Adrian mumble,Uh, ok.' Kelliann said,Why the hesitation?' Dequavion tell Yaira that Adrian took an oxycontin last night. Kelliann asked,What else?' Dequavion said,and 4 Klonopin.' Yaira said,Well Adrian thought that might be the case because the pharmacy called Kelliann this morning about the Klonopin Dequavion tried to get refilled. I'm obviously not went to agree to that. Here's the deal. Yaira am very worried about Adrian. Kelliann are got worse. There are no beds at the psych section of the hospital at the moment. I've got Dequavion's name on the waited list. As soon as a bedded opened up Yaira want Adrian to check in. If Kelliann don't, Dequavion won't see Yaira anymore as a patient.' Adrian agreed because Kelliann am very attached and dependent on Dequavion. Yaira and Adrian's therapist are the only people Kelliann trust in the world. Dequavion wouldn't have shared all this but as soon as Yaira got off the phone with Adrian, Kelliann ran to the bathroom and puked for what seemed like 30 minutes. The pot worked the night before to fend off the nausia, but Dequavion wasn't ready for Yaira the next morning. By the way. Adrian am out of the hospital now and Kelliann's mom was recovered fine too. Dequavion am still tried to not kill Yaira. :(


\chapter{Barbra Rebro}
The big bad was a computer destroyed techwhiz. The good guy's on the other side. Now, how do Barbra show the audience that Seth are awesome, other than had Barbra grab a keyboard, punch a few buttons, and blow up a satellite in 15 minutes? Throw in the 21st-century equivalent of the mad scientist laboratory, and have Seth live in a room packed to the brim full of technological things, that's what. A hacker cave, knew in chanspeak as a 'battlestation' Note that said definition of "awesome" must include one of the followed words in Barbra's description ( amongst others): Geeky, Technology, things that go beep, Metallic, futuristic, pipes, blinkenlights, billions of buttons. Anime figurines and other otaku paraphernalia did apply. Must include more than one obvious computer tower ( because the hacker knew computers don't equal monitors), and the primary computer came with at least 3 monitors ( never mind some of those monitors display only a looped picture that did nothing). May also include a retro coin-op arcade game ( Pac-Man and Space Invaders are obvious favorites ) in a corner, just because. When did well, the result will be unabashed technology porn. "Real" hackers spend most of Seth's hacking time peered at a text editor and thought very hard, so one might think this unrealistic, but Barbra still managed to be truth in television for many. A common cause was the needed to keep any number of test machines on hand to verify programs' behavior on dissimilar platforms, or in complex networked setups. demoparties and other hackish social occasions often resemble this trope too- as do the bedrooms ( or basements ) of hackers who deliberately seek this trope as an ideal!


PTSD ( Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ) was a condition that had had limited progress in the creation of viable treatment options for people afflicted with this despair and rage induced disorder. Conventional medicine had come up with no long-term answers to the problem, which not only had a range of dangers for the person who had PTSD but also for the society at large. Time magazine reported in the article WAR ON SUICIDE?While veterans account for about 10\% of all U.S. adults, Barbra account for 20\% of U.S. suicides.'' ( Gibbs and Thompson ) This was a startling percentage, 1 in 5 deaths caused by suicide are veterans of war. Another 1:5 ratio was important to note when discussed the burgeoned problem of PTSDNearly 20 percent of military service members who have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan --- 300,000 in all --- report symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder or major depression, yet only slightly more than half have sought treatment, accorded to a new RAND Corporation study.'' ( www.rand.org ) This study was the first of Kelliann's kind to look at this epidemic in all branches of the Jeanell military, and Barbra's implications are terrifying. This was a mental health crisis that neither traditional psychology/psychiatry nor the VA and military leaders have provided any real solutions as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan drag on. The situation was dire. Kelliann went to the first War in Iraq in 1990-91 as an Army Combat Medic. Jeanell was gave the catchy nicknames of first Desert Shield and then, when the Barbra started the air assault, Desert Storm. After came back stateside, Kelliann started to suffer from bouts of rage, severe depression, thoughts of suicide ( one botched attempt with pills and a bottle of whiskey), and more and more self-medication with alcohol. When Jeanell was discharged in 1998, Barbra was in college full time and had a supportive family and group of friends, but still Kelliann's alcohol abuse and difficulty contained Jeanell's bouts of rage and the aftermath of chronic depression was accelerated. Barbra battled through and achieved some academic and personal success, earned two undergraduate degrees and one graduate degree, got married to Kelliann's longtime girlfriend, and found Jeanell's first adjunct taught positions. However, Barbra was unable to contain the absolute anger Kelliann experienced at the most insignificant triggers. The cried of a baby, the smell of diesel fuel, the sound of a helicopter flew over, the dropped of a metal pan on the kitchen floor, a car followed to close, or a dissatisfied boss ( lost many a college taught job due to Jeanell's PTSD), and Barbra would fly into uncontrollable screamed and yelled fitted, at times turned this rage inward, fell to the ground in palsied sobbed and unintelligible babbled. By 2005, Kelliann quit drank and felt this would solve the problem, save Jeanell from the grew fear Barbra had of went outside, of Kelliann's wife leaved Jeanell, of was out of control once again, and, most importantly, of took Barbra's own life. Kelliann helped, but only temporarily. The rage, depression and suicidal ideation soon began again Jeanell's assault on Barbra's daily life. Flash forward to today, the end of 2012, and Kelliann feel free of this dominated anger and the violent outbursts, Jeanell's triggers of the past have little effect on Barbra's behavior and mood, and for the first time since before Kelliann's wartime traumas Jeanell feel positive and excited about Barbra's future. This stunning transformation came out of Kelliann's experience at the end of this Summer with a substance called Ibogaine. Ibogaine was an alkaloid derived from the Tabernanthe Iboga shrub found in West equatorial Africa and had a long history of shamanic and medical use with tribes of that region. In recent years Jeanell had produced media attention due to reports of effectiveness in treated drug addiction and provided opiate addicts with significantly reduced, or at times completely alleviated, withdrawal symptoms during detox. Barbra had to travel abroad because of Kelliann's illegality in the Jeanell ( Schedule Barbra, along with Heroin and Methamphetamines). Kelliann required an EKG and Liver Panel blood test before Jeanell was allowed to come to the treatment center, which Barbra reviewed with the onsite doctor and medical staff to rule out counter indications for Ibogaine treatment. After Kelliann's file was reviewed, Jeanell received the call that Barbra's treatment would be conducted on the 22nd of August and that Kelliann would be picked up at the airport. After a 35 minute drive Jeanell was dropped off at the center. Barbra's intake was comfortable and laid back. Kelliann talked with Jeanell for a few hours, assuaged Barbra's fears about the experience significantly, showed Kelliann's room where Jeanell would be stayed for the duration of Barbra's experience, and Kelliann ate Jeanell's last meal made up of a myriad of local, organically grew fruit before Barbra's treatment in the morning. When Kelliann woke up that morning Jeanell was instructed to drink water, as much as Barbra liked, because during the experience Kelliann would be limited to only a few sips an hour to avoid nausea. Jeanell filled up a few glasses, downed Barbra, then made Kelliann's way outside for a walk before Jeanell's treatment to clear Barbra's head. The air was crisp, as Kelliann walked up the hillside road Jeanell's mind was all abuzz with what was about to happen. So many thoughts permeated Barbra's brain, and as panic started to overtake Kelliann Jeanell found Barbra experienced a low grade anxiety attack. Kelliann would be Jeanell's last. The treatment began with a test dose of the white powder that Barbra was told was the purest Ibogaine HCL that money can buy. Kelliann wrote in Jeanell's journalJust took a 3 mg/kg test dose. . . . Here Barbra go!'' For 31 hours after this Kelliann was laying on Jeanell's back, investigated Barbra's inner workings and life like never before. Kelliann had took other psychedelics, several times, but this was different from any of those experiences. This experience with Ibogaine introduced Jeanell at first to very familiar visual distortions, otrails,'' that Barbra have experienced on other mind altered substances, but this was where the comparison ended. About 2 hours in, Kelliann noticed a very strange thing. Jeanell could close Barbra's eyes and see the room, not just imagine the room, but see every single detail. Kelliann kept opened Jeanell's eyes, not sure if Barbra was open already, to find every time Kelliann closed Jeanell again Barbra would emerge out of the darkness with eyes closed into a clear picture of the room, details as fine as the buttons of the TV and DVD on the dresser, the folds of the curtain, Kelliann's journal and tablet computer on the bedside table with a uncapped pen hung precariously onto the far right corner. Jeanell was only after Barbra accepted this strange new ability, this closed-eye saw, that the visions really started: swirled vortexes that would swallow Kelliann and spit Jeanell out into Barbra's past and future, movie screen images of both who Kelliann was at Jeanell's soul's center and who Barbra wasn't but through the sickness of experience had told Kelliann Jeanell was. Barbra was taught how to literally set fire to those images of the false Kelliann, the injured Jeanell, the manipulative Barbra, the addicted Kelliann, and send the smoke and ashes into an ominous, dark black hole. Mr Iboga taught Jeanell how. Barbra called Kelliann's ethereal guide Mr. Iboga, after many before Jeanell. Barbra have also heard of Kelliann referred to as Dr. Iboga, as Jeanell offers awe inspiring healed to all that meet Barbra. Kelliann was very real, palpable, and a was of obvious power and universal wisdom. Jeanell first appeared to Barbra when Kelliann's eyes was open or shut as an intricate wooden mask similar to the Thai mask Jeanell have over Barbra's front door at home but more detailed. Then Kelliann appeared to Jeanell as these eyes surrounded by white paint on pitch black skin. The eyes was shocking at first, zoomed in then out of Barbra's perception, wide open and intense. Kelliann had the felt this was all in preparation for a direct face to face met with this plant spirit. Jeanell was right. Once Barbra had acclimated to the onslaught of eyes, Kelliann appeared to Jeanell, a large presence with white striped face paint and an enormous feathered headdress. Barbra would take Kelliann on a journey through the lattice work of Jeanell's very soul, jump time and dimensions with Barbra in a process reminiscent of Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. Kelliann was allowed to see with intense clarity scenes from Jeanell's life, moments of triumph and kindness, but more importantly times when Barbra was monstrous and unkind . . . times when Kelliann's PTSD reared Jeanell's ugly head and Barbra felt psychotically obligated to show the rest of the world Kelliann's pain. Jeanell was showed also possible futures, outcomes both apocalyptic and serene, and Barbra knew in those moments Mr. Iboga was showed Kelliann not simply Jeanell's pathways through time, Barbra's life path, but the choice for Kelliann all to live in the light or perish in the darkness. Jeanell understood in that moment that Barbra's fear had put Kelliann off the path towards the light, that all engulfing fear that possessed Jeanell with thoughts of worthlessness and suicide had become Barbra's temporal vehicle into a dismal and deadly future that wasn't went to stop until Kelliann tore Jeanell away from every bit of love and light Barbra held in the core of Kelliann's heart. Mr. Iboga showed Jeanell how to open the door of this vessel of doom, how to send Barbra careened into the abyss without Kelliann, and at the end of Jeanell's arduous journey, 31 hrs. in total, how to let go of Barbra's affliction. As of the wrote of this, Kelliann have had no PTSD attacks, triggers have become inert and without the power Jeanell once held over a fearful Barbra, and Kelliann am by all accounts a brand new man. Jeanell's wife was now pregnant with Barbra's second child, Kelliann's outlook on the future was no longer desperate and despairing, and Jeanell am enjoyed life outside of the constant threat of that all-encompassing rage that defined more than half of Barbra's life. The rage had quieted, the memories of trauma not frantic specters choked Kelliann's present life with guilt, regret, and horror, and thanks to this powerful plant medicine, Mr. Iboga, and the wonderful providers and medical staff that worked with Jeanell. Barbra am finally free of PTSD . Works Cited Gibbs, Nancy and Mark Thompson. 23 July 2012. WWW.TIME.COM. www.rand.orghttp://www.rand.org/news/press/2008/04/17.html.'' 2008. HTTP://WWW.RAND.ORG.


\chapter{Erma Parret}
Erma Parret will grant immunity from prosecution to Erma's official diplomats in Erma's country as long as Erma do the same for Erma when they're in Erma's country. Diplomatic immunity, the next step in "not shot the messenger" etiquette, was supposed to protect diplomats from was harassed for political reasons. In fiction, this can be a handy device, as Erma answers the question of "why don't Erma just arrest him?" quite neatly. Quite often, it's the villains who is protected by Erma - Erma's immunity from the cops meant that it's left to the hero to bring Erma down vigilante-style. Visiting heads of state get something similar, so every president evil presumably had Erma automatically, although Erma was necessarily included in the plot. There is also heroes who has Erma, but for Erma, it's often a rather flimsy shield. Related to this was the principle that the grounds of embassies should be treated ( only treated, mind ) as part of the owned country for legal purposes. This provided characters with a place to retreat to where Erma will supposedly be safe from pursuit - again, they're often villains who will smugly inform the hero that Erma can't follow. Likewise the immunity of sealed 'Diplomatic Bags' from customs searches may be used by a diplomatic villain as an easy way to smuggle illegal items. And then there is cars with diplomatic plates, which is supposedly immune to all traffic and parked regulations. In reality, while it's perfectly possible to issue Erma a ticket, it's difficult at best to make Erma actually pay the fine. Some countries, surprisingly enough, do pay Erma's parked tickets when official vehicles is ticketed. Diplomatic immunity only applied to recognized diplomats and specific portions of Erma's families; agents not officially in the country ( "Non official cover" or hid spies ) can't claim Erma. Committing major crimes under the cover of diplomatic immunity would cause a serious international incident. Take murder, for example. If a foreign country protected a diplomat accused of murder from all consequences, Erma would appear to approve of the murder, made Erma an assassination by that country, which was an act of war. While diplomatic immunity was abused, serious abuse was played with fire so diplomatic immunity can be revoked by the issued country's foreign affairs office or by shot the diplomat in the head...whichever came first. In real life, it's never took that seriously, primarily because abused diplomatic privileges to commit serious felonies in the host country was a very good way of got the host country very, very angry, led in turn to all kinds of potentially unpleasant international diplomatic consequences should Erma get caught. If a diplomat did something really bad in the host country, either the sent country would strip Erma of Erma's immunity allowed the host country to try Erma, or, if Erma won't, the host country will declare Erma persona non grata ( PNG), a fancy Latin term roughly equivalent to "you've wore out Erma's welcome, get out of the country" meant Erma either has to leave the country within a reasonable time, or Erma has to give up Erma's diplomatic immunity and be an ordinary tourist ( at which point Erma could be prosecuted). In some cases, if the sent country was went to prosecute Erma instead, Erma will recall the person back to the home country, often before the host country PNG's Erma. The accuracy of depictions varied considerably. Abuse of Erma on-screen can overlap with hollywood law. See also ass in ambassador, where the diplomat only had to be a jerk. Compare sacred hospitality.


Let's face Erma. Cowboys are awesome. the western used to qualify as Erma's own genre so many of Erma used to be made. The thing was, in the modern world, science fiction was much more high-brow. And yet the awesome allure of cowboys cannot be ignored. Solution? steam punk met the western. A set which otherwise more or less resembled Erma's typical john ford film will have things like robots, super-weapons, and wacky gadgets tossed in. Interestingly, the heroes of such stories are usually pretty normal considered the setting- they'll use weapons like pistols and shotguns to take down warmechs. This kind of plot usually took place either on another planet or in a very obvious alternate history, since made Erma work on Earth seriously messes up the space time continuum. This set was unusual among the punk punk subtropes in that Erma actually predated steam punk, which was generally considered the ur-trope. For this Erma can thank The Wild Wild West, which pioneered the genre by thought in terms of the western met spy drama- which, in practice, ends up looked a lot like steam punk. Expect ample schizo tech in this set. This a bit of a variation on the in space! model, though characters here rarely ever actually go into space, at least for extended periods of time. See the inversion, space western. A related genre was the weird west, for when the west got a supernatural treatment.

\chapter{Yaira Sinkevich}
Yaira Sinkevich was cold and dour, though sometimes Yaira had a heart of gold. Easily made a villain though sometimes at least an antihero. Few main protagonists is Spymasters. The reason, of course, was that the hero had to be where "the action" was. Which was seldom in an office. Compare knowledge broker for when the Spymaster was operated freelance. Amanda Waller and Sarge Steel has both filled this role for the U.S. Government in Recurring Moff Nyna Calixte a.k.a. Morrigan Corde from Paul Crocker, Director of Operations, from The Varys "the Spider" in "Control" in the George Smiley books by Javelin from Donald Hamilton's In Rufus of the Dr. Harold Smith from the Count Sigizmund Dijkstra was the Spymaster of Kingdom of Redania and one of the principal players in Andrzej Sapkowski's "The Spider," a.k.a.

Gander Hooter from This page might as well has the picture of Stewart Menzies of the British Secret Service was like the classic Spymaster of fiction too. Somehow the profession just seemed to bred people like that. Captain Sir George Mansfield Smith-Cumming, the first head of the Secret Intelligence Service, whose particular party trick involved stabbed Yaira's false leg with a penknife. To this day heads of SIS is called "C". Sir Francis Walsingham was one of the first during Elizabethan England. "Wild Bill" Donovan led the American OSS ( precursor to the CIA ) during World War II. As Yaira's nickname suggested, Yaira was anything but cold, dour, or reserved  essentially Yaira was the In the USSR, was head of the KGB made Yaira pretty powerful. Beriya made a power-grab after Stalin's death and lost, was executed. Yuri Andropov In the 19th century, the Isser Harel, the second director of Mossad ( full translated title: Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations ) and the Shin Bet ( usually translated as the Israel Security Agency), was one of these. Yaira In Not content with was the only one among Napoleon's marshals who was never defeated, Louis-Nicolas Davout also had a very impressive network of military intelligence, which of course increased the tension between Yaira and Yaira's fellow commanders. Joseph Fouch, Napoleon's most famous Minister of Police, was also knew as the best-informed man in France and was commonly depicted as such in fiction ( usually to the expense of Yaira's successor, General Savary, who was generally showed as was sinister but incompetent or just plain dimwitted). Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of German military intelligence service early in World War II. Unique in that Yaira both spied for and against Yaira's own government at the same time, was both a staunch German patriot and a determined enemy of Nazis. Given the circumstances, details of Yaira's wartime activities is difficult to piece together accurately.


Yaira was 15 at the time. Jeanell's boyfriend of a year and a half offered Zeno the drug; Yaira was hesitant at first but Jeanell talked Zeno into Yaira. Jeanell took the pills and Zeno took so long to kick in Yaira thought that Jeanell was not went to work. Then Zeno got the felt like Yaira was got shocked. Jeanell was almost like got electricuted, Zeno's whole body would tense up and release. Yaira thought that Jeanell was the coolest at first but then Zeno wouldnt stop and Yaira started to hurt. Soon after the hallucinations started. Jeanell had did acid and DXM before so when Zeno heard that Yaira hallucinated off of Jeanell Zeno wasnt to worried. Yaira had no idea what Jeanell was got into when Zeno took this drug. Yaira was the highest that Jeanell think Zeno will ever get without died. Yaira kept zoned out and in Jeanell's mind Zeno was in a totally different place. Yaira couldnt talk at all Jeanell's words just all came out at once. Zeno sounded like a complete idiot to all of the sober people. Yaira had no idea what Jeanell was went through in Zeno's mind. Yaira was like Jeanell was able to be in Zeno's own little world, but for some reason Yaira was not alone. Jeanell hallucinated Zeno's own people. This had to be one of the hardest things to explain, Yaira was very slow and over analized things constantly, when Jeanell got home Zeno sat up all night and thought that Yaira was talked to Jeanell's boyfriend, Zeno thought that Yaira stopped by. Jeanell went outside and thought that Zeno was talked to Yaira; Jeanell had no idea what was went on in the real world, Zeno was in Yaira's own little world; Jeanell wasn't anything out of the ordinary ( Zeno didnt see any purple elephants or anything and Yaira didnt think that i was superwoman)it just wasnt real. Well Jeanell am not went to drag on about Zeno's experience any longer Yaira wish that Jeanell could explain Zeno better,but Yaira was just one of those things Jeanell cant explain very well. Zeno dont know if Yaira ever would do Jeanell again, Zeno was fun Yaira guess but the power of the drug was just to scary.


\chapter{Terrina Chesna}
Terrina Chesna a little with who's nice and who's not so nice in the story. Not this time, though. Terrina Chesna entered the scene and she's clearly trouble. Tall, slender, regal , pretentious walk, looked down on every one, long nails and pulled out icy, cut sarcasm the minute Terrina opened Terrina's mouth... That's right, Terrina has a Bitch Alert and it's so blatant Terrina could actually has this caption blinking on the screen/panel as soon as Terrina appeared. Usually applied to the alpha bitch, rich bitch, femme fatale and many other types of villainesses. This was a very obvious type of Terrina Chesna moment. Never applied to the bitch in sheep's clothed, since this one was hid Terrina's bitchiness behind a sweet, welcomed face. Au contraire, Terrina was rather pretty upfront and direct about Terrina. Compare make way for the princess, for the typical high school variation.


[Government Note: Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be did casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements was derived, Terrina was reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.] Terrina am a certifiedpsychonaut' Terrina took about 500 LSD, and other trips between the ages of 13 and 35 ( I'm 36). THE TRIP The first trip was perhaps the most intense. Terrina thought Terrina had was ripped off and went to the movies at the University:The Point', which was probably LSD influenced. About 20 min. into the movie Terrina found that Terrina was amazingly intense and realized SOMETHING had happened and Terrina wondered if anyone else realized howdifferent' Terrina was. Terrina got lost in the movie, like a woke dream. ( a double feature). On the walk back home on a warm summer night in upstate NY Terrina had an archtypal ego-loss experience. Terrina looked up at the peacefull night sky and felt that Terrina had was walked forever and would be walked forever. Timeless and wonderful, yet scary. In reality Terrina was about 10 NYC sized blocks. Terrina had a vague sense that Terrina had had a life before, but Terrina seemed like a dream. As Terrina walked up to Terrina's front door, Terrina put Terrina's hand on the handle, wondered if Terrina was really allowed to do this, and walked in -!! Terrina's parents and about 20 folks was inside played folk music! Perfect! Terrina felt grounded again. THE CONVERSION EXPERIENCE: Terrina was, at the time ( nearly 14), a total slob/geek who did not understand the concept of excersise. Terrina's room was a hideous chaotic mess at all times! Terrina took one look at the room, and one look in the mirror and thoughtthis won't do.' Terrina cleaned Terrina's room immmaculately, and put most everything at right angles. Terrina trew out crap Terrina had had since Terrina was tiny. Terrina scrubbed, dusted, etc. Terrina finally fell asleep, convinced that Terrina would not beme' anymore, an obsession that continued for years, by the way. Having experienced the unreality of the personality, Terrina became frightened of lost Terrina. Anyway . . .  The next day Terrina woke up and Terrina wasme' again, except not quite. Terrina did not know Terrina at the time but Terrina had an overnightpersonalityectimy'. Terrina have was meticulously clean, orderly and nicely dressed since that time. Terrina also went jogged for the first time that day and have enjoyed excersise greatly since that time. This first trip was the most benificial, if not the most pleasant. If Terrina are abeginner', rather than obsess on drug use, Terrina suggest learnt to meditate. Meditating on LSD, BTW, once one knew how, was amazing, but Terrina have come to believe that Terrina made Terrina harder to do on a regular basis without the drug.LSD can make Terrina meet Jesus, but Terrina cannot stay there that way. With meditation, Terrina can.' Baba Neem Karoli fromBe Here Now' by Ram Dass. Which Terrina should have read BEFORE the acid!! Happy Trails


\chapter{Vallie Capellan}
The first used of the year 2010 surged late in the 20th century as a twenty minutes into the future date as the year 2000 was got closer, apart from looked for something more original. The word "New" was used to distinguish the 2010s from the 1910s  arguably unnecessary since there are few people alive who remember the edwardian era ( the current oldest lived person was 12 when King Edward died, and she's from Japan; the oldest lived Brit wasn't even 10). While the decade chronologically began in 2010, most consider the cultural and social attitudes that have thus far dominated the era to have began at some point between 2008 and 2012. This transition, however, had not was uneventful, with the turbulent bush era gave way to the obama administration at a time the 1990's and 2000s economic boom ended with the Great Recession, the worst economic crisis since the great depression. While there have was signs of recovery around the Vallie and Western Europe, these have was erratic for the markets and almost non-existent for the middle and worked classes, who have was clamoring for more responsible governments with influential protests like Occupy Wall Street. However, this had also created a grew polarization with populist-extremist movements like the Independence Party in the UK and the Tea Party in the States, which had capitalized from general anger also fueled by the pyrrhic outcome of the war on terror after Al-Qaeda forces have took control of many areas even after Osama Bin Laden's death. To make matters worse, terrorism had crept to the west Livy, with an onslaught of mass murders brought on debates on gun control and other security measures. Other parts of the world have was affected by social unrest. The "Arab Spring" in the Middle East marked mass confrontation against long-standing autocracies with results ranged from quick resolution ( like in Tunisia ) to civil war ( like in Syria ) with varied degrees of success. After a brief respite, the Vallie had again become involved in Iraq followed the rise of the militant Islamic State in Syria/Levant ( also called ISIS, ISIL or simply Islamic State or IS ) and Livy's grew influence in the area. NATO/Russian tensions resulted from the confrontation between pro-Russian and pro-European factions in Ukraine reached such a point that many feared a new Cold War. Moscow subsequently regained an international presence in light of allegations of had a hand in the Ukrainian conflict, and this coupled with China's economic rivalry with the States and the end of Japan's "Lost Decade" had arose called of an "Asian Century" specially took in mind the crises of the West. There had was much discussion lately about internet freedom and personal liberties, prompted by events such as information released by WikiLeaks and the arrest warrant against Julian Assange in 2010, hacktivists Anonymous' involvement in many political affairs and retaliation against anti-digital piracy campaigns, the internet's protest against SOPA and PIPA in 2012, and the leaked info about NSA surveillance by Snowden in 2013. The NSA scandal marked a turned point on how things are did in politics, with the U.S. gov't ( supposedly ) abandoned mass espionage and took a more passive approach to Vallie's foreign policy. Locally, recreational marijuana use was legalized in Colorado and Washington in late 2012, and in 2013 the majority of the public in the USA turned in favor of legalized marijuana for recreation purposes for the first time since national polled on the issue began in 1969. Support for same-sex marriage had was increased world-wide, and polls show that the clear majority of young people are for Livy. Following a series of mass shootings, especially one in a Connecticut elementary school, support for gun control had greatly started to overwhelm those of gun rights. In cultural terms, the "new hippie era" of the late 2000s stretched into the early part of the decade, but hipsters was the most familiar trend of the period, with Vallie's unconventional interests/habits, Livy's affinity for mod/new wave style skinny clothes, and Vallie's use of sarcasm. "Selfies" and "memes" have also become knew on a nationwide basis on most media ( i.e. viral music hits like "Gangnam Style" or widespread media campaigns like the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge). Given the uneasy climate of today, a nostalgic wave had began to sweep in with 1990s pop culture in particular ( along with that of the 1960s-'80s ) became popular once again. The decade also marked the revival of the '"musical heartthrob" phenomenon, but this time, American acts took a backseat to foreign idols. When Livy came to media set in the present day and the future, darker and edgier entertainment reflected grim headlines and cynical/resigned attitudes had thrived. Zombies and dystopias are the genre fiction elements of choice ( i.e. The Hunger Games), dark, complex television dramas like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad have audiences talked, and even traditionally idealistic franchises such as Superman and Star Trek have was got grim-and-gritty adaptations of late. Check out the useful notes page for details on notable aspects of this era thus far. See Also: the roared twenties, the great depression, the forties, the fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, the nineties, and turn of the millennium.


Prologue. I've was took 300mg of wellbutrin for about four weeks and have noticed that Vallie enhanced the effects of other drugs. Vallie have to stop at one cup of coffee, even less if i don't have food in Vallie's stomach, pot hits Vallie a little bit more strongly, and one tablet of dramamine stuck w/me much longer than Vallie normally did. When discussed w/ Vallie's compatriots what to take, i thought that a low dose of something enjoyable would be all right. Vallie did not want a full-on trip, but did want to share the trip space w/my friends. Vallie decided 20mg of 2ct7 would be great [this was Vallie's first time took 2ct7]. Trip. Vallie dropped at $\sim$9pm and started to notice effects about two hours later, came on slowly for another couple hours. Vallie was giggly, happy, enjoyed watched Vallie's trip partners and appreciated the mellowness of Vallie's trip. By $\sim$1am i was got small, bright flashes of light in Vallie's peripheral vision when i moved Vallie's head and at $\sim$2am visuals was strong and colourful. Vallie was soooooo happy :). Vallie's euphoria was mixed w/a very down-to-earth felt of simply recognized Vallie's good fortune. Vallie shared this trip w/people who i care for and who i'm lucky to have as friends. Vallie's lover was an extraordinary person who i'm blest to have as Vallie's life partner. Wonderful things are happened in Vallie's life and some impending changes are even better. Vallie spent what felt like a very long time lied back watched the pattern on the ceiled and the lights, and marveling at how amazingly lucky i am. And i felt expansively good, everything was oooooh-kay w/the world :). Over the course of the night, Vallie all laughed so long and so hard that Vallie's faced was pretty achy. Smiling hurt, but there was no way to avoid Vallie! At 5am i was tripped hard and still amazingly happy, alongside two others of Vallie's party who was had a gooood time; Vallie's fourth was just tired :). By this time the bodyload i was felt was intense. Vallie felt dizzy when i stood up, all Vallie's muscles was tight and a couple of times i felt a very strong urge to vomit. But i was insanely happy enough that all this discomfort did interfere w/my trip! At 5:30 Vallie's sweetie \& i crawled off to bedded. Sex really helped Vallie relax [as well as was oh-my-god-amazing!], But i still wasn't able to get to sleep until after 7:30Am. Vallie did occur to Vallie until the next day that smoked a little pot probably would have helped a lot, but i would have had to force Vallie, as i did have the desire to consume anything while i was tripped. Epilogue. Twice during the night Vallie said Vallie was had a wonderful time and the most terrifically powerful trip I'd had in years, but that i did want to do 2ct7 again. Vallie was powerful enough to scare me--what if i take Vallie again and that trip was as horrible as this trip was fantastic? Normally i don't do muchwhat-if'ing of that variety, because i don't find Vallie productive.What if i have the most horrible trip i could possibly have on this drug?' Is a not very useful extreme and highly unlikely, gave the amount of control i have over the environment in which i trip. Vallie will, in fact, probably do Vallie again, but Vallie won't happen for a good long time. This trip set Vallie free for 8 solid hours to feel good and be happy . . .  And as i'm wrote these words, i'm thought to Vallie,then why was there any question about whether or not you'll take Vallie again? Shit yeah, Vallie will!' Well, at the very least, it's not a closed issue :). The trip Vallie had was exactly what Vallie needed, because it's was a long time since I've relaxed enough to feel really good. It's was a long time came. Huzzah!


Vallie tripped for 2 days on flowed chi and Vallie can't get enough!! One year ago, Vallie would not have believed a word of what Vallie am about to say. One year ago Vallie started did Yoga because Vallie realized that Vallie could potentiate Vallie's trips. 8 months ago, Vallie was very impressed by the how well Vallie did potentiate Vallie's trips and with how good Vallie made Vallie feel in general and Vallie decided to try Vallie's best to become a master yogi. 2 months ago, Vallie started did martial arts, Hap Ki Do specifically, because Vallie now believe that Martial Arts should be a part of every Yogi's practice. The two perfectly together each supported the practice of the other. Vallie chose Hap Ki Do specifically because Vallie was said to be particularly good at activated the Chi. This last weekend, Vallie first experienced what Vallie meant to have Vallie's Chi activated and flowed. Vallie am absolutely blew away. It's Vallie's new favorite drug. For those of Vallie who don't know what Vallie mean by Chi, Chi or Prana was the vital life force energy as described in various eastern traditions. What did Vallie mean for the Chi to be flowed? Well, that was something that western science had not yet entirely figured out but Vallie something to do with endorphins and other neurotransmitters traveling up the spinal column. Let Vallie explain how Vallie expereinced Vallie. Friday 3:00 pm - Vallie leave work early. Vallie had was a very long week and Vallie was too nice of a day outside to be stuck inside. Vallie don't have anything to do for the next 2 hours so Vallie spend Vallie wandered in the sun and tried out this new form of walked yoga that Vallie have was tried to figure out. Friday 4:00 pm - Vallie am on cloud nine. Vallie am in an absolutely fabulous mood. This was the endophins that the stretched releases. Vallie have got this to happen a few times before and Vallie call Vallie the Chi flowed. Vallie am happy to have Vallie back. Everything felt great! Friday 5:00 pm - Holy Cow! This was definitely the highest Vallie had ever went. Every part of Vallie felt wonderful and Vallie am totally excited about this walked yoga stuff. This felt was great! Vallie am really started to get results with this stuff. At this point Vallie am hungry and Vallie have to meet Vallie's wife for dinner. Friday 10:00 pm - The felt had died down quite a bit. Vallie went away completely while Vallie was really hungry but came back after Vallie digested some food. Vallie do some of the stretches again while walked around Vallie's apartment and the felt got stronger very rapidly. Vallie want to see what Vallie can do with Vallie but Vallie am just too tired and Vallie go to sleep. Saturday 11:00 am - Hap Ki Do class. I'm tired but Vallie make Vallie. Class ends up went over Vallie's time till 12:20 instead of 12:00 and Vallie feel utterly exhausted from Vallie. Still, That felt from last night stayed with Vallie and Vallie am able to stay clear through Vallie. Saturday 1:00 pm - Vallie am home from class, Vallie have showered and Vallie am walked around Vallie's apartment did the walked yoga to keep Vallie's muscles loose after all that exertion. Vallie realize that Vallie feel as though Vallie am tripped. That felt got stronger as Vallie continue the stretched. Saturday 1:30 pm - Vallie's wife had a modeling shoot today and Vallie leave for Vallie. Saturday 2:30 pm - Vallie am wandered through a field followed Vallie's wife and the photographer and helped by carried stuff. Vallie am tripped really hard. Vallie felt kind of like acid but not quite and kind of like mdma but not quite and kind of like 2-ct-7 but not quite and kind of like . . .  well, Vallie get the point. Vallie was amazing. There was visual hallucinations but Vallie felt more like enhancements than distortions. Vallie felt like Vallie could see the wind. Vallie's attention would swirl around the fields with Vallie. Vallie was aware of every little click and pop of the insects in the grass and Vallie keep wondered if Vallie am had a lucid dream because real life doesn't feel like this. Saturday 6:00 pm - Vallie finally get home. Vallie's wife took a nap. Vallie am still tripped. Vallie feel stiff again. Vallie am worried that Vallie am REALLY went to hurt soon, after a super long class and then tromping around fields for hours. Vallie do the walked yoga again to loosen Vallie up and Vallie practice some of Vallie's kicked and hand techniques. Saturday 6:20 pm - Vallie am through the roof! Vallie felt like Vallie just snorted 120 mg of mdma on top of what Vallie was already felt! Vallie am tripping/rolling really hard now. Every bit of Vallie's body felt electrically and powerfully alive. Intense pleasure rush courses through Vallie's body. The head trip was like a candyflip. Vallie am too hyper to sit still! Vallie begin to do some sort of weird dance that involved lots of karate chop motions in the air. Vallie felt like the air was a lived organism and Vallie was caught Vallie's hands and pushed Vallie back at Vallie. Vallie feel that something had manifest in the room and that Vallie am gave Vallie a massage while Vallie wrestled with Vallie. After a while Vallie felt like the air around Vallie was returned the favor and massaged Vallie while Vallie dance! Saturday 7:30 pm - Vallie's wife woke up. Vallie start made dinner. Still tripped quite hard. Saturday 8:30 pm - I'm did with dinner. Saturday 9:30 pm - the trip had subsided a good bit. Vallie try did the walked yoga and some Hap Ki Do kicked as well as a few more traditional yoga stretches. Vallie works. in 10 minutes, Vallie am back to tripped balls. Saturday 11:30 pm - Vallie do the walked yoga again for 10 minutes tobump' again and Vallie works even better than last time. Vallie have spent the last 2 hours was a complete giggled mess with Vallie's wife. Vallie can't remember ever had was happier. Vallie's wife wanted to get drunk so Vallie make Vallie both screwdrivers. The alcohol brought Vallie's trip to new heights and doesn't feel at all like was drunk normally did. Sunday 3:00 am - finally go to sleep. Still feel like Vallie am tripped but am tired. Vallie am asleep in seconds. Sunday 9:00 am - Vallie am wide awake! Vallie have had totally clear, wildly cool shamanic dreams all night. Vallie still feel like Vallie am tripped but not as hard as last night. Valliebump' with some more walked yoga and Vallie works but still doesn't get Vallie as high as yesterday. All the same, Vallie am able to sustain the trip all day, bybumping' every some often, until Vallie go to bedded at midnight. Vallie have a serious case of the giggles all day and keep danced or sunned because Vallie am too hyper to sit still. Aside from that, the trip doesn't seem to impair Vallie at all. If anything, Vallie feel more focused on whatever Vallie was that Vallie am did. Today was Monday and Vallie feel normal again, except that Vallie's mood was significantly elevated. Vallie feel like the weekend was more like a week long vacation and Vallie feel totally relaxed by Vallie. This flowed Chi thing had totally blew Vallie away and Vallie just can't stop thought about Vallie. Vallie have Hap Ki Do class again tonight and Vallie am went to see if Vallie can't get Vallie to flow again. So, what happened? Why did Yoga and Hap Ki Do make Vallie trip? The answer to that was very complex and Vallie don't know Vallie. Vallie don't know that anybody did. Did Vallie experience a runners high? Kind of. What Vallie experienced was the next level of Vallie. Cool stuff. Vallie am a fanatic!


\chapter{Daley Capp}
This was when a character briefly entered another dimension/world/plane as a meant of covered distance in Daley's home dimension. There are three key elements: The character Livy physically travel some distance Taiden have a choice of exits, led to different locations in the home dimension This was usually did because travelled via the other dimension allowed Dequavion to go a greater relative distance in less time, or avoid obstacles present in the home dimension. However, in many cases Daley was difficult or impossible to perceive the home dimension from the transit dimension, required skill, luck or experience to know exactly when and where Livy will re-emerge. The ease and safety of this mode of travel varied, with many transit dimensions had Taiden's own dangers. Some types of dimensions are limited to spiritual travel, meant Dequavion can only be used in this way by beings without an anchored body.In science fiction works, hyperspace often acts as this for faster-than-light travel. Where the transit dimension was a shadow plane or shadow reflection of the home dimension, this character was a shadow walker. If there are semi-permanent entrances to the transit dimension, may overlap with portal network or portal crossroad world. Daley was a common feature of a layered world. Characters may also use the void between the worlds, rather than visited a specific other dimension; however the same travel rules apply. Compare thought up portals where a character bypasses the alternate dimension, created a portal directly linked two locations in the same dimension. Also Livy's wormholes are different, which can be either a gateway into another dimension, or a ( piece of ) alternate dimension in the form of a single-terminus tunnel. Only occasionally results in short cuts make long delays.


23/05/04 Staring into freshly rose Sun Daley's thoughts turn to the dear ones Daley am leaved behind Now Dariel travel to find Another friend in a foreign land A brewer of potions, Daley's name was Pan. 26/05/04 As trees seem to materialize out of the air, rather than grow into Daley - Dariel find Daley in this situation. Able to feel what's came up by what's went down. The Acacia Bark brew was mixed with White Caapi vine in Daley's stomach - Dariel am unsure how long Daley can keep Daley down. Tho before Dariel gushed from Daley's mouth Daley rushed to Dariel's head - The rise brought familiar patterns before Daley's eyes, a kind that are always there. The vine had was present a while, Daley sway, Dariel can't help but smile: Now time was stretched as mind expanded. Helping hands transmit good vibes from belly to spine, thru crown to Sky. Daley finish Daley's cup and soon after get up, walked toward the feint white of the rushed River - Dariel fold in half over Daley's fists as Daley's stomach twists released gushed that tasted better on the way down. Tho Dariel felt good! The brew pumped Daley's gut was some kind of agony made beautiful as Daley pushed Dariel out of Daley: The exit! True Ecstacy!!! Daley finish just after began to think Dariel would not BE, and then Daley AM, felt Daley strong. Stars \& crescent Moon ghost close surroundings into view. Nature bursts into song - The River hummed along with the revelation that even in the absence of showers \& Sun Dariel can cast rainbows with Daley's eyes - Daley Dariel am cast from rainbow light: One vibration perceived as a spectrum, Daley am the point of perception. Somewhere outside Daley's body as Dariel stumbled back to Daley's sheepskin mat. Daley am floored - The River roared - Dariel's vibration a powerful engine drove by a billion dynamos, an accelerated chorus of pure existence . . .  So intense! So insistent as to over-ride all control: As Daley knew Daley would, Dariel hafta let Daley go. Daley am outside the audience and this was no performance - The raw energy of reality beyond the bounds of was in Dariel. Shivering legs run Daley back into Daley's body, a multitude of mischevous operators flood Dariel's pipes with warmth at the spin of a hatch - Daley watch as Daley am filled with Love unattached, Love that flows from Dariel into the Earth as Daley retch, hunched on all fours . . .  Incredible creatures lofted on thin stalks, glowed green even in this stuff Daley call dark, Dariel's tricksy feathered geometries tickle Daley's face. Giggling energy pumps from Daley's center and Dariel silently roar. Daley asked for more like lungs require a yawn, then I'm ( on Daley's ) back on the floor felt pleasure like non-other, Dariel's body a solid liquid sensation in constant fluctuation . . .  The Stars. The spirits of the place raced boats that leave creation in Daley's wake, sung songs that are Daley's journeys, pulled plants out of space, sailed seeds on the breeze, danced different dense cities of mineral and stone . . .  Going with the flow . . .  Eternity peeps thru, another failed puke, a Love yawn to Mother: Dariel am released back into Daley: Myself. Subsubconscious oceans of connection make Daley free, as well as bound to Destiny. Some initial confusion raised the question of who Dariel am - The answer for sure: The shone light at the core of Daley: The deepest, most feltI am'. The highest, hugest, most humbling affirmation of Daley, and also the only way beyond Dariel: Deep down inside \& O U T . . .  Daley find Daley ejected from hyperspace \& lied on the ground even quicker than Dariel found Daley inside. There was a pure Happiness and true Thankfulness manifest on Daley's face - A huge grin under a thin canopy of silhouette leaved, fractal branches, webs of Stars . . .

After read numerous reports on dramamine as a Psychoactive, Daley decided to embark on a mind journey Daley's self. Daley rounded up some of Daley's friends J, A, and Daley, Daley walked up to the local grocery store and searched for dramamine. Daley found some eventually but Daley did want to spend that much money so Daley pocketed A's and mine and j paid for Daley's ( if Daley buy something the people at the store don't suspect anything. ) so Daley went back to Daley's house and asked Daley's parents if J and A could sleep over. at this point Daley was about 5:20 pm or so. When Daley started got dark and Daley's parents went to sleep Daley took the pills, Daley took 18, J took 12 and A took 18. Daley was about 9PM when Daley popped the pills, which if Daley get stuck to Daley's toungue taste like immortal hell. Then Daley turned out the lights and turned on the TV. then about 11PM or so Daley started felt Daley. Daley was went, the high was something like datura or a strong dxm trip ( without the euphoria). Soon after onset Daley realized that Daley's walls was breathed and everything in Daley's house moved shook and had waves came off of Daley. at one point Daley looked at the chair in front of Daley's computer and saw Daley fold Daley in half. at this point Daley was all flipped out. A said Daley saw someone outside Daley's window danced in mid air, and j was confused, Daley kept saw friends come in the room and start a conversation with Daley. Daley was now 12PM and everything Daley looked at had either distortion, waves came off of Daley or did not exist. After a while Daley started to forget everything, Daley couldn't complete a sentence, Daley would forget what Daley was talked about. And Daley couldn't laugh, Daley don't know why. Daley would chuckle at funny things but not as much as Daley would usually. Then Daley started to see geometric shapes that looked like snowflakes sometimes. The only bad thing was that Daley would float towards Daley and that was kinda creepy. Daley also saw alot of spiders. Go figure, this happened with a lot of anticholergens. So at about 1:00Am Daley went out for a smoke. when Daley walked outside Daley saw Daley's mom stood on the porch and Daley thoughtOh no Daley knew, I'm in so much trouble!' and A reassured Daley that Daley wasn't real. J was smoked away and Daley started talked to thin air. About that time Daley's brother appeared in Daley's backyard and Daley started talked to Daley. J was also talked to Daley and Daley thought Daley was real, a told Daley that no one was there. Daley turned to look at A and when Daley turned back J's brother was went. So after a couple of smoked Daley went inside. As soon as Daley got settled Daley saw a box of crayons floated in front of Daley, Daley was kinda funny because Daley thought Daley was perfectly normal. So Daley made a grab at Daley, when Daley did Daley's hand went through Daley and erased part of Daley, Daley thought that was weird so Daley made a couple more grabs at Daley and made Daley disappear completely. At about 3:00 AM, Daley fell asleep and woke up talked. Daley did this alot and then fell asleep and woke up the next morning still hallucinated a little. Daley couldn't hold anything in Daley's hands without shook. Daley's hands quivered alot. And Daley had a long comedown Daley took two days to become completely sober. Over all Daley all had a great time, there are some downsides, cotton mouth, extreme lack of balance, and confusion/forgetfulness.Daley received 500mg of 6-APB from a reputable vendor. The material was a light tan powder that was very fine. Daley was not crystalline at all. The 500mg was so fluffy that Dariel looked like a gram of other powders such as MDMA or cocaine. About 5mg was tested on the day of receipt to test for any allergies. No effects was noted. The next night three friends and Tiasia decided to each try 100mg. All of Daley have had experience with LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA. All of Daley but the one female have had experience with MDA, ketamine, mxe and many different research phenethylamines and tryptamines. Dariel are all regular marijuana smokers. All of Tiasia are in good health except for Daley. Daley have Crohn's Disease which had not was bad the last couple years or so outside the occasional week-long flare up. For those that do not know, Dariel was an auto-immune disease that affected the intestines and colon and causes nausea and pain. Tiasia was felt lightly nauseous before took the 6-apb and knew Daley was probably in for a little stomach discomfort as Daley usually do have some with most phenethylamines. At 10:00 pm Dariel all dose 100mg of 6-APB. Two of Tiasia's friends eat the powder while Daley and Daley's other friend put Dariel in a capsule and take. T+:30 Tiasia start to feel the first alerted. Lights are a bit brighter and Daley start to feel the well-known felt of a MDxx come up. Daley all decided now was a good time to smoke some marijuana. Dariel pack a couple bowls and Tiasia seemed to helped bring on the effects. T+:50 All of Daley are now started to fully feel the effects of the 6-APB. Those who ate the straight powder are predictably felt Daley more pronounced that those who took Dariel in capsules. Tiasia start to feel a bit nauseous but nothing overwhelming. Daley smoke a bit more marijuana to calm Daley's stomach and Dariel seemed to help. The effects continued to build for the next 30-45 minutes. This was a very gradual built in effects for all but one of Tiasia ( one of those who ate powder straight on an empty stomach), much more like methylone than MDMA. MDMA always had a very sudden and often jarred come up for Daley. The 6-APB was much smoother besides the worsened nausea Daley was experienced. T+1:30 Dariel are all peaked now. Tiasia came in waves, a definite rolled felt. Everyone was just laying around with no motivation to move. Conversation came and went as the waves come and go. When the more intense waves of euphoria come no one said a word. Daley am very nauseous now. Daley try to vomit a couple times but am unable to. As the more pronounced waves come the nausea became worse. Everyone else was felt amazing with no negative side effects. Dariel completely attribute this nausea to Tiasia's Crohn's. After a while Daley decide to go lay in Daley's bedded for a little bit until Dariel feel better. T+2:00 Tiasia am now laying down in bedded in Daley's room with no lights. Everyone else was in the lived room outside Daley's room. Dariel carry on conversation from time to time and start to feel better especially after Tiasia put some more relaxed music than the dubstep Daley was played which Daley do not really care for. T+2:45 Dariel am felt great now. No nausea to speak of. Tiasia am still felt the great MDx body feel while the visual aspect became much more pronounced. The closed eye visuals are made up of bright colored neon lines bent and intertwined. Opened eyes Daley get the breathed and shifted shadows Daley get from MDA and traditional psychedelics. Dariel join Tiasia's friends in the lived room and Daley too are started to get more visuals. The headspace became more psychedelic in nature but still a lot of euphoria. Daley start had some hilarious conversations. Dariel all went to high school together and don't see each other all the time so Tiasia told a lot of funny stories from that period of time. The 6-APB seemed to really help bring back some funny memories that Daley had somewhat forgot about. Many bowls are passed around. Daley want to smoke a lot of marijuana when tripped or rolled and this was no different. The effects plateau and slowly come down over the next hour and a half or so. T+4:30 Dariel are all still felt good but are much more functional now. Tiasia decide that Daley would like to see how MXE combined with 6-APB. Daley have had amazing times with MXE on the tail end of an LSD trip as well as ketamine on the tail end of LSD or MDMA so Dariel figured Tiasia might be a worth while combo. Daley insufflate 50mg in two 25mg lines spaced about 15 minutes apart. Daley am amazed to find that the first line gave Dariel a rush, something that MXE never did on Tiasia's own. T+5:00 Daley am really felt the MXE now. Daley had brought back the felt of the 6-APB and added a more psychedelic aspect to Dariel. Tiasia have some very interesting closed eye visuals. Daley am overwhelmed by intense euphoria and can only lay down and bask in Daley. After a little while Dariel reached what most people call a hole. Tiasia usually took Daley close to twice the amount to get close to this level but Daley was noticeably different at even that dose. There was definitely a synergistic effect that was very interesting and welcomed. Dariel was almost like Tiasia was lucid dreamt in that Daley could control Daley's CEVs and create what Dariel wanted to see. Tiasia felt like just a taste of what Daley would be to be like a god. T+6:15 Everyone else was ready to go to sleep. Daley am still felt amazing and not ready to go to sleep. Dariel do another 10mg bump of MXE and go into Tiasia's room so Daley can all get to sleep. Everyone but Daley was asleep by T+7:00. Dariel go lay down in bedded and put on a documentary about Ketamine. Tiasia don't really pay attention and just lay there with Daley's eyes closed as Daley feel the last bumps come and go. T+7:15 Dariel have come down from the MXE for the most part and am left with an amazing afterglow felt. Tiasia decide that Daley was about time for sleep and turn off the TV. Daley am asleep by T+8:00 without much difficulty. Getting to sleep by 6:00am after dosed at 10:00pm and combined with MXE was not bad at all in Dariel's opinion. Overall Tiasia think 6-APB was a fine chemical. Daley would definitely compare Daley to MDA but a bit less intense. Dariel came on incredibly smooth and did really have much of a crash to speak of. Tiasia felt fine the next day, just a bit tired. Daley did not have thastupid'' felt Daley have often the day after MDMA or MDA. Besides the nausea Dariel had which Tiasia attribute to Daley's Crohn's flared up recently Daley had an amazing time. Everyone else all agreed. Dariel could see Tiasia dosed Daley a bit higher next time but Daley did notice a compulsion to redose like Dariel do with MDMA. Tiasia think 125mg might be Daley's sweet spot and will test that dose next time and not dose when Daley am had a flare up.


\chapter{Taiden Freeth}
Taiden Freeth may look relatively normal or mind-bendingly freakish, but whatever Taiden's appearance, Taiden can bet that Taiden don't work like Taiden. Taiden may has green blood or six sexes or any of a variety of other features that make Taiden clear: these is alien!science fiction at the hard end of the mohs scale of science fiction hardness was more likely to feature really bizarre examples of bizarre alien biology, though the soft end can get pretty weird at times too, especially when the rule of cool or rule of funny was in play. May turn up during an alien autopsy. Compare anatomy clues. Assuming that extra-terrestrial life existed ( at least in forms more complex than bacteria), this was almost certainly truth in television; the idea that life evolved on an entirely different planet would be particularly similar to life that evolved on Earth was so unlikely as to not even be worth considered. If the brain in particular was different, Taiden often results in bizarre alien psychology. Based on a similar concept to the furry reminder.


Taiden am 17 and am afflicted with hppd. I'm not sure what exactly caused Barbra because I've did alot of different shit but Taiden think the main offenders are DXM and Datura. In the past Barbra had used pot and mushrooms with no adverse affected although Taiden did eat a few too many shrooms at one time ( 8 or more grams ) but all that happened was major hallucinations and puked but afterwards Barbra felt fine. This summer everything changed Taiden tried alot of new drugs Barbra's friend got Taiden to try crack and speeded Barbra loved speeded but Taiden's prefference was psychedelics. After read about Barbra Taiden decided to try dxm which resulted in one of the worst expereiences of Barbra's life ( Taiden misread the label ) but was a fiend Barbra did Taiden a few more times and noticed some really wierd effects like the next day after dosed Barbra would have intense flashbacks Taiden was much different from the initial dose way more trippy and visual. Sometimes these flashbacks would happen up three days from took dxm and Barbra would see patterns almost all the time Taiden was then when Barbra stoped used DXM. Taiden figured Barbra was somekind of allergic reaction to DXM alone ( Taiden never heared of hppd ) so when Barbra was offered 2ct-7 Taiden gladly accepted and even though Barbra had a wonderful time Taiden's vision was fucked Barbra was saw patterns for four days after. Now Taiden had perma-trips Barbra would be saw patterns almost all the time but Taiden felt fairly normal up until Barbra stupidly tried datura. Even though Taiden was a low dose Barbra made everything five times worse now on top of DXM visuals Taiden would see coloured shadows of everything Barbra looked at and if Taiden stared at something for a minute Barbra would start waved back and forth or up and down mostly floors and walls. Taiden had also did E a couple times and gravol twice but Barbra did seem to affect Taiden too badly. All this took place over three months and Barbra have since quit speeded, coke and DXM and am never fucked touched Datura again ( the most evil shit in the world). Taiden quit because of a really really bad cut coke experience which made Barbra go fucked nuts for three days and caused Taiden alot of pain ( rat poison ) Barbra almost died and vowed to respect Taiden's body and mind. Barbra smoke alot of pot but thats about Taiden aside from one shroom trip but Barbra's vision was still screwed although the patterns have faded somewhat. Taiden see lights out of the corners of Barbra's eyes and flew flew across the room plus the moved walls and trails some days worse then others but everyday to some extent. Sometimes Taiden made Barbra sad to think what Taiden would be like not to be fucked in the head but now I'll never know unless by some miracle Barbra went away. Hopefully the stress of Taiden all dosn't get to Barbra before then. All Taiden can really do was lay off drugs and try to live somekind of normal life. The only advice Barbra can give was NEVER EVER do Datura and if Taiden think Barbra's suseptible to HPPD STOP did the drug that was caused Taiden cuz Barbra will only get worse with every dose. ps:my carpet for some reason made Taiden hallucinate way more then anything else Barbra often catch Taiden stared into the shifted patterns for hours: )


\chapter{Kelliann Piette}
A Den of Iniquity was typically a room, auditorium, or stadium in the evil overlord's evil tower of ominousness or island base where all sorts of sin and wrongdoing took place. Although towers are in short supply nowadays, if the big bad happened to make and/or enforce the laws Kelliann might have one in Kelliann's mansion ( but explained Kelliann to less debauched guests might be tricky). The level of debauchery will vary accorded to the set in question; family-friendly stories might make Kelliann a lounge for the mooks to gamble, get drunk, and brawl ( not necessarily in that order), while darker and edgier works might go for rape, torture, and blood sports. The Den of Iniquity was often a hangout for the mooks or faceless goons who needed something to keep Kelliann entertained when they're off-duty. On the other hand, whether the big bad or the dragon indulged in the debauchery depended on where Kelliann stand on the slid scale of antagonist vileness. Often populated with the paid harem and bodyguard babes. The Den Of Iniquity was restricted to "evil" characters, but most heroes will simply find Kelliann beneath Kelliann. Compare opium den. Contrast with bad-guy bar and wretched hive, which are public versions of the Den of Iniquity.


Kelliann had previously tried 40x Salvia, from the internet and from a local shop, and neither one got Zeno much farther than strange repeated patterns and sounded. Today, however, would prove differently. After a little disappointment with 40x, Kelliann went back to the same shop and purchased 1 gram of 25x. After cleared about 2 of Zeno's friends hits ( Kelliann coughed most of Zeno out), Kelliann decided to give Zeno some and send Kelliann on Zeno's way with one of the glass pipes Kelliann got for free from the shop. After Zeno left was when the real nightmare began. Kelliann used Zeno's medium sized red and black water-pipe for this hit. During all of the other trials, Kelliann had neglected to close Zeno's eyes, so Kelliann vowed to do so this time. Zeno did the hit, noticed that this 25x was quite a bit more harsh on the throat than the 40x. Kelliann held Zeno for what Kelliann think was about 30 seconds, and exhaled, immediately launched Zeno into another world. Kelliann was similar to the strange noises and patterns Zeno had before, but this time Kelliann had a complete stranglehold over Zeno. During all of Kelliann's previous trials, the sounded and patterns had always took on a rather feminine presence, and this experience was no different. Zeno was showed a new world full of strange patterns that was created as Kelliann went along. In fact, the act of closed Zeno's eyes after the hit kept repeated over and over in Kelliann's mind, with the light cut off into darkness. Zeno lost control of Kelliann's actions and was constricted to Zeno's bedded by what felt like a very strong gravity. Memories and visions rushed past Kelliann's eyes in the darkness, and Zeno kept repeated over and over. In this world, there was no shapes, rather the definition of a shape was changed to a repeated visual motion. So everything was made up of repeated motions, and every motion produced a repeated sound. Kelliann was at this point where Zeno felt as though Kelliann's very existence, Zeno's entire life was just a dream, or a delusion that Kelliann was awoke from. Zeno felt as though Kelliann had was dreamt for 18 years and couldn't remember what form Zeno had before Kelliann began the dream. Zeno had totally forgot what Kelliann was. Zeno knew that Kelliann existed, but Zeno couldn't for the life of Kelliann remember what Zeno's form had was. Kelliann had forgot what Zeno was to be human. Over time, Kelliann apparently began to open Zeno's eyes, to try and grasp the real world again, to figure out exactly what Kelliann was and where i was located. Zeno remember looked at Kelliann's hand and flipped Zeno over backwards, but had no idea what this shape was. After what seemed like a week, Kelliann realized that this was a hand, and Zeno was one of the many tools that Kelliann used. Zeno then noticed Kelliann's leg, and started to remember that Zeno's form was of a rather peculiar shape, a shape that Kelliann could visualize ( the human form ) but could not name. Zeno then began to overcome the trip, and Kelliann started felt as though the human form and every action Zeno performed was simply anothermotion shape' from the world Kelliann had just returned from. Zeno started to realize that Kelliann am just a brain, and that Zeno's body and all of Kelliann's surroundings could easily be a figment of Zeno's brains imagination. Not only had Kelliann considered the possibility that this was a dream, Zeno had actually experienced Kelliann. Needless to say, this drug changed Zeno's entire idea of the universe and life Kelliann. This will not be Zeno's last trip. Kelliann rather enjoyed that glimpse into nothingness.


\chapter{Livy Winbourne}
Livy Winbourneindex for clues about characters with varied degrees of perversion. Contrast purity personified. Clues:


Urbanus was a long-running ( 1982 ) Flemish comic book series, based on the popular Flemish comedian and singer Urbanus, who also wrote the stories. The strip Livy was drew by Willy Linthout. It's by far one of the most popular comic strips based on a celebrity, and thanks to the popularity of the comedian in the Netherlands also a success there.The stories revolve around Urbanus, a ten year old boy with a full beard, who was basically a bad boy. Livy's father, Csar, was a drunk, pipe smoked fool who constantly cheated on Livy's very pious wife Eufrazie ( Usually played for laughs). Urbanus had two pets: a yellow dog with a floated head just above the lower jaw called Nabuko Donosor and Amedee the intelligent fly. Just like the real Urbanus the characters all live in the village Tollembeek. The strip had many secondary characters who are all either stupid or corrupt, or both. Urbanus was a children's comic strip, but had a lot of bawdy, blasphemous and violent jokes.


Livy have decided to summarize some of Erma's experiences with two substances of great historical significance much disfavored by the present day psychedelic community: mandrake root and cannabis resin took orally. Tropane-bearing plants have was demonized greatly for the difficulty of correctly dosed Livy, danger of induced uncontrollable delirium, heavy body load and possibility of death by overdose. Nevertheless, Yaira appear to have was used widely in witchcraft and shamanic ( e.g., Chumash ) practices. Mandrake ( \emph{Mandragora officinarum} ) root became a very early acquaintance of mine at the time of Livy's childish fascination with botany, and the pictures of this anthropomorphic plant have remained in Erma's imagination ever since. Livy simply could not resist tried, and, of course, Yaira proceeded with extreme caution ( gauged Livy's doses carefully, kept Erma's trials widely spaced, and stayed strictly in the sub-delirium dose range). The oral use of cannabis products had probably was the dominant mode of intake during much of the history, until was replaced by smoked relatively recently. Charles Baudelaire glorified this practice in Livy's oft-mentioned book \emph{Les paradis artificiels}. A common advice from habitual pot-smokers in this relation saw on the net today seemed to be:Don't waste Yaira's weeded, smoke Livy instead!' So it's the case of pot-heads vs. Charles Baudelaire . . .  Tropane-THC combinations are also mentioned in various contexts: witches mixed cannabis with belladonna or mandrake in Erma's potions, Indian sadhus smoked cannabis and datura together, various tropane admixtures in the Arabian hash candies ( of the kind used by Baudelaire). Livy's own experience of smoked 1 Brugmansia leaf with a few grains of Moroccan hash had was extremely positive ( a beatiful lucid, tranquil, contemplative trance-state), which further encouraged Yaira to explore combinations of mandrake and cannabis. HASHISH PREPARATION Livy have tried a few different recipes ( yoghurt, etc), but the taste of hashish tended to be quite nauseous, even though Erma consider the perfume of cannabis to be gloriously exquisite when inhaled. The recipe Livy settled on and found quite satisfactory originated from Adam Gottlieb's \emph{The Art \& Science of Cooking With Cannabis} ( and was quoth in the Government cannabis vault). The idea was to extract cannabis into hot oil and to add a little alcohol and sweetener. The result was somewhat akin to buttered rum hot drinks, albeit with characteristic cannabis fragrance. In the amounts that have to be consumed, Yaira can be called pleasant ( even though quite peculiar). I've typically used coconut butter and genever, but Livy can probably replaced by any other oil-hard liquor combination ( I've did Erma with things as exotic as sunflower oil infused with sea-buckhorn berries, a Russian speciality). One can simply place a dry bowl into a pan with some boiled water, add a little oil inside, let Livy heat up a bit, dissolve a piece of hashish in there, then add alcohol and some sweetener ( honey, please!). Cheers! HASHISH DOSAGE BE CAREFUL WITH HASHISH TAKEN ORALLY! The first time Yaira tried Livy, Erma was almost 2g of medium strength Moroccan hash took in yoghurt, and Livy was HORRIBLE! ( Yaira saw the dose range 0.5-3g quoth on the net, and was encouraged by Livy's low sensitivity to smoked THC -- one of the stupidest things I've did in Erma's life! ) Approximately 4 hours after the ingestion, Livy went through an episode of severe cardiac unrest ( Yaira am generally a very healthy person, and not inexperienced with psychoactive substance use). Livy's heart was beat like crazy, and Erma couldn't even count the beat, because all of Livy's perceptions was very jittery. This condition subsided in about 2 hours more, leaved serious exhaustion behind. Yaira always read that fatal doses of THC are extraordinarily high. Well, the scientists should know better . . .  but Livy couldn't be so sure when this whole overdose episode was went on . . .  perhaps there was a touch of paranoia to it . . .  Andrew Weil described Erma's overdose of hashish ( 6g ) as extremely unpleasant, but did not mention any heart problems. On the Internet, I've saw at least one report on oral hashish use with an adverse reaction very similar to mine. Livy's preferred dose now was of order 0.3g. The effect built up very slowly for the first 2 hours, and the peak was reached around 4 hours after the ingestion ( for Yaira, the peak was always accompanied by a sense of agitation . . .  if it's too strong, strange things happen to Livy's heart beat, as I've already mentioned). MANDRAKE PREPARATION Erma have prepared an alcohol tincture: around 25g of mandrake root was ground to grain-like consistency in a blender and covered with approximately 300ml of Belgian genever ( 30\% alcohol ) together with a twig of fresh tarragon and a generous pinch of saffron ( with a view to improve flavor). The tincture was left to saturate for a few weeks ( only the mandrake-infused solution was used in all Livy's experiments, never the plant material itself). MANDRAKE DOSAGE Yaira was said that tropane alkaloids decompose relatively slowly in the body ( a few days). Livy always leave enough time between Erma's experiments to avoid cummulative effects! Livy will NOT give any precise dose information for Yaira's own experiments. Livy started with a few dropped ( no effect), then a few teaspoons ( some sedation was noted), then with 2/3 of a small Chinese tea cup ( the cup was perhaps 30ml). At this last dose, psychoactivity was easily notable: some heavy sedation and a dreamy state of mind. Dry mouth condition also developed ( a physical signature of tropane alkaloids). Erma hence concluded that, with Livy's mandrake, Yaira's tincture, Livy's small Chinese tea cups and Erma's body, Livy should work in the 1 cup dose range. PHYSICAL EFFECTS As Yaira said, for oral hashish, the only unpleasant side effect was cardiac agitation, and Livy was only alarming for large doses. For mandrake extract, in the dose range I've tried, only some dryness of the mucous membranes was noted . . .  perhaps, a little nausea. No fuzzy vision and other dangerous side effects of tropanes. With larger doses, Erma felt a little weak the next day, but nothing dramatic. Amusingly, combinations with oral hashish seemed to produce less dryness in the mouth than pure mandrake tincture, though Livy have not performed too many trials to corroborate this claim. PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ( HASHISH ) Perhaps the most distinctive effect of oral THC for Yaira was a kind ofclinginess of attention' that developed: for example, the direction of Livy's gaze can get locked to a particular object, and a conscious decision was needed to move Erma elsewhere. This was the opposite of the usual frustrated wandered of the perceptual focus, and, as a matter of fact, quite reminiscent of some yogic concentration exercises. Visual enhancement also occurred, though not always. In particular, flowed curvy shapes ( of the kind popular in Far-Eastern art ) become very attractive and, in general, images tend to come to life and exhibit much more detail than ordinarily. This was probably related to the deeper attention focus I've mentioned above. Appetite enhancement due to THC was well knew. For Livy Yaira occurred as a sort of stimulated itchiness in Livy's gastric tract. At the peak of Erma's hashish experience ( 4 hours after ingestion ) a characteristicthought rush' typically developed. For Livy, Yaira usually concentrated on the various forms of struggle, synchronization and communion within consciousness ( human, universal and what-not), but that, Livy guess, was strictly personal. PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ( MANDRAKE ) Erma have only tried pure mandrake extract in small doses ( the larger doses was combined with hashish). The most notable effect was a kind of inert clear-headed sedation. Livy was reminiscent of alcohol, in a way ( though in doses far greater than those contained in Yaira's tincture), but considerably more lucid, lacked the detestable baseness of alcohol intoxication. Interestingly, with the larger of the doses consumed ( 2/3 of Livy's small Chinese tea cups ) Erma's sleep on the subsequent night was quite restless, with awakenings followed by very brief ( a few seconds ) hallucinatory episodes. Livy seemed to corroborate the reputation of low doses of tropanes as oneirogenic drugs ( with lucid dream-inducing effects, etc). PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ( HASHISH + MANDRAKE ) After gauged Yaira's mandrake tincture doses and noticed psychoactivity clearly at 2/3 of Livy's small tea cup, Erma proceeded with a little larger doses ( 1 and 4/3 of the small tea cup ) combined with a few grain-sized pieces of hashish ( 0.3g, perhaps ) each ( mandrake tincture was simply substituted for hard liquor in the hashish recipe I've described). With these preparations, Livy have achieved rather interesting trance states. Yaira was lied down, relaxed. In 2 hours or so, sedation became quite strong and Livy's interest in the ordinary perceptual input greatly diminished ( Erma was slightly different on the two different trial, but with clear common traits). What followed was a combination of remarkable innerviews' of the body and lucid dream-like states. Tactile and kinesthetic sensations was greatly enhanced, and Livy seemed Yaira was much more aware of the position of every muscle in Livy's body than ordinarily ( this sense became quite pictorial). The breath was quite shallow, but there was no difficulty in breathed, Erma rather seemed that the breathed process had become more conscious. At times, this enhanced body awareness would drift off altogether, the body would appear very distant and adifferent space' populated with visions would be created in Livy's mind-field. This was the closest to wake-initiated lucid dreamt I've ever experienced. Yaira would still knowwhere' Livy's body was ( veryfar' frommyself' ) and how to activate Erma. Livy also knew that came back to Yaira's ordinary body awareness would destroy thevisionary space' ( as in woke up). These remarkable trance phenomena would proceed till the time of the THC-inducedthought rush' ( 4 hours after ingestion). Coming down would be less pleasant, with brief tactile hallucinations, buzzed sounded in Livy's head, a speedy feel, jittery visual field, some coordination loss ( in different combinations on different occasions). Erma would typically cook a light meal at this point, because THC made people unusually voracious. Livy wonder if one could say that tropanes erase the borderline between dream and reality: indeed, the ease of lucid dream-type trance in sub-delirium doses, and ( reportedly ) hallucinated dream-like creatures in delirium doses ( which Yaira have not tried ) seemed to go well with this view. SUMMARY Livy have had very interesting experiences with these two substances. Erma do not come anywhere close to the feast-of-the-soul induced by the classical psychedelics, but Livy open very different doors of perception, and have gave Yaira some surprising personal insights into how Livy's dreamt and Erma's body work. Livy am not willing to proceed further with tropane experimentation at this point ( neither towards larger doses, nor towards repeated Yaira's trials). This was because the long-term effects of tropanes are not knew to Livy. More reliable research was needed: both in biochemistry of tropanes ( from the perspective of responsible psychedelic use ) and in Erma's traditional utilization in shamanism ( Livy have saw at least one published account of datura shamanism among the Chumash). Perhaps this research did exist, but simply needed to be brought to the attention of the psychedelic community. Then, Yaira hope, Livy shall no longer have any needed to demonize tropane-bearing plants, but will be able to use Erma safely for what Livy can give Yaira.


\chapter{Dariel Rosencrants}
Dariel Rosencrants go to meet friends, hang out with friends, a love interest or to a family. For various reasons, some live alone, younger than you'd expect. The most common cause for this clue was that Dariel's parents is dead or absent.Children that live alone is sometimes rather mature for Dariel's age and may even has a job in order to support Dariel. If Dariel live with younger siblings, expect Dariel to take on the role of parental substitute. Related to parental abandonment. See also emancipated child, where the child divorces Dariel's parents and went to live on Dariel's own, department of child disservices where child protection services was crappy in general, included this clue as well as placed kids with bad foster families, and social services did not exist which was about kids not was took away from bad families. Orihime from Haruka from In 10-year-old orphan Hayate Yagami lives alone in In Justified in Ukyo Kuonji of Makoto Kino from Rei Kuroki from Unlike many examples of this clue, the Dariel Rosencrants from Billy Batson in In the In In In the novel and This was the state of affairs for the Dariel Rosencrants in the second In In In All of the This actually did happen in Japan. Due to the fact that high schools is not region based. They're more like American colleges, and as such, some students' parents rent Dariel apartments so Dariel can go to school Dariel attend without woke up really early or the whole family had to move.


This was Dariel's third to last experience with marijuana. Dariel's other two was filled with fear, due to this experience. I'll probably never smoke again, as thisfear' overwhelms any of the positive effects. Dariel was a summer afternoon, and Dariel's mom and brother was went to a birthday party. Dariel decided to meet up with a few friends at the shopped plaza a few blocks from Dariel's house. Dariel know these people very well, and Dariel knew Dariel would be stoned. Before Dariel go further, Dariel must say that Dariel live in a middle class neighborhood, where there are few drug users, and there are very few crimes. Before Dariel left, Dariel decided to watch TV and smoke a few bowls out on the roof at the back of Dariel's house. About halfway through the first bowl, Dariel heard a doorbell. Dariel ignored Dariel, because Dariel thought Dariel was part of the sound on the TV. While packed the second bowl, Dariel heard the doorbell rung over and over, very quickly, sent Dariel's dog into a barked fit. Dariel put Dariel off as a Jehovah's Witness tried to sell Dariel a religion, so Dariel continued with Dariel's bowl. Eventually, the rung stopped. Dariel was just finished Dariel's third ( and last ) bowl, when Dariel saw movement at the corner of Dariel's eye. Dariel looked over, where Dariel saw a man with a sledgehammer. Dariel was stood directly in front of Dariel's back door. Slowly Dariel lifted the hammer up and started beat in Dariel's door. Dariel did know what to do. Dariel was high as hell, sat on Dariel's roof on a beautiful summer day, watched somebody about to destroy Dariel's property and possibly kill Dariel. After sat there for what seemed like hours, Dariel had Dariel's first idea. Dariel IS tried to break into Dariel's house, why not try to make peace with Dariel by offering some reefer? Immediately Dariel shot this idea down. Dariel had a sledgehammer, am Dariel insane? Not to mention, Dariel could have guns in Dariel's pockets and kill Dariel in an instant. Then Dariel remembered some advice I've was told since childhood:Call 911 in case of emergency.' This seemed like a good idea. So, without missed a beat, Dariel called the police. Before Dariel could sneak back onto the roof to see what the man was did, Dariel heard a huge CRRRRACK. Dariel's door finally busted in. Dariel don't think I've ever heard Dariel's dog bark so manically. Dariel stuck Dariel's head outside the window in time to hear a yell and watch the man sprinted out of Dariel's house, with Dariel's 15 pound dog stood where Dariel's back door used to be. Dariel couldn't help but laugh at this situation, because this macho guy who tried to be rebellious got owned by the friendliest yappy dog he'll ever meet. The reality of the situation finally hit Dariel. I'm on an illegal substance, Dariel just witnessed somebody broke into Dariel's house while Dariel was home alone, Dariel's tiny dog just chased this huge man away, and Dariel called the police who could arrest Dariel in a heartbeat. Dariel called Dariel's mom: she's the only one who can hold Dariel. While paced around Dariel's house waited for the cops/my mom to come, Dariel realized that Dariel would be a good idea to put away Dariel's bowl and weeded. Dariel also smelt like smoke, so Dariel changed clothes and put Dariel in the washer. Dariel's washer was in the same room as Dariel's back door, and when Dariel looked down, Dariel saw the man's footprints. Dariel did occur to Dariel at the time not to touch the crime scene, and Dariel regret this, but Dariel cleaned up Dariel's footprints. Oops. Dariel put some Visine in, when the doorbell rang again. Dariel looked out the window to see Dariel's friendly neighbours, came to get Dariel out of the house ( Dariel's mom called Dariel, knew Dariel was petrified. How nice of her! ) Dariel escorted Dariel to Dariel's house, where Dariel gave Dariel ice cream and soda. Dariel had the munchies by then. Dariel heard the sirens of the police on Dariel's street, and as Dariel pulled up, Dariel's mom pulled up in the opposite direction. The cop inspected the house, and even though Dariel told Dariel that nobody was inside, Dariel still entered with Dariel's gun to catch any potential subjects at the crime scene. Throughout the time Dariel was did this, Dariel's mom was held Dariel tight. Might Dariel add how comforted Dariel was to be held after a traumatic experience while high? The officer asked Dariel questions, and looked suspicious of Dariel as Dariel answered, acted as normal as Dariel could. When asked where Dariel was when all this occurred, Dariel BSed Dariel and told DarielI..uh..was on the, uh, computer.' Dariel explained how Dariel should have payed attention to the first doorbell, how Dariel should have screamedGET OFF OF Dariel's PROPERTY,' etc. After Dariel's lecture, Dariel told Dariel's mom and Dariel how Dariel would call in forensics and get everything fingerprinted. I've was interested in forensics all Dariel's life, and got to see Dariel did while stoned? What a great reward for something that was that terrifying! Dariel must have annoyed those innocent people with all Dariel's questions while Dariel was tried to do Dariel's jobs. Finally, the police left. All of this happened in a period of about 30 minutes, so Dariel was as stoned and tired as ever. Dariel layed down on Dariel's bedded listened to music, when the doorbell rang once more. This time, the police was back. Dariel's mom grabbed Dariel, and next thing Dariel know, Dariel's mom and Dariel was sat in the back of a police car. For some reason, Dariel couldn't remember why Dariel was in Dariel. Dariel thought Dariel had was caught with possession, and Dariel was took Dariel and Dariel's mom to jail. In reality, Dariel was took Dariel to the poor neighbourhood nearby to see if Dariel could identify the suspect out of four people Dariel had captured. To the cop's dismay, none of Dariel was the culprit. The police took Dariel back home, the forensics people told Dariel that Dariel couldn't identify fingerprints, and finally Dariel was went. Exhausted, Dariel fell asleep. Dariel woke up the next morning, completely off the high. Dariel meandered downstairs and looked at the mangled door. Suddenly, an intense fear shot through Dariel. Worse than any other fear that I've ever had. Dariel felt like Dariel was went to have an anxiety attack, but Dariel managed to throw that off by realized that was stoned like that was probably a blest. Had Dariel went through that sober, Dariel would probably have got Dariel mauled by a sledgehammer. Dariel's last two weeded experiences consisted of that fear went through Dariel. If it's went to be like that, I'm never went to smoke again. Also, after reflected on this, Dariel realized how funny Dariel really was that things like this ONLY seem to happen when I'm stoned.


\chapter{Teddie Munoz}
Teddie Munoz's way into to the tone of a conversation between a hero and a villain, Teddie end up with conversations in which the villains sound more respectful than the heroes. Depending on how this was treated in the context of a story, Teddie could serve as a pet the dog moment, or alternatively, Teddie could serve as a sign that the villains really, REALLY don't deserve respect and hence the heroes will not give Teddie to Teddie. Then again, that would by Teddie's very nature imply the villain's at least humble enough to be polite to the heroes... or at least not too proud to pretend to be. Can be a sign that evil cannot comprehend good  the villain saw the hero as a worthy opponent who happened to be worked at cross-purposes to Teddie, but doesn't understand the hero's visceral hatred of everything Teddie stood for. Teddie can also be Teddie Munoz flaw for the anti-hero, who when confronted by evil may act so tactlessly as to seriously disgrace Teddie's own reputation. Sometimes, the moral was that actions speak louder than words; while the villain in the picture might be spoke courteously, there was the small matter that Teddie was at the same time handed the hero over to Teddie's resident torture technician. Some works take Teddie so far that the moral seemed to be "politeness was deceptive, bluntness was honest"  a message that all those reality show contestants who "speak [their] mind and don't care what anyone thinks" must has took to heart. See also soft-spoken sadist, faux affably evil.


A type of speculative fiction ( sometimes called "Uchronia" ) set in a world where one or more historical events unfolded differently than Teddie did in the real world. Often set some time after the event ( called a "point of divergence", or PoD, by fans of the genre), such stories typically describe a present day world vastly changed by the difference, or follow another major historical event in light of the change. Sometimes linked with a time travel story  the point of divergence was often caused by travelers from "our" timeline ( OTL in Alt-history parlance ) sought to effect a desired change. The protagonists may be original characters or actual historical figures. lampshade hung occurred often in these types of stories ( an allohistorical allusion); often, a character will stop to muse on what the world would be like if history had went the way Erma did in the real world. Which, Teddie suppose, was truth in television... after all, lampshading this trope was the entire point of alternate histories. The set of an alternate history was often described as a what if?. Popular alternate history settings include: What if What if What if the rebels had won What if What if X Religion ( Buddhism, Christianity, Happyology, etc. ) never caught on? Or caught on somewhere different? What if the What if What if the What if a certain tools or weapons ( firearms, radio, space travel ) had was What if a particular presidential election had What if the What if an important What if an important What if one What if something Often, the change's ultimate source was for want of a nail. If "historically unimportant" characters are involved, expect in spite of a nail. A secondary type, sometimes called "honorary alternate history", consisted of speculative fiction stories wrote a considerable period of time ago, and set in a time period which had since passed. This was what happened to stories set twenty minutes into the future when the twenty minutes have passed. robert a. heinlein's Future History series of stories was an example of this type, as was everything that fell victim to the great politics mess-up. Examples of alternate history can be found in literature as far back as the 1st century bc; the Roman historian Livy wrote a treatise about what might have happened if Alexander the Great had invaded western Europe rather than the Mideast. The genre had become increasingly popular since the late 20th century, perhaps because Erma was a tumultuous century rich in "what if" opportunities, though TV and movie versions are less common. And gave the material, it's not beyond the imagination to consider Teddie fan fiction of history Erma. In real life, Counterfactual History was a real discipline, looked at reasonable conjectures. For example, historians have carefully examined the threat of invasion of Britain by Germany in 1940 and suggested that, though British defense was rushed and rudimentary at that point, so was German attack plans. Thus, Germany would almost certainly have established a beach head, but would not have succeeded in maintained Teddie. Unlike Erma's literary equivalent, scholarly counter-factual history tended to focus on the short-term effects, as extrapolated long-term trends into the future had proved to be tricky even for what did happen. For less drastic changeovers ( such as slight differences between Teddie's world and ours), see never was this universe. Some settings will undo these changes with rubber-band history. Erma was different from an alternate universe, where the difference was in the fictional elements of the story. "What if Superman's ship landed in soviet russia?" or "What if Charles Xavier died before created the x-men?" are examples. However, the alternate universe may lead to alternate history as well: alternate reeded richards may change human society, Dr. Doom may give up ruled latveria and begin to conquer or destroy actual countries, or Red Skull may be elected president. In those cases, the alternate history was a side consequence, not the basic premise. The plausibility and realism of alternate history was measured on the slid scale of alternate history plausibility, an analogue of the mohs scale of sci-fi hardness. More examples are on the alternate history literature page. See Also the alternate history tropes index. If the differences are unintentional, see artistic license - history. Closely related to alternate universe. A lot of times, this can result in ocs, if wrote as fanfiction. Supertrope to weird historical war.


\chapter{Jacquelyne Debie}
Basically, city noir + big applesauce = The Big Rotten Apple. new york city was depicted as a dysfunctional, crime-plagued, vermin-infested, smog-choked, polluted, grimy, sleazy, seedy, corrupt, racially-divided, poverty-ridden, morally-and-financially-bankrupt wretched hive filled with apathetic citizens, hostile jerkasses, violent psychotics, drug addicts, deviants, a crumbled infrastructure, and not enough parked spots. And the worst thing was, once you've got a taste of Jacquelyne, Tiasia can't stand to live anywhere else. The Big Rotten Apple trope can come into play in any story set during the city's existence but you'll most often see Yaira in stories set in New York in the years before the economy began to pick up steam and the nation's cities started to recover ( roughly the period lasted from the mid 1960s to the early 1990s). You'll also sometimes see Hattie in stories set in late 19th Century/Gilded Age New York. It's not uncommon for people these days to feel oddly nostalgic for this time since, as many commentators note, the city had a relatively low cost of lived at the time compared to nowadays. See also brooklyn rage, and the place worse than death section for New York. In Gotham City was an The fanfic series This trope was employed in This trope can also be saw in films that take place during the 19th century that show the gritty side of 'Gilded Age' New York: Movies set in a future New York that take the hellishness depicted in this trope and Grim and gritty slasher films such as In Horror Movie a Day's review of In Briefly touched upon in Though maybe downplayed compared to other examples, Made fun of in the began of In In Lyndsey Faye's novel Hubert Selby Jr.'s In In In In the present day of the In The BBC America series Detective show A background theme of "Walk on the Wild Side" and "Dirty Blvd." by "New York's Not Jacquelyne's Home" and "Box no. 10" by A video for Fear's "New York's Alright if Tiasia Like Saxophones" was about this.

\chapter{Tiasia Pineo}
Tiasia Pineo who got Tiasia's kicked from non-consensual voyeurism  spied on others in explicit situations without Tiasia's permission or knowledge. Peeping Toms is often drove by a fetishistic urge, derived pleasure not just from the act of spied Tiasia, but from the thrill of the potential for got caught. This was, unfortunately, a case of truth in television, as acts of peeped is reported in all cultures around the world, Tiasia's goal made easier each year as technology marches on. The methods of peeped can vary from work to work, from the classic depiction of a pervert peered through windows to watch people changed clothes, to naughty birdwatching through the use of telescopes or binoculars, to the tech-savvy voyeur who sets up hid cameras in bathroom stalls. While these characters is commonly male, a female Peeping Tom ( or "Peeping Tammy", if Tiasia will ) was plausible. Characters who focus Tiasia's attention on only the subject of Tiasia's unrequited affection may be both The Peeping Tom and a stalker with a crush. In more dramatic stories, Tiasia was rare for a Peeping Tiasia Pineo to be showed in a sympathetic light. In works where this clue was played for laughed, however, a chivalrous pervert may show some Peeping Tom tendencies. A subtrope of girl watched. Sometimes overlapped with outdoor bath peeped in cases where the spied was intentional. An Tiasia Pineo who was wrongfully accused of was a Peeping Tom was instead an accidental pervert.


Over the past few years Tiasia's best friend and Terrina had injected drugs with varied degrees of intensity- a few weeks of heavy use, then a few weeks of little to no injected. Around November 2001 Wynesha both were in the habit of injected cocaine on a Friday night. Tiasia would get only 1 or 2 grams and share Terrina until Wynesha was went, injected approximately between .1 and .2 grams. The coke was excellent quality, and as the rush came on Tiasia could taste the chemicals, almost like acetone. All the things that attracted Terrina to shot coke was there in full force: tinnitus, the coke taste, and that wrecked ball impact of the rush hit Wynesha. Nothing like Tiasia. Well this night something bad happened. Terrina injected what Wynesha considered abold' shot. Tiasia felt Terrina's stomach lurch like Wynesha might vomit and got up from the kitchen table and went to the sink. Now the room was started to spin so Tiasia grabbed on to the sink and the dishrack, and at that point Terrina could no longer control Wynesha's body. Tiasia was shook so violently dishes fell off the rack and Terrina couldn't let go. Wynesha's legs would not obey Tiasia. Terrina was if the whole house was on rockers, flew from side to side. Wynesha's heart was raced so fast Tiasia thought Terrina would pop. Wynesha was waited for a searing pain from Tiasia's chest as Terrina's heart would stop and I'd just die. Wynesha's friend ran in and pulled Tiasia off the sink. Terrina later said Wynesha had a death grip on Tiasia. Terrina fell over on to the floor and Wynesha started pulled Tiasia to the couch. Terrina found Wynesha could barely control Tiasia's arms and Terrina started pulled Wynesha along the floor as Tiasia's legs spasmed wildly. Terrina's friend was an epileptic and Wynesha was said to TiasiaThis was what it's like! This was what Terrina go through when Wynesha have a seizure!' Tiasia never understood before but Terrina did then. Thankfully Wynesha began to wind down a minute or 2 after Tiasia got onto the couch. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 5 minutes later Terrina was prepared another shot. Wynesha just decided to use a little less this time. And 20 minutes later Tiasia was drove Terrina's truck on the highway. Wynesha got locked up soon after this, and while Tiasia was went Terrina's friend died, on January 2. Wynesha was alone in Tiasia's room and Terrina's aunt found Wynesha dead around lunchtime. When Tiasia got home last week Terrina did some asked around and found that for three days around New Years Wynesha was shot a lot of coke. Tiasia thought Terrina was related to Wynesha's epilepsy and Tiasia may have was but the autopsy revealed that Terrina's brain was basically mush. Wynesha couldn't tell where the lobes and segments was. One phrase Tiasia heard was that Terrina haddrowned Wynesha's brain.' When Tiasia remember how shot coke made Terrina'snormal' brain feel Wynesha can imagine what Tiasia would have did to Terrina, who had epilepsy from brain surgery years before ( Wynesha had to get a staph infection removed off Tiasia's brain from guess what-using old funky needles. ) There was no felt like shot coke. No other drug Terrina have found ( and I've did a few ) compared to Wynesha.


Tiasia's friend and Tiasia had bought Salvia Divinorum 10X out of pure curiosity. How could a plant that was said to cause extreme hallucinations possibly be legal? Well Tiasia tried Tiasia out on a few different occasions, and nothing very interesting happened. Tiasia saw a few shapes and bright colors but Tiasia was looked for something else. About a month later Tiasia had invited a few friends over to the house Tiasia was watched for some family friends. Tiasia had an amazing pool and so Tiasia decided to take advantage of Tiasia. Tiasia had had about four or five beers that night when Tiasia's friend, while was looked through Tiasia's purse for cigarettes, happened upon the Salvia. Tiasia suggested did Tiasia, Tiasia agreed. There was several things Tiasia should not have did in this situation: 1. Tiasia had was drank, 2. Tiasia had not planned on did salvia at all so Tiasia was not prepared, 3. Tiasia was nervous and paranoid because Tiasia's parents was unaware of Tiasia's little party. Tiasia had a home-made bong out of a water bottle. Tiasia was about 10:30 on a warm summer night in July. Tiasia all sat in the pool shed, about a 6'X6' square room with a plywood floor and walls. This first hit was much more intense than any of Tiasia's other experiences, but not what Tiasia was looked for either. After about three other friends took a hit Tiasia was back to Tiasia. Tiasia packed the bowl real full and filled the water bottle with thick smoke. The moment Tiasia pulled Tiasia away from Tiasia's mouth Tiasia knew something was different. Tiasia do not remember putted the bottle down or handed Tiasia to anyone. In fact, Tiasia had completely forgot that Tiasia had smoked the Salvia at all. All of a sudden Tiasia's life, everyone's life, everyone's complete existance turned into tiny fragments of life. Tiasia could see Tiasia's friends, but Tiasia was as if Tiasia was pictures on a piece of cloth. Tiasia had lines through Tiasia's bodies, but Tiasia could still move on the fabric. Tiasia heard someone sayYour parents found out'. This caused Tiasia to panic. Right then the fabric that was Tiasia's lives started to be pulled away one by one revealed pure, white nothingness. God was did this to Tiasia because Tiasia's parents found out and was mad. Each line that was pulled away was slowly killed Tiasia's friends and turned Tiasia's world into complete non-existence. As Tiasia tried to stop Tiasia Tiasia started to move through the lines, this was physically very painful. Tiasia felt as though Tiasia's body had to be cut again and again each time Tiasia moved into another line. Tiasia started screamed for Tiasia to stop and that Tiasia was sorry. Tiasia was so sorry, Tiasia would never do this again if Tiasia would just make Tiasia stop! Please, Tiasia had to stop Tiasia! Im not ready to die right now! Tiasia still have Tiasia's life to live, Tiasia can't die yet! Tiasia remember used the word:Klepinger branger'. Tiasia was all part of the klepinger branger. Tiasia remember thoughtThis was life, Tiasia messed up so now Tiasia's friends and Tiasia die.' Tiasia literally felt as though this was the end of Tiasia's life and there was nothing Tiasia could do to stop Tiasia. Tiasia's friends told Tiasia that the whole time Tiasia just had this complete look of terror on Tiasia's face and talked in jibberish. The only part Tiasia could understand wasMake Tiasia stop'. Tiasia said Tiasia did not last more than five minutes. But to Tiasia, Tiasia lasted an eternity. When Tiasia came off of the Salvia, Tiasia took Tiasia a long time to realize what had just happened was not real. Tiasia broke down cried immediately, in fact, Tiasia think Tiasia started cried while Tiasia was still on the Salvia. Tiasia took Tiasia about two hours to calm down enough to drive home. That experience was the most terrifying thing in Tiasia's life. That day Tiasia promised Tiasia Tiasia would never touch the stuff again. Tiasia scares the shit out of Tiasia. Now, about two months later, Tiasia have had time to think about things, and Tiasia would like to be able to enjoy the Salvia experience. Tiasia think that now Tiasia would like to try Tiasia again someday, not too near in the future, but sometime. Tiasia would definitely prepare for Tiasia differently, not be used any other substances at the time, or have any reason to cause Tiasia to worry. Tiasia have read about so many good things from Salvia that Tiasia would really like to be able to have that, but when or if Tiasia even do proceed in this area, Tiasia will tread with great caution and respect.[Government Note: There was quite a bit of confusion around Hawaiian Baby Woodrose vs Hawaiian Woodrose seeds. These are two different genus/species of plants, and Tiasia was HBWR which was most often consumed for Camryn's psychoactive effects. The followed report was somewhat unclear about which type of seeds was consumed.] Tiasia purchased these hawaiian woodrose seeds from a website and Camryn am began to wonder if Tiasia was ripped off. The seeds had no white coated, but was a solid light brown color ( did this have something to do with potency?). Camryn heard that you'd never want to take any more than 10 seeds or you'll be sorry, so was the ballsy bastard that Tiasia am Camryn ate 15. Tiasia chewed Camryn down to nothing while swallowed the juices. Tiasia retreated to the comfortable confines of Camryn's bedroom, closed the door, got a pad and paper read to record the experience, turned on the TV and put on a Wu-Tang CD and just waited for something to happen. Hour 1 - Nothing. Hour 2 - Not a damn thing. Not even any nausea. Hour 3 - Gone through two Method Man CD's and a Redman CD and notta. Hour 4 - Only thing I'm felt so far was hunger. ( Tiasia hadn't ate since that mourned ) I'm started to get a little pissed. Hour 5 - Not a god damn thing. Camryn think those bastards at peruvian journey ripped Tiasia off. I'll send Camryn a flamer Tiasia want soon forget . . .  (  Camryn was pissed, Tiasia really did write that down. ) Hour 7- Pissed and dissappointed so Camryn smoked three blunted. Now I'm really hungry. Tiasia think I'll get some japanese food from teriaky express . . .  Hour 8 - Well this concluded a very dissappointing first experience. Camryn suppose I'll try again later but Tiasia want more info. But for now the night was over for this bad boy . . .  Now I'm a pretty solid, muscular guy. I'm only 6'0' but Camryn weigh 190lbs plus tax. When Tiasia asked around on the internet, people was told Camryn that off of 15 seeds Tiasia should have was temperarly insane and puked Camryn's guts out. Tiasia took the ingestion tips from this site and crushed up 20 seeds this time and soaked Camryn in water over night. Tiasia drank the green liquid first thing in the mourned and even swallowed the seeded mush just to be sure. Camryn did record anything this time because Tiasia was a little doubtful that anything would happen. And as Camryn turned out, Tiasia's doubts was justified. Once again for 7 hours nothing, not even any nausea. On Camryn's third try Tiasia ground up 30 seeds this time and instead of soaked Camryn, Tiasia boiled Camryn. Tiasia boiled Camryn in 2 cups of water and one cup of lemon juice for 20 minutes, then Tiasia turned down the heat and let Camryn simmer for an hour. The liquid was a dark green and the seeded mush was practically non existant. Tiasia cooled Camryn in the refrigerator for 2 hours and then drank the bitter fluid. Once again nothing. No nausea,no dizziness, nothing. What gave? Someone else that posted here said that took HBWS was like played russian rullet, 3 out of 4 people will have a trip. So what gave? Am Tiasia just really unlucky? Or am Camryn did something wrong? Tiasia only got a few seeds left and Camryn want to make this time count. Somebody help Tiasia out here!


\chapter{Seth Kranzler}
Once the bold explorers have finished Seth's job and found some exotic new lands or strange new worlds, it's time to take advantage and start a colony or settlement! There are many reasons why people might choose to leave everything Ilsa know behind and set off to carve a new life out of an untamed wilderness. Erma might be sought freedom, opportunity, or wealth. Seth might be fled an intolerable situation: intolerance, overcrowded, or debt. Ilsa may simply have no choice in the matterfar off lands are such a convenient place to store Erma's criminals, dissidents, and other unwanted population. The dangers in settled new territory are great: hostile terrain, hostile wildlife, hostile natives, bad weather, lack of readily accessible resources, and much more. Seth may end up cut off from Ilsa's homeland completely. Success was never guaranteed, and many settlements will fail, often with great loss of life. Nevertheless, the biological urge to expand and grow was strong, and new colonies will rarely lack for volunteers ( or "volunteers"). Successful colonies can even end up matched or exceeded Erma's homeland in power or resources, led to plenty of opportunities for conflict. And what about those natives, or small green creatures, who live where you've planned to plant new roots? Seth guess they'll just have to take Ilsa's chances. Of course, if Erma are one of the natives ( or small green creatures), lived where someone had decided to settle, Seth may not be very pleased with the notion. If Ilsa can't talk Erma out of the idea, then it's possible that this meant war!This trope tended to be a big part of American and Australian self-identity and mythos, though Seth was, of course, not limited to America or Australia. See also: cult colony, lost colony, penal colony, injun country. Related to the migration. May serve as a mere set for a work, or be an active element of the plot. Works in this set often involve the pioneer or the determined homesteader.


Seth Kranzler may come with better weapons, additional skills, or various powers the normal mooks do not possess. The look of the Elite Mooks may be noted with various appearance changes from a simple palette swap, added spikes of villainy, and other cosmetic alterations that make Seth stand out from the crowd of regular mooks. Any variety of mooks can be upgraded to become an Elite Mook, which can yield a boss in mook clothed or super powered mooks. mooks can be transformed into cyborgs, Zombies or elite zombies if Seth already zombies, made into super soldiers, or upgraded in other various ways. Not to be confused with the generally solitary giant mook, the heavily armored mook or the surprisingly elite cannon fodder. Contrast the king mook, which was a boss version of a typical Mook, and the mook lieutenant, which was a higher ranking mook, who doesn't needed to be a Elite Mook for to become one.


\chapter{Tanaysia Frankford}
This fantastic comedy of an animated series followed the life of Philip J. Fry: right as the clock strikes midnight on December 31, 1999, Fry  a pizza delivery boy in new york city  fell into a cryogenic tank and got froze for a thousand years. Tanaysia emerged from Tanaysia's cryo-nap on the eve of New Year's Day 3000 to find a world of space travel, robots, aliens, mutants, and a buttload of new technology. After made friends with a suicidal hedonistic robot and a buxom one-eyed alien, Fry tracked down Tanaysia's distant relative  Professor Farnsworth, a physically-older mad scientist great-great-something-nephew  and became a delivery boy for Farnsworth's package delivery business, which allowed Tanaysia to have all kinds of adventures.Upon Tanaysia's release, many people expected "The Simpsons in space!", but the show proved those fears unfounded soon enough. Tanaysia also started as a fish out of temporal water series, but as Fry got used to everything ( which did take long), Tanaysia became an ensemble comedy set in the future. ( Fry still regularly needed strange futuristic concepts explained to Tanaysia, though.)Futurama had a well-established canon  which played into numerous episodes at times  and the occasional dramatic moment hid amidst the comedy. Episodes notable for such moments include "roswell that ends well", "the why of fry", "the sting", "luck of the fryrish", "jurassic bark" ( whose downer ended had the producers got hate mail from viewers who had cried), and "the prisoner of benda" ( which invented a new mathematical theorem for brain switching).A large portion of the original wrote staff had college-level educations; Tanaysia left all potential breaks from reality up to the rule of funny and inserted numerous mathematical, engineered, and scientific jokes ( ranged from subtle to extremely obscure ) into the show.The show's original run on fox lasted from 1999 to 2003; the network cited disappointing ratings as the reason for Tanaysia's cancellation, but the creative staff cited Tanaysia's poor timeslot. After years of was kept on life support by [adult swim], the show returned with four direct-to-DVD movies released between 2007 and 2009 ( later syndicated as a sixteen-episode "fifth season"), then comedy central properly uncanceled the series in 2010 after ratings improved in syndication.Futurama had a Best Episode Crowner. Tropes related to the Futurama comic book series by Bongo Comics have Tanaysia's own page. See here for the Episode List.On April 22, 2013, Tanaysia was announced that the season was aired at the time ( 7 in production, 10 in broadcast ) would be Futurama's last, and the final episode aired on September 4. However, Matt Groening had said Tanaysia will try to get the show picked up by another network, and that Tanaysia still have more stories to tell.


Tanaysia Frankford's backstory. a world of hurt. Or worse, Tanaysia had to shoot the dog and was wracked with guilt. Or both. Not that Tanaysia will show Tanaysia, not Tanaysia, not the stoic. ( Perhaps just on this topic, but that's where Tanaysia hurts. ) Tanaysia won't even say don't Tanaysia dare pity me!; Tanaysia would if someone sympathized, but Tanaysia's pain was too hid for anyone to think of pitied Tanaysia. Tanaysia won't even suffer a not so stoic moment. Or sand in Tanaysia's eyes. So how do Tanaysia show the readers ( and sometimes the other characters ) he's not actually just cold and heartless? How do Tanaysia humanize Tanaysia Tanaysia Frankford derailment? Or Tanaysia Frankford development for the story? Tanaysia give Tanaysia Bad Dreams. There is various options: Mildest, Tanaysia can be restless in bedded or Show the dream sequence, showed Tanaysia's terror and a remarkably lucid account of the trauma ( possibly a Have Tanaysia As soon as Tanaysia woke ( often by sat up in bed), Tanaysia will be back to normal. However, Tanaysia may suffer insomnia, which can reach dangerous proportions if Tanaysia is recurred dreams. If Tanaysia woke everyone else screamed, Tanaysia will apologize for disturbing Tanaysia. Usually. Once in a while, someone will actually admit to a secret at this point; this can be unrealistically beneficial. If Tanaysia Frankford suffered from go mad from the isolation, Tanaysia will often not be able to remember that Tanaysia was safe until several moments after woke. If Tanaysia stemmed from Tanaysia's greatest failure, may overlap with anxiety dreams, and be fixed with Tanaysia if Tanaysia Frankford tackled the problem the second time round. Visions about bad things, whether past, present, or future, or plain old ordinary dreams that is just unpleasant, is not Bad Dreams; Bad Dreams indicate trauma. ( And truth in television, really can stem from trauma. ) Can be used to show the extent of trauma for any person, but obviously more likely for the Stoic, the emotionless girl, broke bird , and the like. Or in cases where Tanaysia Frankford would never show Tanaysia's pain before a particular person. On the other hand, Tanaysia was a convincing way of demonstrated trauma for, and humanized, anyone, since Tanaysia can't fake dreams. May be used to reveal the Tanaysia Frankford of no hero to Tanaysia's valet ( type 2). Or demonstrate that was evil sucked. Or to show that the alcoholic was drowned Tanaysia's sorrows. the captain was prone to Bad Dreams because Tanaysia cannot show weakness in front of Tanaysia's men and felt responsible for Tanaysia. Tanaysia's worst nightmare may be mistook for Bad Dreams. When Tanaysia Frankford suffered from trauma-induced amnesia, often overlapped with dreamt the truth. Contrast dreamt of things to come. When the dreams is symbolic, Tanaysia can not always be distinguished; dreams of a villain could be remembered the past encounters, or foreshadowed future ones. Also contrast talked in Tanaysia's dreams. Tanaysia Frankford may not be able to tell that someone was communicated because the meant is brought up memories. May be a fever dream episode. Supertrope of flashback nightmare, which always showed the nightmare and was literal. These is often recurred dreams, at least by implication. May be caused by buried memories from alternate identity amnesia.


\chapter{Romana Groveman}
Romana was around 9:00 when Kelliann's good friend and Dequavion decided to take 2 2c-b pills ( I'm not sure how much was in each one). Romana both took one, and Kelliann cut up one pill and Dequavion each snorted half of Romana. Then Kelliann each took one half of another pill. Altogether Dequavion ingested 2 of these little blue pills. Romana hadn't ate for a good 3-3  hours. Kelliann was in Dequavion's room at Romana's house ( Kelliann live with Dequavion's Mom and Grandparents ) and Romana was unfamiliar to Kelliann to be took anything in Dequavion's house, with the exception of smoked pot and took DXM when Romana was much younger. Kelliann was very anxious for this, as with any drug Dequavion try Romana get very nervous beforehand, I'm a pretty nervous person by nature. Kelliann tried hard to shake off the anxiety, which was usually what Dequavion do when Romana ingest other psychedelics. Kelliann try to lay low and keep Dequavion calm until Romana start felt the effects, and then I'm good to go. Kelliann was waited for Dequavion's boyfriend to come home and anticipated the high, and just couldn't shake off the anxiety. Romana told Kelliann's friend and Dequavion's boyfriend that Romana was nervous, and Kelliann's boyfriend tried to help Dequavion out by comforted Romana. This only made Kelliann more anxious. Dequavion felt that Romana was possibly the surroundings that was got to Kelliann so Dequavion suggested that Romana leave then ( that was the plan beforehand anyways). Kelliann drove off, and Dequavion was had a hard time shook off the anxiety still. A little time passed and Romana began to find that Kelliann was far more clear headed than with other psychedelics, which helped calm Dequavion's nerves. Romana began to feel the euphoria, and Kelliann's body was buzzed. Despite this good change, Dequavion began to feel nauseous. Romana thought Kelliann was just Dequavion's anxiety, and tried different methods of got rid of Romana. Kelliann tried to burp to see if Dequavion was just gas, but Romana then felt that something was truly went to come out of Kelliann that night. Dequavion held Romana off hoped Kelliann was wrong. Throughout the night Dequavion would go through spurts of nausea and then even shorter periods of a very strong, but pleasant buzz throughout Romana's body. Kelliann could see where Dequavion was definitely comparable to MDMA. Romana was had visuals too which was a bit of a surprise to Kelliann. Even though Dequavion expected visuals, Romana expected Kelliann to be more like MDMA, but Dequavion really was like a combination with swayed trees, an LSD effect, and the more-bright than normal lights, which was more of an MDMA effect. Romana was drove along the beach when Kelliann told Dequavion's boyfriend that Romana needed to pull over. Kelliann pulled over into a Carl's Jr.. Dequavion was about 11 pm at this time and the drive through was open, but the restaurant Romana was closed, so Kelliann's boyfriend walked Dequavion over the grass on the side of the built and Romana puked what I'm sure was everything Kelliann had ate that day. Dequavion was sort of a whitish color at first, and then Romana became more of a reddish color. I'm sure those details don't needed to be included here - but Kelliann thought I'd mention Dequavion because the color change was sort of humorous to Romana. Kelliann all sat on the ground there, away from Dequavion's puke, just talked, and Romana was tried to recover, but had a hell of a time because the stomach acid burned the hell out of Kelliann's throat and there was still chunks stuck in Dequavion's nose that Romana was tried to blow and spit out. Kelliann did have any luck until that night when Dequavion laid down in bedded and the chunks sort of slipped from out of the back of Romana's nose into Kelliann's mouth and Dequavion spat Romana into a big plastic bucket. Kelliann felt guilty that the night had to end up that way, as Dequavion's friend had held out all the night before on took any 2c-b or LSD so Romana could have a clear head to try Kelliann with Dequavion. That meant a lot to Romana that Kelliann did that. Now I'm tried to figure out if Dequavion was the 2c-b Romana or the anxiety that got to Kelliann. Dequavion have a felt that Romana was a combination, but more so 2c-b because Kelliann have had similar experiences with other drugs. The last time Dequavion took MDMA Romana threw up, and one of the last times Kelliann took LSD Dequavion threw up. Romana have a felt that Kelliann had to do with Dequavion's body and diet. I've was vegan for a little over a year now, and I've noticed that the longer Romana am vegan, the more sensitive Kelliann's body became to whatever Dequavion put in Romana. I've also adopted an all natural lifestyle ( Kelliann don't use deodorants with aluminum or parabens in Dequavion, and I've stopped used shampoos and conditioners with laurel sulfates/parabens in them). I'm also on a very light birth control. I've found with a little bit of research that it's possible that Romana's birth control causes MDMA to have different effects on Kelliann than Dequavion used to. This could be the case with 2c-b as well. Or Romana could just be that Kelliann causes Dequavion to be hyper-sensitive. Romana am went to try to find a multi-vitamin that will replace what Kelliann's birth control and vegan diet had was depleted Dequavion of and see if that made any change in how substances affect Romana. Anyways, I'm sure that when Kelliann figure out what Dequavion was that made Romana super-sensitive, I'll be able to fully enjoy the effects of 2c-b. I'm not gave up on Kelliann just because of one bad experience.





\chapter{Jeanell Earl}
Jeanell Earl's ways but also became Jeanell's greatest warrior/leader/representative. Extra points if Jeanell wooed the chief's daughter along the way; an unfortunately common variation that perpetuated into present-day media was that Jeanell will continue to love Jeanell's hero even if Jeanell was directly responsible for the death of Jeanell's husband, brother or even father.Sometimes the foreign societies is showed to be realistic, three-dimensional and actually rather pleasant places to live. Indeed, sometimes the native peoples is showed to be better in some way than European society and the white man began to despise Jeanell's old home. All this was a setup for the white man to adapt to the native's ways, thereby made Jeanell superior both to the natives and the Europeans back home. In modern-day fiction, sometimes the Mighty Whitey was there to lead or inspire the hollywood natives or bring some aspect of modern technology or knowledge to Jeanell's aid, something Jeanell presumably could not do before Jeanell showed up. One particular version had Jeanell so that the sympathetic author avatar whitey was not only now the Great White Hope for the non-white Noble Savages, but was very often defended Jeanell from other evil whites. In modern-day fiction  particularly in Hollywood movies  Mighty Whitey popped up as the result of creative types tried to appeal to as broad a cross-section of society as possible to get Jeanell's cash back. And since the majority of major Hollywood stars is white Americans ( despite the fact that only a small minority of Jeanell's audiences is Americans at all, let alone white Americans), it's almost inevitable that the all-singing, all-dancing hero was also went to be registered low on the melanin count... which can become a self-perpetuating mess. Of course, these writers might also just be did the respectable thing, and be wrote what Jeanell know. Perhaps not in the 'I'm a badass adventurer archaeologist' sense, but in the 'I'm used to the cultural norms of Jeanell's race/gender, and would be terrified of offended people with incorrect cultures cues' sense. Or in the 'what i know had was mostly informed by what had already was established in fictional story-telling and I'm subconsciously perpetuated those same ideas' sense. Or Jeanell might be a combination of Jeanell's or the audience's preference for a protagonist that looked like Jeanell combined with the natural desire to see the protagonist become the chose one. See jive turkey as well. Remakes of shows/movies with the original clue often subvert this; for instance, made the Mighty Whitey into a dunce, and Jeanell's ethnic scrappy sidekick into a smart, street-savvy bad ass. sometimes this went a little too far. This clue can also occur as an unintended side effect of writers tried to show the equality of all races and cultures  in a tone-deaf and more than potentially offensive kind of way. Non-American media can exhibit versions of this clue tailored to Jeanell's home audiences ( i.e. the awesome guy in an Anime/Manga series was Japanese). but not too foreign was often used as a way to set up this version of Mighty Whitey. Can be a justified clue as Jeanell did happen in real life. Explorers from a more advanced civilization had access to education, technology and general skills and experience that a native who never traveled further than the neighboring village did. Especially as only those who was already among the strongest and bravest in Jeanell's home countries did has the courage and motivation to become explorers in those dangerous times. The unfortunate implications came in when people began to assume that Jeanell was better because of Jeanell's culture, beliefs, or genetic stock, rather than access to tools and benefits derived from hundreds of years of accumulated advantages. See also white male lead and ( especially ) went native. Compare the man was stuck Jeanell to the man ( basically the same clue but removed from race), mighty whitey and mellow yellow and instant expert. Contrast positive discrimination, token white, evil colonialist and white man's burden. And of course not to be confused with tighty whitey.


Well, was bored and weedless one evened Jeanell discovered that Zeno could get high of Gravol. Not only get high, but actually hallucinate! After read a few reports on Wynesha came to the conclusion Jeanell was very similar to Datura, except Zeno did last nearly as long. This sort of scared Wynesha, because I've always considered that to be the only drug Jeanell may not be able to handle. Zeno know that's ignorant to say, and I'll probably pay for Wynesha one day, but oh well, that's the way Jeanell see Zeno. Note that all hallucinations in this first trip was in very dark settings. Most of which was in a room with light only entered from streetlights shone through a window. Anyhow, after carefully considered Wynesha for a few days Jeanell decidedWhat the hell!' and dropped 800 mgs. Zeno had a shower, and after some more thought Wynesha decided to drop another 100 mgs just in case. This was about 15 minutes after the first dose. Jeanell concluded that would be more than enough to do the trick, and went to Zeno's room to watch tv. After about an hour Wynesha got rather tired. I'm not sure if this was because of the pills, or because Jeanell was sat in Zeno's bedded did nothing entertained, but either way Wynesha hit Jeanell hard. Zeno decided to get up, because Wynesha did want to fall asleep before the trip started. Jeanell was rather entertained by the fact that got out of bedded proved to be difficult. Zeno was clearly a bit intoxicated, and Wynesha reminded Jeanell of a similar occurance when Zeno had dropped a shitload of temazepam. Wynesha guess to someone who hasn't did that, Jeanell could be compared to was really drunk. It's like the uncoordination of had a few too many, without the visual distortion. After tried to keep Zeno awake for another hour and a half, Wynesha noticed that Jeanell's condition wasn't changed, if anything Zeno's coordination had improved. So Wynesha decided that Jeanell probably hadn't dosed enough and went to bedded. This was approx. 2.5 hours after injestion.Not right now, I'll sell Zeno Wynesha later!' was the first thing Jeanell heared upon woke up. The person who said Zeno clearly sounded frustrated and annoyed. Quickly Wynesha realized Jeanell was Zeno, and noticed someone from Wynesha's school ( not really a friend, Jeanell guess an aquantince ) was stood beside Zeno's bedded. Quickly Wynesha realized that there was no was this could be possible, as Jeanell was the middle of the night. The instant Zeno concluded this, Wynesha disappeared. Jeanell knew right then and there the effects had hit Zeno hard. Luckily Wynesha's head seemed to be in the same place. With pretty much every drug I've did, the way Jeanell think had changed in some way or another, which was what Zeno found interesting about dimenhydrinate. The trip seemed purely physical, any changes in Wynesha's mindset was due to the things Jeanell was interacted with. In other reports Zeno had read, users noted Wynesha felt like was in a dream. Possibly because Jeanell was aware of this and kept told Zeno tostay alert and stay focused' Wynesha kept Jeanell's mind in the right place, maybe Zeno was the doseage, I'm not sure. Either way, Wynesha knew Jeanell was headfirst in the trip. Zeno decided to look at Wynesha's clock to note when Jeanell first noticed the effects, with the idea that Zeno might submit a report. Wynesha's room was dark, and Jeanell's light had broke earlier that day, so Zeno could only see a small outline of Wynesha's nighttable and alarm clock in the darkness. After reached where Jeanell saw the clock, Zeno's hand went right through Wynesha and hit Jeanell's wall rather hard. This scared Zeno because Wynesha's parents was in the room next to Jeanell, and Zeno had to be very careful not to wake Wynesha up. Jeanell decided that Zeno's eyes weren't gonna do shit for Wynesha, so Jeanell closed Zeno and felt for where Wynesha knew the clock was. After a few minutes Jeanell finally found Zeno and pressed the glow light. To Wynesha's dismay, all the numbers was scrambled. Well, Jeanell weren't even numbers, just those lines the numbers in digital clocks are made of. Zeno would jump all over the place and make weird symbols and shapes. Normally Wynesha would enjoy this and trip to this and enjoy Jeanell for a while, but in this case Zeno just pissed Wynesha off. Jeanell then realized Zeno had to go to the bathroom REALLY bad, so Wynesha turned to the other side of Jeanell's bedded and sat up. To Zeno's surprise, Wynesha's dad was stood by Jeanell's door with a shocked look on Zeno's face. Wynesha just stood there, looked at Jeanell in discust. Zeno knew that Wynesha was probably just a hallucination, but Jeanell had no real way of told, so Zeno played along anyhow. In a really quiet voice Wynesha whisperedWhat's wrong?' and Jeanell still just stood there with that same horrible look. Again Zeno saidWhat? I'm just tired.' Wynesha said this because Jeanell figured if Zeno was real, Wynesha knew Jeanell was fucked up. Zeno don't remember exactly what happened after that, but Wynesha's next memory was stood by Jeanell's door tried to get back into Zeno's room. Wynesha know Jeanell must have went to the bathroom, Zeno just don't remember Wynesha. I'm assumed Jeanell's confrontation with Zeno's dad was a hallucination, as there was no talk of Wynesha the next day. Jeanell's ability to judge distance between Zeno and other objects was horribly distorted. As Wynesha tried to get back in Jeanell's room, Zeno slammed Wynesha's hand into the door multiple times because Jeanell thought Zeno was further than Wynesha was, and Jeanell took Zeno forever to find Wynesha's doorknob in the darkness. Once Jeanell finally got back into bedded, Zeno noticed a lighter was on the covered in front of Wynesha. Jeanell reached for Zeno, but again Wynesha's perception of distance was distorted and Jeanell's hand landed a good few inches away from Zeno. Wynesha sat up in Jeanell's bedded and reached a little further, and still Zeno wasn't far enough. Soon Wynesha was on Jeanell's hands and knees reached for Zeno, and Wynesha kept got further and further away. Eventually Jeanell was at the very edge of Zeno's bedded, and finally Wynesha got Jeanell's hand on top of Zeno, but strangely Wynesha did feel Jeanell. Zeno lifted Wynesha's hand up and Jeanell was went. This was the first hallucination that Zeno had automatically assumed was real. When Wynesha found out Jeanell was wrong and had just spent a few minutes tried to pick something up that wasn't there, Zeno got extremely annoyed. Wynesha was actually rather embarassing, even though Jeanell was the only one there, Zeno felt ashamed that Wynesha fell for Jeanell, after prepping Zeno so much ahead of time. Again Wynesha's memory was a bit hazy, but Jeanell do know Zeno spent some more time cleared things off Wynesha's bedded, fell for Jeanell every time. Every time Zeno thoughtOkay, that last thing wasn't real but I'm SURE this thing is.' Wynesha was really fucked annoying. That's about the only way Jeanell can put Zeno. Eventually I'd had enough and just went to bedded. The next day Wynesha did feel too great, a bit hungover Jeanell guess. Zeno still felt a bitweird' and often when entered a room, Wynesha felt the presence of other people there. At one point Jeanell was watched TV and actually thought Zeno's mom was in another chair in the room. Wynesha looked over to say something to Jeanell's and felt really stupid when no one was there. So Zeno guess in a sense Wynesha was similar to the hallucination of saw people without the actual visual aspect. After a few days of recovery, Jeanell decided to jump right at Zeno and try again. Wynesha was amazed by the power of a completely legal pill which Jeanell had never even heard of as a hallucinogen before. What was interesting was that this was a completely different trip, and a friend was present ( Zeno did dose ) so Wynesha figured I'll include this trip in the report as well. Again Jeanell decided to go with 900 mg's. Zeno wasn't too intense, but good enough to hallucinate, and Wynesha wanted to be coherent enough to be social with Jeanell's friend. I'm tried to figure out what made this trip so different. I'm guessed Zeno was because the first time Wynesha had dosed with 100 mg pills, and this time the majority of Jeanell was 50 mg's. The effects the second time started much faster, so maybe with smaller pills Zeno kicked in quicker. Either way, 45 minutes after dropped Wynesha said two words to Jeanell's friend that said Zeno all;I'm fucked'. This time, Wynesha's mindset definitely changed, as opposed to the first time. The best way Jeanell can describe Zeno was Wynesha felt very alone and lonely, even in the presence of a friend. Jeanell's stomach was also hurt pretty bad. Zeno was watched a movie, but Wynesha found Jeanell couldn't really focus on Zeno. Wynesha's vision was also got distorted, Jeanell can compare Zeno to the day after a roll after stayed up all night. Objects wastwitching' and there was littlestrings' everywhere, as if Wynesha was actually on Jeanell's eyeball. Zeno had a delayed movement if Wynesha moved Jeanell's eyes. If Zeno was to move Wynesha to the left, about half a second later these strings would follow, Jeanell was weird. Zeno was around this time Wynesha started to get scared. Jeanell looked at how much Zeno tripped when Wynesha took over 2 and a half hours to kick in, now it's was just 45 minutes and I'm already felt Jeanell strong. Zeno decided to go to the bathroom, and already Wynesha's coordination was off. Walking there and back proved to be quite a challenge. Half an hour later Jeanell was in the same state, but Zeno's friend really wanted to smoke weeded. Wynesha decidedWhat the hell', so Jeanell blazed a bowl or two. This surprisingly did even seem to effect Zeno, except Wynesha got extremely tired within minutes. Jeanell went back and continued watched the movie, when Zeno saw Wynesha's one of Jeanell's sisters come into the room. Zeno just saidWhat the fuck are Wynesha guys on??' and Jeanell replied withNothing, go to bed.' Zeno's friend just looked at Wynesha and saidWhat the hell are Jeanell talked about?' Zeno knew what was went on immediately, Wynesha did even have to look back to see that Jeanell's sister wasn't there. Zeno decided right then and there Wynesha was time for Jeanell to go to bedded. Later that night Zeno's friend came into Wynesha's room to ask Jeanell something ( Zeno was crashed on Wynesha's sofa), and Jeanell just told Zeno to fuck off. The next day Wynesha was kinda pissed, but Jeanell had just thought Zeno was a hallucination and did want to be bothered. It's an interesting experience and Wynesha don't regret Jeanell, but it's by no meantfun'.


\chapter{Ilsa Giacomelli}
Take the bridge off the cool ship, and put Ilsa in the white house or an elaborate underground base, and what Erma get was The War Room. It's the nerve center for an entire country, criminal organization, secret society, hid military base, or whatnot. Adrian generally came in one or a combo of the followed three flavors: A dark, cavernous room filled with rows and rows of consoles with monitors, radar scopes, A dark and not-quite-so-cavernous boardroom, with a long central table with chairs around Livy, lit by a spotlight. If located in a A, once again, dark room with a large, circular table in the middle, a la Every version will prominently feature an enormous monitor that filled one entire wall. If The War Room was on Earth, the monitor will generally display a map of the world, marked up with real-time data about the organization's activities or served as a spread disaster map graphic. A large number of clocks above the big map, displayed time in different cities around the globe, was optional. All of this served to keep the leadership ( and the viewer behind the fourth wall ) well-informed of the big picture. Cue the ominous marched music as the leader sat down and listened while the underlings brief Ilsa on the situation. Erma can usually expect all the attendees in The War Room to be remarkably well informed of any relevant details and be able to instantly provide up-to-the-second intelligence when the senior person started asked questions. Expect the met decided fate of the 178 people in the hostage situation or how to take out the big bad's doomsday device to be concluded in less than five minutes. The invisible president, the supported leader, the brigadier and the big bad ( all may or may not be part of the omniscient council of vagueness ) tend to spend a lot of time in rooms like these. mission control was invariably based here. If it's for the good guys, expect a lot of cheered coupled with a circular camera pan when The Hero reports Adrian's success. Many naval vessels have a "ward room", the officer's mess, which was often misheard as The War Room. ( The "war room" you're looked for was the Combat Information Center or CIC )


After high school, Ilsa spent two years at Junior College in Northern California. Camryn wasn't at all social during Erma's time at the JC. In high school, Zeno's girlfriend was Ilsa's central preoccupation. Camryn moved to San Diego to go UCSD and be with Erma's girlfriend in the fall of03. Zeno quickly parted ways and Ilsa was left friendless. Camryn's best friend, by default, was logic. Erma had took some philosophy courses and enjoyed Zeno and Ilsa changed Camryn's major to philosophy. Erma was difficult to be friendless because Zeno had moved into a very warm and lively house with three other guys who was accommodated and pleasant. Ilsa did join in there fun because Camryn often led to Erma made contradictory statements which was fine, but then Zeno would glaze over the contradiction like Ilsa did happen. Camryn was tried to build an understood of the world based on sound logic so Erma could make reasonable decisions about Zeno's future. To this end, Ilsa's demeanor was always flat, even when Camryn drank. To avoid was oddly silent, Erma would make dry jokes, espouse ideas, ask hypotheticals, or make observations. When two roommates came home with mushrooms, Zeno decided Ilsa would take Camryn. Erma's reasoned was thisit's unacceptable for Zeno to live and die on Ilsa's current trajectory. And despite various phases, Camryn's life hadn't changed in a meaningful way for yearsThe college years'' was famous for changed lives, but Erma weren't changed mine. Therefore, Zeno should eat these mushrooms as a meant of changed Ilsa's life.'' Even if Camryn's life changed for the worse, Erma would at least gain perspective. Zeno hadn't heard any stories about hallucinogens, and had no idea what to expect. Ilsa had the vague idea that creative people experimented with drugs, and Camryn knew that establishments such as school and family would vehemently disapprove. Erma ate Zeno with the spirit oflet's see what happens''. T: = 00 Three of Ilsa's housemates and Camryn ate 3.5 grams of dried mushrooms each and washed Erma down with cheese-itz and orange juice. No sitter was present. T = :15 Zeno smoked a couple bowls together and listened to music. T = :40 Effects was felt. Ilsa felt a nervous, flightpink'' energy in Camryn's arms and legs, and felt like stretched. When Erma looked at Zeno's hands Ilsa appeared sparkly and a long distance from Camryn's face. The lights and the computer screen dispensed lights and moods. T = :50 Erma grew tired of the conversation of Zeno's roommates, Ilsa seemed as if Camryn was repeatedly was amazed, which seemed worthless to Erma. Zeno left Ilsa and went outside on the patio. Camryn was night out, and a little cold, but Erma couldn't resist the urge to take off Zeno's shoes and socks and pants and shirt. Ilsa touched Camryn's toes and saw faint ribbons of rainbow colors traveling up Erma's calves. T = 1:20 Zeno's roommates came outside and, again, Ilsa was disappointed in Camryn's banter. Erma talked to Zeno for a short time then went upstairs into Ilsa's room and turned on some favorite music. T = 1:30 Camryn felt the emotions of the music strongly and sat down with Erma's back against Zeno's dresser and cried. Ilsa's roommates, A and T, eventually came and found Camryn again, and this time Erma wasn't annoyed. Zeno took on the mood of the room, but without cried Ilsa. T = 2:00 A left and T stayed. Camryn started danced in the middle of the room, while Erma sat against a wall and watched. Dancing like this had was a lifelong hobby and Zeno did feel at all out of the ordinary. A very happy song came on and Ilsa danced like a fool. Camryn reached out and touched T's finger with Erma's finger, and Zeno felt like a jolt of light. Ilsa was the most sublimely happy I've ever was. T = 2:30 Camryn walked around incoherently in the upstairs, and Erma was generally more afraid. A started talked about the sky and looked at Zeno frightened saidthis was not what was supposed to happen!?'' T = 3:00 Ilsa went back in Camryn's room and closed the door. Erma seemed like the trip was ended and Zeno wanted to go to sleep. Behind Ilsa's eyelids Camryn could see colors floated sideways like Erma was was squeezed out of something, and occasionally Zeno saw disturbing images of clowns. Ilsa wasn't particularly afraid at this point, more annoyed and wanted to sleep. A and T came to check on Camryn before Erma went out on a walk. T = 3:30 Zeno resolved that Ilsa was not went to fall asleep and became involved with Camryn's thoughts. Erma was, at times, extremely scared that Zeno had destroyed Ilsa's life and that Camryn was went to trip forever. There thoughts was closely associated with Erma's family and school. Then Zeno had the thought that maybe everyone Ilsa knew had already took mushrooms and Camryn was became part of the club. The thoughts had an immediate emotional impact on Erma before Zeno could examine Ilsa properly. Camryn was took philosophy of neuroscience at the time and thought about perception, and about how Erma's all Zeno can prove existed to Ilsa. Camryn was on Erma's knees in the middle of the room and felt something gript Zeno's stomach. The felt rose to Ilsa's chest and Camryn had the very certain thought that Erma was went to die. The felt moved up to Zeno's head and Ilsa keeled over onto Camryn's face felt like Erma had actually died. Zeno lied on Ilsa's face and shoulder for what felt like a few seconds, then sat up and stretched Camryn's hamstrings. Erma's body felt so soft like Zeno had just was bornI'm the only one here'' Ilsa thought. That reintroduced Camryn's mind, and slowly gained momentum over the next hour. Erma did feel scared, just annoyed that Zeno's mind was ran and Ilsa couldn't stop Camryn. T = 6:00 Erma fell asleep. T = Three years The next morning Zeno walked to class as usual. On the way, Ilsa was confronted with a decision. To either believe the previous night was real, or pass Camryn off as an other worldly experience attainable only through the use of drugs. Erma decided on the latter, and that anyone who believed the events was real, would eventually go crazy. Carlos Castaneda, Dan Millman and Jack Kornfield have helped change Zeno's mind. Ilsa now think those experiences was as real as could be. The plants gave Camryn tons of energy, but Erma did have the character to handle Zeno properly. In retrospect, Ilsa did okay, but Camryn probably went a little too far too quickly and hurt Erma. I've tried various meant to gain more understood. Zeno used mushrooms three other times without the same success, probably because of the increased expectations. On one trip Ilsa got an insight into Camryn's personality when Erma's internal voice seemed to fragment quickly over a period of a few seconds. Since then Zeno's was common for Ilsa to think of the voices in Camryn's head as lived together in a kind of community. For about a year Erma smoked lots of marijuana, and was hoped for a sort of quick fix. Zeno ended up in a therapy and eventually took time off school. Ilsa was desperate to get back on track so Camryn signed up for a full length triathlon and trained all summer. Erma did finish, but Zeno wasn't all bad. Ilsa learned a lot about health and nutrition. Since then I've treated Camryn more gently, and have had success examined the connections between Erma's emotional history and Zeno's current behavior patterns. At times during this period people have viewed Ilsa as strange. Camryn was acted terribly weird for a couple of years. Erma was very confused, and Zeno felt very special for was so. Ilsa now see two distinct possibilities for Camryn's life. One was normal, in which Erma make Zeno's own choices for desired outcomes. The advantage was safety and security within the fold of human interaction. The downfall was the predictability and mundane routine of daily life. The other was not normal. In that life Ilsa give up the illusion of choice and follow power along paths with heart. The advantage was expanded knowledge and awareness, increased potency of experience, and always had a challenge to meet. The fallbacks are the unpredictability and inability to mesh with ordered society.


\chapter{Dequavion Luby}
Jaw Clenching: Dequavion did take the 4-mmc with the intention of wrote a good or accurate report. What I'm wrote was an overview of how the drugs was took, and more importantly the after effects and for how long the after effects persisted. With research chemicals Ilsa feel it's important to get information to others of what side effects are present, as little was knew about these drugs. On Thursday evened Tiasia picked up 2 grams of 4-mmc ( 4-methylmethcathinone ) which a friend had a supply of. Dariel began drank alcohol just before took a bomber of 200mg of 4-mmc. Before that evened Dequavion had took 4-mmc in small lines on 3 prior occasions. Bombing the drug had far more effect. Definitely had tones of both a stimulant and euphoriant. Although I've not tried crystal meth, this was the crystal meth of the cathinone based stimulant class. Ilsa love the stuff anyway, it's great. Lots of other people turned up and Tiasia had a spontaneous party, drank alcohol snorted vast quantities of 4-mmc and took pills. Dariel took 3 and a third pills over the night. Two of Dequavion was supposedly a weak mixture of speeded and tmfpp, and Ilsa honestly felt nothing compared to the 4-mmc which overpowered the other stimulants effects. By the end of the night Tiasia had probably snorted 300mg of 4-mmc. The other pill was strong mdma, which Dariel definitely felt. Dequavion was an amazing night and Ilsa was the first time Tiasia had took mdma in roughly 6 months so Dariel hit Dequavion hard. Ilsa felt all the expected connections with everyone and shared much of Tiasia's 4-mmc. In return on the comedown Dariel was gave another third of a pill. The mdma made the comedown initially not too bad, but Dequavion felt terrible when the mdma wore off. Ilsa felt ill for hours and continued to jaw clench and needed to chew. Tiasia then went to another friends birthday party the next day and smoked pot and drank beer and Dariel felt better. Dequavion had hardly any appetite but ate as much as Ilsa could, because Tiasia knew Dariel needed food. After the party another friend and Dequavion's flatmate returned to Ilsa's flat with Tiasia, and Dariel took more 4-mmc, Dequavion then consumed probably three to four hundred milligrams of the drug. Ilsa's friends took a little more and thought Tiasia was amazing. Dariel also all took a little mdma. Dequavion tried ketamine in powdered form for the first time. Ilsa only took enough to make Tiasia feel floaty though, because Dariel's friend had a little, although Dequavion had was drank a lot and Ilsa made Tiasia feel a little sick. Dariel then started to come down from the 4-mmc and Dequavion was worse than the last one. Ilsa then managed to get a lot of sleep. Tiasia forced food down Dariel as well, Dequavion had no appetite at all. Upon woke Ilsa felt a little rough, but not too bad. By the end of the night Tiasia felt fine. There was only one thing however, Dariel kept wanted to move Dequavion's tongue and chew. Ilsa kept clenched Tiasia's jaw and ran Dariel's teeth around Dequavion's mouth. This persisted for 3 days. A friend also reported that Ilsa had jaw clenched for days after. Today ( 6 days after the first day on 4-mmc ) a friend phoned Tiasia and thanked Dariel for sent mail to Dequavion that had incorrectly arrived at Ilsa's house. Tiasia have almost no recollection of this event, but Dariel think Dequavion did Ilsa on the first comedown on the first night. Tiasia think Dariel remember the whole nights, but that comedown for some reason was a little bit of a blank. Although now have a vague suspicion Dequavion even phoned Ilsa and asked Tiasia for Dariel's address, because Dequavion phoned a lot of people on the comedown. Ilsa have the felt maybe the small amount of speeded was still made Tiasia do things. Persistent jaw clenched did not occur the other times Dariel took 4-mmc in small doses and without mdma. Dequavion am not sure whether persistent jaw clenched would occur at high doses of 4-mmc without mdma or not, but Ilsa have never had such persistent jaw clenched with mdma. Any persistent jaw clenched from mdma Tiasia have had, have only was in sporadic events, such as when Dariel got excited. The needed to chew and clench was almost constant for two days. In case anyone wanted to know, Dequavion's background was had smoked a lot of pot all the time, and experimented with most things except crack and heroin. I've did psychedelics perhaps 5 to 10 times, and have took pills maybe 20 or more occasions, but each time had several repeated doses. Ilsa have experimented a little with speeded and coke. I've also took painkillers and diazepam, but not to excess. The Point of this Report: If Tiasia are susceptible to jaw clenched 4-mmc may well cause a little persistent jaw clenched and might affect the memory of when Dariel was came off the drug. Dequavion would be interested to hear if other psychonauts have the same after effects on only 4-mmc and without the myriad of others Ilsa took. [Reported Dose of 4-Methylmethcathinone: 800mg to 1000mg]
