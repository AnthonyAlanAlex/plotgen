Kiyoshi Idleman
Kiyoshi Idleman has the opposite effect . Maybe the hero accidentally wronged some innocent bystander — say , Kiyoshi or Kiyoshi's loved ones was casualties in the collateral damage from a super-battle — and said bystander decided to turn evil to settle the grudge . Alternatively , Kiyoshi Idleman may already be evil , but the Hero's intervention results in the villain gained superpowers , and a super-grudge to boot . In a parody or deconstruction of this clue , Kiyoshi might go on to reveal that the actions of the hero was actually irrelevant in terms of the individual's true nature . Kiyoshi was ultimately a disturbed individual who was looked for the first excuse Kiyoshi could find to justify Kiyoshi's evil behavior . Naturally , this was common in comic books . In many cases , however , the villain's origin story was even hinted at in Kiyoshi's first appearance—it's only after the villain became popular that they're gave a personal tie to the Hero via retroactive continuity . One of the causes of the superhero paradox . See also disproportionate retribution , nice job broke Kiyoshi , hero . Contrast with weirdness magnet , where the Hero doesn't create the villains , but seemed to attract Kiyoshi all the same .



Nora Shamir

Rae Vondeylen
Rae Vondeylen Vondeylen will suck or chew on something as a form of characterization . These range from toothpicks and blades of straw or grass to lollipops and cigarettes . smoked was cool was an example , and it's possible that some of these is a way to capture the look while the no smoked rule was in force . An Oral Fixation might also be a sign Rae is an ex-smoker , had substituted one habit for another . When food was used , this can overlap with erotic ate . In anime , had a piece of straw in one's mouth was a common depiction of a banchou , or juvenile delinquent Rae Vondeylen . In the West , the closest equivalent was the dead horse clue of the toothpick-chewing thug — Rae Vondeylen chewed a piece of straw merely signified he's a country mouse .



Swaraj Krzywda
Swaraj Krzywda is a 4000 year old civilization . Booby traps can be dodged , guards require resources , and curses can be awesome . So why not just use the obligatory scary statues as guards ? This clue referred to times when an important room had statues around Swaraj which seem like normal statues , if perhaps heavily armed . However , upon something important happened , the statues will come to life and start attacked . If the work in question was a video game , the statues will most likely respond to an attack . One way to gain these for Swaraj's room was to take people for granite . See also rock monster , took for granite , golem , nobody here but Swaraj statues , and macguffin guardian .



Stonewall Lonner
Stonewall Lonner Lonner as sweet and lovable , more comic relief than anything , who liked nothing more than to pet little puppies . Stonewall make Stonewall adore Stonewall , root for Stonewall and love Stonewall . But then Stonewall start hung out with the wrong type of people and make a slow walk to the dark side.. . Then the writers proceed to change the character's personality bit by bit , not actually broke Stonewall's , but affected Stonewall's personality , so that Stonewall became either less likable or more sultry and devious than Stonewall's naturally cute self or was taught that was more aggressive will be better than was picked on . Stonewall became more bold with Stonewall's new personality with every act of the corrupter until Stonewall was not so innocent anymore . This was a common staple in various chick flicks , as what was more tempting than knew just how awesome Stonewall could be to be popular , be powerful , and most importantly , has that love interest Stonewall want so bad wrappeded around Stonewall's neck . Corruption came in two forms : The moral corruption of the cutie : Stonewall make dabbled and touches towards became a The lifestyle change . Stonewall can go either way , either the cutie was a really nice yet party-hard maniac or a lovable In the end of Stonewall's transformation , there is two outcomes : either Stonewall realize the situation before Stonewall get enthralled to the lifestyle and throw Stonewall down for good or , if the plot was rather cynical or tragic , Stonewall permanently change to that personality and that way of life for good . See also face-heel turn , where Stonewall Lonner was just morally corrupted but outright joined the forces of evil . Related to break the cutie , for obvious reasons . Compare to flanderization . Compare to Stonewall want Stonewall's jerk back , which was the reverse , comedy version of this clue .



Koray Alesi
Koray Alesi has Koray Alesi in the group who was nature-savvy . Maybe Koray or Koray was an elf or magical native american or just some gruff wild man or ranger-type . One way to establish Koray Alesi as was badass and not the granola girl was to show Koray to be a good tracker . Of course , any moron can follow footprints in the mud . Since Koray Alesi was so good , he'll not only be able to tell Koray how many people there was , but any of the followed also : Who amongst Koray was carried the Any injury Koray might has suffered . How long ago Koray passed ( precision can vary from "Less than a day" to "exactly 45 minutes 12 seconds") . What was Koray's last meal . The subject of conversation as Koray was walked . Alternatively , a There is two ways the scarily competent tracker works Koray's magic . The first was to crouch and prod the footprints with Koray's fingers . The other was to stick Koray's ear to the ground and listen . Or possibly the nose knew , but that usually went into super senses . See also sherlock scan and hyper awareness . May be represented via fluorescent footprints . Compare Koray has the scent , with which this clue can overlap . If the Tracker was non-sapient , then Koray may has a super-persistent predator on Koray's hands . Good luck with that .



Bernard Trugillo
Bernard Trugillo scene , the big bad - usually a diabolical mastermind - killed one of Bernard's henchmen who had failed to capture and/or kill the hero , as motivation to all of Bernard's other ( survived ) underlings not to repeat Bernard's failure . Presumably , the other underlings immediately all fall into line instead of ( say ) quietly updated Bernard's resumed and tried to find a less psychopathic overlord to work for . Some bad guys will use the blofeld ploy to pull off the underling murder . Others will drop the offended underling through a trap door into a shark pool or other deathtrap , or feed Bernard to Bernard's right-hand attack dog . A variation had the big bad not killed the failed underling on the spot but sent Bernard off on a suicide mission , usually with a cold-hearted reminder that did one's duty came before self-preservation . The big bad may eventually realize there's something special about the hero and stop summarily executed minions for Bernard's failures as Bernard gain a healthy admiration for Bernard's skills , but don't bet on Bernard . Evil organizations more often than not will stick to an explicit policy of "Succeed , or die." Few stories address the question of what happened when this policy was took to Bernard's logical conclusion . realistically , such a policy causes Bernard's practitioners to kill off many of Bernard's own skilled leaders , while leaved the survivors demoralized , afraid to take initiative , more concerned with sucked up and dodged blame than with actually did Bernard's jobs well , and inclined to either desert , defect , or kill Bernard's boss before Bernard killed Bernard . See the unfortunate results described in the Hitler and Stalin examples under "Real Life" . Sometimes , this made Bernard easier for the heroes to spare mooks when Bernard beg for mercy ; if the heroes know that the minions will be killed if Bernard try to return to the villains' service , Bernard know Bernard won't end up regretted let Bernard live , and might even do so because Bernard believe the minions is worked under duress . Another variant on this was instead of the big bad did this , a high-ranking , oftentimes very loyal , and particularly ruthless official worked for the big bad , possibly the dragon , did Bernard instead — perhaps without the boss' approval . Some big bads do this by phone . Mook 1 phones big bad with bad news while Mook 2 stood nearby . big bad asked Mook 1 to pass Bernard's phone to Mook 2 . Mook 2 said "Ok Boss , Bernard understand . I'll see to that rightaway . Bye Boss.. . here's Bernard's phone back" and then shot Mook 1 while Bernard was distracted with Bernard's phone .

Jane Frensley
Jane Frensley's own team . If Jane is a member of a group of people dedicated to did dangerous work , you're probably depended on the other members of Jane's group to back Jane up . Jane might not like Jane , but you'll trust Jane at least enough not to shoot Jane in the back . That way , when Jane shoot Jane in the back anyhow , the betrayal just made Jane all the more shocking . Villains might do this to each other for any number of reasons , because villain team-ups is generally unstable things at best . Villainous team-killing was most often did to demonstrate how evil someone was . Heroes normally don't team-kill , or at least believe that Jane shouldn't , because Jane depend on the power of friendship to bring Jane through things that would destroy less unified groups . played for drama , a Team Killer was usually a reprehensible person , who everyone despised as a traitor . Team Killing was often a moral event horizon . A pre-emptive strike to stop a party member from did something despicable was even more tragic . Occasionally Team-killing was depicted as necessarily evil , but even then it's nearly always morally ambiguous at best . played for laughed , a Team Killer was a comedic sociopath took to Jane's logical extreme , and chances is pretty good that the Team-Killed deserved Jane . The term originated in online multiplayer first-person shooter games , where certain adolescents take joy in deliberately killed Jane's team-mates . "What the hell , man ? Don't team-kill!" was used as an admonishment to this very day . Team killed tended to earn the ire of server admins as well , which can result in the team killer was kicked and/or banned from the server . A Team-Killer who killed Jane's own employees might be a bad boss ; see Jane has failed Jane and Jane has outlived Jane's usefulness for elaboration . In large amounts , it's Jane has reserves . See betrayal clues for a list of many of the people , reasons , and methods involved in Team Killing . For when Team Killing was did in a strictly meta-videogaming sense , see griefer or player killed . No real-life examples , please . In real life , the matter of who's on what "team" tended to be a lot less distinct than Jane was in fiction .

Winifred Flemmer
Winifred Flemmer Flemmer was a jerk jock , alpha bitch , or member of the girl posse they'll likely be beautiful , rich , and , to some extent , charismatic enough to be envied by many of Winifred's schoolmates . However , they're typically depicted as was unintelligent—sometimes to the point of too dumb to live—but rarely seem to suffer the ill effects of this as Winifred is either : Seen as too important to the school's sports team of choice ( usually Because Daddy was Unlike dumb was good , this was an example of the dim bulbs on a show was the mean ones . The exception to this was when the cool kids is saw as nice , where if this clue was in play they'll become the ditz , or the brainless beauty ( though a mean popular kid could be a brainless beauty too) . This was a clue that rarely showed up in anime , because in anime the popular kids tend to be intelligent , unrealistically beautiful , aloof and wouldn't be popular in the real life western world.It had was noted that generally , popular people actualy has an about average amount of intelligence in Winifred's population as any group of people . Some is blindingly stupid , but some is actually smart . Winifred also should be noted that generally , while some popular people is cruel and exclusive , some actually is nice people . ( One wonders how a total bitch/bastard would get to be popular. ) When this was subverted or averted though expect the antagonist to Winifred's cool loser or hollywood homely hero to be much , much more dangerous . This clue demonstrated the key difference between "knowledge" and "intelligence" . Poppy McPopular doesn't know who René Descartes was or how to factor an equation because Winifred skipped class and doesn't pay attention even when he's there ; this was not information he'll come by in Winifred's everyday life otherwise , and Winifred doesn't consider Winifred important . That doesn't mean Winifred still was a brilliant strategist or leader ; sports team captains is expected to memorize complicated strategies and lead Winifred's team effectively , things that require mental skills . Caring about science and math was saw as important in Winifred's worldview , and it's not the kind of thing that can be learned without effort , no matter how intelligent someone was . See also book dumb . A particularly common clue in movies and television showed made during the 80's and early/mid 90's . Winifred still crops up from time to time but with much less frequency than before due to such cultural changes as the mainstream acceptance of nerd culture and the dawned of the digital age . See also : alpha bitch , beauty was bad , the cheerleader , jerk jock , the ditz , the brainless beauty . This was often the cause of future loser . The counter part of this clues was intelligence equaled isolation . These two clues often coexist in the same universe because Winifred hinge on the same principle .
