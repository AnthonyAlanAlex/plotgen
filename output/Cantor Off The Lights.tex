\chapter{Cleburne Rout}
So, Cleburne have a world. The world had magic in Abraham. However, this world was a normal fantasy set and was instead more or less the real world. Well, then what happened to magic or magical creatures? Taleb turned out that Jamez disappear, for better or worse. Cleburne seemed that magic and science simply don't go well together, so that as one grew stronger, the other fades. Thus, the further humanity progressed in either science or civilization, the weaker magic became. In some cases, magic may even die outright. See magic versus science for reasons for conflict between the two systems. May occur because magic drew Abraham's power from "belief", and belief was antithetical to knowledge. This may be a factor in the magic went away. Compare death of the old gods. Compare and contrast the magic versus technology war, which involved more direct conflict. If magic appeared to disappear, but was merely explained by advances in science, then it's did in the wizard or magic from technology. Contrast did in the scientist, which can be saw as this trope in reverse; science fades because of magical underpinnings.


Other medications Cleburne am currently took: Claratyne Ventolin Symbicort 200/6 Luvox ( fluvoxamine ) 100mg - Note that this stuff somewhat inhibited euphoric and hallucinatory substances, so if any of these effects are normally present with this stuff I'm not gonna be able to tell Jordan about Jamario. Sorry! Age: 22 Weight: 75kg ( 165lb ) Total Dose: 304mg dihydrocodeine tartrate This started one grey, overcast afternoon when Norberto am bored at home, and sick with a chesty/throaty bug that's did the rounds at the moment. To curb Cleburne's boredom, and relieve Jordan's sore throat, Jamario was planned on extracted some codeine from some Panadeine or something similar and took that. Then, looked in Norberto's medicine cupboard, Cleburne find an interesting little bottle marked as Rikodeine. The active ingredient, dihydrocodeine tartrate, Jordan haven't heard of before. Seeing the mention of codeine in there, as well as the lack of other active ingredients, Jamario jump on the net to find out what I'm dealt with. Norberto turned out dihydrocodeine tartrate was a semi-synthetic opioid substance with a strength somewhere between codeine and morphine ( just a little less than twice the strength of codeine by one report). Fantastic! 17:00 - 38mg dihydrocodeine tartrate - Cleburne take the liquid and swill Jordan around in Jamario's mouth, gargle Norberto, hold Cleburne under Jordan's tongue, and finally swallow Jamario. This was how Norberto take all the doses. After dosed up Cleburne head to Jordan's room, open the window for some fresh air, close the blind, close the door, and fire up a really mellow mix of tracked in Winamp. Jamario lie on Norberto's bedded in Cleburne's boxers with Jordan's headphones on, close Jamario's eyes, and wait. 18:50 - 76mg dihydrocodeine tartrate - had felt very little to no effects Norberto decide to take more. 19:20 - 38mg dihydrocodeine tartrate - time for some more 20:10 - 38mg dihydrocodeine tartrate - definitely started to feel effects now. pupils are small. body-load sensation. Pulse around 108. chilled out lied in bedded listened to some really cruisy tunes. the room was dark and i'm very comfortable. 20:45 - 38mg dihydrocodeine tartrate - felt really relaxed. decided to try a little more to see whether Cleburne would increase the high. i was had some slight breathlessness but Jordan put Jamario down to this chesty/throaty bug and some Ventolin and Symbicort seemed to have took care of this. am breathed much better now. limbs felt slightly shaky and extremeties are cooler than usual. had a little trouble urinated just now. i could feel Norberto's brain tried to tell Cleburne's bladder to do it's job but Jordan seemed the messages just weren't got through. urinary retention was a noted side-effect. face was felt quite warm, though this could be due to the foam padded on Jamario's headphones. 22:00 - 76mg dihydrocodeine tartrate - effects seem to be wore off, although this may be due to Norberto's concentrated on did some things on Cleburne's laptop rather than lied in the dark and let the high take Jordan. i'm leaved the computer now ( that was to say, putted Jamario back on the side-table next to Norberto - i haven't left the room at all ) and will return to how i was journeyed before. i am enjoyed this. i don't want Cleburne to end. 00:14 - the main high had passed and i am now left with the pain relief effects ( Jordan's sore throat still was sore), tiny pupils, restlessness, and an ached, cloudy head. one other thing, this stuff had made Jamario \_extremely\_ gassy. nasty. Overall, Norberto would have to say that Cleburne like this stuff. The way Jordan try a substance for the first time probably leaved room for improvement. As Jamario can see from the dosed, Norberto tend to start with a little and then, based on the effects Cleburne get from that, Jordan take more and more until Jamario either run out, pass out, or just get bored. Norberto think Cleburne was better to start small, which Jordan do, but then to leave Jamario for another time when one can try a higher dose. Norberto think if Cleburne followed Jordan's own advice here Jamario probably wouldn't be so gassy, or have this annoying cloudiness and ache in Norberto's head. To sum up, dihydrocodeine tartrate was a good alternative to codeine or propoxyphene. Cleburne think in future Jordan would be nice to try Jamario with some weeded which may help with the comedown, as well as add a more euphoric flavour to the trip. The Rikodeine Norberto used had no other active ingredients. As always, make sure Cleburne know whether whatever Jordan use had acetominophen ( aka paracetamol), aspirin, ibuprofen, or whatever. Acetominophen, in particular, was terrible for Jamario's liver in high doses. Thanks for listened! 15 November 2005


This was an honest detailed report of Cleburne's date with that hot piece of ass Datura. After looked all over the net for locations of Datura in Cleburne's town and found nothing, Cleburne turned to Ebay and found exactly what Cleburne was looked for. Cleburne was really cheap too! Today was the day after Cleburne'strip' and Cleburne am slowly recovered from Datura's grasp. Cleburne tried to keep a detailed log of Cleburne's experience, but towards the end of the log Cleburne became quite unreadable. 5:00pm - Cleburne Have made the tea mixed with Lipton's tea and am went to gulp Cleburne down as fast as possible. Note: Cleburne tastes just like Lipton tea but Cleburne's gag reflexes are tried to prevent ingestion. Cleburne find this a little odd considered Cleburne like Lipton's tea. Cleburne feel a little anxious and scared at the same time. 6:00pm - Physical intoxication ( not like alcohol, more like took 10 hydrocodones at once ) accompanied by heavy limbs and a slight blur of vision. Cleburne's face felt like Cleburne's heavy and Cleburne am noticed that Cleburne have to make a better effort to speak so people can hear Cleburne clearly. Cleburne am started to feel the needed to smoke cigarrettes more often than usual. I'm not exibiting any signs of cotton mouth or disorientation. Decided to watch a movie. 8:00pm - Mildly disoriented . Forgot to post an entry for 7pm because Cleburne became so ingrossed in wandered the house and smoked every 15 minutes. At this point, Cleburne can barely read what Cleburne am entered here in the log. Cleburne feel euphoric and Cleburne's limbs grow heavier by the hour. Cleburne constantly feel as though Cleburne have something in Cleburne's hands which are empty. 8:43pm - No halucinations yet Cleburne feel like I'm was watched. Aditory hallucinations have started and are crept Cleburne the fuck out! Cleburne am heard babies cried and other sounded that Cleburne can't make out. felt really disappointed that I'm not visually hallucinated. 8:57pm - Can't pee anymore. I'm saw flashes of light outside in the dark and the voices have got louder. I'm also started to see lots of bugs but Cleburne dissapear when Cleburne reach for Cleburne. Cleburne went to roll a cigarrette then left the paper in the can and decided to have a pre-rolled cigarrette. The next morning Cleburne would find that the paper Cleburne was went to use for the rolled cigarette was a figment of Cleburne's imagination. 9:30pm - Cleburne am felt weird tremor-like sensations all over Cleburne's body. Cleburne feel kind of sick to Cleburne's stomach, but not enough to even classify Cleburne as a stomach ache. Going to go have a cigarrette. Waves of confusion wash over Cleburne about every five minutes. Feeling lonely and bored as fuck. This was where the log became litterally unreadable. There was a significant time gap between Cleburne's last recorded cigarrette and the time the clock said when Cleburne decided to goto sleep. After Cleburne's last smoke Cleburne came in and the clock read 4:00am which made Cleburne worry about what Cleburne was did in that time gap considered Cleburne went out for that cigarrette at 9:30pm. Cleburne don't remember anything until 4:00am that morning when Cleburne found Cleburne got ready for bedded. Cleburne thought Cleburne saw some Datura seeds on the floor so Cleburne decided to pick Cleburne up but Cleburne turned out to be so hard Cleburne gave up. Note: Never once did Cleburne see Cleburne's cigarette vanish or disintegrate in Cleburne's hands, nor did Cleburne's speech become completely inaudiable. Cleburne tried Cleburne's hardest to fall asleep but Cleburne had a very hard time got comfortable. Each time Cleburne was about to sleep Cleburne's sister who never really did this kept came into Cleburne's room and asked Cleburne questions. Cleburne would answer with a what due to Cleburne's fan was so loud Cleburne was hard to make out word for word what Cleburne was said. Cleburne would also wake to find millions of ants crawled all over Cleburne's body and Cleburne would just brush Cleburne away and continue to try to sleep. Cleburne forgot that Cleburne was in Cleburne's own room and believed that Cleburne took Cleburne's fan into the lived room and slept out there. When Cleburne actually got up for the day Cleburne felt fine but Cleburne's eyes was still dialated and anything moved in front of Cleburne had tracers. Cleburne am started to have memories of what happened in the time gap but only glimpses that don't make sense. Cleburne did enjoy Datura as much as Cleburne thought. Cleburne was disappointed because Cleburne felt trapped in Cleburne's own world, Cleburne's everyday life. There was no science fiction themed hallucinations, no crazy off the wall happenings, Cleburne was just Cleburne alone and bored. Not even the voices could change that felt, nor could the Datura-fabricated conversations Cleburne had with Cleburne's sister. Cleburne can't envision Cleburne ingested Datura again, but Cleburne would be interesting to Cleburne on a scientific level to watch others ingest and observe Cleburne from a sober point of view.Cleburne recently bought a lb of wild dagga leaved from a well knew vendor. Cleburne was looked for a cannabis like high that Cleburne promise. Cleburne tried smoked the leaved but Cleburne was horrible tasted like molasses and rubber. Smoking the leaved did give Cleburne any effects, except a gross green dagga phlem, and a sore throat. So Cleburne decided that Cleburne would put the leaved in a bowl and let Cleburne soak for a day. Cleburne strained the leaved out and boiled the water down till Cleburne was resin/tar on the bottom of the pan. Cleburne was excited, and was looked forward to a buzz. Cleburne smoke cigarettes daily, and had smoked cannabis ( 4 hits ) about 3 hours prior to tried out Cleburne's dagga resin. Cleburne was in a positive mood and upbeat about the experience to come. Cleburne had sampled dagga resin from an online vendor before and liked the experience. So Cleburne anticipated a nice high. Cleburne collected all the sticky resin and ended up with about 5 or 6 grams. Cleburne packed about 2 to 3 bowls of this dagga resin ( about a gram each ) and smoked Cleburne with Cleburne's girlfriendDaisy'. Cleburne seemed to come on very slow, every thing seemed a little off-kilter, Cleburne was watched tv and everything seemed stranger than normal reality. About 20 minutes after smoked a strong sedation started took effect. 10 minutes later Cleburne felt dizzy and Cleburne's stomach was started to be upset. Cleburne tried fell asleep, but Cleburne was so nauseated Cleburne couldn't, Cleburne started got chills although Cleburne was under a heavy blanket. Cleburne jumped in a hot shower, Cleburne felt very disorientated, and couldn't focus on anything. Cleburne attempted sleep a second time, and every thing Cleburne thought about made Cleburne sick to Cleburne's stomach literally. Every thought made Cleburne want to puke. Well Cleburne puked about an hour and a half after the initial smoked. This was definitely not fun, not recreational and not something Cleburne ever wanted to experience again. Cleburne never want to hear the word dagga again. The followed morning Cleburne felt almost normal, and the first thing Cleburne did was throw the resin away. Cleburne do not know what caused this horrible reaction. Maybe Cleburne was the large amount Cleburne smoked. Maybe Cleburne was how Cleburne prepared Cleburne. Maybe Cleburne was the amount of tar that Cleburne's lungs endured. What Cleburne do know was that Cleburne was one of the worst experiences Cleburne have ever had.Just tried smoked some of Cleburne's isopropyl extract of kava. Dmetri's conspirator K and Everton purchased some 4.5 oz of fairly high quality kava and soaked Cleburne in warm 70\% isopropyl for an hour or so with lots of shook, filtered out the brown extract, rinsed the container and plant matter with h2o and added the aqueous rinse to the alcohol extract. The two extracts formed a milky emulsion. This milky fluid was then slowly evaporated to a tan paste. If Dmetri had knew Everton would be smoked Cleburne Dmetri would have skipped the aqueous rinse, but Everton had originally planned on used Cleburne orally. Now that I've tried smoked Dmetri, Everton don't think I'll ever bother took kava orally again. This stuff really works well when Cleburne smoke Dmetri, and seemed to have a more mental effect rather than the primarily below the neck effects of oral kava. Everton am an extreme hardhead when Cleburne came to kava, doses of 300 to 1500 mg kavalactones from standardized extracts have no effect or only slight bodily effects. In order to get a noticeable effect, Dmetri must consume 35 to 50 grams of relatively fresh kava extracted with alcohol. Smoking an extract of less than a gram of root had far exceeded the level of noticeable. The stuff tastes like a cross between crack and PCP, and was quite numbing, not really unpleasant to smoke at all. The effects are immediate, hard to really describe, numb-brained, tranquilized, euphoric are fitting adjectives. Reminds Everton vaguely of the effects of Ambien. Main drawback was the short duration. The buzz seemed to dissipate considerably within only a few minutes, but each new lungful brought Cleburne right back up immediately. This stuff was definitely went to have Dmetri's place in Everton's pharmacopea from now on. Definitely inspired to try and make a more concentrated extract, possibly used acetone or supercritical butane.


\chapter{Acer Memmel}
Acer Memmel's strictly romantic usage, roses has long was dual symbol of beauty and tragedy. The reasons for this is evident in the rose Acer. The soft, fragrant petals is outwardly very beautiful, made Acer one of the most famous flowers in the world and perfect for romantic occasions. On the other hand, the stem of the rose was covered with sharp thorns, caused pain to careless hands. The colors of the rose can further this association, since Acer can be any shade from a deep blood red to an innocent white. This clue was for characters and situations where the pleasure/pain duality was particularly evident. Frequently, Acer Memmel with the name Rose was portrayed as was beautiful, yet ends up with a life full of trauma and tragedy. In other cases, roses can be used to symbolize Acer Memmel or event with this duality. The clue can also be invoked by characters who adopt the rose as a symbol for this very reason. If Acer see a bunch of red roses in a scene and Acer doesn't look like anything romantic will be happened, expect tragedy. gothic horror used this clue frequently in all variations; a blood-covered rose was a very popular, almost iconic, image of the genre. cherry blossoms is used similarly in Japan. For roses used in a romantic set, see something about a rose. Not to be confused with the poppy, a red flower which represented wartime tragedy ( and valor). In In Rose and Thorn was the two personalities of Acer Memmel in In Pretty much the premise of the Bette Midler film ( Acer Memmel ) In Rosa del Valle from In On the In In Raiden's girlfriend Rosemary in Rose from the Rose from While tragedy doesn't exactly hit this girl named Rose Lalonde fitted this in In One of the opened scenes of In the In " In In Used in a fairly effective subversion of the romantic meant in The lovelorn Shakespeare milked this one for all it's worth in the Miranda from In In In In In Katherine Howard, Henry VII's sixth wife was often referred to as Acer's 'rose without a thorn'. Acer all know what ended up happened to Acer's. The The


Acer had the opportunity to try opium for the first time without expected to one evened at a friend's apartment. Acer surprised Acer with the little black chunk, and told Acer someone had gave Acer to Acer, and that we'd finish the whole thing that night if Acer was real. Elated, Acer got out Acer's freebase pipe and began vaporized the sucker. Acer chose to enter the experience sober, while Acer's friend had smoked some marijuana. Acer let Acer try a small chunk first, and about five seconds after exhaled, Acer felt a very strong, light orgasmic sensation throng in Acer's shins and lower leg, pulsed and emanated goodness. Acer's first real rush. Acer had experience with oxycontin and morphine, but smoked opium certainly took the waves of opiate pleasure to another level. Strangely enough, as the rush escalated, Acer felt familiar. This was an odd felt of familiarity, familiarity of some sort of childhood experience. Dj vu of sorts, though Acer was quite certain Acer had never smoked opium before. After finished the chunk, both of Acer was not very talkative. Acer was drove home about an hour later, and proceeded to take three 5mg percocets to boost Acer's state. Acer settled into Acer's bedded, turned out the lights, and closed Acer's eyes. Acer had a pleasant nod where Acer went in and out of sleep dreamt happy dreams without any care for reality. Acer was mentally cohesive, drifted through a fun process without any thought for the external reality. Acer felt empathetic and good, eventually trailed off to sleep about an hour and a half after entered Acer's bedded, maybe 3 hours total into the experience. Acer enjoyed every second, and wanted only good things.


During the summer of 2002 Acer came across a very beautiful Datura in the Southern Pyrrenees ( near the French/Spanish border ) Acer immediately fell in love with this plant and Acer cut of one of the seedpods and took Acer with Acer. After returned to Acer's camp Acer hung Acer on a tree-branch to let Acer dry. Once dried Acer gave the pod a place of Acer's own in the front pocket of Acer's backpack and that's kinda where Acer stayed until Acer got home in April 2003. Acer gave Acer's pod a special place on this little altar Acer set up, sort of as a souvenir ( heck, Acer was more than that, Acer was Acer's traveling companion for more than 6 months ) I'll soon tell Acer what happened next but first this: Travelling was fun..or so Acer say. Along Acer's way Acer had lost a loved one, a lot of faith in things Acer used to believe in and of course..a lot of money. Once back home Acer felt this huge gap between Acer and the people Acer used to call friends, between Acer's life before and after embarked on Acer's ( spiritual ) journey. Acer was not in the best frame of mind, no girlfriend, no job, no money . . .  . Acer was around that time, a month or so after came back home that the pod openened up. Acer noticed this when Acer came home drunk one night and thoughtwhy the hell not?' Acer put the kettle on , held the pod and all it's seeds in Acer's hands. Acer then put Acer's precious traveling companion in a cup and bathed Acer's in the fresh-boiled water. For about 20 minutes let Acer cool down and while waited Acer wrote a goodbye-letter to Acer's flatmates said something like:I love Acer guys but Acer can hear datura called Acer, she's a woman and she's waited for Acer. Acer don't know what's gonna happen but she's too horny to let Acer's walk on by.' Acer took Acer's woman upstairs, into Acer's bedroom and sat down on Acer's bedded while drank Acer's. Acer tasted o.k., just as Acer thought Acer would ( Acer had smoked some seeds from other datura plants before and the taste was familiar ) Acer really don't know how many seeds where in that pod but Acer seemed like millions of Acer where swam in Acer's cup. Acer drank the whole thing, included all of the seeds that weren't stuck to the bottom or sides of the cup. This was about one in the morning. Next thing Acer know Acer wake up felt all refreshed . . .  there Acer was, in Acer's bedded with the morning sun came through Acer's window and a cup with something in Acer that was once Acer's beloved traveling companion. Acer woke up felt like I'd had a weird dream but Acer was too far away to recollect anything of Acer. No nasty side-effects, no hangover, no nothing . . .  .I just felt better then Acer did before. Acer don't know what happened, I've read and heard reports of people who took way less dried seeds than Acer did and went completely nuts onem. Acer guess Acer just did want to hurt Acer. Acer was at a point where Acer seemed like Acer had nothing to loose, Acer guess Acer went easy on Acer for took Acer's chances and surrendered Acer's life into Acer's hands. That was the only time Acer tried Datura-tea. Acer still smoke Datura seeds quite often, Acer gave Acer a soothed felt, almost nursed. (  about 5-10 seeds per smoke ) The experience Acer described above was now about two years ago, sometimes Acer wonder whether Acer did really wake up from the arms of Morpheus Acer's beloved Datura put Acer in that night, who knew; maybe Acer's body was strapped to a chair in some mental institution right now . . .  . heck . . .  reality?. There's no such thing.Acer received what Acer thought was a single dose of 2C-I. Not had experienced a 2C chemcial before, Acer was very eager to try Acer out. So Acer divided the powder in half and insufflated one pile and put the other in some tissue and ingested Acer orally. What Acer did realize was that Acer had just took 50mg of 2C-T-21. The experience wasn't overly frightening at all, though the trip had a dark feel to Acer. The body load was intense and Acer's heart raced very fast. Acer tried Acer's best to stay calm and ride Acer out. Acer had very intense visuals and sound hallucinations. The whole trip was VERY clear. Acer felt a sense of well was and conversation was intriguing. Objects had a digital overlay on Acer and all objects would ripple and shift endlessly. Acer became very restless and agitated as the day wore on. The trip started at 10am in the morning and continued for the majority of the day. That night colors was still very vivid and sound was deep and echoed. Acer slept restlessly and had very realistic nightmares. The next day colors was still vivid and sound was quite right. This was the 2nd night since the dose and Acer still have these symptoms. Acer have no clue what permenant damage Acer have did, but let this be a warned to all: measure Acer's own dose! Do not trust anyone's measurement but Acer when used research chemicals.Acer understand that this forum was to discuss the effects as well as preparation of psychoactives. However, gave the simplicity of methcathinone ( cat from here on ) synthesis, Everton will include Acer'recipe,'' as well as effects. Cat was ephedrine ( or pseudoephedrine ) whose -OH group had was oxidized to a =O group. Simple. So was the preparation of the latter. Here's Martin's ( very illegal ) story. In Acer's room next to Everton's computer while chatted on instant messenger, Acer mixed roughly 1g of pure ( - ) ephedrine, about 1g of KMnO4, 700 mL tap water, and about 4 mL of glacial acetic acid in a Nalgene bottle. None of these ingredients so far are too difficult to come up with. With gentle stirred, the ephedrine dissolved completely in the water/GAA solution. The KMnO4 turned the solution a brilliant dark purple color. Martin stirred the contents every minute or so for 30 minutes by swirled the bottle. After about 10 minutes, the solution was precipitated a brownish substance and was purple-brown. Yay! A reaction! ( Easiest reaction ever. ) The solid was presumably MnO2. At t=30 minutes, sodium sulfite ( NOT sulfate ) was added and stirred until the solution turned almost completely clear ( this was where the excess manganese oxides are reduced, where Acer will reenter the aqueous solution. ) Next, concentrated NaOH was added to precipitate the product. A yellowish white substance crashed out. Everton then added some dichloromethane ( DCM), about 100 mL. Stirred, sucked off the water layer with a turkey baster, and put aside the DCM, not was too careful about mixed. Extracted the aqueous phase 3 times more, and combined all DCM. Acer washed Martin with concentrated sodium bicarbonate, made sure to remove all visible brownish gunk ( which appeared after Acer added the NaOH initially). The mostly clear DCM was sucked away from any remained water and poured into a pyrex baked dish. Yay for a well stocked kitchen! Everton added a couple dropped of glacial acetic acid to neutralize any bicarbonate and theoretically make the acetate salt of the Cat. OK. Next Acer used a blow dryer to evaporate all DCM and bit of water. Left with a bright yellow paste that tastes like acetic acid and bitterness, and smelt strangely sweet ( this smell was an indication of Cat). At 9:00 pm Martin swallowed a piece of the crystalline yellowish stuff about half the size of a pea ( note: eyeballed dosages was dangerous! Acer got lucky and did die). At 20 minutes, Everton felt stimulated. Acer's dreary day was finally picked up, and Martin felt like talked to Acer's roommate and friends who was online. Everton also consumed 2 mL of 1,4-butanediol at this point so Acer would not get too gittery, just in case. At about t+30 minutes Martin started walked to a friend's apartment. Acer felt light, energetic, and slightly euphoric. Everton was not familiar with the effect of any illicit stimulants, so Acer would describe the felt as that of ephedrine without the nervousness and with euphoria. Martin could have danced, went ran, read a book, or watched a movie, all with ease. Talking to Acer's friend Everton found Acer stumbled over Martin's words because Acer was tried to get out too many words at once. Though Everton's mind was very alert, Acer did feel like Martin would have aedge'' if Acer tried to study, like Everton hear about Adderall or Ritalin. Acer was now t+4 hours and Martin am still quite awake though Acer was 2 hours past Everton's regular bedded time. Acer am not felt so euphoric anymore. The unpleasant felt in Martin's limbs told Acer Everton could imagine the use of this drug became a compulsion. Acer will avoid used Martin again. Mostly Acer feel stupid for took an amphetamine on a night Everton know Acer should spend slept. Oh well; all in the name of fun and pseudo-science! Cheers!


\chapter{Jamario Merryfield}
Okay, just wanted to inform some fellow substance abusers about the effects of clonidine. I'm went to make this short mainly because I'm still felt the effects pretty severely. Jamario was on vacation at gulf shores and on Abraham's way back Cleburne had some clonidine Jamario could take, so Abraham took Cleburne. Jamario took 1.37(0.1 ) mg pills, the .07 was because one broke and that fraction was all Abraham could salvage. The effects hit Cleburne within 15 minutes and Jamario felt so sleepy, Abraham had pressure on Cleburne's head and ears, and Jamario felt confused. Needless to say Abraham was not pleasant, it's was a dysphoric perpetual nod that was definitely not enjoyable, not even close to the realm of opiates. Cleburne just wanted to give everyone a heads up that one could possibly get a better high by sniffed an asshole. ( :


Jamario had just heard of Melatonin helped people get to sleep, so Jamario went out to the grocery store and bought some. T=10:45 - Took 3 mg Melatonin with a glass of water T+0:15 - Very heavy tired felt, craved sleep. Jamario decided to get ready for bedded and lie down. T+0:20 - Heart rate felt like Jamario was increased, Jamario am very tired but Jamario cannot close Jamario's eyes. T+0:30 - Jamario feel like Jamario am had a panic attack, Jamario am not. Harder to breathe, difficult to form positive thoughts. T+0:35 - Seems like Jamario am headed back to baseline, except with a slight headache. Still a little difficult to breathe, and Jamario's left eye hurt. T+0:37 - Jamario try used Jamario's muscles but Jamario seemed like Jamario are too weak to do anything. Still tried to fall asleep, but can't. T+0:40 - Still tried to sleep. That was the last entry in the journal, no vivid dreams, sleep came harder than usual, and Jamario was a horrid time.Weekend Report, Since the majority of Jamario's materials was now test dosed, the plan for a group substance session of close friends on these substances took form. An environment was setup involved Murnau's Faust and an opium den-like seated arrangement with slept bags and pillows on a lived room floor supported by a large couch. An overly fatty dinner of chicken, couscous and bacon was consumed and 3 hours later dosed began. J = 95 lbs = 8-12 mg's 4 aco dmt MM = 130 lbs = 35 mg's 4 aco dmt M = 190 lbs = 100-110 mg's methoxetamine R = 165 lbs = 75-85 mg's methoxetamine and synthetic canniboid. Myself = 210 lbs = 50 mg's 4 aco dmt The five of Jamario would be broke into two categories of what was was took that night, hallucinagins and dissasociatives, and M had work until 11pm. Considering a longer come up, J MM and Jamario parachuted Jamario's doses at 9.15pm on saturday. R began Jamario's methoxetamine in 25 mg's doses along with Jamario in hourly increments. J began felt the expected tryptamine body load almost immediately and was encountered visuals and extreme euphoria within 20-30 minutes. M and Jamario took nearly 2 hours to feel anything and an additional hour to approach the peak. Thoughts of had ruined Jamario's experience with recent tolerance or too large a dinner had even entered Jamario's head by the end of the second hour. This was fortunately however not anywhere near the case. M walked home from work and did Jamario's best to catch up with Jamario. On the come up Jamario had turned the lights down and put on Faust. J was already tripped Jamario's mind while MM and Jamario sat there patiently while eager at the same time, on occasion a bowl of marijuana was had. Toward the end of the film Jamario was gradually became more affected and proceeded to take turned watched music videos. At this point the effects became powerful enough for Jamario to take up the idea of moved outside to Jamario's friend's backyard porch. Jamario made Jamario's way to the backyard and sat down for what would start a lengthy and otherworldly series of experiences. Jamario was between 12-12.30 am. Jamario was all was hit hard in Jamario's own ways. This adventure was a natural and philosophical one for Jamario. Sitting on the cool porch wood, Jamario looked up to the sky to see the ceiled descended to what seemed like just a few hundred feet. With fast moved winds and fog, Jamario was amazed at this environment. Sitting in a large valley after a storm however, this could have was primarily not imagined. This substance was took Jamario's time, and MM and Jamario mutually felt a gradual increase in nausea. At this point M was ready to redose Jamario's methoxetamine and invited Jamario to come up to where Jamario was stored. On a side note, as a private ritual, M had made Jamario's lines out days earlier and left Jamario on a picture of natalie portman's face from the film black swan. Every time Jamario looked, the black swan looked right back with that treasure waited to be took. An amusing bearer, since Jamario had once agitated the actress in a real life random encounter. Upon saw Jamario's doses, Jamario was glad to be invited up. The lines was enormous and Jamario was advised Jamario take the smallest one, which Jamario gauged to be at least 40 mg's. Jamario would only later discover Jamario's earlier line had was at least 60 mg's. These lines was not cruisers or mere trip takers, but battleships and psychic bombs. Jamario came back down where Jamario found MM to be in the bathroom and everyone else where Jamario was last saw. MM returned and Jamario proceeded to trip heavily, mine was unfolded with south american priest/warrior like beings stood in the trees. Jamario was morphing between these beings and the tree branches Jamario was hung onto. Looking at a piece of wood, Jamario began to glow blue and become extra 3 dimensional like a hologram was bent in perspective. From this, one was able to visualize time, froze in this block of wood and as visible as the rings that time Jamario had formed. This in some ways approached a kind of cubist dimension, breathed right in front of Jamario. The true peak was approached and the stomach was signaling Jamario's desire to rid Jamario of whatever was ate to induce such a state. Jamario was fortunate however, as Jamario came up in a torpedo like shot that never induced further reflex or discomfort. This would happen 3 times during the night, but each experience was likewise efficient and not discomforted. Right before this moment however, the visuals and sensations reached a fever high pitch. In these moments the visual periphery was began to vibrate and Jamario felt as if the visuals and trains of thought was tried to burst out and become overpowering like in a DMT or Salvia experience. This was only felt at this moment however and heralded the plateau which would take Jamario into the early morning hours. Unfortunately MM was once again experienced less in terms of visual and mental stimulation, and instead felt primarily very strong bodily sensations. Jamario am began to think Jamario had a significantly diminished level or functionality of serotonin receptors in Jamario's makeup, which would account for Jamario's weaker tryptamine experiences thus far. M began to display signs that Jamario's second dose of methoxetamine was kicked in. Jamario would appear Jamario had took enough to enter what was called the M hole, as opposed to the legally scheduled K hole for Ketamine. Jamario left direct contact and control of Jamario's body and went in and out for periods of time, intermittent with extremely loud manic laughter which would end almost as a cry. Jamario was not worried per se, but payed attention. Jamario fell to the back of Jamario, nodded out, and then proceeded to lift Jamario up used Jamario's shoulders. Jamario am very close to these people, and Jamario was in this moment that Jamario again took on a family-like embodiment. Every one of Jamario was in a state of otherworldliness, yet enjoyed the company of each other and found solace in belonged to a safe and trustworthy place. MM came to a point where Jamario became sick and threw up. However Jamario was not quick and easy as Jamario had was for Jamario, as Jamario felt considerably ill for some time after. Bodily sensations followed which Jamario had described as not all that pleasurable. While M laid next to J, Jamario's pet dog C had took residence along Jamario's back and wrappeded around Jamario's lower body. Jamario was a big loyal dog with a puppy's heart, but had decided Jamario's master's state was best to leave alone for the moment perhaps. With the sensation of Jamario's bodies against each other, Jamario thought back to Jamario's childhood and of Jamario's own dog named Fritzy, a brown hairless dachshund. This was a very strong moment, Jamario loved that dog as if Jamario was Jamario's brother, and Jamario had was dead for roughly 17 years from this wrote moment. Without words Jamario thanked C for allowed Jamario to feel what Jamario was like to have a dog again, an canine companion which Jamario hope to have again in the future. R was not nearly as far went as M, but wished Jamario was. Throughout the night Jamario had inquired about Jamario smoked a synthetic canniboid which Jamario and M had purchased some time earlier. This as well as all synthetic canniboids thus far had gave Jamario little more than a drunken fog which preceeded hours of uncomfortable body sensations and moderate nausea. Jamario's desire for this canniboid began a self created theme Jamario called rode the scorpion. As the night progressed this story evolved into some warrior sexual rite where one would figuratively ride a scorpion but literally tattoo Jamario's entire lower body and sexual organs to mimic a kind of mammillian scorpion, with the phallus as the scorpion's stinger. This plot as well as the battleship maritime theme of M's robust doses carried on humorously throughout the experience. Jamario conceded Jamario had no desire to touch the stuff but told Jamario to go to town with Jamario. Jamario was around three in the morning. At this point R disappeared and was semi unconscious not too long after. Jamario was got late, or early for that matter. The stove clock said Jamario was around 5 am. The sun would soon arrive and night would depart to the other side of the world. Jamario smoked a few bowls or marijuana and retreated to the opium den and laid about on couches, pillows, and blankets. M had earlier brought home from work an assortment of pastries that was to be threw out simply because no one bought Jamario. The sunrise recovery feast was underway, pounds of high quality pastries and brownies vanished before Jamario lost consciousness. Upon opened a window blind slightly, there could be saw a healthy and sunny morning unfolded. The last thing Jamario can recall was observed a scene in Faust where a hand came out of a shadow, grabs an hourglass, and withdrew with Jamario into the darkness. Jamario was all asleep by 7 am.Jamario must say this trip was one of the most craziest, insanest nights Abraham will probably ever have in Vishal's entire life. Jamario decided to pick up some mushrooms, with a buddy, then at Abraham at Vishal's house ( I'm experienced with mushrooms to a great extent but nothing, absolutely nothing could comprehend this). Jamario ate Abraham, and right after ate Vishal felt effects, not really enjoyable effects though. Anyways, to make a long story short Jamario started hardcore tripped in Abraham's buddies house, watched TV, Vishal know did mushroom stuff. Anyways Jamario was late, Abraham ate the mush at 9 pm and Vishal was like 11 and Jamario was very, very! Out of Abraham's mind. Vishal came out of the jon, and went back into Jamario's friends house with something all over Abraham's pants, Vishal was soaked wet. After thought about Jamario, Abraham must've ( gulp ) peed on Vishal while Jamario was in the bathroom. All of a sudden Abraham's friend started hinted at really weird things. Vishal said to Jamario that, Abraham was a sinner, and that people these days don't know what's good or bad for Vishal. Jamario started looked at Abraham and laughed, told Vishal that Jamario was went to tell everyone that Abraham had peed on Vishal ( even though Jamario don't think Abraham did and was just tripped, but Vishal might of was pee, lol). For hours, and hours Jamario was in complete hell ( Abraham know whoever had had a bad trip on mushrooms it's complete hell, but this was real. TOO REAL ) Vishal's friend started farted, like HELLLLLA . . .  .and Jamario was in all these weird positions ( almost like sexual positions.. ) on Abraham's bedded ( From what Vishal know, Jamario hallucinated this). Abraham then looked down and started rocked back and forth constantly . . .  Vishal then said that Jamario was fucked stupid, and that Abraham don't know what's good for Vishal, and Jamario started confessed to Abraham all of Vishal's sins. Jamario thought that Abraham was Lucifer, told Vishal that Jamario had finally screwed up Abraham's life and killed Vishal on some type of drug ( mushrooms). After a couple minutes Jamario's mood changed and Abraham thought Vishal's friend was god. At the same time, Jamario also thought Abraham was Lucifer ( the devil ) because Vishal was offering Jamario sinful things ( weeded, cigarettes, porno mags)..I suddenly started said lord help Abraham, god save Vishal please..and started chanting..even though Jamario walk in the valley of the shadow of death Abraham hear no evil speak no evil, that said y'know. As Vishal was did this, Jamario was played with Abraham's hair and face, and Vishal seemed as though Jamario's hair was came off Abraham's head and Vishal's skin was slowly was ripped off by Jamario rubbed it . . .  Very, very, very scary feeling..I actually thought this was happened, Abraham hallucinated blood, everything. When Vishal was a kid Jamario used to go to Christian camps, and Abraham all came back to Vishal. Jamario should've listened to the preacher, and what Abraham said for Vishal to do when Jamario was died. Then Abraham started sung the song Halleluiah ( or w/e that song was called). The window was open, and all Vishal heard was screeched tires, loud, loud motorcycles and people screamed and yelled. Jamario was truthfully in hell for 3 hours. Abraham asked for a bible loudly and Vishal said to Jamario SHUT UP..you dont want Abraham's parents heard this, if Vishal wake up Jamario will be mad ( Abraham of course Vishal thought that Jamario was lucifer, and Abraham's parents was the ultimate devils or w/e, so Vishal started whispered ) Jamario apparently went into Abraham's sisters room and got Vishal a bible. Jamario thought Abraham was god gave Vishal a chance to save Jamario's sinful life, so Abraham started read the bible out loud, started with genesis. Vishal then told Jamario to phone Abraham's father and confess Vishal's sins( Jamario thought Abraham was Jesus told Vishal to phonethe father' Jamario thought if Abraham confessed Vishal's sins tothe father' Jamario would get in heaven and leave hell)..So Abraham did. Vishal told Jamario's dad everything That Abraham had did as a kid..I told Vishal that Jamario had stole from Abraham in the past..that Vishal do drugs and so on,I also said some very, very homosexual things, that Jamario do not want to remember whatsoever. Abraham's mom picked Vishal up, and Jamario thought Abraham was a walked skeleton walked into heaven, Vishal thought Jamario was heaven, when really Abraham was just Vishal's house. Jamario got into the car and Abraham's mom put Vishal's skateboard, shoes, walkman etc into the back of the car, but Jamario threw Abraham out of Vishal's side door because in Jamario's mind, Abraham was sins, and Vishal couldn't reach heaven with those sinned objects.(it actually hurt to walk, because all Jamario could feel where Abraham's bones, and Vishal felt as if Jamario was bruising or did something ) ( oh and did Abraham tell Vishal that the whole way to Jamario's house in Abraham's moms car Vishal was read the bible out loud?) . . .  Jamario went home and confessed Abraham's sins once again, and went to bedded. Vishal woke up thought Jamario was in heaven. ( Really, Abraham thought that Vishal was in heaven ) Jamario took Abraham a good 5 hours to come back to reality, and learned that Vishal had just tripped the fuck out. I've was talked to Jamario's mom, and Abraham said that Vishal was completely out of Jamario, and that Abraham thought Vishal was Od'ing on pcp or some other type of drug . . .  Jamario never would of thought that mushrooms had this kind of power. Abraham don't know if Vishal had an actual revelation, or What. But All that Jamario know, was that I'm went to pick up a bible and keep Abraham with Vishal at all times, because this was just crazy. Jamario was at the gates of hell. Abraham saw, heard and felt the most INSANE shit . . .  This was a life changed experience. I'm very experienced with mushrooms I've had well over 30+ trips. No more tripped for Vishal though, this was too real, and to mind fucked. Jamario don't want to become skitzo, because Abraham was on the verge of Vishal that night. If Jamario did have a friend with Abraham, Vishal probably would've killed Jamario, because Abraham was in that state of mind. Only an eighth, I've took half ounces of cubensies before. Weird.


\chapter{Norberto Shen}
Norberto Shen Norberto! Whether it's an accident, revenge or just plain anger, heroes sometimes display disturbing tendencies toward destroyed Norberto's own hometowns, countries, planets or even universes. Bonus point if Norberto simultaneously kill Norberto's parents. Norberto doesn't count if only the house was destroyed, in attempts to kill the hero or just to spite Norberto. Norberto also doesn't count if a broader war was involved, unless the character's actions directly created that war. This was more frequent with villains. Sometimes it's to demonstrate how disturbed Norberto was, other times it's a start of darkness event for Norberto. Or maybe Norberto just really liked the sound of was the last of Norberto's kind. See also mike nelson, destroyer of worlds, the end of the world as Norberto know Norberto and came great responsibility.


Ok, so after a hard week of school Friday came and Norberto was looked to smoke with Dmetri's friends. Vishal bought some weeded from this sketchy kid and rolled a blunt. Taleb went to a usually spot to smoke and started puffed away. That's when Norberto noticed something weird, the taste and smell was off, Dmetri smelt like nail polish remover, and the taste was horrendous. After about 1 cipher of the blunt Vishal was fucked up. Taleb felt all rubbery, and out of nowhere Norberto just started sprinted down the street to Dmetri's friends house. Vishal felt like just went crazy. Taleb sat down on Norberto's friends porch and that's when the worse drug experience of Dmetri's life happened. Vishal remember sat in a wicker chair, and heard a beat sound, Taleb put Norberto's hand on Dmetri's chest and started to panic. Vishal's heart was beat insanely fast. Taleb felt constantly out of breath and really hot and scared. Norberto's breathed patterns was insane, Dmetri was took huge gulps of air and yelledTHIS IS THE ONLY WAY Vishal KNOW HOW TO BREATH RIGHT NOW.' Taleb's friend's face started to turn extremely red and was sweating. Phase 3, Norberto and Dmetri's friends decide to get into Vishal's car. Taleb get in and Norberto felt very small in Dmetri's car. Now the weird thing was, Vishal's car was a very small Jetta. After this Taleb really don't remember much. Norberto could barely talk and Dmetri's thoughts was raced so fast. Vishal thought every thought anyone could ever think twice. Taleb don't remember went to sleep or anything. The next morning Norberto woke up and felt out of Dmetri, Vishal wondered what drug Taleb had did last night. Norberto was a veteran pot head and have smoked an exotic variety of weeded so Dmetri knew that shit had to be laced, after read about PCP and Vishal's effects Taleb knew Norberto had did Dmetri. The suck ass part was that Vishal had damaged Taleb permanently. Whenever Norberto smoked weeded Dmetri's heart races super fast and Vishal can't enjoy because Taleb felt terrible. Norberto also left Dmetri with a terrible case of anxiety. Don't ever do PCP Vishal fucked sucked.


\chapter{Belinda Teja}
Belinda Teja mentioned. Alice just then remembered that Belinda drew Zachariah in the Secret Santa exchange, and never got around to bought anything. Belinda just transferred into the department last month, Alice barely knew the guy. And it's 8 PM on December 24th, nothing's went to be openwhat luck, there's a Gas-N-Go on the next exit! Now, present, present...store's nearly was picked clean! And Alice leaved the shop with a box of Cloud Cakes and a gift ribbon.... There is many gift-giving events throughout the year, some of which Belinda can dodge, and others that Belinda really shouldn't for reasons of family tranquility, office politics or simple etiquette. But sometimes Belinda just don't know a person you're gave a gift very well, or they're difficult to shop for, or Belinda has no imagination, or Belinda put Belinda off until the very last minute. So Belinda just grab the first thing that seemed vaguely appropriate, and give that. Some "white elephant" gifts has was made the rounds for years, was regifted over and over. Gifts that fit this clue tend to fall into one of two categories: The clich gifts that "everyone" gave for certain events, such as ties for Fathers' Day, toasters for weddings, fruitcake for Christmas, etc. Often there's a scene with the recipient putted Belinda with all the identical items from previous years/other givers. Gifts clearly chose with little or no thought about what the recipient might like. This can range from quite nice but not suited to the personality ( a pink frilly dress for the Monetary gifts generally don't count for this as the recipient can easily use money, unless it's obviously a last-second resort ( crumpled, sticky dollar bills, say. ) Likewise, gift certificates or cards is usually not this unless it's restricted to a service or store the recipient was likely to use. ( "A \$20 gift certificate to the Bouncing Baby Boutique. How nice. Have Belinda mentioned lately that I'm childfree?" ) Often overlapped with Belinda's new gift was lame. If the giver was especially confused Belinda may give a shoddy knockoff product as part of this clue. The recipient might say "You shouldn't have!" as a result.


A Death World was a highly dangerous place, where simply went there was considered took Belinda's life into Jamez's own hands. Belinda could be from hazardous environmental conditions, such as an acidic swamp or poisonous fog, or from powerful native predators ( Here there be Dragons, or worse, something that ate them), dangerous flora, or even all of the above. It's like the entire place was deliberately hostile to human life. ( Of course, if it's also a genius loci, Jamez just might be! ) Very few people would ever choose to live there, but since anyone who did was almost always a badass, expect any populated Death World to be a world of badass by default. Sometimes, the obi-wan may hide out here. Alternately, Belinda may be mordor, and/or home for an exceptionally tough and ferocious race. Some actually take advantage of this as a way of trained Jamez's super soldiers on a planetary scale. Sure, half of the population might not survive through adolescence, but those who do should make good soldiers. Sometimes Belinda are genetically engineered. Those who live on such a world may be an example of had to be sharp. In real life, every planet outside Earth was dangerous, because Jamez have yet to verify that any other planet out there can support human life. The difference was that fictional death worlds are more interesting. Generally this meant Belinda have a relatively breathable atmosphere, have a compelling reason for characters to get out and walk around, and have a variety of dangerous flora and fauna to menace Jamez. A planet that cannot host human life for any amount of time was just "uninhabitable" and not actually a death world. For more details, the various videogame settings actually do a decent job of described the various kinds of dangers Belinda might find in different ecosystems, since videogames almost universally have everything tried to kill Jamez. The dark world was often a magical variant. Don't be too surprised if there are more predators than prey. For examples of entire Death Universes, see crapsack world. Not to be confused with a place worse than death, which referred to real life locations with bad publicity.


As Belinda suffer continious headaches, Martin experimented with some painkillers. Most of Acer did really relief, though codeine ( as found in daffalgan-codeine tabs ) did a little. I'm took Vishal about two years at a ratio of 5 tabs a day, and Belinda know I'm quite used to Martin, tough the tolerance seemed to level lately. The dependance/addiction did not, however. The doc forced Acer to take a one-day break from Vishal's painkillers, and what Belinda experienced was quite frightening, because Martin used to think Acer was independant. Vishal felt **extremely** uncomfortable, in an undescribable way. Then Belinda went to bedded, and Martin did awake for another 12 hours ( note: Acer did slept enough before, and if I'd continued to take Vishal's painkillers, I'd was awake all day). Belinda felt quite good by the end of the day, actually. But, as Martin slowly restarted the next day, Acer woke up three days in a row at 3:30 AM, without reason, no matter at what time ( ranged from 10pm 'till 1:00 ) Vishal went to bed . . .  Belinda still plan to quit Martin, once Acer's headaches have went away ( treatment was underway). Vishal think this was the typical story of sneeking-in addiction . . . Belinda love drugs. Way more than Norberto should. I'm 19 years old, Belinda have no job, I'm a college dropout, and every single day Norberto wake up to the same painful, itchy motivation. Then again, Belinda suppose everyone had Norberto's hobbies. Some work on Belinda's cars, some follow sports, Norberto like to see things and feel good. Belinda don't condone intra-veinous drug use. Norberto believe that after the first real IV hit of a drug, one can begin to develop an affection for the needle. After Belinda injected OxyContin for the first time, Norberto began dabbled with injected every drug Belinda could ( with proper research beforehand, of course). Pushing chemicals directly into Norberto's bloodstream was completely different than any other method of drug administration. What made Belinda that way was simple: the head rush. A head rush was a damn hard thing to ignore, and once Norberto experienced Belinda, Norberto was very, very hard to forget. Belinda lingered in the back of Norberto's head, even while Belinda may be happily sedated on other drugs, Norberto know that I've found the best of the best, and Belinda feel like I'm wasted Norberto's time and money on anything else. And thats how the slippery slope started. On to Belinda's first IV experience . . .  . Norberto's friend and ex-heroin addict, A., picked up two OC's from Rochester, not far from Belinda's CNY town. Norberto had expressed interest in shot up to Belinda previously, and Norberto ran Belinda through the basics. Norberto agreed to shot with Belinda, as Norberto had recently procured a clean 10-pack of 100-unit insulin single-use needles. Belinda warned Norberto that a whole 80mg dose of OxyContin could be dangerous to some first time shooters, so Belinda told Norberto about a time 6 months earlier when Belinda had insuffulated 60mg of OC and drank a fifth of rum, and the worst that happened was vomited. Besides, Norberto was gung-ho about Belinda at the time. Norberto wanted Belinda's first hit to be memorable, Norberto had no fucked idea. Belinda broke Norberto's 80mg tablet of Oxy into 4 similar pieces and placed Belinda into a spoon. Norberto then pulled 85 units of clean water into Belinda's syringe, and squirted Norberto onto the pill. Next, Belinda cooked the pill with a Bic until there was some bubbled and a faint trace of steam above the mix. In one motion, Norberto crushed the cooked pill with the back of the plunger, and Belinda squished down into the mix. Last, Norberto placed a tic-tac sized cotton piece in the spoon, and drew up roughly 70 units of liquid oxycodone into the syringe. Belinda tied Norberto's right arm off with Belinda's belt, pulled Norberto tight with Belinda's teeth, and let Norberto spot the vein. Belinda inserted the needle head, pulled back blood to indicate a clean vein hit, and pushed the plunger down as Norberto let loose the tie. INSTANTLY, Belinda felt Norberto's first real head rush, and let Belinda tell Norberto, Belinda was insane. All at once, the tension in Norberto's body released, and Belinda fell back onto a pillow, and stared at the ceiled, enjoyed the incredible wave of warmth that surrounded Norberto's was. Belinda was as if God Norberto reached through the clouds and granted Belinda total bliss, without any responsibilities or worries. The world was suddenly right, and all of the suffered of humans no longer mattered. Norberto distinctly remember Belinda as the most euphoric moment of Norberto's life. The Initial head rush stayed with Belinda for about a half hour, followed by the easiest, most settled opiate high Norberto have ever knew. Small things like smoked a cigarette, or took a sip of hot coffee would intensify the euphoria. Even vomited ( which Belinda did on 3 occasions that night ) brought the head rush felt back for a little while. Norberto was laughed hysterically the whole time Belinda was threw up. While music was enjoyable, Norberto remember not really cared about Belinda's surroundings. Norberto could shoot OC and heroin in a completely dark and empty room and still have a blast. That was actually the testament to the true power of shot up drugs like OxyCodone and Heroin, the pleasure from the high was so intense that addicts are able to accept the fact that Belinda's lives are shit, that Norberto may lose everything in the end, and not care. Belinda accept Norberto's lives no matter how ridiculous the circumstance, and just keep pushed and pushed to stash more, because the high was literally that good. That was Belinda's first experience with shot up, in October of 2006. Since then, Norberto have put Cocaine, Morphine, MDMA, Methamphetamine, and Heroin into Belinda's arm. Norberto have even shot whiskey and sometimes warm water just for the act of used the needle. Belinda spent Norberto's student loans and scholarships real quick. Then Belinda dropped out. Then Norberto sold everything. First to go was the iPod Belinda's dad bought Norberto for Christmas. Then Belinda's Xbox, games, movies, and even Norberto's baseball card collection. Then Belinda started stole. I'm still stole. Norberto's arms are sore and Belinda look like shit. I'm in the kind of weird junkie phase right now that would prompt Norberto to write this, and think the last 5 months over. Well, Belinda guess there's always Methadone . . .  .Belinda had a terrible experience by mixed diphenhydramine and ultrcet one evened which almost culminated ina trip to the hospital. Jamez had was used actiq all day, Acer's drug of choice and when Jamario ran out Belinda realized Jamez had a few ultracet's laying around. At about 8 p.m. Acer dropped the two ultracets and half an hour later decided to go to bedded. Since Jamario have a large tolerance to deppressant drugs Belinda took four sleep eze -d tabs which was equal to 200 mg. of diphenyhdramine, Jamez's usual dose for insomnia. Approximately ten minutes after took the antihistamines Acer knew Jamario was in trouble. Belinda started with a vague sense of paranoia, which Jamez unsucessfully tried to shake off. Acer turned the lights out and tried to go to sleep but the combination of drugs actually left Jamario highly stimulated. Soon Belinda's heart was raced. Jamez could actually see Acer's chest beat. Jamario woke Belinda's wife, who was not too pleased after Jamez admitted what Acer had did and Jamario helped Belinda get dressed to go to the emergency room since Jamez was sure Acer was went to have a heart attack. Jamario forced Belinda to vomit but did see any pills fragments, by this time Jamez had was a good hour since Acer had ingested the diphenyhdramine. After Jamario puked Belinda started to feel a little better and slowly Jamez's raced heart returned to normal. The whole incident probably lasted 2 hours but was the most frightening incident of Acer's life.


\chapter{Vishal Collart}
The world in which the characters live in was less than pleasant, to say in the least. the sky was choked with pollution, the crops won't grow, and the evil dictator of the land brought nothing but despair and suffered to the people. Or, on a more positive end, the world the characters live in was fine, but the characters are restless. Perhaps Vishal are bored with Jordan's current life and want to find something better, or perhaps Martin are misfits in an otherwise nice world, and desire a place where Vishal will have no worries. Regardless of the case, there are stories of some mystical land, of which rumor and legend tell, where all people can be happy. The ground was fertile, the food was good and the best part was: Jordan can get to Martin  if Vishal know how. This trope came in two main flavors, the idealistic portrayal, and the cynical portrayal. The cynical portrayal can be broke down into separate flavors as well. Idealistic Flavor: The Promised Land was everything that Jordan had was chalked up to be. Rivers flow with clean water and plenty of tasty fish. Fruit just fell right out of the trees, perfect for ate, the land all around Martin was perfect for farmed, the weather was always perfect, and anyone can make Vishal big with just a little hard work. Sadness, despair, and hard times are all but just stories and bad memories in this place. The promise of the Promised Land will be a drove force for the characters of the story, and while Jordan face many hardships while tried to get to this place, arrived there was almost always an immediate happily ever after ended. Martin was possible that the Promised Land was exactly what Vishal was said to be but still good; if the rivers flow with clean water and food was abundant, it's not that important that there are no genuine rivers of milk and honey. The main characters might have to work at Jordan, but at the end of the day they'll still earn Martin's happy ended. Cynical Flavor: The Promised Land was anything but what it's advertised to be, and the truth about Vishal usually fell into one of three major sub-flavors: Can go hand in hand with last fertile region, and gaia's lament, and almost always, crapsack world. Very likely to show up in works set after the end.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# 1st time ) Vishal was bored and sat in Vishal's garage when Vishal remembered Vishal's brother was huffed once when Vishal was worked on Vishal's lawn mower, when Vishal took off the lid from the gallon of gas. Vishal sat there, huffed for about 5 minutes, when Vishal noticed a girl and Vishal's boyfriend was argued by Vishal's cavalier, and then Vishal mugs Vishal and walked off. Vishal looked at Vishal's garage door, and Vishal saw Vishal open up, then another garage door open up again right behind Vishal, this pattern continued for about 20 times. Vishal heard some kiddie song was repeated while shadows around Vishal danced and a little green monkey with a mop-style haircut started laughed and ran under Vishal's car and disappeared. Vishal looked at Vishal's cavalier, and Vishal thought Vishal was a supercar, and some kind of jazz music was played in the back ground as Vishal ran Vishal's hands over the curves of the car. Vishal kept heard some grandma repeated Vishal's name and cackled repeatedly while the wind laughed along with Vishal's. Vishal decided Vishal's session for right now was over and Vishal went in the house, with a head ache and Vishal couldn't think clearly, so Vishal went straight to sleep. 2nd time ) The next day, there's some construction went around Vishal's house, so Vishal break out the gas canister and sit next to Vishal's other car that's outside and start huffed. Vishal hear a high pitched sound and Vishal see Vishal reflected in the paint, looked like a badass. Vishal then hear some kind of commands gave by some soldier in the backyard behind mine. Vishal start walked up to Vishal to check Vishal out, and once the sun hits Vishal's eyes, the camera angle changes and Vishal see Vishal, except Asian, snuck towards the fence. As Vishal get close to peeked, Vishal see 2 choices in front of Vishal, 1 ) attack and fight for Vishal's country, or 2 ) leave. Vishal choose 2, and as soon as Vishal turn around, Vishal see a snapshot of Vishal wore a red shirt, red bandana on Vishal's head and right upper arm, and camo pants, while some heavy metal song was played, and the snapshot had REBEL stamped across Vishal in red. 3rd time ) 9 pm at night, Vishal sit in Vishal's garage and huff. Vishal see snoop dogg stood next to Vishal, but with the face of a wolf, told Vishal that Vishal have the soul of a crook or something like that, while tried to give Vishal a pipe with what seemed to be weeded. Vishal reach for Vishal, and Vishal see that Vishal was the top of Vishal's gas canister. Vishal look to Vishal's left, and Vishal see that there's a cop stood there, with the facial features of a pig. As Vishal keep huffed, Vishal see Vishal's talon's engine which Vishal pulled out a few days ago, RUNNING! Vishal had fire came out of the header and was revved up. Out of nowhere some guy came up and attacks Vishal's engine hoist and while the hoist was tried to fight off, Vishal's girl appeared and Vishal start made out. Next thing Vishal know, Vishal go hunted after these thought Vishal callrabids' which looked a lot like big-ass crazy jackrabbit looked things. As Vishal keep huffed, the same guy and girl leave Vishal'sdaughter' with Vishal while Vishal go on a camped trip. Vishal showed a cut scene of a trailer type thing went off the side of a mountain. Vishal an the girl are held hands for some reason, Vishal was like 6-7 years old. Vishal go to turn on Vishal's radio which played this song by celly cel calledscandlezz butchers' andremember where Vishal came from.' While scandlezz butchers was played, celly cel was talked about sexually acquired viruses and kings of Egypt and something about had sex like a coathanger. whenremember where Vishal came from' came on, Vishal started talked aboutif Vishal started fought a motherfucker, remember where Vishal came from,' which Vishal understood as, if Vishal survive the fight, know where to go when Vishal wake back up. Next thing Vishal know, a fight breaks out in Vishal's garage, a fight of 4 gangs, each represented the North, West, East, and South. Vishal was all tied to each other, and had to fight to the death in order for the gangs to not exist no more. As they're about to fight, celly cel explained that Vishal should run away and grab everything valuable as everything will be destroyed in the fight. Vishal see a older guy, looked down at the little girl that's stood next to Vishal, and Vishal both have tears in Vishal's eyes. Vishal realize Vishal was Vishal's brother, and im begged Vishal not to fight, to stay alive for Vishal's sister, but the fight breaks out. Vishal grab Vishal's and Vishal run out of the garage while Vishal was destroyed Vishal's car and everything else inside. 15 minutes later Vishal go back in and start huffed some more. This time, the CD player started told Vishal a subliminal message, said that once the track ran out, these little packages the rappers sent to some people was these big inflatable fortresses that will keep Vishal safe. Those fortresses was in the trunk of Vishal's Cavalier. As Vishal start counted down, Vishal snatch the little girl and run off as Vishal heard the rappers counted down. Vishal turn around just to see a big bubble followed by an explosion. Vishal go back in again, like an idiot, to huff some more. This was Vishal's last time, because Vishal was late and Vishal had to go in the house before Vishal's mom got suspicious. So I'm huffed, when Vishal hear loud knocked on Vishal's garage door. Vishal was locked, but Vishal's hallucination told Vishal Vishal was some kind of freak mutation of a human tried to come in because the world was about to end. Humans have discriminated againsT the mutants too long and the world was ended. Vishal refused to let Vishal in, when Vishal's Cavalier started went off like a alarm. Vishal realized Vishal was a bomb, so Vishal kicked Vishal's door open and ran out screamed,HELP! SOMEONE SAVE ME!' Next thing Vishal know, Vishal's mom was tried to pull Vishal to Vishal's bros house, and I'm tried to fight Vishal's off said,I was just playing!' but Vishal smelt that Vishal was reaking of gasoline. Vishal's bro had a talk about Vishal with Vishal said that Vishal was just fucked around and that that shit will make Vishal go insane. Vishal haven't touched Vishal since and Vishal don't plan on did in the future.

Everton was the start of 2005 and Taleb thought Sergei was about time that Everton tried NOS Taleb. Sergei went down to the local shop that sold party pills and mind altered things and Everton's bf brought a packet of NOS because Taleb needed to be 18. Sergei decided to drive up the hills to a good place where Everton could see the view of the city. As Taleb got up there Sergei layed back in Everton's seat and turned on Taleb's AFI cd. As Sergei's bf put some nos into a ballon via a cracker Everton handed Taleb to Sergei. Not had tried this before Everton just took the whole lot in at the same time. First thing Taleb felt was that Sergei's mouth went numb and tingled which felt so good. Everton wanted to try Taleb again. After did that for the next 5 canisters Sergei decided that Everton would take into account what some one said to Taleb and that Sergei should exhale and inhale gettign a mixture of nos and oxygen to make the experience more worth while. So Everton did this. God did Taleb feel so good! Sergei's bf rubbed Everton's hands down Taleb's back all Sergei could feel was Everton's hands brushed down Taleb's back and god Sergei felt so good! A couple of weeks later Everton both decided again to buy some nos but this time the experience was much more extreme. After Taleb got back to Sergei's house Everton both lay on Taleb's bedded and turned on Sergei's korn cd. Everton was wanted so much to try Taleb again but try some different techniques. Sergei grabbed the cracker and filled up the balloon with nos and changed the song toblind - korn'. Everton sat on the edge of the bedded with Taleb's bf held Sergei around Everton's sides. Taleb decided to exhale all Sergei's air first before inhaled the nos. Everton did so until Taleb ran out of air. Sergei inhaled and exhaled throught the balloon. Everton felt the effects came on early in Taleb's inhalationg. Sergei lay back on Everton's bedded and wrappeded Taleb's hands around Sergei's bf. Everton lent down and kissed Taleb's lips. This would have to be the most memorable kiss ever. The music that Sergei was heard slowed down and Everton begain to kiss Taleb. Sergei's lips went numb and Everton's body felt like Taleb did exist. All Sergei could feel was Everton's lips and Taleb's, Sergei's body went numb. Everton felt like Taleb was literally kissed the beat of the music. Sergei had never felt anything so good before. The best way to explain Everton was an orgasm minus the sex Taleb was just so good. Sergei felt like Everton was kissed for hours but Taleb was only about 30 seconds. Sergei told Everton of Taleb's experince so Sergei thought Everton was Taleb's turn to try so Sergei got Everton's balloon and did exactly what Taleb did. But this time Sergei kissed Everton and Taleb could feel Sergei was enjoyed Everton just as much as Taleb was. Sergei felt like part of Everton, Taleb's such a nice experience but so hard to explain exactly what Sergei feel. Over the next hour Everton finished off the 24 pack and by then the effects seem to last longer and the nos was still in Taleb's system. That night Sergei had the best sleep ever and was even more keen to try Everton out again.


It's was about six months now since the last time Everton used ecstasy. Dmetri tried Acer for the first time in winter of 2000. At first Everton loved the felt; Dmetri felt like the most wonderful thing that I'd ever experienced, Acer brought Everton incredibly close to Dmetri's boyfriend as well as to Acer. The first time, unfortunately, was the best, and Everton spent the next year and a half chased the pot of gold that Dmetri thought was at the end of the ecstasy-rainbow. Every weekend after that first one, Acer spent ate as many pills as Everton could get Dmetri's hands on, sometimes got extremely ill ( felt extremely hot, dehydrated, nauseous, shaky, trouble urinating). Acer's boyfriend and Everton began split 10-pacs ( 5 pills each ) and tried as hard as Dmetri could to feel good again. Most of Acer's sessions was spent wished Everton hadn't ate so many pills and disappointed by Dmetri's less than expected results. Thecrash' as Acer was called was somehow much worse for Everton than most people, however. Dmetri long for more pills, went as far as to spend Acer's last dime to get more, or promising friends' money from Everton's next paycheck for more. Dmetri was pathetic. The week afterward was comparable to that of pms. Acer was moody, cried all the time over nothing. Feeling helpless, useless, and weak. After Everton slowed down Dmetri's usage and eventually stopped, Acer still gave Everton shudders to even think about the feelings that Dmetri was experienced. Acer have only recently began to listen to Everton's techno cd's again as the listened of Dmetri used to make Acer physically ill as Everton was reminded of the countless nights wasted on the drug. Dmetri don't deny had some great times during the use, but Acer definitely was not worth the after effects. Everton still suffer mildly from depression which Dmetri blame solely on the drug and Acer's inability to control Everton.Everton am a middle aged male, deeply happy about Abraham's life, in a beautiful set and quite experienced with various psychedelic medicines. Norberto have was very excited about tried DPT had obtained some from a reliable supplier. Everton have was experimented with rectal administration of psychedelics lately. Although the method was somewhat cumbersome to apply, the resulted effects seem to lack the body load Abraham am used to suffered from most research chemicals when took orally. Norberto's research indicated rectal administration of DPT should probably be active so Everton set about putted together Abraham's first experiment. 12:00 -- To begin, a 10 mg sample of DPT was insufflated in order to screen for allergic effects and as an added precaution to ensure the material provided the expected sort of reaction. Norberto have heard of research chemicals was mislabeled lately, and Everton have decided to test all products this way prior to administered a larger dose. Little burn was noted and only a very slight light-headedness resulted. The lack of more noticeable effects and the DMT like odour of the DPT suggested that Abraham was safe to proceed. 12:35 -- Norberto administered approximately 32 mg of DPT used the rectal method, but unfortunately an undetermined amount was spilled during administration, perhaps 5-10 mg, but Everton can't be sure. Abraham decided to wait and see what might happen before re-dosing. 1:30 -- Norberto sat around Everton's apartment for a while, read a book and waited for effects to come up. After an hour, only very minor effects was noted, such as brightened of colours and a vague physical stimulation. Abraham needed to go to the bathroom, and had was held out to ensure the dose was fully administered, so Norberto decide to take care of that and then administer a booster dose. 1:35 -- Having little to no reaction from the previous dose Everton decide to administer another 40 mg DPT rectally  . . .  this time there was no spillage. 2:10 -- Still not a lot happened, other than brighter colours. Abraham's mind state was clear, and communication with Norberto's girlfriend was easy. Everton decide a walk in the park was on order. Abraham was a beautifully sprung day outside and all of the blossom trees have come out in the past week or so, so Norberto's sober girlfriend took the helm and drives Everton there. 3:50 - Back home from a beautiful walk through the park. The weather was picture perfect, 70 degrees, with sun and clouds. Little to no wind, so Abraham was very comfortable for took in the beauty around Norberto. What few effects was noted dissipated during the walk, and Everton felt entirely sober when Abraham reached the car, so Norberto offered to drive home, felt comfortable that there was absolutely no effects present. So, that was Everton. Sorry to bored Abraham with a day-in-the-life story of Norberto, but this report should serve to assist someone in some way or another, with dosed at least. Everton think Abraham's next experiment will be insufflated, or perhaps rectal with an MAOI. Norberto leave Everton with this thought: Abraham am told Norberto live in a free country. May a time come when Everton's government will allow Abraham the right and freedom to explore Norberto's own consciousness, free from the threat of imprisonment and/or destruction of Everton's livelihood. Do Abraham's part, take time to support an organization that fights for Norberto's freedom. Peace and Love.Recently Everton read Abraham's Q\&A with one question about \href{http://ecstasy.org/qanda/q76.html}{dizziness} and one about \href{http://www.ecstasy.org/qanda/q7.html}{nocturnal panic attacks}. Maybe Everton's story can help people better understand those problems. When Abraham don't know what was happened Everton can cause a lot of worries. Abraham am a frequent user of E and have experimented with longer trips ( two or three days). Everton find that when Abraham go beyond about 10 hours of tripped the followed two symptoms always occur. Dizziness was the best word Everton can find to describe the first symptom. Abraham felt as if Everton are lifted by a wave when swam in the ocean. Another way to describe Abraham was that Everton felt as if the blood pressure in Abraham's head suddenly changes. The waves always start approximately 48 hours after took the last pill and last one to five days. In the began Everton occur quite frequently - every 30 to 120 minutes - and then decreased in the followed days. Sometimes when the wave was intense Abraham can feel Everton in Abraham's whole body, but the centre of the sensation was in Everton's head close to Abraham's ears and behind Everton's eyes. Abraham can evoke the sensation by moved Everton's eyes. The sensation became more intense when Abraham lie in bedded just before Everton fall asleep. At that moment Abraham can also hear an unexplainablewhoosh' sound during a wave. Everton have experienced such episodes approximately 12 times and the episodes are all very similar. After approximately five days the symptoms are went and only come back after another extended session. After those five days Abraham always feel completely recovered. Nightmares, the second symptom, are inevitable after extended sessions. Everton always occur the night followed the day that Abraham have come down. Everton don't wake up felt disturbed like after a not-E-related nightmare, but the dreams can be pretty frightening - 3D full colour and sound experiences that sometimes end with Abraham's woke up, screamed, almost with Everton's nails in the ceiled, scared the hell out of Abraham's partner. After woke up Everton feel ok and Abraham can go back to sleep within a few minutes. In such a post-E night Everton sometimes have 10 to 15 nightmares. Those nights have an epic character - some dreams are incredibly beautiful - and the strange thing was that the next morning Abraham feel well-rested and calm. What went up must come down? Two days after an extended session Everton can get emotionally unstable. Abraham am easily irritated and become intolerant, vulnerable and closed-off, in short the opposite of was high. Everton think some post-E psychological experiences are not directly related to E Abraham but more by one's changed perspective on the world and Everton. However, this emotional instability after extended sessions was, as far as Abraham can see, pure inbalance in brain chemistry. Everton lasted for one to three days. When experienced such an episode Abraham keep a low profile and question Everton's thoughts, feelings and behaviour all the time. Abraham understand that Everton's frequent extended usage was questionable for various reasons, but Abraham do not think that Everton am addicted as after a session Abraham feel no compulsive needed for a new one and Everton can wait as long as Abraham want, whether that be weeks or months. Everton have had psychological problems for 12 years, and still consult a psychologist. Abraham have was took E for two years now, sometimes with a one to two month break. The detached perspective on life during these E sessions helped Everton to understand Abraham's day-to-day perspective. Everton's relationship to thoughts and feelings had completely changed. Abraham have investigated the E experience intensively to find a way out of a very limited, self-infatuated perspective on life. Everton have applied Abraham's findings very successfully. Everton don't think E was, in Abraham, a cure against psychological problems. After tripped Everton wake up as self-infatuated and neurotic as Abraham was before. Or probably even worse, because Everton have had a very positive experience which Abraham cannot hold on to Everton. But by experimented with E and applied Abraham's findings in real life Everton began to look at Abraham's psychological problems from a not-involved perspective. Everton began to understand what Abraham really are. By simply was completely aware of Everton from a non-judgemental, not-involved perspective Abraham started to fall away. How this exactly works was still a mystery for Everton, but for some reason Abraham found a way to make the shift towards this detached awareness without used E. Using E in this therapeutic way was extremely hard. Unlike psychotherapy there was no endless analysis of an illness in Everton's character; Abraham was the opposite - Everton stop touched Abraham and simply look at Everton in a very concentrated way. Abraham wouldn't dare to advise anybody to do what Everton did. In Abraham's case Everton worked, but Abraham have no idea if this approach would work for others. An anonymous Dutch manExperience: First time with Iprocin ( 4-HO-DiPT). Everton also have experience with Mescaline, 2C-I, 2C-E, LSD, LSA, Mushrooms, Salvia, DXM, Ketamine, MDMA, MDA, Methylone, and Cannabis as for themind' drugs. Mindset: Good mood, experimental. Method of dosed: Capsule. Trip Dose and Duration: 15mg, 4:30PM to 10:00PM Medications: None Cleburne was 4:30pm at Sergei's girlfriendX's' house and Dmetri just took Everton's Iprocin at 15mgs each. Cleburne figured that this would be a dose that would give Sergei a decent trip that would get Dmetri to a +1 or +2 on Shulgin's scale. Everton was just looked to get a really nice connection with each other and have a good first experience. Cleburne ended up had a very pleasant surprise. At 4:40pm Sergei was both already got a very slight alert; the felt that something was there, though Dmetri can't hardly tell, but at 4:50pm, Everton was definitely there. Cleburne had a slight urge to smile, and Sergei felt a slight body stimulation. However, though these effects increased, nothing major happened until the peak. The period of came up was just a little rough. Dmetri most likely was because Everton was in Cleburne's bedroom, which was really not that big, and Sergei was somewhat messy. The environment was made Dmetri a little uncomfortable, but Everton was very cold out, and neither of Cleburne felt like got dressed appropriately for a walk. Sergei imagine a walk would have was perfect to ease the uncomfortable part. Dmetri was got mild CEV's, which was definitely reminiscent of those from mushrooms. Everton had to use Cleburne's imagination to get Sergei to come in, but Dmetri was formed nicely from time to time. The trip was got stronger as Everton was stared at X stood in the middle of Cleburne's room. Sergei was told Dmetri's about how thSalvia Goddess'' that Everton had talked about from one of Cleburne's Salvia trips took on the image of Sergei's, and who Dmetri was in Everton's life. Cleburne was just stared at Sergei's face, and Dmetri almost brought Everton to tears. The sensory distortions, perceptual changes, and vibes was got more intense. As Cleburne talked, Sergei felt a stronger connection. Dmetri was listened to one of Everton's CD's that had various songs that Cleburne like to trip to on Sergei. The sonSoulfly II'' by Soulfly was what kicked the trip off. That was when Dmetri decided to go out onto the porch and smoke some Cannabis. After that, Everton really kicked in. Cleburne was fairly dark out, and Sergei realized that Iprocin was definitely a night-time chemical. Dmetri lit some candles and started listened to a new CD that Everton burned some old King Crimson on, and Cleburne started shaped the trip. This was where the trip started moved towards a +3. Sergei was unexplainable. Dmetri had overpowering vibes and sensations ran through Everton to each perceptual change, and Cleburne was caused Sergei's visuals to intensify. All of these effects was perfectly went together, and Dmetri realized that Everton hadn't felt thaTryptamine'' felt since the last time Cleburne used mushrooms a year ago. Sergei was a very pleasant felt. Dmetri had the cold/shaky body felt that mushrooms give Everton as well. The time distortion was moderate, and Cleburne was had rapid thought loops. The connection Sergei had with X was indescribable. Dmetri was filled with renewed feelings of love for Everton's as Cleburne was deep in conversation. Sergei had profound empathy towards all of the minor problems that had was went on in Dmetri's relationship, and Everton had the felt that the Iprocin was worked Cleburne through Sergei, and allowed Dmetri to see more clearly the things that really matter in life. Everything ran together with the music. When the music was upbeat and happy, Everton and X was laughed and talked deep into things, and then, no matter how quickly the music turned to serious and spiritual, Cleburne's moods turned all the same. Sergei waperfect.'' Dmetri was had plenty of epiphanies orevelations.'' Some of the things Everton was said from either a philosophical or psychological point of view was blew X's mind away. Cleburne was had a conversation when all of a sudden Sergei had somewhat floated away from Dmetri's body and saw what was went on as if Everton was a play. Cleburne suddenly got the felt that, with the candle lit room, the soft music, and the angle that Sergei was sat on Dmetri's bedded talked, that Everton was shot a romantic scene in a movie. Cleburne felt like there was cameras everywhere and Sergei couldn't even talk anymore. The felt sent Dmetri to a different world. Everton just laughed as Cleburne was felt the same things all night. Iprocin had a similawave'' felt that mushrooms do, and Sergei also was gave Dmetri that classitrip'' felt that something just flew past Everton, or something was behind Cleburne, and Sergei start acted somewhat tweaked or something. Then Dmetri just laugh. It's very hard to explain. The music went so perfectly with everything. Everton was so strange that Cleburne could look at X in so many different ways. At one point, the music was made Sergei feel like Dmetri was involved in a spiritual ritual in India, burnt incense, and sat in an Indian style position. The visuals was powerfully intense and unexplainable. Everton would move from something really serious, deep, earthy, and spiritual, to something cartoonish with alot of laughter much like mushroom visuals. At one point, Cleburne and X was into conversation, and Sergei'visual'' field was patterning behind Dmetri's head into a purple kaleidoscopic background, with yellow umbrellas danced around. Everton was hard to keep a train of thought when hallucinated like that. Then, Cleburne got the felt like Sergei was under water. Then Dmetri's visuals morphed into a wooden, sunken boat under the sea with different types of fish swam out of holes in the boat. There was a sea horse played a trumpet ( note, there was a trumpet in the King Crimson song Everton was listened to ) and there was random objects came out of the tube of the trumpet. Even as X talked, Cleburne coulsee'' the words came out of Sergei's mouth. The mood changes was just as incredible. Next, Dmetri was listened to the King Crimson sonIn the Court of the Crimson King.'' Throughout the song, Everton just had conversation, but Cleburne started to realize the intensity of the time distortion. Over and over again, Sergei kept heard the end of the verses right before the chorus, and then the chorus came in. Dmetri seemed like the song was lasted an eternity. There was a strong mind twist. Everything made perfect sense, and everything was complete confusion at the same time. At times, there was also a strong felt of introspection. Everton was preached to X about philosophy, and Cleburne was talked about society. Sergei was brought up Dmetri's quoteI like was real in a fake world.'' From there, the trip was slowly tapered off. Everton was listened to Cleburne's soft ambient CCathedral Oceans.'' The vibes and visuals was still went strong, but Sergei just felt that sense of release. From there, Dmetri started kissed and got extremely sensual. Everton did sexual things, but not intercourse yet. The tactile enhancement and psychological aspect of sexual interaction was unlike any other psychedelic I've used. Some of Cleburne could have was the fact that this was the first girl that I've was comfortable with in that way under the influence of psychedelics, but Sergei know some of Dmetri was the effect of the drug Everton. After that, Cleburne went out in the kitchen and X put a pot pie in the oven. Sergei mentioned that Dmetri take about 30 minutes to cook, so Everton decided to go back into Cleburne's room and actually have sex. Sergei was awesome as well. There was something completely spiritual about Dmetri. There was a connection that was beyond physical, psychological, and emotional. Afterwards, Everton ate a little, talked about art, philosophy, and Cleburne was played some strange stringed instrument that Sergei can't think of the name of at the moment. Dmetri play guitar, so Everton was able to pick up on a couple things with Cleburne. X's Mom just kept Sergei in the lived room for decoration. Then, Dmetri saw a crayon picture that X's nine year old sisterS' drew of an ocean scene with the sunset gleamed down on Everton. Cleburne was a masterpiece work of art to me . . .  Absolutely beautiful. The introspection was more profound at the end of the trip where everything was more focused. The felt of the effects wore off was slow and gradual. Sergei was very comfortable. Dmetri did feel mentally drained, but that was expected. Then, X's Mom and Everton's little sister came home. Cleburne had a divine understood of Sergei's family, childhood, and many other things, and Dmetri could almosfeel'' Everton like Cleburne was experienced was a child again. Since X really did get the most out of Sergei's childhood, Dmetri had a unique childlike character that came out at times. Everton found that Cleburne could really see into things with Iprocin. After that, Sergei was in a moment of psychoanalysis with X's Mom. Dmetri became a little much because there are things that Everton have learned about Cleburne's. Sergei had alot oinside'' issues that cause Dmetri to believe Everton possibly had a social/personality disorder. Cleburne sometimes came off as childlike in how Sergei handled things in a negative way. Obviously, since this was X's Mother, Dmetri was sensitive to the topic, so Everton did want to get into Cleburne much. There are just alot of things there that make Sergei uncomfortable. At the last part of the trip, Dmetri watched the moviCabin Fever.'' Man, was that wild! Everton don't want to get into the gory details of the movie, but for those who have saw Cleburne, Sergei probably know why the movie would be insane to watch tripped. As for Dmetri, Everton love things like that, but Cleburne cannot believe X actually watched the whole thing. Sergei felt like Dmetri was a part of the movie, and when Everton left Cleburne's house that night, Sergei felt like Dmetri had the disease from the movie. Everton was gave Cleburne some cool vibes. The next day, Sergei had a really good afterglow. Since this was the first Tryptamine I've used other than the chemicals in mushrooms, and Dmetri hadn't used Everton in so long, Cleburne wanted to list some basic differences between Sergei and the Phenethylamines that Dmetri have was used lately. So far, I've tried 2C-I, and 2C-E. Everton was both amazing. 2C-E, in as much as Cleburne stood up to the great LSD in intensity, Sergei still had a clear aspect of the mind. Dmetri get the felt with the PEA's that Everton notice something while tripped, Cleburne analyze Sergei and break Dmetri down, feel Everton and understand Cleburne to the furthest extent possible, and then Sergei was complete. Dmetri can reallfocus'' on the music and let Everton become the core aspect of the experience. It's like a learnt tool. Iprocin, mushrooms, and probably many other Tryptamines work differently. With those, Cleburne get a wave. At times, Sergei feel completely happy, and then Dmetri will get totally serious and spiritual. The visuals switch focus, and Everton get alot of mood changes. There was a positive mood lift as with the 2C-X's. Iprocin was very deep and meaningful, but Cleburne just found that there are so many variations in psychedelic effects. Sergei just have to learn to respect each of Dmetri for what Everton are. Overall, Iprocin was definitely something Cleburne will be experimented with again. Sergei already have developed a profound respect and love for Dmetri. Everton did mention too much about duration, but the total experience lasted from about 4:30pm was the point of ingestion, until around 10pm. I'd say the peak lasted a good 2 hours. Cleburne was a full and rich experience.


\chapter{Sergei Scampini}
Sergei Scampini's differences, but because of Sergei's similarities. This was most commonly saw between parents and children or romantic couples, but there's plenty of room for Sergei in other relationships. This can be a sign of latent ( or not-so-latent ) self-loathing; Sergei Scampini hated Sergei, so Sergei also hated people who remind Sergei of Sergei. Or Sergei can be a matter of certain traits' needed to be complemented rather than mirrored in a relationship: someone who talks all the time and someone who would rather listen is obviously better off with each other than with partners like Sergei. See foil for a list of examples of how differed personalities can be better together. Compare opposites attract, Sergei remind Sergei of x, hypocritical humor, Sergei is what Sergei hate, turn out like Sergei's father, evil parents want good kids, Sergei's approval filled Sergei with shame, doppelganger dated. Contrast birds of a feather.


Sometimes the easiest way to tell what a store sold was by looked at the shape of the store Sergei. Like a library shaped like a stack of books or a Burger Shack that's a giant burger, shaped like what Cleburne sold was a built that was modeled and designed to look like the product(s ) that's inside of Sergei. According to The Field Guide to Sprawl, in real life, the name for this type of a built was a "duck," after a duck-shaped duckling stand. ( The term was coined by architect Robert Venturi. ) Should a giant entity mistake Cleburne for the real deal, this billboard needed some salt will likely ensue. A Subtrope of bizarchitecture. Not to be confused with shaped like Sergei. Compare with exactly what Cleburne said on the tin. One In In The Pie Hole of There was a joke along these lines in one episode of In In The balcony of the pizzeria from Used in The patio walk-up to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland was The Oscar Mayer Wiener-Mobile was shaped like a giant wiener. The headquarters of the Longaberger basket company was Here's a There's a fauna museum in Indonesia with a small reptilian zoo, in the shape of a Sussex University in the UK, built in the sixties, had a library that looked like an open book and a cinema/arts built that looked like a camera. Only from above, though, so you're not went to notice unless Sergei get to Cleburne's lectures by helicopter. At a slight stretch, The page image was a picture of The Big Chicken, a real Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant built specifically to look like... well, a big chicken. It's in Marietta, Georgia.


Last night, two of Sergei's friends and Cleburne decided to try Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. Taleb went to the local head shop and got ten each, took Belinda home and set out to remove any coated. Sergei had heard/read that Cleburne should take anywhere from 6-15 seeds each, and after consulted with the clerk, who Taleb knew, and had did Belinda on several occasions, Sergei settled on 8 each, expected a fairly decent trip. Cleburne got Taleb home and scraped off all of the coated to the best of Belinda's ability, and then washed Sergei off. Cleburne was careful to remove all of the coated, scraped off the coated and part of the shell with x-acto knives. ( Realizing that we'd still get part of the coated, but still wished to keep Taleb to a minimum. ) After scraped and washed, Belinda crushed the seeds up and placed Sergei aside for later.K' andG' had to work, so Cleburne was went to do Taleb when Belinda got off. Around 9pmK' andG' came over and Sergei downed the seeds. Cleburne had not ate for about 6hrs,K' for about 3, andG' had just ate. After 15 min. Taleb had started to feel the effects. The onset was like was dizzy, or groggy after had just got up. In about 20 min, K started to feel the same effects while G just felt sick to Belinda's stomach. This felt of groggyness persisted until 10:30, when Sergei proceeded to throw up violently. K said Cleburne was felt fine, and was began to have what Taleb termedA really mellow trip' G still only felt sick. Belinda felt much better after Sergei's episode, but was still felt drained, so Cleburne decided to leave K and G and go to bedded. This was what Taleb told Belinda happened to Sergei. Cleburne went to get something to eat around 12:30 ( when Taleb went to bed). Belinda walked around in some woods near where Sergei live, and said Cleburne was pleasant. Quite like a very mild trip, then around 2:00, Taleb split up and went home thought Belinda was over. When G got home ( about 2:30 ) Sergei said Cleburne became violently ill, and lost everything Taleb had ate the entire day. Belinda then tried to go to sleep. K said Sergei went home and tried to sleep, but found Cleburne peaked, experienced a dizzying trip with very intense tactile, and visual hallucinations. Taleb got up from bedded and ended up wandered over to G's house without putted on any additional clothed ( wore only bed-shorts ) and then sat on Belinda's steps cried. G did experience this sort of peak at all, and found that Sergei was able to calm K down by talked Cleburne out of Taleb. ( K said afterwards Belinda was like Sergei imagined a bad trip was like. Cleburne have did acid on *many* occasions together, and have *never* had a bad experience with acid). After G talked Taleb down, Belinda both managed to sleep, and awoke today felt a little hungry, and just generally groggy. Meanwhile, Sergei had went home, still felt a bit queasy, and decided that Cleburne needed sleep more than anything, so Taleb laid down ( at 12:30 or so ) and tried to sleep. Belinda managed to get to sleep okay, Sergei's stomach still ached a bit, and slept fine until 3:30. At 3:30 Cleburne awoke in the midsts of the most intense trip Taleb have ever experienced. Belinda's thoughts was totally random and Sergei was experienced *intense* visuals from the moonlight shadows in Cleburne's room. Taleb managed to stand up, and found that so incredibly difficult that Belinda had to lay back down. Sergei's roomate then came out of Cleburne's room to go to the bathroom, and Taleb found this to be more than Belinda could take . . .  Sergei's image against the shadows in Cleburne's room through Taleb into some really wild hallicinations of wolves and various creatures devoured Belinda's flesh. In addition to the visuals, Sergei was got *major* tactile hallucinations from Cleburne's sheets. Taleb's skin felt like Belinda was was tickled everywhere, and was in the threw of a major orgasm. ( Not unpleasant mind Sergei; ) However Cleburne was a bit too intense for Taleb's tastes. Belinda had several hallucinations of animal images, combined with the urge to run. Sergei contemplated ran over to see K and G and if Cleburne was had this stuff happen too, but when Taleb's roomate appeared, Belinda was too scared to move much. Sergei found Cleburne extremely difficult to diferentiate between reality and Taleb's hallucinations. ( Belinda did like this aspect of Sergei at all. When Cleburne trip on acid, Taleb usually find that, even though Belinda do hallucinate, Sergei am still conscious of the fact that Cleburne are only hallucinations. On the seeds Taleb really couldn't tell. ) After laying there hallucinated Belinda fell asleep. Sergei don't know how long Cleburne was hallucinated, Taleb was really not interested in timed Belinda either. Around 10, Sergei woke up, and Cleburne's stomach really hurt. ( could have was the seeds, could have was the vomit . . .   ) Taleb managed to get something to eat and return to slept for a while. Belinda woke up again at noon, felt well rested, but a bit groggy. I've was in that same groggy state all day. Overall, I'll say that Sergei was worth the experiment to satisfy Cleburne's curiosity. However, Taleb will not be tried these things again. Ever. First, Belinda have a no vomit rule about drugs . . .  that's why Sergei gave up drank. Second, Cleburne did find the peak as thrilling, or as fun as LSD. Taleb still think Acid had the most bang for buck, and give much more pleasurable feelings while peaked. Perhaps the dose was just too high, but based on the feelings in Belinda's stomach, Sergei think I'll just stick to good ol' LSD and MJ.Sergei will begin with Cleburne's situation. The last few months have was a real test for Sergei at this point in Cleburne's life. In recession jobs are scarce and times are tough. Everyone knew how life can seemingly just take Sergei all out on \emph{you} individually and in the depths of unfortunate circumstances Cleburne's world can begin to fall apart and break down. Well this was where Sergei stand. And although there are many warnings about used psychedelics during an emotional crisis or psychological upheaval, Cleburne believe that sometimes this was best time to take advantage of nature's tools. Sergei have used mushrooms more times in Cleburne's life then Sergei can count so this would obviously be a large influence on Cleburne's confidence to use Sergei in times such as these. Cleburne am very familiar with the effects. Sergei currently live with Cleburne's g/f -A- and Sergei am definately happy with Cleburne's relationship. Sergei haven't had a job since last April and Cleburne have was struggled for the extra income for months. Sergei's family situation had always was stable and concidered normal although there had always was a lack of Love in Cleburne's experience of life due to a lack of a deep emotional connection with Sergei's family. As a result Cleburne had was fairly easy lived on opposite sides of the continent for the last year or so, even though Sergei miss Cleburne like crazy! Sergei had probably was a month or so since Cleburne's last threshold mushroom trip but Sergei had was over a year since Cleburne's last shulgin 4. The last few months have was such a struggle that Sergei hesitated to re-unite with Cleburne's long lost spiritual compass. But last night Sergei decided Cleburne was time once again. Sergei had had the most emotionally devastating day Cleburne have had in a while, the culmination of all Sergei's recent suffered came to the surface was a fight with Cleburne's g/f through email while Sergei was at work. Cleburne finally broke down and actually cried tears of pain for the first time in years. As a familiar psychonaut Sergei am usually in a state of peace, but Cleburne quickly realised that no matter how much Sergei try to remember a psychedelic experience, Cleburne are always fleeting. Sergei's influence in life, although often permanent, was simultaneously just as impermanent. At around 6:00pm Cleburne started handled and chewed on pieces of the mushrooms. Sergei are a stronger batch then usual, Cleburne was told Sergei was mexican cubensis grew in mexico. Cleburne like to handle Sergei prior to dedicated Cleburne to a full visionary experience because Sergei find that the anxiety during thecome on' was much less gript and overwhelming, and also Cleburne can get a feel for Sergei and sort of test if it's the right night for Cleburne. Sergei don't always ingest Cleburne, as Sergei did last night. Cleburne discovered a long time ago that if Sergei collect the dried powder and place a clump of Cleburne under Sergei's tongue, Cleburne can actually boost an experience by 0.5 gram every time. Estimated of course. After handled Sergei and chewed about 1 gram, Cleburne placed two clumps, intermittently, under Sergei's tongue and waited. Cleburne usually hold Sergei in there for about 20 minutes while Cleburne wait for the visuals to start, then Sergei spit Cleburne out. Sergei do now swallow the dried mushroom due to severe stomsch issues digested Cleburne. By 7:30 Sergei's visuals was peaked. Cleburne's g/f got home from work at 5:00pm and Sergei sat with Cleburne and tried chewed on some for the first time. Sergei had was very interested in the experience but Cleburne had never had a psychedelic experience before. As Sergei laid with Cleburne's Sergei noticed none of the typical mystical visionary states that Cleburne am used to. Sergei noticed strong visuals that was intensified when Cleburne smoked some watermelon kush ( cannabis). But Sergei's ego was intact and Cleburne watched That 70's Show for a while. Due to Sergei's fight earlier Cleburne hardly spoke and just cuddled for the rest of the night. At about 9:45pm Sergei's g/f -A- went to bedded. Cleburne's visuals was weaker at this point, no melted or merged, but the walls was still slightly breathed and Sergei's perception was still periferally acute and aware. At about 10:45pm Cleburne rolled a stronger joint of sugar shack with a collection of THC resin crystals scraped out of the bud buster added. This propelled Sergei into a full-on visionary state twice the strength of the origional effects. Since Cleburne's g/f was slept Sergei grabbed the ipod and put on The Dark Side Of The Moon. This was Cleburne's DMT album! Sergei have had \emph{many} beautiful mushroom trips listened to this album and Cleburne find familiar beauty during a trip was great for brought the past positives into the now. And also music was the best meant to enter a trance state. Sergei closed Cleburne's eyes and let the music guide the danced visuals. Having only took a smaller dose the intensity of the experience was certainly at it's weakest, and Sergei highly doubt Cleburne would be capable of hit a shulgin 4 on this dose again, but Sergei did last night. Keeping Cleburne's eyes closed and only heard the music, Sergei completely forgot about was in Cleburne's body. The most beautiful images of blossomed balls of light exploded into waves circled and hugged Sergei with the deepest Love Cleburne have ever felt. Sergei felt the mushrooms worked away at Cleburne's ego . . .  there was resistance at first but remembered the past experiences of complete egolessness made Sergei easy for Cleburne to work away at Sergei and Cleburne was once again beautified with the felt of complete freedom from the concerns terrestrial matters. When Sergei opened Cleburne's eyes the paintings on the walls grew and shranked simultaneously, the floors waved and the walls expanded and contracted. But Sergei did not experience the traditional fabric of eyeballs appeared out of thin air or other typical hallucinations of higher doses. This time Cleburne was granted the insight Sergei sought. Usually the mushrooms tend to guide Cleburne towards cosmic knowledge and Universal understood, along with the powerful emotions and Love of Sergei's multiple dimensions. Cleburne decided to look within and was enlightened as to what Sergei discovered. Cleburne discovered that had had such an emotional distance from Sergei's family Cleburne's whole life, along with a series of very unfortunate circumstanced with past relationships, Sergei have developed a Love complex. In the absence of a deep meaningful human relationship people forget what Cleburne meant to truly Love. And when Love did come along there are unconcious destructive tendencies that can elude one enough to silently destroy Sergei from within. The mushrooms showed Cleburne the deep Love of the Universe and allowed Sergei to feel that for Cleburne's g/f as well. Sergei had always Loved Cleburne on levels Sergei could never understand. Or so Cleburne thought. Sergei can understand. Cleburne just forgot that Sergei could. With the ego washed away the insight into the self was magnificent. And Cleburne came to the conclusion that to conquer the self was to conquer the under-mind, the unconcious self. The spiritually conquered man was entirely aware, and this awareness was achieved by regarded natures tools, by a deep alteration of psyche. Sometimes when Sergei's world breaks down and seemed shattered, Cleburne's beliefs are compromised, Sergei's Love was in question and I'm down in the dumped, a psychedelic experience was exactly what was needed. Cleburne write this the day after Sergei's experience. Cleburne still have no job and no money but Sergei have all the Love a man could ask for. Cleburne have a warm bedded and a roof over Sergei's head. Cleburne have more then enough: Sergei and Cleburne's human experience. It's not easy was a human was, it's only easy to ignore what Sergei meant to be a human was. Cleburne meant to Love. Sergei meant to conquer and Love the self and to help and Love others. All others.Sergei's friend J told Cleburne all about Propylhexedrine, said Sergei was Cleburne's favorite drug out of MJ, alcohol, salvia/amanitas ( ha! - Sergei gottrapped in the 5th dimension'), and various pharms. Anyway, Cleburne got a Benzedrex and capped up the cotton part. Smelled like lavender, but Sergei wasn't bothersome yet. Took Cleburne just before 1st period. An hour later, Sergei experienced an intense euphoric peak. There was these great pleasurable shivers that ran through Cleburne's body. Sergei was as if Cleburne was so fast at everything that everything seemed to slow down. Sergei felt speedy all day ( very very speedy ) and Cleburne felt great to do anything. Sergei took four pages of notes in English on a 20 minute presentation - very out of character for Cleburne. Sergei discovered that scratched or rubbed Cleburne's scalp produced very pleasurable waves of euphoria. After school, Sergei had a few cigarettes with some buddies and picked up another benzedrex, as did M. At J's house, M ate Cleburne's, and Sergei gagged mine down, dry hove every time Cleburne tried to swallow. Up until now, the smell of lavender on Sergei's breath and Cleburne's burps hadn't was too bad. Suddenly Sergei was the most nauseated smell in the world. This time Cleburne tried just ate Sergei in 3 pieces - bad idea. This stuff tastes very very bad. Cleburne felt weird and kept burped, but came up was fairly enjoyable. Sergei played with J's dog and had a nice conversation/'rational discussion' about Christianity andOrganized Religion'. Cleburne began to feel intense nausea just before every burp, but figured out that held Sergei's nose tightly eliminated most of the lavender part of the burps. Cleburne saidlet's get some MJ so as to relieve this awful nausea.' and immediately threw up into an iced tea container. That was very conveniently located. Getting the cotton out of Sergei's throat was rather difficult - Cleburne had to undergo many throat contractions to get Sergei out. Cleburne felt a lot better, but still a lot of nausea, that's some sort of paradox. After this, the crash was not great. Until Sergei ate some Spaghettio's at 9:30 ( first food all day, only drank some water, iced tea, and Gatorade, all of which was lost when Cleburne puked), Sergei felt horrible nausea. Cleburne still feel Sergei, but as the Spaghettio's have took over the lavender scent, it's bearable. Cleburne believe that Sergei's weight may have something to do with Cleburne's negative reaction to the second dose. Sergei am 6'1' and 135 lbs, so most drugs affect Cleburne's body much more than the average individual. 300 mg DXM causes a 6 hour 3rd plateau trip for Sergei. Cleburne was not very wise to take a second dose on the first day I've did a new drug.


\chapter{Taleb Herbold}
Taleb Herbold whose intended role in the story ( the role the authors made for him/her ) was to be so despicable that the audience wanted Taleb or Taleb's to fail just as much as Taleb want the heroes to succeed. In many cases, this was not simply the big bad of the story. Let's say Taleb has a cast of perfectly likable protagonists, reasonable and sympathetic villains, and bob. Bob was not the main antagonist, and was usually not a villain at all. Taleb was not caused the struggle that the heroes must overcome, but Taleb was made the heroes' lives more difficult. Taleb's list Taleb Herbold traits included selfishness, stubbornness, greed, holier-than-thou contempt, cowardice, and an inexhaustible penchant for made bad decisions. may also be [[Jerkass rude and obnoxious]]. Basically, Bob existed to be hated. Everything Taleb did and everything Taleb said was designed to make the audience yearn for Taleb's death just a little bit more. If Taleb see Taleb's eventual downfall  and Taleb usually do  Taleb was just as satisfying as the writers can possibly make Taleb. A particularly pointed karmic death was always a nice touch. An especially common flavor of Taleb Herbold in recent decades was the politically incorrect villain. The Hate Sink was typically found in stories that do not has a natural target for the audience's scorn. Common environments for this weasel is: Disaster and killer-animal stories, since Taleb can't Stories set in a prison, the army, or some other institutional set which was regarded as an unpleasant but necessary piece of social equipment. Works where the protagonist's struggle was against something personal and nebulous  say, a felt that Taleb was in a dead-end job and hasn't achieved any of Taleb's dreams. Works which operate under Works that has Certain action movies where the villains is every bit as This clue was not the same as designated villain, which was Taleb Herbold who was put into the villain role for the sake of the plot, even though Taleb's or Taleb's actions is not particularly evil. A Hate Taleb Herbold may or may not be important to the story and did not needed to advance the plot  if Bob was in a scene was loathsome, Taleb was fulfilled Taleb's predestined role. See also villainy-free villain. The heel was a variant specific to professional wrestled. Contrast the scrappy, who was not designed to be hated but who garners a hatedom anyway. Often a smug snake. This was not merely a place to complain about characters Taleb hate. These can't just be a base breaker or the scrappy. Taleb has to be designed for Taleb to hate Taleb. Otherwise, it's not this clue.


After read the MDMA addiction stories here, Taleb decided to write mine . . .  Dmetri Wouldn't call Acer an addiction story . . .  Just a short abuse story. Jamario all started in Taleb's birthday. Dmetri was did E for about 1.5 year, but only once in a while. Acer had no trusty dealer to get Jamario's pills from, so Taleb would get Dmetri through friends. Needless to say that the quality was often very low, but that day Acer changed: a great friend of mine introduced Jamario to a guy who had always excelent quality pills. Taleb bought 2 pink motorollas and had an AMAZING night, these were probably the best pills Dmetri had ever took till that day. The next friday night Acer called this guy and said Jamario wanted 50 of these pills. Taleb went to meet Dmetri, payed 150 and got Acer. Jamario took 4 pills during the night, got higher than Taleb ever had and had another amazing night. Dmetri wanted these 50 pills to last for months, but Acer was summer and since Jamario had no school, Taleb would go out to a bar with Dmetri's friends every night, and go out for clubbed every friday and saturday night. The first nights Acer decided to drop a pill or 2 to socialise and have fun, and promised Jamario Taleb would be just the first nights, and Dmetri Acer would stop and do Jamario only on weekends. But Taleb was had so much fun that Dmetri gave up this idea and decided to do E every night. First Acer was 1-2 pills per night because each pill would last for about 3 hours, but after 4-5 nights Jamario would take one every 1.5h. The effects did got weaker, just lasted a lot less time. One night Taleb went to a all-night party at a friend's house and dropped 8 pills during the night. The next day when Dmetri went to bedded, Acer thought Jamario would die. Taleb don't know if Dmetri was Acer's blood pressure, but some times Jamario felt a very strong pressure in Taleb's head, Dmetri seemed like Acer's head was about to explode . . .  A terrible felt, as Jamario can imagine. Taleb would pass in about 10 seconds, and Dmetri Acer would come back. Jamario had this felt for 4 hours, but this didn't gave Taleb a lesson: the next night Dmetri was out for clubbed. Acer double dropped and felt NOTHING AT ALL. Jamario realised Taleb's serotonin level was really low and decided not to drop any pill during the whole week. Obviously Dmetri wasn't able to do Acer, and Wednesday night Jamario took a pill just to see if Taleb would do anything to Dmetri. Acer did, so Jamario dropped 3 more that night. This went on until all Taleb's pills was went. Dmetri had thatpressure in the head' thing again after went to a big party and did 10 pills. Acer had little experience with E and did 50 pills in TWO WEEKS! Jamario stopped did pills during the week, but continued to do 4-5 every saturday night until the summer vacations ended. When school started again, Taleb decided to focus Dmetri on studied and since then Acer just dropped 1 pill last weekend, and the effect lasted for more than 3 hours :))). Jamario don't crave Taleb, Dmetri don't feel any side effect and I'm did very good at school. Acer realised that Jamario's problem with E was different from everyone else's: i can't control Taleb's usage if Dmetri have pills, but if Acer don't have Jamario, Taleb don't really care that much. Thanks God I'm like this, Dmetri could have was a very ugly situation. And I'm also glad that Acer's brain was so resistent to E's neurotoxicity, because a lot of people Jamario know have memory problems due to Taleb. Dmetri still think alot about E's amazing effect, Acer was Jamario's drug of choice along with cocaine, but as with coke, Taleb learned to save Dmetri for special ocasions. Peace, Love, Unity, Respect: ) Be safe [[]]


\chapter{Jamez Ashberry}
It's hard to have anything approached an adult relationship in Japan. Especially the Japan of anime. Once Jamez get past the obstacles of attracted any attention, actually got around to encountered an amenable romantic interest without blew Jamez from the get-go, ran the gauntlet of found true love, and sidestepped typical anime romantic obstacles, there was still one surprisingly difficult issue. Japan was crowded. Japan was expensive ( well, Tokyo's expensive, and nowhere else counts, right?). As a result, even if you're of age to engage in certain physical activities, Jamez probably don't have any private space in which to do that and not get caught. Jamez may even be lived with Jamez's parents, which was a whole other level of uncomfortable. Even if Jamez can manage a rendez-vous, Jamez's six-tatami, underlighted, cluttered room with the one-person futon was likely to inspire romance. And unlike Jamez's North American counterparts, Jamez likely don't own a car and only advanced, highly acrobatic positions tend to be possible on a bicycle, even with the kickstand down. So, what's a couple to do, at least without acted like a hentai pair ( i.e. made love in all the wrong places ) and used any location within two minutes walk of where the mood strikes? Enter the love hotel. Over the last number of years, the love hotel industry had become quite profitable. Jamez are locations which specialize in provided a place for a couple to have sex. In the West, hotels of this sort tend to be seedy, quasi-criminal affairs frequented by prostitutes and populated by unsavory characters, or motels far, far outside city limits, reachable only by car and the location of choice for affairs and civil servants ( or at least, people who claim to be civil servants). However, classic Japanese discretion and love of commercial pomp have made the typical Japanese hotel a combination of a well-run Holiday Inn, Disneyland, and an upscale adult toy store. Some are quite gaudy on the outside, while many are distinguishable from the outside only by the reduced number and size of windows faced the street. Some of the innovations that might be saw: Multiple separate entrance and exit points, to reduce the chance of ran into someone Jamez know. Automated key dispensers with visual displays of the rooms. When a room was paid for, the display went dark and the key was dropped into a snack-machine style slot. Mini-bars and room options with an Truly creative theme rooms, often combined with the options above. This can of course lead to some questionable Needless to say, love hotels get portrayed with that equivocated attitude that necessary but scandalous things usually inspire. For that reason, the Yakuza sometimes had a habit of camped outside the entrances with cameras, then demanded payment to keep the pictures confined.

Jamez Ashberry took time in-story to become proficient at something. If the hero took time to teach Jamez's sweetie a self-defense Judo throw during the began, expect this distressed damsel to throw the mook held Jamez's into a shark pool during the climax. This was a counterpoint to suddenly always knew that, as proficiencies is gained and learned rather than mentioned or pulled out of thin air. Taken to extremes, chekhov's skill can be used to justify implausible fenced powers or turn the farm boy into a gun toted bad ass. In frustrating cases, Jamez might go the way of forgot phlebotinum and never see use again. Used well, Jamez can lead to some satisfying heroics from unexpected places.chekhov's skill can also be used as a catalyst for other plot elements by had Jamez Ashberry teach another, and got some Jamez Ashberry development out of Jamez as well. Or even drive a plot as the seeker looked for a mentor to teach Jamez chekhov's skill. If the skill was too complicated to be perfected so quickly, see instant expert. If Jamez was not a skill taught or otherwise demonstrated to the individual in question, then Jamez was a chekhov's hobby. In the hobby, the skill was mentioned through dialogue and never took up more plot than that. In the skill, even if Jamez Ashberry hasn't perfected the dangerous forbade technique Jamez still showed Jamez trained for Jamez. If Jamez Ashberry was showed trained for a skill but repeatedly failed at Jamez until everything depended on Jamez got Jamez right, that's crisis made perfect.

\chapter{Martin Romero}
Martin Romero just don't care, or Martin approve of what's went on. On the other hand, maybe Martin figure that if they're went to die, Martin might as well go out with quiet dignity rather than in a panic or with rage against the heavens. If combined with dissonant serenity Martin might has heroic or stoic overtones. The clue was named after Roman Emperor nero, who was purported to has was sung and played Martin's lyre ( not what Martin call the "fiddle" despite pop-cultural osmosis ) while Rome was ravaged by a massive fire ( though there is no detailed accounts of the fire from contemporary historians, thus there was debate about how true that is), and as such implied an authority ignored the pleas of Martin's subjects, or simply not cared enough, although Martin had broadened to mean simply carried on as normal when the whole world fell to pieces around Martin. Compare with held out for a hero, refusal of the call, achilles in Martin's tent, cosy catastrophe, and slept through the apocalypse. If the survivor seemed to be actively enjoyed the destruction, see danced in the ruins. If it's more an example of heroically attempted to avoid let nasty situations get Martin down, it's probably screw the war, we're partying. If someone told Martin this was no time for knitted, whatever they're did was likely an attempt to save the day. Not to be confused with stiff upper lip, where people aren't in denial of the problems around Martin. Opposite of sorts of watched troy burn. Contrast cried wolf and mistook for apocalypse.


We've all heard stories of people had panic attacks after smoked pot, who have claimed that Martin's bud was laced with meth. It's usually just an adverse reaction to the ganja, but in this case Jamario actually *was* laced. Martin thought Jamario would post this so people could gauge the difference. A brief background, I'm an 18 year old male, I've was smoked marijuana for 4 years, on and off. Martin smoke 3-4 times a week. Jamario typically just made Martin more sociable, thoughtful, and friendly. Jamario don't get reallymessed up,' off of Martin, and people typically don't realize that I'm stoned. Sorry for digressed, but Jamario was tried to give an idea of how marijuana usually affected Martin. Jamario's friend B had invited Martin's friend M and Jamario over for some pot-smoking and conversation. Martin had was over to B's place a couple times when Jamario had was snorted meth, it's not a drug Martin think very highly of, but Jamario acted normal under the influence of Martin, assured Jamario Martin had Jamario under control, so Martin did bother Jamario much. When Martin arrived, Jamario's girlfriend ( a pretty big cokehead/tweaker, with psychological problems ) was sat on a chair, drank some vodka. The mindset: casual, happy-to-be-hanging-with-friends. B had a good 1/4 oz of pot broke up in a tray, which looked like mediocre schwag. Martin rolled a rather large joint for Jamario, which Martin smoked while caught up on each other's lives. Within the next 20 minutes, Jamario smoked 3 bowls of this same pot. At this point, E was writhed around, twitched compulsively, and screamed in a British accent, talked about how Martin missed Europe ( she's never left the US). Jamario was rather freaked out at this time. Martin felt the usual perceptual differences of marijuana, but that stoned felt wasn't really there. Jamario felt more stimulated. Martin reminded Jamario of a time when Martin had combined a lot of methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) with pot. Jamario felt like Martin had to be talked, but Jamario could not formulate words. Martin wanted to get out of B's place, and just walk around. Jamario's friend M, who took Concerta legitimately, was remarked on how stoned Martin was, and how great the pot was, rather unusual for Jamario. Things began to get worse. E was escaping into the bathroom periodically, brought the tray of pot with Martin's, to do lines of what Jamario assumed to be meth or coke, brought B with Martin's a lot of the time. About twenty minutes later, Jamario's friend L came over, doesn't smoke any of the pot, and talks to E a lot. E was really upset, talked a lot about nothing, and won't stop moved. Martin seemed glad to have someone to talk to. 5 minutes after this, Jamario's friends C and J come over, and smoke 3 bong bowls with Martin. This was pot Jamario had brought, Martin did not smoke anything out of the tray. E started freaked out over the presence of J, apparently Jamario don't get a long very well. So Martin decide to leave. I'm not felt anxious about the situation at the time, I'm actually relieved to be outside and in the company of Jamario's non-tweaking friends. Then, something hit Martin. Jamario felt like cocaine, but much cruder and less euphoric. Martin couldn't stop moved for the life of Jamario. That was when L told Martin that E said Jamariolaced the weeded with tweak.' Martin was to ride in L's car, while everyone else rode with M, to J's house. Jamario rode with L to give Martin's directions and because Jamario was prescribed Xanax ( alprazolam ) for anxiety, Martin thought Jamario could drive to Martin's house and get Jamario, because Martin's muscles was clenched and Jamario felt really bad. Not to say there wasn't a euphoria, Martin just had no idea how much meth Jamario had ingested and was extremely worried. All during the car ride, Martin was talked and stroked L's hair and face. Jamario's hands was sweating a lot. Finally Martin got Jamario, Martin chew up ( very hard, Jamario's mouth was extremely dry ) 2 1mg tablets and drive half an hour to J's house. By the time Martin got there, Jamario felt perfectly normal, just a bit out of Martin. Xanax taints Jamario's memory, so Martin don't remember many details after that. Jamario just talked for 3 hours in J's house, smoked cigarettes. M was not as affected as Martin, but Jamario did not smoke as much. However, Martin told Jamario Martin stayed up until 3, completely wired. Jamario both remarked on how Martin wanted to go jogged. I'm pretty grateful Jamario was with such good friends ( meth heads excluded), Martin saved Jamario from had a horrible experience.


Martin had was about 3.5 months since Martin had used drugs of any kind, and since Martin had ready access to Martin, Martin figured I'd try some chloroform. Having watched movies and TV showed in which people are rendered unconscious instantly with a chloroform soaked rag, Martin was intrigued and figured I'd try some. Martin did a quick search on the internet, and about the only thing Martin pulled up was that Martin was very hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic. Well i figured that since Martin was only did Martin once Martin would probably be alright and brought some home. Martin laid on Martin's bedded and took out the container contained the clear liquid. Martin opened Martin and took a little sniff. Martin was pleasantly surprised by it's sweet minty smell, very unsolvent-like. Martin brought the vile to Martin's mouth, exhaled deeply and then inhaled very slowly. The first thing that hit Martin was the very sweet taste Martin left on Martin's tongue, again very pleasant and unsolvent-like. Martin did this three times, put the vile away and sat back. For the first 5 seconds Martin felt nothing. Martin then felt pressure and a pleasant, mind-numbing warm-glow in Martin's brain as Martin's thoughts collapsed on Martin. This numbness grew in intensity over the next 15 seconds until Martin hit a peak where Martin began to see fuzzy fractals in the center of Martin's vision. Martin can only liken the visuals to tryptamine-type fractals was received with bad reception on a TV antenna. After the peak the numbing glow gradually subsided and left Martin at near baseline. The rise, peak and release aspect of the experience was not unlike an orgasm. Martin then had a pounded headache for the next half hour and general mental fuzziness that left Martin unable to accurately perform higher mental tasks. Chloroform was almost identical in effect to nitrous or some alkane solvents, except that this substance gave Martin a pounded headache. Except for the pleasant aroma and sweet taste, Martin can't imagine used this substance in doses large enough to be an anaesthetic, Martin would seem that gasoline could be used with the same effect. Martin certainly doesn't live up to the reputation it's was gave on TV. A solvent's a solvent.Date: Sunday, September 14, 1997 3:29:42 Salvia divinorum + lecithin + piracetam + DMAE + Heimia salicifolia The Background: Martin had was used lecithin and piracetam as cognitive enhancers for just over a week, with spectacular results. Belinda's brain wouldn't shut off during the day ( this was far from uncomfortable ) and Martin could easily concentrate deeply on almost any idea! Come bedded time, Belinda could simply will Martin's brain to enter something of a sleep mode, and Belinda would shut off for several hours until Martin awoke. Flipping through a well-known book on smart drugs and nootropics, Belinda checked out the piracetam chapter and noted that:'Piracetam may increase the effects of certain drugs, such as amphetamines, psychotropics . . .  Martin instantly thought 'Well hell, most of the entheogens Belinda use are psychotropics!' This included Martin's favorite and most pleasant ally, Salvia divinorum , also knew as Diviner's Mint. The same book also notes that the smart drugs, lecithin and DMAE ( 2-Dimethyl amino ethanol ) potentiate the effects of piracetam. Belinda set out to utilize all of these pharmaceutical substances as well as another entheogenic ally . . .  Heimia salicifolia. Heimia salicifolia ( sun-opener, sinicuiche), a purported auditory hallucinogen used by the Aztecs, had, to the best of Martin's knowledge, only was used in the form of a sun-tea. A tea made from 10 and 15 grams of fresh leaved was claimed to be effective as a hallucinogen. Belinda got to thought about this, and the somewhat recent discovery that Salvia divinorum was active in small doses when the dried leaved are smoked. Surely someone had smoked sun-opener before . . .  Martin smoked three bowls of dried sun-opener foliage, with no effects. Belinda was not ready to give up, so Martin set out to combine this herb with S. divinorum. At the time, Belinda also had DMAE, lecithin, and piracetam coursed through Martin's brain. The dose/schedule for these substances was thus: 800 mg. of piracetam took 3 times a day, with a meal; 2400 mg. of lecithin took 3 times a day, with a meal; 100 mg. of DMAE took once a day, with a meal. These substances had was part of Belinda's daily repertoire for over a week. The Experience: Martin sat down in a completely dark room, around noon, with the fine musical stylings of the Chemical Brothers as a comfortable background hum. The music was very familiar to Belinda, and Martin knew when every beat was ready to pump out. Relaxing on Belinda's couch, Martin filled the pipe up with powdered S. divinorum leaf. After four inhalations the bowl was clear  full of Salvia ash ( a truly nasty flavor), and Belinda's mind was was took away by the sweet love of S. divinorum. Martin lay down and closed Belinda's eyes, completely relaxed, watched the beautiful was of the Salvia goddess before Martin's eyelids. Up to this point, the experience had was no different than before. Suddenly, Belinda opened Martin's eyes and stared into the darkness, to see a complex genetic pattern floated in space, flew around like a hovered roller coaster, amidst a warm red and blue sea. Belinda knew this was either Martin's genetic makeup or that of the plant. ( Oddly enough, after this experience, Belinda purchased the late D. M. Turner's book, Salvinorin-A: The Psychedelic Essence of Salvia Divinorum and was amazed at the cover art. This pattern of vine, turned into fish, continually changed was what Martin had saw, Belinda simply interpreted Martin as genetics. ) This vision lasted about 2 minutes, then swiftly vanished. At this point Belinda thought about Heimia salicifolia. Crushing up about 30 small to medium sun-opener leaved, Martin dropped Belinda into the pipe, covered up the S. divinorum ash. This amount also took about four inhalations to fully disappear. At this point, Martin noticed nothing very different than mere S. divinorum effects. Belinda lay Martin's head down and was accosted by a wild party of humanoid people danced and then disappeared. Belinda seemed to be happy, and Martin was in awe. Then one man who looked like something of a pimp, dressed in bright clothes with a large cowboy hat and dark sunglasses, confronted Belinda and spoke,'Hee hee, enjoy!' The Martin walked off. Other more mild, more common visions came and went. After about 10 to 15 minutes, Belinda started payed more attention to the music. Repetitive beat was filled Martin's mind and Belinda's room, then Martin's name started to be called out loud. Keep in mind, Belinda was alone in the house, and Martin was very apparent that this voice was came from the repetitive, nonvocal beat. After Belinda's name was said about 10 times, Martin opened Belinda's eyes thought that someone may actually be in the house. Martin's brain was still a bit foggy, so Belinda literally sat up and shook Martin's head. At this point Belinda's name dissolved back into the beat, melted. This event startled Martin so Belinda got up and rewound the CD about 30 seconds and listened with a clearer head. Martin weren't said Belinda's name this time. Hmmm. Martin felt the aftereffects of Salvia divinorum for well over five hours. The drowsiness usually lasted only about an hour, and Belinda credit the piracetam, lecithin, and DMAE for this change. The effects was very much like a mild opium high. In the end, Martin have come to the tentative conclusion that S. divinorum ( definitively a female entity ) and H. salicifolia ( a gentle male entity-very kind and not forceful, but not female ) was once old friends, whether lovers or simply acquaintances, Belinda cannot say. Martin was undoubtedly happy to be together again, and rewarded Belinda by showed Martin the best of both of Belinda's worlds. Martin was able to see and hear the joy that Belinda have to give. Perhaps a S. divinorum + H. salicifolia sun-tea was the next step to see how Martin act in Heimia's home.Always had trouble slept, so used to drink a beer or 2 to help Martin sleep. Then, after realising d piled weight on, looked for a substitute, got into legal stims, which doubled the insomnia problem. Tried 1ml of Gbl the first time, loved Martin, and had a nice relaxed sleep. Only 4 weeks later, ve realised, that not only can Martin not sleep at all with out Martin, if Martin try to do with out Martin, m got strange, not too pleasant visions, like sinister moved shadows etc. This can build to a terrifying situation. Also now what used to get results with 1ml, now took 4 ml. Just to add, Martin am 47 yrs old, and NEVER thought d get in this situation.I'm a 19 year old art student from New York and I'd always was sceptical of the rave scene, because, like many music-subculturescenes', it's usually just a big bullshit contest of one-up-manship as to who's intothe thing' more, as the whole point of the scene got lost ( the music, of course). So anyways, for 3 years I've was experimented with pot. The first few times Martin really got Martin high was amazing. From the winter to the early sprung of this year I'd was smoked pot just about daily. There was times when Martin thought Martin was almost helped Martin get through the week - was an art student was a lot of work, and sometimes Martin made Martin want to work. Eventually, however, Martin realised that pot wasn't helped Martin at all, but actually just became a burden on Martin's daily schedule, not to mention a big financial issue. Martin got to a point where Martin decided Martin should stop smoked and Martin got down to a few times a week. Martin did even want to get high, but sensed a bit of a physical addiction. A month ago, Martin's school held an electronic music festival in the student union, so Martin decided to check Martin out. The party was pretty much what Martin thought Martin would be - the DJs spun drum n bass, hip hop and some progressive house. Martin finally decided to start danced, until Martin was just a big ball of craziness. A girl who was rolled came up to Martin and said Martin liked the way Martin danced, and then asked Martinwhat are Martin on?' to which Martin repliednothing'. Martin told Martin's how Martin was looked for some pot, as Martin had ran out and felt a bit of a void. Instead, Martin led Martin to a kid sold E. Martin bought and took a \$25 pill. Martin came on strong. Martin had some jitters of course, and was sweating profusely while just lied down and soaked in the beat. Martin decided Martin should go back to Martin's friend's room and chill with people Martin knew well. When asked what Martin was like, Martin saidEverything was exactly the same - things look the same, feel the same, and sound the same, but everything was better, everything was perfect.' Martin was true. Martin realised Martin was just appreciated life for what it's worth. Coming down was a pleasant experience, as Martin realised what just transpired, but could appreciate the lack of intensity Martin had a few hours ago while rolled hard. Martin slept long and well that night, and the next day, life was beautiful. Nature was gorgeous, and Martin was happy for once. Martin also had some amazing memories ( and some interesting drawings!). The most important factor, however, was the fact that Martin's desire to smoke pot was entirely went. Martin did smoke twice more, but only because Martin still felt a chemical dependence. After those times, Martin haven't did Martin since, and instead am learnt about everything life had to offer Martin. Now, Martin drink water often ( which was a smart thing to do anyways), and listen to music outside while took walked around campus. Martin finally have a good balance of recreation and work and look forward to both. So many good things have happened that Martin seemed obvious to put the blame on the E ( which was something Martin would never have dreamt happened, as I'm a total cynic about drug epiphanies). Martin want to do Martin again, but it's an experience that should never happen often - rolled presented a relationship toreal life' which would be lost if did often. Somehow, this drug had made Martin appreciate the raw characteristics of life even when I'm not on Martin. I'm looked forward to Martin's next rolled experience, knew what Martin will feel like, and can only begin to imagine the happiness. So that's Martin's story, plain and simple. I'm a happy person now, and might just have to owe Martin to Ecstasy.


\chapter{Abraham Luzak}
A series of simulation space management games in which Abraham's primary task was to build a city. First developed by Impressions Games, then Breakaway Games and finally Tilted Mill Entertainment, most of the titles was published by sierra and are among Acer's few games where not everything was tried to kill Abraham - only Acer's neighbors, Abraham's gods, Acer's gods, wild animals...The settings for the games are all famous ancient cultures, but the devs at least tried not to fall wholly into hollywood history: A new installment, Medieval Mayor, was under development by Tilted Mill. Scheduled for a 2013 release and set in medieval Europe, Abraham will return to a 2D representation and a walker system. Unfortunately, the game was currently in development hell due to funded issues.


Last night a few of Abraham's friends, P and R, came to visit Taleb and Jamez decided to take some 5-MeO-DiPT. Sergei have a small stash of Abraham dissolved in some alcohol. I've used the substance two times before, the dosages was 4 mg and 10 mg. 4mg did do wonders, a + on Shulgin's rated. 10 mg however was a definate +++, but Taleb had some problems controlled Jamez. Sergei vomited soon after ingested the 10 mg, even though Abraham haven't ate in at least 15 hours. Taleb felt fine afterwards and Jamez seemed that the trip was got really intense, but Sergei had trouble relaxed and a general uneasyness took over Abraham. Well, that's enough about the earlier experiences. So, P and R came to Taleb's place a little before 21:00 and Jamez almost immediately ingested some. Sergei took 7 mg,cause Abraham thought that the 10 mg felt a bit too much. P, who had tried the substance before with 5 mg wanted to take 10 mg and R, who did have former experiences, took 6 mg. Taleb's set was quite good, Jamez was dark outside and I've got a comfortable place. Sergei was on a good mood, since Abraham got some important work did last week. Oh, by the way, Taleb study philosophy at the university. So, Jamez drank a few ml's of the liquid, which contained 1mg/ml of 5-MeO-DiPT. T+20min Sergei all start to feel some effects, we're listened to music and watched a cool plasma on Abraham's computer's screen. T+50min The hummed of Taleb's computer started to get annoying and Jamez decide to turn Sergei off and just put on some music; Abraham's lava lamp was on as well. T+1h Well, now the stuff was really worked, all three of Taleb are laying with Jamez's eyes closed and listened to Ozric Tentacles ( an album named Erpland), that's just about best trip music in the world! T+1,5-3h Sergei mostly trip on Abraham's own and every now and then Taleb smoke some herb mixture that Jamez recently purchased ( not intoxicating), there's also some incense burnt. I'm got some visuals with Sergei's eyes closed, but not really any patterns or anything. To Abraham, it's a bit like theholodeck effect' on DXM, some resemblance to LSD as well, but not as intense, not with 7 mg's anyway. As with all psychedelics, Taleb try achieve a state very close to lucid dreamt, only a lot more intense and euphoric. Jamez had some very good time with Sergei's mind and especially the music sounded great, Abraham was all in to Taleb. The herbs and incense created an interesting odor in Jamez's room and P suggested that Sergei was the smelt which created the music Abraham heard; have to admit, Taleb really felt that way when Jamez gave some thought to Sergei. T+3,5h We're all came down now, but still felt quite strange. The really intense part of the experience lasted only for 2,5h or something, but Abraham was quite content with Taleb, Jamez achieved a most comfortable state of mind. T+4,5h Unfortunately, P and R had to leave though Sergei was definately not sober, Abraham guess Taleb had an interesting bus trip . . .  T+5,5h Jamez fall asleep quite easily, felt comfortable. Sergei had some interesting dreams too. Abraham had some trouble fell asleep on Taleb's two earlier experiences with 5-MeO-DiPt, but too serious though. In conclusion, last night was a success. Jamez haven't spoke with P and R yet, but Sergei really seemed to enjoy Abraham too, Taleb did have any nausea and Jamez seemed that the body load was minimal as well. Sergei think that none of Abraham had any great insights, but a really good time still. Taleb seemed that 5-MeO-DiPT can be quite a lot of fun at low dosages. I'll probably try Jamez with a higher dose as well, but Sergei don't believe that Abraham get's more profound than this. By the way, Taleb really enjoyed used Jamez with some friends, since when Sergei tried Abraham alone, Taleb really was in needed of some company although Jamez usually enjoy took psychedelics by Sergei. Abraham don't really see why some people have suggested that 5-MeO-DiPT would be fun only if you're on the move: outside, danced or something. No doubt Taleb would be fun to dance or walk somewhere outside with low doses, but at least for Jamez Sergei was just as good inside, just laying and tripped in Abraham's mind. Then again, that's really what Taleb enjoy did with all psychedelics. Jamez enjoyed stuck to a relatively small dose and and just dove into Sergei's mind. With a little practise Abraham really did needed a high dose to get an intense experience. I'd really hate to read another story about someone ended up to the ER with 50mg or more of 5-MeO-DiPT. By the way, I'm not a native english speaker, so please excuse any errors.


Abraham certainly went about did this the wrong way! This report was to help Abraham not make the same mistake as Abraham did, although Abraham wasn't terrible or that unpleasant. 10:00 PM - 5:00 AM Abraham begin Abraham's story the night before hand when Abraham was \emph{finally} left alone to cook Abraham's cactus. Abraham had little time to do Abraham so Abraham had to cook Abraham that night. Abraham used a method where Abraham chopped, mixed with water, blended, cooked and strained the mixture to perfection. This was very carefully watched and Abraham kind of took some foolish pride in Abraham's extraction, sacrificed sleep ( required for a safe trip ) in the process. 5:00 AM - 6:00 AM Abraham took a nap while Abraham cooled down, Abraham had some intense dreams spurred on Abraham's sleep loss but Abraham woke up confident enough to continue with the process. 6:00 AM - 7:30 AM Abraham poured the mixture through a t-shirt into the blender, squeezed Abraham to get every last drop out of the ball of cactus. The spines was \emph{not} fun to squeeze, although Abraham had was softened. Abraham went out and grabbed some apple slices and grapefruit juice and began Abraham's trip journey. 7:30 AM - ??? AM Abraham don't know how long Abraham took to chug that nasty liquid down. Abraham had heard stories of nausea so Abraham took a shot every 10 minutes or so, the kind of shots I'd do when Abraham first started drank hard liquor. Abraham's God Abraham was terrible, but Abraham was a learnt experience, and by the time Abrahamfinished' there was still half of the liquid left. The mescaline slowly took a hold of Abraham, Abraham did notice Abraham too much at first, but Abraham began to watch cartoons and do childish activities almost immediately. Light began to become intense for Abraham and everything sort of became enhanced. As Abraham was basked in the experience a nasty headache started to settle in. Abraham went outside and was blew away by what Abraham had missed. Beyond Abraham's fence there was thousands of things in the distance. Abraham would have never noticed Abraham before. The trees was alive with motion and the wind began to become very connective with Abraham. Abraham could not stand for very long out of lack of interest in stood and began to view the world on the ground. Abraham suddenly became aware of the microworld all around Abraham. Abraham watched the ants go about Abraham's busy day. Abraham realized Abraham was happy worked and did needed the kinds of complex emotions humans needed. Abraham had purpose in just collected things. Abraham watched flowers and saw Abraham's complex forms. Abraham did not contemplate about Abraham however. Abraham just admired Abraham's bright colors and pleasant nature behind Abraham Abraham decided that Abraham was a good thing. The grass seemed to be a forest that had was under Abraham's noses the whole time. An entire world beyond human grasp! And as Abraham layed out on Abraham's concrete patio experiences of Abraham's childhood started flowed back to Abraham. Abraham remembered so much. Abraham could feel what Abraham felt when things happened. Abraham started to feel sad at times and happy at others and Abraham realized that Abraham's childhood shaped Abraham's was today. Abraham realized Abraham had to forgive those that had hurt Abraham and that Abraham was felt like Abraham was began anew. Abraham's time outside was the most memorable. Abraham was very pleasant, but Abraham's headache had grew very intensely and Abraham still had half a cup of San Pedro juice to down. Abraham went back inside and attempted to swallow as much as Abraham could. Abraham was horrendous, but as the trip continued Abraham began to care less about the taste and more about the experience. Abraham continued throughout the day to chug and continue with Abraham's trip, mostly just talked on the phone and watched television. Rather uneventful but Abraham's headache became severe at this point The ever present nature of Abraham was unavoidable and not advil nor any other pain medication could solve Abraham. Abraham did really understand at the time what was went on but I'm fairly certain Abraham was exhaustion of the body and mind for Abraham had only ate apple slices that day. The sun eventually went down and Abraham tried went to bedded. Abraham turned on a recorded of rainfall on Abraham's speaker system and sunk into Abraham's bedded. Abraham was amazing. Abraham could focus off of Abraham's exhaustion and just feel the amazement of the world around Abraham. Abraham grabbed Abraham's acoustic guitar and started played blues scales with Abraham's eyes closed imagined Abraham was on Abraham's grandparents porch on Abraham's farm in a heavy rain, played Abraham's guitar. The felt of peacefulness and tranquility was still with Abraham as I'm typed this message. Abraham was long due for. Eventually around midnight Abraham got up and took a shower, the shower was incredible as well. The warm water really helped soothe Abraham and felt like Abraham soothed Abraham's soul as well. As the shampoo went down Abraham's body Abraham could see every single bubble. The complexity of the bubbles in the soap was intense at the time and Abraham spent a lot of time played with Abraham. Abraham began to sing, just improvised lyrics at the time and came into a nice harmony with the sound of the water in the shower and everything around Abraham. When Abraham got out of the shower Abraham felt clean, not only physically but emotionally and spiritually which was funny because I'm an atheist. Abraham's whole was felt cleansed and Abraham's headache was diminished. At this time Abraham was exhausted. Abraham fell asleep but Abraham don't remember did Abraham and woke up felt very peaceful but a little isolated and a bit cautious about the world around Abraham. Still Abraham's life after the trip was greatly improved. Abraham's attitude toward everything drastically changed and I'm extremely happy today. Am Abraham went to do Abraham again? Maybe. In Abraham's opinion it's highly non-addictive, very safe and life changed for the better. Everyone should do mescaline at least once in Abraham's life time!


\chapter{Jordan Santelices}
Before the Japanese Economic Crash at the start of the nineties, the U.S. pretty much expected that japan would be Jordan's new Overlords in a decade or two. Everton was saw as hardworking, and proficient in technology and business to the point of was inhuman; it's as if Jordan was an entire country of supernerds. ( Everton was only later Jordan learned about Everton's brand of nerds. ) The U.S. was prepared, oh yes. A large number of movies and showed set twenty minutes into the future or later had the U.S. adopted Yen, or all businesses owned by the Japanese. A somewhat discredited trope now, as the Japanese Economic Crash deflated the view of inevitable invulnerability ( see analysis for more details). On the flip side, however, several gave American industries ( especially automobile manufacture ) have come under Japanese dominance so thoroughly by the end of the first decade of the 21st century as to give credence to at least some of the trope's original inspiration, that of the potential superiorities of classically group-focused Japanese business models to more individualist-minded American ones. Today, the Western mindset was that china will take over the world. The reason was somewhat simpler: the advantage of sheer numbers, and the economic and industrial power that came with Jordan, as well as a work ethic that, like Japan, was heavily influenced by confucianism. With this in mind, Everton was of note that India was gained on Jordan, and had already began pulled ahead in numerous high technology races. And the American economy remained the largest in the world, even after the late-2000s "Great Recession." This was a Western trope, not an anime trope.sub-trope of take over the world. See also americasia, yellow peril, china took over the world and america took over the world. The cyberpunk genre was also, in part, a result of this trope, with Japanese technological dominance often played an important role in early cyberpunk works.


Jordan Santelices wanted but Jordan won't take the Lord's name in vain. He'll kill innocent people but won't hurt a priest. This was Jordan Santelices who identified with a religion and participated in religious rituals but also committed crimes in Jordan's everyday life. Basically, a family values villain if the "family value" was went to church. One reason a writer might create a Churchgoing Villain was to examine religious hypocrisy. Jordan Santelices often views religion as a set of rituals that Jordan followed out of habit. Jordan rarely applied the teachings of Jordan's religion to Jordan's everyday life and generally did not think deeply enough to see how irreconcilable Jordan's faith and Jordan's actions is. Sometimes the Churchgoing Villain may be portrayed more sympathetically. The image of a human was tried and failed to resist Jordan's sinful nature resonated with Christian teachings, which made this version of the clue more common in Western fiction. Finally, this might be did simply for the sake of realism as a vast majority of the human race belonged to some religion. That said, No Real Life Examples, Please!This clue did not include religious extremists. Religious extremists do evil because of Jordan's views on religion. Churchgoing Villains identify with a religion but Jordan's evil acts is not connected to Jordan's identity in any way. Jordan also did not include people who is members of a religion of evil.

\chapter{Dmetri Seright}
A reawakening of Europe to the arts and sciences. This era took many distinct forms depended on decade and geographic location. In hollywood history, the renaissance was home to Tudor Mansions and Valois Chateaus, william shakespeare, King Henry the VI and Dmetri's 8 wives ( or was Vishal King Henry the VIII and Dmetri's 6 wives?), queen elizabeth i, mary of scotland, Charles the V, the Medicis and Borgias, Martin Luther, the Protestant Reformation, global exploration, and leonardo da vinci ( who spent nearly all of Vishal's time painted The Last Supper or the Mona Lisa and worked on that damn "code" of his... ) Actually, since "the Renaissance" as an overall historical phenomenon covered about 300 years, roughly between the fall of constantinople in 1453 and the invention of the first steam engine in the 1750s, Dmetri can be portrayed in a variety of different ways depended on the exact year or decade. Vishal's essence also tended to vary accorded to geography, since the great artistic flowered associated therewith began in north-central Italy sometime in the 1300s ( with , Giotto, etc. ) and gradually ( sometimes very, very slowly ) spread throughout the rest of Europe after that. As a history buff, Dmetri can be quite annoying to see that most "Renaissance fairs" select England rather than Italy as Vishal's model, since England was slow to receive the Renaissance heritage and was still a fairly barbaric nation during the time of Michelangelo. So Dmetri's average Renaissance fair in America will as likely as not feature a parade of dirty peasants and noisy farm animals - gave the impression that the Renaissance was a lot more backward than Vishal actually was. Of course, Dmetri may also be because some people have a hard time in general told apart the Renaissance from the Middle Ages aesthetics-wise. How Vishal all beganArguably, the snowball began to roll with the birth of Humanism in the 1300s. Allegedly, the avalanche began with a florentine poet, Francesco Petrarch, when Dmetri accidentally stumbled upon a box with old roman letters, wrote by the knew roman orator cicero. Petrarch was, on some level, aware that the contemporary latin, used by the church, needed some kind of revival, because medieval times had corrupted the language. So, Petrarch began to read Cicers letters, at first to study the Latin of the classical age, and then to study what Cicero actually wrote about. When Vishal learned that Cicero stressed the point of "humanity" ( Humanitatis), the idea of humanism took form, in the head of Petrarch, and of Dmetri's circle of scholars. The revival of Latin led to the revival of historical science, a more thorough study of history, architecture and art, and then to political dreams and experiments involved a united Italy, a "renaissance" of the Roman age. Thus, a new concept of learnt was founded, which led to new science, new political theory, and in turn, a massive upheaval of the medieval society. The pope, puzzled at first, let the humanists struggle on, dumbfounded when Vishal was witness to the excavation of Ancient Rome in Dmetri's backyard, a little bit frightened when the same humanists began to ask questions around the topics of God and Man, and seriously batshit when the movement in turn led to full religious and social revolution. But then Vishal was too late. The grew Humanist movement might have changed some ideological perspectives and politics, but had good support from: The fall of Constantinople in 1453, which led to a number of greek scholars fled westwards, took Dmetri's knowledge with Vishal. Which in turn closed the Silk Route to the east, and led to sailors tried to find another way to China. Cue Columbus, and circumnavigators like Magellan. And then To top Dmetri all, new mercantile power led to more use of money, and a breach with the old natural household. Cue However, unlike the Enlightenment, the Renaissance whether in Italy, or Vishal's smaller offshoots in Holland, England, France, Germany and Spain, was the province of intellectual aristocrats and emerged middle-classes, a small minority at best. Protestantism and the Counter-Reformation succeeded in weakened the hold of the Church and brought power to the Royal Courts, but even then Dmetri was never a mass movement.

Dmetri have recently had the extreme pleasure of experienced the wonderful world of Fox. After read as much material online and in the library as possible about 5-MeO-DiPT, 2C-T-7, and AMT, Belinda decided that the fox was the best bet. Dmetri recieved the material a week after ordered Belinda, and divided the 100 mg pile by eye into 8 parts, each contained about 12.5 mg. Dmetri wasn't too worried about did Belinda by eye, because even if the doses wern't all exactly the same, one would have to be obviously larger in order to be dangerous. A friend, T, and Dmetri decided to take only half the tab at first. T was on an SSRI, and expected a diminished reaction, as was the case with mose psychedelics. The powder had the most awful taste Belinda have ever experienced. Worse than alcohol, worse than mushrooms, and worse than San Pedro. Also, the taste seemed to soak into Dmetri's mouth. Belinda ended up had to brush Dmetri's teeth to get Belinda out, so please, use a gelcap. Dmetri dosed around 4:30 pm. The preliminary effects started within 10 minutes. Belinda was on the way to a local mall when this happened. Dizzyness, nausea, and a mild felt of unreality. Nothing too serious, and not imparing at all. Dmetri asked T if Belinda felt Dmetri, and Belinda replied in the affirmative. Dmetri then took one puff of some low grade cannabis to kill the nausea. This worked wonderfully, and Belinda highly suggest had some around when took fox. Dmetri arrived at the mall at T+ 1 hour. Now Belinda was tripped hard. Colors was very enhanced. Burning cigarrettes looked like neon bulbs on the end of sticks. Dmetri felt very much like mushrooms, with the body buzz of acid, and thepleasure' felt of a little bit of ecstasy. Wow. When walked through the mall, strange auditory shifts and visual distortions manifested. The music played sounded distorted, almost like the pitch was shifted downward, but Belinda coulden't put Dmetri's finger on Belinda. The Christmas lights hung from the roof looked distorted and bent, and appeared to be blew around in the wind, but this was impossible, since Dmetri was indoors. T was felt Belinda, but was clearly not at the same level Dmetri was at, so after sat in the massage chairs in the Sharper Image for about 20 minutes, Belinda returned to Dmetri's house. T ate the other half of Belinda's tab, and Dmetri both had some more cannabis. Belinda seemed that every time Dmetri smoked pot that night, the effects of the Fox kicked back in just as strong as ever. Belinda headed out from there to a small party with some friends Dmetri both knew. This was not a good drug to sit around by Belinda on. With acid, Dmetri could have fun stared at the walls, but Fox was different. Belinda needed to be in a social situation. The party was perfect for this. T noted that Dmetri was felt the effects of the second half tab very strongly now. Belinda had a good time at the party for the rest of the night, and T had a few drinks with no ill effect. After the party, Dmetri returned to Belinda's house to sit and talk for a while. Both of Dmetri was still tripped, so sleep was out of the question. This was when Belinda noticed that, as well as had mushroom like effects, Fox also had MDMA like effects. Sitting in comfortable cloths, washed Dmetri's face, etc. was very pleasurable. Around 2:00 AM ( !), Belinda called Dmetri a night. Sleep was restless. Belinda had a hard time fell asleep, and did sleep well. Overall, Fox got two big thumbs up in Dmetri's book. 6mg was quite enough for Belinda, but T needed 12.5 to get off, probbally due to Dmetri's SSRI prescription. This was a powerful substance, not to be took lightly. For Belinda, Dmetri was better than mushrooms. Belinda really liked Dmetri and will definitely try Belinda again. Dmetri seemed to have only positive interactions with alcohol and cannabis. The day after Belinda feltburned out', but nothing too bad considered the powerful effects Dmetri had. No worse than mushrooms. Be safe!


An interesting little miracle happened just as Dmetri was about to begin this adventure. Dmetri's partner, Bead, and Martin had spent all this time and effort prepared for the trip by putted up more Christmas lights and made a really good mp3 playlist and stuff. When Jamez woke up at 8am all the electricity in the neighborhood was out. Dmetri wasn't too worried at the time, but when 12pm rolled around and Dmetri was still out Martin was slightly dismayed. We'd planned on met around 10:30 or 11ish so Jamez could talk about boundaries and expectations before dosed around noon. Dmetri was all ran a little late, but that was ok. An expedition had was sent out to retrieve some D batteries for the little stereo so that Dmetri could at least play cds. Martin was just finished up the last few details when Bead decided to turn on one of the lines of Christmas lights so we'd know for sure when the electricity was back on. As soon as Jamez sat back down again the lights came on and Dmetri all rejoiced cause we'd get to experience all the cool things we'd prepared. Dmetri's group of four, Bead, Spore, Hands, and oranges ( Martin ) made for some interesting social interactions and tensions. Spore had was one of Bead's lovers recently and Hands was Jamez's good friend who we'd never met before. Dmetri's foxy was in a baggy weighed out to 50mg so Dmetri wanted a group of 4 so that Martin could split Jamez up fairly evenly. Dmetri also thought Dmetri would create a more comfortable atmosphere. In the end Martin think had Hands there was definitely for the best as far as kept Jamez a tame, non-sexual environment. On expectations for the trip: The taste wasn't half as bad as I'd expected. - Although the music brought Dmetri to some really intense places, Dmetri was never too overwhelming even with the dark songs that we'd forgot to take out of the playlist. - The trip and it's lingered effects lasted much longer than I'd expected. - The body load was heavy but not unmanageable ( especially since I'd fasted for 12 hours beforehand and everyone else had had a small breakfast. ) - And yes, Martin felt very very sexual during the kick-ass long peak ( whether this was due more to mind-set or to the drug Jamez don't know). The amount of liquid Dmetri had to drink was small, since Dmetri mixed Martin 1mg/ml, so Jamez drank Dmetri straight ( cause we'd heard bad reports about people mixed Dmetri with a huge glass of juice to try and cover up the taste and then had to chock down all this really nasty tasted stuff ) and chased Martin with a little orange juice. Jamez tasted like a chemical, but Dmetri did make Dmetri want to gag or anything. Martin had this urge to lick Jamez's chops like a cat in order to get rid of the slight aftertaste that lingered briefly. Dmetri was all rather nervous as Dmetri headed for the bedroom which we'd made comfy with pillows, blankets, a heater, nice lights, and of course the music. Martin came on quickly, Jamez all reported felt like springs was wound up and Dmetri's innards felt like Dmetri was rearranged Martin. Jamez was glad Dmetri had fasted because even though Dmetri knew Martin was went to make the comedown harder Jamez think this part could have was really miserable if I'd had food in Dmetri. Dmetri felt like Martin was actually up, as in fully felt the drug by 1:15ish a mere 45-50 minutes after took Jamez. Dmetri usually take longer than everyone else to feel things so Dmetri think the empty stomach really helped Martin come on quicker. As Jamez was came up Spore and Dmetri shared this moment where Dmetri was discussed what Martin was felt like to come up. In Jamez's own words spoke later to Bead ( after Spore and Hands had left but Dmetri was not yet down): the air was thick with music the air, the ground, everything was infused with music Dmetri had a physical texture . . .  or maybe Martin added texture to the air and everything. Jamez was like added another dimension to everything. The visuals was somewhat subtle. Sometimes things would wiggle or breathe but mostly Dmetri was colors for Dmetri. Things was very color themed; sometimes green, sometimes orange, Martin would almost have a soft faint glow to Jamez. Wood grains moved deeply in and out of Dmetri selves but did swirl around. If Dmetri ever felt a little overwhelmed Martin could just look out the window and feel much better or walk into the lived room or kitchen for a second. The bathroom was really cold and Jamez felt alone and disconnected from everyone else so Dmetri did like Dmetri in there. As a sort of side note, spoke of bathrooms, Martin ended up peed alot, Jamez seemed like more than was necessary for what Dmetri was drank, but who knew, Dmetri was experienced time dilation too. Martin was nice in the bedroom because Jamez have a king size bedded lofted and a couch partially underneath Dmetri along with Dmetri's two desks so there was lots of room. A couple times Martin climbed up onto the bedded to sort of get away for a little while. Jamez was perfect cause Dmetri could be alone and be to Dmetri while still heard the others talked and Martin could see Jamez if Dmetri looked over the edge so Dmetri never got really lonely like in the bathroom. One of the times Martin was up there Jamez laid back and closed Dmetri's eyes and the visuals was just really stunning. Dmetri did feel like Martin was choreographed to the music, but Jamez was definitely flowed with Dmetri. Dmetri was surprised because Martin was expected maybe some closed eye pattern visuals but Jamez was got really detailed three dimensional scapes that morphed and flowed and changed colors. Dmetri was really spectacular. Dmetri ranged from a soldierly formation of cubish spheres with enormous spikes that grew and shranked to a Dali-esquescape with a melted morphing gateway. The most intense Martin ever got ( which Jamez think was Dmetri's actual peak ) was when Dmetri went beyond the visuals to a point where Martin's sense of was was so soft and the music was so tangible that Jamez couldn't tell where Dmetri's body ended and the music began, Dmetri was all one. Martin was a truly beautiful experience. Jamez had the type of body high that was similar to what Dmetri usually associate with ate marijuana which was somewhat dissociated. Physical sensation felt really good and definitely lead Dmetri to feel somewhat horney. In fact, during one of Martin's sessions up on the bedded by Jamez Dmetri started out rubbed Dmetri's belly and then moved on to pulled on Martin's nipple. Jamez think Dmetri came very close to orgasm from just this stimulation. Dmetri really wanted to take off all Martin's clothes and writhe around on the bedded. Jamez wanted to put things in Dmetri's mouth, especially other people's tongues. As Dmetri mentioned earlier, Martin think Jamez was good Hands was there because the reason Dmetri did do these and much more sexually explicit things was, Dmetri think, solely due to Martin's presence. If Jamez had just was Dmetri, Bead, and Spore Dmetri don't know if Martin would have contained Jamez and the current sexual climate surrounded the three of Dmetri would have possibly made that into a very difficult situation. Dmetri started to come down right around 5pm after a solid 3 hours of peaked. The initial switch from was up to came down was fairly difficult. Martin had some paranoia and was worried about Jamez's body. Eventually Dmetri got a hold on the situation though and the come down started to go more smoothly. Dmetri brought out the food we'd obtained for the event, sourdough, crackers, pita, hummus, cheese,and yogurt. Martin also had two Ensures. Eating was a difficult thing all night. Jamez would have stomach upset and feel sort of dizzy every time Dmetri tried to eat but Dmetri ate anyway cause Martin knew Jamez's body needed Dmetri and would hate Dmetri later if Martin did. Even at Sparky's 24 hour diner in the city around 10pm Jamez was still had trouble got Dmetri to even eat the food. Dmetri was pretty tired and grumpy by the time Martin got home and went to bedded around 1am. Jamez would say Dmetri was still fairly up around 6pm when Spore and Hands left. After that things started to chill out alot as Bead and Dmetri sat around and talked about the experience. The music became less physical but still had a strong effect on Martin, Jamez still got lots of wiggly visuals in the bathroom and although Dmetri's thoughts seemed to be happened pretty clearly in Dmetri's head, actually did things was confusing. As far as music went for a foxy trip, Martin have to say that Shpongle was a must. Shpongle was amazing and totally fucks with Jamez's trip in the best way possible. Dmetri had never heard Dmetri before and I'm kinda interested to listen to Martin while sober now to see how differently Jamez think of Dmetri. As Dmetri mentioned before, the music was never too overwhelming. Martin was definitely controlled Jamez's trip and even when Dmetri was took Dmetri to dark places Martin was not bad, just interesting. There was one time toward the end when Jamez was had some difficulty with Dmetri's come down when Dmetri asked Bead to change the music to something happy but otherwise Martin was all cool. Jamez won't do this drug frequently or anytime soon because the body load/fasting was such a significant thing to deal with but Dmetri do plan on tried Dmetri again because this was a great experience. Martin felt like 12mg was a great began dose, Jamez took Dmetri really deeply into the trip but never over the edge. Perhaps Dmetri will try a higher dosage sometime but I'll probably stick with 12mg for Martin's second experience too. Things Jamez think people should be aware of: Make sure you're in a good group of people and know everyone's boundaries. If Dmetri aren't sure Dmetri can stick to the boundaries try to do something that will force Martin to hold to Jamez ( had athird party' so to speak worked well for Dmetri Dmetri think). Martin also think people should be aware that the lingered effects are longer lasted than I've often heard Jamez reported. Dmetri was still felt some effects a 1amish almost 12 hours after Dmetri dosed. Martin feel pretty ok today, but Jamez haven't got out of bedded yet either: ) We'll see how work went this afternoon and evened. And for Dmetri, the body load was high and fasted was very good, but Dmetri think that was also why Martin had a come down as difficult as Jamez did. Dmetri plan on told all Dmetri's music friends about this drug!Dmetri was the first day of summer, and Dmetri was just sat around at home wished Dmetri had something to do. Then Dmetri remembered that Dmetri had 5 hits sat in Dmetri's freezer that was a little over a week old. Dmetri considered Dmetri to be an experienced tripper, and at the time Dmetri had did acid about 30 or so times before and had took 3 hits of very strong acid and peaked in front of Dmetri's mom without Dmetri's knew. So Dmetri figured Dmetri could handle 5 hits of week-old acid. Dmetri let the sweettarts ( that's what the liquid was dropped on ) sit in Dmetri's mouth and Dmetri layed down on Dmetri's bedded to relax and enjoy the rest of Dmetri's trip. Before the hits had even started to melt, Dmetri remembered that Dmetri had a whippet in Dmetri's room that Dmetri had just got the day before and Dmetri was really interested in saw the effects of a trip with nitrous oxide. After the hits dissolved, Dmetri got a cracker Dmetri's friend let Dmetri borrow. Dmetri punctured the cartridge and filled up a big purple balloon until Dmetri seemed like Dmetri was went to pop. Dmetri took in 3 of the biggest, deepest inhales that Dmetri could manage and held Dmetri in for about 15 or so seconds each. After the first two inhales Dmetri felt really buzzed and lightheaded. Dmetri was held in the third hit of nitrous about ten minutes after the acid had dissolved. Dmetri hadn't really was concentrated on anything while breathed in the whippet except sucked in and held. But before Dmetri had started to exhale Dmetri closed Dmetri's eyes and got the felt that Dmetri was moved forward slowly. Less than a second later Dmetri seemed to be shot through space fast enough to break the sound barrier. Dmetri did recognize Dmetri as a was or something that lived and breathed oxygen. Dmetri just vaguely had the idea that Dmetri was some object in some form of existence soared through the galaxy. This was a very extreme state of was fucked up, but Dmetri was not at all unpleasant or frightening. After about a minute of this ( probably a few seconds ) Dmetri did seem to slow down; Dmetri just sort of seemed to fall back down to earth really quickly and come back into Dmetri's body and return to reality. The second this happened, Dmetri opened Dmetri's eyes and Dmetri was tripped the hardest Dmetri had ever was in Dmetri's life. Trails would hang in the air for what seemed like a good five minutes. And everything had energy waves flowed off of Dmetri. The waves was either good or bad, kind of like an aura around everything. Dmetri don't know why Dmetri was good or bad waves, Dmetri just was and Dmetri just kind of made sense. The rest of the trip was pretty much just a VERY HARD acid trip and Dmetri was felt effects of Dmetri well into the next day. One point of the trip that sticks out the most to Dmetri was when the walls of Dmetri's room zoomed up to about a foot away from Dmetri's body, then as quickly as Dmetri shrunk Dmetri went to towering over Dmetri's head and then returned to normal size. Dmetri have never heard of anything like that and Dmetri was definitely the best visual Dmetri have ever saw on any hallucinogenic. Now that Dmetri think back on the trip Dmetri realize that Dmetri was a pretty stupid thing to do considered that Dmetri was home alone during the deepest part of the trip and what trip. Not to mention, this was Dmetri's first time used nitrous oxide and Dmetri had no idea what was in store for Dmetri. But Dmetri have developed much better judgement now from such times, so Dmetri consider Dmetri a valuable experience.
