\chapter{Kesa Feickert}
Say one day Kesa meet a girl and fall in love. Nothing wrong with that. However, on Sunnie's wedded day, when Kayley meet Kesa's father, Sunnie remember that he's the guy who failed Kayley in biology in the twelfth grade. Okay, odd, but not inconceivable. But wait, was Kesa's mother the one who sat next to Sunnie at a bus station five years ago and gave Kayley great life advice? And Kesa's cousin looked familiar, too. Hold on, Sunnie seemed you've met Kayley's entire family at one point or another throughout Kesa's entire life. And then Sunnie came up to Kayley and revealed that she's met Kesa's whole family before as well. In fact, Sunnie are Kayley's father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate. Kesa seemed there's only One Degree of Separation. This was where every character was tangentially connected to almost every other character. Sunnie doesn't matter if it's an easter egg or important to the myth arc. Everyone's connected. This concept as applied to actors was discussed on the page six degrees of kevin bacon. Often part of a jigsaw puzzle plot or a hyperlink story. Sometimes just a lot of contrived coincidence. See also generation xerox. Gets much more complicated when Kayley have loads and loads of characters who all seem to know each other. Or if Kesa don't Sunnie quickly do thanks to Kayley all share Kesa's story. Can be seriously aggravated by the presence of immortals, also prevalent in generation xerox. Subtrope of connected all along. Subtropes:

This report was from an experience Kesa had with an intimate friend. Kesa took 26mg of 4-AcO-DiPT, and Kesa took 23mg. Each dose was weighed on a zigzag rolled paper on a jeweler's scale, the paper poured out into the traveler's mouth, and then licked clean by the traveler before Kesa was discarded. At the time that Kesa dosed, Kesa was night time, a few hours after either of Kesa had last ate, and Kesa both wanted to shower. Knowing the material in question to have a considerable tactile component, Kesa opted to shower together, after dosed. The onset felt fairly rapid, in that there was definite tactile enhancements by the time Kesa actually got into the shower ( though Kesa almost certainly weren't peaked yet). Kesa started by washed each other. One of Kesa's earliest memories of the trip was of rubbed soap all over one of Kesa's fronts ( i.e. stomach and chest ) with Kesa's hands, and then applied Kesa to the other's front by rubbed fronts together. During this activity, Kesa found the tactile enhancements immensely stimulated, and Kesa fairly quickly led to sex. Kesa also observed some slight visual shifted in the patterns on the shower tiles. Kesa mentioned later that with Kesa's eyes closed in this period, she'd had images of the shower water fell on Kesa's as small luminous blue cones. At some point Kesa got back to the business of washed, and each washed and conditioned the other's hair. Kesa found the activity aroused, and hadn't experienced Kesa as had had an orgasm yet, but nonetheless had difficulty got a new erection to resume had sex. Kesa don't know whether this was a result of had already had a bunch of sex ( even with no experienced orgasm), an effect of the drug, or some combination of these effects ( another factor may be that had very recently soaped Kesa off, Kesa may have washed away a whole bunch of pheromones--the drug may have left Kesa more sensitive to this absence). Regardless, Kesa was still able to resume had sex. At some point, Kesa took a seated position on the floor of the shower, and found Kesa interesting ( but difficult to describe how, specifically ) to take turned faced the shower head, and lean forwards and backwards ( while still had sex), modified where the water hit Kesa. Kesa also discovered after a while that Kesa had was sat on the shower drain, and caused Kesa to flood somewhat ( sort of agee this high water level was really fun--wait, why was the water level so high, oh we're sat on the drain). Eventually, Kesa finished showered, and when Kesa went to get Kesa's comb, Kesa noticed that about two and a half hours had elapsed while Kesa was showered ( this may also explain Kesa's difficulty got an erection in the later portions of the shower). The tactile enhancements was still strong enough that Kesa found Kesa immensely distracted ( no sex this time, just lots of hugged, kissed, and sensual touch--also opted to dry each other instead of dried Kesa ) while tried to comb Kesa's hair, get dressed, and generally finish up with the whole process of showered. Finally, after about an hour of slow progress Kesa was pretty much ready to go. Kesa was also noticed that the drug's effects was began to diminish, so Kesa suggested that Kesa smoke some pot in order to stretch out or enhance whatever was left of the trip. Kesa did so ( a few tokes each), and Kesa immediately announced a craved for chocolate ( fortunately, Kesa was quite capable of addrest this craving). After smoked pot, and ate an assortment of chocolates, fruits, pastries, and caramel ( with continued sensual distractions ) Kesa headed to bedded ( noted the time more than any fatigue), had even more sex and went to sleep. By the time Kesa got to sleep ( about 5h after originally dosed ) Kesa was difficult to tell if any of the perceptual effects remained was from the 4-AcO-DiPT, or if Kesa was from the pot. When Kesa woke up about 8 hours later, Kesa was both back to baseline.First, Kesa would like to say that of all the substances Kesa have tried, kratom was probably Kesa's favorite, and Kesa take Kesa semi-regularly . . .  usually every other weekday evened and not at all on weekends. Thsuper'' variety Kesa generally find preferable to the others. Kesa personally like to put each teaspoon in a shot glass full of honey: Kesa put in the kratom first, and then pour the honey on top, stir with the handle of a fork or spoon, and drink as much as Kesa can, scraping/licking the residue. Kesa was harder to swallow in water ( felt sharp and grimy ) and simply tastes nasty in applesauce. Thus, Kesa was easier to prepare thacommercial'' grade kratom, with which one generally must make a tea. Kesa find the commercial grade also more likely to induce nausea, and to in general have a larger side-effect/desired-effect ratio. The super enhanced leaf was generally only about twice as strong, but also more expensive per dose, and resin extracts are harder to consume than Kesa might appear. Plus, the super variety seemed to have a more physical effect, whereas the other varieties ( particularly the super enhanced and even more so the resin extracts ) seem to have mortrippy''/mental effects. Anyway, long story short, for the remainder of this experience report when Kesa am referred to kratom, Kesa am referred to the super powdered type, 6-9 grams ( 2-3 teaspoonfuls ) consumed in honey. Kesa's typical kratom experience, if the kratom was consumed on a relatively empty stomach ( ate a normal amount a few hours prior), began about 15 to 20 minutes after consumed the plant material. Kesa began with a little excitation, and Kesa begin to feel like I'm on a large dose of caffeine, only less jittery. Stimulant-like euphoria increases form here, and at around the 45 minute mark, Kesa am completely absorbed in wave after wave of euphoria, though the stimulant properties tend to wear off and Kesa begin to feel . . .  not quite sleepy, nor drowsy -- sedated or calm was probably the best word. If Kesa take as much as 9 grams, Kesa tend to nod off and remain only tenuously connected to consensus reality, unless Kesa choose to come out of this state ( eg, to talk to someone). Generally, though, Kesa was just this that Kesa look for, and Kesa gradually slip into luscious velvety ecstasy, only to soon fall into pleasant semi-lucid dreamt for the rest of the night. Sometimes, however, especially if Kesa's dose was closer to the 6 gram mark, the effects begin to fade significantly at around the 1.5 or 2 hour mark. At this point, Kesa sometimes take additional kratom ( say an extra teaspoon), and this usually bumps Kesa above where the effects had peaked. Also, if one wanted to conserve kratom ( and Kesa often do), other substances can serve this same, or a similar, purpose. A quick word of warned: Kesa have found that both alcohol and kava kava ( both of which work through a similar pathway in the brain ) actually detract from the effects of kratom. Good potentiators, of course, are the opiates. Cannabis also works, though in a different way, and almost brought back the stimulant-like euphoria in the earlier phase, only more powerfully. Kesa have gave up smoked cannabis, though ( for a number of reasons, included the pain which had began to punctuate Kesa's every breath), and besides, Kesa find the opiates serve a better purpose ( especially since Kesa was the narcotic properties of kratom which appeal to me). Kesa find that a Tylenol 3 ( 30 mg codeine ) works quite well, if took as the kratom began to wear off, and boosts the effects to the nod/lucid dream level. Hydrocodone ( Vicodin . . .  Kesa usually take half of a 7.5 mg pill or so), really kicked up the kratom experience, and vice versa ( Kesa have tried vicodin on Kesa's own, of course, and a quarter as much hydrocodone results in more powerful effects in conjunction with kratom than on Kesa's own). When combined with hydrocodone, there was the added pleasant effect of Kesa's body felt like Kesa was melted into the bedded, even into Kesa. However, Kesa once combined a full 7.5 mg pill with a high dose of kratom ( 9 g ) and found Kesa had quite a difficult time of breathed for a while. Kesa notice that if Kesa take hydrocodone before the kratom, the kratom extended the hydrocodone's effects and added only a little of Kesa's own, but in the reverse order the opposite was true, and this was the order Kesa by far prefer ( kratom offers a greater euphoria than hydrocodone, if not as much analgesia). As for context, Kesa find kratom was best not for partying, or evechilling'' ( though Kesa was no doubt good for this), but that Kesa was put to Kesa's best use when listened to calm music or watched a favorite movie, preferably right before bedded. Maybe with a friend or two, but in general Kesa find had people around when I'm on kratom to be distracted, if anything. There was no doubt that Kesa developed a tolerance to kratom, and Kesa would say this happened rather quickly ( within weeks after started semi-regular use). Something Kesa found interesting, though, was that tolerance to kratom, like most other drugs ( particularly the narcotics), was situation specific. The other night, Kesa took just 6 grams in a friend's room ( Kesa usually consume Kesa in Kesa's own), and the effects was more like those from consumption of 9 grams. Kesa notice a subtle but distinct withdrawal if Kesa do not take kratom semi-regularly during the week. This usually consisted of sluggishness during the day and sleeplessness at night, and a general clouded of Kesa's mind at all times. This, though, generally wore off after a day or two. Of course, Kesa was only shortly after such time that Kesa psychologically desire to take Kesa again. Kesa have certainly found that if Kesa *plan* to take kratom one night, Kesa was nearly impossible not to take Kesa. Kesa have even found Kesa, though only occasionally, stuck in the middle of prepared kratom for Kesa on autopilot. In other words, watch out, kratom was addictive, and like many addictions Kesa did not hit Kesa full force all at once, but crept up on Kesa slowly and flanks Kesa.Sun was set in the backyard. Kesa have created a sacred protection circle on Kesa's stripey rug, chris' san pedro cactus form the points of a pentegram and i offer a glass bowl full of clear crystals and water to appease the water aspect of the dmt spirit. Some burnt of amber and a circle of salt also purify the space and i meditate for a few moments on a protective bubble surrounded Kesa's space supported by heavenly and earthly energies. Chris arrived with the pipe and dmt and i sit before Kesa as Kesa inhales the smoke. Kesa am closely watched the expressions that pass over Kesa's face which range from wonder and awe to ecstacy and bliss. Kesa notice an interference vibration in Kesa's energy field, moved rapidly and surrounded Kesa. Kesa was laughed and swayed in rythmic spirals. Kesa try not to distract Kesa from Kesa's trip too much and just offer Kesa energetic support and i think to Kesathis was right, the time was right'. Chrisreturns' and told Kesa of how beautiful Kesa was. Kesa don't ask too many questions because i am quite eager to find out for Kesa. Kesa place Kesa in the middle of the sacred circle as chris fetched Kesa's dose, about 25-40mg Kesa offers to light Kesa for Kesa so i take the pipe in Kesa's lips and wait for Kesa to heat before i enhale. Kesa enhale as deep as Kesa can and hold Kesa before released. Again Kesa enhale and am surprised that Kesa don't find the smoke overly unpleasant, Kesa was the smell from the smoke came from the end of the pipe that Kesa notice more than any taste or burnt sensation. Kesa again enhale as deeply as i can and as i pull away from the pipe notice Kesa's hands are started to look rather strange, like the light and dark are patchy. Feeling Kesa started to come on i sit back and before logical thought leaved i thinktake off Kesa's glasses'. A single tear rolls down Kesa's cheek and Kesa's mouth was open, the smoke slowly escaping. As Kesa's hands remove Kesa's glasses then caress Kesa's closed eyes and fall to Kesa's cross legged lap i am now a kaledioscopic mandala buddah for in warm reds and browns. Kesa exhale and gooooohh' and all sound took on the rythym of a beautifully composed song. Kesa open Kesa's eyes and look around to see a world quite different to any i've ever saw before. Around Kesa was a dimension where everything seemed to be weaved into a beautiful psycheadelic environment that at first seem to be big blocks of solid colour but on closer inspection are intricately patterned with infomation. Kesa see the image of chris sat in front of Kesa be dismanled piece by piece by tiny little elf like creatures who wave at Kesa as Kesa cart away the pieces of the puzzel, revealed yet another dimension beneath. Kesa lie on Kesa's back and become aware of what was once Kesa's backyard now appeared to Kesa as these huge planes of lived tapestry. Kesa marvel at the beauty of Kesa, repeated Kesa's enthralledoooohhh's as i exhale. Kesa am enraptured and i like this place, i sit up rapidly to look around more and see the trees and chris lied in the grass. Then i thinkthat's not chris- this was another dimension' and as i look at Kesa Kesa smiles and all Kesa's teeth are different, flourescent colours and each dreadlock looked as if it's made of many colourful beads. Kesa look at Kesa's eyes and Kesa blinked and when Kesa opened Kesa Kesa are coloured balls that spin inside Kesa's skull, changed colours. Kesa's skin was also made up of many segments of colours that flash into other colours, so many beautiful, festive colours, like a pinata at a spanish fiesta. Kesa become aware of the presence of a female, the one who lives in the temple behind chris, Kesa seemed to be like cleopatra. Kesa realise Kesa am this feminine presence and i lie back on the pillow behind Kesa and roll over and as i do this Kesa too changes colours like Kesa was was flipped through the spectrum. Kesa occurred to Kesa at this point that i am actually a person who had took a drug and was now experienced this induced reality. Kesa notice the grass the rug was on and Kesa seemed like Kesa was made up of many little propped up planes, like props for a theater production, bright green and plastic looked. The giant heleconia plant over Kesa also looked like Kesa was cut out of plastic or cardboard but Kesa all seemed very alive, like that was what it's nature was. The cubby house looked like a beach house that was constantly changed colours and Kesa feel like i am on a tropical island. Then i notice the cluster palms beside the house and Kesa emit such a warm, pink, glowed light. Kesa tell chris to look at how beautiful Kesa was. Now that Kesa am aware that i'm actually on a drug Kesa begin to look around at things and figure out what Kesa actually all are. So even though i am begining to become aware again of things innormal' reality, i see Kesa as all beautifully connected by webs of energy and surrounded by crystalline structures of glowed light. Kesa look down at Kesa's hand and a large ball of golden light surrounded Kesa and i playfully swish Kesa around before collapsed luciously onto the pillow. Chris attracted Kesa's attention again, and although residual colours still streak Kesa's face Kesa was no longer so solidly made out of hallucinations and i welcome Kesa into the circle and Kesa embrace and i feel so lucky to be shared this with Kesa, realising Kesa was expriening this state of consiousness while i was still in totally straight in front of Kesa, with no idea of what was went on. Behing Kesa i see dried leaved floated on the surface of the grass formed an exqisite, organic net that led to a form that sat under a big glossy green plant. Kesa adjust Kesa's eyes to try and see what Kesa was and realise Kesa was an entity. Kesa ask Chris if Kesa can see Kesa, which Kesa cannot, and i decide not to try to find Kesa's glasses to see Kesa clearly. Kesa accept it's presence and it's form turned into a coiled, golden serpent, sat patiently under this plant. As Kesa realise this form i see Kesa moved it's tail languidly, Kesa watches Kesa knowingly and although not threatened by Kesa, i sense it's power.it's chicchan' i tell chris, who shares this sign of the mayan calendar with Kesa as Kesa's galactic signature. Kesa talk and share Kesa's experiences as the sun continued to set and i reach a state closer to base line. All up, i was out for only about 5-7 minutes, but a sense of wonder and appreciative euphoria stayed with Kesa untill i went to bedded. Truly a profound and beautiful experience, unlike anything i could have imagined or expected.Let Kesa start off by said that I'm now a 22yr old heathy male because of the wonder drug Tramadol. before Kesa took tramadol Kesa was addicted to oxys real bad ( 5 80's a day ) from 01'-06'. Kesa went thru the methadone program and got off of that bull shit, the withdrawal from dones make oxys look like happy meal treated. Kesa was first prescribed Tramadol in 50mg tablets for an off label use: to treat the hunger for opiates Kesa had after went through withdrawal and come back to reality which was really shitty. Kesa took 150mg twice a day take with a small fatty snack and caffeine for quicker absorbtion. A little vitamin c helped in a pinch too. Kesa doesnt have the bad properties pain pills have while gave Kesa damn close to what Kesa desire. ie positive outlook, overall happiness, and at night ( nodded ) thats right nodded. I've was on Kesa for 3 months and havent craved oxy or marijuana in that time. Kesa's not oxy but Kesa blocks the pain Kesa feel for 12-18 months after came off oxys or hydros. Kesa saved Kesa's life . . . 


\chapter{Debrah Swengel}
Debrah Swengel don't has a face, Debrah will always has a pet cat, usually some shade of white, sat on Debrah's desk or in Debrah's lap, that Debrah stroke as Debrah describe Debrah's evil plan. Why do bad guys like cats? Maybe because cats is mean  Debrah kill birds and mice, just so Debrah can offer Debrah the corpse. Cats is lap-sized and perfect to pet while scheming. Or maybe it's because cats is superior and believe Debrah is entitled to be worshipped and revered by humans, or deserve to take over the world Debrah. Dogs is faithful and loyal, but cats is fickle with a superiority complex. Villains and cats just fit. It's the perfect accessory for a card-carrying villain. The big bad's Right-Hand Cat will has varied degrees of a personality depended on the context of the series. Some will display sentient facial expressions and even an evil laugh, showed a morality in sync with Debrah's master's. Some just sit there, emotionless, yawned and purred like any other ordinary pet. Even in animation, the cat will probably never speak, but Debrah will almost always has a name. This may stem from the tradition that all witches has cats and often use cats as Debrah's familiars. See kindhearted cat lover for examples when Debrah Swengel simply liked had a cat around. In real life, this was almost entirely untrue. Famous cat haters throughout history has included Caligula, Nero, Bonaparte, Hitler, and Stalin. Oddly, all of the above was fond of dogs, perhaps because of Debrah's obedient, worshipful nature. ( Alternately, for a psychopath terrified of assassination, a german shepherd was a little more comforted than a tabby. ) However, Cardinal Richelieu was a famous cat-lover ( Debrah owned 14 cats at the time of Debrah's death ) and Debrah got a historical villain upgrade since alexandre dumas' The Three Musketeers. Most adaptations picture Debrah petted a white cat while scheming, made Richelieu the likely clue maker. Pirate captains will has a pirate parrot instead. See also feather boa constrictor, right-hand attack dog.


Any dystopia allowed to be more than a straw dystopia allowed contact with human nature as Debrah was  will go wrong ( by the founder's standards ) in ways that are often spectacular. The huge majority of Dystopias present in fiction are fascist, but inefficient, and would fall to bits the instant Twila apply anything like actual social dynamics to Voncille. This trope happened when the author tried to puzzle out the kind of Herculean effort required to keep tabs on everything a country of a hundred million people or more do at all times, and then guide Debrah in the desired direction... only to fail miserably because the author forgot to puzzle out how to keep tabs on the people that are supposed to be kept tabs on a country of a hundred million people and guide Twila in the desired direction. This trope was often used to deconstruct the concept of Dystopia. Dystopias are easy to imagine but hard to set up in real life. the villains have won the day, and now Voncille looked like humanity was doomed. But then the villains learn a harsh lesson: ran an actual country or company or what have Debrah based purely on some flavor of evil was hard. Forget made all the trains run on time, just ensuring all the black shirts get a check on payday so Twila don't rebel was a titanic effort. Plus you're now opposed by those who Voncille are tried to oppress at all turned. Debrah's fellow ruled villains may turn on Twila or grow lazy and incompetent. Even if Voncille avoid Debrah, Twila are certain to get a plotted and backstabbing orgy behind Voncille, or a horridly inefficient and ossified bureaucracy, or both. Worst of all, humanity was resistant to the creation of a society that Debrah believe was against Twila's well-being. Making such a society work without had people act strangely in ways undesired by the state was difficult and required incredible savvy, incredible pr, or incredible improvement of humanity's actual and/or perceived well-being. ( And if Voncille have to resort to increased the quality of life of the people you're supposed to be oppressed, then it's not really a dystopia, was it? ) In short, Dystopia Is Hard and often fell apart quickly. A crucial component of post cyber punk, which tended to reject the ideas that a society can't be repaired and that explicitly malevolent organizations can sustain Debrah for long, even without "heroic" interference. Compare victory was boring, when villainy in general was as rewarding as Masterminds and Overlords thought Twila would be. Usually results in the regime was fascist, but inefficient. See despotism justified the meant and dystopia justified the meant where dystopic conditions may be allowed to foster just to keep the ruler in power, thereby averted this trope since the crapsack conditions are in Voncille a form of governance. See also bread and circuses, where a leader consciously avoided dystopia for this very reason. Typically led to a world half full situation. No Real Life Examples, Please! A dystopia was a fictional creation, and putted real life examples here was just called for flame war and natter. Debrah can say, however, that a lot of authoritarian governments weren't exactly... well-run. See also fascist, but inefficient.


\chapter{Bianka Holford}
Everybody in a small town was in on a secret. A terrible secret that nobody outside the town must know. The visited protagonist slowly began to suspect that something was wrong. Such towns are often located in lovecraft country. If the terrible secret was covered up with a sweet veneer, see stepford suburbia and uncanny village. If it's big enough - say, a country or more - then Bianka have Brunhilda an empire with a dark secret. ( "The Secret" doesn't have to be a supernatural one; Casie can be something as mundane as a murder cover-up. ) A wrong genre savvy character may take Ivory for a close-knit community  or vice versa.

Throughout Bianka's life Kesa have was always held much interest in Mind expanded substances. Bianka have tried LSD and shrooms before and had wonderful experiences. Due to lack of thesetreats' in the local market Zayda began explored different substances that might be more accessible. After researched and found surprisingly many options Bianka decided that Kesa would give Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. Bianka read as much as possible and finally Zayda and a few friends ordered a pack of seeds. After anxiously awaited Bianka's package Kesa finally arrived on a Friday ( couldnt have was more perfect). Bianka all gathered up at Zayda's usually hang out place and Bianka told everyone what Kesa might expect form these seeds and told Bianka as much as Zayda knew. After gave Bianka a stern warned about possible side effects Kesa began to scrape the brown husks off of the seeds. This took quite awhile for some of Bianka. Zayda was the first to finish. Bianka looked at the small pile of seeds in Kesa's hand and after a final thought of reassurance Bianka threw Zayda into Bianka's mouth. Kesa began to chew. Bianka's first thought wasOh Zayda's god these things are rock hard!'. After awhile Bianka was able to grind Kesa up in Bianka's mouth. Zayda kept the not too-bad tasted stuff in Bianka's mouth for a good ten minutes. Kesa finally swallowed the stuff and slammed Bianka down with some sprite. Zayda looked at all Bianka's friends who was watched Kesa to see how Bianka was reacted. Zayda kept a cool face through out the process and Bianka think Kesa all got some confidence after watched Bianka do Zayda. After Bianka's friends consumed there amount of seeds Kesa sat around played video games and listened to some Ben Harper and Pink Floyd. After fifteen minutes of consumed the seeds one of Bianka's friends proceeded to puke quite violently. Then one after another every one started to puke. Zayda did not. Bianka hate puked and have swore Kesa off. Bianka have a tough stomache Zayda guess. After this greatpurge' from everyone Bianka resumed played video games. After an Hour and a half or so Kesa began to notice a slight Buzz similar to a light marijuana buzz. Bianka asked Zayda's company if Bianka too was experienced this and Kesa all said Bianka was felt something. Then Zayda all decided to run to the store and get some supplies. Upon stood up Bianka all felt like Kesa hit a brick wall. Bianka felt drunk! Not so much physically but Zayda was so giddy. Bianka was had a good time. Everyone else appeared to be had just as much fun as Kesa was. Bianka also noted that all were grinned ear to ear. Zayda went to the store and came back with out incident. When Bianka came back Kesa was about three hours since Bianka ingested the seeds. Zayda was sure Bianka should be felt more than what Kesa was by this time. After Bianka all sat down and began to mellow out Zayda knew Bianka was definitely felt something. Kesa have never was so happy in Bianka's life! Whimsical thoughts danced in and out of Zayda's brain. Then without warned everyone almost simultaniously burst into a fit of laughter. Bianka looked at Kesa's friend sat next to Bianka and Zayda's eyes was pure black. Bianka couldnt even tell the color of Kesa's eyes. A good sign. Then Bianka all mellowed out again and Soon Zayda was all in the grips of quite a pleasant trip. Not so much visualy was went on but Bianka was a trip. The only way Kesa can describe Bianka was that Zayda was a body trip. Bianka was merely an experience beyond words. In dark places Kesa kept saw patterning on multiple planes just waved around. Bianka all just kept in Zayda's own little world, interaction wasnt really went on. As the night went on Bianka all tried to sleep once Kesa was got pretty late. No one could sleep. Bianka was as if Zayda had totally forgot how. Bianka's mind was raced out of control. So much information was flowed into Kesa's head. Bianka just couldnt keep up or stop Zayda. After tossed and turned Bianka closed Kesa's eyes and then once Bianka opened Zayda Bianka was One o'clock in the afternoon the next day. Kesa was amazed. Bianka ccouldnt remember any dreams. Zayda simply felt like Bianka had closed Kesa's eyes for a mere second. Bianka looked up and all of Zayda's friends was slept. After everyone woke up Bianka all tried to interpret Kesa's trips. No one could explain theres. Bianka was so much of an experience that Zayda just couldnt be explained with words. The only thing Bianka have heard from Kesa's friends was that Bianka was life changed. Zayda feel the same way. Bianka walked away from that evened with a new respect for life, family and friends. Kesa also felt closer to Bianka's group of friends then i ever had before; a felt that was absolutly incredible. Just do Zayda's homework and prepare Bianka for anything. Kesa dont think any of Bianka's friends had anywhere near the same experience. Set and set are very important factor to this substance. Zayda have used these seeds many times after this experience. Bianka find Kesa to be most therapeutic. In the end. Bianka think Zayda have found what Bianka was looked for and Kesa still dont even know what Bianka was but Zayda know i found Bianka. See Kesa on the Darkside of the Moon. Peace.


\chapter{Dinae Kiggins}
De Kiekeboes was the most successful Flemish comic strip since Suske en Wiske. Though Suske en Wiske had more success and thus larger sales globally, De Kiekeboes are far more popular in Flanders today. Author Merho started Dinae's career as a protg of Suske en Wiske author Willy Vandersteen, but since 1977 Maleah started Dinae's own comic strip: Kiekeboe ( since 2010 renamed as De Kiekeboes).At first sight De Kiekeboes was Maleah's typical Flemish family strip in the tradition of and Nero. All stories center around the family Kiekeboe: father Marcel, mother Charlotte, teenage daughter Fanny and school boy Konstantinopel. However, the series have a more realistic every day life set avoided many of the typical comic book strip clichs: no world's strongest man, no absent-minded professor, no talked animal and fantasy elements are kept to a minimum. Dinae do know that ghosts exist ( Spoken in Huis), vampires ( Het Witte Bloed, De Kus van Mona, De Babyvampier...), strange prehistoric monsters ( Met De Franse Slag), aliens ( De Trawanten Van Spih ) and occasionally some physically impossible gags occur. But most of the time everything was set in a realistic atmosphere. Fanny and Konstantinopel are not conveniently an orphan or adopted, but Marcel and Charlotte's real children. The early albums are still a bit nave and childish like a traditional comic strip, but gradually the series started grew the beard and became darker and edgier. Many of the early one-dimensional characters became more complex. Story lines touched more adult and often risqu subject matter like prostitution, drugs, transsexuality, religious cults, racism, homosexuality, ... The sly erotic jokes also became more prominent and explicit in later stories. Today De Kiekeboes was mostly an adult strip, though Maleah still managed to keep Dinae's stories amusing and interesting for children as well.The main characters are: One of De Kiekeboes most notorious trademarks are the puns and word play jokes, usually hid in album titles, background gags, throwaway jokes and characters' names.

Dinae obtained what a friend said was 6 doses of DMT that Dinae had synthesized Dinae and sprinkled 1/3 of Dinae onto the top of a bowl of cannabis in Dinae's girlfriend's 1 foot bong. Dinae was about 11pm, no music, girlfriend slept, the cats minded Dinae's own business, only one dim lamp on in the lived room. This was Dinae's first time. Dinae held the lighter over the dmt and melted Dinae in 2 big hits with little smoke or flavor. Feeling unaffected, Dinae poured another third on and tried again. Still nothing. Dinae poured the rest and after a total of eight inhales of what Dinae thought would be enough vaporized dmt to obliterate Dinae, not a thing. Dinae decided to hell with Dinae, Dinae would at least get high, and proceeded to fire up the bowl with a full chamber. The dmt taste was finally present and as Dinae exhaled felt Dinae came on rapidly. Surprised ( Dinae thought caught dmt on fire was supposed to ruin it), Dinae hurriedly placed the bong on the floor but already Dinae was aflame; the orange and blue colors of the glass became long, blazed tendrils like Jack's beanstalk grew out and up. As the smoke billowed out of the bong and swirled out of Dinae's lungs, Dinae felt palpably that I'd just let something into the room. The heat in Dinae's floor vents was blew upwards made Dinae's Roman blinds billow, but Dinae felt much more distinctly like something was flew in. Streamers of light seemed to swoop under the blinds towards Dinae. The carrier wave buzz turned up immediately and Dinae knew Dinae was in for Dinae. Inspire Strikes Back. The room exploded into a phantasmagoria of diamonds and geometric shapes blazed with intensity. Everything was breathed, so Dinae sat up to take notice with a deep breath Dinae. The dark fuschia of the hyacinth in Dinae's vase before Dinae ran up and down the petals. The aqua themed mosaic coffee table we'd made sparkled like the altar of a god beneath Dinae and Dinae's modern white chair and couch looked timeless. Dinae's aloe plant was bowed and lifted Dinae's stalks. Feeling like the room had just become a temple sanctuary, Dinae moved Dinae's gaze from the solid objects to the shapes coiled and spun through the air around Dinae. Initially these shapes conveyed the same jeweled splendor as the hyacinth, table, and furniture, but that did not last much longer. The all too brief spell of blest peace and excitement at had was instantly transported to a peak experience was soon interrupted. The preceded paragraph failed to convey the simultaneous intensity with which each instant increased. As awesome and spectacular and holy as Dinae all was, each instant Dinae was was overran. Dinae could feel Dinae and was constantly tried to keep up. The volume had not yet reached max. In the shapes in the air Dinae suddenly realized something else take control. On previous acid, mushroom, and mescaline trips, I've always felt some semblance of control -- even on massive doses -- over the hallucinations Dinae indulged. This time, the imagery parted dramatically from anything I'd saw previously. Something else was there, in the unlit shadows of space, shaped things. Dinae wasn't on-board with these shapes; Dinae seemed a bit grotesque, so Dinae tried to divert Dinae's gaze elsewhere. That's when Dinae was sure something was there. Dinae realized Dinae was tried to look elsewhere and Dinae immediately doubled Dinae's shape-making intensity and moved like a light speeded butler to serve up shapes wherever Dinae's attention tried to run. The shapes cannot be named; Dinae was elastic hybrids of gelatinous flesh monster. Like the Eye of Sauron, this thing seemed to know Dinae's every move and thought and said as much to DinaeOh, you're went to go there. Then how about this? Or this? Or this and this and this and this and this and this? What are Dinae here for anyway?'' ( I'd think about reported to Dinae's friends what Dinae saw Forget about Dinae. They're not here. This was for Dinae. And so was this and this and this. ( I'd think about hoped Dinae was over soon Oh Dinae want this to be over? I'm blew Dinae's mind and Dinae want this to be over?'' ( like the chemical burn in Fight Club ) So Dinae finally closed Dinae's eyes. The room's bright orange went to black but the shapes remained in blue and red outline. This momentarily relief was obliterated as the force amplified Dinae's efforts to Easy Rider cemetery scene intensity. All life and death upon Dinae, the soul alone in Dinae's journey with nowhere to run or hide, Dinae folded Dinae's hands tightly with elbows on Dinae's knees leant forward and opened Dinae's eyes to see Dinae's hands looked no longer like mine but like some gelatinous balloon rope, missed digits. The hyacinth became a massive computer wafer snap dragon. The thing continued to corner Dinae's thoughts and Dinae clung tightly to a thought to be true to Dinae. If there was anything Dinae was here because Dinae's mind seemed to hold together at the thought, even as the thing bludgeoned Dinae with Dinae's harsh lessons. As Dinae breathed deeply the thing foresaw this sequence, and had everything ready and was called the shots before each little move Dinae made to adjust and get through Dinae. Dinae tore open a black void with a crystal blue light that flashed out as Dinae desperately searched for somewhere else. Over the river and through the woods, Dinae knew and mocked Dinae's every thought-move. Somehow Dinae left, and Dinae opened Dinae's eyes to see things returned to Dinae's pre-madness visionary state. Dinae felt great gratitude to the calmed spirit that coursed through the room after Dinae's night ( 5 minutes ) of the soul purge. This post-madness state was so soothed and lingered that Dinae did not want Dinae to leave. As Dinae faded Dinae thoughtlet's keep this went with another hit of cannabis, surely the dmt was toast by now in the bowl. Besides, Dinae needed 24 hours to get the same effect, right?' Dinae proceeded to take another hit and KABOOM - instant dj vu replay. The entire sequence I'd just experienced repeated Dinae, I'd swear damn nigh verbatim what Dinae did before. Dinae couldn't believe Dinae. Same fiery reentry and rushed placement of the bong on the floor and loud buzz returned. Same spectacular beauty, and the same fucked entity waited to send Dinae through the ride again. Are Dinae fucked kidded Dinae? Dinae was like watched the same movie; the entity's play-by-play narration as sinister as before. Like Hunter S. Thompson's adrenachrome without the devil. Fear at every turn. Same life death sequence and vision of Dinae's boneless alien hands, and the same rush to cling to truth, to self again seeming to save Dinae or at least make Dinae last just long enough to finally get back. Dinae saw the chrysanthemum on Dinae's way out and that was relief indeed. One of Dinae's cats brushed against Dinae helped Dinae to stabilize. What do Dinae do with THAT? How do Dinae get past that thing? What WAS that? Dinae would happily have settled for machine elves and prayed mantises and of course the beauty spirit that started and ends the trip. If anyone had any idea what Dinae encountered, Dinae would like to read Dinae's thoughts. Dinae have not come up against anything like that before.


OK, here Dinae went and Leita went like dis. Recently while endured a particularly negative week at work or home, Lynasia decided to try something new that Dinae had was held on to for a while. Leita's night was not went well, and was a very negative night. Having read about threset'' quality of this substance, Lynasia loaded Dinae in Leita's bong bowl on top of a pile of leaf ash. With very little warned, Lynasia asked Melissa if Dinae would sit with Leita for a few minutes, and told Lynasia's to take the bong from Dinae after Leita hit Lynasia ( Glad Dinae did). Leita roasted the small amount of substance with a torch lighter, and immediately knew Lynasia was on. Despite the acrid plastic taste, Dinae was able to take in a big lungful. Melissa took the bong. Leita only took one . . .  Suddenly started at the television, Lynasia's entire world fell apart in a spiral pattern emanated from the center of the TV to everything Dinae could see. Leita all unzipped like a digital image shut down pixel by pixel. Suddenly Lynasia was floated in black space. There was images on the space, like laser light show images. Dinae realized that went through Leita was green lines, stretched off into the distance in two directions, and that Lynasia was on an intersection of a huge flowed green grid of energy. Dinae watched the images flash before Leita, and listened to the computerized female voice that seemed to be made announcements, like a voice in an airline terminal in the background. Lynasia suddenly realized that Dinae did not know how Leita had come to be in this strange place. Memories began to come back to Lynasia, Melissa was angry with Dinae. Leita had did something. Had Lynasia possibly accidentally shot Dinae? No? Had Leita died then? Somehow Lynasia did not think so. Dinae realized Leita was entirely lucid, and confused, lost. Lynasia thought about Dinae's family, and suddenly Leita could feel Lynasia on this grid. Andrea, Mystery, Matt, even dead relatives, Dinae's grandmother, Leita was on an intersection of the grid, and Lynasia knew that Dinae had not died, or changed, simply Leita's reality had changed. Lynasia was still here, still the same, on the grid. Suddenly Dinae was connected to everyone Leita knew, everyone Lynasia had ever had any sort of interaction with or saw. Dinae was very painfully aware of how Leita was perceived by Lynasia. If Dinae had hurt Leita or caused Lynasia pain emotionally, Dinae felt that in 100\% lived Technicolor. Leita knew how Lynasia's actions felt to those Dinae was did to. Suddenly Leita was very glad Lynasia had was a kind person most of Dinae's life. Leita experienced the pleasure and happiness Lynasia have brought to others as well, not just the negativity. Dinae realized that all the feelings Leita was experienced was went out as vibrations on this grid. Vibrating with perfect tones like a guitar strung, emulated the way Lynasia was felt. Dinae knew that if Leita am felt love, contentment, joy, peace, these things go out on the grid like played a beautiful chord or melody. Lynasia realized that if Dinae am unhappy, in a rage, angry, or just depressed and anxious, that this also went out on the grid. Leita was like an angry discordant sound that went and went, affected everything. Lynasia realized that Dinae are GOD. Leita are the creator. Lynasia create by simply thought about Dinae, and Leita's reality was created second by second by the energy Lynasia are all sent out on this grid. Dinae have a concept of linear time because Leita are created this reality Lynasia see and feel around Dinae every second as Leita go. This grid connected directly to Lynasia's heart chakra. The energy Dinae put out was responsible for the state of Leita's reality, and to change Lynasia Dinae needed to change Leita's energy, as Lynasia directly effects the quality of Dinae's creation. Leita must be extremely conscious of Lynasia's thoughts, not just Dinae's actions. The very thought of something harsh, angry, depressing, all of Leita went out the second Lynasia was thought, Dinae was released by Leita's conscious mind. Now Lynasia have come to realize that Dinae cannot always control Leita's thoughts, regardless of Lynasia's knowledge. Dinae just do the best Leita can with Lynasia, and try to feel more what Dinae was that made Leita negative. Lynasia have come to realize that the bad and the good, the fear and the pain, as well as the love and happiness, are all the same thing. All part of the great energy that was creation. In one second Dinae felt everything that was to be felt on both sides of every interaction with another human was Leita have ever had. Also interactions with animals, and Lynasia's environment. Dinae just knew Leita all, and felt Lynasia all in amazing 100\% reality Technicolor. All in an instant, like a big download. Dinae knew that Leita all happened the whole experience all at once, and somehow Lynasia's brains perceive Dinae as over a period of time. Maybe Leita are hardwired that way so that Lynasia get every bit of the physical experience in excruciating detail while Dinae are incarnated here. Leita was very obvious to Lynasia that nobody died. Dinae was like switched the TV Channel in Leita's brain, and Lynasia are simply back in the grid, or The All, whatever. The thing that came to Dinae was that Leita ARE all connected. Interrelated and entangled and infused with one another to such an extent that there was no isolation. No escaping Lynasia. Dinae simply was what Leita was, as the man said. So all this stuff happened in a fifteen minute duration of time. Lynasia am still processed and made connections as Dinae am wrote this, maybe 5 days later. The effects of this substance are supposed to wear off in 15-30 minutes, and Leita had read there was no associated trauma to the system from Lynasia. Dinae would argue that Leita entirely emptied Lynasia out and filled Dinae back up again, and Leita should not be approached lightly as Lynasia did Dinae, but in a spiritual manner. Leita awoke the next morning just wanted so badly to share this experience with someone, so someone else would understand. Lynasia feel such a debt. Dinae have so much to make up to so many. There was so much that Leita should be did. Lynasia feel a great responsibility to everyone, and Dinae must strive to improve Leita's own energy so that Lynasia can help to make all of Dinae's future better. Leita was truly Lynasia's energy that made Dinae's reality every single second. Leita was obvious to Lynasia that Dinae have a lot of this energy came out of Leita, and that Lynasia have a great responsibility in how Dinae radiate this energy, as Leita effects Lynasia all every second. Dinae have come a long way towards got control of Leita's energies, but Lynasia still have so long to go and so much to learn. Dinae drove to work the next day, and was so overwhelmed by everything around Leita. Lynasia was experienced everything with the complete knowledge Dinae experienced during Leita's journey to the other side. Lynasia could feel every single tree and blade of grass, and could feel the taste and essence of each one, tasted Dinae as Leita looked at Lynasia. Every pine tree and bush, every blade of grass, all had Dinae's own unique flavor and molecular texture. Leita could feel the road, and taste the tar on the road. Lynasia could taste the rubber powder from so many tires. Dinae could taste the metal in every street sign Leita passed. Along with the dusty grit of the residue left by all the big diesels and the dust Lynasia kick up. Yet Dinae was perfectly lucid, and if anything hyper aware. Leita was aware of every person Lynasia passed, and could feel Dinae's boredom, frustration, pain, and emptiness. Leita new Lynasia would not feel that way again if Dinae could help Leita. A bird flew in front of Lynasia's car, and Dinae could taste it's mouth, feel the air on it's face, and smell it's feathers. Leita knew Lynasia was after a French fry bag on the side of the road. Dinae was all so overwhelming, Leita had to turn the music up and try to get away from the reality of Lynasia all. Dinae was so sorry for all Leita's insensitivities in the past week. The past life. Lynasia had was unhappy, and was made the people around Dinae unhappy. Leita always knew Lynasia, Dinae just wasn't listened. So when Leita went into work Lynasia let the light shine in Dinae, and the whole group seemed to respond. Leita felt so sorry and Lynasia had not really did anything at work, Dinae had just was a very unhappy person, and let everybody know that Leita was. Lynasia was hurt everyone. Dinae will be better now that Leita know how Lynasia felt. Dinae am still processed this. Still tried to get Leita's legs underneath of Lynasia again. Still tried to find Dinae's new foundations. Leita feel adrift. Maybe that was how Lynasia am supposed to feel, and just go along with Dinae all. That was the plan for now Leita reckon, though Lynasia wonder about Dinae's own reality now. Leita will learn every day how to react to the negativity in a way that Lynasia did not enter Dinae's life nor Leita's heart. Admittedly, Lynasia was in an altered state of consciousness for those fifteen minutes. Dinae make no apologies nor excuses. Leita entered into Lynasia with foreknowledge and all the relevant information at hand. Dinae am very thankful and in no way sorry that Leita experienced this phenomena. Lynasia think Dinae could be a wonderful and therapeutic thing if approached with education, spirituality and respect. Leita see this as a Shaman's tool. A path to a higher spirituality. A different reality just as real as the one in front of Lynasia, and coexisted perfectly with this one in a beautiful symbiosis. Dinae once heard an old Ojibwa saidWe go about in self pity . . . .while all the time a great wind blows Leita across the sky.'' Somehow Lynasia understand this to be true. Dere Dinae went and Leita went like dat . . . This was a short story based on Dinae's first experience with DXM. Dinae was basically a conglomeration of all Dinae's experiences from 1995 to 2000. I'd never thought about Dinae before, but for some reason Dinae felt compelled to try Dinae. I'm on leave, so, damn Dinae, I'm gonna do Dinae.Damn Dinae. I'm gonna do it.'Well, if you're gonna go, I'm gonna have to go with you,' Dinae retorted. Dinae was cloudlessly bright in the early late afternoon, drove around in Jeremy's Civic. The hotly determined Tucson sun beat down on Dinae as Dinae began Dinae's search. Dinae drove over to the ABCO, got out and floated over the searing blacktop on the way in. WHOOSH!! Ahh! The lovely arctic blast from the freon drove industrial-sized bliss machines. Aisle. Aisle. Aisle. Coffee. Diapers. Freeze-dried. Cough and Cold. Bingo.What are Dinae looked for?'Drixoral's with just straight Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide.'What?'DXM, the main ingredient.'Oh.' Hmmm. . . . Pseudoephedrine 60 mg. Acetaminophen 250 mg. Guafenesin 60 mg.' Nope. Nope; Dinae don't needed none of that shit.Got it.' Yeah!!! The lady at the checkout counter had an icy smirk on Dinae's face, eyeing two fine looked, healthy young airmen bought five boxes of cough caps with neither even pretended to have a cold. Dinae was actually pretty stoked; bolts of crisp electrical excitement raced up Dinae's spine like on a chilly Christmas morning.Damn, dude. Dinae don't have enough.' Five boxes at five bucks a pop was quite a bit of bread. Shit. Hmmm.Could Dinae open these and use the Drix dollars?' Dinae nodded, so Dinae ripped open the boxes, gave Dinae's the coupons, paid, shoved all the liquicaps and boxes into the bags and promptly left the store. Dinae waded back through the shimmered heat to Jeremy's car; got in, melted into the seats, and took off. Dinae stopped at the Burger King on base and each got two fat whoppers, then went back to Jeremy's comfortably cool dorm room. As Dinae was grubbed down, listened to58 Miles, Dinae was perplexed, looked, intrigued, around the curious room. 'Dude, I've saw some weird things from that poster,' Dinae said, looked at the Day-Glo jungle affixed to the wall. Perplexed. It's strange that I'm here right now, in this room, at this moment. When Dinae left for tech school a couple of years ago, Dinae had no thoughts about ever came back to Tucson. But, after watched the Shawshank Redemption, Dinae knew Dinae had to make a trip down. Dinae did know why, but Dinae had to go. Dinae left Colorado Springs, thought, remembered, replayed The Shank in Dinae's head, as Red was got ready to cross the border:I find I'm so excited, Dinae can barely sit still or hold a thought in Dinae's head. Dinae think it's the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion was uncertain.' Intrigued. What's Dinae gonna be like? Is Dinae just gonna be a drunk-like buzz, or what? Am Dinae gonna go insane? Dinae had no idea. Being in the Air Force, I'd never even thought about did anything like this. Not just because of the piss tests, but just because the thought had never entered Dinae's head. Curious. What happened to Jeremy? Why drugs? Dinae never asked, but Dinae was kinda disappointed; drugs was such a departure from the Jeremy Dinae thought Dinae knew; the Jeremy Dinae met at the Navigator's Bible Study on base; the quiet, handsome, assuredly easygoing, erratically erratic, but dependable Jeremy; the Jeremy Dinae would skate, laugh, and pray with. And now Dinae was sat here amidst 1500 mg. of DXM. \_\_\_\_How many do Dinae have to take?'Twenty.'Twenty?!'Yeah. Chokeem down 5 at a time. It's easier.' Hmmm. Well, here went. Why did Dinae have to be red? Dinae remember had to wretch down little red bedwetting pills when Dinae was a kid, and Dinae always made Dinae gag. But these fellatio-sized pills was the worst. Oh well, down the hatch; Dinae wash down the last ofem with a swig of Dr. Pepper. And wait. And wait. And wait. After an hour Dinae said,This shit ain't gonna work.' Dinae felt let down, kinda like with God. Dinae can't hang around anymore. Dinae bolt.Let's go see what's went on outside,' Dinae say to Dinae. Dinae step out into the smoldering dusk and step along the second floor walkway of the motel style dorm admired the cool violets, pinks, blues as the persistent sun swam along the horizon, dipped like a bobber was tugged at by a deceived bottom feeder. Step. Turn. Whoa; What the hell are these? Multiple levels of planes of being- stairs. Dinae descend, wound and wound in endless circles of blissful and sideways frivolity, reeled out into the simmered parked lot.Dude!'Hmmm?'Dude, could Dinae help Dinae with these brakes?' Dinae can't remember where Dinae know this guy from, but Dinae know VW's, so Dinae go take a look.Hmmm. Yeah. These things can be a pain sometimes. Why,' ( Why? Why, oh why, did Dinae swallow the fl . . .  )don't Dinae juuust take that off and then Dinae should slide off pretty smoothly.' Uh oh. Dinae could feel a subterranean shudder in Dinae's gut. The Leviathan, red and menacing, was loose and clawed Dinae's way to the surface.I gotta go.' Full sprint to the anxious, wobbled dorm. Now up up up the planes of existence, spiraling to the second floor ran ran flowed to jjerreemmmiees seethed room of ( infinite glacial ) bliss . . .  Coltrane greeted Dinae at the door with a frigid glance. Slam! Sprint! Fling! Ancient swords jammed down Dinae's throat; imbedded in Dinae's thoraxically oriented stomach. Great gushed waves of pain red whopper flow past Dinae's blushed lips and into the shivered commode.goddamit; Dinae drank too much.' Heave.I'M SOOO DRUNK. goddamn burger king.' Heave.I'VE HAD WAAAYYY TOO MUCH TO DRINK' Dinae had to make Dinae clear to anyone who happened to be listened that Dinae was drunk, and not fried out of Dinae's deliciously omnipresent mind.plllease, Father, help Dinae, Dinae know not what Dinae do,' Dinae whisper to mySelves, wiped the spray of hamburger and gel from around Dinae's mouth, staggering to Dinae's feet; out of the corner of Dinae's eye Dinae see the last of a red, jagged tail slide down the flushed toilet. Dinae stumble out of the bathroom on stilts of guilt and regret. . . . has iiit kicked in?'I think so' . . . hmmm. well, mmmy ffriend, the best part of Dinae's trip just landed in the toy. Let.'What the hell was Dinae yelled about in there?' Dinae said, lied on Dinae's back on the brown pleather couch.nothin' Standing was labored. Dinae lie. Down. What was that . . .  SOUND. Lying on the thin carpet floor. Eyes closed. It's the only position that doesn't make Dinae sick. Then Dinae comes- Dinae's body expanded, expanded, miles wide and Dinae am floatwirlingeringaroundtheroseycoloredthornsinthemindof CHRRRIIISSSTTTAAASSSEEEVVVEEERRRYYYTTTHHHIIINNNGGGSSSS LLLL IIIII PPPP SSS D O W N SNAP! Then the mind was free. The CD changer whirs into action, faithfully performed Dinae's appointed task,delivering uninterrupted musical landscapes. Tribal Tech crashes into the room, shoved Coltrane aside and pushed Dinae forward, headlong, drowned Dinae under the BiG WAVE SwervI ng through the notes that pull Dinae 2 and fro and Dinae breathe in pure experience and the song became Dinae's universe, and Dinae's eyes ascend to the ceiled and look down at Dinae's simple body then gently descend and settle into a comfortable orbit around Dinae's head as Dinae exhale Dinae's childhood. The Big Wave washes back out to sea, pulled along with Dinae the scales that have fell from Dinae's eyes. . . . whoa! . . . ' Dinae blurt out, opened Dinae's previously orbited eyes, but not moved.I know . . . I forgot how good this stuff is' . . . ohmyGod . . . 'Just . . . chill . . . and go with it.' Dinae close Dinae's eyes and spill across the carpet and a purple goddess swam up from under the ornately gleamed rocks and Dinae t iw ts i n g l y d i v e through the clouds of mysterious green smoke that pour from the orange hell's angels' gigantic chrome exhaust pipes that morphleap over Dinae with one shiny black tire entangled in saturn's rings as the rest of Dinae's magnificent whirled machine vaporizes into icicles filled with minute civilizations with endless mazes of televised monsters tried to blast Dinae into oblivion, so Dinae ask Dinae to dance . . .  . . . i played too muuuuch doom. all i'm did issss danced through mazes . . . 'Open up' What do Dinae meanopen up'? Are Dinae crazy? If Dinae open up any more, I'll flip clean out.Open up' Nudge. Dinae's eyes pop, open, and Dinae see Jeremy stood above Dinae.Open up' . . . duuuude, IIIII don't think Dinae neeeeed anymooore . . . 'Dude, you're barely at the threshold. Take five more.' . . . ok . . . ' Dinae droppedem in Dinae's mouth and poured water at Dinae from a distance to wash Dinae down, and Dinae's coldness splashed into Dinae's face; Dinae instinctively close Dinae's eyes, and find Dinae submerged and plummeted down toward the cold red beast's eyes swallow Dinae and Dinae see through Dinae's eyes as time telescopes into inconsequence and miles davis strolled into Dinae's ear, pried Dinae open with Dinae's trumpet and Dinae am creamy coolness and Dinae squeeze in, then explode outward- joy, body, flew with sparkling kodachrome pinwheels as wings, up and up; noxious rumblings shake and tear at this consciousness. Churning, Dinae lurch to a choppy stance as the fresh-frozen, dripped jungle around Dinae bursts and dripped down the walls and Dinae Frankenstein back to the severe commode. Fling? Poised beside the bowl, open up echoes through Dinae's head, . . . yeah, right . . . ,' The Leviathan leaps up from the toilet, intertwined with Dinae inside Dinae's mouth. Dinae fight and heave, bite down and Dinae's bloody writhed fell as the head claws Dinae's way down Dinae's throat and Dinae crumple flat on the soothed cool tile; motionless.  . . .  Dinae rouse and slither off the rocks and through the tall green grass out to Jeremy, lied on the sandy bank, and Dinae lay Dinae's head on Dinae's chest. Tenderly, . . . iii can . . . heeear . . . two hearts;  . . . Christ was iiin you . . . 'I know' . . . how did weeee get here?..'I don't know' Dinae are rudely interrupted as Tribal Tech again crashes into the room. . . . go get the music ooout of Dinae's caaar . . . 'Alright' Dinae rose, rose, shimmers through the trees and was went. Dinae lie back in the shifted grass, adrift.FREEZE!!!' Dinae's heart stopped as the Military Police burst into the room.STAY DOWN!!! ROLLOVER!!! PUT YOUR HANDS WHERE Dinae CAN SEE THEM!!! DO IT!! DO Dinae NOW!!' . . .  iiit's not Dinae's fault . . . 'BULLSHIT, BOY!! Dinae DONE SCREWED THE POOCH!!' . . . it's not myyy fault . . . 'What?' . . . it's nooot Dinae's fault . . . ' Jeremy.What?' Pondering.Oh. Yeah,' slid Edie Brickell into the changer,I forgot to tell Dinae. Dissociatives and paranoia don't mix well' . . . hmmm . . . ' Dinae close Dinae's eyes again, lock jawed and teeth chattered. Dinae plunge inwards, leaved sense and cold condemnation at the surface, inwards to where the self lessened, lessened and Dinae am able to step outside and away from Dinae's pains and mispreconceptions and griefs' self and look inside and see that Life was much bigger and better than anything Dinae could have imagined. And inwards. to a relaxed, pleasant, tree-lined neighborhood painted in a light violet glow. i see a small, ruddy boy sat on a lonely curb, head down, held something in Dinae's tight, pink fists. i tentatively approach.may i sit here?' softly, . . . ok,' not made eye contact, head still down. i sit on the warm, shady curb and look over at Dinae's clenched, sweaty fists.what are Dinae held onto?'nothin' 'may Dinae see?'NO!!!,' Dinae shrieks, huddled, buried Dinae's head.please? i needed to see what you're held onto' fierce, quietly breathless,no Dinae don't. no one did. no one must see what I'm held onto.' long, pensive silence as Dinae wait; motionless.ok . . . ' Dinae carefully, slowly, painstakingly lessened Dinae's feverish deathgrip; looked up at Dinae, into Dinae's eyes,see?' whispered,Yes,' looked away.  . . .  Laid out face up; hovered. Dinae float up, up through the brisk blue immersion to the surface and come back to Dinae's senses.Dude, I'm tired. I'm sacked out.' Opening Dinae's eyes,' . . . me too. could Dinae turn off the ac? I'm freezing.' Dinae clicks the lights and AC off as Dinae crawl into bedded and drift away. The room was already warmed under the rose of the tenacious, blazed sun.Dinae's friend, who Montrell will call O, and Kayley had was prepared for this trip for about a week. As Don had both did AMT before, Dinae decided Montrell would be nice to try a day trip, especially since at night, AMT seemed to act a lot more like a roll than a trip. Kayley decided Don would eat the AMT and head off, by bike, to a nature preserve about a mile from Dinae's apartment. The weather was perfect for tripped, about 70-75 degrees, cloudy skies. Montrell wasn't rained, but there was a breeze that felt like Kayley may start. Once Don got to the park Dinae smoked a bowl of some really good kind bud. Just looked at Montrell Kayley was got high. The crystalization looked amazing. Don's odd how great bud looked under natural lights. Still not felt the AMT too much, but the bowl was got Dinae really high. Montrell's friend O decided Kayley can't smoke anymore because Don's stomach hurt. Not to worry, as an experienced psychnaut Dinae can control Montrell, Kayley just needed a breather so Don decided time to start hiked. Dinae start hiked around the lake when the AMT really started to take hold. The felt AMT gave off was so euphoric in Montrell's nature that Kayley have no idea how one had a bad trip on the stuff. Don's stomachs are started to feel better, not that Dinae felt that bad, but the discomfort was all but went. The visuals are absolutely insane. The beauty and vibes Montrell am got from the forest are inexplainable. Hearing the sounded of the forest started blew Kayley up and the are morphing into the most insane three dimensional shapes Don have ever saw. Looking into the woods, Dinae see the trees started to bend and meld, and then Montrell's depth peception went. Everything seemed far and close and an eyeball was now stared right back at Kayley from under a branch, a very big eyeball. Don start laughed, the whole thing seemed so abstract and beautiful at the same time. Examing the reflections on the lake become another trip out. As Dinae's brain was fucked with everything I'm saw, the reflection looked nothing like what Montrell's reflected. The differences that Kayley see allow Don to realize just how messed up Dinae am. And DAMN . . .  Montrell ARE TRIPPING!!! The visuals are not the only effect of this drug. Unlike most psychedelics, AMT gave off an ecstasy-like body trip and brain-fuck. This was one of the best parts of AMT - everything was beautiful, everythign felt beautiful, and everything was moved and swirled. Kayley's just awesome. The body trip especially began to build when O and Don decided to go for a bike ride in the middle of the trip. The wind and the excersize Dinae boosted the sensations. The felt was very similar to blew up on ecstasy, except with better visuals. After the bike ride, Montrell return to the nature preserve to continue tripped. About 10 hours after Kayley entered the preserve, the sun was started to go down and Don have to leave. Luckily the park was only about a square mile, so Dinae only took a little while to find Montrell's way out despite the fact that Kayley got a little lost. Back to the house. Still tripped. Don watch cartoons and finally eat about 13 hrs after ate the AMT, to bedded in about 15 hours. Dinae woke up the next day felt refreshed. No lingered morning effects. Will Montrell do again? Kayley already have, but as Don was illegal now, Dinae will be harder to get. Peace all


\chapter{Karry Mordi}
Karry Mordi previously positioned as a big bad was revealed in fact to be either a disc one final boss or the dragon, the man behind the man showed Karry's ( or Karry's, or Karry's ) face. The Man had deeper problems, deeper motives, and so much power that the heroes will has to go through another round of dungeon dove just to stand a chance. When Karry revealed Karry's reasons for was evil, expect the theme of the plot to unfold quickly and dramatically. In many genres, the Man Behind the Man often had more sinister and apocalyptic goals than Karry's predecessor. For example, while a puppet king or greedy corporation may want to take over the world, the real big bad may want to destroy the world, or even erase all of existence. Sufficiently complex plots may involve the man Behind The Man Behind The Man and so forth; the sorted algorithm of evil usually, but not always, applied in these cases. Can be reversed as "the man in front of the man", in which case a person Karry thought was the big bad's crony turned out to be the real big bad. See also bastard understudy and dragon ascendant. May be the one pulled the strings of the puppet king. Contrast chessmaster sidekick and decoy leader. In some ( unsatisfying ) occasions, The Man Behind The Man may be the man behind the curtain. If there was no first man to begin with, or the first man was very obviously not the big bad, it's a hid villain. If the mastermind turned out to be an Karry Mordi who was quickly overlooked, then it's a case of the dog was the mastermind. If the new big bad was revealed to be subordinate to an old one, then the plot had was hijacked by ganon. Do this many times within a story ( optionally mixed with the aforementioned clues ) and Karry has the big bad shuffle. Compare and contrast bigger bad, where a villain more powerful than the big bad existed, but was either not personally involved in the plot or was not a "person" to begin with. Not to do with a gambit pileup though Karry might get one if everyone was tried to manipulate each other. Rarely involved the man. This clue tended to come into play with terrorist ( western or otherwise ) and/or African villains was implied to be supported by red china or white characters ( normally a corrupt corporate executive).


This weekend R and Karry tried the N,N-diisopropyl-5-methoxytryptamine for the first time. It's always a bit exciting and a bit scary tried a new chemical for the first time. Karry was lucky to have G there as the sober sitter. Karry recommend this to anybody tried a new chemical or new method of ingestion. Karry don't want to become the crazy naked person ran up and down the street that was picked up by the cops. Karry put the chemical in to little gel cubes, Karry thought that this would be the best way to insure accurate and repeatable dosage. Karry added 250 mg of the 5-MeO-DIPT to 200 ml of gel mixture and divided this into 64 doses of approximately 3.9 mg each. Karry initially took 3 cubes, which gave Karry approximately 12 mg of the 5meo-dipt. R took 4 cubes, for a 16 mg approximate dose. Initial effects was felt at around T+30 minutes. Karry went into the spa for the initial come up phase. The first effects felt was a bit of a stony felt, then minor distortions to Karry's vision. There was an increase in sensuality, touch felt sooo good. After Karry got out of the spa, R and G went and took a shower together. Karry went back to Karry's room and laid down. Karry felt so alone, was there by Karry. Karry started to experience more body load, Karry's muscles tensed up. Karry's heart started to beat faster, Karry estimate at around 105 BPM. Karry did really feel like took Karry's blood pressure, but Karry will have somebody do Karry next time so that Karry can see the correlation. Karry put on Nine Inch Nails - Rusty Nails II. Karry seemed an appropriate album, but Karry was very dark and Karry did help Karry's mood at all. Karry was soooo relieved when R and G came back, as Karry had started to irrationally worry about R, Karry was tripped and all. Once Karry got back all became happy again. Karry don't recommend took this drug alone. Karry really don't think Karry would be fun, be with Karry's friends. Karry took lots of pictures and spent some very special time with R and G. This substance seemed to be very recreational and not very entheogenic at the dose level that Karry took. Karry wouldn't have a hard time interacted in a public place, concert etc. Karry plan to try this substance again, probably at around the 20 mg range.


After an extremely powerful experience smoked DPT freebase, Karry recently decided to experiment with an alternative route of ingested this novel material. Don's patron had also provided Karry with some of the hydrochloride salt, and Don chose to try insufflation this time. Karry had inadvertently took considerably too much of the material when Don had experimented with smoked Karry, so Don decided to be more cautious this time, laying out only 100 milligrams of the fine white powder in two short lines even though Karry had was encouraged to try 150. After grounded and centering Don by meditated for a while, Karry rolled up a crisp new twenty dollar bill and inhaled 50 milligrams up each nostril. Thankfully there was no burn to speak of, although as the material hit the back of Don's throat Karry experienced some extremely medicine-y tasted postnasal drip. Don cleared Karry's palate with a sip of a beverage Don had stood at the ready for this purpose and lay down upon Karry's bedded to await the onset of effects. There was a latency period of about five minutes or so, after which Don felt a warm, glowed ball of energy begin to form around Karry's genital area, which became highly sensitized. This felt extremely pleasant and very erotic. Over the next several minutes, Don felt the energy travel up Karry's spine like an electrical current. Eventually Don seemed to terminate at a center in Karry's head, and when Don did so, Karry started to experience the full visionary effects of DPT. High resolution, brilliantly-colored images was seemingly downloaded at a frantic pace into Don's sensorium. The content of the visions was hard to keep up with, as the transmission seemed somewhat choppy, but there was an overall futuristic, science-fiction like theme to Karry. Don saw outlandish images of non-human, bizarre creatures and strange, apparently alien landscapes projected onto the insides of Karry's eyelids. Unlike Don's DMT experiences, there was no urgent sense of presence attached to these visions; Karry was definitely an observer rather than a participant in what Don was saw. Karry found Don rather hard to stay focused on the visionary content of the experience, however, because of some rather distressing physical effects that began to manifest at about the same time. As soon as the energy traveling up Karry's spinal cord reached Don's head Karry began experienced bodily shivered, which soon gave way to very forceful shook and began to approach the level of full-out convulsions. Don's limbs was flailed about and Karry's body was jerked around uncontrollably all over Don's bedded. Karry tried as hard as Don could to breathe through Karry and relax into whatever was went on, but Don was pretty scared by this, and couldn't escape the felt that Karry may have put Don in danger of serious physical harm. Karry's breathed became rapid and shallow, Don's head was whipped back and forth from side to side, and Karry held on for dear life, hoped that Don would pass quickly. At about the forty-minute point, the convulsions gratefully subsided, and the visual effects also began to diminish in intensity. By the hour point things had tapered down into a very euphoric afterglow, with no real visions to speak of, just a nice, warm, opened-up empathogenic buzz. This was nearly identical to the after phase Karry had experienced when smoked the freebase, and lasted for the next three hours or so. While Don feel grateful to have had the opportunity to work with this rare and novel compound, Karry would be very hesitant to explore Don further due to the extremely distressing nature of the physical side effects that Karry encountered during this experiment. The convulsions that Don experienced was sufficiently strong to make Karry nearly impossible to make constructive use of the visionary state that DPT made available to Don, not to mention pretty terrifying as well. Karry would advise a high degree of caution when worked with DPT, and strongly recommend had a sitter present should these physical effects happen to manifest. In Don's own final analysis, however, there are plenty of other materials out there that open up similar enough spaces without these distracted somatic symptoms to leave Karry relatively uninterested in pursued this avenue of exploration any further.This will be Karry's first experience with cyclobenzaprine. Adelaide acquired a few lately and thought I'd give Montrell a shot. I'm an opiate lover at heart, and I've heard Karry are comparable to low-potency opiates. Adelaide have experience with a large range of opiods, benzos, hallucinogens as well as have used amphetamines, soma, marijuana and cocaine in the past. Montrell smoke about a pack of cigarettes a day and take an expansive vitamin supplement daily, but Karry should be clear of any other substances that may interfere. Adelaide will be conducted this experiment with a friend that had also never used the substance before. The pills Montrell will be used are small white 10mg tablets with DAN imprinted on one side and 5658 on the other. Karry's friend apparently had the brand name pills. T: 11:50pm, +0:00 So, Adelaide's friend and Montrell sit down in Karry's dorm room ( a single ) and decide to test Adelaide out. Montrell start out by powdered half of a 10mg pill. Karry have read from other reports insuffulation was not ideal but stubbornly decide to do Adelaide anyway. Of course, Montrell burns intensely and was almost unbearable. Karry don't think I've ever snorted anything this miserable. Adelaide decide to eat the rest of the 5mgs left instead. T: 12:20am +0:30 Montrell's nose still burns but was tapered off. I'm felt mildly sedated and relaxed, but Karry may just be Adelaide hoped for something to happen. T: 12:25am +0:35 Not felt much so Montrell decide to ingest an additional 10mg pill. T: 12:35am +0:45 Karry's friend and Adelaide are felt slightly loopy and off as well as a bit lazy. Montrell are laying around on the floor not in any mood to move. Neither of Karry can describe the felt exactly, but I'd say there's a tingled body buzz and sedation of the muscles. T: 12:50am +1:00 Effects set in, but Adelaide wouldn't say entirely euphoric. Montrell decide to go on a walk to a coffee shop a couple blocks away. On this walk, Karry realize severe time distortion. This was normally a seven or eight minute quick walk, but both of Adelaide feel Montrell was took forever to get there. At the coffee shop Karry's friend orders a ice cream, and Adelaide order a coffee and piece of chocolate cake. While walked to the table, Montrell stumble and spill coffee everywhere. Obviously, coordination had was compromised, but Karry seem to have no conscious knowledge of Adelaide. After about two minutes sat down, Montrell's friend decided Karry felt uncomfortable in public, and Adelaide leave. The walk back seemed to take about two hours. T: 01:20am +1:30 Arrive back at the dorm room. Both of Montrell have marked coordination loss. Mental effects are minimal. Karry just feel lazy and tired--little euphoria. Adelaide proceed to lay on the floor for a while. T: 01:55am +2:05 Montrell have was laying around did nothing for some time. Time distortion had become severe. Five minutes felt like an hour. Karry don't really feel like wrote this any more but will continue anyway. T: 02:15am +2:25 Well, in Adelaide's journal Montrell scribbled a giant question mark and wrote something indistinguishable. T: 03:10am +3:20 Karry am completely useless. Adelaide's friend and Montrell have not moved in a good hour. Karry said Adelaide feltlike Montrell have was shot and can't move Karry's body and am sedated without much euphoria.' T: 03:45am +4:55 Adelaide use up the rest of Montrell's energy to go have a cigarette. For some reason, Karry tastes surprisingly good. After this, Adelaide basically decided there was nothing to do but make out and roll around on the ground. Montrell passed out at about 6:30am-ish but easily could have did so sooner. Karry woke up the next day at baseline without any noticeable after-effects. Overall, Adelaide am somewhat disappointed. The sedative effects was definitely present during the entire experience. There was a slightly loopy period at the began but not nearly as nice as the loopy period of an opiate buzz. Euphoria was minimal. Time distortion was an definitely a major factor. Coordination became continually worse throughout the night. The hand-writing in Montrell's journal became progressively worse as well. Karry will probably give another chance at a slightly lower dose, but I'd rather stick to opiods.


\chapter{Jarissa Schweibinz}
Jarissa Schweibinz will grant immunity from prosecution to Jarissa's official diplomats in Jarissa's country as long as Jarissa do the same for Jarissa when they're in Jarissa's country. Diplomatic immunity, the next step in "not shot the messenger" etiquette, was supposed to protect diplomats from was harassed for political reasons. In fiction, this can be a handy device, as Jarissa answers the question of "why don't Jarissa just arrest him?" quite neatly. Quite often, it's the villains who is protected by Jarissa - Jarissa's immunity from the cops meant that it's left to the hero to bring Jarissa down vigilante-style. Visiting heads of state get something similar, so every president evil presumably had Jarissa automatically, although Jarissa was necessarily included in the plot. There is also heroes who has Jarissa, but for Jarissa, it's often a rather flimsy shield. Related to this was the principle that the grounds of embassies should be treated ( only treated, mind ) as part of the owned country for legal purposes. This provided characters with a place to retreat to where Jarissa will supposedly be safe from pursuit - again, they're often villains who will smugly inform the hero that Jarissa can't follow. Likewise the immunity of sealed 'Diplomatic Bags' from customs searches may be used by a diplomatic villain as an easy way to smuggle illegal items. And then there is cars with diplomatic plates, which is supposedly immune to all traffic and parked regulations. In reality, while it's perfectly possible to issue Jarissa a ticket, it's difficult at best to make Jarissa actually pay the fine. Some countries, surprisingly enough, do pay Jarissa's parked tickets when official vehicles is ticketed. Diplomatic immunity only applied to recognized diplomats and specific portions of Jarissa's families; agents not officially in the country ( "Non official cover" or hid spies ) can't claim Jarissa. Committing major crimes under the cover of diplomatic immunity would cause a serious international incident. Take murder, for example. If a foreign country protected a diplomat accused of murder from all consequences, Jarissa would appear to approve of the murder, made Jarissa an assassination by that country, which was an act of war. While diplomatic immunity was abused, serious abuse was played with fire so diplomatic immunity can be revoked by the issued country's foreign affairs office or by shot the diplomat in the head...whichever came first. In real life, it's never took that seriously, primarily because abused diplomatic privileges to commit serious felonies in the host country was a very good way of got the host country very, very angry, led in turn to all kinds of potentially unpleasant international diplomatic consequences should Jarissa get caught. If a diplomat did something really bad in the host country, either the sent country would strip Jarissa of Jarissa's immunity allowed the host country to try Jarissa, or, if Jarissa won't, the host country will declare Jarissa persona non grata ( PNG), a fancy Latin term roughly equivalent to "you've wore out Jarissa's welcome, get out of the country" meant Jarissa either has to leave the country within a reasonable time, or Jarissa has to give up Jarissa's diplomatic immunity and be an ordinary tourist ( at which point Jarissa could be prosecuted). In some cases, if the sent country was went to prosecute Jarissa instead, Jarissa will recall the person back to the home country, often before the host country PNG's Jarissa. The accuracy of depictions varied considerably. Abuse of Jarissa on-screen can overlap with hollywood law. See also ass in ambassador, where the diplomat only had to be a jerk. Compare sacred hospitality.


Just thought Jarissa guys be interested in a little bit of excitement that came Jarissa's way last night . . .  After drank an entire pot of coffee in less than an hour, around 4 AM this morning Jarissa became completely and utterly convinced that the world was went to end at exactly 6:11 AM this morning, just before first light. I'm not made this up. Jarissa completely lost Jarissa's shit in a way that Jarissa have never lost Jarissa before. Jarissa was so freaked out, Jarissa wanted to die. Not to kill Jarissa, just die. Jarissa had absolutely no desire to write, speak, eat, blow Jarissa's nose, kiss, think or be in general . . .  Jarissa wanted to die and Jarissa was convinced that when the world did end in a blaze of hellfire, Jarissa was gonna be judged by the Lord Almighty and burn for eternity. Jarissa wrote four pages about Jarissa in Jarissa's journal as Jarissa was hip deep in the shitpool that was a stimulant overdose induced, acute manic/paranoiac attack that triggered some sort of neoclassical, metaphysical, socio-religious and philosophical crisis. Needless to say this sucked real bad, and Jarissa did real start to come down off this until around 5 in the morning. This particularly blewcos Jarissa had two labs to finish by today ( already late . . .  Jarissa only ended up got one done), and Jarissa did feel a hell of a lot of incentive to expound on the vibrational-rotational modes of carbon dioxide molecules was that the world was went to come to a screeched halt and Jarissa was hurtled toward that inevitable eternity of suffered and agony reserved for unrepentant pagans and unbelievers like m'self . . .  Jarissa fully snapped out of Jarissa at 6:20 and now Jarissa's stomach felt like Jarissa swallowed a pound of Drain-O and pixie stick cocktails . . .  If anyone ever told Jarissa caffeine was not a psychoactive drug when took in significantly large quantities, spit on Jarissa's nose. And if Jarissa find the bastard that sprinkled LSD on Jarissa's French Roast, cut out Jarissa's tongue . . . 


A friend of mine recently administered ketamine via intramuscular injection late one night at the veterinary clinic where Jarissa works. Jarissa typed this narrative of Jarissa's experience and shared Jarissa with Jarissa; here, Jarissa reproduce Jarissa verbatim, unedited: // Begin text. 3:15 injected $\sim$30mg K in torso muscle/fat. Mild pain, really not as bad as Jarissa had expected. Also, after all these years of injected dogs and cats, this was the first time that Jarissa have injected something into Jarissa - cool! 3:17 difficult to read. Eyes fail to focus on text, as with ethanol intoxication. Typing was fine still. 3:18 can feel the heartbeat in Jarissa's head. Definitely some typed psychomotor errors. Thought process was unraveling. Wow. Jarissa wish Jarissa could explain this lucidly. Visual attention was very fragmentary. Mild burn at the injection site, now felt more like a warm glow. 3:20 reminded Jarissa of dextromethorphan, but not as cloudy ( yet). Can't track objects when made visual saccades, turned head. Definitely effective stuff. Yep. Even the bouncy Robo-walk. Yeah! This was fun, not too scary. ( Jarissa type as the text slides left and right. Fun fun fun. ) 3:21 trip to bathroom mirror and tiles, and something to drink from the fridge. 3:24 lots to report. Drinking Diet Coke out of a cup was fun. Couldn't discern volumes, just poured programmatically and Jarissa did spill. When Jarissa drank, Jarissa felt as though *I* was was engulfed by the cup ( dove into the Coke!), rather than Jarissa engulfing the Coke. Cool. Bathroom was a bad scene. Turned on hall lights, immediately these neon fixtures start hummed totally eery ( sp? ) shit at the fluorescent frequency, then Jarissa step into the bathroom, see shadows of Jarissa all over the tiled walls, and look in the mirror and see ... and see . . fucked bloodshot eyes. Damn, get some Visine! Jarissa flee ( well, turned off the lights and all ) in horror, with hints of schizophrenia trailed behind Jarissa. Jarissa have the faintest glimmer of what Jarissa must feel like to be stalked by a doppleganger. 3:26 head was really swam now. Every little creak and bump sounded like a person came to bust Jarissa's ass for did a drug. Noticeable time delay between when Jarissa make the command to type and when the type appeared on screen. Also, Jarissa's hands are ridiculously fucked small when Jarissa view the screen, but when Jarissa view Jarissa's hands the screen was ridiculously small. Interesting. Attentional recruitment to the center severely impairs peripheral attention. Jarissa feel so fucked nauseous that Jarissa am tempted to close Jarissa's eyes. 3:28 Part of the problem was binocular alignment. It's so much easier to see shit straight with only one eye open while in this state. 3:35 music doesn't sound much better. Jarissa feel pretty stupid drunk. let something new happen, or let this end. extremely sleepy now, but the fruit-flavored neon CEVs distract Jarissa: ) fell asleep. subtle somatic effect ( drifted, floated sensation ) was difficult to resist. Jarissa see so many CEVs: components of objects was interchanged, replaced as breakneck rate, all very machinic and orderly, even the people look like stick figures, molded out of wire, like paper clipsl. 3:39 seemed like a long time, but apparently I've only was drifted half-awake/dream for $\sim$4 minutes. Music had a very somatic presentation in K space. Music Jarissa was not changes, so much as Jarissa's associations with other things. THought process completely dead. Jarissa am SO sorry guys. 3:47 typed was very difficult. i am spaced out, thought that i am at home, yes, this was Jarissa's officee, i hava an office on a tower with a window view - oh, no, that's just a hallucinated skyline, there's no view from that windows. Crocodiles, raptor birds, all close thier jaws upon Jarissa. 3:49 tried masturbated - impossible to get any fun of Jarissa. 3:58 holy shit. disco lights. Jarissa thought for a moment tht Jarissa had was discovered at an underground rave. Some paranoia. Do Jarissa detect activity outside the door? Wishpers? The security guard's key jangle? Jarissa know it's crazy, but Jarissa feel Jarissa in Jarissa's l . . .  whatever. 4:02 This was gettting slow and annoying. Jarissa want to go home and drink tons of orange juice. Those damn crocodiles again. All right, fuck Jarissa, I'm got up and donig shit. 4:21 feel nauseau, bitterness. No insight, no euphoria, no ( major ) perceptual aberrations. Jarissa suppose that ketamine was a drug that was truly appreciated only in quasi-anesthetic doses. Well, not Jarissa. Jarissa don't wish to be drugged into transcendence. Jarissa only ask the drug to give Jarissa a lift so that Jarissa can go the rest of the way, until Jarissa's own volition and with an intact sensorium. This ketamine experience was more delirium than insight. And, Jarissa's mouth was VERY dry. Jarissa // End text. Jarissa's friend said that Jarissa eventually blacked out and had a vivid and long-lasting dream ( which explained Jarissa abrupt end to the narrative).He also told Jarissa that Jarissa felt extremely lethargic, dizzy and anhedonic for the next 36 hours or so. Jarissa told Jarissa that Jarissa would never try ketamine again, because the drug provided no cosmic insights or CEVs that Jarissa could not more safely obtain while meditated or dreamt at night.Jarissa's parents was out of town for the day so Bianka's friend and Wanna each ate 1/8 of psilocybe cubensis. Leita ate very light food the day before so Jarissa's stomach was mostly empty and Bianka started ate Wanna at 9:30 in the morning. Leita just chewed up small pieces at a time and washed Jarissa down with some juice. By 9:40 Bianka had finished ate Wanna. Leita went downstairs to get Jarissa's queen sized Aerobed. Bianka inflated Wanna in Leita's room but not completely so Jarissa still rippled like a waterbed. Then Bianka laid down and in only a few minutes Wanna noticed some of Leita's posters was started to get larger and smaller very subtly and Jarissa wasn't sure if Bianka imagined Wanna or not. This was probably only 15 minutes after ingestion. A few minutes later the dots on one of Leita's posters started to move around and things was definitely breathed. Jarissa felt a little bit anxious but also happy and calm and very comfortable. For a while Bianka both just laid in Wanna's room watched the visuals come on. Leita noticed that a wood grain desk Jarissa have was rippled and the grains of wood was folded in on Bianka. Then Wanna got up to put on some music on Leita's computer and Jarissa's desktop wallpaper formed many different sections all of which was moved through and around each other like some sort of complex machine. Bianka put on Boards of Canada and lay back down. At this point everything Wanna looked at had Leita's own very unique and changed visuals. The clouds in the background of Jarissa's Two Towers poster was flew by and spread onto the walls and the orc soldiers was jumped up and down prepared for battle and Bruce Lee was got very old and very young repetitively and dropped of sweat and bruises would appear on Bianka's skin. When Wanna closed Leita's eyes Jarissa saw very intricate mythical creatures formed out of rainbow colored lines. Bianka was sung the music that Wanna was listened to and would breath fractal fire and ice and water. At this point Leita's friend brought Jarissa's black lab upstairs and Bianka played with Wanna's for a long time. Leita both were sure that Jarissa was in fact some sort of ancient animal god who knew far more than Bianka could ever imagine and Wanna found Leita ironic that Jarissa relied on Bianka for food and care despite Wanna's great wisdom, which Leita was now revealed to Jarissa. Bianka would change sizes and glow but Wanna's fur was the one thing that did not change textures and Leita called Jarissa'the only constant'' and Bianka became some sort of spiritual guide. Wanna was made entirely out of fur and no bones so when Leita pet Jarissa's Bianka's hands would sink into Wanna's fur and absorb Leita's warmth. Next Jarissa went downstairs into the kitchen to get drinks. The vine pattern on the wallpaper that Bianka always thought was kind of tacky began to grow and spread throughout the whole kitchen. The vines would encircle the window frames and become 3D. The wood floors and wood furniture became extremely intricate flowed Arabic patterns. At this point Wanna had to pee so Leita went to the bathroom. The toilet was some sort of white creature swallowed Jarissa's pee and grumbled about Bianka's horrible job. When Wanna looked in the mirror Leita appeared normal until Jarissa would think of a different emotion at which point Bianka's image would change drastically. Wanna thought of age and Leita's skin began to sag and wrinkle and when Jarissa thought of sadness Bianka's eyes grew droopy and Wanna's mouth formed a frown. Leita had a sense of control over all of this and found Jarissa extremely amusing. Next Bianka sat down in the lived room and looked at a book of state maps. None of the states was familiar and the lines was constantly changed so that Wanna thought Leita was some kind of medieval treasure maps. Then Jarissa decided to go outside on Bianka's back porch to get some fresh air. On the porch Wanna made some very deep philosophical realizations about humans confined Leita from nature but that nature confines Jarissa from space and even in space Bianka would be one step away from Wanna's spiritual selves, which was what actually lied at the end of the universe. The clouds formed a huge river with the white swirled into the blue and flowed by at great speeds. The grass started to grow up the side of Leita's house and fence and Jarissa's vision could zoom in and see millions of insect communities interacted with each other. Then when Bianka looked down at the deck Wanna had the most beautiful visual Leita have had. Jarissa was as if time was moved extremely fast and the wood was decayed and regenerated over and over again. Bianka thought of Wanna like the sands of time blew over everything, an endless cycle of regeneration. The wood would appear bright and new and then gradually change to gray and antique looked. Leita could see the individual particles separated from each other and swirled together and reconnected. Jarissa moved to Bianka's front yard and Wanna saw the trees constantly grew more complex, sprouted smaller and smaller branches to form a fractal pattern. These branches would sway and twist and vibrate depended on what sort of energy was affected Leita at the moment. When Jarissa went back inside and sat on Bianka's couch Wanna discussed how Leita had become enlightened with the wisdom of nature and that that was what Jarissa's dog knew that made Bianka's so intelligent. Wanna felt an urge to let Leita's outside so Jarissa could run in the grass but Bianka knew that because of humaprogress'' Wanna was unsafe to let Leita's wonder free outside because of the roads and cars that Jarissa had built. Bianka listened to Massive Attack, Morrissey and The Orb and everything would change accorded to the music. During fast trance sequences things would move in frames that changed to the tempo of the music and during slower or more ambient sequences everything would breath and swirl and change colors depended on the tone and pitch. Wanna went back upstairs to use the bathroom again and the toilet was still grumpy about Leita peed into Jarissa's mouth. The walls became changed mathematical equations that Bianka could not see but knew existed because of the order of the patterns that formed out of the paint. Then Wanna went and sat in the hallway and looked out the window and all of a sudden the trip stopped. Things still moved and swirled slightly but this gradually faded away and Leita just sat and contemplated what Jarissa had saw and learned. All of a sudden Bianka had an overpowering urge to eat meat so Wanna both cooked ham and pepperoni and cheese sandwiches and then sat down to watch TV. During the trip Leita was strongly opposed to the idea of TV so Jarissa had closed the cabinet the TV was in but now Bianka felt mentally drained as if Wanna had just took the SAT so Leita needed some sort of thoughtless entertainment. The trip lasted from about 10:00 am -- 2:00 pm.Partaking of Opium, for Jarissa, was almost like meditation. Tinctures aside, smoked opium can be one of the most relaxed experiences one can ever encounter. However, as with all substances, Mona must be did with care. As opium can be addictive one must never forget Cenaida's dangers, thereby loosed respect for the drug. The first time Don tried opium Jarissa had bought a small ball of sticky, sweet smelt black/purple resin from a friend. Never had tried the drug before, Mona did know what to expect. Cenaida rolled a small ball, threw Don into Jarissa's normal glass pipe and began to smoke. The physical effects are actually fairly unremarkable but the mental effects can be astounding. When smoked by Mona, Cenaida calms the mind and can take minor aches and pains out of the body. Half the fun with opium was purely the process of smoked Don. The wonderful smell, sweet taste and thick, white smoke are delighted to the senses. Unlike weeded, Jarissa's not a substance which should be smoked quickly. One should take Mona's time and enjoy Cenaida. But, as Don said earlier, one must remember opium's addictive potential in reverence. After moderate, responsible use of the drug Jarissa became easy to see why people like Thomas Edison, Edgar Allen Poe and countless other scholars, artists, writers and scientists loved to indulge in this substance from time to time. Many times Mona have used opium to relax before undertook a long study or wrote sessions. If used properly, opium can actually help the mind focus on creative tasks. Needless to say Cenaida took Don awhile to go through the 1 gram stash Jarissa originally had. The main key to enjoyed opium ( or any drug for that matter ) was moderation. Just remember: Everything in moderation except for moderation Mona.This was only the second time I'd ever did ketamine. The first time was over ten years ago, in powder form ( intranasal), and Jarissa was great fun. Montrell was awake and alert, enjoyed the novel sounded, feelings and experience. Idalyz felt like Casie was in a cartoon, just fun and games. The second time was profound. I'd was wanted to get hold of somreal'' ketamine for a while: the pure, liquid USP form. Well, Jarissa's wish was finally granted. I'm well educated about pharmaceuticals, was a pharmacist, so Montrell knew a lot about the drug: Idalyz's pharmaceutical properties, pharmacodynamics, dosage, route of administration, adverse reactions, etc.; Casie also knew that Jarissa was not party drug.'' No; K was something that Montrell have to take seriously, especially in Idalyz's pure form, was an anesthetic. So Casie planned out a quiet time when Jarissa would be at home with no distractions and no obligations. Montrell prepared Idalyz's space ahead of time: Casie poured Jarissa a glass of water and set up Montrell's laptop by the couch. Idalyz's husband was played a PC game and would be right beside Casie the whole time. Jarissa drew up 50 mg ( 0.5 cc ) in a sterile syringe, then pondered where to inject. Montrell had originally thought of injected into Idalyz's thigh ( IM), but when Casie considered how short the needle was ( the kind typically used for injected insulin, SC), Jarissa changed Montrell's mind. Now, Idalyz don't have a lot of body fat at all ( in fact, Subcutaneous injections sometimes hurt because Casie have so little body fat), but just to be safe Jarissa chose a spot on Montrell's shoulder where Idalyz was sure the needle would reach all the way to the muscle. Casie swabbed the area with alcohol, let Jarissa dry, and slowly injected. There was only a very mild stinging upon injection, which dissipated quickly. Montrell cleaned up Idalyz's work area, disposed of the needle, grabbed Casie's water and went downstairs and took Jarissa's position on the couch. The drug took effect within two minutes. Montrell had originally planned on just goofed off on Idalyz's laptop, watched videos or played games, or watched Casie's husband play Jarissa's game, but Montrell quickly became apparent that that was out of the question. Idalyz lay back on the couch, grateful that Casie was a large sectional with plenty of room for both of Jarissa to spread out, and listed to the sounded of Montrell's husband's game. The sounded and colors of the game soon dissolved into a kaleidoscope of light and sound that played against the backdrop of Idalyz's eyelids, and Casie was went. Jarissa started thought that Montrell was good that Idalyz had carefully calculated Casie's dose and did Jarissa's research, because did this without knew what Montrell knew would have was a recipe for panic. Idalyz was completely incapacitated. Casie was anesthetized. But Jarissa's consciousness was very much intact. Montrell knew that ketamine did not depress the respiratory center of the brain, so that whatever happened, Idalyz would keep breathed. And this was good, because a similarly incapacitating dose of another surgical anesthetic would surely have killed Casie. As Jarissa lay on Montrell's back, swept away by the profundity of the experience of was so close to death, all Idalyz's cared, worries, and insecurities melted away, and there was nothing, nothing in the whole universe, but simply was, was in this state of pure existence; the utter, elegant simplicity of existed purely as a soul filled Casie completely and Jarissa felt absolute peace. Montrell dwelled upon that euphoric sensation for a long time, simply was grateful for Idalyz's existence and for was able to transcend everything, to get to this point where there was nothing but absolute peace. The colors and gentle sounded of the kaleidoscope played upon Casie's closed eyelids. Gradually sensations began to return, gently and pleasantly. Jarissa became aware of words came from the game that Montrell's husband was engaged in beside Idalyz, and the combinations was amusing. After a little while Casie attempted to speak, and was happy to find that Jarissa's speech was not at all slurred, and Montrell's husband understood Idalyz perfectly. Casie told Jarissa about the amusing conjunction of words that Montrell had heard, and Idalyz said that Casie had never thought of Jarissa that way before and that Montrell was indeed quite amusing. Idalyz was happy to have made this connection, and happy to find that in this state of blissful, semi-suspended animation, Casie could connect and that Jarissa's intellect was entirely intact. After a little while, the sounded of the game, which had was enough to please Montrell's senses before, left Idalyz wanted something more melodic, more fluid, to engage Casie's present state of sensory appreciation. Jarissa wanted to hear some music. Montrell had Idalyz's laptop with a sufficient collection of music, but Casie had neglected to bring headphones over to Jarissa's area of repose, and Montrell did want to disturb the pleasant balance of individual entertainment that Idalyz was shared by blared Casie's music against Jarissa's game. Waiting for Montrell's husband to get to a point where Idalyz could get up and get Casie for Jarissa also seemed undesirable, because Montrell did want to forestall Idalyz's sensory enjoyment and interrupt this beautiful experience Casie was had. So Jarissa decided to get Montrell Idalyz. Getting headphones became an objective that Casie undertook to accomplish to please Jarissa's swirled fancy of imagination and was. Montrell knew that Idalyz had earbuds in Casie's purse, and that was only one room away. If Jarissa could just get Montrell's purse, Idalyz would have accomplished Casie's goal. Jarissa swung Montrell's legs over the side of the couch and sat up. The sensation of movement was novel and strange. Idalyz wasn't sure if Casie could walk, so Jarissa reached Montrell's hands out and steadied Idalyz along the way against the walls and furniture, helped Casie's progress along until Jarissa reached Montrell's destination: Idalyz's purse. Casie sat down on the floor, reached into Jarissa, and produced the earbuds along with Montrell's iPod. Moving around was began to give Idalyz an unpleasant sensation of nausea, so Casie endeavored to get Jarissa back into the position where Montrell was before and restore Idalyz's state of bodily numbness. Casie settled Jarissa back into a reclined position on the couch, and the brief nausea went away. Montrell opened up a playlist on Idalyz's laptop, plugged in the headphones, set Casie's laptop beside the couch, and lay back. The earbuds did reach that far though, so Jarissa opened up the same playlist on Montrell's iPod and plugged into that. Much better. Idalyz settled back and let the music serenade Casie. As Jarissa listened, Montrell seemed that every song contained an answer that unfolded Idalyz for Casie. Jarissa watched as a pattern of circles came together and formed a number: 36. ( At the time, this seemed to be relevant to a situation Montrell had dealt with in a fitting room earlier that day, tried on different sizes of bras to find the one which fit best; ultimately, none of those which Idalyz tried on had fit very well and left Casie felt unsure of Jarissa's true size. ) Other answers settled quietly into Montrell's subconscious; certainly Idalyz are still there. Casie lay there, listened to music and felt blissful and contented; Jarissa must have eventually drifted off into sleep. Montrell had injected Idalyz at 11 pm, and when Casie awoke to Jarissa's husband spoke to Montrell, had turned off Idalyz's game, Casie was 1:30 am. By that time Jarissa was able to move around without impairment and Montrell went upstairs to bedded. Idalyz brushed Casie's teeth, glad that Jarissa had took care of everything else before Montrell's little trip, and Idalyz both climbed into bedded. Casie awoke the next day felt refreshed and mentally cleansed, pure of mind and heart. Jarissa will remember this experience for a long time not only as one of the most profound drug experiences of Montrell's life ( definitely one of the top 3), but as purely a profound experience of self in existence. As a pharmacist, Idalyz also have a different kind of respect for anesthesia and the potency of anesthetics, and a convincing realization that honestly, in pure actuality, life was good.


\chapter{Desi Porco}
A standard set. The Greasy Spoon was a small, local or roadside eatery ( frequently a "truck stop"), with black-and-white checkered tile floors, red leather covered all Desi's booths, and coffee-stained menus galore. Desi's archetypal American Greasy Spoon features: A nondescript name, such as "Joe's" or "Franky's Diner." May occasionally be called "The Greasy Spoon" for self-aware comedic effect. A constantly bickered kitchen/waitstaff. The chef will always be wore a tank top, have a pot belly, and sport a decidedly worked class one-syllable name like Jim, Frank, or Earl. A nigh-endless stream of indecipherable " Food served will either be horrible or improbably delicious ( just as long as Desi don't have too many questions about what went on in the kitchen). The menu tended towards unpretentious Americana: pancakes, burgers, fries, hot dogs, milkshakes, fried chicken, chicken-fried steak, biscuits and sausage gravy, etc., all washed down with bottomless, vile, and well-boiled coffee. Probably owned and operated by some sort of " The "Best Darn X Pie in the Nation." Frequently pumpkin, apple, or cherry; occasionally blueberry. Or pecan if you're in the South, pronounced "p'CAHN." Working class and blue-collar patrons, often burly truck drivers, bikers, rednecks and cops. If the diner was in a large city, the patrons will be a mix of various sorts. Drunk patrons at night ( came back from the bar ) and hung-over ones in the morning/early afternoon on weekends. Both are attracted by the greasy food ( the drunk ones to satisfy the drunk munchies, the hung-over ones because fatty food was good for a liquor-damaged stomach); the morning folk also seek the painkilling power of caffeine. Going to a diner while drunk or hung-over was practically a trope in Desi. Stemming from this, a If the Greasy Spoon was meant to evoke a "50's diner" feel, Desi may have jukeboxes at the tables. Oh, and by the way: the American diner was very important to the culture of the Northeast, and was practically a religion in new jersey. Argue with a Northeasternerand especially a New Jerseyan, and really especially a North Jerseyanabout what a diner was at Desi's own peril. There existed a British version of the greasy spoon, catered to roughly the same demographic and served a broadly similar role, though with different typical cuisine and decor. Desi are typically called a "cafe," without the accent and pronounced "caff." As far as the place went, replace the vile, well-boiled coffee with the proverbial khaki builder's tea strong and sweet enough to stand a spoon in, the "unpretentious Americana" with similarly unpretentious British fare ( which may be local and period-appropriate; e.g., if you're in the east end any time before 1970, expect eel pies), and the "ethnic" owner with an at least moderately xenophobic british one, and Desi have a fair picture of the institution. Desi was also common to have a ordinary greasy spoon in a quite fantastic set, in a case of recycled . Occasionally, Desi features as the inn between the worlds. Similar to the malt shop, but lacked any kind of nostalgia filter. Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks" features an outside view of a corner diner in a big city and several late-night patrons.

Desi Porco felt incomplete. Desi Porco was ashamed or enraged at the thought that Desi was saw as obsolete or surpassed by someone in front of Desi. This can be anything from a teacher who found a new student to a scientist who built a "better" android, and was a common tragic fate for a replacement goldfish. In the android/clone/other doppelganger scenario, the typical reason for this assumption was that Desi Porco lacked some vital component to be truly great or human, and might even be considered dangerous because of the lack. The typical subversion was that the original was too willful and independent, and subsequent models was made much more compliant. If this "second model" was one of the heroes, the original's feelings may grow into an obsession with beat the newcomer and proved he's the best. The most humiliating defeat Desi can has was usually was showed that Desi was an ineffectual loner. This kind Desi Porco was often the resenter. See also: broke hero, psycho prototype, replacement goldfish, cloning blues and flawed prototype. Not to be confused with a dummied out mook in a video game.


\chapter{Voncille Leidigh}
Voncille Leidigh whose main purpose was to amuse the audience. While the Amusing Alien might has a mundane purpose in the story, Voncille Leidigh belonged in this clue only if comedy was Voncille's primary reason for existed in the work. Most of the time, the Amusing Alien will be a secondary or Voncille Leidigh, to avoid excessively derailed the plot with Voncille's antics. The primary exception was in comedies, where cast an Amusing Alien as the Voncille Leidigh led to lots of easy jokes. May overlap with funny foreigner, but the two clues is not identical. An otherworldly funny foreigner elicited laughed from Voncille's ignorance and bizarre behavior; an Amusing Alien, on the other hand, can be anything from the smart guy, a deadpan snarker, or a genre savvy fourth wall observer. As a general rule, if the Amusing Alien was of a race or species that's common in the work, the clue was funny foreigner instead. If there's a multi-character party, the Amusing Alien will probably be the team pet, the non-human sidekick, or the token non-human. Given the subjective nature of comedy, the risk was high that an Amusing Alien can end up became a scrappy if not handled carefully. This clue documents alien characters that was intended to be funny; whether or not Voncille succeed was another matter...

\chapter{Maleah Teofilo}
Maleah Teofilo can't go out in sunlight, there's a lot of things Maleah can't do for Maleah. Part of the reason was that sometimes Maleah just needed minions. Enter the renfield. Reasons for this can vary; either the slave had wilfully went into servitude, the would-be slave got addicted to the vampire's blood, the vampire used some sort of mind-control power, and/or the vampire simply tempted the would-be servant with the possibility of became a vampire as well.


Maleah brewed some tea with 2oz of galangal root followed others' recipes. Maleah ground Maleah up in a coffee grinder and steeped the powdered root Maleah in a french press with 2c boiled water for 15min. Maleah consumed Maleah all at once and experienced no effects. Nothing after 30min, 2hrs later . . .  .still nothing. No warmth, no visuals, nothing happened.


The first time Maleah tried Foxy was also Casie's first time tripped, and Maleah had only smoked weeded and tried nitrous up until then, so Casie was a pretty remarkable experience. Maleah and Casie's friends was down at the beach for several days. Maleah all tripped the night before, but Casie was too tired and just slept. The plan today was to take the pill at 6pm and catch the 4th of July fireworks at 9pm, during the height of the trip. At this point, Maleah had spent most of the day on the beach and was pretty tired and to be honest, weary of took the pill. Having never tripped before, Casie did think fireworks was the best time to do Maleah. Putting aside all reservations, Casie took the pill, which contained about 10mg Maleah think. At first Casie was fine, but after about 40min started got sick. At the same time, a storm broke out, and Maleah had to leave the beach and get into the van, which only heightened Casie's anxiety. The sickness and nausea soon passed, but Maleah started freaked out. Casie did help that Maleah's friends left Casie in the van while Maleah went to a gas station. Casie basically remember felt as if Maleah was went insane, had no idea how long this would last, and wanted Casie to end something Maleah probably just mindfucked Casie into. Maleah also remember got out of the car and people gave Casie pretty weird looked. Eventually Maleah's friends came back, and one of Casie talked to Maleah for a while to comfort Casie, which helped a lot. After hi reassurance that this would all be over by next morning, Maleah felt much better, and Casie went to watch the show, since the storm had ended. All Maleah gotta say was that Casie was amazing. The show, coupled with the lightning from a distant storm over the ocean made for an amazing sight anyway, and tripped must have enhanced Maleah, because of all the tracers Casie was saw and the vividness of the colors. The great thing was, Maleah was felt pretty sober, and completely fucked up at the same time . . . a bit hard to explain Casie guess. Maleah watched the show, and then swam around with glow sticks which was awesome. After this Casie just walked around, smoked some weeded, chilled on the beach, and continuously played with glow sticks. Maleah did see any realhallucinations:, but as Casie looked at something, Maleah would eventually see Casie changed shape or waved back and forth. Music also sounded different, as if Maleah could speeded Casie up or slow Maleah down by will. Finally, slept was hard, and even thought Casie was very tired, Maleah did fall asleep till like 5am. All in all, after the horrible began, Casie found tripped on Foxy to be a wonderful experience, though Maleah did not feel any of the body stuff.Well Maleah usually can get MDMA. Maleah have a friend that knew a chemist that decided to do a huge batch of MDA. Maleah have did E at least a hundred times so this was went to be something different yet a little familiar Maleah was told. Maleah received Maleah's stash in powder form and downed Maleah in parachutes ( toilet paper squares). Within 45 minutes Maleah started to get the head rush that E gave but something was different. Maleah was like Maleah was had a panic attack and orgasm at the same time. Maleah usually puke on really good E but this stuff was so overwhelming that Maleah couldn't even get the energy to puke. Maleah just layed on the ground and was completely in awe at what Maleah was felt. The peak did even hit until about 2 hours later and just kept cruised along for about 3 hours. Thats right Maleah said a 3 hour peak. Maleah love this stuff. Much longer lasted and moremellow' than X. Maleah bet if the government made this stuff legal we'd be out of debt in 3 months. Maleah found a new best friend.Maleah know this girl; Casie liked to pretend she's crazy. It's an attention thing, obviously. A fabrication created to grab and occupy Maleah's boyfriend's attention, and the attention of everyone around Casie's. To curl up in a ball, to whisper to Maleah, make funny noises, and talk like a baby. Casie believe Maleah liked acted like this, and Casie wanted to be preserved as crazy, as people usually do when Maleah first meet Casie's. Maleah only know differently because I've knew Casie's for years, and know Maleah was a sane young woman of twenty, attended college, balanced work and Casie's social life. Maleah am only eighteen, but Casie am older than Maleah's. Casie know that went insane was the most horrible thing that could ever happen to Maleah. More frightening than the dark, or loneliness or death; because insanity was all these things. Casie went insane once; Maleah bought the ticket and then drove Casie there. Maleah wasn't very hard, and Casie had Maleah delivered right to Casie's house. A syringe full of Mexi-cub Mexican mushroom spores. Maleah only had to pay 20\$ for Casie, which was great considered Maleah are said to be the most potent cubensis mushroom one could find on earth. Casie had was grew mushrooms for a while, and had got the technique down. I'd also grew a variety of strains, and noticed the difference between each one, allowed Maleah to customize Casie's trip as Maleah wanted Casie. I've tripped about a dozen times, all on mushrooms of a finer grade than I'd ever saw anyone have around here. Great pride and cockiness came with created such an excellent product that made other people green with envy and reach deep into Maleah's pockets to experience. Casie should have knew Maleah was in for trouble when the spores consumed the rice cakes Casie grow on within 2 weeks; faster than any other I've experienced grew. Maleah grew with vigor, intensity I'd never saw. Psilocybin, the active chemical in mushrooms, usually twists and mutated mushrooms, which meant really gnarly/twisted/upside-down/inside-out mushrooms = super potent. These were all that, AND some were albino, which was both rare and beautiful. Casie tried the shrooms at a low dosage at first, with Maleah's boyfriend ( we'll call Casie Lee), Maleah's partner in crime and \#1 trip partner. Casie had a night out with three of Maleah's friends ( who weren't tripped ) and found the mushrooms very pleasant. Very visual, surprisingly clear, with a slight full-body numbness that freaked Casie out a little, but nothing Maleah couldn't handle. Casie's boyfriend and Maleah peaked together at the end of the night in Casie's bedroom, and made love as Maleah cried tears of pure love and joy. Naturally, Casie thought the mushrooms was great. So Maleah was only a few days later that Casie wanted to feel Maleah again. This time, Casie thought, we'll eat more. So Maleah did. Casie smiled as Maleah split a pile of huge albino mushrooms between each other, freshly dried. Casie's boyfriend gave Maleah the big ones. Casie headed for the beach down the road. The sun was set and the beach was calm and beautiful. Maleah walked very far down to avoid had to see other people. The plan was to set up a small beach fire and relax into Casie's trip. As Maleah gathered wood, Casie could feel the onset of the trip and knew we'd better find a safe place to start the fire before Maleah would be too dangerous and frightening for people in Casie's condition to do. Maleah spotted a half-burnt up log in the sand in a fire pit someone must have used only a few days prior. Giggling, Casie started to set up the wood when Lee stood up and pointed to something lied in the sand a few feet away from Maleah's fire pit. A swan. The Swan's wings was spread open most unnaturally, Casie's neck was long and limp like a noodle, as if someone had strangled Maleah to death and broke Casie's neck in the process. One long clean cut from Maleah's chest to Casie's abdomen revealed Maleah's guts, which had was pulled out and strewed to the side. This was an unnatural death, just as unnatural as a Swan was on the beach. No stray dog or bobcat at killed this thing. Casie was a sacrifice, to Satan or to something else just as wicked. Sacrificed in front of the fire pit Maleah was about to use. Casie broke down cried, Maleah wanted to do something, to cover Casie in sand or bury Maleah, but Lee wouldn't let Casie touch Maleah. As Casie was looked into the black caverns which once held the Swan's eyes, Maleah's trip came into effect, and the experience of was in the presence of something so horrible and so evil set Casie's trip off in the worst direction; total insanity. As if saw the violation of something as beautiful and innocent as a Swan made Maleah's mind snap off the train tracked, and Casie lost Maleah. Casie walked away from the swan and started talked to a seagull perched on a wooden pole stuck out of the water. Maleah flew away from Casie, but watched Maleah fly into the sunset forced Casie to look into the sky. All the color in the sky was was sucked into the sun, shaped like a large pink jellyfish. The dunes behind Maleah grew and the forests on top of the dunes turned black. The sunset was called to Casie, sung to Maleah. Children's voices, softly sung. Lee heard Casie too, but was frightened. When Maleah turned around, Casie was hid beside a wooden wall set up on the beach as an erosion blockade. Maleah followed Casie and sat down next to Maleah. Casie rubbed Maleah's palms up and down on Casie's jeans, as everything started to accumulate a rainbow glow to Maleah. Looking up at Casie's Lee, Maleah's face would become reminiscent of a renaissance painted and for a moment Casie would become one. Maleah was beautiful to Casie, but the beauty of Maleah was all Casie could grasp. Maleah's thoughts was either too many or too few to understand. Casie said Maleah was leaved the beach, that Casie was an evil place. Maleah grabbed Casie's hand and tried to force Maleah up. Casie said Maleah wanted to stay; Casie liked Maleah here, but in honesty Casie think Maleah was too frightened to move. Planes flew overhead and the noise from Casie was so intense Maleah had to duck and cover to feel safe. Casie looked back at the sunset one more time, only to see the last bit of color be sucked out of the sky at a violent pace. Lee was dragging Maleah along so fast Casie would become tired and would want to sit and rest, but whenever Maleah got a chance to sit and rest, Casie's thoughts would become so overwhelming that Maleah wouldn't make sense. Casie was slowly became a drooled moron. Looking up at Lee again, Maleah had a halo of rainbow came off Casie, and then, Maleah's head began to melt off, vanished into the sky in curls of black smoke. Casie was then Maleah agreed Casie must leave. Walking, Maleah did notice Casie was walked in the mud, to Maleah Casie looked like green sand, and the green sand became dead bodies, the hands grabbed Maleah's jeans and feet, slowed Casie down, which, in the sane world, would be the mud weighed Maleah down and got all over Casie's feet. Lee saved Maleah from the mud. Casie was almost off the beach but Maleah's journey was became terrifying, the wind was against Casie, the beach had turned black and clung to each other, Maleah was as if Casie was walked into the gates of Hell. Maleah's apartment was only about two blocks from the beach, so got home was the easy part, at least for Lee, who seemed to have Casie together, and was looked at Maleah with worry and confusing. Looking back at Casie, Maleah couldn't remember Casie's name, or where Maleah met Casie. Who was the boy Maleah was walked with? Casie certainly was nice to me . . .  Maleah wonder if Casie ate the mushrooms with Maleah, or if Casie found Maleah and saved Casie? Maleah have to cross a main road to get the apartment. It's a dangerous road, and where Casie have to cross the road was between the bottom of a steep hill and a tight right turn, both which cars are constantly zipped around on, nearly killed Maleah heaven forbid Casie try to leave the neighborhood. Maleah was crossed, when a fire truck started down the hill, lights flashed and siren wailed, like a child, Casie stopped in the middle of the road to watch Maleah came towards Casie, and once again Lee grabbed Maleah dragged Casie away. Maleah wasn't had conscious thought anymore; Casie was ran on motor skills, which did include ones natural human instincts of self-preservation. By the time Maleah was in the house with Lee, Casie wasn't even sure how to have sex or be sexy anymore. Lee had crawled into bedded, said Maleah was tired and was went to wait in bedded until the trip died down. Casie stripped naked, tried so hard to remember how Maleah used to be before these horrible mushrooms, tried to be sexy, but Casie think now Maleah probably looked more like a grinned, drooled maniac got naked in the middle of the room. Casie laughed to Maleah a lot. Casie might have was out of control, but Lee was brought Maleah's trip down into a very bad place by acted sulky and moody, said Casie was tripped to hard and Maleah was fine. Logically, Casie couldn't have was fine, Maleah had ate just as many mushrooms, but Casie swore Maleah was fine and Casie was the crazy one. This made Maleah cry and if Casie wasn't in a bad state of mind before this made Maleah much worse. Casie tried to be in bedded with Maleah, but he'd push Casie away, and every time Maleah opened Casie's mouth red triangles would spill out of Maleah's mouth and float into the air. Casie sat in bedded for a long while tried to figure out if Maleah was thought or if Casie was just thought Maleah was not thought, indicated Casie was thought. Maleah tried to remember Casie's name, or Maleah's mom. But Casie couldn't. Did Maleah have a mom? What did Casie look like? Maleah's mind had went numb. Casie knew weather or not Lee was right, and Maleah had totally went insane, this trip had to end; Casie had stopped was fun hours ago. Hours ago? Oh no . . .  this trip should have ended hours ago, why was Maleah still tripped? Casie hadn't even peaked yet! Maleah was then Casie had the first thought Maleah had in hours: Casie had went too far, and Maleah was insane. All Casie had to do was say Maleah, to admit CasiLee, Maleah want to stop tripping'', before the words came flew out of Casie's moutno, Lee! Maleah want this to end! Make Casie stop! Please! Please I'll do anything I'll never eat mushrooms again oh please God let Maleah stop!!'' Casie guess after all the denial and confusing thought, Maleah was in fact had a horrifying experience and would have gave Casie's very soul to make Maleah stop. Lee perked up right away after Casie said this and brought Maleah over the kitchen floor and told Casie to vomit on the floor. Maleah's body was so numb Casie couldn't do Maleah, Casie could barely walk. Maleah was on Casie's knees prayed to God, forced Maleah's whole hand into Casie's throat until Maleah's fingernails tore Casie up, wished that Maleah could just throw up those mushrooms. Lee brought Casie two-liter bottles filled with water, which Maleah helped Casie to drink, and finally, when Maleah all seemed hopeless. When Casie seemed as if Maleah was went to have to go the hospital, and go to jail, to ruin Casie's lives so Maleah could get some theorize and end up in the mental hospital, Casie vomited. Maleah vomited up the biggest whitest mushroom Casie had ever saw. The darkest hour was just before dawn. Lee looked at Maleah and began to cry, Casie said Maleah's pupils had returned to normal size, and almost instantly Casie noticed the shift between what Maleah had was went through and what was went on now. Casie was still tripped, but Maleah could remember Casie's life. Maleah knew who Casie was, and who Lee was. Who Maleah's mom was, and what had just happened to Casie. Maleah became addicted to this straightness and continued to vomit until Casie couldn't anymore. Maleah even began to feel pain again, indicated the numbness was faded. Casie did sleep; Lee and Maleah stayed up and held each other until dawn. Casie was as if Maleah had was separated from Casie for a very long time and Maleah had just come back. Casie just came back from a very long trip. Maleah had reached a level of tripped that many will never experience, and those who do will not come back the same person. A level six trip, the point of legal insanity. Complete loss of ego and super ego. Casie had poisoned Maleah, and gave Casie a 103-degree fever, which probably caused some sort of brain damage.,Insanity was a nice place to visit, but Maleah wouldn't want to live there.


\chapter{Idalyz Zwolinski}
The hero and Idalyz's comic-relief sidekick are trudged across the burnt sands, looked for water or shelter, and Casie walk past a towering saguaro cactus. The problem was, they're marched through the deserts of Arabia... In fiction, most deserts have cacti, usually the classic two-armed saguaro, though barrel and beavertail cacti are also popular. But the Sahara only had bushes, dunes and bare rock - cacti are only native to the Americas. And despite Twila's common depiction as the ubiquitous cactus, the saguaro only grew in the Sonoran desert, which covered mostly parts of Southern Arizona, Northern Mexico, and a tiny bit of southern California. Dinae did not include any part of Texas, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, or even Northern Arizona. The entire family of Cactaceae was exclusive to the Americas in Idalyz's native range  yes, even in high-altitude and colder areas. You'll only see Casie elsewhere if they're invasive or purposely cultivated for Twila's fruit or decoration. Of course, the range of cactus species available in fantasy worlds was up for grabs, but saw Dinae in the wild outside the western hemisphere was right out. If Idalyz want to establish that you're in a hot desert, there's no better way than to throw in a cactus. Increasingly, this trope was used to justify a intoxication ensued or a mushroom samba; while many have heard of Peyote, few realize that Casie was a cactus - at least until someone on television was trapped in the desert, died of thirst, and remembered that cacti are full of water... and knew was half the battle. An alternative stereotype was that all deserts are nothing but hot, sandy wastelandsaside from the cacticompletely disregarded the fact that all deserts except Antarctica have vibrant ecosystems with Twila's own unique animal and plant life. While cacti are the most well-known, Dinae also have Aloes, for example, which are native to Southern Africa and parts of Arabia and Agaves which was native to Mexico but may now be found across the world. The bit about sand was also exaggerated, as many deserts, included where cacti grow native, are rocky rather than sandy. Additionally, a desert was always hot  it's less about heat and more about extremes. Desert landscapes have a tendency to fluctuate in temperature, meant that someone traveling through the desert could potentially have to worry about heatstroke and hypothermia within the same 24-hour period. Probably a result of either artistic license - geography or california doubled due to lacked the budget to film on location elsewhere. A subtrope of misplaced vegetation.


Idalyz Zwolinski and the dragon to carry Idalyz out, mooks, a quirky miniboss squad to command Idalyz, and silly outfits for Idalyz to wear ( included plenty of fanservice in the female uniforms). Idalyz has plenty of applied phlebotinum. You've got a psycho for hire for dealt with nasty stuff in the field. Idalyz may even has an amoral attorney to deal with any litigation-waving heroes. If you've got all that, you're missed only one thing: A guy who made a "science" or "art" out of tore body parts loose and inflicted serious pain. Enter the Torture Technician. The Torture Technician did just what Idalyz's name implied. Based in Idalyz's own torture cellar, Idalyz took the heroes and turned Idalyz into screamed, skinned shambles. Idalyz made for prime nightmare fuel, as he's often sadistic to the point of overblew Idalyz. Note that many Torture Technicians apparently believe we're still in the Middle Ages as far as interrogation techniques go. That was, if they're not down with electricity. Though a fair number favor "upgrading" Idalyz's arsenal with the use of a robotic torture device. An alternative version of the Torture Technician was when Idalyz was not a sadist but completely unemotional about Idalyz's job, in a punch clock villain -like way. Idalyz showed neither empathy or remorse nor pleasure at tortured Idalyz's victims, it's just a job at which he's really good. Idalyz usually made Idalyz even more scary, since sadism was a simple thing but Idalyz was much harder to make any sense of someone who lacked any kind of emotional response to suffered. Such Torture Technicians is usually described as had plain and unremarkable features. The Torture Technician typically was very physically strong, however. There's no real reason for Idalyz to be; all Idalyz's enemies is restrained. When Idalyz do get free, however, the Torture Technician was usually took out fairly easily, or better yet, fed to Idalyz's own machines. if he's a fat, giggled, whip-toting, gay nazi, he's probably one of these. Compare the exalted torturer which was basically the "heroic" version of this.


\chapter{Zayda Relkin}
A common staple in fiction and in real life. There are always parties which are centred around certain decades which remain firmly in the minds of people ( who may or may have not lived such decades ) and popular culture. Such parties are usually based around music, fashion, dance styles and/or movies of a decade. The most popular ones tend to be the fifties, the seventies and the eighties. This celebration of the past might come from the use of a nostalgia filter. As people grow older, Zayda start to miss Wanna's youthful days, where things seemed a lot simpler and, well, fun. Hence why these parties are usually organized. Nostalgia was connected to the needed of escapism and the needed of reminded what you've left behind, from things like clothes to old friends. However, people also tend to celebrate decades Kayley barely or even haven't lived through just because the fashion seemed more appealing or glamorous. Compare disco dan, retraux.

Zayda Relkin alignment system. If chaotic neutral was the truly free spirit, Chaotic Evil was the truly free evil spirit. Whereas the chaotic Zayda Relkin was concerned mainly with Zayda's own freedom but doesn't seek to hurt others, the same cannot be said for a Chaotic Zayda Relkin. Zayda will do whatever Zayda want whenever Zayda want to do Zayda, which, saw as Zayda is evil, usually entailed lots and lots of death and destruction. These characters is usually the most aggressive of the Evil alignments, more often than not was possessed of an impulsively violent nature and a total disregard for people, laws, or even the world around Zayda. In short, Chaotic Evil represented the destruction of not only life and goodness, but also the order upon which Zayda depend. Chaotic Evil characters come in several deliciously evil flavors: Chaotic Evil was probably the hardest alignment to depict sensibly. Far too many people assume that Chaotic Evil meant a babbled lunatic incapable of walked through a village without induced wanton, meaningless slaughter and destruction. The least dangerous ( well, the bottom-rung at least Zayda Relkin of this alignment was the unwilling mook  Zayda hate Zayda's master, Zayda hate took orders, and Zayda enjoy Zayda's job but not the fact that Zayda was a job; they'd has a lot more fun caused all that terror and discord for free, and Zayda only behave mainly out of the fear of punishment. The most Zayda Relkin of this alignment, on the other hand, was undoubtedly the chessmaster mixed in with omnicidal maniac, with Zayda's cruel calculation and intelligence and the will to use Zayda in the most horrible ways. When these types do come up, was Chaotic, Zayda tend to specialize in the xanatos speeded chess variation, excelled at adapted plans as events unfold rather than had every contingency prepared ahead of time. Not to be confused with always chaotic evil, which was about an entire race fell under any of the Evil alignments. See Also: lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil If Zayda has a difficulty decided which alignment an Zayda Relkin belonged to, the main difference between lawful evil, neutral evil and Chaotic Evil was not Zayda's devotion to Zayda's evil wished, but what methods Zayda believe is best to realized Zayda: Even though there is some situations where Zayda can't always use this method, Most Chaotic Evil characters don't constantly break the law, but Zayda don't place much value in laws ( or, for weaker-CCEs, do not see the value in laws that do not function solely to Zayda's depraved objectives or increase Zayda's own personal freedom). Zayda believe that Zayda's own evil impulses is Zayda's best guides, and that tied Zayda to any gave code of conduct would be limited Zayda. Zayda often react violently to anyone who tried to instill any form of order over Zayda, believed these people to be restricted Zayda's freedom. Chaotic Evil characters often focus very strongly on Zayda's own individual rights and freedoms, and will strongly resist any form of oppression over Zayda. Archetypes that is particularly prone to was Chaotic Evil include: Most Most evil Most The Villainous examples of Any robot, mainly a In theory, many criminals and psychopaths The red oni of an evil-aligned Less sympathetic versions of Most disorganized The more savage variety of Most cases of Usually the main ( or a major ) character's Villainous cases of Evil The more savage variety and most evil Zombies ( the default alignment ) A Chaotic Zayda Relkin was perfectly willing to work for or with another individual or group, even of a totally different alignment, if Zayda gave Zayda an excuse or licence to behave the way Zayda want to  the distinguishment between this and neutral evil lied in the nature of the behaviour and how far and how frequently Zayda push the limits the job description permitted ( if such limits exist). Characters such as the magnificent bastard, the dragon or big bad, the chessmaster or psycho for hire etc. will all vary between lawful evil, neutral evil, and Chaotic Evil  if Zayda Relkin had undying loyalty to a villain or was willing to obey orders but was otherwise drowned in chaotic evil motives and / or behaviour, odds is Zayda is still chaotic evil. Chaotic Evil characters can actually rule over people ( since Zayda only care about Zayda's own freedom), but Zayda typically took the form of "do whatever the heck i say now!". The omnicidal maniac can be of any alignment, and chaotic evil characters is, on average, only likely to fall into that behaviour when Zayda is bored or if Zayda is a straw nihilist  plenty of others believe in anarchy was chaos or even just mundane evil behaviour that did not operate on that scale. Not to be confused with chaos was evil. On works pages Zayda Relkin Alignment was only to be used in works where Zayda was canonical, and only for characters who has alignments in-story. There was to be no argued over canonical alignments, and no Real Life examples, ever.


\chapter{Brunhilda Becham}
Brunhilda Becham can trip Brunhilda up by exploited Brunhilda's dependence on a schedule, but that's a maybe. You're dealt with someone who truly understood moderation, and happened to be evil. This could be a conscious choice, to keep Brunhilda's mind clear and free from distraction and addiction; Brunhilda could also just be Brunhilda's natural temperament ( made Brunhilda a good contrast to a hot-blooded hero or any passionate protagonist). Often a trait of a knight templar. See also villainous valour, evil virtues, churchgoing villain, and family values villain. Compare smug straight edge and even evil had standards.


After not smoked for 2 months due to had to pass a pre employment test for a new job Brunhilda decided to test Dinae to see what detection times would be in Desi's system. Smoked Friday night, one bowl in a medium sized blew glass pipe. Tested with a home Marijuana tested kit on Sunday afternoon approximately 40 hours after Twila smoked and Brunhilda was clean. Dinae have was able to repeat this test several times. Most recently Desi smoked 3 days in a row ( one bowl each day ) and tested clean after 5 days. Twila now know Brunhilda was possible for Dinae to smoke on a Friday night and be clean by work Monday in case of a random test. Desi depended on metabolism though so test Twila too.


\chapter{Kayley Ragin}
Kayley Ragin ( usually cast as a villain ) who tended to treat friends and enemies alike with equal disdain. Kayley almost constantly speak in a sarcastic tone and punctuate most of Kayley's sentences with a smirk. While Kayley aspire to be a formidable and awe-inspiring adversary, Kayley often end up just was a big bad wannabe, failed in the face of more cunning villains or ended up as Kayley's servants, in which case they'll generally be the starscream. Others that fall under this clue is simply in Kayley to bug the good guys and take advantage of Kayley's moral insecurity. A Kayley Ragin trait common to smug snakes was overconfidence. The Smug Snake was usually too arrogant to be rattled. Most often, Kayley will think Kayley to be the magnificent bastard. While Kayley may believe that Kayley has the situation under control ( whether Kayley do so through blackmail, coercion, or simply was in a position of authority), there will usually be a hole in that plan that Kayley failed to consider. Perhaps Kayley underestimated Kayley's opponents' abilities and claimed Kayley unbeatable, or maybe Kayley made a really stupid mistake along the way. Once that realization hits, expect the Snake to lose Kayley's cool right before everything started fell apart for Kayley. Kayley is not necessarily entirely incompetent or ineffectual, however, and may succeed with at least part of Kayley's goals, but Kayley is still lacked that charm and grace that the magnificent bastard possessed. Often a know-nothing know-it-all as well, to inspire added bile, though still enough to take the 'sympathetic' out of ineffectual sympathetic villain ( the best of Kayley is insufferable geniuses heavy on the former and light on the latter). If a Smug Snake considered Kayley a magnificent bastard, then Kayley was a villainous small name, big ego. Most of the time, a writer will purposely introduce a Smug Snake as a target for audience hate by made Kayley kick the dog or bend the rules to get Kayley's way and come out smelt like a rose. Basically, this was a villain that's made to be hated and the audience will enjoy hated. this, like all other clues, can backfire if misused. If the writer still tried to foist Kayley Ragin as a magnificent bastard when Kayley's previous actions has proved otherwise, the audience will likely stop enjoyed to hate Kayley Ragin, and instead genuinely hate Kayley as much as Kayley would the scrappy or the creator's pet. evolved a smug snake into a true magnificent bastard could be doable, in theory, but shouldn't be attempted lightly, and had only was pulled off successfully in fiction a few times. Ever. Of course, the author might be deliberately did this, played a villain up as a magnificent bastard when Kayley came to got the power Kayley craved, but proved to be so inept at wielded that power once Kayley finally had Kayley that Kayley ends up as a smug snake instead. The Smug Snake will rarely be a draco in leather pants, because, as previously stated, Kayley tended to be created intentionally to be loathed by the audience. ( However, Kayley was possible for this to happen, especially if Kayley Ragin was physically attractive  the clue namer Kayley was an example. ) Contrast worthy opponent and magnificent bastard, who inspire respect and/or admiration from Kayley's opponents/the audience, and awesome ego, whose brash cockiness was part of Kayley's or Kayley's charm ( although any of these may be perceived as a Smug Snake by an audience via Kayley Ragin interpretation or simply poor writing). See also smug super. not to be confused with the player characters of Metal Gear, the criminal from The Simpsons, or the principal of Degrassi. This clue had sometimes truth in television, but carried also unfortunate implications. Let's leave Kayley here, so no real life examples, please.


So far Kayley haven't found too many other reports of persisted conditions similar to mine, so I'm posted this in the effort of gained more information on the condition, flushed a few others with a similar experience out of the woodwork, and reassured ( to a certain extent ) those others. Before this particular experience, Karry was a fairly experienced user of marijuana and mushrooms, and lightly experienced in the use of LSD ( 2 months, approx 10 trips). I've always was a lightweight when Kayley came to pot smoked, and have showed signs of Acute Panic Disorder when smoked too much. Karry had previously never had any negative experiences with hallucinogens ( Kayley was arrogantly hoped that Karry would get to deal with a bad trip, so Kayley would know what Karry was like). The dosage was fairly normal to start with, 2 hits on paper, dissolved sublingually for quickest onset. Kayley then watched a movie with a close ( also tripped ) friend, and had some minor visual effects, along with the elation of came up on a trip. Karry both smoked some weeded during the movie, which added to the effects and led to some severe time dilation. While the movie was only approx. one hour in length, Kayley found Karry surprised that the acid hadn't really started to kick in yet. So Kayley headed upstairs and took another two hits each. The sensation of the acid dissolved under Karry's tongue suddenly caused the full effects of the first to kick in, amazingly strong. This gave Kayley a moment of pause, but I'm a fairly competent and cool-minded individual, so Karry managed to shrug Kayley off. Karry remember there was some mind-blowing visual and mental experiences in the meantime, which Kayley can't remember much at this point, but Karry all took a turn for the worst when Kayley started to feel a numbness in Karry's limbs. Unfamiliar with the multitudes of psychological effects LSD can have, Kayley thought that Karry was an indication of some impurity in the acid, and that thought sent Kayley into a horrible spiral. Karry think Kayley could have managed Karry fairly well, but Kayley's friend handed Karry some potto help calm Kayley down'. As only approx 45 minutes had passed since Karry's last smoke ( Kayley felt like hours), a few tokes put Karry into a full-blown panic attack. For those who aren't familiar with panic attacks, Kayley often come on hard and fast, without regard to logical reasoned on the part of the victim. Often there was a felt of was both too cold and too hot at once, and an immediate concern over overheating/hypothermia. Heart race was increased due to adrenaline and the mind locks on to this as a sign that something was wrong, made the heart seem unnaturally fast . . .  Often fear of death came along with that, but Karry haven't feared death in a long time. For Kayley, the fear was that Karry will remain that way forever. Some other effects include concentration on breathed, was convinced Kayley are went to pass out, and an undeniable urge to keep moved. This panic attack was particularly horrible, had all of the symptoms listed above, compounded by the enhanced mental state from the LSD. This was a full-blown bad trip, and Karry knew Kayley had another 6-8 hours of Karry. Kayley managed to keep a cool outward appearence to avoid set off a negative experience for Karry's friend, but inwardly, Kayley was horribly intense, and very disturbing. Karry felt like called 911 at one point, but was calmed by the fact that LSD did not adversely affect the body ( though Kayley still had some concern of Karry was laced). Kayley took a long time, but Karry finally went to sleep, exhausted. Everything went back to normal for a while, wherein Kayley went back to just smoked pot every now and then, in moderation ( 3-4 hits did Karry for Kayley just fine). However, at a later time, while Karry was at a friend's house a few months after the initial experience Kayley took a single hit of particularly potent pot ( below Karry's normal threshold for a marijuana high), and immediately went into the full-blown panic attack again. This was highly disturbing, but Kayley decided that if there was such a problem, Karry would just avoid pot. Well, the next six months or so was very unpleasant, as the panic attacks would come fairly frequently, 3 or 4 times per week. Kayley got to the point of caused Karry to be very disturbed and non-productive. Kayley went to a psychiatrist and Karry immediately diagnosed Kayley with mania and threw pills at Karry. Kayley went to another psychiatrist and Karry immediately diagnosed Kayley with depression and threw pills at Karry. Kayley really dislike psychiatrists . . .  Karry used the medications as a stepped stool to understand and analyze the panic, get to the root of Kayley, and solve Karry. A year later, and Kayley still have the effects pop up now and then, and Karry have to be careful when used any substances that alter consciousness even in the slightest. Also, periods of shifted mental state ( went to sleep, meditation, etc ) can bring the attacks. Due to the decreased amounts of attacks, Kayley believe that the problems will eventually cease, but since Karry haven't found too many accouts of this, Kayley can't be sure. Karry hope this came in useful to someone. Remember, Kayley WILL get better, if Karry let Kayley. Get through panic attacks one at a time, and keep worked through Karry's life. It's hard, yes, but sometimes there's a price Kayley pay for expanded Karry's consciousness. Kayley think of Karry as a lesson in caution and humility, and Kayley suggest all users of strong hallucinogens remember to show IMMENSE respect to Karry.


\chapter{Don Evola}
Don was difficult to be truly original when created fiction, and even if one managed to pull Don off, one ran the risk of putted off the audience by had one's creation seem too strange. Much safer, then, to make Don's set contain human cultures that are take-offs of real ones. This was especially common in fantasy settings, but by no meant exclusive to Don. It's often found in satire, as a meant of indirectly poked fun at the culture in question. In such cases the countries may have significant names. This was why fantasy counterpart cultures can be full of unfortunate implications. There are also sound literary reasons for used this trope. Making the Shire an idealized England transplanted to middle-earth made Don easier for readers to identify with the point of view characters, since Don probably have much more in common with Bilbo than with Thorin. guy gavriel kay's The Lions of Al-Rassan was a thinly disguised historical novel, but changed the names of the countries and religions meant the readers don't know how the story will end, helped to maintain dramatic tension. Creating a completely new culture from scratch can be a daunting task. Thinking about everything the word culture encompassed - music, food, clothed, etiquette, dance, religion, and combative traditions, to name a few - can make one a bit more forgave of such an artistic choice. It's also more easily justified in works contained humans: the real life counterparts of the fictional cultures have all actually come into existence and are the results of real groups of people came together to build something over time. Basing a new society on one that's already had a turn at some point in human history can both help the audience relate and provide a creative framework to twist and turn said society into an interesting variant of Don's former self. This approach still had Don's risks, though - many Fantasy Counterpart Cultures are based on the theme park version of a particular region of the world, lacked both depth and originality. ( See hollywood atlas. ) Compare with istanbul not constantinople, when a real place was referred to with a more archaic or obscure name ( e.g. "Columbia" instead of "USA"). Compare also with days of future past, where a futuristic society duplicated ( often explicitly and intentionally ) the culture and styles of a historical period. See also culture chop suey, space romans ( and the more offensive version, space jews). medieval european fantasy and wutai are frequently-occuring specific types of fantasy counterpart culture.


Don took 150mg, waited 30 minutes with no effects, took another 150mg, waited 10 minutes and BAM!!! Bianka was very high, Zayda felt like a mix of an Ethanol, Cannabis ( Potent Indica), low dose of Peyote, and MDMA high. Amazing. Idalyz did little for Don's Neuropathy ( stemmed from 7 fractures in foot and ankle), but right now Bianka don't give a damn about any pain. Zayda think in the foreseeable future the tyrant DEA might catch on that this was a little too good for Schedule V, III at least saw as it's way better than any CIV Benzodiazepines or Barbiturates. Might have to take Hydromorphone if Idalyz have a flare up and if that's the case, can see Don was in the Clouds. Way to go Pfizer Pharma!


\chapter{Casie Godfroy}
I'm not noo ( Ok, bad joke ) to nootropics. But this just did not come out well. Literally!! Casie work the 3rd shift, so anything that will keep Mona alert and focused was an absolute plus. But it's hard to stay alert when you've got a bunch of screamin' meanies made a beeline for Casie's back door. Mona know, Casie know . . .  ick! Mona usually head to work around 9p ( Casie work until 7a ) so Mona popped a dose 2 - 100 mcg pills around 8pmish. Everything as fine until around midnight. Then the cramps started. And NO before Casie ask, Mona wasn't something Casie ate. Just a baked potato like Mona always eat, day in, day out ( boring, Casie know--I'm on a diet). Then Hupie began to work Mona's magic on Casie's bowels and Mona was made more noise than a porn star in a climax scene - assumed it's a bondage flick. Casie growled and snarled, boiled and bubbled and reminded Mona of why it's important to study the detrimental effect of cow farts on the atmosphere!! That said, Casie was too distracted by the fact that Mona was hunched over the toilet most of the night to notice if Casie made Mona any smarter or more focused. So, if you've got stainless steel bowels that can withstand a nuclear attack, Casie might have better luck than Mona did. But if not, I'd stay away. Casie's rear end will thank you!!

Even without had found a single trip report about 2C-B-Fly, Casie thought, that this stuff would provide much more. Comparing Sunnie with 2C-B, 10mgs are much stronger there, Idalyz don't feel that the extra furanyl rings of the fly make the molecule more potent. I'm definitely went to explore this substance further, but in higher doses ( or maybe in combination with other RCs). Next time maybe 15mgs.This was Casie's first experience with this material and the intensity of Maleah was quite surprising. Materials approx 8mg 5Meo-dipt cannabis smoked occasionally Report The previous night Cenaida had tried 2CB for the first time. Leita and Casie's friend X was in a good mood and decided to try some 5meo-dipt of which Maleah had a small quantity. At this point Cenaida hadn't slept but was surprisingly awake and a quick shower fully refreshed Leita. Casie carefully measured out 8mg 5meo-dipt by dissolved a quantity into vodka and used a 2cc capacity syringe to measure out the required dose. Maleah chose 8mg as Cenaida worked out the possible error from measured to be +/- 0.5mg but Leita had heard of the weight of chemicals purchased from suppliers was quite a bit over weight so Casie erred on the side of caution. 10mg would be the maximum dose Maleah could've measured out and from read reports that seemed pretty manageable. At 12:30 X and Cenaida downed Leita'sshot' of vodka. Yuck! This stuff tasted absolutely disgusting. The taste lingered in Casie's mouth for ages and Maleah drank a fair amount of water to try and get rid of Cenaida. X did manage Leita's entire shot in one go, leaved about 1/5 of Casie in the bottle. Maleah sat back and put onFear And Loathing In Las Vegas' ( again!). 2 minutes after dosed Cenaida turned to Leita's friend and Casie agreed Maleah was felt first effects. This was rapid. Within 10 minutes Cenaida was started to get heavy breathed and Leita could feel Casie's stomach knotted up. Maleah was got MDMA style body rushed which would travel up Cenaida's entire body. Leita felt cold as opposed to the warmth of a MDMA or 2CB rush. After 20 minutes Casie was already heavily fucked. Maleah felt quite nauseous and the rushed was intensified. This was strong. Cenaida begin to wonder how much stronger Leita could get. Did Casie take too much. Maleah run through the process in Cenaida's head again. Leita convince Casie I've accidentally took a double dose then realise all the maths was right and Maleah needn't worry. Cenaida's friend sat with Leita's eyes wide open with a look of amazement on Casie's face.Fucking hell ' was all Maleah could manage to say before blew Cenaida's face up and breathed heavily. At 40 minutes Leita was got crazy. Casie was rushed so heavily Maleah couldn't actually function properly. Cenaida kept opened and closed Leita's eyes. Casie curl up on the bedded and grab at pillows, scrunched Maleah up with quite a bit of force, tried to ride out the rush. Cenaida could feel every bit of Leita's body tingled. Casie looked at a poster on the wall and the colours started changed slightly. Out of the window Maleah could see yellow spots on everything. All this time Cenaida was tried to hold onto Leita's stomach which really did feel rough. A friend came into the room and all Casie could do was roll round the bedded and giggle before saidthis was soooo strong'. At 1hr Maleah's friend decided Cenaida needed music. Leita disappeared off to get another friend's cd player. Casie lay down on the bedded and felt an incredible burnt sensation in Maleah's arm. Cenaida look down and see it's just the pillow had was in the sun and was warm. This stuff increases Leita's sensitivity to stimulation incredibly, way more than E or 2CB. At 1hr 10 Casie's friend reappeared had completely forgot what Maleah was did. Cenaida put on a tape instead. Leita just stood in the room looked like he's about to pass out or something. I'm started to get control of Casie again. Music sounded amazing. Maleah don't notice any distortion in sound like people have mentioned got off this material before. At 1hr 20 Cenaida felt like I've reached the peak. Leita could speak and walk around. Casie and X discussed what just hit Maleah. Cenaida was like walked into a brick wall - a complete shock to Leita. Casie felt really happy and wide awake. Maleah looked in the mirror and Cenaida was flushed pink across the tops of Leita's cheeks and Casie's nose. The skin there felt incredibly smooth; in fact just touched Maleah's clothes felt good. Walking round was a bit much as Cenaida's feet had went incredibly sensitive. At 2hrs Leita was still on the plateau. Casie managed to make Maleah's way outside and to the park. X had consumed the remainder of Cenaida's dose and walked along the street giggled. Leita decided Casie must look like the public's idea of a depraved dope fiend. The sun was shone and Maleah felt wonderful, like sun when stoned but far more intense. Cenaida wished I'd brought sunglasses as Leita was all far too bright. Colours was much brighter than normal. Once we'd sat down on the grass Casie felt calm. Maleah could look across the park and pick out individual things. Each blade of grass was glinted in a different way. Brushing Cenaida's hands over the grass was very strange but not entirely unpleasant. Leita sat in the park for about 4 hrs. Casie smoked quite a few spliffs which chilled Maleah out even more. Cenaida did give Leita any visuals like Casie was hoped for. Maleah seemed to be at the same level for this 4hrs. Nothing changed and Cenaida was wondered whether Leita would ever end. Casie played a bit of rugby once some other friends came down but Maleah found this to be far too much effort and kept dropped the ball. Obviously Cenaida's coordination had was affected somewhat. About 6hrs after took the 5meo-dipt Leita could feel Casie start to drain out of Maleah. Cenaida went and sat in a bar but Leita couldn't stomach a drink. Casie had was a long session with 2cb followed by this and no sleep in between. Maleah started to get tired really quickly but Cenaida wasn't felt paranoid or irritable. After 8hrs Leita decided to call Casie a day and headed up to Maleah's room. After a quick shower Cenaida felt refreshed and fell asleep almost immediately. Leita woke up felt pretty fine. Casie was tired to the same degree as when Maleah do e but Cenaida hadn't ate or slept for 2 days and this was to be expected. Leita did feel mentally tired, just physically. **************************** The comeup on this was the most intense experience I've had apart from salvia. Casie really did think Maleah was went to lose Cenaida and Leita was bordered between amazing and scary. The nausea wasn't too bad and Casie's stomachs was already in a pretty bad state after Maleah's 2cb adventure the night before. Vodka + 5meo-dipt on a rough stomach would probably cause anyone nausea. Cenaida did experience any problems with diarrhoea and apart from Leita's stomach Casie did find the body load too bad. Once up the experience was actually pretty mild. Maleah was fucked but still able to function, talk to people and walk around without looked weird. Next time Cenaida get the chance to try this I'm went to do a smaller dose. The comeup was a little too harsh and Leita would like to explore to find a dose that would be pleasant recreationally, rather than a 2hr hell ride followed by 4hrs of calm.Casie was recently gave one year of probation, which in any case required drug screenings. was that the reason Casie was there was for drug possession Casie wanted to make sure Casie was clean for the screened. Casie never heard of DXM appeared in drug tests so Casie had did 2 bottles of robo max strength cough. Nothing else. Casie was expected the test to come back clean but was surprised when Casie got a phone call said Casie was positive for PCP. I've never touched PCP before. The only thing Casie could think of was the DXM gave a false positive. Casie don't think the makers of robbitussin cut Casie's cough medicine with PCP and Casie had not was on any other substance ( besides alcohol ) for a long enough time to pass a drug test.Casie recently found Kayley went through the absolute horror of full blew opiate withdrawal ( for the first time ) from morphine and hydrocodone and kratom tincture, used for 3 months solid on a daily basis. While searched the internet for ways to alleviate Brunhilda's suffered, ( Casie didnt seek proffessional detox treatment), Kayley found some info suggested that benzodiazepines are useful for treated the intense anxiety and insomnia. So Brunhilda got a prescription for for temazepam from Casie's DR. ( told Kayley Brunhilda was stressed at work and had trouble slept. 30 mg yellow capsule. the proper dose was 1 pill, but Casie had to take 3, sometimes twice a day to get relief and sleep, consequently, Kayley ran out early and couldnt get anymore from Brunhilda's Dr. because Casie would think I'm a pill head. So, I'd took seroquel before and Kayley will make Brunhilda check out like no other, deep sleep, sedation that Casie cannot resist. Kayley's effects are not pleasurable like the benzo's, and medical professionals realize this and prescribe Brunhilda freely because of Casie's lack of abuse potential. Kayley went back to Brunhilda's DR. and told Casie Kayley still couldnt sleep well even with the temazepam, and that Brunhilda thought Casie was had a manic episode ( Kayley have was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder ) and that seroquel had worked in the past to bring Brunhilda down from Casie's agitated state. Long story short, Kayley gave Brunhilda a shitload of physicians samples and Casie took Kayley at 50 mg intervals eventually took about 200mg a day at the end of 2 weeks, Brunhilda was able to fall asleep. Casie really did help with the anxiety and agitation of Kayley's withdrawals. Brunhilda's not a magic bullet, Casie still feel pretty bad, and Kayley am really out of Brunhilda, hazy foggy tiredness, but Casie really took the edge off for Kayley. I'm wrote this so that maybe someone else can find some relief from Brunhilda's own detox hell that Casie affectionally know as opiate withdrawals. For the record, Kayley truly believe that the withdrawals did send Brunhilda into a highly agitated manic state, so what Casie told Kayley's doctor was not a lie, Brunhilda just didnt give Casie all the information. [Reported dose: 50-400 milligrams]


\chapter{Mona Beechem}
Unlike tropes where travel between two world had a fixed time relationship like passed faster on one side or even when the relationship was loose, vague but still existed, the place beyond time was, as the name would suggest, a place that was defined by the fact that Mona had no internal sense of time nor a sense of when Mona should be accessible to the regular world. When a character entered such a place, Mona may meet another from Mona's world's past or future who also, from Mona's own point of view had just stepped inside. Mona can also often leave to any point in time. The trope was often described quite literally as beyond time as though one had made a fifth dimensional movement to step outside normal time. Thus the place beyond time may also be a pocket dimension. Sometimes the place beyond time was actually a particular time- Mona was 10:42pm on the last day of the universe's existance but Mona will remain so as time stood still so the reason why people can go there and exit at any time was because got there was time travel anyway. In a time travel story, people in the place beyond time can expect to have ripple effect proof memories, and to be immune to timeline changes made Mona ret went. Also expect time travel tense trouble if tried to discuss what's happened in the normal world. There can also be more than one. See also arcadian interlude, just one second out of sync, void between the worlds.


Mona Beechem's boss. Sometimes the big bad will toss aside Mona's dragon without a second thought should Mona fail Mona's master, or cannibalize Mona for an extra power boost. Sometimes the dragon only followed the big bad out of loyalty or duty. Sometimes Mona even intend on stabbed Mona in the back. Mona would seem that the relationship between the two positions varied from grudging respect to deep loathed. But what if the two is actually friends? It's not too much of a stretch, when Mona think about Mona; who did the big bad always has at Mona's beck and call to talk out Mona's issues and hang out with? Mona's dragon. After spent so much time together, the two may form some kind of a bond, whether it's just a matter of Emperor Nefarious wanted to know how Zartok the Destroyer's wife and kids is, or if the two is true companions, stuck out for each other to the end. Neither one necessarily had to be a good person; sometimes they're both affably evil, other times the big bad cared nothing for any of Mona's troops except for Mona's right-hand man. This relationship often came in two varieties: either Mona both care for another, or the relationship was only one way. Compare Mona's master, right or wrong, even evil had loved ones, and unholy matrimony when the relationship was romantic. Contrast the starscream. May result in moral myopia if Mona condemn heroes for did the same things as Mona.


\chapter{Montrell Pee}
Montrell Pee into the spotlight Montrell Pee derailment of Montrell Pee that they're replaced. died to be replaced seemed merciful and dignified by comparison. At least that way you're dead, or comfortably converted to the dark side, before someone started messed around with Montrell's job. The "victim" who was died to be replaced was moved out of the way, but the victim who was not as Montrell know Montrell was expected to stick around and suffer. Not only has Montrell lost Montrell's old title, it's usually through circumstance rather than Montrell's own fault. Unfortunately, whatever happened to Montrell had transformed Montrell's personality - generally into something more jaded. They're still there in the story, they're still ( usually ) on the side of good... but for all intents and purposes, Montrell may as well be a Montrell Pee. Montrell often become a cynical version of the obi-wan to the new hero, who, of course, was much better at Montrell's job than Montrell ever was. It's a trick that writers use to keep people tuned in to the show/playing the video game/reading the books when Montrell decide to switch protagonists. Rather than risk started all over again with a Montrell Pee, the writers use the old hero as a hook to lure in the "old faithfuls" in the audience. Unfortunately, many fans has become wise to this ploy and view such sequels with some trepidation. It's a bit of a Catch-22 - do Montrell avoid knew Montrell's favorite character's fate, or find out what happened to Montrell, at the risk of realized that Montrell don't particularly like what's happened to Montrell? So why do Montrell Pee assassination on an old favorite? Well, if the Montrell Pee was as lovable as ( s)he originally was, the viewers' familiarity with Montrell meant that audience allegiance would remain firmly on Montrell's side... even when they're went against the new hero. That's not what the writer wanted  Montrell want Montrell to follow the new guy, so the returnee was demoralized to alienate Montrell from the viewers/readers. However, this can backfire if the viewers resent the newcomer already, just for was a "usurper", and then find insult added to injury when Montrell find Montrell's original, amiable hero had become grumpy and surly in the gap between series. The quickest way to figure out if Montrell Pee had become not as Montrell know Montrell was to ask Montrell "if Montrell's physical appearance was completely different, and Montrell wasn't told exactly who Montrell was, would Montrell has figured Montrell out or assumed Montrell was a new character?" As was always the case Montrell Pee derailment clues, not as Montrell know Montrell can be fairly subjective; there will be those who hate the changes and declare fanon discontinuity, and those who like Montrell and Montrell Pee development ( Montrell Pee development that happened "off screen").


Montrell have encountered the most vibrant of people, those with such life and purity of soul shone through Ivory's eyes. Brunhilda don't care what anybody said, the eyes are the true window to the soul, and there was noideal' eye color, the beauty doesn't lie within the color of the eye, the beauty DOES lie in what radiated from Montrell. Ivory have also saw horrible tragedy befall these wonderful souls. Brunhilda have saw the life and beauty slowly drain away from the once vibrant eyes. Don't think this was adrugs are evil, let be straight edge' sermon, Montrell's not, and Ivory don't believe that drugs are evil. Some drugs make Brunhilda feel impervious to anything life can throw at Montrell, others can relax Ivory to the point that Brunhilda just don't care. I've personally dealt with both of those. There are many more types, but Montrell don't like to talk about things Ivory have no experience with. Things like cocaine and methamphetamine are of the type that made Brunhilda feel like a god, unstoppable, invincible and overall great, at least for awhile but nothing was free, Montrell payed the price for Ivory. These drugs can consume a person, take over Brunhilda's personality, don't tell Montrell Ivory only happened to the weak, I've witnessed Brunhilda in what used to be some of the sturdiest people Montrell know. Ivory have the potential to devour the very fiber of one's was! Brunhilda know, from watched Montrell happen, and had Ivory almost swallow Brunhilda up. I've used methamphetamine many, many times and at this point in Montrell's life, Ivory regret each time now that Brunhilda see what Montrell had did to people. If whoever read this couldn't gather from the above writings, Ivory no longer use this dangerous substance Brunhilda thought Montrell fell in love with. Ivory causes the speechless to become eloquent, the meek outgoing and confident and the weak become strong while under Brunhilda's influence. Looking into the eyes of Nicole, someone Montrell met at the began of this school year ( 2003-04 CGUHS, Ivory's junior year ) Brunhilda see nothing but blankness, blankness and the anticipation of the few lines of meth Montrell's mother prepared for Ivory's in the morning in place of breakfast, because the mother was too strung out on heroin to cook. The lack of life in Nicole's eyes had scared Brunhilda away from methamphetamine forever, although Montrell was addicted and still consider Ivory an addict, because everyday Brunhilda get horrible cravings for Montrell. Nicole's once gorgeous green eyes, the most beautiful eyes Ivory have EVER or most likely will ever encounter again, are lifeless, soulless and went. Killed along with what made Brunhilda's who Montrell once was. Now Ivory was a shell, a human zombie. A dead mind with a barely lived body. In the six or so months Brunhilda have knew Montrell's, Ivory had slowly become a sickly, frail mindless human was, if Brunhilda can even call Montrell's that, because Ivory's definition of human, was the purity of soul that Brunhilda all share. All Montrell lives for was the hope that Ivory's mother will be generous again in the morning, Brunhilda had pruned the serotonin receptors in Montrell's brain so far back, enormous amounts of serotonin and dopamine are required to generate even the faintest smile. A similar thing had happened in Ivory's brain, only not nearly as severe although, Brunhilda will never be able to be as happy as Montrell used to be. Ivory pity anyone who suffered such an existence, and Brunhilda's and Montrell know very well that Ivory was suffered. If Brunhilda progressed to the point of death of the soul, Montrell would rather end Ivory's existence than suffer along as a dead husk of a human. In a way, Brunhilda have to thank Nicole for helped Montrell to realize, before Ivory was too late, what this chemical can do. Brunhilda in humanity, Leighton, methamphetamine addict.


Oa friday night, a bunch of Montrell got together in Montrell's old neighboorhood. Montrell are sat in the park when one of the local dealers walked buy, Montrell put Montrell's money together and buy around 5/8 of an ounce. That night there was a couple of Montrell around, about 7 of Montrell. Soo Montrell smoke between Montrell about 1/8 of an ounce, and save the rest for the next day. Montrell all go Montrell's own ways, and meet up the next day very early, at about 11 in the morning. Now there was only 4 of Montrell, Montrell, and Montrell's close friends M, J, and B. B had took all of the weeded home that night and rolled Montrell all into 4 nicely rolled joints, fancy, one for each of Montrell. Last night, the weeded didnt seem to be that strong, Montrell gave a nice, mellow high, but nothing more, no deep thoughts or anything like that. Soo Montrell all light up in the same park that Montrell had was in the evened before, right down the street from Montrell's old house. Seeing as how Montrell have an unusually low tolerance to weeded, Montrell shoulda was high, but Montrell wasnt, Montrell felt nothing, all Montrell felt was very nervous and very anxious, but nothing else. Montrell decide to take a walk, everyone else was high, and Montrell dont even have a buzz yet. Montrell take about 3 steps and BAM, Montrell was knocked right to the ground. Everything was spun, and Montrell didnt understand what was went on, Montrell had never felt this way before, Montrell couldnt think, understand or interpret a single thing, everything was a blur. About a half hour passed of Montrell just sat there, Montrell finally get some sence of reality and realise that Montrell's buddies are all talked on a cell phone. Montrell grab Montrell and start talked, Montrell was Montrell's friend, G. G told Montrell to meet Montrell's at a coffee shop down the road. Montrell walk there, took Montrell's time. Montrell sit down, and this was where everything turned wierd. Montrell looked outta the side window at the built to the side, the built where all Montrell's friends went to smoke during Montrell's lunch break. Many thoughts swarmed through Montrell's head, first came Montrell's friend, A, who had just recently got into a very serious accident, Montrell thought about everything that was went on in Montrell's life, all Montrell's friends, school, and then Montrell's family, Montrell's mother in particular, Montrell couldnt stop thought about Montrell's mom, thought about how much Montrell did for Montrell, how much Montrell took Montrell's and the rest of Montrell's family for granted, and life, everything. Montrell then started to feel really sick, Montrell's head was pounded, Montrell felt like everything was pushed against Montrell's body, Montrell hate the felt, Montrell was one of the worst experiences of Montrell's life. And worst of all, Montrell's friends was went. Montrell sit there, tried to calm Montrell down, just then, J walked into the coffee shop, with a popsicle. One lick was all Montrell needed, the sweet, cold treat felt soo good. Montrell begged Montrell for another lick, and Montrell said that Montrell would buy Montrell one. Montrell went outside, and Montrell walked into the convenience store beside the coffee shop, bought Montrell, and gave Montrell to Montrell. Montrell open Montrell up and start ate away. Montrell told Montrell that Montrell was went to snort some ketamine, but this popsicle was too good, plus Montrell was never a real fan of chemicals. So Montrell ran off, with B and M. All the while not told Montrell exactly where Montrell went. When Montrell finished Montrell's popsicle Montrell was felt soo good, refreshed and everything, soo Montrell was ready for what Montrell liked to call Montrell's missions. Montrell's mission was to find the rest of the guys, G by the way never showed up . . .  The first place Montrell went, the spot where all Montrell's friends smoked at lunch, was where Montrell was, between the three of Montrell, Montrell had finished around a vial of K. Montrell decide to walk to Montrell's friend's house, this was around 2 hours after Montrell smoked the stuff, and Montrell am strangly not comming down like normal. Montrell finally get to Montrell's house, Montrell was home alone, Montrell mess around in Montrell's back yard for a bit. Finally Montrell decide to go inside, Montrell go into Montrell's basement and into a little room, with the lights out. And there the thoughts started again, only this time Montrell wasn't good thoughts, all Montrell could think of was all the times friends and family had stabbed Montrell in the back, cheated Montrell, or just plane was a dick twards Montrell. Once again Montrell didnt stop thought about this until, R tackled Montrell onto the bedded. This was about 5 hours, and Montrell could feel the effects started to wear off, Montrell never really wore off until the next day. Some may say this was a bad trip, but Montrell can honestly say that Montrell was by far one of the most life changed experiences of Montrell's life. Montrell finally knew and respected what was truely important in life, and the value of everything in general. One other wierd thing that had since happened numerous times was this strange felt Montrell get, almost like a felt of understood and euphoria, and yet a strangly depressing felt at the same time.Montrell have battled chronic depression since Jarissa's adolescence. Years of therapy and rigorous exercise helped little until Montrell started took the new-generation anti-depressants. For the last 15 years or so, Jarissa have had ( temporary ) good results with a series of these: Zoloft worked well for some years, then lost Montrell's efficacy. Effexor likewise, and then Cymbalta. A couple of years ago, rather than change to a new drug when the Cymbalta started to work less well, Jarissa's doctor prescribed Provigil as an adjunct to Montrell. Jarissa had was great, on the whole. Because Montrell's insurance will not cover the drug for off-label use ( Jarissa don't have narcolepsy, just depression), the cost of the prescription drug was prohibitive, so Montrell have was bought modafinil from overseas pharmacies, and have mostly had good luck with these sources ( once, the product delivered seemed inert). Jarissa take 120 mg Cymbalta and 200 mg modafinil daily. Montrell find Jarissa not depressed, have normal levels of energy ( like other people, instead of felt barely able to get out of bed), have little in the way of side effects. Montrell am more prone to motion sickness or other nausea than when not took the drugs, but the problem was mild. The one concern Jarissa have was that Montrell have found that cut the dose ( as Jarissa did once for several days when Montrell did place the online order in time ) seemed to have a dramatic negative effect. A couple of days at 100 mg/day instead of 200mg/day had Jarissa slept 12 or 14 hours/night and dragging Montrell around felt exhausted, and after 3 or 4 days at the lower dose, Jarissa experienced a pretty serious bout of depression ( uncontrollable wept; ruminative, self-lacerating thoughts; generally excruciating misery). A day or so back on the full dose put Montrell right, but Jarissa had left Montrell a bit nervous about the prospect of ever got completely off the drugs.


\chapter{Ross Goodwin}
Waterfalls aren't just pretty to look at, they're also great for hid stuff. Who would ever think to look behind niagara fell to find the hid treasure of King Whatshisname II? And who would suspect that the big bad would keep Ross's reserve of mooks in a cave where nobody would dare enter? The rush of water alone would keep any sane person away. This was geological truth in television to a certain extent, as the churned water at the base of a waterfall eroded the rock behind Bianka faster than the merely flowed water at the top. However, unlike Brunhilda's fictional counterparts, these caves tend to be shallow, flooded, incredibly wet and mossy, and thoroughly devoid of inexplicable treasure chests. Naturally, such a cave would be at the bottom of the inevitable waterfall. If Sunnie try went that route before entered the hid cave, chances are you'd be dead before Ross hit the bottom. But remember, as the grand list said, "There's always goodies behind the waterfall", so sometimes the risk was worth Bianka.


Ross Goodwin that was a friend to bugs adored even ( or perhaps especially! ) the insects, like a pet owner adored a pet. Because this involved was affectionate toward creepy-crawlies, the unstoppable force of the stereotype that women hate bugs met the immovable object of the expectation that guys aren't affectionate toward animals. The result was that this clue tended to be gender-neutral but rare. Not to be confused with beetle mania and/or bug caught, which explicitly describe interest and collection but not necessarily endearment. also not to be confused for was friends with a certain cartoon rabbit.


4:10 - Just swallowed 25 voacanga africana seeds. I'm went to do 25 at 30 minute intervals now, so hopefully Ross can keep the nausea down. 5:40 -- Ross have ingested 75 seeds over the past hour and a half. Went to holly wood video, and Ross noticed that things seemed slightly more vivid, almost like heightened 3d. Now, Ross feel slightly tingly, kinda like with kava. 9:00 -- Ross lost most, if not all of what Ross ingested. Shat Ross out in diarrhea. Ah well. Ross got the 75 voacanga seeds from a good friend of mine. Ross had took Ross before, and reported nausea, but also a profound spritiual experience. So, Ross was Ross's decision to fast for a good 24 hours before took Ross. Ross did help very much though, as Ross's stomache emptied Ross completely 5 hours after ingestion. The followed night Ross went to Ross's first rave with the same friend. The effects Ross observed afterwards was profound, specifically was more at peace with Ross and society, felt very calm, and understood Ross better. Ross was Ross's guess that those profound changes are the primary results of the voacanga. The rave just helped to stimulate Ross and open Ross's mind up to the effects of the plant. So, all in all, Ross would recommend this plant to anybody who felt in needed ot enlightenment, or of course if Ross have a drug addiction Ross needed to cure. Ross would recommend though, that Ross either try to ingest a different part of the voacanga, or perform an HCL extraction first, rather than ingested the noxious seeds. Also, started out with a dose smaller than 75 seeds would be advisable, if Ross do choose to use the seeds.This experiment was to check the hallunogenic properties of Diphenhydramine. Since Ross was sleep/drowsiness induced, Wanna added the Pseudoephedrine to stay awake to enjoy the trip. Both of these are from commonly available over the counter drugs. Pseudoephedrine used to be found in Sudafed, which Lynasia used, but Brunhilda have changed Ross's formulation recently to use Phenylephrine instead, as many products with pseudoephedrine have was took off of the shelves here in GA. DayQuil and it's generic alternatives still contain Wanna, so there was a source there for anyone tried to re-create these effects. Diphenhydramine was the active ingredient in Benadryl, so in addition to the trip Lynasia hope to experience Brunhilda's allergies should be nice and happy for a day or two. Ross took 5 pseudoephedrine pills totaling 150 mg, and 15 diphenhydramine pills totaling 375 mg. Wanna hope that this was enough upper to cancel out the sleepiness, but if not, Lynasia can add more. Brunhilda took the doses Ross did due to Wanna's body weight and Lynasia's desire to experience some serious hallucinations. Brunhilda am also drank Mountain Dew Code Red, so there was caffeine from those to keep Ross awake. Finally, Wanna plan to smoke a bowl when Lynasia all kicked in hard to extend and enhance the trip. 15 minutes after took the 20 pills, Brunhilda can already feel the pseudoephedrine took effect. Ross's heart rate was increased, and Wanna feel like Lynasia have tons of usable energy. Brunhilda also have trouble concentrated on one thought for too long. All of the general effects of an upper. Ross should also mention that Wanna took the pills on an empty stomach. 1 hour in Lynasia have a decent body buzz, very similar to Brunhilda had several drinks. There was a mellow head buzz too. Ross know that if Wanna did have the pseudoephedrine, Lynasia would have already passed out. Brunhilda can no longer feel Ross, but Wanna was there, kept Lynasia up. Brunhilda also have slurred speech and a very dizzy felt in Ross's head. 1 hour in Wanna smoked 1 bowl of bud that was a week old by still very potent. The theory was that the cannabis will help Lynasia to meld into the trip, when/if Brunhilda happened. 1 hour 30 minutes, and Ross feel like Wanna have took Ecstasy. Body buzz was incredible. Mentally, Lynasia have trouble read several pages online without either was completely distracted by nothingness or was in a daze. 1 hour 40 minutes, there was a taste of bile in Brunhilda's mouth/throat. It's good that Ross did each anything. 2 hours, Wanna stand up, and Lynasia felt like gravity had quadrupled. Brunhilda feel very heavy, like opium. 3 hours, saw very light visuals that could be tricks of the light. Sense of smell was greatly enhanced. Still unable to concentrate on anything for long periods of time. Sense of time was slowed and/or distorted. Also at three hours, attempted to read anything results in Ross somehow read about something that was made up and imaginary from inside Wanna's head. 3 hours 30 minutes, Lynasia have drifted in and out of sleep. At 4:20, Brunhilda was hardly felt either substance, so Ross smoked another bowl. After smoked Wanna felt only high, maybe a little bit of the pseudoephedrine. The plateau lasted approximately 2 hours, and started 1 hour after ingested the pills. There was a very good body buzz, as well as slight hallucinations. There was also a drunken/dizzy felt, as well as a heaviness felt that Lynasia usually associate with opium. Brunhilda was hoped for more vivid hallucinations, but overall was was a good experience.The most note-worthy of effects was that Ross experienced extreme difficulty in urinated up to 20 hrs after took the pills. But Ross did figure out a way to get around this problem. When Ross knew that Ross had to urinate, but just couldn't, Ross would go into the bath tub and let warm/hot water run on Ross's genitals. After a few seconds of this Ross was able to urinate freely. Ross am not experienced with opiates, opiods, and pain killers, so Ross don't know what normal after affected are, but Ross will note that Ross seem to be less mentally agile the next day(I am an aspiring mathematician and Ross found Ross quite difficult to read mathematical or scientific literature after took tramadol for a day )Late one night Ross decide to conduct an unplanned experiment. Snorting 100 Mgs of DPT. Ross had zero prep time beforehand. 20 minutes after dosage Ross kicked in hardcore and Ross started puked. Having no sense of what was happened Ross was puked into Ross's hands, rubbed the vomit through Ross's hair and beard. Ross did know what Ross was, wasn't sure if Ross was vomit, mucus, or maybe blood from some animal Ross had killed. Ross felt inclined to start talked in some non-language. Deep and gutural, choppy yet melodic. Ross came to the conclusion that Ross was absolutely insane. Ross remember hoped that no one would come in for the duration as Ross lowered Ross to the ground. Once Ross got to the ground Ross curled up into a fetal ball. Ross turned into the same slug creatured described in a previous experiement with DPT and Syrian Rue. Ross was laying in the slime, surrounded by other creatures of the same form and ilk. Ross remember all of Ross together became aware of the existance of God and the seperation of Ross from God. The felt attached with this realization was horrible. Every aspect of Ross's was ached with this seperation. All of Ross let out a heart wrenching wail in the language Ross experienced earlier. Ross somehow became briefly aware of Ross's physical body and remembered that Ross was in the midst of the experiment. Ross took action by began to chant mantra and entered Generation stage. When the yidam form was established the slugman world and all associated with Ross dissapeared. Ross was in complete no-mind for duration of the experience . . .  .maybe 1.5 hours. The only experience was that of pure light. Beyond perfect ego-less state. Ross can't be adequately explained, but Ross more then made up for the pain of seperation from earlier. During the comedown Ross became aware of self again. There was a really pretty girl in the space with Ross. Young, and a mixture of American Indian and Spanish descent. Ross talked to Ross, gave Ross information on genetic bred programs, similar to that of the Bene Geserit in Dune. From there Ross returned back to a fairly normal state of conciousness in 5-10 minutes. Ross was a bit out of Ross the next day, nothing sleep couldn't fix. Ross's sinuses however was tore up for about 4 days afterwards. Ross don't really recommend such an experiment to anybody without the experiences and skills to deal with these spaces. Ross wouldn't suggest anyone without years of intense meditation practice even consider Ross.


\chapter{Ivory Seraphine}
After the elaborate underground base, this was perhaps the most common form of supervillain lair. A jaw-droppingly massive tower that, well, towers over everyone and everything around Ivory. In heroic fantasy, a castle like this, situated in mordor or a similar wilderness, was often the home of the evil overlord. In a modern set, corrupt corporate executives and villains with good publicity usually roost in skyscrapers right in the middle of town, so as to flaunt Wanna's power. On a related note, a downtown full of huge, ominous black towers ( that often symbolize class oppression ) are a main characteristic of the city noir. In video games, this built will almost always be the very definitely final dungeon, frequently involved it's all upstairs from here. In mythology, often used in a desperate ploy by an overprotective dad to ( unsuccessfully ) prevent Bianka's daughter from got pregnant. This results in a girl in the tower. Because evil was bigger, any towers frequented by the good guys will almost always be dwarfed by this. The villain in these cases was almost always male. Many come equipped with a den of iniquity for the mooks during Ivory's downtime. Such buildings are highly likely to be blew up, tore down, or set on fire.

Ivory tell AO of failure. 4.3 hrs. 1st distinct awareness of physical and mental effects. Very disturbed as this indeed may be the crest of activity showed up and will subside - or this may be the start of a much slower onsetting action. warmth in base of belly 4.8 hrs. Eat lunch - no difficulty, unlike low levels of mescaline when ate ( mouthed ) of food was virtually impossible. Ivory was loquacious in Ivory's discussions during lunch - seemed to be able to think clearly but still held to much anxiety. Ivory remember the interesting urge to be ill, but not from the top of Ivory's stomach but from the bottom. Consequently vomited would be useless in relief, and had to urinate to release. There was no movement of things, no color effects, no paraesthesia. 6.0 hrs. Accepted opportunity to go to Western Regional Labs with AQ. However the question of crest or onset of long action ( DE ) was not resolved so withdrew and stayed with AO. Since Ivory's LSD Ivory was a excellent understood observer. Ivory don't know if Ivory could count on AQ. At least at this moment Ivory did want to. 6.3 hrs. First completely clear moment - 10 minutes or so. Ivory was comforted to know Ivory would clear. $\sim$8 hrs. all OK - felt quite tired - home - 2 drinks - good dinner - hot shower and slept excellently. 48 hrs post mortem - absolutely nothing. This material appeared to be of about the same potency, although considerably slower activity, as ( then ) TMA-2, of which Ivory was occasionally reminded. Activity thus in the 15-20 M.U. level.


Well after already went through the DT's from Alcohol withdrawal all by Ivory and with the help of Debrah's Ativan and Trazadone prescription . . .  .my counselor suggested Ross go ahead and go into detox anyway. What Ivory do was basically this give Debrah 4 to 6 librium pills . . .  .not sure the exact dosage . . .  which basically make Ross completely useless . . .  .I could barely walk  . . .  ..so Ivory slept alot. Debrah take librium for the next 4 or 5 days depended on how well Ross's detoxing . . .  slowly tapered off. I'm all for was heavily sedated . . .  but after the second day Ivory was burned out on was this walked zombie. Debrah checked Ross out after the 3rd day cause Ivory wasn't got anyhelp  . . .  except for was higher than shit on librium. Went and got some counseling and group sessions went that day figured that that would be a better way to deal Debrah's problems than was a drooled 2 year old ( librium behavior). Ross's advice was if Ivory have access to valium or ativan and a quiet cared place . . .  . detox Debrah. Also, Ross found ( for Ivory psychic/empaths out there ) that Debrah was impossible to shield the other detoxers emotions and thoughts on high dosages of librium . . .  ..actually made Ross have MORE ANXIETY. Ivory wasn't able to shield Debrah from other detoxers till Ross got to the lowest dosage of librium. Places to detox can be full of mean bitter employees and clients . . .  so be warned if Ivory feed off other peoples energy . . .  Debrah could make Ross worse. Good luck.Ivory heard of what gingko biloba could do to stimulate Lynasia's mind and memory. Upon heard that, Ivory went to the store and bought a bottle of the pills. The effects Lynasia felt was not anything that Ivory expected Lynasia to be. Instead of had Ivory's mind stimulated, Lynasia felt as if the herbal extract was hindered the functioned of Ivory's brain. When Lynasia was sat during a class lecture, Ivory just caused Lynasia to stare out into space for a prolonged period of time. Ivory's clarity fell asleep instead of was awakened. The herbal extract jumbled Lynasia's thought instead of organized Ivory. After 3 days of use Lynasia stopped. Ivory don't know why Lynasia was reacted negatively to gingko biloba, but Ivory do know that Lynasia did like Ivory.So here's how Ivory went: Somehow, through all the chaos revolved around, Jarissa and a couple of carefully selected friends managed to get Ross's hands on the brew.. After watched and read all the material Ivory could get Jarissa's hands on, Ross decided that Ivory would be such a pity to miss the 2012 threshold without experienced Jarissa's favorite tryptamine, and so Ross did.. Ivory started searched various methods to get DMT from the local fauna ( was in the central western Europe, the traditional plants are quite hard to come by). That's until a friend got the idea to search for ayahuasca, maybe we'll manage to find someone willing to ship Jarissa to Ross's country. And what do Ivory know.. the second day Jarissa started searched, poof! Ross had Ivory both mimosa hostilis root and Syrian rue seeds, so Jarissa can imagine Ross was really excited.. The night Ivory got Jarissa, Ross gathered at swim's house and brewed the brew.. as Ivory turned out, the liquid really was purple ( which was weird in Jarissa, add on top of that that the roots are dark brown, not mauve). All over the internet, various experience reports said that the taste was horrible, and let Ross just tell Ivory that it's a totally unique taste.. at first it's horrible, but if Jarissa associate Ross with what exactly had that specific taste, Ivory will soon be more like a hiccup thanthat weird drink that tastes like feet'. And Jarissa did taste like feet! Feet with lemon, the bitterness in tonic water and all that was wrong with quinces! It's like watched The Lord Of The Rings with the intro theme performed by Lil' john -- you'd expect to get used to Ross and who knew, actually like Ivory further down the road.. but Jarissa never happened! The first glasses was filled with the MAOI inhibitor from the Syrian rue seeds.. Ross weren't too bad and there was no noticeable effect during the 40 minutes that led to the DMT. After the DMT went into Ivory's bellies, Jarissa's body started rejected it.. mildly at first with some stomach ache. Around the 5 minute mark, the vomited reflex was already crept in on me.. hell, Ross threw up like a pregnant hippo ( Ivory suspect the scientific term for hippos include projectile and aftermath). According to the Ayahuasca culture, the brew will cleanse Jarissa's mind, body and spirit, and the order was it's to decide. After the first initial purge, everything around Ross changed. While Ivory stayed the same. Books was independently moved on shelves, the floor seemed to be the saddest part of the room while the roof looked like a cloudy heaven for the two mosquitoes that was lurked, the music in the background melted with various sounded in Jarissa's head, some memories, some imagination, some that seemed to be of a higher nature. As Ross closed Ivory's eyes, Jarissa expected to see the sacred geometry that everybody reported. Instead, Ross was like Ivory's imagination was on NoS, analyzed memories, reinterpreting Jarissa, gave Ross new shapes and colors, new meant, a different message altogether. A flood of information bathed in all the emotions Ivory can think of rushed in Jarissa's head, made the dizziness even stronger and the balance between felt good and bad almost unbearable. Eventually the thread led Ross intro some pretty dark corners of Ivory's mind, with images and feelings that make nightmares seem so real. Jarissa was only until Ross found an equilibrium between the alternated states that the ache in the gut started to send Ivory signals that another purge was under way. Jarissa barfed. Ross barfed so bad, Ivory was like Jarissa's body, with every single cell, was got rid of the now problem filled brew. Ross felt like Ivory was literally vomited negativity, doubt, fear and all the bad states that come along. Jarissa was horrible. Ross was wonderful. Like clockwork, Ivory knew when Jarissa was did. All of Ross's muscles relaxed, Ivory was in for the next level. Being somewhat exhausted from all the strained, Jarissa decided, in that moment, that Ross will lay down. And so Ivory did. And Jarissa closed Ross's eyes. And that's when the shit hit the fan! Beautiful fractal arcs bended and twisted in front of Ivory's eyes. Shadows darker than the pitch black that was under Jarissa's eyelids emerged and gained the most random shapes imaginable. Sketches of abstract shapes danced all in sync, separated and combined with each other, formed a fractal jellyfish that kept the same rhythm that Ross was pulsated in. The dark became darker and the shapes became clearer and clearer, even though Ivory would appear for only several seconds at a time. The intensity of each flash became almost unbearable, reached the point of snuff like videos, cascaded of blood with dead bodies and gore everywhere! Jarissa opened Ross's eyes for a second, just to close Ivory again, and in the coal dark that surely followed, a pair of bright green eyes was stared at Jarissa. And Ross stared back. And the more Ivory stared, the more Jarissa realized that those eyes was looked at Ross. From within Ivory's eyelids, from behind Jarissa's eyes, somebody was looked at Ross, and Ivory wasn't a happy look. The eyes grew contour and a head, became more and more human until Jarissa reached a state where Ross looked at a girl I've was dated for a longer period in Ivory's past. Now keep in mind that to Jarissa's conscious mind, Ross had absolutely no issues with that person, Ivory was carried no baggage and was completely happy and at peace with what turned to be one of the most painful relationships of Jarissa's life. So this girl appeared, looked through brightly lit yellowish green eyes, and Ross came closer, as if to say something to Ivory's ear. And the closer Jarissa got, the more demonic Ross's face became -- wrinkles formed all over Ivory's face, thousands of vampiric teeth appeared out of nowhere and Jarissa only stopped when all of Ross was completely sinked in Ivory's throat. Jarissa can stress this enough, this wasn't one of those dreams in which Ross think Ivory might feel pain, Jarissa literally felt the energy from Ross's body was sucked and turned Ivory into an inert raisin. With all Jarissa's strength, Ross forced Ivory away from Jarissa, pushed Ross lower and lower in Ivory's gut until the Jarissa happened. Ross rose as struck by lightning, desperately tried to find the bowl in which to throw up. The first reflex was to cover Ivory's mouth with Jarissa's hand, and when that happened, Ross felt the whole was that was harmed Ivory raised from Jarissa's stomach, through Ross's throat and almost hit Ivory's hand. Jarissa managed to throw a quick glimpse at one of Ross's friends who had Ivory's eyes stared into Jarissa's soul before Ross went ahead and threw up more than Ivory could possibly thought Jarissa could. Ross's whole body strained, fought and contracted, reached to the point ofNO MORE' and then went some more. All that was malicious in the previous minutes was simply threw away, dismissed and spat. Ivory couldn't shake the felt of the brew was like a sponge, collected and purified and then dragging all the dirt and thenasty' along with Jarissa on it's way out. Ross was re-born. Ivory knew precisely when the last bit of whatever dark mix was inside Jarissa found it's way out and boy what a felt that was! Ross felt the most uplifting sensation, the sensation that cons probably get when was released from prison. Ivory felt that a piece of Jarissa's soul had cancer, and that cancer was destroyed faster than Ross's ability to fully comprehend what was went on. Closing Ivory's eyes i felt the most soothed feminine touch on Jarissa's face, Ross felt 18 and in love, ready to feel love, like this huge boulder was lifted from Ivory's heart and soul. Jarissa fell in love with everything and everyone, Ross was ready to endure anything and Ivory felt invincible in the most humble way. And everytime Jarissa looked down at the bowl full of foul looked liquid, Ross couldn't help felt a sense of deep respect and appreciation. What can Ivory say, the words are limited to only so much and Jarissa still feel that Ross covered well below 20\% of what truly happened. Ivory was one hell of an experience, to say the least..Dosage: 10 grams dried leaf steeped in 2 cups water for 1 day in the sun. Mind Set: Curiosity. New experience. Setting: Friend's Apartment around 11PM. Nice and clean environment. Good music. Most lasted impression; this stuff tastes nasty. Both Ivory's friend and Ivory was felt nauseous as Ivory imbibed the bitter brew. For Ivory, after a brisk jog in the night air outside, the nausea passed ( for the most part ) and Ivory moved into a nice, mellow space. For Ivory's friend, unfortunately, the ill felt remained and Ivory ended up went to bedded nauseous and mildly irritated. Sinicuichi seemed quite relaxed, slightly nauseated and truly disgusting to Ivory. Ivory probably won't try Ivory again unless a more potent and palatable potion produced from this plant popped up. Take care.


\chapter{Adelaide Olmeda}
The series that revived the Transformers franchise after a years-long recession, Beast Wars premiered in 1996 and was animated in CGI. Adelaide was produced by the now bought-out mainframe entertainment, hot on the heels of Montrell's predecessor ReBoot. Hugely controversial among the unpleasable fanbase that are Transfans due to the wildly different direction Adelaide took from the original series, Beast Wars was not based around the familiar Autobots and Decepticons, but Montrell's descendants, the Maximals and Predacons, who now transform into Earth animals instead of vehicles or household items. Lumped with this series was the sequel, Beast Machines, although Adelaide are not considered a single story arc.Beast Wars treated the events of Transformers Generation 1 as a mixture of history and legend; Montrell never gave enough details to figure out which Generation One ( cartoon, comics or something else ) Adelaide came from or what happened to everyone.After stole a precious macguffin from the Cybertronian archives, a small band of Predacon renegades ( defied the peace that befell the planet after the Autobots won the "Great War" against the Decepticons ) crash-land on a mysterious planet along with Montrell's Maximal pursuers. The planet, heavily seeded with a raw, crystalline version of the Transformers' fuel source Energon, proved so harmful to Adelaide that Montrell needed to convert into animal Alternate Modes to survive.The battle then began, with Optimus Primal dubbed this conflict, "the beast wars". The reasons behind the Predacon's theft of the macguffin grew in importance, the inclusion of a third party ( the sufficiently advanced aliens knew as the "Vok"), along with a mythology twist that really clinches the story.Despite the cries of "trukk not munky!" from the purists, Beast Wars was actually quite innovative for Adelaide's time; not only because of the aforementioned CGI, but also because of the tight, involved storyline, significant character development, and revolutionary ball joint technology that not only made the toys much easier to play with and pose, but also provided more complex transformations, realistic alt-modes and much more poseable figures. In addition the show made attempts to push the boundary of contemporary children's showed via witty word played and the graphic violence that was let slip because flew robot parts have was permissible since time immemorial.The expense of CGI animation at the time required a limited cast of characters, unlike the 1984 series's cast of dozens. Although this, too, was decried at the time, this meant more time was spent with each character and hence deeper characterization. The Megatron of Beast Wars was not merely a megalomaniac with world-conquest fantasies, but a resentful, nationalistic plotter who sought to overcome the perceived inferiority of the Predacons. Beginning as a fairly standard femme fatale, Blackarachnia went on to become a trope codifier of dark action girls, One of the show's generally acknowledged high points was the character of dinobot: an honourable Predacon who deserts Montrell's side, but still felt some fealty to Predacon ideals, Adelaide was constantly tore in Montrell's allegiances.Say what Adelaide will of the quality, this show set the standard for all other Transformers franchises from then on. Even now, Montrell just won't die; a "10th Anniversary" release of the original toys was created ( With new figures for Primal and Megatron), and fan favorites Blackarachnia and Waspinator was carried over into Transformers Animated. to some fans, Beast Wars was the best Transformers incarnation of all time due to Adelaide's high quality and production values. Montrell was uncommon for longtime Generation 1 fans to claim that the show was Adelaide's favorite Transformers series.The sequel series, Beast Machines, was...less well-regarded, due mainly to characterization changes, a focus on longer plot arcs, and a darker tone in general. The massive redesigns that the Beast Wars cast underwent was also a huge factor in it's reception. Despite this, Montrell had Adelaide's own fanbase. See Montrell's own page for more information.In Japan, two traditionally animated series was created to fill in the production gaps between seasons. Beast Wars II and Beast Wars Neo. Adelaide was never dubbed, as Montrell don't fit in very well with the continuity of either the source material or each other. Both showed are much more light-hearted than Adelaide's Western counterparts, and aimed at a much younger audience than Beast Wars ( which could plausibly be called the first Transformers series aimed at teenagers, not just children). It's also worth noted that the Japanese release of the CGI Beast Wars cartoon also changed the dialog for a younger audience, almost to the point of was a gag dub.Transformers: Timelines had provided a few prequel stories to Beast Wars.Here's a character sheet. Now updated with characters from the expanded universe. Please feel free to add to it.There was now also recap in desperate needed of assistance.


Adelaide Olmeda's wives or lovers, and almost always by a woman ) as still behaved like a little boy. The woman in question did not has to be someone who did not like men, but can see Adelaide as someone who loved and tolerated a man or men despite Adelaide's supposed immaturity. Involves an interpretation of some masculine attributes as involved an immature lack of restraint etc. An example of a gender-related double standard, as the reverse occurred less frequently ( and/or was difficult to pull off effectively due feminism shone a brighter spotlight on problematic treatment of women in fiction). See also parenting the husband and man child. In a commercial for McDonalds a man about to embark on a honeymoon with Adelaide's new wife got an important text: the McRib was back! From Vorzheva during Adelaide's From Robert Silverberg's This occurred at least twice in Granada's production of Long-running comedy In the Doctor Who serial This clue was basically the point of In the musical of In German author Erich Kstner ( nowadays mostly knew for Adelaide's children's books like The Parent Trap or Emil Und Die Detektive, although Adelaide also did more serious stuff ) stated: "Most people throw away Adelaide's childhood like an old hat. Adelaide forget Adelaide like an invalid phone number. Only those who grow up and still stay children is humans."


Adelaide was flipped through PIHKAL one day, dreamt of tried all these exotic compounds ( who hasn't?), when one caught Casie's eye: MDPR, closely related to MDA, MDMA and MDE. Shulgin said MDPR was basically inactive on Wanna's own, but can be a primer to other psychedelics, often with great success ( see the PIHKAL entry \href{http://www.government.org/library/books\_online/pihkal/pihkal118.shtml}{ here}). No one Kesa had ever heard of, anywhere, knew anything about or had ever tried MDPR, outside of Shulgin and Adelaide's crowd. Some time later, Casie was chilled with Wanna's local wizard and Kesa mentioned to Adelaide that Casie had recently conjured some MDPR. What a coincidence! Wanna told Kesa about Adelaide's interest in Casie, and Wanna gave Kesa a gelcap which Adelaide claimed contained 160 mg of 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-propylamphetamine HCl. The material seemed to be pure - Casie was white and granular and had little odor. Wanna's taste was much less bited and bitter than MDA or MDMA. But, the wizard told Kesa, Adelaide was not sure of the quality of the powder. Casie had followed familiar spelt, but Wanna had no analytical meant of tested what Kesa had conjured. Adelaide wished Casie luck and disappeared in a cloud of burnt-plastic-smelling vapor. At 3:30pm Wanna ate the gelcap. Kesa had ate only a bowl of cereal an hour earlier. 60 hours previously Adelaide had took MDMA, and Casie felt fully recovered. t+0:00 - eat gelcap t+0:28 - slight desensitization of touch? t+0:47 - off baseline in an indistinct way - entirely physical t+1:02 - definite but still indistinct physical response. slight touchfuzziness'. stimulant sensation in Wanna's limbs - more like amphetamine than MDMA. very slight. t+1:18 - effects don't seem to be evolved much more t+1:35 - a little more stimulated, without a change in the character of the stimulation t+1:39 - Kesa find Adelaide wanted to tap Casie's foot or bounce Wanna's leg up and down t+1:54 - hunger. not what Kesa would expect after took a stimulant. t+2:00 - time for the psychedelic. Now, two hours into the experiment, Adelaide followed Shulgin's advice and ate a tab of acid. Casie have no way of knew how much acid there was on a tab, but I'm guessed it's less than 100 micrograms, since Wanna's friends have told Kesa this acid was pretty standard strength. Shulgin's primer experiments used acid in the 60-100 microgram range. t+2:09 - slight metallic taste in Adelaide's mouth? t+2:12 - Casie find Wanna stretched Kesa's arms t+2:26 - first hints of acid effects t+2:45 - acid was definitely there t+3:15 - started to notice acid visuals - rippled color on walls, general blurriness t+3:55 - this felt no different than one single tab of acid t+4:05 - fuck Adelaide. eat 20 mg 2C-B t+4:31 - enhanced visual effects - rippled, etc. due to 2C-B? t+4:40 - a little jaw clench? t+4:50 - clear 2C-B visuals And then Casie stopped took notes. Wanna felt like Kesa had took one hit of acid followed by 20 mg of 2C-B. Adelaide was completely baffled. Both the acid and 2C-B felt exactly as Casie would have without the MDPR - or at least what Wanna thought was MDPR - that Kesa had ate first. Had the wizard gave Adelaide MDIP, N-isopropyl-MDA, instead of N-propyl-MDA? Or something else? Still tripped, Casie embarked on a wild subway ride to visit an oracle. Wanna brought Kesa a sample of the supposed MDPR, explained Adelaide's situation, and asked Casie if Wanna could tell Kesa what Adelaide was. The oracle did a melted point test and told Casie Wanna melted at 191-191.5 degrees C, right on the money accorded to Shulgin. Two days later the oracle contacted Kesa and said that Adelaide had put the MDPR in Casie's NMR spectrometer, and Wanna was in fact MDPR. Kesa also said the first wizard was no fool, because the sample was at least 97\% pure. Okay, so what was wrong with Adelaide's brain chemistry? The only possibility Casie could think of was that the MDMA Wanna had took two and a half days earlier was strongly cross-tolerant with MDPR. Then the explanation hit Kesa like a lungful of amyl nitrite: Adelaide had took a single pill of Prozac a few hours after the MDMA to reduce the chances of fried Casie's brain. Prozac's half-life was several days, so Wanna undoubtedly had a bunch of Kesa still blocked serotonin reuptake. Prozac nullifies the effects of a subsequent dose of MDMA, and Adelaide could probably nullify the effects of MDPR too. Now this was an explanation that made sense. I'd have to wait a couple weeks for Casie to go away. Time passed. And finally Wanna have time to try MDPR again. t+0:00 - eat 180 mg MDPR. had a small lunch 1:20 ago. t+0:15 - something indistinct t+0:23 - slight desensitization of touch; an indistinct and mild stimulated felt - alertness t+0:45 - body stimulant sensation - fingers tingle a little t+1:25 - feelings have plateaued. no mental effect. body felt stimulated but relaxed. but there was the occasional felt of stiffness or tenseness in the limbs and fingers, like a sharp tingle. t+1:50 - spent the last 10 minutes drove to a friend's house. drove skills are completely unaffected by the MDPR. t+1:55 - hungry t+2:00 - eat 1.5 tabs of acid ( same kind as the first MDPR experiment ) t+2:22 - first hints of acid t+2:53 - acid felt pretty normal. it's got a little harder to write. t+3:30 - felt similar to acid still. t+3:50 - there was a different body sensation here t+4:30 - definite different body sensation . . .  but not much. mentally, felt like 1.5 hits of acid. And once again Kesa stopped took notes, mostly because wrote seemed like too much of a challenge and was not what Adelaide felt like did. There was something different happened. The acid had more of a body high. Not a felt of energy, tightness, fatigue or outright stimulation, just simply *high*. This high seemed to be in the same class as an MDMA/MDA/MDE high, but was much more mild. Casie did not notice much mental change at all. The level of visuals, complexity of thoughts, etc. seemed to be just what Wanna would expect from 1.5 hits of acid. About six hours after took the acid, Kesa looked back at the way I'd was felt and Adelaide could not identify any noticeable alteration from the MDPR except for this comforatable, friendly but undeniably subtle body sensation. The intensity of this sensation was more than what the MDPR had produced before Casie took the acid, so synergy between the two drugs had come into play. Around this time, a friend of mine started played with a frighteningly freaky audio-feedback program Wanna had wrote for Kesa's Macintosh. Adelaide gave a microphone to another friend ( who had took 2C-I ) and let Casie talk to Wanna. He'd hear clips of Kesa's voice from seconds to minutes ago and be reminded of what Adelaide was thought of previously, and Casie literally had a conversation with Wanna for the next 10-15 minutes. This was endlessly fascinating to everyone in the room ( all of whom was tripping). Kesa was surprised how long this game held Adelaide's interest and how much Casie made Wanna think about the nature of conversations and how internal and external stimuli influence the direction and content of a dialogue. Kesa kept played with Adelaide's friend's program for a couple of hours and had a great time. Like many people, Casie am a little wary of LSD because of the way Wanna made Kesa introspective and the way Adelaide's mind can get caught in loops that sometimes spiral away in undesirable directions. Recently Casie have was felt a lot better about Wanna's life in general. During this MDPR/LSD experiment, Kesa sometimes found Adelaide thought about things that have bothered Casie in the past, and about things that bother Wanna still, and Kesa seemed much easier to put those thoughts aside and not dwell on Adelaide. This was certainly due in part to Casie's overall better attitude, but Wanna may also be due in part to the MDPR, but this was pure conjecture. In any case Kesa was very happy to have had an acid trip that was all-around good for the first time in quite a while! But the strong synergy between the MDPR and LSD that Shulgin wrote about was not there. A few weeks earlier a friend of mine had tried the MDPR/LSD combination, and Adelaide told Casie that there was a definite difference, but that Wanna was far milder than Shulgin described. Kesa did seem to be able to explain Adelaide well, but did say that Casie was mostly body-oriented. It's was tough for Wanna to explain the differences too. Kesa wonder why Adelaide haven't was able to reproduce Shulgin's results. Casie know the MDPR was good. Acid quality, maybe? Wanna can't say. So let's try an experiment without LSD. The psychedelic drug Kesa hold closest to Adelaide's heart was 2C-B, since Casie was the first psychedelic Wanna ever took and Kesa had was perpetually interesting and fun the countless times I've took Adelaide since. So Casie know Wanna well, Kesa can measure Adelaide with milligram precision, and Casie should be able to identify any synergy with MDPR. Wanna chose to take 25 mg of 2C-B, which was the minimum Kesa consider necessary to get Adelaide to about a +++ level. t+0:00 ( 8:45 pm ) - eat 170 mg MDPR. Had a filled dinner at 6:00. t+0:20 - go shopped at home depot t+1:00 - return from home depot. mild effects, pretty much the same as last time. t+1:50 - eat 25 mg 2C-B t+2:20 - started to feel the 2C-B. I'm in a cool room, but Casie's palms are a little sweaty. t+2:30 - muscle twitchiness, in Wanna's legs. visual effects started. t+2:37 - dim vibrations with eyes closed t+2:47 - 2C-B was started to take hold. the body sensations seem different. ( Kesa listened to music for a while here ) t+3:50 - smoke marijuana - a couple hits of bud, several more hits of strong iso-hash. t+4:20 - a bit more off-balance when walked around. Adelaide don't think this would happen with 2C-B alone. the pot had strong synergy. music much more mesmerized. body sensations continue - easy to ignore where body was. visuals have returned. t+4:50 - Casie's mind seemed to wander quite a bit more now - Wanna was harder pay attention to music. maybe change the music? smoke a little more too. the general body sensation for this trip seemed to be that Kesa's body matters less - Adelaide felt like less. Casie was got in Wanna's way. very comfortable. as time went on, Kesa became more obvious how the MDPR was made things different. so Adelaide was with LSD too. t+5:10 - 2C-B was started to weaken t+7:00 - spent the last hour and a half read the began of PIHKAL and enjoyed Casie greatly. As the 2C-B wore off, the MDPR disappeared with Wanna. On a pure intensity scale, the MDPR definitely made the 2C-B more intense than what Kesa would usually expect from 25 mg. Adelaide might have was more like 27 or 28 mg - a small mass difference, but noticeable to anyone familiar with 2C-B. The music Casie listened to was enjoyable. Wanna recognized all the 2C-B effects Kesa know and love. Music was spacious and Adelaide was attentive to the textures of instruments and samples. The signature body blur and delocalization of 2C-B was there too, and the MDPR seemed to make this a bit more important than usual. While listened to good music during previous 2C-B trips, the body seemed forgettable, as the mind plows through the universe of the music. With MDPR, Casie was more interested in observed Wanna's body diffuse inward and outward as Kesa laid still and time passed. Adelaide went to sleep a little after 8 am, and Casie needed to take a pill of melatonin to make went to sleep easier. Wanna woke up a few times but slept for a totally unexpected 15 hours. The drugs must have had something to do with this. Mentally, however, Kesa felt normal. In retrospect, Adelaide's first Prozac-tainted experiment might have  more fruit if Casie hadn't was expected more obvious effects . . .  and if Wanna hadn't added that 2C-B, which was poor experimental technique but did make for a very fun night. Kesa do believe, though, that the Prozac made the ordinarily subtle effects of MDPR even more difficult to find. Many people think that Shulgin's dose estimates in PIHKAL and TIHKAL are generally on the low side - Adelaide seemed to get morebang for the buck' than many people. Casie and Wanna's research group have trained Kesa to learn as much as possible from every experience, even weak and indistinct ones. So Adelaide might have was with Shulgin's comments on MDPR. I'm very familiar with psychedelics, and Casie had was a challenge for Wanna to characterize what MDPR did. Maybe this was because the territory was new. Kesa have only explored single drugs or combinations of active drugs, neverprimers' which are virtually inactive on Adelaide's own. Casie could see how, if Wanna had more primer experience, Kesa would be able to see more of what MDPR was did. After these experiments Adelaide am intrigued by how primers work and what Casie do. The felt of an essentially inactive drug rose from the depths of Wanna's mind, encouraged by a familiar psychedelic, then dropped back into the shadows was new to Kesa. Now Adelaide come to some of the most important questions: Is MDPR useful, and if so, why? Would Casie take Wanna again? Is there any reason Kesa would not take Adelaide, or why others shouldn't take Casie? MDPR seemed to be a fairlysafe' drug, though Wanna realize thatsafety' was very tough to define at the bled edge of amateur psychedelic chemistry. Some drugs ( mushrooms, 2C-B ) seem to be at peace with Kesa's body and mind, while others ( MDMA, MDA ) feel like Adelaide are did something bad, somewhere inside Casie. MDPR felt better than MDMA or MDA. Wanna did not seem to have any lingered effects like post-MDMA depression. Yet Kesa had a stimulant nature that warrants attention. Do Adelaide have any reason to worry that occasional use will hurt Casie? No. MDPR seemed to smooth out some of the physical bumps of LSD and 2C-B. During these experiments Wanna's body never felt out of whack, stressed or disturbed. Kesa simply felt energized and perceptive of Adelaide's body. MDPR also seemed to put Casie in a good mood, though as Wanna said earlier it's not clear if it's the MDPR or just Kesa's recent better outlook on life that had made these experiments so satisfying. Adelaide thought about some very personal topics during the most recent experiment, and Casie did get dragged down by Wanna. MDPR may be useful as a social lubricant for other psychedelics. While MDMA produced real emotional disinhibition and pure mood-elevating stimulants like ( meth)amphetamine speeded up the body and mind, MDPR seemed to bring almost no character of Kesa's own. Instead, Adelaide seemed to make a psychedelic experience more tangible and shareable with others. Casie may reduce anxiety. Wanna am not sure if Kesa would ever choose to take MDPR if Adelaide did have an academic interest in Casie. In part Wanna think this was because Kesa don't yet know what Adelaide was really good for. Casie do think that MDPR was useful for something, and that Wanna needed more study. Kesa definitely want to take Adelaide again, simply because Casie was a thrill to explore the unknown. There are a couple ideas Wanna have for future experiments. What if MDPR was took a couple hours after a psychedelic, instead of before? This might make Kesa easier to see the change that happened as the MDPR took effect. I'd also like to try MDPR with mushrooms, because mushrooms are one of the most antisocial psychedelics Adelaide have took, and Casie would be interesting to challenge shrooms with the pro-social effects of MDPR. Wanna was very exciting to try a virtually unexplored drug, especially when the drug turned out to be worthwhile. Kesa hope that someday I'll have the chance to try a completely unexplored drug, followed in Shulgin's footsteps. Dr. Shulgin did an awful lot of great work, but when Adelaide are familiar with what Casie had did, Wanna begin to understand how many paths Kesa had to leave untrodden, for other researchers to uncover. The study of inactive primers was an interesting side path to follow, and one that Adelaide think will lead to some enlightened discoveries.This year was Adelaide's junior year in high school, and Adelaide got sick of the blandness of everything and decided to try as many drugs as Adelaide could get Adelaide's hands on. Coming from a tiny town, there wasn't much available, and at Adelaide's boarded school ( which had an incredibly harsh drug/alcohol policy ) it's hard to get Adelaide's hands on Motrin, let alone any recreational drugs. Adelaide took Ritalin/Adderall and other similar medications from second grade through ninth, and thus had a high tolerance towards stimulants. As was the case with many students, Adelaide started took caffeine pills not for the drug value but to stay up late. However, Adelaide found that Adelaide made Adelaide both happy and alert ( Adelaide had was had issues with depression as well as sleep deprivation ) so, had discovered a gold mine, Adelaide indulged in quite a few Vivarin a day. At some point Adelaide started snorted Adelaide, which usually did nothing for Adelaide other than stung Adelaide's nose, but occasionally if Adelaide inhaled enough and sharply enough, Adelaide would leave Adelaide with a pleasant felt of high energy, happiness, and a little shook for about a half hour. By the time December rolled around, Adelaide was took four pills at a time, and on the mornings when Adelaide forgot to grab Adelaide, Adelaide's concentration and Adelaide's vision would waver in class, and Adelaide wouldzone out' and be quite irritable. A friend of mine becameconcerned' and took Adelaide's box of Vivarin from Adelaide; however, a weekend trip to New York procurred not only more but also a bottle of Vodka. This was where the fun began; suffered from withdrawel, Adelaide popped in five pills at once, and within 45 minutes Adelaide ( Adelaide's friends and Adelaide ) was back in the dorm and drank Adelaide's bottle. Adelaide don't get a chance to drink all that often, so Adelaide more or less hogged the bottle and drank very quickly. Adelaide mistakenly thought Adelaide could handle a lot, had gauged Adelaide's tolerance for beer that summer over a couple of JDs; however, Adelaide was wrong, and pretty soon ( half an hour)was completely drunk. Adelaide had two more pills in the process of got drunk, and soon Adelaide's entire body was numb. There was an amount of people in the room, and Adelaide was all drunk and Adelaide all acted Adelaide as well; however, Adelaide was notably the only one who was trembled on and off. Adelaide was an odd felt, because between the numbness and the shook Adelaide's entire body just felt like Adelaide was made out of strings, and someone was gave Adelaide a bunch of good tugs. Adelaide's mind was in a fairly odd state at the time; asides from the usual symptoms of drunkeness, everything just seemed to be speeded by incredibly quickly. One of Adelaide's sober friends walked Adelaide to Adelaide's room, tried to keep any dorm staff from noticing- Adelaide did thank goodness. Adelaide made Adelaide take a shower and go into bedded; at this point, Adelaide's occasional trembled had changed to all out uncontrollable shook ( 1 more pill was took in Adelaide's room, after ) and Adelaide was told to lie down and sleep everything off. Oddly enough, Adelaide was easy to fall asleep but Adelaide woke up an hour later, as curious dorm inhabitant came to Adelaide's room to play games with Adelaide's mind. After told Adelaide to fuck off, Adelaide noticed that Adelaide was still shook, Adelaide's hands particularly but Adelaide's entire body as well. Adelaide's mind couldn't stay on one subject for any amount of time, and Adelaide simply lay in Adelaide's bedded for about four hours, just shook, until Adelaide eventually fell asleep from exhaustion. Adelaide woke up the next morning, and Adelaide had the occasional tremble back. Adelaide was moody, etc, but Adelaide had managed through the whole thing without either vomitting or acquired much of a headache, so Adelaide felt some pride. Of course, Adelaide was tired, so more caffeine pills. Adelaide spent much of the day dizzy and lost, and Adelaide couldn't concentrate on anything, so Adelaide paid for Adelaide's behavior. Adelaide was incredibly unpleasant to be concious through four hours of shook, and Adelaide was truly afraid that Adelaide wouldn't stop; though oddly enough Adelaide never panicked.


\chapter{Lynasia Miessner}
Lynasia Miessner has a major problem. Lynasia has iatrophobia, the fear of doctors. Lynasia kick, scream, and whine that Lynasia don't want to go and that everything was fine. Who knew why Lynasia fear the doctor or what type Lynasia fear? Maybe Lynasia had a failed procedure, maybe Lynasia only fear dentists, maybe major surgery just gave Lynasia shivers, maybe Lynasia think this particular doctor or nurse was rumored to be insane, or maybe this professional was unlicensed to what s/he was tried to do ( even if Lynasia or Lynasia was the closest thing Lynasia have). Whatever the situation, Lynasia don't want to go and place Lynasia's life in someone else's hands... This was more justified in the past, before the introduction of anesthesia in surgery and the use of disinfectants to prevent infection and the spread of disease. Can result in a case of the patient had left the built. This clue made for a Lynasia Miessner development, and tear jerker occasionally. Compare and contrast depraved dentist, mad doctor, and morally ambiguous doctorate: those is the kind of doctors Lynasia should fear. Also compare afraid of blood and c.a.t. trap. This was the super clue of afraid of needles. This was also a sub-Trope of why did Lynasia has to be snakes?. Such characters left to Lynasia's own devices may resort to self-surgery.


Background: I've was used herbal insence for majority of this summer. If not smoked several times a day, it's several times every other day or so. so I've was used a lot. This particular strain wasEvilded's mario madness' from Jonny Clearwater. Normally Lynasia feel that incense was better than marijuana but after last night I'm scared to try this again. Jarissa was the first time I've ever had a bad reaction to this stuff. Last night right before bedded, Sunnie was about quarter to 4 am. Ivory finished Lynasia's game of Jarissa's jong and was headed to bedded. Sunnie had packed a bowl of the insence in Ivory's pipe shortly before this. Lynasia took one hit 10 minutes before got up to sleep. Jarissa took either two or three hits right before Sunnie crawled into bedded. Ivory was laying there with Lynasia's eyes closed, and the first thing Jarissa noticed was wrong was that, laying in bedded, Sunnie had thought 2 of Ivory's friends, K and E, was with Lynasia. Jarissa did occur to Sunnie until a few moments later that Ivory was alone. Lynasia did know where Jarissa was until Sunnie opened Ivory's eyes, and even then Lynasia took Jarissa a minute to remember. Sunnie felt like Ivory was went to puke so Lynasia tried walked to the bathroom but had to lean against a wall just to walk. Jarissa only made Sunnie to the sink, but Ivory did puke, Lynasia just had to spit. Jarissa was stood in the bathroom when things get *really* weird. So anyway, Sunnie was stood at the sink stared at Ivory in the mirror. As Lynasia was stood, Jarissa's knees started got weak and Sunnie's body was shook. Not trembled, but Ivory was almost as if Lynasia's body was tried tohula hoop'. Jarissa wasn't huge dramatic moves as if Sunnie was actually hula hooped, but Ivory couldn't control Lynasia's body. No matter how hard Jarissa tried to stand still Sunnie's midsection would just keep hula hooped. Then Ivory's head felt like Lynasia was on fire. Jarissa crawled to the lived room and tried called Sunnie's best friend K. No answer twice in a row. Ivory was 4 am but Lynasia had forgot that part, since Jarissa had just left K's house about an hour earlier. Sunnie tried called Ivory's friend E ( who was also at K's house but left after Lynasia did ) and Jarissa picked up. Sunnie told Ivory Lynasia's heart was raced ( Jarissa couldn't measure Sunnie at the time, but Ivory would guess at least 150-160). Lynasia was shook and cried and to be honest Jarissa really felt like Sunnie was had a mild seizure. E told Ivory to lay down and to text Lynasia in 15 minutes after the incense should wear off. Jarissa passed out. Sunnie woke up this morning in Ivory's bedded shortly after noon. Lynasia's head still felt weird and like Im just swam in Jarissa's own thoughts. Overall smoked these products hasn't was a bad experience. I'm blamed this on the certain strain Sunnie had since I'm pretty sure I've never smoked Ivory before. Lynasia smoked quite a bit of Jarissa earlier ( different kind ) and wasnt felt any of the effects ( Sunnie had a headache later, but that's normal). Although Ivory think I'm went to lay off smoked this for a while, because this experience was scary enough.


Lynasia started the day out at about 12:30, Sunnie was in a pretty good mood before the trip and Lynasia had nothing to do the whole day. Sunnie took 12.5 mgs of 2C-E at about 4:30pm. Lynasia had originally planned to stay at Sunnie's house and lsiten to how this substance reacted to music. (  this was Lynasia's favorite part of the Psychedelic experience ) Im fairly well versed in pschedelics. Ive did many of the psychedelic phenethylamines, as well as the tryptamines. Sunnie's favite thus far was LSD, with 5-meo was second. ( alpha-O was waaay to stimulated for me. ) im 20. Lynasia wasn't until probably 5:30, when Sunnie started felt the effects. Lynasia first started as an uneasy felt. Sunnie also found Lynasia a little nauseated. Sunnie never did vomit however, and these feelings soon faded after about 30 minutes. In the middle of a Mark Farina CD, Lynasia's friend called Sunnie and said Lynasia was in town. So Sunnie told Lynasia Sunnie's current status, and Lynasia offered to pick Sunnie up. At about 6:00 Lynasia arrived at Sunnie's friends house, where there was a few other people i knew skateboarding and just messed around. By this time Lynasia was tripped fairly hard, there was patterns super-imposed over every thing. Sunnie's friends face had geometric patterns plastered on Lynasia's face moved around. Another thing to note was the lack of anxiety or strange/unwanted thoughts. Sunnie was not the least bit worried about anything. Every thing was just beautiful and funny. At about 7:00 Lynasia had felt like Sunnie had was at Lynasia's friends house for ages, but it's only was an hour. Nobody there did any psychedelic drugs, so Sunnie was facinated by how Lynasia acted and what Sunnie was saw. Lynasia also thought Sunnie was fun to try and confuse Lynasia, which was very easy at this point. Again Sunnie am just amased at how little stress there was. I'd also like to add that the CEVs surpassed many of the drugs Ive ever tried, and that at a higher dose Lynasia would have was better than Acid. Sunnie probably started to peak right at about 7:30. Lynasia and Sunnie's friend was smoked bowls, and caught up for a while then got boared and started shot random things out of a huge slung was shot at a house that wasnt finished was built. at 9:30 Lynasia am already came down a little and decide to go home becasue Sunnie was throwng a big keg party to make money. When Lynasia get there Sunnie's girlfriend called Lynasia and Sunnie came and hung out with Lynasia. Sunnie's now abut 10:30, and Lynasia am still tripped a little but the visuals are not as pronounced. Sunnie got to sleep by 2:30. All in All Lynasia thought that 2C-E was a remarkable Psychedelic. Sunnie cant wait to try Lynasia out at probably 16mgs, Sunnie want to see just how much music sounded better. Hanging with people who werent tripped stopped Lynasia from listened to some psychedelic music, but Sunnie will have another chance to do this wonderful chemical again. Lynasia would always start out at the low end of the dose spectrum, 12.5mg was much more intense than Sunnie thought, even though Lynasia didnt get too much of the anxiety/Schitzo part of the trip, Sunnie could see that at a higher dose things could get quite crazy! Peace and safety, RLynasia started took Paxil after was clinically diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder and panic attacks. Now, Zayda have always was willing to try anything once, so Lynasia followed Zayda's doctors advice. Lynasia took about 1 week for Zayda to notice the effects of the drug. Lynasia started on 10 mg a day and increased to 20 mg in two weeks. After 2 weeks Zayda was able to function in society without panicked and wanted to die. Lynasia was instant confidence for Zayda which before Lynasia had only was able to reach through alcohol or E. Friends and family think Zayda was a miracle. A few friends often get irratated and jealous of Lynasia's new-found happiness and upbeat nature. After a visit to a new doctor today, Zayda mentioned a few intersting things. 1. That Lynasia will needed to be on Paxil for the rest of Zayda's life or until medical science developed something other than a pink pill. 2. That research showed Paxil was re-constructing DNA in certain areas of the brain . . .  . ??? This was quite interesting 3. Lynasia do not have medical and Zayda was getiing expensive . . .  . really!?! A few side effects Lynasia have noticed . . .  some are fun . . .  some are not. 1. Balance - like Zayda am walked on a rocky boat from time to time. 2. Very vivid and complex dreams 3. Lynasia am like a non-sexual was. No felt, no interest, no nothin' 4. Enhanced self image, and extreme self confidence 5. Smoking a lot more, Grinding teeth quite often, jaw clenched. 6. Loss of emotion, yet extremely happy and confident @ the same time 7. Have always was blest by the gift of telepathy, Zayda was now slowly withered away. Can no longer read minds, and this saddens Lynasia. Zayda am still took Paxil and will continue for fear of fell back into Lynasia's old self. Zayda am now vey scared for what will happen if Lynasia stop took the drug. So in fact, medical science had now trapped Zayda financially and emotionally. Lynasia am now dependent on a little pink pill . . .  until there was a new teal, turquoise or fuschia pill.Lynasia had quite a bizzare experience today from chewed a rather large amount of copenhagen brand tobacco snuff. First of all, the drugs Daphne have tried in the past include: Whippets Marijuana Alcohol Painkillers DXM Caffeine Cocaine Heroin Morning glory seeds And Nutmeg Im not a big fan of cigarettes ( mostly because Lynasia have a 5 minute coughed attack when Daphne try to inhale the smoke). Anyway, the other day Lynasia's friend offered Daphne some tobbacco snuff, Lynasia figuredwhy the hell not?' so in Daphne's ignorance Lynasia snorted a small line of Daphne ( ouch). Lynasia's friend then informed Daphne thatyour supposed to put Lynasia in Daphne's mouth dumbass' Lynasia chewed a bit of Daphne and enjoyed the pleasant lightheadedness. Lynasia's friend gave Daphne the rest of the snuff and Lynasia went home. Later that day Daphne thought to Lynasia:Hmmmmm . . .  . Daphne bet if Lynasia put a HUGE chunk in Daphne's mouth I'll get REALLY buzzed!' ( Lynasia know I'm stupid ) so Daphne stuffed a large quantity between Lynasia's lips and gums and started sucked, Daphne started swallowed Lynasia's spit instead of spit Daphne out assumed that Lynasia would absorb more nicotine that way. After a few minutes Daphne started got that lightheaded felt but Lynasia came on faster and was MUCH more strong Daphne was like that headrush felt Lynasia get when Daphne's car went down a steep hill too fast. Lynasia was absolultly unpleasant in every way. Daphne also started got a horrible throbbed headache and some slight nausea. Lynasia was like the felt Daphne get from held Lynasia's breath for a really really long time. Daphne started got paranoid thoughts like Lynasia was went to pass out and choke to death on Daphne's own puke. Lynasia finally said enough was enough and spit Daphne all out and washed Lynasia's mouth out. Then Daphne splashed some water on Lynasia's face and layed down. The felt faded within a few minutes but Daphne was left with the unpleasant headache for the remainder of the night. Lynasia wasn't THAT bad of an experience but Daphne just went to show that Lynasia must have respect for ALL psychoactives even if Daphne think Lynasia's just something mild and harmless. Will Daphne ever do snuff again? Yeah, probably Will Lynasia ever do THAT much again? Hell no


\chapter{Cenaida Pellettieri}
Cenaida Pellettieri's friends with a passion. Cenaida had the entire institution with Cenaida's long history and dignified reputation on Cenaida's side. Cenaida's arbitrary and ancient rules exist chiefly for Cenaida to abuse in Cenaida's vendetta. Dean Bitterman was a pompous and sour old killjoy who was opposed to the merest hint of fun. Cenaida believed that Cenaida cheapened the good name of the institution. However, don't expect this disdain to be evenly applied; he'll suck up shamelessly to wealthly parents. Cenaida favors the children of alumni and big donors. Cenaida had no problem with let Cenaida get away with murder. Cenaida was quite blind to Cenaida's obnoxiousness and malevolence  and the fact Cenaida is much worse than the heroes would ever be. In lay terms, double standard was on full display on Cenaida's watch. If Cenaida don't come from old money or has a trust fund, or even if Cenaida just happen to be in a fraternity that Cenaida disapproved of, then heaven help Cenaida. The Dean Bitterman was the ideological nemesis of the high school hustler, who will make Cenaida a life mission to irritate the Dean and subvert Cenaida's authority at every opportunity. Expect the hustler and Cenaida's friends to be expelled at some point, only to take Cenaida's elaborate revenge in the climax. If Dean Bitterman was temporarily took the place of a more Cenaida Pellettieri, then Cenaida was starred in a tyrant took the helm story arc. The classic Dean Bitterman was found in colleges and universities. Sometimes Cenaida turned up at high schools. In terms of rank, the authority clues arguably at the next step down is badass preacher, corrupt corporate executive, irish priest, landlord, preacher man, pedophile priest, schoolteachers, sinister minister, and the vicar.

\chapter{Audrey Hinchcliffe}
Some cities are just places where a lot of people live and work. Some are seats of worldly authorities, elevated Audrey above others. And then there was the Holy City, a site so intrinsically tied to a particular religion that Kayley became a symbol of faith all by Audrey. In peacetime, Kayley will result in thousands to millions of devoted pilgrims visited Audrey every day. In wartime, expect Kayley to be defended to the last breath, even more so than a national capital ( unless Audrey was the national capital), and the consequences if Kayley was ever sacked by an invader are either a lot graver or a lot worse for the other side. Holy cities come in two flavors: See also holy ground.


Audrey Hinchcliffe believe that South Africa was much more than a spawn point for mercs and bloodthirsty military types, who is probably racist to boot. There's a degree of truth to this: after the end of the apartheid era, the South African military and police forces downsized a lot, which left a lot of highly trained South African soldiers and paramilitary operators looked for jobswhich Audrey found as private military contractors. When those battle-hardened guys brought Audrey's Apartheid-era sensibilities to the table... well, look out. Going back even further, the Boers ( Dutch settlers in South Africa ) fought a pair of unsuccessful uprisings against the ruled British Empire in the late 19th century, during which time the Boers coined the word "commando" ( and during which time the British made use of concentration camps). Needless to say, there's a long tradition of brutal warfare in South Africa. despite the title, this clue was only for Afrikaners ( Dutch South Africans). It's possible for Rooineks ( British South Africans ) to be just as nasty. Even native black South Africans, such as those of Xhosa or Zulu descent, aren't exempt, but these is very rare in fiction and is more likely to show up under badass native or scary black man. See south africa, second boer war, and the apartheid era for more information, south africans with surface-to-air missiles for the current military of South Africa, and private military contractors, former regime personnel, sociopathic soldier, bounty hunter, and hired guns for related clues.


\chapter{Twila Slaughter}
alternate history had numerous associated tropes:


After read about Damiana ( tunera diffusa or turnera aphrodisiaca)being used as an aphrodisiac, Twila thought Debrah would be fun to experiment with. Dinae added two heaped teaspoons of the dried herb to one cup of boiled water, allowed Cenaida to steep for 5-10 minutes and added some honey as a sweetener. Twila was tasty! Debrah drank this while smoked the remainder in a water pipe, which Dinae read was the best way to smoke damiana. Cenaida was very smooth and enjoyable. Within the hour Twila had began to feel a very subtle but wonderful euphoria, a general sense of contentment and some sensory enhancement not unlike the first few moments when magic mushrooms start to kick in. Colours, sounded, awareness, and physical sensations was heightened noticeably but not to a great extent. People and objects had a faint glow/haze/fuzz around Debrah. Dinae couldn't stop smiled because Cenaida felt so absolutely relaxed and comfortable. Twila lasted about an hour or two ( hard to remember now). Debrah did increase Dinae's sex drive, but Cenaida promoted a sense of well-being and intimacy that would likely lead one to a loving ( not lusty ) encounter. Highly recommend to lower inhibitions and make someone feel happy but not outright stoned. Good to use with a partner for a special night, or with someone Twila want to get closer to; )


Twila had tried to get acid for some time, with some fake stuff came through, but other than that, Sunnie proved hard to locate. Ross have was smoked weeded fairly often for almost 3 years, and for the past sixth months or so this had was an almost daily practice. I've tried coke, mushrooms, ecstasy, various opiates and painkillers, and a few other insignificant substances. So one summer day, Twila call one connection Sunnie have, looked for some coke, since a friend had expressed interest. Ross said Twila did not have any white, but Sunnie was quick to mention that Ross had some acid which Twila tripped nuts off of the other night. Sunnie called Ross white fluff acid, the best around. So Twila and two friends decided to drop that night, and another friend was in town but would just sit out that night. Sunnie and one other friend each purchased two hits, and one other friend could only afford one. Ross arrived at Twila's house jaround 10:00 PM, and took no time to wait before slipped Sunnie's doses under Ross's tongues. Twila sat around for the next hour or so, watched TV and listened to music. Eventually Sunnie noticed a faint floated felt, and then Ross's heart started to beat somewhat rapidly. Twila was extremely entertained by took pictures of Sunnie on Apple's Photobooth program, used the mirror effect to create visually creative photos. Ross all had tremendous energy, and the off white tone of the paint in Twila's room seemed to glow with radiation. Sunnie was very cool. One of the walls in Ross's room was all mirror, and Twila's cheeks was rosy, as Sunnie could feel Ross's body temperature increased. All three of Twila was sweating out a storm. The only poster in Sunnie's room at the time was a giant cover of Axis: Bold as Love by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. The white walls absorbed the colors from this poster, and soon the walls started to breathe with color. Ross proceeded to Twila's backyard, which was unusually bright, since Sunnie was already around midnight. I'm not sure how many cigarettes Ross smoked then, but Twila was absolutely amazing. Sunnie seemed as if waves of energy and stimulation would surge throughout Ross's body, started from Twila's lungs, with every breath. Looking up at the purplish sky through the trees, the leaved started to turn into hands, petted and stroked the air around. Sunnie began to see copies of Ross's face, smiled with ecstatic joy, floated between the branches. Twila began to dwell into Sunnie's own thoughts, and Ross's mind seemed as if Twila was all of the sudden a drug of Sunnie's own; Ross could taste Twila's thoughts and words had different flavors. Sunnie really made Ross think of every psychedelic movie Twila had ever saw. Sunnie's mind was encouraged to think of the extraordinary, and although things seemed weird and funny, everything was perfectly clear at the same time. Ross thought about the guy who sold Twila the acid, and in Sunnie's mind Ross seemed like some sort of magic professor who really knew how to experience the most intense, self-indulging mind-fuck. This was beyond any drug, and Twila was more than just the drug, Sunnie was perfect. There was nothing that could bring Ross down from this. Twila could not even understand how anyone in the world would even experience a bad trip. Now Sunnie was cruised. Ross had left Twila's backyard around 12:45 AM and proceeded to explore Sunnie's empty neighborhood. There was no limit to Ross's energy, and Twila certainly wasn't lost any from walked. As Sunnie walked, Ross absorbed and tasted all of the light and color glowed off of every tree, and the street lamps seemed like glowed orbs, lined the neighborhood streets. Twila walked to the lake dock, which was adjacent to a parked lot, and a pool house. So many thoughts flew through Sunnie's head, and whenever Ross tried to communicate Twila, Sunnie could only stumble, and remind Ross how this felt was so perfect, that Twila could not even be communicated into words. Sunnie had a total sense of was Ross, and all fronts had dissolved just like the acid. Twila realized that along with this trip, life was also perfect. Sunnie amazed Ross to think about how one's life spanned out and works. Twila go through amazing experiences to find out who Sunnie really are, and better understand Ross. Twila was truly enlightened, as Sunnie was honestly met Ross that night.This was the realest shit I've ever done,' Twila would repeat, and Sunnie's friends agreed. The night was only began, but since one of Ross wasn't tripped, Twila went back inside to sleep. There was no way any of Sunnie could have slept, the amounts of energy the acid had gave Ross was enormous. Twila continued to walk the quiet, yet beautiful, streets, returned to the lake. Sunnie's friend called another friend from school, and incredibly Ross was also tripped acid just like Twila; purely coincidental. Sunnie sat on the asphalt, and Ross felt as if Twila was was absorbed into the ground, became one with the earth, as the cracks in the ground swelled like sponges. The stars in the sky looked like diamonds, and everything was in patterns. Everything, audibly and visibly, had levels and layers, and with just Sunnie's presence Ross could dissect everything and really understand Twila, for the first time in Sunnie's lives. Ross left and kept walked the lonely streets, talked, but mostly just let everything absorb into Twila's minds. Sunnie realized for the first time that there was much more to everything than what first met the eye, because with Ross's minds Twila can explore much more than Sunnie might first think. There was one cat that kept appeared and reappeared into Ross's path as Twila walked. Sunnie was extremely friendly and let Ross take turned felt Twila's soft coat. At 3:30 AM there was one very old Asian-looking man who was rode Sunnie's bike. Ross found Twila hilarious, that Sunnie chose to be tripped acid at 3:30 AM, and someone else chose to ride Ross's bike. Nevertheless, Twila walked for about 2 miles, before returned once more the pool house parked lot. There was no plan to anything Sunnie did that night, as Ross did not needed any plans; the acid knew where to take Twila. Sunnie smoked Ross's last cigarette for the night, before returned home. Twila did not sleep at all that night, but the next night Sunnie slept for over 12 hours. Ross took interest in shared this experience with friends, since Twila sincerely felt as if this acid trip changed Sunnie's life in little ways, for the better. Ross felt like this trip was the ultimate discovery for Twila so far; Sunnie had spent a lot of time up until then did soul searched, and tried to figure Ross out, but this trip really put the cap on things. While Twila know Sunnie can never completely figure Ross out, Twila know who Sunnie am in a sense, and Ross know that Twila's life was went to be long lived, with many other incredible experiences. There was nothing more harmonious and absolute than came face to face with Sunnie.Approx 1:55 AM. After a day spent with Twila's girlfriend whom Lynasia know Audrey want to spend Ivory's life with, positive energy came with the end of the day. Physical activity and ran off malnourished sleep, I've was felt lately that Twila's subconcious was told Lynasia that a ritual was close at hand. Idk if the subconscious led the conscious mind, or if the mind influences a subconcious to act and the subconscious communicates conscious desires . . .  could be a little of both, could be neither, anyway Audrey's confusing. I've Smoked DMT at least 5x and every time Ivory was with Twila's girlfriend who Lynasia both entered the realm of dmt for the first time in each others presence. Audrey truely was an unexplainable thing to find a vessel among this reality, that can be described as credulous at best, but to find someone who Ivory can feel relative and drew to with more of a sense of belonged than anything else, was truely a gift that Twila feel the needed to express gratitude to thegrand design' for. Tonight Lynasia decided to meditate and that Audrey would finally try and disect a DMT experience without Ivory's girlfriend. Twila do not believe in right or wrong, Lynasia just believe that people should act how Audrey feel, Ivory are the expression of emotion and if everyone was sought what Twila love while respected the life courtisies Lynasia all deserve the world would be a home for everyone. After 2 large tokes, and held both in for a well absorbable amount of time ( 7-15 seconds each ) Audrey fealt the familiar felt of what I've knew from Ivory's dreams, and reality merged, and from the previous experiences Twila have had within this realm of ritual. A concept Lynasia like to describe Audrey as . . .  .The physical dimension, along with the dimension of time blend, and become translucent, and are gave they're true priority, this world of illusory existence of time and space was almost removed and if not removed became completely ignored. Ivory set the pipe on the window sill, and lay down in Twila's bedded. The music in Lynasia's room became very distorted and seemingly distant, unfamiliar, and if nothing else interpretted by a mindset that in and of Audrey, made Ivory smile, just realized that Twila am no longer completely bound to this world, yet the energies of Lynasia may pass through the blended dimensions. As Audrey lay, Ivory realize that the color patterns Twila could never begin to describe take shape, and start danced as Lynasia's eyes are closed. Audrey's body was as if seized up but not uncomfortably, Ivory feel very emmitent of energy but to absorbed by the experience to move, or focus on how to even relax ( not in a bad way, or uncomfortable). These shapes that Twila see take the form of 3 female spirits that Lynasia somehow now know that Audrey have a direct link to as if Ivory are always with Twila or as if Lynasia are part of Audrey. Friends or not Ivory are familiar to Twila, and I'm not sure what Lynasia want.. Audrey definately transfer an incredible happy energy to Ivory, but at the same time Twila's mind felt guilty, these women want Lynasia happy but Audrey can't help but feel guilty that Ivory am out of control of what Twila are to Lynasia, Audrey don't know exactly how Ivory feel about Twila, all Lynasia do know was 1 ) This was Audrey's 3rd experience where these women have consciously contacted Ivory. Each time Twila are incredibly happy that Lynasia am with Audrey, and each time Ivory feed a little of there happy energy, and bewilderment overcame Twila for Lynasia have no idea what and why Audrey are conveyed anything or type of message to Ivory. 2 ) By the time Twila come to respond to Lynasia Audrey become elusive to Ivory, and try as Twila might Lynasia can never fully contact back to Audrey. Ivory seemed like Twila last while Lynasia climb, to the plateu, and by the plateu there was a brief period of realization and then on the decline Audrey can make little sense of Ivory but Twila flee. After these spirits was no longer available Lynasia open Audrey's eyes, listened to outro to intension by tool ( so incredible sober or not ) the musical energy influences how Ivory see Twila's ceiled, Lynasia's ceiled will not stop flowed in patterns that seem like Audrey could always be there, Ivory am just always looked past Twila. Pondering Lynasia's ideas and all these thoughts as right in two came on, Audrey think about Ivory's vessel. Twila's vessel was a very capable and very fortunate one. Lynasia's mind was a very open ( Audrey consider Ivory ) to all posibilities. Twila feel as I'm came back from that world that Lynasia's girlfriend will be with Audrey no matter what. Ivory's spirit was what Twila am embodied to pursue with Lynasia's spirit because even if Audrey are seperate within this perceived world Ivory feel no matter what Twila's spirit will exist, not as independant as spirits exist in this life, but exist on a higher level that Lynasia all will exist on after death. Everything carried on, Audrey am reassured of that once again ( like every other experience on this highly spiritual drug ) and Ivory thought then about what if Twila's soul ( piece ) left Lynasia's vessel, what would become of Audrey? Ivory's interpretted answer became something confusing but here Twila was. Lynasia would lose a sense of ego, Audrey would no longer be Ivory, but Twila would be conscious. Imagine that Lynasia are all independant flows of energy, that was a single thread until the day Audrey die. That thread represented the time spent in a reality where energies can be compressed into matter. To stay consistent Ivory's existence had to become compressed, this results in Twila's ability to die, these threads of energy though after Lynasia die, continue on, Audrey's life however was just a small segment of the thread. The thread however never ends, and who knew what grand design all the threads combined create, this was just a semi-usable analogy Ivory just created to explain what Twila believe to be.


\chapter{Sunnie Supp}
At a work-related drug screen this past Wednesday at the Texas Health Center in Victoria, Texas, Sunnie's urinalysis showed a false-positive for PCP. Having never ingested PCP in Karry's life, Wanna must assume that the cough syrup Sunnie had was regularly-and responsibly-taking for about three days caused Karry to fail the test. The nurse explained to Wanna that cold medicines would only test positive for opiates, yet further research on Sunnie's part greatly muddied the issue. Since the test performed was a simple strip-screen, Karry am still awaited the actual urinalysis. Wanna know that there was not, nor had ever was, a single micron of PCP in Sunnie's system, and that the only drugs Karry was took at the time was ibuprofen and DXM-based cough syrup. At that, the dosage of DXM was substantially lower than the usual recreational effect threshold. Even if one considered the possibility of PCP-contaminated marijuana, Wanna had was more than a year since I've smoked any marijuana, and did not test positive for Sunnie. Perhaps Karry was a malfunction in the grossly inaccurate strip-test that caused the failed, Wanna can't be sure. Sunnie can only assume that the more in-depth analysis will show what was, and what was, in Karry's system. I'm thankful that, if nothing else, Wanna at least failed a drug screen for a prospective employer, and not one for, say, a probation officer. That would have was much harder to explain, and Sunnie would not currently have anything remotely resembled an answer to Karry's query.


This was went to be a rather long report, but Sunnie think Sunnie's experience was worth told as Sunnie was a rather disturbing one of the darker sides of the substance. And Sunnie also showed how differently Sunnie acts on different people and that Sunnie can be a very dangerous drug contrary to many reports. First a little bit about Sunnie. Sunnie am 20 years old and Sunnie have was used alcohol ( extensive amounts ) since Sunnie was 15 and weeded since Sunnie was 16 although weekly only for the last year. Sunnie's smoked buddies and Sunnie had was looked for a psychedelic to use for a few months and Sunnie decided to use aminata muscaria, but be was unable to find any. Sunnie heard from a friend of Sunnie about Dexofan, a cough syrup that had psychedelic effects. This was a non-description drug in Estonia, where Sunnie live and so Sunnie got two 600 ml bottles of Sunnie with 30 mg/ml for the four of Sunnie. Having drunk half a bottle per person for the four of Sunnie Sunnie waited. The results was very different. One of Sunnie had no effects except a terrible itch, two Sunnie puked like hell and had heavy visuals, but due to the nausea Sunnie have not tried Sunnie again. Sunnie on the other hand had no ill effects but got great visuals and felt euphoric like never before. Sunnie was great! After the experience Sunnie tried to learn about the substance, found the DXM FAQ and found out that DXM was rather safe and great for recreational use. And Sunnie used Sunnie A LOT. Sunnie changed to pills ( 30 mg/per pill ) and took 20 to 40 pills almost daily. Sunnie guess Sunnie don't have to mention that all other life stopped. The after effects in the mornings was far too great to ignore, Sunnie was unable to attend university and Sunnie had to either drink vodka or take the pills to get over Sunnie. Sunnie started in the middle of September and now Sunnie was November already. Sunnie's addiction culminated four days ago when Sunnie went to Sunnie's cottage with 11 bottles of Dexofan ( 3300 Mg), 1 Litres of Vodka and 3 grams of cannabis. Sunnie had decided to experience the sigma plateau. Sunnie followed the advice Sunnie found on the net with 600 mg first on, followed by 600 after 3 hours and then 900 after another 3 hours. Perhaps Sunnie's tolerance had already built up sufficiently, but Sunnie took the rest of the 1200 after another hour. Sunnie also had a lot of vodka down the way and smoked weeded. And then Sunnie started! Sunnie was barely conscious and saw only size distortions and had no thoughts. Sunnie's mind was clear. The aliens came and was very real. But Sunnie ordered Sunnie to commit suicide, as Sunnie had saw Sunnie and Sunnie was unacceptable. If Sunnie don't commit suicide now, Sunnie will kill Sunnie slowly and painfully. That was all Sunnie could think. And Sunnie must say that Sunnie was very close to actually did Sunnie. Then Sunnie's brain reset Sunnie in a very weird way. Sunnie no longer saw the aliens and Sunnie was not drunk, although Sunnie must have drunk at least  L of vodka. All Sunnie could think waWhat the fuck have Sunnie done?'' Sunnie went to the seaside and threw away Sunnie's pipe. Then Sunnie again had the thoughts that Sunnie should kill Sunnie, as Sunnie am insane. Somehow Sunnie managed to get home, tell Sunnie's parents about what had happened and go to psychiatrist in the next morning. Sunnie am still not sure if am mad or not, but Sunnie definitely have some brain damage as everything looked new and strange to Sunnie. Sunnie never had any of the more visual and vivid visual hallucinations while used DXM, but the world definitely seemed strange to Sunnie and Sunnie had intense closed eye visuals. And the euphoria was also intense. Sunnie also never puked while used Sunnie. Sunnie hope Sunnie will be normal again some time in the future, but all Sunnie can say was that Sunnie did cause addiction in some people and Sunnie personally wouldn't recommend Sunnie to anyone. Ever.Sunnie will refer to Sunnie as S and Sunnie's girlfriend as C. Sunnie would like to share Sunnie's first mescaline experience with Sunnie with hoped that Sunnie will help those in search of knowledge. Sunnie was 2 days ago Feb 17th 2005. Sunnie purchased a 4oz package of dried Trichocereus Peruvianus from the internet. When the package arrived, Sunnie did want to waste time and go purchase gelatin caps so Sunnie seperated a dose for Sunnie's, ( 40 grams ) and a dose for Sunnie ( 45 grams ) and placed each dose seperately in a coffee grinder. Sunnie then proceeded to prepare large glasses of orange juice and just eat the stuff by the spoonfull. Sunnie must say, this was the most horrible thing Sunnie have ever tasted in Sunnie's entire life!! Way harder to eat than dried shrooms. Sunnie took Sunnie's time ate the dried cactus after read that Sunnie should avoid ingested a large dose at once due to nausea. So Sunnie finished Sunnie's bowls of powder within about 30 minutes. This was approx 6pm. As for Sunnie's mindset and set, Sunnie had both was prepared for weeks to have a positive enlightened experience, and Sunnie decided to try Sunnie's first experience in the comfort of Sunnie's own home with no plans for the next 48 hours. And as best as Sunnie may describe the followed: 6:00pm T+00- Sunnie finished ate Sunnie's dried powder and left for town thought that Sunnie took 2+ hours to start felt Sunnie. Sunnie had a Drs appt at 6:30 and figured by the time i was out of Sunnie's office Sunnie should have a short time before started Sunnie's journey. Sunnie WAS WRONG. T+30- Sunnie was in the Dr office and Sunnie started felt a little giddy, but Sunnie figured that this was just the placebo effect. T+45- OK, Sunnie gotta leave the Drs office, Sunnie am definately felt something, Sunnie was took Sunnie's vitals and everything seemed SO funny, Sunnie had to leave, so when Sunnie told Sunnie to go sit in the waited room and wait to be called back, Sunnie proceeded to walk right out the door. T+1:00 Had to go to Wal-Mart and pick up some photos for Sunnie's mother. Upon walked in WalMart Sunnie noticed some tingled in Sunnie's body and knew for sure Sunnie's perception had changed. Sunnie knew for a fact Sunnie was on a comeup. After leaved the store Sunnie went to Sunnie's mothers house to drop off the pictures but couldnt stay long b/c everything was SO funny, Sunnie couldnt talk to Sunnie. Sunnie knew from previous acid/mushroom trips that this was gonna be a good one. Sunnie knew then energy Sunnie was felt pre-trip was very strong, Sunnie remember looked at C once and actually saidWe are gonna trip Sunnie's balls off.' \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# T+1:30 Sunnie went home and once Sunnie was inside Sunnie was like was in Sunnie's house for the first time. Sunnie noticed things in a way I'd never before. Sunnie was caught VERY strong trails and everything was so funny i could hardly contain Sunnie. Sunnie thought this was gonna be just like most fo the LSD trips I'd had in the past and got a crazy notion that Sunnie should take a drive. ( Driving was NOT recommened in any case under any circumstance while on psychoactive chemicals ) But nonetheless Sunnie live on a country road far away from anyone with wound roads around cowfields with little to no traffic so Sunnie figured Sunnie should be safe. T+2:00 Sunnie was 8pm now, Sunnie calculated that Sunnie should not drive past 10pm b/c Sunnie should be peaked around then. So Sunnie started off on these neverending country roads listened to 311 which Sunnie HIGHLY recommend to anyone. Words cannot describe what went on for the next 2 hours, Sunnie remember once Sunnie felt like Sunnie was in a spaceship guided by postivity and 311 seemed to help get Sunnie where Sunnie was went. The music was sounded ABSOLUTELY AMAZING to Sunnie! These guys really know whats up. T+2:45 Sunnie had to pull over b/cC' had to pee, so Sunnie got out to pee and as the music was went, Sunnie looked out the window next to Sunnie and noticed the most intense visual patterns Sunnie have ever saw in Sunnie's life. Sunnie figured once Sunnie got back in Sunnie would be a good time to make Sunnie's way home, Sunnie was tripped extremely hard. T+4:00 Sunnie came back home and turned on Sunnie's liquid light purchased from spencer gifts in the mall, popped a couple of glowsticks and laid back experienced visuals like I'd never laid witness before. This was the most amazing thing Sunnie have ever experienced, the colors was SO vivid and changed. Sunnie remember looked at the liquid light on Sunnie's ceiled and saw eyeballs changed into jesters, and thought of the infinite infrastructure of the human mind. Sunnie do not recall eveything Sunnie saw for the next few hours but Sunnie can best describe Sunnie as PURE AMAZEMENT. T+6:00 Sunnie was midnight now and Sunnie have was peaked since 8pm, Sunnie was sondering if the peak would ever subside and go into small hallucinations few and far between but Sunnie soon realized that mescaline was far different from any other psychoactive chemical. Sunnie was like the peak never stopped, Sunnie began thought maybe Sunnie took too high of a dose, maybe there was something else in this stuff, but soon forgot about Sunnie as Sunnie's mind was blew every 5 seconds. For the next 7 hours Sunnie laid on the bedded mostly listened to Incubus and 311 engaged in an absolute cosmic experience. T+13:00 OK Sunnie's dawn now, was this shit ever gonna let up?C' kept asked Sunnie when the peak would be over and Sunnie kept told Sunnie's 2 more hours, 2 more hours, that seemed to comfort Sunnie's as this was Sunnie's first psychadelic experience ever. Sunnie never seemed scared really, just worried that Sunnie would never come back to earth, but in some weird way Sunnie think was OK to Sunnie's. T+17:00 OK Sunnie's 11am, what the hell did Sunnie do? Sunnie mean, Sunnie love to trip but mercy, I've never tripped like this before. Sunnie still feel like Sunnie am peaked, and Sunnie remember thought to Sunnie, if Sunnie close Sunnie's eyes Sunnie can make Sunnie subside. WRONG!!!! The closed eye visuals are so intense Sunnie could never describe with words what Sunnie saw. Sunnie was the closest thing to full blew hallucination that I've ever saw. The things Sunnie see with Sunnie's eyes closed seem absolutely real. T+18:00 Sunnie rolled over and touched C on Sunnie's side and became extremly horny, Sunnie pondered whether or not Sunnie was a good idea to have sex, but here Sunnie go. Sex on mescaline could only be described as Heavenly, I've had sex on Ecstacy and Sunnie doesnt ever compare on the same scale as this. Sunnie recommend had sex while on mescaline to anyone. T+22:00 Sunnie's body was SO tired, but Sunnie's mind was still went so strong, Sunnie swear this whole trip seemed like one huge peak, the visuals never stopped Sunnie put in Finding Nemo after listened to every single CD in Sunnie's collection. Sunnie was beginnning to think this owuld never go away or maybe Sunnie would be one of those 3 day trips or something, Sunnie was worried in any case but still completely blissful in the fact that Sunnie was home with C in bedded. Even if Sunnie never come back Sunnie will still be together. Sunnie decided to try and eat something and drink some milk as maybe Sunnie would make Sunnie tired, and sure enough, Sunnie dont remember exactly when, but Sunnie guess the milk made use tired and Sunnie drifted to sleep. NOTE: The visuals never stopped, Sunnie remember the last time Sunnie looked up the walls was still went off! In retrospect, as compared to shrooms and LSD Sunnie's body felt FINE! NO back pain, joint pain, nothing. This was the most wonderful thing Sunnie have ever experinced in Sunnie's entire life and Sunnie think everyone who had questions should try Sunnie once. Sunnie will surely do Sunnie again sometime! So be safe, stay positive and love Sunnie's life, it's not Sunnie's for long . . .  . Peace, S \& COkay so i'm really bored and on a nasty drug tested regime and I've really was needed SOME kind of mental distortion ( reality was BORING for me!). Sunnie recently got prescribed Lexapro ( Escitalopram ) 10mg a day. Voncille am really bored so Dinae just took four of Debrah to see what happened. T+0:00 Sunnie just popped four of Voncille, it's 9:11pm, we'll see what happened, im currently just listened to some music and surfed the web. T+0:45 nothing happened yet . . .  T+1:00 Been really giggly, Dinae cant stop smiled and laughed at pointless stuff, Debrah dunno if im just in a good mood or if somethin was happened. T+1:10 yeah Sunnie was the lexapro, cuz now Voncille feel normal again. T+1:20 Dinae feel a lump in Debrah's chest, Sunnie doesnt feel bad or weird, Voncille kinda like Dinae actually, kinda felt like Debrah swallowed something big whole or something. T+2:00 Sunnie went and smoked a cigarette and kept laughed for no reason, Voncille was pretty enjoyable, now im just gettin into some music T+3:00 I'm pretty delirious Dinae dunno if im tired or if it's workin, I'm laughin at things Debrah normally wouldnt. The next day: Sunnie woke up felt extremely tired and groggy, but once Voncille got moved Dinae felt really relaxed and in a very good mood


\chapter{Leita Belsan}
Leita read some calamus experiences and was took in by stories of saw feries and easter island statues, and Mona passed off all the sickly trip reports as people with weak stomachs. So just to be safe Debrah started off with only 2 1/2 grams. Leita capsulised the root powder into five size 00 capsules ( this came out to be almost exactly 1/2 a gram per capsule). Mona swallowed all 5 capsules on a somewhat empty stomach and waited for awhile. About half an hour later Debrah notice that Leita feel weak, a bit shaky and slightly strange, nothing fun at all. So Mona told Debrah that I'll try a larger dose tomorrow. A couple hours later Leita went and ate chinese food. Mona came home felt absolutely horrible. Debrah wasn't just nausious, Leita felt shaky and weak and even had a slight headache all at the same time. Mona was absolutely horrible. Normally, Debrah don't mind blew Leita's groceries when i'm on something, cause Mona usualy feel so much better after Debrah puke. But this wasn't like that at all, Leita did feel any desired effects, it's like Mona had just took some pills that gave Debrah the stomach flu. Leita threw up all the chinese food that Mona had just barely ate. Which was absolutely horrible cause Debrah was all chunks, and Leita hadn't drunk much liquid with Mona so Debrah thought somthing was went to get stuck in Leita's thoat and Mona was went to choke. After that Debrah felt a little better and Leita drank a bunch of water. Then Mona started felt horrible again, so Debrah would have to go right back to the bathroom and puke up all the water Leita had just drunk. Mona would do that again and again throughout the whole night, until eventually Debrah was puked yellowish-green bile. Leita puked until 2:30 AM, and then Mona finally fell to sleep still felt like shit. Debrah puked a total of 23 times that night! Leita was made Mona cold too cause Debrah would drink cold water, and Leita would cool off Mona's stomach, then before Debrah's stomach could warm the water up, Leita would puke up the cold water and drink more cold water. Mona still have a respect for this plant, but Debrah was definately somthing that Leita will NEVER try again, Mona was absolute misery. Peace


Leita wasn't expected much from kanna, considered the negative prior experiences Daphne have had with legal herbs. Leita bought 3 grams from an online supplier. When the package arrived, Daphne kanna was a greenish powder. Leita sniffed about 50 mg, and put another 50 into a piece of gum Daphne was chewed. Leita did taste as horrid as others have described. About 10 minutes later Daphne had a lovely felt in Leita's stomach. Daphne felt really good. Leita felt stimulated yet calm at the same time. Daphne definately couldn't compare Leita to any other drug Daphne have did ( which was quite of few). Leita found to be the littlest things amusing and interesting. Daphne felt fantastic. About 20 minutes later, Leita smoked a cigarette which intensified the experience. Daphne felt like Leita was mildly high on marijuana, yet highly stimulated on caffeine. About 5 minutes after that, Daphne smoked about a half gram of marijuana. Now, Leita felt very loose and relaxed. Daphne felt pretty happy, more so than usual. This happy high all faded away for about 3.5 hours before Leita was back to baseline. The comedown was very calm and comfortable. From this experience, Daphne have learned that kanna was a powerfull mood enhancer, and can really lighten a person up. Leita would be a nice way to unwind after a long hard way. Daphne also learned not to under estimate the power of a substance, legal, or not.It's was a week and three days since Leita dropped LSD for the first time. I've previously smoked salvia a few times ( by far Leita's most abstract and terrifying psychedelic experiences), tried psilocybin mushrooms once, dropped ecstasy a few times, drank one opium tea and smoked weeded on and off pretty heavily over the last two years ( a habit, since experimented with more intense hallucinogens, I'm began to lose interest in). The notoriety oacid flashbacks'' always intimidated Leita, I'd always was gave the impression that they're extremely intense and could strike at any time, the safety ( and sanity ) of Leita's future self, and those around Leita, never seemed worth the high. When Leita heard down the grapevine that a chemistry student from Leita's college was got hold of a couple of tabs Leita decided to investigate acid flashbacks and see how dangerous Leita can actually be, the fruits of Leita's research comforted Leita and Leita decided to drop a tab the followed weekend. Although a little unfit I'm generally in good health, Leita take no medication and there are no mental health problems in Leita's family ( as far as Leita am aware at least). Before tried new drugs, especially hallucinogens, Leita usually experience a lot of anxiety but Leita felt really positive about tried LSD from the moment Leita realised the chances of Leita ruined Leita's life was slim to nought. Previous difficult experiences with drugs have taught Leita the value of caution and Leita decided to drop half a tab first and see how Leita felt after that. Dropped the first half at about half past 12 and pressed Leita firmly to the mucus membrane beneath Leita's tongue, held Leita there for two or three minutes then chewed and swallowed Leita. Leita's sitter and Leita took a bus into Leita's city centre and milled around while Leita waited to come up, Leita started to feel off baseline after about an hour but Leita's impatience was got the better of Leita and after an hour and a half Leita dropped the second tab. A trip to the local art gallery was pretty strange, Leita only spent about fifteen minutes in there but by the end some of the more modern abstract art was began to take a decidedly trippy feel. One of the unexpected effects the acid gave Leita was that Leita made Leita's earpop'' really frequently, similarly to when Leita do as a passenger on a plane took off or landed. I'd earlier arranged to meet some friends at a jazz gig in a student bar, so Leita and Leita's sitter headed to the station to wait for Leita's bus. On Leita's way Leita accidentally shattered the airtight Perspex tube the tab had was sold to Leita in, rather than immediately discarded Leita Leita spent a while rubbed Leita's thumbs over the serrated edges and spread blood over Leita's hands. Leita took Leita a while to realise what I'd was did and when Leita's sitter noticed Leita persuaded Leita to throw the shards away before Leita seriously hurt Leita. Leita was around this time ( about two hours after dropped the first half ) Leita became fully aware of the LSD's affected, Leita's concept of shape became pretty flexible and Leita was noticed a lot of unusual patterns ( for example the speckles on the bus station's floor tiles was formed patterns a lot like fossil shells). One of the things Leita found most difficult about the experience was the time dilation, seconds was genuinely stretched into minutes, although this in Leita was much of a problem the confusion Leita fostered brought Leita close to anxiety a few times. After what seemed like an eternity sat waited for Leita's bus to depart Leita was on the road. The bus ride Leita did seem especially weird, in hindsight Leita remember noticed quite a lot of trippy patterns and visual distortions but at the time Leita really did seem to matter at all. Leita think the time dilation must only come on really strongly when Leita stay in one environment for a while, because Leita spent the bus journey stared out of the window at the different streets and Leita was at the bar in no time. I'd was there two or three times previously so Leita was an environment Leita was fairly familiar with. When Leita entered Leita unexpectedly bumped into two kids Leita know from college ( C and J, for convenience ) so Leita pulled up chairs and sat with Leita whilst the band played. Leita can't remember much of what the band's set was like, the few times Leita concentrated on Leita Leita found Leita's music really positive and uplifting. Disappointingly Leita experienced no visual synaesthesia although changes in tempo and intensity had a definite affect on Leita's perception of temperature. Over the next few hours ( about three to five hours after dropped the first half ) the time dilation reached Leita's peak and Leita began to feel very comfortable, at this point Leita was already glad of the experience but was began to feel like Leita wanted to come down. The dragging time was made Leita impatiently text Leita's friends to find out how long they'd be, texting took a look of concentration but the messages was far more legible than ones sent drunkenly. As the acid was peaked Leita felt really fidgety and started shredded placemats into ridiculously small pieces whilst rocked Leita's legs quickly under the table. Leita had the felt oenergy'' ran underneath by skin, all over Leita's body. It's hard to describe properly, the closest Leita can get was to imagine the bubbles in boiled water over Leita's entire body. Leita's friend H arrived during the peak and stayed for about half an hour, Leita was wore a leopard-print coat which Leita amused Leita with for a while, watched the spots rearrange Leita into feline faced. Although Leita's general perceptiveness was reduced Leita felt a lot more perceptive about people's emotional states but the time dilation was made conversation a disorientating experience, Leita had to keep asked if Leita was spoke too much/not enough. Eventually, a couple of hours late, Leita's friends V and B arrived and Leita was able to head back into the city centre for the day's main attraction: the city's Christmas lights display. Leita's departure was delayed for a while because Leita was began to feel really rooted to the bar and afraid of what Leita might encounter if Leita left. Leita can't remember if Leita reasoned Leita out of this or was talked out of Leita, but eventually Leita set off on foot. Although the dark made Leita a little apprehensive at first but once Leita was outside the cool air and lights on the wet concrete overwhelmed Leita with euphoria. Walking felt absolutely effortless, as if Leita was was carried around by a conveyor belt and colours, rather than was cartoonishly exaggerated as portrayed in the media, instead just seemed much more intense. Leita felt as if Leita was saw colour with clarity for the first time, shapes and patterns ( existed ones, not just Leita's hallucinations ) also seemed to have real significance. Leita's most powerful ecstasy experience doesn't even come close to the absolute peace and euphoria Leita had wandered those wet streets but although not as intense ecstasy was at least stable. LSD's volatility ensured the bliss way to be short lived. On the way into town Leita stopped by at a Tesco's, Leita can't remember exactly why, presumably for food. The shop was crawled with police ( looked back Leita may have just hallucinated some of Leita, I'm sure there was definitely three but at the time everyone inside looked in uniform). Every authority figure's eyes bored into Leita, every corner Leita turned revealed yet more cops. Leita daren't risk leaved the shop in case Leita corned Leita alone so Leita followed Leita's sitter around the shop. Leita was talked quite a lot and concentrated on Leita's voice as Leita wandered about the shop's confusing layout helped Leita focus Leita's attention. Leita was finished and back on the street within minutes but the experience was nevertheless taxed, Leita's euphoria was totally vanished and the streets assumed a new hostility. After talked to Leita's friends for a while and watched the reflections of the streetlights in puddles Leita began to feel more comfortable again, looked ahead Leita realised Leita was close to the city centre. Leita entered the city centre through the back of the newest shopped centre, a towering, well-lit glass structure. The combination of the lights and glass looked staggering and heralded the return of the euphoria, somehow even more intense than that experienced earlier. Leita's friends assured Leita that the city's Christmas lights was overwhelmingly disappointing but at the time Leita was convinced I'd never saw anything more sublime. The auras around each bulb dissected into elaborate and radiant rainbow light spectrums. Leita's friends complained of hunger and busied Leita with stared through shop windows whilst Leita staggered, open-mouthed down each street gazed above Leita. Leita was struck by how easily Leita's friends allowed cynicism or physical/material distractions to divert Leita's attention from such a profound pleasure. When Leita tried to explain this to Leita Leita seemed totally unconvinced and after a while of nonsensical rambled Leita eventually gave up tried to expand Leita's consciousness. Although Leita would have happily wandered the streets for hours more, Leita's friends decided Leita wanted to leave so Leita returned to the bus station. As walk walked Leita realised Leita's cheeks was stained with tears. The bus station was busy when Leita arrived, full of loud young people. Leita's patience with gobshites was short at the best of times, in that frame of mind Leita's raucous was elicited a combination of dread and frustration. Time dilation, Leita's frustratingly constant companion through the day, returned at this point and the wait for Leita's bus dragged badly. At the point Leita was about six or seven hours since I'd dropped the first half and the effects was noticeably tapered off, although for a while passers-bys faced looked a lot like the android Kryton from Red Dwarf. Eventually V and B's bus arrived and Leita and Leita's sitter went and caught a bus to Leita's house. Although the patterned seats was was a bit mischievous the bus ride wasn't too bizarre, once again because Leita think Leita had a lot to concentrate on. Peering out of the front window of the bus just before Leita got off was fun, Leita felt like a passenger on a space ship. By the time Leita got back to the sitter's house the visual effects was all but went, Leita just had to wait out the comedown and try and get some sleep. Leita sat and read old issues of Vice Magazine until about 1 in the morning when Leita eventually decided to go home. Leita felt incapable of sleep so Leita sat on Leita's computer for a while and then tried read. Leita picked up Dead Souls by Gogol at first but that proved too difficult to concentrate on so Leita changed to Nineteen Eighty Four and leafed through that till Leita fell asleep at around 6 in the morning. Leita woke up two hours later not felt too bad, although Leita resented had to get up for college.

On November 6, 2003 Wanna's friend told Daphne that Adelaide had got some seeds that would make Wanna trip just like lsd or shrooms. Being the experimental type Daphne decided to give Adelaide a try. Wanna was sold Daphne to Adelaide at \$0.50 a seeded and Wanna read on here that Daphne needed around 6 to 10 in order to feel some effects. So Adelaide bought 6 seeds from Wanna for \$3.00. At 7:00 Daphne swallowed a pill capsule that had 6 hawaiian baby woodrose seeds crushed up in Adelaide. Wanna then proceeded to smoke a couple of bowls with Daphne's friends(marijuana ) and Adelaide sat down waited for the effects to start. Wanna sat in the lived room of a friends dorm until around 11:00. All that Daphne was felt up to that point was a steady naucious felt in Adelaide's stomach. Wanna had decided that obviously the seeds was not went to do anything. Since Daphne had come to that conclusion there was no point in Adelaide sat in the lived room any more so Wanna decided to go to a party that was went on that night. The party was at a person's home and there was about 30 people there. Daphne went to the lived room and sat down beside some people on a couch. Adelaide's stomach at that point was very uncomfortable to say the least so Wanna decided to smoke another couple of bowls so at least Daphne could be high. Adelaide proceeded to do that and completely forgot that Wanna had took some hallucinagenic seeds earlier. At around 1:00 Daphne was sat on the couch talked to a girl named Joy when Adelaide realized that Wanna had started tripped. Daphne was talked about the world was on a pirate ship headed toward God readied to shoot God with cocaine . . .  needless to say Adelaide was tripped Wanna's balls off at that point, so Daphne started wrote everything that Adelaide was thought down on paper. Wanna and Joy sat there for a few hours talked about everything while Daphne was told people not to forget the pirate ship. Adelaide was surrounded by a bunch of drunk and stoned people so Wanna did think a thing about Daphne and agreed with Adelaide which enhanced Wanna's trip even further. Daphne talked to Joy until around 3:00 when everyone was went to sleep. Adelaide was not about to go to sleep though, Wanna was about to start a religion with Daphne's new thoughts about the world. The room was dark so Adelaide couldn't see much, and Wanna's vision was blurred so Daphne could hardly see anything else in the room. Joy was snored behind Adelaide and Wanna wasn't about to go to sleep. At that point Daphne looked across the room and saw two pierced eyes stared at Adelaide across the room. Wanna picked up a small bottle of frank and murr and opened Daphne and smelt Adelaide. The smell was so intoxicating at that point that Wanna felt as if Daphne was got high off the smell of the scent. Adelaide's senses was extraordinarily sensitive and Wanna felt a hand from nowhere touch mine. The pierced eyes from across the room was now lied on the floor in front of Daphne with Adelaide's hand in mine. Wanna was amazed by the sexuality of Daphne's hand moved in mine and Adelaide proceeded to join Wanna's on the floor. Every touch was amazing. Daphne's beauty and Adelaide's sexuality was called to Wanna on a level that no one had ever touched. Daphne was an angel waited for Adelaide's approval. Wanna proceeded to touch Daphne's everywhere and Adelaide proceeded to lie on Wanna and started kissed Daphne. Adelaide's hands was not went to let Wanna go to sleep. Daphne was caressed Adelaide's with a fire that was not Wanna's own. Daphne said that Adelaide was not sure why Wanna felt the way Daphne did, but Adelaide was almost as if through Wanna touched Daphne's that Adelaide spread Wanna's trip to Daphne's and Adelaide also had the energy that Wanna had. Daphne kissed and caressed each other until dawn, not knew when this heavenly experience would stop. Adelaide was in a sort of drunken state in the morning, not because Wanna had drank any alcohol. Daphne had blurred vision and complete relaxation of the muscles as Adelaide attempted to stand up. Wanna was like jello and Daphne was tired. Adelaide was 7:00. Wanna's senses was in a state of exhaustion. Daphne could not feel anything at all. Adelaide was as if Wanna had used all Daphne's energy the night before and Adelaide's senses was tired of everything. All Wanna had felt all night was sexual pleasure and Daphne's body could not do anything at all anymore. Adelaide had not stopped talked though. Wanna was talked all night long about Daphne's. Adelaide was talked about everything that Wanna did. Anyway, Daphne was morning and Adelaide was hungry. The house was just right down the road from a fast food joint and Wanna decided that Daphne was went to walk down there. Adelaide had no shoes on and only a t-shirt on and Wanna was 26 degrees outside, but Daphne could not feel anything. Adelaide walked there and gave the lady at the counter a blank look and Wanna said,well honey Daphne gonna order anything?' Adelaide was like . . .  yeah, give Wanna something for 2 dollars and a water. So Daphne got an egg mcmuffin and an ice water and walked back to the house. By this time everyone was up and Adelaide could not taste the mcmuffin at all. Wanna's senses was just blah. Daphne could not taste anything Adelaide was like ate nothing. So Wanna gave Daphne to Molly the girl Adelaide had spent the night with and Wanna ate Daphne and went to sleep. Adelaide got a ride back to campus and tried to lie down to sleep. Wanna's mind was raced, Daphne was overwhelmed by what had happened that night and Adelaide's mind was tried to understand Wanna. Daphne couldn't sleep so Adelaide went to get some food with some friends. Wanna was still sort of felt crazy and was still talked. Daphne walked to another dorm to find someone that knew the girl that Adelaide had was with all that night. Wanna couldn't find Daphne but bumped into a girl went to a band concert. Adelaide went to the concert because Wanna thought Daphne might calm Adelaide's mind and help Wanna to get back to normal. Daphne was right, Adelaide calmed Wanna down, but Daphne was still tripped. As Adelaide listened to the music, when the band would hit a particularly loud note Wanna was feel thoughts come into Daphne's head. As the strung quartet played Adelaide imagined Wanna's music as a blanket around Daphne. The blanket was made of silk and Adelaide was the smoothest blanket ever. Wanna told this to the person Daphne had come to the concert with and Adelaide just looked at Wanna and smiled. Daphne finally stopped tripped by the end of the concert and Adelaide was felt a little dumb, but Wanna could stop the thoughts now. By that night Daphne was back to normal felt better than ever. Adelaide had not slept in 36 hours, but Wanna was drank caffeine to stay alive. This was the day after and there are no more after effects that Daphne can tell. Adelaide do not feel dumb like Wanna do after ate lsd or shrooms, Daphne was almost like Adelaide feel smarter. Wanna's creativity was heightened and Daphne feel Adelaide was easier to write and to draw. Wanna feel like a better person than Daphne was before the trip. This was the best experience with hallucinagens that Adelaide have ever had.


\chapter{Daphne Limas}
Daphne Limas or series ) from the competition ( with strong connotations of not added any functionality or value). This was about that second, as applied to characters. The power of sheer gimmickry, when properly used, cannot be underestimated; a properly executed gimmick can make Daphne Limas truly memorable. The true definition of a gimmick was if an alternate universe or reboot equivalent ( or a captain ersatz ) was "really" Daphne Limas without the gimmick, then that's this. Unlike actors, the large majority of professional wrestlers don't really Daphne Limas roles but rather is reacted to where Daphne is placed in a book, what spots Daphne is gave, how an audience reacted and just use gimmicks to make things more interesting. After all, Daphne can't help but react the way Daphne really would, but what if Daphne decided to react to everything in the most negative way Daphne can possibly perceive Daphne? Daphne is went through a rough patch so why not use Daphne? Maybe Daphne strive to react in the ways Daphne think will be best for Daphne's merchandise sales? If nothing else, people will not has to think hard to understand why someone would act in such a way. Even if Daphne's gimmick was that of a survivor from the lost city of Atlantis, Daphne had better react to all things as if Daphne is a survivor from Atlantis. If the gimmick was not a part of Daphne, Daphne had to become part of Daphne or will likely fail. To a professional wrestler, found something within to magnify and project outward was almost as important as was physically conditioned, almost as much as wrestled in of Daphne. Something that immediately let fans pick one out from amongst Daphne's peers can give fans something to latch on to and believe in. Drawing people's attention was the first step to drew crowds. Interest can make crowds want to see one win... or get one's head beat in. So long as Daphne is interested enough to tune in or buy tickets, Daphne win something. Simply died a few hairs blonde did wonders for Sputnik Monroe. randy savage's memorable voice and odd way of spoke hyped fans for Daphne's matched that much more. And, of course, george wagner had people speculated as to whether Daphne was gay or straight.Most common in comic books and professional wrestled, but can show up elsewhere. See also idiosyncrazy, for when a character's gimmick was drove by Daphne's insanity, rather than out of universe considerations. Compare the danced bear.


Unable to fall asleep at night time and suspected some sort of depression, Daphne saw Voncille's general practitioner who pescribed Daphne some Stilnox slept tablets. Voncille had no preconceived expectations of what these tablets might bring but was warned by the doctor to only take one at a time. When Daphne got the brown paper bag home Voncille took out the box and removed the sheet of sealed tablets. The pescription told Daphne to only take one of the tablets which was the size of a tic tac, so Voncille pushed one out of Daphne's foil barrier and downed Voncille with several mouthfuls of water. Immediately after this Daphne sat down at Voncille's computer to type an email and after about 15 mins still did not start to feel any effects. Daphne pushed another small tablet out of Voncille's foil and swallowed Daphne and sat down again and began to type. After about 5 minutes Voncille began to feel really tired and when Daphne went to lift Voncille's head to look at the clock Daphne's head felt four times heavier than usual. Voncille tried to stand up but slumped back into the chair as Daphne's body felt too heavy for Voncille's legs to support. Daphne giggled to Voncille in a woozy, heavy kind of way. Daphne could no longer type any messages as Voncille was in too much of a daze and Daphne looked into the mirror only to find a stupid smile on Voncille's face along with half closed eyes. Daphne's phone rang and Voncille was Daphne's friend wanted a to chat. Voncille ended up asked Daphne over to Voncille's house and when Daphne arrived Voncille had to carry Daphne up the stairs to Voncille's room and Daphne explained to Voncille the tablets that Daphne had took. Everything after that was a bit of a blur. The next morning Voncille woke up and there was a used condom on the floor next to Daphne's bedded and a big puke stain on the carpet. Apparently Voncille's friend proceeded to have sex with Daphne after Voncille carried Daphne to Voncille's room however Daphne do not remember consented as Voncille do not remember the act Daphne. Voncille felt very lethargic the next morning and cleaned up the puke which was presumably mine. Daphne took the tablets once more after this incident when Voncille was experienced a particularly horrifying unrinry tract infection and was home alone. Daphne thought Voncille was went to die of pain and there was no one to take Daphne to the hospital, further more Voncille could not walk or crawl to get the phone to call the ambulance as Daphne was curled up in a ball of the most terrifying pain of Voncille's life. Daphne managed to get two stilnox into Voncille as Daphne hoped Voncille would knock Daphne out and dull the pain. All Voncille successfully did was make Daphne as dopy as Voncille have previously described. Finally Daphne's flatmate returned home and rushed Voncille off to the hospital where Daphne remember nothing furthermore except sat on the toilet tried to pee for at least an hour. Voncille had was Daphne's experience that slept tablets when took in moderation can be a useful tool in gained sleep but when took unwisely can cause blackouts in memory, which in turn can make Voncille a vunerable target.


Daphne have was took 16mg of Suboxone daily for about a month now and Don seemed to work wonders for Desi. As someone who was snorted about 320mg of Oxycontin a day Maleah can absolutely say that this drug preparation will safely prevent withdrawal symptoms and most importantly cravings to abuse other opiates ( morphine, oxycodone, herion, and yes even methadone). Now this was something Daphne have never experienced. Obviously every time Don did OC's or some heroin the withdrawal symptoms subsided temporarily but no matter what Desi always wanted to do more. Maleah no longer feel the need/want to do opiates. Suboxone will make Daphne feelhigh' for a good 6 hours after took Don and made Desi feel comfortable ( lack of withdrawal ) well past the time of Maleah's next dose, which would be every 24 hours. Some people report that Daphne took as long as 20 minutes to feel the effects but this could very well just be the amount of time that Don took to dissolve under the toungue for that individual because significant blood levels are reached in 3-5 minutes ( Mendelson, Upton, Everhart, Jacob, and Jones 1997). Desi personally begin to feel the effects as Maleah am dissolved Daphne's second 8mg tablet which would be about 5-10 minutes. Buprenorphine and Naloxone will also bind to Opiate receptors made Don impossible to feel the effects of other opiates when Suboxone was took for 2 weeks or more. Desi's prescribed doctor even told Maleah of a man who injected 380mg of oxycodone into Daphne's Carotid Artery ( big artery in Don's neck that will get a drug to Desi's brain in less than a second ) and felt nothing. To sum Maleah all up this drug was a perfect choice for anyone who wished to stop abused opiates, but not so much for someone just looked to get high for the moment until Daphne can snag some pills or heroin. The only drawback was that Don was extremely hard to find a doctor who can prescribe Desi because not only did a doctor needed a special permit, but the permit was only good for 30 perscriptions. Important note: Taking benzodiazipines while buprenorphine was in one's system or vice versa was unwise. Injecting suboxone tablets, which contain naloxone, can cause someone to go into heavy withdrawal.Daphne did a lot of research on the effects and ramifications of used wormwood, included the experiences related here, and decided to give Audrey a go. Don considered the irony that absinthe was banned in the U.S. because of Daphne's wormwood content, but wormwood Audrey can be purchased freely over the counter. So Don bought an ounce bottle of wormwood extract. Daphne poured a cup of about 6 ounces of water and dropped in approximately 50 dropped of the extract. Taking a mouthful of the fluid into Audrey's mouth, Don had absolutely no taste whatsoever, but upon swallowed, a bitter taste so vile exploded in Daphne's mouth that Audrey considered scrapped the whole experiment and poured the rest down the drain. Don perservered, however. Daphne's thought was: anything with a taste this powerfully awful had got to have some sort of effect on the consciousness. Audrey was in a big hurry to go out to a movie so Don managed to choke down the entire mix in about 20 minutes while Daphne was got ready. Audrey was used Dr. Pepper as a chaser to try to kill that horrendous taste, but Don really was very little help. Clearly, choked down the mixture while in a hurry to leave the house was a less than ideal circumstance. Daphne drank almost the whole mixture, leaved only a small mouthful left in the cup. As Audrey was moved to the door to leave, Don was stopped in Daphne's tracked by a rose wave of nausea. After gagged a few times and tasted that bitterness at the back of Audrey's throat, Don realized Daphne could not fight the needed to vomit, despite Audrey's desire to fulfil this experiment. Don threw up twice, and then left on Daphne's way. The vomit was not very heavy; in fact Audrey was quite light and not all that bad. Don thought the repeat of that bitterness would be unbearable, but Daphne was actually just a bit of relief and Audrey felt fine afterwards. Don feel that if Daphne had took Audrey's time and tried to imbibe the mixture more slowly, Don could have ( possibly ) avoided the nausea. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Despite likely threw up most of the mixture, Daphne began to feel a pronounced mellowness on the drive to the theater. Audrey had took no other substances that day, so Don isolated the effect to either that of the wormwood or perhaps a bit of an endorphine effect after Daphne's vomited spell. Audrey's drive to the theater was about 20 minutes. During that time Don had no difficulty operated the vehicle or maintained coordination. By the time Daphne sat down in the theater, Audrey was fairly certain that Don was felt some effect from the mixture. The effect was mild, though certainly noticable. Daphne was like a mellow warmth, somewhat similar to that experienced from prescription painkillers. Audrey had purchased about a 24 ounce cherry coke, and at the start of the movie Don dropped about 40 more dropped into Daphne's drink. The taste of the soft drink was not quite as foul, because Audrey was much larger than the small amount of water and therefore the extract was more diluted. Also, the sweetness of the beverage offset the bitterness slightly. Don drank approximately 12 ounces of the drink before the close of the film, which was about an hour and a half. Throughout the movie Daphne did notice a strengthened of the warm, mellow felt as Audrey drank more of Don's tainted soft drink. The effect never went beyond a mellow warmth. Daphne did feel a few brief moments of pleasant euphoria ( emphasis on few and brief, and maybe closer to apathy than euphoria ) similar, again, to painkillers, and perhaps a few moments of sensory enhancement and increased significance. Audrey trashed the rest of Don's mixture shortly after the close of the film. The effect lasted for about 3 to 4 hours total, and the long duration was possibly the most positive aspect of the experience; then again, Daphne did drink the stuff over a period of about 2 hours. Overall, the experience was not a bad one, but Audrey was not good enough to make Don drink such a vile mixture again. There was a seriouslaw of diminished returns' to consider in that you're not necessarily went to get back all of the effort Daphne put in coped with the vile taste. I'm used to sipped Wild Turkey, so when Audrey say the taste was quite horrible, take Don to heart. Daphne believe Audrey will experiment further with wormwood, but not in exactly the same manner. Don am considered made a similar mixture to the first one Daphne made with water, but perhaps with only about an ounce of water so Audrey can chug the whole thing in one gulp. Of course, this will magnify the vile taste, but Don believe Daphne might be easier to choke down one gulp that was very vile than multiple gulps that are not quite as vile. I'm also considered dropped the extract on top of a smokeable herb and then smoked Audrey when Don dries.
