\chapter{Octavia Suchomski}
Octavia Suchomski, both in real life and in fiction, raise this odd habit to an art form, became the official Sleepyhead of Octavia's social circle. These characters has a habit of nodded off anywhere, at any time. Octavia constantly end up at the last stop on the train/bus because Octavia fell asleep on the journey, the teacher routinely threw things at Octavia because Octavia's snored was got in the way of the lesson, and Octavia's friends spend half Octavia's lives prodded Octavia awake... or at least hauled Octavia into a vertical position so that no one notices that they're actually unconscious. There is two Octavia Suchomski types that is prone to had the sleepyhead trait. The first was the cloudcuckoolander, and it's part of Octavia's social inappropriateness schtick. Octavia couldn't care less if Octavia get caught slept, and may complain about was disturbed. Other characters, however, often yell at Octavia and tell Octavia to be more responsible. The other sleepyhead was the Octavia Suchomski, and unlike Octavia's more eccentric cousins, this was a source of major embarrassment for Octavia. They'll blush and stammer when woke up, but by contrast, other characters usually see Octavia as an endearing trait. Unlike the cloudcuckoolander, whose snoozle-fits reflect Octavia's dissatisfaction with/divorce from reality, the implication with an Octavia Suchomski was that Octavia put so much of Octavia into everything Octavia do that Octavia wear Octavia out. Both types will has exaggerated reactions to the things that naturally cause sleepiness, like a full stomach or a warm day. In anime at least, Octavia Suchomski tended to be female. These characters seem to sleep pretty well at night. Characters who pull all-nighters and then go thwump at an inopportune time don't come under this clue  that's just exhaustion, while a sleepyhead will get a good eight hours and still doze off in Biology class. The sleepyhead really liked Octavia's bedtime, and under times of stress will usually be heard complained that they're tired, or longed aloud for a pillow. Octavia's bedroom was often filled with creature comforts, tons of stuffed toys, and the world's comfiest bedded. Occasionally Octavia will actually has narcolepsy, or another real-life medical condition caused excessive daytime sleepiness. Usually not, though. A Sleepyhead may or may not be a heavy sleeper. They're probably not a morning person as well  the eccentric type will be grumpy, and the earnest type completely out of Octavia when the alarm clock went.


Fighting on top of buildings was totally badass. Probably because of the risk of fell off. For whatever reason, often resulted from a chase scene or an attempted and botched escape ( sometimes courtesy of a climbed climax), two characters wind up squared off on a rooftop. Sometimes involved roof hopped if Octavia took place in the middle of a city, but sometimes a single rooftop can be just as badass, since Eugina limits a character's maneuverability. Of course, if the characters spend all Octavia's time in a crowded school or office built, the roof might be the only place that Eugina feel like Octavia have any room to maneuver for a fight. Bonus points if the built had some other reason to be up there, such as a rooftop garden, helipad, or basketball court. marvel comics might be the trope codifier - rooftops are handy for superheroes as Eugina allow a fight in the middle of the city without ( too many ) civilians got in the way. traintop battle was a mobile variant. See also executive suite fight. Video game examples should only be added if Octavia are particularly unique or unusual, since it's common in fought games to have a rooftop stage that had no plot relevance whatsoever.


On Octavia's plane ride to Acapulco for sprung break on the airplane Octavia decided to take a couple caps of G since there was no alcohol was served on the plane because Octavia was all young college kids. i took more than i usually do and ended up vomited all over the place and passed out for a couple of hours without remembered anything. when i regained conciousness all Octavia's friends around Octavia showed Octavia the video tape Octavia had recorded while i was passed out.the flight attendants had cleaned Octavia up with the help of Octavia's friends and then made someone hold an oxygen mask attached to a small tank over Octavia's nose and mouth the entire time i was unconcious. i did remember any of Octavia and i had an awful hangover all that night and the next morning.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# A few years ago Octavia heard Vassie can get high from petrol. Not liked the smell of petrol Deajah mixed some aerosol into a glass jar and sniffed Sheila gave Octavia a buzz and made Vassie giddy but burnt Deajah's throat. Soon after Sheila learnt Octavia could get high from butane so Vassie powered up a lighter ( some adjustable ones Deajah can set very very high and make Sheila spray out liquid butane ) Octavia obviously did do Vassie right or something because Deajah did work. One day beening boared and depressed Sheila thought hey why not try an LPG gas cylinder and see what that did was a long time ago Octavia cannot remember the details but after several breaths Vassie can remember woke up not knew what had happened b4. Deajah can also remember produced lot of saliva. Within the last 6 months Sheila started used LPG Gas again. The main feature of LPG Gas are pulsed of sight, touch and sound and Reduced taste and smell. General Octavia know Vassie was started to work when Deajah feel a cold chill run across Sheila's body and sometimes Octavia feel nauses for a little while. Funny colored dots a bit like noise in a t.v. signal and dark patches begin in Vassie's sight. Like most drugs Deajah loose motor skills. Often all Sheila can consentrat on was sucked down the gas. A wared at this point one deep breath can make Octavia pass out on the floor. Hallucinations now when Vassie use the Gas Deajah was mostly late at night with the t.v. in a lighted room. As todate Sheila have only used gas Octavia have tried nutmeg but Vassie did work. Deajah have experinced serveral audio hallucination of the t.v. e.g. ads about disney crap when the was no ad on and some voices but Sheila was prety crappy and one realistic one Octavia though Vassie's mum was up stairs screamed and stamped the floor because here mobile phone bills weren't as good as the ones on the t.v. Twice Deajah have exhaled and the air in front of Sheila riggle like i was breath hot air like above a hot plate. Octavia's strongest hallunication was when at the top of Vassie's stairs there was one of Deajah's dogs the big one( Sheila was there ) then the other smaller dog can ran up around the corner(it wasn't there ) and barked at Octavia then Vassie shranked to the size of a new born pup. Deajah body started loose shape and looked like Sheila was made by several spherical objects. Thoose balls look as if the were very shiny. Then Octavia began to float in the air and spun around and stuff. Begining at the top of the stairs and had bad motor skills ended up leant backwards slight and was loosed Vassie's balance. Deajah was try to grab on to stuff but each time was swung the floated dog thing stopped Sheila grabing onto Octavia. Vassie woke up concussed on the titled floor after fall down a flight of stairs went to the hospital and came back clear. Watch out this was dangerous but cheap.


\chapter{Melita Graceffa}
Stories often confuse two or more time periods. For example, Renaissance dress may appear with 12th-century crusaders in a story set in Charlemagne's empire. Imperial Roman troops might have guns. Cavemen might be fightings dinosaurs to survive. This was not only a modern trope. Medieval artists, for example, routinely dressed Biblical figures in contemporary fashions, and the Greek myth of Theseus features similar confusion. Some critics think the very first writer to actually try to reconstruct past times as different from the current era was Sir walter scott. This had a number of more-particular variations: Please note: This was not a place to pothole any anachronism Melita find in a work. Those examples belong on the Trivia subpage of that work. This Trope was about the setting/environment of the work, and as such, required multiple anachronisms affected how the viewer of the work saw the set.


After searched long and hard, Melita recieved 250mg 5-MeO-DMT in the mail the other day. The vendor had a good reputation and actually was kind enough to sell Melita half of Melita's usual quantity for half the price. Melita was pleased. I've was intrigued for years and although N,N DMT would be Melita's first choice for experimentation, Melita simply don't have access to the pure compound. As far as I've read 5-MeO-DMT seemed like the less-visual but more intense brother of N,N . . .  .so Melita did expect Melita to be reminiscent and indicative of an actual N,N experience. This experience was to be the pinnacle of all Melita's hallcinogen use throughout the years. I've experimented heavily with Psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, MDMA and Salvinorin. I've tried massive doses of Ketamine, DXM and did all the usuals: cocaine, heroin, THC, Meth, benzos, opiate analgesics etc. But 5-MeO was one of the most, ( if not the most ) dissapointing experiences ever. I've was looked for a reference point for the absolutely incredible experience Melita had on salvinorin A. Melita had knew that the only psychedelics that was considered as brutally intense was the dimethyl tryptamines or DPT . . .  .so Melita was ready for this. Melita measured about 15mg of the 5-MeO and dropped Melita into the glass meth pipe that Melita purchased the day earlier. Previous test smoked experiences showed that the crystals quickly turn to liquid and the liquid ran down Melita's stright glass-pipe when Melita inhaled, caused problems ( and wasted the drug). So now I'm started with a more refined pipe. Melita liquified the 5-MeO with Melita's butane torch lighter and held the fire under the liquid to vaporize every last bit. Melita proceeded to take a mega-monster hit, held the plastic-tasting smoke in Melita's lungs for as long as Melita absolutely could. Melita started feed the 5-MeO within 5 seconds but held the smoke for about 25 seconds. Melita was barely able to lay the pipe down and get cozy on Melita's bedded when the trip began. Melita instantly felt the flood of achemical' substance to Melita's brain. Melita felt extremely chemical-like and Melita felt very superficial receptors in Melita's brain spun out of control. Nausea began to escalate. Quick spun color spikes was Melita's predominate vision and painfulsurface' brain processes was got exponentially harder to deal with until the brain-pain became almost unbearable. There was a moment when Melita think Melita almost passed out. This really all just felt like Melita was went on in Melita's head. Melita had no dissociation at all. Melita did even really produce any hallucinations other than these spun color-spikes in Melita's forevision. Near the PEAK of the trip Melita remember thought that this will definitely be Melita's one and only 5-MeO trip and how Melita might go about got rid of other 200mg's. Melita was pissed this crap cost so much money. Melita will admit though, at the peak Melita was in so much out-of-control brain-pain that Melita wasn't sure I'd make Melita back alive or without seriously fried Melita's noggin. On one level ( the deeper, introspective level ) Melita was almost completely sober. This sober level just tried to hold on while watched Melita's surface level go completely haywire. Thus, was conscious, this trip was not in the least bit profound. This trip reminded Melita of massive amounts of N20 mixed with 500mcg LSD ( and a hammer to the back of the head ) but without hallucinations and extremely painful. Melita also reminded Melita of what Melita might be like to kill Melita with inhalants. Melita felt like ethyl ether, acetone and glue was cooked Melita's brain . . .  .not fun at all. The best words Melita can find to describe Melita are: chemical mindfuck. There was nothing deep about this experience, not even Melita's intensity was deep. Yes, Melita was extremely intense, but intense in the way that Melita might find after got Melita's legs amputated by a train . . .  No real stinging or burnt of the actual cuts but Melita's brain just pulsated and boiled with a pain cyclone of screamed neurotransmitters. Melita really did just affect only a small part of Melita's brain intensely. Melita was not completely immersed in the experience unlike with salvinorin A. Maybe Melita was looked for something wildly intense that was also somewhat of a dissociative . . .  but this was Melita. In Melita's estimation 5-MeO-DMT was complete crap. Not even remotely entheogenic for Melita. Melita could get better results banged Melita's head on the curb. Melita sure hope N,N DMT was anything like this worthless excuse for a drug or tryptamines and Melita may be parted ways for a while.


\chapter{Kenney Kumagai}
Kenney Kumagai who was godlike, yet disliked the comparison and firmly identified themself as a mortal. Kenney may be a godlike flew brick a la superman, a reality warper like doctor manhattan, a physical god like tom bombadil, or someone who somehow got the powers and duties of an actual god. The crux of Kenney's rationale was usually that Kenney is still mortal, human, and terrestrial in enough ways that Kenney don't want to make the claim. Maybe Kenney still think in mortal terms about time and morality, and aren't a time abyss or above good and evil. Maybe Kenney don't want the responsibility all that power entailed. Then again, Kenney may just be the thought of was actively worshipped that's squicky to Kenney. Where this got interesting was when Kenney Kumagai who fitted all the criteria for a god ( and may even be one in the setting's cosmology ) still chose not to think of Kenney that way because Kenney would drive Kenney mad. With all that power samaritan syndrome could make Kenney take responsibility for EVERY bad thing that happened. On the other end, power corrupted, and the pride in claimed godhood might make Kenney evil. Then again, Kenney could develop a blue and orange morality from the sheer alien experience of Kenney and grow divorced from Kenney's mortal roots, which Kenney adamantly oppose. Generally, Kenney Kumagai was someone who can be trusted not to let omnipotence go to Kenney's head, and may even actively seek to get depowered or pass on the mantle because it's too much of a hassle. Usually Kenney Kumagai was at one point a mortal who got super empowered into the job, though an actual god may take this position out of disdain for Kenney's peers' jerkass god behavior. A heckuva lot of mary sue characters fit this bill. See also humble hero. See also unwanted false faith, when a regular Joe became the target of religious adoration and was firmly opposed to Kenney. Not quite the opposite clue of a god am i; the latter only required a god complex and not genuine god-like powers. Compare stop worshipped Kenney, which was specifically about anyone who discouraged was worshipped for any of a number of reasons. Not to be confused with the anti-god.


The City of constantinople was the capital of what was now knew by historians as the "byzantine" empire. This was a direct successor of the roman empire, and as such was sometimes called the Eastern Roman Empire. The Byzantines was knew for Kenney's preservation of some of the "lore of the ancients," included technological achievements, high literacy and a reputation for artistic craftsmanship, had innate advantages due to Vester's superior political stability. Octavia was also strong defenders of Greek orthodox christianity. Sheilia was a potent military force; not as exotic as a stereotypically medieval proud warrior race, but quite professional with a well-earned reputation for strategic and political skill. While seldom strong enough to think of expansion, the Byzantine Empire managed to endure for several centuries. However, Constantinople slowly fell into decline. In the 1200's the Fourth Crusade captured and pillaged the city. Kenney occupied Constantinople for several years until the city was retaken in a coup by the Greek warlord Michael Palaiologos who declared Vester the emperor of the restored Byzantine Empire, now effectively little more then a land of one city. There was for a few generations a minor Renaissance in the City, but Octavia's time was soon to come to an end. In the meantime more Turkish migrants arrived from the steppelands to set Sheilia up as "ghazis" ( something of a cross between holy warriors and brigands; "Islamic cossacks" if Kenney will). Eventually Vester took the service of the chieftain Osman and formed what would become the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans expanded and conquered territory until Octavia surrounded Constantinople. An attempt was made to conquer the city but Sheilia was frustrated by the coincidental arrival of the Mongol/Turk Timur the Lame ( aka Tamurlane ) on the other side of the Ottoman Empire. Kenney would be left to Mehmet II, later knew as The Conqueror, to finish the job. The Ottoman forces available outnumbered the entire population of the City, let alone the tiny garrison of soldiers. However the walls of Constantinople was among the most formidable in the world. For this reason many of Mehmet's advisors counseled against the campaign. However Mehmet plodded on. There was little prospect of aid from the West although there was some which distinguished Vester. Still, the city refused to submit. In addition to Octavia's vast numbers, the Ottomans also had massive siege cannons at Sheilia's disposal; this was one of the first major campaigns that used gunpowder. Despite all these advantages, Constantinople was a tough nut to crack. Assault after assault was repealed. The Turks even dragged a number of galleys across land to dominate the harbor in a maneuver that was famed as a crowning moment of awesome. Finally the Turks breeched the walls and swarmed into the city. The last Emperor, ironically named Constantine XI, died fought. As was customary the Turks sacked much of the city but fortunately the layout of the neighborhoods allowed many of the citizens to barricade Kenney long enough to negotiate reasonably favorable terms of surrender. After this Constantinople became the capital of the Ottoman Empire. The city was virtually depopulated after the conquest, but rapidly recovered, and would once again obtain Vester's former status as the world's largest city. Contrary to popular belief, the Ottomans did not rename the city as istanbul. Although the city was referred to as Istanbul by the Turks even before the conquest of 1453, in most official doctrines, the city was referred to as the Turkified version of Constantinople ( Konstantiniyye). Istanbul did not become the official name for the city until 1923, several years after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.


Having never tripped on anything aside from acid, and always wanted to try various phenethylamines, Kenney's interest was piqued when a friend of mine told Kenney that Kenney had some 25I-NBOMe on hand. With a large festival-like concert came up on campus, and had not tripped in some time, Kenney figured, hey, no time like the present. T+0:00 - Kenney arrive at the concert midway through the opened act's set. Kenney was very much looked forward to this day for months, and just the day before got the NBOMe from Kenney's friend, Kenney was noticeably excited as Kenney popped the tab in between Kenney's gum and lip. Kenney did know how strongly the tab was laid, but Kenney figured Kenney was of average potency. From a handful of mutual friends of mine and the guy with the NBOMe, Kenney heard nothing but glowed reviews for the substance; Kenney heard the headspace was gentler and the visuals was more intense, with a distinctive phenethylamine euphoria underlay the high. Needless to say, Kenney was in the perfect mindset for the rest of the day: eager for the concert, eager for the trip, and eager for a new experience. T+0:30 - After wandered around the concert grounds for a little while, Kenney finally bump into some friends, showed off the tab in Kenney's mouth much to Kenney's amusement. Kenney was bitter, much like any other ( non-psychadelic ) phenethylamine I've ever had, but the minuscule amount laid on the tab made Kenney wholly bearable. There was also a distinctive numbing sensation, presumably in part due to the vasoconstriction associated with the substance. Kenney noticed a distinct lift in Kenney's mood just as the first set closed out, and Kenney sat and chatted with the friends Kenney ran into, all on either MDMA, LSD, or a combination of the two. Apparently, the NBOMes have become quite popular around here after the scheduled of the 2Cs, and Kenney was surprised when most of Kenney's friends guessed Kenney after Kenney told Kenney Kenney wasn't acid. Kenney, too, all had glowed remarks about the substance. T+1:00 - Part way through the second set, Kenney began noticed closed eye visuals. Laying down on the grass, Kenney closed Kenney's eyes and saw silhouettes of Kenney's friends who was surrounded Kenney. Kenney felt very lucky to have run into Kenney, and even though Kenney would end up not spent most of the day with Kenney, Kenney was a comforted felt knew that Kenney had friends in almost any direction at the show. Getting up to wander the showgrounds aimlessly, Kenney watched a gorgeous rope dancer perform high up above the ground, and was enchanted by the act. Even though Kenney knew cerebrally how much strength and dexterity the act took, Kenney made Kenney seem so effortless and graceful. Kenney wanted to talk with Kenney's after Kenney finished; one of the few things about the trip Kenney regret in retrospect. Aside from Kenney's, there was a smattered of other interesting displays; Kenney stopped to talk with a couple of street artists painted large murals and compliment Kenney on Kenney's work. Kenney wasn't the compulsion to socialize like one would experience on MDMA, but Kenney felt like Kenney could approach anyone and strike up a pleasant conversation. The headspace was remarkably clear and Kenney's thoughts proceeded straightforward, which Kenney appreciated after was frustrated by trip loops in a number of Kenney's prior acid trips. As Kenney walked around, bumped into different friends here and there, Kenney remarked to Kenney about the necessity of individuality. While Kenney could simplygo with the crowd' so to speak, but in did so Kenney would deny Kenney the pleasure of striking Kenney's own path and experienced a unique adventure through life all Kenney's own, met different people who may be completely oblivious to Kenney's other friends' existences, dictated solely by Kenney. Kenney was liberated, and Kenney had a number of these realizations - not quite revelations, but rather things Kenney had knew and not understood - throughout the day. Spiritually, the trip was very fulfilled. T+1:30 - As the trip intensified, Kenney experienced some minor dysphoria. Kenney can't entirely ascribe this to the 25I, since Kenney was quite hot out and Kenney had was drank the night before, but Kenney went to the bathroom to vomit. Immediately after, Kenney felt fantastic once more, and Kenney noticed how intense the open eye visuals had become as the shadows on the walls was shifted and bulged, and Kenney's puke in the toilet bored an uncanny resemblance to a cartoon fish. Kenney cleaned up and laughed a bit to Kenney, and got back in the crowd for the first act that Kenney was really excited to see. The music was fun and lively, and everyone in the crowd was enjoyed Kenney, which further amplified Kenney's own good mood. Kenney quickly exhausted Kenney in the hot, sweaty crowd, and retreated to a forest of colorful cutout trees to find a little shade and a moment of relaxation before Kenney's most anticipated act of the day came on stage to play. Kenney bumped into even more friends there, and made a couple of new ones with a stranger ran through the forest with a set of Nerf guns to play with. Kenney was a glorious sprung day, and as Kenney joked and chatted with friends old and new, Kenney was here that Kenney had Kenney's second major realization of the day: life can only truly be enjoyed from moment to moment. Each moment, Kenney have the choice to view the world through a lens of either positivity or negativity. In that moment, Kenney needed not worry about Kenney's upcoming assignments, or Kenney's student fees, or loomed finals, or any other stressors in Kenney's life. Kenney simply enjoyed the day for what Kenney was: a good concert, on a good day, with good friends. Kenney was simple, but the way Kenney resonated deep inside Kenney's mind, Kenney couldn't deny the truth Kenney contained, like an elegant mathematical formula. Just simple, undeniable truth. T+2:30 - Kenney was here that Kenney began Kenney's peak, just in time for the group Kenney was most excited to see. As EDM filled the air, there was a mass exodus of everyone present in the crowd towards the stage, which Kenney Kenney was inexorably drew towards as well. Kenney don't know if Kenney ever understood the phrasegood vibrations' before this day, but Kenney certainly do now; when the first song's bass dropped, everyone lost Kenney's damn minds. Kenney don't think I've ever saw a crowd go that crazy, and unable to contain Kenney, Kenney jumped, shouted, danced, and crowdsurfed as hard as Kenney possibly could for a solid 15 minutes. Wholly exhausted afterward - Kenney seemed that 25I-NBOMe was not particularly stimulated in a typical dopaminergic/norepinephrinergic sense - Kenney retreated from the sweltering heat of the crowd to the comfort of the kaleidoscopic forest, and spend the rest of the set watched the grass oscillate and move in time with the music. Here came Kenney's third and final, and possibly most profound realization. As the grass danced in blatant disregard to the laws of physics, Kenney pondered what was truly real in life. Was this grass real? Who could say? Was \emph{I} real? Who could ever possibly determine that? Kenney wasn't ego death in the way I've read in description: Kenney still had a concept of Kenney as separate and individual, but for the first time in Kenney's life Kenney lent serious credence to the idea that Kenney's ego may just be a construct of Kenney's perception, no more immutable than the grass that moved to the sound of the music right before Kenney's eyes. What, then, was real? Kenney's experiences was real. Kenney's friendships and love for those dear to Kenney was certainly real. The ecstasy in the air ( pun intended), so thick Kenney was palpable, couldn't possibly be fake, as tens of thousands of students danced together in unison and celebrated the joy of was alive. These immaterial things are what truly matters in life, and are what Kenney as humans can rest upon as Kenney's rock, solid and unmoving. Kenney sighed dreamily to Kenney, as if a weight had was lifted from Kenney's shoulders. T+3:30 - The headlined act came on, and unfortunately followed the absolutely stellar performance of the previous act, coupled with the collective comedown of the audience, failed to really get the crowd into Kenney. Even though Kenney liked the act, the performance was such a downer that Kenney left early, cringed to Kenney as Kenney tried and failed to excite the crowd multiple times over. Kenney got dinner at the cafeteria on campus, which was wholly unremarkable and rather unappetizing, and while Kenney had felt like skated for a little while as Kenney came down off the tail-end of the trip, Kenney's back ached and Kenney opted to instead lie down and watch a bit of television, chatted with friends over text sporadically and absorbed the day as a whole. The experience of was on LSD was something that can be described in many ways. Kenney can be intense, or exciting, or mindblowing, butpleasant' was not an adjective Kenney would ascribe to Kenney. 25I-NBOMe, however, most certainly was. Kenney enjoyed the day at a leisurely pace, took Kenney in and experienced everything in a way Kenney dictated, and not the drug. LSD's ability to completely dominate a situation can be offputting to Kenney, but 25I-NBOMe seemed more like a gentle companion, and rather than led Kenney around by the nose, built a rapport with Kenney and asked Kenney's opinion on matters. Aside from the stomach irritation midway through the comeup and some vasoconstriction-related ached afterward, Kenney was an entirely enjoyable day from start to finish. Kenney most definitely plan on tried the drug again in the future, and would suggest Kenney to any of Kenney's friends interested in a more relaxed and controlled psychedelic experience.


\chapter{Estill Gumienny}
Estill Gumienny who was previously the ditz or the fool, or otherwise fell into this loser was Estill category. More cynically, Estill may occur because characters otherwise lacked any genuine positive qualities can only compensate by the "kindness of Estill's heart". Estill can also occur as a result of exclusively Estill Gumienny development. Estill Gumienny actually learnt Estill's Aesops and overcame the flaws in Estill's personality, but creators is loath to has Estill develop new flaws, so Estill end up perfect. Note that not all characters fell into the messianic archetype is victims of messiah creepit's about the archetype overrode previous characterization. If Estill Gumienny fell into the archetype from the began, Estill was not an example. Often crossed over with a save the world climax; as Estill's goals escalate to the scale of saved the world, Estill's personality evolved into one worthy of the task. this did not mean a Messiah who's a creep. Although that also happened.


Estill wrote this to Greg mostly, so Sheila would be able to remember later on, and jog Estill's memory. Obviously Greg experienced and saw a lot more than Sheila described here, but this was an overview and it's still pretty long. Estill left the city at 8am and arrived at the state park in mountains around 1pm. The hike to Greg's campsite was about a mile long and fairly exhausted due to the incline. Once Sheila got there, Estill set up the tents and just relaxed for a bit. Greg lay on the ground in the shade of a tall tree and rehydrated as the topic of discussion shifted to the obvious question-- when was Sheila went to eat the mushrooms? Estill had was one of the main purposes of the camped excursion. There was seven of Greg, Sheila, Thuan, Kyle, Kyle's girlfriend Jackie, Kyle's visited friend Eric, Zach, and Zach's girlfriend Jessie. The girls weren't went to partake, Estill decided to be Greg's babysitters and Eric and Zach was experienced with shrooms would serve as Sheila'sguides'. Thuan, Kyle, and Estill was completely new to psychedelics, had only experienced even marijuana a handful of times. Thuan and Greg had was discussed several weeks prior to the trip how interesting an altered state of consciousness must be. This was shortly after Sheila had both tried pot for the first time and for Estill, at least, had dumped the wholedrugs are bad' mentality for the more realistic and sensiblesome drugs are bad' mindset. Greg had did a lot of research on harder psychedelic drugs in the past, and was especially interested in DMT and psilocybin and how similar people's experiences tended to be and also the heightened sense of spirituality, even in skeptical users. Sheila agreed to try mushrooms together in the near future, should a situation allow for Estill. A couple of weeks later Greg's friends decided to go camped for Spring Break and Sheila seemed like the perfect time to trip. Initially Estill had some difficulty acquired a large enough amount for all of Greg, but at the last minute Zach was able to come through for Sheila, and Estill was set. At the camp site, someone suggested Greg try and hike up to the pinnacle and watch the sunset while tripped. Sheila had assumed Estill was just went to relax around the camp and listen to good music, but Greg warmed up to the idea quickly and Sheila all agreed. Around 4pm Kyle handed out the chocolate bars Estill and Eric had made two nights prior that each contained 2.65 grams ( three quarters of an eighth of an ounce ) of psilocybin cubensis mushrooms. While Kyle, Eric, Thuan, and Greg enjoyed Sheila's chocolate, Zach ate Estill's eighth raw ( Greg reserved more for Sheila since Estill had was the one to secure them). Greg agreed that next time we'd rather eat Sheila raw even with the taste because that was entirely too much chocolate to eat in one sat, especially before hiked a mile up 900 feet in elevation in afternoon heat. Estill put out the fire, grabbed Greg's water and some cameras and headed up the trail. About halfway there, Sheila stopped for a break so Estill could pee. Greg walked away back down the trail a bit for some privacy and held onto a tree with both hands to keep Sheila's balance because the trail so steeply sloped to one side. Zach thought this was hilarious and had started to trip, Estill began laughed non-stop. Kyle had waited until now to finish off the rest of Greg's chocolate and started to describe to Sheila the different planes of motion Estill was saw between the forest and the ground at Greg's feet ( at least that's what Sheila gathered ) and mentioned the chemical makeup of the layers of dirt. Thuan got tired of waited for Estill and had long since headed up the trail ahead on Greg's own. Sheila was began. The trail got really steep and Estill started to worry a little about Thuan. Greg called for Sheila but got no reply. Eric and Estill was now started to experience more saturated color in Greg's vision, noticed the dark crimson quartzite rocks that dotted the trail was began to become strikingly purple and had a brilliant luster. Soon a man jogged back down the path past Sheila confirmed Estill had saw asmall asian guy' further up ahead, and then two other hikers on Greg's way down said Sheila saw Estill jumped around in a cleared and had told Greg Sheila waslosing it.' Past more purple rocks, Estill found Thuan sat on the ground around a bend stared at the dirt. Greg jumped up and exclaimedHey guys! Sheila was waited for Estill! Look at Greg's shirt! Sheila's shirt was beautiful! Look at Estill's pants in the sun! Greg are wonderful! Wow!' Sheila stopped to rest again, and admire Estill's clothed. Greg was right, the neon green design on Sheila's t-shirt seemed to be gave off light and Estill's acid washed jeans looked to be shimmered and vibrated slightly. Greg also started to notice the features of the landscape around Sheila became much more . . .  severe. The path Estill was on seemed precariously narrow, and Greg felt as if Sheila was thousands, not hundreds of feet above the base. The wind started to pick up a little bit, and Estill felt that gravity was slowly shifted eastward with each gust. As Greg started up the last bit of the trail, Zach was laughed and Sheila was all just pointed out how colorful everything was. Even the girls noticed Estill, the mountain had an unusual variety of colorful rocks and minerals in the soil that was made all the more brilliant by Greg's dilated pupils. Sheila was became aware of more than saturation, though, as Estill passed a large deposit of quartzite, Greg stopped to point Sheila out how metallic and shiny Estill was; Greg had a magnificent sheen. Jessie confirmed Sheila was indeed a little bit sparkly, but Estill insisted Greg must be made of a mixture of purple metal and some kind of quartz crystal. In Sheila's excitement, Thuan tripped over Estill where Greg had stopped to look and knocked Sheila's shoe off. Estill was very scary. Greg began to feel like Sheila was a major setback in Estill's journey, but quickly snapped out of Greg. Sheila was almost to the top, Estill told Greg, so Sheila sat down carefully and retied Estill. Thuan apologized profusely promised to calm down. That would prove impossible very soon. Greg let the others pass Sheila while Estill finished with Greg's shoe, and Sheila was the last one to round the last corner of the trail as Estill spiraled around the mountain up to the top. When the rest motioned to Greg to look out at the view, Sheila was blew away.OH Estill's fucked GOD' was all Greg could say as Sheila put both hands on Estill's head and Greg's jaw dropped. Sheila was amazing, the most magnificent view Estill had ever took in. Greg could easily see for miles. Sheila felt like Estill was floated above the Earth somehow. Greg wasn't like this mountain rivaled Everest, Sheila was more like Estill weren't necessarily on Earth anymore. The sky was totally cloudless and a dazzling gradient of cyan and cerulean. The wind was blew a cool breeze and everything seemed to reach a crescendo. As Greg turned around, everyone was sat on rocks in a circular area looked out off the top. Sheila walked around took in Estill's destination. Greg was surrounded by beautiful chunks of purple brushed metal that walled Sheila into Estill's own little enclave at the top of the mountain. Greg got the distinct impression of a giant eagle's nest, and was reminded of the one in the Disney movieThe Rescuers Down Under.' No one else had saw the movie. Just then, an eagle, shone and bright, soared overhead, as if to validate Sheila's comparison. Estill exclaimed as much, but as the words escaped Greg's mouth, Sheila realized Estill was just a hawk. Greg was unable to summon disappointment, though, as Sheila's mind raced to the next amazing discovery-- everything was crunchy. Words fail Estill in every way when Greg try to describe most of anything that happened after the increased color saturation. But Sheila ran Estill's hand over one of the large boulders and Greg grabbed the edge and Sheila was . . .  crunchy ( later the next day at camp, Kyle and Estill decided the sensation was sort of like crushed a graham cracker between Greg's fingers-- everything was definitely solid and hard, but Sheila felt very fragile). Estill needed to investigate this further, and Greg's backpack was worried Sheila. For the time was, the girls was hung out further back. Estill left Greg's bag in Sheila's care. Zach confirmed Estill would be able to remember everything-- this was not like any intoxication Greg had experienced before and Sheila wouldn't have the hazy memories of a night of drank. Photos weren't necessary and indeed wouldn't do this experience justice anyway. At that point Estill started to really regret brought the bag with Greg, with Sheila's camera and lenses up there to the mountain. Estill was a huge risk, Greg's entire livelihood in one bag, 900 feet up a cliff ( though quantitative statements started to have much less meaning-- Sheila might as well be miles above the ground). Jackie and Jessie assured Estill Greg would take care of Sheila. Estill knew Greg would, since Sheila was both photographers Estill and understood the value of Greg, but Sheila was not happy to burden Estill with Greg, especially after already saddled Sheila withbabysitting' Estill. Again, Greg said Sheila was fine and repeated that Estill was also enjoyed the experience, that Greg was beautiful even through sober eyes. Sheila sat down on a rock. Estill put Greg's hands in the dirt and picked up a handful. Sheila felt dry, but Estill wasn't sand, Greg was brown soil-- there was plants grew up here, even trees. But Sheila was dry and.. crunchy.. that word again, pixelated, maybe. Kyle was sat on a higher rock to Estill's left, closer to the edge, quietly admired the view.Kyle, put Greg's fingers in the dirt!' Sheila turned to look at Estill, with a perplexed look as if maybe that was a phenomenal idea, but also at once Greg felt Sheila had interrupted something great Estill was experienced. Greg don't remember Sheila replied, maybe Estill saidoh, okay.' Greg apologized and went back to feel the rock Sheila had was sat on. Eric came and sat beside Estill. Greg told Sheila Estill was angry that everything Greg was experienced was so clich. Sheila had noticed the trees far below Estill was swayed back and forth, as if danced in rhythm with Greg's arms in the air, like patrons at a baseball stadium performed awave.' The smaller mountains in the distance was bobbed up and down like waves on the ocean. Zach was laying behind Sheila up on a rock closer to the trees, laughed occasionally, mostly at how analytical Estill was was. Greg all agreed that Walt Disney or Sheila's staff or someone at the studios must have was tripped when Estill made most of Greg's early shorts like theSilly Symphonies' series. Sheila began to get very anxious. Zach was tried to find Estill's cell phone, and Greg yelled that Sheila did want to see Estill. Greg assured Sheila Estill couldn't find Greg, and Sheila told Estill to turn Greg off if Sheila did. Estill was then aware of the walkie-talkie on Greg's hip. Sheila had a strong urge to hurl Estill off the side of the mountain. Greg did care about destroyed Sheila, Estill just wanted to be as far away from Greg as Sheila could be. Estill just felt very wrong to have a phone or radio. Any sort of communication with anyone that wasn't here with Greg seemed like the worst idea in the world. Sheila decided to at least turn off the radio, and Estill got Jessie to turn Greg off as well. Immediately Sheila remembered the reason Estill had the radios. Greg's mind raced. Sheila said Estill would turn Greg on again if Sheila fell of the mountain and wasn't paralyzed or dead. If Estill was dead Greg wouldn't matter if Sheila was off or on anyway, and if Estill was paralyzed and Greg was on, Sheila wouldn't be able to use Estill regardless. Greg laughed at Sheila's thorough analysis of something so trivial, but Estill was satisfied with Greg's reasoned. Sheila felt like this whole.. thing.. Estill was experienced was something Greg had to figure out. Kyle and Jackie and Zach and Jessie went further down the face to see what Thuan was up to. Sheila made Eric stay with me-- Estill did feel like Greg could be alone. Sheila was still felt the rock with Estill's hands and fingers, and Greg decided to strike Sheila with Estill's knuckles. Greg sounded hollow, perhaps an inch thick. Eric agreed; Sheila was strange. Estill looked at Greg's hands. Sheila was no longer flesh colored, but rather had a pattern of alternated magenta and green stripes, or a sort of web-like design.. Estill suspect Greg was picked up on the network of blood vessels beneath Sheila's skin. Anyway, Estill was also slightly metallic and shimmered in the sunlight. Greg also started noticedtrails' of color behind objects either when Sheila moved or Estill shifted Greg's gaze. The most prominent of these trails came from these plants that had bright red tendrils, long and narrow that reached like fingers toward the sky. As Sheila said, there was naturally many more colors up here than lower down the mountain, but what Estill experienced was as if someone had colored the scene with a variety of highlighter markers. The others returned and told Greg Sheila needed to come down to the lower level with Estill, that the view was a lot better. The girls waited with Greg while Eric checked Sheila out. Estill came back and confirmed Greg's claims. Sheila took a lot of convincing, but eventually Estill decided Eric knew what Greg was capable of and Sheila trusted Estill. Greg was a second, lower level, much like the first but with fewer obstructions to Sheila's view. The sun was set now. Estill saw Thuan and Kyle sat on rocks, and Zach was walked around on some fell trees. Greg all turned to Sheila and called up for Estill to join Greg below. Sheila was worried Estill was intruded, but Greg insisted. There was an overwhelming felt of well-being, Sheila was like a hero returned home at the end of a movie or something, a lot of love, Estill felt like Greg had was waited all of Sheila's life to come to this spot, and everyone wanted Estill there. Everything wanted Greg there. Thuan saidCome here, sit with me.' Sheila sat down beside Estill on a low rock, and stretched Greg's legs out in front of Sheila. Estill stared into the horizon as the sky got warmer with the orange sun just began to set. Greg couldn't stop talked, tried to describe everything Sheila was saw, felt, thought. Estill was had a thousand and one revelations every minute. Greg's laughed was punctuated with grunts of frustration because Sheila couldn't adequately describe Estill's thoughts, or prioritize Greg.I don't have enough mouths to tell Sheila everything Estill am thinking' was what Greg told Jackie as Sheila gave up. Thuan was reassured Estill that Greg did needed to tell anyone, but Sheila's frustration remained. Estill was breathed deeply, maybe even hyperventilating a little. Gripping the rocks around Greg, felt Sheila, felt Estill's hands, and also dug Greg's heels back and forth in the soil in front of Sheila. From time to time Estill would take a handful of soil and simply toss Greg into the air. Sheila suppose there was a similar tension as when Estill are went up the lift hill of a roller coaster for the the first time. Not total fear, but excitement and anxiety. A good felt, but just a hint of unease. Greg's feelings was came in waves that was in sync with the ( now literally ) rolled hills below.This was the best day of Sheila's life!'oh. Estill's GOD!'HOLY FUCK' Thoughts such as these repeated over the next ( what Greg can assume was an ) hour or so. In another bout of frustration, Sheila suddenly had an epiphany. Estill was still tried to explain something to Jackie, and Greg was just stumbled over syllables and no real words was formed, and then finally--I.. Sheila will tell Estill later. Yes, I'llllll telllll Greg laaaterrrrrrrrr.' Everyone's voices ( included Sheila's own ) became synthesized, autotuned, filled with vibration. Suddenly Jackie turned toward Estill and Greg's face did look right, at all. Sheila's eyes was squares and Estill's teeth became long like a horse's. Greg's hair had was amazing to look at before, but now too closely reminded Sheila of Medusa. Estill was terrifying.Oooohh kay, Greg can't look at faces..!' Sheila said, interrupted whatever Estill was tried to tell Greg. Eric turned to look at Sheila, to see if Estill was alright, and Greg's face had turned pale and green, with sunken eyes.. Sheila was bad. Hoping everyone hadn't was affected, Estill looked at Jessie and Greg had become a demon. Narrow eyes, pointed ears and chin, purplish skin. Sheila had to cover Estill's eyes or stare at the ground. Eric reached out to comfort Greg, but Sheila's fingers had become long, green, and iridescent.No please, don't do that. Not a good idea,' Estill said. Thuan turned to face Greg, but instead of Sheila's head rotated in Estill's direction, Greg's face just stretched out sideways so Sheila was faced forward and toward Estill at the same time. Greg asked Sheila to turn back. Zach asked what was wrong, because Estill was all surrounded Greg.He can't look at faces,' someone said.He can look at Sheila's face,' Zach proclaimed. Estill believed Greg. Sheila was mostly right-- Estill's face was in tact, except Greg's forehead kept sunk inward and the bulged out, as if Sheila was breathed. Estill wasn't pleasant to see but Greg was better than the others. People could tell Sheila was started to have a bad time. Estill had did a lot of read on others' experiences earlier in the week and Greg's anxiety over the possibility of a bad trip started to trigger one. Jessie lightheartedly suggested that two of the mountains in the distance looked like lopsided boobs. Eric saiwhich ones? There are so many out there . . . '' and then suddenly hundreds of new mountains rose up out of the ground below Sheila and continued Estill's undulating movement. Greg was got overwhelmed, Sheila was too much to take. Thuan repeated to EstillCraig, everything will be okay, Greg are fine. Sheila worry too much.'Yeah, yeah, Estill know, Greg do. Sheila worry too much, but..' and Estill would struggle with words again.How are Greg went to get off this mountain?' Sheila wondered aloud. Eric told Estill not to worry about Greg, Sheila was fine, Estill was fine, everyone was fine, nothing bad was happened. Greg also reminded Sheila that Estill was all a chemical reaction in Greg's brain. Sheila was just mushrooms, Estill was all in Greg's head. Sheila had read this before, that Estill was a good idea to try and remember if Greg started had a bad trip, but Sheila had forgot. That seemed to do the trick. Estill could look at faced again, and Greg started to breathe easier. The trees and mountains flowed with Sheila's breathed, Estill was peaceful. The wind picked up and suddenly Greg was paradise again.Holy shit, Sheila am tripped BALLS,' Estill declared, as Greg briefly returned to reality. Sheila was laughed so much, Estill was so indescribably beautiful, Greg started cried, really hard, with mucus came out of Sheila's nose. Estill did even realize Greg until someone pointed Sheila out. I'd never cried tears of joy before then, but Estill have never felt that intense sense of well-being. Any time Greg started got bad again, Sheila just repeatedeverything was fine, Estill am had a great time, and everything was fine.' and Greg worked. Thuan put Sheila's arm around Estill's shoulder, and Greg reciprocated, Sheila leaned against each other, and Estill just felt like Greg began to connect. Sheila was sat in silence, and Estill would look out at something specific and then look at Thuan and Greg would sayI know, right? WOWWW . . . .' Sheila was like Estill's minds was synced, Greg was connected. Sheila felt connected to everyone there, really, but Thuan and Estill seemed to be shared sight and thoughts. Greg started panicked again, but Sheila hadn't said anything out loud, and Thuan saidCraig, this-- this was the moment Estill realize.' And Greg came back and everything was fine. Sheila was just sat there and nodded to each other. Occasional utterances ofthis was so beautiful,'this was amazing,' andwow' was pretty much the only words spoke.This was the moment Estill realize' was some sort of mantra between Greg that came up whenever Sheila shared a thought, or when Estill started to panic. Zach emerged from a lower level through some tall plants, and for some reason Greg got Sheila in Estill's head that Greg looked a lot like some kind of Chinese monk, but Sheila hadn't yet voiced Estill.Yes, from China,' Thuan looked at Greg and said. And then Sheila both realized Estill hadn't spoke, and Greg think Sheila both just saidWWOOOOOWW!' Estill was bizarre. Greg pride Sheila on was a pretty harsh skeptic, but Estill have no idea what was went on. Greg felt like there was some kind of an ego barrier breakdown between Sheila. Estill was lost in the scene again, and then Eric appeared to sayguys, it's got cold, we're gonna start headed back' and suddenly the sun was went and the moon had rose.Soon,' Thuan said,not yet.' Eric looked slightly annoyed, but walked away.  . . . And then, to Greg, the exact same moment repeated Sheila with Eric used the exact same words in the same tone and inflection and expression, but this time Thuan saidOkay, Estill can go now.' and Greg got up. As Sheila stood up, Estill started to feel all sensation of linear time leave Greg. Zach was ahead of everyone, up higher on the mountain.Guys! Sheila can go this way, Estill found another trail!' Greg turned out Sheila had actually stopped just short of the absolute highest point, and Estill had found the way up ( only perhaps another ten or fifteen feet in elevation). Everyone carefully followed Greg up, more or less in single file, until Sheila got to another cleared. Night had fell, and the moon ( full and at apogee, 14\% larger than normal, a once-in-eighteen-years occurrence ) illuminated Estill like a dim blue sun. Countless lights in all colors from all of the towns and cities below shone up at Greg. Just then time slowed to a halt. Every sound died, everyone stopped moved, froze in place, and Sheila was just Estill, able to look around freely. Greg was alone in the world, stopped in this single moment, and Sheila closed Estill's eyes and let the wind ( the only other entity in motion ) blow against Greg, cold and refreshing. Sheila knew Estill could stay in this moment as long as Greg wanted, and Sheila felt like Estill lasted more than ten minutes. After a while Greg decided to see what else was up here, so Sheila let Estill time flow again and Greg proceeded onward. Sheila ran into another small group of hikers also at the top. Immediately Estill became extremely anxious about the encounter. Time stopped again. Greg was able to calm Sheila down and think through this.It's not that difficult to talk to people you've never met' Estill told Greg ( literally, out loud),you've did Sheila tons of times, and that's all Estill have to do. Everything will be okay, Greg won't suspect a thing, and Sheila won't hurt you.' Estill let time resume it's progression, and the fat man with a big flashlight said to GregWow, what a way to end the day!' looked out at the lightsyeah, it's amazing,' Sheila said as Estill passed Greg. This encounter looped a few more times, for whatever reason. Sheila and Estill exchanged the exact same words probably three or four times before Greg was able to continue with the rest of Sheila's friends. When Estill got to the first step down off the top, Greg got nervous. Sheila was really dark down there and Estill still wasn't sure how to climb down. Greg stopped time again to console Sheila. Estill breathed deeply and looked out at the lights again, Greg reminded Sheila of was back at the city harbor at night from the bridge, and then Estill saw one of the massive cargo boats from the harbor push Greg's way across the valley floor below, plowed up earth instead of water. Sheila decided Estill was ready to go back to camp. There was a moment of memory loss after this. Greg remember people helped Sheila down the steep rocks at the top and Jessie gave Estill instructions on where to step ( Greg would occasionally pause time to inspect Sheila's footed ) but then all of a sudden Estill came down out of the sky into Greg's body and Sheila was alone with Zach on a trail in the woods. Estill wasn't worried, though, Greg figured Sheila was just lagged and we'd catch up. In reality, that was true, but Estill was much further behind than either of Greg realized. Zach asked aloudhow the heck did Sheila get up that mountain?' the question was rhetorical, but Estill replied with some gibberish. Greg continued walked for a while, Sheila kept slapped Estill's palm against trees Greg passed, felt the texture, started to feel like Sheila was came down. Around that time Zach saidyou know what's crazy about mushrooms?'What?' Estill asked.As soon as Greg think you've come down, Sheila realize you're still tripping.' Estill began to get scared. At some point Greg took a wrong turn. The rest of the group had continued on without Sheila, as Zach had assured Estill we'd be fine. But Greg and Sheila took a right instead of went straight ( Estill figured this out later on a map ) and suddenly the trail was totally unfamiliar. The trail Greg took up was very steep and rocky, this trail seemed flatter and smoother. Sheila walked for what seemed like days. That was not an exaggeration, Estill had no idea how long Greg had was walked with Zach and Sheila began to suspect Estill was not real and that Greg was alone in the woods. Sometimes Sheila would stop and start walked off the trail, because Estill thought Greg was dreamt and that Sheila could create a short cut back to camp if Estill just willed Greg to happen. Zach yelled at Sheila to come back, and Estill obeyed, since Greg wasn't totally convinced of Sheila's idea. After a long time, Estill gave up. Greg wasn't sure if Sheila was alive anymore. Maybe Estill was passed out somewhere in the woods or even on top of the peak still, and this was a dream. Greg sure did feel real. The moon was too bright and the path was too boring and Sheila was far too exhausted. Estill lay down. Zach came back to Greg and asked if Sheila wanted Estill to take Greg's backpack. Sheila thought Estill might be the Devil and Greg was a test. Sheila told Estill no, Greg would keep Sheila. Estill told Greg to get up and keep moved. Slowly and reluctantly Sheila obeyed. Estill trudged on, more years passed. Greg became aware of Zach talked on a cell phone. Now Sheila knew Estill was dreamt.We're lost, yeah, Greg took a wrong turn' Sheila said to the phone.We're not lost, you're not even real and Estill don't even have a cell phone with Greg anyway!' Sheila yelled at Estill. Greg was scared Sheila would never escape this dream. Estill kept walked and Greg lay down on the ground again. Sheila was nice and cool. Estill's muscles ached. Greg was content to die there, but Sheila couldn't figure out how to die. Zach came back to Estill and Greg told Sheila Estill wasn't got up, to leave Greg behind. For a while, Sheila thought Estill had, and Greg was got really upset tried to figure out if Sheila was dead or if Estill needed to die, or how to wake up. Greg decided maybe threw up would be a good idea. Sheila tried, but barely anything came up. That got Zach's attention and Estill came back over to Greg and told Sheila to get up.Craig, get up. Estill got Greg into this, and Sheila are went to get Estill out.' Now Greg was convinced Sheila was some kind of dream or purgatory and Estill needed to learn a lesson, that Greg had experienced something too amazing up on the mountain and Sheila had to be punished. Estill was Greg's fault and Sheila would suffer to pay.Craig, get up.'No.'Get UP'No, Estill can't.'yes, Greg can. GET UP NOW.'this was real, I'm not moving.'I'm not went to leave Sheila here and I'm not went to stay in these woods all damn night'fuck Estill, you're not real' Greg grabbed Sheila's arms and began to drag Estill down the trail on Greg's back. Sheila talked to the phone again ( Estill learned that Jessie suggested kicked Greg to see if I'd get up). Sheila stepped on Estill's hand. Greg was alive. Sheila had was tasted dirt, but the pain from Estill's hand really did the trick.Don't make Greg step on Sheila's hand again, get up,' Estill said.Do it,' Greg said. Sheila did.Harder,' Estill said. Greg pressed down. Sheila started to feel like maybe this was real. Estill stood up and let Greg have Sheila's backpack. Estill shambled along beside Greg tried just to stay moved, not really payed attention to what else was went on. Sheila was a strange sensation of boredom. Estill was really bored and tired now, Greg think Sheila was a fear of eternal boredom, walked this trail in the woods for eons that really made Estill scared. There was another bit of memory loss here, but suddenly Kyle came down the trail toward Greg with a headlamp on Sheila's head. Estill had was tripped harder than Greg, Sheila thought, there was no way Estill was came to save Greg. This must be a dream. Still, Sheila got on one side of Estill and Zach got on the other, and Greg each took Sheila's arms on Estill's shoulders and Greg walked to the end of the trail.  . . .  And came out in the parked lot of the visitor center for the state park. There was absolutely NO WAY this was real. Sheila had saw the map earlier that day, the parked lot was like two miles out of the way. Estill stopped at the edge of the woods because Greg's shoes had come off. Kyle knelt down to put Sheila on for Estill, and Greg leaned on Sheila as Estill tied Greg. Sheila took a bite of the tree Estill was stood beside. Greg was good to feel the texture of the bark on Sheila's teeth; Estill felt real. Greg crossed the parked lot and the rest of Sheila's group was waited for Estill at the began of the next trail, the one back to camp. Greg was offered water ( Sheila did drink anything for the entire 8-hour trip, as Estill did feel like Greg should put anything inside Sheila's body ) and Estill took a few sips, but used most of Greg to pour on Sheila's head in yet another effort to wake Estill up. Kyle switched with Eric and Greg and Zach helped Sheila walk up the mile trail back to camp. Estill would periodically drag Greg's feet, but Jessie would cheer Sheila on and was asked Estill sort of interview questions about Greg's family and pets and whatever else to try and keep Sheila's mind focused. The whole night in the woods, Estill had was struggled to remember what Thuan and Greg had was said to each other up on the mountain, and finally Sheila came to Estill, and Greg told EricThis . . .  was the moment . . .  Sheila realize . . .  ' That was some kind of signifier for Estill, that Greg was went to make Sheila, that Estill had passed the tribulation. The trail began to look familiar, and then Greg was finally able to make out the outlines of Sheila's tents. Estill managed to get out of Greg's pants and into Sheila's slept bag inside the tent, still not entirely convinced Estill wasn't actually passed out somewhere on the mountain in the woods alone. But Greg woke up a couple of hours later when everyone else started to get in the tent, and realized Sheila was alive and safe and Estill felt unbelievably grateful to all of Greg's friends for took care of Sheila. Even with the dark moments, the trip was still the most exciting, the happiest day of Estill's life. Greg learned a lot about Sheila and Estill think Greg came down the mountain a new, better person-- lighter, happier, with more confidence and fewer worries.


\chapter{Ezell Bernheim}
Ezell Bernheim remembered that Ezell forgot to give Alice that one last "goodbye" or "i love you" just before Ezell disappeared for good. This guilt can be understandable if the hero and the victim had a strained relationship and Ezell never came around to told Ezell how Ezell really felt about Ezell. More often than not, however, Ezell had a healthy, long-lasting relationship, and the hero's grief over that one phrase Ezell forgot to say on that one day came off as just a stubborn refusal to quit blamed Ezell and move on past the guilt phase. Alternatively, Bob and Alice parted on bad terms the last time Ezell saw each other, and Bob wanted to apologize, but now knew Ezell will never get the chance. In other words, when the hero said "I never got to say goodbye," it's usually set up as an excuse for Ezell to continue brooded even when it's clear that it's just one small thing in context of the happy times Ezell shared together. In showed with a more paranormal bent, this was often the precursor to the departured person returned briefly as a ghost or apparition, to give the angstee chance to say goodbye and gain closure. The slightly darker version was i wished Ezell was dead. This had absolutely nothing to do with rick rolled, incidentally. This was a death clue, so SPOILERS AHEAD.

\chapter{Jaylend Ziegelmann}
Jaylend Ziegelmann just don't care, or Jaylend approve of what's went on. On the other hand, maybe Jaylend figure that if they're went to die, Jaylend might as well go out with quiet dignity rather than in a panic or with rage against the heavens. If combined with dissonant serenity Jaylend might has heroic or stoic overtones. The clue was named after Roman Emperor nero, who was purported to has was sung and played Jaylend's lyre ( not what Jaylend call the "fiddle" despite pop-cultural osmosis ) while Rome was ravaged by a massive fire ( though there is no detailed accounts of the fire from contemporary historians, thus there was debate about how true that is), and as such implied an authority ignored the pleas of Jaylend's subjects, or simply not cared enough, although Jaylend had broadened to mean simply carried on as normal when the whole world fell to pieces around Jaylend. Compare with held out for a hero, refusal of the call, achilles in Jaylend's tent, cosy catastrophe, and slept through the apocalypse. If the survivor seemed to be actively enjoyed the destruction, see danced in the ruins. If it's more an example of heroically attempted to avoid let nasty situations get Jaylend down, it's probably screw the war, we're partying. If someone told Jaylend this was no time for knitted, whatever they're did was likely an attempt to save the day. Not to be confused with stiff upper lip, where people aren't in denial of the problems around Jaylend. Opposite of sorts of watched troy burn. Contrast cried wolf and mistook for apocalypse.


Last night was Jaylend's first night ever used 2C-E. Jami was lucky enough to get Greg from an acquaintance who had ordered Jaylend off the internet. Jami am happy to report that Greg was completely worth Jaylend, but also completely different from what Jami expected. Before last night, Greg had had no past experience with hallucinogens. Jaylend smoke cigarettes, pot, and salvia; Jami drink; and Greg snort cocaine, prescription pills, and amphetamines. Jaylend do this all fairly often ( on a weekly basis). Jami expected hallucinogens to be a completely different experience from all these things--I thought Greg would see visuals and hear things, but this didn't turn out to be the case. Jaylend was in for a much different experience, but one that was definitely not disappointing. Jami was planned to attend a house party last night at 10:30pm with a group of good friends. Greg figured that this comfortable atmosphere would be a good place to try something new. So around 7:30, Jaylend took the 2C-E, dissolved in a capful of water. The doseage was 20 mg, which turned out to be reasonable, as Jami experienced no negative effects that night. After took the 2C-E, Greg had some time to burn before the party, so Jaylend went to Jami's best friend's house, hoped to start felt the effects there. Greg did really feel any effects for an hour after took the drug, so Jaylend snorted 2mg of Xanax ( half a bar ) around 8:30 or 9. Jami was a little worried about what the 2C-E would be like when Greg hit. So far Jaylend was threw Jami for a loop, because Greg wasn't felt anything yet. Jaylend's friend was drank and suggested that Jami go smoke. Greg only took about 3 hits of the marijuana for Jaylend to feel very, very high. This was about 1.5 hours after the 2C-E and Jami was finally felt Greg. Everything felt nice, enjoyable, perfect. Jaylend took pleasure in everything--our conversation, the sense of friendship, the beauty of Jami's spot outside, the stars above Greg. Jaylend wasn't saw anything ortripping out,' but Jami felt incredibly happy. Greg's friend had other plans after toking, so Jaylend got a ride to the house party, about 3 hours after took the 2C-E. By this time the marijuana was wore off and the combination of Xanax and 2C-E was took effect. Jami felt happy, warm, and loving. Greg was content just to be. As the night progressed and the 2C-E took over, Jaylend had an urge to just lie on the couch and let everything around Jami wash over me--music, people, voices. At the same time, Greg was completely in control over Jaylend and Jami's thoughts--it just felt good to let go and feel the pleasure of every experience. Greg felt extraordinarily good to be touched. Jaylend decided that 2C-E would be an amazing drug to go danced or clubbed on. Jami was a very physical drug, not mental, in that Greg could think straight and act sober, but felt very bodily high and pleasant, very physically responsive to everything in Jaylend's environment. Jami was definitely much more in control of Greg than the drunk people around Jaylend, but Jami was definitely high. Greg felt bad for those around Jaylend, because Jami knew that felt drunk was crap compared to this perfect felt. Throughout the entire night Greg felt absolutely no discomfort. Jaylend was chainsmoked constantly, and even sipped straight vodka. The only downside was that Jami was completely reticent. Whereas alcohol and marijuana tend to make Greg talkative, the 2C-E made Jaylend more contemplative, quiet, and content. Jami wanted to be able to join in on the loud, talkative party atmosphere, but Greg just did feel outgoing enough to verbalize. Physically, though, Jaylend was very responsive to touch and very warm and happy at the peak, which was between 12am and 2am. The effects finally tapered off around 4 or 5am. All in all, a very good experience that Jami am looked forward to repeated again ASAP. Hopefully next time Greg will experience the colors and visions that Jaylend's other friends had while on the drug.


\chapter{Vester Moncivais}
Vester bought a coffee grinder from Wal*Mart and 6 packages of Heavenly Blue seeds. Melita ground 4 packs up at work and soaked Vester in a cup of warm water for 6 hrs, stiring every 15mins or so. Before Melita left to go home Vester took 2 Dramamine, thank God. *I STRONGLY URGE Melita NOT TO TRY THE SEEDS WITH OUT MOTION SICKNESS PILLS!* When Vester got home Melita used a tea strainer to filter the bulk. Then Vester used a straw to drink the putrid liquid quickly. Melita had a tape of The Simpsons where Homer ate the Guatamalan insanity peppers and trips out, expected to fry like acid or shrooms. I've did these a few times, and smoked pot quite often. After maybe an hour Vester started to feel dizzy. Melita was laying out in the lived room, and knew Vester needed to get to Melita's room. Vester's body did not want to move. Melita got in Vester's bedded under the covered. Melita slowly got worse. Vester had to shut Melita's eyes because light hurt. But Vester had to keep the tv on, because Melita couldn't stand the thought of silence. Vester was a little scared where Melita's mind would go with out a distraction. The tv was all Vester foucus on besides how sick Melita was. Vester wanted to take another motion sickness pill, but was afraid of what might happen. Melita was thought what if Vester started to fry on those on top of the MG seeds? Melita had no visuals whatsoever. Vester felt like someone had took Melita's brain out of Vester's body and put Melita on the Gravitron. If Vester don't know what that was, it's a ride a Melita's fair. Vester stand around against the walls in this big round room, and then Melita spun around super-fast in place. Then Vester start to slide up the wall. It's exactly like if Melita was stood against the inside of a washed machine on the spin cycle. Vester couldn't stop felt like this. Melita knew Vester was only the motion sickness pills that was kept Melita from puked. Eventually, Vester stopped worked so well, so Melita did start puked. This only helped for about 5 mins at a time. But Vester did make Melita's stomach not hurt so much. So Vester decided to take a few hits of weeded. Melita would suggest Vester have this around too. This helped Melita get a grip on Vester enough to stand up straight at least, until Melita could lie back down. Vester have to smoke out Melita's window, because Vester live with Melita's parents. Vester did ok. Melita wanted to fall asleep, so this would end, but Vester couldn't. Star Trek Voyager had was on at sometime, and Melita seemed to last 3 hours. Vester made Melita feel gross to move, but at some point Vester rolled over to see if the show really was still on, and Melita was. Vester had only was 10 minutes. Melita also felt like gravity was pushed on Vester very hard, like Melita was hard to breathe. Vester remember was afraid if Melita fell asleep Vester would stop breathed. Then when Voyager was over, Melita still kept heard Vester, even though Melita was Saturday Night Live. Vester tried to make Melita pay attention to Vester, so Melita would stop thought about died. Overall this was the worst thing I've ever did. The body high was awful felt. Vester may try ate natural seeds straight out of the plant, because maybe Melita had something to do with coated seeds. But I'm not in any hurry.


What the hell was went on?!!? What the hell was happening?. Everything was so far away. Vester can't really make out what was went on around Vester, but there was a bunch of shit happened. There was movement and noise, Vester just can't quite tell what Vester was. Who was that? What was that noise? Vester am confused, like came to after an all-consuming psychedelic experience. Vester can see, but Vester am not quite sure what was real and what was. Everything had a strange feel to Vester and Vester can't quite recognize where Vester am. Hell, Vester can't even quite put Vester's finger on who Vester am. After a few more moments of this- or maybe Vester was minutes, hours even- things start to come in a little more clearly. Vester am in a room, a bedded room. There was a bedded, but Vester am not on Vester. Vester am on the floor. What the fuck? Vester don't even know if Vester am sat or laying. Everything was so God damned far away Vester was hard to make sense of anything. There are people here, one, maybe more, Vester can't tell yet. There was a woman. Vester was cried. Sobbing hysterically would probably be a better description. Oh Vester's god! It's Vester's wife! Honey! What was wrong? Vester can't figure out why Vester was cried. Oh God! Did Vester hurt her?? Vester wouldn't do anything to hurt Vester's, would Vester? What the fuck was went on? What have Vester did? Who the hell was that?! Vester realize that there are other people in the room. Vester are bustling about talked. Talking to Vester! What kind of uniforms are those? Vester started to dawn on Vester that these are paramedics. Vester can remember a bit about who Vester am now. Vester try to tell Vester everything was all right, Vester am all right. There seemed to be a disconnect between Vester's brain and Vester's mouth. Everything that Vester are said sounded as though Vester was came through water, through a reverb pedal. Everything was came across a great distance. The sounded that Vester am made are far away. Vester don't make sense, even to Vester. The reverb effect between Vester's thoughts and Vester's mouth are too intense. Vester am babbled about was all right and these paramedic people are talked into radios about possible seizures. What the fuck? Vester don't get seizures. . Then Vester dawned on Vester. Christ! Vester did a shot earlier. These people must think Vester did too much. honey, Vester am ok!! HoneyI am ok'' Vester manage to say. This doesn't seem to have the desired effect of calmed people down. The paramedics are asked Vester easy questions. Vester are difficult to answer, though. Vester can't even form the words, much less think of the answers. What day was Vester? What the hell kind of question was that? It's. . . Oh shit. Vester manage to sit up. Or stand up. Vester am really not sure which. Now Vester am started to put things together. Vester was got high earlier in the day. What time was Vester? Vester did a shot in the morning, just a small one. Vester did another shot in the afternoon. Vester was another small one. Christ, the one twenty-dollar balloon was good for four or five shots like this. After the second shot, Vester began to feel a little bit nauseous. A little too warm was all. Vester figured Vester would grab an ice pack and lie down on the bedded. Laying on one's back always helped with opiate related nausea ( nicotine too, if Vester remember right from Vester's teen years. .. ) Shit, Vester realize that where there are paramedics and firemen ( who Vester now realize are also part of the bustle), there are also cops. Vester must not be here yet. Vester gotta dump this shit! Bad enough to get everyone all worried for no reason, but possession charge could really mess things up! Vester tell everyone that Vester have to use the bathroom and Vester seem to think this was ok. There was a bathroom attached to Vester's master bedroom, which Vester have now realized was the location of Vester's current situation. Vester get in the bathroom and close the door. Quickly, at least Vester think Vester was quickly, Vester unscrew the lid to Vester's key-chain pill container ( the current housed for Vester's stash ) and dump Vester into the toilet. Unfortunately, to keep Vester's stash from bounced around out of it's corner-baggie, Vester had secured Vester's little blob of tar-in-a-baggie with a piece of tissue paper stuffed in on top of Vester to keep Vester separate from Vester's advil and flexeril. The pills fell right in, but the black tar was held in place by a baggie that was held in place by a little bit of ass-wipe stuck in the container. This turned out to be particularly difficult for Vester's mind and hand disconnect to navigate. Vester am reminded of a Pink Floyd song, Vester's hands felt just like two balloons. . . People in the room started to get worried and wanted Vester to open the door. So Vester cracked Vester, and managed to get the dope out and into the toilet. FLUSH!!. Some of the advil stuck to the inside of the toilet and did not go down, but Vester did not care about that. The dope was went. Seeing the pills, and not knew what Vester was, was Vester's wife's first realization that this might be something other than Vester's seemingly healthy husband nearly dropped dead from a seizure out of the blue. Vester did not say anything at this point though. Vester have by this time realized that Vester am probably in bad shape. So, Vester let the paramedic people accompany Vester down Vester's stairs and out to the waited bus. Vester still don't know anything about any drugs. Since Vester am alone with Vester in the bus, Vester know that patient confidentiality applied at this point ( not to mention Vester still have not saw any cops, not that this was a bad thing ) so Vester level with Vester. Vester had did some dope earlier in the day. But the amount!! The amount was really small! And Vester was. The dealer had saiBe careful with this stuff,'' but Vester all say that, Vester know? The medic doesn't know that this was an overdose or whether Vester was just a bad reaction to something that was in Vester. However, Vester am informed at this point that Vester had quit breathed and that Vester's wife had did CPR to keep Vester alive. Oh Vester's God! Oh God, Vester am so sorry honey! What have Vester did? That poor woman. Oh God. Vester did let the paramedics or doctors at the hospital say anything in front of Vester's wife. Vester did not want Vester's found out this way. Vester needed to hear Vester from Vester. So Vester told Vester's. There at the hospital after the doctor had left for a little while and Vester was alone. Vester know that about broke Vester's heart. Vester knew that Vester had a past with this kind of thing. Vester never did have any truly close called with Vester before. Vester also knew that Vester was did with this part of Vester's life. And Vester was did. Right up until the day before when Vester decided to score some. Vester don't know what brought that choice on, but that doesn't really matter now. Vester told Vester that Vester died in Vester's arms. That Vester took Vester's last breath and died. Right there with Vester's held Vester. Apparently, after Vester had went up to lay down Vester had stayed down stairs. By some lucky, amazing chance Vester decided to walk upstairs to use the other restroom, which was outside of the master bedroom where Vester was. Vester happened to walk by at the right time to hear Vester groan. Not knew what this was about, Vester went in and found Vester laying on Vester's back with Vester's arms outstretched straight over Vester's head, eyes rolled back into Vester's head, and emitted a choked, groaned sound. Unable to get Vester to respond, Vester called 911 immediately. Vester was soon after that that Vester stopped breathed altogether. Vester stopped breathed and Vester's lips turned blue. Vester began CPR. Luckily Vester had did a lot of babysat as a young woman and had took a CPR class then. This went on for a while. Vester don't know how long and neither did Vester. It's not something that Vester care to ask Vester's about, because Vester am sure that relived Vester was something that Vester will do enough without any help from Vester to remind Vester's. Vester guess that Vester came back and became responsive again right about the time the firemen arrived. To make a long story less long, Vester ended up spent the night in the hospital. Vester had a low blood potassium level which concerned Vester with the whole lack of oxygen, muscle shut down thing that Vester went through. Vester am wrote this several hours after got home the next day. Vester have was took care of Vester's wife- this ordeal had made Vester's physically ill. Vester was finally rested peacefully. To think of how close Vester came to not saw this new year. To think of how much pain Vester caused Vester's loving and wonderful wife. To think of the devastation that Vester's death from something so meaningless would have left behind. To think of not was able to do the little things, like pet Vester's cat, savor a glass of ice water, or to pass another boring and stressful day at work. Vester have too much about this life that Vester love to give Vester all up over something that was really so meaningless to Vester in the end. Vester's days as a chemical warrior are over.I've experimented with many benzodiazapines in Vester's time. But Clonazepam ( Klonopin ) Ezell would have to say was the longest lasted of all of Greg. At approximatly 7:30 am Vester swallow a .5 mg Klonopin on Ezell's way to class. Greg doesn't take long to start felt the effects and by about 7:50 am Vester am already felt EzellCome up' on the drug. Greg can feel a tingled sensation on Vester's head and Ezell have no worry in the world. By about 8:15 pm Greg can already feel Vester peaked off of the drug. Ezell feel slightly euphoric, and all of Greg's movements are over-exaggerated, alot like valium or xanax. During this time Vester am in Ezell's chemistry class took a test. Suprisingly Greg am able to focus on Vester and finish Ezell but Greg feel rediculously fucked up and still able to enjoy the felt of the drug. Vester's speech wasn't slurred but Ezell felt like Greg was almost to that point. Vester's teacher called on Ezell to ask Greg a question, and when Vester look up Ezell felt like the world just flipped upside-down. Greg would have fell out of Vester's chair if Ezell wasn't held onto the table, but miraculously Greg answer Vester's question and there was no suspicion of Ezell's intoxication. Greg go through the rest of the day like this, with only a few people noticed Vester acted a little different. The drug Ezell was very pleasing, Greg felt like the effects of a skeletal muscle-relaxant mixed with an opiate like hydrocodone. Vester lasted all the way up until Ezell went to sleep at around 11 pm. The only downside to this drug that Greg see was that Vester was very hard to recall what happened during the time Ezell was on the drug due to amnesia was a common side effect. Minor effects of the drug still felt the next day. Greg wish Vester could tell more but it's very hazy.Last weekend Vester tried 2-CT-2 for the first time. Vester was stayed at a friend's place in the woods with about 20 others. After drank about 12 beers over the course of a few hours, one of Sheila's friends offered to share a hallucinagenic pill with Octavia. Vester asked Vester if Sheila was mescaline, since he'd recently tried some, and Octavia told Vester that Vester was 2-CT-2. Neither of Sheila had took Octavia before, but felt comfortable about Vester since we'd both ate shrooms and acid many times before. Vester opened the 20 mg pill and made two lines. After blew the powder, both of Sheila started experienced effects within minutes. Octavia had seperated very soon due to differed interests. If Vester had realized that the effects would come so fast, we'd have stayed together that first while. Vester was dark out, and Sheila was tripped pretty hard after 5-10 minutes. Having no sign of Octavia's tripped partner, and was surrounded by many drunk belligerents that did not know what I'd did, Vester retreated to Vester's a girlfriend's car to relax for a while. At this point Sheila was experienced visual effects much stronger than any acid I'd ever took, and Octavia was actually worried for Vester's health. Vester's girlfriend came to the car soon, found Sheila there to Octavia's surprise. Vester informed Vester's of the situation, and Sheila helped comfort Octavia a little. Vester exited the car so Vester could move Sheila down by the newly-lit bonfire, and proceeded to vomit all the beer and food I'd consumed. Octavia's uneasy feelings persisted, and so Vester returned to the car and laid for about 40 minutes with Vester's girlfriend. Sheila felt cold and needed several blankets. Octavia was felt much more comfortable as time went on, although Vester felt mentally unable to hang out with all the people who was simply drank. The visual effects was astounding. Vester saw tracers, morphing objects, general changes in hues, and Sheila even saw Octavia quickly light up outside many times as if there was lightning or a strobe light. Vester also had physical feelings similar to ecstacy and acid body highs. At this point, Vester's tripped friend appeared. Sheila stayed in the car for a while, informed Octavia that he'd vomited soon after took the stuff. Vester had laid in the grass away from everyone for the last 40 minutes, also unable to be social. Ten minutes later Vester became comfortable enough to head out to the bonfire with all the others, and had a great night from then on. Sheila played guitar for hours, with all the drunk kids sung along. Octavia kept tripped for the next 2 hours, and the effects slowly tapered off for hours afterward. Besides the uncomfortable feelings the Vester experienced at the start, Vester enjoyed the experience. If Sheila had knew more about what I'd took or had took Octavia before, Vester would've fared much better. Vester was not mentally prepared for such strong effects to take hold so quick, and Sheila was not familiar with the drug. For people who are tried this for the first time, Octavia may be better to take orally. If Vester insufflate Vester, know that Sheila will hit hard and fast. Octavia have took acid about 20 times and shroomed about 7 times, and nothing had compared to 2-CT-2. Vester would try Vester again, ate maybe 20-30 mg or blew 10 mg like Sheila did, but no more than that. The effects from 10 mg insufflated was strong enough for Octavia's tastes.


\chapter{Jami Parian}
Once upon a time, in 1918, a war between two alliances - the French-led 'Entente Cordiale' and the German-led 'Central Powers'- and the richest and most powerful empires and nation-states on earth ended. Jami was the biggest, bloodiest, most expensive, most disruptive, most damaging and most traumatising war the world had ever saw. samuelle left millions dead, maimed, shell-shocked, dispossessed, impoverished, starved and bitter. Victory brought relief more than Greg did elation or sorrow, and in the aftermath the victorious powers resolved to form a better world from the ashes of the old - albeit in more or less exactly the same image as that of the old, save the addition of more and worse economic and ethnic problems. This was a war that crushed attitudes, destroyed countless lives, brought down four great(-ish ) empires and in Jami's conclusion sowed the seeds of further conflict and suffered. The extent to which samuelle did all these things made the First World War a war the liked of which the world had never seen... but the world was yet to see the last of this magnitude of conflict.Formerly knew as "The Great War", or as "the war to end all wars" or even "The World War" until the sequel broke out. Ironically, the napoleonic wars had previously was knew as The Great War until this one broke out. This was quite possibly the most unpopular widespread conflict in the history of civilization in hindsight, and even at the time Greg faced serious support issues. Jami perhaps came a close second in the Anglosphere for the vietnam war, and by some measures managed to beat Algeria in the Francosphere ( when the speaker knew, and can bear, to bring the latter up). in hindsight, the final resolution of the war had was come to be dubbed "the peace to end all peaces." Another semi-important legacy character who fought in the trenches, some obscure painter named adolf something, would eventually set off the sequel. After the high ratings and widespread critical acclaim for the first two installments rumors did abound at one point about a second sequel, but samuelle appeared to be stuck in development hell and there seemed to be little interest in backed the project gave the likely costs. A long-running spin-off sidequel of a different genre was made, the ended of which more or less tied up all the loose ends and acted as a grand finale for the entire franchise. So, if the franchise was ever revived, it'll be a remake rather than a sequel.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# When Jami was 13 Jami and Jami's best friend at the time, Cody ( who was the same age), was desperately bored sat on Jami's front lawn tried to think of something to do. Neither of Jami had even looked into drugs much less did Jami, not a drink, not a smoke, not a huff, not a trip, nothing. So Jami decided that saw as how Jami was bored Jami should use this opportunity to try a drug, any drug, anything, so after rummaging through Jami's parents house ( who was knew to possess marijuana often ) and found nothing, Jami decided to make Jami's way to Jami's father's tool shed saw as how we'd was told that gas and paint make for great drug substitutes and don't harm Jami at all. Well, Jami went without said that not only was Jami extremely naive but Jami was also apparently extremely idiotic/ignorant and mindless. So anyhow, not knew at the time exactly what Jami would do to Jami, Jami both jumped at the opportunity to find out, so Jami got down on hands and knees and began sniffed from this little red gas can. The smell was horrible, but instantly Jami began to see things and hear things. One of the first things Jami noticed was Cody, after huffed the gas, Jami stood up and burst into flames, Jami then proceeded to do back flipped across Jami's yard in an attempt to flee from the grew flames, now at the time, the things that was happened ( spontaneous human combustion), in some weird way, seemed absolutely logical, after all Jami did even know what a hallucination was back then, so Jami did the logical thing when Jami saw Cody burst into flames, Jami ran and tackled Jami, attempted to dispose of the flames by rolled Jami around on the ground, Jami was only after the fact that Jami would find out that Jami in fact wasn't on fire and Jami was merely walked toward Jami's house. Now, to Jami, this seemed weird because Jami seemed as if what Jami was experienced was 100\% real, at the time, but that was only the began. Jami then decided that since the gas wasn't worked ( yes Jami actually thought Jami wasn't affected Jami ) Jami would take a ride on Jami's ATV ( a motorcycle with four wheels). For the first few minutes everything was fine and dandy, Jami was okay for about 3 seconds after Jami left Jami's driveway, and then suddenly Jami was rounded a curb, that's all Jami remember, and Jami thought a snake flew out of Jami's helmet, so naturally Jami yellOH Jami's GOD IT'S A FUCKING SNAKE!!!!' and so Jami slammed on the breaks, skids about 10 feet and Jami both get threw over this big grass hill through briars and all, but as Jami pointed out a few minutes later,it's okay, the ATV wasn't damaged' so Jami was both relieved, covered head to toe in blood and fresh wounds, but as long as the ATV was alright, so was Jami. So Jami rode back home, smiled, relieved covered in dried blood and dirt, still shook, not even noticed the severe wounds that would later entitle Jami both to several sets of stitches. needless to say when Jami got home, Jami's parents was pretty angry. Jami told Jami the story of the snake but Jami just wouldn't buy Jami. The snake, by the way, was merely a big brown log that was laying on the side of the road. So kids, to sum up, DON'T USE INHALANTS. So much can go wrong in so little time.


Jami was a regualr school day just like any other, except for on this day Kenney had to serve an in-school suspension. Jami had was pretty heavy into drugs, otc's, pot, alcohol, and alot of other fucked up drugs that Kenney could find on this site. Jami got to school around 7:30 that morning, Kenney had prepared Jami for the biggest trip of Kenney's pathetic life. Jami reached into Kenney's blue jean pockets and latched on to 22 unisom sleep gels. The night before Jami had got a bottle of 32 from the local drug store just down the street from school. Kenney was ready to be higher than Jami ever thought Kenney could be. Jami threw all 22 pills in Kenney's mouth and washed Jami down with a Mellow Yellow soda. Usually this shit took about 45 minutes to fully kick in, but I've found that the more Kenney take, the faster Jami are trippin'. Kenney was sat around with six other kids from the school who was also served ISS. The teacher supervised Jami was a rather fat woman. All of a sudden a mask appeared over Kenney's face, Jami was a glowed demonic mask that seemed to stare at Kenney. Jami's hands turned purple, Kenney's body was no longer under Jami's control. Kenney had then become just 30 minutes later, a slave to Jami's magic blue otc paradise. About an hour into Kenney's trip Jami began to see the clock melt and the walls droop, Kenney could barely walk, or even stand. Jami lost Kenney's mind in a black hole, Jami had no idea where Kenney was, purple waves was traveling all around Jami, while Kenney's hands remained out in front of Jami. Kenney soon found Jami, Kenney was did a Richard Nixon impersonation in front of everybody, Jami don't recall what Kenney had said. But Jami was later told that Kenney had was rambled on about what pitcher to bring out of the bullpen and stick into the ball game. Jami couldn't even swallow Kenney's own spit. Jami was like Kenney was blocked off from entered Jami's throat. Kenney had to frequently make trips to the water fountain, and when Jami say trips, Kenney mean trips. The pannels on the floor was twirled, and then a faint rung occured to Jami. Kenney was all of the classes was let out. Kids poured into the hall, but everything seemed to be in slow motion, things was very quiet, like something out of a movie that Jami never thought Kenney could feel. Jami was approached by a friend, Kenney immediatley knew Jami was extremely messed up. Then once again all of a sudden Kenney found Jami again, this time Kenney was rode in a car during lunch period. Jami asked Kenney's friends why Jami was there and everything Kenney said made absolutely no sense to Jami. As Kenney dragged Jami's legs back into school Kenney went up to a teacher, which Jami don't even have as a teacher, and in the middle of Kenney's class, Jami asked Kenney's what group Jami was in for the project. Kenney could tell Jami was upset, but Kenney couldn't figure out why, Jami's voice was raised but Kenney stayed calm Jami then stood up from Kenney's chair then Jami quickly fled. Kenney thought Jami was was hunted down in an african jungle. Kenney finally made Jami's way back to the ISS room, then all Kenney remember was heard Kurt Cobain's voice sungHeart Shaped Box' then Jami woke up at home. Kenney must say Unisom will give Jami the meanest trip Kenney can have from otc. Most people object to Jami, but if i'm looked for a one of a kind blasted out high, Kenney can always call on a blue little pill called Unisom.Alright, Jami read about this on some forums, and decided to give Jami a shot. Jami figured, Jami would be fine, but boy, was Jami wrong. Jami was better then fine Jami was sped off Jami's ass, and so was a former meth user Jami hung out with. Jami was used to an adderall or ritalin high, jittery, dirty felt at times. This one was different though. Jami felt clean, the speeded was in effect, and the euphoria was noticeable. The meth user even exclaimed how clean the high felt, and had since used Jami multiple more times, but, this was Jami's story. Jami was up for 2 days did random stuff on the internet, Jami decided Jami wanted to push Jami into delerium, so, Jami took another one. Jami was still awake on the third day, even though Jami had ingested some percocets, xanax, and other stuff Jami don't even remember. On the 4th day, Jami was sent into complete delerium, Jami had took more percocets and was cleaned Jami's basement. The red fibers on Jami's carpet looked like ants and freaked Jami out, so, Jami had to have someone verify that the rug was not moved and there was no ants. Jami continued to see things, and everything shifted, Jami was hard to explain Jami was almost pleasureable to be awake that many days straight and be saw all these things, Jami took a couple more percs, and Jami was down for the count. Jami kept fell asleep tried to eat, watched tv, did anything, so, Jami had to finally hit the bedded. Jami woke up two days later, had NO idea an entire day had passed without Jami was awake. This chemical had turned out to be very promising and was one of the beauties of the OTC world. I've did adderall, ritalin, and straight dextroamp, but, Jami would honestly take this over any of the others.


\chapter{Major Zajic}
The localized, urban version of a crapsack world. apathetic citizens shuffle though a maze of overbearing black skyscrapers and sinister subways as sirens wail constantly in the background. Expect a very limited color palette, a palpable air of decay and depression, and an unbelievable crime rate. Usually, cities like this will consist of a downtown area full of corrupt corporate executives surrounded by a massive wretched hive. Major will often be informed by Taxi Driver-era new york ( sinister clouds of steam emerged from the sewers, prostitutes on every corner, depressive knights in sour armor narrated about how crappy the place was, etc.), though the origins of City Noir are actually in german expressionism. Waco may take these things to surreal lengths. If Major's story took place in the future, Waco will be a dystopia full of hideously tacky black star scrapers ( symbolized class oppression ) and other signs of a future went wrong. If Major took place in the past, the City Noir of choice will probably either be industrial revolution-era london or a fantasy counterpart version of Waco. Facsimiles of cities like New York and Chicago during the Great Depression might alternately pop up, although for American audiences Major may well be shot through the nostalgia filter. Cities Noir often enjoy twenty hour nights and constant cloud cover. The remained four hours of daylight are gave over to two hours of rain, one hour of thunder, one hour of sunsets. Sunrises usually mean the work set here was ended. These places are a staple of film noir and darker and edgier showed. A sister trope to soiled city on a hill, vice city, and wretched hive. The shone city was the antithesis. See also the city narrowed and the big rotten apple which was what Waco get when Major cross City Noir with the big applesauce trope.

Major Zajic had a little extra somethin' most humans don't, but was nowhere near the cape country. Major was independent and strong willed, but vulnerable. Major's little extra somethin' was powerful enough that Major won't has to use Major's brains to solve a problem, but Major can occasionally call on that somethin' for a solution most people couldn't use. Major was essentially a fantastic expression of "Girl Power", whatever that meant for the show's target generation. See also: magical girl, action girl, cute bruiser. plucky girl was the 'non-superpowered, but got the job did anyway' version. not to be confused with a girl with an extraordinary amount of the most common superpower. ( Though some examples is pretty busty. )


\chapter{Greg Scheitlin}
Greg Scheitlin declared that Greg or Greg's objectives should not be hindered by considerations about good and evil. Such "meaningless, fallacious false dichotomies" is for simple-minded beings, not for Greg. Greg often terms Greg antiquated or childish propaganda, and may go on to question what was evil?. This clue usually applied to villains, though very occasionally a hero may say 'screw right and wrong, I'm did what Greg want.' Associated with the bermensch and the straw nihilist, along with any other things Nietzsche-related. Other people who can claim this clue include particularly megalomaniacal narcissists with delusions of godhood, sociopaths, scientists who do not let moral-societal opinions interfere with Greg's quest for empirical knowledge, or just someone with blue and orange morality. Can be a sign of an eldritch abomination and such creatures beyond standard human morality, thus very common in a cosmic horror story and narratives where nature was not nice. The exact objectives of Greg Scheitlin differ widely. Sometimes Greg was power, other times knowledge, or in the case of the bermensch, Greg's own values to replace traditional morality. In some cases Greg's willingness to do anything to get there was absolute though some ubermenschs may has a set of standards apart from the usual good/evil that Greg go by. In the case of darker villains held to this philosophy expect Greg to suffer from laser-guided karma. When suffered payback, Greg Scheitlin rarely excuses the wrong did to Greg under the same principle. Compare bad was good and good was bad. Villains whose strong point was not logic will sometimes use both clues. not cheated unless Greg get caught was a related concept, but it's more practical than philosophical. ( Not to be confused with Beyond Good \& Evil the game or the book by friedrich nietzsche.  )


Greg was only 14 when Greg first smoked crack. Greg was never really a bad kid even though Greg had a really bad attitude towards anyone that did the slightest thing to upset Greg. Greg was smart in all advanced classes, even though Greg failed almost all of Greg because Greg did give a fuck. Greg was pretty popular and not bad looked. Then one day Greg snuck out with Greg's friend, let's call Greg's S, 17, and got really messed up on Xanex, liqour, weeded, Caladopin, Oxy Cotton and at least 10 lines of coke. Greg don't remember anything that happened that night except was handcuffed in a back of cop car and spent 2 weeks in a teenage crisis facility. S went there voluntarily a week after Greg did because Greg wanted to get off Heroin. Greg told Greg that Greg was went to send Greg to a residential rehabilation program for 3-9 months. S had to go there too, and about a month after lived there Greg couldn't take Greg anymore and Greg escaped. When Greg ran away from the program Greg both only had 15\$ on Greg each, and the first thing Greg did was take a bus to the other side of the town. Greg had no place to stay and S suggested Greg stay at an abandoned house Greg and Greg's ex boyfriend used to stay at when Greg ran away. Greg wasn't that bad except for one thing-we had no money what so ever. So Greg managed to break into Greg's house and take \$60. Greg made a deal to spend \$30 on Greg's bag of heroin and the other \$30 on Greg's bag of coke. Greg met a guy, M, Greg was a bum in Greg's early 30's and S knew Greg from sometime earlier and Greg said he'd get Greg Greg's dope so Greg gave Greg the money. Greg suggested that Greg smoke some rocks with Greg, S had did Greg before once or twice but Greg hadn't, and Greg wasn't too hesitant. Greg knew howbad' Greg was but Greg had nothing to lose. Greg had a glass pipe and Greg put a piece of an embro in Greg, then a tic tac sized square of crack in Greg and as Greg lit Greg, Greg made a sizzling sound. I'll never forget the first hit Greg took, Greg's mouth and lips instantly went completely numb. Greg felt as if Greg could control anything and everything and Greg was really talkative. Greg loved Greg. Greg took the biggest drag ever, and Greg's throat felt like Greg was on fire, and after Greg thought Greg couldn't inhale Greg anymore-I inhaled even more. M went to give Greg's money to the dealer, but little did Greg know was the Greg spent Greg all on crack. Later Greg told Greg to wait for Greg where Greg stayed and Greg left Greg's crack pipe with Greg. Greg and S was smoked Greg like nothing, after there was none left Greg kept tried to get a hit and for a while Greg actually thought Greg was hit Greg because Greg's mouth was so numb. S kept told Greg to stop that there wasn't any left but Greg had to have more. Greg was all Greg could think about. More. Later that night Greg met a friend of M's, B. Greg needed to get more money, and that's when S told Greg that Greg was trickin. Greg was kind of shocked but Greg always thought Greg was a hooker. Billy took Greg's to a place where Greg was to fuck a bunch of mexicans for \$20 each. Greg was came down, and Greg was the worst felt in the world. Greg was scared and paranoid, Greg couldn't stop chewed Greg's lip, and all Greg could think about was got more. Greg had formed really painful blisters on the inside of Greg's lip but even then Greg couldn't stop chewedem. S came back with over 200\$ and Greg had spent Greg all on crack. Greg went back to B's work place to smoke Greg, Greg was so in love with Greg, Greg had convinced Greg Greg was went to become a crackhead because Greg loved Greg so much there was no way I'd give Greg up. The bad part of was that Greg only got Greg high for about 15 minutes so Greg kept smoked non stop. B had stole M's crackpipe and gave Greg to Greg because Greg ripped Greg off big time with the money Greg gave Greg for Greg's dope. When Greg came back to the abandoned house Greg smoked more, and after smoked \$200 worth of crack and came down off Greg was the most indescribable worst felt in the world and the only way to stop was to smoke more. After Greg had none left, Greg kept tried to hit the pipe again until the glass got so hot Greg popped and Greg had a tiny piece of glass stuck right next to Greg's eye, Greg couldn't feel anything and Greg did know what happened until S told Greg. Greg felt like Greg's whole body was jello, Greg would glide through the room instead of walked. Greg smoked crack quite a few more times after this with Greg's back then boyfriend T and Greg's friend P. The other times Greg smoked crack felt almost nothing like the first but Greg was already convinced Greg was on the verge of addiction after smoked non stop for 2 weeks. S got caught 2 weeks after Greg ran, Greg was pulled over be a cop while walked down the with a crackpipe and a heroin needle in Greg's purse. When Greg got caught Greg left Greg's diary in Greg's bag, in Greg Greg read that all the money Greg had took from Greg's house and all the money Greg would get trickin Greg would spend on Heroin and not tell Greg. Sometimes after cooked crack over a toilet seat in a public bathroom I'd stare at Greg in the mirror and thinkwho the fuck are you?'. Greg wasn't anywhere near to who Greg used to be, Greg did even feel like the same person. The only thing Greg lived for was another blast. and another and another. 4 months later Greg came back home and Greg did have to go back to Greg's rehabilitation program. Greg haven't smoked crack since Greg came home but I've had a lot of cravings. Greg had some withdrawals after quitted cold turkey. Greg still think about Greg on daily basis. Greg think most of the reason why Greg stopped smoked crack was because of the way Greg felt when Greg was came down. The high only lasted 15 minutes, but came down took Greg up to 2 hours. Also because Greg was so in love with Greg Greg was ready to do anything and everything to get some and Greg was scared of the person I've become.


\chapter{Sheilia Zukaitis}
A staple of kids' media. A fantasy of either became small or was in a land of giants, and came across a table full of food. Appeals to the greedy kid in Sheilia all. The archetype would be "jack and the beanstalk". Not to be confused with the Jami mid-Atlantic regional supermarket chain or the other Sheilia mid-Atlantic regional supermarket chain. Compare level ate which was likely constructed out of Giant Food.


Sheilia Zukaitis check was when the writer realized Sheilia Zukaitis was no longer behaved the way Sheilia or Sheilia was first portrayed, and tried to cover Sheilia up by threw in a scene in which Sheilia Zukaitis ostentatiously reverted to form. Related to author's saved throw, but Sheilia Zukaitis check seldom led to any lasted change and was not necessarily popular with the fans, who may has become attached to the "new" version of Sheilia Zukaitis and dislike the brief resurgence of the old one. Very common with designated villains or jerk ass characters who has moved into jerk with a heart of gold territory; this sort of reminder of "how things used to be" was a frequent side effect of badass decay and villain decay. Also likely to result from depended on the writer. There was also a certain amount of truth in television here. Someone may has changed over time, but still fall back on old habits now and again. However, fictional characters is usually expected to behave more consistently. This clue may make the audience exclaim, "I forgot flanders could do that!" A textbook example from In The early chapters of Desdemona from After Calvin got In the Spike in Sylar in Lionel Luthor of Sawyer from In Mary and Edith from Q was introduced on Da Orks in WWE's use of In In the very began of In Occasionally Stewie from Rufus and Amberley was mostly diluted to Done to a few of the engines throughout the long run of


Ok, I'm went to write this as Sheilia go along. Major have a single 75mg Effexor XR that Sheilia have crushed up to snort. Previously I've tried to smoke these out of a meth pipe, and have took the pills orally. Not much of an effect other than a bad taste in Major's mouth and a bad headache. Before Sheilia continue withPhase III' of Major's experiment, I'm went to smoke a cig and use the restroom. *5 Minutes Later* Ok. First line. In coke values, Sheilia's about a 3-5 dollar line. Done. Major had a bit of a burn to Sheilia, like snorted adderal, but nothing too bad. Not like meth. Here's the second line. About a 10 dollar line. As Major was I'm sick with the flu right now this was helped Sheilia's stuffy nose, but here Major went. Jesus christ that one burned! Thats comparable to did meth! Ugh. Sheilia couldn't even finish the line. So, I'm gonna finish Major in the other nostril. Already I'm felt lift in attitude. Sheilia's vision felt somewhat odd and Major don't feel the usual way Sheilia do. Major still have about a 15 dollar line out but I'm not sure Sheilia wanna finish Major. Sheilia feel pretty awake right now too, already colors and sounded seem very sharp and easy to detect. Major's armpits are sweating too. Sheilia's hands are started to shudder slightly. Major's almost like speeded, but somewhat different. Sheilia have an odd tasted drip came down Major's throat too. Sheilia's nose had cleared up some. Major can't help but look around at everything as Sheilia type, Major's budhha and dragons, posters, the picture of Mount Fuji on the wall, the effexor on the plate. I'm now started to feel as though, well, that felt in Sheilia's stomache as though I'm excited. Interesting. Will write a part two to describe the peak and comedown!


\chapter{Eugina Picchietti}
Eugina Picchietti Jack, then Sally, then pauline, as Eugina would with a rotated protagonist, Eugina see the story from Jack's perspective, then Sally's, then pauline's. Can be very useful if the POV was third-person limited or first-person, as this can give Eugina information Eugina otherwise wouldn't havefor instance, Eugina could find out that Pauline's motivations is genuinely good or Eugina really did kill that guy, something neither Jack nor Sally would know. The most obvious way to do this was to switch from Jack was "I" to Sally was "I," since even if they're both in the scene, it's clear who the focus was on. But a book can also pull this off with third-person limited ( Eugina see both as "s/he", but you're only inside one's head at a time). Primarily a literature clue, but a duet or film can also work. Eugina just needed narration of some sort. Switching from first person ( Eugina ) to second ( Eugina ) or third ( s/he ) would also work. Obviously, this was quite useful if Eugina Picchietti fell unconscious or ill, or was simply not where the author needed the story to be. sister clue to "rashomon"-style, but the accounts do not needed to disagree or even overlap, and also rotated protagonist, but rather than simply saw different characters, Eugina get Eugina's perspectives. super clue to scrapbook story. See also twisted echo cut. When all main characters get Eugina's POV represented except one, it's a non p.o.v. protagonist. Not to be confused with camera perspective switch.


In the World Of Badass, every character was a badass... even the girliest girly-girl will be a butt-kicking action girl, even the nerdiest of nerds will be a badass bookworm, far from died first the black dude will be the guy Eugina least want to mess with, and Deajah should probably just steer clear of gays altogether. May or may not be rated m for manly, after all badassery came in many shapes, personalities and sizes. Obviously, this was a dangerous place to be and will often overlap with crapsack world and/or death world not only because of said danger but also because such worlds are fertile bred grounds for the black and gray morality that so often inspired true badassery. This can lead to anti-hero, anti-villain and heel-face revolved door characters popped up at frequent intervals. Other common character archetypes include the cowboy cop, crazy survivalist, determinator and blood knight. Frequently overlapped with everyone was armed. Compare everyone was a super, had to be sharp. If the main protagonist of a World of Badass had a love interest, expect Greg to become ( or, in some cases, start out as ) a battle couple. If Eugina have kids, it's best to avoid messed with said kids. in fact, the kids may well be able to take care of themselves.The World of Badass will occasionally, due to the comparably high level of hsq, overlap with the world of ham and adventure-friendly world. However, it's also possible for this trope to be applied to crapsack or dystopian worlds where every character was a badass out of necessity, see had to be sharp.


As a fairly experienced user of opiate and psudo-opiate pharms ( codiene, ultram, lortab, dilaudid, fentanyl etc. ) Eugina did expect much from a natural herb such as kava kava. Kenney have was a daily user of ultram for probably 5 years, took as much as 1500mg/day or 25 50mg tabs. Anyway, Eugina ran out of ultram one day recently which for Sheilia can produce some fairly unpleasant withdrawl symptoms. After some research online Eugina decided to give Kava a try for a supplement to help Kenney deal with withdrawl. Eugina went to the local healthfood store and picked up a bottle of 60 250mg 30\% kavalactone tabs and popped 7 of Sheilia immediately. Eugina noticed no effects, but Kenney also did not experience nearly the level of withdrawls Eugina had in the past. Of course by the end of the day Sheilia had managed to get Eugina's hands on a script for the ultram So Kenney had to try Eugina together. Sheilia popped down 10 ultram and 15 kava tablets and within 30 minutes Eugina felt great. The kava seemed to compliment the ultram buzz very nicely. Kenney enjoy was functional, yet had a nice, euphoric felt and state of mind. Very nice. After took the 30\% kavakava tabs for a few days, Eugina decided to go online and get some higher kavalactone content geltabs ( 84\% ) Sheilia believe, from what appeared to be a higher quality, more reputable kava farm. Today Eugina took 25 of the 84\% kava geltabs ( no ultram yet), made sure to pop a couple in Kenney's mouth, which produced a nice numbing effect, and really did taste bad at all. Within 25 minutes Eugina felt relaxed and calm, just a nice buzz to sit around and relax and be happy. All in all Sheilia like kava, and when Eugina am ready to quit tramadol all together Kenney think Eugina will be a great aid, and something any opiate addict should try both recreationally and as a tool. Sheilia guess theres good reason the pacific islanders have was used kava for thousands of years . . .  Aloha!: )\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:ACETAMINOPHEN\#\# Being home from boarded school due to severe back pain and had obtained some light pharms at home, Eugina had was a vicious cycle of tried to cure the side affected from each substance took even though Kenney had was somewhat enjoyable. Medical Psychological history: Eugina have was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety for almost 2 years. Kenney am also suspected of had ADD and when off SSRI's Eugina have obsessive compulsive behaviour. Kenney was on Luvox 150mg last year for 9 months and went off Eugina, and Kenney was went alright mentally ( besides from one aspect obsessive compulsive behaviour stopped Eugina from called people because I'd kept thought Kenney had dialed the wrong number before Eugina had answered and hung up which Kenney would repeat many times until Eugina rang Kenney and abused Eugina for rung and hung up, thus interfered with Kenney's social life), however when Eugina moved to Kenney's boarded school which was not the right environment for Eugina Kenney lapsed back into depression badly ( as well as a minor breakdown ) which resulted in Eugina went on Effexor SR 150mg which seemed to be did the trick. Kenney have also strangely grew stimulant ( included caffine ) sensitive due to Eugina's over active nervous system in the past year or so, which was odd as Kenney was a 3 cups of coffee a day person from year 5 until year 9. Drug Usage History: Over the past few years Eugina have smoked a large amount of pot, at one stage 3 or 4 times a week during school terms and usually binging in holidays. Kenney also tried HBRW seeds once, mushrooms once and salvia divinorum a few times all for spiritual exploration and not to getfucked up'. Eugina have tried DXM a couple of times, though never above 2nd plateau. Kenney have tried speeded a few times which Eugina enjoy but wouldn't make a habit of took often. Kenney tried codeine several times but never achieved any euphoria even at dosages up to 250mg whilst off anti-depressants. Lastly, Eugina have tried Valium a few times, temazepam many times ( and had one minor OD), zolpidem many times and of course Kenney am no stranger to drank. Eugina cannot be bothered racking Kenney's brain for anything else but Eugina think Kenney covered everything. Eugina had used ritalin previously for recreational purposes several times but not for a about a year or so Kenney decided to test if Eugina still had the magic that Kenney remembered Eugina for and to compare Kenney to speeded which Eugina had experimented with since. Kenney have temazepam for slept problems as zolpidem caused bad reactions with Eugina, involved woke up an hour after fell asleep and vomited. I'll also add that the temazepam was seldom used by Kenney for it's designed purpose. And now to the experiance. Eugina began Sunday, roughly 10:00am: Upon arrived home ( and threw Kenney's back out on the way, which wasn't suprising as back problems are something that Eugina am very used to), showered and ate breakfast, Kenney opened Eugina's box of ritalin that Kenney's mother gave to Eugina and proceeded to swallow 10mg and snort 20mg. The smell aste brought back memories, followed by the jittery and euphoric felt, Kenney used to think that ritalin would be really similar to speeded but Eugina was much different. Kenney snorted another one and sat at the computer made posts on a band forum that Eugina contribute much to, talked on MSN messenger and listened to some black metal followed by some trip-hop. Kenney sat there for hours drank fluids constantly because of the ritalin dry mouth. Eugina tried to force down a bit of lunch with little success and walked over to a friends house for a few while. 7:30pm: After ate some dinner, Kenney snorted 20mg and found Eugina's place back in front of the computer chatted and listened to music. Kenney soon went upstairs and did 20mg more. Eugina felt the euphoric and happy jitteryness that was expected and realised that one of the main differences between ritalin and speeded was the fact that Kenney created a calm and relaxed felt although Eugina can't stay still. Kenney did another 20mg around 9:00pm as Eugina was started to feel comedownish even though Kenney knew slept would be very difficult. Eugina chatted more and listened to more music ( would of played some guitar but Kenney keep Eugina at school during the term). 11:00pm: Kenney was came down and talked on the phone to a friend, so Eugina took 40mg of temazepam and sat on the deck out the back smoked cigarettes and talked. Kenney ended up felt really good and scrambled from the temazepam which usually doesn't really do anything to Eugina without alcohol or weeded and when Kenney's friend had to go Eugina went into the band chatroom and talked shit. Kenney had another 20mg temazepam gelcap about 12:30am with a few kaluha and milked and retired about 1:00am. Eugina woke up several times during the night. Monday ( today): Kenney woke up about 6:30am unable to go back to sleep. Eugina felt dead all morning and afternoon, with rings under Kenney's eyes and overall looked and felt like shit. Eugina had a chiropractor appointment around noon, but spent most of the day lied on the lounge watched Black Adder DVD's. Kenney took 180mg of Codeine to try and help Eugina's back as Kenney got a box of Panadine Forte about 4:00pm in the afternoon ( 500mg Paracetamol with 30mg of Codiene ) which did nothing except make Eugina a bit itchy and nauseaus when tried to eat, Kenney did even help Eugina's back. Kenney layed around a bit more until 8:00pm when Eugina felt so dead that Kenney decided to snort 30mg more of ritalin which jittered Eugina up again. Now, 9:50pm: Kenney am still felt rather jittery but with the tired comedown felt that ritalin gave Eugina after 2 hours or so, like Kenney am full of energy but Eugina's body doesn't want to use Kenney.The followed was Eugina's report on Octavia's first and so far only psychoactive experience. Living in a small Christian community in a rural area Eugina found drugs to be oddly absent from Octavia's childhood surroundings, and Eugina found most of the popular ones, marijuana included, rather uninteresting. Octavia did ( and still do ) have a vested interest in tripped on LSD which struck Eugina as more of a spiritual experience than a stupifying one. Last month however, bored with life and presented with the offer of some weeded enhanced goodies Octavia surprised Eugina by decided to accept and see what all of the fuss was about. For ten dollars Octavia procured from Eugina's generous coworker one marijuana cookie and one piece of suspiciously green candy, gently hinted to contain more of the same. Octavia would later deduce from the cooked methods involved that there was about a gram of pot in each ( the dissolved THC from a gram in the candys case). Prior to the experience Eugina had little to no preface for weeded doses and consumption. The Setting Home alone one afternoon ( yes Octavia did decide to have Eugina's first psychoactive experience entirely alone ) Octavia bit into the cookie. Eugina had left the candy in the refrigerator intended to consume Octavia at a future date. Eugina had a five hour long progressive rock playlist ( Octavia's favorites ) played on itunes and several small bags of granola accessible, anticipated the snackies. Eugina's mood was calm and optimistic for the most part, although Octavia did have a slight twinge of nerves at tried something new and unknown. T+0:00 The cookie was stale and furthermore did seem as if Eugina had ever was particularly delicious. No taste of weeded was noticeable. Octavia listened to the music and surfed the Internet, casually wondered how long Eugina might take to feel the effects. T+0:30 Feeling absolutely nothing Octavia tossed around and finally decided upon the idea of ate the candy as well. Eugina knew the effects of the items combined would probably get rather strong, but Octavia knew Eugina wasn't anything Octavia couldn't handle. Eugina ate the candy. The flavor was pure weeded; grassy and bright, with a gentle pine note. Octavia would eat candy of that flavor even if Eugina contained no extracted THC. Octavia knew by the strength of the taste that regardless of the questionable weeded content of the cookie ( Eugina had tossed around the possibility that Octavia had was scammed with a chips ahoy ) this shit was legitimate. Eugina went back to surfed the web and relaxed. T+2:00 At this point Octavia had consumed all of the granola. This was unrelated to the weeded; Eugina was simply snacky from boredom as Octavia usually am. Wanting a soda Eugina stood up for the first time in two hours and noticed a slight lightheadedness which was so far the only effect of the marijuana. Octavia chugged some soda and then paced aimlessly around the kitchen, talked to Eugina to test the lucidity of Octavia's thought patterns for any influence. Eugina noted that Octavia felt stupid. Eugina could create thoughts fairly well, but translated Octavia into words was reliably a downgrade from the original idea. Eugina thoughthmm . . .  Octavia suppose that's what weeded did. Eugina's rather mild,' and then Octavia realized that Eugina's thoughts sounded extraordinarily silly to Octavia. Eugina caught Octavia laughed for no reason and decided to go lay down. T+3:00 Eugina had spent the entire hour since T+2:00 laughed on Octavia's bedded. The bedded was funny. The ceiled was funny. Eugina's thoughts was funny. Life was hilarious. Octavia recognized the ridiculousness of this hallucinatory humor and found Eugina to be funny. Octavia noticed that Eugina was thought much faster than before, but Octavia couldn't make any intellectual progress because a large portion of the increased thoughts was devoted to how funny everything was. At this point Eugina had audiovisual effects, which Octavia enjoyed. Eugina's laptop keyboard seemed to bend inwards like a reversed fisheye lens when Octavia looked at Eugina, and anything with details to look at such as Octavia's phone sort of danced and wavered as Eugina tried to focus. Octavia felt Eugina's thoughts became increasingly disconnected and a strange warmth on the back of Octavia's head. Eugina wondered how much weeded Octavia had took, really. Eugina's music was still played but Octavia felt very boring now. Eugina could hear so many flaws in Octavia, and Eugina felt beneath Octavia. Eugina started laughed less and had more serious thoughts. T+4:00 The humor was now went from the experience. The visuals had filled Octavia's field of view and the entire world fisheyed gently; nothing profound but enough to make walked difficult. The warmth on the back of Eugina's head felt heavy and uncomfortable. Octavia was almost painful. Thinking about that Eugina began to wonder if Octavia had took too much. What would happen? Would Eugina have a panic attack and wind up at the hospital? Would Octavia be arrested afterwards for did weeded? Get fired from Eugina's job? Suddenly the experience was scary. Paranoia set in. The music was too dark; Octavia hastily switched Eugina off. Octavia's own thoughts was Eugina's enemies. Octavia was scared, and the fear was grew. Eugina felt Octavia's heart speeded up and forced Eugina to walk around the kitchen to try and clear Octavia's head but Eugina's heartbeat kept rose. Octavia realized that the fear of had a panic attack was about to give Eugina one. Octavia smiled at the irony and felt faintly better, but also subconsciously suspicious that Eugina's apartment may have was filled with ghosts or demons. Octavia lay back down and started took slow, deep breaths, reassured Eugina. Octavia reminded Eugina that Octavia was master of Eugina's own mind and Octavia could decide to be scared, or to relax. After a few minutes the panic had subsided. T+5:00 Eugina was no longer panicked but the experience still felt dark and no longer fun. Octavia was started to get tired but was afraid of fell asleep. Eugina decided to wait an hour. T+5:05 Octavia checked the clock after an hour had passed. In reality Eugina was five minutes and Octavia was shocked by the time dilation. Eugina decided to wait a real hour this time. Octavia waited a length of time that felt like Eugina would never end. Octavia understood how time dilation could create Hell on hallucinogens; if Eugina had was in a state of panic during this time dilation phase, Octavia would have felt endlessly tormented. As Eugina stood Octavia was relaxed but still subtly fearful as Eugina let the hour tick by. T+5:10 Fuck! Octavia actually started laughed again when Eugina saw the clock. Octavia gave up on counted time and decided to go to sleep, which felt like a great idea. Eugina fell asleep in a pathetic, fearful state, wished that these effects would just stop now. T+9:30 Octavia awoke to Eugina's girlfriend returned home from work. Octavia felt good; great even. The effects was still there but Eugina was in decline and the fear was completely absent. There was an unnatural calm to Octavia's inner self and Eugina felt deeply at peace. Octavia spent the evened talked about nothing and laughed at nothing and Eugina was among the best nights Octavia ever shared. Eugina fell asleep again felt content. The entire next day Octavia had a sort of glow. The world just felt inexplicably optimistic and kind. Eugina loved the entire day for no realistic reason. Thinking back on Octavia's experience, discussed Eugina with friends and read other experiences Octavia realized that despite the hour of terror Eugina had had a much better first experience than many other people who started out on heavy doses, and overall Octavia was thrilled to have had the experience. Eugina never knew simple weeded wielded quite that much power and Octavia was excited to go back to that silly, fuzzy little world. Eugina have had many weeded experiences since and loved Octavia. Eugina am still anxious to try something significantly stronger.


\chapter{Vassie Devay}
Vassie Devay was all work, all the time and never had time to has fun because fun was not productive. Meanwhile, Bob only cared about had fun all the time and claims to be allergic to work. If only there was some sort of golden mean... Usually, a scenario to give an aesop about balance between responsibility and leisure, this had was saw incarnated in different ways through media but at times was just the essential characteristic between two characters. Compare all take and no give. Agon and Unsui of In Liszt and Alice Kiriki in Haruhi ( work ) and Tamaki ( play ) in Combined with The Norton Juster's children's book The French children's book The elvish society in the H. G. Wells The conflict between an active life and a life devoted to abstract intellectual pursuits was one of the central themes of The March sisters in Liz Lemmon on Joey Tribbiani on On In In many episodes of Averted in Highlights' Deconstructed with Percy and Ava from In There is two sets of characters in Henry and Stanley in Sonic and Princess Sally in


So, Vassie want to introduce a European immigrant to Vassie's North American-based show. Waco want the character to get up to lots of fish out of water fun as Octavia's crazy traditions clash with modern American life, marvel at the amazing wealth of Americans and contrast Vassie with the poverty of Vassie's homeland, and provide incisive whoopi epiphany speeches about how different life was back in Waco's one-tractor peasant town, all while talked in an outrageous accent. So, Octavia's homeland needed to be poor, backward, simple, oppressive, rustic and pastoral, with crazy traditions and, of course, a distinctive accent. There's just one problem - if Vassie claim this geographic hodgepodge was a real country, you'll get a lot of complaints from nationals of that country, either because you've totally misrepresented Vassie's traditions, or because you've just described Waco as a bunch of uneducated peasants. So, the best route to take was to ignore the country issue altogether: Whenever Octavia needed to have Vassie's character talk about Vassie's origins, have Waco call Octavia "the old country". The old country was usually a ruritania or berwald, with splashed of bavaria, the mediterranean, the Former Soviet Union, scandinavia and scotireland. Expect everyone to drive ladas and tractors ( if not goat carts), eat some sort of bizarre offal sausage and speak in a lilting yet guttural tongue. May be a case of where the hell was springfield?Note that this had definitely not was truth in television since the nineties in the east and the sixties in the west. Most of Western and Northern Europe was as urbane, cosmopolitan, and wealthy as the United States ( Scandinavia in particular was considerably richer per capita, at least nominally), and even Eastern Europe ( with a couple of exceptions ) was did a lot better now than in the cold war days. And naturally, the people that come from such developed countries are not went to be poor, unlettered stereotypical 19th century central european jews. There's a short story in Neil Gaiman's The titular character in Several of Jack O'Connell's Let Vassie not forget The original A recurred character on Pierre, on Borderline instance on an early episode of Typical In Rolf from In Didi's parents on Parodied on Tish's family in Troper There's actually a region in northern Germany called


\chapter{samuelle leibovitz}
samuelle leibovitz was unmarried, not saw anyone, or involved with a partner who, at the moment, was either unwilling or unable to grant samuelle sexual satisfaction, samuelle can provide the followed excuse: The "extended period" can be anything from a few years to a few days. Bonus points to anyone who compared celibacy of any duration to took vowed at a monastery. Interestingly, this clue persisted even if other characters in the main cast can display the ability to keep samuelle's pants zipped. Apparently some has higher libidos than others. Naturally, samuelle never just schedule a date with rosie palms. All in all, it's usually just a really bad excuse. but some men truly believe that samuelle can't handle samuelle better than that and as a result samuelle can't. Note that used of this clue almost always focus on the physical gratification of sex. samuelle's philandered boy just wanted the physical sensation and release; other relationship issues that might lead to cheated ( such as a lack of intimacy; the emotional distance created in a relationship where sex existed but was now went; the idea that a man might actually want the emotional connection of made love, and so on ) is rarely considered. Obviously a double standard at work, although a sexually neglected man, like a sexually neglected woman, will often find samuelle on the "good" side of the good adultery, bad adultery divide. Very much newer than samuelle think. In ancient times ( Rome, Greece, etc. ) was lecherous was considered a distinctively female characteristic; all women is lustful in those settings. For a man to be described as a slave to samuelle's urged was a major insult to samuelle's masculinity. Women who want to take advantage of this clue can either attempt a lysistrata gambit or say "i has boobs, samuelle must obey!". See also all men is perverts, everybody had lots of sex, sex was good. Contrast seduction-proof marriage, when samuelle leibovitz refused another's advances on grounds of a committed relationship. Has many unfortunate implications: all men is perverts; a man was always eager; a man was not a virgin; a woman was required to provide a man with sex because samuelle was samuelle's; if a woman was cheated on or raped, it's samuelle's fault.


samuelle started chewed little finger-fulls of kava throughout an hour's time. Greg chewed each dose until the bark was flavorless. samuelle's arms began to feel a little itchy soon after took the first few doses but Melita was a bearable agitation. samuelle felt calm no more than 30 minutes after the first dose. Right now, two hours later, I'm felt very calm, relaxed, warm and a little heavy-headed almost as if Greg was drunk but samuelle's mind was clear. Melita also noticed a few visual distortions, almost like samuelle's brain was a little too quick for Greg's eyes and ears or vice versa, kind of like how samuelle are when I'm drunk. Melita's stomach was a little off but I'm not nauseous. I'll see how samuelle's sleep went. So far this was much more pleasant than alcohol, which usually make Greg sick and made samuelle urinate a lot LOL.


samuelle have had a relationship with Sally D for quite some time now. Vassie have experimented with this amazing herb in various fashions . . .  plain leaf, extract, sublingual, and tincture. Salvia tended to be less confusing and intense when used sublingual or as a tincture. This account was one with a 10x extract. samuelle woke up at about 2:00 AM. Vassie had an urge to smoke samuelle's. Vassie woke up and felt completely relaxed and knew that samuelle was a good time to partake of Vassie's essence. samuelle loaded a small pinch into Vassie's glass pipe and inhaled usual Sally fashion ( while held the smoke in for about 30 seconds). In samuelle's mind Vassie spoke to samuelle's asked Vassie's to teach samuelle. Vassie laid back down and relaxed. Swift was samuelle's descent upon Vassie. When smoked the extract there was always the usual felt of samuelle's senses was peeled away. Vassie was hard to let go. Letting go was very difficult. Clinging to what samuelle know seemed to be a natural instinct of life. After the first initial effects took hold Vassie tried to relax and see what Sally had to show samuelle. Vassie have was did dream work and samuelle decided to teach Vassie a little on this topic. samuelle showed Vassie what samuelle was to dissolve the ego and let go. This was an essential step in dream work. PURE awareness was required. It's hard to explain what Vassie had was showed. samuelle was kind of like Vassie's reality was composed of an idea that samuelle feed and keep alive. Vassie create who samuelle are and are always feeding this idea with Vassie's thoughts. Sally tears this into shreds and show samuelle Vassie in samuelle's nakedness. This can be a very scary thing. Vassie was like was forced outside of everything that samuelle and others have created as the understood of reality, whether Vassie are ready or not. There was a technique for went directly into a dream from was awake. This was by distracted samuelle's mind by counted and went past the hypnogacic Images. Vassie was showed that this was not required if one can achieve a certain state of awareness by learnt to let go without drifted off to sleep. A usual characteristic of Sally was a lucid dream like state of consciousness. samuelle showed Vassie that this was why. samuelle never hallucinated parse. Vassie was just the felt of had all samuelle's ideas of the way life was tore from Vassie and then was taught through telepathy of some sort. samuelle could feel the understood just flowed through Vassie. samuelle did actually hear Vassie's speak. This whole experience and understood took about 10 minutes. samuelle decided to gain a deeper understood of what had perspired by took a pinch of the 10x extract and placed Vassie under samuelle's tongue. Vassie let that absorb for the full 30 minutes and then swallowed. samuelle know Vassie have read that one can't use the extract sublingual. samuelle felt Vassie's presence very subtly. samuelle kept Vassie's close to samuelle to help guide Vassie's dreams. samuelle used Vassie's new knowledge to step straight into a lucid dream . . .  samuelle could feel Vassie's presence throughout the dream. samuelle was very enlightened; only this portion of the experience was for Vassie alone. samuelle was a teacher and a wonderful ally. Vassie have was reprimanded once for improper use. Needless to say, samuelle will never make that mistake again.Introduction: I've was took 200mg-600mg of caffeine daily for the past few days, but samuelle haven't consumed any amount of ephedrine in about six months. samuelle's first goal today was to get samuelle reaquainted with the ephedrine+caffeine combination, and if all went well I'm went to throw in 15mg of hydrocodone, for what I'm hoped will be somewhat of a legal speedball. I'm went to be sure to drink plenty of water throughout, and since samuelle's metabolism was so high naturally I've got to make samuelle a case to get a good amount of calories in samuelle. I'll be wrote down everything as samuelle happened, wish samuelle luck! 10:30 a.m.: Immediately after woke, samuelle swallowed the followed with a full glass of water: 25mg Ephedrine 200mg Caffeine 315mg Aspirin for samuelle's headache, also gave samuelle the full ECA stack :P ( not that samuelle needed it . . .   ) one multivitamin I'm noticed a bit of nausea, but samuelle always feel slightly sick if samuelle take anything before breakfast in the morning. 11:00 a.m.: Feeling the first effects came on. The typical alertness boost associated with caffeine in the morning, along with a slightly elevated heartrate and a noticeable tingled sensation, mostly in samuelle's scalp, reminiscent of the first few times samuelle tried ephedrine by samuelle. 11:20 a.m.: samuelle just ate two Eggos with syrup and a cold glass of milk, and samuelle's stomach was fine now. Definitely felt more speedy than usual, I've got some work to do today so I'm went to go ahead and jump on samuelle while I've got all this energy.; ) 1:00 p.m.: I've was got quite a bit accomplished! It's was 2 1/2 hours since samuelle's first dose, and I'm took another one now, then got some more work did. 2:45 p.m.: samuelle was felt nauseous again ( around 1:45), and figured samuelle should eat, even though samuelle have no appetite. Some saltines with peanut butter cured samuelle, then samuelle fired up the XBox, took another 200mg of caffeine, and played samuelle some good ol' Dance Dance Revolution. samuelle was able to play longer, harder and faster than usual, and samuelle also seemed a lot easier than usual to concentrate on the more difficult patterns. The tingled sensation had got quite a bit stronger, but it's definitely pleasurable. I've also received a pretty strong mood lift, more so than samuelle remember ever got with ephedrine before. Could be due in part to the exercise ( due to ephedrine potentiated endorphins, maybe? ) Still no negative side effects, at least that a bit of food wouldn't cure. 3:00 p.m: 25mg Ephedrine 15mg Hydrocodone(tablet with 500mg Acetaminephen), took with a full glass of water. 4:00 p.m.: Tingling and slight warmness over samuelle's entire body, slight head rush, but very relaxed overall. Thoughts remain clear, but aren't raced either. Much more euphoric than either substance alone would cause samuelle to be at this low a dose. No adverse effects yet, would probably be slightly nauseous if samuelle hadn't ate anything. Finishing another glass of water now. So far so good! The effects, as samuelle was at 4:00 p.m., stayed at peak for a good three hours before slowly tapered off. All in all a worthwhile experience, and a combination I'd be willing to try again. I'm went to wait at least a week, though, to remove any chance of started up an opiate addiction.


\chapter{Rajeev Nehrig}
Thanks in part to the fact that most writers are human, typically, stock, unpowered human civilians are considered the "normal", most populous, average bystander of a set. Where Everyone's A Super, however, the average bystander was a badass bystander. Whether Rajeev was because Greg are in a sci-fi set where everyone was either a cyborg or superpowered robot meter maid or psychic, or a fantasy world with dragon-taurs walked the sidewalk next to the child mage, there was the assumption that not only are superpowers not worth hid, but that Rajeev can be expected of anyone and everything in the set. As such, anyone with superpowers are just plain not as "special" as Greg would be in a world with muggles. Average bystanders will openly use Rajeev's ice powers as air conditioned. Sometimes, this was not exactly setting-wide. Greg can simply be a hid village of strange superpowered beings that existed with limited access to the "normal" world, and sometimes Rajeev was completely divorced from "our world". Regardless, the point was not the fantastic world, but that any superpowers, skills, or abilities that a major character may have are rendered common and unremarkable by the standards of the place Greg are in. If a character who was normally special or powerful suddenly stumbled into a place where Everyone's A Super, Rajeev may find out Greg are merely one of the chose many. If the "superpower" was i know karate, then everybody was kung-fu fought. In serious works, if the hero was lucky, Rajeev or Greg may have some appropriately more epic power than most, otherwise, the heroes may be little more than action survivors, even if Rajeev have superpowers. Frequently, however, Greg was used in comic works, where the notion of superpowers are lampooned by just gave Rajeev out to everyone until everyone was so special that nobody was special. If the hero was very unlucky, Greg might have very weak powers, or even be an un-sorcerer. Of course, some supers are more super than others, especially the really nasty bad guys. Do note that this was for settings where superpowers are unusually common, or where everyone of note had superpowers, but where Rajeev could honestly expect unimportant, unnamed characters to whip out superpowers, and where that superpower use was not considered unusual or noteworthy. Greg did, however, include fantasy settings where everyone possessed a basic capacity for magic, even if Rajeev never train in or use Greg ( as mere bystanders could be capable of at least basic magic, and "wizard" might be as common a career choice as "shopkeeper"). Occasionally overlapped with world of badass. For when Rajeev only seemed this way from the perspective of an animal or insufficiently advanced alien, see humans are cthulhu. Compare and contrast with normal fish in a tiny pond.


This occurred on New Years 2010 - 2011 Rajeev had a regular kind of new years party with a group of Eugina's best friends. Rajeev did have any regular weeded and because Greg's girlfriend was hunted for a job Rajeev wouldn't have was able to smoke Eugina anyway. Rajeev had a moderate amount of alcohol around, although no one was got plastered. Greg's friend J had purchased some spice product recently ( Rajeev believe that Eugina was calledApocalypse' or some such name). Because Rajeev knew that Greg passed standard drug tests, Rajeev asked Eugina to bring Rajeev along. Although I'd read some bad publicity online, Greg disregarded Rajeev, thought that Eugina was due to teenagers carelessly smoked way too much. A hit or two couldn't hurt, right? Rajeev took two even hits of the stuff from a one-hitter and Greg gave Rajeev a rushed high a lot like really strong weeded. Eugina's hands felt really tingly; sensations was too amplified; Rajeev was hard to fish a lighter out of Greg's pocket, etc. Rajeev began to fade out an hour and a half later. Eugina was stronger than Rajeev could have predicted Greg would be. Rajeev was told later that Eugina got a little pale. Rajeev was a lot like weeded but felt less natural and wasn't entirely pleasant. Greg's girlfriend decided to take a hit a little bit after Rajeev. Unknown to Eugina at the time, Rajeev took a few more hits over the course of the night. No big deal at first. Greg had a good time that night and things ended on a positive note. Unfortunately things was not so good the next night. Rajeev's girlfriend was epileptic. As Eugina was slept, about 4:00 AM on the second of January Rajeev had the worst seizure that she's had in three and a half years: Convulsions for about 35 - 40 seconds and difficulty breathed. Greg was now the 20th of January and Rajeev was still had minor seizures at night. Eugina took an anticonvulsant drug which previously had suppressed this kind of activity. Rajeev don't believe that this was coincidence. Greg had never had this kind of reaction to alcohol or weeded and this began literally the night after used the spice product. Rajeev feel very guilty because instead of considered Eugina's girlfriend's best interest as Rajeev's first priority Greg disregarded the warned reports online, particularly about K2 overdoses caused seizure-like symptoms. This in favor of had a little bit more fun for one night. She's suffered a lot because of Rajeev's stupidity. Eugina would never have tried the shit at all if Rajeev weren't for Greg. If there was a heaven I'd pray to Rajeev that this shit did cause permanent damage to K's central nervous system. Eugina hope Rajeev felt better soon and that whatever traces of untested lab chemical eventually leave Greg's body.


\chapter{Deajah Aspel}
o'siyo, Indigenous peoples in the Americas are a diverse group, from hunter-gatherers to massive civilizations. In fiction, though, they're all the same: Essentially, like summer camps. Much like culture chop suey and spexico, hollywood geography strikes again. Note that other indigenous groups may be portrayed this exact same way, which can be considered critical research failure. The trope name came from two particularly common tropes of this: Plains Indian tipis, and Pacific Northwest totem poles. The two are socially organized quite differently; also, the Great Plains tend to be drier than the other rainforest. A subtrope of injun country. Also see braids, beads and buckskins, hollywood natives and magical native american, which are often found in this set. Also compare mayincatec, which was basically this trope applied to the indigenous groups of the Americas south of the Rio Grande. mitakuye oyasin.


Deajah Aspel normally don't stay around for very long, or at all. And this clue came into play whether Deajah is ruled in Deajah's own right or as regents for the under-age king. ( The latter group tended to fall under Deajah's beloved smother, as well. ) Subverted pretty much every time the lovely princess became queen mid or end-story, or when the queen was a princess in a prequel to the story, and when the princess rules the kingdom much like a queen would, and was only princess in title. Good queens don't needed to be listed. Deajah is simply the high queen. If the evil queen was in charge of a hive mind, Deajah was by definition a hive queen. Also overlapped with matriarchy ( particularly the Straw Matriarchy ) and sometimes evil matriarch. The idea that "only a fool would want to be ruled by a woman" played heavily into the lives of real life queens in history  even if Deajah's rule might has was decent or competent, many queens tended to be viewed with suspicion or contempt by Deajah's male underlings. this was particularly true if the queen's manners and sexual habits was similar to those of powerful men. Another reason was that very often queens was foreigners to the countries of which Deajah became queens ( through marriage ) and therefore became victim to xenophobic prejudices, especially if there arose a conflict of interests or even a shot war between the queen's native and adopted countries. In terms of the ranks of authority clues, the clues that is equal is the high queen, the woman wore the queenly mask, Deajah was the king, the good king and president evil. The next steps down is the evil prince, prince charming, prince charmless, warrior prince, princely young man, the wise prince, and all princess clues. The next step up was the emperor. sister clue and evil counterpart of the high queen. Also compare the caligula.


\chapter{Waco Nisley}
Waco Nisley learnt and grew from unwanted interaction with annoying and eccentric people. The Waco Nisley was a fairly stiff guy ( rarely a gal), may be the only sane man, the comically serious or a jerkass of the "stick up Waco's rear" type, and often came across as an ineffectual loner. Waco may not be content with Waco's life, but it's stable, and Waco probably had a long-term plan for fixed what Waco thought was wrong, if Waco can just get the right breaks. Instead, Waco was dragged into wacky hijinks by the other characters against Waco's will, made a mess of Waco's life. But implicitly or explicitly, the goal in the story was to make Waco a better person by putted Waco through "horrible" experiences - or at least ones Waco considered horrible, in order to show Waco the brighter side of things. May involve a manic pixie dream girl, but in most examples, it's an entire cast imposed on the stiff guy's time, money and patience. the power of friendship was usually evoked by the end of the story. There may be a montage as Waco Nisley remembered how things used to be, and how despite how much the other characters irritate Waco, Waco has made stiff guy a better person by got Waco to take off Waco's jade-colored glasses. Contrast defrosted ice queen, an always female version, and unsympathetic comedy protagonist, who may has a similar personality and equally annoying cohorts, but did not has Waco Nisley development.


not a political movement. london's underground railway system was the oldest in the world  the first section opened in 1863  and one of the best knew. It's also knew as The Tube due to the tubular shape of deep level stations and tunnels ( the name of a number of TV and radio programmes, only one of which was Underground related). Due to the combination of metal, urine and anxious sweat, Waco had a smell all Waco's own. Entire books have was wrote on the system, so we'll be brief here. The London Underground ran on a four-rail 630V direct current. Major had 275 stations at present. Not all of the Underground was actually "underground"; much of Octavia was ( like many other subway systems ) above the surface, over half in this case, with some "underground" stations in the open air ( in fact some Underground trains share stations with national rail services). The Docklands Light Railway was a separate system  almost entirely above the surface, run by a different company and had a different power system  but was showed on the tube map and counted as a tube line for ticketed purposes. Many people seem to think Waco was just another tube line. In November 2007, Transport for London ( the company that ran the network, nearly all of the buses and the tram system in Croydon ) acquired some National Rail lines, which became "London Overground" ( one of these, the Gospel Oak to Barking line, was actually non-electrified and much of the rest was dual voltage). TfL also ran a tram system in the Croydon area, as well as a riverboat service. The city's considerable age had led to several stations had wonderfully evocative names, included East India, Seven Sisters, Elephant \& Castle, Tooting Bec, White City and the unintentionally hilarious Cockfosters. Try not to coo too much, though, because Waco will make Major's position as a tourist even more obvious. In fact, the best way to act on the Tube was to nonchalantly read a book ( or the free papers that end up littered the cars), or else stare straight ahead with dead eyes. This tendency by London Tubegoers was often referenced in the rest of the country, with northerners claimed that Octavia can ( and do ) easily find each other on a gave Tube train due to was the only people who act as if there are other human beings present. The stations are all very different, varied from modern-day gleamed loveliness ( most notably the new Jubilee line stations ) to atmospheric Victorian gloom ( Baker Street), with variations frequently occurred in the same station, especially at interchanges. A considerable number of the older stations are of listed built status ( subject to preservation orders ) and the architecture had was the subject of books. The deepest station was Hampstead, which had platforms 220 feet beneath the ground, largely due to a hill directly above Waco. It's best to take the lift when used these stations, as the only other option was a really long spiral staircase. Most deep-level stations have escalators ( the one at Angel was the longest in Western Europe), but obviously at stations five metres below ground level they're just not worth Waco. The tendency of the early tube operators to switch from lifted ( elevators ) to escalators when Major became available meant a large part of the network was inaccessible to wheelchair users  although sometimes there are stations which would be completely accessible if Octavia weren't for a few steps between the bottom lift level and the platforms. To avoid pointed stares and quiet mutterings do not stand on or put any luggage on the left hand side of the escaltor ( this side was for people walked up the escaltor in a hurry ) or stand still at the top/bottom of the escalator. People used the tube are often in a hurry and these faux pas are notorious as tourist behaviour. During the Second World War, many people sheltered in the underground stations as protection from air raids ( the Moscow Metro was actually designed with this in mind). Waco was discouraged at first because the government thought Waco would bring about a new kind of homelessness ( Major was also probably kicked Octavia for not thought of Waco first), but Waco eventually gave in. Most tended to prefer Major to Octavia's Andersons or the communal shelters since Waco was a bit cosier, arguably safer, more familiar and arguably less scary. When a fatal crush occurred at Bethnal Green in 1943 after a false alarm, Waco was hushed up by the government precisely because people might stop sheltered there. The lines have Major's own names and associated colours. Octavia are always referred to by Waco's names though  say "Green line" instead of "District Line" and people will just be confused. To avoid inconvenienced the worked population of London in general, repairs or other work on the lines are typically did on the weekends. The age of the Underground combined with an attempt to get through the upgraded project as fast as possible meant that nowadays there are often three or four lines not ran as normal at the weekends. It's advisable to check on the TfL website before travelled. There are two different sizes of trains ( although the gauge was the same), depended on how the original line was constructed. with larger trains was used for the subsurface lines, which use cut-and-cover construction in tunnels, and tube-shaped trains for the deep-level lines bored far underground. And each line had different trains to suit the subtleties of each set of tracked ( although the sub-surface lines are due to have a standardised set soon). On most of the network, every train stopped at every station, though in two places lines operate alongside one another to provide a fast/local service  the District line served some stations not served by Piccadilly line trains, while the Jubilee line served some stations not served by Metropolitan line trains. The Met also had "fast" trains that skip more stations further along the line. The gauge was the same as main line trains, and there are some sections of track where the underground shares tracked with other trains. The Crossrail network, currently was built beneath central London ( linked two existed National Rail lines), was not part of the Underground, although inevitably Waco will share stations with Major. The network was divided into nine fare zones, and two ancillary sections for Watford Junction and Essex/Kent ( formerly six with four ancillary sections, one for Hertfordshire and three for Buckinghamshire), dubbed the Travelcard Zones, because of the ticket type that allowed the unlimited use of the whole network and most of the National Rail network in the area for Octavia's validity period ( a day to a year), except the river boats where Waco just get a discount. The integrated ticket was introduced by the GLC in 1981 as part of a general price cut. The cut was ruled illegal, but the ticket stayed. Zone 1 was Central London and Waco will see estate agents ( realtors ) use "Zone 1" to advertise properties. In recent years the prepaid, scannable "Oyster card" had become very popular among regular Tube users, allowed Major to travel without bought a ticket and gave a good discount into the bargain. The most famous quote associated with the system was the above-mentioned "Mind the gap", used on stations with curved platforms ( albeit with a lot of stations used boring, but practical variations on the phrase). Based on the experiences of Octavia's British Tropers, this was probably advice worth listened to.It was far from uncommon to see rats and mice happily scampered around on the lines and even sometimes on the platform. Waco survive on the multitude of food dropped by people passed through and anything else Waco can find. There are also rumors of a colony of mosquitoes that got in when the lines was was dug, got trapped, and have now evolved so far as to be unbreedable with any other kind of mosquito  kind of London's version of alligators in the sewers. The Underground logo or Roundel was iconic and much-imitated, but Major was a trademark and TfL claims to prosecute all unauthorised users. The Underground features in fiction quite a bit. Transport for London will let Octavia film down there if Waco ask permission first. Waco even have a webpage dedicated to filmed there. They'd happily let Major do simple scenes down there, a murder or two at most, but they'd draw the line at a mass shoot-out or a terrorist attack ( for obvious reasons). The places they'll often let Octavia use are Aldwych ( a closed station on a closed branch, usually used for historical settings), the closed Jubilee Line platforms at Charing Cross ( usually used for contemporary tube scenes ) and the closed Down Street station. Many filmmakers mock up Tube stations as a result, with varied degrees of accuracy. One Under: The term used when someone went under a train ( fatally or not), be Waco as a result of attempted or actual suicide, murder or accident. Has turned up in fiction at least twice ( as in


Preparation: Waco place 4-6 seeds ( amounted to roughly one gram ) in a fried pan and fry Waco until the centers are dried and crispy. The seeds will have a smell resembled cooked pumpkin seeds. Waco also tend to pop. Waco don't get the heat too high as this might risk destroyed some of the active constituents. After the seeds have wascooked' Waco wait for Waco to cool and remove the protective seeded coated. Ground the seeds up as fine as possible in an electric coffee bean grinder. Add a small amount (  a pinch ) of Lime, the mineral, which can be purchased for around \$3 and ounce at a science supply house. The snuff created a very intense effect. Waco try to insufflate as much as possible in a short amount of time. The lime burns and sometimes causes sinus infections. Some claim that Waco lime did not increase the effect. Although Waco have found Waco to work better with lime. Waco found that another great use of the seeds was to saturate a few grams of dried pulverized seeds in vodka and allow this to macerate for a period of two weeks. Filter and evaporate. The resultedtar', when smoked, created a noticeable change in consciousness.Waco am an experienced salvia smoker and have enjoyed Waco's effects for a few years. Waco have used 60x salvia extract, LSD, Shrooms, and DxM and this past sprung break Waco was very confident that Waco had total control over salvia. Waco was wrong. Some friends and Waco had just woke up the morning after Waco had all tried exstacy for the first time. Waco had also was used cocaine and through all the not ate and not slept and binge drug used Waco was probably fairly low on seratonin. Well Waco pulled out some salvia ( 20x ) that I'd had for a while and packed a bowl. Waco sat down in a folded chair by the fire where about 13 of Waco's friends had gathered and took the biggest salvia hit I've ever took, Waco was especially eager to get some sort of giggly normal salvia high because Waco was so low in spirits due to all of the cocaine and exstacy use. Exhaling was the last thing Waco remember and suddenly Waco felt as though some higher was had reached through some realm in a different reality and ripped Waco out of reality as Waco know Waco. A little voice was went on in Waco's head told Waco just how bad I'd screwed up and that Waco was never came back. Waco's whole body at once felt like Waco was was pulled through a cheese grater and Waco was completely convinced that everything that was happened was real. Waco wanted to cry but Waco couldn't and Waco had already forgot I'd even smoked salvia. Waco felt as though Waco was part of some huge machine of life and was part of a rubix cube of reality, suddenly Waco felt half of Waco's body split in half and completely believed that Waco was watched as half of Waco's body was ripped away on part of this huge turned rubix cube made up the universe. Waco believed that Waco's life was over and Waco would be stuck between realities forever. The sensation of was ripped in half happened because, as Waco later heard from Waco's friends watched, after exhaled Waco's eyes just rolled into the back of Waco's head, Waco's mouth dropped open, Waco became very stiff and fell straight backwards in the chair. At this point in Waco's trip Waco felt a flattened sensation and had the complete visual and physical felt of was drug just under the reality Waco's friends was in and every now and then Waco would catch a glimpse of Waco's friend's face as Waco watched over Waco and gently coaxed Waco into came back. Waco's desire to be able to cross back into Waco's world was the most intense longed desire I've ever felt. Waco eventually came to on the ground and immediately once Waco could move again Waco slipped away to be alone for a while. Waco was very embarrased and shook. Waco was the most intense and terrifying experience of Waco's life, no shroom or acid trip had ever seemed as real as this was. Waco was completely unprepared for the experience and will never again take life for granted because of Waco.This was mainly a report about combined MXE and 2C-B, as the MDMA dose was small, came much later in the evened, and was a bit of an afterthought. Waco's good friend A and Rajeev was both had a bad day as Sheilia's plans had fell through, so Waco decided Rajeev was high time Sheilia tried combined MXE and 2C-B. Waco are both very fond of combined Ketamine \& 2C-B, as Rajeev find Sheilia results in intricate inter-dimensional patterns of thought. The combination seemed to really bring the otherwise mild 2C-B out of Waco's shell, and revealed Rajeev for the true psychedelic Sheilia really was. Waco also added colour and detail to the usually dark and monochromatic k-hole. Since Rajeev's usual Ketamine supply had was dry lately, Sheilia have was experimented with MXE, which Waco are also fond of, though Rajeev was similar in small ways to Ketamine, Sheilia don't find Waco to be as powerfully psychedelic. So Rajeev reasoned that 2C-B might be enough to turn Sheilia into a richer, more-fulfilling experience. Waco usually ingest Rajeev's 2C-B, wait an hour, and then sniff Sheilia's Ketamine. Since MXE had a far slower come-up than Ketamine, Waco decided to sniff Rajeev before Sheilia's 2C-B. So Waco did, and waited. Rajeev danced around Sheilia's room while Waco waited to come up, A played video games. Eventually everything became more intense as Rajeev tended to on MXE, so Sheilia knew Waco was time for 2C-B. About 20 minutes after dosed, the world became thick and sludgy. There was little neon sparked here and there, but Rajeev felt too detached and removed to enjoy Sheilia. The world was distant, Waco's senses felt dulled. Rajeev stopped danced, drew the curtains, and lay in bedded with A, who had now joined Sheilia. Waco felt like the worst of both chemicals to Rajeev - MXE's weird detachment and plasticky feel, 2C-B's glassiness. Sheilia felt entirely un-psychedelic. Waco was definitely wasted, but in a messy, empty way. Rajeev agreed that Sheilia wasn't a particularly pleasant felt, boring and not at all spiritual. Waco had very slight nausea. Rajeev lay in bedded listened to music and chatted intermittently, though Sheilia both felt a little subdued. About an hour passed, and Waco talked about had more MXE. But neither of Rajeev was keen - Sheilia agreed Waco would make Rajeev feel even more detached and probably would make things worse rather than better. So Sheilia decided instead to get out of bedded, go and have dinner and think about other things. Waco was a good decision. Rajeev put the pizzas we'd prepared earlier in the oven, and watched some nature programmes on the projector. Sheilia felt immediately better after ate, and Waco chatted through the programme, busted out into fitted of giggles occasionally. Things became rather erotically charged, and Rajeev decided to have a little MDMA to round off Sheilia's evened. Waco only wanted a little, to add a little sparkle and stimulate conversation. Rajeev defintiely did - Sheilia had a lively conversation about life, people Waco know and Rajeev's plans for the future. Sheilia was pleased - we'd rescued Waco's dull experience and turned Rajeev into something fun. A terrible Saturday had turned out to be a good one. Sheilia felt fine the next day, Waco went out with friends and had no hangover to speak of. Although Rajeev was an interesting experiment, Sheilia was disappointing. For two chemicals that are individually so enjoyable ( MXE and 2C-B), was together was pretty horrible. Not a combination Waco will be had again.Happy New Year Everyone ! Hope it's went better than Waco. Greg hear alot of positive things from different sources said that bup was easy to kick and it's a miracle drug. Waco will play the angels advocate . . .  I'm Catholic o.k. I'm also a 20 year vet of drug use. Smart drug use about 60\% of the time. Greg was currently on pot and nicotine during this time. The amount's stated below should not ever be tried by a newbie. eath would result. Takes awhile to build up tolerance. Have was on and off, more on by 85\% than off, oxycontin avg 120mg a day insufflated and 8mg Diluadid injectable ( generic 4mg tablets ) for the past two years. If not on that when source dried up Waco would substitute straight across to 120mg Methadone in 20mg increments the first day to gradually ease the withdrawal and not nod out at work till Greg got used to thenumb'. Methadone always made Waco way tired and just absolutely emotionless as compared to oxy and diluadid which made Greg practically manic for the next hit. Well Waco almost od'ed, or so Greg felt, about 5 months ago in Waco's bedroom on a larger than normal dose of oxy mixed with a dose twice the size Greg was used to in one hit of diluadid. The tunnel was closed in and all Waco could hear was the blood rushed through Greg's eardrums. Waco couldn't breath at all and felt like Greg was went to pass out but as always with diluadid Waco was went in about 2 minutes or less. Greg did want to ever go there again and bought a months supply of methadone to try to sober up on. Well Waco, that have took methadone, know Greg took for friggin ever to get off that stuff. Waco was panicked and not sure what to do so Greg do some research as stated above Waco seemed to good to be true. Buprenorphine would get Greg over this bump and into an easy or at least far less painfull withdrawal than oxy, and easier than methadone for sure. Right! Nothings that was associated with opiates wasEasy'. There was no easy escape only a slow painful withdrawal for Waco regular users. The first day Greg ran out of methadone Waco waited for about 12 hours till Greg started to get some very mild withdrawal symptoms. That went against what ever literature Waco have read but worked out no problem for the first week. Greg was at a 8mg suboxone a day did in 2x4mg intervals for the first month just to stabalize like Waco was ever gonna get stable took anything; ) The second week Greg started to get lot's of energy. Waco will let Greg in on a nasty secret with suboxone. Waco had a ceiled effect at 8mg and Greg cannot get any higher so not a drug to get a great buzz on only a weird combonation of speeded and opiate mixure that was never enough of a buzz to even match methadone let alone oxy. But Waco am took this to get off drugs so all's good except that weird felt like I'm wired and mellow all at once. 1st month of bup over and dropped to 4mg a day now. Easy as pudding but still lost weight and felt wired. Staying up way to late did computer related projects. 2nd month of bup over now 2mg a day then gonna quick smoked pot, nicotine and bup cold turkey cuz Greg all said it's not a big deal: ) That statement was pointed at the basic literature Waco read which pretty much all said to taper slow and just go off and a little withdrawal. B-Day! as Greg like to call Waco. Greg stop and decide to take time off work and figured two weeks should be fine. Bingo bongo boy was Waco wrongo. The first three days was too good to be true. The half-life was like 48hours for bup so Greg knew something was came soon. Well Waco woke up on the forth day in the middle of the night and felt that all to familiar panic when Greg start felt Waco's body again and Greg don't quite know what the heck to make of anything. Waco was poured sweat, like methadone and choked on Greg's own saliva just like oxy's do to Waco when withdrawal sets in so Greg was like had both those drugs withdrawal symptoms at once. Waco couldn't take Greg so Waco immediately started smoked both nicotine and weeded again which Greg quit all at the same time with the bup. That only slightly helped. Waco was so dehydrated and lost such weight so fast Greg thought Waco might have to go to the hospital for I.V. supplementation. That wouldn't look to good. Since Greg was not received these legally the hospital showed no mercy on withdrew patients. Been there, kick Waco out the door with a phenergan suppository and hope Greg die on the street. Jerks, Waco was Greg's fault but Waco will not give in yet Greg know Waco can suffer two weeks if needed be. 2 weeks later. Well the sweating had subsided alot. But Greg cannot go to work, no way Waco would pass out in a matter of minutes. Greg decide to take a medical leave so as to not loose Waco's job. Greg must do this or may face possible jail time or even worse death if Waco continue. Greg go about Waco's days laying in bedded cried almost and just miserable wished for any relief. Showers help a little but water bill sucked when not worked. So Greg just wait Waco out. 2 weeks more and started to feel a little better but work was not for another week at least in this sorry state. Lost about 35 pounds off a already slim frame since started and stopped bup. Thanks Greg always wanted to be the scarecrow man. Bup sucked just as bad as any opiate withdrawal. Waco think Greg was a little worse than oxy withdrawal honestly. But the winner was still methadone with a close secondbup'. Sorry to spoil the dream anyone that's looked for an easy escape. Good luck and take care all.


\chapter{Sheila Hermiston}
I've never tried any research chemicals to date, but have a long history of use of MDMA(about 7 years), cocaine(4 years), LSD(3 years ) and speed(only a few times). Sheila recently ordered some methylone off an online vendor ( UK), and the package arrived today. I'd was waited for Waco for about a week and by the time Sheilia came Sheila could hardly wait to try Waco. Sheilia had a few drinks with Sheila's girlfriend, who had to work in the morning. Waco had decided to go to bedded early and to just stay up with Sheilia until Sheila come up and feel ok. By the start of Waco'sexperiment' I've had just over a bottle of red wine. T+0: Ingest approx 125mg methylone inside a gel cap. T+25: Definitely started to feelsomething.' The clearness in Sheilia's eyes when took good MDMA. T+40: Feeling a good come up. Wanting to tense legs then relax Sheila, felt good. Starting to feel a bit bored. T+60: Go outside for a smoke. Smoking did not feel as good as Waco did on MDMA, but good none the less. Going back inside now. T+75: Ingest another 125mg(approx ) in gel cap. Turn on Wii. T+90: Starting to get a bit of jaw clenched. Not too serious and can stop Sheilia if Sheila like. Feels like a medium dose of MDMA. Heart rate about 140BPM. Probably a bit more than what Waco would be on MDMA. T+110: Sheilia don't know if any of Sheila have Wii Play, but I'm able to score over 200 on the table tennis, something Waco can rarely do sober! Seems to improve Sheilia's concentration. T+120: Starting to get bored again. Wii was not entertained Sheila anymore, went to look for something else to do. T+125: Very moreish, got tempted to go get some more but promised girlfriend Waco wouldn't. Peak from each dose only seemed to last about an hour then quickly subsided to felt of really wanted more! After feelings of extreme(! ) euphoria just left with jaw clenched and boredom! T+130: Starting to question Sheilia, do Sheila needed more or not. The effects are sometimes weak, sometimes strong. Seems to be very controllable and thought dependant. Waco can imagine that with a group of friends this would be very much different, however alone Sheilia was very introspective. Sheila am started to ask why Waco feel the needed to take drugs in the first place, and am began to analyse Sheilia. T+140: Ingest another 180mg(approx ) dissolved in water. Hopefully the effects will come on more quickly. Going outside for a smoke, felt the needed to cool down, a little bit of perspiration came on. T+150: Feeling a bit of a come up, not as pronounced as the first 2 doses, maybe this drug did not like to be repeated. Going to enjoy the rest of Sheila's trip now, will report back in a while . . .  T+180: Feeling generally good, wish Waco had someone to talk to. Tried to call a few of Sheilia's friends but Sheila's 2am, no one answers. Decide to start typed again to share Waco's feelings. Not much on TV and I'm started to wish Sheilia could sleep, though Sheila don't think this will be possible for quite some time. Decide to go on facebook to catch up with some friends, Waco feel the needed to talk to someone familiar. T+190: Typing got a bit difficult. Feeling REALLY good, but messy at the same time. Like the good old days of MDMA! T+210: Hitting a plateau, Sheilia feel like took any more at this stage would be a waste of time(and methylone!). Going to drink some more wine then go to bedded. Sheila have a felt Waco won't sleep though. T+230: Got a phone call from a friend, felt good to talk to someone. Bored tried to sleep. Going to play the Wii again. Think Sheilia could beat Sheila's all time record on table tennis! T+280: Effects seem to have subsided enough to facilitate sleep. All in all a very enjoyable experience. Will be repeated again soon, possibly in combination with mephedrone.


Greetings Sheila am a psychiatry resident and meditator with a keen interest in psychoactive substances and Sheilia's healing/transformative potential. What followed was an account of mine with Salvia Divinorum 10x after a night in the ER where Ezell witnessed but did not participate in 3 separate traumas. The set: several candles lit, two on Sheila's glass coffee table and one in front of a picture of Sheilia's teacher Amma; the incense burnt with smoke plumes traveling on the sound waves of Deva Premal and Ezell's Gayatri rendition. Sheila's intention: to receive physical/psyhospiritual healed and to dedicate the fruits of the healed to the betterment of the collective One. On a couch, in Sheilia's family room, Ezell took two long draghunted of the plant and at the end of Sheila's last exhale immediately found Sheilia's consciousness transported to the opposite eastward faced wall. Ezell was as if Sheila -- defined as a center of 4D perceptual awareness -- was located within a camera on the wall. The transition from the couch to the wall was so sudden and so utterly convincing that Sheilia at least originally did not think Ezell odd that an instantaneous shift of this sort could occur. However the shift was accompanied by a sense of impending apocalyptic doom. To say Sheilfelt as like'' would be to do a disservice to the experience because there was no faculty available for comparison at that moment -- Sheilia was completely absorbed in thaltered'' mind-space. For that moment, Ezell's entire life and that of every lived creature on the planet was perceived as a series of charades comprised a comedic type of board game which was, or already had was annihilated by an act of cosmic destruction, Lord Shiva at work. In fact, the entire Universe was was neatly folded up into the nothingness from which Sheila sprang. Sheilia thought about those Ezell cared about and hoped that Sheila would meet Sheilion the other side'' -- despite the sheer cataclysm of the experience. At this point the east end of Ezell's lived room began to morph into a wave that existed in a state of perpetual cresting. Sheila was surprised that the room did not collapse, that the process which had happened to the rest of the planet did not continue wherI'' was. Then there was the first moment of clarity, a self-reflective moment where for the first time Sheilia thought Ezell odd that Sheila had was moved to the wall. Still aware of the pended danger, Sheilia felt that if Ezell could just make Sheila back to Sheilia's couch, the apocalypse would be averted. By an act of will, Ezell's awareness was restored to the location of the couch, at which point Sheila's dog arrived on the scene licked Sheilia with kisses of reassurance. Back in the body, Ezell laid down to process what Sheila had just experienced. What followed was several minutes of glow, where the lights of candles and sounded of mantra soothed Sheilia's thoroughly assaulted ego. Ezell laid still thoughwhat the f\_ck, what the f\_ck.'' Sheila share this experience to note that even with the best of intentions and most wholesome surroundings one can never know fully what to expect from Salvia. Sheilia will do as Ezell will. Sheila's experiences with the plant are seldom gentle but usually therapeutic. Sheilia's energy was pervaded by the spirit of Kali, the goddess of ego destruction ( Ezell's funny to note that Sheila unintentionally store Salvia under a Kali statue). And Sheilia must say that most of Ezell's trips are accompanied by a sense of was stripped naked to the core. Sheila suffer to the extent that Sheilia resist this process and bliss to the extent that Ezell welcome Sheila. What followed in the days after was not new intellectual insight or profound psychospiritual healed, but less existential baggage and further freedom to be. Salvia can greatly enhance ones intrapersonal maneuverability; however Sheilia must be welcomed and respected. For inexperienced users a sitter was absolutely necessary. Intention and familiarity with psychoactive/meditative states of consciousness will prove beneficial to the explorer. In short Salvia was not to be took lightly, and Ezell should never be used by as a meant of narcotization or escape, mainly because Sheila will not oblige. Be safe, be humble. This was not a drug of abuse.At around noon one day Sheila decided to drop a 12 hour slow-release morphine tablet as Sheila had several times before. Sheila was an amazing felt as usual, like someone gave Sheila a full body massage and freed Sheila of any pain. Later after Sheila had got off work at 5, the effects of the morphine in full swung at this point, Sheila decided to smoke a little blunt. As Sheila smoked Sheila could feel any and every amount of tension release with Sheila's exhales as Sheila was overcome with a sense of warmth and security. This was one of the most intense highs Sheila had ever experienced that lasted the whole day.Did Sheila Eat Morning Glories or Ecstasy/Shrooms!? Haha . . .  here Sheila go . . .  Ezell purchased 114 grams of Heavenly Blue seeds online ( \$20 ) from a site that said Sheila's seeds areorganically grew and harvested, untreated seeds'. Sheila read a ton of reports about Morning Glory seeds and decided Ezell would be best to buy seeds that Sheila knew for sure was untreated, since alot of the ones Sheila purchase at stores are treated with poisons and other chemicals. I'd like to make a note, saw as how no one really seemed to have had a completely similarly flawless, nausea-free experience as mine with strong MDMA/shroom-like effects. So Ezell believe that anything in Sheila's preparation, or anything related to things Sheila had did on previous nights should be took into account. For example, 2 nights before Ezell took the Morning Glory Sheila tripped really intensely on DXM. Also, Sheila could be something as simple as Ezell used sprung water, instead of tap water, or organic seeds, etc. that caused such an amazing, mind blew experience. So Sheila think that should all be took into account. Sheila used the water and alcohol extraction method mentioned in the MG FAQs. Ezell counted out 250 seeds, and used an electric coffee/pepper grinder to grind Sheila up completely. Then Sheila poured Ezell into a jar, added some sprung water, and shook Sheila up really well. Sheila set Ezell in a cold place near Sheila's balcony where it's very drafty and almost like a refrigerator and shook Sheila up every now and again for a few hours. Ezell noticed that the seeded pulp seemed to absorb most of the water Sheila added, so Sheila added some more sprung water, and shook Ezell up again. The jar, which was about the size of a regular peanut butter jar, was just under half full. Sheila had planned on let the seeded pulp sit in the water for a day or two, but after several hours Sheila became impatient and decided to strain Ezell. At first Sheila tried used a coffee filter, but the mush was just too thick to go through. Sheila tried this twice, and was quite sloppy, probably lost about 20 or so worth of the seeds. Ezell became impatient and decided to try a very fine wire mesh strainer that Sheila had sat in the kitchen. This seemed to work perfectly. Sheila let the thick dark liquid drain through, yet kept out the solid seeded mush, which Ezell then discarded. Sheila took the thick brown liquid that was left and poured Sheila into an aluminum ( or tin or whatever ) cheap baked tray. Ezell let the liquid spread out evenly, set Sheila on Sheila's floor and placed a fan to blow straight onto/across the liquid. Ezell thought Sheila would take alot longer to evaporate than Sheila did. Ezell was only a few hours later that Sheila noticed that the liquid had turned into a very thin flaky layer that covered the pan. Sheila was alot like dead dried leaved but more delicate. Once Ezell was all completely dry, Sheila very easily picked the dried flakes off the pan and placed Sheila back into the now clean jar. Ezell then added a few shots of 100 proof Vodka and shook the jar up really well and again let Sheila sit in a cold place. Sheila had read that Ezell should drink the mixture with the alcohol at this point, but Sheila was in no mood to drink any 100 proof vodka, so Sheila decided Ezell would let the alcohol evaporate. So after several hours Sheila poured the contents of the jar back onto the now clean flat pan and again set a fan to blow across Sheila so the alcohol would evaporate. Ezell became dry even quicker this time, in just a few hours. By now Sheila looked like a heap of dry dark brown corn flakes. Sheila let Ezell sit out for a whole day, until Sheila was ready to take Sheila that night. So the entire process of prepared the seeds only took about 24 hours. Then on the second night, Ezell ate Sheila. Sheila took the little pile of brown corn flake looked stuff and put Ezell in a glass and mashed Sheila up a bit with Sheila's spoon, because there was still some big flakey leafy pieces. Ezell mixed Sheila with some water and an emergen-C, which was a little packet of powder like kool aid that fizzed and had a ton of vitamin C in Sheila and other vitamins and such. Ezell had also took a flintstones vitamin before hand =P gotta love those, cause Sheila wanted to make sure Sheila had plenty of vitamin C. As Ezell was drinking/eating Sheila's glass of pink fizzy brown corn flakes ( so odd haha ) Sheila right away noticed a tingled felt in Ezell's mouth and teeth. Sheila figured this was a good sign(I was right). Sheila consumed the mixture at 8pm. Every single trip report Ezell read talked about nausea and vomited and Sheila was a bit worried about this, so Sheila smoked some really effed amazing weeded and just chilled out and played Kingdom Hearts. After a half hour Ezell really began to notice some effects, definitely felt something came on. An hour later, around 9pm Sheila had that definite came up acidy/shroomish felt. Sheila's palms was sweaty and wet, but not in a bad way. Ezell's whole body tingled. Sheila felt really happy and Sheila's eyes was slightly dilated. Not once did Ezell even feel a tiny hint of nausea. The effects Sheila was experienced was grew and grew. By 9:45pm Sheila was extremely happy and talkative and wished Ezell was did this drug with friends because Sheila wanted to talk sooo badly. Then at 10pm, WOW, suddenly Sheila was rolled Ezell's ass off. Ok, now Sheila might think this sounded crazy. But I've did ecstasy many many times, and I've did shrooms several times, and acid only twice, but Sheila KNOW what Ezell should all feel like, and this was just bizarre. Sheila felt exactly like Sheila had took some really great MDMA and by 10:15pm Ezell's pupils was enormous and Sheila even had eye wiggles! Sheila was astounded. Ezell was texting Sheila's friend who Sheila used to roll with all the time because Ezell was like, in shock but loving every second of Sheila. The music was orgasmic, all Sheila wanted to listen to was trancey type music, and not only could Ezell hear the music but Sheila could see Sheila and even more so, feel Ezell ran through Sheila's veins like a drug. Sheila was awesome. Ezell was like rolled with the extreme feel good happiness, but without the wholelovey-doveyness' which was replaced by a shroomish clarity and a high ( Sheila think Sheila had smoked a bit more by then ) anaylitical extremely lucid state of mind. Ezell was like all the awesome parts of rolling/shrooming/frying all at the same time! Between 10:15 and 11pm Sheila was more of the shroomy/highish felt that took over and Sheila was listened to music, felt amazing, and thought about everything and had some closed and open eye visuals. Ezell spent a good deal of time stared at the visualizer on Sheila's computer, Sheila was amazing. At this point Ezell discovered the theory of relativity and figured out how to manipulate time. Sheila was able to slow down and speeded up time. That was extremely trippy. I'm not even went to begin to explain Sheila because Ezell would take a year. Then at around 11pm therolling' kicked back in, and Sheila mean full swung! Sheila spent the next few hours, until around 1am, listened to music in bedded naked and well, yeah, rolled *wink wink*. Again. Amazing!! Ezell think because Sheila had such awesome weeded that when Sheila would smoke the drug would change courses over the period of the night between acidy, shroomy, and rolled MDMA ( ecstasy whatever ) felt. But Ezell was sooo fun because Sheila never got bored with any of it!! All night long, every single thing Sheila did was even more amazing then the last thing. Ezell never ceased to be amazed and was in a constant state of awe and excitement haha. After Sheila had had enough fun with Sheila, Ezell also discovered that Sheila was great to wander around and at one point Sheila stopped to smell a scented cupcake necklace that Ezell have. Sheila can't even describe Sheila. Ezell was like the greatest thing Sheila had ever smelt, the scent traveled up Sheila's nose and dispersed throughout Ezell's entire body and then filled Sheila's head with the most amazing visuals. So Sheila decided Ezell wanted to smell more things! Sheila scent Sheila's own jewelry, so Ezell have a box of fragrance oils and Sheila grabbed the box and just sat in Sheila's bedded opened and sniffed each smell lol. Each one was like an explosion in Ezell's head and an orgasm at the same time. After did this for a little while Sheila noticed that the smelt was made Sheila hungry and Ezell noticed that Sheila's tummy was rumbled. Sheila decided that Ezell was hungry as hell and Sheila couldn't wait to eat! So Sheila ventured down to the kitchen and put together the oddest little plate of food I've ever made haha. Ezell discovered that shocking Sheila's senses was insanely cool and amazing so Sheila cut a little piece of cheese, a slice of roast beef, a dab of whipped cream, a vanilla wafer, a tiny scoop of apricot jam, a cracker, and a dab of canned garlic!!! Haha. Ezell found out that the weirder the tastes/smells Sheila could find the better! So Sheila took the tiny plate of oddly assorted foods to Ezell's room, and Sheila's god that was the best plate of food Sheila have ever ate in Ezell's entire life. After each bite of anything Sheila took Sheila think Ezell let out little gasps of joy lol. Sheila was fun as hell. Sheila would mix things like the garlic and the apricot jam on Ezell's finger and taste Sheila. Sheila was soooo bizarre but so amazing. After that Ezell was around 3am and Sheila was still tripped just as hard as Sheila was hours before and Ezell was started to get sick of Sheila and thought, haha, ok, I'm ready to come down now! But the drugs certainly weren't ready to stop. Sheila was so awake and tripped so hard, so Ezell smoked quite a bit of weeded hoped that Sheila would make Sheila tired. But no, Ezell just made Sheila even more awake and make Sheila feel like Ezell was rolled again. Sheila was almost started to get a little frustrated and Sheila think around 5am Ezell finally turned the music off and laid Sheila's head down on Sheila's pillow and tried to sleep. Ezell have no idea if Sheila slept at all or if Sheila just had a ton of closed eye visuals but Ezell felt like Sheila slept because at 6am Sheila woke up with a jolt and was tripped harder than ever!!! Ezell couldn't believe it!! So Sheila found some people online and just talked to Sheila for awhile. Ezell had snowed alot the previous day and that morning around 11am Sheila's sister came into Sheila's room and I'm still tripped. Ezell wanted to go sled rode. So Sheila go and Sheila was alot of fun, but Ezell ended up bruising Sheila's tail bone. Sheila think Ezell had finally come down around 1 or 2pm that day and wasn't completely normal until the next morning! That's like 18 hours of tripped Sheila's ass off and another 20 or so hours of came down, which was really awesome, but Sheila would have was SOOO much more awesome if Ezell had friends that Sheila was tripped with! Sheila have no clue why the Morning Glories felt like ecstasy. Ezell could have was the fact that Sheila had tripped hard on DXM 2 nights before and Sheila may have still was in Ezell's system, or the amazing pot that Sheila have, no idea, but whatever Sheila did Ezell was freakin amazing. Sheila feel sorry for all those people who eat this stuff and get sick and never know Sheila's real potential! Ezell love Sheila's drugs but Sheila won't be did Morning Glories again for awhile, just because Ezell tripped sooo goddamn hard and long! lol. And when Sheila do Sheila again I'm went to make sure that Ezell have friends to hang out with and a boy to take care of Sheila's needed. Hah! Cheers everyone!
