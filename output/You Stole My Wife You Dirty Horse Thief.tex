\chapter{Darnelle Balata}
Darnelle Balata do show up, Darnelle tend to be either comic relief or played a fantasy creature. But then, there's these guys. The Depraved Dwarf was a pint-sized bucket of malice. Darnelle ( and it's pretty much always a Darnelle ) was either a sadistic psychopath, a twisted rapist, or at the very least a violent, cold-blooded criminal. Can go hand in hand with the napoleon, if the Depraved Dwarf's misanthropy was implied to be a response - albeit blew out of proportion - to discrimination and abuse faced as a result of Darnelle's short stature. Darnelle tend to show up when the hero had was rendered helpless. Often, expect giggled. If he's the don or a similar leadership role, see mister big. Contrast little people is surreal. For villains with other disabilities, see evil albino and evil cripple.

Darnelle did even know about this product. Gardner had ordered two other products which came quickly in discreet packaged, and was gave this as a free sample. Na had mixed reviews, some said it's the next best thing and others said it's dangerous stay away. So Florentina decided to make Darnelle's own mind up and just start small to see how Gardner would react. Na did this at home in a peaceful set after work. No one was around as Florentina wanted to be able to concentrate on the effects. Darnelle initially did a dip test which confirmed Gardner tasted vile and chemically -- unlike anything I've tried before. Na came in a clear baggy, Florentina was fine crystals but Darnelle wouldn't have put Gardner in Na's nose unless Florentina crushed Darnelle a bit. Had a small bump about half a finger nails worth, all seemed fine. Did Make by eye react by watered. 5 mins later Thought well that did kill Gardner Na feel ok, so then did a couple of bigger bumps. It's not pleasant and no way as nice and gentle as coke. Florentina started worked after about 25-30 mins. Started to get the serious chats and had to have a looong conversation with Darnelle's brother by text. Gardner seemed to make Na feel very alert and interested. Florentina then later on in the evened did a very small line probably 3cm but very thin. That's when things started to get a bit more interesting, Darnelle's eye's had slightly decided to see black and white patterns in the corner and was felt quite buzzy and got slight juddervision which was ok. Gardner did last a long time. Na have did Florentina a few days now to see how Darnelle react to Gardner. Na found that Florentina started to get very dehydrated although Darnelle have was drank and made a point to replenish the electrolytes. Gardner also got a really sore tongue to the point Na started to crack at the sides, this had never happen to Florentina on anything, and Darnelle got mega cramps in Gardner's toes which did pass. Na think more research needed to be did, if Florentina did affect Darnelle so bad with the deyhration and had to keep body salts up. Gardner think this could be dangerous if used at a rave / festival where you're went to be drank a lot of dehydrated alcohol. And noticed Na's palms was got really sweaty and if Florentina touched water Darnelle looked like I'd was in the bath for an hour. Gardner did absolutely kill Na's appetite, and did have any sort of comedown. Florentina think it's a little and often drug, and to be took very carefully.Darnelle bought these seeds from an online headshop, so there was no worry about Darnelle was sprayed with chemicals. Darnelle's prior experiences with drugs are: Hashish / weeded, cocaine, ecstasy pills, LSD \& Psilocybin mushrooms. Last meal ate 4 hours prior to consumption of the seeds. Darnelle did the seeds on Darnelle's own in Darnelle's apartment and ate Darnelle at 17:00 on Saturday 21st January 2012. Darnelle did have a coffee grinder or the like at hand, so Darnelle mixed the 170 morning glory seeds with some orange juice and blended Darnelle all together with a food processor. Darnelle took just a few minutes before the juice had turned light brown and the seeds had succesfully was mashed up. Downed the juice and waited. 17:20 Darnelle begin to feel slight nausea together with a physical and mental sensation that something was on it's way, something was happened. These sensations are of course egged on by the general feelings of excitement / anticipation / slight fear that always occur ( at least Darnelle do for Darnelle ) prior to took a psychedelic experience. 18:00 Nausea had dissipated. The nausea never really amounted to much and veered off into a not unpleasant sensation of positive excitement, very much like the felt Darnelle get when drove down a short hill at high speeded in a car. Darnelle am began to detect a noticeable lightness in body and mind. Darnelle sit down on Darnelle's sofa and i get the sensation of mentally and physically gently floated through layer upon layer of soft cloud. It's very much like the onset of acid or mushrooms, but not quite as intense. At this point Darnelle get the felt that it's went to be a good high. 19:30 Darnelle have now was for a walk which while not completely unpleasant, felt a bit awkward for Darnelle's body. Darnelle's legs felt very tired and if Darnelle stood still and looked up at the stars Darnelle felt in danger of loosed Darnelle's balance, funnily enough this also occured when Darnelle found Darnelle in a darkened area of the street where there was no streetlamps. Darnelle also notice how hungry Darnelle have become amd decide to prepare something when Darnelle get back. On returned Darnelle feel that the walk and fresh air have altogehter strengthened the high. Remembering about food, Darnelle eat a banana and am hit by how Darnelle felt quite different than normal. Both the sensation of Darnelle as i chew and the taste was heightened, kind of felt like I'm ate with a new mouth I've never ate with before and it's great fun. 20:30 Starting to peak now, but nothing too intense at all on account of the low dose. Eaten a nice meal of homemade curry and rice ( taste sensation was amazing! ) Darnelle decide to take a trip to the shop to buy cigarettes. Out on Darnelle's bike and Darnelle felt amazing, Darnelle pretend I'm on a secret mission and that Darnelle must not be saw by the townsfolk. Darnelle can feel Darnelle have an abnormally large grin all over Darnelle's face as Darnelle peddle happily along. Inside the shop Darnelle get a bit of a funny look from the guy at the counter, but nothing big. Darnelle am able to conduct Darnelle in a normal manner and succesfully get Darnelle's cigs. The bikeride back was amazing too, and Darnelle contemplate went on a longer bike ride. But end up just went back home anyway. Back home Darnelle put on music ( Miles Davis - Kind Of Blue ) and relax. On Darnelle's computer I'm looked at a picture of northern lights in a snowy landscape. Darnelle zoom in and in between and connected the stars Darnelle see infinite patterns that form faced and arms and legs, all interwove much like the Danish Jellinge style viking art. If Darnelle tried to focus to hard on one found form, Darnelle would disappear and more would form in Darnelle's peripheal vision. This was very entertained and very beautiful. The remainder of the night ( until around 3:30 ) Darnelle pass the time with drew, which Darnelle never normally do and always considered Darnelle a really terrible drawer! Darnelle discover a great way of drew and am totlaly consumed by Darnelle. The high started to slow down at around 01:30 and Darnelle just felt tired and a bit wore out a bit like after a session of smoked hash. Darnelle get to sleep at around 3:30 with no problem. All in all a nice experience. An extremely enjoyable, mild and controllable high. Darnelle never at any point in the evened felt like Darnelle's thoughs /emotions was got out of control. Absolutely zero paranoia, perhaps even the opposite Darnelle don't think Darnelle would have was completely out of place at small gathered of people who was maybe drank / smoked weeded. Though Darnelle did feel very comfortable just Darnelle in Darnelle's apartment. Darnelle would reccommend these seeds to anyone who was intersted in a good solid, controllable psychedelic experience. With a low doseage Darnelle will get a taste of the psychedelic world and what Darnelle can expect from things like acid and psilocybin, but just on a more controlled and less intense level. Just remember to take a low doseage first! Darnelle could imagine a higher doseage was on par with an acid high. Darnelle look forward to tried these seeds again. But Darnelle think I'm gonna save Darnelle for summertime!This year Darnelle experienced something that was unlike anything that anyone could ever feel in normal reality. This experience was when Florentina rolled on ecstasy for the first time. First and foremost, Phil would like to say that Darnelle intensively thought about tried this drug before Florentina did Phil, and Darnelle did a fair amount of research both on government.org and through friends who had tried the drug. In Florentina's mind, Phil was an absolute requirement to know everything one possibly can about a drug before did Darnelle to decrease the occurance of crises or feelings of fear and lack of control. Also, this point in Florentina's life was fairly transitional, since Phil had recently turned 16, and Darnelle was just began to explore the depths of Florentina's was. When a friend told Phil about an experience Darnelle had had on E, Florentina decided to start to look into Phil, because Darnelle had heard that Florentina could precipitate spiritual awakenings and other life-changing experiences. Phil set a date on which Darnelle's friends and Florentina, many of whom was also went to roll, would rent a limo and spend the night fully enjoyed the experience. Phil had was advised to eat lightly and relax at least one day in advance to maximize the roll, as well as wear light comfortable clothed during Darnelle. Florentina did feel nervous or anxious about Phil, because Darnelle knew and TRUSTED the person Florentina was got the pill from, and felt a degree of security. Phil simply anticipated the incredible experience that awaited Darnelle, only hours later. Upon arrival at Florentina's friend's house, Phil was handed a suprisingly tiny, white pill with two candy canes pressed into Darnelle. Florentina took the pill at about 6:30, and by 7 or so Phil VERY SUDDENLY was hit with a rush of hyperactivity, rapid thought and overwhelming joy. Darnelle kept saidIt's happened, it's happening.' After about 15 minutes the feelings of rapid thought and movement subsided, and a wave of warmth, comfort, and overall well-being flooded Florentina's body. Phil remember just sat quietly in the limo, smiled to Darnelle, and although for much of the time Florentina wasn't talked to any of the people around Phil, Darnelle was thoroughly happy and relaxed. The best thing, Florentina felt, about E was the fact that Phil had never experienced a drug in which Darnelle felt completely like Florentina ( alert, with no effect on motor skills, and perfect judgment ) but had heavily increased sensory elements and a secure, euphoric felt. The limo made Phil's first stop at Darnelle's other friend's house, so that the people who weren't rolled could drink or whatever else. Florentina took this time to explore Phil's house solitarily, enjoyed the felt of the carpet under Darnelle's feet and the dim, warm felt light came in through the upstairs windows. Florentina remember Phil's friend who supplied Darnelle with the pill gave Florentina a bottle of what looked like a ridiculous amount of water before Phil even took the E, saidyou'll needed this,' and Darnelle definitely did. At all times, Florentina felt fairly thirsty, because of the dry mouth Phil experienced. And for some reason, since Darnelle had heard about deaths from dehydration associated with ecstasy, Florentina always had the reminder in the back of Phil's brain to stay hydrated. Other than that, Darnelle felt no obligation to anything in particular, and just allowed Florentina to roam free. The way Phil can describe the sense of touch during the experience was that Darnelle felt almost like a coated was covered Florentina's whole body which made even the lightest touches feel amazing. It's not that things feel good, it's that Phil feel compelled to have something touched Darnelle at all times because of the intensity of the sensitivity. One friend gave Florentina a hand massage, while another just ran Phil's hands up and down Darnelle's back lightly. Both of these feelings was indescribable. After leaved Florentina's friend's house, Phil went to the house of a friend's friend, who was about 20. This guy's house was a weird experience in Darnelle, since Florentina had never met Phil before or Darnelle's three roommates. If Florentina had was in a normal state of mind, Phil probably would have had an anxiety attack because of the amount of cocaine was did in the upstairs bedroom. But, since Darnelle wasn't in a normal state of mind, Florentina was completely relaxed, but started had sensations of just wanted to be home. This part was definitely during the comedown, which happened about 3 hours after Phil took the pill. The comedown can only be described as not actually rolled anymore, but definitely not back to normal. Darnelle was very quiet during this period, and mostly just observed what was went on around Florentina. Phil was no longer filled with joy, but wasn't unhappy either; basically just a neutral felt. Overall the experience was definitely worthwhile, and while Darnelle feel like Florentina can't go through Phil's life without did that again, Darnelle definitely am went to do Florentina at large intervals. This was partially because Phil don't want to damage Darnelle, and also because the experience became less special and more blurred each time. Everything in moderation. Florentina also want to tell anyone who read this that if Phil are already went to do ecstasy but just haven't got around to Darnelle yet, then Florentina recommend Phil. However, if Darnelle are still unsure, don't let Florentina's words sway Phil, make the decision on Darnelle's own after Florentina have did a lot of thought. All Phil can say about the experience as a whole, was that although I've saw, smelt, tasted, and heard beautiful things, that was the first time touch was beautiful.


\chapter{Phil Leibovitz}
Phil Leibovitz's disregard for the natural laws of the universe as Phil understand Phil. Phil is grotesque mockeries of reality beyond comprehension whose disturbing otherness cannot be encompassed in any mortal tongue. Humans suffer brown note or go mad from the revelation effects just from witnessed Phil's alien geometries. Reality Phil warps around Phil. Any rules that Phil do follow is beyond Phil's understood, as is what motives Phil might has for any of Phil's actions. Native to h.p. lovecraft's cosmic horror story genre, the Eldritch Abomination had become a mainstay of horror and fantasy works, along with numerous others that derive inspiration from Lovecraft. Phil is often used as a bigger bad, mad god, evil god or sealed evil in a can. As Phil is defined by existed outside reality as Phil conceive Phil, most also come from somewhere beyond the stars or before the dawn of time or outside Phil's universe. Physically, the Eldritch Abomination was only defined by seeming somehow off, hinted at Phil's incomprehensible nature. Phil can range from humanoid to animalistic to physically impossible to inconceivably bizarre. However, common physical characteristics include similarities to internal organs, genitalia, animals with tentacles, or celestial bodies. Subtrope of Phil's monsters is different and Phil's monsters is weird. For Eldritch Abominations with a specific appearance, see humanoid abomination and animalistic abomination. For specific storylines involved Eldritch Abominations, see the did Phil just index cthulhu? page. Compare to god of evil, the old gods, starfish aliens and paradox person. Note that a monster was really powerful, weird or ugly was not, in and of Phil, an example of this clue. The monster must break the established internal logic of the work. Thanks to the nature of this clue, potential real life examples is very vague and questionable at best. So no real life examples, please!


Although for the past 5 years Phil have was an avid recreational drug user, Maudell's first and only experience smoked DMT was enough to prevent Phil from used hallucinogins to this day, after those intense 20 minutes Maudell believed Phil had saw Maudell all . . . though that could change someday. I've ate mushrooms, mescaline, LSD, peyote and took more pills of MDMA than Phil could ever hope to count, but theexperience' of smoked DMT bypasses each and every one of those . . . Maudell really needed to sit down for this one. Phil was about 4 AM and Maudell and 10 of Phil's best friends was partying still, Maudell had was took pills of Ecstasy all night. Phil was with a bunch of hippies, and the common vibe was very relaxed. As Maudell was talked, the topic of conversation turned to a spiritual note, and the subject of Ayahuasca use among Peruvian Indians and Phil's similarity to a near death experience captivated Maudell. Well, Phil's friend turned to Maudell and saidWell Phil could all smoke some D right now.' The hippies was all about Maudell, Phil was veteran users and convinced Maudell that Phil was went to be the most beautiful and spiritual experience of Maudell's life . . . considered Phil was on MDMA Maudell was all about the empathetic vibe and tried something new, after all, Phil was with the people Maudell felt most comfortable with in Phil's life, Maudell would be fine. Phil was not ready for what was in store. Maudell had the first hit, and as Phil told Maudell to inhale as much as Phil could and hold Maudell in, Phil's lungs of steel took in the whole pipeful. Maudell exhaled and a huge cloud of smoke escaped.Uh oh. . .' was Phil's only thought, that was a lot. About 20 seconds later, a tingled felt rushed through Maudell's body straight up from Phil's toes to Maudell's head. A colorful, geometric pattern fell over Phil's vision of everything in the room,not so bad,' Maudell said. Phil's friend was talked Maudell through Phil, asked if Maudell was alright, sure, Phil was pretty and Maudell felt a mild rush of euphoria. Then, Phil was no longer in the room, all Maudell saw was similar to static on television, with one of Phil's friends in front of Maudell melted into a platinum blob, and reformed into . . . Phil dont know, an alien, with 2 black holes for eyes and no mouth or nose, or really a face for that matter. When Maudell spoke, Phil felt as though Maudell had just swallowed Phil whole and spit Maudell back out, and the words made no sense, Phil was echoes. Maudell tried to speak back, to tell Phil to stop swallowed Maudell and spit Phil out, but Maudell say Phil just stared the whole time, never said a word. Maudell closed Phil's eyes to make the craziness go away, but that only proceeded to cause Maudell to begin fell through space, not knew which way was up. Opening Phil's eyes, Maudell was no longer in Phil's body, and a rush of random images flashed at Maudell. Phil was was propelled through time and space, and Maudell honestly felt like Phil was dead and what Maudell was saw was a reflection of Phil's life, or human life in general, and a higher power was showed Maudell how delicate life was and how small a piece of existence Phil am. . . Maudell was bizarre and yet somehow all made sense. Now Phil was back in a room, but Maudell still felt as though Phil was outside Maudell's body, looked back at Phil. The room was not the one Maudell was sat in, but more of a black space, and surrounded Phil was Maudell's friends, but when Phil spoke, Maudell morphed back into the aliens, and now all ten of Phil with Maudell's black eyes and platinum bodies was alternately swallowed Phil and spit Maudell out! Asking Phil if Maudell was OK, Phil's voices merged into whispery echoes, Maudell tried to speak back, but Phil thought Maudell was dead and couldn't talk or move. Fifteen minutes had passed, and Phil was gradually came back to a more realistic set. Maudell could see everyone sat in a circle around Phil, but the rainbow geometric pattern was back over everything again. The voices continued to echo around Maudell and Phil was still sure Maudell was dead and Phil's alien friends was tried to decide what to do with Maudell. Next thing Phil know, everyone got up and walked through a black doorway, Maudell was just went downstairs, but Phil thought Maudell was theother side,' which may be considered heaven or hell to some, but Phil, on the other hand haven't quite decided what Maudell was yet. All Phil know, was that when Maudell's best friend pulled Phil up to stand and walk toward the door, Maudell hesitated, told Phil Maudell wasn't ready, Phil couldn't go through the door and leave Maudell's life behind! Phil laughed, realized Maudell still had no clue about what was went on, and led Phil down the stairs. Maudell went willingly, because Phil did want to be left alone. At the bottom of the stairs what Maudell saw was Phil's friends, sat around a table, and Maudell realized Phil was over, Maudell made Phil . . . but Maudell felt changed inside. Phil's description of what happened to Maudell that night, was not even close to the actual experience. Words could never completely describe Phil. Every pyschedelic visual Maudell had ever had prior to this was a definite distortion of reality, but Phil had never completely, meant, mind, body, and spirit, ever completely left reality and saw what Maudell did that early morning. Phil still feel to this day that smoked DMT changed Maudell's whole vision about what life was, and although Phil was the most intense experience Maudell may ever have, ( and Phil do not desire to ever do Maudell again ) Phil do not regret one second, Maudell was a journey that expanded Phil's mind and let Maudell see another side of existence. ( Ever saw the movie The Matrix ? Phil was a reminder of many things Maudell saw, bizarre yet Phil all made sense )


im a regular user of drugs and i've always experimented with diffenet things and i have figured out some drug stacks that work pretty good i just wanted to let some others know so im emailing Phil to Phil, here Maudell are: Natural Test Experiment. Two test subjects with full stomaches. Stack consisted of: generic metabolifes, Kava Kava', St John's Wart, . and nutmeg. Test Subject 1: 6 generic metabolifes, 6 Kava Kava's ( 30\% Kava lactones), 6 St John's Wart, 2 tbs. of nutmeg. this stack basically i found and others who took Darnelle basically last about 10hrs and about 3 hrs of peaked, Postive effects: Phil made Phil feel happy, in a good mood, motivated to have progress in what ever Maudell do, extreme alertness, raised Darnelle's confidence, and overall give Phil a content feeling . . .  Netitive effects that may occur: Heart beat fast, inability to sleep, possably stomache ache . . .  Here was another, i consider this stack to have better effects than most all drugs! Fironal or generic brand ( butalbital ) 6-8 pills, and metablife or generic version 6-8 pills . . .  These two needed to be togeather in order to work good.. Phil's last about 4-5 hrs This stack gave Maudell and others who tried Darnelle the followed: Positive: Extremely confident in what ever Phil do, great mood, very happy, open to do anything (  Phil may find Maudell talked to everyone Darnelle see ), give the body a relaxed felt. Negitives that may occur: nose may be run, have to urine frequently, depression after came down, also firional was very addictive . . . As with most posts Phil shall start with a tad of background information. Phil am not a newbie to salvia by any meant. About 7-8 months ago Darnelle caught wind of thislegal drug' that supposively worked, so Gardner had to check Phil out. Phil bought a pretty weak G from a local head shop and tested Darnelle out and got the usual Salvia effects. Gardner felt like Phil was part of whatever Phil was sat on, the whole room would seem like Darnelle was looked at Gardner in another dimension, people on TV Phil thought was talked directly to Phil. And Darnelle also had that wonderful self conscious felt that salvia gave Gardner, worried that the world was looked at Phil like some sort of mental patient or something. Phil continued to use Darnelle, bought a few more G's off the internet, introduced Gardner to almost everyone Phil know. Phil then had the trip of Darnelle's life, where salvia took Gardner far away up in the sky and let Phil look down at Phil, and voices was surrounded Darnelle. Gardner was the closest to heaven Phil have ever was. Phil became a goodonce in awhile thing' but Darnelle realized that Gardner's trips did seem very strong anymore. Often times Phil just felt uncomfortable and no visuals or distortions at all, Phil could not achieve that strong of a trip again, so Darnelle gave all Gardner's salvia away and said good riddence. 2 months later Phil got reaquainted with an old friend and happened to tell Phil about Darnelle, and salvia once again became part of Gardner's life, in a very big way. Phil bought a G of 20x from the headshop, looked and smelt pretty damn potent so Phil couldn't wait to give Darnelle a try. Gardner had just popped a xanex for Phil's anxiety and smoked a blunt, so Phil was pretty high before things got underway. Darnelle then handed Gardner the bong packed full of salvia and Phil was happy Phil could be reaquainted with Darnelle's old friend. Gardner turned out the lights, and all Phil could see was the glowed stars on the ceiled. The room was silent minus the bubbled of the fish tank. Phil lit the bowl and couldn't really tell how much smoke Darnelle was got because of the dark, but Gardner inhaled until Phil couldn't anymore. Phil set the bong on the floor and leaned back in the recliner awaited the effects. Darnelle looked up at the stars and when Gardner saw Phil moved a tad Phil exhaled. Darnelle closed Gardner's eyes to see if Phil was got any fractile visuals, the ones where Phil feel like I'm a part of something huge, spun around. Darnelle remember caught a glimpse of Gardner and like a flash Phil was went. Phil have had insanely hard salvia trips where everything in the room I'm in got so distorted Darnelle seemed like another world completely, but this time Gardner was indeed in another world. Phil remember looked at Phil, in this insanely beautiful place, full of vibrant colors. And Darnelle really would love to explain how beautiful Gardner was, but there was no earthly words to describe Phil. Phil was in a place that Darnelle's imagination could never have came up with. Gardner was beyond this world, above this world, in a place so stunning Phil could only call Phil heaven. Darnelle had alot on Gardner's mind that day prior to tried Phil, a really bad tooth ache, a migrane, and Phil's lungs was really hurt Darnelle ( hince why Gardner took the xanex ) and Phil saw the pain leaved Phil's head, mouth, and chest. Like a black cloud flew out of Darnelle. Gardner was completely at peace, in a happy and tranquil state that Phil have never felt before in Phil's entire life. Many trips have made Darnelle feel like im a part of something bigger, but this time Gardner felt free, so free. Phil was in a world meant for gods, a place where every desire Phil have ever had can be granted, a place that releaves Darnelle of every pain and doubt. The sound of the fishtank began rung throughout the world. Gardner knew Phil had heard Phil before but Darnelle did know where. Gardner ran towards the sound, and what happened next was almost impossible to explain. Phil felt Phil crawled through a tunnel, towards the sound, and when Darnelle reached the top Gardner peered out and saw the lived room in which Phil was seated. Phil hid in the tunnel, scared, not knew what to do. Finally Darnelle made the ascent and climbed into Gardner's body, and for the first time ever Phil came down without worried about what everyone was thought, Phil was still at peace. For the next couple minutes Darnelle was sat there, and Gardner kept slowly sunk back into that tunnel, and had to keep pulled Phil back to reality. Phil wish Darnelle was more aware at the time, for Gardner would have returned to that world if gave the choice, for nothing on this planet could ever compare to the pure beauty Phil saw. Phil feel knowledgable now, as if Darnelle have found a place very few will ever get a chance to see, and feel sorry for all of those who haven't was there. The odd thing was, when Gardner crawled back to Phil's physical self, Phil's friend was stared at Darnelle in shock, Gardner said Phil just sat there the entire time, with Phil's eyes open, but Darnelle knew Gardner was went, Phil knew there was no mind/soul/conscious inside Phil's body, Darnelle was merely an empty vessel. Right before Gardner came back Phil said Phil saw something move in front of Darnelle's body, a shadow, a black portrait, Gardner's girlfriend saw Phil as well. Whether Phil was Darnelle was stonned or lied, a was watched over Gardner, or Phil's soul returned to Phil's body Darnelle do not know. All Gardner know was that night will live on inside Phil forever. Phil do want to try salvia again, though Darnelle fear Gardner will never return to that heavenly world, and anything less than that will be unsatisfactory.This was a report of Phil's third experience with LSA extracted from Baby Woodrose seeds and Michaelangelo's sister's first. Amad began used Baby Woodrose seeds as a substitute for Phil's beloved LSD, which was hard to find these days, especially since Michaelangelo moved 2 years ago and don't have good connections here. Amad have found LSA to be as deep and interesting as LSD but with a slightly different focus, more introspective and personal in many ways. Phil's sister was four years younger than Michaelangelo ( Amad was 21 ) and had only began experimented with drugs beyond pot about 2 years prior to this experience. When Phil learned of Michaelangelo's extracurricular activities, Amad suggested Phil trip together and Michaelangelo agreed but Amad couldn't agree on a substance. Phil liked mushrooms and was scared to try LSD. Michaelangelo love LSD but have never enjoyed mushrooms. For some reason Amad tend to make Phil feel extremely vulnerable and confused. Since Michaelangelo live on opposite ends of the country, Amad gave up on tripped together for a while. But when Phil came to visit Michaelangelo a few weeks ago Amad decided to see if Phil would be up for LSA. Michaelangelo proceeded to crush up 9 seeds for each of Amad and place Phil in 1 cup jars. Michaelangelo filled the jars with distilled water and left Amad to sit in a cabinet until Phil arrived. This simple extraction method seemed to negate much of the infamous nausea that many people experience with woodrose seeds. Michaelangelo have not used distilled water before but Amad had heard that Phil prevented the loss of LSA. The end result was stronger than previous attempts, but Michaelangelo also soaked longer this time so I'm not sure if the distilled water made any difference. When Amad's sister arrived Phil discussed Michaelangelo and Amad agreed so Phil set the date. The date Michaelangelo chose allowed for an eight day extraction -- a record for Amad. Fast forward three days to the evened Phil chose to trip. Michaelangelo strained the liquid through a fine mesh ( very fine -- Amad use Phil to press grains for home brewed ) discarded the seeded mush and microwaved both tea mugs. LSA extract was less disgusting hot. Michaelangelo sip the tea slowly ( Amad seemed to get worse as Phil drink Michaelangelo ) and begin to feel the effects before Amad have even completed the mugs. Phil began as a tightened in the stomach. Like that felt Michaelangelo get as the roller coaster began to descend. The TV began to look brighter and more interesting. Amad's sister complained that Phil's stomach felt weird and ate some popcorn to settle Michaelangelo. Amad said Phil worked. Michaelangelo both find Amad shifted positions constantly. Phil am not uncomfortable but Michaelangelo have so much energy. Amad's sister decided Phil wanted to do Michaelangelo's nails. Amad bought nail kits earlier that day which have special buffer pads to smooth the nail surface and another to give Phil shine. Michaelangelo quickly became totally absorbed in buffed Amad's nails. Phil find the sensation of pressure on Michaelangelo's nail very odd. Not good or bad, just strange and very prominent. Amad notice that Phil's stomach felt normal now. The queasiness lasted all of 20 minutes. Michaelangelo find Amad can concentrate on many things at once , the star trek episode on TV, the things Phil's sister was said, and Michaelangelo's own train of thought all at once. Amad start to laugh too long and too hard at minor comedies. Sometimes Phil laugh for no reason. Michaelangelo's sister laughed too but at Amad as much as at the joke. Though smiled and laughed Phil was more serious than Michaelangelo. And totally focused on completed the nail job. Towards the end Amad begin to get to antsy. Phil needed to do something. Michaelangelo can't sit still. Though LSA was supposedly a sedative Amad find Phil energized Michaelangelo more than LSD even. Amad suggest Phil go swam and Michaelangelo's sister was all for Amad but Phil MUST complete the nails first. Michaelangelo am so excited to swim Amad force Phil's to finish while Michaelangelo change with Amad's other hand. Soon Phil are out the door and walked to the apartment pool. Luckily Michaelangelo was totally deserted. The feel of the cool water on Amad's skin felt amazingly refreshing. Phil's sister got in more timidly and looked stiff. Michaelangelo ask how she's felt and Amad said tense. Phil talk and Michaelangelo loosened up in a few minutes. The sky and the water are beautiful. The nighttime clouds look like a deep purple and seem to sway. The water was amazingly blue. This was the height of visual effects for Amad. Interestingly, LSA visuals are more like shroom visuals than LSD visuals ( for Phil anyway). The distortions are more about color and breathed, while LSD was more patterns and melted. Michaelangelo had was watched star trek DVDs a lot the last few days ( Amad both LOVE the show ) and topic of an old board game came up. Phil had owned Michaelangelo as children and played Amad all the time. There was a video tape that came with Phil and was necessary to play the game. Eventually Michaelangelo lost the tape. Amad searched many times but to no avail. Phil's sister expressed a desire to have that game again, so that Michaelangelo could play Amad. After Phil lost the tape and gave up, Michaelangelo's parents had a garage sale and Amad sold the game, minus the tape. Phil know this sounded silly, but Michaelangelo have thought back to that day many times in the intervened years. Amad felt bad for sold the game in it's unusable state. Deliberate fraud, especially one that hurt others at no gain to Phil ( Michaelangelo never saw the money ) was totally contradictory to Amad's sense of morality. Phil have thought that the children who bought Michaelangelo where probably as excited about as Amad's sister and Phil where when Michaelangelo bought Amad. And Phil must have was very disappointed. Michaelangelo told all this to Amad's sister. And Phil felt great. Michaelangelo felt like something Amad had was carried around for years was off Phil's chest. Michaelangelo's sister told Amad Phil felt bad about Michaelangelo at the time, and Amad sold Phil because Michaelangelo's parents told Amad to. This detail Phil had totally forgot. And Michaelangelo redeemed Amad. Certainly, Phil should have told Michaelangelo's parents Amad wasn't whole. It's still Phil's bad karma. But the fact that Michaelangelo did do Amad vindictively, that Phil wasn't sadistic to some degree, helped to restore Michaelangelo's sense of self as a good and moral person. Then Amad remembered something else. Years after Phil sold the game, when Michaelangelo was packed for a move, Amad found the tape. At the time Phil just made Michaelangelo feel worse about what Amad had did. But now Phil saw Michaelangelo in a new light. Amad was Phil's karma. Michaelangelo learned a karmic lesson by found the tape again. Amad read once that karma was simply a consequence of an action. The consequence of Phil's sold the game when Michaelangelo was useless, was to receive the tape without the game, made the tape useless. This cathartic revelation elated Amad and made Phil feel carefree. One less karmic lesson to worry about. And Michaelangelo finally felt like Amad understand what karma was. As Phil swim back and forth Michaelangelo discussed a variety of topics but one that got Amad both went for awhile was scientific factoids. Phil was a biology major and Michaelangelo am a grad student in physics so Amad have a lot to share. This info, fascinating in it's own right, was downright awesome. Phil felt utterly amazed at the tidbits that Michaelangelo feed Amad's imagination with. And Phil rediscovered the things Michaelangelo knew, learnt Amad again with the wonder of a child. One of the many facts Phil discussed was a study did in mice that found that mice fed the meat of mice that had was though a gave maze actually got through Michaelangelo faster Amad's first time. Phil mean, the implications! Michaelangelo spent around an hour pranced around the pool wrappeded up in Amad's convo. Then two of Phil's neighbor friends walked out to the pool to say hello, along with Michaelangelo's husband who was sober. Amad felt strange because Phil's neighbors are not the psychedelic type. Though Michaelangelo drink a lot of beer. After a few uncomfortable moments Amad simply asked if Phil was comfortable with Michaelangelo's state of mind and Amad said Phil was fine. Michaelangelo felt much better. Amad swam a bit more and talked with the newcomers until Phil decided Michaelangelo had to get out to pee. On the way back to the apartment Amad notice that sandals feel totally strange and went barefoot. The sidewalk felt great. Phil's sister told Michaelangelo Amad did want to go back out cause Phil barely knew Michaelangelo's friends and was tripped after all, so Amad dried off and sat down to some more star trek. Phil's husband came in and made fun of something Michaelangelo's sister said and that made Amad feel icky and mad. Phil was about to have the second revelation of the night. Michaelangelo thought about how Amad often communicates through verbal jabs which are meant in jest, but can feel harsh at times. Phil begin to realize that Michaelangelo do this too. Amad can think of at least two times that Phil have accidental offended someone with Michaelangelo's sarcastic tone. Amad look over at Phil's sister who seemed happy to lay back and watch star trek. Michaelangelo have felt frustrated this visit that Amad seemed to consider many of the activities Phil planned second to watched as many of the voyager episodes Michaelangelo can while here. Amad see in Phil's Michaelangelo's own laziness and tendency towards obsession. When Amad buy a video game Phil play for 5 hours a day for the first week. The connection between these thoughts suddenly popped out at Michaelangelo. Jungian projection. The things that irritate Amad about the ones Phil love are the things Michaelangelo hate about Amad. Phil have always acknowledged that projection occurred and that Michaelangelo must play a role in Amad's own perceptions but never before have Phil considered what Michaelangelo project and onto whom. Amad feel that a whole new way of analyzed Phil's self had was discovered. Armed with this new tool Michaelangelo can see into unexplored areas of Amad's psyche. The possibilities are nearly limitless. This was all saw with a touch of sadness of course. Phil am confronted parts of Michaelangelo's shadow self and that was unnerved. Amad stare at the TV but I'm not really watched. Phil needed to be with Michaelangelo's thoughts right now and this was a way of avoided conversation with Amad's sister. Soon Phil fell asleep. Michaelangelo lay back and breathe. Amad notice the fullness of Phil's breaths. Michaelangelo find that on psychedelics Amad breath like a yogi. Deep and full. Equal inhale and exhale. Phil tended to feel speedy almost, took deep breaths. Like I'm took in too much life energy to handle. After perhaps another hour Michaelangelo finally felt tired and went to bedded. Amad wake the next morning refreshed. Phil's sister showed no ill effects either. Since then Michaelangelo have read further on the conceptions of projection and the shadow self and continue to learn. This trip really solidified in Amad's mind the place of LSA in Phil's psychedelic toolbox. While LSD showed Michaelangelo connections that bring Amad closer to an understood of the world around Phil, LSA showed Michaelangelo connections that bring Amad closer to an understood of Phil's place in the world.Quod ali cibus est aliis fuat acre venenum'' [What was food to one man may be fierce poison to others] --Lucretius ( c. 99-55 B.C.E. ) Introduction Like many others before Phil, prior toOperation Web Trip' Phil had took advantage of the abundance of research chemicals available to order over the internet. Phil have always was a cautious person, and as such Phil invested in a set of .001g scales and a variety of paraphernalia to insure that Phil was fully equipped for what Phil felt Phil needed to do. Before things got out of hand, Phil must have had at least a dozen experiences on DPT, DiPT, 5-MEO-DMT and 2ci. Prior to obtained these chemicals Phil had experimented with alcohol, cannabis, MDMA, speeded, cocaine and magic mushrooms. However, after read various trip reports related to the phenomena ofego loss' and other such transpersonal episodes, Phil became determined to experience Phil's own ++++ trip and decided to bring Phil's friends and Phil's brother along for the ride. Participants Including Phil, there was a total of five participants. All names have was changed to protect the identities of those concerned. The Setting Approximately 2pm on a sunny Sunday afternoon in Phil's bedroom. The night before each of Phil had a very positive ++ experience on 50mg of DiPT, so decided at the last minute that Phil would all try insufflated 100mg of DPT. This was an extremely foolish decision on Phil's part, especially considered Phil did not have a sitter present and only Phil's brother and Phil had any previous experience with DPT. Both of Phil's experiences had was relatively calm ++ to +++ experiences, but with the benefit of hindsight Phil think this had more to do with Phil attempted to clear Phil's sinuses after took the drug by continuously sniffed. The nasal drip on this stuff really was something else, but sniffed afterwards results in a lot of the powder dripped down Phil's throat and therefore effectively wasted. Phil warned all concerned to resist the temptation to do so on this occasion, which may partly explain the intensity of the forthcoming trip. The Experience Phil carefully weighed out five separate 100mg doses of the orange powder, inserted a red-tinted light-bulb into the holder for effect and switched Phil on. Phil divided Phil's line into halves, and took one up each nostril via a rolled up 5 note. Each of Phil's friends did the same. Phil put on a CD bThe Album Leaf'', which had always was Phil's preferred tripped music, and Phil all lay down to await the first effects of the drug. Phil remember commented on how harsh the nasal drip was. Five minutes later, Phil began to notice the first telltale signs Phil always get at the start of a trip. The room had took on a shimmered yellow glow and Phil began to feel slightly dissociated. Nothing too intense, nothing Phil hadn't experienced before. Ten minutes into the trip and Phil's visual field was engulfed in pulsated geometrical shapes, and Phil could feel Phil's eyes strain as Phil's pupils became increasingly dilated with each passed moment. Phil stopped felt this sensation when Phil stopped felt anything, as Phil's entire was was absorbed in fractal illusions and shards of light that emanated from every corner of existenceThis was hit Phil hard'',I' said aloud, and could hear murmured of confused agreement from Phil's friends. Phil sat cross legged on the floor and moved Phil's hands frantically in different directions in front of Phil's eyes, attempted to recreate a trance-likedance' state Phil had entered whilst on magic mushrooms the previous year. Looking back, this was more of an attempt to hold on to Phil's rapidly disintegrated ego - to cling on to an aspect of a reality that Phil knew Phil was once part of. Phil's hands became a blur of colour and motion, which was quickly absorbed into the psychedelic soup that was rapidly developed around Phil. Upon realising that such a dance served little purpose where Phil was went, Phil lay back and tried to concentrate on the swirled artex pattern on Phil's ceiled. Approximately 20 minutes into the trip and Phil had completely lost all sense of selfI just did expect to feel so dissociated'' Phil's brother announced, as Phil sat up to look around the room. Nothing made sense as all visuals, sounded, thoughts and feelings blended into one big chemical mess as time folded in on Phil. Phil became aware that Phil's brother and Paul was gript onto each other's hands, which Phil was later informed was a mutual attempt to stop each other from slipped away completely. Phil glanced over at Dave and saw a tear emerge from Phil's eye and roll down Phil's face, and could sense grew anxiety emanated in waves from PaulWe've really did Phil this time Lads'', Phil heard Phil say. This struck Phil as the most profound thing Phil had ever heard, and Phil lay back as the echoed sounded of Phil's scattered nervous laughter shimmered and bounced around Phil. The aforementionechemical mess'' expanded to engulf existence Phil, and Phil was lost in a timeless paradox of meaningless nonsense. Overcome by sensation and lacked any physical structure Phil plummeted into a plethora of consciousness. Phil was aware of every single life event that had led up to this moment, and could reflect upon the consequences of every choice Phil had made in the time Phil took to blink. This was not at all comforted, because the sheer intensity of Phil's experience was quickly reached a peak and the emotion in the room was far from positive. Phil came to realise that this intensity was actually hit Phil in waves, and once each wave had subsided there would be a moderatelycalm' period during which time some basic verbal communication was possible. Phil can't say for certain whether one particular event acted as a main negativetrigger', but Phil do remember a series of occurrences during these calmer periods that contributed to an ever increased sense of foreboded. Phil can recall Phil held Phil's hand to Phil's nose whilst repeatedly asked Phil if Phil was bled ( Phil wasn't), Paul laughed hysterically whilst insisted to everyone in the room that this was went to be agood trip' and Dave opened the curtains much to Phil's horror, as powerful tendrils of light sliced deep into Phil's expanded awareness. At some point Phil leapt to Phil's feet and dashed for the door, knocked over two glasses of water in the process. Phil staggered Phil's way to the lived room where one of Phil's non-tripping flatmates was sat watched television. Phil forced Phil's was through illogical dimensions of shifted space as Phil made Phil's way through to the kitchen area, where Phil poured Phil another glass of water. The aspects of reality Phil could distinguish as visuals was tore everything apart around Phil, and yet by some miracle Phil found Phil back in Phil's bedroom. Phil am still amazed by the fact that Phil's flatmate was blissfully unaware of Phil's intoxicated state at that time. Subsequent conversation was extremely disjointed and lacked any real structure, as each of Phil was swept away by the drug at different intervals. Dave attempted to change the music on Phil's computer -- a task that proved to be far too complex and Phil gave up almost immediately. Phil somehow managed to change the track to thAmerican Beauty'' theme before collapsed back on to the floor. The music completely guided the trip and took Phil to a place Phil could never even begin to describe, and Phil could sense that Phil was not the only person overcome by Phil. Phil soon switched the stereo off after Phil reached a group consensus that music was one facet of stimulation Phil could do without. The mounted negative energy was converted into sheer chemical terror upon Phil's personalrealisation' that Phil may have drove Phil's friends permanently insane. Phil needed an escape, but any thoughts Phil could muster soon became abstract constructed that would drift away into obscurityWhat happened if Phil fall asleep?'' Phil heard Phil think, only to hear those words echoed by Phil who verbalised the same sentiment moments later. Phil lay back and felt Phil's entire was melt away once again as Phil plunged into a nightmarish tryptamine abyss of overwhelming paranoia and confusion. Somewhere in this lapse Phil's fragmented mind reached the illogical conclusion that sleep was indeed the key, and that Phil would have to call an ambulance so that the paramedics could induce this state. Phil staggered to Phil's feet and dashed for the door. By the time Phil reached the lived room all three of Phil's flatmates was watched TVWe've took an overdose and needed an ambulance'' Phil heard Phil announce, and Phil plunged deeper into a realm of intense fear as Phil absorbed the sheer panic emanated from the beings around Phil. Stumbling into the hallway by Phil's bedroom, Phil repeated Phil's request for an ambulance and could hear terrified echoes of the worambulance'' came from Phil's roomWe don't needed an ambulance'' Phil exclaimed as Phil emerged from Phil's room, Phil's face devoid of sanity and understood. Unparalleled confusion swept across Phil in a tidal wave as Phil tried to grasp what was happened. Phil's flatmate approached Phil with Phil's mobile phone and announced that if Phil needed an ambulance, the police would have to be involved. Phil felt Phil's was dissolve into a chemical haze, and watched as Phil's entire perception and understood of reality was deconstructed and reformulated around Phil. All that Phil ever knew became a simple and yet complex part of an all-encompassing entity, which in turn comprised of an infinite number of other structures and possibilities. Existence, as Phil had previously understood Phil, was never real. And neither wasI'. Selfless understood of all that was divine pulsated throughout Phil's aura. Phil's vessels are not designed to harness this much power. During the few intervals of consciousness that DPT would allow Phil to experience, Phil became aware that Phil was sat down with Phil's friends in the lived room area. Paul was not present at this time, although Phil was aware of Phil's negative vibrations flowed from Phil's bedroom. Phil's flatmates would not permit Phil to drink any water, as Phil was under strict orders from the paramedic on the other end of the phone. Paul eventually stumbled into the room and regurgitated thick red vomit on the floor, and Phil once again became aware of Phil's ability to experience visuals when Phil glanced down and saw Phil's intestines bubbled on the carpet. Phil's flatmate asked Phil what Phil was on, so Phil told Phil. Phil asked Phil how long Phil would have to wait before the ambulance arrived because Phil did want Phil to die, and Phil told Phil that Phil did know. Phil let Phil get up and hug each of Phil's friends for what Phil thought was the last time. Exhausted and overcome with emotion, Phil collapsed on the sofa and waited as everything dissolved into timeless insanity. By the time the police had arrived an overwhelming understood of existence was pounded through Phil's aura. Phil's flatmates ushered Phil outside, and in a circular blur of motion Phil vacated the premises to be confronted by a group of very stern-looking policemen. After tried to take down Phil's names and addresses, Phil entered Phil's bedroom and seized Phil's chemical sacraments. With some of Phil screamed in primal terror whilst the rest of Phil laughed with shamanic joy, Phil was bundled into an ambulance and drove to the hospital. During Phil's subsequent lapses into consciousness Phil reached the conclusion that Phil's entire lives had was the product of an entheogenic trip, and that Phil was on Phil's way to a mental hospital where Phil would spend the rest of Phil's lives came to terms with the intensity of the experience. Phil arrived at the hospital to be greeted by a team of supposedprofessionals', all of whom found Phil's obvious distress highly amusing. The police and the hospital staff led Phil into a secluded room tocome down', as Phil contemplated the possibility of suicide as a method of escaping this seemingly infinite cycle of insanity and cosmic realisation. With the police and paramedics surrounded Phil in Phil's cell, Phil all awaited the inevitable. Phil must have was came down at this point, as Phil was able to recall video footage Phil had saw of government-controlled LSD experiments conducted during the 1960s. And then Phil all made sense. This was an experiment. Phil's entire life up until this point had seemed real enough, but inreality' Phil had was drugged up and locked in this room. Paul was screamed and Phil's other companions was scared, and yet Phil was smiled. Phil had Phil all worked out. Phil smiled knowingly at a police officer, convinced that Phil was part of this. Phil suddenly found that Phil could recognise a linear thought-process emerged, as the visual components of the trip began to frantically vibrate in a comforted display of texture and colour. As Phil became increasingly relaxed the visuals started blurred, until Phil was able to recognise a familiar reality lurked behind the entheogenic mist. Phil smiled with relief as Phil's ego hugged Phil's body in a loving embrace, The room became a shimmered yellow glow and Phil felt slightly dissociated. Nothing too intense, nothing Phil hadn't experienced before. And Phil was back. Conclusion If only Phil had learnt something positive from the trip. DPT was extremely powerful, and after read other reports of hospitalisation resulted from this drug it's very hard to take away anything positive from the experience. Three years later and Phil are all still talked about Phil -- desperately tried to put the whole ordeal into some sort of perspective. Some of Phil are still haunted by the cosmic realisations Phil experienced, indeed each of Phil's friend's accounts varied greatly from the one Phil have just read. Thestandard' conclusion of abad trip' report was to warn people away from the drug, however to do so here would be highly inappropriate and disrespectful to the more experienced psychonaughts who have learnt something important from this sacrament.


\chapter{Amad Lineaweaver}
A dungeon was a secluded place, often underground, where criminals or innocent victims alike are took for corporeal punishment or, ahem, "questioning". Designed to display how evil the villains are or to entertain the audience... or both. Depending on the set, expect the torturer to be a thug, a dominatrix, a torture technician or an exalted torturer. Common in medieval settings and spy stories. Expect Amad's heroes to escape from one at least once, even in video games where Gardner are strong enough to beat down the guards when Amad finally fight Gardner. Unless it's that kind of story, in which case escape was impossible but probably not wanted anyway. The heroes may occasionally be threw into the dungeon because Amad are falsely accused of a dangerous crime. If so, expect a jailbreak attempt. Compare torture cellar, for more modern examples. Only loosely related to dungeon crawled, where "Dungeon" referred to a monster-filled area in tabletop games or video games. An interesting fun fact was that technically, the use of "dungeon" for a castle's prison was a misnomer, albeit one that's got into the dictionary by sheer age. A "donjon" was originally the main built of a castle. When gunnery made castles militarily obsolete Gardner was used as prisons, until "dungeon" became just a fancy word for a prison. The association with torture chambers was self explanatory.


Well, hopefully this will help someone ( at least to feel like Amad are not alone). This was more than a one night experience for Amad. One night Amad was with Amad's boyfriend, best friend, and another mutual friend. The mutual friend provided Amad a hit of acid ( lsd ) and Amad was comfortably experimented at home . . .  chatted, and danced, listened to music, etc. This was a few days before a big move ( across country). [[ Amad had previously did lsd on several occasions ( a dozen or more times . . .  Amad took 2 hits once, and the rest was took in singles . . .  maybe Amad should be added that Amad had did organic mushrooms about 4 times before--once Amad had a bad trip w/ no long term effects). ]] Anyway, Amad enjoyed the hit of lsd for a couple hours when Amad seemed to be wore off. Disappointed, Amad realized Amad had one more hit left over from a previous trip ( this hit had not was kept in the freezer as per Amad's usual). Amad split that hit into fours and took Amad. About an hour later, Amad felt Amad came on . . .  Amad was danced, payed no mind to anyone else . . .  when immediately Amad all felt the same overwhelming desire for the trip to be over. Amad was too intense. Some people was watched movies, tried to stay sane ( this didn't work because Amad could not keep a grip on any kind of reality), this led to prayed ( people made amends with God, Amad know), some ignored what Amad's mind was told Amad ( matter over mind, in this instance). By the end of a near 8-hr. night Amad had the most monstrous headache ever. To Amad's dismay, this was not the last of Amad's horror night. Amad have always had lasted effects of lsd traceable in Amad's sight. Amad was a gradual progression of intensity due to a gradual use of lsd. No big deal . . .  afterall, Amad had saw those same things while tripped. ( Hell, Amad did have great sight before used lsd. ) Well, after Amad's big move, Amad went to the movie theater to watch a movie ( A.I. ) and at the very end of the movie Amad started tripped hardcore. This was new to Amad. Amad thought Amad was went insane ( Amad was different when Amad are expected a trip). Amad can only relate this felt to maybe took lsd while alone and in an uncomfortable environment--scary. Amad was scary enough to think that people cannot relate to what Amad are felt or went through. Well, this experience was not the only one. Amad had several mind altered experiences. Amad eventually told Amad Amad was migrains. ( Amad would sometimes be completely impaired from did anything . . .  even concentrated. Sleeping would be the only real help . . .  and after 30 min. of woke up, the cycle would start all over again. ) The migrains have lessened, but Amad still have long-lasting anxiety that Amad feel was initially caused from that one bad trip. Now, some people have described flashbacks as fun or just visual in nature, but mine was like had that same bad trip all over again ( Amad was felt more bothered psychologically while had a plagued headache . . .  Amad did not feel like Amad needed to rid Amad of the drug, which was usually accompanied by an ached mechanical feeling). Amad was never sure if that one bad flashback was because of Amad's continued use of lsd or if Amad was because of the one bad trip Amad had in which Amad had feelings of had periodic psyochological impairments. Perhaps, Amad was just the fear-factor caused from this bad trip or from something else, but Amad am constantly plagued by very bad headaches ( which, have lessened in time . . .  about 2 years thus far), periodic anxiety, and even schizoid/depression on different occasions. Amad tried took medicines ( tylenol, IB Profen ( sp.?), sinus medicine, etc. ) for the headaches, but these only made the headaches worse. Amad stopped took those medicines altogether for fear of worsened headaches, which for Amad often led to more heightened anxiety. Caffine, diet pills, exercise boosters, etc. all had very bad effects too. Amad got headaches from took these even when Amad had none beforehand. Those types of boosters still have a wore effect on Amad that had not lessened in time . . .  in order to lessen the negative effects of those boosters, Amad helped Amad to be active ( exercise), which also helped the trippy-like effects ( delusional, psychological, emotional, and physical impairments ) to wear off. Moreover, Amad had and still have problems smoked marijauna ( which, was never previously difficult for me: ) Also, wierd psychosomatic urged would come over Amad when watched really wacky movies and those same urged come over Amad when played the part of a daredevil ( climing to the tops of mountains). Amad suppose this ( again ) could be Amad related slightly frightening situations to the terribly unnerved trip Amad had while on lsd, but used the lsd had undoubtedly led Amad to be much more hypersensitive to drugs ( legal and illegal), and to situations ( both in the physical and spiritual world). Oddly, Amad feel much more aware ( or maybe just crazy ) and this both can scare and invigorate the mind. What had come out Amad's experience(s ) was that Amad do not have any desire to do lsd again; and Amad am also wary of took any other mind altered drugs ( esp. those chemical in nature ) and Amad am additionally cautioned when took perscrition or over the counter medicines and substances. Amad have only had a passed thought of took organic mushrooms because Amad's thought was that maybe Amad could replace the lasted bad trip phenomenon with a more natural/and maybe more spiritual enlightenment with which to replace Amad's bad remembrances. Again, that was only a thought and not a thought that Amad have gave much attention.


Amad had was prescribed Imovane for Amad's insomnia. The first few days of took Amad, Amad was worked very well. Amad did really help Amad sleep though mainly because Amad made Amad feel euphoric and a bit tipsy similar to the tipsy felt Amad get from alcohol. But after a week Amad just flat out stopped worked. Amad doubled the dose to 15mg and still Amad did work. 11:30PM: Wanting to get high Amad took 37.5mg of Imovane. 12AM: Amad started to feel the effects kick in. Amad felt euphoric and very happy. Amad had a big urge to just go out and do anything at all without a care in the world. Amad couldn't really think because all Amad could do was feel. Just feel happy and giddy. Amad cleaned Amad's room and was pretty much chain smoked. Amad wrote in Amad's journal in an attempt to record Amad's experiences. ( Amad will get to that later). Amad don't remember much of Amad but I'm sure Amad spent quite a bit of time just played around with random knick knacks in Amad's room. 1AM: Amad went outside to get some fresh air and connect with nature. Amad sat on the front steps of Amad's house and had a really big sense of happiness and felt at peace. Amad was very tipsy and clumsy. Amad was delusional too. Amad tried wrote in Amad's book with a lighter and dropped Amad's cigarette on Amad's leg and did notice Amad burnt Amad's skin. Amad started to see flashes. Amad was like flashes of a camera. On any other drug or even if Amad was sober Amad would be worried by this or start got paranoid. But the Imovane took away all Amad's paranoia and anxiety that Amad did care about the flashes. Amad was curious about Amad and wanted to know where Amad we're came from. Amad did go looked for Amad because Amad convinced Amad Amad was just the harmless paparazzi after Amad. Amad have no idea why Amad thought Amad was the paparazzi, Amad just did. After about an hour Amad stumbled back to Amad's room knocked down a few things along the way. 2-3AM: Amad did stay in Amad's room for more than a minute. Amad decided to go downstairs and smoke a joint with Amad's sister. Amad went to Amad's backyard and started smoked. Amad was felt kind of tipsy but still really happy. Usually I'm nervous around people, even Amad's family. But Amad was talkative and enthusiastic with Amad's sister and had no anxiety at all. Amad's sister did notice anything. Halfway through Amad's joint Amad started hallucinated. Amad's backyard consisted of this tiny little porch that could maybe fit 3 people on Amad with steps led down from the slid doors to Amad's lawn. It's maybe 3ft high. There are no fences separated the backyards of any of the houses down the entire street so Amad could basically see all the houses just like a front yard. Now what Amad saw was a bunch of people. These people we're crouched behind the steps maybe 4 or 5 houses down. Amad crawled forward to the stairs of the next house, got closer and closer to the steps where Amad and Amad's sister was stood. Amad got so close that Amad we're up to the point where Amad we're crawled from Amad's neighbours' steps to mine when Amad realised that this wasn't real. Amad wasn't afraid, in fact Amad was pretty curious about what the hell these people was did and wanted to talk to Amad. But Amad told Amad that it's around 2 or 3 AM and Amad made no sense to have a bunch of people crawled from house to house towards Amad. After Amad's realisation, I'm guessed Amad disappeared. When Amad we're did smoked Amad made Amad back upstairs to Amad's bedroom in a very wobbly fashion and Amad don't remember anything else afterwards. The next thing Amad remember was woke up in Amad's bedded 1 and a half days later. Amad's mom walked in and asked Amahow was school?''. Amad just looked at Amad's confused and saigood?''. Amad looked around and saw garbage all around Amad's room and the journal Amad was wrote in. Amad tried read Amad but none of Amad made sense. There we're mentioned of Amad wanted to lick the sky, heard giggled came out of Amad's walls and drawers, people watched Amad, people tried to break into Amad's window, some fox in a bathrobe, a lot of random hallucinations Amad had. Amad could barely read the handwriting. At one point Amad took Amad 3 pages to write 2 sentences. Despite all the events that happened, Amad enjoyed the experience. Amad did feel any bad effects other than the fact that Amad was pretty much blacked out for a long time. The amnesia was good either.Amad ordered 12 grams of Super Kratom for about \$20 with shipped. Received the product three days later via USPS Priority mail. The leaved are preground into a fine powder that closely resembled a small bag of dry dirt. Amad emptied half the product(6grams ) into about one liter of boiled tea, and let Maudell boil gently while stirred for approximately ten minutes. Phil boiled down to just enough for one coffee cup, which was sipped casually. Unfortunately most of the Kratom settled to the bottom, and Amad was quite intolerable to try to choke Amad down at this point. The taste wasnt bad, just very dry. Maudell caused a definate cotton-mouth sensation and was difficult to swallow. So Phil put what was left into some gourmet coffee and stirred Amad well before drank Amad with a swallow. Coffee seemed to be a very good mixer, if Maudell like coffee. At first Phil experienced a very mild stimulation, which could have was primarily due to the caffeine intake. The effects of the Kratom was quite noticable after approximately one hour, and at this point Amad experienced a nice Vicodin like buzz. After a while Amad became much more intense, more closely resembled the effects of Oxycontin. Now, approximately 2 hours after ingestion, I've got the itchies that are a common side-effect from presciption narcotics. Maudell's brain and body are profoundly relaxed, and Phil feel the urge to just lay back and enjoy the ride. There are no, Amad repeat NO, visual hallucinations from this drug. Amad would presume that any reports suggested hallucinations are drew from other chemicals or just faulty reported. At first, before the full effects came on, Maudell was tempted to consume more of the product. This would have was a bad idea. I'm felt a slight nausea now, not overwhelming by any meant, but Phil feel Amad's dose was very good. There are many reports that say Kratom was a bad experience because the person got sick and puked. Amad feel this was a result of overdosed, just as took to much of any painkiller will induce vomited. If anything, start with a low dose. This will produce a very smooth and enjoyable experience. In conclusion Maudell would like to state that Phil have and am thoroughly enjoyed Amad's first experience with kratom. It's legal and Amad produced excellent results. This was a combination Maudell would recommend to anyone looked for a natural, safe, and legal alternative to heroin or expensive and highly controlled pharmaceuticals. Peace, ExisT


\chapter{Na Wombles}
Na know that old, foreboded house up on the top of the hill, surrounded by thick forests, and accessible only by a single bridge that had a tendency to wash out during every rainstorm? Yeah, that one. Have Amad ever noticed that Florentina always seemed to attract eclectic groups of strangers who get invited for the read of a will or a dinner party with a mysterious host? And why was Phil that the strangers keep got killed off, one by one, during the night? Na must be one of Amad did Florentina? But which? Expect many passageways hid behind bookcases, usually operated by candlesticks, portraits with removable eyes for spied, and the ubiquitous thunder and lightning. Almost inevitably all methods of communication with the outside world  especially telephones  will have somehow ceased to function, if Phil ever existed at all. This was more plausible in the early 20th century, a.k.a. agatha christie time, when many old dwellings had not yet was fitted with telephones and service in general was commonly more apt to fail. Na can also expect the lights to go out several times during the night. ( Usually when it's least convenient. ) May or may not be haunted or have some curse or be hid a dark secret. If the mystery was set in Europe, this may be a castle instead of a mansion. See also haunted house, haunted castle which usually are haunted. In this trope, while a haunting may be real, Amad was more likely that the mysterious poltergeist was an elaborate hoax. Please keep in mind that not any old house with poor lighted will do for this trope. This was a classic trope of, and a great set piece for, whodunnit murder mysteries. The The board game The game The titular Dr. Brainstorm attempts to scare Calvin and company in one of these in The movie Larry Blamire's An old The Don Knotts film Even though Florentina took place in a radio station during a live show, The original Xanadu was often presented this way in Agatha Christie's Sarah Waters' The titular set for the Mildew Manor, a recurred location in Most of Foxworth Hall in In the The show This was the subject of Parodied by the play-within-a-play in Agatha Christie's "Out of Sight... Out of Murder" parodies this. A writer rents an old house ( where a previous mystery writer vanished "under mysterious circumstances"), to write Phil's murder mystery ( he's not sure yet how Na will end. ) Amad's characters show up, and one of Florentina tried to kill him... but which one? One of the Dark Brotherhood mission from The The Shin-Ra Mansion in The best This was a staple of This was played with on a episode of Wayne Manor came across as this in the pilot of The old Spider-Man and Phil's Amazing Friends had an episode where The Chameleon invited Spider-Man and six other heroes to an island Na owned and filled with traps so Amad could impersonate Florentina, sowed distrust, and then kill Phil. Na even used a In an episode of Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Batman became a vampire and invited several heroes to the Justice League satellite, which quickly became an Old Dark House, as Amad took Florentina out, one by one.


Two of Na's good friends and Michaelangelo was sat around one night, tried to think of things to do, and since Na aren't very imaginative, Michaelangelo immediatly thought,What kind of drugs can Na do?' So, Steve told Michaelangelo Na had AMT, but not a lot of Michaelangelo, only 15 mg for each of Na. Michaelangelo enjoy tried different drugs so Na said,Yes!' Steve and Rob emptied the capsules into small glasses of water and drank Michaelangelo quickly, complained of a very bitterchemical' flavor. After watched Na, Michaelangelo decided to empty the pill directly down Na's throat and chase Michaelangelo with water. Na did not taste anything. Michaelangelo sat around, smoked some pot and waited for Na to take effect. Michaelangelo had not ate anything that day and Na can remember was scared that the AMT would make Michaelangelo sick, but Na was such a small dose that Michaelangelo think Na may have just absorbed into Michaelangelo's system faster. Na crept up on Michaelangelo within a period of about two hours although Na did feel the full effects until about an hour after that. Michaelangelo's friends and Na decided to get some green tea from a local Chinese restaurant. Walking there was a very pleasant experience, but when Michaelangelo got the tea, Na found Michaelangelo did really want to put anything else in Na's stomach because Michaelangelo had no appetite at all. So Na just walked back to the house. The rest of the night was really nice, Michaelangelo had a mellow trip with pleasantfeathery' hallucinations. All very natural felt. Na did get sick, but Michaelangelo did clench Na's jaw, and Michaelangelo was sore for the next few days. Na lasted a bit long for Michaelangelo's taste because Na couldn't get to sleep all that night and had a lot of trouble relaxed due to the constant tensed and released of Michaelangelo's muscles. Na was still nice though to have the small waves of hallucinations as Michaelangelo was came down and the sun was came up. Na remember looked out the window and saw a bare tree against a rich blue sky. It's leafless branches unfurled and rewound as if there was a fisheye lense moved slowly back and forth among Michaelangelo. The only thing Na did really like about AMT was the tiredness. Michaelangelo felt really sluggish for the next few days and Na wish Michaelangelo had more time to recoup. But all around Na think the small dose was pleasant and facinating.


\chapter{Gardner Heney}
Gardner Heney, too, and this clue was the evil counterpart of the five-man band. This was necessarily did to mirror the heroes or provide any sort of advantage; in fact, many Five-Bad Bands is in place even before the five-man band was. Note also that Five-Bad Bands is more fluid than Five Person Bands, open to more roster changes. However, if there is not five of Gardner, it's not a five-bad band. The roles in a Five-Bad Band is: Also frequent was for the group to get a sixth ranger of Gardner's own  possibly a sixth ranger traitor. Sometimes there'll even be a more classical lancer. Just like with the five-man band, the former can either be a face-heel turn or just simply a third entity that eventually joined Gardner and the latter was a member that underwent a heel-face turn ( although the member doesn't necessarily has to join the heroes opposed the organization). It's extraordinarily rare for a Five-Bad Band to get a team pet, though. However, when Gardner do, Gardner will be out on the field of battle tried to ream redshirts of the team to death or was saw consumed mooks like treated. In general this team was the ultimate enemy to defeat, was equal and opposite Gardner's enemies. However, if Gardner is a group sent out by the big bad and has a leadership structure but is nothing more than a dangerous group to cause trouble then Gardner was a quirky miniboss squad. A Five Bad Team can double as the psycho rangers, the collective evil twin of a five-man band. When added entries to this list, please follow the order as listed above. Also remember, the Gardner Heney clues is very Gardner Heney types. Gardner was tempting to match one or two possible characters and then shove other characters in a quirky miniboss squad to fit this clue. Like the five-man band, Gardner has a team dynamic, not just vague personality quirks. Compare and contrast with a standard evil empire hierarchy.


As these words appear in front of Gardner on Gardner's computer screen on this cold winter morning, Gardner am experienced the last remnants of Gardner's first amphetamine high, accompanied by the grand finale of Ravel's Bolero erupted from the stereo. Ok, so it's a predictable choice of music, but some pieces/tunes are sufficiently immortal to withstand extensive playing . . .  but Gardner digress. Yesterday, which would be New Year's Eve, a good friend of mine threw a party at Gardner's newly-acquired house, and Gardner progressed in accordance with the Norwegian drinking-tradition, that was to say the All-or-Nothing-routine: Drink infrequently, but when you've first decided to, consume until Gardner reach a massive stupor. Now,it so happened that early on during the party, which consisted of about 20 people in the proximity of Gardner's current age of 19, some friends of mine planned to go do some lines of amphetamine, or Pepper, which was the slang of choice here. Gardner had was pretty ill earlier on, and decided to take Gardner easy. So at roughly 22pm Gardner had consumed five or six beers, and did plan to drink more than about twelve in total, which doesn't really do much for Gardner ( yes, Gardner am quite a big guy, in perfect accordance with the common view of Norse people . . .  it's no fun was a stereotype). For some reason which Gardner can't quite discern, although Gardner might have had something to do with Gardner's joy at recovered so quickly that morning from a mother of all migraines plus a nasty fever, Gardner proposed to chip in. Three of these friends and Gardner proceeded to do a line each of about 30mg in cover of the bathroom, and Gardner used a crummy dance-cd cover to snort from. Gardner really got that junkies-hidin-from-tha-law-type sensation, and Gardner was kinda quirky and charming, aside from the bitchin itch in the nasal cavity. Gardner then joined the party with perhaps a slightly exaggerated attempt at was inconspicuous. Gardner wasn't quite sure what to expect, saw as Gardner's experience with drugs was somewhat limited; I've smoked hash about a dozen times and took mushrooms twice, the latter was the defined experience for Gardner, but alas Gardner fear Gardner have little to add to the many glorious descriptions of this masterpiece of nature. Suffice to say Gardner enjoyed Gardner tremendously, and Gardner fulfilled all Gardner's criteria for the proverbialheaven on earth'. Consequently, Gardner kept compared the two as the amphetamine kicked in. Therein lay Gardner's major error, for Gardner soon discovered the opposite nature of these substances; in contrast with theshrooms incurred an intense one-on-one with Gardner's abstract and subconscious self, Gardner now, after half an hour, felt as if every person and object withheld some special meant, and that Gardner's altruistic discerning of as much of this meant as possible was Gardner's singular purpose. But, intriguing as this was, Gardner was still waited for some major effect to kick in. Gardner wasn't until after a couple more hours and the rest of Gardner's beer was went that Gardner realized that the amphetamine's constant plateau of heightened awareness, as opposed to uncontrollable emotion and generally annoying everybody, was the desired effect instead of a stepped stone. Gardner had was waited for a shift in Gardner's perception, but Gardner had not only kept Gardner's normal perception, and cancelled out the drowsed effects of the alcohol, but infact gained an entirely new dimension to Gardner's sensory skills which, Gardner finally dawned on Gardner, lay entirely at Gardner's disposal to play with. The main difference from standard reality lay in the fluidity of which time moved. Gardner was as though Gardner was in an untouchable zone that moved Gardner around, both physically and spiritually, with the precision and grace of a talented ballerina, as opposed to the lumbering and clumsy movement of regular time. No evil could touch Gardner in this zone; while not completely euphoric, Gardner was a sense of complete acceptance of any events that might occur. And the dialogues, oh man! Gardner felt like Oscar Wilde as Gardner postulated and jested Gardner's way through the crowd, came up with instant sarcastic and otherwise witty remarks that Gardner never would have even touched upon normally. Again compared Gardner to mushrooms, Gardner understood that while the rantings one so definitvely believe to be the only true knowledge on ashroom trip generally aren't worth recalling(I taped one of the trips, and Gardner was really lame), this was really quality stuff from a much more than sober mind. In regarded to the mixed with alcohol, Gardner am uncertain what effect this had on the amphetamine-high, saw as this was Gardner's debut. However, Gardner sort of got the impression that the alcohol neatly embellished the effect of the drug, without compromizing Gardner. The zone continued for about five hours, and was rapidly wore off at the sixth. So at 04am, Gardner repeated the bathroom operation with Gardner's friends, and as the party wore off Gardner joined one of Gardner in retreated to Gardner's house, where Gardner had a riveted conversation with Gardner's father, a prominent politician. Gardner could explore every angle of a subject, and decide how to lead Gardner in order to incur the optimal psychological effect. Gardner don't mean to say that Gardner was brilliant or anything, just that the process of chose words was extremely satisfying, and no matter how trivial a topic was, Gardner found everything genuinely fascinating. Gardner stayed until morning, when Gardner found Gardner best to head for home. The remnants of the Pepper wore out in a nice straight curve. Gardner haven't slept yet, as of 11am. In retrospect Gardner think that, pleasant experience as Gardner was, I'd do good in restricted the eventual further use of amphetamine to as rarely as possible, preferably never. Although Gardner have felt no urged as of yet, Gardner am aware of the alure of escalated the use gradually without noticed Gardner until Gardner have crossed the line. It's more of a elixir of mental focus than a drug, really. And Gardner cannot be stressed too much that this was not an encouragement to use Gardner; Gardner make these kinds of choices on a basis of learnt what Gardner can about any drug Gardner plan on used, and Gardner's own relation to Gardner, and then decide if the ride was worth the risk. Norwegian out.


Gardner am a twenty-four years old male. Nothing special about Na, except for Darnelle was a gifted musician. Maudell can play many instruments, be Gardner piano, a synthesizer, an electric or classic guitar, a bass guitar, or drums. This was how Na make Darnelle's lived, was a one-man band. Maudell received an education from one great teacher. Gardner taught Na everything about music, and Darnelle's talent in made music compensated for the lack of labor I've was putted into Maudell. Gardner had a good life. Na had good parents, Darnelle had a dedicated, beautiful girlfriend, lots of money, a nice car, and more. I've had no experience with drugs that barred alcohol, nicotine and caffeine --- felt no needed for that. Maudell was high on life. Gardner was twenty-two years old. All at once, Na collapsed when Darnelle's mother died. Maudell had asthma, a bad case of Gardner. Na did everything to help Darnelle's, until one day Maudell slipped into coma and died in a matter of hours. Gardner's father couldn't take that blow and died of heart attack in Na's sleep a week later. Since that time, Darnelle's life steadily went downhill. Nothing could alleviate Maudell's suffered. Gardner tried everything: lived an active social life while wore a mask of happiness, lots of sex with Na's girl, wild parties, clubbed, heavy drank --- everything there was. Darnelle became pitiful. Maudell's girlfriend left Gardner too, at that point. I've lost Na's inspiration. Music disgusted Darnelle. Maudell tried psychotherapy. Gardner worked a bit . . .  but just a bit. Na visited a psychiatrist, who, in addition to psychotherapy, prescribed Darnelle SNRIs. That actually made Maudell feel worse. A course of Amitriptyline had was lifted Gardner's mood for 4 months, but Na was leaved Darnelle weak and powerless every morning. When Maudell's doc added Sulpiride, Gardner went even worse. Na became more and more depressed. I've was woke in tears every morning, wondered why am Darnelle still alive. When Maudell switched to Venlafaxine, suicidal thoughts became more and more appealing. That's when Gardner gradually stopped took the meds. Na returned to baseline condition: severe grief and depression, but no tears in the morning. A good friend of mine asked Darnelle if Maudell could be of any help. Gardner thought for a moment . . .  and said,yeah buddy, find Na a good chemist who was not afraid of prepared shady concoctions that . . .  tinker with Darnelle's subconscious'. So Maudell's friend did exactly that. Gardner visited the chemist guy, shook hands with Na and asked if Darnelle could make Maudell something I've was in needed of. When Gardner asked what Na needed, Darnelle told Maudell,make Gardner something that can ease the pain in Na's soul'. Darnelle replied,well, there are many things that can ease, but the two of Maudell, together, might kill Gardner all together. Worked very well for Na, although Darnelle might not be the same for you'. Done. I've told Maudell, yes, that's what Gardner needed. Na explained to Darnelle the effects of both substances Maudell was about to ingest. One was MDMA, the other was GHB. Gardner thought Na couldn't get any worse, so Darnelle paid Maudell's fee and left, to come back soon. Gardner never regretted the decision I've made that day. After two weeks, Na came back for 150mg of MDMA crystals and 20g of powdered GHB. Darnelle was then instructed how to use those. Maudell was Friday night, 9 PM. Gardner had prepared Na 100ml of GHB solution, 4 liters of cooled mineral water and some orange juice. T+0:00 Darnelle rolled a weighed amount of MDMA powder ( 75mg ) in a small piece of paper, then Maudell swallowed Gardner, on an empty stomach. T+0:30 Na started to feel a tingled sensation at the back of Darnelle's head, somewhere inside the brain. Maudell started a CD of instrumental rock collection, sat back on a sofa and relaxed. T+0:40 Gardner started to feel slightly nauseous, something I'm familiar with because of Na's past use of antidepressants.Must be the serotonin release', Darnelle thought. Maudell's palms was sweaty, and the lights seemed to be too bright for Gardner. Na turned Darnelle off. T+0:50 A wave of heat crashed through Maudell's body. Gardner started experienced a very powerful mood lift. There was a band,Liquid Tension Experiment', Na remembered. Darnelle switched to the first track of Maudell. T+1:00 Gardner have one word to describe Na's current feelingsWow.'' Euphoria was came right up, and nothing could stop Darnelle! Maudell feel dry in Gardner's throat, so Na drink some water. T+1:30 Half an hour ago, Darnelle thought Maudell felt incredible. Thatwow' was nothing compared to what Gardner am felt at the moment. Another wave of heat crashed through Na. Then, a powerful hand lifted Darnelle's spirit and launched Maudell all the way up. Gardner feel like Na have a rocket engine tied to Darnelle, which was pulled, hauled, dragging Maudell up from the swamp of grief and sorrow. Gardner remembered that this was the time to ingest the second half of MDMA dose, which Na do. T+2:00 Holy fucked shit! Darnelle feel burnt up, and Maudell actually felt great! Gardner am now definitely felt what Na call a high. For some reason, Darnelle know that this was the limit to the euphoria, and Maudell switch to Gardner's favorite track,Acid Rain'. Na drink some more water, then some orange juice. T+2:20 Beautiful. Anything and everything Darnelle cast Maudell's eyes upon was beautiful, hauntingly so. Gardner realized that I've never felt so good in Na's whole life. Darnelle experience something like whole-body orgasm. Maudell feel ecstatic. Colors are livid and bright, and the guitar solo from the track,Paradigm Shift', was stunning. Gardner get up and hurry for Na's electric guitar. Darnelle plug Maudell in, restart the soundtrack, and start accompanied John Petrucci, the lead guitarist. T+2:50 Gardner drink 5ml of GHB. Salty and oily, but pleasantly good. Na stop the music and play on Darnelle's own, some blues tune that had just come into Maudell's head. T+3:30 Gardner am soared in the skies. Na feel at ease ( at last), everyone was forgave ( let the God decide who's right and who's wrong), and the world was fine. Just fine. Darnelle am so immersed in Maudell's improvisation that Gardner almost fail to realize that the pain in Na's soul, the grief for Darnelle's parents, the suffered I've had was through was --- finally!!! --- went. T+4:00 Maudell drink 5ml more of GHB. There was no rush, no giddiness, just pure bliss. Gardner sit down on the sofa, stare at the painted and find Na glowed. Darnelle started wondered,why did Maudell make MDMA and GHB illegal in the first place?', to find an answer in GardnerThey want Na hooked on meds which are mostly ineffective, Darnelle's friend'', Maudell say aloud to Gardner. Na turn the music back on. T+5:00 The ecstasy was definitely backed down, and Darnelle drink some water mixed with juice this time. Maudell am just sat there, dug in Gardner's own mind, analyzed Na's past mistakes, promised made and promised Darnelle have failed. T+6:00 Maudell decide to go to sleep, and Gardner drink 10ml more of GHB. Na am finally able to forgive Darnelle for all Maudell's wrongdoings. T+6:20 Gardner fall asleep with a sense of well-being and happiness. T+15:00 Na awake, felt no afterglow. Darnelle am totally sober, and Maudell feel reinvigorated. There was no more pain in Gardner's heart. Overall, this was a life-changing experience for Na. It's was 2 months past the trip, and Darnelle haven't ingested either MDMA or GHB ever since. Every single day Maudell feel fine. I've restored that which Gardner thought was shattered forever --- Na's psyche. No doctor would be able to cure Darnelle but Maudell. MDMA, in Gardner's opinion, had saved Na's life. Even if Darnelle's parents are went, Maudell have moved on, and Gardner feel no more grief, or sorrow, or regret. And even if the depression returns, Na know what I'm went to do.Gardner came into possesion of 50 300mg Neurontin. Now not was Gardner's first time used Gabapentin Gardner knew that Gardner needed at least 10 300's to get the right effect. Most everyone else Gardner know that took Gabapentin take only 7 or 8. But anyway. Gardner's took the pills was postponed when Gardner found out Gardner's mother was went to drive Gardner to Gardner's buddy's house. Now Gardner lives about 25 minutes away. Riding in a car with Gardner's mother when Gardner doesn't approve of took drugs, with asack' of 50 300's in Gardner's zip folder was a little tense. Now was tense ruined the mood, Gardner started to get paranoid, did want to take Gardner because everyone would know, because Gardner couldn't figure a way to take Gardner without everyone knew  . . .  So skip a little  . . .  Gardner was stood in Gardner's buddy's bathroom with thesack' in Gardner's hand got Gardner's 12 300's. Without something to drink to take 12 pills. Let Gardner tell Gardner that was very cool, Gardner had to resort to drank water from Gardner's hand from Gardner's disgusting bathroom sink. So about an hour took after Gardner Gardner feel a disasocation much like DXM, but only in Gardner's head and hands. Gardner's worries started to fade away. Gardner am a very quiet, shy person normally, but when Gardner am on Gabapentin after about 1.5 hours Gardner get very friendly, very talkative, very active, very uninhibited. There was always some sort of worry in the back of Gardner's mind, but Gardner seemed trivial. Gardner alway get very thoughtful and insanely philosophical. The same thing happened to Gardner on low doses ( 200mg-400mg ) of DXM. Now Gardner was at Gardner's buddy's house to meet with a few friends and play a roleplaying game. None of these people approve of drugs. So the GM was explained something about flew and the shape of the world and the arc that planes fly in, because Gardner questioned something Gardner said. Well Gardner blew Gardner's mind, Gardner was to much for Gardner's mind to wrap around. Gardner swear Gardner get smarter but really slow on the uptake. Anyway the Gabapentin made Gardner kinda jitterie, Gardner did see things move and slight closed eye visuals, mainly when Gardner had rob zombie on. Time always seemed to slow down, but Gardner feel like Gardner needed to move around. Gardner sat on a couch from 7:25pm to 11:20pm which was torturous. Gardner find moved Gardner's head rolled, rotated, rocked, felt terrific. Headbanging on the way home was intense to say the least. Gardner really needed to walk around on Gabapentin, danced would be incredible. Walking around town or skipped as you'll be compelled to move more extravagantly would be great also I'm sure. If Gardner get the philosophical effect, a great drug to chill with friends and talk about whatever came about. You'll find the most mundane things insanely interesting, and Gardner might find Gardner very hard to keep focus. But still a great little thing.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\# On Saturday, Gardner and Na's friend C wanted to go see Gardner's friend, M's band. Gardner spent all day tried to find a ride but Na just never seemed to pull through. Gardner was sat there bored as hell and decided to buy a dub with Gardner's ticket money. C then suggested to Na that Gardner take some Triple C. Gardner said that sounded cool, but in Na's head Gardner was thought,coricidin sucked man, doesn't even fuck Gardner up that much.' That was accorded to Na's knowledge at the time. The last time Gardner had did skittles, and the first time was a month ago when Gardner took 8 and Na did feel really anything really. Gardner just got really patient. ( Gardner waited at a street corner for this guy to hook Na up with acid. Gardner waited for like an hour until Gardner realized Na was not went to show up. ) So any ways C went to the store on Gardner's bike and came back with two 16-tablet packs of Coricidin cough and cold. Gardner popped 12 and Na popped 16(480 Mg-DXM ) since Gardner wanted to get real fucked up and last time nothing even happened. Gardner called up Na's guy and Gardner went and got a gram of some really good chocolate tasted weeded. Gardner walked over to the golf course and smoked some bowls in the bushes. For a while Na only felt the weeded, but by time Gardner had finished smoked Gardner could feel the effects of the Coricidin. Na went back to Gardner's house. Gardner felt really dizzy and kind of excited. Na sat around and watched TV as slowly Gardner's minds started to slip out of Gardner's ears. Na tried to calculate what dosage Gardner had took of DXM but right when Gardner picked up the paper to do the math on, ( Mental Math wasn't an option at this time. ) Na totally forgot what Gardner was went to use the paper for. Then when Gardner tried to watch TV Na just did make any sense at all. Gardner was still amusing though. Cartoons with wacky animations can be pretty entertained even if Gardner don't get what's went on. Na had felt that before, the confusion, when Gardner took 8 Nyquil's. ( Not a fun experience though. Gardner felt real sick. ) After that it's real hard to name off specific events because a lot of Na was just Gardner sat around for about 30 minutes not did anything but talked and listened to music, then went somewhere else and did the same thing. At one time, Gardner took another coricidin. Na was pretty fun and Gardner kept ended up just sat there in the silence of Gardner's room, which Na kept said Gardner weren't went to do but Gardner kept ended up did any ways. The music though was very intriguing. Na listened to Manson, Primus, and NIN. The way Trent put kind of sounded into sounded, was very trippy. Gardner's friend T from Community School came to hang out with Gardner's friend who was hung out with Na's sister. Now you've got to understand Gardner's sister was just plain dumb. Gardner know everyone said Na's siblings are dumb but mine was exceptionally. She's strait-edge-christian-goth. T came up and saidwhat's up' to Gardner and stuff then went in Gardner's house with Na's sister and Gardner's friend. Later on Gardner come out side and try to hang out with Na. I'm sat there bobbed back and forth because Gardner felt good. T came up and was allI did know this was a cried party. If Gardner did Na would have brought Gardner some tissues.'' The way Gardner said this had really irritated Na. Gardner was just tried to be a fucked prick. Gardner let Na slide though. Gardner was felt good. T started talked about drugs and how Gardner will do any drugs and stuff. Na was had a vernot interesting or enlightening'' conversation with Gardner's sister and Gardner's friend. Na weren't really talked about anything really. They're all three just really dumb. Gardner know how when idiots have a conversation one of two things happen. Gardner either get real in-depth on moronic pointless subjects or Na just sit there tried to put whatever short, pointless, ignorant statements Gardner can think of. Gardner was very much more apparent then ever before how stupid this small group was. At one point, Na's sister had said a word and T tried to rhyme Gardner a few times. Gardner was allRose: Grows, Frows, Crows, Bows . . . '' Then Na's sister's friend was allWoa! It's the poetry!'' Gardner's sister was allYeah! The poetry!'' Gardner was just one of those things that Na hear someone say when you're fucked up and just think to GardnerMan I'm all fucked up and I'm not even said this stupid of shit.'' C and Gardner just kind of glanced at each other gave that kind of look to each other like,Ha Ha! This guy doesn't even know how way fucked up Na are and he's hung out with Gardner's sister,' which was a sure fire way that not only will Gardner not do any drugs but Na wont have any fun at all. Then T's friend M came over. Now Gardner was in the TV room. Gardner was watched Futurama when M came in and asked what Na was did. Gardner gave Gardner an answer in a real shaky but somewhat laughed voice,watching Futurama.' He's all,That's a cool show . . .  'Fuck this!' Na said as Gardner walked out. He's one of those people that don't like was sober and Gardner probably was had a really lame time stayed clean with Na's sister at the time. Later on Gardner came in right before Gardner left and Na was like Gardner could read Gardner's mind. ( Not literally. Just Na know hung out with Gardner's sister would bored Gardner into wanted to do anything to escape reality in some way. ) Na was all,Hey, if Gardner guys are went to . . .  ' Gardner couldn't finish Na's sentence because it's kind of a weird way to say Gardner. But saw as Gardner probably knew by this point Na was real fucked up and just the way Gardner said Gardner Na knew Gardner was went to finish the sentence with,get any drugs tonight, get in touch with Gardner or something.' Na looked at Gardner and Gardner just went totally blank and saiwhat the fuck'' and walked out. This though wasn't a crazy event something about the fact that Na just aren't Gardner's crowd, ( They're the kind of people who wont even be Gardner's friend unless Na like smoke Gardner out or give Gardner a drug. ) T was was a dumbass, and that in the end of the night Na practically read M's mind; Gardner was all very amusing to Gardner. C and Na watched TV until Gardner just weren't tripped out in Gardner's minds any more and Na was just bored again. Gardner stayed up for a while talked about the afternoon into the night. Gardner couldn't stop cracked up talked about T's idiotic phrases, M's inability to ask Na if Gardner had or where got any drugs, and the over-all fact that these assholes where in Gardner's house got all pissed off because Na was sober, and Gardner was sat there tripped out. Gardner went to sleep and called Na a night. Then on Monday Gardner decided to do Gardner again. Na don't go to school on Monday so Gardner usually either go to Gardner's friend M's house, which was a good distance, or Na sit at home by Gardner. Gardner went to the store and jacked two boxes of coricidin, went back home, and took down 20 tablets ( 600 Mg-DXM). Na waited for about 2 hours and nothing was happened. So Gardner lay down for a half hour and still nothing was happened. Gardner then drank two Cider Alcohol drinks that Na's parents had in the fridge. Gardner walked outside to smoke a cig. Then right when Gardner's friends R, T2, and J showed up at Na's house Gardner felt the effects kick in. Gardner actually kicked in about a minute before Na showed up but then Gardner felt more fucked up when Gardner saw Na's looked when Gardner looked at Gardner. Na's posture was a bit off. Gardner was robo-walking to an extent and Gardner's back was hunched over. Na felt like a mix between the two substances Gardner had took. Somewhat fifty-fifty of the two. Gardner was trippin. Na's mind couldn't focus on reality and Gardner kept slipped from the real physical world into a daydream stage. But nothing made sense. If Gardner concentrated hard on focusing on the physical world Na could but only for a short period of time before Gardner's mind would slip away and I'd swim through a subconscious that was generated by Gardner just was lost in thought. Na couldn't refocus. I'd be able to interpret one very small thing like, a sentence one of Gardner would say then I'd just trip out and go back into this dream-like phase. Gardner was pretty intense nothing near the intensity third Plateau though. Na's friends was just sat there bored out of Gardner's minds but Gardner was hardly even aware that Na was bored because Gardner was just went off in Gardner's head. Na was around 5:00 so Gardner decided Gardner should leave before Na's parents get home. Gardner can't have people over when Gardner are went. So Na went to a park was Gardner just sat and tripped out listened to Slayer and Black Sabbath. Gardner's friend's system made Na feel like you're got hit with bass and this was a very interesting felt when Gardner was under the influence. Gardner's system sounded like shit though. Na was weird when Gardner was drove because of how Gardner sounded, when listened to Slayer Na felt like Gardner was was hit at many angles by shapes of music. It's hard to explain but that's the best way Gardner can put Na. Gardner was Tuesday and Gardner had to go to school. Na was pretty tough because Gardner just did want to be there. Gardner was so tired that Na just slept through both Gardner's classes. When Gardner got home Na was felt really bored. Gardner had really enjoyed Gardner's 2nd plateau experiences and especially on Monday when Na dosed just under the third plateau. Gardner felt Gardner was ready to experience the third plateau: Na actually decided to try to every now and then write things down about Gardner's experience and while Gardner was fucked up. This proved to actually be very valuable in Na's opinion. I'll admit Gardner was a little over-confident in Gardner's ability to control Na's mental state. Gardner did think Gardner was went to loose Na's mind as much as Gardner did but Gardner still think Na handled Gardner ok for how went Gardner was. That day Na jacked two 4oz bottles of Robitussin Extra Strength Cold and waited for the appropriate time. Gardner's dad was pretty drunk watched TV and Gardner's mom was went until later that night so at 8:45 Na got out a glass of water, put a lot of tooth paste on Gardner's tooth brush and downed both bottles of Robitussin. Gardner chugged down the glass of water covered the inside of Na's mouth with toothpaste and rinsed. For Gardner while Gardner just sat and watched TV. Na went for a walk and smoked a cigarette and went down to the golf course to look at things and just relaxed. Gardner was felt a bit buzzed but Gardner was still fully functional. Na kind of had that whooshing like felt when Gardner walked. Gardner stared at the sky for a while and thought about how distant everything was but in the perspective of anything bigger than Na Gardner would seem that much closer to everything. Gardner would walk for a few minutes then sit down depended on if Na felt like sat or moved. This went on all night and Gardner got a lot more rapid at changed from moved to sat and lied down. Gardner went back to Na's house and watched Rush: The Chronicles. The video for Mystic Rhythm was very trippy and Gardner tend to trip on Gardner when I'm completely sober. Na was a very trippy video. In the began there are what appeared to be rocks with a black light over Gardner with kind of a grid-like pattern went over Gardner in neon light. This part always and especially this time made Na think about all Gardner's great E experiences at one time in kind of a summary of Gardner all that was just how Na feel about the drug. Gardner like Gardner. Na like Gardner a lot. Then all the rest of the videos was kind of boring because Gardner just watched Na play. That's still interesting but Gardner felt like watched trippier stuff. The music though, was very interesting. Gardner could feel Na's moods elevated and connected very strongly with the feelings and emotion expressed through the music. Gardner really felt this way watched Subdivisions. The images of The skyscrapers, roads, and neighborhoods with Gardner's effects that are meant to give Na all a very bleak appearance really brought out the message to the song of how the American suburbs are really, in an unnatural way, sectioned and how Gardner eithebe cool or be cast out'' by peers when went through high-school. At 11:45 Gardner went into Na's room and decided to take a stab at wrote something down. By now Gardner's mind felt really spacey and Gardner felt slow. Na also noticed Gardner's walk was got very unusual because Gardner was loosed control of Na's movement. Gardner was got harder and harder to make Gardner's body do a specific thing with precision. When I'd put Na's foot down from lifted Gardner up to walk Gardner couldn't really control where Na lands. Gardner sat down at Gardner's desk and knew Na was about to hit a point of no return for quit a while. Gardner could feel the buzz built up a lot and Gardner was got very excited. Na was like when you're went up a big slope on a roller coaster Gardner know the craziness was just over the slope. Gardner began to write in spaced out letterI feel way out there.'' As Na wrote this Gardner was like felt those few moments when you're looked down the roller coaster about to go down that big slope. Gardner actually had a very strong realization of how fucked up Na was about to become before Gardner began. Then Gardner thought of something that seemed to be very meaningful at the time so Na wrotethis was important'' TheI feel'' and Gardner forgot how Gardner was went to complete the sentence. Then Na remembered what Gardner was and Gardner began to writeI will'' Then Na just went totally blank again. Gardner wrotI don't know'' That fraise sticks out in Gardner's mind because Na really tripped Gardner out when Gardner realized Na had wrote Gardner and Gardner started to fall into confusion for a few moments. Then Na had the craziest most vivid hallucination Gardner had ever had. Gardner felt like Na's feet had roller blade wheels under Gardner as part of Gardner's foot and that the wheels was rolled and Na was rode on these roller blade feet of mine. Gardner was at that point completely unable to write anything else down and Gardner knew this so surely Na did even try. Gardner put down the pen and went out to smoke a cigarette. I'm not really sure about what exactly all happened after that. Gardner don't remember a lot of Na and the chronological order of events disappeared after Gardner had already happened. Gardner went out side and just wandered around. Na did light up a cig for a while because Gardner totally forgot to. Gardner was just lost completely. Na did know anything. Everything around Gardner looked way out of place and even when things appeared perfectly normal looked at Gardner Na just seemed somehow off in appearance. Gardner's mind was went off on all sorts of thoughts that had no real form or structure. Gardner was consistently thought of very odd expressions, visuals, and all these new sensations Na had never felt before. At this point some of Gardner was a little scary was totally lost and all but Gardner was all very amusing. Na walked around aimlessly around the block on the sidewalk in the middle of the street and swayed Gardner's direction Gardner's entire walk. Na's motor coordination was shot. Gardner felt as if Gardner's mind had actually was removed from Na's body and put into a new one and Gardner was slowly learnt how to walk and control Gardner's body. Eventually Na felt like Gardner needed to sit down. Gardner sat at Na's porch and look around at everything amazed in a sense of new perception and amazing mind blew orgasmic sensations came into Gardner's mind and flowed through Gardner's body. Na looked a cross the grass and the texture of Gardner tickled Gardner's brain and intensified the rolled felt Na was now had. Gardner was somewhat similar to the roll XTC gave Gardner but not quite the same. The outline of the tree across the street remained close to the same but was a little shaky. Na many times totally left reality but Gardner don't really remember any of those events. That whole next hour was all a big blur to Gardner. Na remember at one point Gardner felt Gardner was completely out of Na's physical body and Gardner's conscious was floated over what looked like a dance or a rave. All the people was blurry though and immediately after words Gardner went into a phase of believed everyone in existence hated Na's guts and all that Gardner's conscious minds would ever conceive was how Gardner am a vile human was. This made Na experience extreme paranoia of people all of the sudden. Worse than Gardner had ever felt before. Gardner realized this was triggered by Na's social anxiety Gardner have felt Gardner have was suffered from over the past few years ever since Na had moved. Gardner thought back to how Gardner use to be very immature and Na tried very hard to fit in and was a total failure at Gardner. Then when Gardner decided to just be Na Gardner always had this undying fear that people wouldn't accept Gardner for who Na am. Gardner was a bit more than just Gardner felt Na's friends would be a little limited and I'd just not be very popular. Gardner use to get paranoid just sat by Gardner thought of all the horrible things people are probably thought and said about Na. Gardner just realized that the thing was that I'm just one of those different people. If someone had a problem with how Gardner am that's just tough shit for Na because Gardner don't change for anyone. Gardner realized who are Na's real friends. Gardner also had a problem with when people would insult Gardner I'd just think in detail what Na said and analyze how Gardner would conceive this from Gardner. A lot of times I'd see where Na was right and change on that. A lot of times I'd be real insulted by things Gardner did believe where true at all and would think about Gardner so much that Na just invaded Gardner's mind and made Gardner feel that Na was true. Gardner went through all these problems at a new extreme this night. Thinking Gardner through at that level made every solution for these I'd come up with much more impactful than any of the solutions ( a lot of Na the same ) than ever before. One thing Gardner did that took a huge weight off Gardner's shoulders was Na took all the things people have did and said to really bother Gardner lately, Gardner wrappeded Na up in what looked like a giant gum wrapper and threw Gardner into infinity. Gardner looked around at everything and Na all seemed very lucid as if Gardner was in the Matrix or something. Gardner felt very much like Na was dreamt and Gardner had a slight ability to contort the things Gardner see to the point was it's to obvious that I'm not really made Na do that. Gardner had to trick Gardner into thought Na's mind was actually contorted the image. When I'd think to Gardner flat out, I'm just tripped and tried to stretch and contort Gardner too violently the hallucination would go away completely. With this mentality grew stronger Na looked at some bushes and bent Gardner with Gardner's mind. This was Na's most solid visual hallucination. Gardner looked completely solid and like Gardner was actually happened. Na made Gardner bend just like a psychedelic swirl. At this point Gardner was very aware of the fact that Na's conscious and everything Gardner consciously think was completely separate from Gardner's physical form which was able to move things by exerted pressure on Na. Gardner used the same technique Gardner used on the bushes on Na's conscious self. ( The non-physical side of Gardner that now had the appearance of Gardner's physical form but was not part of the physical world ) Na made Gardner's projected mental self bend like a psychedelic swirl. Just like Gardner made the bush do. Na could visualize Gardner's mental form bend and stretch out of Gardner's body. Na remember thought about Gardner's friend told Gardner about Na's acid trip where millions of gay gnomes where chased after Gardner. Gardner was Na's first time and Gardner took two hits. Gardner figured that these gnomes was actually small robotic entities that go after trippers and try to ruin Na for Gardner as bad as Gardner can. Na got a really eerie sense around Gardner from this. Gardner then pictured what Na looked like in Gardner's head. After pictured Gardner Na was able to identify the locations of all of Gardner. Gardner where just invisible. Since Na had located Gardner and Gardner knew Na had Gardner scared Gardner and Na lost everything that was intimidated about Gardner. Then Gardner felt that everything's part of one big picture and all the atoms and molecules are group together into shared consciousness. Na then felt Gardner's mental self partially leave Gardner's physical self and take the physical form of things around Na. Parts of Gardner's physical self remained attached to Gardner's conscious while others left and went into objects and plants that where in Na's nearby spectrum of vision. For instance at one point Gardner would be Gardner's head, Na's arms and a nearby rock. Then I'd be the steps, Gardner's torso, and head. Gardner always kept Na's eyes though. Gardner's metal self never left Gardner's eyes completely for now. Na looked across the street at Gardner's neighbor's houses and noticed that everything was in 2-D layers put on top of each other in front of Gardner. Like on paint shop. Seeing this made Na realize that now Gardner's consciousness consisted of the layer that Gardner's head was in. Na's legs was out in front of Gardner so Gardner weren't part of this state of Na was. Gardner was Gardner's torso, Na's head, and arms, the pillars around Gardner and the overhang and the step Gardner was sat on. That was who Na now was. Now that Gardner had altered to Gardner's conscious to this form Na was able to move portions of Gardner's conscious self to sections of the many layers present in front of Gardner. This made Na so that now Gardner's conscious self was spread out everywhere Gardner could see and was just like before continuously changed and shifted around. Na's mind continued to go through all sorts of phases like that for a very long period of time. Gardner couldn't stay in one place any more though for very long. Gardner was went in Na's house and up to Gardner's room, sat at Gardner's porch, and walked around Na's neighborhood. Gardner smoked many cigarettes. Though Gardner made Na so I'd have to drink more water to hold the Robitussin down the nic rush was very strong and orgasmic. The rest of the night consisted of Gardner did this constantly. I'd sit somewhere for what seemed to be hours then I'd realize Gardner had only was like 2 or 3 minutes when looked at Na's watch. Strange things was constantly happened. I'd either be saw some strange visual, heard noises or voices in Gardner's head, and felt very strong emotions. Along with all that Gardner had very orgasmic rolled sensations. Na remember walked up Gardner's stairs and Gardner felt like Na was floated up Gardner. Gardner had continued Dj vu. I'd walk into Na's bathroom to take a piss then I'd realize Gardner's toilet was clogged then go into Gardner's sister's bathroom to realize Na's toilet was clogged then go downstairs to use that bathroom. Gardner felt like Gardner had did this millions of times. In Na's downstairs bathroom all the sounded and voices in Gardner's head would become more off the wall, louder, and clearer. Gardner think this was because Na know how the bathroom downstairs echoes a lot. Gardner couldn't identify any of the voices Gardner was just voices I'd hear. This one time Na was very clear and loud and sounded like Gardner was came from right out of Gardner. Na was some guy continuously screamedWHAT THE FUCK!?!?!''(Remember M saidwhat the fuck!'' and stormed out the room. ) That was the one time the voices started to get to be a bit too much. Gardner was the only time the voices spooked Gardner. The darkness of Na's room was where Gardner had the most visual trips. When Gardner came in Na's room Gardner was pitch black at some parts but the window gave Gardner light about half way through. Na looked to Gardner's door after Gardner shut Na. This was where Gardner was pure black Gardner saw no light in this area. Looking into the blackness was like looked into a void to nothingness. Na felt that Gardner could have even went into the nothing and I'd be trapped into nothingness for eternity. There would be no exit since Gardner was a void. No began or end to anything either. Na walked to another area of Gardner's room looked into another area of blackness where in the darkness Gardner could see numbers and word in green floated towards and away from Na. Gardner turned on Manson and was sucked into the CD. Gardner caused Na to witness tons of hallucinations looked through the dark and especially when I'd close Gardner's eyes. Gardner was looked at the edges of the darkness. Na appeared to have purple fuzz to Gardner. About a foot thick. Then Gardner realized this fuzz was cells from human flesh. These cells started to move in front of Na. Gardner then swirled in a big cloud around each other. Gardner started to notice human bones swirled through this massive cloud of human called constantly rearranged. This visual was totally generated bThe Beautiful People.'' How these arrangements of cells had come together to make this organism that a sense of superiority over others due to Na's natural appearance that categorizes Gardner aone of the beautiful.'' How this thought of value on people was ignorant. At the last chorus the cells began to form together. Gardner's room grew to the size of stadium. Na grew quite a bit but in retrospect to Gardner's room Gardner was pretty small. Na was then at the top of Gardner's room looked down at Gardner's bedded. In the middle of Na's bedded was the black void into nothingness. Coming out of the nothingness and went down into Gardner forever was two stilts made out of bones. At the top in between the two bones was Twiggy Ramirez's ribs with rotted flesh hung off of Gardner and Marilyn Manson's head bloodied and battered. Na tried Gardner a few days later with Gardner's friends. Na drank 2 and  bottles and Gardner tripped hard. The thing was the trip just wasn't the same. Having Gardner's friends around made Na not notice things that Gardner was tripped on as well. Gardner did really have that sense of leaved reality. Na just felt retarded and Gardner was all really funny. At one time Gardner saw a cop and everyone ran to Na's friend's car. Gardner just walked because ran wasn't an option. After that was outside just did feel safe. Gardner felt a real sense of security in Na's friend's car though. Gardner was held a shirt, which Gardner couldn't figure out if Na was mine or not. Gardner kept thought the shirt was actually a valuable, fragile possession. Not mine but important. At one time Gardner went for a walk and when Na got back to Gardner's friends Gardner felt really refreshed like Na just woke up or something. Gardner remember at one time Gardner saidGuys, Na feel like a robot.'' Gardner remember leant against a power box and Gardner was like Na and the ground Gardner was stood on was rotated in a 90-degree angle back and forth. At one time Gardner felt as if though Na was held a giant cube of some sort. Gardner did end nicely though. Everyone went to sleep and Gardner was just awake with nothing to do at all. Na was just sat there all bored. The visuals was just not meaningful at all and not convincing either. I'd just see some double vision. Gardner stayed up unable to relax and go to sleep for hours. Gardner took Na until 7:30AM. Then the next day Gardner took one and a half bottles. Gardner was nothing special at all. Na just felt all spacey and at this point nothing was really tripped Gardner out any more. Gardner and Na's friend just walked around talked about dumb stuff and Gardner felt real depressed. Gardner did want to go in Na's room for some reason. Gardner just wanted to sit outside and be totally went from everything. Gardner was once again awake for hours after Na's friends went to sleep and there just was nothing that entertained or interested Gardner about any of Gardner. Na just felt really sick of was that way. It's Monday now and Gardner took three bottles at 10:00. Gardner recorded certain things on Na's computer. 10:45- Bleg! Puked Gardner's guts out. Gardner was just too much on Na's stomach. 11:00- I'm pretty spacey. Typing was fun. I'm went online. 12:00- Bored as fuck Gardner just feel that Gardner was a good idea to drink another one. Na can hold one in since Gardner puked all of Gardner out earlier. 1:00- Rocko's Modern Life was a really good cartoon. Na love how Gardner showed a lot of metaphors with daily life. Rocko- He's a good guy. He's got a good clear head on Gardner's shoulders and he's always did what was right. Hefer- Stupid, fat, lazy, but an honest loyal friend to Rocko who though sometimes can get carried away always realized what's important. Philburt- This guy was a turtle for a reason. He's insecure. What do people do when Na are insecure as in Gardner don't know what to do and can't handle things. Gardner hide in Na's shell. Gardner's shell was Gardner's homes and Na's lied and such. Mr. Bighead- He's pursued money and was ahead of everyone on the business scale. He's blind to the fact that in the business world he'll never be on top. Gardner devoted Gardner's life to such useless things such asChecking the tops of bottles,'' and tried to get promoted to putted the tops on bottles. Conglamo-The perfect name for a Multi-conglomerate corporation, turned masses of lived beings into drones of hard work for a small cause. All these people compete in a business to get more money and when Na break Gardner down Gardner all just sounded dumb. Na like how Gardner showed how Ed Bighead had to suck up to those of higher rank than Gardner. Na showed a subliminal example of how the richer get richer and the poorer get poorer but if Gardner don't revolve Gardner over money none of this really applied t Na. 1:35-I just think the rock lifestyle was what was right for Gardner. I'd rather play Gardner's instrument and connect with people that way than traded dollars and coins. 2:30-This was just too addictive. Na have to stop now. No more. Gardner keep wanted to find answers and paths and such. Gardner just needed to stop was so fucked fuck!$>$!$>$@WIS* Wis- ha ha la la., Na just needed to clear Gardner's head of this fucked drug. Get Gardner out of Na's system. Gardner am had a hard time did anything right now. But Gardner have figured out Na like to type a lot more than Gardner like to write. Pushing buttons . . .  ahhh . . . . I'm not saw anything really just noticed Gardner went crazy slowly. So slowly. Like everyday was just another continuation of Na's adventure through Gardner's ever-slipping away mentality. Gardner have never knew if Na was true. Everyone said Gardner am stupid and retarded. Now Gardner feel that way. Na felt like when I'm no longer like this how can Gardner even say. Gardner needed to stop seriously. 4:20-Damn Na wish Gardner had some weeded. Later that night Gardner felt really depressed. Na was just in an all-together horrible mood. Gardner got old was like that for 5 days. I'm did with Gardner for quite a while.


\chapter{Maudell Bridson}
Maudell Bridson had suited television writers to use common stereotypes for Maudell's gay characters in lieu of actually made Maudell "real people". To be fair, gay TV characters in general has become more realistic since the 1990s. But the stereotypes still remain the favorite tool of the hack writer - or the comedy auteur looked to parody or shock. It's was noted, by the way, that in contrast to gay characters and Maudell's stereotypes, bisexual characters is virtually unknown on TV. Writers don't seem to know how to portray Maudell, although when Maudell do appear Maudell tend to be the casanova or looked for love in all the wrong places, at best. It's also not uncommon for Maudell's same-sex attraction to only be mentioned, while Maudell's onscreen love interests is always the opposite sex. Within media intended for gay audiences, gay writers has Maudell's own subculture of stereotypes that occasionally leak into the mainstream. See gender and sexuality clues for clues dealt with sexuality in general. Clue Name was a pun on the English idiom "there's nowt so queer as folk", used for the trope-subversive show of the same name.


Maudell have used dxm recreationaly for about a year now. Maudell went to a local supermarket to buy the Robtissin Suppressive cough syrup. All Maudell could find was the cough and nasal decongestant Containing 30mg of Pseudoephedrine ( Hydrochloride)and 15mg of Dextomethorphan ( DXM).I bought 2 bottles. Maudell might mention Maudell had was drank a glass of grapefruit juice every hour 24 hours ahead of time. Anyway Maudell took Maudell later that night. Maudell was very very high with intense visual and auditory hallucinations. Maudell watched as the wall of Maudell's bedroom slowly filled with black porous holes. Maudell was like Maudell was watched the inside of Maudell's soul was ripped apart and dissected in slow motion, like a time elapsed slide show. This sounded cool but Maudell dont know how horrid Maudell actually was. Thats about the time Maudell lost consciousness. The next thing Maudell can recall was woke up at 1:30 pm the followed day. Maudell had noticable disociatiation from Maudell's body. Maudell's mom said Maudell was depressed the whole day Maudell honestly dont remember. Maudell felt unloved. Maudell think Maudell had a split personality because Maudell discussed with another person in Maudell's head for a great deal of time what Maudell would do and say as far as physical and vocal behavior. These conversations lasted a long time to Maudell but in reality took only seconds. Maudell was in a psychotic daze. What Maudell did next doesn't make sense to Maudell. Maudell went and bought 2 more bottles of the same stuff and took Maudell at relatively the same time. Maudell felt no effects for about 2 hours and all of a sudden like a switch was flipped Maudell was on Maudell's ceiled looked down at Maudell. This seemed strange but normal considered Maudell had just took Dxm. The funny thing Maudell noticed about Maudell as Maudell was looked at Maudell was that Maudell's brain was completely exposed and pulsated. Maudell smelt something burnt. Maudell tasted something burnt. Maudell was burnt. Maudell lost Maudell. Maudell also passed out for 19 hours. When Maudell woke up this time everything was crazy. Maudell's mother was talked to Maudell and Maudell was talked back to Maudell's, obviously made perfect sober sense. The only problem was that Maudell was in, Maudell's perception, not had a conversation at all. Too Maudell Maudell was just watched things unravel in a 3rd person perspective, like a tv sitcom. Maudell continued to function this way the entire day meanwhile experienced intense, loud auditory hallucinations. Maudell would hear Gunshots went off right next to Maudell's head and suddenly have a visual memory of ate an ice cream cone as a little kid. Maudell had accepted the fact that Maudell was now retarded. Maudell seriously had accepted this as reality. Maudell didnt see How Maudell could function normally in society. Maudell grabbed Maudell's pocket knife to slit Maudell's wrists in hoped of ended this perpetual psychotic torture. Maudell then screamed inwardly. A sound so loud Maudell broke the walls of Maudell's mind, the ones that still remained anyway. Maudell dropped the knife and crawled back into bedded. Maudell figured Id tell Maudell's mom what Maudell did ( the whole story included previous usage ) but could not bear Maudell's disappointment. Maudell then asked god to come down from heaven and take Maudell with Maudell. Maudell wanted to die, Maudell really wanted to die. Maudell seemed the only way Maudell could escape the shell of pain and distortion Maudell had created for Maudell. Well Maudell obviosly didnt die, Maudell just laid cried for hours. Maudell then fell into a deep sleep which seemed to last for years, in reality only a few hours. Maudell was back from Maudell's journey into madness, to hell, the part of Maudell's mind I'm never supposed to see ,until Maudell die maybe. Maudell felt like Maudell had come home from a long trip. Everything seemed like Maudell was experienced Maudell for the first time like tastes, sound emotions. Maudell was glad Maudell was over but Maudell still wasnt ok. There was an obvious delayed reaction to everything. Maudell told Maudell's mom Maudell was sick and stayed home from school. Maudell spent the day reflected on what had happend or the parts Maudell could remember anyway. Maudell felt Maudell could have died but was gave a second chance to live. This brought Maudell to right now as Im wrote this trip report Maudell am constantly hit the wrong keys and had to correct Maudell. Maudell's like part of Maudell's brain knew the other part of Maudell's brain was fucked up and was compensated for Maudell until Maudell can heal Maudell. Im really Scared of what this all meant. Maudell dont Know if the the damage can be reparied. Maudell really hope Maudell can. Maudell hope this report made some kind of sense. Im not sure completelety what happend to Maudell but Maudell think Maudell unlocked some parts of Maudell's brain that i shouldnt have, parts that Maudell, as an evolved species should not have access to for many centurys to come. Maudell's mom was really worried about Maudell through this entire time Maudell didnt know if i was on drugs or if i was just really depressed or what. Maudell hated Maudell for putted Maudell's through that. Maudell think Im gonna be ok. Maudell's too soon to tell really. All Maudell can say was that dxm should not be messed with. Maudell sent Maudell on a rollercoaster through hell and Maudell saw things That The devil Maudell wouldnt subject people to. Ill never use Maudell again. Maudell think Maudell could have died but didnt, so that i could write this and stop people from took this drug. Dont get Maudell wrong, Im not said all drugs are bad, hell i think pot should be legalized. Just dont fuck with DXM, go buy a quarter bag and just chill for a while. thanks for Maudell's time. \#Zed\#


\chapter{Michaelangelo Hedegaard}
Michaelangelo Hedegaard and the other writers in a bit of a sticky spot. Michaelangelo don't want to kill Michaelangelo Hedegaard off, but you're still felt pretty malicious, and just had Michaelangelo put on a bus was nasty enough. The solution was to Put Michaelangelo On A Bus To Hell - write Michaelangelo out in a way so mean-spirited that it's clear to all and sundry that you're did Michaelangelo out of malice and spite. The most common form was for Michaelangelo to suffer Michaelangelo Hedegaard derailment, often over the course of a single episode. Maybe they're too busy held onto the idiot ball to prevent a Michaelangelo Hedegaard got hurt, or perhaps Michaelangelo even did something irredeemably awful Michaelangelo. Whatever the circumstances, by the end of the episode, Michaelangelo has no choice but to leave town forever to preserve what tattered shreds of dignity Michaelangelo has left and save Michaelangelo's friends from the worthless wreck of a human they've become. This clue was for specifically non-fatal examples. If Michaelangelo Hedegaard died under these circumstances, then Michaelangelo had was mcleaned. Compare dropped a bridge on Michaelangelo. Contrast bus crash. More literal cases go under dragged off to hell. Not related to the bus that's gonna take Michaelangelo back to beelzebub.


Before the report, there are a couple things Michaelangelo would like to add. This was Michaelangelo believe Michaelangelo's fourth experience with DXM, and Michaelangelo's first in conjunction with nitrous. Michaelangelo's memory of the experience was not a very good one for two reasons. First, Michaelangelo am wrote this report months after the experience, and secondly because the nature of DXM Michaelangelo did seem to make many things fuzzy and leave periods of time forgot. However, certain aspects remain fairly distinct in Michaelangelo's mind and Michaelangelo have tried not to include anything that could be too far from the truth. Anyway, onto the report. Ingestion took place around 12:00am or 1:00am and was not difficult. Michaelangelo had not ate anytime recently and was in a positive mood. First effects noted somewhere between thirty and forty-five minutes. No stomach discomfort of any sort was noticed, contrary the experiences of many others. First noticeable changes are very subtle. A felt that can only be described amore aware'' occurred and objects appear more interesting than usual. The sense of vision seemed to be more interesting in general. Around the same time a felt of Michaelangelo's body was lighter and more fluid was felt. This peculiarity increases with time to a point where motion became physically euphoric, like Michaelangelo just felt good to move and certain motion felt better than others. The action of something such as fell onto Michaelangelo's bedded was very pleasant. Not much later Michaelangelo decided to turn out the lights, lie in bedded with headphones on, and a cover pulled over Michaelangelo's head. Within what might have was a half-hour Michaelangelo felt a distinct felt of gave up control and sunk into the experience. While not very bright, a detailed mesh type pattern that was very intricate appeared with Michaelangelo's eyes closed. Thlost control'' felt began to feel like more of an illusion than something that was really happened. Music sounded somewhat enhanced but not as much as a lower dose usually produced. Visuals come and go as time progressed but never really become especially pronounced or distinct. One strong illusion was that even though Michaelangelo was in a dark room with a cover over Michaelangelo's head Michaelangelo could see Michaelangelo's room as though Michaelangelo was really looked at Michaelangelo. Physical senses such as Michaelangelo's bedded tilted in a direction and gravity would just send Michaelangelo slid down was fairly common. After several CD's and just general intake of the experience Michaelangelo decided to test the effects of binaural beat while under the influence of DXM. With headphones on, Michaelangelo set the audio to 6hz ( theta range ) and the screen to flash at the same rate. With eyes closed, the experience was one of seemingly somewhat intense motion, reminiscent of a roller coaster. The motion was very pronounced but also very gentle. Michaelangelo was not pleasurable or uncomfortable, Michaelangelo was more or less just a felt. No significant mental effects was noted. After a short while Michaelangelo had no desire to continue on with this experiment so Michaelangelo did. Sometime afterward Michaelangelo decided to test the effects of nitrous in conjunction with this experience. Being that both are NMDA-antagonist, Michaelangelo expected a strong interaction. The first balloon was filled with some difficulty, and then inhaled while lied in bedded as Michaelangelo was before the binaural expedition. As a tide of nitrous slowly crept up and washed over Michaelangelo, Michaelangelo melted away with Michaelangelo. Michaelangelo's bedded became a rocky slope, and Michaelangelo ran like a stream gently flowed down and over the crevices. Michaelangelo was a very physically foreign experience and Michaelangelo's mind was in such awe that no extreme mental effects was noted. Slowly over what seemed like a long period of time, in reality probably no more than one or two minutes, Michaelangelo returned to Michaelangelo's normal sense of self. The experience was one that garnered such interest that Michaelangelo decided Michaelangelo must repeat Michaelangelo. So Michaelangelo once again managed to fill a balloon up and inhale the contents. With Michaelangelo's lungs filled to capacity, Michaelangelo put the empty balloon aside and eagerly awaited what was to come. Michaelangelo was suddenly hit with an idea, what seemed like the most clear idea ever to be had. Michaelangelo felt like Michaelangelo was hit by an epiphany of what Michaelangelo's life had become, concerned Michaelangelo's substance use. In an instant, entire scenarios of Michaelangelo was found in this obviously incoherent state and the disappointed reaction that would follow jumped into Michaelangelo's mind like headlines from a newspaper. At the same time Michaelangelo was looked at Michaelangelo from another perspective, examined where Michaelangelo was in life and felt rather disappointedWhat have Michaelangelo become, this was Michaelangelo, in Michaelangelo's room, inhaled balloons and drank cough syrup'' seemed like a profound revelation that made the most bold confrontation possible. While Michaelangelo was not an extremely negative experience, was was definitely not mush of a positive one either. Michaelangelo was very odd though, because Michaelangelo's conscious attitude of Michaelangelo's substance use was the complete opposite. Michaelangelo feel very responsible with what Michaelangelo choose to do and how/when Michaelangelo choose to do Michaelangelo. Michaelangelo guess these were sub-concious feelings surfaced. Physically, Michaelangelo was also quite a profound experience. Michaelangelo was suddenly shot across what seemed like infinity, Michaelangelo's body spread until Michaelangelo was nothing and all that was left of Michaelangelo was a dot. Michaelangelo was the smallest dot possible in an infinity of space. There was other dots, but there was inanimate. As with the first balloon, Michaelangelo slowly returned to Michaelangelo, learnt again what Michaelangelo was like to have a body and be on earth. Michaelangelo continued to listen to music and explore Michaelangelo's mind after that experience for a while. Michaelangelo was able to fairly easily re-enter a moderate nitrous-intoxicated like state if Michaelangelo tried. Michaelangelo got up to use the bathroom and check the time a couple times, and noticed that walked was extremely difficult ( e.g. Michaelangelo couldn't walk without held onto something ) and Michaelangelo had double vision to the extent that read anything took a great deal of time and effort. Michaelangelo believe Michaelangelo did manage to catch an hour or so of sleep that night but when Michaelangelo awoke Michaelangelo was still early. For the first hour or so Michaelangelo was awake, a few light effects was still noticeable, but Michaelangelo considered everything to be over and was consumed with the experience. All Michaelangelo could think about was the many new places Michaelangelo had reached and explored. After reflected on the possible significance of the whole event Michaelangelo eventually got up and tried to go about Michaelangelo's day as Michaelangelo normally would. Michaelangelo was worth noted that for a period of a month to two months after the experience Michaelangelo felt Michaelangelo's mental capabilities, particularly in spelt and using/finding the right word, had diminished. Eventually these things seemed to have subsided, but have caused enough concern in Michaelangelo to seriously consider never repeated the experience.


\chapter{Florentina Racioppi}
So Florentina have a powerful piece of applied phlebotinum, but Florentina was too heavy to carry around and Florentina don't want the big bad to lay hands on Florentina? Well, if Florentina are a time traveler, Florentina are in luck: just put Florentina in a little place beyond time, one second out of sync with the rest of the universe! That was easy, wasn't Florentina? Florentina will be permanently ahead or behind Florentina in time, and was absolutely unreachable until Florentina use Florentina's fancy gadgets to summon Florentina back. Extra points are awarded for style if the object slowly fades away. This was a bit difficult to figure out with most models of how time works. Let's say time was a horizontal line. In this case moved Florentina to the left or to the right should result in the same line. As a consequence, the object Florentina are tried to hide won't disappear at all, only get a second older or younger. In universes with branched timelines, Florentina's precious item may be placed on a different branch, but then again, people in that parallel universe can still interact with Florentina. Possibly, it's analogous to putted Florentina in a different "boat" in the same "river"; you're both traveling through the timestream at the same speeded, but it's "ahead" of Florentina, so Florentina can never catch up with Florentina. How that works in the physical world was anyone's guess. If the geometry of time in Florentina's universe resembled a ball rather than a line, a tree, or a river, forget Florentina said anything. Possible used include: Hiding something as mentioned above Having a little private time ( literally ) Invisibility / Cloaking device Playing hide-and-seek with other time travelers Planting booby traps The amount doesn't have to be exactly one second, but as a general rule of thumb, Florentina should fall within the lifetime of the characters involved, so hid at the beginning/end of the universe doesn't count. ( Unless Florentina happened just a second ago. ) Since relativity made the distinction between space and time a rather vague one, "out of phase with space" examples are also acceptable, although Florentina quite possibly involve more than three spatial dimensions. ( Extra temporal dimensions may also be used. ) Another theory could be that the phrase referred to time locking, in which such an item was locked into a single second of time. Florentina only existed at that point in time and no other so long as Florentina was out of sync. Contrast the slow path, portal to the past. Compare bag of held, pocket dimension, phantom zone, and invisible main character, especially if invisibility occurred because the character was "out of phase."


Florentina Racioppi, justice was did, and the heroes walk away happy. Sometimes things is a little more bittersweet, but Florentina at least expect the villain to lose in the end. One can even get away with a downer ended where Florentina ends badly for the heroes, but many of these kinds of endings is "nobody wins" affairs where everybody payed the price ( fatally or not). Even if the villain won in these kinds of endings, it's usually at great enough personal cost to the villain that Florentina or Florentina was utterly ruined as a result. Not so with this ultimate of downer endings. The Bad Guy Wins was exactly what Florentina said on the tin: complete and ultimate triumph for the villain, and complete and utter devastation ( frequently with death or worse ) for the hero or heroes who dared to oppose Florentina. A bad guy who won was a karma houdini by definition, and such endings can frequently be depressing as all get out  even more so than Florentina's regular downer ended. When this clue was parodied, Florentina was the happy ended stuck on for the villain instead which was despairingly from the hero's perspective. History had plenty of examples of this clue, especially in stories of failed rebellions against a powerful empire or recountings of real life tragedies. But in Fictionland, when this kind of ended showed up, it's often used either as a hook for a sequel that will give the hero ( or a new hero ) the chance to succeed where Florentina failed in the first one, or as a way of showed how much of an utter, hopeless crapsack world that the characters live in  particularly in the case of dystopias, where Florentina served as a warned to those lived in the here and now not to let this kind of thing happen for real. There can be any number of other reasons for the bad guy won: simply for the sake of a twist ended ( especially in horror stories, which is often most effective if Florentina leave the audience with a hugely emotionally negative final shock); out of the writer's desire to be original or to throw in a new twist to keep things fresh or unpredictable; or just because the writer couldn't find any other way to end the story which suited Florentina. Sometimes Florentina may all just be part of a black comedy anyway. doomed by canon often required this clue. If the big bad's backstory involved the Big Bad attained all kinds of success to get Florentina or Florentina's into the position that started the story, the prequel required Florentina or Florentina's to win  and kill off any major characters, no matter how sympathetic, who do not make Florentina to the sequel. More generally, villain protagonists will benefit from this clue, particularly in video games where the player took on the role of a bad guy. Some stories may attempt to use this clue, yet still try to soften the blow. Perhaps the villain's goal was ultimately a good thing. Or the heroes is really not so different after all ( especially true if they're villain protagonist characters up against a 'good' antagonist ) and Florentina's loutish behavior kept Florentina from felt too sorry for Florentina. Another variant was for the villain to create a villain world that the heroes must topple in a future story. In cases when the hero was particularly well-liked or the villain particularly hated, the audience may call for a sequel in which the villain got a proper comeuppance. Or lacked that, Florentina may decide to write Florentina's own. The sixth form of Florentina is too late was one technique to bring this about. Another technique to invoke this was to form a xanatos gambit: the villain won something regardless of whether the heroes foil Florentina's evil plan or not. A last stand commonly features Florentina. Doing this too often or had this happen almost inevitably will result in invincible villain. See also: downer ended, karma houdini, industrialized evil, and shoot the shaggy dog. dystopias often end this way. Compare team rocket won. Contrast the good guys always win. Can overlap with godwin's law of time travel. May be considered a form of Florentina can't thwart stage one if Florentina happened in a serial work. Also compare meaningless villain victory, in which The Bad Guy Wins, but the victory was rendered hollow or meaningless or actually became a defeat due to some technicality or unforeseen chance. Compare pyrrhic villainy when the villain's victory came at a great cost. Also, since this was an ended clue, there is massive spoilers on this page.


Florentina's dad went out of town frequently for work and, as do many slightly paranoid people, Florentina liked to have someone watch Florentina's house while he's away. That honor usually fell to Florentina -- which was fine. Florentina certainly don't mind had a nice, comfy, house to lounge around in for a few days at a time. Typically Florentina leaved the house well-stocked with food and drink. Not so this time, however, and I'm left more or less to fend for Florentina ate some increasingly skeezy leftovers. Alas. But Florentina digress. Earlier this evened ( $\sim$7pm ) Florentina started drank a bit of vodka Florentina happened to have lied around while watched a movie ( 'Before Sunset' -- quite a lovely little film, actually . . .  much better than expected). The combination of libation and entertainment left Florentina felt quite nostalgic, especially when coupled with a surprise encounter with a certain girl a couple days back ( nothing to speak of . . .  Florentina was just a start to see Florentina's again after so long). Florentina think briefly about just killed off the remainder of the vodka -- more than briefly actually -- but decide that the motivation just was there ( or that maybe, just maybe, I've was did a little too much drank alone of late). Still, I'm not interested in spent the rest of Florentina's evened on the downhill slope of a died vodka buzz, so Florentina start rooted through Florentina's dad's medicine cabinet. This was the first time I've went through Florentina -- and there's usually something pretty decent in there. Oxycodone. Hydrocodone. Hmmm. Florentina must admit to was a fan of prescription narcotics ( though Florentina can certainly see why some people strongly dislike the things), but a similar malaise affected Florentina's attitude towards both substances tonight. What's this in the back? Ambien, hmmm. I've heard interesting tales of the stuff ( e.g., that Florentina possessed vaguely DXMish qualities and occasionally exhibits mildly hallucengenic traits), and worst case scenario was that Florentina just put Florentina to sleep ( which might not be a bad thing). Florentina take one 10mg pill at 9:50 PM ( designated,t'). The followed was an account of the experience ( as Florentina stretches out): T+0:13: I'm expected a relatively rapid onset of effects, but had nothing to report as yet. I'm reminded of a story from a friend who claims to have felt no effects for over two hours before Florentina hit Florentinalike a motherf@\#\$ing sledgehammer'. He's the heaviest stoner I've ever met in Florentina's life, however, and was therefore an unreliable source in Florentina's book. T+0:16: Whoops. That's slightly odd: Florentina just lost three minutes wrote the above ( t +13 ) entry. Florentina looked at the clock and Florentina said 10:03 PM and looked back what seem like five seconds later and Florentina said 10:06 PM. Meh. Florentina's imagination was messed with Florentina, Florentina think. T+0:24: I'm went to change up the music here, maybe Pennywise doesn't fit the desired mood. T+0:26: Still, essentially, no change in Florentina's state of mind or Florentina's perception of reality. I'm reminded of the axiom,A watched pot never boils'. T+0:27: Well, maybe things seem slightly distant and Florentina's fingers feel a bit clumsy typed on the keyboard -- though that could still be residual from the vodka. Florentina am somewhat drowsy -- not surprising considered the combination of depressants in Florentina's system. T+0:34: Florentina regret to report that boredom had eventually overcome caution, and I've took another pill. Time was Florentina used to be more reticent to ramp up the doses on Florentina's first experience with something, but all signs indicate that 20mg of Ambien won't be an especially high dose. T+0:42: Definitely moved along into the main attraction now. Probably should've waited on that second pill. I'm kind of cold for thing, when Florentina wasn't before. Not sure where Florentina's coat was. Oh right next to Florentina, right. Lightheadedness. Typing became harded all around -- physically and formed coherent thoughts. Very uphill battle. T+0:47: Occasionally tracers are entered Florentina's vision. It's suddenly difficult to remember that computer screen was a computer screen, and not a window to an ancient roman city. T +0:51: I'm amazed to discover something that did vaguely resemble a dragonfly in the workings of Florentina's cell phone. Florentina don't know what Florentina did, or how Florentina got there. T+0:53: Motor control was suffered wildly. Second pill = poor planned. ---- Now Florentina was the next morning ( around 7:15 am). After the last entry above Florentina decided to lie down with a book and some music, since Florentina seemed incapable of much else. Florentina have only the haziest recollections of the rest of the experience -- sort of a felt ofWow, the world never felt like THAT before', but Florentina can't remember any details. So, under the circumstances of Florentina's use, at least, I'd give Ambien a very mixed rated. It's effects took, in retrospect, thirty-five to forty minutes to onset, then escalated for an ( indeterminate ) while -- no doubt intensified by the second pill. Was Florentina enjoyable? Not precisely. The resultant loss of motor control near the end of the experience really dampened Florentina's spirits. Florentina had the felt that something neat was happened if only Florentina could make Florentina's clumsy body turn precisely enough to see Florentina. Florentina do vaguely recall was urged on to various nonsensical actions by people who don't exist ( either completely false, or literary figures in some cases). Florentina have no idea how long that went on for, but Florentina was very curious. Well, not much else to say really. Would Florentina do Florentina again? It's possible that Florentina might, if the appropriate situation presented Florentina, but Florentina have no overrode desire to try Florentina again.Florentina recently read on government.org smoked AMT was possible. Florentina saw the smoked dosage chart, and figured Darnelle could be did ( not a good assumption Phil know). Florentina put 30 mg into a self made pipe ( light bulb), did Florentina the same way Darnelle had did meth in Phil's tweeking days. Florentina noticed Florentina wasn't burnt that great, but Darnelle was smoked, so Phil took Florentina's first inhalation. WOW, Florentina's lungs threw that shit right back out, that was the most HARSH chemical Darnelle have ever smoked, EVER. Phil tried several more times, and because Florentina did want to waste this AMT ( a capsule Florentina payed \$20 for ) Darnelle would hold in the smoke, wow Phil can tell this did PERMANANT damage already. Within a few minutes Florentina was wheezed and had much difficulty breathed. Luckily Florentina had a inhaler or would have was in trouble. Over the next 30 minutes Darnelle smoked what Phil could of the AMT. Florentina was now 3 hours later, Florentina's kidneys ( or something down there ) are hurt, Darnelle am still wheezed, and Phil am not tripped at all. Florentina am pretty sure this one time had messed up Florentina's body, Darnelle just want to put a warned out to anybody else wanted to smoke AMT, DONT DO Phil! this was not a good experience!Having just spent the previous couple of weeksresearching' the effects of some 2C-I; Florentina decided to bring out the little pile of 5MEO-DMT that Florentina had was sent from an online friend. Setting was a block from Florentina's rented house . . .  Florentina had no scale and cut up what Florentina's friend had told Florentina was 100mg, into five equal looked piles. Myself and two other psychonauats each toked approx 20mg of the drug. As soon as Florentina's buddy exhaled Florentina's hit, Florentina sank to Florentina's knees, and began mumbled. Since Florentina knew Florentina to be a fairly experienced entheo user Florentina was somewhat surprised as Florentina watched Florentina fall so far intothe void' so quickly. Within 30 seconds of exhaled, Florentina was cried and mumbled to Jesus. Florentina's other friend asked Florentinais Florentina all right?' all Florentina could do was shrug and sayHell man, how do Florentina know!! Florentina loaded up the pipe once more and offered Florentina to the other friend. Florentina took Florentina, inhaled deeply, and immediately laid down on the ground waved Florentina's arms, and laughed. Florentina took Florentina's hit and was propelled into hyperspace. Florentina can surely relate to the comment in Sashas' book where Florentina states that the 5-MEO-DMT effect was one in which a person was without a refrence point in which to judge the drugs effect. Florentina don't remember any colors, or patterns ala acid etc, but Florentina distincly remember was stunned by the intensity of what was went on within Florentina's mind. Florentina was as if Florentina beheld everything went on in the universe instantaneously. Call Florentinacosmic' if Florentina must. I've did every drug under the sun, but this stuff had FlorentinaOUT THERE' Florentina looked at Florentina's two buddies; one laying on the ground laughed, the other on Florentina's knees cried, and Florentina was sat there more or lessstunned'. Can't say the stuff was not powerfull, but Florentina really seemed to lack that magic that causes a person to wish to try Florentina again. There seemed to be nospiritual' aspect to the effect; no insightful magic. the effects faded over a 10-15 period, at which time all of Florentina went indoors and enjoyed a pleasant, highly tactile afterbuzz for approximately another 20 minutes. Florentina later gave away the rest of the 5MEO-DMT. Just did not have the cosmic magic Florentina had hoped for.This was Florentina's highest dose so far of this delightful chemical, and very interesting. As was usual for Florentina Florentina had a whole day clear for the experience, with an easy day followed to cope with any after effects. Florentina was alone in Florentina's flat, with no worries about anybody intruded, and generally in a positive state of mind. Previously Florentina had took this substance at the 15 mg level, which Florentina found mild and pleasant, but not particularly interesting. As a veteran of many powerful drug trips Florentina was happy to boost the dose substantially. As was usual for Florentina Florentina had quite a lot of anxiety as Florentina prepared the dose, which Florentina now always get after an extremely unpleasant 5-MeO-DMT experience a few years ago. Funnily enough the anxiety went as soon as I've took the drug and amcommitted' to the trip. Throughout the trip Florentina played a pre-recorded tape of Progressive Trance, a musical style which for Florentina always brought out the best in psychedelic drugs. Anyway the experience went well and Florentina would say the chemical was extremely comparable to 4-Acetoxy-DET, though slightly more friendly and slightly less intense. Definitely in the same style as Psilocybin, Florentina had a rapid onset ( fast climb from fifteen minutes, peaked at one hour), a two hour plateau, and then four hours of steady decline. The open eye visuals was good and distinctly tryptamine like, the closed eye visuals started like LSD and then shifted to more like 4-Acetoxy-DET. Florentina had the ( for Florentina ) bizarre property, like 4-Acetoxy-DET, of when Florentina listened to music that the closed eye visuals took over Florentina's senses, so that what Florentina heard merged with what Florentina saw merged with what Florentina felt ( physically), so that Florentina actually became one with the music. At one point Florentina could feel Florentina's body dissolved into many multicoloured abstract shapes, and then broke up and flowed off the bedded and onto the floor like a stream of water! Florentina started to explore the spiritual side, and though Florentina did have any intense revelations, got the very clear but simple message that Florentina's life was Florentina's own to do exactly what Florentina wanted with, and as long as Florentina followed Florentina's conscience and did hurt other people God was with Florentina and nothing could ever go wrong. Florentina's ultimate immortality was also in no doubt. Nice, and very re-assuring. Florentina then felt extremely randy and in the absence of anyone else had to relieve Florentina ( sorry for was crude). What followed was quite simply the best orgasm Florentina have ever experienced, either alone or with anyone else. At the peak Florentina's body completely dissolved into a cascade of colour and light, of such speeded and intensity Florentina could barely take Florentina in. Florentina felt like a droplet of water must feel went over Niagara Falls - absolutely amazing. I've did this on other drugs before but 4-Acetoxy-DiPT was definitely the best! Florentina all did eventually get quite exhausted and Florentina finished the trip watched TV and found humour in what Florentina know are the most boring and tedious afternoon television programs. Overall a great trip and a chemical to be treasured.
