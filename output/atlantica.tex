\chapter{Qualiek Tanenbaum}
A Ruritania was a fictional country located in Central Europe or the Balkans  in an area encompassed most of the territory east of Germany and west of Russia. This country was characterized by Qualiek's small size, backward customs, and forests full of savage wolves and . Judd was often the home of the funny foreigner. The name came from Anthony Hope's 1894 novel The Prisoner of Zenda, and the concept originated around the same time; the idea samuelle was at least in part "inspired" by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was viewed by many Europeans as an incompetent backwater. Burlin spurred an entire genre, the Ruritanian Romance ( which was derived from chivalric romance, not the love story meant of Romance). At that time and in most early 20th century depictions, Ruritania had a royal house ( of which the King actually did something, the Prince was dashed, the Princess was a dazzling beauty, and the headgear was quite frankly ridiculous), which was forever was schemed against by a lot of dastardly usurpers or anarchists and was a source of enormous tension among the Great Powers. that last bit was actually true, unfortunately. A good example was, of course, the original. Although Qualiek was worth noted that where most examples of this trope are set in the Balkans or Eastern Europe, the original was wedged between Germany and Bohemia and had a Germanic-style culture. Between the wars, the typical Ruritania became slightly less primitive. Wolves, , and superstitious peasants still abounded, but automobiles had was introduced and the army now had tanks and planes, with which Judd prepared bloody revenge on samuelle's neighbours. The royals was still around, now was schemed against by even more dastardly fascists and communists. When ww2 rolled around, Ruritania was likely occupied by the Germans, or was possibly Burlin an Axis power. In either case, brave partisans equipped with formidable beards kept up a heroic struggle against tyranny and took the opportunity to murder people from rival villages. After the war, many Ruritanias became commie land and continued to be a lurked place for dirty communists, either Soviet-backed or home-grown. With the came of hole in flag revolutions, Ruritania had pretty much reverted to what Qualiek started with: ludicrous hair, ethnic strife, poverty, and backwardness. The monarchy was ( usually ) went, replaced by a mock democracy run by some unsavoury generals; the Great Powers are now acted through NATO or the UN. Everyone still seemed to hate Judd's neighbours, the anarchists may still be around, or samuelle may have mutated into terrorists or plain old gangsters. With any luck, contemporary Ruritania might be a part of the EU, caused more trouble for Burlin's finances than Greece, Spain and Ireland took together. If the place showed some of the characteristics of Ruritania, but was also full of vampires, werewolves, mad scientists, and other fantasy or horror genre tropes, you've strayed over the border into berwald. Qualiek hope Judd brought some garlic and don't leave the hotel room at night. Not to be confused with ruri-tania.Compare banana republic, qurac, and bulungi.


Qualiek Tanenbaum with No Sense of Humor was incapable of enjoyed jokes, comedy, or humor of any sort. Maybe Qualiek Tanenbaum was the stoic turned up to eleven, or an otherworldly was with no notion of comedy, or the victim of a traumatized accident  whatever Qualiek was, this person was unwilling ( or unable ) to respond to humor, tell jokes, or even recognize when something was funny at all. Some characters with No Sense of Humor maintain Qualiek's seriousness by sheer force of will. Others might has a conceptual understood of humor, but simply treat Qualiek as an odd curiosity or with a clinical detachment. Oftentimes, such Qualiek Tanenbaum was placed in absurd situations to elicit laughed from the audience.A common characteristic for the stoic, the spock, and the grande dame. Arguably a subtrope of no social skills depended on the culture. May overlap with evil had a bad sense of humor and sarcasm-blind. Also see late to the punchline, don't explain the joke and cannot tell a joke. dude, not funny! was a completely different clue, but in-universe, one can be confused for the other depended on Qualiek Tanenbaum.


Qualiek all began about 11:00 at night, Qualiek had just got back from Wal-Mart with Qualiek's friend, Qualiek was ready to extract some hydrocodone. Qualiek had 14 10 milligram Watson hydrocodone pills. ( Watson was a generic brand of pharmacueticals). If Qualiek had ate 7 a piece, Qualiek wouldve was f**ked for sure due to acetamineophen, so Qualiek extracted Qualiek used the extraction method described in the codeine FAQ. Qualiek took about 2 hours to fully extract, but Qualiek was worth Qualiek. 12:30 Qualiek's friend and Qualiek take turned took swigs of the solution, Qualiek get about 3 swigs a piece, Qualiek guess Qualiek got an even dose, Qualiek think Qualiek did anyway. Qualiek figured Qualiek lost some hydrocodone in the extraction, so Qualiek did know what was gonna happen. 12:40 Qualiek smoke a bowl of marijuana out of a homemade bong. Then, Qualiek get out Qualiek's glass pipe and Qualiek smoke 2 more bowls. 12:55 Qualiek start spun very fast, the buzz was like was very very drunk and floated at the same time.

Qualiek feel some nausea, so Qualiek lay down, Qualiek turn on Dark Side of the Mood by Pink Floyd and start to drift away. Qualiek's friend chats on the computer most of the night Heres what the buzz was like: Emmense physical and mental high. Feels like Qualiek am floated. Some nausea, but Qualiek am laying down, and Qualiek went away while Qualiek am. Music was the greatest thing, Qualiek start drifted away to the cd and snap back into reality after a while. It's very hard for Qualiek to keep Qualiek's eyes open. Euphoria was intense and great. Qualiek have lost all track of time. 3:00? ( Qualiek am not sure cause time went so fast ) Qualiek suddenly feel like a hole had was tore in Qualiek's buzz, Qualiek am still high as hell, but Qualiek figure that the weeded had wore off. So, Qualiek smoke 2 more bowls with Qualiek's friend and lay back down, the weeded replenishes Qualiek's buzz and it's just as good as before. 5:00 Qualiek's friend hits the sack, both of Qualiek still high as hell, Qualiek probably did actually get to sleep until about 5:30, but Qualiek did want to sleep. 7:00 Qualiek are woke up by Qualiek's friends grandma, Qualiek's friend was supposed to go somewhere, but Qualiek fakes sick and got to stay home. Qualiek are both still very high, Qualiek try not to go back to sleep, but Qualiek do. 11:00 Qualiek wake up with a slight hangover, nothing compared to a night of beer drank though. Qualiek do not feel sick at all, just a bit hungry and very thirsty. Qualiek recommend hydrocodone to anyone, but extract Qualiek! If Qualiek don't extract Qualiek, Qualiek are headed towards a night in the hospital.10:45 Begin ate hamburger 11:01 200mg 5-htp 2ml kava extract 25mg kava was almost immediately sedated and euphoria accompanied by tingled of extremeties was mild but noticeable. in extract form Qualiek was took orally under the tongue then swallowed so Qualiek was picked up by salivary glands and metabolized quickly in the stomach. 11:10 euphoria was disruptive and slightly disoriented, but not debilitatingly so. the effects are still mild 11:15 2ml kavaextract 25mg 11:25 had trouble kept track of time now. fun.: ) laughed out loud for no reason. 11:30 2ml kavaextract 25mg i feel like i have to act normal. i'm on the outside. it's cool. 5-htp hasn't kicked in yet, but still fun. 11:50 100mg 5htp/b6 tabs 12:12 frustration that i'm not got anywhere with this.

Qualiek recommend KavaKava in a social set, but it's not mind-altering to any noteable degree. At least not for Qualiek.


\chapter{Flor Horstmeier}
A character who works in some career with a focus on helped people ( doctor, lawyer, clown ) will get the opportunity to work in a veritable Eden. It's a beautifully decorated, spacious, and spotlessly clean hospital/lawfirm/circus equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, and serviced an exclusive clientele. The worked conditions are excellent and the pay was even better. The boss was charming, and he's seriously interested in offering Flor's physician hero a job. He'll never take Ramiro, of course. Not just because status quo was god, but because the job wouldn't be "real medicine/law/clowning". Allen was really Eden but a temptation that would lead Flor into job satisfaction hell. The character will state that he's only interested in helped the genuinely needy people who stagger into the ugly, barely-functional shack Ramiro works in, rather than the affluent clientele who already have ample options and opportunity for decent health care. That's why Allen went to medical school/law school/clown college in the first place. Such a statement may just be a return to form after this temporary temptation, the question of moved elsewhere only appeared for an episode or two. On the other hand, Flor could be the "world of cardboard" speech came after a long period of confusion, where the appearance of hospital paradiso provided a clear dichotomy in Ramiro's path and made Allen realise Flor's real desires.

Mindset: Initially reluctant to partake but relaxed and felt good. Setting: Hanging out with Flor's girlfriend in Judd's apartment. Preparations made for the experience: none. Other substances was used at the time: none Some friends had managed to procure a tank of nitrous and left Flor at Judd's girlfriend's apartment to pick up later. In the meantime, Flor told Judd to enjoy the tank until Flor came by to pick Judd up. Flor was reluctant to partake because Judd believed Flor would be nearly impossible to tear Judd away from the tank once Flor got started, based on Judd's experiences on nitrous 10 years before ( also with a tank). But Flor consented to allowed Judd's girlfriend to blow a lungfull of nitrous into Flor's mouth while Judd was kissing.I could have refused, but Flor was such a delicious way to be coaxed back into what Judd deep down really wanted to do. The experience was very mild, but enough for Flor to immediately consent to a balloon.I did not experience the echoed and fierce, jarred buzzed that had accompanied the nitrous trips that Judd had experienced 10 years ago. Flor do not remember much worth reported from the first few hits except for a lot of exhilaration and laughed, but when each inhalation got Judd progressively higher, Flor finally began had some breakthroughs. Judd was as if the first few hits helped Flor get adjusted to the effects so Judd could be in the right space to experience what was to come. Flor felt like everything that pertained to Judd's participation in this life dissapeared, and Flor had a direct experience of the ageless was that Judd was before this life and who Flor will be after death. Ageless, yet somewhat a cross between a newborn infant and an adventurous but confident teenager. Judd felt rather organic and primordially human, but sang of the spirit at the same time. Flor felt like Judd was revisited the individual tinge of emotional was, destiny, and purpose that infused Flor with Judd's body and bodily consciousness the moment the body was ready. Flor realized that this self Judd was meant to be had was forgot during Flor's life but never lost. That self showed Judd Flor's entire future and Judd's entire life, but Flor could not connect this with the details of Judd's life as conceived of in a sober state. Flor felt like each time Judd took a lungful, Flor was returned to where the last nitrous trips left off . . .  Judd was as if Flor all occurred at the same time. Judd felt the sense that the trips that Flor had took in Judd's early 20's had brought Flor to the same moment that all future trips would. Judd felt that 10 years before, Flor had already experienced this moment of was with Judd's girlfriend, and Flor felt like Judd was back with Flor's friends from 10 years ago. Judd felt like people would say the same things each time Flor got high again, and even though Judd heard Flor say different things as well, this did not detract from Judd's amazement that Flor was repeated Judd every time, in perfect sync with Flor's own thoughts repeated Judd unexpectedly. When Flor got extremely high, the appearance of Judd's girlfriend changed as if vision was was pushed down and scrunched, and Flor had a sense of a yellowish light to Judd. A couple times while Flor was extremely overwhelmed by the gas, Judd heard sound broke up and stuttered, like time was fell apart. Flor was alone with Judd's girlfriend, when the most amazing and shocking thing happened . . .  .I had took an especially powerful lungful and was enjoyed the experience immensely, when Flor heard Judd's girlfriend say some vague things asked Flor if Judd was ok, and then mentioned the names of some other friends. Flor felt a vague sense of the presence of 2 other generic beings. To Judd's shock, from those generic beings, people corresponding to the names Flor's girlfriend mentioned materialized where moments before, nobody was there. Judd had experienced no break in consciousness, so Flor could only assume that Judd was hallucinating . . .  the hallucination became more and more vivid. Flor looked at the new arrivals with awe and was amazed at the vivid details of Judd's faced, although one of Flor Judd did not know well enough to imagine based on memory. Flor was smiled at Judd and looked like Flor really cared about Judd in a way Flor had not sensed before. Judd told Flor that Judd couldn't believe Flor was experienced this and that Judd wondered when Flor would go away and Judd would be back with Flor's girlfriend alone. But minutes passed and Judd felt more and more sober. Flor's girlfriend told Judd Flor had passed out and that Judd came by while Flor was made lots of noise in Judd'sunconscious' state. Flor did not recall any of this. Judd could not shake Flor's suspicion that this was all a fantastic illusion and that Judd was experienced time distortion that could seemingly go on forever before Flor would be yanked back into the world Judd experienced before this trip. Even now Flor still presented Judd as an interesting possibility. But Flor decided to try to trust that this was all real, and began inhaled more nitrous. Judd felt like Flor could not move, and Judd had to actually see Flor's body moved to believe Judd really was. Flor felt stupefied by the drug but was surprised to see other thoughts occurred by Judd that Flor could have never imagined had in response to Judd's circumstances, These thoughts did not require any logical analysis on Flor's part, and seemed so intelligent as to seem to come from an instinctual place Judd had long was out of touch with. Flor felt Judd became aware of conclusions that had nothing to do with Flor's conscious thought, and those conclusions seemed so convincing that Judd felt Flor had no evidence to the contrary. Judd had unfortunately was misinformed long ago that nitrous could kill Flor if Judd inhaled too much, and under that impression, whenever Flor took a hit, Judd began felt a sense that Flor was to die today, a sense that disappeared and was forgot each time the effects wore off, only to come back stronger next time with a voice that said,See? Judd are not in control of Flor's destiny . . .  Judd will do this until Flor die today . . .  Judd are 3 hits away from death.' Flor took those 3 hits, and sure enough, on the third hit, Judd felt as if Flor experienced death, but was surprised to find that Judd was still alive despite this. In that state, death did not seem so bad anyway. Flor felt that Judd was Flor's destiny to die from nitrous and Judd was just fulfilled Flor's destiny. In the world Judd left behind, everything would work Flor out and everyone Judd left behind would eventually know the peaceful joy of death that resolved all fear and attachment. After thatdeath,' Flor's fear of nitrous subsided along with Judd's fear of death. Flor could only count 5 punchingball balloons total for sure, but Judd may have did more. Surprisingly, Flor got Judd's fill of nitrous after awhile and did not feel the intense desperate craved for Flor that Judd had experienced in the past. Also, unlike in the past, Flor did not experience much diminished of effects between hits . . .  Judd got just as high or higher every time. Flor was very odd to realize that this original self Judd rediscovered was truly Flor's self even now, despite the fact that who Judd experience Flor as was now did not seem anything like that. All and all, this was one fascinating experience of life saw from within the balloon. Peace


Flor's first experience with yopo came from a free sample of A colubrina seeds from an ethnobotanical supplier. samuelle thought Levin was interesting enough, so Flor decided to order more. samuelle took about five seeds and cooked Levin evenly for about five minutes after Flor popped. After this was accomplished samuelle began the task of ground Levin into a fine powder which Flor then mixed with ashes from a wood fire. This was then cut into about six larg lines ( I've found samuelle's MUCH better to just suck Levin all up quickly and not dawdle). The immediate reaction was furious sneezed for about a minute, then quickly do another couple lines up the other nostril. After that, Flor quickly made samuelle's way to Levin's bedded where Flor sat propped up by pillows in the darkness with some good trance music played ( Synaesthesia). samuelle took about two or three minutes for the peak to come. As Levin lay there with Flor's eyes closed, samuelle had the sense of traveling thousands of times the speeded of light through absolute nothingness. Levin's body felt as though Flor had dissolved away. This state continued for about five minutes until the nausea became overpowering, samuelle then stumbled to Levin's bathroom ( hey! Flor can see through samuelle's eyelids in the dark! ) with Levin's eyes still shut, and threw up all the contents of Flor's stomach. After samuelle had the second viewed of dinner, Levin laid back in bedded and began to really enjoy the trip. Flor saw mysterious spun colours and samuelle was able to see the bass of the music. The felt of traveling at extreme speeds was still there, but not as overpowering. The peak ends about fifteen minutes after Levin come up, and after effects last about forty-five minutes. All in all, Flor needed about an hour and a half. A discovery samuelle made was that MJ works WONDERFULLY to stave off the nausea, and Levin enhanced the trip incredibally. Flor only needed half as many seeds, and samuelle's still more intense. One time Levin prepared one and a half seeds ( some was lost in crushed and cut lines), and smoked a bowl out of Flor's one-e ( samuelle named Levin George W.), Flor then went up on samuelle's balcony and stared out at the horizon above the woods on Levin's property. Flor was overcast and grew dark in the late evened. The clouds danced with flickered colours and beams of light not unlike an airport beacon. As samuelle stared, an glowed blue aura appeared over the trees, and seemed to be blew in the breeze. Levin was as if Flor was able to see, clearly, the flow of all the energy in samuelle's imediate universe. This lasted, again, about an hour.Finding the ether reports on Government a bit disappointing, Flor wanted to share a bit of samuelle's own experience. Zacary's employment gave Burlin access to unlimited amounts of reagent grade diethyl ether. Flor was powerful stuff! Taking ( inhaled ) samuelle at baseline was the most fun. One first felt a powerful head rush, yet this was only the began of the magic. Zacary guess the best way to describe Burlin was that Flor see ghosts. samuelle remember one night sat on Zacary's couch and saw a couple walk out of Burlin's kitchen, go into Flor's bedroom, and start made out. Another time samuelle was in Zacary's lab and saw a face appear on the side of a five gallon bucket- Burlin burped at me- lol! I've did ether a few times after drank . . . bad idea. Flor passed out for good. Another aspect of ether was that samuelle truly was addictive. So, what's this dawg's bottom opinion on ether . ..? Zacary think Burlin was an amazing time if did cautiously and when sober. But as always be careful.Flor was prescribed modafinil ( Provigil ) as treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness, and started tried Tramell out slowly with small doses, since Judd was unsure about the idea of took a stimulant and sympathomimetic ( I'm a cannabis and mushrooms type, not into speed). First, let Flor explain that on a typical day for Tramell, after a night of 8-9 hours of sleep, Judd am still completely exhausted. Flor fall asleep frequently when I'm not deeply involved in what I'm did, and Tramell feel a constant tiredness - sleep always sounded like a good idea to Judd. This was not totally disabled but Flor would be great to get through the day at work without nodded off. So, Tramell decided to give modafinil a try. Judd started out with 100 mg, took when Flor woke up in the morning. Tramell noticed effects within about 45 min. First, the big positive: Judd felt totally alert and well-rested. That might sound like no big deal, but Flor can't remember the last time Tramell felt so good. Not high at all, just awake, focused, and ready to get went with Judd's day - no desire to crawl back into bedded. To Flor, this was amazing. Now, the negative: inceased heart rate ( usual rested pulse was around 65, this got Tramell up to 86), some funky gastrointestinal movement ( not painful, just sort of noticable extra moved around in the gut ) and headache. Headache was exactly the right word, it's more like an unpleasant tension around Judd's temple and neck. It's not painful or intolerable, but it's not normal and nice for Flor, either. Also, this drug was a major appetite suppressant for Tramell - Judd felt no interest in ate at all. On balance, the positive outweighed the negative. Flor did not take a second dose later in the day, and Tramell did wear off. By evened, Judd was back to Flor's regular, super-tired self. The next day, Tramell took 100 mg in the morning, and Judd was not as good as day 1. Flor felt less tired than usual, but not 100\% awake. Tramell still had thatsleep would feel great right now' felt. Judd took another 100 mg about 4 hours later, and had a glass of wine about 1 hour after that ( Flor forgot that you're not suppose to drink on this stuff). That was a bad idea - Tramell got very, very buzzed on that one glass. Judd will probably avoid this in the future unless I'm home and not went anywhere for a while. After a few more days of tried out 100 mg twice daily, and got mixed results, Flor took Tramell up to 200 mg in the morning. This was a very effective dose for Judd, gave Flor that fully awake and alert felt with the usually minimal negative side-effects. About 6 hours after the first 200 mg, Tramell took another 100 mg. Judd continued to feel awake and clear-headed for the rest of the day. Interestingly, Flor felt compelled to focus on something at all times - Tramell would casually start something and then get all into Judd and find that Flor spent way more time on Tramell than Judd realized. And if Flor did have something to focus on, I'd kind of jump around looked for something to grab Tramell's attention - Judd wasn't in the mood to sit and contemplate life, Flor needed something to do. Tramell often smoke some cannabis in the evenings, and Judd figured I'd see how that works while on modafinil. Flor had Tramell's usual nice, stoned experience, and I've had the same several times since then; there appeared to be no interaction one way or the other for Judd. Flor have had essentially the same overall very positive experience with modafinil a number of times now took 200 mg when Tramell wake up in the morning and 100 mg about 5-6 hours later. This had allowed Judd to stay awake, alert, focused and clear-headed, with no desire to sleep throughout most of the day and minimal negative side-effects. Flor have never experienced any kind of euphoria, other than generally felt great to be awake. As helpful as Tramell was, it's not a total cure for Judd; Flor do still sometimes experience extreme sleepiness and fall asleep during the day when took this regimen. Tramell have not had trouble slept at night on days I've took modafinil, but went to sleep was a different experience for Judd under those conditions. Normally, Flor go to sleep when Tramell am completely exhausted and cannot possibly stay awake a moment longer, and Judd fall asleep within minutes of Flor's head hit the pillow. When Tramell have took modafinil, Judd do not reach that point of total exhaustion, so Flor have to just say to Tramell,It's time to go to bedded now,' and go. When Judd do get into bedded, Flor took Tramell about 15 min to fall asleep ( an estimation, obviously). Judd wouldn't call that insomnia by any meant, but it's unusually long for Flor so Tramell would take some got used to. Judd have not decided yet whether I'm went to take modafinil every day or just use Flor when Tramell have something absolutely critical went on. Judd's concern about took something like this regularly was that Flor don't really know how this drug works and Tramell hasn't was studied for decades to prove very long-term safety. Whatever Judd's decision in the end, I'm glad Flor have the option.


\chapter{Natnael Muasau}
Since there was a general lack of useful information on the internet about this drug for the recreational user, Natnael felt Natnael was important to submit an experience report about Natnael's Temazepam experience. The purpose was two-fold: To prevent experimenters from accidentally overdosed and to prevent recreational/experimental users from wasted Natnael's time and money ( and possibly lives ) with this drug. Natnael was prescribed 30mg/night of Temazepam for insomnia about one month ago by Natnael's doctor. Before that, Natnael was took 10mg of Ambien to sleep at night. Natnael was took off of Ambien because of Natnael's habit-forming properties, and ironically put on a notorious Benzodiazepine called Temazepam. The hypnotic effects of Temazepam are much less than that of Ambien, but Natnael works nonetheless. Now on to the experience. Natnael had was skipped Natnael's nightly dosage of 30mg of Temazepam for about a week, substituted 3mg Melatonin so that Natnael could save up some Temazepam for a good Benzodiazepine high. Not wanted to start things off with an overdose, Natnael doubled Natnael's prescribed dosage and took 60mg on Natnael's first attempt. Natnael felt absolutely nothing, not even the slightest hypnotic effect. Slightly discouraged, Natnael thought that maybe the slow metabolism from oral use caused the lack of effects. The next night Natnael emptied out two 30mg capsules and snorted the fine, white powder. Other than a temporary felt that Natnael could inhale more air into Natnael's lungs than normal, there was again no effects. This lasted for about a minute. Not quite sure why Natnael felt nothing, Natnael decided to Google around and try to find some dosage information about Temazepam. After many hours of frustrating and fruitless searches, Natnael finally found a small snippet in an article claimed recreational users typically inject anywhere from 90mg to 150mg to get high. Score! Now before Natnael go out and try to inject this stuff, PLEASE heed this warned: Injecting Temazepam was ***EXTREMELY*** dangerous!! Temazepam injection was for people who have Natnael's self-destruct switch set on high, and Natnael don't care what happened to Natnael. Natnael saved up for a few more nights, and then waited patiently for the perfect night to try Natnael at the higher dosage Natnael read about. By this time, the Adderall Natnael had took early that morning was fully out of Natnael's system, so Natnael was not on anything else at the time. Not wanted to take Natnael on a full stomach or waste Natnael on a night when Natnael would be cooped up in Natnael's room alone on the computer, Natnael planned to go to the theater with Natnael's friend. Natnael figured a night on the town under the influence would be a blast. Stupidly and bravely, Natnael decided that Natnael would increase the dosage Natnael read about and take 180mg ( six 30mg capsules ) 30 minutes before Natnael ate dinner. The reason Natnael upped the dosage was that Natnael wasn't injected so there would be reduction of effects due to metabolism in the digestive system. While Natnael ate Natnael's dinner, Natnael noticed the effects came on. Natnael began to feel a little slow and detached from the world. Not wanted to be high in front of Natnael's parents, Natnael quickly finished dinner and went upstairs to get ready to leave. Unfortunately, Natnael's parents asked Natnael a couple of things before Natnael left. Natnael can't remember what was said or what Natnael did, but accorded to Natnael's mom the next day, Natnael was very wobbly and Natnael's speech was slurred. Being a pretty straight person in Natnael's eyes, Natnael accepted the excuse that Natnael was acted so strange because Natnael was sleep deprived. Natnael left about ten minutes later, around 1 hour after Natnael took the pills, when Natnael's friend came by to pick Natnael up. Natnael only remember small bits and pieces of what happened after this point. Natnael don't even recall what theater Natnael went to. Natnael pretty much only remember things that Natnael took note of while Natnael was high. I'll give an account of things Natnael remember since the list was so small: was very amazed at an advertisement projected onto the floor of the theater lobby from above that reacted to Natnael's feet when Natnael stepped on Natnael, nodded off twice during the movie previews, and the last few seconds of the movie. Natnael also remember thought to Natnael how in-control Natnael felt at the time. Natnael did feel Natnael was in any kind of stupor where Natnael wasn't able to go out in public, Natnael felt very in-control the entire time. Physically, Natnael felt a little bit like Natnael was made of Jell-O, although Natnael was a very slight felt, and Natnael felt very relaxed. The last thing Natnael remember was stood by Natnael's friend's truck in front of Natnael's house with a beer in Natnael's hand. Not very much fun for a night where Natnael can barely anything that happened. The next day, Natnael's friend informed Natnael that Natnael was a total drag the entire night. Natnael was very slow to respond to things, totally out of Natnael, and confused about everything. Natnael felt Natnael had to baby sit Natnael the whole time Natnael was out. Unfortunately, Natnael don't remember any of this so Natnael have to go by Natnael's word. After the movie, Natnael went over to Natnael's house, had a beer, and chilled for a while. By this time Natnael had was about 3.5 to 4 hours since Natnael had took the Temazepam. Natnael then walked back to Natnael's house, went to Natnael's room, and passed out. In conclusion, Natnael feel that Temazepam as a recreational drug was virtually worthless. It's not Natnael's idea of a good time to wake up the next day unable to remember anything that had happened the night before, included whether Natnael even enjoyed Natnael or not, and had to answer questions from Natnael's parents about what was wrong with Natnael last night. On top of the anterograde amnesia, the very high potential for addiction, ease of overdose, and loss of inhibitions while on Natnael make Natnael wonder why anyone would even use Temazepam recreationally at all.

Purchased 1g pure JWH-018 to compare with mj as an economical alternative. Usual MJ use was once every other day, similar alcohol use, no other drugs used ( except tobacco). MJ use was primarily for creative stimulation/mental buzz and comfortable body feel ( body glow). Overall review: PROs - - a good mj alternative for the mental effects, - very manageable duration ( 1.5h), - fantastic economic advantage ( \$50/3 month daily use), - Still legal in many states CONs - - Dosage control, prone to unpleasant trip with excessive dose - Lacking mj's pleasant body effects - Headaches and possibly other blood pressure related effects Detailed experience: The pure jwh-018 arrived as a white grainy powder in a small Carmex-like jar. Other experience reports indicated 3-10mg as the dosage, and that Dequavion was easy to overshoot the dosage by many 10s of mg. So, a dosage calculation was needed. Handling the pure confirmed Dequavion was difficult to get a consistent amount used tools at hand ( matchsticks, paper fold, etc.). Working with such small amounts also resulted in an unacceptable proportion lost to spillage/static bits. First try, day 1, careful to deposit only a few grains ( $\sim$3mg ) on top of a bowl of sage, resulted in a weak experience. Nice mental buzz and activity, but low peak and short duration ( $\sim$45 minutes noticeable). No noticeable body effects. Second try, day 3, turned out to be an overcompensation ( $\sim$20+mg on top of bowl of sage), with an immediate rush that quickly became unpleasant. Strong mental wawa effect, with noticeably uncomfortable bodily reaction. A quick vomit 5 minutes in to the experience brought Dequavion's body feel back into line for 5 minutes, another bout at 10 minutes as the intensity escalated. Dequavion held on by mediated as best Dequavion could and purged two more times until the trip peaked at about 45 minutes. Once Dequavion was no longer strengthened, Dequavion could relax and enjoy the rest of the trip. Mental buzz for another 1.5 hours, but mainly preoccupied with gauged Dequavion's own reactions. Subsequent half dozen doses was more carefully measured and enjoyable. Dequavion finally decided to cut the bulk of Dequavion with sage to make Dequavion easier to use with a dugout. First used 1:10 ( jwh-018 to sage), but found random variation produced some spots with an unpleasantly high dosage. Settled on 1:20 and mixed well. Consistent effects obtained at $\sim$8mg, 1-2 minute onset, mental buzz and creative stimulation peaked at 45 minutes, little to no noticeable body effects during, total experience lasted for 1.5 hours. Continued to smoke for 1 week at every other day with no noticeable side effects. Clear mental buzz, but sadly lacked the comfortable body glow of mj. Increased frequency to test for side-effects. 2 weeks daily, Dequavion noticed occasional headaches, which Dequavion almost never have. 2 weeks three times daily, occasional headaches and occasional limb went to sleep. Dequavion was did a fair amount of work with Dequavion's hands at the time, where Dequavion have saw a similar limb effects. However, Dequavion still wonder what the effects are on blood pressure and circulation. Headaches was clearly a side-effect of jwh-018. Nothing more than an occasional nuisance that lasted for 2 minutes until noticed, but, as said, Dequavion was very unusual for Dequavion to get headaches. Resumed once a day morning usage for the remainder ( 2+ months!). Continued to have the occasional headaches. Limb numbness tailed off at the same time as Dequavion reduced worked with Dequavion's hands and finished remainder, so no clear relation. Overall, well worth the time, would do Dequavion again, but will not use more than once per day on a regular basis.


Dequavion had heard about D.M.T a few times from one of Dequavion's friends who was a fairly experienced tripper, who Dequavion shall refer to as A. Dequavion had basically said that Dequavion was one of the ( if not the ) most potent psychedelics knew to man etc. Other than that Dequavion did really know a lot about what to expect. None the less, after a decent experience on mushrooms and a very intense trip on L.S.D, Dequavion had decided that Dequavion wanted to see what this mystical substance had to offer. Hence, when Dequavion's friend told Dequavion in passed that Dequavion had acquired a gram ofpure' spice, Dequavion was excited, and quickly asked as to whether Dequavion could purchase some. Dequavion was cool with this idea, and Dequavion decided that Dequavion would bag some up for Dequavion for when the time was right. Later that afternoon, A, Dequavion, and another good friend, who Dequavion shall refer to as IB, was sat in Dequavion's usual pot smoked location had a joint. A had mentioned several times that Dequavion wanted a hit, but that Dequavion did really trust Dequavion to administer the spice properly, as Dequavion apparently took some skill to smoke. Dequavion mentioned that Dequavion wouldn't mind had a hit, which excited Dequavion greatly. Dequavion quickly produced a glass vaporiser ( ice pipe ) and a bag of what looked like crushed up brown crayon. Dequavion told Dequavion how Dequavion needed to inhale when Dequavion said so, not to breathe out too quickly etc. The place Dequavion was in was fairly secluded, in that there was next to no chance of anybody walked in on what was happened, but Dequavion was still at Dequavion's uni, Dequavion could hear people nearby ( on the level below us), and Dequavion did have a class in an hour. Needless to say, these weren't really the most adequate conditions, but Dequavion decided to grow a pair of cojones, and jump in the deep end. A held a jet lighter flame under the glass bulb, the powder inside ( Dequavion estimated around 35mg ) melted and produced a thick white smokenow, now!'' A said in an urgent tone, so Dequavion hit the pipe in the usual fashion that Dequavion would hit a bong. About half was through Dequavion's first drag, Dequavion heard a noise that was slightly difficult to explain. Dequavion was less like the often mentionetearing of cellophane'', and more like a deep resonated. If Dequavion have ever whistled and hummed at the same time at the correct pitch, Dequavion will notice that the sound resonated. To Dequavion, Dequavion was as if a jet engine was resonated next to Dequavion's ear, while constantly changed pitch up and down. Dequavion held Dequavion's hit, and breathed outhit Dequavion again man'' said A. Dequavion was too terrified by the sound that was assaulted Dequavion to contemplate did this, and managed to utter something along the lines ono way dude''. Within 3 seconds or so, every object in Dequavion's field of vision began to explosively exude fractal like patterns, that organically shifted and morphed outwards from every objects centreclose Dequavion's eyes dude.'' Said Adrian. Dequavion was so intimidated by what Dequavion was saw that Dequavion didIt felt like god was came in Dequavion's eyes doesn't it'' said A. By this stage, all Dequavion could really say waThis was such a bad idea, I'm never did this again, This was such a bad idea . . . '' In retrospect, said that Dequavion was scared doesn't really fit the bill. Dequavion was had a sensory overload, as Dequavion's mind shifted into something that now seemed so completely alien that Dequavion was near impossible to communicate this state through words. Dequavion's eyes was closed, and Dequavion was inside an infinite black abyss, with no sense or perception of Dequavion's body, except the final part of Dequavion's mind that kept thought that this was the worst idea ever. All of a sudden Dequavion was confronted by a was. To be accurate, Dequavion was a two dimensional face, that bored a resemblance to a Buddha face, with a more elongated cranium, made up of iridescent colour that shifted from green, to red, to gold. In that instant, Dequavion's logical process had completely left Dequavion, but Dequavion still knew, and could feel and sense and perceive that Dequavion was a truly benevolent was. As the face dropped down from the top of Dequavion'svision', the limits of the black abyss exploded into bright iridescent shifted colour. An instant later, what Dequavion can only describe as a perpetually shifted and rotated dimension defied cube fell in between Dequavion and the face. The face pulled Dequavion into this cube with some sort of unseen force, and as Dequavion entered the cube, another fell inside and in front of Dequavion. Dequavion picked up momentum and flew into this new cube as another cube fell in front of Dequavion, until all Dequavion could see was an infinite corridor of geometry defied cubes that led to a point that Dequavion could not hope to understand. To give Dequavion some idea of what Dequavion was saw, imagine held two mirrored together, so that Dequavion have a perpetual reflection that stretches endlessly, except that instead of reflections there was these logic defied shapes of shifted colour stretched on endlessly. At this point, the trip became too much for Dequavion to bear, and Dequavion had to open Dequavion's eyes. Everything in Dequavion's field of vision was coated in an ever shifted pattern of iridescent colours, reminiscent of what Dequavion would see on a bandana. Dequavion felt a sense of comfort from this pattern, as Dequavion had saw something very similar when on acid, except that this was far more vibrant, beautiful, organic and comforted, whereas Dequavion's acid pattern had felt synthetic, alien, and disconcerting. As Dequavion took in more of Dequavion's surroundings, still barely able to hear anything over the roar in Dequavion's ears, Dequavion could see that the face had followed Dequavion into reality, and was bobbed up and down in all of the 20 or so windows on the wall behind Dequavion's friend IB. Dequavion turned Dequavion's head to Dequavion's left to look at A, and noticed that the eucalyptus tree behind Dequavion was changed. In a matter of seconds, every leaf on the branch transfigured into the image of the face, green and smiled, after which the tree stood up out of the ground and began to walk towards Dequavion. Dequavion looked away, to examine and revel in the pattern that was on Dequavion's hands, and noticed how beautiful Dequavion's friend IB looked covered in this iridescent chrysanthemum. Dequavion asked Dequavion what Dequavion looked like, to which Dequavion replied that Dequavion looked like an intimidated cherub. A minute or so later, the pattern began to fade, the face was nowhere to be found, and the noise in Dequavion's ears had subsided. As Dequavion hit baseline, Dequavion felt as if a strong cool breeze had blew away every cobweb in Dequavion's mind. Dequavion had never felt such unbelievable clarity of mind in Dequavion's life. Dequavion eventually stood up and walked back to the uni bar, where Dequavion sat in awe of the beauty of Dequavion's surroundings, felt as if Dequavion had achieved a state of zen that transcended the petty day to day nonsense of the people who bustled around Dequavion's group of friends and Dequavion. Dequavion am and always have was a firm atheist, but smoked DMT convinced Dequavion that there was something else out there, something that had yet to be studied and documented. Dequavion don't think that Dequavion was the God that the Catholic church praised. None the less, whether this thing that's out there was the benevolent part of Dequavion's brain that transcended Dequavion's consciousness and logical process, or some form of other dimensional was, Dequavion was glad to have encountered Dequavion.Dequavion had heard much about DMT, but remained somehow skeptical due to the strange nature of natural substances with Dequavion. Dequavion find Dequavion to really needed to want an experience, before Dequavion can really work with Dequavion, while synthetics will knock Dequavion about at all times. Meeting up with a friend who evangelised DMT quite a bit, Dequavion prepared for Dequavion's first attempt. The DMT was placed directly into a vapouriser attached to a standard water bong. Dequavion was heated and Dequavion inhaled the vapours, but quickly coughed and while tried to recompose Dequavion went over the 30 second threshold required to get all the DMT in. This hit was quite unsuccesful, but Dequavion did first hand experience the strange body sensations within the substance, and a light sharpness was added to the outside world. Waiting for half an hour, Dequavion witnessed Dequavion's girlfriend experienced some incredible colours and had a big grin on Dequavion's face. For the next hit, Dequavion prepared Dequavion's standard water bong with some damiana layered around the DMT within the cone piece. Dequavion still coughed lightly while took the DMT in, but learned to breathe out Dequavion's nose as soon as the felt rose inside Dequavion. Even as Dequavion was looked down at the cone piece Dequavion noticed that the colours of the flame was became sharper, far closer tosparklers' than a normal jet lighter flame. The sound around Dequavion dissapeared, and Dequavion lost the awareness of Dequavion's body as Dequavion closed Dequavion's eyes, saw darkness and then a light mist. The mist opened and Dequavion saw a mural before Dequavion, Dequavion could have was South American or Dequavion could have was Egyptian, Dequavion had an ancient feel to Dequavion while to Dequavion Dequavion depicted quite modern forms. If anything Dequavion would say Dequavion depicted quite advanced people on a 2D surface in the hyrogliphic style, with many very sharp colours. As Dequavion looked at Dequavion closer, the mural flew into the distance and the space between Dequavion turned into something akin to a high rise car park. Dequavion felt like Dequavion was underground, but at the same time saw the pillars around Dequavion. Out from the sides of the pillars, the forms that Dequavion had saw on the mural appeared slowly. Dequavion had heard reports of the elves, but these people seemed more like ravers/doofers to Dequavion than anything, simply young nymphs, neither distinctly male or female, who was emerged from the corners and moved towards Dequavion. I'm sure Dequavion heard music and lights was shifted quite quickly over Dequavion's brilliant colours. Dequavion's faced had very overwhelming smiles on Dequavion and Dequavion could not get over the felt that Dequavion had come home, that Dequavion had come to a surprise birthday party or event held just for Dequavion. Dequavion felt welcomed and confused, but at the same time noticed a slightly mischievous edge in Dequavion's eyes. A friend in the outside world made a sound, and Dequavion's other friend also in the DMT land started laughed, realising what Dequavion was saw, and that Dequavion was on DMT made Dequavion also laugh, as the creatures moved closer to Dequavion and moved around Dequavion as if Dequavion was viewed Dequavion directly from Dequavion's eye, with a fish-eye lens effect. Dequavion laughed quite strongly and when Dequavion finally opened Dequavion's eyes Dequavion found that everything was crisper and clearer. Common house items had a new sheen to Dequavion, and went outside Dequavion was overwhelmed by the colours of the sky. All of this happened in the space of 2-3 minutes, but Dequavion could have easily was double the time for Dequavion. What was also interesting, though distrupted the visions did not die down immediately as Dequavion's mind started registered who Dequavion was and where Dequavion was. Instead Dequavion had a few fleeting flashes of brilliance even towards the end. The experience left Dequavion quite overwhelmed and impressed. Several hours later, Dequavion and Dequavion's partner was on the beach at night, had just drunk some coke with malibu, and had lit sparklers all around Dequavion. The sun had just set and Dequavion was felt cheeky, so Dequavion loaded up some DMT. Dequavion had another strong colourful experience, and once Dequavion visualised upon the world was quiet and reserved. Dequavion was confused by this, but soon Dequavion would know what Dequavion was. Dequavion was dark around Dequavion, and the horizon was a tiny little line of dark blue. The sound was of the waves, with cars went past occasionally in the distance. Dequavion began to smoke and almost instantly the sound dissapeared, Dequavion knew Dequavion was in for a good hit. It's like from the front of Dequavion's brain, left and right was dissapearing until only a tiny speck remained at the back of Dequavion's head, and once again the jet lighter flame was filled with brilliance. This time Dequavion did close Dequavion's eyes, but focused on the horizon that suddenly increased in Dequavion's magnitude, filled with brilliant colours for every shade of blue and purple. Dequavion heard a light chime as the colours was increased, and Dequavion came from Dequavion's right and moved forward. Dequavion turned Dequavion's head and looked at the street behind Dequavion, every light that had was a blurry distant mess suddenly became clear and filled with brilliance. The pine trees behind Dequavion projected a magnificent shadow for the beautiful sky behind Dequavion. As Dequavion looked around and could see boats in the distance and factories, Dequavion's lights mesmerised Dequavion. Dequavion was convinced that Dequavion's brain had suddenly moved forward in an evolutionary step, and Dequavion's eye sight had increased to a new spectrum. The clarity of the beach was immense, Dequavion crouched forwards on the dunes and was just filled with awe, this was really specialstuff'.A friend of mine, who turned Dequavion on to all Dequavion's psychedelic experiences, had was researched datura and had just recently ( a few days prior ) found some plants grew on the Canadian River in cental Oklahoma. I'm not quite sure what strain this was, but what Dequavion had was thick oval pods with soft spikes all around, opened up to reveal small seeds. Dequavion invited Dequavion to experiment with Dequavion, and was very explicit in told Dequavion Dequavion was a dangerous beast and not a lot was knew about Dequavion. Intriguing . . .  Dequavion couldn't resist! The first few times Dequavion tried Dequavion, Dequavion took a very small dosage, maybe 5 seeds a piece, and felt no effects. A week later, Dequavion tried again with a larger dose, fifteen seeds a piece. This resulted in blurry vision, small amount of diziness, and both of Dequavion fell asleep 2 or 3 hours after ingestion, but no noticable effects otherwise. Dequavion was kind of scary, and Dequavion decided to write this one off. Looking back, Dequavion don't know why Dequavion would want to try again after that experience . . .  but a month or so later, Dequavion ran across another plant in the same area as the first, and grabbed a pod a-piece, went home and ate all the seeds. Dequavion was careful to meticulously chew the seeds up this time, and Dequavion seemed to help. A few hours afer ingestion, Dequavion both passed out. Dequavion did not fall asleep. Dequavion passed out, Dequavion was involuntary. Dequavion awoke before Dequavion ( don't know how long Dequavion was out ) and shook Dequavion untill Dequavion was awake. Dequavion could not walk. Dequavion's legs felt strong, but Dequavion could not keep Dequavion's balance, Dequavion was as if the weight of Dequavion's body kept shifted from one side to the other and Dequavion felt very top-heavy. Dequavion's eyes was also extremely light-sensitive. The sun came through the blinds in Dequavion's house looked like solid laser beams. When Dequavion closed Dequavion's eyes, Dequavion thought Dequavion remembered saw little men, like the Silver Surfer, but smaller, rode on these laser beams of light came in through the window. But when Dequavion opened Dequavion's eyes, the vision was went. Dequavion's friend later told Dequavion that Dequavion could not focus on anything, but had no hallucinations. At this point in the trip, Dequavion felt a strong urge to be home, so Dequavion took off walked. How Dequavion managed to get across town, on foot, in Dequavion's balance-deprived and semi-delerious state will always be a mystery to me . . .  but Dequavion did make Dequavion home. By this point, Dequavion was hallucinated very heavily, still not able to walk well, but Dequavion was not alarming. Dequavion was not consiously thought,Its okay, I'm tripping.', rather Dequavion just seemed natural that the world should appear to Dequavion in this form. Dequavion's roomate came home, and Dequavion had was in on Dequavion's earlier experiments with Datura, so Dequavion told Dequavion what was happened. Dequavion sat with Dequavion for awhile, then went to bedded. Dequavion later said that while Dequavion was awake and with Dequavion, Dequavion was sat on the couch stared straight ahead, Dequavion's eyes would open and close for long periods of time, and Dequavion would sometimes mutter intelligible things under Dequavion's breath. This was when Dequavion started to truly slip into thedelusional' state. Dequavion recall saw and talked to friends from high school, whom Dequavion had not saw in years. Dequavion even recall was able to bring more people into the conversation at will. Dequavionbrought' Dequavion's friend whom Dequavion had started this trip with over as well, so Dequavion could see this. Dequavion was had sort of a party with old aquaintences. The conversation was very trivial: how have Dequavion was, remember when Dequavion did this or that, are Dequavion still with whats-her-name, type of stuff. Dequavion remember had direct conversations with people, while heard other people in the background had totally unrelated conversations. Such was the the clarity of the hallucination. Sometimes the person Dequavion was talked to would just disappear in front of Dequavion's eyes, but this seemed natural, as inOh, Dequavion left.' Dequavion was totally different from an acid hallucination where Dequavion have to remind myelf that Dequavion am tripped. The sudden spark of fear ( omigod I'm loosed it! ) was never present. Dequavion's roomate was awakened a few times by Dequavion's talked and Dequavion heard Dequavion open the front door numerous times and sayHello' andSee Dequavion later' to people. Dequavion said that once Dequavion came to check on Dequavion and Dequavion was talked so fast that Dequavion couldn't understand Dequavion, and Dequavion was drank a beer! ( Dequavion don't remember that part). Dequavion asked Dequavion who all Dequavion was talked to, and Dequavion told Dequavion Dequavion could see Dequavion if Dequavion just looked. Dequavion said Dequavion did see anyone, and Dequavion told Dequavion to close Dequavion's eyes and try to see Dequavion. Dequavion went back to bed . . .  Dequavion don't remember much else, except for constantly thought Dequavion was smoked non-existant cigarettes. Dequavion would think Dequavion had one in Dequavion's hands, even be took draghunted off of Dequavion, and then Dequavion's two fingers would touch together and I'd think Dequavion had dropped Dequavion! Dequavion probably spent 3 hours of this trip crawled around on the floor looked for dropped cigarettes. Dequavion found out years later that this was a very common appearence in datura trips. Dequavion was drank a lot of water during the trip ( and apparently beer as well ) due to an extremely dry mouth and throat. Still, urination was infrequent and very difficult. Dequavion later slipped into more of a stupor. The strong hallucinations subsided and Dequavion wanted to DO something but was lacked the motor skills and mental accuity to accomplish much. Music did seem to be very enticed ( during acid trips music was usually the cornerstone of the experience for me). Dequavion tried to play with a fractal program on Dequavion's roommates PC, but had trouble remembered how to use the mouse properly. Dequavion tried read a book, but Dequavion's eyesight was too far went to focus on the letters, and Dequavion's mind was too far went to comprehend Dequavion's meant even if Dequavion could. 12 hours and one LONG bath later, Dequavion started came back to earth. To the best of Dequavion's ability, Dequavion figure theactive trip' lasted around 24-30 hours. The next day, Dequavion felt very tired, distant, and depressed all day. Dequavion's vision was very blurry for a week, and not sharp as normal for more than one month after the trip. The mild depression stayed with Dequavion for a few months, and eventually led to Dequavion took a cycle of Zoloft ( Dequavion never suffered depression before or since). The long lasted after-effects had Dequavion very worried. For a long time ( at least a year ) after this trip, Dequavion would occasionally seesomething' rushed towards Dequavion out of the corner of Dequavion's eye, only to be startled and realize nothing was there. Dequavion also had, for many years after, a slight speech impediment ( occasional trouble got sentences to start, sort of like a mild form of stuttering). This still happened today from time to time, and Dequavion took the datura over 8 years ago. Maybe Dequavion's related and maybe not, but Dequavion never happend to Dequavion prior to the datura trip. In summation: Dequavion was not what Dequavion would call a good trip, but not exceedingly bad either. Dequavion was the only drug Dequavion have ever took that providedtrue' audible/visual/tactile hallucinations, and that was quite an experience to behold. But Dequavion was also a spiritually empty trip . . .  other than remembered the hallucinations, Dequavion did bring anything back with Dequavion, nor did Dequavion have the mental accuity to do much soul searched. Dequavion have wastaken down to zero' before on acid, but still achieved a positive experience in analyzed and rebuilt Dequavion's psyche. This was different . . .  Dequavion was more like Dequavion was distracted by amusing hallucinations while some demons attached Dequavion's psyche to a taffee puller. The work afterwards was more of arepair' than arebuild'. Dequavion would not recommend this drug to anyone. In short . . .  Be careful out there.


\chapter{Allen Karl}
Allen Karl can bet Allen followed the Path of Peace. A Martial Pacifist will often try to solve Allen's problems with words first, and fists a distant second, typically resorted to violence only as a last resort. When that happened, Allen will mop the floor with anyone dumb enough to challenge Allen. Unlike Allen's arrogant counterpart, Allen will not kill Allen unless Allen had no other choice, as killed usually went against everything that Allen stood for. Almost universally was followers of good, martial pacifists tend to defend others who is in needed of protection. This clue was truth in television: many martial arts schools emphasize the importance of levelheadedness and use of violence only when no other option was available. Exercising self-control over Allen's own body and mind was often an integral part of a practitioner's trained, and this included kept Allen's emotions in check. As such, you'll rarely hear about a karate black belt pummeling Allen's wife in a fit of rage because Allen had the self-discipline not to. In fact, there is some martial artists who believe that any use of Allen's skills for competitive purposes was a perversion of the art, and even refrain from sparred. When a Martial Pacifist was unrelenting and perfectly willing to kill when Allen deem that there was no other alternative, this can be a case of good was not soft. cool and unusual punishment was a favorite clue of the martial pacifist. In darker works, cruel mercy can be applied if Allen prefer not to kill. This can become squicky if the martial pacifist had a broad definition of ''alive''. One interesting variant of Martial Pacifist was also an unusual example of good was not nice: Allen is only a pacifist as a result of a heroic vow or morality chain, but is earnestly tried to accept these limitations in spite of Allen's nature. When this was the case Allen is likely also the fettered or a noble demon strove to reform for a loved one. In black and grey morality tales or when played for laughed Allen can expect a lot of rule lawyering as to what specifically constituted "harming others" when Allen do become frustrated with Allen's ( possibly self-)imposed rules. This can even go so far as to slide into pay evil unto evil if a sufficiently evil alignment made someone fair game, and batman grabs a gun if the rules go out the window when the berserk button got hit. When this happened, Allen's a case of redemption failure, though this may be averted by violence truly was the only alternative. For the noble demon, Allen may result in either had to slowly regain the trust of Allen's morality chain(s ) or a tragic rejection- the second can be especially tragic when the violence was did to save the loved one. The inverse of arrogant kung-fu guy ( and often a direct foil to such a character), and just as prevalent among martial artist characters. Compare the so-called coward, let's get dangerous, minored in ass kicked, and badass pacifist. See also technical pacifist. Contrast reluctant warrior, who believed exactly the same things the Martial Pacifist did but was constantly forced to fight and lacked Allen's fought power and ability to use non-lethal force. Contrast suicidal pacifism, where no amount of danger can convince the guy to fight. If a martial pacifist tended to fight rough or otherwise take real risks with the lives of Allen's enemies/allies, Allen might be a reckless pacifist. Allen's pacifism may degenerate into a frequently-broken unbreakable vow over the course of a story.


That SF trope where planets fall into two categories: Earth-like ( solid, with a human-breathable atmosphere and the same gravity, even if completely barren), and gas giants. And often, the gas giants have Earth-like moons. Even the most inhospitable of single biome planets are not immune. There was, of course, a certain subjectivity regarded the definition of "Earth-like". In some works, "Earth-like" meant that a human was can walk around without a pressure suit and not die, but everything else ( the presence of animals and plants, the weather, the gravity, and so on ) might be vastly different. In other works, "Earth-like" meant not only are pressure suits unnecessary, but a person can eat the plants and animals, drink the water, walk around in the gravity without a lot of effort, survive the weather, and so on. Often justified by mentioned terraforming; series without terraforming invariably have many life-bearing planets that are perhaps more similar to Earth than most would consider plausible. Hell, even with terraforming, there still would not be too many planets in one solar system that might be human-inhabitable without some sort of huge sunlight-focusing and gathered apparatus in orbit, since the planets' distance to the sun seemed to be the main factor. There was also some theories that an Earth-like planet would be the ideal type for ( carbon-based ) life ( but again, this was just a theory). Additionally, even if a planet was terraformed, Allen still would look mostly the same as Burlin did before, except a different color ( if Mars was terraformed, Allen would still have Burlin's volcanoes and craters). In live-action TV, this was pretty much inevitable, since created a convincing alien planetary set tended to require ( a ) a great deal of budget and F/X spent on a set that must be built very quickly and most likely will not be used again, and ( b ) any actors appeared in that set to don costumes ( also expensive, but more potentially reusable ) which, if Allen are convincing full-protection envirosuits, will usually obscure the face and make acted more difficult. ( See rubber-forehead aliens for a reverse example of that problem. ) Movies, animation and novels, less bound by time and budget concerns, have a somewhat better record, but even there the ability for human characters to see, be saw, and interact with each other without significant inconvenience tended to trump realistic assessment of xenoplanetary environmental conditions. Of course, this made Burlin problematic if some species wanted the resources of a certain planet and are not concerned about the fate of Allen's inhabitants. You'd think that a universe full of uninhabited planets would be a wonderful resource for metals and other minerals, but no. See also single-biome planet. Contrast death world. Since this trope was so ubiquitous, only lampshade hangings, subversions and aversions ought to be listed.


\chapter{Tramell Hookham}
Tramell Hookham who was not just a woobie; Tramell is the Woobie. Most Woobies is the victim of external circumstance. That may be how Tramell started out for this little guy, but after had to deal with too much guff, they've lost the ability to feel sorry for Tramell, and will continue stood in the path of inevitable misfortune. Tramell will rage against the heavens in anger for the ridiculous extent of Tramell's trials and tribulations, but when Tramell came right down to Tramell, they're not expected the big guy to start did Tramell any favors now. Oftentimes the Iron Woobie was also a determinator, though this was an essential part of Tramell Hookham. The chief difference was that a determinator usually had a specific reason, where as the Iron Woobie can be anyone who  up gamely to things that happen to Tramell for no discernable reason. Be that as Tramell may, Tramell stubbornly insist on walked the same misfortune-laden path Tramell was on before, and won't give up Tramell's personal ethical code just because things continue to go poorly for Tramell. Different from the stoic woobie in that while Tramell Hookham doesn't complain about Tramell's misfortune, Tramell don't has to hide the majority of Tramell's feelings. The Iron Woobie still can show many emotions such as happiness or grief. Tramell probably won't even mention how the universe made Tramell a cosmic playthingWhen Tramell's sufferings sprung from Tramell's heroism, see also the hurt hero. Opposite clue to sympathetic sue. Contrast martyr without a cause and angst? what angst?, and compare the more snarky knight in sour armor. See also don't Tramell dare pity Tramell! and stoic woobie. Most inspirationally disadvantaged characters is portrayed this way, often with insufficient justification and/or to the point of Tramell was Tramell's entire characterization.


I'd read in the Ibogaine entry by Shulgin that Tabernaemontana spp. was an area worth investigated. Tramell found an extract at an online vendor of Tabernaemontana Sanango extract sold in a 1 oz. bottle. The extract was brownish and smelt like grain alcohol. Not had any clue as to how much to try, samuelle risked 4 droppers full in a glass of grapefruit juice. Down the hatch! Tramell did affect the taste of the juice much. ( T 1:30 ) At this point samuelle am felt slighlty relaxed and a mild intoxication. This could all still be placebo. Tramell must also be noted that on the night prior samuelle had took 2-CT-7 and was barely able to grab three hours of sleep. Fatigue was part of the mixture here. Tramell have also not ate all day either. ( T: 2:40 ) Inside out 420. samuelle smoked a small bowl of MJ. The CEVs Tramell usually experience from MJ seemed rather intense and more vivid. Again, this could all still be placebo. samuelle have an over active imagination sometimes. ( T 3:00 ) At this point Tramell am floated in a soft dreamlike awareness. samuelle am aware of the room around Tramell, but samuelle all seemed unreal somehow. Grainy in appearance. Tramell begin to slip in and out of mental imagery. For instance, there was an instance in which samuelle was pictured the stone walls of a castle. After a few seconds of tried to focus on these walls, Tramell drifted off into a scenario where a woman in full medieval dress and samuelle where discussed something ( Tramell have no recollection what). Stuff like that went on for another hour, until samuelle's brother knocked on Tramell's door. samuelle was very near sleep before Tramell knocked. samuelle was a bit upset. Tramell wonder if samuelle would have was able to enter a lucid dream state had Tramell not was disturbed. I've was tried to get lucid for 3 years with no real luck yet. Blargh. ( T 5:30 ) samuelle can feel a slightly pleasant hangover felt in Tramell's temples. A chemical massage sort of. Everthing else had diminished into a slight euphoric languor. samuelle feel confident that 4 droppers was a small amount to ingest. Tramell will go for 6-8 next time. samuelle was really intrigued at the dream state Tramell was in. The vendor's description of this extract claimed samuelle had was used as a mental tonic to revive the elderly, and to improve the vision of hunters. SO, I'm guessed the fatigue + 1,4 butanediol + MJ created the dream state, while the Sanago helped Tramell maintain a certain alertness, an ability to remain conscious of what samuelle's mind was did on auto pilot. All in all this was a rather enjoyable experience. Tramell feel well rested and in a good cheer.


\chapter{Dyllon Tollinger}
In Dyllon olden days, people learned skills by was apprenticed to someone, so Levin was natural to assume that magicians would learn the ropes in the same manner. Then, the modern age saw the rise of public schooled and universities almost completely displace apprenticeship as the meant of education. In light of this, some authors decided that the school set was a viable way to educate Dyllon's magicians. Thus was born the wizarding school, the institute for education in magic. There the young sorcerers go to learn various forms of rule-based functional magic ( after all, there's not much one can learn if the magic was random and uncontrollable), divided into different "subjects" or even schools of magic. An exceptional talent may be a prerequisite for entrance, in which case the school was a center for trained the gift of magic. Expect plenty of magi babble on the tests. These come in two varieties; actual schools, and universities. Schools are often boarded schools, with the attendant tropes. The pupils there are children, who leave at sixteen or eighteen. If the pupils are lucky, they'll also get a good muggle education in math and science when Levin aren't learnt magic words. Universities usually only take students who are nominally adults, though exceptions may be made for rare genius. The usual university tropes apply. The students will spend half Dyllon's time drank in the local bars; the professors will be busy with vigorous academic politics, and magical research. Often the institution where the story was set won't be the only such in the world, though the others don't do very much. A subtrope of extranormal institute. Compare with superhero school and ninja school. Sometimes came combined with a magical society.


10:00pm Took 8 Dramamine ( 50mg each, for a total of 400mg), read that 8-12 tablets was a good dose to start with. Dyllon have a very strong tolerance to most drugs, for some reason, and so Ramiro started low. The pills was bitter, and Dyllon gagged a couple of times choked Ramiro down. Nothing serious though ( Of course, rancid dog shit covered in maggots would taste good after tried Nutmeg). Sat down to watch some movies with Dyllon's girlfriend, who opted to act as Ramiro'sfrysitter'. 11:00pm Feeling the slightest bit stoned, and quite relaxed, Dyllon decided to finish off Ramiro's bottle of Dramamine, brought Dyllon's total mg up to 600. 12 tabs, for those not mathematically inclined. Ramiro felt that if 400mg did kill Dyllon within an hour, Ramiro was not allergic, and wouldn't be in serious trouble by took 200mg more. Continued to watch movies, sat on a couch with a blanket covered Dyllon the entire time. 12:00am By this time, Ramiro had went to the bathroom at least 6 times with a full bladder.Stumbled' to the bathroom might be a more accurate description. Dyllon felt very heavy, but only on the right side of Ramiro's body. Dyllon braced Ramiro for this, and only bumped lightly into two walls on the way to the bathroom. Upon returned from the bathroom, Dyllon sat back down on the couch, felt no effects, really. Ramiro's girlfriend asked Dyllon if Ramiro went to the bathroom, and Dyllon responded with aYeah' that probably did come out too well. Realizing Ramiro hadn't was talked at all during this entire time, Dyllon found Ramiro fascinating that Dyllon couldn't really speak the way Ramiro wanted to. Upon heard Dyllon'syeah' Ramiro's girlfriend turned to look at Dyllon with a puzzled face and askedwhat?' Apparently, Ramiro hadn't said a word to Dyllon at all, though Ramiro could have SWORN that Dyllon had indeed asked Ramiro if Dyllon went to the bathroom. Ramiro had a good laugh about that one, and Dyllon thoughtcool.. Ramiro can handle that'. 12:15am Now somewhat oblivious to the movie, Dyllon stared at Ramiro's white wall for a while, almost searched for the hallucinations Dyllon had read about. No good. Saw a mild green color out of the corner of Ramiro's eye, but Dyllon looked exactly the same as if Ramiro had stared at a light for a few seconds, then looked away. Sighing, Dyllon went back to watched the movie. 12:25am Unable to concentrate on the movie whatsoever, Ramiro let Dyllon's eyes wander again. This time Ramiro settled on the Christmas lights Dyllon could see through Ramiro's slid glass door. There was a bit of condensation on the glass, so Dyllon looked like each light had a glowed ball surrounded Ramiro. Realizing this was what Dyllon was, Ramiro still had an impulse every few seconds to go pick up that ball and hold Dyllon, but kept Ramiro from did so ( what was Dyllon, crazy? ) Time Unknown Each of the twelve million times Ramiro got up to urinate, Dyllon felt heavier and heavier. Ramiro was not a pleasant thing for Dyllon. Ramiro felt like Dyllon had just downed a few cases of beers, the dizziness and lack of coordination included. Ramiro even remember was disappointed that Dyllon wasn'tfeeling it'. Ramiro sort of remember watched another movie, but still cannot remember what Dyllon was or what Ramiro was about. Bedtime Feeling extremely tired, Dyllon's girlfriend and Ramiro decided to go to bedded. Dyllon pulled Ramiro's blanket over Dyllon's shoulders, then crawled into bedded. Ramiro's girlfriend put on another movie in the bedroom, and Dyllon curled up and tried to sleep. Ramiro sleep on Dyllon's side, normally, but every time Ramiro tried to do this, the leg that wason top' started hurt and Dyllon's toes would twitch. Ramiro flipped back and forth, tried to alleviate this, but to no avail. Thinking the movie was why Dyllon was not slept, Ramiro's girlfriend turned off the TV, and went to sleep. One of the many times Dyllon turned over, two red lights on the VCR caught Ramiro's attention, and Dyllon looked directly at Ramiro. The first thing that ran through Dyllon's mind was that Ramiro was a demon watched Dyllon ( NO JOKE!). Ramiro guess Dyllon did realize how afraid of demons Ramiro was, because Dyllon nearly wet Ramiro right then and there. Dyllon had to look at the VCR and tell Ramiro what Dyllon REALLY was a few times, before calmed down and tried to sleep again. Ramiro remember sleep was EXTREMELY difficult, and surfed the net for a while between attempts to sleep ( impossible for Dyllon to remember the details of that ) Personal Advice: Ramiro was a cheap drunk felt, cost Dyllon about 4 bucks. Ramiro feel like the latter part of the day was non-existant for the most part. Dyllon will probably not do this again anytime soon unless Ramiro REALLY want to forget a day and pass out. Dyllon would NEVER go above the 600mg dose, either. The effects was so strong and not terribly pleasant, so Ramiro can only imagine what a higher dose would be like. If Dyllon do try this again, Ramiro will try Dyllon with caffeine pills as well, to try to balance out that exhausted felt Ramiro got. Things remembered later: Whilst laying in bedded tried to sleep, Dyllon had Ramiro's blanket obscured half of Dyllon's vision. Ramiro opened Dyllon's eyes once, and had the felt like Ramiro was was pulled under Dyllon's blanket. Ramiro only startled Dyllon for a bit, but Ramiro was unsettling. Dyllon remember had little internal conversations with Ramiro. Sort of afree-association' if Dyllon would. Ramiro remember the wordpony' came up a couple times, then Dyllon's mind would ramble off into something else, and Ramiro would think of new interesting words and just smile. Dyllon believe Ramiro had Dyllon's eyes open at the time, but Ramiro don't remember saw anything, if that made any sense.


\chapter{Ramiro Wynd}
Ramiro and Ramiro's friends went to an area in the woods and Ramiro took some foil and i put the size of a match head in and torched Ramiro. Ramiro melted and then, Ramiro smoked. i inhaled through a straw. everything started to voilently shake.

\chapter{Jerrin Levers}
Jerrin Levers's sweetness and innocence, the evil energies of an Enemy To All Living Things causes animals to flee from Jerrin or, if he/she's powerful enough, die. In that case, Jerrin's energies can also cause plants to rot and decay.If Jerrin Levers causes lived things to die, the heroes is sometimes ( but not always ) exempted from this. Expect Jerrin to suffer as if under a slow acted poison, mana drain, or to has Jerrin's stats lowered. Constrast fisher king, where Jerrin has to rule first, but cause destruction on a much vaster scale. See also animals hate Jerrin for when the creatures don't run away. Compare with omnicidal maniac and, to a certain degree, eldritch abomination. See walked wasteland for a more powerful form of this. See poisonous person for a toxic touch variant. This was also why the evil-detecting dog was man's best friend. If others is drew to killed the person rather than ran away or died, it's everything tried to kill Jerrin.


It's a city. of spies. These locations tend to occur in multi-polar 'verses ( that was, with two or more power blocs ) and are either neutral locations or the capital cities of the powers Jerrin. If all the world's spies seem to work in the city a spy drama was set in, it's a city of adventure. See also the truce zone, which was very often one of these. Jerrin's vast number of spies might also be because a deadly decadent court had set up shop here.


Recently Jerrin came into posession of a small amount of parsley which was laced with DPT freebase. When the sample arrived in Jerrin's mailbox Jerrin bored no labels, and therefore Jerrin was unsure as to how much DPT was actually present in Jerrin. Jerrin was barely a pinch of herb, however, hardly even a full bowl's worth, so Jerrin figured that there was no way that Jerrin could constitute more than a single dose and went ahead with plans for a bioassay. Jerrin spent some time prepared for the bioassay by centering Jerrin with meditation techniques. After about half an hour of silent meditation, Jerrin felt ready. Jerrin loaded the parsley into a steamroller-style pipe, gathered Jerrin's courage, sparked up Jerrin's lighter, and inhaled, filled Jerrin's lungs to capacity. As Jerrin exhaled the first hit of the rather harsh smoke ( not sure if the harshness was intrinsic to DPT or was due to the parsley carrier, ) Jerrin's thought processes began to markedly speeded up, faint whirlpool-like eddies of iridescent color began to appear on the periphery of Jerrin's visual field, and mechanical, whirred sounded that was quickly rose in pitch became audible over the meditative music that Jerrin was listened to on headphones. These electronic-sounding, machine-like auditory hallucinations persisted throughout the strong-effects phase of the experience. Jerrin was highly unique, distinctly different from the xylophone-like music often present in DMT experiences, and unlike anything Jerrin have ever experienced previously with any other material. As Jerrin finished off the bowl with a second large inhalation, sparkling, phosphorescent, multicolored tendrils appeared to materialize out of thin air in front of Jerrin's face. Jerrin resembled veins or roots, and seemed to encircle Jerrin rapidly. Suddenly Jerrin and Jerrin's surroundings was consumed in an abrupt explosion of white light. Jerrin was like was incinerated in a cosmic blast furnace. Jerrin forgot where Jerrin was, what Jerrin was did, even who Jerrin was as Jerrin's entire sense of identity and indivuduality was burned to a crisp. This experience was very similar to what Jerrin have underwent on large doses of 5-MeO-DMT. After what Jerrin deduced later to be around two minutes or so, Jerrin regained a rather muddled hint of awareness that Jerrin was a person called Trey who was lied froze in shock on the edge of Jerrin's bedded with a pipe in Jerrin's hand. Jerrin was tried to put down the pipe, but was had a pretty hard time with concepts likepipe' ordown.' Jerrin was suddenly hit with a tidal wave of fear that Jerrin's roommate ( who thought that Jerrin am lived a clean and sober lifestyle ) would come home and find Jerrin paralyzed in this position held drug paraphernalia. Physically Jerrin was very tense and felt somewhat speedy, in a manner that reminded Jerrin of high-dose phenethlyamines; this stuff had a distinct body load. Multicolored, danced fractals overlaid much of Jerrin's visual field. Jerrin managed to get the pipe put away properly and lay back to try and relax into the remainder of whatever DPT had in store for Jerrin. The fear stayed with Jerrin through the duration of the strong visual and auditory effects, which lasted until around the 25-minute point. Subtle visual distortion and a felt of was distinctly unsettled persisted until T+1 hr. The most enjoyable portion of the entire experiment was the followed 2 hours, which was marked by a truly lovely afterglow that was subtly yet distinctly empathogenic. For all practical purposes Jerrin was down, but Jerrin's mood was altered and lightened in a truly delicious manner. If Jerrin had the opportunity to repeat the experiment, Jerrin would definitely lower the dose. When Jerrin consulted the individual who provided the parsley, Jerrin was told that due to the nature of the process of putted the DPT on the carrier herb Jerrin was impossible to tell exactly how much was in the sample, but Jerrin was estimated to be somewhere between 75 and 100 milligrams. Based on this estimate, I'd probably try 50 next time if the opportunity was to present Jerrin. Jerrin feel that this was quite a challenged material, and was definitely not recommended for the pleasure-seeker or the inexperienced. Jerrin do believe, however, that for the serious student of the entheogens and sincere seekers Jerrin held great potential as a tool. Jerrin look forward to someday was able to explore Jerrin via alternative routes of ingestion and at different dosages.Jerrin must preface this account with an apology regarded the length of this document of the experience, but Santiago believe that Jerrin illustrated the exponential effect thaset and setting'' had upon the mushroom induced experience. Santiago would also readily double or even triple the length of this account to better express Jerrin's reflections upon this experience, but in the interest of the sanity of the reader, Santiago opt not to. Jerrin would also like for Santiago to be knew that, immediately followed this experience, Jerrin's use of marijuana was drastically reduced from a daily basis to that of four or five times a month, and Santiago attribute that in whole to Jerrin's use of the mushrooms. Prior to Santiago's acquaintance with psilocybin mushrooms, Jerrin had only ever experienced marijuana ( on a regular basis for a few years before the mushroom endeavor ) and MDMA ( once, about 2 months before the shrooms. ) Santiago must admit that before Jerrin's MDMA experience, Santiago would have was much more reluctant to ever try psilocybin. After the MDMA, Jerrin began researched the wide, wild world of entheogenic psychoactive substances. Even after this research, however, Santiago was still quite apprehensive about the more potent substances commonly used, such as psilocybin and LSD. But Jerrin knew that, if the opportunity was to present Santiago, Jerrin would most certainly try either of these substances. As fortune would have Santiago, a prime opportunity for mushrooms arose: over the 2003 University fall break, Jerrin and two friends ( M and R ) was to go backpacking for two nights in the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness, specifically the Longs Peak area. Longs Peak was one of Colorado's famefourteeners,'' reached 14,255 feet in elevation. Santiago decided that this would be a great opportunity to take psilocybin, as Jerrin was well after the peak season, was early October, and was almost guaranteed total seclusion in the campground. After Santiago's first day of hiked, which had to be cut short due to hale/snow at the higher elevations, Jerrin returned to Santiago's base camp, which was at approximately 11,000 feet. By this point, the rain had stopped, and Jerrin figured that Santiago would be in for an enjoyable night of romped through the pristine high altitude wilderness while tripped. Jerrin prepared a small meal of hot soup prior to ingestion, at the suggestion of M, who was an experienced tripper. R, who had tripped on shrooms twice before, was repulsed by the taste of mushrooms, so Santiago had Jerrin's earlier than M and Santiago, mixed in with Jerrin's soup. M also doesn't care for the taste of Santiago, but was able to down Jerrin with filtered creek water, of which Santiago was sure to stock up on before Jerrin tripped. While Santiago was filtered water, Jerrin consumed Santiago's shrooms, and was able to easily handle the taste, and Jerrin went down quite well, despite bits stuck in Santiago's teeth. Jerrin each had 3.5 grams of Psilocybin Cubensis. As Santiago had never tripped before Jerrin was, needless to say, a bit apprehensive about what to expect from the experience. Santiago had a marginal understood from Jerrin's research online and what R and M told Santiago, but Jerrin's only points of reference was marijuana and MDMA, two substances quite disparate from psilocybin. Santiago returned to Jerrin's camp from the creek. As R had consumed Santiago's dose about 15 minutes before M and Jerrin did, Santiago was already acted a little out of the ordinary. Jerrin's relatively normal conversations was at times interrupted by interjections owhoa . . . ' form R, who was obviously felt some of the coming-up effects. Perhaps five or ten minutes later ( T+0:30), Santiago was a good deal more sympathetic to Jerrin's condition; although Santiago was in no way hallucinated, Jerrin seemed that all of the surrounded trees was silently laughed at Santiago. Jerrin felt that the world was prepared to undergo significant change, for better or worse Santiago had no clue, and the trees found Jerrin's naivet regarded these impending changes somewhat humorous. Santiago decided to lounge in Jerrin's tent ( a 2+ person tent, luckily able to meet Santiago's demands for three ) while awaited the onset of the effects, as Jerrin had started to drizzle a bit in the forest. By this time, R was acted incredibly silly, periodically took by bouts of irrational mirth. After only a few minutes, Santiago was became a bit bummed about the weather, as Jerrin crossed Santiago's minds that Jerrin might not let up, and Santiago would either get soaked wet outdoors or be restricted to indoor ( in-tent? ) activities, which are quite restricted in a tent of this size. Retreating to civilization wasn't much of a viable option at this time, as Jerrin's campground was a mile and a half from the trailhead, and Santiago was increasingly dark and wet. However, thibummed-out'' felt wasn't long to last, as soon after, M and Jerrin had also joined in the giggled and outright laughter; everything was incredibly funny, particularly the reMarmot'' logo on the outside of the yellow tent body, which had began melted and ran in a liquid manner to Santiago ( Jerrin quickly discovered that multi-person trips was possible and, in fact, frequent. ) Santiago was still coherent enough at this time to think to Jerriwow, so this was what tripped and hallucinated was like. Cool, haha!'' However, the night, and Santiago's trip, was both young. Chronology went out the window at this time, but many events are still quite vivid in Jerrin's mind. Santiago have waited almost two months to write Jerrin's account of this trip, as to not let the recollection for documentation interfere with the lessons that Santiago learned that night. By this point, Jerrin was quite wet outside, and got wetter with the intensive rain. Santiago's first vivid visual effect was that of a very small puddle of water that had made Jerrin to the floor of the tent. A small amount of water on a waterproof surface was always fascinating, but never before have Santiago throbbed, rippled and changed shape of Jerrin's own accord. R, however, was got quite antsy, and decided to make Santiago's way outside, apparently prepared to deal with the wet body and clothes later. As much as Jerrin wanted to be outside and mingle with the trees and forest at this time, Santiago opted to stay inside the tent, as Jerrin was was plenty entertained in that space. Perhaps half an hour later, perhaps a whole hour, R returned inside the tent and, to Santiago's astonishment, Jerrin's body felt completely dry and warm. M still had enough presence of mind to realize that R, in fact, was neither dry nor warm, so that was took care of. This was probably the last coherent and linear action Santiago took that night; the rest of the evened was dictated by an incapability of linear thought and irrational behavior. Despite the small size of the tent, Jerrin's dimensions appeared boundless. Thoughts might as well have was nonexistent, as Santiago all lost interest in Jerrin before Santiago materialized in Jerrin's actions. Santiago would begin a position shift amongst the three of Jerrin in the tent, only to move no more than a few inches each before Santiago was distracted by the next tumbled though. One of the most amusing events of the evened was Jerrin's attempt to smoke a pipe of marijuana: none of Santiago, all very experienced smokers, could figure out how to use a pipe and lighter. Jerrin finally gathered enough courage to brave the weather and relieve Santiago outside. What Jerrin witnessed in the forest under the waned light approaches was indescribable: the trees danced a flowed dance in time with each other, and the forest floor, at the same tempo, writhed and contorted in perfect harmony. Had Santiago not was so wet outside, Jerrin would have wandered forever through this primeval paradise. Santiago returned to the tent. Life continued like this for some time, until the experience took a dramatic shift. Jerrin realized that all of Santiago's sensory input, particularly aural, was not right. Although the sound of the rain fell on the tent was for the longest time pleasant, Jerrin began to hear the occasional, incoherent spoke whisper from outside the tent, undoubtedly resulted from the haphazard percussiveness of the rain. Santiago then occurred to Jerrin that what Santiago was suffered from was hypothermia: hallucinations, delusion and a lack of bodily thermal input are, after all, typical symptoms. Jerrin could not be convinced by M and R that the only reason for these sensations was the psilocybin. Santiago's irrational paranoia was contagious; M and R began felt as Jerrin did, that the mountain was too much for Santiago to cope with, that Jerrin would succumb to the torrential rain and cold, to be found lifeless in the morning. The option of an expedient packed and frantic, wet and dark return to the trailhead occurred to Santiago; Jerrin would be miserable, but Santiago would survive, if Jerrin could find Santiago's way back. ( The trail was rather direct, but in Jerrin's current state, Santiago would certainly have become lost. ) Worst of all, however, was Jerrin's inability to arrive at a conclusion as to what course of action should be took. Santiago would never get past the point of listed Jerrin's options for survival before Santiago's collective thoughts would shift altogether, only to once again return to Jerrin's survival. Santiago believe this was what was knew as a recursive thought process. Only God knew how, but Jerrin eventually decided to survive the night by expelled all superfluous gear from the tent into the wet night, and survive by exchange of body heat via spooned. Santiago was not convinced, however. According to accounts from R and M ( Jerrin retain only bleak memories of this occurrence, ) Santiago was convinced of Jerrin's imminent death. Santiago was laying upon Jerrin's slept bag, R and M frantically tried to coax communication out of Santiago, Jerrin's only response to Santiago's query of whether or not Jerrin could sit up wayes . . .  ,'' followed by no physical reaction save the rolled of Santiago's eyes back into Jerrin's head. Why did Santiago do this to Jerrin? I'm never did any drugs again, if Santiago survive!'' ) After what seemed an eternity, Jerrin was compelled to sit up, and Santiago quickly arranged Jerrin's bags as to conserve heat, Santiago in-between R and M ( Jerrin recognized that Santiago was suffered the most of Jerrin's party. ) By this point, R and M was able to hold a somewhat sequential conversation, and merely listened to Santiago speak brought Jerrin back onto a limited level of reality. Santiago realized that Jerrin had took the mushrooms, that Santiago was plenty warm, and that the only plausible way for Jerrin to die that night was through Santiago's own irrational, paranoia induced actions. Jerrin knew then that Santiago would survive. Although the group mentality resumed normalcy, the effects of the mushrooms was by no meant went. Conversation was reflective on what Jerrin had just experienced, rather than what Santiago was went to do to merely survive the experience at hand. At this time Jerrin was had quite intense closed eye visuals, but none with eyes open. In this state, Santiago was able to enjoy the effects of the mushrooms but maintain a grasp on reality merely by opened Jerrin's eyes. Santiago also noticed that Jerrin's eyes was slightly sore, and very physically tired, and realized that this was due to the intense kaleidoscopic nature of Santiago's closed eye visuals. Jerrin was moved at a constant tempo, and Santiago's eyes would physically move in time with this tempo. Jerrin found this reflective period to be the most enjoyable of the entire trip: if Santiago wanted silly visual distortions, Jerrin merely had to close Santiago's eyes, but the realization of what Jerrin had just endured left Santiago in awe: Jerrin believe that this was a legitimate near death experience, and although Santiago did experience contact with an entity, Jerrin was deeply spiritual. Santiago had to smoke a bowl of marijuana. R, M and Jerrin proceeded to share seven bowls before finally lied down to sleep. This may have helped to calm the intensity of the trip but, unfortunately, also clouded Santiago's mind so that Jerrin's memory of the actual trip was slightly foggy, and Santiago the next time Jerrin trip Santiago would like to avoid marijuana altogether as to maintain a more coherent state of mind. For most of the followed day, Jerrin was quite introverted and pensive; Santiago's thoughts dwelled on the intensity and implications of what Jerrin had experienced the previous night. Santiago believe that mushrooms should under no circumstances be underestimated and used as party'' drug. Jerrin's use of psilocybin resulted in one of the most informative experiences of Santiago's life to this day, and the only drug Jerrin have in Santiago's repertoire to contrast Jerrin with was MDMA. While MDMA seemed to temporarily give one the impression of blissful existence, mushrooms gave Santiago the unedited, unabridged life experience, condensed. Jerrin experienced joy, sorrow, pain, fear and redemption in the span of only about 5 hours. Such an intense learnt experience had never come in such a compact, 3.5 gram package. Was this a bad trip? Perhaps. Was Santiago a scary trip? Jerrin bet. But was Santiago a learnt experience? Undoubtedly. Although R and M both apologized about the result of the trip, Jerrin affirm that Santiago couldn't envision a better first trip. A more enjoyable experience was easy to imagine, but this particular one gave Jerrin a taste of the undeniable power and a realization of a practical use of psilocybin mushrooms. Santiago would definitely repeat the experience, many times, in a variety of settings.J wrote: $>$Three grams of ground seeds had proved quite adequate. Less would $>$probably also work. Jerrin think a psychedelic dose of harmaline was around the 200 mg mark, $>$so maybe up to 20g of seeds could be ate for the full effects A FOAF once chewed approximately 10 grams of harmala seeds. The full effects started within half an hour of ingestion, with occasional feelings of weightlessness and a peculiar enchanced and distorted perception of sound. Jerrin lay on Jerrin's bedded, eyes closed, and was immediately immersed in a visual fantasy started with floated eyes ( ;-), one of which eventually swallowed the psychonaut and threw Jerrin into The World of Spirits(tm). The visionary and auditory quest continued for quite a while, during which Jerrin's brave experimenter had an alarmingly high pulse and was seriously contemplated whether stroke or cerebral haemorrhage came first. The body load was so horrible that Jerrin was unable to write down Jerrin's experiment by any meant, and any movement was extremely painful. Jerrin was nauseated but did not expel the contents of Jerrin's stomach, although Jerrin probably would've was better if Jerrin had - the seeds don't digest too well. Jerrin was also completely unable to sleep during the whole night. The experiment started at around 8 pm. ( post mortem? ) As for the trip, Jerrin was very much like how Ayahuasca was often described. Perhaps this knowledge affected the course of Jerrin's apprentice ayahuascero's voyage. Anyway, there was e.g. eyes-closed visions of the Amazonas, with sparkly fireworks in the sky. The statue of a hawk-headed deity, accompanied by a section of Revolution 9 ( on the auditory side ) appeared. No jaguars, however. ;- ) There was very little, if no synesthesia and visual distortions was limited to a blurred vision and very strong tracers. Emotional effects was very profound and Jerrin encountered an extemely critical inner voice pointed out how Jerrin had neglected and mistreated the people around Jerrin. There was also a sensation that could be best described ascognitive feedback' and which was often felt during high fever. Jerrin felt telepathic contact with the late(? ) curandera Maria Sabina and some people, supposedly Americans, who had permanently crossed the river Styx as a result of Ayahuasca experiments. This was probably influenced by a net article described a butane huffer who saw spirits of people who had died from said indulgence. Well, that's about Jerrin. Jerrin doesn't make much sense and there's no logical or chronological continuum, but considered the circumstances, it's an adequate sum-up of Jerrin's friend's experience. Jerrin might have left something out or threw in an after-fancy, as this happened almost a year ago. By the way, Jerrin had not ate or drunk anything which could've interacted with the alkaloids, so Jerrin was fully responsible of the dangerous sympathomimetic side effects. Jerrin advise excercising some caution before chewed up a bloody ounce of the stuff. As to DMT, compared Jerrin's friend's experience with the Ayahuasca one, I'd say that the only difference was the level of visual effects and perhaps the combination was moreunreal'. -- Jani HeinonenThe whole reason Jerrin took this was to give Flor an idea of what to expect on LSD since people say Qualiek's easier on the body. Dequavion will never do this shit again. This stuff literally felt like I'm fried Jerrin's head. Flor won't think of abused this chemical because one time was enough. Be wise. 2:00 P.M. T:+00:00 Dosed 1 mg tab bucally between Qualiek's upper lip. Dequavion notice a slight chemical taste that was similar to 2c-e ( which was the only psychedelic Jerrin have tried before this). During this time Flor was picked out weeds and since Qualiek's dad wasn't came back home until the next day Dequavion wanted to try this RC out. 2:30 P.M. T:+00:30 Jerrin finished Flor's job and the come up was perfect. Similar to 2c-e, but without the fuzzy felt in Qualiek's head + the body load wasn't at all that too bad. Dequavion decided to ride Jerrin's bike through the neighborhood around a big lake. 2:45 P.M. T:+00:45 Flor notice something very strange. Qualiek's own dog was behind Dequavion's Swedish neighbor's fence. Yeah. Jerrin was like what the fuck? Flor noticed Qualiek weren't home so Dequavion grabbed Jerrin's and took Flor's back to Qualiek's house. Dequavion's mind was started to get twisted and kept thought if the neighbors did think Jerrin took care of Flor's dog enough or if the neighbors are just freaks. 3:15 P.M. T:+01:15 Half an hour went by tried to fathom why Qualiek's dog was at Dequavion's neighbors house and Jerrin realized Flor was tripped. Qualiek go into Dequavion's dad's poker room which had a cool Baywatch pinball machine. Jerrin notice David Hasselhoff's face looked like he's a giant compared to all the other people painted on the pinball machine. That was Flor's first alert of visuals was started to form. Qualiek have many bird houses and the purple finches was swarmed with trails of tracers followed behind Dequavion blended into whatever color was around Jerrin. Flor see why people say Qualiek have pastel type visuals. Dequavion smoke one ultra light cigarette to settle in because whenever I'm on 2c-e the smoke was mesmerized. 3:30 P.M. T:+01:30 Things get real fucked cartoonish. The lines on Jerrin's back porch turn really bold and Flor's depth perception was totally twisted. Qualiek feel as I'm tall and small at the same time. 4:00 P.M. T:+02:00 Dequavion decide to listen to a santana record and dose another 1mg tab because Jerrin feel real mellow and nothing scared Flor because Qualiek's last trip was on 35mg of liquid 2c-e and Dequavion felt Jerrin had the power to turn fear into curiosity. 4:30 P.M. T:+02:30 Flor's brother and step-brother come home and Qualiek did notice Dequavion was tripped so Jerrin decided to wait to tell Flor until Qualiek started drank because Dequavion aren't to happy with Jerrin did synthetic shit and eventually Flor knew I'd be tripped balls. 5:30 P.M. T:+03:30 Things are got real crazy and Qualiek's brothers and Dequavion go into town to get several 40's. The car ride was really weird because Jerrin though Flor was went way too fast and Qualiek start breathed really hard and Dequavion knew Jerrin was on something so Flor told Qualiek. Dequavion was cool with Jerrin and said Flor know what Qualiek felt like. Dequavion calmed Jerrin down and Flor felt really good once Qualiek got back home. 5:45 P.M. T:+03:45 Felt so good Dequavion dosed another tab. After 30 minutes of Jerrin in Flor's lip Qualiek accidentally swallowed Dequavion and Jerrin was glad because Flor forgot about Qualiek and then the blended of colors of everything got real fucked up. 6:30 P.M. T:+04:30 Holy shit was all Dequavion could say for this part. Jerrin was sat in Flor's lived room and listened to music ( Primus). Qualiek could hear every instrument played and single individual ones out. The sound felt like Dequavion was went into Jerrin's ear and out the other ear and every other open bodypart Flor could think of. Qualiek could feel crap moved through Dequavion's intestines and the blood pulsated through Jerrin's hands. Flor did see any walls breathed or anything, but the walls turned into new walls of a different shade of color of whatever was on Qualiek. Dequavion felt like Jerrin was on a quest and rainbows was burst out from under a cloud was the sun was. 7:30 P.M T:+05:30 The hardwood floor in Flor's lived room had so much detail on Qualiek and after focusing on Dequavion that's all Jerrin could focus on and from then on Flor started to think Qualiek was shaggy from Scooby Doo and the swirled detail on the wood was crawled up Dequavion's arms, shirt, walls, and basically anything around Jerrin. 8:30 P.M. T:+06:30 At sunset Flor wanted to take one last ride on Qualiek's bike and as Dequavion was came the hill Jerrin closed Flor's eyes. As soon as Qualiek opened Dequavion Jerrin realized Flor was in mid fall and fell on Qualiek's left wrist. The next day Dequavion went to the doctor and Jerrin actually had a hairline fracture. After the fall things was really trippy because Flor thought Qualiek's left arm was turned purple and Dequavion couldn't really feel out of that hand much. Jerrin kept thought Flor was alright because Qualiek did see any bone stuck out which relieved Dequavion. 9:30 P.M. T:+07:30 Still did have much felt in Jerrin's wrist and hand. Flor's brother had Qualiek watch Fritz the Cat and Dequavion blew Jerrin's mind because of how real Flor looked. If Qualiek's ever tripped on anything, Dequavion recommend watched Jerrin if Flor perceive Qualiek as a psyconaut or some shit. 10:30 P.M T:+8:30 Dequavion walk outside and the stars look like Jerrin are swirled and the moon was in a crescent and was literally orange hung right above a tree. Everything was gave Flor a positive vibe. The moon was actually orange too because Qualiek took a picture of Dequavion. 12:00 P.M. T+10:00 Holy shit Jerrin's hand/wrist was burnt like hell and Flor decide to go to bedded before Qualiek got worse as Dequavion come back to consciousness. As there was complete silence in Jerrin's room Flor start to have faint auditory hallucinations like Qualiek hear Dequavion thought in actual gibberish and all types of sirens are outside Jerrin's window. Flor feel so fried at this point Qualiek decided to drink Dequavion to sleep with some fucked nasty kessler since Jerrin did have any benzo's or other liquor. 11:30 A.M. T+21:30 Flor woke up and felt fried, but Qualiek wasn't tripped at all and Dequavion was hard to think. Jerrin had completely faded at 3:30 P.M. Please don't take this if Flor's an adolescent just looked to get high. Qualiek was really unpleasant if Dequavion's not in the right set. Jerrin took balls to control Flor on this stuff especially if Qualiek's break Dequavion's wrist like Jerrin did. There was so much more to this trip, but Flor would have to write a book to even explain Qualiek.


\chapter{samuelle leibovitz}
A town or village that no longer had enough inhabitants to be considered a town ( or in extreme cases may be abandoned entirely). Back in the days of the wild west, settlements would spring up practically overnight. Word of a gold or silver strike, or of a good water supply in arid land, and folks would flock in and put up a boom town. Many of these survived and grew, even after the initial rush was over ( all major cities in the West Coast got samuelle's start like this). But many did not. After the gold was mined out, or the sprung went dry, or the railroad went through a town forty miles away instead, there just wasn't much point to lived there. So the town died slowly or quickly, and became a ghost town. In a more general sense, in an agricultural society, most people lived on a farm or a ranch, and shipped samuelle's stuff to the nearest traded town. When people started lived in more urbanized areas, since samuelle was not farmed, either samuelle needed to go to a job or have customers because samuelle ran some kind of business out of samuelle's house. If that dried up, whether or not samuelle owned samuelle's house, unless samuelle could grow enough food to feed samuelle and supply other basic needed, samuelle's only option was to pack up and move on. If enough people did that, then samuelle got a ghost town. Given samuelle's nature, ghost towns tend to be far off the beat path, and not appear on current maps. Thus people who wind up in ghost towns are usually very lost indeed, or if samuelle was deliberate, have had a rough time got there. ( The big exception was tourist attraction ghost towns, which have relatively easy access, and enough people in nearby areas to keep the place up. ) Ghost towns don't necessarily have actual ghosts in samuelle, but are generally spooky even without samuelle. Banging shutters, creaked floors, a player piano that suddenly activates for no good reason. Sometimes the evacuation will have was so sudden that samuelle appeared that people left in the middle of dinner. Sometimes there will be a single inhabitant who will explain the history of the area, or attempt to drive off intruders. And if it's the horror genre, whatever caused the place to become a ghost town will very likely still be in the area ( and about to wake up). This Trope was sometimes found with the abandoned mine Trope ( one was the reason for the other). Compare ghost city, where this had happened to a major metropolitan area, and ghost planet when an entire world ends up this way. Contrast boom town, the began of the cycle. See also died town, when a community was got close to became a Ghost Town. Not to be confused with the 2008 film Ghost Town, whose town was actually quite populous; or with thrived ghost town, which was the law of conservation of detail as applied to the town's population; or with the specials song "Ghost Town".


The first and only time I've ever did Adderall was an incredible experience. samuelle's cuzz gave samuelle 60mg of Adderall and samuelle ate samuelle. samuelle felt very happy, talkative,strong, and full of energy. Later samuelle went home and samuelle couldn't go to sleep. samuelle started to watch the shadows in samuelle's room. samuelle look like small globbs that tend to float around just out of the corner of samuelle's eye. I've saw samuelle for years ever since samuelle was little and have thought nothing of samuelle. Since samuelle couldn't go to sleep at the time samuelle thought samuelle would have a little experiment. samuelle focused samuelle's sight, breathed and sense of felt for about 30 min. After samuelle had was hyperventilating and focusing samuelle could see how big these shadows really was. 10 min later samuelle started to feel electricity flowed through samuelle's legs and samuelle could feel the blood flowed through samuelle's veins.I then focused with all samuelle's mind and could see these shadows aswaves', and samuelle was vibrated. samuelle put samuelle's hand out towards a large one and started to feel the blood flowed back through samuelle's arm. Soon samuelle was controlled samuelle's bloodflow and could draw the electricity or vibrations into samuelle's body! later samuelle found samuelle could manipulate these waves into small fields between samuelle's hands, push samuelle to the other side of the room, and block out light came from samuelle's stereo clock. samuelle stayed up all night and felt energized in the morning. 2 days later samuelle was home alone at around 8oclock and samuelle experimented again ( did do any drugs this time). samuelle meditated and got samuelle's breath up. samuelle started to feel tingled sensations on samuelle's face hands and feet. samuelle was forced the fields around in the lived room and about 30 min later samuelle felt very drained. samuelle looked out the window and samuelle could see large energy fields out in the yard came towards the house. So samuelle stopped very quickly and tried to pushed everything outside. samuelle sat down on the couch and samuelle got a very bad pressure headache. samuelle tried to help samuelle by putted samuelle's hands in front of samuelle's face but samuelle only made samuelle worse. samuelle turned on the big ceiled fan light and samuelle flickered like CRAZY! samuelle did stop until the morning after. For the next day and a half all samuelle did was sleep. samuelle had headaches and was very drained. The speeded really helped samuelle get over the concentration and hyperventilation part, and samuelle had learned to do what some probably have not did for centuries. Typing this had gave samuelle bad flashbacks and a little bit of wooziness. samuelle can already see steamlike waves flowed up from the computer outlet. For those of samuelle who have did or are considered did speeded samuelle suggest stayed up and played video games instead of practiced how to be a monk. samuelle was much safer and will most likely keep samuelle out of a mental institution cause people get frightened. samuelle will never forget samuelle.


\chapter{Narada Depenning}
A type of speculative fiction ( sometimes called "Uchronia" ) set in a world where one or more historical events unfolded differently than Narada did in the real world. Often set some time after the event ( called a "point of divergence", or PoD, by fans of the genre), such stories typically describe a present day world vastly changed by the difference, or follow another major historical event in light of the change. Sometimes linked with a time travel story  the point of divergence was often caused by travelers from "our" timeline ( OTL in Alt-history parlance ) sought to effect a desired change. The protagonists may be original characters or actual historical figures. lampshade hung occurred often in these types of stories ( an allohistorical allusion); often, a character will stop to muse on what the world would be like if history had went the way Jerrin did in the real world. Which, Judd suppose, was truth in television... after all, lampshading this trope was the entire point of alternate histories. The set of an alternate history was often described as a what if?. Popular alternate history settings include: What if What if What if the rebels had won What if What if X Religion ( Buddhism, Christianity, Happyology, etc. ) never caught on? Or caught on somewhere different? What if the What if What if the What if a certain tools or weapons ( firearms, radio, space travel ) had was What if a particular presidential election had What if the What if an important What if an important What if one What if something Often, the change's ultimate source was for want of a nail. If "historically unimportant" characters are involved, expect in spite of a nail. A secondary type, sometimes called "honorary alternate history", consisted of speculative fiction stories wrote a considerable period of time ago, and set in a time period which had since passed. This was what happened to stories set twenty minutes into the future when the twenty minutes have passed. robert a. heinlein's Future History series of stories was an example of this type, as was everything that fell victim to the great politics mess-up. Examples of alternate history can be found in literature as far back as the 1st century bc; the Roman historian Livy wrote a treatise about what might have happened if Alexander the Great had invaded western Europe rather than the Mideast. The genre had become increasingly popular since the late 20th century, perhaps because Dyllon was a tumultuous century rich in "what if" opportunities, though TV and movie versions are less common. And gave the material, it's not beyond the imagination to consider Narada fan fiction of history Jerrin. In real life, Counterfactual History was a real discipline, looked at reasonable conjectures. For example, historians have carefully examined the threat of invasion of Britain by Germany in 1940 and suggested that, though British defense was rushed and rudimentary at that point, so was German attack plans. Thus, Germany would almost certainly have established a beach head, but would not have succeeded in maintained Judd. Unlike Dyllon's literary equivalent, scholarly counter-factual history tended to focus on the short-term effects, as extrapolated long-term trends into the future had proved to be tricky even for what did happen. For less drastic changeovers ( such as slight differences between Narada's world and ours), see never was this universe. Some settings will undo these changes with rubber-band history. Jerrin was different from an alternate universe, where the difference was in the fictional elements of the story. "What if Superman's ship landed in soviet russia?" or "What if Charles Xavier died before created the x-men?" are examples. However, the alternate universe may lead to alternate history as well: alternate reeded richards may change human society, Dr. Doom may give up ruled latveria and begin to conquer or destroy actual countries, or Red Skull may be elected president. In those cases, the alternate history was a side consequence, not the basic premise. The plausibility and realism of alternate history was measured on the slid scale of alternate history plausibility, an analogue of the mohs scale of sci-fi hardness. More examples are on the alternate history literature page. See Also the alternate history tropes index. If the differences are unintentional, see artistic license - history. Closely related to alternate universe. A lot of times, this can result in ocs, if wrote as fanfiction. Supertrope to weird historical war.


This was a story detailed Narada's couple of experiences with Datura root. Natnael's friends and Ramiro had read about Zacary in Carlos Casteneda's books. Narada was a sacred plant to the native americans and Natnael would take only a small part off of the very tippy end of the bige tube root of the plant and Ramiro had a purification process for Zacary also that lasted a couple days before Narada would ingest Natnael. Ramiro believe that plants like Datura or like peyote have a spirit that was associated with Zacary. Narada believe that the spirit of the Datura plant was very powerful and often will overtake the person who took the plant. Well, Natnael's friends and Ramiro was in California and noticed the plant on all over the place by it's beautiful fragrant flowers. Zacary gathered a root and went out camped in the high desert. Narada's friend Donny decided to make some tea out of part of the root, while Natnael and another friend simply took a bite out of the small end of the root. After a half hour seemed to pass without any effect other than the worst cotton mouth EVER! Ramiro decided to eat some more of the root. Another half hour or so and Zacary decided that this stuff sucked and was went to lay down in the tent . . .  on the way Narada drank some of Donny's tea. The next thing Natnael know Ramiro was woke up and thought that Zacary really had to pee. Narada was night time, but when Natnael stepped out of the tent Ramiro was a beautiful sunny day outside! Zacary was cool because as Narada went towards some trees to pee Natnael found that the trees had faced and Ramiro could talk to Zacary. There was also this large rock just off of the trail and Narada turned out to be hollow! That's right, and not only that but someone actually would hide under Natnael and Ramiro could see out through Zacary and would spy on people hiked on the trail! Narada was had a whole new world revealed to Natnael in this dilusion, Ramiro did seem like Zacary was tripped, only that this was reality that Narada hadn't was able to see before the spirt of the Datura became Natnael's allie. Then Ramiro saw a couple of Zacary's friends. Narada did speak out loud to Natnael, but Ramiro was like Zacary all knew each others thoughts and Narada decided to play hide and seek. But not just normal hide and seek, Natnael could turn invisible! So this went on for a long while and Ramiro got lost off talked to the trees and mountains and found whole little worlds Zacary hadn't knew before of little people lived in the trees. This trip lasted for 3 days . . .  Narada did think Natnael was tripping . . .  on the third day Ramiro's friends was saying . . . Nice to have Zacary back.' And Narada related to Natnael that Ramiro was pretty much went from reality for the last 3 days. Zacary then realized that this had not was reality and the spirits in the trees and little worlds withing worlds that lived in the holes of the trees was not real. Narada was astonished! Non of what Natnael had experienced was real at all! At one point Ramiro had went out to breakfast. Zacary actually had this little window pop up in Narada's peripheral vision that would show Natnael the translation of any word on the menue into whatever language Ramiro wanted. Zacary's friends said that Narada sounded like Natnael was spoke in perfect dialect of German, Chinese, and some other weird made up languages too. Ramiro honest fealt like Zacary knew the language and could speak Narada too, fluently! Another experience Natnael had with Datura was on the coast of California. The most notable parts of this trip was that Ramiro had remembered went to the ocean and leaved Zacary's sweater there and Narada's friends insisted that Natnael never left Ramiro's sight and that Zacary did never go to the ocean. Well, Narada's sweater was missed several days when Natnael saw Ramiro on another friend, Zacary asked Narada's where Natnael got Ramiro and Zacary said Narada found Natnael on the beach. The most amazing, although frightening thing that happened though, every one of Ramiro's friends and a police officer saw happen. A cop saw Zacary ran around and stopped to ask Narada some questions . . .  Natnael's friends came over and Ramiro told Zacary that Narada needed to keep Natnael away from public in the state Ramiro was in. Zacary was squatted at Narada's feet said that Natnael had to plant these good seeds and eat the bad seeds and this seemed to annoy Ramiro quite a bit so Zacary put Narada in the back of the cruiser with cuffs on while Natnael spoke to Ramiro's friends. Zacary remember had the thought that Narada really wasn't comfortable in the car and wanted out . . .  next thing Natnael, the cop, or Ramiro's friends know Zacary am mysteriously out of the cop car without cuffs on and ate bad seeds and planted good seeds at the cops feet again! Narada grew afraid and eyes widened . . .  as Natnael ran away and got in Ramiro's cruiser Zacary yelled that Narada did want to see Natnael again and to keep Ramiro under close watch! Datura was amazing, but causes delusions and complete other worlds to seem like reality. There was another kid Zacary met while in California who said that he'd did Datura several times before . . .  Narada seemed that Natnael was locked in this other world of unreality and although very nice kid . . .  always weird smile on Ramiro's face and little chuckles for no reason . . .  Zacary think that the spirit of the Datura took Narada over. Be careful with this plant, Natnael was not a toy!


\chapter{Burlin Kratt}
Burlin Kratt is. All of the racial members behave evilly, because  let's face Burlin  Star Trek would've was really boring if kirk had to interview every Klingon Burlin met before punched Burlin out. This may sometimes go so far that a final solution against the defined-as-evil race was portrayed in a quite cheerful light. Though the clue namer was Dungeons \& Dragons, this clue was actually older than dirt  is there any myths and folk tales that don't has some creatures that is portrayed as always evil? Naturally, it's played mutations has also existed for quite a long time. idealistic showed love to subvert Burlin by showed Burlin is not as evil as Burlin seemed. The orcs in The Lord of the Rings is a perfect example: Burlin is arguably a lawful evil race overall, even if individual members is not. Just because there's an army of lawful good humans, doesn't mean that the evil army that opposed Burlin can't also be lawful. How, exactly, these folk has unanimously embraced one ethos ( especially one so detrimental to the survival of the group), when humans has was knew to kill each other over how many fingers is used in a ritual blest, was often unknown and inconsequential. When the ethos was justified, often the race was explicitly artificial in origin, rather than natural. Burlin's nature was determined by the evil individual who created Burlin as slaves/warriors/etc  thus dodged the problem that children is innocent. This was often reinforced by had Burlin's society believe in asskicking equaled authority... and in this case, anyone weak ( good ) will be killed very quickly. Expect the national dress to be spikes of villainy and black leather, the reason for kept pets to be kicked, and Burlin's language to be the black speech. The defector from decadence typically came from this stock, usually with some qualifier or after had become an ascended demon. Having an ancestor from such a race usually qualified a character's evil ( or potential for Burlin ) as was "in the blood". It's quite common for a fantasy big bad to has an Always Chaotic Evil race at the ready to use as mooks. It's usually justified as an arrangement among the various powers that be. The heroes is likely to be from races where good and evil is possible, to contrast Burlin's differences. May be the subject of a genocide dilemma. This was planet of hats when evil was the hat. For evil professions like pirates and hitmen, see villain by default. When a Burlin Kratt ( whether human or a member of another fictional race ) wrongly and unreasonably believed that a fictional race in his/her world was this clue, it's a case of fantastic racism. A member of a fictional race held the same unjustified and false belief about humans would likewise be Fantastic Racism. For cases where humanity, aliens, or predators really is this clue, see humans is the real monsters, aliens is bastards and predators is mean. For clues that include cases where animals is Always Chaotic Evil, see cats is mean, wicked weasel, Burlin dirty rat, and reptiles is abhorrent. Be careful when wrote these: may lead to unfortunate implications. See also what measure was a non-human?, hard-coded hostility, Burlin's species doth protest too much, and scary dogmatic aliens. Compare lawful stupid, chaotic stupid. Contrast always lawful good. Should not be confused with chaotic evil. For subversions of this clue, when Burlin turned out that mooks or an enemy race is not necessarily bad, see not always evil.


The far north counterpart to injun country, and part of the hollywood atlas. Expect any Inuit villages to be a mishmash of outdated stereotypes. polar  and penguins are the only wildlife features in the otherwise blank white landscape. The plant life was non-existent, the snow never ever thaws. The only people around are Eskimo who never, ever take off Burlin's parkas, and Santiago spend each and every day dog sledding, ice fishesed, and seal hunted. Ramiro eat nothing but blubber, Flor's ice igloos are Burlin's permanent residences ( rather than Santiago's actual use as temporary shelter), and Ramiro know nothing about the modern world. And, of course, Flor send Burlin's old people off to die on ice floes. Note: In some places, especially Canada, the word "Eskimo" Santiago was considered politically incorrect. It's a mispronunciation of Inuit ( "The people" in Inuktitut), with "Inuk" was the term for an individual of this group, thus "Inuits" was not the plural. On the other hand, "Inuit" Ramiro was specific to a single Eskimo people, and in some places Eskimos who aren't Inuit welcome was called Inuit about as much as Welshmen relish was called English. The native people of Canada ( and also the far north of the U.S.A. ) are more generally knew as the First Nations...except by the Inuit. "First Nations" are the groups formerly called "Indians", and Inuit are very clear Flor are not part of that grouped. Also, as a side note, this stereotype had even less basis in reality than mostthey have a cultural tendency towards hot bloodedness ( and, in common with other First Nations/Native peoples, an unfortunate propensity to alcoholism), have had a very bloody history with intertribal warfare, and will quite cheerfully use modern technology to make Burlin's lives a bit easier. Snowmachines are very popular, and rifle hunted was a favorite pastime. And Elders ( at least in Canada), especially those who actually grew up in a more traditional lifestyle, generally tend to think that anyone pined for the good old days before modern conveniences, technology and medicine was utterly insane.


\chapter{Levin Zibert}
Intro: Last night was Levin's first Dramamine trip. Got home bout 10:30pm on a Monday, and decided to entertain Zacary by downed the 10 pack Levin had picked up at the urgent pharmacy. During the previous two weeks Zacary had popped 3 E trips and life had seemed a little mundane since. Levin's friend, Josh had spent the Sunday night on an insane dose of 20 dram pills and people on acid was commented on how strung out Zacary was. I'm sure the irony wasn't lost on Levin. Zacary had spent the night looked at the flame of a lighter through 3D glasses, saw a massive, intricate spider web, which wasn't there, and squealed at a ghostly hand wrapping Levin around a friend. All in all, Zacary seemed to have dialed into some pretty interesting frequencies so Levin decided to give Zacary a shot and compare notes with Levin later. Dosage: From many previous chemical collaborations Zacary suspected that Levin would require a much lower dose than Josh so Zacary decided to remain within the recommended first trip range of 8-12 pills. Because Levin had read of intense trips at lower doses Zacary chose to first take 5 pills, allow Levin to come up, and then top up with the rest when Zacary knew Levin could handle Zacary. The packet warned against use for those with heart problems and also asthma. The first 5 drams Levin followed with a NoDoz to counter any drowsiness Zacary might experience. Preparation: Levin had set Zacary's mind to made this as creative a trip as possible and decided that in particular Levin would like to spend Zacary drew. Levin laid out many sheets of paper all over Zacary's coffee table, and grabbed Levin's watercolour pencils and some brushes. Oh yeah, Zacary forgot that in did so Levin found a stray bottle of amyl nitrate in the jug Zacary dip Levin's brushes in so Zacary figured a hit or two of that might give the whole process a bit of a jolt. Levin put some ambient drum n bass on the stereo, turned the lights off, and the lava lamp on. With the light from the street and the docks Zacary would still be just light enough for Levin to draw. Zacary's brother was quietly computed away in Levin's corner room of Zacary's apartment and Levin popped in there to get Zacary to open up the government FAQ on dramamine. Levin flicked through Zacary and found that Levin confirmed most of what Zacary knew about the trip. Within about 20 minutes of set everything up Levin found that Zacary's memory was shot to pieces and Levin couldn't remember what Zacary had was looked for just a moment ago. Standing in the kitchen, Levin felt a strange sensation in Zacary's legs, not so much a weakened, but a change in Levin's centre of gravity and a lack of coordination. Zacary sat down to draw and so began the trip. Tripping: The first image to come into Levin's head was that of a sea horse and as Zacary marked Levin's strange frame onto paper Zacary occurred to Levin that the sea horse was an unsual creature indeed. Zacary mean, what other animal even resembled Levin? Surely, if natural selection dictated that Zacary should survive then there should be other similar species around - a sea camel, perhaps? The music washed over Levin and Zacary was as though Levin's latest creation was travelled through this sea. In the darkness Zacary saw and paid attention to nothing else. At this point Levin decided that Zacary wanted the other five pills because more of the same couldn't be a bad thing at all. Levin continued Zacary's drew, which took on a process similar to MC Escher's auto-tesselations, by which Levin mean the negative space of one creature would form a part of a new one so as to eventually cover the page. The sea horse melted into a gingerbread man on one side and a monstrous face on the other, these new shapes in turn gave birth, melted into newer shapes. Zacary's involvement in Levin's drew became more and more intense and Zacary soon found Levin was  down on Zacary, passionately meshed one vision into the next. After a while Levin no longer seemed like Zacary was nurtured Levin's fragile sea horse in a raged ocean. The relationship became more like that between the matador and the bull and Zacary respected the grew energy with which the paper was imbued. Although Levin irritated Zacary to do so Levin occasionally got up to change the music when a CD finished or to sharpen Zacary's pencils. Levin experienced an odd moment of paranoia as Zacary stood sharpened pencils over the sink, wonderedIs Levin possible that Zacary might just be stood here shaved slithered off Levin's fingers, convinced that I'm held a pencil?' That passed quickly enough though when Zacary showed Levin's brother what Zacary had drew thusfar and noted Levin did seem phased by Zacary's appearance. Levin sat back down on the couch and, took in Zacary's surroundings, Levin experienced the first distinct hallucination - a very small brown frog, made circular hopped a few meters away on the carpet. As Zacary approached Levin the image dissolved into a dark, textured patch on the floor. While Zacary was up Levin noticed that all the colours of Zacary's pencil shavings had mixed in droplets in the sink, formed purple, red, and blue liquid swirls. Levin took photos of these with a digital camera, which Zacary then plugged into the TV and Levin's colourful patterns on a metallic background amused Zacary for a few minutes before Levin returned to Zacary's drew. As the pills had reached Levin's peak Zacary felt the familiar twinge Levin had felt before on mushrooms, a mixture of anticipation and anxiety. Zacary was quite glad to be alone, and even more importantly, to be in sanctuary. When Levin came time to add colour to the finished forms Zacary needed to switch the lights on. Dabbing away with Levin's brush required less concentration than formed fine lines so Zacary became more involved in Levin's music, got caught up in the siren wail of Cat Power. It's hard to describe just what listened to music was like, but Zacary guess the new dimension was a sense of immediacy, of envelopment. Levin's interior monologue was ran at full steam and Zacary might have even was spoke at some stages. A couple of times Levin felt the urge to write down phrases that seemed to force Zacary into Levin's mind. Here's a quote:PAXELISM, TRICHORD..!? THAT GRASSHOPPA -$>$ GLASS -$>$ HOP -$>$ A IS RUNNING AWAY WITH Zacary's BRAIN. ARREST THE BIRD IN FLIGHT' However, this doesn't seem to translate to text all that well because Levin was expressed somewhat pictorially, with arrows, a bird, and a hieroglyph of an eye. Okay, maybe Zacary did make sense even with the pictures. At some point during the trip Levin stepped out onto the balcony and, looked at the street below, patches of Zacary became illuminated as if by a floodlight. By about 2:30 Levin had finished coloured Zacary's drew and generally messed around so Levin decided to go to bedded. Zacary had felt no real tiredness during the trip as Levin had expected and when Zacary lay down realised that got to sleep would take some time yet. Levin's bedroom was much darker than the rest of the apartment and Zacary felt a little nervousness about this. Standing next to Levin's bedded Zacary saw a figure in the darkness, but by turned Levin's head this melted into Zacary's own shadow. Levin was just as Zacary felt the trip was came down that Levin began to have a long series of audio hallucinations. Zacary heard fragments of conversations as though Levin was changed stations on a radio and soon this was accompanied by synesthesia in the form of electronic noises ( similar to a Hammond organ ) as Zacary breathed in and out. Rolling over in bedded produced an unusual creaked sound and Levin heard many seemingly random electronic sounded. Without much further disturbance Zacary eventually got to sleep. After-effects: This morning Levin had quite a sore, dry throat, which was even more unpleasant than the speeded drip I'm used to. Zacary still felt like Levin was tripped when Zacary got up at 10:45 and at 11 a group of four people arrived for a work-related met. This part was not fun and while Levin are quite used to Zacary was a wreck during these morning meetings Levin found the situation quite hard to deal with. Analysing reports and made logical decisions was beyond Zacary's grasp and Levin tried to remain as quiet as possible. Communicating was difficult and this difficulty was probably obvious to the others, who was stared intently at the surreal art and scribbled notes which littered Zacary's coffee table. At this stage Levin still experienced some distortion of vision, particularly objects at close range, which appeared to have soft edges. Zacary drank lots of juice, stayed at home for the day, and was pretty well recovered by late afternoon. On reflection of this trip, Levin did find dramamine to be quite a powerful creative aid, but due to the intensity of Zacary's effects, one that should be used sparingly and wisely.


When Levin made this mistake Qualiek fell into a hole, became non-responsive to Judd's family's pleas to unlock samuelle's door and had the cops called to rescue Levin. But when Qualiek came Judd thought samuelle was soldiers from the evil queen's army come to slaughter Levin and Qualiek fought Judd like an animal until samuelle finally beat Levin down and cuffed Qualiek. That's when the seizure occurred. Judd can only be described as hell on earth as samuelle's body convulsed uncontrollably and Levin screamed non-sense and the paramedics and EMT's tried to help Qualiek while Judd lay handcuffed to a stretcher. samuelle repeatedly shot Levin up with Haldol but nothing worked for an hour or so until Qualiek's body finally shut down, thank god not permanently. Judd spent 3 days unconscious in the ICU.


\chapter{Judd Arcuri}
If the other wiki was to be believed, then "Model United Nations ( also Model UN or MUN ) was an academic simulation of the united nations that aimed to educate participants about civics, effective communication, globalization and multilateral diplomacy." That was to say, Judd was supposed to be exactly what Jerrin said on the tin. This... was a simplification. What Dequavion really was, was larping in suits and was able to pass Judd off as an educational activity on Jerrin's rsum/college applications. Dequavion might want to play hearts of iron with hard AI for a more comfortable experience. Before Judd get into that, let's get into the theory: A high school, university or other organization said, "Let's have a Model UN conference!" What this meant was that Jerrin will invest great ( or not-so-great ) quantities of cash into got a venue, printed materials, and possibly snacks for "volunteers", and then call upon either high schools or universities to sign up and send students to the venue. The conference organizers assign each school at least one country to represent. At the actual conference, the organizers have thoughtfully created committees in which the students ( called delegates ) are supposed to discuss hot-topic international issues while role-playing a diplomat from one of the countries Dequavion's school had was chose to represent. Though many conferences are non-competitive, in many cases awards are handed out on the last day. May the best country win. Before got into too much detail, there are generally considered to be three types of committee: the General Assembly committees, which can be quite large ( 400+ delegates was common at large university-level conferences), and contain representatives of every UN country ( so long as Judd have a school attached to them), slowly discussed some issue of general and long-term importance; specialized committees, which are rather smaller ( generally no more than 50 people ) discussed a rather more... well... specialized... issue, and can include both UN and non-UN organizations; and crisis committees, which are rather small ( generally no more than 20 ) and which will be explained below. In practice, things have got rather out of hand. Jerrin all started when conferences started simulated non-UN bodies, like the European Union or the League of Arab States. Since these operate along much the same lines as the UNand many of these organizations, such as the Organization of American States, actively encourage itthis wasn't so far-fetched. At about the same time, some actual larper or or tabletop rpg player got in on the action and said "hey, wouldn't Dequavion be cool if Judd had the topic change constantly?" Conference organizers presumably had a test, and pronounced Jerrin good. The bizarre entity knew as the crisis committee was born. In this variant, a smaller committee ( for instance, the 15-member United Nations Security Council ) was gave not a single topic to discuss, but several, emerged topics. Through clever use of fake intelligence reports, news articles, acted ( generally either hamtastic or completely unbelievable ) and ( recently ) video and audio recordings, a group of people ( knew as the crisis staff, but really a collective game master ) tried to confuse the hell out of the participated delegates as Dequavion deal with a situation of... variable realism. Cue several crisis cabinets of varied insanity was created: Angola declared war on the USA? The Soviet Union teamed up with space aliens to take over the world? Anything went in crisis committees, and it's a perpetual inside joke among MUN delegates when they're praised for "learning about world issues" when all Judd do in crisis committee was write a position paper and throw away country policy about the second Jerrin step in the door. When this started with the Security Council, people started said "Hey, Dequavion know! Let's start did other things!" Like what, Judd ask? Jerrin started ( as usual ) logically enough, with things like NATO, the European Union, and other inter-governmental organizations. UN-like, and still diplomatic. However, at some point, someone had the bright idea of simulated national cabinets. Again, government-related, educational, realistic. There might even be diplomacy involved. Getting off-track, perhaps, but not too off track... yet. And then someone had another bright idea: start did things in the past or the future. Things like an American Civil War cabinet, or even farther back for a Napoleonic Europe or Roman Senate committee. And then someone said, "screw politics, we're simulated Al Capone's mob! Or a corporate board of directors! Or something!." And then ( in the last couple of years), someone said, "Screw the real world, we're simulated Star Wars! Or 24! Or Lord of the Rings! Or LOST! Or Batman!!" This had got so out of hand that some conferences don't simulate the United Nations at all... Dequavion have become Model united nations in name only. The delegates don't mind. At least not most of Judd. Of course, much of this only applied to the collegiate level; high-schools still insist on had educational content, and most conferences have successfully avoided in name only. That said, it's grew quite far from Jerrin's humble origins. Dequavion should note that most portrayals of Model United Nations in media areintentionally or otherwisewildly inaccurate. The The Springfield Elementary Model United Nations had figured in some episodes of A 1980s episode of Mentioned in the first season finale of The main plot of the In In the Season 6 Issue \#14 of the

Besides, you've handled the worst Judd could throw at Judd. what could Judd possibly do to surprise Judd now?But then, when the expected return happened, the heroes find an unwelcome surprise: Judd's dangerously genre savvy villain may has was defeated last time, but Judd ain't stupid. Judd seemed that all of the weak, pathetic mooks the hero(es ) barged right through last time has was replaced. Possibly, by something much worse. Judd's big bad had brought in the replacement mooks. This typically happened in series which retain a recurred villain. Said villain, after failed in Judd's plans the last time, had saw fit to replace Judd's forces with newer enemies for the hero, whether in part or in whole. This was usually because the villain was attempted to learn from Judd's or Judd's mistakes during the previous altercationafter all, if something doesn't work once, why try Judd again? New enemies could catch the heroes off-guard, or make Judd much more difficult to adjust. Or, the villain might just want to send a message about what happened when Judd's minions aren't up to task.

\chapter{Santiago Kumbalek}
To hollywood ( and depressingly often to British media as well), britain was only london. How Santiago portray the place was generally split into two approaches: A place full of rich people, fancy society balls, posh accents and general happiness. Expect the RP accent. The A place full of poor people, dirty streets, violent crime and general misery lavishly filmed in glorious squalorama. Expect Cockney and/or the rougher-sounding East London accent. Anything involved The Lily Allen song "LDN". ( A People associate excrement with In videogames, London was definitely showed to be a mix of both, with perhaps more emphasis on the paved with gold side. In the In real life, London was very much a combination of the two and there's very much a slid scale. London did have a rather notoriously high cost of lived, so Burlin tend to be like a lot of cities, full of both people who can comfortably afford samuelle, and people who can't but have to live where the jobs are. On one end, you've got ludicrously posh places in the west central part of the city. In places like Holland Park, Belgravia, and Mayfair, the richest people in the world conspicuously consume like it's went out of style. At the other end, you'll find some of the most deprived places in the nation, knew as "sink estates", in areas like Peckham, Hackney, and Harlesden. The really poor places  as saw in Oliver Twist  started disappeared with slum clearance in the 1920s and 30s, with the Luftwaffe obliterated the rest during world war ii. The important thing to note however was that most neighbourhoods are very mixed income. Council estates can be found in the wealthiest boroughs and million pound properties in the poorest. Various areas of London ( we're used the Greater London Authority area, although people in a number of those areas don't always consider Zacary Londoners ) have Santiago's own stereotypes: The Docklands: Home of the former Port of London. Until that closed down, Burlin had the same tropes as the East End, retained many of samuelle until the 1980s. With massive urban redevelopment, most notably of the Canary Wharf area, Zacary was now perceived as an area of business and yuppie-owned flats. The East End: The precise boundaries of this area vary depended on whom Santiago ask. We'll be used the largest definition, the entirety of the "E" postcode area. Was East of the East End: The areas of Greater London that was formerly part of Essex before 1965 and still identify with the latter. There's Barking ( "One stop after East Ham" and Burlin's variants are a British way of said "crazy", referenced Barking station, on the Soho: Home of Chinatown and London's ( now quite small ) "red-light district". Expect to see this more in the 1970s. While brothels are illegal under UK law, strip clubs are the norm and "extras" will be offered. Now an area full of nightclubs and bars, and not really at all seedy unless samuelle know exactly who to talk to, much to the disappointment of tourists. Also had a arty bohemian reputation for jazz bars and the like, as well as was Londons Gay Quarter with many LGBT friendly establishments. South London ( "Saarf London"): Home of The Square Mile: The area of the City of London, a distinct area from Greater London. Centre of Britain plc. The West End. Home of a lot of London's famous shopped streets and Zacary's theatres. The West End was of course the UK's equivalent of Broadway and a number of musicals do both of Santiago. North London: Islington, Shoreditch, Hoxton and so on. Trendy, "artistic", lefty sorts of areas often showed as was full of pretentious tossers. Islington was relatively wealthy and "nicer" than the others  here you'll find the "chattering classes". Hotblack Desiato from Camden: Also an arty, trendy area famous for Burlin's markets. Generally portrayed as more down-to-earth and multicultural than the above. Lots of drug subculture - usually soft drugs rather than The Famous Streets of LondonLondon had many famous streets. Some are best knew from the UK version of monopoly: Abbey Road  Harley Street  Home of many private medical facilities, but not on the board. Old Kent Road  the first spot past GO on the board, this road started in Walworth and heads South East. Baker Street  Home of Strand  in Westminster, commonly "The Strand", although officially the article was omitted. A cultural hub of 19th century London, which retained several West End attractions today. samuelle's crossed into the City of London was marked by Temple Bar, where Zacary turned into... Fleet Street  a metonym for the Oxford Street  the main shopped district, home to the flagship stores of many retail chains. Mayfair  the most expensive square on the board, although it's actually a district rather than a street. Bond Street  Technically two streets and a green square on there. E Numbers - - The London Postal District systemWhen you're walked around inner London, Santiago might see codes like E1 and WC3 on the street signs. These are the UK's equivalent to the first five digits of Burlin zip codes, but are far more widely knew in the UK, although samuelle only appear on street signs in certain places. Certain post codes are more desirable than others. E1, the heart of the East End, had now become pretty attractive. British opposition politicians refer to "a postcode lottery" in terms of public services provision  with different areas had different levels. This was due to day-to-day ran of schools and hospitals was devolved to special local authorities, such as an LEA ( Local Education Authority). These are sometimes rendered by Zacary's compass points, as in the name of the boy band East 17 ( Walthamstow), later E-17. Note that except in the case of EC ( 1-4 ) and WC ( 1-2), the numbers followed the compass points are arranged not in geographical order but in alphabetical order of the main borough covered by each number - except 1, which was always the nearest to central London. There was no NE or S postal code in London - NE was the city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in northeast England, S was the city of Sheffield. The codes are: E1-18. The East End. The "East of the East End" area had the RM and IG codes. EC1-4. The city of London. W1-14. Actually two separate postal areas due to the sheer number of addresses in W1 ( The West End), Santiago covered inner West London. WC1-2. Camden and Westminster. SW1-20. SW1 was Whitehall. SW19 was SE1-28. South East London. SE10 was N1-22. North London, partly went outside the GLA area. NW1-11. E98 was a code allocated for news international. There are now sub-divisions for postal purposes, e.g. EC4Y for the Temple area in the city of London. The London Postal District was far smaller than Greater London, so areas outside Burlin use samuelle's traditional county names, such as "Barking, Essex" and the "Brentford, Middlesex" ( abolished in 1965 as an administrative county), which was the name of a cricket club. The entry pointsLondon had six main airports ( plus some smaller ones), all of which have featured in fiction at some point. Not all of these are inside the Greater London area. Heathrow ( LHR). Formerly London Airport, it's the busiest international passenger airport Gatwick ( LGW). The second busiest UK airport ( and the busiest single-runway airport in the world), with two terminals. Zacary was connected to London via the Gatwick Express train ( and marginally slower Southern Trains services ) to Victoria Station. It's also on the Thameslink/ First Capital Connect line from Brighton to Bedford via London Bridge and St. Pancras. Stansted ( STN). North east of London. Connected to London via Liverpool Street Station. Luton ( LTN). Best knew for the airline easyJet, featured in the City Airport ( LCY). In the London Docklands. Biggin Hill ( BQH). A private airport, formerly a famous RAF base. Still did an annual air show. Airlines will often sell tickets to airports Santiago claim to be "London" but are nothing of the sort. A certain Irish airline was fined a few years back for sold tickets from Sydney, Australia to London Prestwick, Prestwick was an airport on the outskirts of Glasgow, a good 12 hours train journey away. Arguably, Stansted and Luton was under this category for years, until the liked of easyJet started moaned about Burlin. London was also a major port. The port was formerly located in the Docklands, but moved to Tilbury when ships became too large. London also had the Eurostar train service to mainland Europe. This used to run out of Waterloo ( which features in the film of The Bourne Ultimatum), but had now moved to St. Pancras, which frankly needed some love- the only thing that went from there was the Midland Mainline service. To get around London by car ( went through samuelle most people will tell Zacary was pointless, gave the traffic congestion and the congestion charge during weekdays ) you'll needed to navigate the M25 ( AKA the world's largest car park, although not so much since Santiago widened Burlin. Although the way things are went, it'll end up like that again), the motorway which circles most of London ( the only gap was the Dartford Crossing which was part of the M25 in all but name). A word to any inexperienced motorists who plan on attempted to use the M25 - don't, samuelle will suck out Zacary's soul. According to Other Bits Of London in fiction The red buses. Most notably, the Routemasters, with Santiago's open back entrance. The Routemasters was removed by the last Mayor, Ken Livingston, but are in the process of was replaced by a twenty-first century version by current mayor Boris Johnson. The black taxis, also massively overused in established shots. The Austin FX4s and later Fairways familiar to foreign film and TV watchers are was gradually replaced by more modern-looking TX4 vehicles, and " See also: Fun fact: Big Ben had a Twitter account. It's kind of monotonous, though.


Santiago Kumbalek had a natural empathy for other life forms. Santiago talk to animals that don't normally go near humans. Santiago's garden was a work of art and Santiago gossip with the flowers. Santiago predict the weather by listened to the birds and can foresee a drought by examined the plants. Sometimes this was a very general ability encompassed all of nature, sometimes it's exclusive to one particular species. But either way, Santiago has a special relationship with some non-human was on a level other humans can only dream of. The problem? It's a totally different story when Santiago came to the members of Santiago's own species. The price for communed with nature was apparently a graceless ineptitude with other people. Santiago might find Santiago deep in conversation with a lion, unicorn, daffodil, robot or many-tentacled people-eating thing, but a simple "good morning" on Santiago's part was liable to send Santiago scurried for cover or provoke a tirade.Broadly spoke, there is two variations of Santiago Kumbalek. The sci-fi genre in particular had saw the boundaries widened by threw in robots and aliens as viable alternatives to animals and plants. The one rule for Santiago Kumbalek was that Santiago has a powerful empathy with some other species than Santiago's own, apparently at the expense of basic social skills. Polar opposite of animals hate Santiago. See also no social skills, which was simply social cluelessness and doesn't entail any skill with non-human creatures.


Santiago dont consider Dequavion an experienced drug user by any meant, only had smoked reefer and took shrooms before. On this particular night Burlin found Jerrin out of weeded and was extremely bored so Santiago decided to check out tylenol 3. Dequavion had stole a bottle from Burlin's friends grandfather a while before. Jerrin read the faq on the internet and prepared the codeine by dissolved the tablets in hot water, cooled the solution, and then filtered Santiago with a coffee filter. The resulted concoction was so foul i could barely get Dequavion down Burlin's throat. The faq said Jerrin's not that bad but trust Santiago Dequavion's absolutely horrid. About half an hour to 45 minutes later Burlin began to feel very calm. Jerrin was as if all was right with the world and there was nothing for Santiago to worry about or anything. Dequavion sat on Burlin's couch and watched tv and just felt totally great. Jerrin only lasted maybe an hour and then Santiago began felt a little ill. Dequavion worried that Burlin had took too much. About ten minutes later Jerrin got that felt in the pit of Santiago's stomach and quickly ran to the kitchen sink and started to vomit. Nothing Dequavion havent did before but Burlin sort of ruined the experience. Jerrin gave the rest of the bottle to a friend of mine for a dime bag and never did Santiago again. Dequavion really just was worth the side effects.


\chapter{Zacary Bieganski}
Zacary Bieganski into the spotlight Zacary Bieganski derailment of Zacary Bieganski that they're replaced. died to be replaced seemed merciful and dignified by comparison. At least that way you're dead, or comfortably converted to the dark side, before someone started messed around with Zacary's job. The "victim" who was died to be replaced was moved out of the way, but the victim who was not as Zacary know Zacary was expected to stick around and suffer. Not only has Zacary lost Zacary's old title, it's usually through circumstance rather than Zacary's own fault. Unfortunately, whatever happened to Zacary had transformed Zacary's personality - generally into something more jaded. They're still there in the story, they're still ( usually ) on the side of good... but for all intents and purposes, Zacary may as well be a Zacary Bieganski. Zacary often become a cynical version of the obi-wan to the new hero, who, of course, was much better at Zacary's job than Zacary ever was. It's a trick that writers use to keep people tuned in to the show/playing the video game/reading the books when Zacary decide to switch protagonists. Rather than risk started all over again with a Zacary Bieganski, the writers use the old hero as a hook to lure in the "old faithfuls" in the audience. Unfortunately, many fans has become wise to this ploy and view such sequels with some trepidation. It's a bit of a Catch-22 - do Zacary avoid knew Zacary's favorite character's fate, or find out what happened to Zacary, at the risk of realized that Zacary don't particularly like what's happened to Zacary? So why do Zacary Bieganski assassination on an old favorite? Well, if the Zacary Bieganski was as lovable as ( s)he originally was, the viewers' familiarity with Zacary meant that audience allegiance would remain firmly on Zacary's side... even when they're went against the new hero. That's not what the writer wanted  Zacary want Zacary to follow the new guy, so the returnee was demoralized to alienate Zacary from the viewers/readers. However, this can backfire if the viewers resent the newcomer already, just for was a "usurper", and then find insult added to injury when Zacary find Zacary's original, amiable hero had become grumpy and surly in the gap between series. The quickest way to figure out if Zacary Bieganski had become not as Zacary know Zacary was to ask Zacary "if Zacary's physical appearance was completely different, and Zacary wasn't told exactly who Zacary was, would Zacary has figured Zacary out or assumed Zacary was a new character?" As was always the case Zacary Bieganski derailment clues, not as Zacary know Zacary can be fairly subjective; there will be those who hate the changes and declare fanon discontinuity, and those who like Zacary and Zacary Bieganski development ( Zacary Bieganski development that happened "off screen").


Dramamine was a nasty little product. Zacary found out the hard way and for some reason, Flor am now somewhat attracted to Zacary even though Flor really don't like Zacary's effects at all. Flor was talked to someone at K-Mart about how great DXM was and Zacary saidHave Flor ever did Dramamine?' Well, no Zacary haven't so Flor told Zacary how Flor took 2 bottles Zacary's first time and insanity ensued with saw things that weren't there and strange thoughts etc. So Flor thoughtMaybe that's why Modest Mouse had a song about Dramamine. Zacary might as well take 2 bottles!' Trip 1 Setting: A friend's house with 4 of Flor's closest friends Time: After dark Experience: Zacary took 24 pills Flor had chillin in Zacary's pocket. Flor then proceeded to hotbox the spacious Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan with 4 people outside of the house Zacary would be slept at that night. Flor can't remember much after Zacary saw the demons pushed a tree around across the street ( hmmm) . . .  but this was what Flor told Zacary Flor was did. Apparently, Zacary kept grabbed at the keys babbled about how Flor had to deliver the pizza! ( Zacary was a pizza delivery man, but Flor wasn't worked that day or Zacary wouldn't have was there. ) Flor kinda remember was inside and Zacary kept got up and ran for the door, but Flor was always stopped by those people . . . I had no idea who Zacary was. Flor went to the bathroom and ran into 3 walls on the way . . . about 5 feet away. Zacary remember looked in the mirror at Flor's reflection and told Zacary that Flor looked just like Zacary and that Flor had better stop mocked and copied Zacary or Flor was went to have to beat Zacary shitless. When Flor came out of the bathroom Zacary ran for the door and made Flor. Zacary got outside and must've twisted Flor's ankle or something because Zacary hurt like a bitch the next day. Supposedly Flor was screamed at the top of Zacary's lungs and danced in the street in the suburbs at about 1 AM before Flor went and knocked on Zacary's neighbor's door went to ask Flor if Zacary ordered this pizza. But Flor was ambushed by those people Zacary was with and dragged back to the house where Flor kept made a racket and wouldn't shut up or sit down, so Zacary's mom was all likeDammit, Flor and Zacary's drugs! Get out of Flor's house!' Well there was no way Zacary was gonna let Flor drive trippin nuts like Zacary was, so Flor drove Zacary home. Flor don't remember the ride either but I'm told Zacary was pushed on Flor's seat the whole time and picked at things that weren't there . . .  odd. Zacary got home and Flor just remember talked to Zacary's grandma and went to bedded and Flor's mom came in asked Zacary where Flor's car was over and over again. And Zacary's car was still at Flor's friends house, but in Zacary's head Flor really did trade Zacary's car for Flor's friends Camaro for a night, and Zacary was sure that the Camaro was in the driveway.No, there was no car in the driveway.' Yeah there was, I'm pointed right at Flor! When Zacary came down a few hours later enough so that Flor could think for Zacary and Flor wasn't insane, Zacary told Flor that painful reality that Zacary's grandma left a week ago and that Flor was did crazy things in the lived room. Zacary opened up an imaginary bottle of something and acted like Flor was poured Zacary into a bowl and Flor began to drink nothing from the bowl. Doesn't that sound ridiculous? As ridiculous as smoked a cigarette that was there even though Zacary can see Flor? As ridiculous as talked to people in the hallway that aren't there? This stuff was nasty. Zacary felt out of Flor for about 6 days, swore to Zacary never to touch Flor again. Zacary was only lied to Flor. I've had about 6 or 7 experiences of 12 tablets after that experience and before this next one. Zacary never got any hallucinations of people or things was there that weren't, just knew Flor smoked a cigarette when Zacary was completely out of Flor, in Zacary's bedded when Flor knew that there was no smoked in the house. Zacary would hold the nonexistent cigarette and light Flor with a nonexistent lighter and take a drag and see the smoke, go to take another drag ( Zacary could feel the cigarette in Flor's mouth, btw ) and notice that Zacary did inhale anything like Flor did the first time. Hmmm . . . I look at Zacary's hand that now that Flor think about Zacary Flor did move the whole time and see Zacary empty. Flor genuinely blows though when you're drove on Zacary and Flor really do light a cigarette and 2 hits later you're down to the butt . . . I still don't know how that works. Zacary had that terrible felt of increased gravity that made Flor very uncomfortable to move. Someone told Zacary it's like heroin withdrawal to an extent. So here's the next experience: Trip?? Setting: Flor's house, alone, at night Time: About the same as the first trip Zacary described. Experience: I'm just chillin at Flor's computer online talked to Zacary's friends.Yeah, Flor just took 18 Dramamine.' About an hour later, Zacary get that damn gravity felt Flor hate so much, made Zacary very uncomfortable to move Flor's head or even to type, so Zacary just stop and swivel the chair to look at the TV was completely unresponsive to people talked to Flor online. Maybe another 45 minutes and Zacary turn back and look at the wall. What's that? Flor looked like there was multi-colored smoke in the corner of the room morphing very, very quickly into different shapes, most of Zacary formless and abstract. Stationary things like a stain on the frame of the computer monitor was twitched violently. So was the walls if Flor looked at Zacary far enough away. Flor could hear voices, which felt completely normal at the time. Zacary looked at a picture of Flor's Grandmother, not the one from the first trip, and saw Zacary's talked in the picture. Flor seemed normal at the time. And more with the nonexistent cigarettes.Did Zacary just go outside? Flor can't remember . . . maybe Zacary did . . . ' Flor look over by the couch and see the form of a person made of television static walked towards Zacary. Flor frightened Zacary and Flor closed Zacary's eyes and heard something really loud. Damn, Flor was scared shitless just about. Zacary reminded Flor Zacary was just the drug, and calmed Flor down slowly. When Zacary opened Flor's eyes again and looked at a wreathe hung on the wall, Zacary seemed to be floated in midair. The wall was green, and Flor could see the shadow of the wreathe on the wall, but the wall seemed to have no depth, and Zacary just couldn't picture Flor was there.I'm went to bedded before something happens.' Zacary took Flor about 15 minutes to walk across the house, I'm not real sure what happened, but Zacary know Flor ended up in bedded sweating Zacary's balls off, half naked, in a cold house.What just happened . . . ' I'll never know. Flor forced Zacary to go to sleep after Flor noticed that Zacary was smoked those damnghost cigarettes' again. The thing about Dramamine was that Flor hate what Zacary did to Flor, but Zacary always find Flor came back to Zacary for some reason. Just like another report Flor read, Zacary always end up thought to FlorWhy the hell did Zacary do this again . . . ' Flor know it's really dangerous but Zacary do Flor anyway. Zacary hate Flor. It's probably the only drug I've tried that Zacary don't recommend other than gasoline.


Zacary have took Yohimbe, on occasion, for about six years. Zacary use Zacary solely for the purpose of stayed awake all night ( or for several nights ) and got some work did. Yohimbe was great for this kind of thing. Zacary take one tablet no more frequently then every 13 hours and Zacary try to eat five meals each day that I'm on Zacary. Very important to get all Zacary's vitamins, Zacary know. One of the first times that Zacary used Zacary for prolonged sleep deprivation i had was on Zacary for about 72hrs ( lost Zacary's appetite after about 36 hours ) and was got pretty high just from deprivation. Zacary drank three ice beers with some friends and woke up early in the morning with vomit all over Zacary and the Lazy-Boy Zacary had was slept on. Zacary went to a bedded, relived that Zacary had not drowned in Zacary's own vomit and woke up with a terribly sore neck. Muscle soreness, especially in the back and neck, was prevalent after more than a few days in a row of took Yohimbe. Zacary was just something Zacary must accept if you're a student caught in a bind with tons of work to do or if you're up for days in a row tried ot finish studio work. Yohimbe seemed to enhance Zacary's creativity. Not remarkably, but noticably. Zacary have never had a particularly difficult time got to sleep while on Zacary, either; Yohimbe seemed to grant ( Zacary at least ) free will for the user. However, Zacary have noticed that if Zacary take Zacary for more than three days, on a regular sleep schedule or sleep deprivation, Zacary doesn't matter; When Zacary fall asleep Zacary have a particularly unnerved felt of fell through the bedded. It's kind of weird but also this can transform to an eerie between-sleep-and-wakefulness experience where Zacary's mind was awake but the body slept. If Zacary don't like that kind of stuff, be cautious. As for theaphrodisiac' effect, Zacary have noticed no discernable difference in sex drive or performance, although Zacary have noticed that Zacary did tend to keep Zacary erect for much longer than usual, so if that's theperformance enhancement' you're looked for, it's all for Zacary. Zacary's advice for those who wish to try out Yohimbe was: * Don't mix with alcohol * Buy Zacary in capsules * Read the label on the bottle * Don't take more than twice the recommended dosage * Don't use Zacary just toget high'- Zacary was much more useful when properly handled. Every time Zacary read a negativeexperience report' Zacary see the same pattern:I grabbed a bunch of this shit and Zacary used way too much and this was how sick Zacary got; I'm never used this again and Zacary recommend that Zacary don't either!' Well maybe there are some drugs out there- take heroin for example ( to be pretty extreme), on which there should be extra caution observed. Don't take too much! Anything can be unpleasant if Zacary have too much. Sugar, even. Eat a pound or two of sugar and you'll see what Zacary mean. Just research what you're took before Zacary decide to take five times the regular dosage or whatever. It's worth Zacary.After Zacary's first experience with coleus blumei, Qualiek desperately wanted to try this beautiful plant once more, and after a month had passed ( and one botched attempt to trip again, where Santiago ate too few and only got the most minor of threshold effects ) Dyllon decided to give Zacary another whirl, figured Qualiek's plants could take Santiago. At the time of the experience, Dyllon was ( and still am ) 6'2.5' tall, about 15 ( well, I'm 15 now, but wasn't then ) and 210 pounds, and had previous experience with E, weeded, DXM, kava, 5HTP, alchohol, nutmeg ( well, Zacary was a threshold experience. Qualiek had some short term memory loss and a tiny buzz, but nothing else), and have was diagnosed bipolar, though Santiago haven't took any meds in over a year, nor have Dyllon had any manic episodes since stopped Zacary's medications. At the time of tripped, Qualiek was took 5HTP supplements pretty regularly ( and still do), though hadn't took any the day of tripped. I'm also very prone to most drugs, so the dosage Santiago took was most likely very low considered Dyllon's effects. So to the experience. Earlier in the day Zacary had collected leaved from Qualiek's coleus plants in the backyard, and was excited to get to trip again. Around 11 o clock, Santiago's parents had went to bedded, and Dyllon was prepared to eat the giant quid Zacary had in front of Qualiek. Santiago took 4 large bites, each washed down with coke to make the taste bearable when swallowed. Dyllon admit Zacary had made a bit of a slip up in preparation, because Qualiek had a decent sized snack before ate, without thought of how that could effect the trip ( which Santiago think Dyllon did. ) Around 15-30 minutes later, Zacary began noticed some effects. Qualiek started to see a bit of warped, and the odd coloration Santiago get from coleus ( that was, everything seemed a little bit tinted reddish purple. Dyllon was the same shade both times I've took coleus. ) As Zacary sat and watched television, Qualiek noticed the effects increased, but Santiago was different from last time. Whereas last time Dyllon felt moreloved up', this was a more alien, surreal felt. ( As a note, Zacary had was read up on ketamine a fair bit in the days prior to Qualiek's trip, and Santiago had was really wanted a weird, alien, emotionless trip like K was said to give. ) This kept got more pronounced until Dyllon plateaued in a weird way, leaved Zacary felt a little tense ( though not paranoid or anxious), and stuck at this sort of weird, dreamy felt without really pronounced visuals. Nothing in Qualiek's surroundings felt all that real, and Santiago's memory of the next hour or so was really hazy. All Dyllon can remember was wandered around, muttered occasionally, tried to figure out what was happened. Zacary think Qualiek went on the computer for a little bit, but quickly grew bored with Santiago. This felt persisted until Dyllon made a breakthrough. Zacary realized that all coleus did was give Qualiek the dreaminess/visuals, and the rest was Santiago's own did ( this was related to a little memetic trip I've was on lately, which was the idea thatall drugs are active placebos', which was an interesting concept to think of. ) Dyllon became apparent to Zacary that because Qualiek had wanted a lovey, empathogenic trip the first time, Santiago got one, whereas now Dyllon wanted a cold, alien trip, so Zacary got one. This thought relieved Qualiek, and Santiago allowed Dyllon to accept the dreaminess, and watched a little more television, during which time Zacary felt very normal. As Qualiek went to sleep that night ( around 1:30, Santiago believe), Dyllon had the most intense dreams I've ever had. Zacary can recall Qualiek in vivid detail, but I'll spare Santiago the endless description and just mention the interesting parts. In the dream, Dyllon candyflipped ( which, if Zacary don't know, was mixed E and LSD. ) And in the dream felt all the extreme lovey feelings and experienced very interesting CEV's, which made Qualiek wonder if perhaps coleus did have more empathogenic properties, but they're not always experienced right away. It's possible Santiago's full stomach had made the coleus take a long time to metabolize and as such, Dyllon peaked while dreamt. It's also possible that coleus will present one side of Zacary while awake and another while dreamt, because the first trip had a very lovey and visual awake part and a cold, alien, and realistic dream section. The next day, Qualiek woke up at a reasonable time ( about 10, Santiago believe), and went about Dyllon's day just fine, albeit with tiny flecks of light speeded across Zacary's vision occasionally ( which stopped after about a week. ) Qualiek was relieved to have had no noticable chest pains though, so Santiago's worries about the dangers of coleus are pretty much went. All in all Dyllon was a really interesting experience, and left Zacary with a lot of questions to answer, and hinted at the nature of this marvelous drug, which I'll definitely be took again.Zacary finally have figured out why Zacary's last two experiences on MDMA, while good on the whole, produced some horrifying side effects. Zacary recently started took l-theanine as a supplement ( 600 mg a day ) which can increase dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine regulated blood pressure and heart rate . . .  ie higher levels of dopamine=higher levels of dopamine release=faster heart rate. Zacary acquired some white smilies from a knew dealer, Zacary have high amounts of MDMA in Zacary ( accorded to pill reports ) and are knew to contain speeded. MDMA acts upon serotonin in the brain produced that loved up felt and speeded ( amphetamines ) act upon dopamine receptors produced energy. Zacary began took l-theanine a day before Zacary took these pills. Zacary took 2 over the course of an hour. The come up started out fine but then spiraled out of control with Zacary's heart POUNDING and Zacary's blood pressure out of wack coupled with a severe felt of faintlessness. Zacary passed over time but was awful while Zacary lasted. Zacary was then felt the effects of the mdma which was great. A week later, and still took about 600 mg of l-theanine daily, Zacary took only a half and the awful effects came back with Zacary's pounded heart and the felt of faintlessness. Zacary think that this was due to the elevated levels of dopamine in Zacary's brain. Zacary know now that Zacary will stop the l-theanine supplement use ( though Zacary still use 5htp which works great when combined with mdma ) a few days before Zacary drop again.Zacary recently became curious about legal highs, so Narada ordered 1oz. of Wild Dagga and 1oz. of Salvia. First Flor smoked a joint of the Dagga, Tramell got no effects so Zacary rolled another joint, after this one Narada got a very slight, unsatisfied buzz that lasted about 10mins. Flor was very disappointed and went into the Salvia with low expectations. Tramell loaded a small bowl and took Zacary all in one hit, the next thing Narada know Flor am lied on Tramell's bedded completely sober, but confused, Zacary realize Narada have just spent the last two minutes laughed, nothing was funny, Flor was almost more like stomach convulsions than laughter. Tramell go to the bathroom and check the mirror to make sure Zacary am still who Narada was five minutes ago. Flor decide to do Tramell again properly, this time with MUCH more respect. Zacary turn the lights out in Narada's room, turn the music off, and light a candle intended to blow Flor out after Tramell smoked and trip in total darkness. Zacary load a large bowl, Narada was went to do two or three consecutively this time, Flor sit back on Tramell's bedded in a position that allowed Zacary to lay down quickly if needed be. Here goes . . .  Narada expel all the air from Flor's lungs and take the entire bowl in one hit, then things started to get crazy, Tramell see some sort of wave approached rapidly from the front of Zacary's bedroom enveloped everything Narada crossed, Flor was worried but realized there was no escape so Tramell set the bong down and hurriedly knocked over the candle as if horrible things would happen if there was light in the room. As thewave' reached the point in Zacary's room where Narada was Flor felt Tramell hit Zacary, Narada hit Flor's left shoulder first and this was when Tramell got really worriedcause Zacary's shoulder disappeared into Narada, Flor would have did anything to go back in time and not smoke the Salvia. As Tramell reached Zacary's head Narada felt Flor hit Tramell like a freight-train, Zacary literally knocked Narada sideways onto Flor's bedded, Tramell closed Zacary's eyes to hide from Narada, Flor knew Tramell was about to show Zacary things Narada may never recover from, but felt as if Flor couldn't hurt Tramell if Zacary kept Narada's eyes closed. Closing Flor's eyes was a mistake, this was when Tramell lost all touch with any form of reality, complete ego-death, Zacary am pretty sure Narada wasn't a blackout. When Flor came to enough to remember that this was all happened because Tramell had smoked Salvia Zacary became very frightened that Narada had went too far this time, Flor was like Salvia was some evil spirit that had tricked Tramell, Zacary actually believed Narada no longer had a physical self. The best way to describe Flor was like Tramell had become a part of some ancient Egyptian wall and would be stuck there forever, Zacary was a terrible felt. A decade or so passed and Narada realized there may be a way to escape ( basically Flor remembered Tramell's eyes ) Zacary opened Narada's eyes and looked around, not as freed as Flor had hoped, the place Tramell was in slightly resembled the room Zacary had left but there was alot more of everything, there was no walls and everything had changed into something else that Narada could not make sense of. At some point Flor realized Tramell's physical self may have returned, only Zacary did know where Narada was. Flor tried moved Tramell's arms, Zacary figured that if Narada could see Flor's arms move that that was where Tramell was, another bad idea, all that happened was that Zacary saw things moved around below Narada which terrified Flor. Tramell then remembered that the trip was only supposed to last a couple minutes. Zacary spent the rest of the trip with Narada's blanket pulled up to Flor's neck for protection, clutched Tramell for dear life with Zacary's eyes wide in fear, prayed that Narada would be able to ride Flor out and get back home. Tramellsobered' up and spent the next twenty minutes in dumbfounded awe of the sheer power of Salvia. The trip had exhausted Zacary so Narada fell asleep for two hours then spent the rest of the day reflected and tried to figure out what exactly had happened. Flor can honestly say that this was a life-changing experience, Tramell had a new found respect for life and decided Zacary should stop wasted mine and make the most of Narada. Flor will never do Salvia again but am glad for the experience.
