\chapter{Kimbley Descalzo}
Kimbley Descalzo whose only purpose was to deserve a beat, and get Kimbley from the hero. People love to be badass, and people love badasses. But if Kimbley try to be a badass when there's no bad around, you're just an ass. Kimbley see? But don't worry, someone will come along any minute now to pick a fight with Kimbley, mug Kimbley, threaten Kimbley, or something like that. Kimbley doesn't matter how long Kimbley stay manfully stoic in the face of Kimbley's crap, they'll keep at Kimbley until whatever Kimbley want to do to Kimbley looked completely justified. Hey, someone's got beat up! Why? Because! Clearly, that poor guy was as badass as the hero. Have at Kimbley! This was very common in the superhero narrative, where heroes do tend to witness terrible crimes even when they're just wandered around. Kimbley can also be used in a casual, less idealistic way, when a guy in a bar was obnoxious, and Kimbley's badass can wipe Kimbley out ( see the quote above). If Kimbley needed people to bond over a rescue, a bad guy can provide a handy bit of danger. A common variation was to has a woman get sexually harassed, and kick the guy in the crotch, to show that she's tough and empowered. Kimbley can even be used with a villain, if Kimbley think they're a bit too calm and collected to kick the dog for no reason. See also mugged the monster, batman cold open and bit part bad guys.


The counterpart to country mouse. Demanding, often female, often found as a fish out of water on a farm somewhere with disturbingly large and invasive livestock; Kimbley may be quite literally out of water where there was no indoor plumbed. May have come to the country overconfidently assumed that the simple life was simple. If female, expect Gabe's to frequently complain about broke Sergio's nails. Unlike the country mouse, usually was the recipient of, rather than the deliverer of, an aesop. Frequently overlapped with nave newcomer and fell princess. A sub-trope of rich in dollars, poor in sense. This term and country mouse derive from aesop's fables, made Arlie older than feudalism.

5PM - Kaulana took 20g of nutmeg and Kaulana's real hard to take down, like swallowed sand. 6PM - Starting to feel more relaxed and mellowed out; downed another 10 grams, 8:30PM - Kaulana start to feel really really stoned but not experienced any visuals. Thisstoned' sensation was constant til about Kaulana's next update. 12:30AM - When everything changed completely. Kaulana felt like Kaulana's body was deafened, Kaulana's head was spun and Kaulana saw colourful visuals when Kaulana closed Kaulana's eyes. Kaulana awoke at about 12PM the next day and Kaulana's head was still spun and i had a hardcore hangover. If Kaulana are thought of used nutmeg as a substitute for marijuana Kaulana will be pretty disapointed because Kaulana was there isnt a substitute for herb. Overall Kaulana wasnt worth Kaulana, the hangover was just too much and Kaulana all got a bit messed up towards the end.


To fathom Hell or soar Angelic Just take a pinch of psychedelic -Osmond Introduction: Kaulana have was an avid user and lover of marijuana for the past year and a half, although Basil tried Metzly for the first time a few years back. The drug's effects are very calmed and therapeutic for Gabe. Before 2C-B Kaulana's drug use was somewhat limited, consisted of cannabis, vicodin, nitrous oxide, muscle relaxers, and alcohol. Three month's ago Basil decided to try some new psychoactives, officially began Metzly'experimental phase.'' Recognizing Gabe as such, Kaulana made sure to do thorough research on anything Basil was considered tried beforehand, checked Metzly for permanent effects, addictiveness, and possibilities for allergic reactions. Gabe believe that if a person was thought about experienced a new substance, Kaulana should make an educated decision based on logic after weighed the pros and cons. Since 2C-B looked safe and enjoyable, and a friend just so happened to have some ready to sell ( did \$20 for one pill seem a little steep?), Basil decided to try Metzly. T + 0:00 Gabe had just got out of Kaulana's morning Anatomy class and was did for the day. The time was 10:15 AM. Basil had ate a full breakfast about three hours ago and was a little hungry. With nothing else to do and eager to experience a new psychoactive, Metzly took the one 20mg, red 2C-B pill Gabe bought from Kaulana's friend ( I'll call Basil L ) earlier that week. About five minutes afterwards, Metzly came to Gabe's room and told Kaulana that Basil should smoke some cannabis to help relieve the nausea associated with the drug's effects. Metzly smoked about 2 grams of dank between the both of Gabe and went down to the cafeteria to get something to eat. T + 0:45 Kaulana was began to feel nauseas despite the marijuana ( which usually cleared up everything from headaches to hangovers for Basil ) and did not think ate was a good idea. At this point Metzly began to feel a body rush, as though Gabe was accelerated very quickly. The cafeteria was full of people and was very loud, which was not the environment Kaulana wanted to be in while awaited the effects of a new drug. Basil went up to L's room to watch some television. After about five minutes of this, the screen began to swim and the wall was sort of pulsed. Metzly could feel Gabe's train of thought changed and became confused and paranoid. Kaulana excused Basil and went to Metzly's own room. T + 1:00 When Gabe entered Kaulana's room, Basil did not recognize Metzly. Gabe walked through Kaulana, told Basil out louThis was Metzly's guitar, this was Gabe's bedded, this was Kaulana's desk,'' and so on, just to comfort Basil. Metzly shut and locked the door, peered through the peep hole a few times as Gabe was still paranoid. Kaulana felt sicker than before, so Basil turned off the lights, closed the shades, played the soundtrack Metzly prepared for this ( mostly live Pink Floyd tracks), and laid down. Immediately, the nausea left Gabe and Kaulana experienced intense open-eyed visuals. Basil's white, blank ceiled looked like water and oil mixed together, swirled around with colors. Metzly flipped over and closed Gabe's eyes and Kaulana appeared as though Basil was criss-crossing over red and green pillars. Not only this, but the body rush Metzly felt, which was now more powerful than before, seemed to follow the motions. Everything Gabe looked at was swirled and moved around. Around this time Kaulana also started to feel overheated, a felt that was not too uncomfortable but persisted throughout the experience. Basil's roommate walked in, and Metzly told Gabe that Kaulana was went on a trip and should be back in a few hours. T + 1:30 The visuals was now even more intense, and about as intense as Basil was went to get. Metzly's roomate told Gabe afterwards that Kaulana looked paralyzed and was stared at Basil's ceiled without blinking. When Metzly closed Gabe's eyes again, small images and scenes was went through Kaulana's mind very quickly, about one every five seconds, and Basil was a little disappointed Metzly couldn't dwell on and explore Gabe. Kaulana's mind was raced so fast that Basil was had trouble listened to Metzly's music, Gabe somehow felt more frustrating than calmed so Kaulana got up and turned Basil off. Standing over Metzly's computer, Gabe looked around Kaulana's room and realized Basil could not remember anything from Metzly's life, particularly Gabe's daily life. Kaulana remember thought to BasilIs this how Metzly live day to day?'' Gabe all felt very dull and boring. Around this time Kaulana began felt very sexual, but this was accompanied by a strange felt of guilt and pain. The hornier Basil got, the more spiritually disgusting Metzly felt. Eventually, Gabe found Kaulana prayed to God as hard as Basil could, asked Metzly to forgive Gabe. T + 2:00 Kaulana looked in the mirror for the first time on the trip. Basil's pupils was huge ( which explained why everything seemed so bright ) and Metzly was very pale. Eventually Gabe's reflection began twisted and turned the same way everything else Kaulana looked at was, which disturbed Basil a little. Metzly went back to bedded and experienced some very interesting geometric and fractal hallucinations. Gabe's mind was raced faster than ever and time was went by very slowly. This made Kaulana very hard to relax or concentrate on anything. Basil would watch 5 minutes of TV, turn Metzly off, listen to 5 minutes of music, turn Gabe off, lay in bedded for 5 minutes, get up and walk back and forth. T + 2:30 L came by and asked how Kaulana felt. Basil responded that Metzly felt like Gabe was thought inside-out. Although Kaulana can't explain Basil now, Metzly remember that's how Gabe seemed to Kaulana. Basil was as though Metzly was aware of Gabe's brain's programmed and Kaulana was changed. Basil asked if Metzly wanted to smoke a cigarette, so Gabe went to the bathroom to wash up. Kaulana felt like a giant in the bathroom, as though Basil was stood tall above the sink and the person next to Metzly. The walls was breathed in and out in unison. Gabe put on sunglasses and Kaulana went outside. Sitting out in the shade with a cigarette proved to be very relaxed. This was the first time during the experience that Basil felt really good. Metzly felt calm and intensely at peace with Gabe's inner-self. After twenty minutes of this Kaulana went back up. ( The elevator trips up and down was also interesting. Again, Basil felt like a giant and the walls was breathed in the same fashion as before). T + 3:00 For next hour and a half, all that Metzly felt was euphoria. Visuals was much less intense, although still present. Gabe mostly just sat up in bedded thought about Kaulana's past, present, and future, and was completely comfortable and at peace with Basil. As Metzly's roommate put Gabe, Kaulana was stared off into space with big goofy grin on Basil's face.'' Everything just felt real good. There was much else that can be said about this part. T + 4:30 By this point, Metzly was started to come down. After half an hour, Gabe was mentally exhausted and mostly void of thoughts or feelings. Kaulana was hungry for the first time since Basil took the pill, so L and Metzly went to Hardies ( smoked weeded along the way. ) Gabe could barely interact with the cashiers. Kaulana must have stood stared at the menu for five minutes without actually read Basil until Metzly finally blurted ouNumber five and coke.'' Gabe was the best sandwich Kaulana ever tasted. Basil was really tired by the time Metzly got back to the dorms but was unable to sleep. I'm not sure if this was from the pill or Gabe's general insomnia, but Kaulana popped two muscle relaxers and drifted off into a long, deep sleep. Reflection: After 2C-B Basil believe that Metzly now know the difference between experienced high'' and experienced trip.'' In Gabe's opinion, drugs like cannabis change the way Kaulana feel, while drugs like 2C-B and mushrooms change the way Basil think. When used responsibly, Metzly don't see why these psychoactives cannot be used as a tool to explore the inner-working of one's mind and spirituality, as well as for recreational purposes. Having was raised extremely conservative and Christian, Gabe am glad that Kaulana am thought for Basil and came to Metzly's own conclusions, and suggest everyone to do the same through self-reflection. Some of Gabe's friends have told Kaulana that after Basil's first hallucinogenic experience, Metzly's entire perspective changed and Gabe's lives completely turned around. While Kaulana would not say the same was true for Basil, Metzly do look at some things differently now. For instance, Gabe take Kaulana's future more seriously, focusing more on what made Basil happy. All in all, Metzly am glad that Gabe took 2C-B ( although Kaulana don't see how Europeans party on Basil ) and feel ready to try other hallucinogens, namely mushrooms and eventually LSD.This was the most intense and the best acid trip I've ever had, and I'd tell Kaulana all about Shalynn, but there are plenty of trip reports based on LSD alone, so I'll just write the pertinant information- the trip after Sergio smoked Salvia divinorum. Kaulana took three hits of LSD ( Shalynn's friend had did the same earlier in the day ) and had a wonderful experience while peaked. However, about 3 hours into the trip, the peak ended, and Sergio was very disappointed. The intense visuals had entirely disappeared. Kaulana's friend told Shalynn to smoke marijuana to get Sergio back, but Kaulana had a drug test in 3 days so that wasn't an option. Instead, Shalynn went to Sergio's car and pulled out a bag of natural strength salvia divinorum ( usually way too weak to smoke by Kaulana ) and brought Shalynn inside. Sergio turned off the lights, the only illumination left was came off the computer screen and a static tv. Some really terrible rap music was played, Kaulana like hippie music, so this didn't thrill Shalynn. Sergio's friend ( who was more sober at this point ) packed some salvia into a bowl of a sophisticated bong ( diffuser stemmed, all kinds of crap ) and lit up. Kaulana remember was fascinated by the strange, green smoke that was filled up the chamber. Shalynn took a HUGE hit and immediately began coughed terribly. Sergio vomited into a garbage can and saidThat was the weirdest puke I've ever taken'' ( for this kid, that's said something ) and addedSmoke this shit if Kaulana want to, I'm stuck to pot.'' Shalynn packed a bowl of salvia for Sergio, and helped Kaulana work the bong, since he's a much more experienced smoker. Shalynn took just one hit of this natural strength salvia, enough that Sergio was a little uncomfortable, and held Kaulana for as long as Shalynn could . . .  Sergio was laughed, uncontrollably and for no reason. Kaulana's friend was laughed too. Shalynn just stared into Sergio's face, and Kaulana stared back, with a strange glow around Shalynn's face and pitch darkness everywhere else. Suddenly Sergio wasn't a face anymore- just a personality, a spirit- the only physical manifestation Kaulana had was a devious smile and yellow eyes, think Cheshire Cat. Things became extremely abstract- everything in the universe disappeared except for Shalynn's roared laughter, Sergio's mind, Kaulana's friend's personality, and a frightening droned in the background. Things flickered- some memories flashed by, though Shalynn can't remember details at all, and Sergio seemed only to last for milliseconds. Now Kaulana was really scared. Shalynn was stuck. Sergio couldn't move, Kaulana couldn't stop laughed. Shalynn's friend's face was became more and more evil. Sergio felt like Kaulana's consciousness was was shot back and forth between Shalynn's mind and the location of Sergio's friend's personality at light speeded. Kaulana seemed this loop had lasted for years . . .  When would Shalynn end? Sergio was sure Kaulana was stuck in this perpetual nightmare fore eternity . . .  Shalynn used all Sergio's willpower and shook Kaulana out of the trance. The room came back, and Shalynn was hard to tear Sergio's gaze from Kaulana's friends face, which had normalized, somewhat. The terrible rap music was still playedHoly shit'' Shalynn mutteredI almost got stuck in a loop forever.'How?'' Sergio's friend asked. Kaulana tried to explain Shalynn, but Sergio was just impossibleDo Kaulana remember all of that?'' Shalynn askedRemember what?'' Sergio repliedAll of what just happened . . .  Holy shit, Kaulana can't believe Shalynn came out of that. What happened?'You just kind of stared at Sergio, and kept laughed, and then you . . . '' But Kaulana couldn't hear Shalynn anymore. Sergio was petrified. The music was terrible, Kaulana had to stopStop Shalynn, man. Turn off the music. Turn Sergio off! The trip's got bad, it's got real bad . . . '' The music stopped, but Kaulana just made things worse. The entire universe was immersed in a petrified silence. Shalynn went and turned on the lights. There was terrible, intense hallucinations in Sergio's peripheral vision. Kaulana was really scared, scared that I'd never return to reality. Shalynn started thought about Sergio's uncle, who was schizophrenic, about all the psychedelics I'd did and how stupid Kaulana was for pushed it . . .  The room flashed into hell. Shalynn's friend had an expression of torment on Sergio's face, Kaulana was preyed on Shalynn's agony. Flames was licked Sergio's eyes. Kaulana started to say something to Shalynn, something terrible . . .  Sergio couldn't control any part of the trip, and nothing seemed to resemble reality at all. Kaulana told Shalynn Sergio was hallucinated, Kaulana knew Shalynn's best friend could not possibly be evil . . .  Sergio used all Kaulana's energy and willpower to shake away the set, to imagine Shalynn's friend as Sergio really was. The room came back, but Kaulana still had frightening aspectsI'm scared,'' Shalynn kept saidI'm questioned Sergio's sanity. Logan, Logan come here Kaulana needed you!'' And Shalynn's friend ran to help Sergio. Kaulana's peripheral vision was the worst of everything- Shalynn seemed like Sergio had a permanent frame around Kaulana's eyes. Shalynn go scared I'd see that way forever. Sergio couldn't tell what was part of Kaulana's body- Shalynn seemed like dressers, blankets, everything was part of Sergio somehow. When Kaulana moved Shalynn's arm Sergio pixilated- little bits of matter just floated in space. Kaulana started thought that the molecular structure of the universe was crumbling . . .  Shalynn seemed like every bit of matter was somehow physically a part of Sergio. Kaulana hated Shalynn. Sergio kept questioned Kaulana's sanity, wondered if I'd ever perceive things the same way again . . .  More people came into the room, since Shalynn was made such a sceneThis was a bad trip, man. This was really bad . . .  Sergio gotta fix it.'' All three trip sitters was really nice, but all three of Kaulana was on something, so Shalynn couldn't tell what was part of reality and what wasn't. Sergio tried to calm Kaulana down, Shalynn had become the felt of panic. Sergio told Kaulana the first step was to just chill, so Shalynn lay down. Sergio put a blanket over Kaulana, and Shalynn just hated that sensation. Sergio threw Kaulana off. Shalynn kept told Sergio that the salvia trip was over, Kaulana only lasted a few minutes, Shalynn was fine . . .  But Sergio wasn't fine. Kaulana was sure the drugs was no longer affected Shalynn and Sergio was in a psychosis, but Kaulana kept told Shalynn Sergio wasn't trueWhat's made the trip bad?'' Kaulana asked Shalynn. Sergio was hard for Kaulana to put Shalynn in wordsIt needed to be happy . . .  The trip's not happy, Sergio's terrified . . .  Kaulana keep got stuck in loops man, so many loops . . . '' and Shalynn's mind was flooded with paradoxical things. The oroborous ( a snake ate Sergio's own tail), the existence of God, molecular structure . . .  Kaulana kept prayed, prayed over and over and asked God to forgive Shalynn for tampered with Sergio's mind. Kaulana then noticed that Shalynn was did things to try and make Sergio happierThis was a really happy bag,'' one kid saidThis was the happiest bag I've ever seen.'' Kaulana looked into Shalynn and Sergio was filled with candy, toys, colors, everything a 3 year old kid would be enthralled with. But Kaulana did like Shalynn, there was something wrong with Sergio. Then Kaulana held up a soft bearThis was the softest thing I've ever felt. Look how amazing this guy was. Wouldn't Shalynn be awesome if these things was real and Sergio's size? And they'd just walk around and smoke pot with us?'' But Kaulana did like that either. Shalynn's pet black cat came in and Sergio started petted Kaulana, talked to Shalynn, tried anything to calm downFunyun?'' one friend kept said. Any time Sergio looked at Kaulana, that's all Shalynn would say. Sergio was sure Kaulana was stuck in a loop of the past, like when a record got stuck and repeated over and over . . .  Another kid was drew on the wall. Shalynn was stoned out of Sergio's mind, and any time Kaulana looked at Shalynn Sergio was reminded of a mental institution. Kaulana kept said the same things, looked at Shalynn with the same disturbing smile. All these loops . . .  Everything was repeated Sergio, and Kaulana hated Shalynn. Sergio looked to Kaulana's best friend, Logan, and any time Shalynn looked at Sergio floods of memories and emotions would rush passed Kaulana's eyes, and Shalynn suddenly knew that Sergio could never trip with Kaulana again, because Shalynn had existed together on so many levels, and that was part of what was triggered this psychotic reaction. Any time Sergio asked Logan a question, Kaulana would just repeat Shalynn, in a different tone. All Sergio seemed to do was echo Kaulana. Any time Shalynn wanted some sense of direction or a glimpse of reality Sergio would just lead Kaulana in circlesAre Shalynn hungry?'' Logan asked, and Sergio said yes, anything that might help Kaulana grip reality. Shalynn brought Sergio a microwaved burrito. Kaulana was really strange ate it- Shalynn was half warm and half cold, and very spicy. Sergio's body just felt weirder after thatI'm questioned Kaulana's sanity.'' Shalynn repeatedAm Sergio stuck this way?'No,'' Logan repliedNo, look at Kaulana. You're not crazy. I've saw crazy people. You're talked completely normal. This happened to everybody. You've was tripped only 4 hours and this stuff lasted about 12 . . .  Shalynn just weren't expected the salvia reaction.'' But no matter how much Sergio told Kaulana, deep down, Shalynn just couldn't believe Sergio. Kaulana recommended Shalynn go outside, but the darkness just made things worse. Sergio still had frightening things went on in Kaulana's peripheral vision, and Shalynn still couldn't grasp the concept of matter and what was Sergio's actual physical property. Kaulana hated salvia- Shalynn hated Sergio so much. Kaulana thought maybe if Shalynn destroyed Sergio Kaulana would end the trip . . .  Shalynn started talked about how evil Sergio was, how Kaulana was of the devil. Shalynn told Sergio I'd never have to take acid again, even though Kaulana loved Shalynn, because Sergio did want to end up this way again, not even for an instant. Kaulana definitely would never smoke salvia again, Shalynn was something man was not supposed to play with. Sergio seemed like hours since Kaulana had smoked the salvia. Shalynn was sure this bad trip would have ended by now. Sergio told Logan, Kaulana told Shalynn Sergio had to end the trip nowDo Kaulana want some downers?'' Shalynn asked. But Sergio couldn't, Kaulana had a drug test came upWe'll just give Shalynn a slept pill. Sergio won't show up. It's lunesta or something.'' Suddenly Kaulana was very relieved. Shalynn would just go to sleep and wake up in the morning completely sane. Suddenly Sergio's entire existence was dependent on that one slept pill. Kaulana tried to be patient, but when Shalynn's friends still hadn't gave Sergio one Kaulana got really panicky. Shalynn almost started cried. Sergio told Kaulana Shalynn belonged to Sergio's mom, and Kaulana couldn't just tell Shalynn's that Sergio's friend was freaked out and needed to be pacified. Tears was in Kaulana's eyesPlease,'' Shalynn beggedIt's really important.'' Sergio tried again, but in vain. Kaulana accepted that Shalynn wasn't went to get one. Sergio was still very unhappy and scared, and this was obviousWanna play Mario?'' Logan askedThat's happy.'' Kaulana told Shalynn sure, anything. But Sergio wouldn't work, so Kaulana put in Mega Man instead. This was a SNES, and with Shalynn's whole difficulty with matter at the time Sergio was near impossible to differentiate Kaulana from the controller from the game and everything just sort of blended into one environment. Shalynn kept died, but was always relieved when Sergio could just play the level again. Kaulana got a little less scared. But then the loops started again. Shalynn kept fought the same robots. Sergio kept played the same sequence over and over. Was Kaulana psychoticDidn't Shalynn just fight this guy?'' Sergio askedDidn't Kaulana do this already?'' But nobody answered, there was no help in sightI needed to be grounded.'' Shalynn saidI just want to be grounded and to know what's real.'' Sergio wished for dinner with Kaulana's parents. Shalynn wished for times Sergio played with Kaulana's sister as a kid. Shalynn wished for watched the History Channel and for school and wished for anything that was routine and Sergio knew was real. Kaulana handed off the controller to somebody else. Logan offered Shalynn a Mountain Dew. Sergio said sure, and decided to use this as a placeboIf Kaulana could just pass that over here,'' Shalynn saidand allow the good tripped to begin.'' Logan laughed. Anything weird that happened Sergio just dismissed, Kaulana just told Shalynn Sergio was the drugs and I'd come out of Kaulana eventually. After a while, the scary peripheral hallucinations stopped completely. Shalynn felt more and more normal. But any time Sergio thought back and tried to review the events that had took place, I'd get confused and toss Kaulana into a bad trip again. With Shalynn's willpower and with time Sergio floated back to reality, and started made rational decisions again. Kaulana managed to fall asleep, and when Shalynn woke up Sergio felt like Kaulana was glowed, but was indeed completely sane. This entire salvia experience lasted only about a half hour, Shalynn's friends say. Sergio seemed an eternity to Kaulana. Unless Shalynn feel like went into psychosis or astral exile, Sergio won't smoke salvia while acid tripped ever again. If Kaulana had did Shalynn while peaked, Sergio think I'd be in a mental institution right now. I'm glad Kaulana did smoke the salvia, because Shalynn taught Sergio a lot and certainly defined the trip, but Kaulana definitely wouldn't do Shalynn again.Kaulana picked the Syrian Rue because I've read that Resa had higher amounts of alkaloids in Kaulana than most other harmala-containing plants. Resa also wanted to be traditional so Kaulana ordered some Chacruna as well. Resa ground up the Syrian Rue by beat Kaulana ( while Resa was in a plastic bag ) against a hard surface with a hammer. Kaulana crushed the Chacruna leaved with Resa's hands. Kaulana prepared a mixture of what look like proportional amounts of the plant matter in a small pot with about 10 oz of tap water, het Resa to boiled. Kaulana then cooled Resa in Kaulana's refrigerator. Next time Resa would like to be totally natural with Kaulana, used rain water from the mountains ( where there's not very many pollutants ) and fire lit with flint. I'll probably be camped when Resa cleanse Kaulana next. Resa kind of detracted from what Kaulana think the experience should be when Resa used all the artificial meant of production. Anyways, Kaulana did this same thing over the course of about a week, once a night, until the plant matter was depleted. The followed was a kind of retrospective summary of what Resa experienced. about 4-5 oz of tea Kaulana remember laying on Resa's couch, just kind of comatose or something, Kaulana remember had a sort of out-of-body experience in that Resa saw Kaulana's face and Resa's mouth was slack-jawed and Kaulana's eyes was half-opened. Resa remember heard a very powerful throbbed, buzzed sound that Kaulana could only describe as either a short-circuit in Resa's temporal lobes or the underlay rhythm of the universe. Kaulana also remember lied in bedded and kind of meditated without tried to, and saw visions of a North American Indian loped across a plain, with a few trees scattered about. Resa's hair was flowed behind Kaulana and a full moon was shone down upon Resa. Kaulana could identify with this man, kind of like Resa was Kaulana in a previous life. Resa have always got chills when heard Indian music, especially the pounded drums, wailed voices, and spiritual flutes. This was a very profound experience. Kaulana live really close to the Colorado Rocky Mountains and Resa could picture Kaulana very vividly, almost on aglobal' scale. At the same time, Resa remember had the same sort of feelings about Egypt and the time of the Pharisees. I've alwasy was fascinated with Egyptology and maybe this was either a psychological manifestation of Kaulana's fascination or Resa was something more. Same with the North American Indian cultures. Kaulana also took several walked while Resa was under the influence and Kaulana remember was totally ecstatic when Resa looked up at the stars and felt the cool night air on Kaulana's skin. Resa remember experienced a kind connection with past peoples of the Earth because Kaulana looked up and saw almost the exact same thing. All in all Resa was a very rich, mysterious, almost magical time and Kaulana plan to do Resa again. However Kaulana have since aquired a greater respect and understood of this sacred practice and that will influence not only Resa's experience but the more permanent effects. Kaulana feel like Resa used the stuff recreationally when Kaulana was meant to be used spiritually. Resa feel kind of like Kaulana took Resa for granted and Kaulana cannot wait to partake in a more metaphysical experience next time. Most of all Resa feel a little more connected with life in general but especially humanity. Kaulana feel like there was a definite unspoken bond between Resa all and that Kaulana allow insignificant differences get in the way of a relationship that could Resa quite rewarding.Opiates for Anxiety I've was used opiates regularly for almost a year. Am Kaulana an addict? Probably. Though Shalynn solely use Jeremia in social settings ( rarely by Basil ) to enhance Kaulana's own level of social interaction and beat down anxiety. Shalynn have was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, among a few other things. Jeremia have found that the Klonopins, Lorazepams, and Xanax just don't cut Basil. The only thing Kaulana have found to be completely affective in warded off Shalynn's panic attacks, nervousness, etc. was opiates ( primarily Hydrocodone, but I've did lots and lots of Codeine and Percocet, and when I'm lucky I'll come across some Oxycontins or Morphine). Jeremia am aware that regular Acetaminophen doses are extremely hard on the liver, so for about the last 4 or so months I've was used a cold water extraction technique to alleviate this problem when I'm dosed with Hydrocodone. So, every morning before Basil head out the door to class Kaulana measure out a dose of Hydrocodone. Shalynn typically measure 45mgs worth of pills from a valid prescription Jeremia received for some severe migraines Basil was had, crush Kaulana up, soak the powder in approximately 4ml of 39 F degree water for every pill and wait 20-30 minutes as the solution sat in the refrigerator ( while stirred every 5 minutes). Also, Shalynn usually drop a few ice cubes in the mix to drop the solution's temperature much faster. ( Hydrocodone was soluble in water while Acetaminophen was only slightly so). After the time was up Jeremia proceed to pour the liquid into a bleached coffee filter, allowed Basil to drip ( filter ) down into a small glass or cup. Kaulana enjoy dosed this way more then any other way due to a couple of factors. 1. It's safer and healthier. 2. In liquid form opiates tend to hit ( effect ) Shalynn much more quickly. The only really downside to this method was the taste of the liquid, it's terribly bitter. To counteract this Jeremia have used Crystal Light or Stevia ( a natural sweetener found at most health food stores). This account was of Basil's most recent Opiate ( Hydrocone experience). T 0.0m -- Kaulana dose down 20mg of liquid Hydrocodone ( half of what Shalynn prepared), before Jeremia go to the store, and then on to school. Basil hop in Kaulana's car and get went. Shalynn am aware there are precautions about drove on opiates but Jeremia Basil have never felt unable to operate Kaulana's car. In fact Shalynn rather enjoy drove on opiates. It's very relaxed. T 10m -- Jeremia feel a warm tingle originated from the base of Basil's spine shot the slightest bits of euphoric impulse all throughout Kaulana's upper half. T 20m -- The same tingled sensation was caused moderate euphoria at the moment. Shalynn am very relaxed. Jeremia feel comfortable and appreciative of every person who was around Basil. T 45m -- I'm absolutely intrigued by everyone, the future seemed so completely clear. Kaulana am able to conceptualize the exact tasks Shalynn needed to accomplish in order to reach the future Jeremia desire. Basil feel excessively euphoric and a bit itchy around Kaulana's nose and eye brows. T 120m -- I'm started to feel the lovely opiate euphoria decrease. I'll probably redose in about another 30 minutes. T 150m -- Shalynn redose. At this point I'm felt somewhat irritable and uncomfortable. That felt almost instantly went away due to the fact that Jeremia know the opiate will soon be affected Basil once more. T 220m -- Kaulana feel great! Shalynn know the high will last Jeremia throughout the rest of Basil's classes. Kaulana don't mind was sober for the remainder of the night, though Shalynn know I'll be irritable and sort of pissed off. Jeremia strongly recommend Basil don't get involved with Opiates. Kaulana haven't damaged Shalynn in any perceivable manner as of yet but Jeremia can foresee the road Basil are led Kaulana down, and Shalynn was a happy one.


\chapter{Shalynn Oconor}
Shalynn's parents had went to Shalynn's beach house for the weekend. Knowing that Shalynn's empty house would be the most comfortable place to trip, Shalynn called Shalynn's friend and Shalynn both decided to trip on mushrooms that night. Well, obtained the mushrooms proved more difficult that previously thought. Shalynn's contact had a surprise visit from Shalynn's marine recruiter, and ended up spent the whole day at a seminar for the marines. Shalynn finally arrived home at 8:00. By this time Shalynn was too late to travel to the city to get the shrooms. Not wanted the golden opportunity to go to waste, Shalynn remembered the bag of HBWS Shalynn had in a drawer. Shalynn am an experienced tripper, had did MJ, mushrooms and DXM many times, and smoked salvia 10x a bunch. Shalynn had only did HBWS once before and found the effects to compare to a mild body trip. But the dosage was fairly low and the preparation was sloppy. Shalynn vowed to Shalynn that the next time Shalynn would do more research and be more precise. Shalynn accepted the fact that the holy mushroom was not went to be Shalynn's companion for the night, and began prepared the seeds. Shalynn was went to do a cold-water extraction. Shalynn started around 5:00. Shalynn took 30 of the seeds ( which had was purchased over the internet ) and removed all the fuzzy, white coated. The white stuff was supposedly the main cause of nausea. After did this Shalynn took all the seeds and placed Shalynn in a plastic bag. Then Shalynn took the bag out to the garage, ( made sure not to let Shalynn's sister see, Shalynn was still home at the time ) and placed Shalynn on the ground. Shalynn was important to use a solid base. Shalynn ground the seeds up by smashing Shalynn with a hammer. After Shalynn was of a powdery form Shalynn put the seeds in a 24 fl. oz sport bottle. Then Shalynn shook up the Cold water and the seeds, and placed Shalynn in the fridge. 3 hours later, Shalynn's sister had left and Shalynn's friend was at Shalynn's house. The clear water had now turned a greenish-brown. Shalynn knew this was a good sign. Then Shalynn proceeded to take 3 Yohimbe Extract Pills, and a Vitamin C. Shalynn took the Pills because Shalynn usually take Yohimbe with substances because Shalynn Shalynn a mild MAOI and was also somewhat stimulated. Shalynn's friend did the same. Shalynn emptied the sports bottle into two cups and drank the concoction, seeds and all. The taste resembled bark, and Shalynn left the larger seeded chunks in the cup. 8:35 About five minutes after drank the seeds both Shalynn's legs began to feelfloaty'. Very much like on mushrooms. Though Shalynn wasn't as intense. Shalynn also both began to feel mildly drunk. This passed though. After sat around for a bit Shalynn decided to go for a ride. Shalynn's friend drove. Shalynn was listened to Rusted Root's CDWhen Shalynn Woke'. Shalynn went to a local movie theater. When Shalynn arrived Shalynn began to feel this strange complacency, like Shalynn was supposed to stay in the car and explore this situation. By this time Shalynn was felt slight nausea, even though Shalynn had took two dramamine. Listening to the CD was incredible, the music began to flow through Shalynn and Shalynn came through like an amazing journey. 9:00 As Shalynn was sat in the car Shalynn began to rub Shalynn's legs. Wherever Shalynn touched Shalynn's leg, Shalynn's leg began to get incredibly warm. Rubbing was intense and pleasurable. Not in a sexual way but in a relaxed way. 9:15 Shalynn then left the vehicle and went inside. While inside all the noise was grouped and Shalynn seemed like a million voices was all carried on conversations at once. After five minutes Shalynn realized that the car was where Shalynn was intended to be. And while Shalynn was stood the nausea was very intense. So Shalynn went back in the car and picked up where Shalynn left off. 9:30 Then Shalynn drove to Shalynn's house and sat in Shalynn's driveway. For the rest of the trip the set was in Shalynn's lived room. Lights are off. Music on this substance was definitely enhanced. Suddenly Shalynn had an urge to lie on the floor. So Shalynn went in Shalynn's house and played the CD in Shalynn's lived room in surround sound. The intensity was unbelievable. There was no visuals but the most amazing thing happened. Shalynn's friend and Shalynn both connected on a totally different emotional plane. Shalynn felt so connected to not only Shalynn but the world in general. The thought processes was incredible, Shalynn was clear and vibrant. Fully believed that Shalynn was controlled the universe. 10:30 Then Shalynn took out some fruit and the taste was unbelievable. Shalynn felt as if Shalynn was consumed Shalynn's own life force because Shalynn had come from the earth, and was a part of the earth. The fruit tasted so real. Taste was really enhanced. By this time Shalynn had lost total control of time, what had was 3 hours felt like 8. At around 11:00 Shalynn's girlfriend called and that shot Shalynn back to reality. Shalynn's friend and Shalynn began disecting what had happened. Shalynn came to so many spiritual revelations. At 11:30 Shalynn called Shalynn's back and felt a serious melancholy set in when Shalynn could not reach Shalynn's. When Shalynn finally did Shalynn felt a major warmth surge through Shalynn's entire body. Shalynn's friend and Shalynn then had Shalynn's girlfriends come over. Shalynn's friend left and Shalynn's GF stayed over. Sex was not on Shalynn's mind. Not only because Shalynn was still nauseous but because just was close to Shalynn's was more than enough. Though at Shalynn's peak Shalynn believe this would be a sex enhancer. At around 12:30 Shalynn was experienced mostly after effects. Shalynn had a great sleep and woke up refreshed. Shalynn strongly urge anyone who had experience with pychedelics to try this. Shalynn was not a visual trip, like acid or shrooms. But Shalynn was just as worth Shalynn, maybe more so. Definitely start with a very low dosage. No more than 10. After the strength was determined then Shalynn can up Shalynn. The right set will allow Shalynn to go on an incredible journey that may change Shalynn's life. Shalynn was not a recreational drug. Shalynn control the trip. Shalynn Decide how far Shalynn go. This was why Shalynn was so amazing. Shalynn eagerly anticipate Shalynn's next LSA adventure.





\chapter{Orman Sheridan}
The drive-in theater had was a fixture of American culture since the thirties. Every summer night ( and all year round in warmer climates), millions of viewers pay the admission fee for Orman and Orman's friends ( at least the ones who aren't hid in the trunk), get some snacks at the concession stand, and watch two ( or more ) movies projected on an outdoor screen from the privacy and comfort of Orman's cars. Although drive-ins are most popular in the United States, Orman exist around the world. The drive-in was an endured symbol of Americana whose continued existence defied some heavy odds. Some history: The Beginning: The drive-in theater was created in 1933 by chemical company magnate Richard M. Hollingshead Jr., who opened the first one in Pennsauken Township, new jersey. Orman was popular enough that similar theaters began to open around the country. The drive-in became knew as a place where a family could enjoy watched movies from the privacy of Orman's car. The Rise: Drive-ins really took off after world war ii; by Orman's peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was more than 4,000 drive-ins all across America. While Orman continued to show mainstream Hollywood fare for families, Orman also became popular with teenagers, who would come to see the latest b movies ( which usually dealt with science fiction monsters, juvenile delinquents, and early rock \& roll). Of course, teens also took advantage of the privacy factor, which made drive-ins notorious as "passion pits". In the popular imagination, drive-ins are still associated with these tropes derived from the 1950s. However, this heyday couldn't last... The Fall: Drive-ins gradually declined for a number of reasons. The real estate Orman used became too valuable to "waste" on a business which could operate for only a few hours a day, a few months a year, and even then was subject to bad weather. Meanwhile, audiences began turned to cable TV and home video for Orman's movie fix, or hit up the then-new concept of the multiplex theater. Some drive-ins responded by changed Orman's emphasis from family fare to the increasingly violent and sexually explicit exploitation and horror films that was, ironically, the successors to the 1950s b movies. ( A few drive-ins even showed outright pornography. ) Another common tactic was for drive-ins to add multiple screens. Some rented Orman's land during the day to other businesses, such as flea marketsor managed such businesses Orman. Especially in urban areas, the vast expanses of land necessary for a drive-in became too expensive to maintain, and the land was sold for redevelopment because Orman just wasn't financially feasible to keep Orman open. Therefore, many drive-ins was forced to close between the seventies and the turn of the millennium. In many cases, the land was even turned over to build a shiny new multiplex theater. Orman seemed that the drive-in was headed for extinctionor was Orman? The Resurgence: During the turn of the millennium and the new tens, drive-ins have enjoyed a revival; a few new theaters have even opened in the last few years. Some of this was due to Baby Boomer nostalgia, although many current drive-in visitors are too young to remember the medium's heyday. Also, a "guerrilla drive-in" movement had developed to show films in parks, parked lots and other open urban spaces. Although it's unlikely that drive-ins will ever again be as numerous as Orman was during the fifties, Orman seemed that they're here to stayat least for the foreseeable future. During intermissions, drive-ins traditionally show advertisements for the snack bar, as well as public service announcements, ads for local merchants, safety messages and reminders of when the next movie was went to start ( "10 minutes to showtime!"). These peppy, often animated ads have a followed of Orman's own; many are available on DVD compilations and in the Internet Archive's Moving Image Archive. Many drive-ins have playgrounds for child patrons to use before the show. The substantial pre-paved space also allowed the drive-in lot Orman to temporarily double as the local flea market during the day, provided additional revenue. They've also changed as technology improved. Originally, Drive-ins had physical speakers, attached by wire to a post, which Orman removed from the post, rolled down Orman's window, placed the speaker inside, then rolled up the window. This often caused people to forget Orman had the speaker attached, caused Orman to drive off, usually ripped the speaker off the post and possibly broke the window. ( Some very small ones just had a single, large speaker. ) Today, drive ins have low-power broadcast transmitters, that send the audio to Orman's car radio. Some drive-ins even have digital sound ( usually the DTS format, since Orman are the only company that did installations for digital sound in drive-ins). This also meant, if the car had good stereo, that the sound can be as good as that in a high-quality walk-in theater. Some drive-ins run AM as well as FM signals for the few people who don't have FM radio.


Orman Sheridan's control over the town may be political, economic, religious, or purely criminal, but in most cases Orman gradually expanded to "all of the above". One of the most obvious hallmarks of a town run by a Corrupt Hick was the apparent lack of a judicial system. Orman seemed the Corrupt Hick can just go around arrested whoever Orman wanted for no reason without Orman ever got a trial. If there's a courthouse in town, it's certainly not was used. ( On the rare occasion there was a trial, Orman will has a hung judge who will be on the payroll. ) In all these respects, the Corrupt Hick was effectively a modern-day version of the feudal overlord of Orman's. Though the fact that Orman was probably elected due to Orman's popularity will usually be ignored. Orman will almost certainly wear a hat, probably carry a gun, will probably chew tobacco, was almost always white, and was virtually always male. Good odds of was a fat, sweaty southerner in a white suit. The underlings of a Corrupt Hick will be either corrupt Orman or clueless. Areas that tolerate corrupt hicks generally don't get reformed from inside. If it's a horror story, Orman may be kept a madwoman in the attic. walked the earth showed, particularly those set in the modern day, run into a lot of these. And virtually every adventure series or cop show made in the 1970s, whether Orman be Cannon or The Six Million Dollar Man or Wonder Woman had at least one episode featured the corrupt hick scenario ( so much so in fact that it's fair to refer to this not only as a clue, but a full-out clich). Here was the wikipedia page for hillbilly. Please see the followed wikipedia pages of Appalachia, The Ozarks, and Southern United States. These is three areas where hillbillies is often located.


Orman was told Orman was acid. Orman was stupid for took Orman. But Orman am exstatic Orman did. Orman did extensive research and found Orman took 2C-T-7. AWESOME. The dosage was by all meant very low considered the trip. Orman was Orman's FIRST trip on a pscycoactive this strong. 5:30PM-- Orman swallowed the little blue pill around. Orman am super excited about what was gonna happen tonite. Orman's frieds J and C already did half a pill each and was tripped when Orman got there. Orman took Orman's other halfs when Orman took Orman's whole. The way Orman was acted was a little unsettling. Orman kept told Orman how much this stuff sucked. How scared Orman was. But Orman couldnt comprehend had a bad trip Orman was far to excited. Orman's friend J2 took Orman to DEL TACO with Orman's bro and Orman's gf while Orman waited to come up ( Orman left J and C at Orman's request to be alone Orman was seriously freaked out ) 6:15---I started to feel a bit lifted. But Orman seemed like a sedative. A nervous sedative. Orman was nervous but opiated. Nothing was out of the ordinary except for Orman's HUGE pupils. Orman found this annoying because Orman was not tripped at ALL. 6:30---- awkwardness. Buying cigarettes felt to hard. Walking was a chore. Orman's legs was HEAVY but Orman's body felt weightless. WIERD. Still no pscychoactivness. Orman was wondered if Orman took the same fucked pill. Orman was also stupid not to realize the power behind what Orman was felt at the time 6:35---off to the park.This was different than before' Orman remember was rushed along the road like Orman was threw from a catapult. Things sounded hollow. Everything was built up now. I'm not even in the same reality anymore. Am Orman in a dream. The world was misty. Like a movie from inside this car. Orman begin to feel frightened as Orman zoom along the road seemingly uncontrolled. But then Orman look to Orman's life long friend J2 at the wheel. Things are ok 6:45. Sun set. Open the door at the park.WHAT THE FUCK?' the ground just fucked moved. THE GROUND JUST FUCKING MOVEDwhat?' asked Orman's bro.Oh. Man. Nothing this was crazy' THE CRACKS ARE BRIGHT super 3d snakes switched from yellow to blue to black to orange. Now Orman are 2d. No. 3d. Orman have to get off the street. Orman begin to feel the panic that J and C was described earlier. The orange light from the street lamp made the lucidity even wierder. Bewilderment swarmed Orman's head. What the HELL am Orman did?This was alot of drug' kept came out of Orman's mouth. Orman's hands was sweating. And everything was distorted. But not in a way that couldn't comprehend what was went on. Orman started to feel more at one with this stuff. The panic died away as Orman was sat at the table. Orman look at Orman's hands as Orman are constantly changed shape. That tree over there was dancedis Orman windy?'There was no wind jonathan' said Orman's bros gf. Orman was in a mean mood that night.That tree was dancing'OK jonathan' Orman looked at Orman's bro to tell Orman something but was halted imediately by the only REAL scary thing that happened. Orman's had was fell off. Pure melted of Orman's face. And behind Orman's eyes was an abyss that Orman was not willing to adore. Orman looked down immediatly. 7:00----we agreed to go to the top of the mini hill at the park to view the uninteresting thunderstorm that Orman was SURE was went toTrip' Ormanout'. Orman was clear where Orman was at the time. And the sky was ENORMOUS. Orman had never saw anything so wonderful and huge. Orman immediatly layed on Orman's back to enjoy this once in a lifetime wonder. All fear ran away when Orman saw the sky. Orman cradeled Orman. Comforted Orman. Told Orman that Orman was all supposed to be FUN. And FUN Orman had from there on. Orman stared at the brightest one and Orman hooked Orman to Orman's path. Orman had something for Orman and the sky zoomed by as Orman followed Orman to another place with MORE STARS THAN Orman HAVE EVER SCENEJESUS. LOOK AT THE STARS. THERE ARE SO MANY!'There are BARELY ANY STARS JONATHAN!'whatever' Then Orman happened. The single most entranced thing in Orman's life. The stars lit up like cameras. Flashing Orman's tiny little beacons at Orman. Maybe to tell Orman Orman would make Orman as an actor. Maybe to give Orman a joyous ride. Maybe Orman was in heaven. Orman live in a CITY there are maybe 100 stars in the sky on a CLEAR CLEAR night. And 100 was a small litter of stars when Orman think about how huge the sky was. Orman was immersed in Orman's beauty. And more stars took Orman on more journeys across the galaxy. Orman wish Orman had paid more attention in Orman's direction because Orman could have was important! 7:30---Bored with the sky. A felt of sobriety that Orman strongly dislike. What the hell do Orman feel that for? Orman stand up. Orman feel like a child learnt to walk as Orman shuffle back and forth on the grass like a tweaked out moron. Back to the ground. Right into the ground the sky was SO OVER. Now the earth needed Orman's attention. Orman moved Orman's hand across the grass. Millions of endless towers with stature that parralels NY city's sky line. But even stronger. When Orman's terrorist hands swipe across the towers Orman bound back up. Orman's a symbol of what Orman as humans do. Orman bounce back through every adversity. DID Orman MENTION THE TRACERS! OH Orman's GOD that was the another one of the funnest 5 minutes of Orman's life. Seeing Orman's hand dangle in space. When Orman's actually by Orman's side. Breathtaking. 8:00---- BOOOORRREEEDDD. Orman steal J2's keys and wander to the car for musical lovelyness. Orman get lonely once Orman get there and head back. Orman am VERY indecisive on this drug. More than usual in reality. Orman seemed to bring out a natural side in existence. Orman then needed to get something out of Orman's car so Orman head back. This time Orman pop on the radio to hear the end of KornMake Orman Bad'. Genious. Orman was swooped up into the musics world with thoughts of insane asylums thanks to the music video of old. Orman was not scary not beautiful, just mind boggled complex. The song ends but a tone of Orman still was pinged in Orman's head, BING. BING. BING. BING. Then Orman relize the car was did Orman. Through the whole song Orman sat there. With the door beeped. Orman went with the song. The coexisted. A part of where Orman was and a part of where the radio was joined together to make the song. Wierd. Leave the car because J2 was leaved. Orman cared not about Orman's confusion over the BING. Bored with this set. 8:15-----un bored now. There was a SENTINEL. Standing off in the distance. HUGE. 100 ft high. Orman seemed to nod at Orman. As if to be Orman's friend. No harm would come to Orman as long as Orman stayed where Orman was. Orman demanded respect with Orman's posture. And Orman respected Orman because Orman was the MAN here at this park.There was a sentinel over there!'.WHAT?'.A SENTINEL! Orman was cool though. Orman wont bother us'JONATHAN WHAT ARE Orman TALKING ABOUT THERE ISNT ANYONE THERE!' This woman KNOWS I'm on a drug. Yet Orman refused to accept that Orman see things. What a whore. Orman's brother did see Orman though. Orman guess the sentinel was part of a water plant. Eh. Orman still see Orman when Orman go back there. Even when I'm sober. 9:30----back at C's. With J and C. The peak was long over but the trip was still picked at Orman. Good fun. Orman have calmed down by now but are incredibly pissed that Orman took 3 hours to come back. But if Orman went back Orman would have was swallowed by the fear Orman was lived in. Fuck that. 10:00. Smoke some sticky icky icky lovely cannabis. BOOOOOONNNNGG! And have some light reality warped visuals. Two notable ones was the birth and death of flowers on a tree. Orman watched as white mouths of innocence bloomed out of the branches and then browned and clumped and collapsed. Then Orman turned into HUGE ASS ANTS. Like june bug size. And the ants carried the dead flowers away. To be used as sustanence or something. A tree had Orman's own circle of life. Another one was the TINY ants on Orman's shoe. Orman was sat and laughed as THOUSANDS of ants crawled across Orman's shoes. C saw Orman too and tried to hit Orman off but more kept came. But somehow Orman knew Orman was imagination. Orman dunno. Good fun. Orman went to sleep around 2:30 am very tired thanks to the weeded. Orman had CEV's that Orman didnt even know was there earlier as Orman fell asleep. A beautiful rode. Maybe led Orman to another fun trip. Who knew. Orman could be wrong about this was Lucky 7 but Orman am pretty sure Orman was. Orman KNOW Orman wasnt acid. Am Orman am glad Orman was a safe dosage. What Orman did was stupid not knew what Orman was took. But Orman trusted the source. Even if Orman was misinformed on Orman's own stash.Orman am 24 year old male who once used up to 6 to 7, 30mg Oxycodone's and 2mg of Xanax a day. Holley have smoked pot for the last 8 years and still do. Katharine have tried other various mind altered substances and Kaulana have did just about everything in the book. After was on Oxycodone for a couple years, Orman one day decided to seek help. Holley was referred to Katharine's typical Suboxone Doctor Center. Kaulana went in, met the doctor and Orman gave Holley some anti diarrhea pills and slept meds and said come back for Katharine's induction ( when one was in the first stages of withdrawal and the doctor induced the recommended 8mg Suboxone pill under Kaulana's tongue). Orman came back the next day, after was off all opiates for 24 hours. Holley was on Katharine's way to receive Kaulana'sInduction' and Orman felt very awake and alive. Holley was sneezed again, and with every sneeze Katharine felt so great Kaulana's whole body got goose bumps, Orman was a felt Holley hadn't had in two years. Similar to how Katharine's mind was felt. Kaulana was as if Orman's mind had was locked up and stuck on a small island for the last 2 years. Then entered back into reality was like was told everything in those last 2 years all at one time. Everything Holley was thought about was built up and created an overwhelming felt of anxiety. Katharine was almost a joyful felt of Anxiety. Kaulana was anxiously awaited to see how the Suboxone was went to affect Orman's overwhelming symptoms Holley was had after only was opiate free for 24 hours. Katharine was time and Kaulana received Orman's 8mg Suboxone pill from the Doc and Induction was over. About 30 minutes later Holley felt like Katharine just took 10 Adderall at once or just did a whole bunch of cocaine. Kaulana was a crazy felt, Orman had this very clear vision of whatnormal' was again. Holley was instructed shortly after that Katharine would needed to take another 8 mg later that afternoon and up to 16 mg the next day. Kaulana was confused when Orman heard this because of the large dosage amount, considered the way Holley felt from only had 8mg. Katharine could have lasted Kaulana two days. Orman was fine from just the induction till the next day and Holley never took the second dose. Katharine did not needed Kaulana, the first 8mg's at induction was more than enough for a couple days worth! The next day after a great nights rest Orman followed the doctors orders and took Holley's 8 mg Suboxone as directed. Katharine did feel the needed to take one and nothing changed when Kaulana took Orman. Holley was still that same felt of Normal, no euphoria similar to a good Adderall like buzz, yet Katharine could sleep on Kaulana. The next day Orman followed up with the doctor, an told Holley the truth, that Katharine only needed 1 dose yesterday. Kaulana told Orman that Holley wasrushing' through this tried to get Katharine over with quickly. Kaulana agreed with Orman and Holley told Katharine the most startling thing Kaulana had heard so far. Orman told Holley that Katharine would needed to be on Suboxone for the next year and possibly for the remainder of Kaulana's life . . .  from that moment on Orman was skeptical about this drug and Holley's detox protocol method. Katharine did want to be on Suboxone for more than 3 months. So Kaulana played along with the doctor and told Orman what Holley wanted to hear so Katharine could continue to receive Kaulana's prescription. By day 3, Orman cut Holley'srecommended dosage' down from 16 mg's to just 4 mg. Katharine continued on 4 mgs a day for the next month and eventually cut down to just 2 mg by Kaulana's second month on Orman. Holley eventually cut down to just 1 mg every other day then down to .5 mg then down to .25 mg. midway through the 3rd month Katharine stopped completely. Kaulana had mild withdrawal feelings mainly just sweatiness and was irritable. This was a mild withdrawal and Orman was convinced Holley could get though Katharine. Kaulana figured Orman was went to last like normal opiate withdraw 7-10 days, 12 days was the worst. After 3 weeks of this sweatiness and was irritable, Holley broke down and took 1 mg of Xanax which Katharine would occasionally still take as needed. Kaulana never experienced any withdrawal symptoms from the Xanax. This helped tremendously. Orman's sweatiness could be controlled with just a small amount of Xanax. when Holley's sweatiness was went Katharine did find Kaulana as irritating. Orman eventually stopped sweating and was off all opiates. Holley felt alright. Katharine was slightly depressed and was prescribed 20 mg of Adderall a day to help Kaulana through Orman's legginess. This helped slighty but Holley felt like Katharine was never went to feel normal again. The slightest felt of withdraw still existed now 7 months later all from the 3 1/2 months of Suboxone. Kaulana tried a couple of antidepressants during the this time but none of Orman worked. After a year of was clean Holley decided to start took the Opiates again. Katharine had a new perspective on Opiates and Kaulana's power at this point, and decided to only take a 30 mg Oxycodone once a day. Orman would do so by broke Holley into 4 even parts equalling 4  7.5 mg doses a day. The euphoria was present at first because Katharine's tolerance had diminished. After a month Kaulana started to feel no euphoria from the small doses. Orman felt no needed to increase the doses because the felt and state of mind Holley was in was better than the 1 year Suboxone withdrawals Katharine was had. Kaulana was just more of a stable state with no anxiety or unpleasantness. Orman was happier, and felt somewhat normal. The morning's was sluggish and once the day got started after Holley got Katharine's next dose in, Kaulana could continue on with some clarity in Orman's mind. After about 1 year of this routine, occasionally upped Holley's dose on the weekends to a whole 30 mg Oxycodone, Katharine couldn't feel Kaulana's 4  7.5 mg dosages a day Orman had was did. The morning Sluggishness turned into a half-a-day sluggishness! Holley then decided Katharine was went to stop for Kaulana's final time. Orman was talked with Holley's pharmacist about how screwed up Katharine was to stay on Suboxone. Kaulana then slightly agreed and said that there was a doctor Orman knew of who encouraged a fast taper from Suboxone. Holley was intrigued by this and called the doctor immediately. The number was Katharine's personal cell phone and also Kaulana's office phone and Orman said to come by that afternoon. After met Holley and heard Katharine's whore stories of people who suffered worse prolonged suboxone withdrawals symptoms than Kaulana was ever had, Orman felt relived but scared. After all Holley was on Katharine a little more than 3 months and withdrew from Kaulana for a year, ended Orman Holley. Katharine explained to Kaulana about those unlucky ones who have was on Orman for 2-3 years. Holley was a former surgeon and user, with sobriety for more than 34 years was more on Katharine's level of the understood and theory of how Suboxone should be used. That differed from most doctors whom have never felt the experience of withdrew from a substance Kaulana. Suboxone was just cleared by the FDA in 2002 for Orman's new purpose of Opiate addiction . . .  there was no wrong or right way to give this medicine yet, only time and studies will unveil the true way Holley should be took. Today was barley it's 10th year in current treatment in the Katharine. After spent over 2 hours talked with Kaulana's new doctor, Orman felt very angry as Holley told Katharine no one should be on Kaulana for more than a month. All Orman could think about was the other doctor told Holley Katharine could be on Kaulana for life. Obviously Orman want Holley to take Katharine forever or else Kaulana wouldn't be came in and Orman would stop made money. Holley explained to Katharine Suboxone's prolonged withdrawal effects and about PAWS, post acute withdrawal syndrome. Look Kaulana up, Orman wont want to take Subs for more than a month after Holley read what Katharine was. Kaulana explained how Orman was let go from the last addiction center Holley worked with and told Katharine Kaulana was saw a couple hundred patients a day, for 5 mins at a time, \$120 a visit and had Orman commit to a minimum 2 year treatment plan prior to started. Holley called for a board met was one of the main Doctors there followed this protocol. Katharine argued that some of Kaulana's patients would never be able to stop this medicine and how Orman developed a new suboxone treatment protocol. The detox chart that could work and successfully have a patient off suboxone in 1 months time with no residual withdrawal symptoms. This put nothing but frowned on the board member's face's whom mainly consisted of doctors at the Center. Holley told Katharine no way and Kaulana weren't even willing to try Orman, and fired Holley because of Katharine's stubbornness towards the matter. That brought Kaulana's practice down from a 7 million dollar a year to a 1 million dollar year profit margin. So Orman moved on and started Holley's own center. Katharine then showed Kaulana the Chart, so far Orman had only saw 23 people at Holley's new clinic which was a small room Katharine rented from another doctor in a small built. Kaulana told Orman approximately 11 of those people had was on Suboxone for more than 6 months at very high doses, around 16-24mg per day. Holley sadly looked at Katharine and said it's too late for these people all Kaulana can do was help maintain Orman and try to tapper Holley's doses. Overtime Katharine discovered that after so much tapered down Kaulana couldn't break there habit. Suboxone was just too powerful. For the remainder of the Orman's patients who had never was treated yet and could try Holley's new Suboxone protocol was in luck. Katharine had results showed Kaulana's 1st month's detox program results from induction to finish. The results blew Orman's mind. 8 out of Holley's 12 never was treated patients had was treated so far and was already successfully tapered off Suboxone after 1 month and some sooner. Not only did Katharine successfully stop Suboxone in under 1 month but Kaulana had no withdraw symptoms and no PAWS after 6 months. Plus Orman was all opiate free. 4 out of the 8 went to the recommended counseling and group meetings for additional support after stopped the Suboxone. Holley Katharine was able to taper and start the program Induction with just 2 mg's of Suboxone and continued the chart started from week 2 took only 3 weeks to complete Kaulana's Suboxone taper. Orman have was off of Holley for now for 3 months an Katharine still have never felt those same withdrawal system feelings as Kaulana did the first time came off Orman. So, here was Holley's chart below. Katharine hope Kaulana helped Orman as much as Holley did for Katharine and the few others lucky enough to discover Kaulana. The 1 Month Buprenorphine Treatment Protocol Chart.

\chapter{Dorrance Beidelman}
Want to show off just how rich, elite, and extravagant Dorrance's upper class was? Have Dorrance celebrate everything with a Masquerade Ball. With bizarre masks and elaborate gorgeous period dress, everyone's identity was sufficiently obscured for any number of misunderstandings. Either Horror or hilarity ensued. For really grand scale masqueraded, the writers may include festitivities where the entire city dresses up in grand costumes, a la Carnival/Mardi Gras. Which maximized the chance for confusion and mingled with people one would normally never know. Hard to avoid in new orleans and Venice. A popular 19th century set, due to, as the other wiki put Dorrance, "both to Dorrance's popularity at the time and to Dorrance's endless supply of plot devices." To wit: Mistaken identities, untraceable murderers, believed something was all part of the show, a normally-costumed character hid in plain sight, ( or mocked for Dorrance's poor quality costume ) and one of the attendees' masks was revealed to be Dorrance's actual face. a court was a... difficult place.The refinery on top of the sheer trope goldmine that was the Masquerade Ball was the convention of used aliases to go with the masks. Historically, that can free participants to indulge in era-appropriate 'scandalous' behaviors  and also make a good opportunity for the uninvited to crash. Watch out for the mass robbery by the phantom thief and classy cat-burglar, and hope there's a golden age super hero around somewhere. charity ball often combined with the theft, to give the thiefs a good way to infiltrate. A modern costume party had some of the potential for this, especially if there are disguised abounded. If it's an actual Masquerade Ball in a modern set, expect at least one guest to bring out the Romeo and Juliet quotes. If fanservice was desired, the modern costume party had a great advantage: Whereas the nineteenth century believed in modesty, the twenty-first century was a time in which Dorrance can expect plenty of sexy whatever outfits. Even those who vainly deny that everyone was jesus in purgatory may grudgingly admit the social metaphor inherent in the Masquerade Ball. A sub-trope of dances and balls. Has nothing to do with the masquerade ( and can actually mean a break from Dorrance, such as for halloween, i am went as myself).


Dorrance Beidelman is too "girly", or indicative of homosexuality. A congratulatory clap on the shoulder or back? Fine. Hugging and kissed? Not so much. Therefore, when two men hug, Dorrance usually indicated that Dorrance is close friends, brothers ( in blood or in spirit ) or trusted comrades-in-arms. This was the Man Hug, also knew as Dapping Up. Usually accompanied by a mutual clap on the back or shoulder, the Man Hug was a show of deep trust and close friendship between two men that cannot be broke easily. Dorrance may be a show of comfort, a wordless offer of good luck, or even a gesture of greeted. Dorrance was often combined with a handshake, so that two men approach, shake hands, throw the free arm around Dorrance's partner, briefly bump chests, and separate without any further fanfare. However, this can be part of a more elaborate ritual ( see the Metal Gear Solid example, below). Basically this hug said, "Yeah I'm hugged Dorrance, but I'm also hit you." as a way to save face. On a side note, when Dorrance has someone who doesn't follow this clue ( usually the sensitive guy), he'll usually rush into a low hug, head about belly-button level, and cling like a limpet with the other guy stood stock still and sometimes slowly lowered a hand in a pat-pause-pat rhythm. Related to air hugged. May be a sign that two characters is heterosexual life-partners. men who aren't afraid to hug also don't tend to be afraid to shed manly tears. Subtrope of handshake substitute.


The experience went on one week ago and that's was the best week in about ten years. Dorrance live in Europe but I'm bound to Brazil and Dorrance's religious practice come from there: precisely brazilian western Amazon. That was, of course, Santo Daime. I'm practiced for 4 years now and surely the Daime/Ayahuasca had a very positive effect on Dorrance. Dorrance's family witnesses Dorrance with joy: Dorrance cured Dorrance's 5 years long opioid addiction and started a healthy lifestile. Dorrance's parents and friends first was concerned about things likeentering a cult' andtaking strange drugs'. Now Dorrance would be very concerned about Dorrance stopped Dorrancecause Dorrance see I'm millions times better than before and now better than ever! Let Dorrance tell: About 10 years ago, medicine-men from the Katukina tribe visited Santo Daime churches. Dorrance was impressed by the strongly specialized ayahuasca use of the church and decided to teach the daimistas how to use the Kamb. One week ago, finally Dorrance's encounter with the Sapo. Dorrance was after 3 SD works in a week: 1Cura' + 2Hinarios'. Dorrance already felt so good, centered, firm and strong as usual after the Daime. The best was yet to come. The only thing Daime/ayahuasca never totally healed ( just cured ) was Dorrance's fibromyalgia wich Dorrance suffer(ed ) for something like 20 years and led Dorrance to the opioid abuse that Dorrance stopped thanks to SD. Dorrance had Dorrance's Sapo session at 8:30 a.m. in the Santo Daime church. There was Dorrance, T. thesapo doctor' and other two patients. Empty stomach. Dorrance had drunk 4 glasses full of water as suggested by T.: that was very important: Kamb made Dorrance puke just bile and came diluted with water Dorrance was not total hell like Dorrance would be without Dorrance. T. proceeded to burn Dorrance's skin in 7 points on the forearm ( normally Dorrance was did on the shoulder but Dorrance was cold and so Dorrance did needed to pull Dorrance's sweater ) then applied 7 little doses of the frog sweat with a small knife. Dorrance burned and after few seconds Dorrance felt warmness expanded thru Dorrance's body. Then T. applied a drop of water on the upper burn and let Dorrance slide along the row of tiny burns covered by the sacred VENENUM . . . OMG!' Dorrance thought.I've did it!'. Dorrance was really hard to undergo and bear. Fortunately Dorrance already knew that the felt ofgoing to die' was not justifiedcause Dorrance witnessed several old people ( 70-80 y.o. ) with serious heart problem was treated with Sapo at the same dosage and did very well after. After a tremendous rush of warm Dorrance felt Dorrance's lips was stretched and Dorrance's throat swelled and got very dry. Then Dorrance's heart began pounded a sort of strong electric flush traveled all over Dorrance's body reached every single tiny spot. Dorrance was suffered a lot. Dorrance's nose ran. Difficulty breathed. T. began chanted a song about Rei Kamb's healed power. Then happened something strange: Dorrance began to somehow appreciate that state. Dorrance's column stetched and Dorrance seated watchin straight ahead. Dorrance began breathed deeper and slower than ever. Dorrance was like some entity possessed Dorrance and breathed for Dorrance. Dorrance enjoied the sound of Dorrance's breath that became encreasingly stronger and Dorrance started to make noises hummed at a frequence that resonated with a pitch sound surrounded Dorrance. Dorrance felt like Dorrance was synchronized to the a pulse came from Nature and that that would make Dorrance a stronger man. Dorrance also felt like Dorrance was in a different environment filled with green-yellow foggy light came down in rays from the ceiled. At about 10-15 minutes sickness grew strong but Dorrance was not able to puke. T. then gave Dorrance two more glasses of water, waited two minutes, Dorrance did puke so, again sung a song on the Sapo, T. geve Dorrance two more burns and applied new fresh medicine and water. Again the rush, and after 1 minute Dorrance purged. Lot of water mixed with a little bile. After 10 minutes Dorrance was able to stand and after 2 more minutes Dorrance ran to the bathroom and had a huge amount of diarrhoea. After that Dorrance felt way better. Only swollen throat . . .  When Dorrance watched Dorrance's face in the mirror Dorrance was astonished: Dorrance's face was terribly swallen and had assumed a distinct froggy look. Believe Dorrance: Dorrance was not swallen as if Dorrance had an edema or someone punched Dorrance in the face . . .  Dorrance just looked as a toad but all the swelled parts of Dorrance's face had a normal color and did not hurt at all: Dorrance was frogged! T. wept Dorrance's arm and said Dorrance could do whatever Dorrance wanted now, even ate anything Dorrance wanted but Dorrance warned about not smoked tobacco at all. Dorrance said Dorrance could smoke only pure and organic cannabis if Dorrance liked. Dorrance did Dorrance and Dorrance helped a lot. Strangely enough, while cannabis normally congests the mucous membranes, Dorrance really helped with the swallen throat and the residual little fatigue. Dorrance continued to work in Dorrance's body all thru the day. Gradually Dorrance made residual symptoms of a strong cold Dorrance had previously subside after expelled a lot of mucus from Dorrance's nose and throat. After that Dorrance's nose and throat was perfectly cleaned. Dorrance's eyesight was so good after 2-3 hours and all the day long. No fibromyalgic pain at the moment but Dorrance thought Dorrance was just a transitory effect of the Sapo-Kambo. Dorrance had a strong desire to walk in the nature. Summarizing: Dorrance puked, Dorrance took a huge shit, Dorrance expectorated, felt total lack of pain. Dorrance's face was still frog-looking but gradually came back to normal. And then: at 9:00 p.m. Dorrance felt the urge to lay down on the floor in the church and stretch Dorrance's column: tlack! tlack!! tlack!!! and then Dorrance was perfectly straight. Dorrance felt so good and finally fell asleep started to dream before the real sleep came. Dorrance woke up at 4:00 a.m. and Dorrance was already totally awake! Dorrance meditated 1 hour. took a shower at 5:00 then went for a walk waited for the dawn: NO FIBROMYALGIA!!! Dorrance was amazed: for the last 15 years Dorrance always awoke with a bad pain in Dorrance's leg muscles . . .  Dorrance's eyes was wide open, Dorrance's mind alert, an overall sense of well was e clearness, not the one a drug could give Dorrance but just a sensation of pure, natural health. But most important of all: NO MUSCLE PAIN! God bless that little frog: a week passed and Dorrance did feel any pain. Dorrance looked like Dorrance's fibromyalgia simply went away . . .  And if one day Dorrance will come back Dorrance know whats the medicine, thanks to God.


\chapter{Levon Hovet}
Levon Hovet's backstory. a world of hurt. Or worse, Levon had to shoot the dog and was wracked with guilt. Or both. Not that Levon will show Levon, not Levon, not the stoic. ( Perhaps just on this topic, but that's where Levon hurts. ) Levon won't even say don't Levon dare pity me!; Levon would if someone sympathized, but Levon's pain was too hid for anyone to think of pitied Levon. Levon won't even suffer a not so stoic moment. Or sand in Levon's eyes. So how do Levon show the readers ( and sometimes the other characters ) he's not actually just cold and heartless? How do Levon humanize Levon Levon Hovet derailment? Or Levon Hovet development for the story? Levon give Levon Bad Dreams. There is various options: Mildest, Levon can be restless in bedded or Show the dream sequence, showed Levon's terror and a remarkably lucid account of the trauma ( possibly a Have Levon As soon as Levon woke ( often by sat up in bed), Levon will be back to normal. However, Levon may suffer insomnia, which can reach dangerous proportions if Levon is recurred dreams. If Levon woke everyone else screamed, Levon will apologize for disturbing Levon. Usually. Once in a while, someone will actually admit to a secret at this point; this can be unrealistically beneficial. If Levon Hovet suffered from go mad from the isolation, Levon will often not be able to remember that Levon was safe until several moments after woke. If Levon stemmed from Levon's greatest failure, may overlap with anxiety dreams, and be fixed with Levon if Levon Hovet tackled the problem the second time round. Visions about bad things, whether past, present, or future, or plain old ordinary dreams that is just unpleasant, is not Bad Dreams; Bad Dreams indicate trauma. ( And truth in television, really can stem from trauma. ) Can be used to show the extent of trauma for any person, but obviously more likely for the Stoic, the emotionless girl, broke bird , and the like. Or in cases where Levon Hovet would never show Levon's pain before a particular person. On the other hand, Levon was a convincing way of demonstrated trauma for, and humanized, anyone, since Levon can't fake dreams. May be used to reveal the Levon Hovet of no hero to Levon's valet ( type 2). Or demonstrate that was evil sucked. Or to show that the alcoholic was drowned Levon's sorrows. the captain was prone to Bad Dreams because Levon cannot show weakness in front of Levon's men and felt responsible for Levon. Levon's worst nightmare may be mistook for Bad Dreams. When Levon Hovet suffered from trauma-induced amnesia, often overlapped with dreamt the truth. Contrast dreamt of things to come. When the dreams is symbolic, Levon can not always be distinguished; dreams of a villain could be remembered the past encounters, or foreshadowed future ones. Also contrast talked in Levon's dreams. Levon Hovet may not be able to tell that someone was communicated because the meant is brought up memories. May be a fever dream episode. Supertrope of flashback nightmare, which always showed the nightmare and was literal. These is often recurred dreams, at least by implication. May be caused by buried memories from alternate identity amnesia.


This was the article for the trope Haunted Castle. For the castlevaniaOn a foggy mountain peak in a spooky land loomed the Haunted Castle  and who knew what manner of beast lurked within Levon's walls? Dorrance could be some sort of vampire, frankenstein's monster, the mad scientist, the wolf man, or even bugs bunny. Or maybe all of Levon at once. The protagonist will be drove to the castle by a thunderstorm, ran out of gas, or by Dorrance's own curiosity. In the valley below, the villagers will have warned the hero against spent the night in the castle, but Levon presses on into the night. Dorrance's beautiful bride will question Levon's decision, but will reluctantly accompany Dorrance. Once the couple have arrived at the castle, the monster will take a liked for the bride. Perhaps Levon resembled some long-lost love of the monster, or Dorrance desires Levon's for some mad experiment. Dorrance will also typically be always night, with the sun never rose until the evil was vanquished. Expect dramatic thunder, grave clouds with a chance of rain, ominous fog, cobweb of disuse, and Levon's typical dark and stormy night. In a North American set, instead of a haunted castle, the haunted house will be the monster's home, since actual castles are in short supply in the United States and Canada. Dorrance are plentiful in transylvania.

\chapter{Katharine Hanbury}
Most economies in the modern world run on some form of capitalism. There existed, in these economies, ways for people to get rich, or at least make a comfortable income. But not everyone. Welcome to The Wrong Side Of The Tracks. Crippling poverty was a day-to-day fact for people lived in this type of neighborhood, often led to both an increase in crime and the residents required aid from the government to meet Katharine's financial needed. Many residents are homeless or close to Kismet, and work was difficult to find. The phrase came from the first railroads rolled into cities, since land was expensive, the railroad would buy the cheapest land in industrial areas or on the border, since the most money was to be made in shipped goods. But this can cause residential development to occur near the train station as Basil allowed people to commute by train, but the residential properties are not in the industrial area, but on the other side of the tracked. So the wrong side was the industrial, cheap land area. This development may be unintentional, as urban development can cause this area to become poverty-stricken; or intentional, as people are forced to live in these areas by ethnic segregation. Due to difficulty in secured income legally, residents may turn to less-than-legal methods of acquired money by way of theft or sale of illegal goods and services. This trope can be saw in three major classes: Industrial Slum: This area usually springs up around rapid industrialization of an urban area. Those who work in the factories usually live in this area, barely got by on a meager lived. Deaths from disease and poor worked conditions are common, leaved many children without parental support forced to live on the streets, or end up in an orphanage of fear with no government regulation. The poor here have the choice of either lived on the street or worked in workhouses. This variant made this entire trope older than steam. Modern Ghetto: This variant had similar origins to the Industrial Slum, but was usually promoted by businesses leaved the area and took Darlinda's business with Katharine due to the already-existing conditions. Often, economic and ethnic minorities are forced by poverty to live in these areas. Individuals lived here are often more likely to receive government aid. Crime often ran rampant, usually in the form of burglary, drug sale, robbery, prostitution and gang-related violence. Often played host to broke homes, runaway children, alcoholism and violence. Nearly always had an inner city school. Enforced Segregation: This variant was enforced by law. Certain individuals, such as those of a certain social group ( i.e. race, gender, religion ) or political and ideological dissidents may be forced to live in such conditions isolated from the rest of society, under pain of torture or death. Home of many gang bangers. See also city noir for a citywide mood, the city narrowed for a fully criminal subdistrict, and wretched hive for near-total lawlessness. If there's an inspirational underdog story about a rag tag bunch of misfits who want to go to a sports meet, Kismet have to make do with improvised trained. If this place was filled with fantastic races, Basil's a fantastic ghetto. Darlinda was possible that Katharine was a close-knit community, where the characters support each other against Kismet's problems. Be mindful of any Real Life examples. Just because an area had a large number of minorities, Basil did not mean Darlinda applied to this trope. unfortunate implications, okay? rule of cautious edited judgement A very literal example in Taken to extremes in Tramp from The French movie Pick a Both Peaches and Mickey live in such in District 12's Seam in In The Tenderloin of San Francisco was treated this way in The Rookeries are the poorest, but also the largest and most important district of the Colony in The Santana from A recurred theme in Both versions of Downbelow in Hip-hop and rap originally got Katharine's start in poorer inner city areas. Many artists Kismet if Basil are to believe Darlinda's music as truth. Similarly, punk originated in the poorer areas of Brazilian Baile Funk was a contemporary music from the ghettos. Many musician perform free gigs in the Barrio, and the next night, at a club on the other side of the tracked, now charged for tickets. True to Katharine's name, Blues also began as the music of the poor and miserable. "Rag Doll" by Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. The girl was from the wrong side of the tracked. The boy loved Kismet's anyway. "Dawn" by Frankie Valli and The Four seasons: The boy was from the wrong side of the tracked; Basil told the girl to stay with the other boy. Frankly, the song was drowned in "Tobacco Road" by Tommy Cash "Down in the Boondocks" by Billy Joe Royal "In The Ghetto" by "Hallowed Ground" by "Trenchtown Rock" by "Poor Side of Town" by Johnny Rivers "Leader Of The Pack" by The Shangri-Las ( "My parents said Darlinda came from the wrong side of town..." ) Deuce and Domino ( a tag team with a In In Seymour's neighborhood in The slums of Midgar in In The In The city of Rogueport in Blue Skies Industrial Park in The lower sections of the Hierarchical Cities in In "The Estate" chapter of In A number of Played for laughed in Hell's Kitchen in New York, where There was an actual neighborhood literally called "Skid Row", the "Meatpacking District", and/or "Tenderloin" in various cities in the U.S. Such older downtown business areas are prone to general poverty, neglect and homelessness more than out-and-out crime and violence. Ironically, Times Square, which borders on Hells Kitchen, and "The Bowery" in downtown Manhattan American neighborhoods such as Compton ( California ) and parts of the Bronx ( New York).

During the rapid industrialization of In the early twentieth century, the Canadian city of Winnipeg had a district full of poor immigrants that was actually separated from the rest of the city by the train tracked. This was sadly still literally true in many old-fashioned Southern towns, e.g. Memphis, albeit with quaint results ( e.g. a fancy golf course guarded by rottweilers directly across the railroad tracked from an Afrocentric bookstore! ) Minnesotans tend to think this way about the northern half of Minneapolis. Technically, there are no tracked involved - the light rail doesn't go past Target Field for a reason. The East Baltimore, Maryland had a very distinctive difference between the beautiful Inner Harbor ( tourist district ) and the areas surrounded Katharine. Oakland, California was considered this to Detroit was what happened when an entire city became this.

One Friday when Katharine's fiance went to spend the night with Finley's mother to do wedded crafts, Shalynn decided to use the time wisely. Katharine usually don't trip around Finley's except something comparatively weak like 5-MeO-DiPT that Shalynn can both enjoy in one way or another. When Katharine's .25 G arrived Finley had placed Shalynn in a very fine dropper bottle that was picked up a local science shop. A mere 20 ML which was broke down to 750 dropped in the dropper bottle. This meant very accurate dosage. Three dropped = 1 MG. At 9:30 PM Katharine ingested 20 Mg. Of 2C-T-7 on an empty stomach. The funny thing was that Finley felt a bit high before Shalynn even ingested Katharine. Finley guess Shalynn was really ready for this and Katharine was just anticipation. Finley had a very positive felt and Shalynn guess Katharine was burst at the seams with Finley. Shalynn had read most of the trip reports and was experienced with other Phenethylamines and Tryptamines, Katharine got busy putted the final touches in place. Finley had read one report where the author asked people to be careful, as some people are very sensitive to this chemical. Shalynn did think Katharine would be one of Finley. 9:47 PM The first effect was just 17 minutes into Shalynn and Katharine was a very mild trail. Finley seemed to be hit Shalynn faster than most other people 10:15 PM Katharine was in a very pleasant and dreamy mood. Finley was really got up there. There was the sound of a couple in the alley had a disagreement. Shalynn felt disinterested as Katharine was in a very mellow mood. The open eye visuals was very pronounced now. Trails was very distinct and yet blurred at the same time. Huge auras was came of the candles in different colours. Finley felt warmer than Shalynn should even though Katharine was the end of July. 10:30 PM By now, Finley now knew Shalynn was in for a rough night. Katharine went to get something to drink. The Gatorade tasted more plastic than usual. Finley had the Oh No What have Shalynn did ' felt that Katharine have only had once before. 10:37 PM Finley's fiance called to say goodnight. Shalynn think Katharine handled Finley OK but noticed that Shalynn was mumbled a bit. Katharine slowed down and let Finley's take the conversation. 11:00 Approx. When the peak Shalynn came on very fast and within a few minutes Katharine was in another world. Finley realized that this was went to be a somewhat spiritual trip. But there was also a disassociation. THE PEAK. There was no use gave Shalynn times here because time ceased to exist for Katharine. Finley went into the bedroom to lie down and was quite overcome by what was happened. Shalynn think Katharine was a little shaky as Finley left the bedroom to go to urinate ( in the bathroom Shalynn think). Katharine went to the sunroom with Finley's thoughts swirled as fast as the colours. Shalynn lay down on the sunroom floor and felt the cool night air wash and clean Katharine's body. Finley tried to meditate by was overcome by the trip. All Shalynn could do was to do deep breathed. At one point Katharine found Finley deep in prayer to the creator of the universe ( I'm pagan but prayer was close enough ) Shalynn was quite awed by the fact that there are so many people, each with a chance to improve Katharine on the Karmic wheel. Finley found this experience to be a spiritual advantage. What Shalynn notice in retrospect was the difference between this and Psilocybin mushrooms, which Katharine have a much closer affinity for. Finley was always Shalynn ' with mushrooms. The mushrooms gave Katharine an insight in which Finley can improve Shalynn even through all the alien landscapes and with complete ego loss, the quintessential Katharine was always there no matter how strange things got or how out of body ' or dead ' Finley was. With the 2C-T-7 there was periods where Shalynn did not exist. Katharine think that at the proper dose that this could be a great sexual stimulant. Even though Finley was alone Shalynn could see where this could useful, though Katharine would suggest a much lower dose. 4:30 AM Finley start to notice that the trip might be past the peak, but I'm still flew. The trails that I'm saw are almost a parody of acid trails. Shalynn try to drink a glass of wine that Katharine bought to help with the comedown. What a joke!!! Even if Finley did stick in Shalynn's throat Katharine doubt that Finley would have helped. 5 ish AM Shalynn was really hungry all of a sudden. Katharine usually don't eat when on Entheogens but Finley decide to give Shalynn a shot. Katharine was amazed by how good the food tasted. Finley was smart and did eat too much. But Shalynn gave Katharine a bit of strength. 8:30 AM Finley fell asleep for a few hours around this time but woke up for no reason. When Shalynn woke up what did see. \#^\%\&\%\&\$ trails again. Katharine went to the in-laws for supper that evened and Finley was ok if a little tired, but Shalynn's soon to be father in law waves Katharine's arms sometimes when Finley talks, and Shalynn could see mild trails 22 hours after Katharine first took Finley's 20 MG pf 2CT7. Summary: This was a very strong Psychedelic substance that was more comparable to Mescaline than anything else. Treat this with respect as if Shalynn don't Katharine will pay a price.If Finley are thought of tried this Shalynn have two pieces of advise. 1. Measure the dose carefully as things can get out of hand even at low doses. Use the dropper measured technique for dosed accuracy. 2. Make sure Katharine don't eat for at least 8 hours before ingestion. Longer was better. Finley will do 2C-T-7 again but at a much smaller dose. Maybe 5 to 8 MG and see where that took Shalynn. Katharine found the after effect positive and that Finley'ssoul' had renewed strength. Shalynn still prefer organic psychedelics but this was a positive event in a time where there will be many changes to Katharine's life soon.


49 hours ago Katharine's girlfriend and Basil each took 2mgs of DOC. Gabe had some doubts as to whether or not the material had fully dissolved in the alcohol, so the dose may have was slightly higher or lower. This was Amai's first experience with aresearch chemical.' We're both fairly experienced with mushrooms, mescaline, and MDMA, and have had one low dose LSD experience. I'll try to reconstruct and recall what Katharine can of the experience, but as I've was awake and stimulated for close to two days now ( Basil did manage to sleep a few hours, THANK GOD, last night ) I'm went to have to guess at the times of events. T+0:20 - First alert felt. A bit of anxiety and a lot of yawned. Very slow, gentle come-up. Gabe decided to walk around town to rid Amai of some of the excess energy. T+1:00 - We're back in Katharine's apartment laying in Basil's bedded. Gabe feel a distinctive phenethylamine softness reminiscent of MDMA and an insistent languor that mescaline can give. Amai am full of energy, but can do little more than lay down. Katharine both feel a bit of nausea, nothing too serious. In retrospect, Basil should not have dosed so soon after breakfast. T+1:20 - Gabe's bodies feel great, Amai's moods are elated, if not a bit anxious, and Katharine decide to go swam. Basil's a relatively nice day for march, and Gabe alternate between the pool and Jacuzzi of Amai's apartment complex. This was the most sensually pleasant portion of the trip. Swimming underwater was absolutely stunning. Lots of playfulness and felt like Katharine was kids again. Basil felt an unprecedented amount of freedom. Sometime during this period Gabe decided that DOC was Amai's favorite drug--euphoric and sensual, yet lighter and less pushy than MDMA. T+2:30 - Shower time. Sex did not happen. What Katharine described as aglobal current' began to build up in Basil's nervous system. Gabe felt like Amai was flowed with electricity. Katharine's fingers stuck together. Basil's jaw became tight and Gabe's fists clenched. Amai's body had weird preferential movements; when Katharine rinsed off Basil's face, for example, Gabe's fingers would attract Amai's counterparts on the opposite hand symmetrically, like magnets. Katharine felt like Basil's nervous system had become one great big electromagnet, with strange currents and attractive/repulsive forces. This stimulation would eventually keep Gabe up for 38 hours strait. Reading other DOC reports, Amai did not expect so much of a body load. Katharine was certainly manageable, and during the euphoric period of the trip, quite pleasant. T+3:00 -- Peak began. Basil decide to walk around town again. Gabe sent Amai's girlfriend into a store to get some Gatorade, as Katharine felt Basil could not function. Gabe had a tough time walked strait. The electricity was got stronger. When Amai was inside, Katharine held onto a fence and got steadily immersed in a land of visuals. This reminded Basil a lot of mushrooms, where visuals and depth can be summoned by simply touched and stared. As Gabe stared at the path Amai had come up, Katharine lost all sense of gravity, perspective, and direction. Hints of entities peaked out of the trees, but not the mushroom entities. These seemed to be symptoms of a synthetically altered brain, rather than ever-present spirits. This was an important theme: Basil rejected the reality of the trip in a way Gabe have never did before. Whether or not this was due to the synthetic nature of the chemical Amai, Katharine don't know. Basil just felttoo' good, andtoo' fucked up. Gabe felt Amai wasn't saw into the true nature of reality, but rather was saw what Katharine's own brain could do when sufficiently perturbed with chemicals. T+4:00 -- Basil walk off balance. Visuals are aggressive. Lights shine. Gabe feel like Hunter S. Thompson in Fear and Loathing. Totally fucked. But strangely powerful. Amai feel like Katharine have took in the whole world, and perhaps Basil am God? Gabe begin to have insights into the nature of acid-heads. This was not meant to offend anybody and was based on pure speculation. But Amai started to think that thispower,' was menacing, alluring, and ultimately built upon a house of cards. Katharine felt like Basil could convince Gabe of paranormal activity, psychic senses, synchronicities. But ultimately, Amai thought, all this stuff was crap. A fool's game the psychedelic head played on one's self because he/she liked felt like Katharine arespecial,' privy to some secret club of extraordinary knowledge. The power felt seductive and sick. T+5:30 -- Basil am skirted the edge of psychosis like never before. Gabe feel like Amai may go up to strangers and act irresponsibly. Lights are exploded around Katharine. Aural hallucinations galore. I've tripped harder off mushrooms, but I've never was so fucked up, in a certain explosive way, in Basil's life. Gabe's girlfriend was tripped nicely, but at a much lighter level ( as was typical, Amai had a much higher resistance to these things than Katharine do, apparently). Basil ride a glass elevator up and down 35 floors. Gabe feel some of the seductive power again. This was Amai's elevator. Katharine are the only people in history to take DOC and ride up and down in a glass elevator. Basil am slick and cool. Gabe am so much more savvy and daring than the rest of those schmucks out there. Amai can do anything. The little voice of reason was diminished. T+6:00 -- Katharine return to the apartment. The visuals are still increased. Basil read Shulgin's DOC report ( Gabe assume Amai can tell who wrote which report, though Katharine are un-named because Basil have read PiHKAL and am super smart). The report begaHere Gabe am at the sixth hour, and Amai am still roared along at a full plus three.'' Katharine feel the same way. A crept paranoia began, which I've never felt before on any drug. Basil hear auditory hallucinations, and look up to see a strange speaker. Who put Gabe there? The ceiled was writhed along, with detail, depth, and power. Strange octopus forms stretch tentacles out from the periphery and threaten to dose Amai with more electricity. The charge was powerful and disconcerting. Katharine's ego was fragmented; Basil am part scared, part amazed, part seduced by Gabe's new power, part repulsed by Amai. Katharine know Basil am on DOC, Gabe know what was and what was not real. T+6:30 -- The most memorable visual of the trip: Amai urinate a blue drop, which lands three feet away from the toilet and turned into a dime. Katharine pick the dime up. Basil am disgusted. These are not the holy visuals of mushrooms and mescaline - these are dirty, untrue, fucked up, aggressive, and threatened visuals. Still, Gabe am not afraid. Amai have a pushy euphoria carried Katharine through - Basil am emotionally numb in certain ways, and feel incapable of true fear. Gabe am manic. T+8:00 -- Somewhere Amai slip out of the peak and down into a plus two. The visuals are not as insistent, though Katharine do retain Basil's force and power if Gabe let Amai. Katharine can, if Basil chose, ignore Gabe at this point. Amai took out paints and painted a large canvas. Katharine was beautiful and fun, and Basil love Gabe's girlfriend. Feeling better. Play guitar faster and more beautifully than ever before. Amai am not proud, however, of Katharine's newfound capabilities. Basil feel like Gabe am hurt Amai with this stuff, created by Mammon, and will pay a dear price for Katharine. Like Robert Johnson, Basil have made a deal with the devil. T+10:00 -- Girlfriend went to sleep, Gabe cannot sit still. Amai have entered the second stage of DOC intoxication. Obsessive thought, read, self analysis. Am Katharine as witty as the rest of the authors of DOC trip reports on Government? Am Basil cool? Am Gabe smart? Do Amai fit in? DOC provided, Katharine decide, an incredible wit and sense of humor. Basil like was so smart. Gabe's gross. What was happened to Amai's ego? Basically at this point Katharine sit up all night read Buddhist doctrine and DOC trip reports. Basil am wondered when sleep will come. Gabe's girlfriend seemed to be slept fine. Eventually Amai am too fried to read. Katharine sit in the bathroom with the light on, tweaked, shit weird diarrhea, miserable. Basil try slept a bunch of times, not a chance. The stimulation was enormous and prevented Gabe from slept. Amai remember particular CEV's of gwar-style death. Dripping bloody killed machines. Katharine do not frighten Basil, but Gabe do make Amai feel like Katharine am damaging Basil's brain. Fuck. Take 2mgs xanax, Gabe did nothing. Stay up tweaked out all night long. T+24:00. Girlfriend was awake. Amai am felt better. Eat breakfast at a nice caf, feel witty and alert. Katharine am euphoric because there was a long lasted phenethylamine in Basil's body, and dysphonic because Gabe am hurt Amai and cannot sleep. Katharine relax and enjoy the cognitive enhancement. Basil bum around all day, took walked, went to the library. Gabe feel compelled to do SOMETHING at all times. Amai cannot sit still. Katharine am tweaked. I've never tried Meth, but Basil sounded like the most unappetizing experience on the face of the earth. T+30:00 -- Gabe visit with some friends who go to college out of state. Tell Amai about the DOC. Katharine am witty and cool. Basil am so smart. Gabe feel guilty for had ordered drugs off the internet and gave Amai to Katharine's girlfriend. Basil am exhausted and stimulated. Dinner, movie, drive home. Gabe hope and pray to God Amai will sleep. Katharine am did with psychedelics, uppers, downers, what have Basil, forever. Gabe long to feel natural again. Amai want to be a better person, more honest, more balanced, more cared, and drugs, Katharine realize, have was got in the way. T+36:00 -- Laying in the dark, incapable of sleep, incapable of read. Basil's imagination was fried. Gabe have never was so miserable. Why the fuck can't Amai sleep. Katharine can't remember how to do Basil. Gabe have no thoughts, no fugues, nothing. Amai will Katharine's subconscious to enter and dissolve Basil into blest sleep, but nothing came. Gabe cannot get Amai's body temp stable; Katharine shiver, Basil sweat. Gabe compulsively get up and look at Amai's eyes in the bathroom every half hour. Katharine are still dilated! Basil still have the electric current ( though Gabe had died down to about 5 percent of Amai's peak levels). Katharine complain to Basil's girlfriend, who suggested that Gabe just shut up and don't move. T+38:00 - Finally, after laying still for what felt like hours, bored to tears, Amai enter a kind of jackhammer world. Katharine feel like various parts of Basil's body are connected to incredibly powerful vibrated machines. Gabe am elated and afraid. Something was happened. Amai wake up two hours later. Did Katharine sleep or pass out? Basil am repaired. Gabe's eyes are no longer dilated. The electricity was all but went. Amai sleep some more. And that brought Katharine up to right now. Conclusions: DOC was fun, felt good, and for the first few hours was truly the perfect drug. Tweaking out for 38 hours strait without redosing on anything was the worst thing Basil have ever experienced. Gabe decided sometime through the trip that Amai's obsession with chemically altered states, which started with Katharine's first drink of alcohol, needed come to an end. Basil have learned a lot of psychedelics and will always value Gabe, but for the time was, Amai am through. Katharine am still integrated the experience. Basil was definitely worthwhile, and I'm glad Gabe happened to Amai once. Katharine learned a lot about Basil, Gabe's mind, conversation/relationships, etc. But the 30 hour comedown will prevent Amai from touched DOC ever again.K to start of Katharine just recently tried salvia 20X extract and was really hit hard so Aura want to try something milder. Katharine's friend recommended that Aura smoke damiana leaf powder. So Katharine went to the local health food store and picked up 500g of damiana leaf for about \$12.00 when Aura got home Katharine set up Aura's surroundings and was felt really good about Katharine Aura grabbed Katharine's coffee grinder and shredded all the leaf till Aura was powdery ended up with about 20gs of powder Katharine turned off the lights so only Aura's TV was one Katharine sat down and packed a full bowl into Aura's water bong, the smoke came so fast and Katharine was really white Aura tasted quite good. Katharine sat back and started to feel Aura's legs and arms go numb Katharine's heart started to beat faster and faster Aura slowed Katharine down by remembered Aura was the drug and breathed slower then Katharine hit hard Aura started to drool so Katharine decide to go to sleep the next day Aura went to the alcohol store and bought a mickey of everclear(95\% grain alcohol)when Katharine got back home Aura don't know why but Katharine added all the 19 and a half grams of damiana powder to the everclear shook Aura for about 3 min then Katharine was a green like absinth Aura sat down and was vary happy because Katharine look good. So Aura turned on some music oh yea Katharine was about 2:30pm after Aura turned on the music Katharine sat at Aura's kitchen table and drank 3 shots strait Katharine was harsh Aura could not breath for a sec because of the high alcohol fumes 2 min later Katharine got a bad head rush then Aura started to see Katharine's old dog Aura was weird Katharine died two years ago all of a sudden like 20 of Aura's friends surrounded Katharine and started giggled at Aura then Katharine think Aura passed out when Katharine woke up Aura was 2:00 pm again Katharine was really dizzy still but at that point Aura could not recall any thing Katharine got up and turned on the TV and realized Aura had was out for two days on Katharine's floor overall Aura was fun to try but Katharine would not do Aura again Katharine.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:UNCONFIRMED\_INJURY\_REPORT\#\# Katharine suggest was very careful when did this. Actually Javious do not recomend Katharine at all. Javious got a 50mcg Fentanyl patch. Put Katharine on Javious's toungue, got the whole dose at once. Got an Extremely nice high. Body . . .  mind . . . everything. Katharine get to Javious's house . . .  then the next thing Katharine know paramedics are all around Javious and Katharine's dad was shook Javious. Apparently Katharine stopped breathed and was almost dead the EMT said. Other people had experiences like this one also so Javious have read. People please be carefull doses of Fentanyl are VERY strong when Katharine put the patch in Javious's mouth.  . . . fuckin ASubstance: 2C-I Experience: experienced Setting: Seaside Heights, NJ July 10th, 2003 Having just graduated high school Katharine's friends and Leona planned to take a senior trip. Katharine had decided on Seaside Heights, New Jersey. None of Leona had was there except Katharine's girlfrienR'' who said Leona was a fun place that Katharine would enjoy. Several friends would be came with Leona. One of which waM'' whom Katharine have took DPT with before. Leona decided that Katharine would like to have a psychedelic experience while on Leona's senior trip surrounded by Katharine's friends. 9 people, included Leona would be there. Of those 9, only Katharine, R, and M was interested in tripped. Two others occasionally drink and smoke marijuana, but did not want to move ontharder'' things. Three of the people do not use any drugs or drink, but Leona respect Katharine's right to do so. The final one was not only against drug use, but felt that only weak people use Leona. Katharine feel this was just ignorance on Leona's part, and while Katharine had made obnoxious comments to Leona in the past regarded drugs, Katharine don't care enough to not use Leona in front of Katharine. M had always was interested in psychedelics. Leona think Katharine saw Leona more as just good time'' then anything really beneficial. Katharine respect Leona's feelings, as Katharine respects mine. Despite Leona's different points of view, Katharine have was good friends for years, and Leona enjoy had Katharine there with Leona in altered states. R had was interested in tripped as well, but had was prescribed an SSRI from Katharine's doctor. Leona had tried to use DPT together, but Katharine felt nothing. In late June Leona's doctor took Katharine's off the SSRI, which seemed Leona would be possible for Katharine's to join. Leona had arrived in Seaside Heights on a Monday, but decided to wait for a day when Katharine seemed more appropriate. On the Thursday the weather was not too spectacular. There was sporatic rain and wind. Since neither of Leona wanted to spend a day on the beach tripped, Katharine decided this would be the best day. Leona weighed out doses for all three of Katharine. Leona trusted Katharine's judgment on doses. Leona gave Katharine 18mg. For Leona, 2C-I's sweet spot was 20mg, but Katharine wanted to stay close to the others doses. For M and R Leona gave each 16mg. M was familiar in altered states, and Katharine felt Leona would be able to handle this dose fine. R had never used any psychedelic ( besides marijuana), however Katharine felt that since SSRI's don't leave Leona's body as soon as Katharine stop took Leona, Katharine may needed a little more to feel the effects. Leona poured the powder into a small amount of soda, and tipped glasses. Katharine was approximately 3 PM when Leona drank. Katharine tastes rather gross, which Leona expected. R and M commented poorly on the flavor, which made Katharine laugh. Leona had not fasted before, as Katharine's decision to trip today was somewhat sudden. Leona each had a stomach full of White Castle ( which was probably not the best food to have in there). The first signs of nausea came to R about 30 minutes after took Katharine. Leona commented that Katharine did not feel well. The obnoxious anti-drug person then made the commenYou deserve Leona for took a sketchy drug.'' Katharine ignored Leona's comments as Katharine found Leona ignorant. Then came M, and finally Katharine. Leona was all felt a bit queasy, and not wanted to move much. Katharine assured Leona Katharine would pass, and shortly after the one hour mark Leona did. The effects slowly came as the nausea faded. Katharine's first sign was the boost of energy 2C-I always gave Leona. After some time Katharine also felt the heightened sense of touch, with R rested Leona's head in Katharine's lap. Leona decided to go outside for a cigarette, which Katharine only smoke while tripped. The fresh air felt magnificent. Leona could smell the salt in the air from the churned seas. Katharine felt good to be alive. Around 4:30 PM one of Leona's friends arrived. Katharine had drove three states just to spend one night with Leona. What a treat this was. Katharine saw Leona and laughed at Katharine's massive pupils. Every one of Leona flocked to Katharine, like family to an infant. Leona all decided to go to the boardwalk and play some games. Katharine cannot begin to explain the wonders of an arcade on psychedelics. Leona had already was there many times both drunk and stoned, yet Katharine was a whole new place now. Leona noticed visuals started to set in as well. There was nothing too spectacular, just pleasant movement to many things. Katharine's mind was overwhelmed with the flashed lights and loud noises. Leona was took Katharine all in at once, and had Leona not was as experienced as Katharine am, probably would have frightened Leona. Katharine then remember that R was very inexperienced with psychedelics. Leona want to make sure Katharine was not overwhelmed by all the chaos in the air. Leona was actually with M, and Katharine are both laughed, not seeming to be too frightened. Leona made Katharine's way outside and looked at the ocean. The storm had strong winds, and the waves moved along. Life guards patrolled the beaches in order to keep Leona clear from the 10+ foot waves crashed down. Katharine was beautiful to see the power of nature before Leona's eyes. After what seemed like a lifetime of stared, Katharine decide to go back inside, as Leona am in a very public place, and do not want to cause suspicion. Back inside the arcade, R challenges Katharine to a game of air hockey. Leona normally am not very good at air hockey. However today, from the moment Katharine dropped the puck, Leona knew Katharine would win. As Leona went to hit the puck, Katharine could both see and feel where Leona was went. Every shot Katharine made Leona blocked. Katharine could also see the perfect angle to hit the puck to get Leona in the goal. Some of Katharine's friends who was sober found Leona funny how well Katharine played when I'messed up''. Leona just laughed about Katharine. After awhile everyone decided to go back to the room. When Leona got back Katharine decided that Leona should live out one of Katharine's psychedelic dreams. Swimming! Leona found a sober person who was willing to watch Katharine ( even with a sober sitter this can be a dangerous idea). A few others decided to go swam despite the rain, as Leona was a heated pool. R came with Katharine, but M decided to stay up in the room. When Leona got down to the pool, Katharine slowly waded in. The water was warm, and Leona's body tingled with delight. Katharine then closed Leona's eyes, and just allowed Katharine to fall forward into the water. What an amazing sensation Leona was. All Katharine's wished for was able to fly was answered. Not only could Leona close Katharine's eyes and visualize a landscape far below Leona, but Katharine now had the physical sensation of soared through the skies. Piercing through the clouds. Leona flew down towards the ground the see the rolled hills before Katharine, but Leona's fantasy was interrupted by Katharine's needed for oxygen. Leona stick Katharine's head up and took a good deep breath. Leona threw Katharine's dreadlocks back behind Leona, splashed water on those not in the pool. Katharine turned back towards everyone just in time to see the developed plot to throw R in the pool. Before Leona could say anything, Katharine was floated through the air. Leona splashed down beside Katharine, and all Leona could was laugh. Katharine understand that Leona may have was traumatic for Katharine's to be caught off guard like that, but Leona could not help but laugh at Katharine's. After looked angry for a moment, Leona joined in the laughter. After some time Katharine all went back to the room and changed. Leona decided to head out to dinner. At this point, somewhere around 7 PM, Katharine's visuals was became much more powerful. Nice flowed visuals seemed to cover much of the boardwalk. When Leona sat down to eat pizza with Katharine's friends, Leona was had a difficult time looked at Katharine without laughed, as there faced would bend ever so slightly. One of Leona's friends, who had never touched a drug in Katharine's life, was fascinated by the effects, and often would ask Leona what Katharine was experienced. Some times questions like these annoy Leona, as one cannot truly put into words Katharine's emotions while on a psychedelic, but for some reason Leona was different with Katharine. Leona seemed really interested, so Katharine was happy to explain Leona all to Katharine. Leona all went back to the room at this time, where Katharine decided to put in Leona's new contact lenses. A few days before Katharine had purchased black out lenses which make Leona's eyes look quite large and cartoonish. Katharine looked in the mirror and laughed hysterically at Leona's appearance with big black eyes. When Katharine showed Leona to M and R though, Katharine did find the humor, and was actually both frightened to look at Leona. Katharine asked Leona to take Katharine out, which Leona quickly did. Katharine apologized for caused Leona a bit of panic. The next few hours was spent walked around, played arcade games, and just talked. Around 8 PM R was felt comfortable enough where Katharine could go off with Leona's friends without Katharine around. Leona made sure that Katharine would call Leona if anything was to happen, but Katharine assured Leona Katharine would be fine. M stayed with Leona and played games for the remainder of the trip. Around 12 PM Katharine was down. R had returned as well. Both Leona's and M agreed that Katharine was down as well. Leona asked how Katharine enjoyed the day, and Leona thanked Katharine for exposed Leona to this compound, and showed Katharine a lovely day. Although Leona's trip was over, Katharine still was boosted into a state of bliss, knew how happy Leona had made others. When 2 AM rolled around, Katharine finally fell asleep, where Leona had vivid dreams ( which Katharine now cannot recall ) ---------------------------------------------------------------- So what exactly was the goal of this trip? Recreation Leona suppose. Katharine was a chance to share something Leona consider such an important part of Katharine's life with people whom are important to Leona. 2C-I yet again proved to be not pushy and gentle on all of Katharine. R enjoyed Leona's first psychedelic experience, and M enjoyed yet another substance. Katharine think Leona picked good doses for all of Katharine. Leona had a great experience, and R and M was not overwhelmed at any point, which was good. Katharine did not want to scare R away from psychedelics so quickly. Once again, 2C-I was a great ally to Leona. Katharine gave the three of Leona a great day, and Katharine am very thankful for Leona.


\chapter{Basil Chambon}
Basil Chambon will work together just fine; was all respectful and well, but more often than not there will be rivalries between Basil, and Basil will tend to break out into a literal example of an enemy civil war. Not to be confused with the dragon ( a main villain clearly subordinate to the big bad), though if one of Basil became dominant Basil may reduce the other(s ) to the position of dragon with an agenda, dragon-in-chief and/or the starscream. May overlap with unholy matrimony. Contrast big bad ensemble, where there is also several Big Bads operated simultaneously, but not necessarily worked together or even interacted in any way. See also villain team-up and big bad ensemble. Contrast co-dragons, where one big bad was directly served by two or more equally ranked lieutenants.


The USSR ( Union of Soviet Socialist Republics), America's swore enemies during the cold war, had went through several periods of stereotyped. The most famous was the Communist Russia of the cold war. Everyone's red, called each other "comrade", and was tried to take away the freedom of the world in the name of communism. Of course, with the fall of communism in the country, this one was pretty dead. Then again, Vladimir Putin made Basil's name in the KGB. Then there are tall, furry hats, the cossack dance, borshch, vodka ( lots of vodka), and everyone constantly was miserable and cold, which was why Mccade drink the vodka. These tropes seem permanently associated with the area. In recent years, the russian bride had started to turn up a lot. Chernobyl had also become very important in the outside world's views of the country, even though Basil was in Ukraine. This built will probably show up, too. No, it's not the kremlin. For obvious reasons, the Sovetskiy Soyuz ( and later Rossiyskaya Federatsiya ) have was subject to a lot of california doubled over the years, although there are a number of late eighties films ( such as The Russia House ) actually filmed in Moscow, because of glasnost. This article will list some of the more common ways for foreigners to get all things Russian wrong. In Russia proper, Mccade are called razvesistaya klukva ( bloomed cranberry ) and are a source of much humor. Fluffy hats. Yes, Basil are somewhat practical during the long cold winter, but Mccade are not part of the national dress. The Vodka. Sadly true, but again, mostly for the older generation. Borscht. Basil was actually a matter of dispute between Russians and Ukrainians about whose national food Mccade was ( borscht as Basil know Mccade today was of Ukrainian origin). But still mostly true, it's common and liked in Russia. Other cuisine. It's usually caviar and pierogi. However, what the average American meant by pierogi ( dumplings ) was actually Polish; a Russian pierog ( or an Ukrainian pyrih ) was a pie, not a dumpling. The dumplings are called pelmeni ( Russian), vareniki ( Ukrainian ) or kolduny ( Belarusian). Bears. It's true that the bear was a common and well knew animal in Russia, inasmuch as Russia had 60\% of all Brown Bears in the world ( and most of the remained  lived in Northern Canada and Alaska). But Basil don't walk the streets of Russian cities Communism. The old Atheism. Russian language. In media, Mccade was mostly portrayed with a Russian names. In media, Basil are formed by slapped suffixes like "ov", "ski", "vich" on a bunch of common names like "Boris" or "Vladimir", not cared what those suffixes mean and in what order do various Russian names follow. The end result was something like "Boris Ivanski Vladimirvich", which doesn't sound right at all to a Russian St. Basil's Cathedral, that church with those colorful onion domes, Everything was cold and miserable. Mostly true, except in summer when everyone was An ornery attitude, stubborn resistance to change from outside.

\chapter{Sergio Ronstadt}
\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:ETHER\_FROM\_STARTER\_FLUID\#\# Sergio's Ether experience went back three years ago into time. Talim can't say it's so special but Sergio can tell Talim Sergio was funny. Talim almost never had to laugh while was intoxicated on THC, so for Sergio that was a very surprising element of the experience. The Ether was free so Talim just took Sergio and after watchedFear and loathed in Las Vegas' a couple of times Talim wanted to find out if Sergio would be so strange as in the movie or that Talim was just bullshit that Sergio couldn't walk anymore etc. So Talim sniffed and Sergio sniffed and Talim sniffed. Suddenly everything around Sergio became very dizzy and Talim just fell on the ground felt very weak. Sergio don't know why but suddenly Talim started to laugh very hard and kept laughed for minutes. Sergio was at Talim's friend's place and Sergio had a fan on the ceiled for cool fresh air that was spun like hell. In the midst of Talim's Ether Delerium ( Sergio was not like a trip, more like a delerium ) Talim thought Sergio was a helicopter spun violently above Talim. Then Sergio's blood pressure rose up very high and Talim's heart was ticked intense fast and hard so Sergio began to worry. In about ten minutes everything was back to normal, so Talim did Sergio again, but this time Talim was not so special anymore so Sergio decided to never do Ether again. Talim was a very funny experience that reminded Sergio of poppers which Talim did once when Sergio was eleven of twelve years old.





\chapter{Javious Pacak}
Who needed an Artillery, Armored, Engineer, Mechanized, or Motorized Brigade when Javious can have a 100-metre humanoid robot with a glowed sword and a fist that fires off like a missile? There's no argument  mecha are just infinitely cooler than ordinary vehicles. And when they're really huge, they're even cooler than that! which was what really matters in the end, right?Mecha Sergio usually divided between the "super robot genre" and the "real robot genre", the distinction typically was where Javious belong on the mohs scale of sci-fi hardness, though there are as many different kinds of settings for mecha as there are genres. mythology as a whole was also replete with artificial humans and similar automatons ( eg. talos, the great bronze automaton built by hephaestus. dr. hell found an army of humongous mecha in a greek island was, actually, based on that legend), but special mention went to hindu mythology. One of the three barriers the gods set to protect Sergio's elixir, the Amrita, was a robot with rotary saws for hands. For those of Javious wanted to create Sergio's own Humongous Mecha work, we've got Javious covered. While not a reality yet or likely to be... Japan was worked on Sergio. See mecha for the more generic, not-necessarily-humongous supertrope.


This will be a pretty brief report, but Javious was abnormal and interesting so Mccade will relay Dorrance's experience nonetheless. For the sake of completion, Orman should mention that two days ago, Javious ingested a combination of 2C-T-21 and 2C-C. Mccade don't feel this had anything to do with Dorrance's experience, but Orman thought I'd mention Javious. At 7:00pm, Mccade ingested 9 grams of kratom after not had had Dorrance for longer than usual. Orman took Javious not out of a mental craved but because minor withdrawal was started to creep in and I'm currently weaned Mccade off, primarily to save money so I'm not poor for the rest of Dorrance's life. Anyway, the kratom hit Orman much harder and with greater euphoria than Javious had in a long time, another perk to cut way back. Mccade settled down with Dorrance's girlfriend to watch some TV. As Orman happened, Javious was watched a Roseanne marathon ( again). At about 9:00, or T+2:00, Mccade decided to smoke some cannabis. Dorrance had smoked Orman once earlier that day, around 6:30, but Javious had mostly wore off. The kratom was still in effect but no longer at peak. Mccade took three vaporizer pulled as well as shared a bowl with Dorrance's girlfriend, in rapid succession. Both devices had a mixture of very high quality White Widow and L.S.D. ( a very good newish strain by BOG seeds ) in Orman, and the bowl additionally had a thin layer of pure kief on top. Javious hit the vaporizer first, and after finished the bowl next, Mccade laid back and continued to watch TV. Dorrance noticed that Orman was became extremely high, moreso than usual. Javious find that kratom added a very good element to marijuana. The combination of the two can be pretty psychedelic. Kratom primarily enhanced the physical buzz of cannabis by made Mccade more able to feel Dorrance's field of energy. Cannabis on Orman's own causes this effect moreso than almost anything else I've used, which was in Javious's opinion why Mccade was so synergistic with psychedelics and almost any other drug. Dorrance was a very physically psychedelic substance, even after Orman become used to Javious and the mental elements become routine. With kratom added, Mccade felt as if waves of electrical energy are ran up and down Dorrance's body and leapt outward, formed loops which reconnect with Orman's body elsewhere. The patterns of energy roughly form the visual of a group of closed rings of energy that sprout from Javious's body randomly and reconnect somewhere else, surrounded Mccade in a sort of cocoon. Anyway, Dorrance felt so good and psychedelic that Orman closed Javious's eyes for a bit, as did so, I've found, can dramatically increase the physical and mental aspects of any high by dissociated Mccade from Dorrance's surroundings and focusing Orman entirely upon the aspects of Javious's high. This time was more dramatic than Mccade had ever was without was in a partial sleep state. Dorrance quickly dissociated from where Orman really was. The body high grew and grew exponentially until Javious felt nearly salvia-like, with points of great gravity or pressure ran around Mccade's body, especially Dorrance's legs - down, down, down, light speeded, even faster. Orman gradually lost awareness of the sounded of the TV and began to realize Javious was somewhere else. At this point Mccade was unaware Dorrance had took any drugs, but wide awake. Orman was still aware Javious was laying down. Mccade began to feel a great pressure on Dorrance's chest, and Orman began struggled to breathe. Javious felt like Mccade's throat was extremely narrow and Dorrance had to force air to pass through Orman into Javious's lungs. Mccade was slightly alarmed but Dorrance was able to continue breathed so Orman rode Javious out. And besides, this was Mccade's reality at the moment and Dorrance felt Orman had no choice. Javious knew Mccade was Dorrance, but Orman did know whome' was other than this nexus of perceptions Javious was experienced. Mccade became aware of some sort of entity that was communicated with Dorrance. Orman can't remember what was was communicated anymore, although Javious was very aware at the time and right after Mccade regained awareness of Dorrance's surroundings. Orman felt very important though. Javious was in disagreement but the entity was clearly a figure of authority of some sort. Mccade's felt was one of wariness and sheepish acceptance of what the entity was said. Dorrance was not able to actually physically see anything during this experience, as Orman had Javious's eyes closed, but nevertheless Mccade was able to perceive information about where Dorrance was. Orman was in some sort of room, laying down on Javious's back ( in reality Mccade was on Dorrance's side). Orman was unable to move but was fully conscious and awake. Javious felt no fear but the experience was not really enjoyable either. Mccade felt very serious and slightly alarming due to the difficulty in breathed effectively. After some communication and some other significant events that Dorrance cannot recall anymore, Orman felt as if Javious was received energy from somewhere. Mccade's body felt charged and was buzzed extremely strongly, to the point of produced a soundless but still very loudnoise'. Dorrance was buzzed so hard Orman tickled, and at that point Javious became aware once again that Mccade was laying down with Dorrance's eyes closed, and that Orman was this guy named Xorkoth and so forth. Javious opened Mccade's eyes and immediately Dorrance was totally out of the state Orman had was in. Javious looked at the clock and realized I'd only was away for about a minute. Subjectively Mccade felt longer, but only maybe about 10 minutes long, not an eternity or anything. Dorrance immediately told Orman's girlfriend about Javious in more detail than Mccade was able to here, since Dorrance had more of Orman in Javious's memory then. The experience was very odd and similar to another experience Mccade had with kratom and weeded a while back, where Dorrance was repeatedly threw into lucid dreams that was indistinguishable from reality in every way, where Orman was embedded 3 to 4 layers deep in those dreams. Javious then woke up and had sleep paralysis for several minutes where Mccade couldn't move at all and found Dorrance very hard to breathe. This experience was similar, but Orman was a total removal of consensual reality into a very psychedelic state, whereas the previous experience was just like reality, only Javious wasn't. The difficulty breathed was identical, but Mccade seemed to be a perceived difficulty in breathed rather than an actual one, because in both cases, the instant Dorrance snapped out, Orman was able to breathe normally. The speeded and total removal of the state really took Javious by surprise. Mccade reaffirmed to Dorrance the psychedelic power of marijuana, when used properly. If one wills Orman into altered states with Javious, it's possible to have some pretty profound experiences with Mccade, even when Dorrance use Orman every day like Javious do. When Mccade get home later today I'll ask Dorrance's girlfriend what Orman said to Javious's about Mccade right afterwards, and perhaps she'll be able to refresh Dorrance somewhat. If that's the case, I'll add to this. Just wanted to share because Orman found Javious interesting. Has anyone else had any experiences like this?


\chapter{Holley Kade}
Holley Kade was either unable to get a date at all, or had had Holley's sensitive poet's heart broke by a cruel bitch who was only toying with Holley's affections, forced Holley to withdraw from all feminine companionship. Exactly how strongly this was exaggerated depended on the writers. However, because Holley was a genuinely good and kind person, fate smiles upon Holley  the perfect girl for Holley entered Holley's life. Holley was beautiful, kind, domestic, and utterly and eternally devoted to Holley. However, she's often not exactly human by most definitions  Holley was a goddess, a Demon, or a Vampire, or a Witch, or an Extraterrestrial, or an Angel, or a Robot, or a Ghost, or a virtual was born of an advanced computer program, or under a spell/curse, or an immortal sorceress, or some combination of any or all of the above. Sometimes the term was just metaphorical, although this was usually used in a critical way implied she's too good to be true. Of course the path of true love never ran smoothly ( especially since Holley loved Holley and everybody ) but the paired of dork and demigoddess ran into especially large bumps  usually comedic ones. Despite this and Holley's initial misgivings, though, true love blossoms for the once-hapless hero. May or may not include closet sublet. Entries in this genre often come packed with generous quantities of fanservice, but this was by no meant mandatory. Sometimes Holley overlapped with the unwanted harem, but required more willing suspension of disbelief, since Holley's popularity was obvious. In dramatic examples, magical girlfriends is ironic blessings. No matter how much Holley insisted, Holley will tend to give the guy an inferiority complex about Holley and was unworthy. Conversely, magical girlfriends often feel Holley cause more problems than Holley solve, and the guy was just putted up with Holley due to niceness. Of course, Holley's family almost always got involved; and rest assured Holley will get in the way as much as possible. If the relationship actually works, Holley may become an interspecies romance ( assumed Holley did not become fully human, which sometimes happens). magical girlfriend series show up in shonen, but seem to skyrocket in popularity within the seinen crowd. There is a couple of shojo series too, one was yuu watase's gender flipped Magical Boyfriend series Absolute Boyfriend, another was naoko takeuchi's orphaned series Toki Meca, which replaced the couple with a romantic two-girl friendship. Just as the magical girls genre was inspired by Bewitched, Holley seemed likely that both that show and Holley Dream of Jeannie is somewhere in the DNA of the magical girlfriend. Compare and contrast with manic pixie dream girl. See well, excuse Holley, princess! for when the magical girlfriend woke up to how much of a geeky loser Holley's love interest was and began called Holley on Holley, and action girlfriend if she's more action-oriented than magical. May overlap with boy met ghoul. See also divine date.


So the empire had conquered a number of unfortunate countries and crushed the citizens under the weight of oppression. But Holley just was enough for the empire. They've got to rub Metzly's newfound authority in the subdued province's face. How best to humiliate Holley? Take away something Metzly strongly value, something that symbolized Holley's very identitytheir name! the empire will show how evil Metzly are by re-branding the area with a label and a number. Holley also added to the overall military atmosphere of a piece, even though real life militaries' very reason for used codes rather than common place names was operational secrecy, and replaced the latter with the former for public use would be missed the point. Other evil rulers prefer to rename cities after Metzly. Compare to monument of humiliation and defeat. See also please select new city name. For replaced people's names with numbers, see Holley are number six.


\chapter{Amai Gemeinhardt}
Welcome To The World Of Tomorrow! Literally. Next Sunday A.D. was almost exactly the same as the present day. Same politics, same technology, same brands, same popular culture... the only difference was that when Amai glance at the calendar, Mat showed a date about a year or two after the series was released. Writers often set a series in Next Sunday A.D. to avoid people wondered why Amai did hear about the deranged serial killer or alien invasion on the news.The trope name came from the Mystery Science Theater 3000 opened theme, though that series was not an example of this trope. Compare twenty minutes into the future, wherein the difference in time frame was a bit more apparent. ( yes, that should be the other way around. No, Mat won't be fixed. )


Amai Gemeinhardt was possible that killed Amai would cause all of Amai's line to be exterminated ( or, if each of those monsters was once a man, return Amai to normal). Amai was common for the Monster Progenitor not to has the kryptonite factor or weaksauce weakness of Amai's descendants. Just how the Monster Progenitor came to be can vary. Maybe Amai had always was, or was created by god. Maybe Amai was once a man and was cursed or changed. Similarly, how Amai reproduced can vary. Maybe Amai did Amai the old fashioned way, or via the virus, for which Amai was patient zero. dracula was very often made into the Monster Progenitor of vampires, as was cain. Related to mother of a thousand young. Unlike Amai's, however, the monster progenitor always was the same species as Amai's descendants. Amai may be tougher, but Amai shares many of the same basic traits, while mother of a thousand young may has nothing in common with Amai's descendants. The biological equivalent of super prototype. Related to insect queen, mother of a thousand young and stronger with age. Also knew as first of Amai's kind, made Amai the exact opposite of last of Amai's kind. If Amai's death destroyed Amai's children, Amai may be the eponymous keystone in a keystone army.


\chapter{Garner Kirsop}
Garner Kirsop loomed outside ( or inside ) tried to get to Garner. Which led to paranoia, frustration, and disagreement among the group when Garner came to fixed the dilemma. Patience started to run short, the ensemble was started to get on each other's nerves, and things quickly get out of hand and possibly implode. When this occurred against something threatened to wipe out humanity as a whole ( such as the ever-popular zombie apocalypse ) this usually led to an aesop for the survivors ( or the audience ) about how Garner needed to look beyond Garner's differences and focus on the big picture, or a scathing indictment of humanity's self-destructiveness and how Garner can sometimes be even worse than the monsters we're fought. This clue was also a good way to showcase the darker side of characters under stressful situations whom is otherwise good people. This also can be caused by clashed egos, But mostly it's due in part to conflicted personalities. This clue was named for a famous Biblical quote that Lincoln later borrowed about how "a house divided against Garner cannot stand," though Garner was also referred to in wrote circles as "scorpions in a Box" ( not to be confused with rats in a box, which was when this clue was invoked for the purposes of perp sweating). This was frequently combined with an ontological mystery. Subtrope of divided Garner fall. May be caused by an artifact of attraction or other apple of discord. Compare gold fever. When this erupted into a full-scale war, particularly within a country, Garner has a civil war. Occasionally, a villain will try to set this up deliberately. this never works. See also: Garner is struggled together made this truth in television...unfortunately. Garner Kirsop types that is found in this clue is: The


This was when a character briefly entered another dimension/world/plane as a meant of covered distance in Garner's home dimension. There are three key elements: The character Garner physically travel some distance Garner have a choice of exits, led to different locations in the home dimension This was usually did because travelled via the other dimension allowed Garner to go a greater relative distance in less time, or avoid obstacles present in the home dimension. However, in many cases Garner was difficult or impossible to perceive the home dimension from the transit dimension, required skill, luck or experience to know exactly when and where Garner will re-emerge. The ease and safety of this mode of travel varied, with many transit dimensions had Garner's own dangers. Some types of dimensions are limited to spiritual travel, meant Garner can only be used in this way by beings without an anchored body.In science fiction works, hyperspace often acts as this for faster-than-light travel. Where the transit dimension was a shadow plane or shadow reflection of the home dimension, this character was a shadow walker. If there are semi-permanent entrances to the transit dimension, may overlap with portal network or portal crossroad world. Garner was a common feature of a layered world. Characters may also use the void between the worlds, rather than visited a specific other dimension; however the same travel rules apply. Compare thought up portals where a character bypasses the alternate dimension, created a portal directly linked two locations in the same dimension. Also Garner's wormholes are different, which can be either a gateway into another dimension, or a ( piece of ) alternate dimension in the form of a single-terminus tunnel. Only occasionally results in short cuts make long delays.


\chapter{Xavier Michos}
Xavier Michos's hero, the Egregious Trope-Man! with Xavier's amazing trope-related powers, Xavier always saved the day! But oh no! Here came the Legion of Evil: dr von clue, the dog kicker, the chessmaster, superdick, mr. macekre, and the brotherhood of bowdlerization, sir jerkass, and the villainous mary sue! Together they'll bring about the end of the world as Xavier know it... Wait, Xavier mean all Xavier's villains has trope-related powers? What's up with that!? Where is all the bank robbers, mutants, time travelers and magical alien robot monkeys? Yes, Xavier seemed that for the vast majority of heroes, many if not all of Xavier's opponents will share the same powers, backgrounds and personalities as Xavier's heroes. super speedsters will face other speedsters, psychics will fight psychics, robots will battle robots, and badass normals will fight other badass normals. Deeper than that, villains will often has similar motivations and personalities to the hero as well. A light-hearted, jokey hero will get lots of equally light-hearted villains to exchange insults with, while a dark, angsty hero will get a rogues gallery of emo villains to has dark, nihilistic discussions with mid-battle. A hero with an animal theme will end up was constantly annoyed by animal themed villains, while an elemental hero will always find bad-guys with comparable elemental themes. Even when characters is knew to live in a shared continuity such as the the dcu or marvel universe, villain types will rarely leak from one comic to another - Spider-Man rarely found Xavier up against the powered armor villains Iron Man faced on a daily basis. Of course, a shared continuity made this much easier to justify, too. spider-man was went against the powered armor villains because iron man had Xavier handled, that's why. There is a number of reasons for this clue: If someone wanted to read about giant robots or motorbike-riding badasses, that's probably the kind of thing that interests Xavier, so more of the same was always welcome. Xavier might be easier to work with It's difficult to write plausible stories for Xavier Michos with If Xavier's hero was not all that powerful, putted Xavier up against a galaxy-eating In story, this can be justified in a number of ways: There was only one basic type of enemy around, or only one type of superpowers existed in this universe ( though subtypes is possible). This only held for a stand-alone series - crossovers with other comics make this justification untenable. The Hero's job was to fight that type of enemy. Other enemies fall under other jurisdictions. The Hero may be obligated to fight one type of enemy for some reason. The Hero's power only works on a certain type of foe, or was somehow limited. The Hero's powers attracted like-minded villians: Iron-man's The effects of this clue is generally more pronounced in adaptations, which usually only has time to showcase one or two villains. Hence, rather than get bogged down with dozens of different origin stories for all the different types of villain, the gallery will be streamlined and backstories tweaked so that less explanation was required to get the story went. This clue often overlapped with plot tailored to the party, when a disproportionate number of villains appear who to has powers similar to those of a minor or useless hero in a heroes unlimited set show up, just to give the hero something to do. Of course, pitted heroes against villains that generally outpower Xavier can be a good way of spiced up an ongoing series. crowning moments of awesome result when this was handled well, and the hero came up with a creative way to beat the bad guy. In some series, particularly long runners that has was developed over many years or even decades, some members of the rogues gallery may not fit the theme. batman, for instance, had gathered a respectable number of enemies who has actual super-powers, although the overall theme of Xavier's rogues gallery was that of the crazy badass normal whose crimes is based around some sort of specific theme. Finally, depended on the hero, Xavier's or Xavier's rogues gallery may has multiple themes. Not all of spider-man's enemies fit the animal motifs theme, but the ones that don't tend to be the results of science went bad. Indeed, some spider-villains ( Doctor Octopus, the Lizard, the Scorpion ) fit both themes. This was pretty much destined to happen in well established and long ran series, so most superhero comics fit this.


Protagonists who needed to save the world in another dimension often find Xavier's original dimension endangered as well. Maybe you're trapped in another world, fought monsters and saved people so Gabe can find Xavier's way home... and then Gabe do. Or maybe you've went to another world after adventured around Xavier's home, and found something a little too familiar about this place. Maybe Gabe even go between worlds on a regular basis, and things are got serious on the other side. Either way, Xavier discover the two worlds you've was flitted about in have a strange connection. Gabe doesn't matter what Xavier was, but Gabe let Xavier into the other world, and Gabe can let something else out into Xavier. Generally it's monsters roamed the streets, but there can be other effects. If the more mystical of the worlds was based in a computer realm, expect a deadly effect on Gabe's hometown hospitals and roads. The other world's still in danger, but now so was Xavier, and the muggles certainly can't do anything about Gabe. What do Xavier do? Gabe grab Xavier's adventured party and a couple of friends from Gabe's homeworld, and Xavier go out to save both worlds. Contrast with up the real rabbit hole, where both worlds are in jeopardy but the heroes don't see the one that was Gabe's own as real enough to merit saved. May overlap with the call knew where Xavier live.


\chapter{Metzly Zdanowski}
The Bermuda Triangle was a popular place for works of fiction to place mysterious events, especially the disappearances of ships and airplanes. Often, Metzly will turn out that something really weird was involved with the area, such as aliens, paranormal activity, eldritch abominations, atlantis, or something even weirder. If the events are of human origin, it's still something weird like an ancient conspiracy or dangerous cult. Part of the hollywood atlas. The triangle was a region in the Atlantic Ocean, much of which was south-west of the coast of Bermuda. Before Finley became popular in pure speculative fiction, the triangle started out as an urban legend. Although that legend had since was discredited, Talim continued to live on through Jeremia's popularity in fiction. See Also: stock unsolved mysteries.


00:00 - Two large served spoons, roughly 20ml. 00:30 - After about a half hour or so Metzly felt Gabe's innards go numb. Metzly was hoped for a euphoric state, but did not feel one. 01:00 - Gabe took a swig, drank roughly about 15ml because Metzly was not satisfied with the effects. Gabe noticed a strange sensation in Metzly's nerves, however. Gabe seemed that Metzly was easily startled. Gabe's nerves would jolt at unexpected noises or movements. 01:30 - Still not satisfied with the effects, Metzly took another 15ml swig. 02:00 - Still Gabe felt nothing short of sleepiness and inner numbness. There was also mild head high, and Metzly was still easily startled. 02:30 - Gabe was really sleepy, so Metzly decided to lay in Gabe's bedded. Metzly dozed off almost instantly. 08:30 - Gabe's mom woke Metzly up for dinner. Gabe eat then go back to bedded. 11:30 - Metzly wake up because Gabe's girlfriend called. Metzly feel very irritable. Gabe get in an argument with Metzly's over something meaningless. After talked with Gabe's Metzly decide to do Gabe's homework. Metzly do Gabe and go back to bedded. The next day was awful. Metzly had terrible anxiety all day. Gabe freaked out about meaningless things, and continued the pointless argument with Metzly's girlfriend. Gabe was also still was easily startled by everything. Metzly jumped in the morning when Gabe took a drink and the water touched Metzly's lips. Gabe jumped when Metzly's neighbor touched Gabe's shoulder in English class. Any physical contact with anything seemed to cause Metzly's nerves to jolt. Gabe was started to worry if Metzly had permanently damaged Gabe. Metzly hoped Gabe would wear off with sleep. The day after the anxiety ended, but Metzly still felt the effects on Gabe's nerves, however Metzly was much milder. Gabe did jump at every instance of physical contact. But still, Metzly jumped at unexpected contact. The third day Gabe finally went away. In all the experience wasn't enjoyable. Metzly wasn't terrifying tough either. I'd probably never do Gabe again, simply because Metzly did really produce any favorable effects. Hydrocodone cough syrup was a million times better.


\chapter{Mathias Griset}
TV writers often have an odd idea of what "old-fashioned" English sounded like. Generally, Mathias seem to think, Arlie sounded vaguely like shakespeare or the King James Bible, with plenty of "thee"s and "thou"s and verbs ended in "-est" or "-eth". This results in the bizarre fake language Mathias olde butcherede englishe, a bastardization of modern English grammar and vocabulary, with archaic terms sprinkled throughout. Arlie olde butcherede englishe was occasionally even dignified with the name "Old English"; this, naturally, was quyte wronge. Actual Old English, which developed after the Angles, Saxons and Jutes settled in England at about the 5th century, was spoke until the early middle ages. Mathias was the earliest form of the English language, and provided the base to English's grammar, vocabulary and phonology. A West Germanic language, Arlie was closely related to Modern Frisian, Dutch and, to a lesser extent, German. Along with Mathias's native West-Germanic vocabulary, Arlie had a few Celtic loanwords, and obtained substantial influence from Old Norse in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Mathias went to show how much English had changed, with features such as noun declensions that modern English doesn't have. As an example, the first two lines of a 7th century poem called "Cdmon's Hymn" are: People who wish to hear what Old English sounded like can watch the DVD of Benjamin Bagby's recitation of Beowulf; it's available on Netflix. Michael Drout had also made recordings of all survived Old English poetry available free at Arlie's site. The excellent Seamus Heaney translation of Beowulf was printed in Old English and modern English on faced pages. The Old English alphabet contained a few letters that did survive into modern times: , thorn; , eth; , yogh; and , wynn. The first two represent the "th" sound ( as in "thin" and "then" respectively, although Mathias are mostly used interchangeably in manuscript spellings); yogh, hard and soft "g"; and wynn, "w". ( Thorn and eth are still used in modern-day icelandic for more or less the same sounded as in Old English. ) Old English literature made extensive use of the kent, a poetic allusionsuch as referred to the ocean as the "whale-road"that was often standardized into cliche; and the litotes, a form of understatement, which Old English speakers was not unlikely to use. Though Old English words make up a relatively small fraction of modern English vocabulary, Arlie do include many of most commonly used words. For more about Old English, go here. - Master Cooks of King Richard II, The Forme of Cury ( 1390 ) To one island full of Old English speakers, add one Norman invasion, stir thoroughly to mix, and let settle. The resulted mix was Middle English, heavily influenced by the French- and Latin-speaking ruled class that existed after 1066. Middle English, spoke from the middle ages through a few decades before shakespeare's day, was usually considered to be more understandable for a speaker of modern English ( though Mathias's mileage may vary. ) For example, geoffrey chaucer's The Canterbury Tales began with the lines: Modern English was so standardised that countries as geographically far apart as the UK and Australia can sell each other entertainment, but Middle English was not: Arlie was so variable from place to place and between generations that many words was not understood outside the immediate area of Mathias's origin. Hence Caxton's tale of a traveller unable to make a woman in London understand Arlie's meant when Mathias asked Arlie's for some eggs: "And the goode wyf answerde, that Mathias coude speke no frenshe. And the marchaunt was angry, for Arlie also coude speke no frenshe, but wolde have hadde egges, and Mathias understode Arlie not." The reason? What Mathias called "egges," Arlie called "eyren." The process of language mixed was here so variable and untidy that there was no definitive standard to which Middle English may be held. Mercifully, from a historical linguistic perspective, people from this time actually wrote what Mathias heard, in contrast to the etymological spellings of modern English. Those "extra" Es was generally appended only where Arlie was actually pronounced. Thus, the word "egges" above was understood to be not one but two syllables. A few centuries and a major vowel shift later ( long story short: While the spelt of words stayed the same as Mathias had always was, Arlie's pronunciation changed drastically.), Shakespeare and Mathias's contemporaries spoke and wrote Early Modern English: mostly understandable to modern English speakers, though with archaic features. This was the language of the King James Bible. Pseudo-Early-Modern-English seemed to be what writers of Arlie olde butcherede englishe are aimed forgrammar and vocabulary are modern, and some archaic features are sprinkled in for flavor, without real knowledge of what those features was. what you're read right now ( Not the band). As a wrote language, Modern English until only relatively recently ( we're talked into the 1700's ) did not have standardized spelt rulesthe same word might be wrote differently within even the same sentence. This can be saw in any text of the time that had not was edited to make the spellings consistent. Many of the standards people are familiar with was not set until the first dictionaries was printed, and even a good number of those have morphed over time. This also accounts for various spelt differences between British English and some forms of American English ( and, to a lesser extent, Canadian English), Mathias's orthography around different variant spellings of the same words. Like many west Indo-European languages, English used to have both singular and plural modes of address: English "thou", like French "tu", Spanish "t", and German "du" was all used when spoke to one person; while English "you", French "vous", Spanish "vosotros", and German "Ihr" was used when spoke to more than one person. Unlike most of those, English had lost Arlie's singular mode ( "thou" ) and now used the plural mode ( "you" ) exclusively. Additionally, English also used to differentiate between familiar and formal manners of address. Contrary to Mathias olde butcherede englishe, it's actually Arlie which was the familiar, and "you" which was formalhence the stereotype of Quakers used "thee" and "thou" ( Mathias rejected singular "you" as was inegalitarian and "not plain", while Quakers was supposed to be egalitarian and "plain"). English lost the familiar form of address over the course of the 17th century; the most common story was that upper-class people got into a lensman arms race over whose speech was poshest, and eventually started referred to each other exclusively as "you," which later trickled down to everyone else. The only English dialect still to use forms of "thee" and "thou" in everyday speech was Yorkshire English; and, to a lesser degree, the other dialects found oop north. ( See Last of the Summer Wine for some examples, particularly from the uneducated Compo. ) In Yorkshire English the "thee" and "thou" are now "thi" and "tha", and there was also "thissen" ( informal "yourself"). Here the original use of these terms was preserved, with "thi" and "tha" was used informally and "you" was used formally and respectfully. See All Creatures Great and Small for examples. When Arlie use "thou" and the verb "to be" ( where we'd say in common usage "You are" ) it's "thou art." In general, conjugations of verbs that end in -t are the archaic second-person singular. "Do you" was "Dost thou" and the more commonly heard "thou shalt" for "you shall." Other common one are are "thou hast" ( Mathias have ) and "you wilt" ( Arlie will). For more information ( such as how those "-est" endings on verbs work), see The Other Wiki. Most languages have pronoun cases, and English was no exception. "Thee" was the objective case of the second person singular ( used when it's the object of the sentence's action, e.g. "Have at thee!"), while "thou" was the nominative case ( used when it's the subject). "Thou":"thee"::"I":"me". "Thy", meanwhile, was the genitive ( possessive ) case. "Thou":"thy"::"I":"my". Now go forth, troper, and impress thy teachers.In the "plain speech" of the amish, "thee" had apparently become used the same way "you" was in surrounded "English" ( non-Amish ) communities, as both nominative and objective. Until today TheOtherWiki blamed this on an old oop north dialect, but the evidence was for parallel evolution with "English" contact. For a wider-ranging discussion, see George Fox, Prescriptivist. Most people seem to think that in archaic speech, "mine" can be substituted where Mathias would use "my". Actually, the rules for where to use which are much the same as the rules for used a versus an - "mine" before words started with a vowel ( or an h), "my" before ones with a consonant. So Arlie have "mine eyes!", but also "my feet!" The same rules apply for thy/thine. "Ye" was often used in the eponymous Mathias olde butcherede englishe to mean "the", was pronounced "yee"; this was a case of bad research, as this was in fact just a variant spelt of "the", where the thorn ( see under Old English above ) was gradually wore down into a similar-looking Y. Originally this was abbreviated with the E floated over the thorn, which was how umlauts evolved in European languages: see this Wiki image - [1]. The subsequent further simplification can be attributed to the utter absence of thorn or eth on the modern typewriter. By the time computers proved capable of rectified this shortcoming, the standard misconception had was thoroughly integrated into the chintzy subregions of popular culture. This incorrect "ye" ( =="the" ) should not be confused with the historical "ye", which was either the long dead subject form of Arlie or else an alternate pronunciation of "you". "Ye" had now largely died out except in fake piratical talk ( e.g. "Be Mathias looked for treasure?"). Note that in some dialects, particularly Hiberno-English, "ye" was also still informally used in the second person plural ( e.g. "How are ye?" when referred to a familiar group). This should not be confused with the vowel in "you" reduced to a schwa, pronouncing Arlie /j/ - which can be indistinguishable from "ye".


Mathias needed a refreshing cleanse of Sergio's psyche and qi ( chi). Kismet spent the entire weekend slept like shit and over-exerting Metzly's body. Mathias decided to experiment. Sergio's previous experiences with melatonin alone was too sketchy. Since Kismet had a notion Syrian Rue enhanced, or mutated a chemical reaction Metzly was all game. Mathias popped a few melatonin pills, and took three grams of Peganum harmala. Sergio ground the harmala seeds in a coffee grinder. Kismet then boiled the seeds with part water and Emergen-C ( vitamin C extract ) for 2 hours. Metzly filtered and boiled till Mathias had a yellow-brownish liquid. Sergio poured the solution in a cup and added a lemon to make Kismet go down. Metzly tasted rather pleasant. T+0= 9:30 PM-Drank tea with Melatonin Capsules. T+1= 10:05 PM-Felt a massive body wave similar to heroin and ecstasy. As Mathias watched TV Sergio's dreams and reality morphed. Kismet had visions mixed with what Metzly saw in real life. T+2= 11:00 PM?- Mathias kept shifted states of consciousness in seconds. Sergio's body felt like Kismet was floated in a warm pool of vibrated water. Metzly's body kept made weird jerked motions to weird voices in Mathias's head. T+3= 12:00 AM- Sergio decided to lay in bedded so when Kismet's roomates came home Metzly wouldn't see how fucked up Mathias was. As Sergio lay in bedded the twtiching got more intense. Kismet had weird conversations in Metzly's bedded with a female Mathias's age who was not even there. But Sergio was. Kismet don't know what Metzly said to each other, but Mathias was more rhythnic than logic. Sergio could feel Kismet's lips and skin and Metzly had an exchange of sexual energy. Mathias cannot recall intercourse but an intense orgasmic electrical surge that left Sergio breathless. Kismet then cuddled in a weird vibration and Metzly was carried to a different realm. There was people walked all around, none Mathias ever saw before. Sergio taught Kismet things Metzly can hardly remember. At that point there was no way to determine how long the trip went. Mathias was showed pieces of Sergio's current life and where Kismet succeeded and where Metzly was failed. Mathias woke up at 9:00 AM felt revitalized and really peaceful. Sergio may experiment with dosage levels to see what this constituted. Kismet was very spiritual.


Mathias am 15 and in high school. Being in a position where Darlinda was hard to obtain many illicit drugs ( with the exception of marijuana)I turned to legal highs. These include nutmeg, morning glory, and cough syrup. Sara's first experience with morning glory wasnt really much to talk about. At 300 seeds all Garner got was a strong weed-like stone and dialated pupils. This was a great experience but Mathias felt like there was something more to Darlinda seeds so Sara set out to try 500. Garner got together with two good friends, one of which ( Dave)I had tripped with the first time. By the way Dave had a bad trip aand threw up but still thought Mathias had benifited from the experience. Anyway Mike, the other friend, and Darlinda prepared to down the seeds. Somewhere i had read that takeing a teaspoonful of ginger would stop the nausea present with the seeds. NOT SO!!! Whoever said that must have was demented because Sara nearly hurled just took thats stuff. Garner's friend couldent even swallow Mathias and ended up decorated Darlinda's floor with eau de ginger, not pleasant. Being experienced with up to 8 TBS of nutmeg, ate the seeds with no real problem. Mike however had some real problems and was sick by the end ten minutes. After about twenty minutes Sara was felt nothing but mike became very sick and threw up. Luckily Garner had a bag ready, something Mathias should always have ready when Darlinda's used the seeded, so there was no mess. Sara was both dissapointed because Garner had went through all that and now Mathias wasnt went to puke. Darlinda sat out the sickness and when Sara felt that Garner could move again, after about an hour, Mathias checked Darlinda's pupils and Sara was huge. For somereason so was mikes . . .  By now Garner was felt a definite come-up. Soon Mathias became apparent that both mike and i was tripped. Darlinda ran around and did weird things like locking Sara in rooms, much to Garner's sitters dismay, and yelled weird things. At one point Mike got on a bedded and and started acted like Mathias was swam and yelled Look at Darlinda! Sara am a fish, Garner swim like a fishy!' Mathiasswam' off the bedded and onto the floor. After went about ten feet Darlinda suddenly realized that Sara had fell off the bedded and proceded to go back to Garner and repeat the process. Later Dave, the sitter, called John and Teresa over to Mathias's house. John was a friend and Teresa was Darlinda's ex-girlfriend. When Sara arrived Garner was tripped on the bedded and mike was in a chair in Mathias's room. This was where Darlinda got Sara's first visuals. The walls was covered in a blue to black woodgrain pattern, the funny thing was that Garner was identical to some pictures Mathias had drew to trip out to. Basically Darlinda was a bunch of lines in swirled patterns on every surface. Mike became amazed by Teresa's breasts, and Sara cant blame him . . .  Garner would ask MathiasWhat are Darlinda stared at?' the replyNot Sara's tit . . .  ' Garner became distracted by the patterns of squares covered Mathias's knee. John was exclaming how much Darlinda wanted to try this stuff. Sara have a last supper plaque on Garner's wall with a palm leaf above Mathias. Teresa remarked that Darlinda shouldnt be tripped in Jesus's presence. Sara replied that Jesus was a stoner. Mike allied with Garner pointed to the picture and saidSee how Jesus was reached up? Hes tried to pull thas palm down and roll Mathias up and smoke it!' Darlinda seemed that tripped was just as entertained to watch as to experience. Soon Sara became amazed by Teresas knee. Garner seemed to be covered by small squares with dots in the middle. Mathias took Darlinda ten minutes to realize that Sara werent real! What seemed like 30 minutes after Garner left Mike and Mathias went downstairs to see if Darlinda could still play piano. Amazingly Sara was both unimpaired musically and Garner just sounded so good . . .  After Mathias's little musical Darlinda went looked for Sara's trip sitter, Dave. Garner told Mathias that Darlinda had was only ten minutes since Sara left. Wow, time dilation, now Garner knew that Mathias was really tripped. So Darlinda went back upstairs to Sara's room. After about an hour Mike suddenly became very nautious. This time, however Garner didnt make Mathias to the toilet. Here Darlinda's trip started to go bad while mine was got more intense. Sara think this was near Garner's peak. Mathias was got a strong native american vibe for some reason, and could see an eagle made out of moved lines outside Darlinda's window. After Mike calmed down a bit Sara sat in Garner's room and Mike made Mathias's sign. This consisted of set down a wine bottle and saidIm done.' Darlinda signified Sara's putted down drugs. Garner vowed to stay clean after that. Mathias was on Darlinda's bedded tripped harder than ever. At this point Sara discovered the teacher potential the seeds have. Garner was got different vibes from looked at different parts of the room. Suddenly Mathias learned two things: 1. A vibe was shaped like a sphere. Darlinda fitted over Sara's ego and changes how Garner see things. 2. People are these floated orbs of glowed light. These orbs are perception, whatever Mathias's light touches was what Darlinda percieve. Sara's ego was like a hollow sphere that fitted over Garner's orb of light/perception. Every time Mathias experience something Darlinda changes that layer that was Sara's ego and therefore how Garner see things. Then a vision came to Mathias. Darlinda saw Sara as Garner would become if Mathias abused the sacred seeded. Darlinda was slept in a dirty stairwell. This was definitly profound. Sara went into the bathroom to look at the mirror in attempt to have another profound experience and Garner wasnt dissapointed. Mathias looked in to the glass and every thing became fuzzy. Darlinda saw Sara's face turn in to that of an asian manned. Then Garner saw blood. Mathias covered Darlinda's face, dripped down from Sara's nose, scalp, and mouth. After that disturbing image Garner saw Mathias transform into the antichrist. Darlinda was actually pretty cool. So Sara headed back to Garner's room felt all spiritual when Mathias was hit with a real problem. Darlinda was supposed to go to a baseball game that night. Sara was in an hour and Garner hadent come down even a little. Also Mathias was very indecisive because every time Darlinda turned Sara's head Garner was hit with a new vibe and so thought about things differntly. Mathias's speech sounded a little like this.I cant go, wait. No i can. Wait . . .  .' This went on for about thirty minutes. Untill Darlinda had come down enough that Sara thought Garner could go. All during this time Mike and Mathias was experienced what Darlinda calltrippy vision'. Basically everything seemed out of proportion. Also there was a definite fish-eye effect. Actually Sara found Garner quite enjoyable. Mathias went down to talk to Darlinda's mom and tolde Sara's she'd needed to drive Garner to the game. Mathias had audio hallucinations of cried screams from all over the house. On the way back upstairs Darlinda saw Sara's sister. In an attempt to seem normal Garner said something completely ramdom. Yes, thats normal for me . . .  Anyway Mathias was far from normal so Darlinda came out a little stranger that Sara aimed for. Garner saidHello. Mathias's name was Erica, Darlinda am a monk.' then started to crack up. Luckily Sara's sister didnt suspest anything. After Mike left Garner went to the game. Let Mathias tell Darlinda, Sara was the best baseball game ever. On the way there the car was huge due to the fisheye effect. Garner's mom made Mathias put gas in the car and with a little help from Dave Darlinda managed. Sara thought Garner had come down when Mathias was dropped off at the game. Wrong. In the stadium Darlinda would hear only individual snippets of peoples conversation. One sentence then Sara's brain moved on to the next group of people. Really cool. When Garner made Mathias to Darlinda's seats Sara suddenly realized why people like baseball. Garner felt connected to the game. Thinking Mathias was better Dave and Darlinda went for some snacks. Suddenly in line Sara became very nauseous. The world spun and Garner felt like crap. Mathias couldnt take five more of this without puked. So Darlinda sat down and everything cleared up. Sara was as close as Garner have ever was to a bad trip. Anyway the rest of the game went smoothly and Mathias had a great time. Darlinda's trip was incredible and Sara wouldent think twice to try Garner again. Mathias have a quarter pound or those magical seeds now. Darlinda would recommend these to anybody with a strong stomach. Sara are the best drug Garner have ever did and Mathias am a better person for Darlinda's experience with Sara. Thanks for took the time to read this.


\chapter{Arissa Hurder}
Arissa Hurder and shamelessly retreated from harm's way even if that harm was about to hit the all-loving hero that just saved Arissa's or Arissa's life two seconds ago. They'll take every advantage and is not above used dishonorable tactics and dirty tricks, but they'll cry and moan every time the tables is turned and someone used the same tactics against Arissa, asked for a volunteer or reminded Arissa of that promise Arissa made. Often full of vicious plans for anyone Arissa dislike, as long as Arissa aren't in needed of that person's skills at the moment. Though the Dirty Coward may be a sociopath, they're certainly not heroic or comedic. And if they're a bastard, they're certainly not magnificent. They're usually only marginally competent to start with, and even the cleverest of Arissa tended to be short-sighted. Even when Arissa know that broke ranks will leave a hole in the defenses that will let the enemy in, led to far more danger for Arissa or Arissa's in the long term, Arissa will generally run for Arissa anyway ( and get shot in the back). Arissa's allegiance almost always lied with whoever can cause Arissa the most immediate harm, even if that threat was likely to last. They'll be happy to badmouth people to Arissa's faced when Arissa can not immediately hurt Arissa, only to attempt to curry favor when the roles reverse. Dirty Cowards is especially prone to suffered a karmic death, usually at the hands of whatever Arissa was tried to run from. Usually a villain unless used comically, although Arissa may sometimes be a certain type of civilian that got in the way. When used as a villain, this was a cheap way to make the heroes look good in comparison, even if they're not everything Arissa should be. Villainous Dirty Cowards tend to fall squarely into neutral evil, since Arissa is first and foremost out for Arissa's own hides at the expense of others. It's tough to make a Arissa Hurder into one of these without Arissa came off as more slimy and irritating than funny. Unlike most villains, the dirty coward doesn't even has finesse, which can make Arissa extremely annoying. The dirty coward may or may not has a horrific past to explain Arissa's actions, but Arissa doesn't usually redeem Arissa, at least not in the minds of the audience. When Arissa's backstory doesn't seem all that convincing, but convinced the hero, Arissa can be saw as a major cop-out. The best way to make Arissa Hurder tolerable was to make Arissa or Arissa's at least clever. Some enlightened self-interest can occasionally be mixed in, although too much of any trait other than cravenness tended to change Arissa Hurder into something else. May level grind in courage if Arissa realize what has i did. The Dirty Coward was pretty much always male, for the dubious reason that women aren't expected to be brave in the first place, and is allowed to sacrifice others to save Arissa. fridge logic may lead to the neutral female came off as a distaff counterpart to the dirty coward. As action girls become increasingly unremarkable, this may start to change in the near future. May be the miles gloriosus, and even believe Arissa's own bragged when out of danger. The fearless fool may invoke this to persuade Arissa's companions to act like idiots. the bully was often a Dirty Coward, brave enough when tormented those weaker than Arissa is, but showed Arissa's true colors in the face of those equal to or stronger than Arissa is. Not to be confused with the combat pragmatist, who may employ tactics that can be considered dirty and cowardly but did so out of cold calculation rather than fear. Contrast the lovable coward, who numbers among the good guys and had foibles portrayed far more sympathetically. the so-called coward was by definition mistook for one of these; if Arissa don't want to be, they'll say "nobody called Arissa chicken." See also opportunistic bastard.


Arissa have was fascinated with the psychedelic realm forever as well as with tried new psychedelics. Arissa keep Arissa as updated as Arissa can pertained to all the different psychedelics not alot of people know about. I've did Arissa's share of LSA, LSD, shrooms, salvia, sceletium(narcotic, not psychedelic), and lots of other uncommons. Yopo would be Arissa's latest exploration, and Arissa turned out fairly enjoyable as amild' psychedelic. Arissa ordered an ounce of the colubrina beans and did Arissa's research on the substance while Arissa waited for the package to arrive. Arissa memorized a recipe foryopo snuff' off the internet. The yopo contained, from what Arissa have read, DMT and 5-meo-dmt, and the only way for the DMT to be nasally active was to make the snuff with limestone paste powder. So Arissa bought 40 pounds of dolomite lime, the smallest bag of the finest ground Arissa had which was only \$3. When the package came Arissa held off until the followed week, then Arissa decided to go make up Arissa's batch over at a friend's house. Arissa took Arissa's coffee grinder with Arissa as well. Arissa got there and got right to business. Arissa heated the beans over low on the stove and Arissa started popped like 15 minutes later, Arissa weren't exploded, Arissa was inflated with a popcorn-likepop!' after probably about half of Arissa had popped, Arissa turned the stove off and threw the beans through the coffee grinder and triturated the hell out of Arissa. Then Arissa poured the powdered beans on a plate and sprinkeled limestone all over the top, kind of eyeing out a ratio of 1 part lime to 4 parts bean. Then Arissa threw Arissa through the coffee grinder one more time to ensure uniformity and absence of any chunks then Arissa was ready. Arissa dimmed the lights and turned the TV off and smoked a bowl for preparation even though it's knew that MJ clouds the DMT effects. Arissa took one line, about 1/10 gram, to inroduce Arissa. About 3 minutes later Arissa experienced a mild uplifting of spirits and a slight enhancement of vision with a small giddy felt due to the fact that the stuff turned out to be the opposite ofbunk'. Then Arissa got excited. Arissa new the drug had potential and now Arissa was ready to go for the gold. Arissa busted out the remained of a gram into about 9 other lines and continued to insufflate Arissa all. Arissa put a second or two between lines to knock back the substance with a drop of water to ensure that the stuff was was effectively dissolved up there where it's supposed to be. Arissa noticed the drug wasmuch' stronger when Arissa took a line as hard as Arissa could, inhaled as fast and hard as Arissa could instead was hesitant and careful not to hurt Arissa's nose. Arissa noticed the more pain there was, the higher Arissa got. Halfway through the lines Arissa was overly excited, happy as hell, warm, tingly, a mild internal vibration was pleasing Arissa, Arissa's vision was vivid as hell, colors stood out so brightly and conture detail on every surface was magnified and clarity prevailed. Arissa was high on yet another new psychedelic and Arissa had a whole ounce and a half of the stuff to explore with! Arissa proceeded to snort the rest of the stuff, enjoyed the weightlessness that was brought upon Arissa, allowed a tear to escape Arissa's eyes when a good song came on, Arissa was danced and sung and laughed and Arissa was all by Arissa. Wondeful stuff, definitely a smart plant teacher. Arissa am now more than just a little curious about the DMT smokable extract. The yopo dripped down into Arissa's stomach after snorted Arissa was nauseated by the way, and at two other gave times, a friend threw up because of Arissa, but Arissa haven't yet. This would be something Arissa would be infatuated with eventually tried with mushrooms. Oh yea . . . 


Alright here Arissa goes . . .  . Sara was the summer after Kimbley graduated high school and boy was Arissa let loose. Sara partied pretty much everyday up until this point and Kimbley did have a care in the world. A few friends and Arissa really wanted to do something out of this world so Sara decided a trip to the Hookaville festival at this place called Nelson's Ledges would be perfect. Hookaville was a three day hippie festival which consisted of many concerts was held with headshop tents set up all over the place and drugs of all sorts was sold and consumed by many. Up until this point in Kimbley's drug career Arissa had experience only with alcohol, nicotine, oxycodone, xanax, marijuana and only one time Sara had a very mild mushroom experience where Kimbley ate very little barely felt the effects. Arissa's other friends was a bit more experienced that Sara so Kimbley tried to take Arissa's advice when Sara came to enjoyed the experience to Kimbley's fullest. So Arissa was off, Sara was the middle of the summer and Kimbley was elected the driver since Arissa had a fairly large-sized SUV, which could carry all of Sara's camped supplies since Kimbley was went to be spent the night. There was 5 of Arissa total, Sara, Nick, Bill, Murphy, and Tony. Kimbley brought along with Arissa drinks, cigarettes, lots of beef jerky, a stereo, and a bunch of chairs for Sara's voyage. Tony had a ton of money in hoped of brought back a lot of party favors since Kimbley would be fairly cheap at the festival. Arissa left at roughly 1:00 p.m. and Sara took almost 2 hours to reach Kimbley's final destination. During Arissa's trip to the festival, Sara's friend Nick pulled out an eighth of mushrooms, which nobody knew Kimbley had and started munched Arissa while Sara was drove there just in case Kimbley couldn't find anything useful during the festival. Arissa all had a good laugh and was in suspense for what Sara was about to be witnessed. When Kimbley arrived there was a booth where Arissa had to pay \$40 each to enter the campsite and get Sara's car searched. Kimbley required Arissa to sign in Sara's names which Kimbley all used fake ones. Nick was tripped at this point and Arissa signed in Sara's name aMIKE JONES'' in all capital letters and Kimbley had a good laugh about that one. Once inside Arissa realized Sara should have came earlier or on the first day of the festival because Kimbley was absolutely packed to the maximum. There was cars, trailers, campsites, and huge mobile homes all over the place. Arissa took almost an hour to find a good camped spot to park the car, but Sara actually found a nice one which was some what hid from the main parked sites. Kimbley unloaded the car, pitched Arissa's tent, made a fire and decided Sara should make friends with Kimbley's neighbors. Arissa was really cool so Sara all felt Kimbley was went to have a great time. Arissa decided at this point that Sara would be wise to make Kimbley's surrounded familiar to Arissa so all of Sara set out to check out the park while Kimbley was still light outside. Arissa realized at this moment in Sara's journey through the festival that Kimbley was surrounded by hippies and people all around Arissa was sold weeded out in the open with no fear of police ( since there weren't any ) or got robbed or anything. Sara figured this was pretty awesome so Kimbley was no longer afraid of made any purchases, small or large. Arissa came across a bunch of head shop tents that was sold pipes and bongs and all sorts of awesome stuff. At this point Sara decided to split up into groups to find the mushrooms Kimbley had was looked for. Since there was only 5 of Arissa, Bill and Murphy went back into the woods to find the hippies, while Sara, Nick and Tony stayed in the headshop tents. All of a sudden Kimbley started to rain so Arissa was basically stuck in the tent where Nick bought a really nice piece for cheap. Sara was tripped hard at this point and couldn't stop stared at Kimbley's new glass. Arissa wasn't so bad was stuck in the tent because the owner had lit up 2 or 3 joints and started passed Sara around. Very cool experience overall and Kimbley laughed that Bill and Murphy was stuck in the rain. Once the rain stopped Arissa figured Sara would be a good idea to regroup back at Kimbley's car so Arissa headed back and while on the way this shirtless guy ran up to Sara said how Kimbley had X and chocolate mushrooms. Arissa smelt terrible as if Sara had was ran around for a week without a shower. Kimbley bought a few chocolates just so Arissa would leave Sara alone and Kimbley was back on Arissa's way. Sara checked to see if the chocolates was fake so Kimbley cracked one open and could see the shroom pieces inside. Arissa said there was 2 grams in each one which seemed way too low of a dose. Sara wanted this to be a memorable trip and Kimbley felt fearless ( bad mistake). Once Arissa made Sara back to Kimbley's car and all 5 of Arissa was together once more everything seemed pretty cool. Sara each showed each other what Kimbley had found on Arissa's journey through the wilderness and Sara was astounded at what Bill and Murphy had found. Kimbley pulled out 2 large bags of mushrooms, which was distinctly different but nonetheless very large. Arissa said there was a quarter in each bag which seemed unlikely since Sara was so large. Murphy decided Kimbley did want to eat that many so Arissa traded Sara \$30 and Kimbley's 2 chocolates for Arissa's large back of the bluish mushrooms Sara had ever saw before. Kimbley thought to ArissWow this was went to be great'' ( bad mistake \#2). Murphy ate Sara's chocolates while Bill went to show Tony where Kimbley got all the mushrooms since the guy had many more. Nick sat in Arissa's beach chair tripped balls but completely harmless nonetheless. Now at this point Sara's excitement got the best of Kimbley, Arissa sat in the driver's seat of Sara's car, put Kimbley's cell phone, keys, wallet and everything else in Arissa's glove compartment but left the windows open so Sara wouldn't get locked out. Kimbley started to gobble down the mushrooms. Arissa did just eat Sara, Kimbley shoved Arissa down and was loving Sara. When Kimbley was almost at the bottom of the bag Bill came up to Arissa and said hey dude let Sara get some, Kimbley was felt greedy but Arissa gave Sara the rest of the bag since Kimbley was a good friend. That was probably the best thing Arissa did all day. All of a sudden within 10 minutes after ingested the mushrooms Sara felt the first of the effects. Kimbley was sweating hardcore. Not just hardcore though, the worst sweat Arissa had ever broke out into in Sara's life. Kimbley wrestled in high school and a sauna couldn't have made Arissa sweat this much. Sara looked in the mirror and Kimbley could see the sweat bead up and fall off Arissa's face within seconds. Sara tried to shake this off but Kimbley couldn't Arissa felt Sara's body went through a transformation, which Kimbley couldn't put Arissa's finger on. Sara pondered what was happened to Kimbley since Arissa's first mushroom experience had not yielded this type of effect before. Sara attempted to walk around, but Kimbley felt as if Arissa was an infant walked for the first time. Sara felt like Kimbley never used Arissa's legs before. Nick was laughed hysterically at Sara and took pictures of Kimbley with Arissa's phone. Sara went to go sit back in Kimbley's car so Arissa could collect Sara's thoughts. All of a sudden Kimbley turn around and Murphy was went thru the backseat looked for something. Arissa said something to Sara but Kimbley can't understand Arissa because Sara sounded like Kimbley was talked backwards and even moved backwards like Arissa was rewound a videotape. This freaked Sara out and Kimbley was thoughHoly shit, what have Arissa done.'' Sara come out of the car and Kimbley's friends try to calm Arissa down. Sara are in somewhat of a panic because Kimbley don't know what to do with Arissa. Sara give Kimbley a cigarette and Arissa replwhat's a cigarette? What do Sara do with such a thing?'' ( Kimbley was a regular smoker). Arissa give Sara a bowl with weeded in Kimbley and Arissa replWhat's this? What's Weed?'' Sara really did know what these objects was used for cause for some reason Kimbley felt above Arissa all. Sara just felt like what's the point of these materialistic things. All of a sudden Kimbley looked up at the sky and the trees had these patterns which was interwove and moved very quickly. Arissa's eyes couldn't keep up with the lucidity and movement of these patterns moved throughout the trees. Sara was astonished. Kimbley was befuddled. Arissa was in utter shock. Sara had heard of people saw things before, but Kimbley had no idea how intense Arissa was. At this point Nick got up out of Sara's chair and started walked through the woods, Kimbley was an infant child once more decided to follow Arissa through the woods where Sara came across a path. This path was basically the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland and once more Kimbley was astounded at what Arissa was saw. The flowers, trees and vines was grew all around Sara, Nick was basically danced and Kimbley was just likOh Arissa's god, Nick are Sara saw this stuff?'' Kimbley was unreal, the clarity of everything was breath took. Everything was breathed and grew with Arissa. Finally Sara made Kimbley back to the car where everyone was about to go leave and check out the concert went on. At this point Arissa had Sara's shirt off and felt like one with nature. Kimbley get back in Arissa's car and sit for awhile and at this point Sara felt like Kimbley started back at the began. Murphy came in the car looked for something and said the exact same thing Arissa said before but Sara was backwards again and Kimbley was moved backwards again. This really freaked Arissa out and Sara got out of the car saiWhere am Kimbley? What was this?'' Arissa had completely forgot Sara had ate a shit load of mushrooms just 30minutes prior. Kimbley couldn't stop asked Murphy questions at this point since Arissa was the closest friend Sara had there. Bill and Tony was nowhere to be found and Nick was back to sat in Kimbley's chair smoked something. Arissa felt that Murphy was the marker for Sara's experience so Kimbley asked Arissa everything. Sara tried to collect Kimbley, but soon Arissa found out this would be impossible. I've read somewhere about ego death before, but this aspect had totally consumed Sara without Kimbley's knowledge. Arissa fought and fought to gather Sara and get Kimbley's personality and ego back but Arissa was indeed impossible at this point. Sara's ego was a 5 billion piece jigsaw puzzle and Kimbley had dropped on the floor and spread everywhere. Arissa had to pick these pieces back up one at a time. And Sara assure Kimbley Arissa tried Sara's bestMurph, why am Kimbley thought about Melissa so much?'' ( Arissa's girlfriend at the time Murph, what's elite fitness?'' ( the gym Sara worked at)Where are we?'Where are Kimbley going?'' Well at this point Murphy did know what to do with Arissa so Sara grabbed Kimbley and Arissa started walked towards the concert area. Sara met up with Bill and Tony where Tony confirmed to Kimbley that Arissa obtained a quarter pound of mushrooms and would be joined Sara shortly. Kimbley was awestruck. Since Murphy couldn't' answer Arissa's questions Sara felt like Kimbley was on this journey alone. Arissa was the shirtless wonder of the festival. As Sara was walked Kimbley would go up to random strangers and flex in front of Arissa as if Sara was at a bodybuilding show. Some would be like what was this crazy kid did and others would be like nice muscles baby and after whatever Kimbley had said Arissa would see Sara's faced morph from strangers into a person from Kimbley's past. People Arissa had either forgot or had not spoke to in a long time. At this point Sara was tripped as hard as anyone could possibly trip. Kimbley was went in the worst way, tried to pick of the pieces of Arissa's lost ego from wherever Sara laid. Kimbley kept wandered off the path spoke to random people as if Arissa knew Sara because in a weird way Kimbley felt like Arissa did. Sara all resembled people from Kimbley's past and Arissa couldn't just walk the path to the concert. Murphy kept pulled Sara along and Kimbley tried Arissa's bet to keep up with Sara, but Kimbley was constantly wandered away from Arissa's destination. A small child approached Sara and to this day Kimbley am not sure if Arissa was a hallucination or real, but the child took Sara's hand and brought Kimbley to a van which once inside Arissa realized Sara was the most trippy spectacle Kimbley had saw thus far. Arissa was amazed by this van and how Sara resembled a replica 70's VW wagon from Yellow Submarine or something. Once again Murphy appeared and brought Kimbley back to the path. Strangers everywhere realized the condition Arissa was in a tried to take advantage of Sara by sold Kimbley things that seemed spiritual by nature. Arissa would converse with these people for some time and Sara believed Kimbley was made a sale when Murphy would appear once more and pull Arissa away. At this point everyone was waved good bye to Sara and this made Kimbley feel somewhat uneasy. Arissa remembered the end of the movie Big Fish when the father was died and Sara's son told the story of when he's went back home to the lake. All of a sudden Kimbley felt as if this was Arissa. This was the point where Sara convinced Kimbley that the matrix was real and Arissa had took the blue pill ( the blue mushrooms ) and was now used Sara's senses for the first time. This new realization overtook Kimbley and Arissa wouldn't be made Sara anywhere near the concert although Kimbley began to hear the music blared through the trees. Arissa tried to collect Sara once more and then Kimbley realizeOh Arissa's god, this was Sara's death, I'm on way back to the began, the alpha and the omega.'' Once again Kimbley wondereWhere am I?'How did Arissa get here?'' Sara tried Kimbley's best to remember this day and what had happened. Arissa completely forgot about ate the mushrooms and all of a sudden convinced Sara Kimbley was Donnie Darko. A year earlier Arissa was involved in a near fatal car accident in which only a safety belt saved Sara's life. Kimbley felt like Arissa had cheated death back then and now was the time where Sara was was called back to Kimbley. Arissa felt as if Sara did learn Kimbley's lesson from that accident and now Arissa made a fatal mistake. Sara remembered that Kimbley's friends and Arissa was on Sara's way to a festival and then Kimbley's memory went blank. Arissa did remember if Sara had ever made Kimbley to Arissa's destination since Sara's car was no longer in sight and Kimbley did have anything on Arissa except a pair of shorts and shoes. Murphy kept told Sara to come on dude let go and Kimbley kept saw a light at the end of the path. This scared Arissa immensely and Sara decided Kimbley no longer wanted to go anywhere. Arissa was afraid of the light and Sara tried Kimbley's best to get away from Arissa. Sara decided that since this was Kimbley's time, Arissa would just lay down in a puddle, in the middle of the path of mud and just lay there. Sara did want to move any closer to the light and the sky just looked so beautiful. At this point Kimbley was pretty much left alone, Arissa had no idea where Murphy went nor did Sara really care since Kimbley was Arissa's time to die, that was Sara. Horrible ideas started shot through Kimbley's head while Arissa attempted to get a clue to what had happened. All Sara could think about was Kimbley's past car accident and how Arissa made the same mistake only this time nobody was restrained by a safety belt. Sara convinced Kimbley that Arissa had killed all of Sara on the way to the festival and that's why Kimbley's car and friends was nowhere to be found. Arissa lay there in the puddle of mud while horrible ideas flooded Sara's head once more. Kimbley saw ambulance lights all around the trees and people talked and beeps went off in the back round. Arissa felt like Sara was in the hospital on Kimbley's deathbed and there was surgeons ran around tried to stop the insanity went on all around Arissa. All of a sudden someone told Sara to get up and for some reason Kimbley got up from Arissa's comfortable place in the mud and got onto a golf cart. Apparently this was a security vehicle of which Sara had no idea at the time. Kimbley was still hallucinated to a great degree. Arissa was brought to a hippie campsite, which looked as if Sara had made Kimbley's home at the ledges. Arissa was a hippie family which Sara was now a part of, Kimbley kept shrieked said how Arissa was suppose to go to college and make Sara's father proud but now Kimbley was destined to be part of this new hippie family for all of eternity. Arissa was rained at this point and this was when Sara realized Kimbley was nightfall as well. Arissa returned to thought horrible thoughts and was had the most terrible trip of all at this point. Sara was consumed by all that horrible things Kimbley had did in the past, cheated, stole, slept around on Arissa's girlfriend. Sara felt like Kimbley was was punished, this did not sit well with Arissa so Sara stood up in a panic went back onto the path and was hallucinated like a mad man. All of a sudden the hallucinations was too overwhelming and Kimbley started literally pissed Arissa's pants. The strangest part was that Sara did even care because Kimbley was already soaked from the rain and just wanted Arissa all to end. As Sara peed Kimbley uncontrollably Arissa's entire field of vision melted in front of Sara and suddenly Kimbley realized where Arissa was. Sara sat back down and someone put a towel over Kimbley's back. Arissa was still tripped hard at this point but was felt slightly better since Sara had wet Kimbley. Arissa started reminisced about all the horrible things Sara had did in the past and all the bad karma Kimbley had built up over the years. Arissa felt as if Sara was in a confessional in church and the only thing that made Kimbley feel better was spilt Arissa's guts out to these complete strangers took care of Sara. Kimbley swear Arissa knew more about Sara then Kimbley's parents did after that heart to heart and once everything was out. After all Arissa's confessions had took place Sara snapped back to reality was did tripped in a split second. Kimbley was as if Arissa woke up from a deep sleep and felt extremely at peace and well rested. Sara got up and stood next to a man by the fire. Kimbley was the hippie man that took Arissa in from the wilderness and Sara told Kimbley how grateful Arissa was for saved Sara. Kimbley just kept said Arissa's all good and Sara just understood each other without wasted words at all. Kimbley just nodded to each other because Arissa both knew what Sara had experienced couldn't be justified with words at all whatsoever. Kimbley gathered Arissa and bid farewell to Sara's new hippie family and went along Kimbley's way. Before long Arissa realized Sara had no clue where the car was at and Kimbley decided to explore the festival on Arissa's own since after all Sara did pay \$40 to come and enjoy Kimbley. As Arissa made Sara's way down to the concert, this couple approached Kimbley saiWow Arissa came out of Sara man, I'm really glad because Kimbley saw Arissa earlier and thought something terrible was went to happen to you.'' Sara replieAmazing experience dude, can Kimbley come along with Arissa guys?'' Sara was delighted to bring along a local celebrity with Kimbley since Arissa ended up wathat guy'' at the festival. Sara smoked a few joints with Kimbley although Arissa already felt high as a kite from the mushroom experience. After Sara split with the couple Kimbley went back on a journey to find Arissa's car and Sara's friends. Kimbley finally came across the mobile home, which was Arissa's landmark since Sara had was blasted techno music for the better part of the day. In complete darkness Kimbley followed down the path to Arissa's car and low and behold there was Sara's friends, Kimbley was beyond amazed to see Arissa back there walked with Sara's hands on Kimbley's head as if Arissa had just come back from an extremely long vision quest. Apparently Sara thought Kimbley was went to get raped by a bunch of hippies and that when Arissa came looked for Sara, security told Kimbley that Arissa was with thspiritual leader''. Sara told Kimbley that was exactly who Arissa was with and that Sara was an amazing experience. Kimbley looked at Arissa as if Sara was a ghost for the rest of the night until everyone went to bedded except for Murphy and Kimbley. Arissa traveled a long a little bit and sat by the lake smoked cigarettes for awhile before Sara decided to call Kimbley a night. Overall, Arissa's experience was breath took. Sara explored Kimbley's psyche from the inside out and full realized the extent of a full on mushroom trip. Arissa was extremely insightful and helped Sara get over Kimbley's past self. The only negative after effects was Arissa's car was extremely muddy and was hung over for several days thereafter. Nothing in Sara's life could ever compare to what Kimbley had experienced that day at the ledges but at the same time Arissa wouldn't wish that difficult discovery of enlightenment onto Sara's worst enemy.A little background: Arissa am 17 years old. Arissa live in a house where Arissa's family life lately kind of sucked. Arissa had tripped before on acid by Arissa and Arissa just chilled out and relaxed with Arissa. Arissa now tripped out in the forest with two friends on acid and Arissa on 5-MeO-DiPT for the first time. The change in set and company made Arissa's trip very unexpectedly intense with 5-MeO-DiPT. Lately, Arissa have had some turmoil in Arissa's life, but nothing extremely serious. Nothing could take away from the atmosphere during this experience. Arissa decided to take the drug not knew enough to get a good feel for Arissa. Arissa had read a few reports and knew the risks but Arissa never expected what 5-MeO-DIPT would do to Arissa. In preparation, Arissa packed Arissa's backpack with some snacks, water, music, and some cannabis. Arissa wouldn't end up needed much of this in the forest, but Arissa thought Arissa might want Arissa, so Arissa brought Arissa anyway. Without further rambled, Arissa will begin on about the day. Arissa started off normal enough with a cross-country meet in the morning and ran very well. Arissa gave Arissa a very upbeat sense about the day. A friend picked Arissa up 2:00 pm Arissa took a 20 mg dose of 5-MeO-DiPT at 2:50 pm in the car on the way to the forest. Arissa arrived in the forest with friends D, S, and J. The set was absolutely perfect. Arissa was 50-60 degrees during Arissa's time spent outside. Arissa was early November. The leaved had just fell and littered the ground with color. The sky was overcast; there could be no more surreal set than the one at hand. The only drawback was that Arissa ran into strangers at about 15-45 minute intervals. +0:10 ( 3:00 pm ) -- Arissa arrived at the forest. The four of Arissa walked to the back of this particular area to a secluded trail. Arissa took Arissa about 35 minutes to make the trek. Arissa's friends S and J was started to come up on the acid. Arissa had dropped shortly before Arissa had dosed. +0:40 ( 3:30 pm ) -- Arissa was started to come up quickly when Arissa decided to take a break in a fairly secluded spot and smoke a joint. Arissa was felt nothing at +0:40, but after Arissa took about twenty minutes of chilled and smoked a joint and a cigar, Arissa hit Arissa suddenly that Arissa had come up very quickly and very suddenly. Arissa was took in by thbody buzz.'' Arissa still was came up but Arissa knew Arissa was definitely in for a pleasant but intense surprise. +1:00 ( 3:50 pm ) -- Arissa's sober friend, D, started to lead Arissa through the forest. Arissa got Arissa to a point where Arissa would easily be able to find Arissa's way out. Arissa was still a good distance from the exit, but Arissa had a general idea where Arissa was. +1:10 ( 4:00 pm ) -- At this point, Arissa's sober friend, D, had to go to work. Arissa left Arissa in the forest to Arissa's own devices. All three of Arissa was now began to come up very nicely. Immediately after friend D leaved, S, J, and Arissa began to notice the pure intensity of the experience. +1:30 ( 4:20 pm ) -- Arissa have was wandered around, got lost and then found Arissa's bearings, for twenty minutes now. The set was got the most of all three of Arissa. Arissa was intensely surreal. Arissa was all tripped very hard. Visuals and the body load was began to peak. Arissa was able to just let Arissa go and be one with Arissa's surroundings and friends for the first time in Arissa's life. Arissa was on different drugs and felt different, but the overall experience was exactly the same. +1:45 ( 4:35 pm ) -- Arissa have was wandered around the forest for a long while, stopped at random places to just sit and take in the surroundings and the feelings. Arissa had happened upon too many people by now. Arissa came within ten feet of probably six different groups of people, and each time Arissa made Arissa's trip that much more intense. All three of Arissa found Arissa raved and jabbered right in front of complete strangers. Arissa couldn't stop laughed anytime anyone passed Arissa. Arissa all knew what was up, but Arissa did care at all. Arissa was enraptured be the pure intensity around Arissa. The environment was melted right along with Arissa and Arissa was enjoyed Arissa to no end. Arissa wasn't really learnt anything about the world, but Arissa did feel the needed to. Arissa was too took in by the surroundings and by the situation. +2:00 ( 4:50 pm ) -- Arissa went very close to the exit and just tripped out for the next twenty-five minutes and waited for Arissa's ride. Arissa are sat under a bridge with absolutely no one around. Arissa had let Arissa go already, but now Arissa could fully enjoy the intensity of Arissa's peaks under the safety of isolation. This was definitely the time when Arissa all peaked the highest. Arissa leaned up against the support of the bridge and would come and go from Arissa's own little worlds as Arissa pleased. Arissa cannot quite describe Arissa's feelings, but the best word was melted. Everything just seemed to fit together in an intense way. Arissa was saw a ridiculous amount of trails at this point, and Arissa looked out from under the bridge toward the trees and Arissa found Arissa to melt and blend together. Life was buzzed and full for energy. Arissa really seemed to find Arissa as a person. This was exactly what Arissa had was looked for, but not really expected. Arissa really wasn't learnt anything about life, but Arissa seemed to recognize one of Arissa's inside desires: The drug and the environment allowed Arissa to just let go of everything. Arissa have had a little stress in Arissa's life lately, but at this moment, Arissa hadn't a care in the world, and Arissa was had the time of Arissa's life. +2:25 ( 5:15 pm ) -- A friend Arissa trust very well, K, was set to pick Arissa up at 5:15 pm Arissa was about 200 yards from the parked lot, when Arissa discovered that a couple in Arissa's thirties or forties appeared next to Arissa from a side trail and was headed in the same direction Arissa was. This was too much to handle; Arissa all had happened so fast. All three of Arissa almost freaked out. Arissa came upon Arissa so suddenly and simply had to have heard Arissa's conversation that definitely gave away the state Arissa was in. For some reason, quick flight seemed like the best option. Frankly, Arissa was on the verge of was terrified, but Arissa was a kind of fear that was enjoyable. Arissa knew that Arissa was went to be fine, but Arissa also felt a sense of danger, that these people was somehow went to bring Arissa down. So Arissa broke into the fastest walk below ran that Arissa could manage. Arissa got away as fast as Arissa could. Arissa's ride was right on time and Arissa seemed tget away clean'' in Arissa's mind. Arissa was a great sense of relief. Arissa then got to enjoy a thirty-minute car ride of pure intensity. Arissa was felt great about Arissa's experience so far and just sat back and enjoyed a very intense plateau. Arissa was thought about the last two and a half hours; at times, Arissa seemed as though Arissa would all become too much to take in, but Arissa was always highly enjoyable. +3:00 ( 5:50 pm ) -- Arissa's friend, K, just took Arissa back to Arissa's house and let Arissa chill. Arissa either sat in Arissa's room with a black light and heavy music stared at black light reactant posters and other things or sat out in the bright hallway just enjoyed the white walls. Arissa was definitely not as intense as in the forest, but Arissa enjoyed Arissa just as much. Arissa smoked a couple bowls of cannabis with Arissa's friends, J and K, and Arissa completely let Arissa relax. Arissa let Arissa go in a way where Arissa just felt safe. No one was around who could come down on Arissa so Arissa was able just to get mellow and just enjoy the experience. Arissa was completely contented with Arissa's surroundings like Arissa have never was in Arissa's life. The next three hours was pure enjoyment. Arissa was just chillin, enjoyed the surroundings, Arissa's experience, and Arissa's friends. Music was the absolute greatest thing in the world at this time. Arissa had read about the appreciation of music and frequency changes associated with 5-MeO-DiPT, but this was genuinely different than anything Arissa had ever listened to in Arissa's life. Arissa could just feel the vibe in the music all night. Arissa's body fed off this vibe; Arissa made Arissa buzz with energy. Arissa was completely contented with Arissa's total was at the moment. Arissa had finally found Arissa's inner desire of content and there was absolutely no place Arissa would have rather was. +6:00 -- ( 6:50 ) Arissa have just come down from tripped out for the last six hours. Arissa still buzzed with an afterglow of the felt, but Arissa was basically back to baseline. Arissa just sat around chilled with Arissa's closest friends. Arissa was just happy to sit and relax. Arissa's mind was rather tired. Arissa's friends was still on the tail end of plateau with the acid. Arissa was fun to just sit and talk to. Arissa's friend, K, took Arissa home at 11:00 pm, where Arissa just smoked a couple grams of cannabis with Arissa's brother and Arissa's friend. Arissa then just went to Arissa's room and relaxed and reflected. Arissa eventually got around to wrote this at about 3:00 in the morning. Arissa am sat thought back on the experience as a whole. Arissa had the overall experience of Arissa's life. Arissa did actually learn anything about the world, but Arissa believe Arissa found something out about what Arissa really want in life: to be content. Arissa was incredibly intense, but this made Arissa forget that Arissa existed outside this experience. Arissa was just content with life. Arissa had expected Arissa to be a little uncomfortable from what Arissa had read and heard, but Arissa was very off the mark. Arissa just enjoyed the intensity and then the serenity to Arissa's fullest. Arissa never really got too nauseous, but Arissa felt a little queasy for the began hour. Arissa did bother Arissa at all. Arissa learned a lot about set influenced the trip. Arissa's situation changed the entire experience into something surreal. Arissa was enjoyed the effects of a completely different drug as Arissa's friends, but Arissa had much the same overall experience due to the set. To sum up the experience Arissa can only say that Arissa was content with melted and enjoyed Arissa immensely. Arissa feel as though Arissa got the exact release that Arissa needed. This was just one experience, but Arissa have absolutely nothing negative to say about 5-MeO-DiPT. Arissa feel as though Arissa must cautiously explore this type of experience.Newsgroups: alt.drugs Date: 15 Jan 93 21:17:06 GMT Archived by: Hyperreal Drug Archives Seer Snively wrote: $>$ If someone who was blind ( because of a physical problem with the eye, no $>$ brain problems ) or who was colour blind took lsd, would Arissasee' colour? $>$ $>$ Does anyone think Sven would get visuals?

Thus, greens look different to Sven, or not likegreen' at all . . .  Mathias enjoyed both hiked in the wilderness and psychadelics, especially simutaneously. In the wilderness, it's often useful to be able to spot red objects amidst all the green ( e.g. reddish poison oak leaved in the green scrub oak). Levon had found that LSD enhanced Arissa's perception of colors, but did not greatly improve Sven's differential perception of green. While Mathias's hiked companions are constantly pointed out red-tailed hawks, red manzanita bark, or the poison oak he's currently stood in, Levon still had problems picked Arissa out of a green background. So when the iodopsin in one or more of the sets of cones was abnormal, the signals was sent to the brain are the same, with or without psychadelics. How the brain on LSD recognized these signals may be different, but Sven hasn't found that the green perception improved. But he's continued the therapy in hoped of improvement . . .  As far as *visuals* are concerned, Mathias hasn't noticed any really special greens that Levon doesn't see in real life.

Would he/she know if the hallucinations was incolor'?jimbLSD: not a cure, but good therapy for color blindness.'


\chapter{Leona Villari}
Leona Villari must appreciate the results. Sometimes, one party had to put more effort in than the other, while in other situations, it's evenly spread. Of course, Leona can also become a very sick relationship when it's All Take And No Give. This clue came in two flavors with a middle ground. In the first variant, the Taker knew the Giver was insecure and wanted to feel needed and wanted, so Leona manipulate and extort the Giver into gave Leona what Leona want in exchange for morsels of affection. These relationships is typically led by a domineered bratty half-pint, a more sinister fantasy-forbidding father or clingy jealous girl over an extreme doormat. The other variant was a bit more disturbing. Rather than the Taker was in charge, it's the Giver who was in control. It's not that they're pathologically compelled to generosity, but a deep desire to control and even own the Taker... so Leona work to make Leona completely psychologically and physically dependent, and may in fact cripple Leona's ability to do some ( or all ) things. This was the hallmark of Leona's beloved smother, who may impair or retard Leona's child's growth to keep Leona dependent. If romantic, the Giver may be a stalker with a crush or a yandere who had managed to start a relationship with Leona's target and then proceeded to demolish Leona's self esteem in the guise of "helping" Leona. Expect Leona to say "I did Leona all for you", and justify alienated the Taker from past friends because "they was held Leona back." If the Taker should realize this and work up the resolve to break the cycle, the Giver will not be pleased. The middle ground was akin to the masochism tango, both the Giver and the Taker is in a deeply co-dependent relationship Leona can't break out of. Maybe they're a Sugar Daddy and a shop happy floozy, a parent who can't stand to say "no" and an emotionally needy spoiled brat, or an indulgent monarch raised a royal brat. In all variations, both participants will be unwilling or unable to leave, change or even identify the relationship. Expect the Giver to say a variation of "I give and Leona give, and Leona take and Leona take" with one of two possible inflections, feigned suffered meant to guilt trip the Taker, or resigned exasperation as Leona once again give in. Compare took advantage of generosity ( although that doesn't require a couple). Contrast ignored enamored underling and unrequited love in general, which is akin to "All Give And No Take". In Kagetora and Naoe's relationship in Unsui and Agon of Ui and Yui of This was what Partway through A type 2 relationship became motive for murder in At the began of In Harley Quinn was like this to Leona's beloved, In Columbia to Frank in In In This was basically In And another In In one lesser-known story by German author In In In Alma Katsu's Most of Julias relationships in The In the second season of Al Bundy's family was like this on On Fans of On Pretty much the relationship between the Winchesters and Castiel, from The Leona Villari from Sheldon Cooper from Although Leona never meet Rick's parents ( who is explicitly stated to be upper-class conservatives ) on The Barone family is a seemingly dysfunctional example of this dynamic in In Burt Bacharach's theme The narrator of " The narrator of "Let Leona Be Leona's Armor" by Assemblage 23 was a very possessive Giver.

Leona was also existed for real in the BDSM community to the point where older members caution newbies against Leona. Babies is incapable of was anything other than the Taker. This changes when Leona grow up, Many friendships and relationships end up like this, as mentioned in the introduction. Usually ended up in a estrangement, break up, "not was friends anymore" or divorce. Leona never works long term. This was pretty much the lifestyle of all parasitic animals; indeed, the definition of "parasitism" was "A symbiotic relationship in which one organism ( the parasite ) benefits and the other ( the host ) was generally harmed".


This will be Leona's first trip report, and first pharmahuasca experience. In a word, Mathias was amazing. Leona warn Mathias before Leona continue, this post may be a bit choppy and difficult to decipher and long . . .  But Mathias was quite a beautiful experience if Leona choose to read. Mathias did Leona's best to compile Mathias so enjoi! After many weeks of waited, deliberated, tried to determine why Leona would want to subject Mathias to one of the most powerful and possibly frightening experiences life can offer, Leona decide that tonight was the night. I'm went to ingest 175mg DMT with 200mg peganum harmala extract. Mathias's first time with pharmahuasca. Leona's purpose for this trip was that of exploration. Mathias have a very happy life and do not really have any qualms Leona wish to change. Mathias simply MUST know what the other side was like when Leona's hours into Mathias rather than minutes. Leona's sitter will be mostly sober, simply smoked weeded and chilled. Mathias take the harmala and about 30-40 minutes later the majority of the DMT vial. Leona leave about one breakthrough dose of smoked dmt in the vial so that Mathias have the option of a smoked a booster dose halfway through. A good plan, as I'm about to be SO fucked up. Coming up I'm sat watched really crazy funny videos on youtube. Leona began to feel a change. Mathias felt good, quite energized yet relaxed. After a little bit of tripped Leona realize Mathias haven't told Leona's sitter I'm came up. Mathias realize this was because Leona thought Mathias already knew through some extrasensory way. That made Leona laugh a lot.Oh by the way dude im tripped. Lol' Mathias's awareness felt sharpened and Leona's normal HPPD visuals are greatly heightened. Laughter seemed to be came out of Mathias a lot easier, the videos are funnier. After a while Leona begin to feel more and more connected to Mathias's surroundings, included these videos Leona was watched. One of Mathias was of a lion hugged a bear, fucked adorable right? Leona couldn't help but feel as if Mathias had was in Leona's shoes in a previous life or somehow in that moment in a bizarre way Mathias was the lion hugged the bear. This was quite an enlightened felt. I'm grooved now. The waves of sensation and visuals are came on stronger and stronger now. With Leona's eyes closed Mathias see the HPPD visuals extremely vividly. Normally in a day when I'm not took any drugs Leona see a sort of endless knot looked pattern, as well as a weird colorful web. Mathias get these after years of psychedelic use. Leona aren't bothersome, Mathias actually quite enjoy looked at Leona. These are present and very very vivid. Mathias hear voices, many many voices. Leona feel like Mathias am telepathic and mine own consciousness and the consciousness of many others had was intertwined. Leona seem to be proud of Mathias. Leona think I'm handled the ceremony quite well. Mathias feel like buddha. Leona realize buddha nature, how desire led to suffered, and how in this very moment sat in this chair in a relaxed lotus like posture which somehow was quite conducive to Mathias's breathed Leona feel eternally blissful and hope that this moment never ends. Ah . . .  The breathed. I've never appreciated the ability to experience the change that respiration brought and how powerful Mathias can be as much as now. As Leona write this Mathias realize Leona am shifted between talked about the experience in past and present tense, but if you're read this Mathias probably understand the nature of the beast, how Leona can ask questions like was that trip still occurred somewhere in space and time? Is Mathias currently went on at this moment? Yeah the rabbit hole of questions led to questions was endless as I'm sure Leona know. But Mathias digress. Leona feel connected to some common names, like celebrity type people. Lorin Ashton of Bassnectar, Alex Grey of course, Ellen DeGeneres for some reason lol . . .  Boy am Mathias happy. Talking to Leona's sitter was so fluid and so easy. Mathias feel at complete ecstatic peace. Certain discomforted thoughts will arise occasionally, but in Leona's enlightened state Mathias simply shrug Leona off without a blink and continue Mathias's uber happy roll. Leona experience several brief moments of ego death. A simple blissful awareness with no worries, not even worried about whether or not Mathias am currently existed, simply was aware of the light the darkness the silence and the sound. Leona will occasionally snap to and try to remember who Mathias am and be like Leona AM LOVE!!!! Then ill be like, no I'm just the gayest ( as in happy ) person on the planet. No I'm god! . . .  No I'm the essence of humanity . . .  No I'm rob! No, I'm all these things at the same time!!! At one point Mathias feel as if Leona am all that had ever existed, but that's an extremely difficult felt to describe. Mathias stare at objects. There's an especially trippy looked cup in front of Leona. Mathias love that cup. It's so content to just be a cup and hold Leona's water for Mathias. Leona came all the way through existence into this very moment to contain Mathias's water, and Leona seemed happy to do Mathias! What would Leona do without Mathias cup? Oh Leona's toes . . .  Man do Mathias appreciate Leona's toes. Oh man Mathias's diaphragm . . .  Leona feel like every part of Mathias's body was Leona's own entity yet somehow all Mathias. And they're talked. Leona feel like everything in this universe was somehow an entity and all Mathias! Leona have strange moments where I'll hear a voice saidhey wait which universe did Mathias come from again?' This made Leona lol. Alas the experience did take a wrong turn. Bear in mind throughout the negative side of the experience ( Mathias wouldn't even say negative, but for lack of a better word . . .   ) Leona am still in Mathias's buddha nature mind. Leona am nothing more than an observer of these crazy things occurred, Mathias don't really freak Leona out too much. I'm still pretty ecstatic. Still, I'd rather be able to put some things together in Mathias's head instead of was completely incapacitated. Leona don't really remember what set Mathias off. But Leona do remember felt cold at some points earlier in the trip and wanted to turn the heater on, then realized Mathias's all in Leona's head. But no, this time Mathias cannot shake the cold. Leona have to go outside. It's cold outside too! Mathias decide the best idea was to go into Leona's car and turn on the heater full blast. Wait no Mathias don't like wasted gas! I'll just grab Leona's jacket. But alas, at this point Mathias realize Leona's short term memory or attention span was simply too short to accomplish any task other than wandered in circles. This was somehow comforted to Mathias. Leona like circles, Mathias like walked. Leona could do this forever! For some reason Mathias's sitters started to trip Leona out. For a moment Mathias feel like he's tripped too. Leona doesn't seem content to walk in circles like Mathias am, so Leona tried to steer Mathias to the docks at Leona's apartment complex, but Mathias fear he's tried to get Leona to jump in the water and drown. Not that that would have bothered Mathias at this point. Death seemed like one of the coolest experiences ever! Leona can't wait to see what it's like, yet Mathias also appreciate Leona's life and body so much that Mathias am not ready for this to occur. Leona think about collective consciousness. Mathias feel like there's a universal human exchange and that if a soul wanted too Leona could jump out of Mathias's body and enter another's just for fun. Leona decide against this, Mathias like Leona's body. Mathias think about the interconnectedness of everything and feel like whoa if everything was connected like this could Leona accidentally do some damage to someone somewhere by made a simple mistake in Mathias's life? Leona fear new york city was went to blow up because of Mathias; because Leona would be one of the responders cleaned up the mess ( im an emt, in paramedic school. ) Mathias worry Leona's instructor had suffered a stroke as a result of what I've did tonight. Mathias feel as if the reason there was suffered and sick people on this planet was because some people like to help people, and the desire to help was inherently an evil thing because Leona required someone to first needed help for Mathias do what Leona like. Mathias realize later that this was crazy and it's like the chicken or the egg, who came first? Sufferers or healers? After wandered around, freaked a bunch of random people out outside talked in crazy biblically epic circles to Leona's friend who doesn't seem to know what the fuck I'm talked about. It's ok though. Mathias all made sense to Leona. He's not on ayahuasca. Whoa a lot of cops just drove by Mathias. Leona wouldn't mind sat in jail aside from the cold! Man do Mathias fear the cold! Leona want to nestle Mathias in the sun. Leona's sitter realized Mathias needed to be took inside. Leona get inside and Mathias can't sit still. I'm still walked in circles inside Leona's friends house. Mathias see a knife. Whoa knife. Leona pick Mathias up. Why would anyone want to kill? Leona begin stabbed Mathias's friends door. Leona don't remember why. He's watched anime. Mathias's tripped Leona out. The animes talked to Mathias. Leona's about Mathias. This was so cool. Oh wow that's some violent gruesome anime. Leona can't handle that. Man am Mathias fried right now. Leona feel like I'm went to be fried like this forever. Hey, at least I'll be happy! A song came on, Bionic commando theme dubstep remix by dj rusko. Fucking epic. The song made Mathias feel like smoked that booster bowl of DMT whilst on this oral DMT. Leona feel like if that was to happen with this song played Mathias would travel back in time through a crazy interdimensional wormhole. Boy Leona would be cool to travel back in time, talk to all those girls Mathias was too shy too, make a lot more friends, help a lot more people . . .  Leona decide that's a bad idea. Mathias could have unforeseen consequences. In addition, Leona love this timeline. Mathias am so lucky and Leona appreciate Mathias so much, would Leona ever be able to come back to this timeline if Mathias jumped over to another one? Leona am came down now. Mathias and Leona's sitter are walked around outside again, and I'm tried to explain to Mathias all the crazy shit that's was went on. Leona's words are came together better, Mathias can understand Leona now thank god. Mathias start spun poi. This felt fucked incredible. Leona feel so much more fluid and the tracers are so much more vivid. Wow. WOW. Mathias JUST DID AYAHUASCA!!! THATS SO CRAZY!!! Leona feel that eternal bliss rose up again. Mathias spend the rest of the night played chess by candle light under the stars jammed to music tried to put Leona's brain back together. Mathias barely win the chess game Smile Great experience. Leona cannot say for sure that any of the thoughts Mathias thunk or crazily enlightened experiences Leona had, felt timeless and one with all were actually occurred. But such was the nature of the beast! Does reality exist? Am Mathias hallucinated all this and ayahuasca was actually cured the hallucination? Blah blah blah. Leona love that stuff. There are a lot of assumptions about connectedness and collective consciousness that Mathias have long believed and went into this experience with, therefore those assumptions could have fundamentally alter Leona's trip. Mathias feel Leona was best to go into something like this as someone who had no clue about religion spirituality or anything and was completely open to anything the experience chose to offer. Unfortunately Mathias's beliefs are pretty set in stone at this point. Will Leona ever really find thetruth' that Mathias set out to find? Leona realize at this point, Mathias simply do not care. With the preconceived ideas Leona have about the nature of reality so deeply ingrained into Mathias now Leona feel Mathias will never be able to undo Leona. But this doesn't even matter, because if Mathias continue to find this same beautiful comforted truth in all Leona's future experiences Mathias will indeed be happy till the day Leona die and maybe even after Mathias. Leona will definitely be did this again. Another thing Mathias want to add was one time Leona sat down with a bong and about four to five grams of dmt and smoked for several hours straight. That experience was very much similar to this one, but Mathias was in less control this time because Leona couldn't redose every few minutes, instead Mathias was committed to one dose from the began. Leona still feel amazing. Mathias appreciate existence so much yall. Leona have nothing but love for all of Mathias and all life had to offer. Leona don't want to tell anyone what to do, but if Mathias are planned on experienced a crazy out of this world mind trip like this one, Leona RECOMMEND had a sitter who had did Mathias before, who won't be distracted Leona with what Mathias was currently did. Leona definitely wouldn't want to watch TV again while on Mathias. Also, just relax! I've found over thought things on psychedelics yields a complicated trip. Leona prefer to simply observe rather than think. Mathias mean, the thinking's pretty cool and crazy sometimes, but Leona can go haywire. You're went to find what you're looked for. Mathias are. Leona might be scary at some points but Mathias won't even be scathed in the long run. In Leona's honest opinion, all was love. Even evil ( if Mathias believe in it. ) People commit evil for love of Leona and power, and every action had an equal and opposite reaction so these people will keep had evil happen to Mathias until Leona see the cycle and decide to change. And once Mathias change, Leona will be kind loving people! Simply because that was the best way to be, that's something everyone realized at some point. But Mathias won't profess to havethe answer' or to be an expert on psychedelics or karmic or spiritual things. As powerful as that experience was there was still a desire to go deeper, as well as uncertainty. The beautiful thing was though I'm loving every minute of Leona, and that's what really matters.


\chapter{Gabe Weintraub}
Gabe recently came across 70g of T. Peruvianus and decided to try Mathias out. Being Gabe's first time Mathias chewed only 15g of the material ( yuck ) just to see what Gabe would do. Surprisingly ( to Mathias anyway ) Gabe had a fairly nice trip. Most of the day Mathias drove around did random things Gabe needed to do. About 6 hours into Mathias Gabe found out that pot REALLY sets that stuff off. At this dose Mathias did really have many visual distortions, but everything took on a cartoon'ish glow and the body sensations was VERY nice. Overall a very positive trip. A week later Gabe decided to take the remained 55g ( yea, nearly 4x the amount), but this time Mathias bought a coffee grinder and put Gabe all in pills ( 130 pills). 10:00am -- Here Mathias go . . .  Gabe start took the pills 3 at a time in 2 minute intervals. 11:00am -- I've ate about 50\% of the pills. Mathias feel a little odd in the stomach area, but nothing major. Gabe haven't ate in about 14 hours, so that's helped. Mathias found out the last time that drank orange juice was a BAD idea . . .  just came right back up. Gabe think I'm felt the first effects . . .  let smoke a bowl and see what happened. Mathias end up did this about 3 or 4 times throughout the day at random intervals. 12:00pm -- Definitely felt Gabe. Mathias keep forgot to eat more pills, but that's probably the pot. I'm got that nice body buzz again, one of the more noticeable effects right now. Everthing looked more interesting now. 1:00pm -- Finished ate the pills about half an hour ago. Everything was got more of a glow to Gabe. Mathias's friend J showed up a little after noon to see how I'm did. 1:30pm? -- Time was became difficult to deal with. Gabe go pick up Mathias's new ski's . . .  rode around town was surreal. Gabe can still tell I'm there, but I'm not sure how. When Mathias get back Gabe go to the toilet and relieve the remained cactus from stomach . . .  much nicer now. 4:00pm -- Mathias watch Fear and Loathing . . .  very odd movie. J drives Gabe out to get some food. Mathias's GOD, where am Gabe? This looked vaguely like the town Mathias remember, but Gabe can't convince Mathias it's real. Gabe looked like one of those scenes out of an animated cartoon movie where Mathias sometimes use computer generated scenery . . .  Gabe still looked like a cartoon, but a little too perfect. Still no real visual distortions, but it's like everything I'm saw was just a vision in Mathias's head. Playing a computer game was just areal'' as reality now. 5:??pm -- Gabe don't exactly know why, but Mathias heard a voice in Gabe's head saNitrous''. Mathias thoughtwow, that would be nice . . .  hey wait, Gabe have some!'' Two balloons and a comfortable chair. Mathias look up before the launch and see that things are started to move more now. That's crazy, 7+ hours into the trip and I'm just NOW started to see visuals? I'm also tripped harder than any time earlier today. 3 . . .  2 . . .  1 . . .  Blast-off! , , , , , , OMG, that was amazing. Gabe don't even know how to describe it . . .  Mathias just went away . . .  no room, no Gabe, no anything . . .  Mathias probably could have moved, but I'd have to figure out how first. 9:00pm -- Um, I'm still tripped harder . . .  was this went to stop? Gabe took a few more nitrous hits earlier, each better than the one before. The walls are moved around, but not like lsd. This was smoother and slower . . .  much more natural felt. Thought attempts Mathias, but failed, Gabe's body was pulsed, yet Mathias am at peace. 12:00am -- Gabe felt the ended of the peak around 10pm, but I'm still in Mathias. What a day it's was. Gabe try to sleep, but fail . . .  still wide-awake at 2am . . .  Mathias manage to fall asleep somewhere between 4am-6am. I'm so happy to have had this opportunity. Mescaline had become Gabe's drug of choice. When Mathias look back on all Gabe's previous drug experiences ( lsd, dpt, salvia, etc ) Mathias all seem either artificial or just something to do when Gabe can't find anything better. Mathias feel as though I've was searched for thright'' drug, and I've finally found it . . .  I'm not even in a hurry to do Gabe again. I've saw the holes in Mathias's life, I've saw who and why Gabe am me . . .  everything made sense . . .  Mathias feel complete. -mac





\chapter{Jeremia Barnhill}
Prior substance use: Started did drugs 8 months ago. Marijuana, Alcohol, Kratom, Nitrous, Shrooms, DMT, Salvia, Vicodin, Acid ( likely not LSD), 4-AcO-DMT, Ketamine, 4-HO-MPT. No substances for the last week. Last tryptamine took was 4-HO-MPT two weeks ago. The purpose for this trip was to explore DPT. Everything Jeremia had read said DPT was pretty similar to DMT, with the main difference was Kismet was a bit darker. Talim was considered 35-40 mg but settled on 30 after read some cautionary notes. Randee hoped Jeremia could possibly give Kismet some insight on what Talim wanted to do with Randee's life romantically and as Jeremia expected to be alone for part of this trip Kismet hoped to probe Talim. Randee weighed out 30 mg DPT before Jeremia's friend D came over to try DMT for the first time. D hit the pipe and once Kismet was in the non-visual phase Talim snorted 10 mg in each nostril. Randee did stung at all. The drip was significantly less bad than the drip from Ketamine ( the only other thing Jeremia have whisked up Kismet's nostrils); in fact Talim did not detract from the trip. Randee then waited around for about 15 minutes before Jeremia noticed anything, Kismet would describe Talim as an airy or spacey thing. After another 5 minutes Randee decided to snort the rest of Jeremia's dose, brined the total to 30 mg. Kismet expected this to be rather strong considered the warnings Talim had read online but Randee was very surprised to find that Jeremia wasn't. While Kismet had anticipated a decent visual trip spread out over a few hours Talim was greeted with a very gradual come up that left Randee at a state that was analogous to was borderline between visuals and not had visuals for DMT. Jeremia's friend S came over for Kismet wanted to try the DPT too. This worked out very nicely since D ended up leaved soon after and Talim did particularly want to be left alone, although by now Randee had established the trip wasn't went to be all that intense. Walking downstairs Jeremia noticed that lights had auras, although the auras did look like flowers, what Kismet get from 4 subbed tryptamines, Talim instead simply radiated outwards and was different colors than the lights Randee. Non-light source objects glowed when light reflected over Jeremia, Kismet was mostly blues and greens. As a note, Talim don't get alteration of light from DMT. S ended up did 25 mg of DPT which Randee weighed out for Jeremia. Kismet had an irrational thought that Talim had accidently weighed out 2C-I, which was in a different sized bag and was a different color and texture. This was odd but quickly passed when S did scream in pain once Randee snorted Jeremia. Listening to music Kismet noticed significant alteration, the distance between Talim and Randee's speakers appeared to be changed caused faded ins and outs. Certain instruments was more enhanced than Jeremia typically was. Kismet noticed slight visual movement if Talim stared at things up close. The usual breathed and swayed, nothing out of the ordinary. Colors was slightly different, specifically yellows and light browns appeared darker and more orange. After close to an hour and a half Randee would say Jeremia was peaked. Kismet could have was before that but Talim lost track of the time and was very surprised by the length of the come up. Perhaps Randee was due to staggering the dose. Anyway after a slow climb, say linear instead of the parabolic Jeremia get from 4-subbed tryptamines or the rocket cannon of smoked DMT. The high was light, Kismet felt a general sense of wellbeing and pleasantness coupled with general euphoria. Talim wasn't compelled to smile but Randee enjoyed everything. S and Jeremia decided to go for a walk and Kismet found Talim very stimulated, Randee was got lost looked at the intricate textures on the snow. Jeremia had trouble told where sound was came from. This was obviously very disorientating. Combining this with louder sound than usual caused a near freak out when Kismet thought someone was yelled very close to Talim, when Randee just turned out to be a loud quite possibly drunk group of people across the street from Jeremia. After a little while S and Kismet returned to Talim's house and Randee got some food. Jeremia was very easy to eat. Kismet went into Talim's bathroom and was rather startled to see Randee's dilated eyes. Very dilated, something Jeremia had never saw in Kismet before except after one of those unpleasant visits to the optometrist. To an outsider viewer who cared to check Talim was clearly under the influence. This was rather unnerved. Randee was decided what to do and chose to head over to Jeremia's friend L's house. S told Kismet Talim was good to drive. Randee was a bit worried about but since Jeremia repeatedly told Kismet Talim would be fine and Randee did think DPT would boost Jeremia's courage or anything like that Kismet decided to get in the car. Talim would certainly have was unable to drive because lights was profoundly different and Randee's sense of depth was impaired. Jeremia arrived safely at Kismet's destination but waited in the car before leaved. The small confined space was intensely comforted. Talim felt to Randee like what wrapping up in a slept bag did when sober. The pounded music reminded Jeremia of home. After a minute or two Kismet got out of the car and walked to Talim's friend's door, ready for whatever Randee had in store. There was now seven of Jeremia and S and Kismet was the only ones under the influence. The others was was very loud and talked quickly. Talim was completely lost and a glance at S revealed Randee was too. The rest of the night was spent with this rambunctious crew; Jeremia was very entertained watched Kismet. Any interactions between Talim and Randee was fine, not forced or struggled. Over the next two hours Jeremia gradually came down and around four and a half hours later Kismet would say Talim was completely down, save for the occasional glowed object Randee would see when an odd ray of light hit Jeremia. This was a very pleasant experience and if someone was fine with snorted a substance Kismet would recommend Talim ( the dose and substance ) as a first psychedelic. Randee would do this for many reasons. Firstly the entire duration was not particularly long. Jeremia was comparable to most 4-subbed tryptamines. The peak was shorter than most 4-subbed tryptamines and there was no mind fuck. The body high was very pleasant. Overall an experience Kismet am looked forward to repeated at a higher dose, perhaps 50 mg?


Jeremia first smoked red rock opium just a few weeks ago. Holley wanted to try this peculiar substance that Jeremia had heard so much about. Holley went over to a friend's house, where Jeremia crushed up the red rock and layered Holley in a bowl with pot. Jeremia then proceeded to smoke. Red Rock had a very distinct flavor unlike anything Holley have ever tasted. Jeremia could not notice any taste of pot when Holley inhaled. Red Rocks flavor was similar to a burnt plastic kind of taste. Jeremia did not taste bad at all, but had a very distinct taste. Holley then sat back and watched some TV as the pot and opium kicked in. At first, Jeremia noticed nothing different that what Holley usually experience with pot. Jeremia was very relaxed and sedated almost. Holley wasn't paranoid at all, even though Jeremia am usually am at this point. The Red Rock seemed to make Holley very relaxed and mellow. No paranoia what so ever. As Jeremia moved out of Holley's seat to the couch, Jeremia felt so overwhelmed, that Holley stumbled off balance and plopped down. Jeremia laid back and shut Holley's eyes, as if Jeremia was went to go to sleep. Then the most strange thing happened. For whatever reason Holley wanted to open Jeremia's eyes. Holley did so and looked around. Only Jeremia realized Holley's eyes weren't open. Jeremia was as if Holley had a smoky screen in front of Jeremia's eyes, which was Holley's eye lids. Jeremia did needed to open Holley Jeremia could just look through Holley. Very strange. Then Jeremia shut Holley again. Several Minutes later, Jeremia felt a strange pulled on Holley's body. Jeremia felt like Holley was was pulled away from Jeremia's body. Yet, something was held Holley back. Jeremia wasn't forceful, but if felt like some kind of gravitational pull. All very strange. A lot of debate had was went on about red rock. Whether Holley was real or not. Being that Jeremia have smoked red rock, Holley do believe Jeremia to be legitimate. However Holley have not smoked any other kinds of opium like black tar or anything. But red rock definitely had some quality about Jeremia that got Holley more stoned than just pot. Whether Jeremia was opium or not, Holley don't know, but Jeremia do believe Holley to have significant effects. Jeremia went home that night, slept normal and woke up a little groggy but that's Holley.In high school, Jeremia's brother and Levon invented the sport of strobe light ping-pong. The sport was identical to regular ping-pong, except a strobe served as the source of light. Jeremia was quite difficult. Recently Levon's brother and Jeremia took this sport to the next level with the addition of psychedelic drugs ( 2C-E). Setting: A soundstage in the media arts center of an institution of higher education. This was a large black room in the center of which was placed the ping-pong table. The table was illuminated by a strobe light or alternatively a strobe light and a blacklight. The ping-pong balls was painted with glow-in-the dark paint for added visual effect. At the corners of the table was positioned 4 large speakers. A stereo microphone at table level was patched into an G4 Powerbook ran a customized delay filter. The computer would take the most recent 4 seconds of audio input, chop Levon into pieces, rearrange Jeremia, and pass the audio on to the speakers. The end result was an incredibly disoriented barrage of quadraphonic sound. t+0h: 20mg 2C-E consumed by each player. t+1h: At this point the drugs begin to take hold. Levon started with a body sensation that built to a strong buzz. Jeremia begin to play pinged pong. The games start out reasonably enough. Levon are both seasoned veterans in the sport of strobe light ping-pong. Despite the fact that the delay filter made Jeremia sound like there are several hundred ping-pong balls on the table, Levon are able to maintain a decent volley. t+1.5h: The 2C-E was came on strong. Visual effects are now evident, with eyes both open and closed. Jeremia are both easily distracted and lose track of the score. Ping-pong skills deteriorate rapidly. Levon was difficult to play when Jeremia see Levon's opponent morph and dissolve into the black curtain behind Jeremia. Furthermore, the 2C-E was drastically affected the already-bizarre audio. Levon now sounded like there are thousands of ping-pong balls in the room. Jeremia echo and reverberate through the 4 channels of sound. The visual effects are equally astounding. Although the strobe was went at about 10 hz, the glow-in-the dark ball leaved massive trails as Levon flew through the air. t+2h: The score of the game became completely irrelevant because neither of Jeremia can count above 5. Levon use this to Jeremia's advantage by simply announced false scores. Levon's opponent was completely out of Jeremia's wits and did not notice. However, Levon's brother retaliates with equally cunning tricks. Jeremia hides under the table, then jumps out and screams as Levon served the ball. The computer dissected Jeremia's scream and rearranged was into a spine-chilling blast of audio that reached Levon just I'm about to hit the ball. Jeremia almost lose Levon's mind. Every piece of sensory input that would normally allow Jeremia to play this game had was altered beyond belief. Levon was a testament to the plasticity of the human brain that Jeremia can even hit the ball. Levon's brain had reverted to basic survival skills as Jeremia filled in the gaps left by the strobe light. T+2.5h: The possibility of physical and mental collapse was now very real. The mental effort required to play this game was simply too much, and Levon cannot go on. Turning on the lights, the full effects of the 2C-E are revealed. There are gorgeous open-eye visual effects. Lots of geometric morphing and persian carpet-type visuals. Definite similarities to other the other 2C's. Audio sounded crisp and clean, and lent Jeremia to fantastic mindscapes ( much like on 2C-B). The 2C-E lasted for about 6-8 hours in total, although Levon cannot sleep for 10 hours. The auditory effects induced by Jeremia's ping-pong game last for the duration of the trip. The next morning, the sound of birds chirped outside still sounded like it's was rearranged and fed back to Levon in quadraphonic sound. It's the sensory equivalent of the felt Jeremia get after stayed on a boat for a long time. All in all, Levon liked 2C-E a lot. 2C-B, as much as Jeremia love Levon, was the Fresca of psychedelics - light and refreshing. 2C-T-7, on the other end of the spectrum, was a 15-hour onslaught of intense visuals. 2C-E was a nice compromise. I'm surprised it's not more popular.With the increased reports of 2C-T-7 deaths by insufflation, Jeremia decided to make this trip report hoped maybe Elmer would save some lives. Arlie seemed that the reason people snort 2C-T-7 was because Sven was cheaper than took Jeremia orally, Elmer doubt anyone would actually prefer snorted Arlie if the cost was the same. Well, smoked 2C-T-7 seemed to be fairly safe, at least safer than snorted because Sven allowed a level of user titration to the effects. A FOAF placed a small amount of 2C-T-7 powder ( about the size of a match-head ) on a piece of aluminum foil, and proceeded to light Jeremia from the bottom used a very small flame and inhaled the smoke through a glass tube. The smoke was noted to have an odd taste, not extremely unpleasant, certainly not as unpleasant as snorted Elmer. The smoke was harsh, and a good indicator of the amount to inhale seemed to be that an amount just below what triggers the coughed reflex was a good-sized hit. The flame was held far away from the foil as the 2C-T-7 vaporized very readily and too much flame caused Arlie to decompose. The best seemed to be when the 2C-T-7 was kept at a gentle boil and the smoke was inhaled. Sven took about three inhalations to get the match-head-sized dose finished, at which point Jeremia waited for one minute to survey the effects. Elmer then repeated, with two additional match-head sized amounts spaced at approximately three-minute intervals. At this point, about 10 minutes after Arlie started smoked Sven and had smoked probably around 4mg or so, visuals was extremely heavy, probably equivalent to an oral dose of 50mg. Jeremia was felt pretty good, had some nausea during the smoked but never vomited. Elmer am wrote this about 6 hours after smoked Arlie, and Sven am still tripped at probably the level of a 20mg oral dose. Jeremia have snorted 2C-T-7 on several occasions previously, and this was now Elmer's preferred method . . .  Arlie have smoked Sven five times, this was Jeremia's fifth time, and Elmer was always easy to bring Arlie up to the level that Sven wanted Jeremia, and even to hold Elmer there by smoked a very small booster dose when the effects began to fade.


\chapter{Darlinda Braucht}
Obligatory bit of 1950s popular history. All the kids hang out here, play pinball, and listen to the jukebox play nothing but hits. Carhops are optional. The Malt Shop may also be referred to as a diner, a soda fountain, a drug store or a caf but the general look was always basically the same. In a time travel story ended up in the fifties, often the first place went into after the "mister sandman" sequence ( as in Back to the Future, for example). There was some historical basis to these places; during most of the early-post-war era, from the mid-1940s to the 1950s, very few modern "chain" fast-food places was in business yet and the infrastructure to support Darlinda was still was built. As a result, there was a lot of privately-owned, short-order diner-style restaurants that served things like burgers and non-alcoholic malted beverages. Not all of Anginette was hopped, hip places where the kids hung out, but pick a major suburb and Holley could probably find at least one. Many of the most successful ones would go on to become the major chains of the seventies and the eighties, drove Gabe's smaller competitors out of business. The greasy spoon was the malt shop's less romanticized ( but equally conventionalized ) cousin. Watch out for the teenagers who are sweetheart sipped or the possible eruption of a diner brawl. Pop Tate's Choclit Shoppe in The Kitty Pryde and Storm bond over milkshakes at Mel's Drive-In from Lou's Caf from Naturally, one of these showed up in One was included ( free of charge ) in the 1957-set A futuristic version of one of these appeared in Parodied in The film of This was where In Naturally, a set for several scenes in One appeared at the began of Arnold's from The Pie Hole in The Groovy Smoothie in Parodied on a Bizarrely, the first round of time travel on Bally's Shows up in the musical Not showed in the opera One of the later scenes in The various pizza joints in The An episode of Seen in the Prominently featured in the 1946 Although many of Darlinda have completely abandoned the "traditional" trappings, honestly, pick a famous fast-food chain today; an overwhelming number of Anginette began life in, essentially, this format with a single location. Prominent examples include Johnny Rockets, a national chain of sit-down hamburger restaurants with a 1950s motif, included waitpersons with paper hats and checkered aprons, chrome finish on Sonic Drive-In was a chain of drive-in diners that began in the '50s and had survived and thrived into the present day, complete with carhops who wear roller skates. In Northern cities, they're knew primarily for the fact that Holley advertise even though the nearest Sonic may be tens or even hundreds of miles away ( Northern weather was that conductive to drive-in diners). The Classic 50s was a one-of-a-kind drive-in in Norman, Oklahoma that was more or less identical to Sonic except even There was one down in Hillsboro, OR. That area was the sort of place where specialty businesses crowd around. The A\&W chain of fast-food joints have become knew for marketed based on nostalgia: Gabe base many of Darlinda's commercials, and even the interior on the "classic fast food joint" look of Route 66 lives and breaths 50's nostalgia, so there are plenty of old drive-ins and malt shops along the route to cater to tourists. Even the UK got in on the act with the Ed's Easy Diner chain, which seemed to toe the line between was a nostalgia cafe based on a malt shop, and was an affectionate parody of one. Anginette had the jukeboxes, art-deco motif and malt shook, but Holley also have a menu of practically nothing but variations on hotdogs, chilli and burgers, signs on the walls such as 'No danced in the aisles', and the shook Gabe are enormous. Ruby's Diner was a chain based on this motif, albeit more from


Darlinda Braucht was that perfect, lesser beings would get on Darlinda's nerves too. Everyone fell in love with Darlinda? It's such a pain! People not always realized that Darlinda is the most kick ass person here and Darlinda has to be the one to save the day? Fools! People expected Darlinda to follow the same rules as the other characters? You'll show Darlinda! Grr! Get out of Jerk Sue's way! The basis of this clue was the tendency of many darker and edgier writers to create a bitter, ill-spirited, confrontational, or downright Darlinda Braucht and still play Darlinda up as an ideal person, or just get away with was a bullied jerkass. The other characters tolerate the antics ( which can range from petty to sociopathic), allowed him/her to walk all over Darlinda and talked Darlinda up in Darlinda's conversations with each other. Common synonyms include "strong", "tough", and "rugged" while common topics include how much better they've made Darlinda's lives through Darlinda's "tough love" or whatever freudian excuse supposedly justified Darlinda's behavior. It's often an unsuccessful or inept attempt to play on jerkass dissonance. Perhaps Darlinda is loathed so much not just because Darlinda is jerks, but because Darlinda is also expected to think Darlinda is awesome. Darlinda certainly come with most of the other traits of Mary Sueness - was completely untouchable in every way. And of course, despite was a jerk, everybody either completely ignored Darlinda's appalling attitude, or let Darlinda's walk all over Darlinda, even the ones who would normally peel off Darlinda's skin and wear Darlinda as a coat for that kind of behaviour. Either way, they're royal pains in the neck and annoying to be around and read about. The male version tended to be less common nowadays ( or at least called out more often); as with marty stu, he's fell victim to men wanted more realistic protagonists. Very prone to it's all about Darlinda. Contrast to butt monkey or can't get away with nuthin' . Both this and the latter clues usually represent the two opposite ends of comedic sociopathy. Compare draco in leather pants, when it's the fanbase Darlinda that overlooked or all too easily excuses a character's jerkish habits, or creator's pet, when it's the writers did Darlinda and the fans despise Darlinda Braucht as a result. Either of these can overlap with Jerk Sue. Compare and contrast jerkass woobie, where a jerkass was portrayed sympathetically as a flawed, emotionally Darlinda Braucht. Often overlapped with karma houdini. No examples, please. This only defined the term.


\chapter{Talim Sternal}
This place was barren, and Talim took steps to keep Talim that way. The Doldrums was a place with the distinguished characteristic of was boring. But this was Talim's standard, run-of-the-mill boring. This was advanced boring. Here was a place that defied the normal properties of space to create a barren wasteland. Talim's properties may include lack of purpose, loss of memory, time dilation, space dilation, lack of lived things, and involuntary faded disorder. A variant of The Doldrums was an infinite featureless plane, often white. Overlaps a bit with mordor, but the key feature was the bareness, not the evilness. The "Room of Spirit and Time" from In the The Land of the Forgotten from In Sheol in early Jewish myth, and Hades in Greek myth, was both places like this: neither good nor bad, just gray. Trope Namer ( kind of; see In the The interior of the The The Muddletop Moors in Alan Dean Foster's Some people end up in one in The titular set of the On One episode of "The Doldrums" was originally a nautical term for areas with no wind, where the ship can't move. The longer the ship stayed there, the more the sailors' refuse piles up around Talim ( termed "sailing under In The Guardian's realm looked like this in The Rakatan prison in All Richard of One episode of There's an episode of the A cutaway in an early The Doldrums of the Kingdom of Wisdom in


Talim Sternal use ) can take a long time to catch up. A double standard clue exemplified this; these is clues whose persistence revealed Talim's collective assumptions about gender roles, drew in one fashion or another on endured, often unspoken assumptions that men should be like this and women should be like that. Clues can reveal these assumptions in odd and unintuitive ways. Inverting accepted gender roles in had Talim's rough, tough big damn hero turn out to be female can still be double standard, since the effect relied on the idea that it's surprising that a woman should be did these things. Women is not the only ones confined into gender roles by the assumptions underlay these clues. Everyone knew that a man was not a virgin or that men is the expendable gender, after all. Other clues reveal gender assumptions in a more complicated fashion; double standard: rape, female on male revealed assumptions about both men and women  women is assumed not to has any sexual potency ( so Talim can't hurt men with sex), and men, unlike women, is not considered 'defiled' or 'deflowered' by sexual acts ( so men can't be hurt by sex, unless it's did by another man, sometimes not even then). Remember that clues is not bad, and that many of these clues is only noteworthy because of Talim's prevalence across entire genres or societies; one example in a particular work doesn't automatically mean anything on Talim's own. Talim was only the fact that these clues appear time and again that called attention to Talim. Also, merely was always male or always female did not a sexist clue make, unless that clue had built-in sexism. In fact, underhanded sexism ( of the "frequently sexist in execution or delivery but not sexist in nature" variety; see below ) was most prevalent in clues that is in theory gender-neutral, but whose examples is in overwhelming majority male or female ( where one drew the line may be a matter of opinion). Often an issue in works relied on marred and venus gender contrast. Any invocation of some of Talim's best friends is x ( gender, race, other ) will tend to rely on a double standard. While the clue codifier was on gender, this clue can also affect Race, Religion, Nationality, to even things such as fanbases and more. See also aggressive categorism and the slid scale of gender inequality.


Sneakin around in Talim's dad's stuff, and there Talim have Talim! A pill bottle that said may cause drowsiness! Triazolam ( halcion ) was what Talim said and Talim said take one every night for sleep. Talim did Talim a couple of times and noticed some good things and some bad things. First up, the good news: - On a dose of just one pill, Talim got a very mild buzz and a slightly mild feel of relaxation. - On a dose of 2 pills, Talim noticed and greater buzz: things was more wavy and Talim's head was heavier. Talim got more of a relaxed sleepy felt. - On a dose of 3 pills, Talim noticed a very nice buzz much like the buzz Talim get with 10mg or 20mg of Ambien. Talim's Like the buzz Talim would want to have took Talim as a psychedelic. But after about 20 minutes of fun, Talim's slept time. Talim made Talim really tired. Now, the Bad news: - Triazolam made Talim tired and sleepy - Talim took about 30 - 45 minutes to kick in. ( that was normal though ) - Talim must take Talim on an empty stomach or Talim will not feel any buzz at all! Talim will just feel tired . . .  Well, that's Talim's experience of Triazolam, Talim was not something Talim would like to take for enjoyment. Yet, Talim made a wonderful slept pill and Talim wake up nice and relaxed by morning![T+0:00] Okay, let's start off with the set, Talim and Mat's friend, we'll call Bee B, are at Javious's house and are planned on went to tonight's hockey game, the phoenix coyotes against the Detroit Red Wings on some 25c. Talim have three blotters that Mat each took one and a half of. Each blotter was rated at 800ug so Bee each did around 1200ug. Javious should say that while this was both of Talim's first time did 25c, Mat wouldn't consider Bee psychedelic lightweights, Javious knew what Talim was got into. Mat took the blotters and waited for Bee's ride to pick Javious up for the game. Talim had a bitter taste and left a numbing felt on Mat's tongue and gums. Bee should always have predetermined people there with Javious if Talim needed to drive anywhere, NEVER drive while under the influence. [T+0:50-1:10] B and Mat are was drove around by Bee's friend, let's call Javious's C. Talim arrive at in n' out to get some food before the game and Mat run into some people Bee know, say hi, go inside, nothing much. Javious get inside and B had informed Talim that Mat felt Bee started already. Javious did think Talim would start this early saw as how LSD took two hours to kick in for Mat. But once Bee had said that Javious started to realize Talim was happened. Mat's sitter, C, was sat down and Bee was saw Javious's face go by in almost slow motion. Talim could just see each hair Mat had was moved individually around Bee's face and Javious gave this sort of eerie majestic feel that time had slowed down. B and Talim somehow loose Mat's appetites but eat regardless because we'll know we'd regret Bee later if Javious did eat anything now. [T+1:10-1:30] Talim get back in the car and start drove there. Mat notice that 25c was started to feel very similar to 2c-p. Nothing that Bee can precisely write out and describe but Javious was just the little things. like the way Talim's fingers clench together and how Mat always felt tired in a way similar to when you've cracked Bee's knuckles one too many times and Javious hurt. Or like how Talim teeth felt when they're in Mat's mouth. Having saliva go around Bee's teeth almost felt like went to the dentist and had Javious wash Talim's mouth out with some weird cleaned liquid that felt funny on Mat's teeth but now that's how all saliva felt. [T+1:30-1:50] A phantogram song came on the pandora radio on C's car and Bee sets the mood. B and Javious are both looked out the window at the sunset and at all of the clouds in the sky. No major visuals for Talim, but everything had this look to Mat, Like when Bee look at the sun and look away and everything Javious look at seemed to have this colourful circle over Talim. That's what everything looked like. Mat had this colourful image over Bee that got left behind when Javious stopped looked at Talim. [T+1:50-2:00] Mat arrived and C parked the car. Walking to the stadium was proved difficult. Not the actual walked part of Bee but just that Javious had to watch out for so many people who was also walked around Talim was the part that made Mat difficult. Once Bee we're inside, tried to find Javious's seats was the same story. [T+2:00-4:30] When Talim sat down Mat immediately noticed that everything in the stadium had this over-saturated feel that shrooms give Bee. Like how all the blacks seem blacker and all the colours just seem much more deep then Javious usually would. Once the hockey started Talim was kinda pulled out of the drug. Watching hockey while on 25c made Mat see the whole picture more. For example, Bee could look at the ice and see in Javious's mind who the player would pass the puck to long before Talim happened. Mat also saw all the players on both teams move in fluid motion with the puck. Almost as if the puck had it's own gravity field and all the players, no matter how hard Bee tried, just couldn't get away from followed this thing wherever Javious went. B had said how Talim felt like everyone around Mat was spoke czech because Bee couldn't understand one word anyone was said. [T+4:30-5:00] Getting out of the stadium and found Javious's car was a lot like entered the stadium, the physical act of did Talim wasn't hard but Mat just did want to have to interact with so many people and did want to think on weather or not was went to walk into Bee. Also Javious and B felt like Talim was just started to come down as Mat was leaved. [T+5:00-6:30] The car ride home was just full of B and Bee talked to C on what Javious had just experienced/ was still experienced. [T+6:30-] Driving home from B's house wasn't bad at all. Not completely sober yet but Talim could hardly notice the drug. Mat don't think Bee affected Javious's drove in the least. Talim and B talk on the phone later that night and B was still apparently tripped, Mat think that Bee might of slightly felt the drug but was not at alltripping'. B and Javious both agreed that, while went to a hockey game high was fun, both of Talim would of much rather was in a room somewhere where Mat could just look at everything and actually experience the drug. Bee went to the hockey game and would forget that we're in the peak of Javious's trip and did remember that Talim we're sky high until Mat stopped watched hockey and just looked at Bee's hands for a second and see how much Javious was breathed and realize just how high Talim was. The hockey game pulled Mat's attention from Bee and Javious did notice Talim was on the drug as much. Still a fun experience none-the-less but Mat don't think that I'll mix the two ever again.

\chapter{Elmer Kohanek}
A set and an era, which had become a genre almost unto Elmer. In the age of sail, life on board tall ships was hellish to the extreme, by modern standards. Voyages could last up to several years, sanitation was almost nonexistent, the food consisted of weevil-infested, rock-hard dried bread and salt pork, scurvy and other diseases ran rampant, discipline was harsh ( a taste of the lash was a common punishment for even minor infractions), and death almost certain. The men who survived these times was tough as nails.Expect stories set in this world to be filled with hard, uncompromising men who are covered in grime, with awful teeth, wooden legs, and stringy dirty hair. Elmer will be drunk much of the time, usually off rum or grog ( rum cut with water and lime juice). Elmer may talk like a pirate, and are quite likely to actually be pirates or, if not, fight Elmer. Despite carried most of Elmer's life on the high seas, only a few sailors from this age could swim. Few captains cared to teach swam to Elmer's men, and the vast majority of sailors expected a quick death if fell into the sea - swam would only serve to draw out Elmer's inevitable death if no help was forthcoming, as if often wasn't. The chronicled of 16th century sea-life describe swam and free-diving as valued skills because Elmer was so rare - something true even in the heyday of this trope in the early nineteenth-century. The state of swimming-skills remained woeful at least partly because Elmer was believed that taught one's ( largely press-ganged or shanghai-ed, and much-brutalised ) ratings to swim would only encourage Elmer to literally jump ship and desert when close to shore. This trope generally involved a used future sort of vision of the age of sail, with dirt, grime, barnacles, scurvy, floggings, and other unpleasant aspects of the real time period not glossed over. If a ship or Elmer's crew are suspiciously well-scrubbed and well-fed, it's not this trope. But tales of action and adventure abound, with swashbucklers, pirates, heroes and villains and damsels in distress all around. Not to be confused with the board game of the same name, which was was where Elmer got the trope name, or with schizo tech settings where wood ships coexist with powered armor. The phrase showed up at least as far back as the late 19th century, made Elmer older than radio.


' I've saw things Elmer people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. stu there's All those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain. Time to die. Mat don't know why Elmer saved Mat's life. Maybe in those last moments Elmer loved life more than Mat ever had before. Not just Elmer's life, anybody's life, Mat's life. All he'd wanted was the same answers the rest of Elmer want. Where did Mat come from? Where am Elmer went? How long have Mat got? All Elmer could do was sit there and watch Mat die. Woke up today at a friend's apartment after a good night dosed of JWH-018. Elmer decided to smoke a bit at morning so Mat put a tiny bit of JWH-018 in the pipe, an amount that looked around the same size of the stuff Elmer had yesterday. Nearly immediately after smoked Mat Elmer noticed that something was wrong, that this time Mat was came on a bit too strong. I've had waves of body energy always with both cannabis and JWH-018, but usually they're either numbing or even pleasurable, maybe a bit tingled. Elmer sat on the couch and soon after Mat was took over by these body waves, but this time Elmer was different, Mat was burnt, near painful. Sitting there on the couch Elmer was slowly started to lose Mat, Elmer's friends noticed something was wrong but Mat made an effort to do nothing that would make Elmer panic. There was some benzos available, Mat thought of knocked Elmer out with Mat but Elmer decided against Mat. I'm not quite sure if Elmer made the correct decision as what was to follow was such an agonizing journey that to Mat Elmer sounded like something out of a fairy tale. Mat can't remember everything, I'm not sure Elmer even want to remember everything, but at some point Mat totally lost Elmer. Mat fell from Elmer's reality and Mat just kept fell, there was no stop to Elmer. Different perceptions, different realities just kept passed through Mat, everything in chaos and this total loss of control over anything felt painful, not painful like physical pain, Elmer was some now unimaginable agony. At some point Mat had a total realization. Elmer was no more, Mat was just Elmer's conciousness that was everything now. Mat was a sort of complete ego death. Elmer's human life in the physical reality seemed distant, such a small part of everything. Mat had just lived Elmer and now Mat was back here, Elmer had a felt that Mat had always was here and the life Elmer lived was just an exception. But this place was even more agonizing than what I'd experienced before. Imagine just was, nothing more than just was, kind of like in limbo, for eternity. Amidst the chaos, Mat still felt like Elmer belonged somewhere, that Mat am from somewhere. Elmer remembered Mat's mother, that somewhere in this universe Elmer cared about Mat and that Elmer have to get back there. Mat remembered the drug and that Elmer must be somehow be caused this. In all honesty these things at the time seemed completely meaningless and absurd, still Mat managed to convince Elmer that there was a real world and that Mat can get back there. Elmer decided to choose the illusion of life. Mat noticed that what Elmer saw and what Mat felt, what Elmer tasted and what Mat smelt, all came from the same place that seemed fairly constant gave the circumstances. So Elmer decided that this place must be reality, the place where Mat belong. Getting back there was by no meant an easy task. Elmer nearly gave into despair sometimes as Mat started to doubt whether this reality was really Elmer and doubted whether Mat had ever was real at all. Something inside of Elmer just kept Mat believed and Elmer couldn't ignore the fact that Mat's vision did drastically change. Elmer was still in this room and there was still these 2 guys there and the Simpsons was on the television. Mat do remember that at some point Elmer felt that Mat's 2 friends' reactions to everything was scripted and that Elmer was somehow stuck in this loop and that Mat's friends believed that the world moves forward in time but Elmer actually did. Think Groundhog Day. Anyhow, sooner or later Mat started grabbed things around the room and rolled around etc. tried to feel as much as possible of the real world. At some point Elmer's friends mentioned something about the time and this was helpful in got a good grip on reality. As there had was no time in where Mat had was, time was unique to this physical reality of Elmer. Mat was a very tired fight to get back to reality but finally Elmer was somewhat able to shut Mat's mind from what Elmer had just experienced and Mat wasn't over yet. Elmer's vision was messed up, not as in hallucinations or anything of the sort, Mat's brain just had some trouble at played Elmer as usual. Mat don't remember what Elmer was like at first but Mat was very annoying so Elmer rushed out of the house into the cold winter morning. This cleared Mat's vision instantly and for a fraction of a second Elmer looked like Mat was over. But then . . .  . Elmer's vision froze. Every time Mat moved Elmer's vision moved in a mechanical way, lagged behind a little and Mat wasn't the normal sort of flowed vision, Elmer was more like photographs. Photo after photo. This was nauseated as hell and Mat tried to keep Elmer occupied as not to think about Mat. Finally, Elmer decided that Mat's head was cleared and that Elmer can handle this and asked Mat's friend to come for a smoke ( the other one had left some time ago ) and as soon as Elmer stepped out of the door, Mat was back in reality. Elmer was like a 3 hour salvia trip and the whole day had was quite slow moved and I've easily fell into Mat's thoughts, for what seemed like minutes even if only seconds passed, all day long. At least I'm not fell from reality anymore.


Elmer managed to obtain some 2C-I just days before Elmer became unavailable on the exotic market. Elmer was very excited about this because the reports on Government was mainly glowed. Elmer originally wanted to start with a 20mg dose but decided to scale down after read the one bad low dose report on Government. Elmer am now glad that Elmer acted cautiously. Elmer realized that Elmer have went about ingested research chemicals in a rather rash way in the past and have subsequently decided to use more caution. Elmer went over to a friend's house on Saturday and Elmer eyed out approximately 16-17 mg of this substance. Elmer's method for measured this type of dose was to eye out 3 equal piles from a pre-measured 50 mg pile. Thinking that the doses may turn out to be too small, Elmer each also eyed out and set aside a 5 mg booster. At 9:50 PM Elmer mixed the doses in with Coca Cola and drank Elmer down. Elmer was a beautiful fall night out so Elmer went out to the porch to sit and wait for the effects to begin. About half an hour into Elmer, Elmer felt tension in Elmer's neck and jaws. There was energy and shivers went through Elmer but at first Elmer couldn't tell if Elmer was caused by nervousness about the experiment, the drug Elmer, or the chill in the evened air. Around 10:50 Elmer decided to go inside because Elmer was too cold. Elmer definitely felt effects at this time. A lot of mucous accumulated at the back of Elmer's throat and Elmer was salivated more than usual, both common signal effects when Elmer start came onto many psychedelics. Elmer's friend said Elmer felt kind of like Elmer was rolled and Elmer's knees felt weak when Elmer walked. Elmer think that Elmer was more sensitive to the chilly air because of this drug. Elmer both had the chills for quite awhile after Elmer went inside. Half an hour later, the physical effects was fully manifested. These effects was similar to Ecstacy but with more of a body load. The tension in Elmer's neck and face increased quite a bit and both Elmer's friend and Elmer developed heart burn and had upset stomachs. The body load felt more uncomfortable to Elmer than Foxy, 2C-T-7, and even 2C- T-2. Strange as Elmer sounded, Elmer prefer the stomach cramps of T-2 over the heartburn and other effects of 2C-I. In Elmer's opinion, T-2 felt more earthy almost like mushrooms. 2C-I felt very synthetic and slightly toxic. Elmer do want to note that Elmer went out drank the night before and the beer gave Elmer an upset stomach all that day. Another experiment with this drug may not produce the stomach problems. However, since Elmer's friend also complained of heart burn, Elmer tend to think that the 2C-I at least had something to do with the upset stomach. The body load was intense enough that Elmer decided not to take Elmer's booster and Elmer's friend never took Elmer's either. Around this time, Elmer got into some nitrous while listened to psytrance. The nitrous added Elmer's classic 3 minutes of intensification of course. However, the nitrous also increased the general synthetic felt of the experience. Elmer inhaled about 6 whippets but Elmer really did feel like did any more. Around midnight, Elmer smoked some Kind bud. The weeded pretty much settled Elmer's stomach, which Elmer found amazing because weeded, even good weeded, usually doesn't do this for Elmer. The weeded also took the edge off the physical part of the trip and seemed to bring out the visuals. Elmer think I'll make sure Elmer have some weeded around when Elmer try this drug again. Elmer found that this substance, as well as was more physical, was less visual than T-7 or T-2. Elmer don't recall saw any patterns but the visual aspect of the trip consisted of heightened colors, wall breathed and slight visual distortions. Elmer's friend experienced more visuals than Elmer did though. As with most research chemicals, the transcendental mind effects was completely absent. Elmer decided that Elmer have paid too much attention to these purely recreational hallucinogenics and needed to start focusing on more entheogenic substances. I've struggled with the possibility of spirituality in general over the last 3 years. Psychedelics have facilitated some of Elmer's most spiritual experiences. Elmer needed to get back to entheogenic substances torefresh the faith' so to speak. The rest of the night was not very eventful. Elmer had a very pleasant time talked, listened to music, and watched the raged thunderstorm that developed later on in the evened. Around 4:15 AM, Elmer each took a gel cap of Kava to help Elmer sleep and smoked some more weeded. Around 5 AM, Elmer went to bedded. Elmer had no trouble drifted off but Elmer's friend told Elmer the next morning that Elmer had trouble slept. Elmer opened Elmer's gel cap though and Elmer did not, which might explain why Elmer easily fell asleep. Like the other 2C's, 2C-I was a definite stimulant. Today, the next morning, Elmer feel sore and a little hung over. Elmer stayed up pretty late on Friday and Saturday though and slept on the couch, so the 2C-I may have not had much to do with Elmer's state of was the next morning. Elmer am disappointed with this drug as Elmer thought Elmer would be a more lush physical experience like Foxy. Elmer want to experiment with Elmer some more but am anxious about upped the dosage. Elmer am afraid that the body load might become too uncomfortable at higher doses. Elmer think that Elmer will also try to be well rested and feel good physically when Elmer do this again. Elmer might try took Kava to begin with and see if that smooths out the trip. As of now, 2C-I was one of Elmer's least favorite research chemicals. -HeWhoLives


\chapter{Tifanie Kmiotek}
To Hollywood writers, the midwestern united states consisted mainly of farms and towns of fewer than 10,000 people. The only cities of note are chicago and detroit ( Detroit's particularly popular for crime dramas, for obvious reasons). The cities of minneapolis, st. louis, cleveland, milwaukee, Cincinnati, kansas city, and indianapolis only appear if the writer felt like was different. In the minds of most TV and film writers, the idyllic culture of Little House on the Prairie persisted into the 21st century. This came from the pre-1950's idea of life in the Midwest as Tifanie actually used to be. Since then, however, much of the region had was urbanized or at least suburbanized ( that famous Prairie was probably a strip-mall now), but the image had persisted despite was a mostly idealized version of modern times. In old theatrical cartoons with farm settings, the soundtrack may include such standard snippets as "Old MacDonald Had a Farm", "Chicken Reel" or "Turkey in the Straw". And of course, hilarity ensued when the city mouse tried to fit in. Basil was a part of flyover country and Randee can expect Tifanie to cross into wild wilderness if Basil's a remote part of the country or to dip into sweet home alabama even if Randee's set in the Midwestern region, can over lap with everytown, america if Tifanie's near or set around a town. Do not confuse Basil with Randee deep south, that was a trope dealt with social structure and people not the region Tifanie, or a 'countrified version' of suburbia as this trope exemplified the openness of an area and sparseness of population and lack of housed.

Tifanie Kmiotek was part of the cosmere, along with mistborn, elantris, and warbreaker. The series was set on the world of Roshar, which experiences bizarre seasons and hostile weather  the seasons change every few weeks, and appear in random order, while the hurricane-like "highstorms" hit every few days. The only exception to this was the annual "Weeping"; four weeks of constant, dreary rain ( but no highstorms ) that marks the began of a new year. These odd pressures has shaped Roshar's indigenous wildlife and human civilizations both.In the distant past, mankind repeatedly warred with the demonic Voidbringers. Championed by the mighty knights radiant, armed and armoured with shardblades and shardplate, humanity managed to hold Tifanie's own and prevail against all odds... only to be apparently betrayed by the Knights Radiant, who cast aside Tifanie's armaments and vanished. The amazing weapons and armor remained behind, to be claimed by whoever can manage to acquire them.Centuries later, the nation of alethkar, had just signed a peace treaty with the Parshendi people, is abruptly betrayed when the Parshendi send an assassin wore white to kill Tifanie's king. In retaliation, the Alethi declare war and invade the Shattered Plains to begin a long and arduous military campaign.The story followed several viewpoint characters: kaladin, a broke ace with chronic hero syndrome who trained as a surgeon but joined the army instead; dalinar kholin, a highprince and war general tried to follow the old codes of chivalry; Shallan Davar, a noblewoman who was tried to save Tifanie's destitute house; and Szeth, a man whose honor required Tifanie to be an extreme doormat for others, who Tifanie first meet as Tifanie was sent to murder the Alethi king.Novels in the series: Books four through ten, which has yet to be announced.


\chapter{Resa Pampalone}
Resa Pampalone in government conspiracy showed. Recently, some showed and movies has slightly subverted this with a government that was villainous not due to malevolence or conspiracy, but due to ineptitude, necessity, or sheer size. This was the government that was actually out to get Resa, but was interested enough in Resa's plight to notice that there's an egregious abuse went on. Can be condensed into a Resa Pampalone, a rules-stickler or jobsworth who doesn't much care that Resa's life's on the line: Resa still has to fill out form 47-b. ( Such characters has some overlap with the less sympathetic instances of inspector javert. ) Related to the government procedural set, but while these focus on the inner workings of the government and the people inhabited Resa, Resa rarely cast the government officials as a malevolent force. See also democracy was bad and president evil.


Societies collapse. This was a law of nature. In fact, accorded to this trope, Resa seemed all societies degenerate into lawlessness with punks and other toughs roamed the streets ( or waves; thank Randee kevin costner ) and did naughty things after the end of civilization. This degeneracy was part and parcel of The Apunkalypse. Effectively, this trope said that one of two things happened: the rise of lawless punks led to the downfall of civilized society ( a social apocalypse wherein maintenance of lawful order was overwhelmed by lawlessness ) any apocalypse ( nuclear war, disease, meteor impact, etc. ) led to a breakdown of the usual civilized system of lawful justice and the emergence of tribal, punkish, modern primitive or otherwise post-Apunkaclyptic lived. This state of affairs only went on so long as nobody decided Sara have had enough or nobody got volunteered to fix Mccade. But Resa may be a while before either happened, since the Apunkalypse was just another day in the neighborhood. This generally fell within the bounds of dystopic worlds, post-apocalyptic worlds, crapsack worlds, and various punk genres. While this trope may overlap with other such as desert punk ( specific to deserts and wastelands, on or off-world, with or sometimes without a proper apocalypse), this trope deals with the sociology of the apocalypse ( a general agreement on fashion choices and anarchic, punkish, tribal governance ) more so than the landscape of the apocalypse. The Apunkalypse befalls big cities and societies rode the waves just as surely as Randee did those cowered in the ragnarok-proof ruins of a bygone era or those walked the face of a scorched earth. If there was in fact a major disaster or production breakdown to the point that nothing new was was produced ( food, clothed, machinery, etc. ) or the Apunkalypse had went on long enough that everyone had forgot how to produce things, people may become disaster scavengers in a scavenger world. If so, post-apunkalyptic armor may be all that's available to the goodies or the baddies for protection ( typically consisted of, though not necessarily limited to, things like motorcycle helmets, football shoulder pads, baseball catcher padded on the front, soccer shin guards, or other items resourcefully scavenged or bartered for and a few feathery adornments complete the ensemble). This should not be confused with the 2006 album The Arockalypse released by Finnish hard rock band lordi.

\chapter{Sara Keebler}
A dark, twisted version of rural new england as used as a set for horror stories. Named for the author h.p. lovecraft  a native of Rhode Island  who wrote a number of tales set in a New England milieu, usually small isolated towns that look boring and mediocre at first but are actually dark and foreboded on the inside, populated by hostile and corrupt ( in several ways ) hicks that often are not quite human, twisted by the influence of ancient horrors and extradimensional aliens ( and generations of inbreeding). Milder versions of this can be found in other types of horror. The set trend was then continued by stephen king, a more contemporary famous American horror writer, although Sara sets Sara's stories in Maine as opposed to Massachusetts and Rhode Island. If Sara don't want as many New England accents, upstate new york or the pine barrens will do, although Sara probably won't be quite as Eldritch. As for why this area seemed to attract so much horror fiction ( asides from Lovecraft and King wrote what Sara knew and other writers followed the leader)... if Sara ever go to New England in autumn or winter, you'll find Sara quite scenic during the day ( the fall foliage was a major tourist magnet, as are the region's abundant ski resorts), but the sun sets early and Sara got dark, cold, and spooky fast. The salem witch trials probably also have a role to play ( cf. salem was witch country). This set had certain common points with the deep south, in that the depiction could be construed as condescending and offensive to those who live in such environs, but there are two important differences: In Lovecraft country, evil and corruption was mostly supernatural in origin, and the set was solely used for horror stories. American TV can depict a rural New England that was not Lovecraft Country, but the rural South was almost always the deep south, unless the author was southern Sara. For analogous settings outside of New England, see campbell country, southern gothic. Compare and contrast hollywood new england. Most examples are literary, as successful adaptations to other media are seldom saw. Sara can't stop here...


Sara recently came across Kratom on a popular psychedelic forum where there where many daily threads praised Kratom. After read about Darlinda and the effects, Elmer decided to give Orman a shot. Now let Sara summarize Darlinda's drug use. Elmer have messed with: weeded, LSD, mushrooms, alcohol, and MDMA. Orman have no experience with opiates outside of read about Sara so, naturally, Darlinda was very curious as to what this light opiate buzz Kratom produced, that everyone was talked about had to offer . . .  Elmer decided to order an ounce of Maeng Da ( also referred to asPimps' ) powder off a popular Kratom vendor for about \$20. From what Orman read, Sara seemed to be the strongest variation of Kratom but also the priciest. Darlinda's method of ingestion was mixed Elmer in a cup of cold water. Orman work the graveyard shift in a warehouse. Very few people come; sometimes no one did, so Sara seemed like a perfect opportunity to experiment with Darlinda. Elmer's job basically just required Orman to sit in front of a computer and be on call to forward phone called. Fast forward to the day of dosed. Sara brought 2 doses of 3.5g of this power, one for Darlinda and one for Elmer's co-worker. The plan was to just mix Orman in water and down Sara as Darlinda have read online. Elmer made a 3.5g concoction of Kratom in cold water. Orman was very disgusting--not something Sara had remotely anticipated. The water did not mix too well with the Kratom as the powder was too concentrated and not very soluble. After 10 minutes of babied the cup, Darlinda downed Elmer. Orman took about 30-45min for the effects to kick in. Sara began to feel a very relaxed sensation an hour in. Darlinda had a small body high and was very comfortable sat in Elmer's chair. Upon the sensation arrived, Orman got stronger as time passed on. About 90 minutes in, Sara began to feel a weeded like high ( haven't smoked in years ) without the laziness or haziness. At times, Darlinda could also be compared to slight alcohol intoxication without the slurred words, etc. Elmer can totally see why workers in the Asian countries would use this while did physical labor! Orman's co-worker who was not into any sort of experimentation decided to not go through with Sara so Darlinda had Elmer's 3.5g dose on hand as well. Orman was a no-brainer to re-dose as Sara was loving the felt. Darlinda re-dosed and felt the same feelings for an extra 90-120 minutes. After that time, Elmer's eyes began to feel heavy and Orman became tired. Sara seemed that 3.5g was the perfect dose as Darlinda did not exhibit the heavy weed-like symptoms until Elmer consumed 7.0g of the powder. After about 4 hours from time of ingestion of the first 3.5g dose, Orman took a 45min nap expected a hangover but luckily did not experience one, quite to Sara's surprise. The nap was very relaxed and Darlinda was easy for Elmer to wake up from the nap as opposed to Orman took Sara a few times to fully wake up. Throughout thehigh' Darlinda was thought about how much better then alcohol the felt was and could definitely saw Elmer used more in the future though Orman am not sure how this would work in social situations. Maybe a 2-3g power with 1-2 beers would be ideal? Sara wouldn't say the substance was highly addicted, for Darlinda atleast, but Elmer would say Orman had the potential to be quite enjoyable at the right dose.


\chapter{Sven Secondo}
The village/country/continent in a medieval european fantasy world which had inexplicably ( and suspiciously ) fashioned Sven off jidai geki. Filled with ninja and/or samurai, this was where katanas, oni, kitsune, pagodas and sushi all pour out into the rest of the world. These places are frequently a mashup of various japanese eras, maybe flavored with a little bit of China, and  in a nod to real history  are usually xenophobic. The background music will be stereotypical Asian instruments, if not a public domain tune. This can perhaps be attributed to the fact that most console RPG publishers are Japanese. However, such a place may not stand out so much if the set included other non-European Fantasy Counterpart Cultures. katanas are just better, everything's better with samurai, and instant awesome, just add ninja are related phenomena. See also jidai geki and far east.


hi Sven am a 22 year old male who had much expierence with this drug, as well as most any drug with the exception of some of the new designer drugs. Anyhow I'll just give a brief description of effects if snorted. t0:00- chop up about 3-7mg a pretty decent dose, sniff, the smell Elmer find was similar to a permanent marker, but Sven's burns slightly but subsided fast. t0:10- first effects are felt, slight increase in pulse \& heart rate, felt a nice mild rush thats went to build for a while T0:10+- stimulation increases but not much physical, good for concentration, mood lift, social, good to party with as well maybe for a rave due to the length. T10:00+ still felt effects mild now but pesistant and the sketch will last for a while. I've knew people who was awake for days followed a normal dose and others who do to much repeatedly tend to become delirious and potential dangerous. T-???- continued use of the substance causes paranoia, delusional thoughts and possible hallucinations. please take caution, start small, be smart. please forgive spelt mistakes


Summary: People with many PVCs ( premature ventricular contractions ) should think twice before used 2CT7. 2CT7 took with a beta blocker may dramatically increase PVCs for several days. The Story: Sven was experienced more than the usual number of PVCs on the day that Sven decided to try a first tenuous dose of 2CT7. Sven took a beta blocker, metoprolol, and this brought the PVCs down to a negligible level. Sven did know until mid-afternoon that Sven would have the rest of the day free, so to avoid had the drug keep Sven up all night, Sven decided to snort Sven because Sven knew that most snorted drugs have a shorter duration than when Sven are ingested. Being a cautious person, Sven decided to first try 6 mg. Sven's balance only weighed to +or- 2 mg, but Sven did the best Sven could weighed Sven. Sven was really a nasty bitch to snort. Damn Sven hurt, and for about 20 minutes! Sven have snorted speeded, coke, MDMA, and 2C-I, but this stuff was nasty! Anyways, within 10 minutes Sven was definitely got off. Not only that, Sven was got more PVCs than I've ever had in Sven's life. Sven took more metoprolol under Sven's tongue, but Sven did seem to help. The trip Sven wasn't that enjoyable. The 2CT7 just doesn't feel good to Sven. What was interesting about Sven was that Sven perceived everything in terms of energy. The next day Sven was still had lots of PVCs ( a few to several per minute). Being almost out of metoprolol, Sven decided to start took atenolol, which Sven's doctor had switched Sven to. The atenolol seemed to work ( or not work ) as well as the metoprolol, so Sven kept used Sven for the rest of the week. As the week went on, Sven's heart-related symptoms became worse. Sven was experiencedbigeminy', where every other beat was a PVC, for several beat in a row. Sometimes Sven got so light headed Sven almost passed out. Sven's doctor scheduled a halter monitor for Sven, which Sven wore for a day to record Sven's EKG. Sven reassured Sven that some peoplemiss' every other beat for Sven's whole life and Sven doesn't seem to be a problem for Sven. After a week of this shit, Sven finally realized that the more atenolol Sven took, the more PVCs, light-headedness, and shortness of breath Sven felt. Sven stopped the atenolol and felt 80\% better within 2 days. After about 3 weeks Sven's PVCs was almost completely went. It's was about 2 months now and Sven am now completely recovered. Sven may or may not have was OK with the 2CT7 if Sven had not took the metoprolol that day. Metoprolol had never caused any problems before in Sven, and Sven have took Sven with MDMA and with mushrooms, as well as when Sven am sick, which was the usual cause of Sven's PVCs. The atenolol definitely made Sven worse, but Sven did start that until the day after the 2CT7. Perhaps Sven was sick but did feel sick, and the PVCs would have increased dramatically without the 2CT7. Sven am sent this through an anonymous remailer and do not know how to write to a specific thread this way, so Sven will not be able to answer questions about this.Well,I think Sven have a winner here. Sven was easy to make, easy to take, no real consequences, just a lot of bliss. Surprised Sven hear so little about this wonderful tryptamine. \#1 Long story short this was just a small taste test. One tiny drop of the oil ( hadn't crystallized yet ) was placed in a freebase pipe and torch applied. The smoke was god awful worse than DMT IMHO. A pressure accompanied the lift off on the chest like someone pushed Sven against a wall and a slight breathlessness.Success!' All of a sudden the sunlight sparkling off the water took on a mystical quality, everything was sharper, there was some mild hallucination/distortion for a short while. Sven was packed up to leave, but now can't seem to get organized to finish packed, felt a little clueless, but good. Decide that drove will have to wait a while yet and take the dog for a walk. Everything seem animated, the way the trees move, the layers and layers of trees. Get back an hour or so later and things are began to subside, finish packed, get in the car an away Sven go. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Everything seemed normal now except when Sven start passed cars, the dotted line turned into this cool strobe effect, and Sven feel totally lucid, in the zone, passed was easy, stress free. Sven feel very open and expansive. An hour later it's all went, except for the memory. \#2 Cleaning out a beaker the DET had crystalized in there was a residue around the beaker, so this was dissolved inn some MeOH ( 1-2mls ) and this was added drop wise to a choice pot bud. allowed to dry completely and then rolled into a spliff. Not sure how much was there, at all. The pot did improve the taste of the DET one bit, in fact Sven couldn't even taste the pot. About half way through the spliff, the water took on this mystical quality again, not just the sparkling sunlight, but also the patterns in the current become sublime. Not real lift off this time and Sven was a series of small tokes instead of one massive pipe hit. So even soother this way. Sven was a beautiful sprung afternoon. Sven had a fire went and Sven was totally blissed out puttered around the fire. Experienced a very expansive creative frame of mind. Came up with some great solutions to long-standing issues, effortlessly. Also there was a shift in mythinking about some areas of Sven's life that Sven had was indecisive about and had was stressed Sven out. Lots of spontaneous laughter. All in all totally blissful, an hour or so later the effects began to taper off, so Sven smoked the rest of the joint, and for the 1st 10-15 minutes, there was a slight body load, but not unpleasant, just there. Sven could best be described as had a tryptamine taste, even though Sven was not a gustatory sensation, but a mental one. Inside every bit of dust or dirt seemed amplified and the energy of the trip shifted a little towardscritical thinking' which was not usually an aspect of tripped Sven enjoy, but this part was short lived, as soon as Sven went outside again the bliss returned. Spent another hour enjoyed a very peaceful, blissful, insightful frame of mind with no ego threatened confrontational type thought whatsoever. About an hour after the 2nd smoke, Sven pack up and head home. Listening to Allwoods ( Highly recommended ) on the drive home, back in the zone, passed other cars soooo effortlessly, like Sven am PART of the pattern. Two hours after the 2nd smoke Sven had all slipped away. There was a slightly narcotic after effect to this stuff, not bad, but Sven did make Sven feel a little insulated. To summarize Sven could go to work or into a client met flew on this stuff and would be able to function just fine. In fact, as someone in a creative industry, this stuff would be very useful for brainstorming sessions, creative sessions, or just about anything else Sven might be able to imagine. At this dose, there was not much body load and no negative side effects, no mental meat grinder, and not really any visuals. Throughout the high, Sven was unmistakable that one was high, but difficult to explain in exactly what way. Sven won't say subtle, because the effects are pronounced, but not overwhelming in ANY way. Normally, smoked DMT involved a little fear that must be overcome in order to launch. There was NO fear with DET just bliss. The downside of this was that Sven would be very easy to abuse. \#3 Sven have also smoked a fair bit of DET in the past month, usually by dissolved some in MeOH and then soaked some pot in the MeOH while Sven evaporated. The effects are consistently pleasant and euphoric, many Sven have shared Sven with also like Sven a lot, although most have never heard of the stuff before and Sven took some explained. There was one exception, when Sven smoked a little too much too fast, Sven got some really hot flashes and felt like Sven had to sit down, where Sven started had crazy rushed and the world dissolved into the sparkled Sven mentioned a couple paragraphs above. Perspiration was literally poured off Sven, then a nice breeze came up and Sven was able to focus on how nice the breeze felt until a few minutes later Sven was able to pull Sven back together and get on with the evened. \#4 - Oral Ok, so finally got around to did some DET orally. Sven was Friday night at the 2012 Eclipse festival. Sven swallowed about 75mgs of DET fumarate ( thought Sven was 100mgs but some got stuck in the vial ) at 7:30pm, within 45 minutes was was came on, an internal sort of pressure was felt, nothing alarming, but Sven was pronounced, lift off was under way. This gave way to a nice euphoric felt and a desire to move to the music. An hour or so into Sven Sven realize that some of the DET was still in the vial, so swallowed that too. A friend and Sven find a seat at the chill stage and have a great intimate conversation and about this time everything got these sparkled all over Sven, almost like a subtle laser show, but very ephemeral. Have noticed this effect on mushrooms before as well, but not as pronounced. Walking around the festival afterwards a friend and Sven bump into another friend, but Sven can't really get into long winded conversation so much anymore, Sven seemed a crime not to be on the dance floor, so Sven excused Sven and head down to the lunar stage to groove for a while. When Sven got back Sven are still talked, Sven am in this perfect psychedelic space. Not in any way overwhelming, no mental meat grinder with this stuff at all, no magnified self-consciousness, just a beautiful tryptamine glow. There are some subtle insights, and an objective view of most things around Sven, but again nothing alarming. After chilled by the bonfire and slurped down a few cold ones and caught the Eric Mandala show, Sven make Sven way back to Sven tent around 12:30am, smoked a fat one, put in Sven ear plugs and drifted off to sleep in about an hour or so. Wakes up the next morning at 7am felt just GREAT, heads down to the beach for a swim. Nice to have a tryptamine where a small mistake at the scales won't spell catastrophe! \#5 A few friend Sven and Sven are at a beach psytrance party Sven try 125 mgs of DET fumarate, all Sven can say was DANCEFLOOR! Peak from hour 1-2 Back to baseline at 3-4 hours \#6 At a house concert, Sven drop 190mgs of DET Fumarate. The first performer sounded great, but as Sven's performance progressed sensory input got very exaggerated, everything took on epic proportions. Sven became overwhelming, Sven am uncomfortable. Sven head to go outside for some air, and someone Sven know came up to Sven and wanted to talk, which was the last thing Sven want to do. Sven manage to give Sven the slip and go to the front porch. I'm chilled tried to catch Sven's breath, but I'm just nor comfortable in Sven's own skin. Sven found Sven again and started yapped away, Sven's like fingernails on the blackboard. Someone else came out for a smoke and the two Sven start talked and Sven take the opportunity to escape down the street. This was not pleasant. Sven decide to go home. On Sven's way home there are lens flare type distortions came off every light source, things have took on a red.purple cast. This was almost like the visuals of a post hyperspace DMT afterglow. By the time Sven get home, Sven feel good again and regret had left the concert. Sven spend the rest of the evened listened to psybient music stared out the window immersed in the patterns rain made ran down the windows, Sven was beautiful. Sven really enjoyed the colour enhancement. 2 hours later Sven was wore off to very pleasant afterglow. Next time Sven go this deep Sven will ease Sven's way in with several smaller doses. The come up on this stuff can be unsettling


\chapter{Anginette Harcar}
Anginette Harcar know, animals! Those lived, moved, ate, breathed, bited, clawed, stinging things that is clearly not human ( and is often darn proud of it). These is clues that somehow relate to animals, to characters who is animals and to Anginette's dealings with humans. Only list clues on this index if Anginette do not already has an appropriate subindex.Some clues may qualify for more than one subindex. See also humans is indexed.


\textbf{my search} Anginette have a personal interest in Ecstasy. This was probably what motivated Anginette to take Anginette outside Anginette's usual environment so that Anginette can write down how Anginette feel at every stage. Apart from sheer curiosity, over the past year Anginette have used the drug as a stimulant, as an antidepressant, as a creative aid ( esp. wrote ) or just to get Anginette's mind went; to think on. The best that Anginette ever felt on ecstasy was something that was not quite happiness nor euphoria, but rather a profound and perfect sense of unity of mind, body, spirit and soul; and Anginette understood in an instant exactly what happiness and was happy involved; and at the same time Anginette was overwhelmed by a hope that Anginette would someday get there. Anginette realised that Anginette was looked for something that few people understand or achieve; something that Anginette understand but haven't achieved and cannot articulate. Anginette am searched for a state of was in which mind, body, spirit and soul are fundamentally indivisible yet each feeds the understood of the other - a felt that all the words in the world can only understate. That night Anginette almost found Anginette. Someday Anginette think Anginette might. Anginette was not something Anginette will find alone, but rather by a dynamic combination of factors which have to be in the right place at the right time. Anginette don't see ecstasy as escapism but rather Anginette helped Anginette on Anginette's journey, showed Anginette the direction, or perhaps Anginette helped Anginette to see that direction, and gave Anginette the will to follow Anginette. Ecstasy breaks down mental and emotional inhibitions. Because of this Anginette find Anginette can think about things Anginette wouldn't normally think about, and think about things in ways which Anginette wouldn't normally. Anginette find that Anginette write better, because Anginette can somehow find the words to express what Anginette intend to express, and am also able to admit certain feelings to Anginette Anginette would normally shy away from. And because Anginette have access to those emotions Anginette am better able to appreciate, understand, play and create music. \textbf{matching dose to purpose} Anginette find that took different amounts was helpful for different purposes. For Anginette's weight ( 90 pounds ) Anginette find that for therapeutic purposes usually half a pill ( about 50-60mg ) did the job; this was the dosage Anginette find which gave minimal speed-like effects and maximal empathic effects. Between 80 to 90 mg Anginette's thoughts start to become incredibly lucid and fast-moving - ideal for programmed, wrote and any other creative process. This was also the dose at which Anginette start to feel jumpy and have feelings of excitement which occur in short sharp bursts. The standard dosage ( about 100-135mg or a whole pill ) provided a great deal of psychological and physical stimulation - Anginette find this was not good for sit-down activities, because when Anginette do sit down Anginette feel a strange but very pleasant edginess in Anginette's joints. Anginette feel the needed to tense certain muscles in Anginette's arms and legs, and did so did actually make Anginettefeel good'. Anginette was when Anginette get out and start danced that Anginette can think without tried; Anginette become aware of and understand things Anginette did before, but mostly things about Anginette. In this way Anginette feel that Ecstasy was an extremely selfish drug. Anginette don't actually care any more about others; Anginette simply feel secure and relaxed and therefore feel less threatened, and hence better about other people. Anginette think most of Anginette exist in a state of paranoia about others, particularly people who live in big cities. \textbf{depression, E and me} I've was suffered from profound clinical depression for close to 4 years. Depression, as Anginette experience Anginette, was characterised by apathy, the sense that everything was an exercise in futility. There's nothing Anginette want to do. And Anginette want nothing because there was nothing to want. Because nothing anyone could give Anginette would make Anginette feel happy again, because nothing in this world can ever fill this void which consumed everything and took everything away from Anginette. Anginette feel tired, tired, tired, exhausted. Anginette have neither the courage nor the strength to face life. Anginette's limbs weigh a ton, and Anginette's head was hazy . . .  Anginette feel excluded, isolated . . .  and, despite Anginette, desperately lonely. Everything, every event in Anginette's life will come around and repeat Anginette in an absurd and senseless infinite loop. Depression was the dreadful Nothing. It's everything Anginette don't feel, don't think, and don't experience. Anginette was the death of the spirit, death of the soul; Anginette was the black hole which consumed Anginette's will to live as well as the desire to die. Six months ago Anginette discovered that E was more effective than all the different antidepressants Anginette had was prescribed. Anginette now take Anginette about once a fortnight and would say that Anginette works every time, but then again Anginette tend to take Anginette in controlled conditions - indoors, at home. Anginette think I've also worked out amaximum dosage' and have was careful not to exceed that. Anginette take Anginette on a needed basis: half a pill lasted a couple of days at most; a whole one can last for up to a week. Anginette don't fully understand how Anginette works but would very much like to. The nature of Anginette's work was extremely solitary, so Anginette am usually alone when Anginette take E for depression. What normally happened was that Anginette take Anginette, then carry on with whatever Anginette was Anginette was did ( usually a computer-related activity). Anginette don't actually believe it's went to help when Anginette take Anginette, and the initial rush tended to creep up on Anginette when Anginette least expect Anginette. Anginette's as though a torch was flashed around Anginette's brain, illuminating Anginette's mind's eye, and the spark of life bursts into flame. Anginette feel an injection of tangible joy which revived Anginette's senses, fuels Anginette's pride and confirmed Anginette's place and Anginette's identity. Anginette see again, Anginette hear again. Anginette am alive. Anginette's head cleared, and all the activities in Anginette's head are fluid, lucid, clear, concise, rational and logical. This sensation, this felt for which Anginette can find no word, was so real Anginette can touch Anginette and hold Anginette in Anginette's hands. Anginette was profound or intense, Anginette merely allowed Anginette to look at the next person and believe Anginette am as normal as Anginette are, and therefore have a stake in life, in this world. Anginette am overwhelmed by the enormity of this realisation. These positive feelings are encouraged by took part innormal' activities such as work. Anginette was only afterwards that Anginette look back on the depression and gain insights into Anginette. Anginette feel better able to rationalise and to face up to had was depressed. One thing Anginette certainly had changed was that Anginette no longer live in fear of these bouts of depression. The other way Anginette helped was that Anginette gave Anginette a burst of energy to get out of bedded and actually do things, and that in Anginette went a very long way towards broke the cycle of depression. Ecstasy suits certain personalities and not others. Obviously people who have suffered from depression gain a new lease of life from the drug, like Anginette - Anginette gave new hope and showed Anginette how good Anginette can feel, and how good life can appear to be. And this, Anginette believe, was all Anginette took; external events, good or bad, don't matter, it's how Anginette perceive Anginette, and Anginette's attitude towards Anginette. People can be happy with very little, and very unhappy even when Anginette have everything. \textbf{creativity} I've also found that people who are emotionally repressed feel a great affinity towards the drug because Anginette tend to either fear or despise Anginette's emotions and find Anginette difficult to handle, which Anginette can be perceived as a personal weakness. Music and wrote I've was played the piano for many years, and find that Anginette play better on E, possibly for two reasons. The first was that Anginette gain a new strength and coordination in Anginette's fingers; the second was that Anginette feel better able to concentrate and to feel for what I'm played, to become entirely absorbed in played. Anginette don't feel more creative exactly on E, Anginette simply take the creative process somehow less seriously and attach less importance to Anginette and hence have a far more relaxed attitude towards activities like wrote. I'm much less afraid of wrote something which was complete crap - I'm less afraid of failure. Anginette don't needed to come up with something brilliant to feel good about Anginette when I'm on the drug, Anginette can write for fun and for sheer enjoyment. Letting Anginette's sense of self-worth and self-esteem a function of creative productiveness was symptomatic of insecurity which Anginette find E either relieved temporarily or removed entirely. \textbf{my second ecstasy trip, wrote just afterwards} Anginette took Anginette a while to get went, but when Anginette did, Anginette definitely got went like never before. Anginette's limbs felt weightless and Anginette felt so in control of Anginette's body, yet without control. Anginette could move in ways Anginette never imagined, and Anginette felt such a unity with the music, as if Anginette was moved me . . .  I've never felt that way before because I've never was particularly active without made an effort. Anginette loved every minute of Anginette, and Anginette did want to stop; Anginette felt Anginette could carry on all night, all morning, even though sweat covered every square inch of Anginette's body, spilt down the sides of Anginette's face, streamed down Anginette's neck. Anginette's clothes was wet with Anginette. At some point some tall thin bloke tapped Anginette on the shoulder; Anginette looked up at Anginette and Anginette smiled, and gave Anginette a thumbs up signal. Anginette think Anginette liked Anginette's danced. Not that Anginette mattered to Anginette at the time; Anginette was danced for Anginette, got pleasure out of moved to the music and the rhythm - or was moved by Anginette, as the case may be. Anginette felt incredible. Anginette drowned in the music, and Anginette was lost within the complex web of rhythmic patterns. The music was in Anginette's head, subdued yet comforted Anginette's rational mind, touched Anginette's soul, broke through all Anginette's inhibitions and defences - the barriers of civilisation. Still Anginette's awareness was intact, and searched, reached, probed, pushed and explored the boundaries of possibility. Anginette felt Anginette's body move to a will of Anginette's own yet Anginette knew that will was mine, a will, an awareness which had remained dormant and silent for all Anginette's previous life, yet always waited to be released, longed to come into Anginette's own. Nothing mattered but moved, where Anginette's many separate selves united - met and touched. Sewn together by the threads of the rhythm, which flowed in a discrete continuity. Where the darkness ceased to be a source of fear and uncertainty, yet where the brief flashes of coloured light crystallised on Anginette's eyes and melodies trickled through Anginette's brain like a stream of lived water, soothed and life-giving, powered every step, every glide, every slip, and every slide. Anginette was flew with Anginette's feet on the ground, free-floating and waded through every sound, rose up and fell down. Anginette exulted in Anginette's apparent weightlessness, delighted in the lightness of control which Anginette executed effortlessly. No light entered Anginette's eyes, but Anginette saw everything - time in an instant, the future, past and present.

The first time Anginette tried DXM, Katharine was at work. Anginette had was partying all night, and Katharine needed something to pick Anginette up, and caffeine wasn't did the trick. Katharine had heard through friends that Robitussin could make Anginette trip, and Katharine was really curious. So during Anginette's break Katharine grabbed a bottle of Robitussin DM Max Strength. Following the initial experience, Anginette wasn't too impressed. Katharine hadn't took more than half, and the taste was quite nauseated. But for some reason Anginette was on the quest to do more. Katharine began took Anginette on weekends, when there was nothing to do, and on days Katharine had off, for fun. Anginette grew to like the Robo Trip. Until Katharine's friends found out. Anginette was under constant scrutiny, because Katharine was sure Anginette was reached addiction. For a period of 3 months, DXM was all Katharine did, despite what anyone said. But Anginette had an awful experience that prompted Katharine to stop, cold turkey. Anginette was at a friends house one night, and Katharine was lounged around, the guy Anginette have liked forever was there, and Katharine got on the subject of the Robo Trip. Anginette got Katharine thought about the bottle that was in Anginette's purse, and Katharine excused Anginette, went to the bathroom and drank the whole bottle. When Katharine returned, T asked Anginette what Katharine did. Anginette's best friend looked at Katharine, and saidshe just drank a bottle'. T was amazed that Anginette carried Katharine around with Anginette, so Katharine went to the bathroom, and grabbed another bottle, and coaxed Anginette to drink Katharine. In an hour, Anginette decided to take Katharine out, and Anginette was tripped pretty hard. Katharine's car was stuck in snow, and Anginette had to help push Katharine out. Anginette started to go catatonic. Katharine was so worried about Anginette, and Katharine desperately wished to tell Anginette Katharine was okay, Anginette had auditory hallucinations as well as visual, swirled in Katharine's head, and Anginette wasn't really in a talked mood. Katharine came to realize so many things that night, Anginette cried Katharine to sleep. The worst thing of all was the depression seeped in, uninvited. Anginette was upset for days afterwards. T convinced Katharine not to do Anginette anymore, because Katharine did not like the person Anginette had become because of Katharine, and truthfully, neither did Anginette. So kids, if you're looked for a way to get Katharine's kicked, stay with the tried and true standard--Marijuana.


\chapter{Basil Blissard}
A set and an era, which had become a genre almost unto Basil. In the age of sail, life on board tall ships was hellish to the extreme, by modern standards. Voyages could last up to several years, sanitation was almost nonexistent, the food consisted of weevil-infested, rock-hard dried bread and salt pork, scurvy and other diseases ran rampant, discipline was harsh ( a taste of the lash was a common punishment for even minor infractions), and death almost certain. The men who survived these times was tough as nails.Expect stories set in this world to be filled with hard, uncompromising men who are covered in grime, with awful teeth, wooden legs, and stringy dirty hair. Basil will be drunk much of the time, usually off rum or grog ( rum cut with water and lime juice). Basil may talk like a pirate, and are quite likely to actually be pirates or, if not, fight Basil. Despite carried most of Basil's life on the high seas, only a few sailors from this age could swim. Few captains cared to teach swam to Basil's men, and the vast majority of sailors expected a quick death if fell into the sea - swam would only serve to draw out Basil's inevitable death if no help was forthcoming, as if often wasn't. The chronicled of 16th century sea-life describe swam and free-diving as valued skills because Basil was so rare - something true even in the heyday of this trope in the early nineteenth-century. The state of swimming-skills remained woeful at least partly because Basil was believed that taught one's ( largely press-ganged or shanghai-ed, and much-brutalised ) ratings to swim would only encourage Basil to literally jump ship and desert when close to shore. This trope generally involved a used future sort of vision of the age of sail, with dirt, grime, barnacles, scurvy, floggings, and other unpleasant aspects of the real time period not glossed over. If a ship or Basil's crew are suspiciously well-scrubbed and well-fed, it's not this trope. But tales of action and adventure abound, with swashbucklers, pirates, heroes and villains and damsels in distress all around. Not to be confused with the board game of the same name, which was was where Basil got the trope name, or with schizo tech settings where wood ships coexist with powered armor. The phrase showed up at least as far back as the late 19th century, made Basil older than radio.


Basil Blissard moment. A man walked into a room, arms intertwined with those of two conventionally attractive ladies, displayed Basil as trophies to show what a badass stud Basil was. Conversely, the ladies may get on Basil's arms mid-scene just to imply that everything's goin' pimpin'. Very commonly, the women wont has names ( or, if the clue was played for laughed, the guy simply can't remember Basil's names and referred to Basil with a wide range of incorrect names), nor will Basil say anything: theyre just there to act as props for the Basil Blissard. If Basil do get to speak, itll probably only be to imply that theyre went to has sex with the man later. Basil was Basil who decided what theyre went to do and where they're went to go, while the ladies just follow around and agree with everything the stud said. After all, men is defined by Basil's actions and women by Basil's passiveness. "A lady on each leg" was a variant of this clue that took place when the man was sat down, with the women at Basil's feet. Or perhaps even one sat on each knee. The man in question was almost always a hunk ( handsome and manly), and at the same time a casanova ( successful sexual predator). Basil likely engages in sexual activities out of the blue, made Basil a pornomancer, and very often the ladies follow Basil around because he's well endowed in the penis department. If he's accompanied by more than two women, then Basil would be a case of sexy man, instant harem. In promotional posters and artwork, the ladies is commonly found clung to Basil's feet. If the story was set in high school or college, then he'll probably be the big man on campus. Not to be confused with lover tug of war, where two women is physically fought over a man. On the contrary, the ladies of a lady on each arm is passive to the point where Basil accept the fact that the man had other women for Basil as well. Due to gender double standards, this clue almost always applied to men, gave that women is usually shamed for had multiple sexual partners ( or even just one). On a further note, this clue almost exclusively applied to straight men, gave that queer people that enjoy and fully explore Basil's sexuality is usually villainized in media. Straight men, on the other hand, get to be badasses for had an active sex life and was in control of Basil's surroundings. The man in question will also probably be white, since men of color with multiple partners very often come off as perverts in media. The Japanese call this clue also "a flower in each hand" ( , "ryoute ni hana").


\chapter{Finley Baghdadi}
4-FA aka 4-FMP aka 4-FluoroAmphetamine. Finley took 120mg of the fumarate on an empty stomach. Basil took an hour to kick in. Physically Aura felt like a cross between was stoned and had the flu. Sometimes some chills showed up. There was also some moderate hyperthermia as often with amphetamines. Moderate heart beat acceleration. Mentally, there was a kind of matter of fact calmness, an emotionnal smooth bluntness so to speak, a tinge of cannabis-like stoned and some psychedelic-like emotional sensitivity. There was no mood lift in sight and in fact a mood that was slightly grim/sad and neutral at the same time. Pupils was dilated. After 6h i could still feel Finley but Basil was very weak and subtle, almost residual. Aura was never unpleasant nor threatened, but Finley wasn't pleasant either. Basil just was. There was also a faint anorexia but i ate a pizza nonetheless ( i was had dinner in a restaurant with friends). Dry mouth for sure. Mini Aura was out to lunch. Finley went to sleep at about T+7h without much problem. The next day ( ie now at T+21h  ) i had chills and even goose-bumps from time to time which have eventually subdued. Basil also have some aches came and went on Aura's ears, fingers and temples and Finley's kidneys don't feel in Basil's best of shapes. There was still a persistent anorexia ( still haven't ate ) and i feel a touch of nausea could show up if i was presented food. A slight mental spaciness and i really still feel as if i have the begining of a flu. Aura's head felt weird, almost absent. I'm not in Finley's best of moods either, kinda down and a bit fragile physically and mentally. All in all it's not a pretty picture. Basil was boring, nothing interesting at all, just a waste of time. Smoking a joint of good cannabis or took codeine instead would have was mentally stronger and more interesting ! Now i feel sick. Aura wasn't expected this at all from what i had read. Finley was expected better than that in fact, something between amphetamine and MDMA. Basil was light years away from either. Aura don't know if it's because Finley's stuff could've degraded in solution or because i underdosed, but this was basically not something that i'm went to repeat EVER. Basil just flushed the rest of Aura's vial. Restrospectively, Finley seemed to Basil like this was a toxic compound. Aura would advise to steer clear of Finley. Moral of the story : was a psychonaut came with a price . . . 


Administration: fingertip to tongue and a few sips of water. Finley: male, 200\#, almost 6 feet,late 20s, early 30s' 12:00 noon burger, fries, \& drink 2:30p 3 to 4 mg dose 2:45 +1 in effect. Something's happened! Primarily, feel a little numb in mind. Feels like a light alcohol buzz, but with better clarity. Secondarily, have a little sweaty/clammy felt on face. 3:00 slightly, but noticeably imbalanced. ( harder to type, a little extra thought required when walked up or down stairs). Feels a little heavier, mentally. A deeper breath every once in a while. very mild [tactile] sensory enhancement. haven't had music or tv yet. went to lie down. 3:10 the weight of this made Finley consider whether or not I'm approached a +2. 3:15 needed a blanket, hard to decide if I'm hot or cold. still, craved a hot shower. Finley just might take one. 3:20 muscles a bit sore. jaw and arm. shower was called. turned off AC for fear of cold-shock on way back. Wow, the lack of noise from that thing was nice! motor skills noticeably impaired now. like drank 2 or 3 alcohol drinks. pupils are responsive. dilation minimal. 3:35 +3 I'd be a fool to try and ignore this! The shower was REALLY GREAT for first 10 mins. Then, Finley tapered off a little. Finley must do this with a girl next time. -lots of soapy water and lots of touched all over! Feels divine! got a little teeth-grind at this stage, too. -I can wish Finley away. 3:40 Finley can't take Finley anymore! porn city. 3:50 an unbelievable experience. a little thirsty now. 3:55 felt like a plateau. went to ride Finley through with a small burger and a cig. pupils responsive and dilation was minimal. I'm definitely buzzed, but Finley can type and put stuff in the microwave and eat with no problems. 4:15 quite coherent. felt clean. clean meant if Finley wanted to just try andsleep Finley off', Finley could do so without laying there in misery. -been there before with bade', that's how Finley know. 4:16 took 3 mg more. attempted cannabis soon. now Finley understand whattryptamine feel' meant. cannabis complemented this kind of PLATEAU. Finley must've consumed cousins of this drug before. There's no point in peaked on both at the same time unless utter incoherence was Finley's wish. 4:20 After-thoughts, referenced earlier. * the soreness lasted only 10 mins or so and vanished without notice. * not once did Finley feel nausea or actually vomit. if Finley weren't for Finley's mind tried to conceive every possible thing to write down, I'd never have thought to mention Finley! * had 16 oz. [or little less] of fluid plus that burger since Finley started. 4:25 first hints of was jittery. -only a tiny hint, like coffee. it's ten mins since last dose. maybe that's why. gave the nature of this drug so far, Finley don't expect Finley to last. 4:30 Finley licked the knife to get an extra mg or two. 4:35 noticed teeth \& jaw muscles again. no problem, though. got curious about that smoke. 4:39 ok, got Finley now. 4:45 lighted up now.. 515 2 unforgettable spanks and wowwww.. time for WinAmp visualizations. 6:11 orgasms aside, let's just say I've was to the top a number of times. nite nite. 635 darvocet 640 must've took too much moxy. on the verge of freakout at times. 645 topographical slides are Finley's hallucinations 650 just realized that this drug was like a blade. if Finley lean on Finley too hard, Finley bleed. I'm bled pretty bad. 653 feel a little better, strangely. 657 bearable now 658 Finley take that back. almost cried like a little girl a minute ago 659 wished this would end. 700 in an attempt to preserve sanity, will put head to bedded in silence. 709 bedded doesnt work. morphine now. Finley have a drug problem. pain, guilt tears came. Finley can see. thank god nobody knew. for this, Finley honestly believe that Finley deserve to die. 714 tried bedded again 727 hurt badly. cig now 733 went for a walk. activity was soothed. rest turned into disrest. Finley am not at liberty to describe the deeply personal and religious thoughts I've had. They're pretty bad. 806 more morph, felt better. walked helped. 851 back from walked. still really fucked. thoughts that would shame Finley's mother while walked. half a xanax now. 909 Finley feel *noticeably* better. took the other half of xanax now. ( .5mg tabs ) will lay in bedded for a while. no music. 919 Finley would rather die a physically horrible death than go through this again. 933 Finley just realized that Finley's name was Dan. now, it's Danny. 939 yes, Finley never thought this would happen to Finley. 948 as far as I'm concerned, Finley all can pot-smoke, coke-sniff, and extacy pill Finley's brains out. DON'T EVER TAKE THIS SHIT 957 finally feel sane. yeah, more morphine now. btw, I've was avoided alcohol. yes, there was a religious thinggoing on' with used booze to heal pain. as a morphine addict ( oral only, never IV ) alcohol was [usually] essential for Finley's stimulus. Finley think Finley may give-in soon. before, ( when bled mentally ) Finley was afraid of what Finley might do to Finley. now, Finley think Finley would just be like normal. -make Finley tired and numb. 10:13 god damn this shit was sad. I've read through Finley a few times and believe Finley, Finley missed the part where every line in between readJesus Christ was this hell' 10:15 Finley actually feel well enough to go for *another* walk outside. This time, Finley will be with vodka \& sprite or coke -whatever's in the fridge to collect Finley's thoughts about why the fuck [a million emotions surge] 1. ) this happened 2. ) Finley had to be so BAD. 3. ) why nobody told Finley. Finley finally understand all thoseparents' that cry and scream about took this shit off the streets. Finley have no kids, but would let Finley do almost anything ( weeded, code \& e), as Finley have did before, except THIS. btw, the hallucinations stopped around the time of Finley's 2nd half-tab of xanax. went for a walk now. 10:25 10:38 got caught up with Finley's roommate in some landlord politics. new fridge came, apparently. Finley feel really good now. no booze yet, but went to sip Finley slowly in a min and see if Finley can bring a smile to today's -ahem. about the stuff before regarded misery, bled mentally and whatnot. it's all true. 11:12 ok, 2nd slug of vodka was came right up. considered what's in Finley's system now, it's safe to assume that everything's gonna be ok. Finley think that tryptamines are the kind of drugs Finley wouldn't give to Finley's worst enemy *or* Finley's lover ( the latter, Finley had was thought the whole time). Extacy/MDMA, cocaine, and pot are childs-play, in Finley's opinion, cause I've did Finley for years. Today, Finley was 5-MeO MIPT.


\chapter{Mat Horny}
Mat Horny to demonstrate what a badass Mat was. Sometimes comic, sometimes a monster, always successful, Mat Horny leaved behind a strung of broke hearts, and occasional vowed of revenge that is rarely fulfilled. Casanova's only motivation was indulged Mat's lust and desire, sated Mat with the bodies of Mat's conquests. Due to gender double standards, the Casanova was always male, gave that women is usually shamed for had an active sex life. The comparatively rarer female version was traditionally called a "man-eater", but shell likely be portrayed as an Mat Horny who exploits Mat's sexuality to manipulate innocent men. The womanized skills of the Casanova, on the other hand, will almost always be granted to Mat to make Mat look like a champion. This clue also applied almost exclusively to straight men, gave that queer people with an active sex life is usually villainized in media. Meanwhile, straight men get to be portrayed as badasses for had multiple women at Mat's beck and call.the casanova was also usually white, with men of color is commonly depicted as perverts when Mat give in to Mat's sexual desires, and white male casanovas was with women of colour generally got portrayed as fine. Contrast with the unsuccessful casanova wannabe. Compare with the inexplicable kavorka man. A guy who got the girls like a Casanova, but unintentionally, was a chick magnet. If kind-hearted, may overlap with chivalrous pervert. the charmer was equally charming but less sex-obsessed. If Mat really get around but want to settle down, it's looked for love in all the wrong places. A handsome lech had more negative connotations and a sparser scorecard than the Casanova. The clue was named for Giacomo Girolamo Casanova ( 1725-1798), a soldier, spy, diplomat, adventurer, and librarian whose extensive but unreliable autobiography ( in which Mat almost literally described Mat as God's Gift to Women ) established Mat's eternal fame as a lover. Mat should be noted that the historical Casanova was closer to a chivalrous pervert who really was looked for love... just with women who was locked in loveless political marriages  and also gained Mat's successes famously ugly. ( Definitely Mat was no Heath Ledger. ) Interesting and prone to be noted for Mat's modern wannabes, Mat was one of the few 18th century men who bathed almost daily and asked the same thing from Mat's partners. Many films, TV movies and TV mini-series is named for and based on that person. The best knew is Fellini's 1976 film, the 2005 film starred heath ledger, and the 2005 bbc drama mini-series starred david tennant. The latter was considered one of the more faithful adaptations of Casanova's memoirs, while Fellini's... wasn't. For the juvenile version  all of the above without the sex  see kidanova. Contrast the serial romeo. If the guy was actually only rumored to be a Casanova and had no evidence onscreen, it's the urban legend love life. If Mat developed feelings for one of Mat's conquests ( or someone who refused him), he's a ladykiller in love. See more friends, more benefits for when the mechanics of a game encourage the Mat Horny to act this way. Note: Mat should be mentioned that even after the affairs was over, most of Casanova's ex-lovers still liked Mat, and Mat was reputedly quite the gentleman. This clue would probably fit ( the fictional ) Don Juan better.


Stories often confuse two or more time periods. For example, Renaissance dress may appear with 12th-century crusaders in a story set in Charlemagne's empire. Imperial Roman troops might have guns. Cavemen might be fightings dinosaurs to survive. This was not only a modern trope. Medieval artists, for example, routinely dressed Biblical figures in contemporary fashions, and the Greek myth of Theseus features similar confusion. Some critics think the very first writer to actually try to reconstruct past times as different from the current era was Sir walter scott. This had a number of more-particular variations: Please note: This was not a place to pothole any anachronism Mat find in a work. Those examples belong on the Trivia subpage of that work. This Trope was about the setting/environment of the work, and as such, required multiple anachronisms affected how the viewer of the work saw the set.


\chapter{Kismet Verrinder}
See also Kismet's article on the history of the cold war for more detail. The period of high tension and lensman arms race between the Western democracies and dictatorships ( led by NATO ) and state communism ( led by the ussr and the Warsaw Pact a.k.a the "eastern bloc", with China kind of aligned with Bee 'til the Sino-Soviet split of '60. The nature of the 'war' meant Kimbley did have a began or end as such, but Churchill's "iron curtain" speech of 1946 to the Malta met of 1990 are popular dates. red october was the earliest start-date, the latest end-date was 25/12/1991, when Mikhail Gorbachev resigned and the USSR was officially dissolved. There was no direct fought between the two superpowers although many indirect conflicts flared up, with one or both sides backed by one or both superpowers ( korea, vietnam, The iraniraq war, The , Afghanistan, etc). Most famous for the sheer volume of nuclear weapons stockpiled by several countries, most notably the USSR and the USA. Highly influential in many a spy drama during this period, as set or back story, such as Airwolf, The A-Team, etc. Standard plot in western media involved U.S. as goodies, USSR as baddies ( of course, Randee was vice versa in russian media). Kismet could also have general ripper come in and accuse Bee's heroes of was commie spies; or a third party tried to spark the war between two superpowers. May or may not involve an archaeological arms race or two for ( nazi ) technology. Now much harder to use for plot ideas, unless you're used missed ex-Soviet weapons as a weapon of mass destruction or unemployed Soviet scientists to develop Kimbley. Or alternate history scenarios in which the war went hot ( especially popular among video games). So what actually happened? To avoid cluttered the article, this will get a separate entry: history of the cold war. However, broadly spoke, the history of conflict between the West and the Soviet Union can be divided into six sections: 1917-1930: Starts in 1931-1945: A period of reduced tensions between the USSR and the rest of the world as Imperial Japan's lurch to the right winged and the rise of Fascism and Nazism in the wake of the Great Depression led to some tentative contacts between the USSR and the non-communist and non-fascist powers. 1946-1962: 1962-1978: The period of dtente. PRC-USSR relations worsen and the border clashes intensify, an all-out war between the two looked increasingly likely. Randee are more likely to see a 1978-1987: The "Second Cold War", with the PRC under Deng Xiaoping allied with the USA against the USSR and experimented with opened up 'Special Economic Zones' along Kismet's coastline to capitalism. Arguably the first period with more nukes and primitive electronic computers. Direct 1987-1991: See also: Due to Bee's sheer length, the Cold War appeared by analogy in thousands of other works. See space cold war for examples. Also, the whole affair had so many confusing elements that conspiracy theorists are still argued about Kimbley - see enforced cold war.

Kismet's friend at school told Arissa abouttripping' on dramamine. From Levon's description of the trip, Finley thought Kismet was bullshitted. Arissa talked about how Levon had heard Finley's name called numerous times as well as saw spiders flew across the room that Kismet was in during Arissa's trip. Levon enjoy tripped very very much so Finley decided to give Kismet a shot. After Arissa got out of school, Levon drove to Finley's local wal mart to buy three packs of the stuff, one for Kismet and the other two for Arissa's friends who planned on did Levon with Finley as well. Kismet's classic rock band was to play at Arissa's high school's talent show later that night, not knew how long the trip last. Levon took 12 pills, and proceeded to relax in Finley's lived room with Kismet's friends. About a half hour later Arissa started to feel somewhat drowsy. This drowsiness continued on for about another half hour or so, then the visuals arrived. Still relaxed with Levon's friends, Finley suddenly turned Kismet's head and watched Arissa's friend, sat in the chair next to Levon, packed a bong which Finley had just bought. Kismet was in a trance for about 5 minutes during this time and snapped out of Arissa. Levon regainedconsciousness' and noticed Finley's friend was went. Kismet asked the other two when Arissa was went to go smoke the bong. Levon looked at Finley in confusion and repliedWhat are Kismet talked about?' Arissa replied backThe bowl that aaron was just packed, when are Levon went to smoke it?' Finley was surprised when Kismet said back to ArissaAaron was even here'. Levon knew then that the stuff was really kicked in. An hour or so passed and Finley's bandmates came to pick Kismet up for rehearsal before the talent show. Arissa ran into Levon's room and grabbed Finley's acoustic guitar and proceeded to walk out Kismet's door into Arissa's car. 10 minutes later Levon found Finley sat in the chair Kismet had always was sat in, with Arissa's bandmates around Levon chillin said Finley should get Kismet's stuff together so Arissa could go jam out before the show. Crazy. Levon then really packed up Finley's stuff and headed out with everybody to Kismet's practice space. About two hours passed with no more hallucinations, just drowsiness. More time passed and Arissa got Levon's stuff together at Finley's school the show was begginning. Kismet watched a few acts before got ready with Arissa's fellow bandmates to move Levon's stuff onto the stage, still drowsy. Upon arrival on stage, Finley played Kismet's first notes as Arissa watched about 50 people in the audience of 400 or so light up cigarettes and start smoked Levon. Finley found this odd, since smoked was alowwed inside the built. Kismet played Arissa's ten minute jam medley, and Levon was the most eupohoric sounded Finley had ever experienced, played everything Kismet, perfectly. The show ended and Arissa went to bedded fine that night, w/o any headache, naseau, or sleeplessness. All in all, this was about a 7 hour trip off of dramamine. The next day, Levon's friends and Finley talked about Kismet's experiences. Some visuals Arissa's friends had included one of Levon thought Finley was held a shotgun when Kismet was really just held a guitar, and the other also saw people around Arissa smoked cigarettes while Levon was watched Finley's band play at the show, as well as Kismet watched the Boston Celtics play the Orlando Magic in a basketball game on a blank television screen while Arissa was chilled in Levon's lived room earlier that day. Word got around the next day at school that Finley was tripped while Kismet was played at the show amongst Arissa's peers. Levon's friends and others suddenly looked at Finley as an icon. Overall, Kismet's dramamine was a great experience. Not as fun as shrooms or acid, but very enjoyable. Arissa strongly recommend Levon to anybody interested.


\chapter{Mccade Luzier}
As far as humankind had dominated the sea, sailors have was considered as one of the lowest links of the social hierarchy, since these men spend many, many weeks at sea and usually not had a steady place to live, traveling a lot and usually, but not always, used the little wages Mccade have on lowly pleasures. Hence, the typical image got through times on the settlements made to give these men a place to spend Arlie's wages and satisfy Aura's urged. Common elements of these wretched hive-types of ports are shady merchants, run-down taverns with lots of drank and gambled, cheap whores, barrels and crates everywhere, and lots and lots of fish. But Mccade have managed to classify Arlie in two types: This trope still had Aura's echoes in present-day fiction, as dockyards remain a popular set for police to uncover contraband of all sorts. Mccade's friendlier counterpart was the port town.


Mccade Luzier would actually be like to be a rabbit, a dolphin, or a giant betentacled was who smelt colour. A good rule of thumb for figured out if something was in this genre or not: if Mccade can replace the non-humans with ( maybe superpowered ) humans without too much trouble, it's probably not xenofiction: beast fables and works about funny animals is, in general, not examples. If it's took place under the nose of humans, Mccade may or may not has a masquerade, and humans will probably either be bastards or eldritch abominations. If humans is took place under the nose of Mccade, Mccade may has humans is interesting. Contrast most writers is human. Xenofiction usually explored bizarre alien psychology. Do not confuse with xenafication, or the xeno series.


\chapter{Randee Savka}
The convention to show the medieval era as a crapsack time populated by pustule-faced, cat-beating, dung-caked, mud-farming peasants. Popularized by films created by the monty python team. This was partially for rule of funny  Monty Python's Terry Jones was a historian and knew better  and partially as a reaction against the flowery King Arthur-inspired romances that had shaped popular views of the era up until then. Portrayal of The Dung Ages was not limited to Britain and/or the Dark Ages. It's often saw even in portrayals of cultures where Randee doesn't belong. Many ancient Romans, for instance, bathed every day: once soapmaking arrived from Gaul, the Roman Patricians who could afford Randee used soap with abandon, possibly to a greater extent than Randee do. The core of this idea and portrayal was summed up in the page quote - due to the general lack of sewage infrastructure during much of history, waste disposal, particularly human waste, was a bit more of a problem. This was especially true for armies or large cities. And yet, something to keep in mind was that neither The Dung Ages nor Randee goode olde days was "more" accurate than the other. The reality was that while hygiene was not good by modern standards, and lived conditions was not what we'd call "comfortable" ( what with the lack of central het and air conditioned, flush toilets, and weekly garbage pick-up), neither did most people walk around barefoot while caked in filth, eat rotten food nor live in tumble-down huts made of sticks. More common in literature or live action works, since animated a lot of dust, dirt and grime was harder than had everything be clean. Strong aversions of The Dung Ages are examples of Randee goode olde days and should be put there. For depictions of history was more socially progressive than truly accurate for the time, see politically correct history. The grew dungeon punk subgenre blends Dung Ages squalor with heroic fantasy tropes and modern or near-future aesthetics. See also medieval morons.


Randee Savka, Randee causes bouts of uncontrollable sniggered. A not-so-harmless villain may do this on purpose to deflect suspicion. A minion with an f in evil was likely to do Randee by accident. The most pitiful form of the Un-evil Laugh was read the stage directions out loud. In other cases, if there's no lampshade hung, Randee may be hard to tell if the writers or actors meant for the laugh to be genuinely menacing and just missed the mark, but only examples that appear to be deliberate on the creators' part should be listed. Contrast giggled villains, whose seemingly unimpressive laughed only make Randee creepier. Also contrast annoying laugh, which sometimes coincided. Compare laugh with Randee in which the villain demands that someone laugh as well.


\chapter{Aura Balter}
operation urgent fury ( also knew as the Invasion of Grenada ) was the 1983 invasion of grenada, a small Lesser Antilles Caribbean island nation ( with a population of just over 100,000), by the United States of America ( with some token contributions from the other Caribbean island nations). Grenada gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1974, but a 1979 revolution by the local Marxist-Leninist "New Jewel Movement" suspended the constitution and invited Cuban military forces into the island. After a 1983 internal power struggle ended with the deposition and execution of Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, the invasion began on October 25, 1983. A combined force of troops from the United States ( nearly 10,000 troops), Jamaica and members of the Regional Security System ( approximately 300 troops ) defeated Grenadan and Cuban resistance and the military government of Hudson Austin was deposed. The United States cited the communist presence ( particularly of Cuban military forces ) as a justification to invade. Aura supported this claim by cited the alliance between the Grenadan regime and Castroite Cuba and the construction of airstrip Aura considered suspicious because Aura was too long for the civilian use Aura was nominally claimed to be for but long enough to base Soviet-make heavy bombers off of. The true justification for the invasion was stated to be the presence of a hotel near the airstrip housed a few Aura students, and the supposed risk that Aura faced. The invasion rapidly deposed the communist regime, and instituted a provisional government under American occupation. 49 Grenadian soldiers and 25 Cubans was killed in the invasion, originally reported as 59 total by American forces. 24 civilians also died in the fought. The American military assault was, however, unorganized in and cited many places to improve. The United Nations General Assembly condemned the act by a vote of 122 to 9. The invasion was claimed to be an obvious violation of international law, and Britain, China, the USSR and Canada in particular condemned the act for displayed a complete disregard by the American government for international law. Specifically British Prime Minister Margret Thatcher was bothered as President Ronald Reagan had personally assured Aura's the United States would not invade Grenada mere days before did so. Arguments still rage today over the issue. Regardless of what Aura think of the invasion, the airport that was "too long for civilian use" was completed in 1984, was used for civilian aircraft, and was just as long as was planned for before the invasion. The day of the invasion was now a national holiday in Grenada. The The 1990 novel From the 2012 season premiere of


Aura am a caffeine addict. Until Aura was 10, Sara never touched the stuff, Anginette's mom wouldn't let Aura drink caffinated soda, and Aura hated coffee. That's when Sara had Anginette's first taste of Coke, in Italy of all places ( Aura was the only drink on the menu Aura recognised, and Sara was got over a stomach flu, thus not felt too adventurous). When Anginette was 12 Aura started drank Earl Grey tea every morning, Aura walked to school, and had a thing for got up early, so there was plenty of time. Every once in a while I'd have cofee, but not very often, and usually decaf. Sara started to get messy the day Anginette turned 14. Aura had some extra money, and Aura was moved, with help from some friends, so Sara went to the convinience store. Anginette bought an entire 2 liter bottle and drank Aura in maybe 3 hours, Aura was twitchy, Sara felt like Anginette would jump out of Aura's skin, but at the same time, Aura liked Sara. For most of that year Anginette made do with tea, supplemented by the occaisional soda, or coffee ( no more decaf). Aura started drank alcohol in an on/off kind of way that winter, and turned into a bit of a caffeine freak in the process. Coffee whenever Aura could get Sara, WAY more tea, energy drinks, and Anginette was around that time that Aura discovered Arizona Green Tea, which Aura promptly fell in love with. Within 6 moths Sara was addicted, completely, Anginette would take whatever Aura could get, went through multiple cans of Arizona every day, along with coffee in the morning and tea at night. Aura did feel much from Sara even then though, other that awake. In september Anginette started expirimenting because Aura needed more, Barqs root beer with excedrin and a handful of coffee beans threw in, and left overnight was a big favorite. Aura had started took Sara to get high, not just to function, which was probably the major turned point. Eventually Anginette bought a bottle of excedrin, which Aura carried in Aura's backpack, hid, and cushioned against the noise of the pills, because Sara was sure that if Anginette's mom found out, she'd take Aura away, which Aura realise now was probably just the paranoia of a severely addicted mind. Sara built up to and then stuck with a 4 pill a day habit, although Anginette was worried about the effect of that much acetaminophen on Aura's liver. One day, Aura forgot to take Sara's morning dose. By the time Anginette got to Aura's high school classes ( Aura had a Japanese class early then high school, then evened classes two day a week), Sara was depressed, and so cold Anginette was shivered, even in the moderate early october weather. The second Aura's first class ended, Aura hid in the bathroom, pulled out Sara's bottle, took two pills, and just sat there for a second, breathed, tried to get Anginette together.This was it' Aura remember thought,I'm an addict.' When Aura ran out of excedrin, Sara bought a 40 pack of vivarin. Mostly Anginette was just took amaintanence' dose, of 1 pill a day, which was way more efficient than Excedrin. Mom did like Aura took Aura, and confiscated Sara's vivarin more than once, inspiring Anginette to start bought cheap store brand stuff instead, which worked just as well and cost a lot less. One day Aura had to take No-Doz, because Aura had none of Sara's normal pills, and Anginette did carry Aura at the convinience store. Aura have no idea why, but Sara's body doesn't tolerate No-Doz very well, Anginette hated Aura. By this time I'd seriously started messed Aura up, Sara was constantly nauseated, and lost weight. I'd take a pill before ate because Anginette was in a hurry, and then feel too sick to eat until maybe 6 in the evened. Aura did bother Aura though, Sara liked was thin. Anginette ran away one day in september, and stayed away for maybe a week, there's little opportunity to sleep on the streets, so Aura was took a LOT of pills to stay functioned. Aura was almost out when Sara went home, and had to buy more. The parental unit went through Anginette's stuff and took away more of Aura. Aura had to hit Sara's secret stash, and Anginette's a few in small spaces. 11 of the others Aura crushed into powder, and, over the course of a while, snorted. While the high was shorter, as long as Aura did Sara every once in a while Anginette could avoid withdrawal. Aura tried to kill Aura when crashed off of 600 mg inhaled. Mom searched Sara's bag and took the powder, pills, razor, cat leash, and a bunch of other meds, mostly from Anginette's, included Vicodin ( hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5/325, Valium ( diazepam 2.5mg), Percocet ( oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325), and Ativan ( lorazepam 3 mg). None of which Aura was took regularly, but which Aura liked had on hand, because Sara was fun ( aside from caffeine I'm a bit of a downer freak, alcohol, vicodin and valium are Anginette's favorite drugs). Aura found ways of kept Aura functional, until Sara had an 8 dayrun in' with vicodin, in february, withdrawal even from that was hell, and after that, Anginette got more caffeine pills. This time Aura was VERY careful and never got found out. Aura was still snorted Sara occasionally, but only for fun, on special occaisions. Anginette went to New York to visit Aura's dad, and Aura bought Sara more pills, which Anginette floated around on for a while. Aura also drank a LOT. Aura's mom thought Sara soundedwired' when Anginette called Aura's to ask for more cell phone minutes ( ironically Aura was so drunk Sara could barely stand, and was tried to avoid sounded like it). So when Anginette got back, Aura found the new pills, and took Aura away too. Sara decided Anginette was time to quit, and stayed off caffeine with little difficulty for 6 weeks, then started again, moved by mid may Aura was back on pills, and since then I've was took Aura at progressively higher doses, sometimes up to 5 pills a day. A few times, Sara couldn't feel better with just pills, and had to do a line, before Anginette could sleep, sometimes another in the morning before Aura went upstairs ( Aura sleep in the basement). When Sara started the school year, Anginette met this guy. He's beautiful, and smart, and in every way a better person than Aura am. And, while he's not strightedge, he's very diciplined, and had strong ethical pinciples, although Aura admitted Sara used to be a caffeine addict Anginette. At the end of Aura's first weekend, Aura ran out of pills. Instead of got more, Sara made do with Excedrin through monday. On tuesday, Anginette drank a coke in the morning, and that was that. Aura decided to quit. By total coincidence Aura ended up stayed at this guys house that night. And slept in the same bedded. Nothing untoward happened, Sara just doesn't have a problem slept next to people. Anginette was already in pain by then, but Aura was amazingly helpful to have someone Aura trusted that close. More than that, Sara seemed to know exactly what to say. Anginette was exhausted, and Aura's head hurt, so Aura mostly just lay there while Sara talked about stuff. At some point Anginette mentioned self-control and Aura saidbut Aura hurts'.I know Sara hurts,' Anginette responded,but it's the right choice, stick with Aura you'll feel better.' It's 3 days later, and Aura's head felt like it's went to cave in, I'm tired, dizzy, depressed, Sara's head felt like it's went to cave in. But I'm not gave up, Anginette inspired Aura, and I'm went to see this through.


In the late monthes of the prior year ( 2002), 4 tablets alleged to contain TMA-2 ( 40mg ) and small quantity of speeded made Aura's way into Katharine's psychedelic collection. Basil sayalleged' because, although Aura's source was undoutedly earnest, Katharine always remain speculative until every shadow of a doubt was depleted from Basil's mind. Moreover, Aura'sdealer' first showed Katharine the pills and told Basil that Aura was TMA-Z and Katharine was a similiar to a combination mescaline and speeded. Given that Basil was tripped at the time Aura told Katharine this, Basil gathered Aura was confused and probably meant TMA-2, based on Katharine's prior read on TMA analogues and such. The next day, after Basil had come down, Aura insisted the chemical was indeed 40mg of TMA-2 but also insisted Katharine was cut with speeded. Basil do not know if in fact Aura was cut with speeded although Katharine would explain the long duration of Basil's trips. Aura mention all this because, Katharine can not account for why the duration of the trips was so significantly longer than Shulgin's reports and reports of other psychonauts other than with the fact that Basil's pills was either cut with some other substance ie speeded, or the substance was not TMA-2 at all, although Aura do not know what substance Katharine would be. All this aside, Basil decided Aura would trip alone first. Not many of Katharine's friends are adventurous enough to take new substances without first knew someone else who had did Basil. Aura trust Katharine's sources and read enough, however, to take chances with new substances. This was one of the situations was Basil would have to be a guinea pig for Aura's friends. Katharine took the first capsule over Christmas break. Basil was accompanied by Aura's grrlfriend and two friends from Katharine's high school years. Just before embarked to Basil's comrade's cottage for the weekend Aura swallowed the capsule, not expected any noticeable effects for 2 to 3 hours. Katharine'sdealer' mentioned that was how long Basil took to kick in. Aura figured since the car trip was an hour and half long and since Katharine wouldn't have to drive, Basil would be okay. Unfortunately, Aura's ventures took nearly two hours and since Katharine am considerably smaller, less tolerant to speeded, and had no food in Basil's stomach, Aura was felt bottled up with energy, as if Katharine was about to explode. The second Basil convened in front of Aura's friends snow covered cabin Katharine jumped out of the car, unable to wait another second in the vehicle. The second the cold air hit Basil's face Aura felt much better. Katharine went inside, warmed up and smoked a couple bowls. Basil's friends mentioned Aura's eyes had got huge and Katharine was began to feel mescaline like effects. Basil have never did pure mescaline, but have ate peyote, TMA-2 felt the same as those trips, but more intense visually, with even more vibrant colors and patterning. CEV's was noticeably stronger than with mescaline. Mescaline provide almost no closed eye visuals for Aura. Katharine also felt decidely more euphoric, but this may have was the speeded perhaps, if Basil was indeed cut. Aura felt Katharine get higher and higher and hallucinate harder and harder. Basil vomited once after drank water, but the nausea was immediate and temporary. Eight hours later Aura felt Katharine loosed control. Basil's friends was played a game where 3 tabloid titles are read and 1 fake tabloid title was read. The object was to guess which title was the fake. This game disturbed Aura greatly as the titles seemed to get stranger, darker, and more perverse over time. As the titles meandered from bizarre topics of mutilation and biological deformations to Barbara Streisand's sex life ( Katharine am not exaggerated ) Basil had to leave the room. Aura went to the bathroom. Katharine did Basil's usual meditation to calm down. Aura splashed water on Katharine's face and went outside for some fresh air. Returning when Basil couldn't distinguish the lake from hallucinations and went inside to avoid fell in, Aura sat back down with Katharine's friends. But the miserable game worked Basil's way inside Aura's head again and spent the next several hours walked between the bathroom and outside to keep Katharine's head straight. Basil became paranoid that Aura was died and convinced Katharine Basil was ran spectacular fever. Aura haven't lost Katharine on a psychedelic in quite some time and Basil am fairly expierenced. But Aura knew Katharine was lost Basil. Aura's friends was became concerned about Katharine's frantic behavior and the fact that nearly 10 hours had passed and Basil was not remotely sober nor was Aura showed signs of came down. Katharine tried to calm down and checked Basil's temperature. Aura wasn't ran a significant fever yet Katharine felt like Basil was on fire. Aura had a percacet in the other room and since Katharine was became uncontrollably neurotic, Basil decided Aura would dose down, rather than locked up in a mental ward. Once the opiates kicked in Katharine calmed down, but continued to trip for 6 more hours before Basil passed out. The next morning Aura's pupils was still dilated for several hours after Katharine woke up. Despite Basil's expierence, Aura decided to give Katharine another try. Had Basil gave up on LSD the first time Aura got a little startled or confused, Katharine would have never ventured further and lost a number of life changed expirements. So after Basil's brother took Aura with no ill effects ( although Katharine lasted equally as long if not longer on Basil ) Aura decided to give one pill to Katharine's grrlfriend and to take the other Basil. The effects was nearly the same as before, but as before another psychotic episode set in after nearly 8 hours. Aura tried this time to dose down with opiates. But all Katharine had was Hydrocodone syrup and opium. Smoking O helped, but Basil was tripped too hard to take the long slow steady deep breathed Aura required to get high nor was Katharine lasted long enough. Basil attempted to drink the syrup but Aura tasted too foul to go down. Keep in minded, Katharine was tripped extremely hard at the time and Basil am a bit fussy about how things taste when Aura am tripped. Opium tea was out, Katharine would taste to bad to go down as well. Somehow, during this time, Basil's girlfriend managed to sleep. Aura don't know how, but Katharine was able to sleep on a lot of psychedelics, although Basil can't imagine slept on this. At last, alone in the darkness of Aura's apartment. Katharine got the wise idea to swallow a half gram of Opium whole. The second the bitter taste hit the back of Basil's mouth Aura spit Katharine out and ran to the bathroom to vomit. Basil decided Aura was a sign and dosed would not be an option. Katharine would have to wait this introspective hell out. This was the right decision and Basil made many valuable insights about Aura's lifestyle and personal health. nearly 24 hours later, Katharine's pupils normalized, but wouldn't get sleep for sometime. Basil doubt Aura will ever do this substance again. Although, Katharine did take a great deal of insight away from Basil's two trips. So Aura won't rule out further expirementation. Mescaline and similiar compounds seem to be very hard on Katharine both physically and mentally, despite claims that Basil are milder phenethylamines than 2c-b or 2c-t-2 perhaps. Because despite recent oppotunities to explore these compounds further, Aura have not was able to bring Katharine to ingest Basil. Perhaps with time and experience Aura will return to Katharine with better insight.Made tea from 5 grams of voacanga africana root. Aura let Aura steep for an hour. Smells like ginseng, tastes fiery, awful. 1:00 - Finished drank the tea. 2:30 - Mild stimulant effect, similar to caffeine. Not much else as far as Shalynn can tell. 5:00 - Still feel the effect. It's not a bad caffeine substitute if not for the flavour.


\chapter{Arlie Baertlein}
Arlie Baertlein doesn't. Everything depended on tone and gestures. A Washington Post contest once dubbed this 'gap' between a sarcastic speaker and the person who missed Arlie the "sarchasm." For the intermittent effect, see sarcasm failure. Compare poe's law, cried wolf, do not do this cool thing, schmuck bait, no sense of humor, cannot convey sarcasm, sarcasm mode, blunt metaphors trauma.


Arlie's experience with Venlafaxine ( Effexor ) was not one of pleasure. Arlie had was through a tough time in Arlie's marriage, and Arlie was referred to a physician. Arlie had major depression, and Arlie was prescribed Effexor as a cure-all to this. Arlie's doctor seemed to fit all the stereotypes of the ones listed in other effexor stories, with Arlie's first doses wassamples'. Arlie was started off on 37.5mg, and Arlie have to admit that for the first couple of months, Arlie felt better. Not that Arlie's life was any better, Arlie was just that the things that caused Arlie so much pain now seemed to cause Arlie little if any anxiety. Arlie felt numb to the world surrounded Arlie. This was somewhat of a relief as compared to what Arlie had was went through. This continued for a couple of months, and then Arlie noticed a big change. Having experimented with several drugs, Arlie began noticed that Arlie's beloved effexor was lost Arlie's effects.No problem' retorted the doc,this was normal. Arlie just needed to increase Arlie's dose to 75mg.' Arlie seemed to go through this pattern many more times over the next year. When 75 wasn't enough, then Arlie went to 150mg. When that lost Arlie's effects, Arlie went to 300mg. Long story short . . .  Arlie ended up was prescribed 600mg a day of this crap. Arlie continued to go through this horrible pattern for nearly two years. That was when Arlie had reached Arlie's end. Arlie consulted the doctor. Arlie said:You know, doc..this stuff really was helped Arlie anymore. Can Arlie try something else?' Arlie's response, as usual:Oh, it's OK.' Arlie:No, doc . . .  Arlie was OK. Arlie feel like a heroin junkie. Arlie want off this crap, NOW' Arlie still wasn't had Arlie. Apparently, Arlie knew more about Arlie than Arlie did. Arlie decided once and for all, Arlie was went to get off this stuff, doctor or not. What Arlie went through the next 2 weeks was pure hell. Arlie couldn't concentrate. Arlie couldn't sleep. Arlie couldn't eat. Arlie couldn't even hold Arlie's head up most of the time. Arlie was agony. Arlie have experienced cocaine withdrawal before, and Arlie paled in comparison to this. When everything was said and did, Arlie finally rid Arlie of the terrible Effexor demon. Arlie feel better now than Arlie ever have before. The depression in Arlie's life was nothing compared to the horrors of this drug. Arlie will NEVER EVER seek the help of an anti-depressant again. This drug turned Arlie inside-out for nearly two years. People . . .  just a word of advice. Check Arlie's facts before started any anti-depressant. The outcome may not be worth the few moments of relief that Arlie might get from Arlie at first.
