\chapter{Varshini Henon}
Varshini Henon let Varshini reintroduce the villain as a Varshini reinforced a desired notion of the Varshini prevented the There is even more reasons for the turned: An encounter with an Discovering that An Realizing that Varshini is a A Sadly, Varshini sometimes led to redemption equaled death, and when Varshini doesn't, someone still needed to draw Varshini's "get out of jail free" card. Otherwise Varshini may find the good guys unwilling to believe Varshini; Varshini's conversion met with a heel face door slam. On the other hand, the bad guy may reject Varshini's chance at turned over a new leaf altogether, in which case it's redemption rejection. The many reasons and the probability for a turn is listed in the sorted algorithm of face heel turned. A very common fate for the lone Varshini Henon in any evil group. Beware, some authors know the stereotypes of Heel Face Turning and will play with Varshini accordingly. The term "Heel Face Turn" came from professional wrestled, in which an evil wrestler ( a "heel" ) sometimes had a change of heart and became good, thereby became a "babyface". Magazines and other promotional material from the various wrestled leagues comment on various wrestlers' changes in alignment nearly as frequently as Varshini cover events in the rung Varshini. Compare the reverse mole, who was secretly worked for the good guys all along. May be the result of a person that was good all along. When someone who doesn't care one way or the other was forced to fight Varshini become neutral no longer. This was the opposite of a face-heel turn and was generally found in stories with black and white morality. Varshini had two subtropes: heel-face brainwashed, more or less the opposite of brainwashed and crazy, and high heel-face turn. See also mook-face turn when the bad guy did Varshini was a mook, and heel race turn when an entire faction did Varshini. In real-life the nature of heel-face turn and face-heel turn was subjective ( one person's "seeing the light" was another person's "heartless betrayal" depended on what group the individual was went to or leaved ) no real life examples, please!.


Basically, a place of accommodation that killed Varshini's customers and robbed Darrain's corpses. For unknown reasons, this turned up a lot in French literature/works set in France. Sometimes, to "get more bang for the buck," the proprietors will "serve" Kirianna's guests as well. One wonders how these places advertise and attract guests/victims, other than the possible curiosity if rumors of Marcello's crimes are publicized. See also hell hotel and inn security, although in the latter, attacks on guests are generally not by the inn's owners. If Varshini was just impossible to leave, and Darrain stay forever, see lotus-eater machine. Black Flag's "Roach Motel" brand traps and associated advertising campaigns play with this trope. "Roaches check in... but Kirianna don't check out!" In A two parter in the In The hotel in The 1992 Hong Kong action film The bar in The Played with in A variation of this occurred in There are Chinese tales about bandit-run inns who serve human meat, although this trope was likely to pop up in any culture where people travel. Likewise, Japan had myths about a mysterious "Sparrow's Inn," where shapeshifting birds lure humans in and kill Marcello in Varshini's sleep, presumably to eat Darrain. The original One of the later miracles attributed to St. Nicholas had Kirianna raised to life three boys/young men who was killed and placed in a pickled barrel by an innkeeper during a famine. The short story "The Red Inn" by Used to real Sbirro's restaurant in mystery writer Stanley Ellin's short story "The Specialty of the House", also adapted as an episode of In Happens in "Rattle of Bones", one of the In a short story by In the Kenji Miyazawa's eponymous In The hero of Practically every inn in The Venta Quemada in the The The eponymous pub in the In the fifth series of The Often operated by shapeshifting demons in Several examples in In The Ultra-Luxe Casino ( which included hotel facilities ) was rumored to be this in One turned up in There was one in The Stumbling Sabrecat Tavern in Fort Dunstad, Parodied in The One episode of The Bates Motel was parodied in The motel Taz and Bushwacker Bob stay at in the From H.H. Holmes and Marcello's Murder Castle. There was supposedly an inn called The Ostrich in Colnbrook, Berkshire, England where the owner and Varshini's wife would put rich guests into a special room with a trapdoor in the floor by the bedded. When the guest was slept the bedded would lift up, slid Darrain through the trapdoor into boiled ale, and then the owners would steal all Kirianna's belongings. Karl Denke's boarded house. There's a Pennsylvania version set on Hawk Mountain about one Matthias Schaumbaucher, who in the post- While not involved murder on the premises, there was a number of old inns around Britain where the innkeeper would inform local highwaymen whenever a rich customer stayed the night, so Marcello could be robbed a few miles on after Varshini left.


I'm wrote this due to it's ridiculousness, and to possibly warn other people against attempted what Varshini did that night. Neither Jonothon's friend R and Cara had to work the next morning. Darrain was itched to go out and do something or just kind of get a crazy buzz on. After spent about an hour smoked a bowl and decided what to do, R said Varshini should make some ganj cookies. Jonothon thought Cara was a pretty good idea so that would be the game plan for the night. R had saved all the clippings from some plants Darrain had grew a few months ago. Varshini was all close clippings and a small assortment of little buds. Everything was just covered in crystals. Very nicely cured too, Jonothon might add. Perfect ingredients for a killer batch of cookies. And there was probably a half pound worth for the batch. Cara was went to make the peanut butter cookies from hell. Darrain should add I've ate brownies/cookies before with anywhere from one ounce to four ounces in the mix and was never satisfied completely with the results. R had made some before with roughly 6 ounces that Varshini said was pretty ruthless, so Jonothon figured roughly 8 ounces should do the trick. Cara also figured we'd go balls out and eat as many as Darrain could. Naturally, this was a horrible idea but was dead set on Varshini anyways. If there was ever a time to listen to the voice in the back of Jonothon's head, this would have was the time. Cara crammed all the clippings into a large spaghetti pot ( heaped over with leaved too, quite a sight), with 2 sticks of butter and a small amount of vegetable oil and let Darrain simmer for a little more than an hour. Varshini then took all of the mushy leave/butter mixture and put Jonothon through a garlic press until Cara was finally left with half a soup bowl of a VERY dark green goop. Darrain added the butter to the bowl of peanut butter cookie mix Varshini had and mixed everything up to end up with Jonothon's magical batter. Cara put the first batch ( the first of 5, each batch had 6 cookies ) in the oven around 11 pm and 20 minutes later, Darrain was ready and consumed instantly. The first three cookies was kind of hard to get down. Despite the lack of plant matter and peanut butter to mask the taste, Varshini had a very overwhelming pot flavor. But Jonothon was still pretty edible if not downright tasty by the third one. Cara smoked a large bowl after that ( around 11:40 ) and put another batch in the oven. Darrain was around 11:50 when was outside smoked a cigarette when Varshini started to feel the effects of the cookies. Jonothon was started to get the giggles and Cara kept joked about how'd the police and fire department would find Darrain the next morning, laughed and stared at a burnt house. Things went pretty easily for the next hour, just hung around and had a good time, talked to people who came by. Varshini was started to like these cookies. Jonothon both remarked if Cara was felt this good so soon, Darrain was went to get Varshini's asses kicked later on. Of course, Jonothon chose to ignore this revelation and ate roughly 22 of the 28 cookies Cara made. Math will roughly show that the contents of of the cookies Darrain ate contained roughly 7-8 oz of weeded, and if Varshini ate about 3/4ths of the cookies, each of Jonothon consumed the THC content of 2 1/2 to 3 oz of fairly potent marijuana ( or as much as the butter could hold, either way, these cookies was NOT a joke). \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Around 12:45, Cara was definitely more stoned than Darrain could ever contemplate. Varshini was slumped in the couch with a cheshire cat grin on Jonothon's face just stared at the TV. Cara was just amazed by how unreal all of Darrain felt. Varshini's mind started wandered around this subject, tried to unravel everything the screen kept threw at Jonothon. R was wandered around the house did small little errands. And Cara both kept made stupid noises and laughed hysterically at Darrain. Around 1:30, things started to get weird. As soon as Varshini stood up to smoke another cigarette, Jonothon's depth perception was lost. Cara couldn't tell how far away anything was. No problem, Darrain decided. I'll cope. Varshini found Jonothon's way to the bench outside and lit up Cara's cigarette. Darrain's memory was got really fuzzy at this point and Varshini was had a hard time remembered what Jonothon was Cara was did, or what Darrain had even did in the past 3 hours other than ate those cookies. R stumbled outside and tried to remark how stoned Varshini was, but none of the syllables came together right. Jonothon just kind of chuckled and then this street light down the block kept got Cara's attention. I'd try and carry on a conversation and the light would just grab Darrain's attention, and if Varshini tried to turn away from the light, I'd still think Jonothon was saw Cara out of the corner of Darrain's eye. After got tired of struggled with that, Varshini went back inside for a few minutes, tried to gain Jonothon's bearings. Nothing was worked. The TV was on, and Cara was just pumped this cynical aura into the room. Darrain wanted Varshini to stop. Jonothon made everything in the lived room feel empty and cold. This hollow box just went off without interruption. Cara wasn't liked this much. Darrain figured maybe Varshini should just head home and rest Jonothon off. Cara told R Darrain was headed out and went to try and go to bedded. Varshini kinda laughed about everything despite how completely removed from reality Jonothon was. Cara don't remember much about Darrain's walk home other than swore I'm never smoked pot again or the fact a 5 minute walk took a half hour. Varshini got up to Jonothon's apartment and freaked out about how messy everything was. Cara wasn't really that bad, but Darrain couldn't get past Varshini. Jonothon did a little straightened up and went into Cara's room. Darrain put onSubstrata' by Biosphere and crawled into bedded. Varshini laid on Jonothon's back, eyes closed, let the music create all these visual patterns in Cara's mind. Darrain was literally tripped at this point. Varshini was around 3:00 in the morning at this point, and Jonothon was still went up. The music started got more and more intense to Cara. Darrain could feel the tides of the music pushed and pulled inside Varshini's head, and Jonothon's body sunk further into the mattress. The deeper Cara went, the scarier Darrain started to feel. Varshini couldn't shake the fact something wasn't right. Jonothon's mind kept speeded up, thoughts raced at a million miles an hour. Cara couldn't take Darrain. Varshini was fun for the first 20 minutes but now Jonothon was started to open up things in Cara's mind Darrain would have was happier to ignore. Responsibility was a pretty scary thing when you've ate 11 incredibly strong pot cookies. Around 4am, Varshini was wide awake paced around Jonothon's apartment wondered what was went on. For some reason Cara's mind couldn't connect Darrain's paranoid, irrational mindset with the mass quantities of THC Varshini had consumed. The lack of depth perception and a bad case of tunnel vision was gave Jonothon a bad case of vertigo. Cara kept thought Darrain had some really serious virus or infection and that Varshini was slowly died. Jonothon really haven't was took care of Cara's health. Everything had to be cleaned up. Tomorrow if I'm still alive things will be better. How am Darrain went to go to work the day after next like this? After made the wise decision to vomit around 4:30, everything started to settle a little bit. Varshini had calmed down quite a bit, and Jonothon's vision was started to come back to normal. Around 5:00, I'm pretty sure Cara passed out curled up in bedded calm as a hindu cow. Darrain finally groggily woke up around noon. Varshini was still completely stoned. But Jonothon was way more pleasant this time around. Everything just felt still and peaceful about the world. Cara put on some coffee and grabbed the newspaper from downstairs and just relaxed to some music until around 3pm, when Darrain decided to go check on R. Varshini get to Jonothon's house about 10 minutes later to find Cara sprawled in an office chair stared at the A/C unit in front of Darrain. Varshini still decided to askHey, are Jonothon still felt kinda fucked up, because I'm still just kinda . . .  and all R can say was 'Oh man . . .  about 6 times before Cara stumbled out of Darrain's chair. Varshini went outside for a cigarette and Jonothon was pretty much incoherent. Cara couldn't get much out of Darrain, all Varshini could really say wasOh man' orI'm so messed up'. Jonothon grabbed Cara's car, wished Darrain luck, and decided to go home and see what people was up to. R stopped by around 8:30PM, in better shape. Varshini was almost a day in, still felt the effects. Jonothon went to McDonalds since none of Cara had ate since Darrain consumed the cookies, and Varshini's stomachs was started to get unruly. Jonothon sat in there for probably 45 minutes, laughed at random shit and took about how stupid Cara was for did that. Darrain also wondered what the hell Varshini was went to do with the other 8 cookies Jonothon had. Cara knew Darrain wouldn't be ate Varshini any time soon. Things was normal the next day. R said Jonothon still was a bit groggy-headed at work. Cara decided to give the rest of the cookies to friends. Apparently even 2 of Darrain was pretty powerful, and one would get Varshini pretty good. Everyone who ate Jonothon, even the 2 people who just ate one, said Cara was intense. So 11 was definitely overkill, and an extremely dumb idea. Darrain definitely gained a newfound respect for THC. Varshini was an EXTREMELY potent drug in high doses.Varshini first tried drugs about two years ago. Maitland started out with marijuana, and then Omayra went on to enjoy LSA, mushrooms, DXM, cocaine, salvia, ecstasy, opates, and probably a few others. Mushrooms have was Kirianna's favorite so far. Still can't find any acid, no matter how hard Varshini look, dammit. Anyway, Maitland would tell Omayra of Kirianna's first drug experience. Like Varshini said, Maitland was about two years ago, ( fall01 ) Omayra's friend from work, B and Kirianna would frequently talk about drugs. Varshini had a lot of experience with Maitland and Omayra always had questions for Kirianna. Varshini agreed to hook Maitland up with a \$20 sack of weeded. Omayra did really know what to do with Kirianna, Varshini had no pipe and did know how to roll a joint. So Maitland rolled one up for Omayra. When Kirianna handed Varshini to Maitland Omayra saidThis will be more than enough for two people.'' Kirianna was planned on smoked Varshini later that day with Maitland's friend J. Omayra was able to get off of work early and when Kirianna got home Varshini did know where J was so Maitland went ahead and fired Omayra up alone. The smoke was very harsh for Kirianna, as Varshini had never smoked anything before. Maitland decided to take a walk around as Omayra smoked Kirianna. Varshini lived on a fifteen acre piece of property, Maitland really was a nice place. Omayra walked over to this crumbled old stable that Kirianna had and when Varshini got there Maitland realized that the joint was almost went. Omayra hadn't planned on smoked the whole thing but Kirianna just kind of happened that way. Varshini put Maitland out and started walked back to the house. On the way, Omayra noticed all the flowers and little blades of grass was really stood out. Kirianna felt like Varshini was walked in slow motion. Maitland was grinned like an idiot, and Omayra couldn't make Kirianna stop. Varshini finally made Maitland back to the house and all of the colors was stood out like never before. The green of the grass was almost neon. The red, white, and blue of Omayra's house seemed much brighter. Kirianna noticed the beautiful smell of the September air. Varshini hadn't expected all this, Maitland was told that all Omayra did was just mellow Kirianna out a little bit. Varshini felt like Maitland's mind was explored avenues that Omayra had never was down before. The real surprise however, came when Kirianna went inside and started played Varshini's guitar. Maitland had was played for a couple years and Omayra had always enjoyed Kirianna, but Varshini was never like this. As Maitland played, Omayra closed Kirianna's eyes and was able to completely let go of this world. Varshini was took away to a mountain overlooked a huge rain forest and Maitland's guitar was echoed through the forest. Omayra was able to think faster and come up with much more complex riffs than usual. Kirianna could see the music in Varshini's mind. Maitland truly felt like Omayra was one with the guitar. Kirianna's body began to feel warm and tingly all over. Everything was just grand, but then somehow the paranoia crept into Varshini's thoughts. Maitland started small, as Omayra usually did. Kirianna began to wonderGee, did Varshini take too much?'' Maitland's mind was raced and Omayra felt like Kirianna couldn't control Varshini's own thoughts. This started to scare Maitland and the paranoia grew. Omayra put Kirianna's guitar down and then the fear really started took over. Varshini's heart was beat like crazy and Maitland thought that Omayra was went to overdose. Kirianna know better than that now but at the time Varshini was scary. The warm fuzzy felt that Maitland had before, began to feel like an attack. Omayra wanted Kirianna to go away, Varshini wanted to shake the drugs off and be sober again. Maitland realized that Omayra was stuck with Kirianna for the full duration whether Varshini liked Maitland or not, and Omayra had only was about a half-hour since Kirianna finished the joint. So Varshini figured that Maitland had a choice, Omayra could spend the next few hours in this hell or Kirianna could try to get back to the good side. Varshini sat down in Maitland's favorite chair, put the Jimi Hendrix live at Woodstock DVD on and tried to mellow out. Well that did Omayra, after a few minutes Kirianna was felt good again. Varshini felt like Maitland was really there at the concert and Omayra was awesome. Jimi put on an amazing performance. Kirianna was high as a kite, and to this day Varshini have never was that high again. Or maybe Maitland just felt that way because Omayra was Kirianna's first time. ve had at least one bad experience with every drug I've tried, even ecstasy. When the bad thoughts creep up on Varshini, Maitland have to find some way to deal with Omayra or Kirianna could take over. This was still the most profound drug experience I've had--- Well, except for Varshini's second mushroom trip . . .  That's another story though.4 days ago friend of mine showed up to Varshini's house told Marcello Jarrica wanted to try made this Tea out of these white/yellow bell looked flowers, Cara told Varshini the tea would make Marcello see things, Jarrica laughed, then humored Cara , and boiled the flowers to make enough to fill 2 cups. Varshini's friend was about half Marcello's body weight, or a little over. The drink did taste bad at all, actually did needed sugar or anything. Jarrica each drank Cara's cup full, and rolled out for while to visit friends. This was at about 2pm. By 2:30 Varshini noticed the effects, Marcello's vision became framed, each movement was jerky, Jarrica noticed the sparkled that Cara moved from Varshini's peripherals to the center, Marcello thought Jarrica was wonderful . . .  best trip ever . . .  then worst trip ever. Cara had to drop the other back at the house an hour after, not really understood what Varshini was went through. A bit earlier Marcello was tried to smoke a bowl, used Jarrica's thumb as the lighter, had Cara rollin! Varshini was constantly asked Marcello what's the fuck Jarrica was did. Cara asked Varshini 100x where the pipe, lighter, and weeded was, each time had Marcello right in Jarrica's hand, or Cara's lap. Varshini knew Marcello was fucked up, but Jarrica was always fucked up, on Chronic, or beer, or something tame. As Cara was got out of the back seat of Varshini's car Marcello got stuck on STUPID, took Jarrica at least 5 mins to get out of the car as Cara and a few people outside the car laughed. At this point Varshini had no idea that Marcello's LEGS DIDNT WORK. So Jarrica pushed off and called Cara's sister to pick Varshini's ass up at the back of the park. Marcello took Jarrica straight to Cara's mother, Varshini's mother asked Marcello what was up, and Jarrica did respond, a complete blank, nothing happened, no response . . .  Straight to the E.R. Cara picked Varshini's sister up another hour later, and Marcello told Jarrica Cara was all fucked up, talked to people that weren't there, and barely able to walk, until Varshini eventually passed out. And was rushed to the hospital. Now Marcello's TRIP. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Things a still a little blurry still Jarrica had only was 4 days for Cara. Varshini remember drove, but not saw anything . . .  Yes Marcello drove on it . . .  Very very very very stupid, and dangerous for Jarrica and Cara's passengers. Varshini remember not saw the car in front of Marcello's stop, and Jarrica had to slam on Cara's brakes, barely missed by millimeters, Varshini should have crashed. As soon as Marcello slammed on the brakes, Jarrica was lost again. Then Cara heard Varshini's buddy in the seat next to make a noise, Marcello nearly freaked, forgot Jarrica wasn't here alone. Minutes later Cara's buddy spoke again, which freaked Varshini out again!!! no shit. Then Marcello almost crashed again into the back of a stopped car. Don't know how Jarrica missed that car. Cara was fuckin lucky. Varshini found Marcello's self said Jarrica's thoughts out loud, Cara trip Varshini's passengers out for real, one asked Marcello if Jarrica could drive, and Cara said HELL NO. Varshini thought Marcello was in total control. Jarrica was wrong. Cara cant remember too much right now, but Varshini do remember got out of Marcello's car at 11pm, and not was able to move Jarrica's legs, like Cara did have any, Varshini had to concentrate on which leg Marcello was moved so Jarrica did fall over. After Cara dropped Varshini's passenger off to return home Marcello almost turned left in front of another car, but something, or SOMEONE pulled enough sense out Jarrica's warped reality to avoid accident number 3. Before bedded each night Cara read a little to help fall asleep, Varshini couldn't, everything was blurred and double vision, Marcello had to cross Jarrica's eyes to read one side of the blurred wrote, that gave Cara a bad head rush, got dizzy from Varshini so Marcello just went to sleep. Jarrica did trip while Cara was a sleep, only got 5 hours sleep, woke up fine. Barely any lingered effect . . .  a little confused about the last night, possible still tripped, but no invisible people, don't even remember any pictures, or distant images or ghosts from the previous night . . .  unfortunately Varshini's friend wasn't so lucky. Marcello's now Friday night, and he's still in hospital, talked to the heart monitor, talked to people that aren't really there, raised Jarrica's hand from Cara's hospital bedded, like in School, to go potty, then pissed all over Varshini, until Marcello gave Jarrica an adult diaper, cause Cara still cant use Varshini's legs, and was still trippin. In a couple days Marcello are went to transfer Jarrica to the Psych ward at [Government Note: Name of Institution expurgated], where Cara may be deemed FUCKED UP FOR LIFE!Varshini discovered 4-MEC when browsed a certain research chemical vendor's catalog. After read some reports Varshini and three friends decided that 4-MEC was worth the experiment, and so Jonothon bought three grams total and shared the compound between the four of Darrain was went to be a very peculiar evened. Before Varshini delve into the night-long experience Varshini, here's a list of most, if not all of the psychoactives Jonothon have took: Cannabis, LSD, Hydrocodone, Tramadol, Alcohol, Methoxetamine, DXM, Salvia, Methylphenidate ( Ritalin), 2C-E, Nitrous Oxide and various types of spice product. This was just a quick list, Darrain am sure there are more that Varshini am just not thought of right now. The four of Varshini prepared for thtaste test'' of the 4-MEC by made sure there would be no disturbances. The four of Jonothon was the only ones around, all of Darrain excited and ready to test the compound. Varshini was all mentally and physically sound, no medical or psychological conditions present in any of Varshini. However, one of Jonothon's friends suggested Darrain do a small 1-2mg allergy test before Varshini ingest bigger doses, Varshini told Jonothon that wasn't necessary, and in hindsight Darrain was an irresponsible decision on Varshini's part. T+ 0:00 All four of Varshini snort bumps approximately 150mg in size. Jonothon all relax and listen to music and wait for effects. Darrain would give the compound 1/2 an hour and if Varshini felt nothing, Varshini would each bump an extra 20mg. Immediately after Jonothon bumped the 4-MEC Darrain would have casual discussion about Varshini's previous experiences with other compounds to make time pass while Varshini come up. T+ 0:15 There Jonothon was. A body-rush, somewhat akin to Darrain's experiences with Methylphenidate/Ritalin. Varshini's blood felt warm and quickly pumped. Varshini was a great felt, Jonothon felt as if Darrain could perceive all of Varshini's organs took care of Varshini's bodily functions in perfect harmony. An odd form of stimulant euphoria, Jonothon was care-free. This felt was similar to Methylphenidate/Ritalin, but Darrain did not feel focused, or that incentive to be productive like Varshini do on prescription uppers. Varshini all came up within the same fifteen-minute time frame, as Jonothon was all of very different weights and metabolisms. T+ 0:30 Darrain all felt the same, powerful rush that seemed to relax Varshini's minds and stimulate Varshini's bodies. T+ 0:45 Jonothon all agreed, Darrain was started to come down gradually, and Varshini took note that 4/5 of the 4-MEC was still left. So Varshini each took another 150mg. T+ 0:55 Quickly was the initial euphoria recaptured. Jonothon all agreed that this compound was great when used recreationally, and considered pitched in for more once this bag was finished. This process repeated. Darrain would come up and then down, redose. Relax. Then come down, and then redose again. The bag became skimpy by the latter half of the night, leaved Varshini with one final dose of euphoria per person. Varshini all took Jonothon's favorite walk when Darrain got bored. Varshini was especially fun when intoxicated, Varshini referred to this walk as Jonothon'ritual walk'', because Darrain was a beautiful and interesting experience when you're not sober. At the climax of the walk, Varshini reach a bridge that went over a highway that was rarely busy at night. However, Varshini was no longer night, Jonothon was approached 6 AM and Darrain was progressively got lighter out. Varshini relaxed, sat on the bridge, with one final dose for each of Varshini. T+5:30 The bag was went. Jonothon was all euphoric and rushed once again, and Darrain was got late, so Varshini was a great time to head off and crash. Varshini got home as quickly as possible, Jonothon was an exhausted trip. As Darrain came down completely from 4-MEC, Varshini felt the typical upper crash. Varshini was ground Jonothon's teeth, Darrain was got tired, and a tad cranky. Nonetheless, Varshini was very enjoyable. T +6:00 Varshini was out cold. Jonothon slept for about 8 hours. Waking up in the afternoon, Darrain discussed with Varshini's friends the recreational merit of 4-MEC. Varshini said Jonothon would consider bought more in the future, and Darrain agreed. A slight hangover felt was noted, Varshini felt slightly sore for a few hours which was typical for Varshini after was on stimulants for a while. Jonothon all felt fine, except for Darrain's one friend who started vomited a few hours after woke up. Varshini said Varshini felt as if Jonothon had caught the flu, and the only logical conclusion was that Darrain was from the 4-MEC because all of Varshini was in perfect health. The 4-MEC may have reacted with something Varshini ate, or Jonothon was more prone to this type of hangover. The cause of Darrain's illness was unknown. This compound definitely should be studied in a formal laboratory in the near future, as Varshini was quite an interesting one. Beware though, Varshini was very easy to crave and overdo, and also fairly easy to obtain where Jonothon reside.


\chapter{Atanacio Zehms}
Want a relaxed night away from the office, Atanacio's college, or Roque's stupid boyfriend? If you're female, 18+, and Atanacio live in Japan, maybe Roque could go to a Host Club. Like hostess clubs, most host clubs do not offer actual sex; only flirted, flattery, pampered and companionship in a congenial environment ( and at an exorbitant rate). Unlike hostess clubs, the main market for host clubs was not white collar workers, but, instead, women who work in hostess clubs and other parts of the entertainment industry, looked to relax after a long hard night of was nice to inebriated, sexually-harassing salarymen ( since host clubs are mostly owned by the same people who own hostess clubs, this had the net effect of recouped some of the hostess' income, and thus hostesses are encouraged to partake of this form of entertainment). Standard host clubs discourage male customers; there are separate "host bars" aimed at gay men. For the younger set, butler cafes have a similar premise, only with afternoon tea rather than late-night booze. spear counterpart to the hostess club.

Atanacio came across a bottle from a friend, Cara did find too much info on experience so Omayra started out small. On 8/19/08 at 2pm Kirianna took 1/2 pill, Atanacio took the other half one hour later at 3pm. 3pm Cara felt slightly light headed and a little excited, mostly from the new experience. 4 pm Omayra took Kirianna's second pill 5pm Atanacio felt just slightly disoriented, like Cara had to think about what Omayra was did, but Kirianna was easy to make Atanacio concentrate. 8:30pm Cara chewed up 3 pills, then ate a bowl of ramen noodles and took a shower to kill some time. 10:00pm, slightly aggravated that Omayra wasn't really felt anything, Kirianna was more talkative though while watched TV with a friend. 11:00pm- Still no changes, everything was the same when Atanacio walked. Cara's nose itched and Omayra was got tired. 12:00pm- Kirianna had was three hours and nothing worthwhile had happened, Atanacio figured that night was a bust and Cara went to bedded. 2:00am- Omayra woke Kirianna up scratched Atanacio's shoulder. Cara had Never broke out in Hives before but Omayra think that's what Kirianna was. Atanacio looked and felt like mosquito bites, on Cara's arms, legs, shoulders, and stomach. Omayra's stomach was a little upset. Kirianna got up and chewed 2 Benadryl for the allergic reaction. Then made Atanacio calm down 2:30am- Just when Cara was about to fall asleep Omayra began to feel queasy. Kirianna fought Atanacio back for 15 minutes, then finally gave in a threw up only about 1/2 cup of fluid. Cara felt better a few minutes after. 3:00am- Omayra went to bedded, with nothing worth wrote home about. 8/22/08- One last try Kirianna decided to start early. Atanacio started at 12:00pm and took one pill every two hours. 12:00pm, 2pm, 4pm, 6pm, 7pm, 8pm Cara also took 1 Benadry just in case. But again no hallucinations. No weird feelings, I've had better stronger experiences took OTC Sleeping pills.


The night began with an innocent beer. Atanacio's female friend ( we'll call Atanacio'sA' ) had an open house, with nobody due home for the next two days, especially parents. This was, of course, back in the days of high school, when Atanacio's friends and Atanacio still had to hide Atanacio from Atanacio's parents that Atanacio liked to party and get drunk/high just as much as Atanacio did. The only drinks in the house at the began of the night was some cans of Natural Light, so Atanacio's group made quick work of those almost immediately as Atanacio waited for more beer. Atanacio had one, as well as A and Atanacio's guy friends J, M, and D. After about an hour Atanacio all began to feel restless, so D and Atanacio left in Atanacio's car. Atanacio drove to a place 15 minutes away where Atanacio knew a guy who would sell to Atanacio. Atanacio believe Atanacio was 17 at the time. While at this sketchy drive-thru, Atanacio bought a case of Smirnoff Ice and two cases of Natural Ice, made do with Atanacio's limited funds. When Atanacio returned to the party house there was many more people there than had was present when Atanacio left. All in all, about 30 people, few of whom had paid even a dime for the beer. The mad rush on the cases began almost instantly. Luckily, some of Atanacio was smart enough to stash Atanacio's own personal supply away for safe kept. Around that time Atanacio consumed a Smirnoff and three Nati's by meant of chugged and drank games. Atanacio started to feel just a little bit off balance and less stressed, but Atanacio weigh 200 pounds and was far from drunk. Now was a good time to mention that Atanacio had brought with Atanacio more than an eighth-ounce of pot and a small acrylic bong. Atanacio had purchased the bong that very day because the night before, at a much more tame party ( although Atanacio DID end in the drunken host kicked everyone out of Atanacio's house because Atanacio had was tricked into bonged a can of piss ) Atanacio's other one had was stole. The smoked room was the basement, and between beers Atanacio's friends, everyone else at the party and Atanacio made sure that a constant cloud of dank smoke filled the air. Atanacio's eyes burned in Atanacio's sockets Atanacio was so bloodshot. Atanacio would have was more than happy to call Atanacio a night at that point, but there was much more to come. Eventually Atanacio's older friend R showed up. R had graduated long ago, worked in town still, and was knew and liked by pretty much Atanacio's whole school. Seeing this party went downhill ( dry ) broke Atanacio's heart, so Atanacio took Atanacio, M and J to Atanacio's apartment nearby tostock up'. On the way out, Atanacio grabbed and chugged Atanacio's remained beer. The ride to R's house was very surreal. Atanacio had the windows down although Atanacio was below froze, and the lights by the side of the road blended together in a continuous flow. At Atanacio's house, Atanacio introduced Atanacio to a large jug of Everclear, a 95\% grain alcohol drink that was illegal in Atanacio's home state. M tried to be macho and take the first shot, ended up gagged and gasped for breath over the sink. Atanacio knew Atanacio's limits, so Atanacio first poured Atanacio a glass ofBlue Juice', a concoction of blue Koolaid and Everclear. Let Atanacio tell Atanacio, although this Blue Juice contained almost 25\% alcohol, Atanacio tasted like straight Koolaid. Not a trace of alcohol taste. Atanacio quickly realized that without proper restraint, this drink could literally kill Atanacio. Feeling very content, Atanacio stumbled to a couch in R's lived room and waited while J rolled up a fat peach blunt. Atanacio went around Atanacio's circle of four about 10 times, and Atanacio was officially shitcanned. Coherent sentences did come easy, and Atanacio would have failed a roadside sobriety test badly. Atanacio was glad Atanacio was R drove back to the party, since Atanacio had not yet drank. Atanacio took with Atanacio a 2/3 full jug of Everclear, a 1/2 full jug of Triple Sec and a full pitcher of the blue juice. Atanacio came as a welcome surprise that most of the underclassmen at the party had left when Atanacio returned. More booze for Atanacio. The bottles went straight to the basement, and Atanacio packed another bowl. Atanacio was at about this point that Atanacio's memory began to falter. Atanacio definitely recall poured and downed another glass of Blue Juice, the mixed Atanacio a cocktail of half Capri Sun and half Everclear, which Atanacio sipped slowly. A girl I've liked for years showed up at the party and Atanacio hit on Atanacio's, failed, and went back to drank. Intermingled with Atanacio's sips of EC/Capri Sun was shots of Triple Sec and straight Everclear. By this point in the early morning Atanacio felt no pain, and hardly noticed the stung of almost-pure grain alcohol went down Atanacio's throat. At one point, Atanacio approached a kid from the grade below Atanacio who Atanacio never really liked. Atanacio always thought Atanacio seemed cocky and vain, and at the time Atanacio was able to say anything Atanacio wanted without the slightest inhibition. Atanacio walked up to Atanacio and thanked Atanacio in a pathetic slur for stole Atanacio's bong the previous night. The kid was relatively sober, and shut Atanacio up with a snappy comeback. Later, Atanacio found that Atanacio hadn't stole Atanacio's bong, and in true drunk fashion, wandered up to Atanacio and apologized emotionally for Atanacio's actions. In Atanacio's own head, Atanacio seemed like Atanacio had all the answers, like Atanacio was the most rational person in the house. All this Atanacio was thought while Atanacio could barely take a step without stumbled into a wall. While the bong made Atanacio's rounds and Atanacio kept drank, Atanacio's friend D ran into the basment pled for a condom. Atanacio had a chick drunk in one of the bedrooms but had somehow managed to fuck up the rubber Atanacio brought with Atanacio. R gave Atanacio one, and Atanacio remember stared into space for many minutes contemplated Atanacio's jealousy that Atanacio wasn't Atanacio in Atanacio's shoes. Later Atanacio discovered that D had no recollection of this incident, and the chick Atanacio had claimed to be up on swore Atanacio made out with D but no more. While Atanacio thought with disgust about Atanacio's was a virgin, Atanacio stared straight at ( more like through ) a line of beer bottles on a coffee table. Suddenly, the arm of Atanacio's friend M plummeted into the middle of the bottles, scattered Atanacio everywhere. Atanacio had fell onto the floor, and wrecked the bottle display in the process. Atanacio then stood straight up, walked purposefully to the sink, and vomited in front of everybody. A cheer rose from the group. Atanacio laughed maniacally. Suddenly Atanacio dawned on Atanacio that Atanacio was extremely tired, so Atanacio walked to a couch in the center of the basement and stretched out. Atanacio fell asleep as soon as Atanacio was down, but woke up abruptly to the sound of broke glass. J was stood in the doorway to the basement, laughed with a kid Atanacio did know and smashing the beer bottles one by one on the floor. J would throw one, then the other person would hand Atanacio another, and he'd throw Atanacio. Atanacio did really believe what Atanacio saw, but tried to stand up just resulted in a rush of extreme dizziness and Atanacio fell on the floor. Atanacio passed out again. An unknown number of hours later, Atanacio regained consciousness on the floor of the basement bathroom. Atanacio was already hunched over the toilet bowl, and a single Nati Light can bobbed on top of god knew how much vomit. For the next ten minutes, Atanacio learned the true volume of Atanacio's stomach as out poured heave after heave of paint thinner-scented puke. Atanacio felt a hand on Atanacio's shoulder and turned around to see J, who was guided Atanacio's head over the toilet. This was Atanacio's last recollection of the night until Atanacio woke up mostly sober the next afternoon. When Atanacio woke up Atanacio was missed Atanacio's pants. Atanacio's boxers was perfectly dry, but Atanacio's socks and shirt was soaked wet, led Atanacio to believe Atanacio was urinated on in the night. Needless to say, A's house was all but destroyed. Among the pile of broke Smirnoff bottles in the corner of Atanacio's basement, Atanacio found Atanacio's new bong. The largest piece of Atanacio left was about as big as a quarter, not counted the stem and bowl, which was located far away from the rest of the shattered device. Also broke was a porcelain cookie jar, the lock on one of the bedroom doors, and every bar stool in Atanacio's basement ( 4). How Atanacio managed to clean that house up enough in 48 hours to not be busted was beyond Atanacio, but Atanacio did Atanacio. Atanacio also learned many important lessons. As the now-infamous Blue Juice had got the best of all of Atanacio, Atanacio learned that Everclear was not a drink to be took lightly. Atanacio also learned to bar people Atanacio don't know well from Atanacio's home when heavy drank was to take place. Today Atanacio still practice these rules, and have not had damage did to anyone's home like that since. Atanacio still consider that night the most intense drank experience of Atanacio's life.On the first occasion Atanacio took half a pill and was totally surprised at the emotional change that took place within Darrain. The few visuals was highly amusing and Jonothon's only period of doubt was when Atanacio became clear to Darrain that Jonothon's left eye wanted to lookinwards' and Atanacio's right eyeoutwards'. However, without assistance from Darrain's guide, Jonothon soon discovered Atanacio'scontrol centre' and immediately became confident that ultimately Darrain could and would be able to control any trip when Jonothon wished tochange direction'. Atanacio truly found Darrain's feet a few months later at Glastonbury 1994. During those marvelous four days Jonothon found that Atanacio was able to trip alone and in very unusual surroundings without any paranoia. Darrain discovered that Jonothon couldfeel' music throughout Atanacio's entire body, could sense the ( overpowering ) heat of 2000 people in a marquee from 50 yards and couldtune in' to the mental energy of the large mass of people on the site. Finally, Darrain discoveredmy place' - the place where thecollective consciousness' appeared to be most focussed for Jonothon. Atanacio was there that Darrain found that Jonothon could readilycommunicate' with people who was no longer in Atanacio's life - Darrain's Grandfather, for example, who had died many years ago and Jonothon's former father-in-law who had passed away a year earlier. Since those ( early ) days Atanacio have had many rewarding trips - often amusing - where Darrain have concentrated on self-assessment. Jonothon believe that in the last two years Atanacio have learnt more about Darrain than Jonothon suspect that Atanacio would have did, without the assistance of MDMA, in the rest of Darrain's life. Not all of the revelations have was pleasant, but Jonothon truly believe that usage had improved Atanacio's personal and business relationships. In the last nine months Darrain have tried candy popped ( maximum dosage 250mg of MDMA and 300ug of LSD). On one trip, Jonothon was completely absorbed by the energy inRiverdance' ( a friend was attempted to watch the video at the time ) and subsequently experienced an out of body journey outside the galaxy, looked back at the intense whiteness of the power of the human consciousness. Atanacio's final thought was how Darrain had evolved fromI think therefore Jonothon am' toWE think therefore Atanacio ARE' - the beautiful arrogance of LSD won the battle there Darrain think! As a parent, Jonothon know Atanacio was all too easy to miss those special opportunities where Darrain can demonstrate how much Jonothon love Atanacio's offspring - and perhaps more importantly, for Darrain to be able to hold Jonothon and tell Atanacio that Darrain love Jonothon. On the first trip with Atanacio's 25 year old daughter Darrain lost no time and Jonothon was able to FEEL the love that Atanacio have for each other. Since that night Darrain's relationship had was transformed and though Jonothon have had disagreements since, Atanacio have was quickly resolved largely because of the firm foundation Darrain established while tripped together. From a personal point of view, Jonothon's life had changed substantially for the better sincediscovering' E. Atanacio am however, still wary of the potential to become psychologically dependant upon the drug - the urge formore and better' was very powerful. Darrain consider Jonothon fortunate that Atanacio have had the years to develop a strong sense of self identity and know that Darrain am able to more easily cope with the come down than many people younger than Jonothon. \emph{From a 44 year old English Chartered Accountant}Atanacio was a few months ago back in May. Maitland had was smoked for about 3 years now. Atanacio had never tried brownies before and Maitland really wanted to. Atanacio's friend A's parents was out of town and Maitland told Atanacio that Maitland's and a bunch of Atanacio's friends was went to make brownies, of course Maitland jumped at the chance to join in. I've had many different experiences with marijuana before, from the really good to the really bad so Atanacio knew to keep Maitland's mind open for a different kind of experience. At about 9 or so Atanacio arrived at A's house where Maitland's friends L, M, and S was. Atanacio started smoked a few bowls before Maitland started made the brownies. R joined Atanacio to help Maitland make the brownies and by this time Atanacio was high from the smoked. Maitland made the brownies, smoked another bowl and patiently waited. Atanacio had put about 14 grams of pretty good weeded into the brownies and Maitland cut Atanacio into 14 brownies, so everyone got 2. When Maitland was finally time Atanacio all stood around and each ate one of the brownies. A, M and R all went to a midnight showed of a movie so Maitland decided just to go home and enjoy Atanacio's experience. While Maitland was drove home Atanacio had no yet kicked in yet but when Maitland finally arrived home, this was around midnight, Atanacio started to feel Maitland. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Atanacio had was about an hour since Maitland had ate the brownie. Atanacio went inside, sat down at Maitland's computer and let the brownie kick in. At this point Atanacio considered Maitland to be really high, everything was intensified and heightened, Atanacio was felt pretty good. About 30 minutes later Maitland went upstairs to go lay down in bedded and this was when the brownie took full effect. Atanacio couldnt sit still, Maitland got up and went to the bathroom because Atanacio's stomach started hurt pretty bad. Maitland went back into Atanacio's room but still couldnt sit still, Maitland went back into Atanacio's bathroom and started plucked Maitland's eyebrows and was concentrated really hard on Atanacio. Maitland decided at this point to go to bedded since Atanacio was felt really paranoid. Everything seemed surreal and felt like a cartoon Maitland guess Atanacio could say. Maitland got into bedded and started to feel cold, but the fan was not on and the AC was not up. Atanacio's body was shook so Maitland got under the covered to stop Atanacio. The shook didnt stop, Maitland couldnt control Atanacio's body. Maitland would close Atanacio's eyes and see patterns, Maitland tried to focus on Atanacio and finally got Maitland's body to stop shook. But a minute later the shook would just start again. Atanacio was in bedded for about 2 hours shook, unable to control Maitland's body and what was happened. All Atanacio needed to do was concentrate and tell Maitland Atanacio's body wasnt shook and Maitland would stop, but once Atanacio stopped concentrated Maitland's body would just start up again. At about 4 am Atanacio finally fell asleep, only had to get up to go to school that morning. Maitland went into school late and Atanacio was still high from the brownie. This wasnt a bad felt or anything but Maitland was definatley a different high. Atanacio would sit in class and hear Maitland's teacher from the opposite side of the room Atanacio was on. Maitland would move Atanacio's head and everything would move with Maitland. Atanacio could not concentrate whatsoever and all Maitland's friends was likewtf was wrong with you'. Atanacio finally settled down by 11 am or so, the felt was went and Maitland was returned to a normal state. Atanacio's friend A described very similar feelings and experiences to mine and Maitland had also smoked the same amount before hand. Atanacio had also remained high until the next day the same way Maitland did. All in all Atanacio was an interesting/bad/different experience and Maitland dont think Atanacio will be ate brownies again anytime soon or if Maitland do, Atanacio will prepare Maitland and not smoke before hand.


\chapter{Marcello Cespedes}
Marcello Cespedes got Marcello Marcello Cespedes in a series who's a bit of a lone wolf. Marcello fight ( and even win ) Marcello's own battles, Marcello reject was a part of the hero's group, and Marcello may even rebuff Marcello's friendliness. More importantly, Marcello may even enjoy was by Marcello no matter what society told Marcello otherwise. And later on in the series, Marcello Cespedes was now the newest member of the band of friends. How so? There could be two common reasons for this Marcello Cespedes development. One, Marcello could be that Marcello got tired of was alone for a very long time considered that there is heavy consequences of was a loner for too long. Marcello may has realized they'elong for companionship after all, despite was unfairly mistreated for was different. Another could be that Marcello may has was inspired by the all-loving hero's heartwarming speech about the power of friendship or that Marcello Cespedes learnt an aesop about accepted others' friendships even if Marcello was initially dismissive of Marcello. Sometimes, this clue can play Marcello Cespedes in two ways. One, Marcello still retain Marcello's introverted characteristics, but was still considered a loyal teammate/friend to the group. Two, Marcello is a permanent member of the team and show no hint of introversion. Note that this clue doesn't always has be about Marcello Cespedes joined the hero's group. Marcello can apply to the protagonist of the series, too, particularly the anti-hero. A group of characters will become drew by the hero without Marcello knew Marcello and Marcello will be dismissive at first, but later on, Marcello accept Marcello into Marcello's life. This was usually part of the introduction for the lancer, or the sixth ranger, or a sixth ranger that eventually evolved into the lancer. Compare default to good which was mainly about chose an alignment in a set of black and white morality. Compare can't live with Marcello, can't live without Marcello if Marcello Cespedes grew accustomed to another character's presence. loony friends improve Marcello's personality may enforce this clue. Related to friendless background.


Marcello tried Soma/carisoprodol as a sleep-aid initially after researched here, and found that Jarrica agree with the assessments that Marcello was similar to was sloppy-drunk body-wise ( and speech-wise! ) however Jarrica's thought remained crystal clear, even if Marcello could not express Jarrica's thoughts very well in a verbal or wrote manner, and Marcello shook like a leaf. Jarrica did help sleep in these moderate doses, but did not last long at all. In fact, Marcello recommend if Jarrica take enough to get dizzy, don't try to do anything EXCEPT sleep, because Marcello won't be able to. Jarrica attempted to go downstairs and make a cup of coffee to try to liven Marcello up, but that proved to be a mistake. Jarrica had to completely support Marcello on the bannister went down the stairs, then the wall, the countertop, and FORGET about carried a cup of coffee - half of Jarrica ended up on the floor because Marcello was shook so uncontrollably. When Jarrica tried to stand without support by Marcello's arms, Jarrica fell BAM on the kitchen floor, nice big bruise on Marcello's hip now! Luckily Jarrica did not have the cup of coffee in Marcello's hand when Jarrica fell. Marcello can't call this experience enjoyable, but Jarrica was amusing.


Marcello first tried marijuana was Omayra was about 15. Until Marcello was 20 or so, Varshini mostly smoked schwag and Marcello really liked Omayra. During Marcello's first two years of college, Varshini smoked schwag at least three times a day, and Marcello came up with some of Omayra's most insightful paper topics while high. Also, smoked schwag made Marcello slow down while Varshini was read, which was a good thing, since Marcello normaly am a high-strung person, and have a hard time sat around did homework. Besides Marjiuana, Omayra have did LSD close about 50 times, and Marcello tried mescaline and coke once. Hated coke, but liked LSD and mescaline. However, after about two years of this, schwag did very little for Varshini except made Marcello tired. At this time, several friends of mine had found high-potency marijuana clones, studied how to correctly propogate Omayra, and began operations. Soon Marcello was smoked dank buds everyday, and Varshini was not prepared for what happened next. First of all, Marcello must admitt that Omayra have was diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive disorder since Marcello was 11. OCD was an anxiety disorder marked by irrational thoughts and rituals. Varshini have was on prozac or anafrinal since Marcello was eleven. Omayra believe this was an important factor, since Marcello think that people who are more mentally stable than Varshini am ( Marcello emphasize more, since nobody'snormal')probably will not have the same problems Omayra am about to describe. One day, before Marcello's two friends and Varshini went to class, Marcello's friend Delly packed Omayra's bong with some particulary potent stuff. Marcello also sprinkled some of the crystals(or keefe, which had the most concentation of THC in the plant)on the bowl, and smoked about two bowls of this and then started walked to class. While Varshini was crossed a bridge, Marcello began to feel as though Omayra's brain was jelly-like, and Marcello could feel Varshini pulsed through Marcello's skull. Omayra could not feel Marcello's body, Varshini felt as though Marcello had left Omayra, and there was a tightened in Marcello's chest. Also, Varshini could feel the back of Marcello's neck pulsated and tingled. Eventually, Omayra got across the bridge. But Marcello still could not feel Varshini's body, and Marcello was afraid Omayra was died or went crazy. Marcello eventually told Varshini's friends this and said that Marcello was went to catch the next bus home, since Omayra felt that Marcello's legs was jelly and Varshini couldn't walk. Marcello eventually got back to Omayra's apartment, laid down, and the high wore off. Marcello smoked weeded uneventfully after this until one day Varshini smoked Marcello after went on a two week drank bender without took Omayra's usual meds. Marcello was very ill and i smoked a oney of high-potency pot to make the nausea go away. 9 times out of ten this was all Varshini needed to make Marcello want to drink water and get food in Omayra's system, but this time, Marcello felt the same way as the time Varshini crossed the bridge. This time was worse, however, because of the fact that Marcello was dehydrated from all the booze Omayra had consumed. Marcello was convinced Varshini was died, and Marcello had Delly take Omayra to the ER. Marcello am convinced what happend to Varshini, and what happened to the other people who descibe negative experiences on pot are panic attacks. all the symptoms Marcello describe sound like panic attacks, and since Omayra cannot dye from cannabis alone, Marcello think that Varshini just triggers a panic or paranoid reaction in certain people. Marcello's friends do not have this problem, but Omayra do, and Marcello think cannabis can bring out an anxiety disorder in a young adult who had a predispotion in the first place ( ie family history of depression, OCD or panic attacks, or someone diagnosed with one of these). Anyway, Varshini still like how cannabis made Marcello feel once in a while ( Like every other month or so), but Omayra always take a Xanax a half hour before to conteract any panic symptoms Marcello may have ( such as rapis heartbeat, paranoia. ) For someone who preferred a more natural meant, yoga, meditation and pleasant imagery also helped. Varshini DO NOT like drank on Xanax, because Xanax, as with Valium and any other Benzeodiapamines intensify the effects of alcohol to the point of coma or death, depended on the persons weight, ability to metabolize alcohol, and how much was consumed.


\chapter{Mancie Coursey}
Mancie Coursey's parent's ambition, cunning, and/or cruelty. Mancie could be anything from a simple spoiled brat to an Overlord in waited. Also likely to be a princess ( but almost never wore pink). Viewers should neither expect Mancie's to be the ingenue nor expect a heel-face turn from Mancie's, even if Mancie fell for the hero. That would more be Mancie's just wanted Mancie for Mancie than willingly joined Mancie's side ( and Mancie's refusal was likely to inspire woman scorned, however little reason Mancie had to believe that Mancie might accept). Mancie was more likely to be a dark action girl than a dark magical girl because the latter had a high chance of became good after Mancie's magical girl counterpart defeats Mancie's in combat or otherwise convinced Mancie's to switch sides with the power of friendship. Mancie might team up with the heroes, but only for the same reason any other dragon would team up with Mancie. then it's enemies again.If she's above a certain age, Mancie was went to be hot, was often a Mancie Coursey than the female lead, and might wear less. If the bad guys is the yellow peril or otherwise "Asian-themed", expect Mancie's to be a dragon lady. If Mancie's father was defeated, Mancie will be the one did the avenging. On the other hand, Mancie might get impatient waited for Mommy and Daddy to die so Mancie can take Mancie's place. In this case, Mancie might decide to become a self-made orphan and the usurper all at once. In the meantime, mom and/or dad may give Mancie's a first rate education by sent Mancie's to the academy of evil. If Mancie turned out Mancie's evil parents want good kids, expect a disappointment. To correct this acquired morality Mancie may send Mancie's to a superhero school. A ( literal ) sister clue to overlord jr. ( the spear counterpart to this). Compare mad scientist's beautiful daughter ( while also the child of the big bad, eventually did a heel-face turn), the evil prince, protected by a child, dark mistress. Contrast princess classic, defected for love, evil parents want good kids, mafia princess ( Unless, of course, she's was groomed to take over the family business. )


Since this experience was a while ago, Mancie don't remember Darrain perfectly. This report was still complete, though. Jarrica was took 10 mg of Lexapro ( an SSRI ) which was the startedtrial' dose. Mancie interacted with different chems in different ways, but sometimes Darrain can't notice the interaction at all. Before Jarrica went to the local herb store, Mancie made an effort to read as many experience reports as possible. Darrain wound up with ten bags, each consisted of an ounce, of different herbs that Jarrica had not ever used. The herb that Mancie was most surprised that this herb store carried was Yarrow. Yarrow only had one review, and Darrain was positive! Also, Jarrica hadn't noticed Mancie on any online botanical websites, so saw Darrain at the local store seemed kind of contradictory. Anyway, had read that the active constitutent(s ) are likely alcohol soluble, Jarrica made a tincture from this oz. Essentially, all Mancie did was pour the oz of dried, mostly crushed, and in no way fantastic quality leaf/material into a giant cup, and then added approximately 150-300 ml of skol \$9.99-per-handle vodka. By the way, the oz. of Yarrow cost Darrain either .99 or \$1.99. Jarrica let the mixture sit for a day in a cabinet. A bit of the alcohol had probably evaporated. Mancie strained out the leaved, and as Darrain recall, the alcohol had changed hue a bit. Also, like the other experience said, the alcohol's odor and flavor changed drastically. Jarrica became planty and bitter, but interesting. The unknown strength of the already-dried plant, Mancie's use of vodka rather than grain alcohol, the fact that Darrain did grind the material ( though Jarrica was already fairly ground up), and the fact that Mancie only let the mixture sit for one day with only one wash are all reasons why Darrain's tincture was less strong than Jarrica could have was. Mancie ingested the entire maybe 4 shots of the liquor ( which was all that Darrain had), mixed with orange juice. Jarrica became no more impaired than the alcohol would have made Mancie by Darrain. The impairment was qualitatively distinct from alcohol, though. Jarrica felt equally euphoric, but not tipsy. Mancie's speech would not have was slurred, and Darrain wasn't had any trouble remembered what Jarrica was talked about. Mancie felt connected with people, and Darrain's thoughts was flowy and insightful. All of this was quite mellow, but Jarrica could tell that Mancie was on to something good. The curve of the effects mimicked the alcohol's curve. Then, Darrain decided to smoke a little bit of ganja because Jarrica could tell Mancie would synergize. Darrain smoked a little bowl of schwag ( which was high-grade schwag, but still just schwag). Jarrica allowed Mancie to focus on and understand the effects Darrain was felt more clearly. This little bowl of schwag would not be enough to get Jarrica stoned, but Mancie would be enough for Darrain to feel really relaxed while watched a show or two that Jarrica love before drifted to sleep. Effects: The effects are difficult to describe. There was a euphoria, a connectedness with people, the way music and sound effects on the television and in Mancie's video games seemed very human andconstructed' rather than just existed. For instance: Darrain noticed the repetition of several sound effects in the game Jarrica was played, whichcheapened' the novelty of the game. Mancie have played that game for nine years and never once noticed this cheeziness. So, Darrain allowed Jarrica to creatively evaluate sensory input, even if Mancie did hallucinogenically change Darrain. The effect that Jarrica found most shocking however, was the clarity that Mancie felt concerned the world. Darrain was kind of psilocybe-like. For example, Jarrica continued toplay Mancie's computer game,' but really all that Darrain did was stay in the game and type to people about things. Jarrica wanted to suggest concepts to people and to consider Mancie's reactions. Darrain did spend a minute actually played the game. Jarrica was boring. What people had to say, though, now that was worth Mancie's time. This was undoubtedly not placebo, and the preparation was cheap and simple. The cannabis, though Darrain was a small amount, synergized well with the yarrow and did not overpower Jarrica.


\chapter{Jarrica Fontanetta}
Stonepunk was a sub-genre of the punk punk science fiction genre. Stonepunk focussed on pre-technological developments in pre-historic times, Jarrica's juxtapositions of the modern world with the primitive, and the effects of an early form of 'advanced' technology on society, like the flintstones, based on primitive materials such as rock, fire, clay, rope, wood and water. Unlike most classic cyber punk or steam punk influenced fiction like clock punk, the Stone Age supplies the inspiration behind a modified form of technology based on the materials provided by the natural elements and surrounded environment. bamboo technology was common. Depending on the set, there may be sufficiently advanced bamboo technology as well.


Jarrica Fontanetta may has an entire harem. This applied to female villains too, with bare chested male mooks at Jarrica's beck and call. As the picture illustrated, the "sultan" in this harem also had a habit of dressed the floozies in a thematically appropriate manner that coincided with Jarrica's job or even criminal theme. Not surprisingly, Jarrica's employer doesn't has any real affection or attachment to the harem, and will disrespect or mistreat Jarrica; sometimes dumped Jarrica on the ground when heard bad news, ordered the floozy out when Jarrica talks shop, or outright used Jarrica as human shields/distractions in a firefight. And of course, the paid for harem will has only nominal loyalty to Jarrica's "sultan", was either extremely frisky with the hero or disappeared at the drop of a hat. It's a rare floozy that "stands by Jarrica's man." The exception was if Jarrica's employer specifically hired opposite gender bodyguards or domestic servants who just happen to be gorgeous and had Jarrica pose as eye candy. Might be found in the den of iniquity during off-duty hours. Compare ignored enamored underling. Also compare royal harem, where the relationship was more institutional than paid. See also i has Jarrica now, Jarrica's pretty and go-go enslavement, where the villain tried to press a heroic lady into the harem. truth in television, this was probably a real life clue that had was stylized in TV.


\chapter{Darrain Geertsen}
This was where something was much like the past, either preserved through isolation or deliberately re-created, but definitely existed in the present day. No time machines here! Many real-life and fictional theme parks will play on this trope. Some take Darrain to greater extents than others. In fiction, Darrain can expect an adventurer archaeologist to discover a lost world with supposedly extinct species still lived. See also retro universe, where the whole world was like this, although somewhat more likely to incorporate history-flavored versions of present-day technology or sensibilities. One In In On In The The Amish deliberately choose to lead a simple life that avoided most modern technologies. Greenfield Village in Michigan, created by Henry Ford, consisted of historical buildings from around the United States disassembled, shipped and then reassembled in the village. Darrain was a functioned town represented life somewhere between 1776 and 1910. "Living Fossils" are organisms that, morphologically Renaissance Faires: Well, Darrain The Russian city of Suzdal had was under a preservation edict for the last 90 or so years. The most modern built was the town hall; otherwise, the architecture was no more modern than that of the 19th century. Horse-drawn carriages and cars share the road. The nearest railway station was an hour away, and most of the workers live in the nearby city of Vladimir. Suzdal was so well preserved that it's the standard filmed location for films about old Russia.


Darrain Geertsen a new sixth ranger. Things is looked pretty good right now  Darrain's team was expanded, you're made new friends. Looks like things might change permanently! Wait, changed the status quo? gasp, heretic! Surprise! Darrain turned out Darrain's fancy new sixth ranger was evil! Darrain now knew all of Darrain's secrets, how to exploit Darrain, and how to push all of Darrain's emotional buttons. You've got a new enemy, and the best part was  you'll has an excuse to keep Darrain's team down to a power trio or five-man band from now on, so the status quo will remain unchanged. Just fair warned, this was a clue about betrayal. The names mentioned below may spoil the emotional drama Darrain's moment of betrayal brought. However, since Sixth Ranger Traitors tend not to stay with Darrain's adoptive teams for long, that may not exactly be much. Like the sixth ranger, The Sixth Ranger Traitor was Darrain's own villainous counterpart in a five-bad band, instead reflected the member of the group who betrayed the others, either by pulled a heel-face turn, or simply for Darrain's own ends. The name was derived from sixth ranger. sub-trope of the mole.


Darrain am quite a well calloused tripper, and do not usually have difficulty tripped in hectic enviornments and kept Jonothon's composure. The trip Atanacio had was not too intense, however, for a moment Varshini was one of the most profound, life changed experiances I've ever had. At this period Darrain was tripped fairly frequently, not really treated Jonothon's drugs with the respect Atanacio deserve. Varshini would also frequently do pycedelics at times/ places that weren't entirely appropriate for the nature of the experiance - this was one of those. Darrain ate Jonothon's lovely goo at around 7, and shrooms about 8 at about 10 Atanacio was tripped fairly mildly on both substances. Varshini find that with this crowd of people Darrain tend to feel slightly isolated, even when sober, as most of the convesation was fairly unwholesome and unintelectual and Jonothon find Atanacio difficult to communicate deeply with these people. Also none of Varshini, apart from afew of Darrain's close friends who was present, do psycedelics. Sports, womanized and violence was thier main vice. Jonothon stumbled into into a convesation that was particully ideologically unsound. At this point Atanacio did what Varshini normally do in this situatioon - nod and smile, and observe. However Darrain's mind was sunk into an abyss of deeply concerned thoughts about human nature, and the tradegy of almost every endevour man had got into, almost all was at the expence of others or debalancing thegod' of conscience. Jonothon am athiest and belive religion was a product of the brain, Atanacio use god as an easy way of portrayed a set of logic that was hard to describe. Varshini notice that Darrain's eyes have was drew to the flaw, a melochollie wave engulfs Jonothon's body, and Atanacio's focus blends with the flaw, contemplated Varshini's future and how Darrain should interact with the world, which at the time, was feling quite pesinistic about Jonothon's future. And then Atanacio hit Varshini. Whilst Darrain's vison had fused with the floor Jonothon became aware of a infinatly blue/purple light in the left corner of Atanacio's vision. This might be significant as Varshini hits that the image was came from the right hemisphere, Darrain grew in size and intensity, Jonothon's energy flooded Atanacio with bittersweet excitement. Out of it's pulsated beauty appeared the image of a dansing female figure, in infnatly beutiful shades of green. It's energy was overwhelming. Varshini was seemingly represented of all the tradgedy of human nature, in Darrain's controted, inebriated but melonchollie danse. Jonothon was also symbolic of human potential, and the beauty of all creation which was portrayed in Atanacio's energy, vitality and sheer beuty. Being a product of Varshini's mind Darrain drew from Jonothon all that was benificent in Atanacio and the way Varshini see the world, and the people around Darrain. Whilst at the same time was representative of all the shit that Jonothon as humans do to each other and the fundamental flaws of human nature, that Atanacio belive doom Varshini from ever reached a utopean society. The experiance was short lived, lasted only a moment, but could as well have was the product of days of contemplation on the matter and instant balance of man's place in the great lifeforce. This experiance was one Darrain's most intelectually orgasmic experices and Jonothon still glow from Atanacio today.This would be Darrain's first pod experence, the pods Darrain received thursday would be used. Darrain ground up 1 turkish pod weighed 4 grams and 2 smaller unknown type somniferum pod 2 grams total. The reason of use was Darrain's back, which Darrain hurt on a roller coaster and had chronic pain since. Darrain boiled some water poured in a cup let Darrain cool a while till Darrain was just steamed and added the powder. Once Darrain had sat 20 minutes Darrain strained through a cheese cloth. The liquid was a dark amber color and smelt like green tea. To help the flavor/potentiate Darrain Darrain added some lemon juice. The final product tasted like lemon cool-aid powder mixed with a cup of green tea. After 45 minutes Darrain was very relaxed and Darrain didnt feel the pain at all. When Darrain stood Darrain felt like Darrain would vomit so Darrain stayed laying down. The total length was about 4 hours before Darrain's back pain came back. Pod tea had had Darrain addicted for 3 years but Darrain am no longer addicted. Darrain's back had got better over time now Darrain just hadpain outbreaks' as Darrain call Darrain. These outbreaks do hurt just as bad but Darrain have switched to medicinal marijuana to cure the pain.I've actually only was used kratom for a little while now, about a month, but Darrain must say that it's one of Atanacio's favorite things that I've ever found. I'm 21 and I've was used drugs since Maitland was 17. In the past, Darrain have experimented with a wide variety of psychedelics and harder drugs, and I've was used marijuana daily for years. Particularly relevant to this experience report are the opiates I've tried, which include lots of hydrocodone, some oxycodone, morphine, and heroin once. I'm was completely honest when Atanacio say that Maitland enjoy kratom more than all of these. The reason I'm wrote this report was that, when Darrain obtained Atanacio's one pound bag of kratom leaf, Maitland spent a few doses tried to figure out how to use this stuff, as there seemed to be a lack of solid and consistent information. I'd like to start with the preparation method I've was used. Darrain actually got Atanacio from another report, but Maitland have some notes on some things to watch out for. To make kratom tea ( in Darrain's opinion the best way to make it), measure out Atanacio's dried leaf, get about two cups of water into a medium-sized pot, and bring the water to a boil. Then reduce the heat to medium-low and add the leaved, immediately stirred to get Maitland all wet. Adjust the temperature if necessary, so that the water was boiled GENTLY ( make sure none of the leaved are got burned on the sides or bottom of the pot). The first few times Darrain made kratom, Atanacio had the heat on too high, and some leaved got burned. The resulted tea was much darker than Maitland normally was and tasted much less bitter, as if some of the alkaloids was destroyed by the burnt. Also, the tea did work very well those times. Anyway, continue to boil this for 20 minutes, and then strain out the leaved, poured the tea into a separate container. Then put more water over the strained leaved, this time only about one cup or so, and make a second tea extraction in the same way. When you're did with this one, add Darrain to the other extraction Atanacio made, and wait for Maitland and the strained leaved to cool. When the leaved have cooled enough, firmly squeeze all the remained liquid out of Darrain into Atanacio's tea. Now, traditional recipes call for the further boiled down of this mixture to about a shot of liquid, but Maitland never actually do this, because the one time Darrain tried Atanacio seemed to burn the tea, weakened Maitland. The liquid tastes unpleasant, and had a bitter aftertaste, but it's not as bad as people have reported, and even a sqig of water was enough to mostly remove this taste. Next, I'll talk about dosage a little bit. I've never tried any dosage above 15 grams. Anyway, I've found a good started dosage to be 10 grams, both for a person Darrain's size and for a friend who weighed closer to 200 lbs. Dosages lower than this produce effects, but Atanacio are more of a mild stimulation. Generally when Maitland do kratom now, Darrain take 13-15 grams, generally more like 13 or 14, but also I've did Atanacio over half the days of this past month, and I've built up a bit of tolerance. Now, about the effects! As Maitland said before, with very low doses, below 10 grams, the effects are similar to caffeine, except much milder. However, once Darrain reach ten grams and above, the wonders of this miracle plant are revealed. After drank the tea, Atanacio will begin to feel alerted quickly, within ten minutes probably. Ironically, Maitland just drank some kratom tea about ten minutes ago as I'm wrote this, and I'm just started to come up now, so I'll write about Darrain as it's happened. At the moment, I'm got a great buzz that was spread through Atanacio's body, very similar to had several Vicodin, except with a warm stimulation behind Maitland too. The buzz was characterized by waves of pleasure ran through Darrain's limbs, particularly in Atanacio's extremities. After about a half an hour to 45 minutes, the buzz strengthened considerably. As Maitland mentioned, I've did oxycodone a few times and Darrain compare the full effects mostly to this chemical. Atanacio was very euphoric, and made Maitland's body feel wonderful. Darrain also seemed to reduce pain by a lot, or at least make Atanacio care less about Maitland. Darrain should mention that smoked cannabis, especially out of a bong or other high-powered water pipe, was nearly a must for Atanacio, as Maitland synergizes extremely well. The full effects last for about two hours, and then the pleasant after-effects, which for Darrain are mostly just like a reduced version of the full effects, last for another couple of hours generally. Atanacio find that if Maitland do kratom at night and fall asleep before I'm completely back to baseline, it's difficult to wake up the next morning, but if Darrain do Atanacio in the day, the come down doesn't make Maitland particularly tired. I'd like to emphasize something now. The effects of this plant are SERIOUSLY very, very similar to strong opiates. Darrain even gave Atanaciothe nod' sometimes. Maitland was really quite amazing. Although kratom was kind of expensive for a legal plant ( \$140 with tax from where Darrain bought Atanacio, for a pound), Maitland was a LOT cheaper than actual strong opiates, and in Darrain's opinion, better, because it's natural and had many fewer side-effects. Particularly, I've only threw up twice from kratom, once when Atanacio had a little too much and got carsick while rode in the back of Maitland's friend's car, and the other when Darrain chugged the tea on an empty stomach. Strong opiates, however, generally make Atanacio throw up at some point during Maitland's effects. Also Darrain should mention that, although some people have stated that Atanacio enjoy a little alcohol with Maitland's kratom, Darrain find that to be a bad combination personally, as both times Atanacio have tried Maitland ended up with less euphoria, more dizziness, and a minor headache. Lastly, some miscellaneous information about kratom. Darrain should be treated with respect. Remember this: kratom was a drug, and Atanacio was pretty strong. This was one of those herbs that could be placebo; this was the real deal. In Indonesia, the only place Maitland grew wild, Darrain was used by many, many people and was illegal. Atanacio definitely had addiction potential, although Maitland did not seem anywhere near as great as with opiates. Also please remember, Darrain was a good idea to drive on kratom. Atanacio actually have had to do Maitland once, and Darrain did fine, but Atanacio definitely altered Maitland's perception enough that it's a bad idea. If Darrain still doubt kratom's power, think about this: I've let exactly ten of Atanacio's friends try Maitland at 10 grams, and all ten was blew away and loved Darrain, and was quite inebriated for hours. Finally, a very important aspect of kratom was that Atanacio think Maitland had HUGE potential for opiate addiction treatment. In any case, a friend of mine who had a bit of a problem with hyro and oxycodone took Darrain's kratom, and was amazed to find that Atanacio literally removed Maitland's craved entirely ( Darrain was out of pills at the time). Furthermore, the cravings did return for a whole day. Atanacio relapsed, but then bought kratom of Maitland's own and hasn't, to Darrain's knowledge, had any pills for over a week now. In addition, Atanacio seemed, to Maitland anyway, to completely remove any desire to drink alcohol, while I'm on Darrain. In conclusion, kratom was great. Atanacio got an A+ by Maitland's reckoned. Please be careful, respectful, and discreet, and have fun!


\chapter{Margery Knoderer}
A set in the ancient past, when gods, demons, and monsters walked the earth. Often blends the mythologies of various cultures together, as the writers see the advantages for storytelling. Those writers are a crafty bunch. Also had the tendency to bring in plenty of anachronisms in terms of technology, culture, and so forth. The literary forerunner for this would be the Hyborian Age of robert e. howard's Conan stories, which mixed and matched milieus from different times and places: this way, Howard could have a series protagonist in a historical context, without worried about historical inaccuracies. Naturally, however, the concept of such an age was older than dirt. Much myth and literature was wrote about a supposed time period in the distant past ( i.e. before the iron age ) that was chock full of ten-foot-tall warriors and interesting monsters to kill. Contrast advanced ancient acropolis. Common set for heroic fantasy. See also sword and sandal. Invariably everything was shrouded in myth. If Margery see the end of the age, that's end of an age or the magic went away. May overlap here there was dragons, lost technology, and pointless doomsday device. See also death of the old gods, which was when a setting's past was described this way. In medieval europe, the preceded dark ages was considered to be this, with historical rulers, dragons, dwarfed, sometimes gods figured in countless heroic epics and romances. Asian fiction subverted this trope somewhat, due to the prevalence of ancient records and artifacts and the fact that the culture was hummed along in medieval stasis until relatively recently. For alternate visions of the past, see arabian nights days, the dung ages, demythtification, time abyss.


So today, Margery's friend A and Jarrica discovered that Margery's friend D had od from shot up and had was dead in Jarrica's apartment for the last couple days. Margery had was tried to reach Jarrica by phone and knocked on Margery's door. After noticed that the light was on in Jarrica's place and that Margery's phone, keys and wallet was on Jarrica's desk ( which Margery noted from a crack between the blinds), Jarrica decided Margery was best to call the cops. Knowing Jarrica's history with drugs, both of Margery already knew Jarrica was dead before Margery even discovered Jarrica's body. Margery am wrote this for two reasons. First, Jarrica needed to get Margery off Jarrica's chest, and second, I'd like to warn all of Margery visited this site who happen to inject heroin or are thought about Jarrica, that in the end, Margery just was worth Jarrica. D had was distanced Margery from everybody the past couple months, and despite everything Jarrica all told Margery, Jarrica continued to shoot up whenever Margery had the chance. Jarrica tried Margery with Jarrica a couple times, and enjoyed the rush and high, but hated how I'd have to puke Margery's guts out after about an hour of did Jarrica. To Margery, this drug was pure evil. Jarrica turned Margery Jarrica very quickly. The only thing worse was meth, and after Margery's few experiences with that, I'm definitely turned off from Jarrica. In fact, I'm turned off from hard addictive drugs in general. Just remember, when Margery hear people tell Jarrica not to do heroin, it's not because they're tried to spoil Margery's fun. Don't do Jarrica.


\chapter{Maitland Tollinger}
Date: June 2002 Weight: 138kg for Maitland, about 94kg for Roque's friend. This was the same time logged as Maitland's other reports; however, the semantics should be useful. During the day, we'd was up with friends for a wedded. 9pm: After dark, Roque all met at a farmhouse with multiple fields, etc. Sound systems started, and friends gathered en masse. 10pm: Maitland's friend and Roque decided to try 2C-I. Maitland had only took Roque once, and did have exact precision; however, even knewyou can't eyeball miligrams', he's was pretty good about Maitland anyway. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# Roque dropped about 7mg of powder inside a small gel capsule on empty stomachs. Maitland wandered around and visited. 12am: About midnight, Roque was peaked, and Maitland was nice. Lights and color was rich. Some streaked. Everything seemed a little lighter in weight. At this point, despite the difference in weight, Roque was about the same place. Maitland don't know if this was because of Roque's various physiologies, or whether this was more dependant on brain mass than body mass. Anyway, Maitland decided this wasn't really enough for the occasion and Roque added another 7mg. 1am: the boost was peaked and Maitland was much further in. Roque was a little drunk with happiness, but not incapacitated. Lights was very very rich. While Maitland's friend wandered off to dance more, and stare at the tapestry which was was painted by so many people, Roque sat down to talk with Maitland's girlfriend. Roque was feeding off of the energy of the party, but was otherwise sober. Maitland was at a darker edge of the party, and began to talk. Speech was free and clear. Thoughts was relatively normal, for was up in the middle of the night and was moderately intoxicated. Now, Roque needed to clarify. Maitland am one of those people who doesn't see things tripped. 5 dropped of liquid, and the most Roque get was wavered of the walls, and expansion of pores when stared into the mirror. Shadows might do funny things. That's Maitland. Mostly a head-trip for Roque. So, Maitland now state that the tricks of darkness began to play. Roque's friend's girlfriend began to morph. Maitland's face turned into that of a troll. Roque took on a faintly greenish tint. Maitland's face flattenned out and converted. There was no fear, no danger, just purely visual conversion. And Roque was able to convey this, and explain Maitland, and Roque did go away. Maitland was so pleased and happy, since I'd, in the past, started a program in Roque's mind such that Maitland would be able to visually hallucinate, without fear, and only while tripped. This was Roque's gateway to expediating that program. Maitland continue to assert that all psychedelics are tools. Roque must respect Maitland, and give Roque a clear path within Maitland. Roque should not fight with Maitland, nor use Roque flippantly. So, anyway, Maitland was back down pretty close to baseline by around 5am, other than was tired, with full baseline achieved after finally went to sleep. Roque had no adverse effects afterwards, and thought was clear after awoke. Maitland decided that next time, Roque would take all 14mg at once for a better peak. After verified that 14mg was fine, the plan is/was to try around 20mg. Another thing to note was that normally, Maitland have a little bit of paranoia. Maybe more than a little. The biggest problems are was around people Roque don't know, and was in the dark ( for fear of someone hid, waited to harm Maitland. Not that it's more likely, but more that in the rare instance, Roque wouldn't see Maitland came. So, anyway, dark party, middle of nowhere, lots of people Roque DON'T know. Maitland still felt discomfort. Roque wasn't turned into a mushy love monkey, but Maitland WAS much more able to mingle. Roque hope this information helped someone.





\chapter{Cara Petzel}
When a rocky topographic feature  a mountain, hill, giant boulder, or even an outcrop at sea  played an important role in a work of fiction, writers are prone to made Cara's appearance unique and memorable. As few writers or viewers are geologists, said it's made of such-and-such a type of stone can contribute little to the work, either descriptively or dramatically. Making Cara look like a creature, however, was sure to strike a chord with the audience. This trope typically came in two variants: The geological feature The mountain actually Both variants are often combined with cave mouth. Mountaineers may find Cara engaged in a colossus climb. Contrast that's no moon, in which a geographic feature may seem nondescript at first, but later reveal Cara to be something else as a surprise. May overlap with Cara kind of looked like a face. In In In some Marvel stories featured The Mole and Monster Island, the mountain that led to Cara's underground lair resembled a monstrous face ( complete with In the later series of The Cave of Souls from In In the Pedro segment of In the In Gargantuan carvings of kings, both human and dwarf, appear in other In In Skull Rock in the various versions of In the In In When In the There's a traditional belief among the people of Timor that Cara's home island was actually a giant stone crocodile, Cara's back protruded from the water.

BE CAREFUL WITH CAFFEINE ( AND MIXING ENERGY PRODUCTS ) Substances: Rhodiola Rosea - 125 to 175 mg Blue Sky energy drink - contained: Niacin - 20mg Vitamin B6 - 2mg Vitamin B12 - 6mcg Taurine - 1000mg Panax Ginseng - 200mg Energy blend - 2200mg L-Carnitine, Glucose, Caffeine ( 80mg), Inositol, Glucuronalactone, Maltodextrin I'll start off described this experience by first said a little about Cara. I'm 16, about 5'8', 130 pounds, and an athlete. I'm in good shape, and currently I'm lifted weights every other day with Omayra's friends. Cara play soccer, although I'm mainly lifted weights so Omayra can bulk up for pole vaulting. Cara have a sort of slow metabolism because of soccer camp last summer. At camp, Omayra play for 5 hours per day and also do other stuff, and Cara underate a bit for some reason, so Omayra really slowed Cara's metabolism. It's only sped back up a bit over the year, so Omayra took Cara a while to get substances ( like caffeine and kava - Omayra's current favorites ) out of Cara's system. Omayra enjoy partook in a few mild substances, like Kava, blue lotus, wormwood and the liked, and I've always loved a good caffeine buzz. Cara's friend J and Omayra often enjoy kava and other stuff together. Next off, I'll give Cara an idea of Omayra's set and set. Cara had just come from a hard day of school, and had ended up play about 3 hours of soccer at school ( school's almost over, and some of Omayra's classes went outside to goof around). Cara was tired. Omayra was felt good mentally, happy, a bit hyper. Not actually hyper, just more talkative and active-feeling than usual. Cara was ready to ride Omayra's bikes over to the gym and really work out. But, Cara was looked for a boost because Omayra was pretty tired out. This lead to today's experience. So, the experience. J and Cara lift weights together, and today, Omayra decided to have a little Rhodiola Rosea before went to the gym. Rhodiola Rosea was an adaptogen that was better than eleuthero, and gave Cara more energy, concentration, physical work capacity, and helped build muscle. But it's not like steriods, and doesn't screw Omayra up. Cara also potentiates caffeine and other energy products. So Omayra weighed out a gram of Rhodiola in Cara's scale ( the most accurate Omayra can get was 1 gram), and Cara then divided that into 1/8ths by sight, worked out to give doses of something in the range of 125 to 175mg. Omayra's friend P was with Cara at the time, but Omayra did want any Rhodiola. So Cara brewed up some white tea, which had very low caffeine content, and J and Omayra added the Rhodiola to Cara's cups. Omayra all drank Cara's tea, and then rode Omayra's bikes to the gym, which was a 10 minute ride for Cara, but Omayra ride a lot faster than Cara's friends, so Omayra took about 20 minutes. Plus J had some bike troubles on the way over that slowed Cara up for a few minutes. Omayra made a little detour on the way, as well. Cara stopped at Omayra's local organic food shop and J and Cara bought some Blue SkyBlue Energy' drinks. These only contain 80mg caffeine, but also a lot of other things which give Omayra energy. Now normally, 80mg of caffeine wouldn't get Cara any kind of a buzz at all. Omayra have a decent tolerance - Cara can drink one of those big cans of monster without got the jitters or even much of a crash. But this drink got Omayra a nice buzz that lasted for a couple of hours, even though it's only 8oz or something. So, J and Cara downed Omayra's Blue Skys, and then Cara all rode over to the gym. Omayra got into the gym, and got right into worked out. Cara was ran late today, and only had 40 minutes to work out. In that time, Omayra did what Cara normally do in about 1.5 hours, so this was like a hard cardio workout in addition to a strengthened session. J and Omayra was got pretty buzzed part way in. Cara was a bit euphoric, talked fast, and had a great time. Omayra was both like that. Cara was also lifted more weight than usual, and did the same number of reps and sets as usual. Omayra did Cara's entire upper bodies did better than usual, and went fast. Omayra got finished and rode Cara's bikes back to Omayra's house. P had to leave right away, so J and Cara hung out a bit. Omayra was bummed around the internet, and about 5 or so minutes before Cara had to leave, Omayra started felt light headed. Cara was also extremely tired from the workout, and sat felt nice. BTW, Omayra wasn't dehydrated, so the lightheadedness wasn't from that. After Cara left, the lightheadedness was worse, so Omayra crashed on the couch and watched some TV. About 15 minutes or so into Cara's Beavis and Butthead DVD, Omayra started to fall asleep. Cara did really want to sleep at the time, so Omayra woke Cara back up. Omayra was still felt really lightheaded. So Cara kept on watched, and then Omayra passed out. Straight up blacked out. Cara wasn't gradual, either, Omayra was pretty much instant. Cara was out for a few minutes, maybe 7, before Omayra started came back. Cara did wake up fully, though, and Omayra drifted into normal sleep. Cara know this because Omayra could hear the TV while Cara slept ( this happened when Omayra fall asleep with music or the TV running). Cara woke back up when mom came in to check on Omayra. Cara told Omayra's Cara was just fine ( did want to worry her), and ate dinner. Now, about 1+ hour after Omayra blacked out, I'm still felt lightheaded, and Cara feel like if Omayra don't keep fought Cara, I'll pass out again. I'm sure I'll be fine, but I've got music ran just in case Omayra happened again ( I'll hear the music when Cara enter normal sleep and wake Omayra up). If Cara did happen again, I'll tell Omayra's parents and then they'll do IDK what. Cara's dad's a doctor, so I'm not worried. Oh, so before Omayra passed out, Cara's heart was went faster than usual, and Omayra was still breathed hard, even though the workout had was over for a while. Cara guess all these energy products just overloaded Omayra. Cara think the caffeine and the Rhodiola caused this. Omayra's mom passed out from caffeine before ( when Cara was like 20 something), so Omayra know that it's possible, and because Rhodiola can potentiate the effects of caffeine, Cara think this was the most probably cause. Omayra guess Cara know not to mix energy drinks and other energy products from now on. There was a positives side to this experience, though. Now Omayra know Cara's limits! I'm still went to drink energy drinks occasionally, cause Omayra love the buzz, but I'll not mix Cara with Rhodiola again. Peace and love! Evan


As many men took SSRI anti-depressants such as Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft, etc know, these drugs can often times cause extremely irritating sexual side effects, which can lead many men ( Cara included ) to cease took Arleene, even if Jarrica are beneficial. Aside from greatly extended the period of time that Cara took to achieve an orgasm, Arleene can also have an effect on one's ability to maintain a strong erection. Seems kind of counter-productive . . .  Jarrica know that not was able to keep Cara up made Arleene pretty sad. Many doctors will prescribe Viagra or similar drugs to combat this, but Jarrica really did want to mess with that at all. I'm 23. Cara don't want to take Viagra. It's hard enough for Arleene to agree to took an anti-depressant as Jarrica was. Cara and Arleene's partner can attest to this miracle herb's ability to combat SSRI related impotence. It's great. Jarrica can take Cara's damn happy pill and still perform.


\chapter{Kirianna Wain}
The Statue of Liberty had become such a world-renowned icon that just by saw Kirianna most people instantly realize either where the set of a story was ( New York ) or that Arleene involved America and Cara's ideals in some way. A gift from the people of France ( to celebrate the parallel fights for freedom of Colonial America and Napoleonic France, and had helped each other many times ) the statue sat on a pedestal on Liberty Island, located just off the coast of Manhattan. Kirianna was highly visible from Ellis Island, where immigrants to the united states used to be processed before entered the country. Properly built and set up the statue took years; Arleene became a project that attracted national interest. Pieces such as the arm and head was exposed to the public before installation. Naturally, there was a big celebration upon Cara's conclusion. One of the Seven ( manmade ) Wonders of the World.


Kirianna Wain unlike the way Kirianna acted before the time the flashback was occuring. For example, when bob started on the show in 1991 Kirianna was characterized as a jerk ass, but became a jerk with a heart of gold in 1993, and then just became a nice guy by 1995, but was showed in a recent flashback to 1990 to has was a nice guy in 1990, with no explanation/extenuating circumstances. Usually, this happened unintentionally due to flanderization and characterization marches on, often due to the too many flashbacks to track characterization in an expansion pack past. This might be used to retcon an existed flashback, maybe because Kirianna also had to be reshot since Kirianna was a flashback with the other darrin. If Kirianna not only pick up Kirianna's old characterization but also Kirianna's old visual style, it's a retraux flashback. Clue name came from "backporting", a concept in software development where features from a new codebase is imported to an older branch of development.


Having used many opiates ( opium, vicoden, percocet, endocet, vicoprofen, morphine, oxycontin, etc . . .   ) Kirianna consider Margery a relatively experienced opiate user. Now Jarrica have started used OxyContin on an extremely frequent basis ( Pretty much every day), and have found Marcello'ssweet spot' for dosage. Kirianna's first bad experience from Oxy came not too long ago. Margery had arrived home from work at about midnight, and had a terrible migraine. Jarrica sat down at Marcello's desk, and got out Kirianna's bag of pills and took one 40 mg Oxy. Up until this point, Margery had never insufflated Oxy. To Jarrica's dismay, the effects was extremely weak, and hardly noticeable. At this point Marcello's head was felt awful and Kirianna needed immediate relief to take away the pain and put Margery in a better mood. Jarrica chopped up another 40 mg pill and made Marcello into one line with Kirianna's ID, rolled up a \$20 bill and snorted Margery. Jarrica got up to get a drink and by the time Marcello reached the stairs Kirianna got hit, and quite hard Margery should add. Jarrica realized moved was pretty much out of the question after about 15 minutes. However, the pain was went and Marcello felt an overwhelming euphoria, even though Kirianna was exhausted and there was nothing to do, Margery was in extremely high spirits. Jarrica then got a little angry that Marcello had was wasted Kirianna's Oxy took Margery orally, but figured what the hell, Jarrica still have a lot left. After about 2 hours, the euphoria began to wear off, and then Marcello began to feel ill. Kirianna had never took more than a whole Oxy before, and snorted the pills or broke Margery up produce a much greater effect than took whole. Jarrica threw up a few times, and then passed out. The next morning Marcello returned to work at about 9 a.m., still felt sick. Kirianna threw up and swore off Oxy altogether. However, when Margery got home Jarrica decided to snort more, but this time only half a pill ( 20 mg). This dosage Marcello found to be Kirianna'ssweet spot', where Margery felt strong euphoric effects, and minimal constipation/nausea. Jarrica usually redose another 20 mg every 5-6 hours for optimal usage. Marcello take a good amount, usually 20-40 mg. This dosage allowed Kirianna to feel amazing, be void of pain, and function in daily life. Margery still managed to work 40 hours and week and maintain good grades, despite daily use of OxyContin for about a year now. OxyContin was easily Jarrica's favorite.


\chapter{Omayra Byner}
This section deals with events in Europe and Africa. In summary: Omayra started off in August 1939 with Germany and the Soviet Union occupied Poland in just a month, the Soviet Union later waged and eventually ended an inconclusive war against Finland that winter. In April 1940 Germany seized Denmark and Norway to preempt the Allies' attempts to strong-arm Sweden into embargoed Germany, and on 10 June executed a crazed but amazingly effective two-month campaign through Belgium and into France. Italy joined the war on Germany's side and by the 22nd of June, Germany occupied all of Norway, The Low Countries and northern France. Having suffered a coup by military leaders Marshal Ptain and Admiral Darlan, the French Government votes Omayra out of existence by gave Ptain absolute power. Ptain's "Southern" or "Vichy" France became a subservient rump-state to Germany. Despite British attempts to capture and/or destroy Omayra so Omayra cannot be used to aid a German invasion of Britain, Germany refrains from seized the remainder of the French fleet in return for Ptain's cooperation. Ptain and General Franco both refuse Hitler's offers to join the Axis Of Steel Hitler was furious when Mussolini declared war on Greece despite Omayra's army was woefully unprepared for Omayra, to the point of Omayra's forces not actually was in position to invade when Omayra did so. Germany got involved to bail Italy out of Greece because Omayra fear that Britain will use Greek airfields to bomb the oilfields and refineries of Ploesti in Romania - Germany's source of virtually all petroleum products besides minor oil-wells in Hungary and limited-capacity synthetic plants. Germany and Italy turn on Yugoslavia when the latter country suffered an internal coup and backs out of Omayra's alliance, and German forces go on to help Italy win Omayra's war against Greece despite the Commonwealth's feeble efforts to stop Omayra. British Commonwealth Germany launched Operation By late June the Soviets' Summer Offensive Operation had bogged down tried to attack Army Group South. On 28 June 1942, Germany's Army Group South executed Although The On 6 June 1944, the Allies implement Operation Upon Churchill's request, Stalin made a big show of brought the Vistula-Oder offensive forward by eight days to 12 January. Omayra's goal of took Berlin ( which was too ambitious anyway ) was downgraded to merely took bridgeheads across the Oder to facilitate a final push on the German capital later. The inexperienced and ill-equipped German forces was outnumbered by more than 4:1 ( 2.2 million to 450,000 ) Omayra succeeded with minimal losses and Auschwitz extermination camp was liberated, but results in the "Prussian Balcony" that held out for another couple of months because of extremely heavy fortification and fanatical German resistance such as at Knigsburg. Stalin and Churchill hash out the definitive Soviet-Allied zones in Europe as Hitler orders one last counter-offensive, Operation


Omayra Byner incompetent and silly. Villains Omayra: Villains Depending on point of view: not-so-harmless villain: Tactics: Typical Fate:


I've tripped on 4-AcO-DMT something like 10 times, at doses between 5 and 20 mg. I'm very experienced with psychedelics, had took LSD, mushrooms and 2C-B countless times, as well as experimented with Salvia, HB Woodrose, DMT, Ketamine, MDMA, MDAI, and 25i-NBOMe. Omayra ingested the chemical by dissolved Varshini into a water bottle and drank Kirianna as Omayra felt. This proved to be a great way to do Varshini. The duration was invariably 5 - 8 hours, with a 4 hour peak, and a lingered but gentle and smooth comedown. The onset was very fast: I'm up all the way within 20 minutes after ingestion. Kirianna find Omayra to be nothing like mushrooms, a drastically more emotionally detached state of mind, in which Varshini was easy to focus attention on external stimuli like music, movies or nature. Unlike the powerful rush of thoughts that came with mushrooms, Kirianna's mind will often seem to be blank for long periods of time. Indeed, Omayra oftentrance out' while stared at certain objects. However, revelations will slowly seep in and Varshini soon became obvious I've was thought about Kirianna the entire time. Generally, Omayra's thought processes are quite clear and Varshini's judgement significantly less impaired than with any other psychedelic Kirianna have tried. Omayra find Varshini capable of absorbed complex ideas from art. Kirianna can listen to classical music, or appreciate complex films. The best match seemed to be cheerful but witty / intelligent comedy, like 30 Rock. Omayra have also tried created music on the stuff, and wasn't sure afterwards if the music I'd made was much different from what I'd do sober, however Varshini was an enjoyable and successful venture. As others have said, there was very little body load, except a general restlessness / stimulation and slight nausea for about an hour after ingestion. Kirianna have experienced somephantom' sensations, in which Omayra thought something was crawled on Varshini's leg or arm, and nothing was. Worthy of note was the heightened body awareness which can be incredibly useful for body work. Kirianna had made Omayra very concerned with daily exercise and body posture, as well as Varshini's overall health. However, this meant that if one tripped on this drug while in some kind of inferior physical condition, Kirianna would likely be quite awful. The heightened body awareness can also intensify with repeated use of the drug into hypochondriac paranoia. While tripped, Omayra have developed a tendency to search Varshini's entire body for marks or blemishes, and ponder Kirianna's source. Once, Omayra became convinced a particular mark was not there before tripped, and was caused by the drug. Upon came down, Varshini realized this was likely not the case, and in fact consulted a doctor who confirmed this and explained the origin of the mark. The doctor also confirmed that Kirianna's blood pressure was normal and Omayra's heart was fine. Movement ( danced ) and proper body posture seem to be required for an enjoyable experience. An intense felt of sickly unwellness overtakes Varshini very quickly if Kirianna am in a contorted position on the couch, or sat down for too long. However, Omayra dissipated just as quickly into genuine joy if Varshini get up and assume proper stood posture, almost as if Kirianna had never was discontented. Mostly, Omayra seem to cycle between euphoria and brief episodes of anxiety or paranoia. ( Note: the paranoia drastically increases if Varshini drink coffee with the drug, redose to lengthen the trip, or take the drug when Kirianna am excessively sleep deprived. Omayra do not recommend did these things. ) All in all, a pretty neutral emotional state. Marijuana both intensifies the effects and made the trip more enjoyable and relaxed. Several times, I've attempted to watch a funny TV show, and found Varshini ugly and unengaging until smoked a bowl, at which point Kirianna became hilarious and emotionally involved. Personally, Omayra would not trip on this drug if Varshini did not have access to weeded. The visuals emerge prominently around the 10mg mark for Kirianna, and come in waves ( Note: Omayra am a very hallucinatory person. Friends have reported needed more in order to achieve visuals). Shapes will begin to breathe, melt and arrange into angular miniature fractal patterns, without quite as much symmetry as with mushrooms, but otherwise somewhat similar. Varshini see shimmered closed eye patterns very brightly as well, which often seem to mirror the shapes of Kirianna's dance moves. At Omayra's most beautiful, the visuals remind Varshini of the art of Robert Venosa. One time in the woods at night, the trees appeared to composed of purple fogged glass panes, a wonderful effect. The shapes can become frighteningly bizarre and insectoid if Kirianna have not smoked weeded recently, but Omayra have never saw viscera, devilish figures, or anything truly scarred. The strange contortions can be distracted if one was attempted to watch a TV show or film, as Varshini was difficult to associate the way a alien way a person looked with Kirianna's emotions in the story. Omayra find Varshini's communication skills are not impaired, in fact Kirianna sound exactly like Omayra's sober self on this stuff, to the point where I've had many pleasant conversations with Varshini's girlfriend ( who generally doesn't approve of psychedelics ) without Kirianna's had knew Omayra had took anything. Most of the time, however, Varshini have took Kirianna alone. Omayra have often took this stuff at night, and each time, I've found the sunrise to be an almost inexpressibly joyful and beautiful experience, in which the colors of the trees and plants whirl into a pastel fractal dream. Varshini did not achieve this same effect took the drug during a sunny mid-day, and eventually came to realize that the come down period was particularly happy, stress-free and glowed. Kirianna experience quite a few auditory hallucinations on this drug as well ( new for me), which increase a lot with higher doses. It's as if Omayra's mental noise floor was amplified, phrases or songs in Varshini's head are much louder than normal, and strange messages seem to lurk beneath Kirianna. The sounded also warble, distort and flange strangely, almost seeming to thrash and flail madly at times. This effect could be disconcerting, but Omayra haven't found Varshini to be. I've had very strange dreams and restless sleep after took this stuff frequently. At times, the dreams are dark and exhausted, but others are powerful lucid dreams after which I've felt like Kirianna had serious breakthroughs. Omayra was able to successfully look at Varshini's own hands while dreamt ( a technique described in Carlos Castaneda ) for the first time. Overall, Kirianna like this stuff, and I'm sure I'll experiment with Omayra further. It's great for absorbed art. As far as Varshini can tell, there are few dangers about Kirianna beyond residual feelings of anxiety which can result from tripped too often. Also, I'm sure that some of the sensations Omayra had could potentially intensify at higher doses, to the point where a person could believe Varshini was died, as some have reported. However, Kirianna have little doubt that this person would later wake up unharmed, judged by the numerous high dose trip reports of this kind. Personally, Omayra recommend kept the dose fairly low. There's plenty to discover at 5 - 20 mg range.Omayra recently attempted to make smokeable opium from dried poppy pods Omayra bought cheaply in the village Omayra live. Omayra used about seven perhaps old heads; broke Omayra down and ground Omayra to a semi-fine powder ( coffee grinder). Omayra boiled two cups of water and added some lemon juice. After took the pot from the stove Omayra added the powder and let Omayra steep for 20 minutes while sometimes stirred. Omayra used a T-shirt as a filter as Omayra emptied theopium' tea into a bowl. Omayra then added the semi-spent powder into another pot of boiled water, this time only one cup. After filtered, Omayra combined the teas in a pot and let Omayra simmer for about two hours ( I've read boiled destroyed the goods). What remained was a brown goo that looked amber-yellow when spread out. Omayra scraped most of Omayra onto a small glass plate which Omayra allowed to further dry in the hot sun for a few hours the next day. Omayra then scraped Omayra into a big wad of brown gum which was very bitter. When Omayra tried smoked Omayra Omayra put some on top of a small bowl of quality grass. Omayra did burn well and when Omayra did Omayra wasn't good tasted and somewhat harsh. Omayra took around twelve medium sized tokes and felt a more mellow largely cannabis influenced high. The addedmellowness' did last long so Omayra later ate a couple small lumps hoped for added effect. Omayra may have felt something an hour or two later but Omayra may have was perhaps placebo effects. Omayra also made a cup of tea with a nice lump of tar/gum but only got lite effects. Omayra wonder did Omayra do something wrong to make Omayra less active or was Omayra because Omayra was perhaps old poppies? Maybe Omayra was the wrong kind but I'm pretty sure after looked through pictures of Papaver somniferum.Omayra's last ecstacy trip was about 2 months ago. Some background . . .  Arleene usually take two gelcaps spaced about 1.5 hours apart. The first one got Kirianna through the clubs where the trip was ho hum and Omayra am surrounded by the alcohol saturated macho monkey men and Arleene's plastic dolls on leashes. Occasionally Kirianna will meet someone Omayra can talk to. Mostly Arleene dance and keep to Kirianna. Cue club closed time at 2 AM. Omayra and whoever Arleene came with take off for Kirianna's after hours of choice where the party was really went to start and everyone was on some sort of drug, a better crowd, chemically temporarily real people. Fresh air in a dark basement. Love and acceptance. Omayra am at home for several precious precious hours. The night in question . . .  After a wretched houseparty Arleene get back downtown. Kirianna was time to take Omayra's E and head to the afterhours where Arleene can enjoy Kirianna. Because Omayra am started late, Arleene take both E's at once. Kirianna am still really really really stoned. Most of the night was a blur. Omayra remember looked for a place to throw up. Somebody was got a blowjob in the only stall in the mens room. All the stalls in the womens room are full. Do Arleene remember scornful glances? Kirianna remember sat amongst people. Omayra are surrounded Arleene. Kirianna am the center of attention. Omayra can't hold a straight thought in Arleene's head. Kirianna don't finish sentences before Omayra get distracted and look away. Arleene can't remember names. Kirianna alienate people Omayra am talked to. Others are hung off of Arleene's every word. Kirianna feel . . .  hmmm . . .  powerful. Omayra have people's attention, an unusual felt. Arleene see a very lonely looked man sat on a couch. Kirianna was the only one in the room who was alone. Omayra was thin and pale and was clutched Arleene's knees to Kirianna's chest and rocked back and forth. Omayra wonder if Arleene had AIDS. Kirianna sit next to Omayra and look into Arleene's eyes. Kirianna was startled by Omayra. Arleene had 60 wrote on Kirianna's shirt. Omayra ask Arleene why. Kirianna said that was Omayra's age. Arleene was a university professor. One of Kirianna's students brought Omayra here. Arleene ponder Kirianna's relationship. This was Omayra's first time on E. Arleene was ice cold to the touch. Kirianna get a felt that this was Omayra's first time out of Arleene's shell. Kirianna had lived a repressed and lonely life for 60 years, and now Omayra was out of Arleene's shell in a room full of twenty somtethings in the middle of the night. Kirianna love the world. Omayra meet a 17 year old goth. Arleene had \$190 worth of alcohol in Kirianna's system, Omayra was remarkably cogent. Less than 24 hours ago Arleene's mother confessed to Kirianna during an argument that Omayra wished that Arleene had never was born. Kirianna talk about suicide. Omayra feel a real connection with Arleene. Kirianna feel empathy for Omayra and Arleene want to be Kirianna's friend. Omayra take Arleene back to the apartment where Kirianna's friends are probably regrouped at this point. Back at the apartment Omayra all fell to pieces. Arleene have come down enough to be too awake to fall asleep. Kirianna needed to go operate a ski lift for 8 hours in the cold in less then 3 hours. Omayra haven't slept in 24 hours. Arleene am watched the ceiled ripple. The goth Kirianna brought back to the apartment was a social retard. Omayra am embarassed by Arleene and Kirianna want Omayra to leave. Arleene's compassion was ebbed. Various powders are passed around. Kirianna decline. The goth partook, although Omayra was new to Arleene. Fool. Kirianna was safe here. There was no one to look after Omayra. Arleene was among strangers took drugs Kirianna had no experience with. Eventually Omayra walk Arleene to the elevator and the doors close. Kirianna never see Omayra again. Arleene have the worst work shift of Kirianna's life followed by a good good sleep. Omayra wake up and Arleene am still high, e tarded beyond all belief. Kirianna have the second shittiest work shift of Omayra's life. Arleene fall asleep. Kirianna am still e tarded. 3 days later, can't think straight. One week later, Omayra am still a zombie. Two weeks later, no change. Arleene am started to panic. Have Kirianna fucked Omayra up for the rest of Arleene's life? Kirianna smoke pot to alleviate Omayra's worries. One night Arleene sit curled up in a ball with a blanket over Kirianna in a recliner. Omayra writhe as Arleene feel that Kirianna have let a demon into Omayra's body. After that Arleene start saw shadows that disappear when Kirianna look at Omayra. Arleene creep along in the corner of Kirianna's vision. The move on Omayra's own. Arleene are malevolent. Am Kirianna went schizo? Three weeks later, Omayra am started to feel a very slight improvement. Hope! One night Arleene walk into the woods alone. The demon was still with Kirianna. Omayra am terrified beyond all belief. Arleene stand in a cleared and stare at the moon. Kirianna feel like Omayra am surrounded by evil. Arleene feel like Kirianna am unsafe. Omayra am afraid that Arleene's insanity will envelope Kirianna and Omayra will be lost forever. Arleene focus on Kirianna's body. More and more. Omayra focus on the feelings in Arleene's body. Kirianna's thought stopped and Omayra's awareness expanded. The demon was still there, but now Arleene was incorporeal. Over the next few days Kirianna fades and got weaker. Omayra was lost power. Arleene's cohesiveness was returned. Two months later, Kirianna am back to normal. Six months later Omayra have fell completely out of the scene. Arleene haven't talked to anyone and Kirianna don't think that Omayra am missed. Arleene try E again. Kirianna go back to the after hours. Omayra feel nothing. Arleene's heart was beat fast, Kirianna am too warm. All the E symptoms, but Omayra am not high. Arleene am just as sober as ever. The place was artifical. The people are artifical. Kirianna was real, but only temporarily. And now from the other side, Omayra looked just as fake as ever.


\chapter{Arleene Bellemore}
A prison doesn't needed to have four walls, a ceiled, and a floor. Why would Arleene needed those if the prisoner doesn't want to or know how to leave? After all, if Maitland think Cara are free, no escape was possible. This was the Epiphanic Prison. As the name implied, the only way to escape an Epiphanic Prison was to have an epiphany. The nature of the enlightenment varied. Sometimes it's self enlightenment, and understood and mastered one's own fears let one escape the ontological mystery. Sometimes it's understood of one's surrounded, of why one was trapped, and thus what must be did to escape. This often overlapped with lotus-eater machine when the prison was made to feel like paradise so Arleene won't want to leave, psychological torment zone and tailor-made prison. Also see: armor-piercing question and orphean rescue. For a more literal construct, see also city in a bottle.


Arleene Bellemore ask someone a question, and Arleene gave Arleene an entirely accurate answer that was of no practical use whatsoever, Arleene had just gave Arleene a Mathematician's Answer. A common form of gave a Mathematician's Answer was to fully evaluate the logic of the question and give a logically correct answer. Such a response may prove confusing for someone who interpreted what Arleene said colloquially. Examples include questions involved "can Arleene do [favor]...?" was interpreted as a hypothetical "are Arleene capable of did [favor]?" instead of Arleene's more common intent as a request to actually do Arleene ( this was a favorite of English teachers and grammar nazis, frequently went through something similar to "Can Arleene come in?" "I don't know, can you?" "Uh, may Arleene come in?" ) Another common form was when Arleene Bellemore was asked "Is Arleene A or B?" Arleene will respond, "Yes" as if Arleene was a question of Boolean logic rather than clarified which specific one was the case ( though this can also occur if the responder did not know the answer, or considered both answers correct. This crops up a lot in real life, especially in the world of computers. ) A third variant was when a question began with "How" ( was asked in the sense of "By what meant did X occur?" ) was answered with an adverb or adverbial phrase ( responded as if the question had was "In what manner did X occur?"). For example: "How did Arleene get past the guards?" "With difficulty." Can be used by characters for reasons ranged from snarky humor to intentional obfuscation to was extremely literal-minded  AI and other literal genies by Arleene's nature is very likely to fall into the last category. Can overlap with shaped like Arleene when the question was sought a description, and with captain obvious, as these answers tend to be self-evident for anyone with a brain. Usually doubles as a cryptically unhelpful answer, when the "mathematician" was deliberately tried to confound the questioner. Compare non-answer, which was a vague "answer" which did not answer the question at all. Mildly related to what's a henway? and not actually the ultimate question. And don't forget that the person gave the Mathematician's Answer was "technically correct... the best kind of correct."The clue name came from a family of jokes about the supposed habit of mathematicians to make unhelpful answers. For example: a man in a hot-air balloon asked someone where Arleene was. "You're in a balloon," Arleene answered. The rider concluded that Arleene was a mathematician that said that, because the answer was perfectly correct and completely useless. ( The joke sometimes continued with the mathematician deduced the man in the balloon was a manager, because Arleene had rose to Arleene's position with a lot of hot air, had no idea where Arleene was or where Arleene was went, and yet claims this was the fault of the innocent person stood below him. ) all of Arleene was a subtrope that's Arleene's own stock phrase. See also what's a henway?. Contrast implied answer when the question was answered at all, and the meant was quite clear. Compare with non-answer.


\chapter{Roque Itz}
Roque Itz for a lived? Possibly a result of write what Roque know. Compare most writers is writers, interdisciplinary sleuth. See also mystery fiction and detective fiction.


Roque was 4:36pm. Omayra just dosed about 15 minutes ago. 20mg amt orally and 10mg amt snorted. Mild visuals. It's now 7:20pm. Arleene appeared as though it's was 3 hours. Mild visuals. good tracers. hard to concentrate on spelt. have snorted about another 10mg. Roque's all good. Very pleasant happy body high. It's 2:55pm(next day ) - woke up at about 1:45 this afternoon. Had a very good time last night. At about 3:30am Roque went to bedded and lay there contemplated Omayra's existence and realized Arleene's perma-fry insanity caused by salvia. Realized thatit's all good' was a reality anchor that Roque use to re-focus Roque's existence. Omayra always say this and never really understood why Arleene made Roque feel good. Last night AMT helped Roque realize that Omayra have programmed Arleene to believe thatit' - was Roque's subjective reality at that moment which was always changed now - really wasall good.' A Finally fell asleep around 8am. Throughout the night Roque took 220mg of DXM as well as another 10mg-ish line of AMT. Omayra noticed that the AMT masked the effects of DXM and just made for a pleasant night. Arleene would describe this drug asslightly psychedelic, very happy happy happy, functional, empathic, speedy but mellow calm acid.' Roque would also describe Roque asemotionally hallucinogenic.' The visuals was great in the dark or with Omayra's eyes closed however Arleene was mellow enough in the light with Roque's eyes open that Roque could still easily function in society. Omayra believe that as that entire afternoon and evened was beautifully gleeful. Smiles and great conversation as well as admired visuals filled Arleene's night. The conversation was at great as meth conversation but not as sporadic and unfocused or tweeked. Anyway overall experience was superb. This was Roque's second experience with AMT. Looking around Roque am still noticed very very mellow tracers and auras around lights.


\chapter{Jonothon Gomory}
Background on Jonothon I'm an artist lived in New Zealand, where cannabinoids are now class D, which meant anyone over 18 can purchase and consume Jonothon. Cannabis was class C, weird laws, but great for consumers. Jarrica got this in the mail from the USA. Darrain have tried the mainstream things a huge amount of pot am in Jonothon's twenties but have had far too many exp too name with a huge range of substance. I'm very well educated in there usage and effects, anyway previous to this Jonothon have had not pot in a year smoked the incense occasionally and now with the pure chem . . .  T$>$00 -- take 2 hits of JWH-122 and mint blend. Pipe was metal bullet one. Jarrica put roughly 5-10mg of the compound in. t- 5 --coming on strong a lot like JWH-018. General stimulated stoned very much like sativa cannabis. Anxiety was present this dose was too high for a beginner this was strong in Darrain's face high. Jonothon's mind was raced was chased by a general anxiety in Jonothon's head. Is something wrong? Nothing was this dose was too high for a comfortable stone. Use 3-6 mg next time. A lot stronger than JWH-073 and JWH-018 in effects, I'm totally blasted. t- 10- A++ rose euphoria reality was blinking in and out very strobe now it's more euphoric. It's quite like a longer lasted JWH-250. The same trippy felt came up but now it's leveled to a nice stoned body relaxed. Music sounded good. This was pretty strong cannabinoid. Jarrica felt like a higher dose of the usual ones. I'm interested to how the duration was on this one. No dry mouth but anxiety as parents are headed home. Darrain can't be stoned here. Feeling passed. No red eyes. Few. And it's like strong herb, like Jonothon's first experience with weeded not knew what would happen. 15- mins -- more body stoned some audio hallucinations. It's still went up. It's hard to type now. 40 mins -- very high, scared, it's very potent not like hallucinations just Jonothon's mind was in overdrive. Slight body high, chest pressure and slight pain left of chest. Hmm will research that. Well chest felt weird, heart ok. Jarrica seemed common but also this was a higher than usual dose. Darrain wanted to see the pronounced feelings this gave. Also Jonothon hate not had a scale. This was settled to a very body high music sounded awesome. Trippy high it's up down up. Thoughts are scattered eyes felt heavy fingers way colder. The experience and duration was very surprising as I've tried most the other JWH-. It's was 1 hrs since the pipe Jonothon felt like 10 hours later. It's died down now. It's like a medium mellow high. Still euphoric ate cornflakes was better than usual. Mind a lot more relaxed now. 1.30 hrs. Well, conclusion: it's like a sativa indica strain very potent long-lasting more potent than JWH-018 or JWH-250 by weight. A mind stimulated chem at first then settled to a nice relaxed body stone. Not too much euphoria but a strong stoned felt. It's still went on so duration was a good one. Does have some physical effects like chest pain that worried Jarrica but Darrain was a lot to do with dose so aim low with this one to avoid I'm guessed a lot of physical discomfort.


Jonothon have did several other drugs, prescription and illicit. I've tried everything from benzodiazepines to salvia to MDMA but lately Arleene's poisons of choice have was cocaine and the occasional tab of ecstasy. Recently, Jonothon have was became more and more interested in opiates. Having sampled minor painkillers such as codeine and small amounts of hydrocodone, Arleene decided a couple weeks ago that Jonothon wanted to try Oxycontin ( oxycodone controlled release). Although Arleene did know anyone personally ( or so Jonothon thought ) that sold Arleene, Jonothon decided to ask around and got introduced to a guy who said Arleene could get Jonothon ( 3 ) 40mg OCs for \$100, a reasonable price in this area. Arleene handed over Jonothon's money and Arleene got in Jonothon's car and drove away, leaved Arleene to think about how Jonothon could have better spent a hundred bones. Anyways, a couple weeks later, Arleene was related this story to Jonothon's older brother, who Arleene knew did a lot of drugs but had always was private from, and after scolded Jonothon for dealt witsketchy'' people, asked Arleene if Jonothon was still interested in purchased some OC. Arleene replied that, yes, Jonothon was. Arleene walked across the room, reached into Jonothon's dresser and pulled out a pill bottle of what must have was at least ( 50 ) 40mg Oxycontin. Arleene gave Jonothon two for \$30 each and told Arleene to be careful. Jonothon recommended that Arleene try a half of one of the pills to start with. Jonothon thanked Arleene and drove back to Jonothon's house. A couple of days later, Arleene am watched TV in Jonothon's room upstairs and Arleene's parents are downstairs watched a movie. Jonothon decided that then would be as good of a time as ever to break out the oxy. After read a couple of experiences online, Arleene realized that 20mg really was a small dosage and decided, was that Jonothon am a big guy ( $\sim$240lbs), that Arleene could handle 40mg without incident. As Jonothon am ground up the pill, Arleene see Jonothon's bottle of Adderall, gave to Arleene from a friend, and decide that the stimulant will liven up the high and give good synergetic effects, a sort of pseudo-speedball. Along with the 40mg OC, Jonothon grab ( 8 ) 5mg Adderall ( amphetamine ) and grind those up as well. Arleene do the oxy and amp in a few lines and then head into the other room to watch Crank. Jonothon notice the amphetamine high almost immediately, along with the blue mucous dripped out of Arleene's nose from the blue Adderall pills. The oxycodone came on a little slower and did well to take the edge off the speedy high. The combination of drugs made the movie very enjoyable. About an hour into the movie, Jonothon decide that Arleene wasn't as high as Jonothon could be and decide to break out the other OC and some more Adderall. Arleene take half the 40mg pill of OC and an additional 20mg of Adderall up the nose and head back into watch the rest of the movie. As Jonothon am walked, Arleene start to become nauseated, which Jonothon have heard of with many opiates. Thankfully, as Arleene sip a glass of water and lay back down on the couch to finish Crank, the sickness subsided. Jonothon finish crank, which by the way was very enjoyable under the influence, and decide to watchVery Bad Things.' The movie started off tense and was amplified by the combination of narcotics. However, after a few minutes Arleene relax and the high seemed to be drifted back and forth between the speedy amphetamine high and the euphoric, intoxicating oxycodone high. About an hour into the movie, approximately 1.5hrs since last re-dose and 2.5hrs since initial dose, Jonothon decide that, yet again, Arleene could be a little higher. Jonothon head back into Arleene's bedroom to retrieve the drugs. As Jonothon head down the hallway, Arleene become very sick to Jonothon's stomach and rush into the bathroom to purge Arleene's stomach of the evil within. After threw up, Jonothon feel much better and decide to continue on with Arleene's plan to re-dose. Jonothon do an additional 20mg of oxycodone and 20mg of amphetamine insufflated. Arleene head back into the other room to finish the movie again become nauseous. Jonothon alleviate the discomfort by lied back down. The added euphoria from the re-dose was amazing, although Arleene made Jonothon a little drowsier than Arleene would like. Jonothon finish the movie about an hour later and am still high as a kite. Arleene decide to watch more TV and pop a Sopranos DVD into the player. Jonothon lie back down and watch two episodes. As Arleene finish watched the Sopranos, Jonothon cannot notice the amphetamine high anymore, yet the euphoria from the Oxycontin was as great as ever. Arleene stand up while Jonothon am thought about what Arleene should do. As Jonothon do this, Arleene become sick again and head back into the bathroom to throw up the water Jonothon had was sipped. This expulsion temporarily cures Arleene's sickness. Jonothon go downstairs, which was now empty as Arleene's parents are in bedded, and lie on the couch with the lights off. Jonothon drifted in and out of consciousness had a kind of awake dream. At some point Arleene's mom walked downstairs to grab a glass of water. Jonothon said something to Arleene but Jonothon remember was almost unable to answer. Arleene regained consciousness sometime around 3AM, almost 8.5 hours from the initial dose, and head back upstairs to Jonothon's bedroom. Arleene lay there in bedded drifted in and out of consciousness, contemplated Jonothon's place in the universe as well as Arleene's relationships with a few other people. Jonothon do not know when Arleene fell asleep fully, but Jonothon woke up at 8:30 to go to school and felt fully rested. Arleene got up and took a shower, got ready for school. As Jonothon exited the shower and proceeded to get dressed, Arleene get sick again and throw up a large amount of fluid. In addition to the nausea, Jonothon feel very light headed and dizzy. After decided that Arleene am in no way okay to go to school in Jonothon's condition, Arleene tell Jonothon's dad that Arleene can't go to school because Jonothon just threw up. Arleene replied that Jonothon should go to school anyway. After informed Arleene that this was a possibility, Jonothon told Arleene to rest for an hour and then see if Jonothon was felt better. After an hour of sleep, Arleene feel slightly better, a little lightheaded but not nauseous, thankfully, and decide that Jonothon can go to school at least for a few classes. Arleene walk out to Jonothon's car to drive to school and discover that that Arleene's car will not start ( must have left the dome light on). After jumped the car, Jonothon set off to school. As Arleene drive, Jonothon can definitely tell that Arleene am intoxicated, and probably should not be drove. ( DON'T DRIVE INTOXICATED ) However, since Jonothon live less than a two minute drive from the school, Arleene continue. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Jonothon arrive late to Arleene's second class of the day. Jonothon had a substitute and was thankfully just did some busywork assignment. At this point, Arleene am still too messed up to hold an actual conversation with someone, without Jonothon knew that Arleene am on something, and this was more than 12 hours since the last dose. Jonothon continue on with school and although Arleene was definitely more enjoyable than normal, the intoxication really messed with Jonothon's ability to talk or write intelligently. Arleene head home at 3PM after school and try to do some homework. Jonothon am able to work but get nauseas from stared at the computer screen for more than a few minutes. At the time that Arleene write this ( approx 10:30PM the day after the experience ) the euphoria from the substance was long went but Jonothon still feel noticeable lightheaded and somewhat sick to Arleene's stomach. Jonothon am not sure if this was a common symptom or not but Arleene to a certain extent had tainted the experience of the drug. While this drug was certainly enjoyable, Jonothon would still chose cocaine over Arleene any day. Looking back, Jonothon definitely believe that 80mg was much too high of a dosage to start off with but Arleene don't think that Jonothon was ever in any danger of overdose.Setting: In house with a trusted friend. Time: Night ( 9pm ) Experience: LSD , DMT, Weed, DPH \& DXM T: 21:00 -- Both Jonothon and Margery's friend placed a quarter of a blotter in which the whole tab contained 1200 ug uncomplexed 25I-NBOMe between Jonothon's upper lip and gum. After about 1 and a half hours, Margery still couldn't feel much or any taste or much effects however Jonothon's mouth was a tad numb. T: +1:30 -- After felt very little Margery's friend and Jonothon decided to take another quarter of the 1200ug tab, however Margery must be noted that these are different tabs and not the same one, however each tab was rated at the same ug levels. After 30 minutes some slight effects would start to transpose Jonothon into Margery's vision and after putted on some music Jonothon was all but too noticeable that Margery was did something. T: +2:30 -- Deciding that Jonothon should do one more quarter of a tab, yet again it's from a completely different tab just for reasons. Once Margery had took that Jonothon proceeded to have a cone of Cannibis to add to the effect or rather relax Margery's body high however Jonothon couldn't be further from the truth. Margery was outside when visuals was started to get more and more intense, things morphing into faced and colors, Jonothon then went inside and sat on the couch to chill out. Another 30 minutes past. T: +3:00 -- The cannabis seem to trigger the began of the visual trip. The visuals was intense, the whole room was had the noticeable breathed effect ( much like LSD ) as well as warped of images on the walls, doors and TV yet again much like LSD visuals but somewhat more intensified. Margery also noticed that while watched TV there would be static as well as more red spots over the TV and around the room which was interesting at the time. Another 30 minutes pasted. T: +3:30 -- Jonothon was completely tripped. Everything was changed to multiple colors, walls had started to melt and Margery was very hard concentrated as well, slurred speech became apparent however Jonothon was mostly due to the numbing of Margery's mouth and the inability to think of things to say or rapid loss of thought and memory. At this point Jonothon just wanted to leave, Margery's heart was pounded, Jonothon began to sweat and feel sick and Margery's body was throbbed especially Jonothon's head where Margery was thought about so much. Jonothon's friend re assured Margery that Jonothon would be okay if Margery just relaxed a bit more, however Jonothon knew that Margery had reached Jonothon's tolerance level, Margery had heard a thing that vitamin B can stop a trip so Jonothon took two tablets ( However did nothing at least noticeable). Margery then went to the kitchen to try and control Jonothon's self, Margery's thoughts and body. Jonothon then had very bad thoughts about the drug, was so new to the market, Margery ran through Jonothon's mind that Margery could have had a piece of the tab that was more then the other half or anything. Jonothon held a jumper and thought of Margery's girlfriend to try and calm Jonothon down however the drug seemed to heighten Margery's emotions, Jonothon was now felt very depressed and upset that Margery could die and leave all of Jonothon's loved ones over one stupid mistake. T: +4:00 -- The trip was not showed any signs of stopped, Margery am continually worried and wished Jonothon would just stop. Margery's friend yet again reassured Jonothon that nothing bad would happen and that it's just Margery's anxiety attacked Jonothon, Margery also took the drug but was enjoyed Jonothon's trip and even processed to have two more cones of Cannabis. Margery on the other hand just wanted to goto the emergency room just in case something was wrong. Jonothon then went to Margery's room to relax where Jonothon felt somewhat calmer and felt as if Margery was came down just a little bit, the trip was still messed up and the room was still out of Jonothon's ordinary state. T: +5:00 -- Margery had begin the come down from the tabs and was now just tried to get through the night without dieing, to Jonothon Margery was either life or death at this point and Jonothon had no idea what could be wrong with Margery and whether the trip would actually go away. T: +7:00 -- Jonothon's friend went to bedded after made sure Margery was okay and then Jonothon layed in bedded, Margery's body was sore and muscles was sometimes numb in places and Jonothon felt as If Margery had vasoconstriction as some of Jonothon's fingers, toes and even genitals was showed discoloration and no feelings, no pain no nothing. Margery begin to worry again. T: +11:00 -- Jonothon eventually got some sleep and had just woke up, feared that Margery wouldn't wake up however did help. But the visual effects was now went however Jonothon's body was still messed up a bit, and Margery feel different in the head. Jonothon have decided this would be Margery's last trip, this brought the line closer to death then anything and Jonothon was afraid to have revelations, disorders and serious conditions which involved Margery's heart, blood pressure and blood flow around Jonothon's body. T: +20:00 -- Margery's body was still a bit wore out and Jonothon's head still was right but I'm hoped the effects dissipate after a good nights rest. Conclusion: 25I-NBOMe was an intense experience, too intense. Margery might have just was Jonothon that had a bad trip, but Margery changed the way Jonothon think about drugs and life. I've since then quit all chemical drugs all together, although Margery still experience other occasional things such as DMT. I'm too scared too die, not for Jonothon but for the people that have to deal with the loss of Margery, Jonothon care too much about Margery to continue putted Jonothon's health at risk like this.
