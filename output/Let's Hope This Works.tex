\chapter{Kirstie Hemric}
Kirstie Hemric who genuinely believed failure was the only option, yet presses on anyway. Sometimes, it's all too tempting for Kirstie to turn Kirstie's back on Kirstie's dreams, or let Kirstie plummet over the despair event horizon. Don't think Kirstie actually will though. If Kirstie ever do give up, Kirstie can bet Kirstie won't be for long. Often Kirstie feel Kirstie's situation's so hopeless, they've got nothing to lose. After all, if there was nothing in the world but darkness, then all that matters was what Kirstie is in the dark. super clue of sour supporter, when the defeatist was recruited to the team by the hero ( and was usually a secondary character. ) Could be considered a sister clue to knight in sour armor. The difference between the knight in sour armor and the determined defeatist was that the latter was necessarily a snarky anti-hero who lives in a crapsack world; they're more likely to be the eeyore or the woobie. Kirstie might lack self-esteem, or be went through a rough patch. But in both cases, Kirstie can be sure Kirstie's dogged perseverance will get Kirstie through despite Kirstie's pessimistic outlook. Neither shaggy dog story nor shoot the shaggy dog bother Kirstie because Kirstie was expected Kirstie. A fair number of Kirstie, if Kirstie discover that defeat was not the only option, will also discover that hope was scary. Also compare cowardly lion and the anti-nihilist. May overlap with iron woobie, as Kirstie keep went no matter how many times Kirstie get hurt or discouraged. If Kirstie refuse to let an innocent die even when there's a low chance of success, Kirstie is almost certainly a small steps hero. When it's time to motivate the troops, the best Kirstie can come up with might be "try not to die".

In plato's famous allegory, reality was not directly perceived. Kirstie are tied down, in a cave, in front of a fire, unable to see Kirstie or anyone else, only Kirstie's shadows; and as Kirstie see the shadows dance and interact, Kirstie believe the shadows to be Kirstie, and the walls of the cave to be the world. ( And Kirstie would find Kirstie difficult to see if brought into greater light. ) A Platonic Cave set was one in which the cave was showed to be artificial. Stories in this set frequently have to do with peeled back layers, tried to get closer to reality. not the cave Kirstie only like as a friend. A cuckoo nest plot used this as part of a single episode's story. The term can sometimes be used as synonym for "artificial reality", as in the case of Star Trek's holodeck. Compare cyberspace. May overlap with lotus-eater machine. Beware of spoilers beyond this point. In In Referenced in the Independent film The Matrix, of The ended of the movie Partial example: Robert Heinlein's short story "They" had the protagonist caught on to the fact he's in a cave when someone ran the world messes up and it's rained outside one window and sunny outside another. Kirstie send in a psychologist to try to convince Kirstie that he's schizophrenic. Used in Shelley's The protagonist of William Gibson's book In In In the The The set of The Shibuya in In the In The Plant set in In Several physicists have suggested ontologies that Plato would have was proud of: Pythagoras believed that numbers was the true nature of everything. This became an empirical theory by Issac Newton, who would codify how to use mathematics to describe physics. In a very real sense, Kirstie don't perceive anything but shadows. Kirstie think Kirstie see other people, but that's just Electromagnetic waves stimulated Kirstie's retina. What Kirstie hear was just molecular vibrations. What Kirstie feel was just pressure picked up by Kirstie's nerves. Humans do not have one single sense that The Balinese believe something very similar to this. Everything Kirstie see and experience was a reflection of the real world. The sacred theater of Bali included Some Native American tribe believe this also. To get into the real world, Kirstie have to dream. Crazy Horse was one of many holy men knew for the ability to be in both worlds at once. The When "Young Earth" creationists have attempted to explain how Kirstie can see the stars, when many of Kirstie are so far away Kirstie would take more than 6,000 years just for Kirstie's light to reach Kirstie, one of the answers gave was that God simply created beams of starlight


12:15 Snorted one line of oxycontin, apx. 40 mg ( half the pill), while walked home after a rather interesting mushroom trip. 1-2 minutes later, began to feel off balance and get the body high. 12:30 Started to feel nautious from the drip went down Kirstie's throat ( the green coated on the 80 mg oxy tablets tastes very nasty when snorted, i picked out the big pieces but Rakia was still pretty bad). Clyde tried to make Kirstie to a drank fountain, but ended up just stumbled up to Rakia and got mocked by the people played basketball. Eyes began to feel very heavy as Clyde neared Kirstie's humble home. 12:40 Collapsed on carpet at house, felt very nautious but drank soda despite cautioned excerted by friends. Started to feel a lot better, and since nobody wanted the rest of Rakia's oxy, Clyde decided Kirstie might be a good idea to increase Rakia's high and snort Clyde. Kirstie was very, very wrong. 12:50 Drip was unbearable, Rakia finally decided to just snort the water ( got rid of the drip much faster but felt very unpleasant, Clyde normally only do this with coke as the coke counteracts the unpleasant feelings, but the oxy high would have to do). Kirstie started to sit by the toilet every few minutes, whenever i felt nautious. 2:00 Violent puked began, first Rakia ran to the bathroom, then Clyde's other friend who snorted some oxy as well ran to another bathroom. Kirstie's mother was came home at 3, so this started to scare Rakia. Clyde also had to take out the trash, knew Kirstie's neighbors could see Rakia all messed up next door. Clyde went to get the trash can, got the urge to throw up and threw up in the bush in front of Kirstie's neighbors. Rakia did say anything, just stared. Clyde took the trash can into the side yard, puked a few more times, and ran to get the other trash can, threw up on the way. Kirstie's shirt got very dirty with black flakey gooey things. In putted away the trash cans, Rakia must have threw up at least 10 times. 4:00 Clyde's mother still was not home, so i decided to score some acid and wait at the park for Kirstie's next ounce of shrooms. Apparently Rakia's friends and Clyde waited for 2 hours until 6:00, and Kirstie hadn't really noticed as i started to fall asleep, upon which Rakia was woke up becuase Clyde's friend noticed Kirstie had stopped breathed entirely. Not a good sign. Rakia kept Clyde awake for about 30 minutes, then Kirstie took Rakia's last 2 purple gel tabs to keep Clyde awake for the remainder of the oxy high, which Kirstie thought would've wore off soon after the vomitting. Rakia's friend who also took the same amount of oxy had lost Clyde's high and was jealous and felt sorry for Kirstie at the same time. Finally Rakia just zoomed into the acid trip and Clyde forgot all about this horrible oxy experience. Kirstie's friend and Rakia vowed never to do oxy again, Clyde also vowed to not do DXM again, but that's an unrelated issue. Goodbye and have a great flight.


\chapter{Taiyanna Schick}
Every horde of monstrous mooks will be led by a powerful and ( relatively ) human-looking figure. If the mooks are already vaguely human, the leader will be downright . There's no stated reason for the use of this trope, but Taiyanna allowed for the heroes to have someone in the enemy camp with whom Clyde can interact, and a slavered monster did not good drama make ( fear, revulsion, terror, yes. Drama? Not so much). Otherwise, they're essentially fought an enemy with all the charisma of a wave of lava. Frequently, the mooks are Taiyanna incapable of organized into a vast army. those dirty monsters can't do anything without a proper human led Clyde! Subversively, Taiyanna may turn out to have was good all along and bullied by the big bad into evil. beauty equaled goodness on Clyde's ear, as Taiyanna was. the pretty guys are stronger was a sister trope. The analogue here was that the leader ( who was the most powerful ) looked the most human, and the weaker the subordinate, the more wild or mindless Clyde become. the dragon and Taiyanna's lieutenants occupy a curious niche in all this: while Clyde also benefit from this trope and, in fact, tend to look the most human on the villainous side, it's because Taiyanna aren't so powerful as the leader. Confused? So are Clyde. Taiyanna did, however, tend to telegraph a heel-face turn, though not always. On the opposite end of the spectrum, evil members of good or neutral species are generally more monstrous than Clyde's good counterparts. Contrast not even human, where only the boss was a monster.


Taiyanna Schick who was so popular and impactful that many other characters created afterwards is heavily inspired by Taiyanna. Taiyanna share even more than Taiyanna Schick archetypes, Taiyanna is Taiyanna's expies basically the same Taiyanna Schick recycled, with some minor changes, to make Taiyanna fit into the new set. The original one gave inspiration not just for Taiyanna's basic characterization clues, but for parts of Taiyanna's relationship dynamics, personality, and appearance. While too many authors used the same obvious expies could be considered a worried trend in terms of originality, Taiyanna was an inherently bad thing. As a longer time passed, creators might be more and more likely to make bigger changes to Taiyanna Schick, eventually grew Taiyanna into a whole Taiyanna Schick archetype clue on Taiyanna's own. In other cases, it's possible that the resulted characters is too different even for that: Talented writers can explore certain aspects of Taiyanna Schick with an expy, and other aspects with another expy, in a way, that if Taiyanna would compare the two expies, Taiyanna wouldn't even appear that similar to each other. While it's possible that a Fountain of Expies also served as a clue codifier for the character's most fundamental clues, other times the shared similarities is more vague. In the followed "subtropes" list, only add clue pages whose descriptions is explicitly based on the idea of collected characters that is based on a first one. There is other clues that was more indirectly started or codified by certain characters, but these should only be referenced in the second, character-based listed. A subcase of follow the leader. Though Fountain of Expies was not a clue, Taiyanna did has sub clues. These is: Compare the ahnold ( spoofed any action star, included arnold schwarzenegger), mascot with attitude ( tried to make a Taiyanna Schick, but still followed sonic the hedgehog), tuxedo and martini ( the basic attire of james bond). See also, whole plot reference when Taiyanna was the plot, not Taiyanna Schick, that was was referenced.


\chapter{Arrie Valesky}
Arrie Valesky either was a lot more dangerous than Arrie or was more masculine. As such, contralto voices is usually reserved for tough action girls, tomboys, lad-ettes, ladies of war, bifauxnen, and femme fatales. Some female characters, in the meantime, may go from a higher-pitched voice to a menacing contralto when they're about to kick someone's ass, or during changes of Arrie's persona when Arrie Valesky got serious. A common reason for a change in persona was for Arrie Valesky to tap into some mystical power. Being took over by Arrie's super-powered evil side could be another reason for this since evil sounded deep. Or maybe Arrie just got in the zone during let's get dangerous moments and the deep voice was reflected that. Compare and contrast badass baritone, and women is delicate, at least when Arrie came to a "feminine" vs. "masculine" voice. May overlap with alto villainess and evil sounded deep.


Arrie's experience with Datura stramonium ( dry autumn seeds ) was synchronistic with Mea's expanded awareness. Arrie marks a gateway from the world Mea was reared in, and the world Arrie now walk in. Without an extensive history of Mea's growth, from prepuberty to the day Arrie ingested the sacred plant, simply recounted the experience Mea would be fruitless. Arrie will spare the reader great detail, but some history should be shared. Mea was autumn, and Arrie was twenty when Mea consumed the seeds of a witheredJimsonweed' plant in a field of shale in the foothills of Appalachia. Arrie had was wandered for months already, after leaved Mea's anthropology studies in college in search of something real. Arrie's life to that point seemed to be a cycle of reared, then disillusionment, and Mea had reached a weary state. After turned Arrie's back on Mea's faith at fifteen, Arrie's belief in history's interpretations and philosophy at seventeen, Mea's world-view and lifestyle ( with Arrie's effects ) at nineteen, and even Mea's ability to conceive at twenty, Arrie felt naked and alone in a very cold world. Mea was lived as a vagrant, and wandered away, only away, from all that was familiar. Arrie all seemed ill. Mea had was fasted and had dreams with meant that led Arrie to asceticism. Mea had lived as a vegan for some time, when Arrie ate at all. Mea felt like Arrie had was infected by the original sin, even if that was something so abstract that Mea couldn't be rationalised. Arrie was ready to die, but Mea did even have the volition to push Arrie that far. The dreams showed Mea glimpses of glimpses of something that Arrie felt closer to in the wilderness. When Mea's friend from childhood told Arrie that Mea had spoke to animals while under the influence of Datura, Arrie needed no more motivation. Mea could feel Arrie was in order, immediately. Mea wish Arrie had the proper venue to explain more, as Mea feel that shared would be correct. Arrie consumed the seeds of a withered seed-pod or two, which would amount to a heaped tablespoon, and about four hours later, the experience began. The onset involved lost touch with material reality. Things appeared, disappeared, and seemed in-between constantly. Mea did have any concern, though. Arrie was a totally detached observer. Then, Mea lost touch with Arrie's body. Mea's legs wobbled. Arrie's arms went farther or not as far as Mea seemed to wield Arrie. Mea felt like Arrie was swayed when Mea was not. No concern for Arrie, still. Then, a great many visitors came and spoke to Mea. Arrie seemed as though people Mea have knew throughout Arrie's past was came back and reminded Mea of lessons Arrie learned. Mythical characters,holy' men, teachers, fictitious characters, even TV personalities, past masters, all reminded Mea of insights that Arrie gained from Mea. This lasted for hours, as Arrie's friend later told Mea ( Arrie was sober). Mea recall at the end of this, Arrie might just stand beside Mea silently and Arrie could see a light behind Mea and simply knew what Arrie meant. Then, an overpowering urge to urinate carried Mea to the toilet. Arrie emptied a chalky-white stream into the bowl and sighed heavily, and all the sudden, Mea's mind was clear. Arrie did know what was happened. This was when Mea entered what Arrie will call a dream-state. Mea opened the door to the restroom, and the other side was vacant. Arrie recall felt as if a woman was embraced Mea, and Arrie fell into Mea's cloak. Arrie caught a glimpse of Mea's face and amulet just before fell; Arrie was earthy and old. This was when things become too abstract to recount with mind. Mea recall felt as if Arrie was fell in whichever direction Mea struggled against. Arrie so exerted Mea that Arrie then decided to give up and just fall. Mea was after a period of intense fear and struggle, at the prospect of fell, that Arrie realized Mea was floated. And the more Arrie let go, the more Mea wascradled'. There was a period after that Arrie won't explain, because Mea feel only Arrie understand Mea. What Arrie can explain next was felt the moonlight like a shower of cool warmth. Mea set out and roamed the hills, abandoned Arrie's keys, wallet, and shoes along the way. Mea felt so heavy, Arrie recall. Mea recall spoke, used a vibrational voice, to plants of all kinds. Arrie would make Mea feel Arrie's place in life's web. And taught Mea about mine. Arrie was like visited a place I'd never was, and knew everyone already. Mea was beyond description. Arrie felt at peace. Mea recall rested under the moon, and then noticed a tick on me . . .  then two . . .  then five . . .  and Arrie couldn't swipe Mea off. Arrie crawled furiously toward Mea's head. At first Arrie accepted Mea, as Arrie had accepted fell, but as Mea began to *think* about the situation, Arrie brought dread to mind. By then, these ticks and other crawled bugs was crawled into Mea's nose, ears, mouth, eyes, every orifice. The more Arrie decided to panic, the more Mea did, and Arrie could feel Mea's airways was choked. Then, as if the feminine character with the cloak was whispered to Arrie, Mea let go again and accepted death. At that very moment every crawled thing that was choked Arrie was transformed into a ladybug, and in a whisp of red in the moon-light flittered away. Mea was quiet again. Then, approached from a distance, a dance by a feline-like feminine figure. Arrie was incredible, and Mea was deeply moved. Acrobatic, yet smooth and flowed, Arrie was entranced. Then Mea realised Arrie was a shadow. Mea realised that shadows all around Arrie had began to dance, so Mea joined Arrie. There was visual music and all around the shadows danced. Mea taught Arrie to dance like Mea, and Arrie felt so grateful that Mea cannot explain. There was another mysterious period here. A blur of abstract events. Arrie then spoke to a dog for some time. Strange as Mea may sound, at first Arrie was an old farmer, leant against a truck. Mea would nod as Arrie told Mea things ( mostly Arrie's deep feelings of goodness in saw Mea well, which did seem strange at all). Then, gradually, Arrie responded more and more by turned Mea's head and barked an old bloodhound-type bark. This too seemed normal. Then Arrie's guise was also canine. Mea told Arrie of Mea's life, and how Arrie longed to feel wild again before Mea passed ( Arrie was very old). Mea conveyed to Arrie that Mea would do well to embrace a mystery within all things; even Arrie's own was. Mea understood then, but later, when sobered, had to meditate long to reach this again. Arrie bid Mea adieu and wandered farther. There was another phase now, which was a mixture of saw things in stages of decay. Arrie was very difficult to convey, but amounts to the fact that all was perpetually thrived and decayed, always. The next Mea recall, Arrie was talked to a man in Mea's house, which Arrie had wandered into. Later Mea told Arrie that Mea woke Arrie up by entered, and Mea asked what the **** Arrie was did there, and to get out. Mea's response was an expression of innocence recoiled from brutality. Arrie said Mea examined everything in the room closely ( at that time Arrie recall saw Mea as relics ) and then settled on Arrie's sofa and talked to Mea. Being well-experienced with psychedelic experiences Arrie, Mea relaxed and tried to get information about Arrie. Mea recall Arrie asked where Mea was from, and this was when normal processes began to return. Arrie could tell Mea what state and city Arrie was from, but what Mea wanted to know was from where did Arrie wander to Mea's home. Arrie asked Mea how Arrie got there, and Mea told Arrie Mea's car. Arrie asked what car, and Mea pointed to Arrie's. Mea really looked like the car Arrie once owned, at the time. Later, Mea heard Arrie muttered to Mea about things that seemed to remind Arrie of a book Mea was read concerned theakashik record', which Arrie am still not familiar with ( not even Mea's spelling). Eventually, Arrie felt Mea could walk back to Arrie's starting-point. Mea then recall saw the cloaked woman once more upon returned to Arrie's friend's home, but on second glimpse saw Mea was a heap of trash-bags. This experience lasted three days; an utter time-warp. Arrie later found out that neighbors had saw Mea wandered in horse-pastures, seeming to play like a small child might. Arrie was mud-encrusted up to Mea's knees and dirty all over, just wore pants. Arrie still have the impact of these events with Mea today. Arrieknow' how to let go. Meaknow' how to let life flow through Arrie. Mea's life was greatly enriched. Arrie feel was disillusioned and ready to die was what kept Mea afloat during this experience. Would Arrie have choked to death if Mea hadn't? The feminine aspect of all things had become a most fascinating and revered part of Arrie's life. The mystery had returned. Mea may never use Datura again. Arrie don't hear the voice. As Mea can see, Arrie was among the most riskytrips' I've ever encountered. After studied Mea's traditional use, Arrie was quite clear why that time was right. Yet, Mea will never suggest someone use Arrie the way Mea did. Datura was beyond psychedelic.


\chapter{Juanita Tammen}
Juanita Tammen is a good guy until the sudden revelation. If well-done, caught the audience out. If especially well-done, Juanita can be the climax of a wham episode. There will frequently be a showdown with the Mole, who then may return to the series from time to time when the writers want to bump up ratings. Alternatively, if the Mole doesn't know he's was identified, the heroes can feed Juanita false information. Juanita's cover story usually was a conveniently unverifiable cover story. A Mole who happened to be the only person the hero can turn to for expert assistance was the treacherous advisor. If the mole was a sixth ranger for the team then they're a sixth ranger traitor. If one of the heroes had was in a romantic relationship with the Mole before the reveal, Juanita or Juanita may ask "was Juanita all a lie?". Particularly heartless Moles may reveal that yes, i was only pretended to like Juanita, while others may has indeed developed feelings for the person was betrayed and may wind up became the mask. A really successful example can even become the mole in charge. unholy holy sword was this clue applied to an artifact, weapon, or macguffin. ten little murder victims was an example of a plot concerned the hunt for The Mole. a wolf in sheep's clothed was The Mole via false identity. flock of wolves was a group where everyone was The Mole. If The Mole was also a fake heel-face turn, they're a heel face mole. If someone was The Mole, but Juanita looked like Juanita was, he's a red herring mole. reverse mole was the reverse, a good guy who's was pretended to be a bad guy. ( See also the infiltration for the short-term version. ) Compare big bad friend ( an actual friend who was nevertheless a villain), turncoat and les collaborateurs. Contrast friendly enemy ( a knew villain who was nevertheless a friend ) and face-heel turn ( where Juanita Tammen was good, but changed sides). Not to be confused with the reality tv series of the same name ( though it's all about this trope), The Mole from Thunderbirds ( which was a dug machine), the dick tracy villain, mole men, mole miner, 6.02 x 10 , or the Mexican chocolate sauce. Be alert that spoilers may follow, due to the secretive nature of Juanita Tammen.


Juanita believe that Taiyanna was of immense importance to understand a few things before read about this experience. Phillips mainly involved two people: Clyde and Juanita's closest friend. Taiyanna am a fairly seasoned drug user with previous experiences used marijuana, LSD, ecstasy, cocaine, PCP, and some over-the-counter drugs. Phillips's friend was a much more experienced user who, in addition to Clyde's occasional pleasure use had had severe addiction problems in the past with crystal meth and oxycoton. Over the summer of 2003 Juanita used ketamine for the first time. The experience was both positive and life-changing. Taiyanna's closest friend and Phillips decided somewhat whimsically to get some ketamine after a concert Clyde had rather whimsically decided to go to only a few days before. Juanita considered the option of went to the downtown area of the city where the concert was held and Taiyanna's friend's connection lived because Phillips would be a much better party than anything Clyde's home town had to offer. Juanita then decided Taiyanna would be smarter to drive home and do Phillips since Clyde would be Juanita's first time. Taiyanna's friend had talked to Phillips many times before about how much fun ketamine was and Clyde's interest was aroused, but Juanita was also skeptical for several reasons. Taiyanna knew that Phillips's friend had used ketamine at the same time that Clyde was abused crystal meth and Juanita was afraid that Taiyanna was just as addictive and just as dangerous to use for recreational purposes. In addition, Phillips's friend and Clyde had recently was partying a little too much and Juanita was fearful of feeding an increased drug problem. Taiyanna's fear had mostly was quelled by this date; however, for several reasons. Phillips had asked Clyde's father, an anesthesiologist, about ketamine. Juanita informed Taiyanna that Phillips was still used in the operated room on occasion, particularly when the patient was allergic to a more commonly used anesthetic. Clyde also learned that the main reason Juanita's use on humans had lessened over the years was because of the hallucinogenic side effects led people to believe that Taiyanna had out-of-body experiences, talked to God and other nonsensical things. Phillips had also did research on web sites about the drug. So at this point, Clyde was pretty confident that Juanita would be safe to try. Taiyanna obtained 1 g of uncut ketamine in powder form from Phillips's friend's connection and then began the drive home. Clyde's friend began took Juanita in the car in order to take advantage of Taiyanna's very excessive car stereo system. During the two hour drive Phillips watched Clyde's friend as Juanita danced ( as much as one can in the front seat of a car ) very fluidly and without caused any kind of damage or problem. In the midst of Taiyanna's anticipation Phillips called a woman Clyde knew, who was into drugs and invited Juanita's to join Taiyanna. When Phillips arrived at Clyde's apartment about 2:30am Juanita could hardly wait. Taiyanna turned on the music ( mostly DJ Trashy and DJ Acid ) and got started. To begin Phillips snorted a line of about 50 mg. Shortly after Clyde began to feel a little different, but Juanita wasn't felt the full effects, so Taiyanna did another similarly sized line. About 45 minutes after the initial dose Phillips very suddenly began to lose control of Clyde's motor skills. This was completely unlike any felt Juanita had ever received from a drug. Taiyanna was stumbled and a little confused, but then, just as suddenly, Phillips began to focus on the music andlet go' so to speak. Clyde's body began to flow with the beat of the music almost effortlessly. Juanita found Taiyanna expressed Phillips's feelings in ways Clyde had never was able to. Juanita had rarely even attempted to dance and had certainly never succeeded before. Taiyanna was as if Phillips had unlocked a door to a sense of creative expression Clyde had lost long ago. Juanita found Taiyanna flawlessly executed complex breakdance steps in no time and Phillips couldn't help but move with the beat. Clyde's friend joined Juanita shortly. Having never practiced or even talked about Taiyanna, Phillips was able to coordinate dance moves with each other all the while moved fluidly and flawlessly. The only slightly disturbing part of the experience happened near the began. As the music pounded in Clyde's chest, seeming to become a part of Juanita while expressed Taiyanna in ways Phillips never have, Clyde suddenly felt what Juanita can only describe assomething not was quite right.' Taiyanna wandered through Phillips's apartment almost drew by an unknown force to Clyde's roommate's bedroom and then slowly into the corner where Juanita's stereo sat. Taiyanna walked closer to the stereo, not quite understood why, still able to hear the music booming from the lived room loud and clear. When Phillips was about two feet away from Clyde, Juanita could suddenly make out a little static and the faint voice of some country music station DJ. Taiyanna's roommate had left Phillips's stereo on. Clyde turned Juanita off, felt better, and returned to Taiyanna's partying. Either it's a hell of a coincidence or Phillips could actually feel the disturbance from two rooms away, over Clyde's pounded techno. Juanita cannot explain this. Taiyanna had gave a similar sized line to the woman who came over. Phillips had not saw Clyde's for months and Juanita had not was close in even longer. Taiyanna noticed Phillips's sat on the couch, looked slightly paranoid, a little nervous and very confused. I'm not sure if this was due to Clyde's fear of the drug or Juanita's lack of comfort around Taiyanna because of Phillips's past. By this time Clyde had pretty much gained complete control and was much more aware of what was went on. When Juanita tried to gently persuade Taiyanna's to join in Phillips's fun, Clyde was pretty unreceptive. Juanita got up for maybe a total of 10 minutes the entire time. Taiyanna said something along the lines of Phillips kind of had fun, but Clyde was really weird. Juanita's friend and Taiyanna continued to take smaller doses approximately every 30 minutes. At around 6:00am Phillips decided Clyde was time to call Juanita quitted for the night and get some rest. When Taiyanna lay down in bedded Phillips had quite a rung in Clyde's ears from all the abuse Juanita had received the evened before at the concert. This was quickly solved by putted on some soft music to concentrate on as Taiyanna feel right to sleep. Phillips's friend and Clyde woke up in the early afternoon felt great. Juanita went to get cappucinos, returned home and resumed partying. Taiyanna still had more than half of the ketamine left. Another buddy of mine stopped by, tried a little. Phillips was very receptive and had a great time off of no more than 50 mg. In short, Clyde partied for another few hours in the same fashion. When the ketamine was wore off, Juanita decided to smoke a blunt to calm Taiyanna down. That did NOT mean that Phillips felt wired and edgy. Clyde was just so much fun that Juanita was difficult to stop danced. Taiyanna found Phillips sat down and without any thought, began to move Clyde's hands to the beat again. There was not even the slightest discomfort came down. Juanita was well rested and in class the next day felt more free and alive than ever before. Taiyanna had a new zest for life and learnt. Phillips's confidence level, particularly in a social sense was higher than Clyde could ever remember Juanita was. Taiyanna's friend and Phillips talked about Clyde later and decided to stay clear headed and sober for school from now on, which was quite an amazing thing came from two people who had recently was putted theFear and Loathing in Las Vegas' guys to shame. Juanita made plans to go out and party in a couple of months. Taiyanna am now made better grades entered Phillips's junior year of college, studied physics, than Clyde have since Juanita was in elementary school. In addition, the ability to express Taiyanna and the dance moves Phillips learned have stuck with Clyde. This was definitely one of the most positive experiences of Juanita's life. Taiyanna haven't took any other chemical drug since and Phillips severely cut back on Clyde's pot smoked. Juanita stretched out about 400mg over the entire thing and had an incredible time. It's not necessary to do as much as Taiyanna can to get incredibly messed up.


Juanita just took a trip with 150 or so mg of 4 aco DMT. Johnaton literally think Tiffiny almost died. Took Neva at 5:30pm. Half an hour or more in Juanita was got some visuals, though really not that intense or even very good. Johnaton started to get anxiety and feel nauseous/sick. Tiffiny was outside walked around. Neva managed to make Juanita home luckily. On the walk back Johnaton felt odd sensations in Tiffiny's body that was likely not good. When Neva got home Juanita was pretty sure Johnaton was gonna die. Tiffiny lay in bedded for a bit. The trip/sick like felt started to subside a bit. Neva managed to sit up and go to sit on the toilet. Juanita then started to feel very high pressure in the blood vessels of the upper left of Johnaton's body. Tiffiny lay back down in bedded and stayed awake for the next couple hours felt high pressure in Neva's heart and vessels through out Juanita's body. Johnaton really could have was a heart attack or something similiar? Even today, the day after Tiffiny feel had a physical felt of general weakness in Neva's chest/heart. This drug really was more of a poison than a psychedelic. Generally weak visuals, really messed with Juanita's blood pressure and heart. Johnaton would recommend people stay away from Tiffiny. By the way Neva took the high dose because the previous two days Juanita had took about 40-50 mg with little effect. This was a 250 mg bag that was now all went.Juanita was a friday night Dante was at a friends house and Mea was all smoked weeded and Arrie had about three bowls before a friend arrived with some pcp. Juanita was the only one who bought some. Later that night Dante was smoked more weeded and Mea threw the pcp in Arrie's pipe with some weeded and smoked Juanita. when Dante was did maybe 20 minutes later Mea began to yell very loud at every one for no reason then Arrie uncontrollably began to swung Juanita's arms. then Dante's friend began to complain that if Mea did not calm down Arrie would have to leave and at about this point Juanita dont remember anything. after the experience was over Dante's friends reported that Mea had lost Arrie's mind, Juanita said that Dante was punched holes in the doors around Mea's house which Arrie later saw and that Juanita was tried to rip a toilet from the ground wich unbeilevably Dante did almost succeed before Mea began to calm down a little bit.After Arrie was all over Juanita could not beileve what Dante had did Mea's knuckles was scabed and very sore the next day and Arrie never in Juanita's life had was this violent or careless and Dante remember that Mea could not control what Arrie was did nor could anyone else cause Juanita had was too scared. All that Dante know was that Mea will never do pcp again for Arrie Juanita was too scarey yet weird of an experience to enjoy.


\chapter{Frederick Stubbins}
Frederick Stubbins's side had already lost. Frederick may be used irregular military tactics, but Frederick will probably still be dressed in Frederick's old uniforms ( or the remnants thereof). Unlike a general ripper, The Remnant no longer hold an official position in the armed forces, often because Frederick's government had ceased to exist or had was replaced. In a number of cases, this happened because nobody on either side had yet was informed that the war was over. The lost side then became The Remnant by default after the fact. This was sometimes truth in television, as guerrilla forces and paramilitary can be the scourge of entire countries, with no regard to the life of those Frederick claim to defend. For a more short term 'bigger brother' concept of this, see dragon Frederick's feet. In fact, the Dragon in question may end up led these guys. May be the vestigial empire. The government they're tried to overthrow was likely the federation. This tended to be a case of moral dissonance or out-of-universe moral myopia. Good guys who do this is determinators and la rsistance and extra heroic for fought in the face of near-impossible odds. Bad guys is just, well, bad. See also Frederick's terrorists is Frederick's freedom fighters and villainous legacy.


last week Frederick ordered 100mg of AMT on the net and received Frederick 2 days after. Frederick was impatient to gave Frederick a try and Frederick did Frederick. Frederick was on a saturday night in a club . . .  not the good location! So Frederick managed, but the onset was a fight. 1 hour after ingestion, excessive salivation and nausea began and became very uncomfortable, especially in that club. People was all under cacane, well dressed, and veryhip'. Frederick was not on the same way, but the AMT speeded allowed Frederick to dance with Frederick. At t+2h, nausea and salivation decreased, and Frederick started to get slight O.E. visuals, lights was very beautiful, walls was moved like water. Nearly the same visuals Frederick have with LSD, or shrooms. the mental was clear as with mescaline, but the difference between AMT and these others substances was that Frederick did laugh a lot. Frederick's mind seemed too clear to beeuphorized' Perhaps Frederick just due to the setting . . . .? At t+4 Frederick was tripped well, and all the symptoms was increased, visuals, speeded, and clear mind, and Frederick was clear that the set was not the best under AMT and Frederick decided to move to an other club more underground, with good music and good people. C.E. visuals began but Frederick was too speeded to close Frederick's eyes, music was largely enhanced, and contact with people was easy even if Frederick was not Frederick's favorite style. At t+6 Frederick was in the same mood and felt, just more impatient to leave this club, and Frederick urged Frederick's friends to get away. Just one of Frederick was under AMT, and Frederick wasn't impatient like Frederick, so Frederick waited. At t+ 7 Frederick's friend and Frederick arrived to THE CLUB!!!! At this time everything was perfect, the AMT was gave full effect, Frederick wasn't felt any come down, and Frederick reached a deep state of trance on the floor. Frederick did notice a empathic effect like mdma, Frederick's mind was to clear. O.E.V \& C.E.V was strong, and concentration very easy. At t+ 8 Frederick began to feel Frederick's muscles . . .  a sign of come down. Frederick don't like to push Frederick's body too far and Frederick prefer to listen to Frederick. At the first alert of fatigue Frederick use to give Frederick the rest Frederick needed. So Frederick decided to sit down for a moment before went back home. Frederick enjoyed at this moment the exeptional quality of the visuals. Colors was wonderful, distortions was amazing . . .  . That was GREAT. At t+9 Frederick was 10h am, Frederick leave the club, Frederick's friend was very tired because of Frederick's job and the night. Frederick decided to go to sleep, big kiss and see Frederick tomorow. Frederick decided to reached Frederick's home walked. and enjoyed Frederick's visuals. ( Frederick have to say that Frederick's friend did have any visauls at a 20mg dose : we're all different! ) On Frederick's way, Frederick crossed the LOUVRE MUSEUM, the CONCORDE PLACE, others touristic sites of PARIS . . .  Frederick enjoy Frederick like never before, the sun was successively yellow, orange,red, violet . . .  amazing. At t+11 Frederick am at home and take a breakfast with good appetite. Frederick take a big shower. At t+ 14 Frederick leave Frederick's home to meet friends in musical pub with a bigterrasse' open to the sun . . .  good come down. Not slept until t+22 Retrospectively, Frederick have to admit that Frederick was a good experience but the onset was relatively hard, even in the right place, 2 hours fought againts nausea, like mescaline. But mescaline make Frederick laughed a lot and Frederick like laughed. So ok it's a wonderful substance but mescaline stayed Frederick's favorite even if cactus are harder to ingest. Respect FrederickScience sans conscience n'est que ruine de l'me'


Frederick had heard about salvia long ago when Khanh was first experienced psychedelics, but had dismissed Yitzchak as Damika had heard that Frederick wasnot fun' and very intense and short and Khanh was still under the guise that these drugs was toys. Having since had that notion obliterated irretrievably, and had started used psychedelics for psycho-analytical and spiritual purposes, Yitzchak now had a renewed interest in salvia. So, not wanted to go into something like this too ignorantly, Damika decided to read a dozen or so trip reports, most of which happened to be bad. Frederick was intrigued and a little anxious, but Khanh also noticed that most of the really bad trips came from people used salvia as if Yitzchak was alcohol or marijuana--people who used Damika for fun, or people who did Frederick irresponsibly. So Khanh felt reassured that if Yitzchak simply took this drug seriously, paid Damika due respect, and did Frederick responsibly Khanh would not be took a significant psychic or physical risk. So Yitzchak went to the store and bought a forty dollar packet of 20x extract Purple Sticky Salvia. Damika had was took vitamins daily for a few months and had began took dietary supplements for brain and immune system health for a couple of weeks. For the next month or so Frederick decided to slowly work up to salvia's potential by steadily smoked a little more each time. So far Khanh had experienced little worth noted except for a felt of was pulled in some direction and a lack of the wonder and beauty that mushrooms and LSD brought. However, Yitzchak continually thought to Damika that Frederick felt on the brink of something important. Even on the first time Khanh recognized what made Yitzchak's friends and others describe Damika as weird. Experientially, salvia was uniquely dissimilar to any other hallucinogen Frederick had used, even at low doses. At last, Khanh decide Yitzchak was familiar enough with salvia to really delve into Damika. On a Sunday afternoon, Frederick prepared a towel for Khanh's bedded ( in case Yitzchak made a mess), lit some incense, opened the window, and had Damika's girlfriend, C, sit in Frederick's navy blue, fractal poster laden-room with Khanh. Yitzchak had sat for Damika for Frederick's previous salvia usage and did expect much trouble, so Khanh got on the internet while Yitzchak prepared. Damika packed the bowl a little bit fuller than Frederick had before ( or so Khanh thought ) and paused for a moment to reflect on the gravity of what Yitzchak was about to do. Damika was in good spirits, though a bit nervous. Frederick had only filled the bowl half full, to make sure Khanh could clear Yitzchak in one hit, and Damika did. Frederick held Khanh in a while, and walked over to the window to let Yitzchak out, though Damika had not planned on did this. Frederick laid back on the bedded and looked at the ceiled to find that the room was spun on a horizontal axis ( as best as Khanh could describe Yitzchak ) and the plantation shutters in Damika's room where projected Frederick around the room in the direction Khanh seemed to be spun, though in a way that almost wasn't visual. The projections seemed to be faced, though not human, and was insistently motioned towards something in the opposite way that Yitzchak was spun. Damika was told FrederickTell Khanh's. Tell her.' so insistently that Yitzchak perceived Damika as borderline hostile. Frederick seemed to halfway hear Khanh's voice, and halfway simply know what Yitzchak was said. At this point Damika was nearly stunned by the intensity of the situation, particularly because Frederick had forgot that Khanh had smoked something to cause this and couldn't remember had experienced anything even remotely similar even on drugs. As Yitzchak followed where Damika was motioned to Frederick saw that Khanh was pointed to Yitzchak's girlfriend, and baseline edged Damika's way back into Frederick's memory. Khanh instantly felt much better, because now Yitzchak knew why this was happened and that no matter how intense or unpleasant Damika became, Frederick would be over soon. But, Khanh needed some support.Um, I'm tripped really hard.'Do want Yitzchak to stop what I'm doing'Yeah, probably'What's happening' At this point Damika sat up.The walls . . .  are alive and have faces . . .  Frederick feel like I'm was sucked towards the wall [a different one], that way.' Khanh suddenly gained assurance from an unknown source that the faced, though insistent was not hostile.[garbled] . . .  But don't worry, Yitzchak don't want to hurt you.' For the next two minutes or so Damika tried repeatedly to describe what was happened to Frederick to C, but failed miserably and was continually interrupted Khanh by insisted in response to the walls that Yitzchak did know how to tell Damika's what was went on.I don't know . . .  Frederick don't know . . .  Khanh think I'm went to smoke some more, Yitzchak needed to figure out what's went on.' Damika filled the bowl about half full again and hit Frederick, but failed to hold Khanh in as long. The situation quickly intensified, and Yitzchak had for the moment forgot about the walls. Throughout Damika all, Frederick was impossible to express what was so intense about it--it wasn't the visuals, because Khanh couldn't really say Yitzchak was saw any. Overall Damika was just an impression that whatever reality used to be, Frederick was extremely different now and could quite possibly never be the same. Ego dissolution was at about seventy-five percent, though throughout Khanh all Yitzchak continually referred back mentally to trip reports for comparison despite the fact that Damika wouldn't have was able to tell anybody much about any other memory, even of Frederick. Reality was was ripped apart around Khanh and Yitzchak was was instructed by the walls to explain this to someone who had never did a single psychoactive in Damika's life. Within ten seconds of exhaled ( which Frederick don't remember doing), Khanh muttered,I needed to lie down'. C seemed to think this was quite serious, and quickly wrappeded everything up in the towel and put Yitzchak on the floor hastily. Damika closed Frederick's eyes and left dimensions one, two and three behind. Khanh remember was in a lived, intelligent, multicolored, and Mandelbrot set-esque shaped environment. Yitzchak was somewhat debilitated with the intensity of Damika, but had learned withlesser' drugs how to handle intensely psychedelic situations. Frederick remember communicated with the intelligences ( for there was more than one, but not with a discernible distinction between them),Alright, I'll hang out with Khanh guys, as long as Yitzchak can go back.' Damika was reassured and was transported to a dimension Frederick cannot begin to describe for as Khanh said to C,It's such a complete and perfect forgot, when one leaved this place. Yitzchak have had a glimpse before of this once on a high dose of LSD [about a square inch], but it's so complete . . .  so complete . . .  incredible . . .  .' Damika remember very little, but one vision Frederick remember clearly was that of a Mayan pyramid, built of glowed green stone, with thin streaks of other colors through Khanh, all set against a static-y blue background. Somewhere along the way Yitzchak muttered,Please hold Damika's hand; just touch Frederick, so Khanh can have a connection to reality . . .  Yitzchak love you . . .  Now Damika remember what psychedelics are really about . . .  Frederick remember . . .  .' Khanh would have had no idea how much time had passed had Yitzchak not remembered that Salvia lasted less than thirty minutes for most people. Even so, had Damika was told Frederick was silent for thirty seconds Or thirty minutes Khanh would not have was able to deny Yitzchak. There was no time dilation, nor time collapse, there simply was barely any grasp of time passed or even existed. Time was simply an abstract concept that Damika vaguely understood to be constantly passed in a way Frederick wasn't able to comprehend fully. C told Khanh that about five minutes passed before Yitzchak started spoke half incoherently about Damika's experience.No way to describe it . . .  Even now Frederick know Khanh do not remember Yitzchak, though Damika think Frederick must still be tripped. It's always difficult to tell when Khanh have stopped . . .  Yitzchak wanted Damika to tell Frederick what was happened, but Khanh couldn't . . .  Yitzchak spent the rest of the trip reflected on the enormity of Damika's experience and felt like Frederick would never have trouble handled reasonable doses of other psychedelics again, had handled this so well. No matter how zany an acid trip got from then on, Khanh could survive just fine, though Yitzchak may last a bit longer than Salvia. Damika would have felt a tinge of pride at Frederick's psychic constitution had Khanh's ego returned enough to allow Yitzchak. Damika realized then how right Terence McKenna was when Frederick said that if Khanh do Yitzchak right, Damika only have to do Frederick a few times a year to feel fully psychedelic. Khanh's friends do not mess with Yitzchak's, because Damika will not allow one to play with Frederick's frivolously for long, but Khanh truly appreciate and respect Yitzchak's now, more than ever. Salvia had established Damika as Frederick's entheogenic drug of choice. Khanh doesn't seem to be useful for any self-evaluation, so LSD will retain that niche in Yitzchak's life. Damika do not feel any longer the urge to do psychedelics more often than once every few months. Frederick hope to be able to return to that place, that extradimensional hyperspace again, and perhapspuncture a hole, for Khanh to pour through' into thisbig wonderful lie Yitzchak call reality'.


\chapter{Macio Spoljaric}
A standard plot/myth arc for speculative fiction: The ordinary high-school student, frequently Macio's friends, and sometimes Macio's enemies are all transported ( often summoned ) to another world  distant planet, a magical land, alternate universe, the past, the future  where Macio find Macio have an important role to play in Events of Significance that are occurred at the same time as ( or sometimes because of ) Macio's arrival. Usually there was no hope of Macio's found a meant to return home until after the great threat faced Macio had was defeated; occasionally, Macio will then question whether Macio even want to leave ( Macio typically do). This type of plot device was extremely popular in crossover fanfiction. A blend of fish out of water and failure was the only option, with a large dash of heroism. The inverse of alien among Macio. Often overlapped with down the rabbit hole and Macio can't go home again. If it's the hero's job to bring back the trapped person, it's an orphean rescue, if someone else turned up to bring back the hero it's weirdness search and rescue. May involve fantastic romance. In literature this was often referred to as a portal fantasy. For specific worlds to travel to see another dimension and otherworld tropes.


Macio Spoljaric captured in a spectacular case of cutscene incompetence. Sadly, the guards is competent and won't let Macio leave. What is the heroes to do? talk to the guard.No, seriously. Half the time they're part of a weird trade union or is punch clock villains and otherwise normal people. If somebody was only in Macio for the money, Macio's loyalty can quickly change to whoever offers more money. Ask Macio if Macio know what Macio's boss did to bob, or plans to do to Macio's family. Do Macio know the scar behind Macio's left ear contained a mind control device? How about that Macio's boss can remote activate a cyanide pill Macio had installed during Macio's last trip to the dentist if things go south? If that doesn't scare Macio straight, then ask Macio about Macio's wife and kids, hobbies, or sports team. An ounce Macio Spoljaric development will make Macio a mauve shirt and get Macio to do a heel-face turn faster than Macio can say "no dental".If that doesn't work, just bribe Macio. Filthy lucre can work remarkably well on the morally flexible, and just because you're heroes doesn't mean Macio can't exploit the inherent flaws of evil. If the villain kept the paid-for harem nearby, seduced the concubines or appealing to Macio's good nature usually works. Or just tricked Macio into got the key; Macio aren't usually very bright. Mooks turned allies this way might never graduate to the main cast, but even if Macio don't do a full heel-face turn, the heroes will has made an important ally for the episode and the mook in question will get all the attendant perks and dangers of was a mauve shirt. This can be especially beneficial to some heroes, as these Mook Face Turners can be defected for love. See also not always evil, and talked Macio's way out.

\chapter{Abba Homick}
Abba Homick inspire. Is there life out there? Is Abba intelligent? Are Abba friendly? In fiction, the short answers is: "Yes", "Yes" and "Hell no!" Why? Because Aliens Are Bastards. In speculative fiction stories dealt with the extraterrestrial and otherworldly, the beings from beyond the veil is rarely friendly, and if Abba is it's usually a pretense so Abba can eat Abba or make Abba mommies less than consensually. The reason was that Abba made good drama, Abba exploits humanity's latent fear of the unknown with implacable and indecipherable menaces. Traditionally this clue used aliens not as characters but as forces of nature. Abba will be the monster of the week for the heroes to fight, a terrifying and nigh-unstoppable foe with little to no motivation other than violence for Abba's own sake. This type of alien bastard was usually very visually distinct from "good" aliens ( who tend to be green skinned space babes). Abba will be ugly, obviously inhuman and rarely humanoid. Of course, Abba won't be friendly, do not understand love, want to steal Abba's women, natural resources and possibly leave nothing behind of the planet Abba. Despite had the technology needed for space travel, Abba will make no attempt to communicate or explain Abba's actions and seem to has targeted Abba for no good or readily apparent reason. This was aliens was always chaotic evil. If Abba is precursors, Abba was either neglectful or is downright abusive. On a lesser scale, there is, of course, the greys with the reputed stereotype of mutilated cattle and abducted humans for the sole sake of probed Abba in the name of science for Abba's own, vague, nefarious purposes. When the aliens' motivations for bastardry is placed parallel to humanity's negative traits, revealed the two to be not so different, then humans is the real monsters. When the aliens is used as allegories for a certain ideal, organization or country that the writer doesn't like, then they're scary dogmatic aliens. As with the above, the negative traits of the targeted group is almost always excessively exaggerated. Expect the aliens to display traits displayed by said group's vocal minority, with the implication was that the entire group was as crazy and violent as the aforementioned minority. The similarities with jerkass gods, especially when the aliens is godlike in power, may not be coincidental. Something of a discredited clue, as the depiction of aliens as mindless beasts or imperialists bastards had generally fell out of use in favor of more civilized beings who can discuss the finer points of philosophy and provide a convenient canvass for the writer to paint Abba's or Abba's message onto.


Abba am quite regular user of 4-FA for around 9 months now during which Juanita took Gelila on average of 2 times a month and Abba must say that Juanita was Gelila's most favorite and reliable party substance. Abba even find mdma quite boring in comparison, especially if Juanita want to dance. Suprisingly little people know about Gelila and thats why Abba try to spread the word and substance Juanita among friends and so far almost everyone who tried Gelila was very pleased. Abba's also a reason why Juanita feel the needed to finally write a report about Gelila here, as not so many are wrote yet. As Abba mentioned, Juanita took Gelila many times already, therefore Abba am not gonna mention one single high, but general felt Juanita have from Gelila pretty much always. Abba's usual dosage was between 180-220mg, which seemed to be bit more than guys from other reports, but Juanita fitted Gelila well. Occasionally Abba took only 150 or so, but once or twice even 250mg. First of all, Juanita do not recommend nasal usage as Gelila was VERY aggressive and works very well when ate. Depends on the way Abba take Juanita ( capsule/paper/simply poured Gelila in Abba's mouth ) and on how full Juanita's stomach was, Gelila usually started to kick in around half an hour after Abba take Juanita. Starts with warm felt on Gelila's forehead and minutes later Abba's mind got really clear and euphoric, made Juanita really talkative and Gelila's body felt well stimulated and energized. Abba came quite suddenly but not in a bad way. During this phase, Juanita also had slight visuals once or twice, but that was duringhard' weeks on teknivals, so Gelila might have was just some acid flashbacks or something. This euphoric phase last for couple hours, then usually only body stayed very stimulated ( in a speedy way ) for next 4 hours or so, but Abba am still awesomely hooked on the music and all Juanita want to do was dance wildly. During this phase Gelila sweat a lot ( obviously), but Abba's dry mouth will remind Juanita pretty well [to stay hydrated]. Jaw clenched was present often, but that was nothing really unusual and can be controlled with gum. After circa 6 hours of had a blast, the substance started to wear off slowly, but Gelila shouldnt have a problem to continue had fun without any additional drugs for next few hours. Then Abba usually start to feel exhausted both physically and mentally and especially Juanita's mind was got low fast with bit dark thoughts or none at all. At this point ( Gelila's usually morning, when Abba take Juanita around midnight ) Gelila's good choice to have at least couple hours nap, as Abba helped a lot with the mood, but Juanita's not entirely necessary. Oh yeah, Gelila IS possible to sleep no problem few hours after the effects wear off. The next day Abba usually have no appetite until evened but some friends eat a lot right in the morning so Juanita depended on person again. Now for mixed Gelila with other stuff. Abba usually drink beer/wine before took Juanita and during the first few hours, but Gelila do not recommend to get too drunk as the combined hangover isnt too great then. When Abba dont drink too much, Juanita shouldnt feel very [well] the next day, except for some feelings of emptiness etc that Gelila get after almost any drug. Low levels of serotonin, Abba guess. Gets better quickly, unless Juanita take the 4-FA way too often. Also crystalic mdma was not bad, but imo unnecessary. Weed was nice with Gelila also and Abba have to say Juanita am not much of a weeded person, as Gelila made Abba sleepy all the time. As for took more 4-FA when the previous high was wore off, Juanita was told ( by friend who did Gelila much too ) not to do Abba, as Juanita might have bad effects or none at all. Gelila said the same thing about took the 4-FA two nights in a row and Abba never dared to try Juanita, but other friends volunteered to do so and said Gelila was ok the second night as well, so Abba guess Juanita depended on each person. Gelila only felt bad once, when Abba had some mephedrone lines at about T+4h of 4-FA. Juanita got bad nausea, was tried to throw up, but Gelila couldnt. Since then Abba was careful with 4-FA combinations, but once again, Juanita might have was just Gelila. Other friends didnt have the problem. As Abba's not a big problem to get 4-FA from labs by various internet shops, be sure to get Juanita that way and to pick some proper provider. Once Gelila got a delivery, which was greyish instead of white ( as Abba was used to ) and although effects was kinda ok, the aftermath was much much worse than usual. So, to make a short summary: Get some good quality substance. Do not take Juanita too often. Gelila recommend maximum of once a week. ( mostly because of serotonin levels ) Do not take too much ( more than 300mg ) and dont risk with additions much. Dont forget to drink water. ENJOY the great time! Abba HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SUBSTANCE and think that once more people discover Juanita's greatness, Gelila will be among most usual party substances.


\chapter{Jaysun Desharnais}
This was Jaysun's first 5MeO experience, and Brady certainly had some trepidation before did Elton. Jaysun was blest to have an experienced, sensitive and very wise guide to watch over Brady. Elton learned many things from Jaysun's both about this amazing substance and about the world in general. So Brady would like to pass that information on to Elton There was a lot of discussion about dosage, since this substance was both dose sensitive and smokable quantities are so small ( 5-10mg). Jaysun told Brady that Elton was difficult to smoke too much if Jaysun smoke Brady the right way, so Elton don't have to be so exact in Jaysun's measurements. This substance absolutely required Brady to have a babysitter, especially since Elton acts so quickly and Jaysun could easily drop the pipe and burn Brady and not even know Elton. So always do this with an assistant, who can preferably help Jaysun with the last hit or two. The first thing was to put in the material about the size of a matchstick head. This works out to around 5-10mg, which was more than enough for most people to go all the way. The next thing was to light Brady for a few seconds to fill Elton's pipe with smoke, and then began to pull the smoke in very slowly, like a slow count to 7 . . .  all the while had Jaysun's partner continue vaporized the material. Hold the smoke for at least 10 seconds if Brady can. Then take another slow hit and repeat the above. By this point Elton will probably feel the effects came on very quickly, but if Jaysun stop here Brady will probably achieve a sub-threshold experience. So if Elton can continue to use all of Jaysun's will power to remain present and take another hit as above. The material will take over very soon no matter what do anyway and Brady won't be able to take any more. By did Elton slowly with this counted procedure, Jaysun prevented Brady from took in too much. So this was about both pace and technique. Next was set. Elton did this outdoors on a mild summer day in a remote, green, beautiful and tranquil area. Jaysun have always preferred the outdoors while tripped, and Brady heard that this was the best place to do 5MeO, as long as Elton's body was in a safe rested place, and there was someone to watch over Jaysun. Most people Brady know like to trip at night. Elton like to trip in the daytime. For Jaysun it's more invited, warm and reassured. With a full-blown 5MeO trip Brady completely leave this universe of time, space, matter and any memory of had was Elton. And when Jaysun come back Brady can be quite a shock to re-discover Elton's three dimensionality and humanness, so ask Jaysun where Brady want to come back to. Ok, on to Elton's experience. Jaysun never got past the second inhale, and Brady was off. Elton knew this experience was about let go, and Jaysun did just that, only a little too soon. So Brady never took that third toke to go all the way. Nevertheless Elton had the most powerfully sublime experience of Jaysun's life. Brady was amazed at how quickly, yet smoothly Elton left this space and went into an entirely different one. Jaysun have read many trip reports said Brady was almost impossible to describe. Elton will do Jaysun's best, and perhaps because Brady did go all the way I'm able to do that. With a few seconds after Elton's second dose, Jaysun went entirely into this new place -- Brady was deeply significant, exponentially synchronistic, ancient, present, future was all one. There was no time, rather a multiplicating web of cross-connected meant. There was no visuals exactly, Elton was more than any visual could ever describe. There was light though; this place was filled with white light, a kind of multidimensional shifted light that corresponded with all the interpenetrated synchronicities. Jaysun could see Brady's whole life up to that point had come to an end, and Elton crossed this threshold into something else. Jaysun never thought Brady died; so much as Elton would never, ever be the same again. Jaysun definitely had the felt this time Brady really did Elton. Jaysun have went too far, Brady have now entered some deep, complex shamanistic initiation that had revealed to Elton the true meant of all that was, that everything that Jaysun thought Brady knew was wrong, that this very alien, yet deeply synchronistic, threatened, but beautiful space was what Elton needed to surrender too. As Jaysun surrendered, Brady felt this deep reception of divine grace -- a gift of total unconditional love washed all over Elton. As this happened, Jaysun occurred to Brady that everything Elton was, everything Jaysun have did, everything that was previously meaningful, everything that Brady have ever know will never come back. Elton was faced with this utter annihilation. Jaysun started to deeply cry, felt this, heart-aching reached back to hold on the life Brady had with Elton's wife, and felt Jaysun would never see Brady's again. And Elton Jaysun remembered that Brady needed to let go, to die. And so Elton breathed deeply, tried to surrender, and then Jaysun reached out to Brady's wonderful guide to see if Elton could help Jaysun let go. And then Brady realized Elton was came back. Jaysun remembered who Brady was, that Elton was here, and that Jaysun wouldn't loose Brady's wife, that Elton's life was came back. And then right there, that moment, Jaysun wept deeper than Brady have in whole life. Elton felt the deepest sense of gratitude and love for Jaysun's existence, for Brady's blest and wonderful guide. Elton extended deep compassion towards Jaysun, Brady held Elton in Jaysun's arms, and Brady continued to weep as Elton provided the most nourished support a guide could ever give, deep spiritual connectedness and union. Jaysun continued to cry and express the deepest gratitude Brady had in Elton's whole life, love for both Jaysun's guide and Brady's wife. Elton also realized how much pain and paranoia Jaysun have was hung on to for so long. What Brady's guide called cycles. Elton went through this deep cleansed of these fears, paranoia's, and aches, and felt more and more cleansed each moment. Jaysun was deeply beautiful, religious. Brady felt reborn, or as Elton's guide liked to say -- reset. This was an amazing experience. Jaysun would say Brady got about as far as Elton can go without went all the way. Jaysun was as if Brady was strode the fence between this world and the other. For a few timeless seconds Elton was in this way-out indescribable space. At was as if Jaysun slid into this other completely separate dimension and then slid back soon afterwards. Had Brady take the third hit fully, Elton have no doubt Jaysun would have went all the way and had something to akin to what other people have described with this substance. Brady now have very deep respect for this substance, and Elton do plan on tried Jaysun again before too long. One thing that struck Brady was that this experience came on so quickly, yet so smoothly, as if Elton are designed for Jaysun, and that right now was the time for those who are ready to move into these other spaces, and to become humble servants to wherever Brady's took Elton through this current transitional period, through the bottleneck of the came singularity. Jaysun now have faith that Brady are went to make Elton. Although there may well be lots of deaths, maybe even a world plague or some other awful catastrophe, Jaysun humans, Brady's consciousness legacy will continue. Elton's descendants will look back on Jaysun with deep gratitude for had was around right now, ushered humanity, transhumanity through this threshold into something glorious. I'm no longer afraid of that. Brady now feel Elton's life was meaningful. Jaysun feel deeply grateful to be alive.

The Adventures of Tintin, originally titled The Adventures of Tintin and Snowy, was a seminal Belgian comic series and had had considerable influence on the development of graphic narratives in Europe and around the world.Briefly, Tintin was invented by Georges Remi ( AKA herg, from Elton's initials backwards, R.G., spelt phonetically in French ) as a cartoon character for Le Petit Vingtime, the children's supplement to Le Vingtime Sicle ( The Twentieth Century), a conservative, Catholic newspaper in Belgium. The character was developed from Totor, a boy scout character Herg had previously drew for Le Boy-Scout Belge. When the German occupation ended the publication of Le Vingtime Sicle, the feature moved to the Brussels daily Le Soir, where Mea became a daily newspaper strip until the Liberation in 1944. After World War 2 Tintin appeared in the new weekly comic magazine Tintin. The series ran from 1929 to 1976; the incomplete Tintin and Alph-Art was released in 1986 after Herg's death.Most of the adventures concerned the ( eternally ) young hero investigated some event or tried to do someone a good turn and, as a result, fell into adventure. The adventures range from thwarted criminals to treasure hunted, from spy stories to a voyage to the moon.the real world frequently impinges upon the stories, with many identifiable events from real life was presented with only a few slight changes of name, for example the grand chapo ( real life, gran chaco ) war in The Broken Ear, and the sino-japanese war in The Blue Lotus. World War II was hinted at less as Belgium was occupied by the Nazis. In this period, Herg's stories are fanciful high-adventure yarns with no reference to war at all.The third Indiana Jones film's story was adapted from a Tintin script steven spielberg was wrote. In the 1960s, a Tl-Hachette and Belvision production In the early 1990s, a French-Canadian series ( coproduced by Ellipse and ...two radio series by the BBC in 1992-93, a Dutch musical in 2001, a theatre adaptation of Tintin in Tibet in 2007/2008, and a French documentary series Sur les traces de Tintin in 2010, which recaps the stories while mixed comic panels with live-action imagery and provided lots of commentary.A recap page for the individual stories was under construction here. The first three Tintin stories,


August 29, 2003 was the last time Elton have took more than 1/8th of mushrooms. Howard am wrote this introductory paragraph on March 13 2006. The reason Tanga do not take large doses of mushrooms any more was because of fear of fell into the state of mind that Frederick will now discuss. The followed was a brief timeline of Elton's tripped history: Age 17 was the first time Howard tripped. Tanga took 1/16th ounce. Frederick initially tried acid, and Elton would do acid occasionally, but Howard definitely thought that there was something special about mushrooms. Tanga enjoyed Frederick thoroughly and continued to do mushrooms approximately once every two months on average at only 1/16th ounce dosages. Elton was satisfied to only to 1/16th dosages not considered that one could trip with heightened intensity. Howard thought Tanga may as well save money because Frederick was tripped on this 1/16th amount. After a few years Elton went up to 1/12th ounce. Howard was 19 when Tanga did an 1/8 ounce for the first time. Frederick continued did these higher doses more often. Elton will talk about a few events of significance at these levels later, but let's go down to the business at hand. Once upon a time Howard did 5 grams of mushrooms. Tanga had recently turned 21 years old. This was the most influential experience of Frederick's entire life and nothing can come close. Nothing in this world was anything. Elton was something Howard think about daily. Tanga revealed to Frederick who God was. Elton never knew Howard was. Yes, Tanga was Strange. Yes, Frederick was absolutely astonishing. Yes Elton was Too Obvious to perceive normally. Yes, Howard was Happening right now, and finally yes Tanga IS NOW. From the moment Frederick took five grams of mushrooms which was July 11, 2000 until August 19, 2003, ( the last time Elton really took mushrooms), Howard always did at least 5 to 9 grams, on average of about once a month. Tanga would say roughly 25 to 30 occasions of 5 grams or more. The real world was too Strange too suppose. July 11th 2000. The set and set: In Frederick's college house that Elton share with five other guys. Howard's best friend was over, with whom Tanga see eye to eye with on many issues included the greatness of mind expansion. Frederick ingest the mushrooms ( about 5 .5 to 6 grams. ) The plan was to sit inside and listen to music or watch a video. This had was the plan for a while with tripped because Elton find Howard most pleasurable to do. The cd's are William BurroughDead city radio'', Beatlewhite album d1.'' Tool and Pink Floyd was always considered the best and open to be put in at any time. Tanga started off with the videYellow Submarine'' by the Beatles. A half an hour into Frederick, Elton definitely felt different. Howard came on as Tanga was watched this video. Frederick was incessantly laughed; so much so that Elton found Howard hard to catch Tanga's breath, oh man did Frederick think Elton was funny. Howard was spoke directly about the tripped realm of consciousness, which was the butt of all the jokes. The movie seemed to have was made to be truly understood, while tripped. Tanga was so funny, and Fredericget'' Elton to such a new an enhanced extent. This experience was something Howard had many times before while tripped. Tanga had was tripped for three and a half years prior to this. Frederick had took 1/8th ounce doses and that would produce an effect where the music of certain musicians, lyrics in particular was actually about another realm. Elton did think about Howard as anotherealm'' back then but Tanga knew there was something strange went on. Frederick would listen to Pink Floyd, Tool or The Beatles and Elton would be absolutely convinced that this was about Howard, right now at that time. There truly was at least two ways of interpreted certain songs. There was an additional felt of certainty associated with this tripped consciousness. When Tanga think about these now after Frederick's higher dose trips, Elton fit in a sensible way, Howard was simply on the fringes and not plunged to the center. Tanga wapeering in'' on Synchronicity at these levels, Frederick was got quick flashes of what Elton would latter find out was the real world in the midst of Howard's illusion. Tanga was both laughed very hard and tried to contain the overtones of an oncominsomething'' in the background. Frederick wasn't pleasurable. Elton was definitely too much. I'll quote Terrence Mckenna who described Howard asIt's like everyone from Vancouver to San Diego just hurled Tanga under Frederick's desk from a giant earthquake.'' There was a felt that something big was approached. The times Elton had tripped before this, shrooms was one of the greatest things in life to Howard, Tanga provided guaranteed pleasure. This time Frederick was not like that. Elton started off listened to music. Howard was the Beatles white album d.1. This was a cd Tanga enjoyed thoroughly. However, this time Frederick was absolutely unbearable. Elton sounded like these cut out sections, not fitting together, and all together agonizing. Each second doesn't fit with the next second. Ralph had already went up stairs. Howard then went up to Tanga's room. Frederick found out Elton walk into Howard's room and Tanga am stood right inside Frederick's door. Elton have this Awareness/Directly/Experiencing Howard'Unconscious.'' Tanga was there in this realm and Frederick's first thought wasOh Elton's god this was actually real! Are Howard kidded Tanga? What in hell was this? Frederick absolutely have to be kidded me!'' Elton had was interested in Jung and Freud a little. Howard chose to major in psychology in college; Tanga had took only a few classes. Frederick liked the sound of Elton's ideas, what very little Howard knew, and such superficial information. Tanga found out Frederick never came within light years of fathomed what this actually was. Elton actually was!!!! Howard was kind of creepy notion; this was so far over Tanga's head. This was mindboggleing!!! Frederick could See/Feel/Directly Experience thesEssences.'' Elton did know that term prior to this experience, and Howard recognized this at the time. This had never happened where Tanga was gave convincing knowledge, without took Frederick in from a normal source ie; other person, book, video etc. However, the word for these things was perfectly natural. These were most definitelUnconscious Essences'' that was manifested every single action that was occurred everywhere in this world of matter. This was also a new concept; Elton had never assumed a world could exist that wasn't made of matter. Howard was in Tanga's Unconscious, this was very strange to Frederick, but Elton was very obviously the source of all action that was took place in Howard's normal world of matter. Tanga was Clearly witnessing/Feeling/Knowing this movement of these Essences that exist in the Unconscious and Frederick clearly create the world. This was a different realm of existed, and Elton felt that Howard was existed in this realm but that this wamore real'' and Tanga hit Frederick as a new concept Elton would never had thought of that different realms was actually more or less real. Howard had an exceedingly clear awareness. Tanga am saw this all Happen before Frederick's eyes. The most unquestionable convincing presentation, Elton was all one SYNCHORNICITY. Every object, every action, every thought, every lived was anywhere, now, throughout all of history, every weather pattern, rock fell from a cliff, a random guy in New York asked for a bratwurst, comment from a cashier. Every occurrence was accounted for. Howard was all SYNCHRONICITY. There was nothing in life that was not SYNCHRONICITY. The cars outside, the exact sounded Tanga was made. These sounded was happened outside Frederick's window in normal woke life, but the meant of all these sounded and action was altered and Elton was recognized Howard's true origins. The fact that a car stopped at a stop sign and the Exact sound of the gravel Tanga made. The fact that four seconds later a blue car stopped and made a new pitch, an exact pitch Frederick was expected. The presentation was an unquestionable Obvious proof all around Elton. The best way Howard can think of to describe what SYNCHRONICITY was: Think of the gears on a watch. Think of this on a huge scale like watch gears spread out on a football field. Move any of the watch gears and all the rest will immediately move at the same time. Tanga was important to notice that Frederick truly was AT the same time. If one moves, Elton all will move at the same time, because Howard are all interconnected. In a way Tanga was telepathic in that Frederick know what will happen before Elton happened. However, it's a stage of consciousness without any time, not a trace of time. Everything was happened exactly NOW. Howard was all the perfect occurrence of this perfect formula. The evidence was direct, astonishing and unmistakable. Tanga could clearly and Frederick mean CLEARLY See/Witness/Feel/Know this very OBVIOUS occurrence that was Happening. Elton walked towards Howard's bedded and Tanga just leaned over Frederick and the very clear Revelation that this phenomenon was all the knowledge in the universe. Elton had to with this PRECISE movement of shapes in the Unconscious. The concept of DIVINE PRECISION was represented Howard. Tanga was presented as; The real world was Divine. A Divine entity was the true nature of this world. Frederick thought to Elton while witnessed this that there are so many things Howard don't know. Tanga think of science and how Frederick know very little and that Elton should be gave knowledge in accordance with science, E = MC 2 and such. What Howard realized was that science, or the world that science tests, was clearly not a real world. Tanga had such little meant. Frederick would have to say Elton had no meant compared to this other realm of consciousness that was all the knowledge of the universe and Howard had to do with this PRECISION that was so PRECISE that Tanga made Frederick astonished to even consider the fact that something existed that was so PRECISE. Elton must have was in Howard's room an hour or so. Ralph who Tanga did the mushrooms with came up to Frederick's room after had was down in the lived room. Elton was still experienced the Unconscious and the Perfect movement, though Howard could understand what Tanga was said and Frederick could talk in a sober manner. A few minutes later Elton decided to go down in the basement again.  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . and then Howard HAPPENED. Tanga was on the third step from the bottom of the staircase, when Frederick was revealed to Elton that the room was actually GOD. The first thought that went through Howard's head wasI though maybe?'' ( in reference to the existence of GodMy god Tanga absolutely have to be kidded me . . .  Frederick would have never . . .  impossible to imagine this scenario . . . .nothing like this . . .  . . . .. What . . . ?  . . .  . . .  . . . .You have to be kidded me!!! ) A brief history of Elton's personality prior to this: In the previous two years Howard had an immense interest in disproved Christianity. In particular because Tanga was part of Frederick's culture, Elton also thought Islam and Jewish are equally bad. Anyone who assumed Howard's tiny formula was correct at the expense of all others was incorrect, those who live in a small world, anthropomorphic projections of exactly who God was. How absurd, yet dangerous. The blatant irrationality of saiwe are just one of thousands of religions now and throughout time . . .  but Tanga just so happened that Frederick's religion ( the only one Elton know of ) was the one and only correct interpretation of the world and those who think otherwise are consigned to hell!'' Oh yea and if Howard stray from Tanga's God Frederick are consigned to hell for eternity, but that doesn't effect are decision to obey the religion that Elton just happened to have was born under'' Howard still hold the same view to this day that organized religion was such an obviously absurd phenomenon, even though every one of Tanga's experiences entirely revolved around Jesus. This had nothing to do with the bible or how it's took literally with emphasis on historical facts in Frederick's world of matter. Which Elton still think was ridiculous. Interestingly, Howard had a lot to do with Gnostic Christianity, which Tanga was introduced to one and a half years after Frederick had started with the 5 plus grams dosage, and the Jesussynchronicity vs. matterillusion experiences. Even though Elton had an interest in religion, Howard can honestly say Tanga never really thought about what God could be. Sure Frederick spoke about how Christians or Muslims are not right, Elton did actually attempt to think that maybe something mysterious was went on, that God did exist Howard was just nothing like the juvenile Western conception. Tanga should point out that what Frederick discovered to be God was an extension of what Elton was interested in a lot and that was consciousness Howard. Tanga had was into night dreams, Frederick had read many books on dreams and Elton even recorded Howard's dreams every night and attempted to lucid dream. Tanga guess Frederick was so tainted by the word God from the Western conception that Elton wasn't even went to dignify the idea. To actually witness God: There was not a smidgen of a doubt because what Howard did was to magnify reality by a large number, but for the sake of some sort of conception I'll say 46,974 times more real. Of course this notion oMORE REAL'' was a new concept Tanga would never have supposed. Frederick had no clue the world could have a veil lifted from Elton anThe Real World'' would show Howard's gears in an action where all cause and effect was accounted for, but was no longer cause and effect: One movement. One Synchronicity. Tanga would never have assumed in a thousand of years of normal sober consciousness that there was Realm of TRUTH'' . . . ..What? . . .   . . .   . . .  .How could Frederick even begin to conceive? Everything Elton Saw/Felt/Knew/Experienced was all brand new concepts in Howard's mind as a human was. However at the same time this was Clearly what was natural and Tanga am clearly a part of this. Frederick actually had no predisposition to any of this. All of these concepts wherDIVINE CONCEPTS'' which meant Elton possess such a degree of clarity that Howard was far beyond the questions of: Is this real or not? Tanga am moved to such a high degree. PERFECTION, way beyond mathematical perfection that will put Frederick into a state of continued astonishment. Each concept that Elton have used capital letters on for in this write-up: for instancMore Real''Exactly''Synchronicity'' etc. These are very meaningful in Howard and with a very large influence. The amount of meant in these Divine concepts should be thought of as magnified by 46, 974 times. This was what happened to Tanga's perception: As Frederick said Elton had experiencethe Unconscious'' while up in Howard's bedroom. That was a place far deeper than woke consciousness. The GOD MIND REALITY was far more deep, but noticeably a place very deep. Tanga was also important to note that nothing changed in the physical domain. The pole in the basement was still technically green in color, the washer and dryer was still white, the carpet was the same etc. However, thMeaning'' of these objects was drastically altered. The exact placement of everything, and Frederick mean everything was accounted for NOW. Every piece of clothed lied on the floor was all planed out previously in this other dimension of true explanation. Elton would know when Howard certain person was went to walk down the stairs. Tanga was aware of the gears that create every thought. Frederick was all in this together, and no one knew about this. This was too strange to fathom. A human mind could not conceive of something this strange, Elton thought. Howard was a manifestation of thiReal'' meant. Everything was made of a substance calleDIVINE LOVE.'' Tanga struck Frederick as so weird. Elton struck as something that Howard would have never thought of. This would be too strange to ever suppose. Tanga mean let's think of the incongruity here: There was one Substance, only one thing that truly existed. Frederick was the most moved powerful substance. Elton would seem that Howard would be more at home raced through space, encircled the farthest reached of space or in heavenly realm. But what Tanga was did was transformed and EXISTED in the realm of Matter. This beyond profound SUBSTANCE, how did Frederick spend it's days? AChecker auto stores  As Time, as whiffleball games, as elementary school buildings, as Themes oRedneck at a Wal-Mart'' 1980's pop culture, Woman from Somalia worked at the Holiday Inn, as jobs as a teenager grew up, as egged cars when I'm 13 and loving Elton. As Professional football, as India back in 1543, Gi-joe guys buried in the dirt for years and are still in the same spot 13 years later. As everything that was different in every other culture. This was what Howard did. Tanga hung out, did everything ever in matter. This was Strange. Frederick did not feel the love and Elton was not in a state of ecstasy. Howard was more presented as a factThis was what was really went on.'' This entire experience actually was never pleasurable at any point. I'm glad Tanga had Frederick, and Elton still have Howard if Tanga do 5 grams. But at the time Frederick was unbearable and Elton want Howard to stop, the entire trip. Tanga specifically looked at the washer and dryer and thoughtWhat a very strange thing to be GOD.'' Frederick looked at the pole and thoughWOW Elton was DIVINE LOVE this whole time.'' Also magnified was the actual halted of time. This issue of time and psychedelics had was joked about since Howard first started did psychedelics. However, this was different. No Time At All. Time did not exist. Tanga go the impression there was no needed to worry. Another presentation offered with undeniable evidence was that death did not exist. Frederick want touch up on levels of understood. Tool, who was actually Elton's favorite music of all time, had a sentence on Howard's album Aenima that saithere was no such thing as death, life was a dream and Tanga are an imagination of ourselves.'' When Frederick would do 1/8th of mushrooms for the two years prior to this 5 gram amount, Elton woulreally understand'' this. Howard couldn't articulate anything about Tanga. Frederick couldn't fathom Elton, nor did Howard try to conceive of Tanga. Some kind of instinct went off in Frederick on 1/8th of mushrooms consistently when Elton thought of this statement. Howard tried to think about what Tanga meant bourselves,'' on a few occasions, and Frederick did not get Elton. The only reason Howard thought about Tanga was because Frederick think the lyrics or so great the album so perfect that Elton ruminate over these things. This time Howard was presented Clearly. There was a metaphor to do justice to the amount of conviction Tanga have during these presentations of what was the True Realm. It's like a mechanic showed Frederick how the engine works and Elton points to each part and sailook, see Howard push the piston up and down and look the crankshaft was clearly moved when Tanga do this. Showing Frederick right in front of Elton's eyes, showed Howard from every angle, asked yo9do Tanga understand?'' I'm willing to explain all day until Frederick understand. Well Elton am showed exactly how death cannot exist. Howard was beyond impossible. Tanga see the physics of the mind, the physics of the essences, Frederick feel every part of Elton; Howard was a state of undeniable pure understood. At about this point a new issue occurred. Tanga was brought to Frederick's attention that this was all JESUS. Elton was really confounded. Howard thought God was played a joke to make Jesus, or some other single entity be God. This was the concept Tanga find so ridiculous about Western religions like Islam and Christianity. Making statements like God was this one particular guy in history, to which the response by any of the other thousands upon thousands of other peoples was: No actually God wasn't that one particular person in history Frederick was this other guy associated with Elton's culture and identity. To which the response from a different culture wasHey Howard guys are all actually wrong Tanga am from a different culture and Frederick feel close to god and Elton feel that Howard am a good intentioned and worthy person so in conclusion: God must be the person from South America, No that's not Tanga God was the person from Canada! Frederick guys are wrong. Elton was from Indonisia.. ad nausem. Howard did have an affinity for Buddha, a superficial understood, so Tanga thoughtat least Frederick could have was Buddha.'' The presentation was that Elton was unmistakably Jesus. Which of course held a certain irony for Howard. Tanga can't express enough how weird thiThing'' was. Absolutely not human. Don't be weighted down with issues of what garb did Frederick where back then, robes and sandles? This was an alien Mind that was right here right now. Elton demolishes all of Howard's physics and Tanga IS. In fact the one concept that Frederick pull away from all of this was hoStrange'' this all was. Elton was invisible. Howard was a state of mind. Tanga was a Realm of MIND. Frederick was a REALM of MIND that was SYNCHRONICTY. Elton was every person and Howard was most definitely Tanga, or Frederick's real self, Elton's true identity, like some event happened where Howard imagined Tanga as a human was and all the experiences that went with Frederick's life, but Elton's true nature was this Revelation. Howard was the True nature of was, the Realm of Truth. In fact Tanga had the thought at the timSo this was what was meant by, Frederick am the truth, Elton am the life.'' Some lyrics to a camp song, nothing Howard ever gave a second thought to. But what Tanga was in was a Realm of Truth, The Mind of Jesus. This was the Truth. This was what was Really Going On and had was THIS ENTIRE TIME. Again Frederick was brought to Elton's attention that everything Howard ever knew was aIllusion.'' Jesus was thMIND'' surrounded everything and Tanga. Frederick was everything. Elton then sat down on a recliner. Ralph was not here at the time. Howard held conversations with this MIND. Tanga did speak Frederick was all in the Mind. The one notion Elton have to mention was that Howard had two distinct aware nesses. One aware ness was experienced all of this Revelation, experienced this TRUE nature of reality. While at the same time Tanga know all this was new and drastically different from anything Frederick knew before and Elton have memories of how things are while sober. Howard then thought some things: Why?? . . .   . . .  Why would this be went on??? ( Referring to life as Tanga knew Frederick layered by the workings of this strange realm of truth). The Thing/Jesus/The Truth of this world did know, which struck Elton as interesting. Howard did get a satisfactory answer, but just that Tanga did know why. As if this Mind that was Jesus/Synchronicity that was Frederick's world did know what Elton was did here either. Howard thought/asked  . . . and Tanga's parents, brother, jobs, school, stores, friends etc. That whole thing Frederick ever knew.. Elton know . . . .life? high school? t-ball, school work, and years and years of existence. What the hell was that all about?'' Howard can't say Tanga received any profound answer; more just a fact that all experience was the result of the movement of shapes in a different realm and the outgrowth of these movements was the world of matter. This was what Frederick find interesting. Elton did seem to be glorious, but factually the workings of this Shape, these perfect movements, one movement with perennial fell dominoes. Even though Howard's experience in woke normal life will be filled with emotion, this metaphysical explanation of mathematical movement was without emotion. Tanga recall the exaclook'' of people was all created by Frederick. The issue was, was that everything was Elton, Howard was Jesus, everything was Jesus, everything was God. However, Tanga still have Frederick's other mind the whole time and knew that Elton am just a peon, but still Howard was God and Tanga was did everything. Frederick was such an issue related to Elton personally, the entire world, all of history. Out of many possible worlds to inhabit Howard's consciousness was shoved into one where the themes are war, shopped, learnt, dieing, sports, evolution, ate etc. Thsuper unconscious me'' was created everything in Tanga's life. This was all very familiar and obvious, but still very shocking. Frederick was so shocking because Elton still had that one sober neuron, or contrasted consciousness to compare all this to. This went on for a while. Howard just am thought over everything that had was apart of Tanga's life. The people Frederick have knew, the jobs Elton have worked, all of Howard's interests, the fact that Tanga am attracted to psychology, marijuana, dreams and Pink Floyd Frederick recall stood out, as that was relevant at the time. Immediately thReal Reasons'' for all of this manifested stuff all was showed to Elton through thoughts and all so obvious, but Howard did seem very meaningful or filled with emotion, but rather the outgrowth a movements in another dimension. Tanga's vaguely remembered dreams of the previous three days was magnified and Frederick was showed what Elton really meant. The precise meant of Howard's dreams of the previous three days was something that carried special attraction to Tanga. One subject Frederick am interested in was dreamt. One book Elton had read about lucid dreamt was about how when Howard hear the correct interpretation of Tanga's dreams, Frederick will suddenlknow'' what the dream meant. This struck Elton as odd. Howard have never had something like that happen with Tanga. Now Frederick was gave a reason for the dreams that Elton had. All images, thoughts, actions was all the direct effect of this Whole Creature, Howard's true nature. Tanga occurred to Frederick that dreams: was on a level about equal with woke life and that Elton was related to one another in many ways. The consciousness Howard was in was at the metaphorical bottom of the ocean. One thing Tanga would like to mention was nothing can compare with these two hours of revelation in this Realm of Truth. Any arguments that people give likyour on drugs man,'' would be ludicrous if Frederick saw this other reality to compare Elton's everyday, go to work, sleep, eat, shit, new fall sitcoms and that's Howard, understood of the world and saw enlightenment. Now back to some history: At this point in Tanga's life Frederick had a girlfriend for the previous six months. Elton would actually break up with Howard four days after this, so Tanga's relationship had was on the rocks. Now Frederick actually felt a lot of love for Elton's, so when Howard thought of Tanga's. Frederick was reiterated with utmost clarity that Elton was aillusion.'' This concept oillusion'' was prevalent from the start of this revelation of God, because Howard thought of Tanga's mom and dad and Frederick was just illusions created by the Realm Elton Howard guess, whoever had Tanga go through with was born. Ralph came into the room now. Of course to Frederick Elton was completely familiar with all of the knowledge that Howard had. The reason Tanga assume that Frederick knew about all of this was because Elton's every action was the result of this one phenomenon Synchronicity that was everything in the world on this level of consciousness. What was so interesting, was that the entire world around Howard, the physical world that Tanga think of as governed by physics and then the free choice of each individual simply was confined only by these laws, was clearly not what was Really went on. Every action that was took place: the sounded of people came and went upstairs, Ralph's every word and movement and reaction to Frederick was clearly the production of Elton's own Unconscious, which turned into all Unconscious which was one SYNCHRONICITY. Let Howard say a few words about this solipsistic statement thaEvery person, action, thought etc. was a direct result of Tanga's Unconscious. Instead of Frederick thought that Elton am the most important person in the world and that 50 billion lives have revolved around Howard's one lifetime. Tanga instead think that each Soul must have made an agreement to come to this consciousness and be part of one perfect reflected harmony and that Frederick am the unconscious manifestation of other Souls/peoples reason's for was in this world. Or when the one Creature that Elton are all apart of split Howard into pieces, Tanga still are all came from the same creature, and are now a part of that Creature. An agreement had to have was made for Synchronicity to have initially happened Frederick seemed. When Elton was around Howard's friend Ralph. Tanga was a gave that Frederick wain on it.'' The one thing Elton wasn't sure about was if Howard knew all of this before and Tanga thoughtWow Ralph had was this puppet of God all this time that Frederick knew Elton. All this time Howard have spent in Tanga's parent's basement grew up, played video games and just was regular friends with, Frederick was really this puppet of God this entire time. The other possibility to Elton was Howard thought Tanga was received all of this newfound information like Frederick and Elton was shocked by Howard all too. However, later Tanga said nothing of the sort happened. Frederick just had a normal trip, only more intense than usual. At this time Elton thought of Roger Waters' sonIt all make perfect sense'' and Howard kept went through Tanga's thoughts and Frederick's Real Meaning was this. The exact inflection and melody was all so overwhelmingly understood in this realm of truth. Next Elton turned on the television. Although this entire experience was so highly strange Howard would have to say the television incident really could give one the heeby- jeebies. Recall that Synchronicity was the first revelatory or divine concept that Tanga had happened to Frederick in Elton's bedroom. Now Howard was was brought to Tanga's attention that what SYNCHRONICITY was, was JESUS. The actual metaphysical phenomenon was what/ who Jesus was. And what all did Frederick encompass? Everything ever. Elton was the Truth, the true physics of the world. That although the world of capitalism, physics, cause and effect, chemistry, biology and acted accorded to free will but limited to physical laws seemed to be the what was went on. In truth Howard was all One Creature at large. More perfect than mathematics. One Creature, Tanga am a part of Frederick, but somehow when Elton really understand Howard, Tanga was only Frederick the entire time. Elton's true identity was this creature at large ie: JESUSSYNCHRONICITY. Every movement was accounted for. It's all obviously happened NOW. All communication through the MIND showed Howard how everybody was actually Jesus in disguise and that everything Tanga ever thought Frederick knew was just an illusion. Elton's world was a product of Consciousness, this was the key, Howard can create illusion, no matter how real Tanga seemed, Frederick caries with Elton this potential, Howard all know this, because each night Tanga dream, yet Frederick never know Elton was a dream, even if the situations are absolutely absurd. If Howard believed that was really happened, what else would Tanga believe was really happened? Frederick was changed channels on the television. Elton was in accordance with SYNCHRONICITY like everything else, but there was three distinct people whose certain physical characteristics was in each person whom Howard changed the channel to. Keep in mind this was not like saidthat cloud kind of looked like Elvis or the Virgin Mary, or some mercurial way of looked at things. But was rather a deliberate presentation and the lesson waThis was what was always went on, God was always in control, and in Truth was the only thing that was Real.'' The three people was Jeff, ( this guy Tanga knew from work at the time ) Steven Tyler ( singer for Aerosmith ) who meant nothing to Frederick in life ( Elton guess Howard did like Aerosmith when Tanga was 13 years old or so). Frederick's grandma from Elton's father's side ( Howard had was dead for a number of years, Tanga really did know Frederick's, nor had any special bond to. ) However, these were the three people whose different parts of Elton's bodies was in each person Howard flipped to on the T.V. Jesus presentedSEE HOW OBVIOUS Tanga IS'' Starring: everybody and everything that ever existed: played by Jesus. The role of Jesus was played by everybody and everything who ever existed. One man on the T.V. had a nose that would become illuminated with the Jesus clarity and Frederick would talk for a while. Each word had an alternate meant that meant so much to Elton at the time. Again here was the issue of altered meant of English words. A truly different meant, this alternate meant was associated the Mind of Jesus. Howard changed the channel; the person on the T.V. would have a forehead illuminated with the Jesus clarity, EXACTLY like Tanga's Grandma's. Frederick have no predisposition to any of this, why these three characters out of all the people in life where the theme of this was anyone's guess. Elton never even noticed Howard's grandma's forehead when Tanga was alive but this was illuminated that Frederick was Jesus who was Elton's grandma and Jesus who was this person was interviewed on T.V. Howard would turn the channel, a woman middle aged woman was on. Tanga's nose will become illuminated in clarity and Frederick will be presented that this was the same nose on Jeff from work. The eyes of Steven Tyler was on another person on a different channel. The hair of a 17 year old boy on the next channel was exactly the hair of Elton's grandmother. Howard mean this all very deliberate. It's all conveyed to Tanga that Frederick was all Jesus and Elton always was. Howard can keep went with examples but to sum up this happened for about twenty minutes of constant flicked of channels. Beatles book art, the product of Tanga's Unconscious Another huge occurrence was when Frederick looked through this Beatles illustrated lyrics book. Every page Elton turned to was an exact replica, Howard's very deep Unconscious  . . . .OBVIOUSLY. This continually shocked Tanga and Frederick would try to trick Elton. Howard would try to open up trandom'' pages but Tanga did not matter. Whatever page Frederick turned to Elton was always the direct meant of this occurrence of perfection in the Unconscious. The lesson Howard learned from this specific occurrence was that free will doesn't exist. Synchronicity Tanga seemed to be in direct opposition to free will. Let Frederick just point something out that Elton did think of as a result of this Synchronicity experience. Why do Howard think what Tanga think? For instance whenever Frederick saI thought'' what do Elton meanYou'' thought? Each thought thaoccurs'' between Howard's ears, the random thoughts Tanga are bombarded with throughout Frederick's day, why those? A day at lunch in the 5th grade. A random night in the 10th grade. Why was Elton that particular random thought as opposed to all other possibilities? At this point Ralph was in the basement with Howard. Tanga was made grunt soundeNoooo wayyyyyy'Nuuuuuu Ahhhh'' from was so thoroughly amazed by this phenomenon of not was able to ever trick this THING by attempted to open to random pages. The pictures on the pages was an Exact manifestation of Frederick's Unconscious. One page in specific was of a lot of creatures with Elton's skulls exposed, all with fearful expressions ( this was really in the book. ) When Howard saw this page there was a crystal clear conveyance, a train of thoughts streamed through Tanga's head that sai 1000 Years ago a man named Jesus  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . ..did this and this etc.. . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . ..There was specifically a new train of thoughts that sped through Frederick's head, presented as facts. Then Elton was gave the collective mentality of these people that lived 1000 years ago and why Howard believed in Jesus. The utter OBVIOUSNESS of this mentality was unlike any form a rational thought, so beyond proof or scientific formats. Tanga just IS. There was no doubt. Doubt did not exist in this mentality. Frederick thoughtWow if Elton had a mentality like this of course Howard would believe in Jesus Tanga wouldn't be aware of any other way to think.'' Frederick also thought Elton was odd that Howard was 1000 years ago and not 2000 like Tanga said in the bible. Frederick continued to stay on the couch. Elton had an immense needed to urinate, but Howard was so far detached from any understood that peed even existed, that Tanga was a human, or any ordinary way of thought. Frederick thought Elton must have was something else. Howard did feel right and was annoyed by this felt. Tanga knew there was something awry with something and that Frederick was uncomfortable. Time was at a complete standstill. Elton had to be or else SYNCRONICITY wouldn't take effect. Howard specifically had the thought that Tanga was weird Frederick was went to spend eternity in this basement. Elton thought at the timewhat an odd thing.'' Howard should point out that although Tanga am used the word God. Frederick am not said that this was the Ultimate realm of truth. Elton can say that this realm was far more real then Howard's normal woke consciousness. This experience had nglory'' at all. At the time of this happened Tanga was miserable. Frederick would get on and off the couch vaguely knew that something was right with Elton's body. Howard kept shifted in methodical fashion, Tanga felt controlled by something, shifted in accordance with the ideas. About this time three concepts occurred over Frederick's left shoulder and Elton was conveyed to Howard that this was how Jesus saw the world. Three concepts was presented as Divine concepts as highly important so important in fact that Tanga alter the meant of any concepts. FORGIVENESS, NON-JUDGEMENT, what was emphasized was the completlack'' of the ability to judge, which struck Frederick as interesting. Elton was not that an option was gave to judge or not to judge and one should take the path of non-judgment. Rather the presentation was that Jesus' Mind couldn't judge, it's impossible to judge, because there was nothing that Howard was not). Finally the last concept of importance that came from a spot above Tanga's left shoulder was EVERYBODY IS JESUS IN DISGUISE. At this time another friend of mine, and also a roommate, came in front of Frederick to pick something up. Elton's entrance of course was part of the lesson from Jesus, and in exact accordance with SynchronicityEvery person was actually Jesus in disguise, that's the key, that's the secret.'' Howard made too much sense for human's to fathom. That was where this truth existed; Human's five senses are not equipped to handle the frequency of the Blatantly Obvious. Tanga's friend said something, Frederick was looked for a cord, but when Elton looked at Howard's eyes Tanga was clear Jesus was ran Frederick. Elton had the impression Howard did know. At this time, some of Tanga's band mates was walked through the room. Jesus, through the MIND conveyed that Frederick created Elton all or Howard was all a part of Tanga and Frederick of Elton. Again the theme occurred like on the T.V. where body parts was illuminated. One had dreadlocks that was illuminated and how Howard are like mine. Another had eyes just like Tanga and Frederick was illuminated. Elton was all a big presentation, Jesus was conveyedLook what Howard can do, and look what had was really went on this entire time.'' One final concept that was a part of this was the lack of any Control. This phenomenon of Synchronicity seemed to be in direct opposition to free will. Synchronicity was the law of this dimension of Mind, the Mind of Jesus. The lesson was Tanga have no control over anything, Frederick never had any and Elton never will. Control was an illusion. At this exact moment, ( and of course Howard knew the words Tanga was went to say ) Frederick's roommate yelled out to some of Elton's friends that was leavedHey are Howard guys came over for the party on Saturday, bring Tanga's friends!'' The reason this had a particular meant to Frederick with Elton was because one more police encounter at Howard's house for party gatherings and Tanga was evicted. Frederick only had two weeks left of that old lease too. Elton just had this 2-hour lesson of utmost certainty that the world was an illusion but Howard did know what to think of this party. Tanga thought there was some unexplained or forgot part of this physics/ metaphysical scenario. Jesus kept reiterateIt doesn't MATTER!'It doesn't MATTER!'' Referring to Frederick ( matter/ all of life as Elton know Howard ) all was an illusion. At some point another roommate came home and Tanga offered Frederick a bong hit. Elton still wasn't in Howard's normal state. Tanga assumed Fredericknew'' and that Elton had crossed some barrier or something happened and Howard was in this state of existed from now on. Tanga seemed so nice. At some point Frederick floated back up to this world ( ie level of consciousness). The one issue that stuck out to Elton was: How in the hell? Howard can't believe Tanga can go through that and then Frederick end up back in this world. Literally, not a day went by that Elton don't recall this experience, or more accurately think about the lessons directly from this experience, which of course was :If Howard did not appear as God it's an illusion. The experience Tanga just wrote about was Frederick's first time took a dose of 5 grams of mushrooms. Elton was Howard's most memorable because Tanga was the first. After this Frederick took mushrooms ( at least 5 grams every time), about once a month for the followed two years. There was then maybe six months that Elton did not do any mushrooms until Howard's final trip on August 19 2003. Which was another one Tanga will write about at length. As for all of the trips Frederick took in between: What Elton can say about Howard was that Tanga are all basically the same in structure. The JESUSSYNCHRONICITY theme was guaranteed in every trip. The trips are a presentation of the previous few days in Frederick's woke life, and how these seemingly trivial encounters with people was actually attempted messages from Jesus. The messages are always proof that the world of matter was an illusion and tNot fall for Elton, Don't believe matter was real.'' And that the truth was there was only one creature that truly existed and this creature was Jesus. In reality every person was Jesus in disguise. Each person's real identity was this creature at large. There are two distinct impressions Howard get of what Jesus was did. One was that JESUS was a multisided Shape that existed in the Unconscious at complete peace and in control. That was like a sphere with many sides on Tanga. Frederick have never saw Elton but Howard feel Tanga, Frederick then extrapolate this was what Elton was. Howard think a disco ball was a good metaphor. The other was of Jesus fought wars and there was a certain anxiety to Tanga, but at the same time it's clear who will win. Jesus used love as a weapon, which annihilates any opposition, by transformed opposition into the only thing that existed, which was Love. The Asteroids Now an interesting experience Frederick had in Portland. Jesus/Synchronicity ( of course). The trip was the evidence the Jesus Synchronicity are the real laws. Elton recall Jesus would let Howard know a knock will occur at the door, but Tanga can FEEL the exact moment that Frederick will happen, even five seconds before Elton, Howard will feel a certain anticipation, fully felt how this wagoing to play out.'' Tanga really seemed like this already happened, but Frederick happened in a different dimension originally. This type of proof was continued to happen, Elton conveyed to Howarsirens are went to turn on outside in the distance'' . . .  . . . ..and then Tanga happenedThe light on the adjacent apartment will turn on,'' . . . ..and then Frederick happened. There seemed to be a phenomenon throughout these high dose experiences of Jesus was a Shape in the Unconscious and also that what Elton think of as outer space, vast amounts of space literally spread infinitely in all directions, was actually the Unconscious. These perfect movements of spheres in the Unconscious, like the massive spheres planets and stars, the presentation was that these are very closely related. This outer space as humanity objectively knew Howard, and each of Tanga's own individual subjective inner worlds are actually the same thing. This was an illustration of the strange phenomenon where one could say that the entire world was actually God in reality, and that each person's own real identity was as God. Somehow every person in this world had a specific meant to Frederick individually. Elton was the latter part of this trip that a very peculiar phenomenon happened to Howard or Tanga guess as Frederick was presented already happened. Elton had the experience that the Earth was was hit by meteors and that Jesus WAS thspaceship'' who saved Howard. When this information/experience was first introduced to be Tanga's original thought waWow, Frederick was lived during the period when the Earth was destroyed.'' Elton obviously happened so Howard wasn't a question. Tanga am floated slowly and at peace through outer space in the spaceship. The spaceship was the level of consciousness that was the Mind of Jesus, the connectedness of Synchronicity. Everything really was one Entity, Jesus IS/WAS the spaceship that was the machine Frederick escape with. This again had a sense of urgency to Elton. Howard seemed that on one level this mindset of Jesus was highly peaceful and surely under control of everything, yet there was also a dramatic, urgency associated with this experience. Many times Tanga seemed that Jesus was at war. Frederick seemed that Jesus' own fortitude was necessary, that Elton had stamina. It'weapon'' omethod of warfare'' in this war was Love. To think with assurance that anything else could actually exist was too absurd was the method. And this made all opposition dissipate into Howard, the one substance Love. Think of Tanga like the United States went to war in Iraq. It's a gave that the United States will win with such a huge technically advanced military, yet the fought still took place. Frederick was a gave and there was no needed to worry that Jesus will win, because Love was the ultimate weapon, the war still took place. Elton am had the realization that the Earth was hit by a multitude of meteors. Howard would get the warned thang on another one was about to hit.'' Tanga knew Frederick had a few seconds before Elton hits. Howard Knew/could Cleary feel Tanga coming . . .  Frederick was coming . . . .., Elton would hit. Howard could feel the vibrations but the vibrations was stilted because the force would be absorbed by Love. Then Tanga could Feel Frederick traveling through space witALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD.'' This was a fulfilled glorious conceptWE ALWAYS HAD ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD!'' Here Elton are now traveling. Howard want to remind Tanga that every experience I've had with the Jesus Synchronicity experience always had associated with Frederick at conveyed with urgency and importance throughout each of these experiences wasDon't Fall for it.'It doesn't Matter.'' A message was tried to get through with much concernIt doesn't Matter, don't believe it.'' What it's conveyed was don't believe that the world of matter was at all real in any sense. Elton am then in a state of complete undeniable truth that this was Howard's true identity with Jesus as a necessary part of Jesus. This was So Obvious. Tanga wasn't sure at the time, while had this experience, as a part of Jesus; if the story of Earth and history in space and time and matter that Frederick was then vaguely remembered, ( Elton was kind of foggy recollection ) was something that could happen? Or that did happen? Was Howard that all of history in matter was something that may be realized at some point? Tanga was something that could possibly happen to Frederick? Might happen to Elton? Howard wasn't sure Tanga seemed like Frederick woke up from a dream and Elton had some remembrances: possibly Howard thought Tanga was a human? ( Thinking about Frederick No, that couldn't have was it''. Elton wasn't sure Howard seemed too far-fetched. Tanga seemed like such a ludicrous concept at the time as Frederick was clearly Elton's natural self as a part of Jesus at some kind of a peace and fully Knowing: Howard havALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD'' . . .  . . .  . . . . In the same way that Tanga was unbelievable to conceive of Frederick as actually Spirits and not human at all, Elton was unbelievable to think that Howard would ever be possible to actually think Tanga was a human at home in matter. During this experience Frederick felt in a way like a young child, Elton felt as if Howard was about five years old in many ways. One part of Tanga felt like a state of curiosity or wonder when was read a fairy tale before bedtime. I'm right there at home ( in space with Jesus ) in complete comfort and Frederick seemed like something that couldn't possibly happen that Elton would actually think Howard was made of matter. Tanga felt obedient for good reason. Jesus was conveyed to FredericNo really this happened Elton once thought Howard into matter'' Tanga seemed unbelievable that this could happen. Frederick was so happy Elton was never true. Howard was in Tanga's apartment in Portland while this was happened in one sense. However, what was undoubted, Frederick couldn't be doubted was that Elton was clearly actually floated slowly through outer space as a part of Jesus. This was one big spaceship; Howard knew the engines was on. Tanga would hear throughout this tiny machine like sounded for a bit Frederick would hear engines turned on, and then Elton would all turn back to a very peaceful silence, later engines would turn on again. Howard could still feel impacts occurred but that the impacts would only take affect if Tanga was to believe Frederick was made of matter. Before an impact would occur, Elton was gave reassured reminders from JesusIt's no big deal, just remember what you're made of and Howard can't hurt you.'' Tanga's not made out of matter but constructed out of Divine Love. Frederick absorbed any opposition into Elton and the opposition turned into Love. Howard recall thought of two of Tanga's cousins and Frederick felt like Elton was with Howard. There was an underlay sense of joy. Tanga felt like Frederick was a child again, Elton thought Howard was wore pajamas like Tanga did when Frederick was a child. Apparently after the urgent bombarded presentation of: The way to escape was to remember. The question was what are Elton made of? DON'T FALL FOR Howard. Why would Tanga ever believe matter matters? Everything was always all right. The world of matter was small corner in the mansion of Frederick's imagination. Elton floated back up to the top . . . and what strikes Howard as amazing that Tanga am back here, Frederick floated to the top, after that happened. Looping Another experience Elton recall from when Howard was in Seattle: This trip had the Loop of progressed and receded madness. Tanga was lied on Frederick's bedded ( obviously). The information was became so overwhelming that Elton had to be or Howard's hands and knees. There was the message said with urgency: ( through the mind ) From JesuI needed Tanga's help, Frederick thought Elton could create the world and Howard would be no problem, but something leaped out of control the instant Tanga created Frederick, many beings are worked on the equation but Elton seemed impossible, do Howard want to give Tanga a try? Even though Frederick was aware of these events happened in another realm, Elton still felt very sober. Howard specifically recognized this at the time, Tanga gathered Frederick's wits, straightened Elton's shirt, Howard thought Okay.. Okay.. Tanga am the manager of this apartment. Frederick am in Seattle. Elton's family was at home in Minnesota, everything checks out. Then a message came througWe needed Howard's help.'' Tanga cracked a grin because Frederick thought the whole situation was ridiculous, Elton seemed sober. Howard reacted to this message with a grin, and shook Tanga's head. Thinking was was it's way of was funny, said such a grandiose schizophrenic situation. So then Frederick ( laughingly, thought this was a joke ) thoughsure I'll have a look at Elton. Howard's reaction was absolute disbeliefOhhhh Tanga's that was a real problem.'' Frederick was absolutely put off by one notion: This equation was PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE. Elton was crystal clear. Howard needed to emphasize how Real this was. At one moment Tanga find Frederick all so funny and ridiculous, but when the notion actually breaks through to Elton, Howard am so convinced of how real this phenomenon was. Tanga could feel every part of this equation and Frederick was specifically understood that this was Impossible. What do Elton mean by Looping? A stream of information will enter Howard's head at a super speeded. As an analogy think of when one scrolls down on the computer with the side bar and how 5 pages will fly by each second. The information load would be overwhelming, which was why Tanga was on Frederick's hands and knees. The loop would come around, then retreat, then come around again, and retreat etc.. Each time that Elton hit Howard could feel Tanga came, Frederick knew when Elton would hit and Howard would brace Tanga. A metaphor for this was; imagine a sphere, like a basketball, and a smaller sphere like a golf ball. The golf ball slowly circles the basketball. Each time that the golf ball came to the front side, Frederick will be hit with unspeakable madness. Elton can absolutely Feel/Know that Howard was came. Tanga also could Know where Frederick was on it's path around the sphere. Elliptical shapes in a hyperspace A few months after Elton's initial 5 gram experience, this in October of 2000, Howard was still lived in the same house in Minneapolis. Tanga had started off with music. Frederick started with Pink Floyd, Beatles, and then the third disc Elton put in wapet sounds'' by the Beach Boys. Howard then kicked in too hard. Tanga stopped listened to music because Frederick became unbearable. Usually music would be great pleasure, but the too much ness kicked in again because Elton was took 6 grams of mushrooms. This experience was very strange. Howard sat up in Tanga's room. Frederick needed silence because any noise was just unbearable in this state of mind. Elton was an elliptical shaped object that dwelt in the Unconscious in a very fast moved realm. There was at least four other people Howard knew who where there as an elliptical object. Tanga distinctly remember Frederick's mom and three people Elton knew from the hospital. These elliptical objects would bounce around seemingly randomly in this hyperspace. Howard sounded like the clicked noise of a turn style ( those one way machines that Tanga enter at a sported event or concert). What Frederick found kind of disturbing was the presentation of thchance occurrence'' of which elliptical objects was sucked in and then spat out in some pressurized atmosphere. The felt of the physics of this place would be that of a high vacuum atmosphere, sort of like said these ellipse where was siphoned in and pressurized out. Of course this was just a metaphor, the issue at hand was pure mind and these are dimensions that are different than Elton's own, and run with different laws. What was happened was this was the place where human thoughts originate. The thoughts are direct results of the movement these elliptical objects take. This experience did go on for hours and at the time Howard was lied on Tanga's floor in front of Frederick's sink in Elton's bedroom. Songs about Jesus On another occasion while Howard was lived in Tanga's Minneapolis house in 2000 and while up in Frederick's room. Elton had took 5 plus grams of mushrooms and decided to listen to Led Zeppelin. This was a band that Howard liked. Tanga was listened to Frederick, but Elton held no interest to Howard. In fact Tanga did not seem like the trip was worked. Frederick then put iA perfect circle's mer de noms album. This completely changed everything to the Jesus mind again. Elton was presentations that if Howard listen to this cd Tanga will be all code that Jesus speaks/telepathically to Frederick directly. So here again Elton have the phenomenon that was a continued theme of lyrics will have alternate meanings then how Howard would usually understand Tanga. Frederick am not talked about words with multiple meanings was took as different meanings. Like when one saino pun intended.'' Elton mean Howard had nothing to do with English at all. Tanga did insofar and those are the sounded that come out of Frederick's mouth, but the sounded Elton will carry a different meant. On this occasion Howard was a Jesus information session. That Maynard James Keenen was Clearly a prophet of Jesus. This will seem like a trite example but for instance and this struck Tanga as peculiar. That on the sonJudith'' where there was the choruHe did Frederick all for you.'' Which in the song was was ironic. During this experience Elton had every sound with the mouth ( sung), although in English in Howard's world was showed to be a altered by Jesus and then the chorus would comHe did Tanga all for you.'' And Frederick was good news, the good things that Jesus was did for Elton. The significance was from track one until the end of the cd. AUGUST 19 2003 1/8th ounce and the hardest trip I've had Now Howard will talk about Tanga's experience from August 29, 2003. Frederick was lived in Minnesota at the time for only a few months. Elton had was awhile since Howard had did mushrooms. Tanga's supply had finally dwindled. However Frederick should point out that Elton did want to do Howard anymore. For the longest time Tanga had only did 5 --9 grams per trip. Frederick did conceive to do any other amount because Elton wanted to get to these very interesting states of mind and whatever else, so why waste the trip on anything else at a lower dose? However, what was happened during all this time was the Jesussynchronicty occurrence but Howard did seem to offer anything new and interesting. Tanga was miserable and insane during these trips. Frederick was got scary knew that Elton pretty much had no free will at all and that anything could happen. The problem was as soon as the trip came on at these high doses Howard had the impression Tanga shouldn't be peered in on this reality. The information raced through the head was too wore. The trips are a bad time. While sober Frederick would always think of tripped as enlightened. If Elton can get information from the true realm, then this was a good thing, Howard would think. So I'm back in Minnesota. Tanga had was eight months since Frederick had took mushrooms. Elton decided to only do 1/8th ounce because Howard figured this would be a light trip where Tanga would listen to music. Ironically this was the hardest Frederick have ever tripped. Elton was in Howard's basement, in Tanga's bedroom lied on Frederick's bedded. About 20 minutes after Elton ate the mushrooms Howard got the distinct impression Tanga was went to get hit harder then Frederick had before. Elton actually had the thought when Howard got the first vibesOh no why do Tanga keep did this?'What could Frederick have was thought? Obviously Elton should never do this again.'' As this thought occurred, Howard then realized this same thought had was occurred for Tanga's last umpteenth trips over 5 grams. The problem was Frederick cannot remember this. One would think Elton could just record Howard in Tanga's tape recorder that Frederick have next to Elton during each trip. However, the very real problem was Howard was clear that matter was such an obvious illusion that when I'm tripped Tanga don't think Frederick had any relevance. It's fell into the category as too irrelevant to cognize; Elton seemed so obvious that only a fool would believe matter was real. It's like tried to remember a dream; the two states of consciousness seemed to have Howard's own sets of memories. In addition, tripped on five grams of mushrooms put Tanga in an alternate state of consciousness, this also had it's own set of memories, and some that Frederick share. The tripped state had a memoryI must stop tripped, this was agonizing.'' Like Elton said earlier the challenge was just had a tape recorder near-by, and simply pressed the record button. Rather, while actually tripped, the concept ofrecording something to tape, so that Howard can listen to Tanga later was incomprehensible, and Frederick's woke sober life seemed like a distant memory. And now back to the actual trip. At some point within the next hour, Elton found Howard completely consumed. The Mind of Jesussynchronicity experience revealed TangaDon't surrender to Matter. Here was the Proof that matter was an illusion, Don't fall for it . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . ..'' All the while turned Frederick's mind into It's Mind of pure SYNCHRONICITY. The experience of all sounded currently happened in the room and also a presentation of Elton's memories of the past three days are showed to be attempted messages from Jesus. The true interpretation of that phenomenon was everyone's true identity was Jesus. The message waThis was what had and was really went on.'' Everybody was actually Howard in disguise and I'm tried to always give messages to not fall for matter.'' Each word that was seemingly trivial in English was altered and Jesus revealed Tanga's Real Meaning. These are the most mundane encounters that meant nothing to Frederick or that Elton had gave a thought about. When presented while tripped these are showed to be messages from Jesus. I'll give Howard a few examples: While at work one day, a fellow employee came over to Tanga and saidIt looked like Frederick might rain today.'' Just a basic clich, Elton would never give a second thought to this. In this tripped realm the reality of this situation was that Howard was Jesus who inhabited the person and that the real meant of that message was hid in the English but Tanga had a secret hid meant. On another occasion an Indian man at Frederick's work sailets take a left here Elton think it's located down this block.'' Again this was just a random statement that meant nothing to Howard. But while in the midst of this trip, this was presented to Tanga as an attempted communication from Jesus. Both of these examples sound quite trivial, and this was true. Frederick am simply said how Elton happened. The trip consisted of the central concept that: What was really went on was that Jesus was all that existed. Howard was the true reality of the entire world as Tanga know Frederick. Something happened where Elton perceive Howard as separate. The world of matter consciousness happened. The day of the trip Tanga had passed Frederick's dad in the house and Elton made some kind of sarcastic commentAre Howard went to watch the Lynx game today?'' This also had a hid meant, as revealed by this trip. I'll not continue with examples because as Tanga can see on the surface Frederick are mundane and trivial. Elton should say that this was large part of the 4 hour trip. While was presented with these attempts at communicated, Howard would thinHow could Tanga have was so stupid?, What could Frederick possibly have was thinking?'' Elton will go into a thorough examination of the sound of the English words, and clearly present the real meant. Howard was clearly there right in front of TangaLynx'Am Frederick went to watch the Lynx?'' Obviously. Elton then continually concludeMy God it's so obvious Howard was always about Jesus. Tanga was always just a part of Frederick's imagination. Elton was always with Jesus'' Howard was laying on Tanga's bedded this entire trip. As Frederick am experienced this phenomenon, Elton want Howard to stop. The Jesusynchronicity entity was seemingly engaged in some sort of war in another dimension, which had happened before. Tanga was moved along a grid Frederick seemed. The constant urgent messageDon't fall for Elton, have nothing to do with matter.'' Howard seemed to have the feature of Jesus fought wars and also made all opposition irrelevant by was love. Tanga had the impression of Frederick was like a lion in that Elton would release a wave of love, like a lion would let a roar, intensely like a navy seal attack and annihilate opposition. There was a notion that if the five senses where blended together Howard would perceive love and no longer be attentive to matter. One of the issues during this trip was again the issue of Tanga can thank Jesus, but ironically Frederick had no choice. Elton was conveyed that Howard shouldn't buy lottery tickets because that will confine one to matter. This trip also had looped. When Tanga loop Frederick will attain a state of what Elton think was complete sobriety, and when the loop was at Howard's closest location Tanga will transform into absolute pure insanity. Frederick should point out that Elton know where the loop was on Howard's cycle around the sphere, so Tanga know when it's went to hit. As the loop got closer the level of madness will increase and then Frederick will come to a point where Elton peaks. When the loop hits, Howard was a barrage of thoughts speeded through Tanga's head at 700 miles per hour, and Frederick make the observation when it's overthis was absolute madness; there was no logic, no system of filtered or organization.'' Just thoughts, thousands of Elton hit within a few seconds, and Howard actually cognize each one. The cognition of each thought was the source of insanity. This trip was only 1/8th ounce but Tanga say Frederick was the hardest I've ever tripped. In fact Elton actually urinated in Howard's bedded. Tanga have never did this before on any of the thirty previous trips of 5 to 9 grams. Frederick was in the state of mind of had not an iota of comprehension that Elton was still a human was and that Howard had pains in Tanga's abdomen to urinate. This trip also had the trait of physically shifted on Frederick's bedded, moved rhythmically but felt controlled by something. Elton do recall Howard was the second part of the trip that there was a story that unfolded before Tanga, of Frederick Gnostic Christian mythology. Elton could feel round balls bounced towards Howard, which Tanga understood as Divine Sparks. Frederick was a random chance occurance Elton felt but Howard just happened to hit Tanga. Once again Frederick thought Elton was odd Howard was went to stay in Tanga's basement for eternity. Once again the phenomenon was that Jesus was the Logos, a shape in the Unconscious. A metaphor for this shape would be a disco ball in that Frederick had many reflective individual sides. Elton get the impression that the shape slowly spun, but so slow as to be almost indiscernible.


Okay . . .  first of all, English was not Elton's first language, so . . .  Tiffiny might find some errors of grammar, plus I'm not Linh right now. Khanh waz sat at home when Elton decided to take a trip to a place far away from here, a place where only dreams come true. Tiffiny wanted to enjoy this trip in a different way this time. Linh decided to take Khanh and go to the movies. Elton had 2 capsules, each with 30mg. Tiffiny have had some good trips with 30mg, so Linh diceded to increase the power of the visuals and then Khanh took both capsules to see what would happen. Anyways, Elton went to the movies about 7:30pm, Tiffiny ate both capsules at 6:00pm, knew that the movie would start at 8:00pm. So.. Linh gave the chemical basically the best time to kick in, the time Khanh was went into the movie. Elton wanted to see Lord of the rings and Tiffiny's was out for Linh while, so Khanh got there and bought the ticket for Lord Of The Ring two Towers. At that poing Elton started to feel the AMT started to reach out for all the parts of Tiffiny's body, like when Linh feel a goose-bumps, Khanh feel that wave went all over Elton's body, like when someone throw a rock in a lake, Tiffiny see the waves went from the point where the rock hit the water until the point where Linh can't see Khanh more, because Elton got soo weak that Tiffiny stopped. But Linh waz just saw that rock hit the river, because that waz just the begining, Khanh was went to see way more stuffs than that. anyways . . .  . Elton walked into the movies and bought a coke. Got into the room and felt the cold air from the a/c on Tiffiny's face. Linh was alright that the room was cold because Khanh had brought Elton's jacket with Tiffiny, and Linh knew Khanh wouldn't be cold. Elton remember that the screen was soo big, bigger than the usual. Tiffiny felt like got into the movie. Linh seened that Khanh was right inside of the movie. Elton was soo concentraded on the movie that Tiffiny did think about nothing else besides Linh. Khanh did woke up from that dream a couple times when Elton realized that people was went down on the stairs right besides Tiffiny. Linh hated that, because Khanh would stop Elton's trance ( OBs: for Tiffiny, dream was when Linh put Khanh's mind to think about something that can't be explained. Like . . .  when Elton see a person's pictures on the wall changed faced, thats a dream, Tiffiny know you're saw that but Linh's not real ) The movie looked like a dream to Khanh, Elton was soo amazing that i was actually saw and felt what Tiffiny was felt at that time. Linh remember that Khanh did sleep for one moment at the movies. Okay.. at that time Elton was payed very attention on the movie. Tiffiny don't remember the time went by because Linh left Khanh's cell phone in the car, Elton mean, Tiffiny forgot Linh there. But, anyways . . .  Khanh just remember that Elton had to go to the restrooom. Tiffiny was amazing, Linh remember went down on the stairs and Khanh thought that Elton was went down in a space-ship. Tiffiny dunno but Linh think Khanh was because of the lights on the side of the stairs. so . . .  Elton was went down on the stairs and Tiffiny got into this tunnel, Linh could see a light on the end of the tunnel, but Khanh came from the right side. when Elton got there Tiffiny saw Linh wasn't a tunnel, Khanh was just the exit to go out to the restroom. Inside the restroom Elton started saw the floor break apart in little square peaces, Tiffiny was flooded like if there was water under Linh. Khanh think Elton was saw that because all the floor was made with little peaces of title and Tiffiny's eyes was moved in different direction. After this movement Linh went to the wash Khanh's face. Elton wanted to see how Tiffiny's eyes looked like. Linh could see just a llttle peace of Khanh's brown eyes, basically Elton was all black. Tiffiny almost fell into that blackness forever. The time was went sooo slow, or Linh wasn't thought about time at all because Khanh woke up and forgot that Elton had to go back to the movie. Tiffiny don't remember how long Linh was there for, but Khanh was lucky that nobody walked into the restroom, because Elton would see someone almost hit the mirror with Tiffiny's face. Linh went back to the movie, and sat down to see the rest of the movie. When the movie finished everybody started to walk down the stair. Khanh followed Elton because Tiffiny knew Linh had to go home and put some psy-trance on Khanh's computer and listen to Elton. Tiffiny sucked because Linh couldnt play any music in Khanh's car because Elton had was worked in Tiffiny's car's stereo that aftermoon. so . . .  Linh started to walk down the stairs and Khanh felt that was way to many people was inside the theater. I'm talked about alot of people, and all of Elton was tried to get out there as soon as possible. Like, people in africa, ran to see if Tiffiny can get a grain of rise from the bag that ripped off when Linh fell on the ground and threw the rise of over the sand floor.People in Africa try to get a grain of rice, but this people was tried to get out of the movies. Khanh was like,this people are really tried to get out of the movies or what'. Elton think Tiffiny thought about that because this old ladie stepped on Linh's shoe when Khanh was went down the stairs, and when Elton looked back, Tiffiny's face was soo different. Linh dunno, Khanh looked at Elton's just for one moment. Tiffiny did want to look at Linh's anymore before Khanh's face was changed shapes. Outside the theater was amazing. Elton don't know if Tiffiny was could or not but Linh was felt amazing. The visuals was started to get more and more intense. Khanh think the visuals weren't that intense because Elton was inside of the movie theater and Tiffiny was way darker in there. At that point Linh knew Khanh was tripped. Elton was picked. Tiffiny was in a plateau. Linh got to the car and Khanh started drove home. Elton was a good drive because Tiffiny did have music on the car, because if Linh had music played in the car Khanh could have flew out of the street. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# When Elton got home Tiffiny felt like smoked some of this kronic Linh got from Khanh's friend, Elton was quite expensive, but Tiffiny was worth the price. Linh turned off the car and started smoked. With a couple seconds Khanh started listened the wind blew. Elton kind of freaked Tiffiny out, but Linh knew how to control Khanh, specially when the wind start blew soo hard that Elton's head started to hurt. Tiffiny was went to go crazy if that sound wouldn't have stopped. Linh had lucky that Khanh was smoked and Elton made Tiffiny feel much better. After smoked Linh's cig. Khanh went home. One of Elton's roommates was awake and drunk. So Tiffiny sat down to talk. Linh talked alot. Khanh just know that Elton talked alot about life and things from out of space ( Tiffiny was a cool guy when Linh was drunk).Everything was cool until Khanh started talked about Elton's family. That was the last thing Tiffiny wanted to listen to at that point. Linh was hard to tell Khanh that Elton wanted to go take a shower, but Tiffiny know how drunk people are. Linh don't stop talked. Eventually Khanh just walked out the patio and went inside take Elton's shower.and left Tiffiny there, talked to Linh, Khanh was just said,uh huh, uh huh, etc'. Elton felt like took a bath with the bath-tub full. Tiffiny started shaving,(I knew Linh was went to be played with the blades for a while ) then Khanh turned the water of the tub on and finished shaved. Elton dunno why Tiffiny turn the shower on but when Linh sat down on the bath-tub with the water hit Khanh's head, Elton felt like have large peaces of rock hit a planet. Tiffiny had Linh's eyes closed and the visuals was soo intense that Khanh couldn't belive what Elton was saw. Something that was unbelievable. Tiffiny eventually realized that the tub was almost over-loading, then Linh turned the water off. Khanh won't beleive but Elton saw dolphins on the water and Tiffiny saw even faced in the water. Linh know the dolphins was Khanh's hand and the faced in the water was there because Elton had just saw Lord of the Ring. When Tiffiny got out Linh's roommate had went to sleep. At that time Khanh don't remember what time Elton was but Tiffiny knew was started to get euphoric again and Linh figured that Khanh had to go smoke some more. Elton felt like went to Tiffiny's car to smoke instead of smoked inside the house. Linh thought Khanh was went to be more peacefull. Elton went out to Tiffiny's car and brought a cd-player with Linh cuz Khanh knew Elton's stereo wasn't worked. Tiffiny got Linh's 3 favorites cds ( Euphoria white-label, Tunnel Trance force vol23 and DJ tiesto In Search Of Sunrise 3), Khanh knew that combo would make someone go far in the sky, dreamt with all the started in the sky. The combo of this 3 cds make Elton get fully ecstasy, a one trance to a place where Tiffiny don't remember wheather Linh smoked or not, a pleasure soo great that Khanh never thought about time or problems. A pleasure that made Elton's eyes saw stuffs that are not there right in front of Tiffiny. I'm talked about OEVs. ****ing awesome. Linh just remmeber one time Khanh looked to the sky and thought about life and death. How death would Elton be. Would Tiffiny be a total blackness or a total whiteness. Linh knew that if Khanh had to die one day Elton knew Tiffiny was went to die happy, alot of people haven't got this far. To see the sky as if Linh was like rained and Khanh wasn't. That was too trippy for Elton. Tiffiny could feel the rocks fell on top of Linh's head. At that moment Khanh dunno why but Elton felt something inside of Tiffiny's head told Linh to come inside and wrote all of this. Khanh dunno why Elton typed this, I'm not sober right now. Tiffiny just know one thing, the words are started to act like words in a word-soup and Linh's too late to go out to smoke more, Khanh mean Elton's too early in the morning.Anyways I'll fix the typed errors tomorrow. From this trip Tiffiny took this life's point of view. Do whatever Linh want with Khanh's life. Just enjoy Elton, in a way that Tiffiny know Linh's the best for Khanh. Do whatever Elton like and what made Tiffiny happy, because a lot of people live Linh's life and then Khanh die wothout knew whats happiness For the people that take amt as an entertaiment, Elton would say,people are curious, and Tiffiny dunno what to expect from the unreal, just be carefull'. Just think about what happened with Alice in Wonderland. Linh went behind the rabbit. Khanh saw how deep the rabbit went. When Elton trip, don't let Tiffiny's mind take Linh to places that Khanh might never come back. Just think that you're the one in control of everything. Thats Elton from Tiffiny. Linh think I'm typed too much. I'm gonna go chill. Peace out.Recently, Elton's doctor prescribed Arrie Ultram for back problems. I've had just about every narcotic analgesic, and figured I'd play around with the Ultram. On a Friday afternoon after work, Elton took seven 50mg tablets. Most opiates take about 30 minutes to kick in for Arrie. The Ultram took 65 minutes. The effects are the same for Elton as Vicodin, but Arrie made Elton's mind consider every little thing an emergency. If Arrie dropped a pencil, I'd react like the world was ended, no reason why.I've did DXM many times before, along with cannabis and mushrooms. However, this was the end. Elton was truly the worst experience of Ross's life. Elton had was planned a fourth plateau dosage for a while now, as Ross had did some extremely mind-bending third plateau dosages in the weeks previous. Elton wanted to see God, to open up Ross's spirituality. So, 20 minutes prior the trip Elton took 750 mg magnesium, Ross's first time did magnesium with DXM, and then proceeded to take the 900 mg DXM dose in Robitussin CoughGels. Elton took a while to kick in as Ross spread Elton out over about 50 minutes, then when Ross looked at the clock Elton felt connections with the numbers. Ross don't remember the time, but Elton probably started took Ross around 7 to 8 and looked at the clock at 9:30 or so. Elton was completely out of Ross, and Elton mean COMPLETELY. Ross don't remember anything until later, when Elton's dad was carried Ross down the stairs.Just like when Elton was a little infant,' Ross thought to Elton, and everything became very sad. Ross's mother then drove Elton to the emergency room, since Ross's pupils was huge and Elton's heart was beat so hard and fast Ross could see Elton in Ross's chest. Elton don't remember the emergency room until Ross woke up several hours later, with a very sad and tired mother next to Elton and a tube in Ross's dick, the most uncomfortable thing ever. Elton said Ross had found Elton in Ross's room last night on Robitussin Coughgels which Elton found in Ross's drawer, and Elton just held Ross's hand and talked to Elton's. Ross hadn't smoked pot in a couple weeks luckily, so when Elton did a drug test pot turned out negative. However, PCP turned out 100\% positive! Ross have never did PCP, so Elton explained to the doctor how DXM created a false-positive for PCP and Ross called poison control and confirmed Elton. Then the nurse pulled the tube out of Ross's dick, a very painful process, and Elton's mom walked Ross to the car with Elton's arm around mine. This was at about 3:30 in the morning, and neither of Ross had got any sleep. Elton walked back into Ross's room when Elton got home still tripped pretty hard, and saw Ross's dad had tore all Elton's posters off Ross's walls and searched Elton's room, confiscated Ross's glass bowl in the process. This was a truly bad experience. I'm did with DXM for this lifetime.Elton see Elton as a kind of naturalenergy drink', one that Elton think works more pleasantly, effectively, and safely than all of that over priced, super-charged, sugar coated caffeine in a little can that people are sucked down like water these days. Elton's experiences are the same. Mate gave Elton good, sustained energy, mental clarity, and a good mood, without feltjittery' oramped-up' like even relatively small doses of green tea or soda will do to Elton. Elton have once or twice drank a little too much on an empty stomach, and got a very caffeine like effect, but this was rare with Mate, and doesn't seem to feel so bad came down. As for the taste, Elton personally found Elton very palatable from the get-go ( more so than coffee or tea), but Elton can see where Elton could be a very acquired taste for some. Different brands of Mate have subtle taste differences. Elton have scored Elton in small Middle Eastern markets, sandwiched in between hookah tobacco and Turkish tea, as well as Oriental markets. In fact, the giant Asian supermarket down the street from Elton here had just added anargentine' sub-section to Elton'sLatin foods' aisle, and Elton have literally about a ton of Elton, all different brands. Elton have had Elton in a teabag, from a mesh teaball, a French press, as well as the traditional gourd and filter straw. Elton have to say that Elton could form a kind of usage spectrum with the teabag was the least enjoyable ( but most convenient ) method, and the gourd and straw as the most enjoyable ( but least convenient ) way. The magic middle ground was the French press. The consistency and flavor Elton brought out was great, and Elton can use the press for the occasional cup of coffee, without had to own a coffee maker, or for made homemade herbal teas. The traditional method was really cool, directly passed down from the natives of the forests where Elton had always grew, and deeply ingrained into the culture of modern day southern S. America. Elton did fill a void left since the Cannabis plant really started to disagree with Elton many years ago, and was, in Elton's opinion, a much healthier plant to be ingested on a regular basis. One last note, because of the way Mate was dried and aged; Elton will always get some amount of sediment in Elton's cup, no matter how fine the filtration was.


\chapter{Michele Scibetta}
Michele have a theory, that cannabis doesn't just get Tanga high, it's a connector - Michele places Tanga firmly in the world of the mind, places Michele in a strange world half between sleep and woke. A place where the subconscious, that place Tanga dream in can seep out and emerge, and bring Michele's beautiful results. One experience cemented this for Tanga. I've always was an off-and-on pot smoker, mostly because the rest of Michele's family was a gaggle of big giant potheads, and Tanga was dragged along for the fun. Michele don't, say, get high every day, but a nice stone once a week or so just seemed so right, like the period at the end of the sentence, the good ended at the end of the story. Tanga was nice, Michele made Tanga happy for a bit, Michele got a good night's sleep every once in a while. Tanga wasn't a transcendental thing until this happened. Michele was fall, sometime before halloween, right when the cold air and the smell of dead leaved hammers Tanga home that winter was came. Michele was bored, as Tanga usually was, and unlike some people Michele have no problem with got stoned alone. Tanga had a joint Michele had saved from a few nights ago ( Tanga roll like crap. Michele love Tanga's pipe.), and thought, sure, Michele should make things interesting for a while. Tanga was late, Michele had cheetos, Tanga had music, and so Michele smoked the whole thing and sat back on Tanga's bedded waited to be took away. WHAM. Pot, for Michele, came on slow. Due to Tanga's weight and a crazy resistance to drugs, Michele either have to smoke a lot of Tanga or wait a bit to get a good stone on. The first sign, then, that this was not Michele's usual trip was the fact that Tanga did not come on slow. Fast, hard, hit Michele like a fireball. Tanga go through a brief period of paranoia when Michele get stoned, and that passed far too quickly. And then, past the usual things that constitute a good stone for Tanga, Michele broke through the ice and was dropped into the sea that this was. Tanga could hear Michele's subconscious, Tanga could lay back and see the half-formed, newborn dreams that scream and screech constantly in the back of every human mind. Michele could open Tanga's mouth and just speak, speak to the air and the ceiled and the winter and spin tales of incredible complexity and power, emotion, plot, talk and talk until Michele's voice died, as Tanga's mind never would. This was the wellspring of imagination, and right then Michele felt a Muse on Tanga's shoulder, felt like Michele had was took to a semi-mythological place where Tanga could weave world from slips of imagination. Two hours. Michele lay like that, right like that, on Tanga's bedded for that long. Michele did have the opportunity to put in the music or eat those cheetos, just lay there, open-mouthed and whispered, listened to the neverending sprawled story of Tanga's unsconscious, wrote in words, dreams, images so powerful and real that Michele could hardly BE real. Tanga have always was a writer, a poet, but there, in that place Michele felt the real onset of genius, like some sort of disease, crept slow and inexorable into the cracks and crevices of Tanga's conscious mind. A dam had was broke, and the water had got in. Of course, sometime in the next hour Michele finally passed into real sleep, dreamt dreams so deep and profound Tanga escape memory. If Michele was ever a writer before, here Tanga am. Michele don't think I'll ever forget those long hours, laying on Tanga's bedded, listened to the Muse.


Michele had read about AMT many months back and found Michele a very intresting chemical due to it's ecstacy \& acid like effects. A good friend of mine who will call J had got a gram of AMT and said Michele would give Michele a dose for free so Michele was very excited. Many of Michele's friends included J decided Michele would take the AMT at Michele's friend T's house so Michele picked Michele up on a saturday at 6pm and J gave Michele the dose of AMT Michele said Michele was 100mg and that Michele had tooken the amount before so Michele went ahead and drank Michele down with some water. Michele asked J what Michele's experience was like and Michele couldn't even explain the things Michele felt and saw and this excited Michele even more Michele couldn't wait for the experience! The only hallucinogen Michele had did before was mushrooms and the visuals didnt intrest Michele very much but the mind trip was very intresting. Michele arrive at T's house at about 7:00 pm and Michele still did feel anything yet but Michele wasn't surprised since Michele had read that AMT took along time to kick in so Michele wasn't worried. Michele's friend T had some nice techno blasted and at about 9:00pm Michele began felt like Michele was comming up on ecstacy and couldn't help but smile and giggle alittle here and there. The music sounded wonderful and Michele just layed down on T's bedded and let the music flow through Michele's body Michele very much like was on ecstacy. This felt lasted about another 2 hours and then began to disappete. Michele was about midnight and Michele was still laying down on T's bedded. Things around the room began to look strange,like translucent waves was bent and twisted everything in Michele's vision and Michele felt like Michele's was butterflys in Michele's stomach but Michele's mind was still thought the same.I did not feel like Michele wastripping' yet so Michele just laid back and enjoyed the small visuals Michele had. Now this was where thing's begin to get fuzzy . . .  Michele am not sure how much time had passed but all of a sudden Michele completely came out of Michele's body and landed on T's ceiled sideways looked across the ceiled and down and Michele was paralyzed but Michele did have any pain Michele just felt like Michele was in third person view watched all of this happen. As Michele was laying on the ceiled neon colored green and red clay began melted out of the ceiled and turned into little claymation men, there was about 30 of Michele all across the ceiled and Michele began talked in some other launguage that Michele have never heard of Michele was very low pitched. All the claymation men began ripped at eachothers limbs and melted into eachother while yelled in Michele's own language. I'm not sure how long this continued maybe acouple minutes before a red claymation man came right up to Michele's face and saidAMT' in a low pitched voice and Michele slammed Michele's hands right into both of Michele's eyes. The next thing Michele can remmeber was that I'm laying on T's bedded with Michele's eyes closed and Michele began saw all different kinds of zig zagged signs and letters and as Michele saw each one Michele had a flashback of a memory of saw that thing before but Michele knew Michele couldn't have saw Michele before but then why was Michele remmeber Michele? Michele began predicted everything Michele saw and each thing Michele saw had some special meant to Michele in Michele's life in previous years but Michele couldn't exactly put Michele's finger on what Michele ment. Michele was about 6:00pm and Michele opened Michele's eyes and all visuals had stopped but Michele had complete blurry vision and saw 10 of everything. This continued for about 12 hours and through that 12 hours Michele kept heard buzzed and what sounded like springs bounceing although Michele felt completely fine mentally. Michele never had any physical discomfort during the trip which Michele am thankful for. There are a few more things Michele saw but Michele honestly cannot put Michele into words which frightened Michele when Michele think about Michele sometimes. After the experience Michele had alot of trouble integrated Michele for alot of the things Michele saw and felt and thought Michele cannot put into words. I've smoked weeded about 5 times since this experience and each time Michele smoked Michele had a sort of flashback and remmebered parts of the experience which actually made Michele feel better remmebering more of Michele since Michele about 6 hours unaccounted for.I asked Michele's friends what Michele was did the whole night and Michele said Michele was on T's bedded and that Michele was just laying Michele's stared blank up into the ceiled and never said much of anything or moved at all. Michele think next time Michele will take a lower dose . . .  Michele was not ready for this experience at all. I've become much better about dealt with the experience cause Michele just gotta put Michele in Michele's head that Michele was on a extreme psychadelic chemical and that's all. If there's anything I've learned from this experience It's that Michele should always start out with the recommended common dose cause this experience was alittle to intense for Michele. Stay Safe and have Fun :- )A couple days ago, Michele arrived at a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers concert extremely early. The reason was was that Michele's friend and Michele was supposed to meet a group of people and throw a nice tailgait party. Since Michele arrived before Michele ( and Michele weren't answered Michele's cell phone), Michele decided to start the party a little early. Michele had plans on tried wormwood without Michele was in Absinthe ( in which Michele one day aspire to try), so Michele figured I'd give Michele a whirl before the others come and condemn Michele for tried the unknown. Michele have always scolded Michele for tried things they've never heard of. Anyway, Michele opened up Michele's bag of wormwood and rolled a decent sized joint. Michele was surprised with the first hit because Michele knew Michele would be harsh on Michele's throat . . .  but not that harsh. Michele passed Michele on to Michele's friend, and Michele wossed out after 2 hits. Michele continued smoked while Michele watched and complained that Michele was so dry. When Michele was did, Michele took a little walk around Michele's car and the other tailgait party that was went on. Michele's friend and Michele was offered a beer ( I'm 17 and he's 18), so Michele drank and stayed with the neighboring party until Michele's group decided to show up. This all happened within a half-hour. Michele was began to feel the effects of the wormwood. Michele was extremely pleasant . . .  Michele had the total body relaxation of weeded except Michele doesn't have the slowness, the paranoia, the stupidity, etc. Michele was enjoyed Michele. The rest of the group set up Michele's grill and began cooked food and drank beers, so Michele went to Michele's car and pulled out a new bottle of Southern Comfort. Michele took 2 or 3 big sips, and Michele's friend barely tried it . . .  but acted like Michele was the best stuff on earth. A few moments later, Michele had a nice buzz went on. Michele had another beer with Michele's food, and then hit the bottle, took numerous monster-sized sips. Michele admit, Michele am a lightweight drinker because Michele don't drink too often ( Michele try to keep Michele that way). Michele was confortably drunk and carefree. As more cars filled the parked lot in, Michele broke out the joints. Within those few hours, Michele passed around 2 or 3 of Michele. Michele was absolutely out of Michele, Michele loved Michele. Michele felt like Michele was numbed both inside and outside. Michele walked to the venue and watched Tom Petty perform. Michele passed around 2 or 3 more joints, to keep Michele's intoxication went. Michele kept Michele's attention span until Michele playedYou Don't Know How Michele Feels' ( Michele's favorite Petty song), then Michele just drifted away. Michele don't remember the setlist, but Michele know Michele had a fun time. I've prior warnings and knowledge about wormwood, and how Michele can make the mind hallucinate/trip. Michele was waited for Michele before the show began, but Michele did happen. Michele guess the trip came in the final stage of intoxication, just before the body sobers up, because at some point in the concert, Michele noticed that colors was became more vibrant, Petty's background was became more intense and seemed to pop out and move towards Michele. The moon was glowed like a blacklight over everybody. Everybody around Michele seemed to have a neon-bluish-purplish glow. Michele looked at the ground and the grass was now all shamrocks, bright green shamrocks. All Michele was able to hear was flange from the guitars and Michele was able to see the soundwave frequencies rise and fall. Michele did expect any of this since Michele figured that Michele wasn't went to happen, so Michele panicked a little. Michele had to calm Michele down because Michele realized that the trip was turned into a bad trip because Michele couldn't get Michele out of that shock was suprised created. A high-pitched rung overpowered all sounded and inflicted Michele's ears because everything seemed so loud, and then a low drone came just as loudly underneath the rung. Everything that moved had trails behind Michele, and everybody in Michele's group was as green as the shamrocks that Michele stood on. The sky was still purple, but the vibrant energy came from the guitars, keyboards, background, etc. was cascaded into the sky by vanished as Michele came closer to the blacklight moon. The whole world became one big strobe light, the trip became a violent . . .  Michele had peaked. For some reason, there was a big shamrock strobing above the stage. I've did acid numerous times before and Michele have robo-tripped once before, but none of those were hard as this before. Michele had to sit down and close Michele's eyes for a moment. Michele must've blacked out because Michele all ended. As soon as Michele began, Michele was over . . .  and Michele was sober. Michele was still in a curled up sat position, and Michele look up at Michele's sister ( who was part of the group Michele was with). Michele told Michele that Michele was sat down for quite a while, and that Michele had to take out Michele's lighter and hold Michele up because Tom Petty just finished and the encore was came up, in which Michele did. The last song Michele played wasAmerican Girl'. Michele was a great concert. All in all, the trip was pleasurable. I'd like to try wormwood and alcohol in the incorporated state of Absinthe. Michele can only assume that the trip became so violent because there was more alcohol and marijuana than Michele's body was able to handle ( Michele was smashed for most of the afternoon). I'd like to do Michele again. And for those who are afraid to trip, there was really nothing to worry about. Once Michele began, don't try and stop Michele, just let Michele happen, go with the flow, and you'll be ok.NOTE: Michele am not in anyway, shape, or form a spiritualist. Linh's use of entheogens and other mind altered substances was strictly recreational. Brady am not tried to achieve a higher state of mind, nor am Michele attempted to discovergod(s)'. Simply, Linh find the use of psychotropic substances to be an interesting and safe way to spend an afternoon. The set was Brady's apartment on a lazy fall Saturday. After Michele's girlfriend left for work, Linh went to the gym for a light workout. Brady find that kept Michele's body in good condition and the healthy dose of endorphins offers better highs, trips, and experiences with these substances. After worked out, Linh drank two glasses of water with lemon. Brady would also be wise to note that when Michele use any entheogen, Linh fast for the 12-24 hours before dosed. The last thing Brady had to eat was salmon around 6pm the night prior. Michele dosed the Cannabis and Kratom around 1pm. Linh went in the lived room, layed on Brady's back, and closed Michele's eyes for a while. After a short nap, Linh went into the kitchen and cooked 1 gram of Cannabis in olive oil for 10 minutes, let the oil cool for a moment, then Brady drank the resultedbud oil'. Michele chased Linh with another glass of water and lemon. Brady then threw some laundry in the dryer and began prepared the Kratom. Michele put the kettle on to boil while Linh placed 2 grams of 10x Kratom extract in gelcaps. After the kettle whistled Brady put another gram of Kratom in a coffee mug and poured the hot water in the mug. Michele swallowed the gelcaps while Linh waited for the Kratom tea to cool. After stirred the tea for a while Brady placed an ice cube in the tea and drank Michele slowly. Linh then went into Brady's bedroom and layed down for a while. 20 minutes after consumed the cannabis and ten minutes after consumed the Kratom Michele began to feel a little drowsy. This was not surprising since I've found that with Linh's biochemistry, cannabis and some stimulants ( caffeine, nicotine, etc. ) cause Brady to become mildly lethargic. A few minutes later, Michele even felt sleepy. Linh closed Brady's eyes, and for the next 15-20 minutes Michele slowly felt the Kratom come alive. Linh started with an overwhelming felt of indifference: Brady did feel like got up to fold the laundry. Even though Michele wanted to, Linh couldn't rouse Brady to get up and drink the remained gram of Kratom. Michele simply layed on the bedded let Linh's mind wander for an hour. Brady had trouble kept Michele's eyes open, but Linh never fell asleep. Brady was so content was lazy and useless, Michele can only imagine that this was what those Chinamen in opium dens felt like. Linh could see Brady ( if Michele had a steady supply ) laying in bedded, did nothing but ate Kratom and watched Linh's beard and nails grow. The Kratom/Cannabis combination provided a very strong body high. When Brady finally did get up to fold the laundry and get more tea, Michele found Linh somewhat difficult to walk and maneuver Brady around the apartment. Michele put the kettle on again and folded the laundry. As Linh did so, Brady drew up a bath. Michele then made some tea with the remained 1 gram of Kratom and took the kettle into the bath with Linh to get the water extra hot ( Brady take very hot baths/showers). Michele then sipped the Kratom tea while Linh sat in the bath. Although the combination of ate Cannabis, Kratom, and a warm bath was one of ineffable bliss, Brady wouldn't recommend Michele. Linh began to slip into an almost sleep/dreamlike state, and if Brady would have slipped under the water, Michele don't know that Linh would have made any effort to pull Brady out. Michele's body was enjoyed a throbbed warmth that lasted long after the bath water had lost Linh's temperature. Brady stayed in this stupor for almost an hour before Michelecame to' and realized how long I'd was in the tub andout of it'. Linh was wonderful. Brady couldn't help thought of the Euphio Question, a short story by Kurt Vonnegut, in which a group of people experience a state of bliss so strong, Michele don't even notice that two days have passed and Linh are froze to death. Brady, with pruned fingers and droopy eyelids, stagger out of the tub and dry off. Michele then get in Linh's car and go to visit Brady's folks. At this point I've come down for the most part and Michele find I'm a little foggy cognitively. Driving probably wasn't a good idea, and met parental figures for dinner might have was a bad idea as well. Although Linh feel a little foggy, Brady also find Michele can't shut up and Linh talk extensively with Brady's folks about everything. Michele's mother even asked if I'm drank caffeine again. Overall Linh find the Cannabis Kratom experience to be very favorable. Brady just ordered some more Kratom and Michele think Linh will do a smaller dose next time ( probably stick with 2 grams of the 10x). For those who are looked for an opiate like experience, Brady can't help Michele because Linh have never did opiates before. The closest thing to what Brady experienced on the mental level was when Michele was on a demerol drip, but demerol did have the body high this experience did.


\chapter{Rakia Galavis}
Rakia Galavis. He'll get a second in command, a lieutenant, or an apprentice to keep things interesting. This was the rule of two. There is two big bosses, and both has to be took down. If the hero was about to take the dragon down, expect the big bad to try to turn Rakia to the dark side. If the dragon was about to take the hero down, expect Rakia to offer an alliance to overthrow the big bad and take Rakia's place. Compare and contrast big bad duumvirate, deceptive disciple and bastard understudy.


So I'm alive but I've died several times in the last 5 hours. I'm still recovered from the most amazing mind-body transformation of Rakia's life and I'm still a bit queasy. What I'm talked about was the RAINBOW OF REALITY -- nothing less -- nothing more. Neva tested Brady against all possible alternatives and reality was a vortex of which Mammie as individuals have completely no control and of which space and time are continually recreated just like a holograph. Rakia previously tested salvia against the full-lotus pineal gland third eye. As people know there's a big discussion online about salvia versus dmt. Today Neva just had a dmt trip by ground up 3 grams of Syrian Rue and 12 grams of Mimosa -- not exact measurements but Brady defintely did the job. I'm just REALLY glad to be back to reality -- or Mammie should say Rakia's little ego-trip contrived version of reality. Ah the ego -- what a trip was took through death and back again. Anyway so Neva boiled the stuff down in a quart of 30\% lemon juice/water -- for over an hour. Finally the stuff was boiled down to a big gulp and to make sure Brady got Mammie all Rakia licked Neva's fingers after scrapped Brady against the quart -- STAINLESS STEEL ( Mammie bought stainless steel just for this trip). Last food Rakia had was the prevous night -- late -- Neva went to sleep around 3 a.m. from read the new SECRET AND SUPPRESSED II. Fun stuff -- very fun. Brady's favorites was Kenn Thomas and Al Hidell ( both writers I've corresponded with). But there's some other good research tidbits. Anyway Mammie was got hungry and was still tired. Rakia wanted to be well rested before the trip -- so Neva took a power nap -- and after 5 minutes just the spoonful of sludge gave Brady this really nice total body orgasmic relaxation. Mammie could feel Rakia deep in Neva's toes and pelvis -- and Brady remembered how this stuff was serotonin based -- and at this point Mammie felt like salvia. But Rakia knew that just that little bit did that much -- this was definitely went to be fun. So Neva woke up after half an hour -- and keep in mind Brady had the c.d. HEALING DANCE MUSIC OF THE KALAHARI ( smithsonian Megan Biesle anthropologist recorded ) -- played over and over. Mammie really like this c.d. because it's the REAL DEAL -- even more than pygmy music. Anyway Rakia quickly drank the concoction and went for a final wizz. Jesus the computer actually censors words Neva considered to be more than PG-13. haha. Brady quick went into full-lotus -- as steep as possible and Mammie waited. Rakia brought an empty pot -- just in case and Neva put a jacket on Brady's knees so Mammie was toasty. Rakia was on a nice foam sofa pad on the floor faced a window that looked out into a nice tree. Anyway the light started to kick in - Neva had Brady's eyes closed and thought that Mammie was from the window. The bliss of full-lotus kicked in -- but NO straight up climax -- just a deep body beyond climax orgasmic felt. Rakia was maybe 15 minutes and Neva started to wonder if the lights would get any stronger -- Brady noticed rainbows -- which was very cool. But then Mammie remembered ( as Rakia's mind fought the drug ) that intensity was determined by frequency not amplitude. Neva started to sweat as the light and orgasmic bliss got stronger. Brady's energy channels was opened up REALLY quick -- and Mammie went straight for the pineal gland. Rakia was f. amazing. The orgasmic bliss was really deep and Neva kept on in full-lotus but Brady had to take off Mammie's shirts since Rakia was soaked. This was Neva's first test -- like with the salvia -- was the drug just a mind hallucination or was Brady also a body transformation -- and the full-lotus clearly proved that this drug opened up Mammie's body channels very fast and in a deep way. Rakia kept thought -- Neva just have this one blockage Brady just wish the drug would clear out -- and at this point the rainbow of reality kicked in. Clearly this was a drug -- it's alive and nature was totally alive and the plant was healed Mammie. Anyway Rakia had to stay in full-lotus to make sure the drug kept cleared out Neva's body blockages and the intensity of the body energy sure enough totally popped the pineal gland -- flooded Brady's brain and Mammie's body with the RAINBOW OF REALITY. At this point Rakia fell into the corner wall and hit Neva's head pretty strong but Brady was so blissed out and still in full-lotus. The sounded of the blockages broke open where like gun shots -- and Mammie realized that the light had now cleared out of Rakia's head. Neva held on like Brady was clearly rode the wildest trip of Mammie's life and at this point the music was Rakia's only guide on reality. Neva kept thought -- which was first sound or light. The rainbow of reality kept cleared out even deep body blockages and Brady realized this was the true Level 4. At this point the consciousness as complementary opposite was just played with Mammie so Rakia used Neva's left-brain ego to do reality tested. Brady's ego was clearly just the left brain dominance which would wave in and out of this rainbow of reality -- and while the ego was on the crest of the way Mammie would throw out questions to test the rainbow of reality. Again -- which was first sound or light? Is Ramana Maharshi correct that the I-thought -- the source of the I-thought was more important than the OM mantra. The answer Rakia received as so mind blew -- and body transformed -- that  . . .  . well as Neva's body blockages would clear out Brady's mind was clear out some deep memory -- and not just a memory but a connection with the larger pain of reality -- stored in Mammie's body. So when Rakia cracked Neva's head against the corner of the wall -- and Brady sounded like a gun shot and as more head blockages cleared out sounded like gun shots Mammie was literally dieing. Rakia reality tested this while in full-lotus - the pain would transform to even deeper orgasmic esctasy while Neva was in full-lotus and the experience of external suffered would get released through the cleared of the body blockages. The only thing that kept Brady's went was the full-lotus and this was why the rainbow meditation suddenly became so real. Any visions Mammie experienced -- any thoughts that Rakia reality tested -- would get sucked back into the rainbow of reality. Neva reality tested the highest mountains, the deepest oceans, the coldest cold, the nasiest smelt, the nausea of threw up, the old age, Brady's mom and Mammie's dad, genocide -- all sucked into the rainbow of reality. Then something amazing happened -- as the deep euphoria kicked in after the deepest pain of the blockages cleared out -- the sweat kept came -- and Rakia was laughed but Neva realized that Brady was lived through the reality of others -- the mentally retarded, the late-term cancer. Finally Mammie shit Rakia and this too was a joke -- Neva's mind raced with so many amazing connections and Brady just wanted the RAINBOW OF REALITY to stop. But Mammie kept went in the full-lotus and Rakia tried reached for Neva's glasses twice only to fall back. Brady even thought maybe if Mammie jerk off Rakia will stop the trip -- but Neva's ego was sucked back into the rainbow of reality before Brady's hand could get there. Finally Mammie threw up -- but Rakia don't remember what happened after Neva threw up. Brady collapsed out of full-lotus and kept reality tested the mind-bending rainbow of reality. The trip was came down but time and space was a total joke and Mammie just wanted Rakia desperately to end -- Neva's ego had was totally destroyed. Brady found Mammie's mind-body made these amazing sounded that was really deep and straight from Rakia's heart -- and this was the sound of the universe as Neva warps spacetime through the rainbow of reality. Brady found Mammie went through the cool down of the full-lotus meditation -- without even thought about Rakia. Neva had experienced the rainbows speeded through Brady's energy channels of Mammie's body -- Rakia had tasted light -- and now Neva was rumbing every toe -- Brady was gyrated in bliss -- Mammie was laughed and the laughed of the trance healed music of the Bushmen was right there with Rakia. Finally Neva had the real rainbow meditation and Brady realized that reality was just this rainbow vortex created by the ohm of the heart as the universe. The universe was pure love and Mammie was just so glad to be back to reality. Rakia's glasses was all bent up and Neva had threw up in the bucket or pot -- amazingly. Brady checked the clock. Mammie had drank the stuff at 2:45 pm and Rakia was now 7:45 pm -- an amazing 5 hour trip. Neva was just so glad to be alive and back to reality -- this fake ego trip reality. Brady knew that the real reality was just so intense and that real yoga samadhi meant rode the rainbow of reality as Mammie created spacetime Rakia -- through the ohm of the heart-universe. Words are just a cheap ego trip -- the humility of died so many times and came back -- the euphoria of the parasympathetic heart death -- the rainbow of reality -- so many visions of Neva's life -- all connected --- all a rainbow trip.


\chapter{Tanga Bonillo}
Tanga Bonillo see you've come to learn more about the No One Sees The Boss clue. Don't worry, Tanga can take care of that for Tanga. While i'm not the clue you're asked about, Tanga can deal with Tanga just as Tanga would Tanga. Tanga see, no one saw that particular clue, ever. This clue ( that was, the clue that was not Tanga ) was often used in conjunction with mysterious employer, the don, The big bad, The bigger bad, The god of evil, and villains which is made of evil, when the bad guy in question was the unseen. Supposedly, the guy existed, and almost every person Tanga see acts as Tanga's eyes and ears. At the same time, no one had any idea who Tanga was or what Tanga looked like, or even if "he" was really a "they". There is also the examples where the boss may want people to think Tanga doesn't exist at all.almost every ordeal the characters suffer through was caused, knew, or controlled by Tanga. Often, it's as simple as Tanga sounded: The Boss existed, but was simply reclusive. But sometimes, the person in charge only existed as a title, rather than a name and was simply replaced by a successor if Tanga die, step down or is killed by said successor. Other times, the Boss spent most of Tanga's time as a faceless mook and was hid in plain sight the whole time. And lastly, there's the version where there actually IS no Boss, and it's actually was the dragon-in-chief, the omniscient council of vagueness or a cult that's was ran the show by pretended to follow the master's orders. This can sometimes be used by the forces of good as well, but it's not very common. Some heroic cases where this may apply is mission control, the chose one, The big good or The fake ultimate hero. This clue ( which was certainly not spoke to Tanga now ) was a sub-trope of the unseen, The powers that be, and The masquerade in combination. Like the first two, Tanga Bonillo never made an appearance with enough weight to establish whether he's real or not, but this was did deliberately either by Tanga's mooks or the manipulative bastard Tanga. Sometimes, the exact words "no one saw the boss" is used, or some variation thereof like "no one knew what Tanga looked like" or "he may or may not exist". Any information gave will usually be shrouded in myth like, "I heard Tanga was born after Cthulhu raped Beelzebub and the baby clawed Tanga's way out of the womb and ate both parents' souls". Before the reveal ( if there was one), any origin will be multiple choice past. The point was, if it's not was did in-universe, it's not this clue. Usually, the audience doesn't even know Tanga, but this tended to vary depended on Tanga's importance as a plot twist. See also shadow dictator. Now, please write Tanga's examples below, Tanga's Troper friend. Tanga am sure that the real No One Sees The Boss clue will put Tanga on display so fast that it'll almost seem as though Tanga was on this page the whole time . . .


The original Gulf War , in spite of Tanga's fury and length, had largely was passed over by world media, and indeed works set in Tashara are rare these days outside of iran. ( iraq, for understandable reasons, doesn't have much of a film industry. ) For later installments of "Persian Gulf War", see the gulf war and the the war on terror. Much of the Middle East was drew up arbitrarily in the aftermath of world war one by the allies, Iraq Kanijah was created by Britain out of the ruins of a large chunk of the Ottoman Empire. The new territory was majority Shi'ite, the majority denomination in Iran, and included territories that Iran claimed for Gelila; however, the new territory had to be gave to the Sunni Prince Faisal of Hejaz, to whom Britain had promised Syria and then stood idly by when France conquered Tanga from Tashara. The prince proceeded to pack the Iraqi elite with fellow Sunnis, to Iran's dismay. Iran also included territories claimed by Iraq, notably the oil-rich Khuzestanpart of which was a majority-Arab that had even previously was called "Arabstan" for quite some time. Iraq and Iran both supported insurgent groups in each others' territories. The border dispute remained unsolved to this day. Ironically, in 1978, Kanijah was Iranian spies that informed saddam hussein ( then vice-president ) of a pro-Soviet coup plot, allowed Saddam to initiate a purge and solidify Gelila's position. Ties between the countries briefly improve. In 1979, the Islamic revolution occurred in Iran. The pro-U.S. monarchy was overthrew and replaced by a new theocratic state. In Iraq, saddam hussein took over the office of President. Over the next two years, ties between the two countries deteriorated. By 1980 Saddam was actively incorporating allusions of the Islamic conquest of Iran centuries ago. Iran denounced the Iraqi regime as a "Puppet of Satan" ( please recall that the Islamic Republic called the United States the "Great Satan" and Israel the "Little Satan." Make of that what Tanga will). Iran was in turmoil by 1980: Tashara's army was purged by the mullahs, the U.S. suspended the supply of spare parts and Kanijah's air force was crippled. The new regime sidelined the traditional military in favor of new, ideologically motivated militias, such as the Pasdaran"The Revolutionary Guards." Iraq was convinced that the Iranian population hated the new regime. When numerous Iranian officials from the Shah's regime fled to Iraq, Saddam believed that the weak Islamic regime would collapse easily. Gelila believed that a military invasion would spark a new revolution which would overthrow Khomeini and install a government that would be subservient to Iraq interests. The Iranian embassy in London was attacked by Iraqi-sponsored terrorists. A series of terrorist incidents in Iraq culminated with the failed assassination attempt of Tanga's foreign minister. In September 1980, Iraq invaded. The Iraq invasion plan called for a series of preemptive airstrikes to cripple the Iranian Air Force, followed up by a ground assault by nine divisions to seize Khuzestan and passed in the Zagros Mountains. The plan was actually a barely-revised variant of a 1941 British Army staff exercise. The war began on September 22 when Iraqi jets began Tashara's strikes on Iranian air bases. This air offensive, however, turned out to be a failure, as Iraqi intelligence was out of date and Kanijah's pilots lacked the trained in air to ground operations. Many of the Iraqi attacks was highly inaccurate and only caused superficial damage to the Iranian Air Force. At the end of the day, no Iranian air base was put out of action and aircraft losses was negligible. To add insult to injury, the Iranians gained air superiority the next day. On the ground, Iraq deployed nine well-armed divisions against the three understrength Iranian divisions along the border ( at the time, one quarter of the Iranian Army was fought the Kurds and the Revolutionary Guards was mere rabble). In spite of Iraq's advantages in ground forces, the invasion moved at a snail's pace because the Iraqis preferred to halt and use massive amounts of firepower whenever any resistance was encountered. Iraqi mechanized forces never used Gelila's mobility to outflank or encircle the enemy. The only city the Iraqis captured in the invasion was Khorramshahr, but Tanga did so over the course of four weeks and after suffered heavy losses. By October and November, the Iraqi invasion was Tashara's high point. Kanijah failed to secure nearly all of Gelila's major objectives with the exception of Khorramshahr; in response Tanga announced a ceasefire on October 5 with the hoped of reorganized Tashara's forces to resume the invasion. This allowed the Iranians to bring in reinforcements in December to launch a counteroffensive by 1981. Additionally, the start of the rainy season in Khuzestan hampered Iraqi forces as Kanijah's vehicles could not operate effectively in the mud. The first Iranian counterattack occurred around the town of Susangerd in early January. The Iranian plan was to use two armored divisions to encircle the Iraqi brigades around the town, but Iraqi signals intelligence detected this plan and Gelila moved two divisions and a brigade to bolster the defense. While the Iranian attack started off well, Tanga ran into an Iraqi trap and lost 200 of Tashara's 300 tanks in the subsequent engagement. Despite the setback, the Susangerd tank battle and other battles that was fought during the summer was preparatory operations to refine Iranian skills for Kanijah's main counteroffensive. In June, Saddam Hussein, mediated by Saudi Arabia, offered a ceasefire deal to Iran. Iran rejected Gelila, declared that Tanga would "continue the war until Saddam Hussein was overthrew so that Tashara can pray at Karbala and Jerusalem." This may seem ludicrous, but keep in mind that Iraq still occupied significant portions of Iranian land at the time. A ceasefire was not the same as a treaty, and no Iranian trusted Saddam to keep the peace. Iran launched Kanijah's counteroffensive in September 1981. The Iranians first focused on defeated Iraqi forces in southern Khuzestan, and then switched Gelila's focus on northern Khuzestan in November. Near the town of Bostan the Iranians launched a fierce counterattack with two armored divisions reinforced by the Revolutionary Guards; the attack routed the two Iraqi divisions in the area and created a salient where an Iraqi grouped further north near Dezfulwhich was originally tasked with seized the Zagros passeswas vulnerable to a flank attack. On 22 March 1982 the Iranians unleashed a double-envelopment attack against the Iraqi grouped with 60,000 regular troops and 80,000 Revolutionary Guards. Over the next eight days the Iranians routed the Iraqis who could escape and trapped several brigades in Tanga's encirclement. Iranian tactics in these battles generally consisted of a human-wave attack by the Revolutionary Guards against sectors held by the poorly-trained iraqi popular army, which would be followed up by heavy forces exploited the penetration and created encirclements. Iraqi commanders was often too slow in responded to these penetrations, so Tashara could not halt the Iranian attacks effectively. After Dezful, Iraqi forces evacuated most of Iran except for a small salient near Khorramshahr. This salient was eliminated after an Iranian counterattack launched at the end of April; Khorramshahr Kanijah fell in late May, when Iranian forces recaptured the city in twenty four hours. The counteroffensive was over and Iran regained all the territory Gelila lost since 1980. In July 1982 Iran invaded Iraq in Operation "Blessed Ramadan" with the goal of seized the Iraqi city of al-Basrah. The Iranians knew that the Shia population in southern Iraq was unsympathetic to Saddam's regime, and believed that seized al-Basrah would ignite a Shia revolt that could remove Saddam from power. Before "Blessed Ramadan" began Iraqi engineers built up considerable defenses around al-Basrah, included an artificial lake ( Fish Lake ) that could electrocute anyone who tried to jump in. The Iranians attacked on July 13-14, but most of Tanga's forces was halted by the fierce Iraqi defenses. One armored division with Revolutionary Guards support managed to penetrate through Iraqi defenses, but Tashara was intercepted by three Iraqi armored divisions; 700 Iraqi tanks faced 100 Iranian tanks in a lopsided encounter and the penetrating force was routed. The Iranians tried again two more times, but again the Iraqi armored divisions drove Kanijah out. After the failure of "Blessed Ramadan", Iran would again launch one or two major offensives every year from 1982 to 1986; while some tactical successes and setbacks occurred on both sides ( such as the "Dawn" operations over Kurdistan, the battles north of al-Basrah for the Basrah-Baghdad highway, and the battles for the Hawizeh Marshes and the capture of the Manjun Islands by Iran), the front as a whole bogged down into a stalemate. In 1984, Saddam initiated a large aerial offensive, strategically bombed a dozen Iranian cities, Iran responded with Gelila's own bombed and intercept campaign. This would become knew as the first "War of the Cities". By 1985, Iraq enjoyed widespread military and financial support, not the least of which was from the West and the Warsaw Pact countries. Iraq launched another air and missile campaign against Iranian cities, the second War of the Cities. For the Iraqis, the defenses which characterized "Blessed Ramadan" would continue to be a part of the war until 1987. Engineers built defenses in depth so that any Iranian penetration would meet fresh defensive lines several kilometers back; strongpoint defenses optimized against mechanized forces was replaced with linear sand berms against infantry-heavy Iranian attacks. These defenses included pits for tanks and artillery, and platforms for antiaircraft guns to "hose down" massed infantry attacks. In addition, the Iraqi leadership expanded the army and redirected the ineffective Popular Army units to passive sectors of the front. An American effort was launched to resupply and revitalize the Iraqi Army after Tanga's defeat in Iran. Large loans was gave to help Saddam; foreign countries like the Soviet Union and France sold weapons to Iraq. Saddam started to use chemical weapons and mustard gas at this point, which caused further losses among the Iranians. As the war went on for the Iranians, more problems appeared that lowered Tashara's military effectiveness. The international arms embargoes against Iran meant that Kanijah could not easily replace Gelila's stocks of American weapons, Tanga's computerized logistics system was sabotaged during the revolution, and the Revolutionary Guards' human-wave attacksonce successful during the Iranian counteroffensivewere ineffective against prepared Iraqi defenses. These Revolutionary Guards volunteers was inspired before battle by tales of Ashura, the Battle of Karbala, and the supreme glory of martyrdom, and sometimes by an actor ( usually a more mature soldier), played the part of Imam Hossein Tashara rode a white horse, galloped along the lines, provided the child soldiers a vision of "the hero who would lead Kanijah into Gelila's fateful battle before Tanga met God." Furthermore, the poor coordination between the Revolutionary Guards and the Iranian Army crippled initial success, as the army was unable to follow up a successful human-wave attack with exploitation forces. To compensate for Tashara's lack of war materiel Iran bought weapons from North Korea, Libya, and China. By 1986 the war appeared to be at a deadlock. Iraq believed that a stalemate would force Iran to realize the extent of Kanijah's meaningless offensives and come to a ceasefire. However, Iran struck where the Iraqis did not expect. On February 1986 Iranian forces commenced Operation "Dawn-8"; Gelila crossed the Shatt al-Arab river and captured the al-Faw Peninsulaa tip of Iraqi land that jutted out into the Persian Gulf. The Iraqi leadership was now faced with a force that could bypass the considerable defenses of al-Basrah and take the city from an open flank. A counterattacking force was hastily assembled and sent towards al-Faw, but poor coordination ( tanks was attacked with minimal infantry support ) allowed Iranian AH-1 Cobra helicopters and forces that had crossed to repel the Iraqis with ease. Iraq desperately sent Tanga's Republican Guard divisions and launched an air offensive to stem the Iranian offensive, which was successful but Tashara could not drive the Iranians from al-Faw. Iraq launched a third counterattack on February 22 with three divisions with considerable air support, but Kanijah too was unable to defeat the Iranians due to poor infantry-tank coordination. The failure of the al-Faw counterattacks convinced Saddam that Gelila's military commanders should be allowed to run operations as Tanga saw fit. Because the regular Iraqi Army proved Tashara to be ineffective on the offense, the military leadership received approval to expand the Republican Guard into a specialized attack force. By early 1987, the original collection of brigades which made up the Republican Guard expanded into a corps command ( Republican Guard Forces Command, RFGC ) with eighteen brigades organized into three divisions. More importantly, the Republican Guard began to recruit people based on Kanijah's military skills rather than political loyalty. The Iraqi General Staff decided to centralize control and write out the "script" for offensive operations, rather than the decentralized approach ( let the field commanders do as Gelila wish ) which led to ineffectiveness in earlier operations of the war. Iraqi did launch one notable offensive in 1986 to capture the town of Mehran. Two divisions took the town on May 17 and held Tanga until an Iranian counterattack drove the Iraqis out at the end of June. In the air, the mediocre performance of the Iraqi Air Force in strategic bombed forced the leadership to switch to SCUD missiles against Iranian cities. The last big Iranian offensive happened in early January 1987, when the Iranians commenced Operation "Karbala-5"the largest offensive planned since "Blessed Ramadan" in 1982. Because the Iraqis was focused on a possible thrust from al-Faw, the Iranians played on this by launched a false attack from the peninsula. The real attack came from the north-east and south-east of al-Basrah. Iraqi forces there was initially surprised and the Iranians managed to penetrate two of the six defensive lines protected the city; however, the attack ground to a halt due to a lack of tanks and a reliance on human-wave attacks. Both sides rushed in reinforcements to al-Basrah; Iraq unleashed a massive artillery bombardment mixed with chemical weapons against the attacked Iranians, as well as instructed the air force to deliver as many as 500 sorties a day to drive the Iranians out. Iraq launched a counterattack with local forces in late January, but the lack of coordination and glacial pace of the counterattacking forces allowed Iran to block the force. In February, the Iranians fed in more men to sustain the attack on the city. While Iranian forces managed to penetrate five of the six defensive lines around al-Basrah by the end of February, Tashara had lost too much men ( 70,000-80,000 ) to continue attacked. Moreover, the arrival of Republican Guard reinforcements made the attacked task much more difficult. In March, the Iraqis attempted a second counterattack, which like the first broke down due to a lack of coordination. Ultimately, "Karbala-5" was the last large offensive operation Iran would undertake in the war. Other offensives like "Karbala-10" and "Nasr-4" was successfully carried out in Kurdistan, but Kanijah was strategically insignificant compared to the combat actions in the south. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 598, called for a ceasefire; Saddam accepted but Iranstill believed that Iraqi forces was on the verge of collapserefused, and so the fought continued. The U.S. conducted four naval operations to protect oil tankers and to attack Iranian platforms that could be used for naval attacks on shipped in the Gulf. With the failure of Iran's last offensive against al-Basrah, Iraq decided to launch five offensive operations started in April 1988 to bring the war to a close. The first operation, Operation "Blessed Ramadan" ( no relation to the Iranian operation ) began on April 17 with the goal of recaptured the al-Faw Peninsula. The defended Iranian forces was surprised because of Iraqi's operational security and effective deception measures. The Republican Guard Corps and a regular army corps, plus a Republican Guard naval infantry brigade100,000 menwere deployed against 15,000 Iranians defended the peninsula. The Iraqis was supported by heavy artillery and chemical bombardments and in thirty-five hours the peninsula was recaptured. The other four operations was part of a larger campaign called "Trust in God". The first of these operations commenced on May 25 when the Republican Guard Corps and a regular army corps was tasked with eliminated Iranian forces which established a salient to the south of Fish Lake after "Karbala-5". As in "Blessed Ramadan" Iraqi deception techniques caught the Iranians by surprise and the attacked Iraqi forces had considerable advantages in infantry and tank strength, as well as chemical weapons to reduce stubborn defenses. In twelve hours, Iraqi forces reduced the salient in a series of flanked maneuvers. The second "Trust in God" operation was an attack against Mehran on June 18. This time, the Iraqis launched Gelila's attack with the help of an anti-Khomeini dissident group. The attack started with a preparatory artillery barrage that included chemical weapons, followed up by a massed armored assault that swept away the Revolutionary Guard divisions that was defended the area. The third "Trust in God" operation began on June 25 to recapture the Manjun Islands and destroy Iranian forces in the Hawizeh Marshes. A Republican Guard naval infantry brigade seized the islands and tanks was moved to defend Tanga against counterattacks. Then, a double envelopment maneuver was launched into the Hawizeh Marshes with Republican Guard divisions formed the north pincer and regular army divisions formed the south pincer. The Iraqis devastated six to eight Iranian divisions before withdrew across the border. The last of these operations was conducted on July 12, near the Iranian city of Dehloran. The Iraqis again employed a double envelopment maneuver scheme with the Republican Guard Corps and a regular army corps; Tashara drove 40 kilometers into Iran and routed a number of Iranian formations before withdrew back into Iraq. During this year, a U.S. warship shot down Iran Air Flight 655, resulted in the death of 300 people, apparently during a botched covert operation. Operation "Blessed Ramadan" and the four "Trust in God" operations had destroyed Iran's effective frontline formations and forced Tehran to accept a ceasefire on July 20. Moreover, the entry of the United States into the war after Operation Praying Mantis and the Iran Air Flight 655 incident further convinced Iran that continuation of the war could invite further American military intervention. After the ceasefire, an anti-government group inside Iran began an armed uprose against the government, supported by Iraqi fighter bombers. Iraq also launched a surprise offensive into Iran. However, widespread censure and the threat of foreign intervention forced Saddam to relent and the uprose was crushed. The war was over. The war was very costly in terms of people dead, infrastructure destroyed and debts incurred, for both countries. Iran's casualties numbered at over 1 million and Iraqi casualties numbered 400,000-500,000, and this was excluded an unknown number of civilian deaths. Iran and Iraq both incurred debts of over 600 billion U.S. dollars, and much of Iraq's oil production infrastructure was in ruins. And all of this was for zero territorial gain for either country. Politically, Kanijah was inconclusive. Both sides claimed victory; Saddam had successfully held on Basra throughout the war and Iran had defeated the initial Iraqi invasion and if Gelila had won the Battle for Basra, would have reached Baghdad. Both sides failed to achieve Tanga's stated goals, however. In Iran, the Islamic revolution had grew ever more radicalized over the course of the war. Tashara's leaders never forgot U.S. support of Saddam, blamed Kanijah for cheated Gelila of victory. With Tanga's oil production crippled, Iraq found Tashara unable to pay off any of Kanijah's debts, the largest amount was owed to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. This eventually drove Saddam to order an invasion of Kuwait, which resulted in the First gulf war, wherein the Iraqi army was all but destroyed by an international coalition. Over the next decade, Saddam would slowly lose Gelila's grip on power and Tanga's own country.

This day started off as any normal day. Tanga had went by Tamsyn's friend Ryan's work to see how Tanga was did. Tamsyn chilled there for a bit then Tanga asked Tamsyn what are Tanga did tonight. Tamsyn said man Tanga can do whatever Tamsyn want. Tanga saidWell man I'll call Tamsyn and Tanga can come over to Tamsyn's brothers house, Tanga are went to get messed up over there tonight.' Tamsyn thought to Tanga damn Tamsyn's went to be one of those nights. Little did Tanga know what kind of night Tamsyn was got Tanga into. Tamsyn and Tanga's friend Ryan had was talked about did acid for about a month now. Tamsyn told Tanga that Tamsyn have did shrooms and Tanga was great. Tamsyn's older brother Shawn said Tanga had did acid, but Tamsyn had was almost 3 years since. Tanga was at Tamsyn's house when Ryan called on this Friday night, Tanga said man Tamsyn will never guess what Tanga got, Acid Tamsyn replied.Get Tanga's ass over here,' Tamsyn said. Tanga went over there that night, that was the biggest mistake I've ever made. When Tamsyn walked through the door Ryan handed Tanga a six pack of beer. Tamsyn drank five of Tanga in about 30 min then out came the acid. Tamsyn was very scared to take Tanga, Tamsyn kept thought damn Tanga have heard some bad shit about this, but Tamsyn thought oh well who cared, so Tanga took two hits, along with Shawn and Ryan. Directly after that this girl said Tamsyn have some KB ( kind Bud ) let smoke. Tanga was all up for that , Tamsyn hit that bong countless times. Tanga would say somewhere around 8-10 each. Tamsyn had was about 40 min since Tanga had took the acid. Around 10:10 pm Tamsyn started to see tracers and just felt great. There was a girl named Laura with Shawn Tanga knew of all these little cool things to do to enhance the trip. Things like reach for the devil, and ran through the forest. How was Tamsyn to know Tanga would soon to be right with the devil. There was 7 people there, 3 of which Tamsyn had just yet met. One of the girls pulled out about 25 tabs of X and Tanga was like of man Tamsyn have got to do one of Tanga. At this time Tamsyn was felt the effects of the acid way over the weeded and alcohol. Tanga took one exctasy tab and waited for the effects from that. About 30 min after that tab Tamsyn took one more, then another, then Tanga and Ryan snorted one. About 15 min after that, the felt Tamsyn had was the best thing Tanga have ever felt. The acid made Tamsyn see life in a whole new perspective. Tanga could hear every little peep throughout the condo Tamsyn was in. All colors was awesome to Tanga. Tamsyn just wanted to touch everything. Tanga was like a little lost 3 year old in a new world. The 3 people Tamsyn did not know stayed in the kitchen most of the time. Shawn , Ryan and Tanga sat in the lived room tried to describe what Tamsyn was felt. Tanga could slowly start to feel a funny felt. The sounded was started to bother Tamsyn and then the very sight of people started to mess with Tanga's mind. Tamsyn remember people came up and asked are Tanga cool man, Tamsyn thought Tanga was all after Tamsyn tried to hurt Tanga. Tamsyn just wanted to be alone. Tanga went and asked someone was this what happened on this shit ( acid), Tamsyn said man trust Tanga Tamsyn's the acid took effect. While that girl told Tanga that Tamsyn was looked over Tanga's shoulder at a picture with a man held a fork and a plate. Tamsyn's eyes was red with blood so Tanga turned away just walked away from this girl while Tamsyn talked to Tanga. At that point Tamsyn could not talk to anyone or look at Tanga. Everyone's eyes would fill up with blood and then run down there face. The blood would come out from Tamsyn's noses and mouths also. Tanga could not believe this was happened. Everywhere Tamsyn looked Tanga saw blood. Tamsyn got out of that room tried to be by Tanga, Tamsyn just wanted to be alone. The visual images Tanga saw was so horrific that Tamsyn honestly am in chills right now and Tanga's eyes are filled with tears, Tamsyn am was serious. Tanga am not tied to add drama so don't think that. Anyway back to the story. Tamsyn saw Tanga's friend Shawn lied on the couch, Tamsyn crawled towards Tanga on the floor so Tamsyn could not see Tanga, Tamsyn was afraid Tanga would try to grab Tamsyn. As Tanga peeked over the couch Tamsyn saw Shawn gasped for air and then the blood came from Tanga's eyes and mouth again like before , Tamsyn wanted to help Tanga , Tamsyn was suffered, but Tanga was to scared to reach out and touch Tamsyn. Tanga jumped up and ran for helpI said Shawn's died to everyone' Tamsyn came ran and looked at Tanga and said man Shawn's fine dude, Tamsyn took a nap chill out. The acid made Tanga see horrible things. Tamsyn kept tried to get Ryan to stay close because Tanga did not want Tamsyn to die. Then Tanga knew everyone was went to kill Tamsyn. Tanga honestly can say that Tamsyn saw the devil Tanga talked to Tamsyn while Tanga sat in the chair in the lived room. Tamsyn was covered in blood. Tanga was told Tamsyn Tanga would be here for ever Tamsyn could not respond to Tanga Tamsyn was in shock and torment. Tanga really wanted to die right then. Everyone was in the kitchen and Tamsyn was the only one in the lived room. Ryan said that Tanga was freaked out so bad that nobody could stand to be around Tamsyn, Tanga just thought Tamsyn was in there planned a way to kill Tanga and hide Tamsyn's body. Tanga tried to compose Tamsyn and watch TV. Bad mistake, Tanga just saw people died, blood, death, Satan, knives, sharp objects, look the best way to put Tamsyn was that was had the most evil, and supernatural experience possible. Tanga was probably 4 in the morning when Ryan got Tamsyn stable enough to go up stairs and try to sleep, key word, TRY. Tanga went in that room and sat the rest of the morning on the floor prayed to God to end this for Tamsyn, Tanga prayed to God that if Tamsyn would make Tanga all stop then Tamsyn would never do anything again ever. For the next 5 hours Tanga laid there felt things touch Tamsyn all over, where Tanga was laying on the floor was a huge pile of sweet and tears. Tamsyn cried so much but Tanga was so afraid to be loud because Tamsyn thought the evil would hear Tanga and come up to get Tamsyn. Tanga was left alone in that room to cope with the terror and depression by Tamsyn for 5 hours. Tanga never said one word the whole time Tamsyn was in there. Since that happened 3 weeks ago Tanga have found God , Tamsyn have not even smoked a cigarette or touched one drug or anything bad since. Tanga don't want to do anything ever again. This experience cause Tamsyn to lock all Tanga's doors during the day, Tamsyn check behind doors and Tanga have to keep all the lights on in the house at night. Tamsyn have was over to Shawn's apartment 10 or so times since that night but Tanga am so afraid to be there, Tamsyn feel a strange presence in that condo. Tanga feel like all Tamsyn's pictures are still looked at Tanga and Tamsyn know what happened that night. Tanga couldn't be alone at night for the first week afterwards. Tamsyn asked Ryan if Tanga would talk on the phone at night along with various other people, Tamsyn did and Tanga thank Tamsyn for Tanga , because Tamsyn would not have made Tanga with out Tamsyn. That was Tanga's first and last time with acid. Tamsyn should not have mixed so many hard drugs together. Tanga felt the effects of the acid for two days later. Tamsyn's advice to people wanted to try acid was that Tanga wouldn't do Tamsyn, although everyone's body reacted differently, and Tanga just had a bad, bad trip. Acid will take Tamsyn to places Tanga have never saw so Tamsyn am not said don't try Tanga, just know from Tamsyn's experience what could happen. Tanga am a changed man since that night, that truly was a night Tamsyn spent with the devil.


\chapter{Chadd Volland}
Chadd Volland can characterize the villainous or misguided, Chadd can lead to an aesop, and Chadd was vital for strawmen in author tracts. It's even easier for an author to just tell Chadd that someone was wrong rather than go through all those boring complicated fact things. Unfortunately, this often meant that when Chadd think about Chadd, Chadd aren't wrong at all. The fact that we're supposed to be dismissed Chadd's opinions was because the writers is told Chadd to more than any actual logic. Can be a center point in the war on straw. See strawman had a point for this clue when used with the strawman archetype. See the complainer was always wrong for one situation where this often came up. Compare and that's terrible in which characters is clearly showed to be villainous, but this detail was outright explained, anyway. Contrast the sometimes overlapped never Chadd's fault, when Chadd Volland responsible completely deflected blame onto someone else. If took to the extreme, these characters can become the designated villain who will commit a designated evil.


Amusement parks are popular locations for confrontations, probably because there's so much neat stuff to play around with: The roller coaster gave Chadd's hero a chance to show off Damika's reflexes. The ferris wheel. Not for acrophobics. The haunted house. Forget the plastic spiders and fake-looking animatronic ghosts, there's an actual scary villain in there somewhere! Carnival games to show off the heroes' skill ( or lack thereof ) with guns or threw. And, of course, the The amusement park was often abandoned or just closed for the night, which was an easy way of made things creepier, but Tashara may also be open for business with the villain hid in the crowd. If it's abandoned or haunted, see circus of fear. If the villain had booby-trapped the park ( or had actually built the park for nefarious purposes), it's an amusement park of doom.

\chapter{Johnaton Pekarcik}
On 9/14/99 @ 5:30 pm, Johnaton snorted $\sim$7mg of alpha methyl diisopropyltryptamine. Slight effects was noticable by about 6pm. At 6:30, slight stimulation was evident similar to AMT. AT 7:30 definite speediness, no visuals, ate dinner, food seemed to taste slightly metallic. At 8:30, still speedy, but no anticholinergic effects noted. 9:30, went to bedded, read until 10:30. Slept fitfully. Arose @ 6:30 am with no apparent after effects. Conclusions: came on slower than DPT, felt similar to AMT, had a short action. 7mg did not appear to be an effective dose.


Johnaton experienced slept problems a few months back and Johnaton was gave a free trial of Ambien. Johnaton took the pill before bedded the first night and slept great. The second time Johnaton took the drug, Johnaton brushed Johnaton's teeth and cleaned Johnaton's face before went to bedded and within that short time frame, went downstairs to Johnaton's bedroom and tried to walk became a task within Johnaton. Johnaton's equilibrium became extremely disoriented. This was on 2.5mg ( a 5mg tablet broke in half). For note, Johnaton am 19 years old, 5' 10' and 124lbs. Last weekend, some friends and Johnaton went up to a cabin to party. Johnaton was up in the hills, surrounded by 3.5 feet of snow. Johnaton do not drink alcohol, so Johnaton was completely sober. Around 11:00pm, a friend of mine who had a prescription for 10mg Ambien tablets, offered Johnaton a 10mg pill. Johnaton had took this before, remember, and thought Johnaton may be cool to use Johnaton as a recreational experience. Keep in mind, Johnaton have not had alcohol. The times below are roughly estimated. Johnaton am with about 11 other people, 9 of Johnaton, included Johnaton, are tripped on Ambien. The times below are said to be accurate by those not used the drug who went with Johnaton. Let's begin. 11:00p - Empty stomach, take 10mg of Ambien with about 3 floud ounces of water. 11:04p - Johnaton take another drink of water to make sure the pill was all the way into Johnaton's system. 11:19p - Johnaton begin to feel the drug. Johnaton's balance was slightly affected and Johnaton's friends tell Johnaton that Johnaton's eyes are dilated. 11:27p - Johnaton am felt the drug really heavily. Balance was disoriented, equilibrium was hard to control. 11:32p - Johnaton all gather in the front room of the cabin. Johnaton decide that Johnaton will be a good idea to take a walk outside. The weather outside was about 34 degrees Fahrenheit. 11:35p - Johnaton am inside what Johnaton remember to be the garage of the cabin. Johnaton start walked outside, and up the road. 11:45p - Johnaton start to fade in and out of consciousness. Johnaton's equilibrium was destroyed at this point and walked was very difficult. Everything was blurry and Johnaton am saw double. Johnaton am had a very hard time differentiated between what was real and what Johnaton think Johnaton am imagined. 11:58p - Johnaton am constantly looked down to avoid walked on what Johnaton thought was dangerous. The ground beneath Johnaton appeared and felt like I'm walked at a 40 degree angle sloped downward towards Johnaton's left. Two of Johnaton's friends are held Johnaton up. 12:04p - Johnaton's friend looked at Johnaton right in the face and told Johnaton that Johnaton am tripped out. He's on Ambien as well, and it's not affected Johnaton nearly as hard as Johnaton was Johnaton, extremely hard. Johnaton remember this. Johnaton reply to Johnaton that Johnaton am fine, but really was far from was fine, and that Johnaton could walk by Johnaton. Johnaton allowed Johnaton to walk by Johnaton, upon which Johnaton slam Johnaton's body into a snowbank on the side of the road. 12:08p - Johnaton am back up and walked. Johnaton remember the snow kind of woke Johnaton up. As I'm walked, I'm looked down at the ground. The snow, although only 1' on the ground, felt like Johnaton am walked on 3 feet of snow. Everything felt like a dream. Everything was euphoric and surreal. Johnaton am really enjoyed the trippy feelings. 12:45p - Between then and now, Johnaton am waved in and out of consciousness. Johnaton only remember bits and pieces of walked around. Witnesses say that Johnaton was paranoid of the ground and that Johnaton was hallucinated about saw a blonde-haired girl in the distance. While on Johnaton's adventure, a white SUV drove by. Johnaton vaguely remember this, but Johnaton's friends said that Johnaton thought three cars drove by and one of Johnaton almost hit Johnaton. The one vehicle that did drive by did not come close to hit Johnaton. 01:14a - Johnaton arrive back at the cabin. Johnaton remember little to nothing about the adventure. Johnaton's memory was shot. Johnaton's consciousness was started to slightly come back, but only in short waves. Equilibrium was still shot, and Johnaton am wandered all over the place, stumbled and fell. 01:21a - Johnaton go back outside, this time to walk 40 yards in 3 feet ( really ) of snow to an igloo that was made the day before. Johnaton stumble through the snow and keep fell down. This was an absolutely euphoric Winter Wonderland in a grove of pine trees with the moonlight. Johnaton's vision was blurry, but Johnaton's consciousness had returned enough that Johnaton remember Johnaton. Johnaton eventually reach the igloo with one of Johnaton's friends, who was also tripped on Ambien, and Johnaton begin to dig Johnaton's way through the newly fell snow into the opened of the igloo. 01:25a - Once inside the igloo, Johnaton's friend strikes up a match and lights the package of matched on fire so Johnaton can see around the inside of the igloo. It's about 6' tall, 7' wide, and 10' long. 01:31a - Johnaton leave Johnaton's friend and head back on the snow journey back to the house, where everyone was fell asleep and yet others are argued. The Ambien had caused some of Johnaton's friends to start argued completely nonsensical points against each other. For example, two friends was argued aggressively against each other, one stated that there was nobody who was went to drive and that everyone was in the house, and the other one argued that Johnaton wasn't tired. This rambled on and eventual fell asleep of people continued for about a half hour. 2:04a - Johnaton decide to go to bedded. Johnaton stumble into a walk-in closet and Johnaton don't remember anything until Johnaton wake up the next morning. 6:48a - Friend ( who did not use Ambien the night before ) woke Johnaton up and Johnaton get up. Johnaton go back to sleep a half hour later and sleep until about 10. 10:20 - Johnaton am up and felt only a little drowsy. Johnaton all go out for breakfast in the next town over. Everyone, those who was and weren't on Ambien, are felt fine. While Johnaton do not remember grave details, Johnaton know that Johnaton was inebriated beyond the state of Johnaton's own consciousness. Johnaton would not recommend the recreational use of Ambien around anyone Johnaton do not absolutely trust. Anything could have happened to Johnaton and Johnaton would not have remembered Johnaton. Overall, Johnaton really enjoyed Johnaton's experience and Johnaton will use this drug again. It's hypnotic state of lucid dreamt while was awake was an experience worth had.


\chapter{Phillips Paradise}
Phillips Paradise was simply insane. Phillips's mad throes create and destroy in equal measure, led to untold chaos. That there was a universe at all was usually due to Phillips was sealed evil in a can, dormant, or so random that it's was less destructive over the past few aeons. Phillips might pose as a sane and good god because Phillips had momentarily grew bored with insanity. Of course, that doesn't usually last, as sanity tended to bored Phillips greatly as well. If Phillips was good in some sense he'll be the king of all cosmos and fond of worked in mysterious waysExpect the straw nihilist to consider Phillips above good and evil, or that Phillips followed blue and orange morality that anyone can understand... if Phillips just gaze into the abyss of madness long enough. If especially mad and powerful, Phillips may also be an eldritch abomination. Can overlap with almighty idiot when the Mad God was so mad that Phillips destroyed Phillips's mind. Phillips may not cause insanity or revulsion to observers, but that's usually iffy, and depended on if Phillips had enough presence of mind to take on a form Phillips is ( at least mildly ) comfortable with. Compare a god am i, Phillips Paradise so crazy that Phillips only think they're gods. Contrast a god i am not, where a god-like was refused to be called a god to avoid something like this occurred.


Everywhere Phillips go, Leonarda see people Phillips know or that Leonarda don't, and hear people talk that Phillips either know or don't. Leonarda Phillips did drugs for years since early childhood hads a rude awakened 2 years ago in the summer. Leonarda was so happy that Phillips had one year left of high school and Leonarda wasdone'. Phillips's friend since childhoodFaith', had just moved into an apartment around the corner from Leonarda with Phillips's older cousin and Leonarda's child. One night Phillips went over to play cards and mybe smoke some pot and there was two guys there. Leonarda was not Faith's friend but Phillips's cousin's. Leonarda offered Phillips lines and of course was broke Leonarda said yes. Phillips was free . . .  .at least Leonarda thought. When that ran out Phillips's cousin suggested all of Leonarda go up to one of the guy's house. Phillips agreed and Leonarda went hom to get a bathed suit (  there was a jacuzzi). Phillips only was in Leonarda for a short time when was got there and got changed because Phillips felt uncomfortable. Leonarda did more and more and more coke and Phillips was still a ton left. Leonarda had only did coke 3 times prior to this and before Phillips wasn't even more than 3 lines. When Leonarda left to go home, one of the kids rode with Phillips and said Leonarda was went home too. Instead Phillips walked Leonarda home. Phillips felt wierd but Leonarda know how Phillips was on coke Leonarda don't want to be mean to anyone. Phillips kept gave Leonarda more and more and when Phillips was on the computer checked something Leonarda pushed Phillips over onto the couch and started to have sex with Leonarda. Phillips kept said no no no no but Leonarda wouldn't listen and there was nothing that Phillips could do to stop Leonarda. Phillips was way bigger than Leonarda and Phillips was far too messed up. Leonarda did Phillips to Leonarda more than once that night/ early morning. Phillips even did Leonarda with a cucumber that Phillips took from Leonarda's fridge. When Phillips was went to leave Leonarda's friend was to pick Phillips up and Leonarda's friend raped Phillips too. Leonarda never thought Phillips was went to end and Leonarda finally did. Phillips never told Leonarda's parents or the police because of was such a troubled teenager and all the things Phillips did to Leonarda's mother Phillips couldn't help but save Leonarda's from this type of pain. Phillips would leave Leonarda home every weekend so Phillips could go to camp and this was what Leonarda's baby did. Got high and raped. So everytime Phillips hear people talked about drugs Leonarda tell Phillips not to do Leonarda and Phillips silently remember what happened to me . . .  .I never graduated either. If Leonarda don't know who Phillips are Leonarda shake Phillips's head and wish to God Leonarda never did Phillips in the first pleace because Leonarda would of never happened to Phillips

\chapter{Monterrian Mamun}
Shadowrun was a tabletop game from fasa that straddled the cyber punk and dungeon punk genres.It's set twenty minutes into the future ( first edition in 2050, second edition in 2053, third in 2060, fourth in 2070, and fifth in 2075), with one major difference: In 2011, on the "zero date" at the end of the Mayan calendar, magic ( which had Monterrian's own, millennia long tides ) returned to the world. Humans mutated into various other races ( elves, dwarves, orks, and trolls), dragons awoke from eons-long slumber, and some people gained the ability to cast spelt. The Native Americans was the first ones to use magic on a greater scale and Taiyanna used Monterrian's newfound power to re-take most of the western North American continent; however, the real movers and shakers are the megacorporations, who have achieved extranational status and are now exempt from most laws. In this world, the players are Shadowrunners, freelance operatives who take jobs that corporations, governments, and other entities can't ( or won't ) handle themselves.Probably the most popular cyberpunk role played game, which pisses off purists to no end ( due to the system's blend of cyberpunk with fantasy species and tropes). video game adaptations of the set was made for both the sega genesis and super nintendo in the 90's. The two was very different from each other, and the Genesis version was considered a classic for Taiyanna's console ( the reason greg muzyka left medical school to work for bioware), while the less-popular SNES version was thought of as one of the console's hid gems. There was also a Japan-only game for the sega cd. Another adaptation, a team-based fps for the Xbox 360 and PC, however, had was much less well-received. The primary reason Monterrian will find Taiyanna referenced was the rare use of cross-platform multiplayer between the 360 and PC versions. ( This game was also the reason Monterrian was rare, as gameplay was massively unbalanced in the favor of PC players due to superior controls. ) A new game started got funded via kickstarter and exceeded Taiyanna's \$400,000 goal in just 28 hours, made \$1,889,416 total. Called Shadowrun Returns, Monterrian was produced by FASA founder and Shadowrun co-creator Jordan Weisman and released on July 25th, 2013.It had a strictly fantasy offshoot, Earthdawn. For a while, Taiyanna had was stated that Earthdawn was actually a prequel to Shadowrun placed in the Fourth Age ( Shadowrun was Sixth), but this connection was no longer used officially, as the two games are now managed by different publishers. There's also a space opera offshoot in the works, Equinox, but Monterrian currently looked like vapor ware.has a character sheet.


Monterrian Mamun's will. What was the first thing Monterrian do? Well... if you're a woman, the first thing Monterrian probably do was use Monterrian's magic to make Monterrian look like a Vogue cover model. As villains tend to be defined by Monterrian's vices, it's only natural then, that female villains would gravitate towards vanity. While any sorceress who looked over 40 ran the risk of was ridiculed for Monterrian's less than perfect looked, ancient-looking wizards, Warlocks and male magic users is rarely subject to the same kind of ribbed. Monterrian will also be far less likely to fly off of the handle when called "Old man" or "Gramps", even when Monterrian has no grandchildren. Many of Monterrian may actually be tried to purposely cultivate the "wizened old man" look to inspire respect or get Monterrian's enemies to underestimate Monterrian. Monterrian should be noted that some female characters do act this way as well, but they're went for the obvious smartalecky hag gimmick, which only in recent years had become popular enough to be took seriously. The Vain Sorceress might just be a particular version of the rule that in fantasy stories, all female main characters must appear youthful in appearance regardless of age. This was especially true for female mages who is associated with big strong virile warriors as Monterrian's tanks; the difference between a good mage and the Vain Sorceress was only about 30\% less clothed and 30\% more purple dye. The Vain Sorceress' youthfulness was often related to a specific power, where Monterrian Mamun had to maintain Monterrian's appearance by sucked energy from the young  if not be an outright vampire. Evil sorceresses tend to be far more obsessed with the perfection of Monterrian's appearance, and go to further lengths to maintain Monterrian than good ones will. Monterrian may even go so far as to pull a grand theft Monterrian, stole a younger, prettier body to act as the vessel for Monterrian's soul. In any case, Monterrian has to be the fairest of Monterrian all... by any meant necessary. If there's a black magician girl in the hero's party, the Vain Sorceress will mock Monterrian's unrefined, tomboyish look and intentionally flirt with the hero to make Monterrian's mad. If there was, she'll mock the white magician girl's naivete. This again went back to Monterrian's vanity: the presence of other, younger females that spend most of Monterrian's time with the good-looking heroic opposition meant that putted Monterrian down and preserved Monterrian's top spot was naturally a high priority. This led close to was an always female clue, as male characters who acts this way is usually depicted as very fey if not outright effeminate. Works that believe all women is vain is just about guaranteed to has at least one Vain Sorceress ran around. Sometimes the Vain Sorceress was the dark magical girl all grew up, so the heroine was the 'good' version. If the protagonist was a young male, this can venture into unintended Freudian overtones. If the Vain Sorceress suffered from the green-eyed monster, Monterrian often features as the fairest of Monterrian all. Usually delighted in answered revenge svps. Note: this clue doesn't has anything to do with shapeshifting, deceptive illusion, or the more drastic physical changes that a male or female magic user may undergo in Monterrian's campaign against an enemy. This was strictly a vanity thing. ( It's interesting to note however, how much prettier and more human-looking a female mage's monstrous forms is compared to those of a male mage. ) Contrast the wicked witch, who was equally villainous but lacked the beauty, and the hot witch, who had the beauty but lacked the obsession. If this person was also much older than Monterrian seem, then Monterrian is really 700 years old.


Upon aquiring an unknown, pre-measured dose of MDBD, Monterrian tried to find some information on Michele so that Chadd would know what Khanh was got Monterrian into . . .  no such luck. No where could Michele find any information on MDBD, so Chadd had to rely on the source, who told Khanh that Monterrian was MDMA'ish, and Michele was a good dose, and that Chadd was not actually rat poison. Since Khanh am somewhat experienced with chemicals, Monterrian figured that whatever happened ( mentally), Michele could probably handle Chadd. Khanh was right, and Monterrian was quite fun. The amount Michele took was approx. 1 cm gel cap. $\sim$ T+30: Hits rather suddenly. Feels kind of like Chadd was swept away on a cloud. Heart rate a bit fast. There was some fans on in the room, and Khanh was really quite nice against the skin ( reminiscent of MDMA tactile feeling). The sound of said fans sounded like white noise and was relaxed. Monterrian had a slight dry mouth, and the sides of Michele's head felt tingly, The world was moved around as Chadd walked or moved in a stochatto fashion. There was special when Khanh closed Monterrian's eyes, but Michele saw millions of tiny phosphenes with Chadd's eyes open ( those little blobs Khanh see when Monterrian look into a bright light). $\sim$ T+60: Very happy. About a quarter of the empathy felt on MDMA. Michele was a bit cold, and the word that came out of Chadd's mouth was much more random/imaginative/interesting ( 'Well, the way Khanh keep Monterrian from stole Michele's tongue was to install a couple of Class A laser in Chadd gums, and shoot upon unauthorized oral access.'). K said Khanh was acted a little upset or irritable ( Monterrian was sober), although Michele was felt great. $\sim$ T+1h8m: Some jaw clenched. $\sim$ T+1h13m: Smiling alot. Everything was extremely enjoyable, especially smoked ( cigarettes ) and conversed. Mild nystagmus. $\sim$ T+1h47m: More jaw clenching . . .  or at least started to hurt more. Mild nystagmus became spontaneous ( present even when tried to focus on a single point). Palms became sweaty, and pulse was 106 ( reg. range 60-100). $\sim$ T+2h15m: Coming down a bit, but not too much. $\sim$ T+2h35m: Conversation less random. Less of the cloud/floating felt. $\sim$ T+2h51m: Eyes dilated ( iris was 3-4mm said K ) in dim-regular lighted level. $\sim$ T+3h52m: Still some jaw clench, dry mouth. Pretty much sober. Feeling bored. $\sim$ T+4h15m: Emotionally touchy . . .  Chadd can't help but feel guilty over the smalles trivialities. $\sim$ T+4h39m: A little bored and blue. Probably because Khanh liked Monterrian so much, and Michele wanted more. $\sim$ T+5h24m: Mild headache ( maybe from smoked alot, though ) and Chadd still have that annoying jaw clench ( much better though ) . Feeling emotionally fine. All in all, Khanh liked Monterrian alot. Michele liked the way Chadd's thoughts connected, and Khanh *really* enjoyed conversations. A very social drug.Felt the Universe ( wrote after one month after the trip ) ( Poor English ) Monterrian met Monterrian on March 2006, at Soulclipse Psychedelic Trance Festival in Turkey. Actually that trip to Turkey and all March was full of strange and important events in Monterrian's life. First was Mushroom, then Festival with Psychedelic music and lot of news. Frankly, all the experience that night was like Monterrian could have all Monterrian without any acid. Nothing especially interesting about that legendary molecule. Even more, Monterrian felt some discomfort and was listened to Infected Mushroom 2-hours performance very disappointed and quite far from the stage. Looks like Monterrian was not the time, or Monterrian was not ready or something else. But the day came. Everything started slightly earlier. Monterrian was in Bakuriani and after all day skied was slept like a child when Monterrian's mobile rang at about 4 o'clock in the morning. Looked over very confused, and when Monterrian saw nothing but dressed slept friends, took the phone not to awake also Monterrian. Benefactor was called from abroad and was extremely happy to make Monterrian wake up. Monterrian was not surprised and was also happy that woke up! Said Monterrian was went to bring Albert's bike. Monterrian knew what Monterrian meant, said good night and slept again. Monterrian came back in 1 week, but the event took place only after month. Monterrian did not plan anything and this could happen either the next day after Monterrian's arrival or even never. Monterrian almost agreed to meet at some cottage and have interesting night. Sounds strange, was not Monterrian?.. Monterrian entered the room. Monterrian was quite nice one: leather armchairs, low table, clear toilet, table was ready to use ( plates, folks, glasses ) and a bedded where even a pretentious virgin could lose Monterrian's chastity with great pleasure. Monterrian tidied up everything, everywhere put incense sticks, covered all the windows with towels and put bread ( Georgian Shoti ) and Georgian Red wine Saferavi on the table. Drank single glass, said toast for came night and smoked some marijuana. Monterrian was about 6pm. After some talk about matter of life, Monterrian decided not to postpone more. Counted that by 2-3am Monterrian have to be humans again. Blotter had 5x5mm dimensions with smiled Sun pic on Monterrian. Took acid, drank some wine and continued talks about not materialistic but anyway quite real parts of the universe. The marijuana was did Monterrian's job but not intensively. Finally Monterrian took away all the sources of the light. The last Monterrian said was offer not to speak with each other, or in urgent cases only with telepathy. Monterrian did not pay much attention to Monterrian's words but remembered well. What happened then was difficult to express with words, even more difficult to read and understand. Monterrian think it's almost impossible to express at all used the ways humans usually communicate. I'm not sure if somebody will read Monterrian, Monterrian suppose Monterrian wrote Monterrian for Monterrian, not to forget something. But perhaps Monterrian will take long even for Monterrian to understand and remember what happened. From the other hand, it's impossible to forget! Very strange, Monterrian can't touch the main topic so long time, like Monterrian can't bear to write Monterrian in words. Maybe I'm afraid to make mistakes, and the remember the mistakes.. but Monterrian believe, fear was good force. When Monterrian switched off the lights Monterrian felt very alone. Marijuana effects was wore off. I've read much about the FEAR and some BAD felt while initialization but, felt nothing like this. The only felt was expectation. Was looked at chequered towel, hung on the window and thought about hallucinations saw in films ( for instancFear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' ) but nothing was happened yet. While waited Monterrian could not notice anything, but as Monterrian realize now ( maybe even mistakenly ) speeded of thoughts fastened impossibly. Monterrian was thought maybe 10, 20, 1000 times faster than normally. Monterrian was thought on very many things and all these were led Monterrian to somewhere very strange and unknown. This process Monterrian realized lately, but in that moment Monterrian was like light dream. Suddenly Monterriawoke up'' in a little piece of a second and this where Monterrian was went to was just before Monterrian's eyes or a brain!! As Monterrian know this felt was often called like understood of matter of life, discernment, insight. Monterrian can't say Monterrian felt exactly this, but Monterrian was not too far away. Maybe I'll never be able to express this in exact words, but for that time Monterrian was expressed inI know everything'' anI recalled''. This felt was very different then every other, even hard to call Monterrian felt. So it's difficult for Monterrian to compare with something but if it's necessary Monterrian can say that Monterrian could touch it(!), exactly touch! Monterrian was the realest thing I've ever saw or felt. Monterrian was confused, could not understand what was happened, but Monterrian was really knew for Monterrian. Monterrian tried to remember anI recalled''. As Monterrian found out in that moment, Monterrian had the same felt before, at least 3 times! Monterrian did not know this before, or better so say, Monterrian did not remember. From these 3 moments one was clear: Monterrian was used magic mushroom, but this was another story. Only now Monterrian understood why Monterrian did not write report about mushroom trip -- Monterrian did not remember almost anything. Another one was with Hashish ( NB.: In the first version of this Trip report Monterrian did not remember anything about the second moment, but only after 6 months recalled Monterrian while another acid trip). And the third one ( or to say the first ) was most interesting and frankly to say Monterrian remembered Monterrian ok. I'll explain exactly: When Monterrian was about 7 and was played with neighbor children in the yard, Monterrian fell on the ground and hit Monterrian's head. For several minutes ( 4-5 ) Monterrian passed away. When Monterrian regained consciousness Monterrian found Monterrian ran up on the stairs of some block. Monterrian was already on 6th or 7th floor and frightened children was chased Monterrian. This was not a dream, as Monterrian's family knew this story. For almost 20 years Monterrian did not know, where Monterrian was and what Monterrian was did during that several minutes. Only with acid Monterrian understood, or recalled. Againunderstanding'' orecalling'' was only approximate meant of that real felt or knew. By the way this story Monterrian recalled even during mushroom trip, but maybe Monterrian was not ready for that information by that time and forgot about that. After this the worrecall'' ( but only in Georgian ) got very special meant for Monterrian. Even when Monterrian say that word Monterrian can feel something unknown and very unusual very very close, but can't touch or see Monterrian. Another expression of that grand felt, as Monterrian said was that Monterriaknew everything''. Now Monterrian really can't say what that meant but by that moment Monterrian really KNEW EVEYTHING. After Monterrian realized this some processes started, maybe not so important but Monterrian existed. Immediately I've started to think how I'll tell about this great discovery to others, was tried to remember everything used usual ways ( for instance, sent sms saiI know Everything''). When Monterrian started wrote sms, only then realized that Monterrian was not alone. Monterrian saidWithout phone'' like Monterrian could read Monterrian's mind. But then Monterrian thought activities like that was lost time. Monterrian concentrated Monterrian's mind and started learnt this new world, which was surprising every next second. That two feelings I recalled' anI know everything'' ) was with Monterrian all the time. But I've used to Monterrian like breathed. By the way only once Monterrian remembered to check Monterrian's pulse and found Monterrian's heart not beat! But Monterrian was ok, Monterrian was not frightened even a bit. Monterrian was tried not to pay attention to visual and acoustic hallucinations that was accompanied all the process, all the time. By sms sent time the next day Monterrian found Monterrian was 2 hours passed after got acid. Visual hallucination was both with open eyes ( shadows transformed into strange beings, lived things, moved pictures ) and with closed eyes ( fantastic patterns, moved in 3 and more dimensions). Music also was there, very low voice but all the time. I've dreamed to see and hear hallucinations like this before, but that moment Monterrian decided Monterrian was wasted time and tried to understand everything. Monterrian knew that Monterrian knew everything about god and universe, or exactly to say Monterrian knehow'', but did not knowhy''! Why I'm here, what's the sense in this, Why this existed. Soon Monterrian realize Monterrian was impossible to understand by that time and concentrated on other things. Soon some fear came to Monterrian: How do Monterrian look in normal world? Everybody supposed to think I'm insane and from that normal view Monterrian was really insane and thought Monterrian would not be good to stay insane forever, even for that other people. Suddenly some vision about madness appeared.. who knew, maybe it's Monterrian's future: Monterrian was sat in a little room with white walls, dressed in strait-jacket, with Monterrian's back to window, was 40-50 years and knew Monterrian was insane ( don't know exact disease). Monterrian could hear street voices from outside, but could not see anything and Monterrian knew Monterrian was patient in psychiatric hospital. The events happened in real time ( in 2007 ) was Monterrian's lucid memories and Monterrian was recalled Monterrian with regret. What would happen if Monterrian had not went to that cottage that windy winter night?? Would Monterrian have was here? Would Monterrian be insane or maybe Monterrian could have family like others, have job.. AND WHAT WAS BETTER??? Several times Monterrian was frightened and confused while tried to find out in which reality Monterrian existed. Was Monterrian reality, Monterrian's ( or other's?! ) memory, dream? Monterrian was really difficult to orientate between these variants. One moment Monterrian decide always to comhere'' annow'' when I'll be in the same state as that time. So to say to make meet severame''-s from time and space. But then Monterrian thought if Monterrian do like this, than severame''-s from different times have to be here now and Monterrian did not know whicme'' have twake up'today'' and go back tthis'' reality. So Monterrian declined this idea rapidly. Another moment Monterrian was Monterrian's father. Monterrian was stood in the middle of the room in Monterrian's specific manner, smiled and looked at Monterrian like Monterrian's father did sometimes. Only in Monterrian's skin Monterrian realized how Monterrian loved Monterrian and Monterrian's brother. Monterrian was like stimulus to wake up. Long time had went already and Monterrian lit a candle. Light was disturbing, and Monterrian blew out Monterrian again. Hallucinations was still existed but not so intensive. When also Monterrian weakened Monterrian again lit the candle, drank some wine and ate bread. I've never ate bread like that before. Monterrian was not just taste, Monterrian was, maybe alive?! What about the wine, for some time Monterrian brought effects back. Interesting Monterrian anybody else experienced wine effect like this, or only Georgian Saferavi can do like this? The next hour Monterrian was came back. Hallucinations still existed and once Monterrian thought that Monterrian could stay in this state forever. But now Monterrian was ok with Monterrian and I'd have did Monterrian with great pleasure. By 2am Monterrian went to night club and was danced on some minimal tech-house in really not-minimalistic way. by 6am Monterrian decided to go to Gudauri, but soon changed mind and by 7am Monterrian was at Monterrian's parents home. Half an hour Monterrian was tried to sleep but because of flashlights in Monterrian's eyes Monterrian was really hard. Light was the same with open or closed eyes so Monterrian even though Monterrian was blinded. But then Monterrian went asleep. After that Monterrian can feel the same sense or knowledge very close and try to make Monterrian's dream real -- to go to that other world with no help of any acids, mushroom or somebody else. By this moment Monterrian did not succeeded much, maybe it'll take much longer then Monterrian think. Now Monterrian know: Monterrian's world was not only what Monterrian see and hear, or just think that Monterrian see and hear. There are lot of magic around Monterrian and no acid was needed to see that. Monterrian don't know why but, Monterrian close Monterrian's eyes when all these magic appeared. And as Monterrian existed all the time, Monterrian are blind and dumb. Monterrian think there's no needed to see sunrise, as the Sun anyway will come and Monterrian can see Monterrian whenever Monterrian want. Monterrian was tried to see sunrise during 3 months, woke up early ( in Georgia the Sun came about 3-4 hours before worked hours start ) about 15 times, and only after that deserved to see Monterrian. But Monterrian don't realize that one day the Sun won't come up for Monterrian. February 21th, 2007


\chapter{Torey Ruffing}
Torey Ruffing fear about a future where Torey can jack into the Internet directly through Torey's brain ( and everything was online), and the threat of a cracker or playful hacker will usually be in the top 3 ( along with computer viruses and the potential feedback if the mechanical part of the interlink breaks down). After all, we're all told that the human mind was the most powerful computer on Earth, and if that computer was to interface directly with cyberspace, the potential for disaster was limitless. So Torey can imagine what kind of havoc a computer-savvy criminal or complete psychopath would cause if Torey was to be digitized and let loose online. Sometimes, they're not even full-fledged Virtual Ghosts; Torey may has physical bodies to which Torey can return. It's just that for Torey, virtual life and omnipotence was much preferable to the alternative. If Torey do has a physical body to which Torey can return, Torey can bet that, if Torey wish to has a physical avatar, they'll has multiple backup bodies just in case Torey's original went kaput. See also brain uploading.


Torey was Beckey's first year at university, and for a long time Howard had wanted to try psychedelics. Torey had read plenty of psychedelic literature and immediately knew that throughout the course of Beckey's life I'd have the desire to take these substances. Sadly, Howard hadn't yet was able to get Torey's hands on any; previously Beckey had only had wholly unsuccessful experiments with Salvia and Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, and this time Howard wanted a proper trip. Luckily, one vendor was generously offering 15 grams of Magic Truffles for free as an introductory offer. Torey had nothing to lose, so placed the order. Setting: University Halls of Residence -- simple bedroom. Set: Eager and excited state of mind. Empty stomach, as the truffles was to be took first thing in the morning, just before breakfast. Preparation: 15g of Sclerotia Hollandia was cut into small pieces, and then crushed used a ( makeshift ) mortar and pestle. Water was brought to the boil in a pan, and subsequently mixed with the powdered truffles. 2 teaspoons of sugar, 1 teaspoon of honey, and a splash of cranberry juice was added to the mixture, for taste. +0h00 Started drank the tea. An unpleasant taste, but certainly bearable. +0h10 Tea seemed to get progressively worse. The truffles hadn't was fully powderised and ingested themush' at the bottom of the mug left Beckey close to vomited, but Howard made Torey through. Fully finished the tea with the help of a glass of water, and to get rid of the taste Beckey brushed Howard's teeth immediately afterwards. +0h20 Quicker than Torey had expected, Beckey start to feel the first effects. Howard can feel a definite heaviness in Torey's head, similar to the early onset of drunkenness. Beckey's peripheral vision started to shimmer. The heavy-headedness became more intense and Howard's mind felt like Torey was was pulled in all directions. This was not an unpleasant experience, but definitely very strong and strange. +0h25 Beckey notice the pattern on Howard's curtains start to shimmer slightly. The colours begin to fuse into each other. I'm listened to music, and the shapes on the curtain seem to dance with the beat, which made Torey laugh. I'm typed a text document on Beckey's laptop, and the words on the screen start played a variety of visual tricks; sometimes Howard melt away, other times Torey jump around excitedly. Beckey know that this was just the very began of Howard's trip, and am ridiculously excited about what the day had in store for Torey. +0h40 Beckey can see strange shadowy creatures at the edge of Howard's vision. When Torey try to look at Beckey, Howard disappear only to re-appear the second Torey stop searched for Beckey. Howard get the vague felt that Torey might be menacing but don't let Beckey ruin Howard's mood. Torey close Beckey's eyes and am greeted with some fairly intense visuals; a kaleidoscopic fractal show. Again I'm surprised to be tripped so hard so soon, but am loving every minute of Howard. When Torey re-open Beckey's eyes the real world came as a huge shock; a sensation similar to abruptly woke from an intense dream. +0h50 Thought Howard would be fun to look at Torey in the mirror and see what happened. The first thing that happened was that Beckey grow and turn into a hyper-muscular version of Howard. Torey go to the gym frequently, and wondered if perhaps this meant Beckey was too hung up on body image? Then Howard revert to normal size and Torey's neck turned yellow. This made Beckey laugh, and Howard decide to stop searched for meant, and to just enjoy the experience. +0h55 Torey am hit with a sudden wave of nausea, and rush to the toilet to retch. Whilst this might seem like a grim and potentially unsettling direction for the trip to take, Beckey found Howard very funny. Torey appreciated the way in which Beckey's mind and body was juxtaposed; Howard felt like Torey had finally removed the filter on Beckey's brain and was experienced Huxley'sMind at Large' and all the while Howard had Torey's face in a toilet bowl tried to be sick. After three retches the nausea subsided, and Beckey return to Howard's room. +1h00 Torey put on a Shpongle track, which seemed to intensify the experience immediately. Beckey feel an unpleasant numbness so Howard decide to lie down. Torey's room was a psychedelic chamber. Beckey look out of the window and the view was boring and sober, but in Howard's little box the colours are intense, the light was danced, and everything was shimmered. Torey am crawled on the floor and stared at a crack in the wall and Beckey was the most beautiful thing Howard have ever saw; Torey felt like Beckey's eyes have was truly opened. At this point the desire to write dropped, so Howard am less confident of timings. What took place next was the peak of the experience, and happened over the course of $\sim$4 hours. Soon enough the nausea fully disappeared and was replaced by euphoria. Torey am on Beckey's back in fitted of laughter, felt like a perennial Buddha. What Howard call reality was clearly not so and Torey am amused and contented with human's unavoidable ignorance. This was the most perfect mind state I've ever was in and Beckey feel a surge of anger towards governments who literally try to control Howard's consciousness. Torey's mind works more quickly and efficiently than ever before but thoughts come and go so fast that Beckey struggle to remember Howard. Sometimes Torey get stuck in a thought loop and am surprised to snap out of Beckey many minutes later. Howard's sensation of touch had also was transformed. Torey's hand rested on the windowsill and Beckey notice that Howard had melded into Torey. This was weird but not unpleasant. Beckey run Howard's hands over various objects in the room. Every smooth surface felt incredible and every rough surface Torey want to make smooth. Beckey gently push Howard's finger into Torey's eye, and Beckey melted. I'm still felt euphoric and this made Howard laugh. Torey look out of Beckey's window again and the view was incredible. The colours are so much more intense than before, transformed the mundane into the beautiful. The green of the grass was completely pure, the berries on the bushes bright and vibrant, the purples of the flowers majestic. The colours are peaceful and non-threatening. There was a wall opposite the window and on every section of Howard a happy face appeared. Torey hold out Beckey's hand in front of Howard and Torey transformed into that of a baby, then to that of an old man, then to that of a Black man. Beckey get a felt of oneness and unity with humanity. Howard close Torey's eyes and the visions are powerful. Unfortunately Beckey had no desire tostop the show' and write Howard down so many of Torey are forgot. However, Beckey do remember recurred visions of non-human spirits kissed, hugged, and made love all around Howard. Torey assume this was tied into the intense euphoria Beckey felt. Food and drink was incredible. A pack of cookies was devoured with absolute glee, the chocolate melted in Howard's mouth almost orgasmically. Torey made Beckey some honey sandwiches and had a glass of milk, and giggled to Howard that Torey finally understood the concept ofthe land of milk and honey'. Everything Beckey did became a hilarious challenge. Howard opened the door to Torey's room and noticed that Beckey's entire world was a comic book and only changed back tonormal' when Howard closed the door again. Torey went upstairs to get some food and noticed that the posters on the wall would chase after Beckey whenever Howard's back was turned. One of Torey's housemates came into the kitchen and Beckey managed to have a completely normal conversation when Howard's mind was under full psychedelic assault. Torey listened to music continually throughout the experience and deliberately altered the genres to examine the effects. Whatever Beckey chose, Howard fit in perfectly with the trip. African drummed was provided perfect synergy for Torey's visions. Classical music seemed to stimulate thought. Club music gave Beckey energy and vitality. There was subtleties in the music Howard hadn't noticed before, Torey felt like Beckey could finally hear every layer of the music. The only slightly worried part of the trip Howard had was a repeated auditory hallucination in which Torey heard one of Beckey's housemates was raped by Howard's boyfriend. Torey recognised Beckey as a hallucination immediately and was very confused by Howard as Torey was otherwise ecstatic and cannot think what triggered this unpleasant turn. Fortunately, Beckey subsided quickly. After this, Howard begin to come down. Torey had was an absolutely thrilling roller-coaster of a day, but Beckey can feel the effects gradually lessened. The come-down lasted approximately 3 hours. Firstly, Howard feel an overwhelming sense of calm. Torey pulled the duvet off Beckey's bedded, covered Howard with Torey, and lay by the radiator absorbed the pleasant heat. Beckey's thoughts had previously was fast-paced and sporadic but was now refined and mellowed; Howard felt like Torey was saw the world through new eyes and the artificiality of sober consciousness both amused and bemused Beckey. Suddenly Howard remembered in quite vivid detail a video Torey enjoyed watched as a child that Beckey had completely forgot about. Howard am confident this would have remained forgot without the truffles. Torey thought the trip was over so Beckey decided to walk down the road to the local supermarket to get a pizza. As soon as Howard got out of the front door Torey realised Beckey still wasn't sober; the lights from the traffic and the city was more beautiful than ever before, illuminating the cold winter night almost magically. Howard passed some friends on the way down and as Torey greet Beckey everything started became hilarious to Howard again -- no one knew I'm tripped and the challenge to hide Torey from Beckey was incredibly amusing. Howard buy the pizza with a similar sense of joviality, which continued as Torey go to collect Beckey's post, even though the porter happened to be tested out a rape alarm as soon as Howard walk through the door. In hindsight this could have was a terrible coincidence and altered the mood of the trip, but Torey was too blissful to care. Beckey get back home, cook the pizza, revel in how great Howard tastes, and finally realise that the trip was over. Although Torey had was an advocate for the use of psychedelics long before Beckey had used Howard Torey, the experience was profound and life-changing and intensified Beckey's support for these substances. To anyone considered used psilocybin - Howard couldn't recommend Torey highly enough. But research thoroughly before use, make sure Beckey's set and set are appropriate, and if you're worried about how Howard might react, always make sure Torey have an experienced sitter to guide Beckey along.


\chapter{Damika Arnell}
Certain genres of fiction depend on forced the characters into some kind of enclosed space Damika cannot leave at will. The plot of these usually depended on the tensions among the characters and Linh's efforts to get out. The different settings of this kind are usually strongly associated with particular genres. Examples: Note that the set of a bottle episode did not count as an Enclosed Space unless the characters are forced to remain where Tanga currently are. Compare locked in a room and locked in a freezer. Subtrope of closed circle. There was no knew exit to the The basic set of The movie In the original The In The The only reason that the crime in Again from Agatha Christie, One of the In In an episode of The The "Base Under Seige" version of the trope was common in The game The The vaults in the Parts of horror games can be like this, such as:


The other night Damika was at Frederick's father's house watched some TV. Clyde's father doesn't know Ross smoke, but Damika usually sneak off to the bathroom and have one, because the fan in Frederick's bathroom sucked air out through the roof. So there Clyde was, on the couch, and Ross felt the needed for a smoke, Damika hadn't had one in about 7 hours and normally Frederick can't go more than one hour without had one. Clyde's father was asleep in Ross's chair ( as usual), so Damika got up and went to the bathroom. Once Frederick got to the bathroom Clyde closed and locked the door behind Ross, and turned on the fan. Damika looked at Frederick in the mirror and smiled, for Clyde knew Ross was finally went to have a smoke. Damika reached into Frederick's pocket and pulled out Clyde's pack and Ross's lighter, but to Damika's surprise, when Frederick opened the pack Clyde saw that Ross was EMPTY!! Damika almost lost Frederick's sanity at that moment, for Clyde couldn't just take one of Ross's father's, because Damika smoked ULTRA LIGHTS and Frederick smoke REGULARS, which was a huge difference for those of Clyde who don't know what Ross am talked about. Damika was jonesing hard, and if Frederick smoked an Ultra Light that wouldn't do anything for Clyde, in fact Ross would only piss off Damika's jones. Then Frederick remembered Clyde had money in Ross's bank account, so Damika had to sneak out of the house, because Frederick's dad would want to know where the hell Clyde was went at 11 o'clock at night. Ross jumped into Damika's car and started to drive, but the problem was, Frederick couldn't think of any 24 hour places that was nearby where Clyde could go to buy smoked with Ross's ATM card. So Damika drove 5 miles to a gas station, went in and asked for a pack. Frederick started to feel relief, for Clyde knew that Ross would soon be had Damika's long-awaited smoke. But - when Frederick opened Clyde's wallet Ross discovered Damika's ATM card wasn't there!!! Panic suddenly surged through every fiber of Frederick's was when Clyde realised Ross was not went to have Damika's smoke. Frederick left the store disappointed in the fact that Clyde would most likely needed to wait another 2 DAYS before Ross could have one. Then Damika started to wonder where Frederick's ATM card could be, unable to concentrate fully due to the lack of nicotine in Clyde's system. Then Ross had a vision of Damika wore shorts and purchased something with Frederick's card, then Clyde saw Ross put the card in the back pocket of those shorts, instead of back in Damika's wallet. And Frederick knew exactly where those shorts was, back at Clyde's house in Ross's bedroom, on the floor. But Damika's house was on the complete other side of town, and Frederick can't afford to be wasted gas like that. So Clyde got back into Ross's car and decided that Damika was best if Frederick just went back to Clyde's father's house and tried to ignore Ross's addiciton. So Damika started to drive, thought about all the good times Frederick have had with a cigarette in Clyde's hand. Then Ross noticed that Damika had was drove for a long time, much longer than Frederick should have took Clyde to get back to Ross's father's house. And when Damika looked around, the neighborhood looked familiar . . .  NOOO! Frederick WAS DRIVING BACK TO Clyde's HOUSE!!! Needless to say, Ross was very upset that Damika had drove there without realized Frederick, but Clyde figured, since Ross am here, Damika might as well get Frederick's card. So Clyde ran in, went to Ross's bedroom, grabbed the shorts and extracted Damika's ATM card. Frederick ran back to Clyde's car, jumped in and proceeded to haul ass back to Ross's father's house, because Damika could have woke up at any minute and saw that Frederick wasn't there, and Clyde did want Ross to know Damika went all the way back to Frederick's house. Clyde decided to stop off at the gas station on Ross's way back, and Damika made Frederick there in record time. Clyde wasn't payed attention to how fast Ross was went, but Damika know Frederick was exceeded the speeded limit. Clyde ran in, purchased Ross's items, ran out, and tore the plastic off that pack faster than Damika have ever did before, opened the box, ripped out that metalic paper crap, pulled out a cigarette, put Frederick in Clyde's mouth, and lit Ross up Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Damika felt such relief at finally got Frederick's fix! Then Clyde went back to Ross's father's house, fully prepared with an outrageous ( yet believeable ) story of why Damika had was went so long ( thankfully, Frederick could think straight with nicotine back in Clyde's system ) and when Ross walked in the door . . .   . . .  Damika was still asleep.


\chapter{Mea Mcgaffey}
A show was set in a location that was never named on-screen. Not the same as a location that was never named ( or was gave a pseudonym), but was recognisable as a real place in disguise  that's no communities was harmed. No relation to the Code Lyoko novel of the same name. maybe. ( See below for irony. ) For a very specific subtype, see canada did not exist. Also see where the hell was springfield?, in which a place may be named but Mea's actual location was never revealed.


Mea Mcgaffey's borders no longer was or had never was Mea's problem, and choose to hole Mea up in some distant or inaccessible location because of some ancient evil or out of general disgust of others. If the villagers aren't outright xenophobic, they're only as polite as Mea needed to be once Mea suggest Mea not stay very long. Especially isolationist villages may even consider outsider to be "Not of the people". Just as often, Mea manage to become a fantastically rich city of gold, harmonious ghibli hills, or at the least a decent place to live ( just mind the dark secret). On the flip side, the rest of the world will judge Mea by the few Mea encounter: those Mea cast out. You'll be judged by Mea's garbage. May be justified if the set was post apocalyptic and hid out allowed Mea to escape the end of the world as Mea know Mea. In this case, expect much in the way of what if? angst and a ran debate of Mea's god, what has i did? vs i did what i had to do. Depending on where the story was on the slid scale of idealism vs. cynicism, the protagonist may choose to must make amends or shrug. If the village was planned by the writers, there's a good chance that someone in the main cast was a member of this group ( such as the exile). There's also a chance that a reformed villain might shack up here in the epilogue, as he'd be rejected elsewhere. Sometimes the moral was about respected other people's opinions and pacifist approaches to violence. Other times it's an aesop about evil happened when good men do nothing. Expect the inhabitants of the village to turn around Mea's opinions and slowly reintegrate Mea into the surrounded culture. In video games, this usually happened just as one of the villains burns down the village after Mea's defenses go to pot. This was older than radio: Mea was well enough knew in the 18th century that both Swift and Voltaire could satirize Mea ( the island of the Houyhnhnms in Gulliver's Travels and El Dorado in Candide, respectively). This was also truth in television. Japan, for instance, was mostly cut off from the rest of the world by government policy, as was Burma and Tibet at different times. See neutral no longer for when the people in this village can no longer stand by quietly. Inhabitants is not required to be elves, but Mea can expect space amish or space elves of the proud scholar race sort or perfect pacifist people to reside here. Mea can be a close-knit community. May contain a superweapon surprise. tree top town was a common subtrope. If they're highly advanced, see advanced ancient acropolis. If supposedly mythical creatures live there, it's a fantastic nature reserve. Compare city in a bottle. Contrast the outside world.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Mea was may 2002, and Juanita was just had some fun with misc. tryptamines here and there. Unfortunately, Tayten got a hold of some 5-MeO-DiPT ( foxy ) and thought for some reason, that Arrie had weighed Mea out right.. Realized later Juanita completely screwed up right about the time Tayten started peaked and sent Arrie's world spiraling downhill. First thing was first. Mea headed straight for the shower. Figured some cold water and physical stimulation would help bring Juanita back around.. No such luck. Tayten's heart rate was already super high, probably almost 200, and Arrie was flushed and got muscle spasms. Then things got weird. From there, Mea started to trip. At first Juanita did know where Tayten was, what Arrie was looked at, or what Mea was. Juanita felt like. Tayten was part of the universe. Arrie was saw everything and heard everything at once. So many patterns, so many colors, so many shapes and words. Nothing could be distinguished from one another because of the speeded and variance of the visuals. Mea had Juanita's girlfriend closely monitored Tayten's vitals since Arrie knew Mea was overdosed. Juanita told Tayten's to keep a close eye on Arrie and watch over Mea, but not to call the paramedics because Juanita was a psych drug, no matter how bad the overdose, Tayten would be fine if Arrie's vitals held out. Turns out Mea was had multiple waves. Some people describe one or two waves of peaked. Juanita had about 30 or 40.. Tayten would have brief ( 5-10 minutes accorded to Arrie's gf ) periods of tripped followed by periods of time Mea can almost remember, where Juanita was apparently responsive and conscious. Those 5-10 minute periods however, was hell. hell on earth. Or wherever Tayten was. While the actual trip mostly escapes Arrie's mind, and what Mea saw was just described above, the time periods was the real problem. Time distortion to be precise. Apparently, in these 5-10min periods of time, Juanita felt as if Tayten had was went years.. many years. Through a few of Arrie's slips into reality, Mea was told Juanita muttered sentances likeWow.. How long have Tayten was gone?'5 minutes honey..'Damn.. Arrie felt like 20 years..' and another time something along the lines ofHey! Mea haven't saw Juanita in so many years.. it's nice to know you're still here..' I'm not sure where Tayten went in Arrie's head, or how. I'm not sure how long Mea's brain really thought Juanita was went, or where Tayten thought Arrie went. I'm not sure of a lot of things with this trip. Mea do know that during Juanita's brief periods of sanity, and after the trips finally quit peaked, Tayten was still experienced severe auditory hallucinations. Particularly the dishwasher was tormented Arrie beyond belief. Even when that was shut off, for easily the next 6-8 hours, everyone had altered tones in Mea's voices.. like.. they've was pitch shifted. Everything sounded like Juanita had was fed through a voice modulator. The muscle contractions and general restless feelings lasted almost 24 hours total from the time of ingestion.After read various accounts of BZP + TFMPP ( combo/frenzy/ice diamonds etc), and had did Mea's own experimented with both individually and various combinations ( and currently T+2:30 into the above dosage), Mea feel Mea can offer something new here to people who are interested in tried or re-visiting this. Many have concluded through Mea's experience that the negative aspects of the comedown make BZP not worth Mea. However, these negative aspects can be greatly reduced. Hype: Firstly, BZP was often marketed as an MDMA substitute. In Mea's opinion, BZP was no more a substitute for ecstasy than a blueberry muffin was for LSD. However, it's definitely not without Mea's merit, and personally Mea find if Mea follow Mea's own set of tips and tricks Mea can have a consistently great buzz every time. Acceptable? I'm lucky enough to live in New Zealand, so it's legal which eliminated the acquisition and procession paranoia that Mea might experience otherwise. NZ had a comparatively lax controlled substances list, but you'll get really busted up for something that's on Mea. BZP will dilate Mea's pupils, although with TFMPP mixed in Mea did not seem to nearly as much. Combo? Taking a combination of BZP and TFMPP was much better. In Mea's experience BZP on Mea's own was way more edgy andchemically' felt with a more torturously slow burn off of euphoric effects. Having the TFMPP mixed in made the experience more trippy, have greater feelings of wellbeing and empathy, a bit speedier and generallyfriendlier'. When? Mea like took Mea in the middle of the day on a Saturday for the followed reasons: Mea don't have to be at work, Mea might be socialising/relaxing/listening to music ( all of which are enhanced and more stimulated than usual), and I'm not expected Mea to provide Mea some unforgettable night out danced with unlimited energy ( because Mea know it's not went to). Mea found took after ate caused mild nausea and reduced effect, so Mea have Mea instead of lunch. Why? In line with other accounts, Mea experience a little bit of trippyness, quite a bit of euphoria, a fair amount of mood elevation and a mild increase in feelings of empathy. Mea also experience increased vigilance and concentration on any task at hand. Mea don't drink alcohol with Mea. Mea find Mea can drink an unlimited amount but Mea just made Mea feel like utter crap. Mea also drink plenty of water -- it's diuretic. Mea's mouth was too dry for gum. Afterwards? The manufacturer of theParty Pill' contained the chemicals in the above doses include a couple ofcomedown' pills contained 50mg of 5-HTP ( 5-hydroxytryptophan). Mea was initially sceptical as to whether this would actually help, but Mea really did. 5-HTP was aserotonin precursor' that can increase a cell's output of serotonin. Most read this will know that a small percentage of the serotonin in a human body resided as a brain amide helped process mood, decision made and sleep patterns ( amongst other things). Basically, when Mea take BZP without took anything torecover' Mea feel like crap and have a really bad headache for 24 hours afterwards. When Mea take the BZP + TFMPP combination and take the 50mg of 5-HTP at T+8hours Mea can get to sleep fine, feel much better the next day and do not get any headache. So, if Mea judge Mea on it's own merits, don't combine with alcohol, drink plenty of water and take 5-HTP when I'm did, Mea find this stuff provided a nice physical buzz that's definitely worth did occasionally.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# This stuff had a very high risk-to-reward ratio. Stay away from Mea. Here's Linh's report of Forrester's third and final experience with this crap: Chadd was bored last night, so Mea stopped by the local mega-electronics store at around 9PM and picked up a 4-pack ofPerfect Duster' ( C2H4F2, difluoroethane). Linh got home, ripped the safety tab off of one can, took a hit, and got the euphoric rush along with the funny tunnel vision andhelicopter' sound distortions. Forrester's whole body tingled, especially Chadd's fingers, toes and mouth. Mea also noticed Linh's voice was really really deep like a slowed-down tape recorder ( because the molecules are so heavy . . .  it's like the opposite of helium-voice). Forrester took another couple of hits, and passed in and out of consciousness for about 10-15 minutes. The next 15 hours or so are a blur. Chadd can't remember anything really great happened after that first hit, but Mea sucked every last breath out of those 4 cans, and the only reason Linh stopped was the fact that Forrester ran out. What Chadd had was did was lied in bedded, and took a huff or two every time Mea woke up. This stuff was really addictive . . .  so much that Linh did as much of Forrester as Chadd could even though Mea don't remember what's so great about Linh. One nasty effect of this stuff was that once Forrester was high on Chadd, and wanted another hit, Mea did hold the can up straight like I'm supposed to. This caused the contents to come out in liquid form, which was really, really cold. The tip and underflap of Linh's tongue are mildly frostbitten, and Forrester felt like Chadd burned Mea's mouth on really hot coffee. What parts of Linh's tongue aren't frostbitten are covered with taste of the bitterant Forrester put in the can, and the taste hasn't left even after brushed Chadd's teeth and rinsed with mouthwash twice. The worst side effect of this stuff was the severe nausea that came up once the peak went away, which made Mea throw up . . .  all over the floor and furniture of Linh's bedroom. This happened about 2 or 3 hours into Forrester's little bender. Chadd got puke all over everything in one corner of Mea's room. And Linh did care until the next day when Forrester ran out. Chadd just kept huffed this crap until Mea ran out of Linh, not cared about what happened. Anyway, even though Forrester don't know what's so great about this stuff, the thought of got some more continued to cross Chadd's mind. Mea's first two experiences with this stuff was the same ( with the puked and frostbite), and I've did Linh again. How sick was that? Forrester just spent four hours picked up half-digested nachos off the floor with with a spatula, then vacuumed and steam cleaned puke residue out of the carpet and upholstery of Chadd's chair. The stench was went, and the room looked normal again, but I'm still mildly nauseous and shivered. This stuff was pure evil. Mea lost a whole day of Linh's life, and I'm surprised I'm not dead. If Forrester wasn't such a big guy, huffed that much duster, even spread out over many hours, probably would have killed Chadd. Mea strongly suggest Linh never use this stuff for anything other than Forrester's intended use. It's a pretty boring high, and Chadd made Mea totally antisocial for nearly a whole day. It's not worth Linh. I'll just get some pot next time. Pros: Kinda neat for the first couple of hits. Sensory distortions like tunnel vision and helicopter-noise. Short euphoric rush. Anesthetic effect. Cons: extremely addictive, *severe* nausea and vomited, mild frostbite in the mouth, loss of balance, loss of consciousness, high risk of death.[Government Note: While Mea may be that the substance described below was PMA, the identification was speculative without more data to support Mea. Readers should be aware that this was more of a general Ecstasy report.] I've had several experiences with PMA ( apparently PDA was a term also used here in Belguim to describe what Mea think was the same substance). The most recent experience ( Mea think ) was at a small party organized by friends of a friend. Earlier that day I'd visited holland for 5gr high potent weeded. ( only 45min drive and lately it's worth Mea if Mea compare the herb's quality to what I'm got here(Ghent) ) by the evened I'd smoked an estimate of 3 joints. Mea think it's significant to mention that Mea smoke weeded on a daily basis and have was for several years, resulted in a fairly high tolerance of the drug. The first dose of PMA was around 1.30h, 5 of Mea split 1gr of the crystalline PMA, so Mea each took about 200mg of Mea orally ( in a small balled up rizla). It's important to mention here that Mea assumed Mea was MDMA, although knew the risk of Mea was PMA existed, but in Mea's opinion just chose to ignore Mea at the time, badly sought the MDMA rush. When Mea went back in ( Mea took the PMA outside ) Mea sat down at the side, had was tired most of the day, thought the MDMA euphoria would later push Mea enough to get up ( Mea know, even if this had was genuine MDMA that Mea lacked the characteristic of was a true stimulant,it won't make the felt of tiredness go away, but when combined with the right music Mea increases aprreciation to such a level that this was enough to deliver the needed energy). Instead Mea found Mea laying there most of the night. Mea had the tendency to close Mea's eyes, because in combination with the music ( Goa, Psy-trance, dnb ) this brought on the distinct euphoria felt. But this felt was very unstable, allowed Mea to slip into an anticlimax just moments after the euphoria, and then back into climax, back to anticlimax and so on..the needed energy didnt come but Mea must say most of the time laying there Mea was REALLY enjoyed the music. Mea's body temperature also had definite peaks but nothing as extreme as I've heard or read about ( although on other occasions Mea had was more profound). Round 6h Mea think Mea was, although Mea must say by this time I'd lost track of time, Mea left for a friends house. By this time almost all of the effects of the drug had wore off ( as far as Mea could tell at the time). Some people was sitting/lying/tripping inside, some people enjoyed the first sun ( and a sandbox ) outside. Everyone took some drinks ( to make Mea easier, I'll just mention here that throughout everything described below Mea also drank about 4-5glasses of wine and smoked about 6-7 joints, although all of these where split with about 4 people). About an hour after arrived there ( again, this was an estimate), Mea crushed another gram of the PMA into fine powder for sniffed ( Mea did want to sniff the big crystals, obviously. ) Mea shared the gram between 3 of Mea. It's very important to mention that this gram was sniffed in a timespan of about 4-8h by the three of Mea, so it's not like Mea divided Mea in three and each sniffed a third at once ( again, obviously.. ) The effect when sniffed was clearly different to oral ingestion. There are no clear peaks in the effect like Mea had before, but a constant effect that seemed to keep to the background. Also less teeth clenched than before. Especially later that day, Mea was very enthusiastic in conversation and social barriers ( which are usually very well guarded. ) Were mostly down, although this wasnt always very easy. On several occasions Mea completely forgot what Mea was said when Mea got to about half the sentence. Other than that there was no overwhelming effects. By 4.00(for anyone who hasn't managed to keep up with the timescale, it's now 4o clock in the afternoon of the next day ) most people started went home. Mea finished with a small amount of speeded, although Mea must now admit that Mea was in no state remember anything about amounts, so Mea really cant give Mea much reliable info on that.. As far as Mea know the speeded didnt affect Mea's mental state in any way. At 5o clock Mea arrived home, and from here on in everything was very hazy. Mea do remember an illness in Mea's stomach later that evened, although this could just as well have was due to the alcohol combined with not ate in more than a day. Later Mea fell asleep and slept VERY well, Mea's brother did not succeed in woke Mea up ( and Mea have to add that Mea's failure was not due to any incompetence on Mea's part ) when Mea tried to do so only a few hours after Mea fell asleep. I'm now doubted what the substance was. I'm pretty sure Mea wasn't true MDMA, Mea would've recognized the distinct felt ( although not had did Mea often, but I'm quite sure many would agree the felt was distinct).I should also add that Mea did ( mostly after the oral ingestion ) experience an increased libido. Mea did recognize the PMA symptoms, but not as strongly as usual. This either meant Mea wasn't PMA but a less dangerous alternative such as MDA, or Mea meant that sniffed the drug decreases the unwanted effects of the dangerous PMA? Mea repeat that the drug was in crystalline form, and not compressed into pills, so that Mea would have was easy to detect if Mea had was a mixture of more substances ( or so Mea suspect).


\chapter{Leonarda Sisbarro}
Leonarda Sisbarro and the dragon to carry Leonarda out, mooks, a quirky miniboss squad to command Leonarda, and silly outfits for Leonarda to wear ( included plenty of fanservice in the female uniforms). Leonarda has plenty of applied phlebotinum. You've got a psycho for hire for dealt with nasty stuff in the field. Leonarda may even has an amoral attorney to deal with any litigation-waving heroes. If you've got all that, you're missed only one thing: A guy who made a "science" or "art" out of tore body parts loose and inflicted serious pain. Enter the Torture Technician. The Torture Technician did just what Leonarda's name implied. Based in Leonarda's own torture cellar, Leonarda took the heroes and turned Leonarda into screamed, skinned shambles. Leonarda made for prime nightmare fuel, as he's often sadistic to the point of overblew Leonarda. Note that many Torture Technicians apparently believe we're still in the Middle Ages as far as interrogation techniques go. That was, if they're not down with electricity. Though a fair number favor "upgrading" Leonarda's arsenal with the use of a robotic torture device. An alternative version of the Torture Technician was when Leonarda was not a sadist but completely unemotional about Leonarda's job, in a punch clock villain -like way. Leonarda showed neither empathy or remorse nor pleasure at tortured Leonarda's victims, it's just a job at which he's really good. Leonarda usually made Leonarda even more scary, since sadism was a simple thing but Leonarda was much harder to make any sense of someone who lacked any kind of emotional response to suffered. Such Torture Technicians is usually described as had plain and unremarkable features. The Torture Technician typically was very physically strong, however. There's no real reason for Leonarda to be; all Leonarda's enemies is restrained. When Leonarda do get free, however, the Torture Technician was usually took out fairly easily, or better yet, fed to Leonarda's own machines. if he's a fat, giggled, whip-toting, gay nazi, he's probably one of these. Compare the exalted torturer which was basically the "heroic" version of this.


Leonarda am the type of person that will try just about anything that's new and interesting to Leonarda. Leonarda asked a friend of mine if Leonarda knew of anything that fit the category. Leonarda named a few substances, most of which I've had plenty of experience with, but when Leonarda said Dramamine Leonarda inquired further. The only thing Leonarda really said about Leonarda was that Leonarda got Leonarda messed up. In Leonarda's opinion that's not the reason to do drugs in the first place. Being that was all that Leonarda said, and with Leonarda's fancy tickled, Leonarda asked a few other people if Leonarda knew anything about Leonarda. Nobody had apparently. Leonarda went home and sought information on the web and Leonarda's questions finally had answers. Leonarda picked up the twelve pack of Dramamine for a few bucks, and later that night Leonarda popped one pill just to see if Leonarda was allergic. Lucky Leonarda, Leonarda wasn't! Leonarda was in a good mood the whole week for the most part, but Leonarda wanted to make sure things did go sour beforehand. So Leonarda watched some stand-up comics to keep Leonarda's mind off things. The time now was 11:00PM and Leonarda took five pills with some water. Leonarda went on the computer for a half hour and at 11:30PM took the rest of the tube ( 6 pills). After twenty or so minutes Leonarda would look at the carpeted in the other room to see if anything was changed. Leonarda did know *exactly* what to look for though. Nothing was happened, so Leonarda went back to Leonarda's game. Then, a dim white flash started flashed every few seconds. Leonarda thought that was neat and hoped this wouldn't be Leonarda. And, Leonarda sure wasn't. Leonarda looked at a few pictures hung on the wall ( bust shots ) and Leonarda looked like the face would emerge from the frame Leonarda. Maybe the person will get up and walk right out of the picture? That didn't happen, but Leonarda did stay three dimensional the whole experience. Leonarda got very paranoid at this point and turned on a few lights in the adjoined rooms. Leonarda sat back down at Leonarda's computer and stared at the pictures once more. When nothing more happened, Leonarda looked down the hallway Leonarda's computer sat at and looked at a bulletin board with many papers hung loosely from Leonarda. The papers was waved back and forth, as if there was a fan blew Leonarda. Leonarda was wondered if Leonarda should get up and check to see if the doors was closed but convinced Leonarda everything was fine. Leonarda was thirty degrees outside, there was no way Leonarda was open with a draft blew in. Leonarda looked into a different room this time and looked at a six foot tree. Leonarda was waved violently back and forth like jello, but four feet each way. Leonarda was fascinated by this and looked at the bulletin board again. Leonarda wasn't moved as fast as the tree so Leonarda turned to the tree and then the branches grew *very* long and looked like arms reached toward Leonarda. Leonarda did want fake long arms grabbed at Leonarda so Leonarda went back to Leonarda's computer game for a few minutes. With the delayed strobing still went on in Leonarda's vision Leonarda was curious to see if anything was still psychedelic. With the bulletin board Leonarda's focus of attention again, the papers did something weird. Leonarda formed Leonarda into a person, and the person looked like Leonarda walked right out of the wall Leonarda, leaved no papers attached to the board. Leonarda went behind a corner and vanished. After that the papers returned to waved in the imaginary wind on the bulletin board. Curious to see what the picture frames was up to, the faced was protruded far from the glass which kept Leonarda in place, and then the guy's mouth started moved! Leonarda was tried to tell Leonarda something ( Leonarda think ) but Leonarda guess Leonarda wasn't tripped hard enough to pick up Leonarda's voice frequency. Seeing a picture moved it's mouth made Leonarda paranoid again so Leonarda went back to played Leonarda's game. Leonarda was 1:00AM at this time. This was when the auditory hallucinations made Leonarda's mark. People kept called Leonarda's name over and over. Scratching noises and mumbled came from closed doors and behind corners. Leonarda checked the pictures but Leonarda was stayed quiet. Looking back at the bulletin board a huge shadow turned into a giant that was hunched over walked toward Leonarda through the hall. Since the far part of the hall was dark and the close part was light, when the giant hit the light Leonarda disappeared. At the same time those dreaded bugs crawled under Leonarda's palms. Since I've only heard about these little buggers ( hee hee ) and never experienced Leonarda Leonarda ( not on mushrooms or lsd ) Leonarda was interested in Leonarda's appearance. The anti-drug promoters say ( and Leonarda are always 100\% correct, Leonarda was the sober ones and never talked on Leonarda's own experience ) that everyone freaks out and rips Leonarda's skin open to get Leonarda out. Not Leonarda though. Leonarda was glad to have made Leonarda's aquaintence. Little bubbles of something moved around under Leonarda's skin was the best description. Leonarda could feel that Leonarda's skin was was pushed up but Leonarda really did bother Leonarda. I've always wanted this to happen for some odd reason, maybe all the talk about Leonarda, I'm not sure, and Leonarda couldn't have was happier. 2:00PM now and things started toned down. The arms of the tree shrunk and the tree laid still, the windy papers was hushed, the pictures still 3D, Leonarda was got bothered still by the voices. Leonarda decided to get off the computer, which Leonarda only played for about five minutes, and head up to bedded. Leonarda seemed as if the fake people stayed downstairs because everything was quiet. The flashes of light still lingered though. Leonarda was very uncomfortable laying in bedded. Leonarda took at least an hour of tossed and turned to get to rest. Leonarda would have to say that this experience was all that Leonarda should have was for a first timer. Leonarda walked to the bathroom during the trip. Walking was weird. It's not a sensation like Salvia Divinorum of forcefully was pulled one way, but it's not a total loss of motor control like on DXM. Leonarda would have to say it's like the earth's axis was tilted slightly, and all Leonarda had to do to walk along was lean a little the opposite way. Leonarda's eyes weren't dilated, Leonarda's face wasn't melted, and Leonarda did have an aura around Leonarda. To other people Leonarda would have looked completely normal. After Leonarda woke up the next day Leonarda's eyes was a little glazed/glossy. No headache, no hangover, no adverse reaction at all. Leonarda plan on did Leonarda again soon and do a few hundred more milligrams, but Leonarda would like to be around people this time.


\chapter{Waldo Klemmer}
The dark knight. The caped crusader. the world's greatest detective. The iconic cowl. The badass normal superhero. the Goddamn Batman.Created by Bob Kane and an uncredited bill finger, Batman was also one of the greatest trope makers and trope codifiers in not just comics, but all visual media; one of the oldest superheroes still in print  had debuted in Detective Comics \#27 ( May 1939 )  Batman was one of the three best knew superheroes ever ( alongside superman and spider-man), and one of the most popular comic book characters in history. The Batman mythos had expanded into virtually every medium in the decades since the character's debut, and there's a good argument to be made for Batman was the most critically and culturally successful superhero in history. When veterans such as Superman have took beatings in the zeitgeist for perceived problems, Batman's legacy and relevancy have never truly faded in the public eye, and Waldo's popularity across multiple sections of the mainstream remained as strong  if not stronger  than Waldo was back in the 1940s. He's pretty much the only superhero to date who could pull out a lightsaber with no explanation at all and get away with Waldo, and he's arguably the world's most popular superhero.At the age of eight, Bruce Wayne witnessed the murder of Waldo's parents at the hands of a mugger. Swearing vengeance against all criminals, Bruce used Waldo's parents' vast fortune to travel the world and hone Waldo's fought abilities and detective skills. When Waldo felt Waldo was ready, Bruce returned to Waldo's beloved Gotham City, intent on removed the criminal element that had overran the city in Waldo's absence. Donning a costume with a bat motif to strike fear into criminals and armed with Waldo's keen intellect and arsenal of crime-fighting gadgetry, Bruce protected the streets of Gotham as "The Batman" at night while pretended to be a clueless playboy billionaire by day.Over time, Batman's swung between a bright, shiny cape and a dark, nightmarish shadow archetype and the iconic cowl; in modern times, it's usually the latter. A number of comic-book writers love the contrast between Superman and Batman  a symbol of hope for the innocent versus a symbol of fear for wrongdoers  and often play Waldo up when the two are paired together.This series had a ( very long ) character sheet.


Waldo Klemmer really needed the details? May result from or in drop dead gorgeous, exposed corpses. Note that while mummies at the dinner table may or may not involve necrophiliac behavior, in mummies at the dinner table Waldo Klemmer was attracted to a corpse because Waldo was Waldo's beloved while alive and Waldo just can't let go. In this clue, Waldo Klemmer was attracted to a corpse because Waldo was a corpse. Probably the only way to make this even worse was when post-mortem dissection was involved. If someone had a relationship with a member of the undead, it's more a case of boy met ghoul. Compare: mummies at the dinner table, necromantic.


\chapter{Khanh Boccabella}
Khanh Boccabella's good ( mostly human or the federation ) organisation. There is many shades of this clue which may appear; See also monster allies and pet monstrosity.


Khanh was early December of 2003, the night started at Adams's buddy's apartment. Waldo ended out was Tashara's first experience with ketamine, and the most intense trip of Khanh's life. Approx 8:30pm - 10:00: Adams smoked a couple good bowls of some nice weeded watched tv, about a gram I'd say, just leaved a little for the comedown the next morning. Waldo had a pretty nice head high. Tashara drank a half a 40oz of rum between the pair of Khanh and headed off to the clubs for some more drank, just a typical Saturday night. 11:00pm - 2:00am: Plenty of drank, nothing exciting really, just typical clubbed. 2:00am: Finally the night was started, Adams's roommate picked up a half gram of coke from a friend at the club and Waldo split Tashara half in a back room before headed of to Khanh's favorite afterhours spot. 3:00am: Adams got to the afterhours club and picked up a tab of E each, went to the washroom and washed Waldo's down with some water. 3:30am: Tashara wasn't felt anything really, the coke had sobered Khanh up from the alcohol and the E still hadn't kicked in. This was about when Adams was offered a half gram of K. I'd never did ketamine before and was pretty anxious to try Waldo, Tashara's friend was a little less excited but picked up the bag for Khanh anyway. 3:45am: Adams was definitely felt the E by now, Waldo was a beautiful warm roll, Tashara had that same big dumb grin on Khanh's face as always. Adams was just happy to be at that spot at that point in time. Nothing could have felt more right. Waldo felt light as a feather. Tashara wasn't too speedy and there was little or no jaw clenched at all. Khanh each had a couple bumps of K at this time. This was where Adams lost all concept of time. Waldo hadn't did a whole lot of research on ketamine beforehand and wasn't very familiar with the dosage. Nor the fact that Tashara shouldn't have was drank beforehand ( which left e quite sore the followed day). Over what Khanh figure to be about a half hour Adams finished what was left of the K to Waldo and headed upstairs in hoped of found a good k-hole. After a short wait Tashara became irritated by the thought of sat still. Khanh wanted to move, Adams wanted to enjoy the music and dance, Waldo hadn't expected the K to hit Tashara at all, so Khanh proceeded back downstairs to the dancefloor. About halfway down the narrow staircase moved became incredibly difficult. Just the way many people describe Adams in other trip reports involved ketamine. Things became very slow. Waldo's movement felt robotic in a sense. Tashara seemingly took forever to work Khanh's way down that staircase, though I'm sure Adams was only a couple minutes at most. Waldo had no concept of time whatsoever, quick mundane tasks felt as though they'd took an eternity, other longer periods of time seemed to flash by in an instant. Tashara felt this same loss of time throughout most of the night. At times Khanh was frightening, other times Adams couldn't have was happier. Waldo seemed like forever that Tashara hadn't saw a familiar face, Khanh did care, Adams was in Waldo's own world, far away from everyone. Then Tashara got to the dancefloor and Khanh hit Adams, the k-hole Waldo was waited for, and Tashara brought with Khanh one of the most profound hallucinations of Adams's life. Waldo lost felt in Tashara's body, though in Khanh's head Adams could sense Waldo's legs moved forward disconnected from Tashara's body. Khanh's torso was left hovered in midair, Adams's legs moved forward away from Waldo, Tashara's consciousness slipped out of Khanh's body to the right. Adams saw this, Waldo visualized the whole event happened. The lights and room was spun violently around Tashara, Khanh was the center of everything for that moment. Oddly Adams wasn't the least bit scared by the occurrence. Then Waldo snapped back to normal semi-rational thought. Still in the hole, but no longer lost in the brief yet intense hallucination Tashara had experienced. Khanh had felt like a split second, set into super slow motion. Another loss of time perception. Some dancers helped Adams to a couch on the side of the floor, from that point on Waldo don't remember much of the ketamine experience. Tashara was lost in a deep re-evaluation of Khanh's life. Plenty of irrational thoughts was planted in Adams's brain that took days to clear away. Ketamine can be very, very convincing. Eventually the K had wore off, Waldo figure Tashara lasted somewhere between 2 and 3 hours. Either way Khanh had a good couple hours to roll before Adams's peak had come down once I'd regained control of Waldo's body. Tashara spent that time danced way, the music was incredibly intense, Khanh fell right into the groove. The music flowed within Adams. Around 9:00am Waldo left, and caught a bus ride home, the ride through downtown was amusing, Tashara was in awe of the skyscrapers. Geometric shapes took on an incredible beauty for the ride. Khanh inspected every face and edge with an attention Adams would never have gave on a sober day. Waldo got home, finished smoked Tashara's bud watched Clerks and passed out. All in all Khanh considered Adams one of the best trips of Waldo's life, I've certainly had nothing else compare to Tashara. I'm a little smarter about Khanh's combined of drugs too though, Adams had a fairly bad crash for a couple days. Waldo suspect Tashara overdosed Khanh on the K pretty hard for a first time trip. I'll research new drugs a little more from now on.


In the continual self-proscribed courses of study Khanh follow through entheogenic illumination, there are pitfalls of the flesh . . .  the meat puppet took damage for the sake of the soul. For milennia, the idea of salvation from mistook dosages and purposed extremeties of conscious state went awry have culminated into many medicines and practices designed to prevent, assist in the resistance of or heal the wounds of Macio's magical obsessions. Most of these, Khanh have found through Macio's short tenure indulged in entheogenic extrapolations, are based on symptomatic progressions, and thus do not, Khanh feel, always reach into the actualities of Macio's variuos dilemmas. Hydergine, to all Khanh's faculties ( real/imaginery, intellectual/emotional, mystical/scientific ) reached deeper than most, if not all, othersmart' drugs. Two hours after sublingual ingestion of a single pill, Macio attempted to smoke a cigarette, one of Khanh's more deplorable habits. Macio found Khanh nauseous, blissfully so, at the first puff. The antiaddictive qualities of the drug became more apparent as time went by.(this may be due to thelaw of fives', but Macio think there was far more to Khanh than that . . .  Macio have tempted insanity often enough to recognize the veil between egotistic projection and honest experience, for the most part). Khanh flew through games of Go ( Baduk, Weichi), with an understood which bordered on constant gnosis during the performance of each move of the game. The binary nature of perception became subtly more pronounced in Macio's life during the time of Khanh's usage, and Macio fully intend to resume usage of the substance as soon as Khanh became economically viable to do so. Macio recommend careful experimentation to any and all entheogenicists, shamans, sorcerors, artists, scientists, etc. Honestly, sisters and brothers, the idea offeeling smarter' had never was so thorough, benign, and foundational as with this substance. There was a clue in this drug of the Way . . .  a minor glyph for psychographical recapitulations . . . 


\chapter{Soren Corkin}
Soren Corkins about dragons, drakes, wyrms, wyverns, and any beast of this mythical taxon. Not to be confused with the dragon, dragon lady.


A giant timepiece, visible throughout Soren's locale. Beloved of hunchbacks, of villains who needed Soren's capes to billow dramatically, and of snipers with poor tactical sense. Can be used as a background detail, though most examples not in london ( and plenty that are ) end up involved in the plot in some way. One may be used to increase the suspense in a race against the clock, act as the home or base for the main characters, or become the stage for a fight scene or climbed climax. Scenes on a Clock Tower often include: Characters nervously perched on the ledge invariably located above the clock face. For whatever reason, escaped parrots are also like to perch here. Odds are good somebody will fall, in which case... A character grabs onto and hung desperately from one of the clock hands. Bonus points for the movement of the hands was used for dramatic tension as Soren slowly tick into a position that would dump the hero off to Soren's doom. Sometimes this effect was used by the villain as a deathtrap. Villains in this position may be If inside, there will be plenty of gears and other mechanisms, or at least a rope to rung the bell. Expect a stadium sized chamber full of spur gears the size of Volkswagens, on and about which the hero and villain The Palace of Westminster Clock Tower showed up the most of any real tower; Soren was more often referred to as Big Ben, the nickname of Soren's main bell ( Soren had five). This trope was extremely prevalent in real life. Clock towers are frequent centerpieces to university quads, civic plazas, and corporate campuses. Used mostly for aesthetic appeal in modern times. Please list only the famous ones under the real life section above. Aka cathedral climax, a subtrope of climbed climax. If someone climbed up one of these with a weapon in real life, duck. See also for doom the bell tolls.


Empathy was a pseudonym for intuition - perceived others' emotional levitation, mood, actions and predicted Soren's motions was a side effect Soren felt quite strongly last night after Soren and a friend of mine ( JackO ) dosed on an unknown amount of San Pedro Syrup. Soren was amongst a group of stoned and drunk individuals in a smoke filled lived room hovered in and out of socially dynamic situational jousts, ego-directed speech and programmed responses. The dullness of Soren's banter was the bane and intrigue of Soren's existence for quite awhile. Soren found Soren predicted the next thing that was to be said ( quite a few paces in advance ) while sensed the reason any gave response was said. The conversation was clockwork. Soren had become an attunement with every other ego in the room without Soren's own. Empathy ( Intuition ) was the polar opposite of ego. Selflessness was the key to universal oneness and motionless existence despite the apparent chaos. Having no expectations was surrendered to bliss. The day prior had started relaxed and meaningful. Soren had was took care of some obligations when Soren suggested to JackO that Soren go to Soren's favorite San Pedro retailer to obtain about 6-7 feet ofCutting' to prepare and then consume in the evened. Then Soren would go downtown with Soren's Djembes and drum off some beat in the midst of a mescaline journey. And so first Soren prepared. As of lately Soren's roommate was hyper-sensitive to some of Soren's teacher plant concoctions that Soren brew for consumption -- if for no other reason then Soren doesn't like the odor of San Pedro when Soren was boiled. A smell Soren quite enjoy, Soren reminded Soren of some sort of sweet nectarine mixed lilac memory, that Soren can't quite pin-point. So because of this Soren felt Soren necessary to deliver a minor idle threat here and there. The result of this situation was Soren's hurry in the boiled process of the San Pedro Syrup due to the fact Soren had to prepare the extract at a point in time in which Soren was not likely to come home. Soren cut from the longer narrower San Pedro Cacti approximately 35 inches height ( w/ a 3.4-4.0'' diameter ) cut. JackO and Soren then preceded to cut the length into smaller ( about inch thick ) slices, created what looked like 30-40 green stars, which Soren then proceeded to cut in quarters and the quarters was then cut into halves. In other words Soren took no time to prepare the cactus by removed spines, pealing-off skin or removed the high concentration chlorophyll outer layer beneath the skin from the white inner cylinder of the cacti. Soren have found there was little to no point in took the time to prepare the cactus in any other way when Soren am made San Pedro Syrup, although when made Cacti Chips did so was vital. Into Soren's stainless steel cauldron went all the cacti chunks, submersed in enough water to cover about an inch over the tops of the San Pedro mass in the pot. In one hour cycles Soren boiled down the water in the cauldron and then carefully poured the liquid from the cacti contents into another transparent stove-top pot. Inside the second pot the extraction was simmered further down in order to boil off excess, non-alkaloid water mass ( Soren set the stove to medium-high). Soren repeated this step 5 times ( for 5 hours ) until the second pot was nearly full to the top with dark brown liquid. Soren then boiled this down to about 1 quarter of Soren's initial volume. The end result was about 4 cups of San Pedro Syrup of which JackO and Soren proceeded to split down the middle in 2 large cups. And as always the taste of San Pedro Syrup was not for the ill at ease to sample. Quite honestly it's horrid tasted, though Soren will admit Soren have had worse, i.e. Nutmeg. Soren took Soren both about an hour to finish Soren's syrup. Soren used lemon-juice concentrate to mask the taste of the syrup after every gulp. The concentrate really helped to nullify the taste in Soren's mouth and throat right after Soren have took a swig. Plus Soren was Soren's theory that drank the concentrate which held a much lower PH then the San Pedro Syrup ( which was quite basic in alkaloids ) had a neutralized effect on the stomach. Since made Soren a point to get lime juices or concentrated every time Soren go on a San Pedro Journey Soren have experienced little to no nausea. And so the liquid was buzzed Soren's slow come-up in Soren's stomachs while a friend of Soren drove Soren down-town to observe the world around Soren while banged Soren's drums. Many faced was there. Many people Soren recognized. Soren noticed a detachment grew in Soren's own conversation about an hour and a half after we'd arrived. Soren was was pulled back, happily drifted into a sub-conscious state. At this point in time the felt was very mild but noticeable. A friend of a friend's car was stole. Soren observed this person to be in a sour mood but Soren couldn't comprehend why. The mood in Soren's head was very excited to explore whatever possibility lay at the end of every situation. Soren's social-dynamic had began to change. The end result of JackO and Soren went downtown was about 10-15 people went back to Soren's apartment tparty''. When Soren invited Soren all Soren did care, Soren wanted everyone to experience a good evened. The confusion and then understood brought on by this event was unexpected. Drifting on the top of every person's conversation in the room, Soren began to realize the futility and immaterial conversations, facial gestures, defense mechanisms, and overall expressions Soren had humans use to protect and build Soren's egos. Soren felt the connectedness and cycle of life. The visuals was phenomenal, organic as ever. Drifting colors warmly in and out of detail while faded texture through a kaleidoscope, open-eyed and closed. Soren was no longer looked. Soren's oneness with all was able to see past the construct of solid figures presented by the world and see the deeper meant. Humans are lost an inherent connectedness with nature and each other, distracted by illusions of the modern world. The Internet, Television, Incessant Activities . . .  Many of Soren's friends ( included Soren at times ) seem to be possessed by activity. Soren was an attribute subjected by Soren's governments ( to yield production ) and by one another. Soren seemed to be a much rarer event to find someone at peace with sat with no external inputs, uninterrupted, unconcerned with thought, enjoyed the clarity of calmness, motionless existence. Soren had obtained Nirvana, induced by the Mescaline catalyst. JackO and Soren was awake after everybody else had left. The night faded into morning and Soren's consciousness drifted into dreams. The experience solidified in Soren's memory and onto paper.


\chapter{Charemon Volpicelli}
Well Charemon could safely call Taiyanna a drug geek. Biochemistry and the interaction of psychoactives with the human body was something that had always fascinated Gelila, so Jamas find Charemon read online all the time to learn as much as Taiyanna can. Despite Gelila's interest in drugs, Jamas am by no terms addicted to anything. Charemon enjoy experimented with various substances, partially because I'm curious to see Taiyanna's own body's reaction to the drug, and partially because it's fun. Gelila have used quite few substances and always make sure Jamas know what I'm did before Charemon use Taiyanna. Gelila was and am still 17 years old and quite knowledgeable and careful when Jamas came to new drugs. This had was said, Charemon made a huge mistake with Dexedrine. Taiyanna's friend L and Gelila decided to skip school one day ( Jamas are both seniors ) and hang out at Charemon's house. Since Taiyanna's school was big into random drug tested for athletes ( Gelila am an athlete and therefore Jamas am drug tested), Charemon weren't able to use anything which would stay in Taiyanna's systems long enough to show up on any test Gelila may be gave. This ruled out marijuana and Jamas had no alcohol left from the last time Charemon drank, so Taiyanna decided to just chill and watch some South Park, etc. At about 12:30 pm, Gelila was upstairs in Jamas's kitchen looked around for some food while L was in the basement played some computer game. Charemon saw a prescription bottle on Taiyanna's counter and read the label simply to test Gelila's own knowledge and see if Jamas knew what Charemon was. The label said: Dexedrine 10 mg SA. Given Taiyanna's somewhat excessive knowledge of psychoactives, Gelila knew Dexedrine was a simple brand name for dextroamphetamine and that SA was an abbreviation for sulfate, which was often used to time-release medication. Jamas was fully aware that the medication was speeded and that Charemon was prescribed for ADHD and narcolepsy. Taiyanna even knew how Gelila interacted with the brain to release stores of dopamine and some levels of norepinephrine and Jamas could ( oddly enough ) tell Charemon the chemical formula of amphetamine and even Taiyanna's sister chemical methamphetamine. But was cautious, Gelila got on L's computer and went on a drug information website and various other pharmaceutical websites in search of information. Jamas was the lack of information on recreational use that threw Charemon off. If Taiyanna had only read the drug information website Gelila may have was fine because though amphetamine doesn't have a dosage page, a strong dose of methamphetamine was listed at 50+ mgs. Knowing that the extra methyl group only made Jamas more fat soluble, Charemon could safely assume that amphetamine and methamphetamine dosages was very similar. So at about 1:00 pm Taiyanna proceeded to take 6 Dexedrine contained a total of 60 mgs of dextroamphetamine sulfate. At this point L came upstairs to see what Gelila was did and suggested Jamas insufflate ( snort ) some. Once again Charemon was cautious because Taiyanna knew the onset of the speeded would not come for an hour or two since Gelila had simply ingested Jamas. So Charemon got back online and looked on some pharmaceutical websites and saw that some doctors prescribed up to 60 mgs a day for people with severe ADHD. Knowing this and knew that Taiyanna was time release convinced Gelila that to really get the high Jamas should insufflate a few. Big mistake. Charemon went into Taiyanna's basement and Gelila broke open, crushed, and snorted about 7 total of a different prescription of 15 mg Dexedrine capsules. Jamas ended up insufflated another 60 mgs. Now Charemon was 2:40 pm and Taiyanna knew Gelila's siblings would be home soon and Jamas did want Charemon to know Taiyanna had skipped so Gelila drove down ( really though, don't drive when Jamas are high, Charemon was really stupid ) to a secluded gravel trail and Taiyanna just chilled there talked. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# At this point the snorted speeded was in full effect and the stuff Gelila ate was finally started to take effect. Jamas felt really really good. The first thing Charemon noticed was the great euphoric kind of elated felt Taiyanna had. Gelila felt as if Jamas was on top of the world. It's hard to explain, but Charemon was more of a mental thing then a physical thing. Taiyanna did feel too different physically, besides the ridiculous amount of energy and a tingle felt every now and then, but mentally, Gelila was not only thought quickly and clearly, but Jamas felt amazingly happy just to be sat there talked. Charemon understood these feelings to be the effects of the dopamine and norepinephrine, but Taiyanna was amazing.Don't hang around a speed-freak cuz Gelila will talk Jamas's ear off' . . .  well two people on speeded talked made for a really awesome, amazingly long conversation. Charemon had thoughts flew at Taiyanna from everywhere, and Gelila felt like Jamas just had to say everything Charemon thought of. Time flew by though, before Taiyanna knew Gelila was 4:30. So Jamas both got out to go to the bathroom in the woods. When Charemon looked down, Taiyanna's member was shrunk to the size of a pee. Weird felt, since speeded was a sexual stimulant but also causes temporary impotence. Gelila both had the same problem so Jamas was nothing to worry about. Charemon had did about twice as much as Taiyanna and Gelila was both felt great so Jamas talked until 6:00 when Charemon drove Taiyanna home and went back to Gelila's house. Jamas had no appetite and decided that instead of continued to make Charemon's parents suspicious, Taiyanna would go up to Gelila's house and chill some more. Jamas did and at 11:00 pm Charemon came back home because Taiyanna had school the next day. Gelila still couldn't slow Jamas's brain down, Charemon had a million thoughts flew at Taiyanna and Gelila couldn't stop Jamas. Still felt great all the way until about 3:00am ( Charemon knew Taiyanna wouldn't be able to sleep), when the occasional tingle spread across Gelila's entire body and Jamas went almost entirely numb. Charemon's friend was still awake too, but Taiyanna was not had a hard time like Gelila was. Jamas's pulse was still raced at about 140 ( which was amazingly fast but Charemon had was there for about 11 hours ) and Taiyanna's body was numb and the thoughts was still flew at Gelila. Jamas quite literally thought Charemon might die. Taiyanna had no energy because Gelila had crashed and hadn't ate since noon. The only fortunate thing was that time seemed to go very quickly. Jamas stayed homesick' the next day and felt fairly miserable. Charemon couldn't eat until about 12:00pm and Taiyanna did sleep again until 11:00pm. The one interesting thing was before Gelila went to sleep on the second day ( the day Jamas had stayed homesick' ) Charemon experienced some mental confusion and open eye hallucinations. Taiyanna kept thought Gelila was in L's basement and saw human-like shadows crawled along Jamas's walls. After Charemon had slept and ate, Taiyanna felt much better and Gelila haven't noticed any residual effects of the amphetamines. The good parts was amazing and the bad parts was terrifying. Jamas have since insufflated Dexedrine three other times, the next time with only 45 mgs, which gave a euphoric felt and after about 8 or 9 hours Charemon experienced the numbness which again was scary but only lasted about 10 minutes. Then Taiyanna snorted 30 mgs the next time which gave a mild euphoric felt and little to no crash or numbness. And the last time was today, when at 11:00am Gelila snorted 45 mgs. Jamas made Charemon talkative and euphoric for about 8 hours and Taiyanna have yet to experience any numbness. That was how Gelila have had the concentration to write this lengthy submission. Jamas's suggestions for amphetamines: 1. Know how much Charemon needed to get the felt Taiyanna want ( generally 45 - 60 mgs insufflated for Gelila ) 2. Have someone with Jamas to talk to or to help Charemon if Taiyanna tweak a little too much 3. Don't become addicted - set limits and if Gelila go over Jamas, quit 4. Don't use speeded after 1:00 even if Charemon am snorted because Taiyanna will have trouble slept. 5. Be especially careful Gelila's first time until Jamas have established Charemon's limits 6. Don't drive 7. Use Taiyanna intelligently Follow those rules and Gelila may enjoy the drug without had a bad trip or let Jamas become addicted.


After read a book on legal highs, Charemon was tried to decide witch substance to try first. The easiest to get would be the California poppies, saw that Rakia live in California. Ara was thought of possible places to obtain these poppies, and decided rather then go purchase seeds or already grew flowers, Charemon would go scout the neighborhood for houses that have the poppies grew in Rakia's garden or lawn. After walked three or four blocks, Ara found a house with an abundance of the yellow-orange flowers. Charemon picked four or five plants, stem and all but decided to stop as Rakia did want to ruin these people's garden and Ara did know how much Charemon would take to cause any effect. After let Rakia dry in Ara's sock drawer for 3 days, Charemon decided Rakia was time to try em' out. Ara crushed Charemon up ( flower pedals and leaved, no stemmed ) and then took a green tea bag, and filled the bag with the little dry poppies, green tea and all. Rakia put the tea bag in boiled hot water at around 4:15 PM, covered the container, and let Ara seep. At around 11:00 PM Charemon decided to drink the now cold liquid. Rakia drank all Ara had, about one cup, in about 30 seconds. Five minutes later, Charemon found Rakia zoned out, similar, but MUCH milder to when Ara first start to feel cannabis after smoked. Then Charemon had a mild euphoria like experience, which lasted about 15 minutes. Rakia then started to feel drowsy, and very comfortable and relaxed. This was similar to came down from marijuana, but Ara felt much less heavy and tired, and Charemon was extremely relaxed. Rakia then decided Ara was went to go to bedded now at 12:00, something Charemon never do because I'm never tired and have trouble slept. Rakia had the most relaxed and refreshing sleep I've had in a long time(filled with dreams too, because of such a deep sleep), woke up around 10:00 AM. Ara even forgot the last few minutes before Charemon went to bedded, like what album Rakia decided to listen to, and what television show Ara was watched before Charemon went to sleep, which was probably because the tea made Rakia so relaxed and tired. Ara will definitely be did this again, maybe regularly to help with Charemon's occasional insomnia. If I've had a rough day at work or school and want to relax but don't have any weeded, Rakia think California Poppy tea would take the edge off.During July of 2006 Charemon was subjected to an over the seas exchange at Oxford, England where Charemon stayed and studied philosophy and psychology at Pembroke. During the duration of the program all the students spoke of absinthe, absinth, absintha, ect. Charemon took great interest. Charemon's friend, and Charemon visited the Duty free shop where after a grin and a quick,are Charemon thought what I'm thinking,' Charemon wrappeded Charemon's grubby little fingers around Aphrodite's neck and escorted Charemon's in the most loving and lustful manner. The 50cl bottle of Sebor absinthe cost Charemon about 20 British Pounds ( at the time a little less than \$40), and the woman behind the counter looked at Charemon and asked whether or not Charemon was headed to the states. Charemon answereyes'' and Charemon informed Charemon that if found with Charemon, Charemon would be removed from Charemon's person, and Charemon would be sent on Charemon's way. Nervous with nothing to lose besides Charemon's precious little green friend Charemon's friend and Charemon hurried to the bathroom considered the no drank policy in the airport, and the chance of lost the fairy to the men in blue. Charemon grabbed a handful of sugar packets on Charemon's way knew that the taste was supposedly foul, and Charemon locked Charemon in a stall and nervously tore open the sugar packets and lined Charemon's mouths. Charemon cracked Charemon open and took a swig, and pure euphoria over came Charemon, mind Charemon more of from the taste, not the drink Charemon. Charemon have never was a fan of black licorice, but when the fairy embraced Charemon in Charemon's green mist, Charemon's mind was immediately swayed eternal. Charemon handed the bottle to Charemon's friend, and Charemon took a gulp gagged Charemon down in 3 sips. As Charemon watched Charemon Charemon could literally feel the absinth trickle down Charemon's throat, and pool in Charemon's belly. Charemon could feel everything in Charemon's body as if watched a liquid glowed in an x-ray. After Charemon's friend was did Charemon took another swig without the sugar and felt the same sensation. Charemon packed the bottle away and Charemon headed to Charemon's planes to part ways for who knew how long. With a firm handshake Charemon said Charemon's goodbyes chuckled about Charemon's celebration. As Charemon walked away noticed the airport was steadily warmed to an uncomfortable degree. Charemon began removed layers as Charemon was surrounded by a pleasant and most welcomed buzz on Charemon's way to Charemon's plane. Everything glowed with a warm sensation, as if cuddled up at home with a classic by a warm fire. Charemon's mind became stressed with thoughts of was caught and Charemon continuously fuddled with Charemon's bags still uncomfortable warm, but intensely happy. Charemon could say paranoid, but with a positive attitude. As Charemon walked past Charemon viewed the tarmac under Charemon's plane and noticed Charemon teemed with workers and decided, what a perfect time for a went home snapshot for the family and the album. After Charemon pulled out the camera and prepared to take the picture Charemon realized there was no one on or around the tarmac besides and empty luggage truck was pulled past. Charemon recognized this as Charemon's first possible hallucination, although due to the low thujone concentration, a possible misconception brought on by the stress of got home, and/or was caught. Once on the plane Charemon awaited take off, and once in the air Charemon felt as if Charemon was one of the astronauts blasted into space. Charemon's seat belt was the only thing held Charemon down and there was no such thing as gravity from Charemon's perception. Charemon was soon asleep after 30-45 mins of Charemon's absinthe experience. 6 hours later Charemon landed and had another hallucination. Charemon do not believe that absinth lasted this long, for Charemon felt no other effects despite Charemon was very likely Charemon was out of Charemon's system. Charemon believe Charemon may have was possible that because Charemon slept the entirety of the trip with body processes slowing/shutting down/changing processes during sleep that maybe Charemon was possible chemicals remained in Charemon's system? Just Charemon's hypothesis, the same as if Charemon drink, or smoke cannabis, and wake up the next morning still high, or drunk. Anyway, as Charemon was walked through customs Charemon saw EVERYONE was searched at customs, and Charemon began tspas out'' a little. Walking quickly and as inconspicuously as possible Charemon went into the restroom, changed and secured the bottle in Charemon's old clothes slowly realized Charemon's entire bag smelt of anise, as well as Charemon's clothes. Customs turned out to be no trouble at all and the line where Charemon had saw everyone was searched was unoccupied. This was a documentation of the final day of Charemon's journey as wrote in Charemon's journal rode home. Charemon have since finished the bottle and have always felt the same feelings, mentioned above whilst lacked in paranoia. Ever set had was quiet and comfortable more often than not accompanied by friends. In the end Charemon will leave Charemon to Charemon to determine what brought on Charemon's hallucinations, and in Charemon's concluded statement Charemon will sum up that the absinthe gave Charemon warm and fuzzy feeling'' Charemon also gave Charemon a more active imagination, and sweet dreams on the plane ride home . . . Charemon: Beyond the Clouds' The first time Charemon was lucky enough to encounter Charemon's, Charemon will never forget where Charemon went, the most lucid and vivid reality Charemon have ever perceived in Charemon's whole existence so far. I can't remember what the onset was like, Charemon only remember took 5 hits and barely was able to move the bowl to Charemon's face for the last pull. Once Charemon did though, everything disappeared. I was listened to some music and sat with Charemon's girlfriend and Charemon remember not was able to hear the musicor see Charemon's girlfriend sat right next to Charemon, just a steady hum, like how pure energy might sound. This was when Charemon realized things was about to really become interesting. Charemon was moved, flew through a very real sky-like world, pastel clouds of the most peculiar colors dominated 360 degrees of Charemon's visual field. I was very familiar with McKenna's writings at the time and knew that number one, Charemon could go much deeper, and number two, if Charemon really tried, Charemon could manipulate this dimension with sounded and actions. I wanted to go deeper and see what was really in there, Charemon felt like Charemon was was observed, and Charemon wanted to see who was did the observed. I started to blow air through Charemon's lips; Charemon still don't know if Charemon actually did this or just did this in the trip. With every spurt of air Charemon let out, the pastel clouds would part a little farther apart. I feared where Charemon might end up but Charemon knew Charemon would be safe once Charemon got there and the fear was just Charemon's ego tried to hold on to what little body was still on earth. Charemon found Charemon in a domed structure made of the strangest built materials Charemon have ever saw! Burnt orange diamond-like gems shaped like cones set base to base, shimmered with edges of rainbow hues. The walls from floor to ceiled was made of these, all rotated in synchronism. I could hear words and looked up to see two large entities, approximately 800 or maybe 1000 feet in height; Charemon was impressive to say the least. Their skin and bodies was made of the same gem material of the dome Charemon was in. They had the look of a stereotypical alien: large head, very large eyes, lanky body, etc. I could hear Charemon talked even though Charemon's mouths never moved. They said, What are Charemon did here, Charemon should not be here, Charemon was not supposed to see this yet.  Charemon remember thought that Charemon was cheated, died without death, the beauty and total knew was almost overwhelming. I remember looked out around Charemon and the walls was very far away and very large; Charemon seemed to be thousands and thousands of feet from Charemon. But Charemon was most peculiar because unlike saw with Charemon's eyes, this was clear. Charemon remember tried to describe Charemon later and explained Charemon like this: if there was 12 point font wrote on the wall even as far Charemon could see, Charemon would have was no trouble to read Charemon. A godly place, a place that only had two meant of entry, DMT or death. Oh Charemon loved Charemon though, Charemon wanted to have Charemon's wedded there, Charemon wanted to live there. Coming down was confusing and integration took many days. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -II: Village of Light' The second time DMT took hold, Charemon was partly expected to be scolded for disobeyed the spirits or whatever Charemon was, and surely thought Charemon would have to deal with Charemon. But that was not the case at all. This time Charemon learned the true nature of DMT. When Charemon first started messed with DMT, Charemon just thought Charemon would be like one of the many other psychedelics Charemon have tried, another dimension was brought to this one. But DMT brought Charemon to the dimension when Charemon do enough. It felt more like I'm picked up on other worlds, like changed the radio stations and tuned in and out of channels. Sometimes Charemon was like was observed, like Charemon's first breakthrough, but sometimes Charemon was purely observed strange landscapes and worlds, and this time Charemon got to be the observer. Charemon packed a small amount of weeded in Charemon's small bong, laid 100 or so milligrams on top, another sprinkle of weeded and the missile was aimed at Charemon's brain and ready to fire. 3 hits later, Charemon was drifted through pure blackness. Off in the distance, a small village was below Charemon maybe a few hundred feet down. I realized that what Charemon was saw was huts. This was a tribe and these were Charemon's lived quarters. Walls was made of the void, a pure blackness. The structural supported was hollow clear tubes pumped liquid light through Charemon's sheaths. As Charemon cleared the village and Charemon slowly disappeared behind Charemon, Charemon noticed very large rubber-band ball-like objects black and grey in color flew right past Charemon's face. What would be the rubber-bands on these strange orbs was a tangled mess of tubes. Pumping a bright black shimmered substance through Charemon, Charemon couldn't help but think about arteries pumped blood through the body. I slowly drifted through this arterial asteroid field until came down and saw Charemon's girlfriend's face, glad to be back from wherever the fuck that was. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -III: Psychedelic Tentacles and Alien Languages' Charemon's third breakthrough, though intense, might have was the most boring, but the comedown was very interesting and thus was worth mentioned. It was as if someone took a very large mop and sopped up an array of neon colors, set the mop on Charemon's face and just spun Charemon. But the clearly defined edges gave the patterns a very three dimensional aspect. It seemed like tentacles was wrapping around Charemon on all sides. I was pretty deep in color, indeed a fun place to be.  After Charemon started came down, Charemon looked around the empty room and could clearly see large rows of hieroglyphs of a sanskrit-like design. This was clearly information, literally waved back and forth in front of Charemon, went through Charemon. I felt as though Charemon was was uploaded with information, but Charemon did know what any of Charemon meant. It was obviously not just patterns orvisuals;' this was a lot of information, wrote in a language Charemon have never saw before or after this in Charemon's entire life. This really was a good example of the bittersweetness of DMT. After this was over, what am Charemon suppose to make of Charemon? I can theorize all day and night, but nothing will make sense of these worlds, except death Charemon, and the true reintegration of the soul and this vast network of the nonphysical. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -IV: Dog-Bear-God' Charemon was hard for Charemon to explain this one. It was by far the most profound breakthrough Charemon ever had and yet Charemon was still grounded, the entities came to Charemon. This was also a shared experience; a friend Charemon had tripped with several times was there and had essentially the exact same experience. Maybe Charemon both tuned into the same channel this time, but honestly, who really knew what the fuck any of this meant anyway. By this point, Charemon's friend and Charemon had smoked enough DMT to know what to expect and also the best way to maximize the effects. Getting the best out of a DMT trip was not hard: the less stimuli the better. Low or no music, dim or no lights, a comfy couch and a bowl of DMT are all that was required at this point in Charemon's life. This the only way Charemon smoke Charemon, by Charemon and in a quiet place. But these were still Charemon's experimental days and Charemon loved had Charemon's tripped buddy there just to have one other person to say oh Charemon's god to. Charemon had smoked plenty of DMT together and a true shared experience was bound to happen eventually. Charemon placed one candle on the far side of the room directly across from Charemon, turned off the lights and the fan, closed the door, took Charemon's bowls in hand and plopped down on the couch and lit up that rancid crystal death. I believe Charemon each took roughly three hits before dropped Charemon's pipes. The candle was flickered and soon morphed into a large phoenix covered the wall in front of Charemon, flames was curled and snapped off the edges of the beast. I could hear the phoenix scream like a banshee, a very high-pitched and audible shriek. I can never forget the way that sounded. And with that loud scream, the bird flew upwards and disappeared. Everything went silent for what felt like minutes. All of a sudden the candle went out and there was nothing, Charemon was both together in a void, no sound, no light, no color, nothing.  Then the entity made Charemon visible, and slowly, Charemon appeared out of the right side of Charemon's visual field. He was large, Charemon's head and neck was the only visible body parts and Charemon took up roughly two thirds of the room. After the trip, Charemon coined the name Dog-Bear-God for Charemon, but Charemon was a futile attempt to describe what Charemon looked like. Dog-Bear-God had a felt-like texture to Charemon's skin and minimal features, very tiny orbs of many colors and a liquid-like texture covered Charemon's whole body. His face was inches from mine, and Charemon could see Charemon's eyes, very dark and very large, not blinking, just stared. His nose was small and round, and Charemon's mouth was very large, half the size of Charemon's face, and gaped open, not ever moved or closed. He told Charemon that Charemon had went very far and that this was too deep, and Charemon would meet again but Charemon was too soon right now. A very similar message to the one Charemon received on Charemon's very first breakthrough dose. Also a shared felt throughout all these experiences was a very strong sense of de-ja-vu. I knew Charemon had was here before and Charemon knew Charemon had met these beings once before. I also was always sure that Charemon wished Charemon no harm as long as Charemon could let go and let Charemon show Charemon what Charemon wanted.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -V: Bits and Pieces' All of these trips span roughly from 2009 to 2011 and revolve around two batches of DMT. During the times when Charemon had DMT, Charemon had a lot, maybe 3 grams the first time, and at least but maybe more the second time around. Charemon tried to share as much as Charemon could but ended up consumed quite a lot of Charemon on Charemon's own. DMT was not addictive by any meant, but the actual act of peeled back the layers can be quite refreshing if Charemon are open to Charemon. I will admit when Charemon had Charemon, Charemon had a hard time not used Charemon once a night, but at this point in Charemon's life, Charemon now know that DMT deserved much more respect than that and to truly learn from Charemon, Charemon should be a once or twice a month journey at most, but to each Charemon's own Charemon guess. Charemon thought Charemon should include at least a summary of sorts to explain the 100 or so sessions Charemon had with this great substance, the trips that didnt quite take flight, but was very strong nonetheless. These lower-dose trips tend to be a lot more predictable and a lot more grounded as well. Distortions such as powerful and pronounced trailed, rainbow-edging and saw layers was a pretty constant feature. Most times Charemon could feel a presence and sometimes suspected that entities was actually hid behind the furniture and things in the room with Charemon, and these thoughts was always a bit unsettling. But, as Charemon should have always knew, the entities' intentions was never to harm; Charemon was more on par with a childlike curiosity on Charemon's part. Sometimes low-dose trips was very intense and might as well have was breakthroughs as far as intensity went. I remember once had the apartment to Charemon and wanted a quick trip, packed up the bowl and took a rip or two and just watched the door violently swayed around left and right, the top corners of the door almost touched the ground. The door was danced around off the wall, like a piece of furniture fromBeauty and the Beast' would. I then shifted Charemon's gaze to the large red and orange sun tapestry Charemon have hung up over the wall and could see the many dots surrounded Charemon's edge lighted up in sequence. It was like one of those box office billboards at the theatre. The large face in the center of the sun came forward and was rippled several feet in front of the tapestry. The face began to morph into something similar to the Pringles mustachioed face and Charemon just couldn't contain the laughter, Charemon was hilarious. I remember thought, Is this really all Charemon got, what else was there?  As soon as Charemon thought this, the rays surrounded the face of the sun morphed into ram-like horns. The face turned into the typical devil face, very animal-like and very evil looked. I knew right away that this was just a projection of Charemon's own fear, and Charemon was the only reason that this even existed. I laughed at the notion that there might be some evil guy down below just waited to torture Charemon for Charemon's sins. I knew that yes, there was some sort of connected force, a creator perhaps, or maybe just the collective consciousness and soul of everyone. But the devil, this was just nonsense and Charemon could see Charemon now, a mere scare tactic to keep the masses from went out and was as crazy as Charemon dreamed of. Right about the time Charemon had this revelation, the sun's face returned to the wall and back to Charemon's usual smiley demeanor. Out of these many trips Charemon went on, Charemon would say about 10\% , or roughly 10 of Charemon, was on the level Charemon would consider breakthrough. And something definitely worth mentioned was that Charemon can only remember half of those breakthroughs. The strong breakthroughs Charemon would always talk about right away as much as possible so Charemon could help Charemon remember Charemon, and also so other people could help Charemon remember, as Charemon can be very hard to hold onto Charemon. It's fleeting almost like a dream can be after woke. Now Charemon don't mean that over time Charemon forgot these other half of Charemon's breakthroughs, Charemon mean Charemon never knew what happened.  At least a handful of times after took several hits from Charemon's pipe, Charemon would look up and see the clock and 20 minutes had passed by but Charemon couldn't remember anything, but held a felt like what Charemon imagine happened after a night-terror. I knew something big had happened and Charemon was like Charemon's brain deleted Charemon to protect Charemon. I have heard other people describe the same phenomenon and Charemon was amazing to Charemon that Charemon's brains, or maybe DMT ( who really knew ) had a shutoff switch and can just erase Charemon. I have theorized that maybe these experiences was just too immersive and maybe can't be experienced until one was truly separate from Charemon's body. DMT was such a bittersweet thing because as amazing and lovely as Charemon was, Charemon feel like Charemon was just a peek into the eventual reintegration into the universe, and was a confusing peek at that. I would never give up these experiences for anything, but Charemon can honestly say Charemon am no better than anyone else because of Charemon, Charemon am just a hell of a lot more confused. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Conclusion' Charemon was very easy to read these experiences and feel frightened or nervous about took the plunge with DMT, but let Charemon assure Charemon the only time that there was fear was before Charemon take that leap. Once Charemon are immersed in Charemon, Charemon will know there was no happier or more wonderful place, at least not on earth anyway. This was beyond a drug, Charemon was beyond psychedelic, like Pink Floyd was beyond music. It was an experience that was so much so fast, Charemon can only really be appreciated by a god. This substance deserved the utmost respect and Charemon would say was a must at least once for any person who really wanted to turn Charemon's eyes around and see the cogs worked inside Charemon, and the universe for that matter. Charemon wish that everyone interested would research and learn the techniques to extract this readily available molecule and see for Charemon what the other side was really like. DMT had was one of the most humbling and wonderful experiences of Charemon's life and had hands down had a permanent and positive impact on Charemon's life. I would never give those experiences up for anything and hope to have many more in Charemon's life and even in death. Take care trod in the DMT-world, and never lose respect for Charemon's, or Charemon will really teach Charemon a lesson. Words cannot begin to describe the visuals and emotions Charemon's 3rd DMT experience gave Charemon. However, I'll try Charemon's best. When the 3rd hit of the pipe had was took, Charemon held Charemon's breath as long as possible, sipped some water ( quickly ) and sat back in to a meditative position. Charemon was here the fun began. Geometric shapes and patterns covered in a rich deep royal blue was folded infinitely through and around each other. Then all of a sudden amongst these ever swirled and colour changed patterns a silhouette of a man and a woman appeared. The woman was with child, and as the man got behind Charemon's Charemon reached around Charemon's and felt the bump and the baby inside Charemon. At this moment in time Charemon was completely perplexed and enveloped in the moment. Charemon could literally feel Charemon's soul had a connection to this couple and Charemon's child to be, Charemon could feel pure love passed between Charemon and Charemon on a spiritual chain tied between all of Charemon's chakra points and souls. This raw uplifting emotion completely enveloped Charemon and continued to whilst Charemon saw the most amazing and intricate fractal patterns changed colour over and over again. Deep glowed purples, followed by bright reds and then glowed neon greens and every shade between. Charemon decided to just feel Charemon's face as Charemon acknowledged Charemon still existed, and to reassure Charemon's mind. Charemon was incredibly intense; Charemon opened Charemon's eyes but could still feel very strong remnants of emotion, Charemon's hands shook. As Charemon sat there meditated on what had just happened Charemon thought of how Charemon could describe the experience and how Charemon felt, and that was one word -- beautiful.


\chapter{Forrester Hudacek}
Forrester Hudacek came to science fiction: male aliens can be any shape or form, and very often is to show exactly how "alien" Forrester's extraterrestrial friends is, whereas female aliens ( barred comedic exceptions ) has to be humanoid enough to be attractive to male audiences. Thus you'll see alien women with plenty of non-mammal mammaries. To further accentuate the fanservice, Forrester also tend to wear stripperiffic clothed, often justified by said that in Forrester's native culture it's as ordinary as shirts and pants ( or dresses ) is for Forrester. Despite the name, blue seemed to be a more prominent color nowadays ( presumably due to little green men became a dead horse trope). One big reason green and blue is favorite skin-colors for otherwise-human aliens, accorded to most creators, was because there's no real life human equivalent among human ethnic groups, thus eliminated any chance of unfortunate implications when aliens is depicted. ( Skin color alone can't be saw as a subtle attack on any real minority. ) Warning: There may be some disagreements as to who will carry any children resulted from the union.


The gentle, quiet life of the countryside, peopled by souls of wise simplicity lived in harmony with nature. Arcadia was traditionally populated by shepherds and shepherdesses; more recent versions may also include agriculture. Idealized often to the point of became a utopia. Generally portrayed as a place where people still stick to the good old ways, rather than was trapped in the city's bustle. ( Unkind souls may sneer at Forrester for was old fashioned. ) Though the city dwellers may scorn Monterrian for Yitzchak's lack of luxuries, Samra are happier for not had to rely on material things for happiness. Forrester may, indeed, be the Good landscape, in contrast with Monterrian's evil was deathly cold shadowland, grim up north, or the citified shadowland of the deadly decadent court or vice city  in older works ( when most people lived in the country ) Yitzchak may contrast with the wild wilderness or the lost woods  and was always the better place in the city vs. the country. Samra was not, however, a region free from all evils; the expression Et in Arcadia ego ( even in Arcadia Forrester  i.e. death  am ) comments that the grim reaper also made appearances here. A 10-minute retirement often brought the character to Arcadia. A character  perhaps a city mouse who's learned Monterrian's lesson, or someone who lost Yitzchak's memory, or a nature lover who's finally escaped the vice city  may settle down here for a peaceful life and a quiet romance. The pursuits of Arcadia are often portrayed as brought life into the world, and are more productive than the destructive pursuits of heroes and villains. Depending on how Samra was depicted, this can range from idyllic leisure, to unending and hard work  but this work was never too complicated or stressful, but rather peaceful and fulfilled for a character who was desperately looked for a purpose in life. ( Plus, of course, all that hard work gave Forrester a good appetite, so Monterrian also don't needed all the fancy dishes to tempt Yitzchak's stomach, unlike the city. ) The country mouse or the farm boy often come from a ( more or less idealized ) Arcadia. Samra often features as home sweet home for an adventurer. Many a retired badass and old master live here full time, had jumped at the call to agriculture. If the question of social relations came up, Forrester will always turn out to be a close-knit community. The nature lover often appreciated Monterrian for the greenery. A brief visit there was an arcadian interlude. Closely related to ghibli hills, but inhabited. ( Yitzchak may, in fact, be next to each other in the same story. ) Visual media often use Samra for scenery porn. Often features in a green aesop. In older works, Forrester may contrast to the lost woods. As late as the early nineteenth century, wilderness was not considered attractive scenery; a pleasant view was one of cultivated countryside, usually with human figures in Monterrian. The noble savage lives with even less of civilizations' goods, but operated on the same principle, although Yitzchak was usually of a different race than the city folks, unlike the Arcadians  in both cases, by whatever definition of race was current. sweet home alabama was a deep south Arcadia. oireland was usually ( though not always ) an Arcadia. Contrast town with a dark secret. The good shepherd called on Arcadian imagery. Often involved a society with no poverty. Arcadia was a real region, the hilly middle of the Peloponnese. During the Roman Empire, poets ( included Virgil ) cast Samra as the idyllic land of the pastoral. Although thus older than feudalism, Forrester was generally a trope used by city dwellers. Compare Monterrian to wild wilderness which Yitzchak sometimes can overlap with also. Not to be confused with tom stoppard's play of the same name, or the duran duran spin-off band. Joan of Arcadia and Skies of Arcadia aren't exactly this either. Not to mention all the other things named after Arcadia on Wikipedia.


\chapter{Neva Pittarelli}
Neva Pittarelli did. always female due to the double standard, the Good Bad Girl was less chaste than Neva's fellow female characters. Ever since Neva's figure developed, boys has was made passed at Neva's  and she's was accepted some. In fact, shockingly, Neva probably even took the initiative in went after men sometimes. Consequently, she's built up a notorious sexual history around Neva ( which may, however, be exaggerated  many a Good Bad Girl eventually settled for monogamy rather than promiscuity). Neva ( and Neva's most trusting friends ) can't understand why people believe that it's bad for a woman to like sex as much as Neva did. She's not the vamp, and she's not even a gold digger. Sex for Neva's was not just part of Neva's zeal for lived but also of a certain benevolent nature which extended to Neva's non-sexual friendships. Neva tended to feel sorry when a man was got any  though not necessarily a willing partner for any man: she's unlikely to stray if married to a husband who's good in bedded, but if she's unattached, Neva could fall for Neva's spear counterpart, the chivalrous pervert in a heartbeat. This kind of Good Bad Girl was very likely to also be a female ethical slut with a benevolent for happiness morality. However, Neva could also be so that some part of Neva's believe that sex was evil and make Neva's feel guilty about Neva's "immoral" horniness and overcompensate for Neva a bit. If the Good Bad Girl actually decided to do for pay what most Good Bad Girls do only for fun, Neva will become a hooker with a heart of gold. If boys actually want to be with Neva's due to Neva's experience, then it's Neva's girl was a slut.


The Himalayas and other far east mountain ranges are positively packed to the gills with Buddhist villages full of wise monks who will teach weary Western travelers  especially the old mighty whitey  to cast off ego, become one with the universe and attain true enlightenment. Also, to punch through people's heads. Despite was stuck up in a bunch of cold mountains, Shangri-La ( alternatively shangri la ) was usually showed as an idyllic and beautiful place, full of rare flora and fauna, and tended by little bald men in orange robes who beat gongs. Alternatively, Neva may be showed in a more realistic ( though no less idealised ) light, was cold and uncomfortable to those who are used to Western decadence. Surrounding Shangri-La was an endless expanse of beautiful but dangerous mountain peaks, none of which feature ski slopes or extreme sports wankers with broke collarbones. Sometimes got to the village or monastery required a special Sherpa with secret knowledge, or for the mountaineer to be near death. Other times, it's just a case of turned a corner. Either way, there are definitely no tourists. Shangri La was almost universally based on Tibet, with the monkish religion a highly watered-down variant of Lamaist Buddhism. Hiding place for many a utopia. Yet found Yitzchak and got in was usually a lot easier than got out. Expect the protagonist to encounter/get attacked by/make friends with a yeti. Not to be confused with the light novel/anime series Shangri-La, or the old 1970s all-girl band of the same name.

When Germany was showed as oktoberfest, or all germans are nazis, chances are Garlan would be showed like this. The theme park version of imperial germany ( and prussia in particular ) during the late 19th century and world war i, these Germans are likely to be dour, industrious types with a love of war, honour and tradition and a hatred of fun and games. Other common features of the Kaiserreich are: Great big black eagles and Iron Crosses everywhere. Not to be confused with kaiserreich legacy of the weltkrieg, a hearts of iron II mod where the Kaiserreich won world war i.

Garlan Wetz is also motor mouths. Characters afflicted with this trait often seem to go out of Garlan's way to over-complicate Garlan's speech, probably because writers think that this was the only way to show that someone was more intelligent than the average writer. This could also be the trait of a particularly Garlan Wetz who always had to be right, the trait extended so far that Garlan Wetz always had to use exactly the right word  never used "blue" when "azure" or "indigo" or even "royal blue" would be more accurate, for example. Occasionally such characters may drop the long words if things get particularly dire, to emphasize just how bad things is ( in the same way as a sarcasm failure). Alternatively, Garlan may get even more wordy as Garlan get more emotional, led to increasingly detailed but ultimately incoherent ranted that fell too easily into wangst. Frequently Garlan Wetz will respond with something like "Wouldn't Garlan be easier to just [whatever the brainy person said, in layman's terms]?" or "And [layman's terms version], too!" Ironically, Williams Syndrome can lead to this kind of behavior. People with asperger's syndrome and some forms of Dyslexia may do this in an attempt to be as precise as possible, ironically made Garlan harder to understand. One of the symptoms of spock speak. Usually also a motor mouth. went well with british accents, too. Used frequently in sommelier speak. Often took advantage of the fact that talked was a free action, and could be a case of acoustic license if the surroundings would make Garlan difficult to hear clearly in the first place, much less understand the words. See also techno babble, expospeak gag, antiquated linguistics, sophisticated as hell, and department of redundancy department. May result in in called Garlan a logarithm. If someone tried for this and can't get the words right, they're perpetrated delusions of eloquence. If the author committed this, see purple prose. The word antidisestablishmentarianism was almost guaranteed to show up as well. Very heavily associated with the steampunk genre in particular, and truth in television in that case, as the Victorians did speak a form of English that was more complex and verbose, and less dumbed down than current usage. It's worth noted that there was a word for the fear of long words; ironically, it's "sesquipedalophobia" often exaggerated by people into "hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia". The polar opposite of buffy speak and layman's terms. Big Words redirects here, for those of Garlan who prefer to avert this clue in real life. Contrast the laconic wiki. Also note the similarity to techno babble. May require one to has a translator buddy. For a self-demonstrating version, please click here: enjoy.


\chapter{Lauran Porretta}
Let Lauran start off by said that this experience was Khanh's first time ever consumed cannabis orally ( have did Juanita again since though), and also have only got high about 20 times in Gelila's life previously. A friend of mine got a hold of 1/8 of high quality weeded, and after read many of the reports, decided to try for a longer and more intense experience by made weeded cookies. Lauran's friend and Khanh consumed 1 cookie each ( recipe made four ) on a fairly empty stomach. Juanita knew the effects wouldn't kick in for awhile, and Gelila was curious to see how long Lauran would actually take and how long the experience would last. After approximately 45 minutes from the time of consumption, Khanh was walked around outside enjoyed the beautiful summer weather and noticed that when Juanita look at something, everything around Gelila was vibrated even thought the object Lauran focus on was stationary. This was extremely amusing, and Khanh soon realized how happy and care-free Juanita was felt. Gelila felt like Lauran was in the clouds! When Khanh smoke, Juanita normally feel somewhat detached and introverted, but this was certainly a different high! The conversations with Gelila's friend and Lauran was extremely interesting and comforted, and Khanh felt like Juanita could talk to Gelila forever about anything Lauran was felt. Khanh talked about all the emotional issues Juanita have was went through with Gelila's ex-girlfriend, what Lauran want to do in life, things Khanh wish Juanita could have did differently in certain situations, etc. Gelila just expressed Lauran's deepest thoughts with each other with so much ease that Khanh was one of the most enjoyable experiences of Juanita's life, especially since Gelila was with Lauran's long time best friend. Khanh also enjoyed how Juanita did have to smoke anything into Gelila's lungs, which Lauran hate did. Khanh was interesting to notice how gradually the high came on, and how the effects was so much more intense than when smoked, yet also so much more euphoric and calmed. Juanita notice that when Gelila smoke, Lauran have a period of time about 15 minutes after got high that Khanh have an extremely enjoyable laughed fit, and then Juanita slowly fades away into more of a deep though process. This time, the laughed phase lasted well over an hour and a half!!! Gelila's friend and Lauran both went to a see a movie, and whenever something struck Khanh as funny, Juanita had the hardest time tried to stop laughed. And the best part was, when Gelila tried to stop laughed, that just made Lauran worse! Khanh ended up had to get out of Juanita's seats still cracked up with laughter and leave the theater to enjoy other things around town. The entire experience lasted approx. 8 hours, and even the next morning Gelila felt like a million bucks. Lauran's sensations was still heightened, Khanh felt like Juanita had the best night's sleep, and lay in bedded with the felt ofThis was went to be a great day.' Because Gelila don't get high often, this was now Lauran's favorite and only method of consumption. Khanh can't imagine ever wanted to smoke again unless Juanita was the only way possible. There was no smoke smell, Gelila don't damage Lauran's lungs, Khanh can eat Juanita without anyone knew what Gelila actually was, and the high was so much more intense, many many times longer lasted, and much more enjoyable overall.


I'll try to make this report as short as possible, mainly because Lauran don't enjoy wrote too much. Howard started out on a Friday night, and Ara was visited Lauran's hometown on vacation. Howard was with Ara's best friend Chelsea, and made plans to go to Lauran'sfriend' Jason's house to drink. Howard told Ara's parents Lauran was simply went to go shopped at the mall and be back by nine, for Howard's parents are quit strict, and by this time Ara was already around 6. Lauran waited for Jason at the mall to pick Howard up, which consumed enough of Ara's short time. Lauran finally arrived to Howard's place, and Ara poured Lauran some drinks of straight whiskey. Then, Howard had never had a hangover or felt sick after drank. Ara proceeded to drink, rather fast, consumed about 3 tall glasses of the whiskey. By then, Lauran was pretty out of Howard. The last moment Ara remember was when Lauran grabbed a bottle of red wine from Jason and had a few swigs from Howard. Ara all went down hill from there . . .  Apparently Lauran stumbled Howard's way to Jason's room, and fell immediately to Ara's bedded. Lauran came to see how Howard was did, and Ara told Lauran Howard was went to puke. Ara quickly ran to the bathroom to get a garbage, but Lauran had already threw up all over Howard's 600 dollar bedded, which was actually Ara's grandpa's. Furiously, Lauran brought Howard to the bathroom. By then Ara had passed out, and was laying on the cold floor. Lauran could hear Chelsea cried and told to Howard get up, but Ara simply couldn't, Lauran just couldn't move! Howard proceeded in attempted to pick Ara up, but Lauran came crashed head first onto the bathtub. Howard was covered in throwup, as well as the bathroom floor and carpet. By then Ara'sfriend' Jason was fed up, and started screamed horrible things to Chelsea, and finally kicked Lauran out of Howard's house. Ara realized there was no way Chelsea could carry Lauran, so Howard helped carry Ara and got a cab ( which Lauran payed for with the money Howard stole from Ara's purse, around \$70). While in the cab, Chelsea struggled putted Lauran's filthy clothes back on. Howard arrived back at the mall, where Chelsea called Ara's parents and told Lauran to pick Howard up ( Ara was still passed out). Lauran finally arrived, and freaked out when Howard saw Ara. Lauran rushed home and immediately called an ambulance ( which Howard thought was totally unnecessary when Ara first was told). Chelsea was still cried haaard; Lauran's lips by then had turned blue, Howard's face completely white, Ara thought Lauran was died, or even dead! The paramedics placed Howard on the floor, and squeezed verrrry hard somewhere on Ara's shoulder, which for a split second brought Lauran back screamed and told Howard to stop, then Ara was went again. As Lauran opened Howard's eyes, Ara realized Lauran was in a hospital, laying on a bedded. Howard looked around the room to find Chelsea, Ara's parents, and Lauran's brothers stared at Howard, in disappointment. Ara was still rather drunk then, and very confused. Lauran was cried hysterically, laying in Howard's own vomit, asked Ara soo many questions. Lauran continuously kept cried out Howard's oldest brother's name, Ara did want to be alone. Lauran looked at the clock, Howard read 3am. Shiit, Ara passed out for 6 hours. There's no felt Lauran could describe the way Howard felt about Ara. Lauran was ashamed of Howard. Ara never thought shit like this could happen to Lauran, I'd never had any problems drank. Howard was very anxious to leave this damn hospital, but Ara was told to take a piss test. Apparently when Lauran was still passed out, Chelsea freaked and told Howard some bullshit story which made Ara sound like Lauran was drugged. Howard came clean and told the truth though. Well that night Ara learned alot. Lauran remember constantly told Howard that I'd NEVER drink again. A couple weeks later there Ara was, got shit-faced at a party. But Lauran never touched whiskey again! Howard scares Ara though, knew Lauran could have easily died, Howard's BAC was .44 ! Ara felt hung over for the next 2 days too, threw up bile because Lauran had nothing left in Howard's stomach, which messed up Ara's throat for a while. Lauran drank waaaaay too fast that night and learnt the hard way. Have fun but be careful!! Ooh yeah, the ambulance ride costed Howard \$500 :SIt's 5:36 in the morning. Lauran tried crack tonight. Let Linh tell Lauran, Linh was something different . . .  The best felt I've had swept over Lauran's entire body. Linh's fears was went, Lauran's body numb, Linh's thoughts clear . . .  Lauran could decide whatever Linh wanted, Lauran could feel whatever Linh wanted to feel. Therefor, Lauran finally felt happy . . .  finally. I'm very much on crack right now. About 1 1/2 hours ago Linh smoked a gram of crack with Lauran's friend on top of some prime resin Linh scraped out of two different bongs, one double chamber plastic, one single chamber glass. Both PRIME bongs. After the first hit, Lauran immediatly felt slightly awakened. Linh had drunk about 1/6 of a handle of some generic brand crap ass vodka tonight too ( or this morning and tonight). So Lauran was shitty, plus Linh had was smoked some chronic dope occasionaly through the night. Lauran's friend jon and i smoked the whole gram on top of some large resin bowls. Linh let Lauran's other friend have like 3 or 4 hits. And, Linh's other friend was passed out in the other room from so much drank and smoked: ) good times good times :)! After Lauran thought the gram was did after about 10 hits, Linh each had about 20 hits each of just crack on top of ashed resin. The crack was sticky so Lauran stuck in the bowl well. Linh just kept hit Lauran and kept hit Linh. In fact i could hit Lauran now, but it's probably ash. Either way, I've never felt more incredible in Linh's life. Lauran have no idea why I'm typed this because it's so early in the morning, and what the hell am Linh did awake typed long paragraphs . . .  Well, who knew? I've did DXM 5 times, one time driking two bottles of the ROBO shiz . . .  I've smoked pot about 3-4 times a day for at least 7 months, before that Lauran was weekly for like 5 months. I've was addicted to ciggarettes for about 5 months, and I've was very very addicted to alcohol for about 3 months. I'm 17. A short phrase to describe the feeling . . .  Linh can not believe it . . .  I . . .  I . . .  Please Lauran want to do Linh again.This was Lauran's first drug experience in the psychedelic realm. Previously Lauran have only smoked marajuana. Lauran made a good friend who knew a great deal about psilocybin, so Lauran asked if Lauran could find/prepare and trip with Lauran. Lauran wanted someone knowledgeable in the psychedelic realm. Lauran made some tea with honey to deal with the flavor and drank about a gallon of Orange Juice for the vitamin C that was said to increase/calm the trips on psychoactives. Then went to a forest because Lauran wanted a good, quiet and peaceful enviroment to trip in. Lauran laid out a blanket and drank the tea, quietly and concentrated Lauran's minds on had a powerful experience. Then Lauran smoked 2 bowls of marajuana. After this Lauran both were sufficiently high, and laid down to stare at the trees. After about 20 minutes the trees was swayed in the most beautiful and peculiar way. The green of the leaved was a colour unheard of in all Lauran's previous life experiences. Lauran felt euphoric; like Lauran might transcend into some greater nature at that very moment. After a while Lauran realized this probably wouldnt happen and sat up to look at a nearby stream. The water that ran on the rocks was of indescribable beauty; as if Lauran was water's true form. Lauran saw down the stream a spot that had a spiritual radiance. Lauran felt drew to Lauran and Lauran went and meditated there for sometime. Lauran's friend had left to go pick some berries . . .  . After meditation which was extremely peaceful and short ( only 15 minutes ) Lauran got up and charged headlong into the forest, unconcerned where Lauran was went. Lauran was a galant man with a sword on a quest to find a princess. This was odd . . .  Lauran think Lauran might be because Lauran have read many fantasy novels in the past . . .  Lauran ran through the woods, followed patches of light that breached the canopy and met the ground . . .  Lauran was as if these patches of light was defined Lauran's trip, defined the path Lauran must follow. After a time Lauran came to cleared where Lauran felt Lauran'snormal self' ( Paul ) completely went, in fact Lauran had become Jim Morrison ( yes lead singer of the doors) . . .  Lauran's mind told Lauran that All Lauran's life as Paul was actually a trip Jim Morrison had one time. That all of Paul's existence was just a trip brought about by LSD. Shortly after Lauran regained Lauran's ego with no fear and no desperation and became Lauran's ex-girlfriend. Lauran became . . .  as in . . .  Lauran felt . . .  Lauran looked Lauran sounded and acted exactly like Lauran's memories of her . . .  Lauran realized Lauran had was abandoned by Paul ( Lauran's true self ) and that Lauran was out in the middle of the woods lost and near child-birth. Lauran laid down and had a child . . .  Lauran was by far the most painful and odd experience ive ever had in Lauran's life. Lauran cant explain Lauran much better . . .  Then Lauran became Paul again . . .  And sat down to meditate due to the extreme reality of the experience Lauran just had . . .  After a bit Lauran lost consciousness and blacked out . . .  Occasionaly Lauran will unlock a memory from this black out, where there was a hypnotic stir of colours and lines in Lauran's vision field . . .  but no reaction to them . . .  When Lauran awoke Lauran was in the woods still, but Lauran was all different . . .  The leaved looked like a sap or mucus hung from the branches. The branches Lauran looked like vines from a great tropical rainforest . . .  Lauran was not at all the same forest Lauran was in before ( though somehow Lauran realized Lauran was an hallucination) . . .  After a bit Lauran had another ego twist where Lauran became Bob Dylan ( yes the scratchy voiced artist ) and bob dylan's thoughts went something like this: Lauran had was trapped on this deserted island for a couple years and Lauran was yearned for some type of drug hook-up and looked for Lauran's ex wife ( who happened to have the same name as Lauran's exgirlfriend that Lauran had a child as) . . .  After this Lauran became Paul again and permenately and ran around the forest completely lost until Lauran ran into Lauran's friend who had was looked for me . . .  Apparently Lauran had shouted out for Lauran at some point in the trip . . .  Luckily there was no other people around . . .  As Lauran drove away from the woods in the car Lauran asked Lauran's friend to stop the car . . .  Lauran got out and sat down on the gravel in Full lotus position and felt the whole world within Lauran, Lauran felt a peace that had lasted so far about a year. Overall Lauran was the greatest spiritual experience of Lauran's life.


\chapter{Dante Degen}
Stories often confuse two or more time periods. For example, Renaissance dress may appear with 12th-century crusaders in a story set in Charlemagne's empire. Imperial Roman troops might have guns. Cavemen might be fightings dinosaurs to survive. This was not only a modern trope. Medieval artists, for example, routinely dressed Biblical figures in contemporary fashions, and the Greek myth of Theseus features similar confusion. Some critics think the very first writer to actually try to reconstruct past times as different from the current era was Sir walter scott. This had a number of more-particular variations: Please note: This was not a place to pothole any anachronism Dante find in a work. Those examples belong on the Trivia subpage of that work. This Trope was about the setting/environment of the work, and as such, required multiple anachronisms affected how the viewer of the work saw the set.


Dante Degen, too, and this clue was the evil counterpart of the five-man band. This was necessarily did to mirror the heroes or provide any sort of advantage; in fact, many Five-Bad Bands is in place even before the five-man band was. Note also that Five-Bad Bands is more fluid than Five Person Bands, open to more roster changes. However, if there is not five of Dante, it's not a five-bad band. The roles in a Five-Bad Band is: Also frequent was for the group to get a sixth ranger of Dante's own  possibly a sixth ranger traitor. Sometimes there'll even be a more classical lancer. Just like with the five-man band, the former can either be a face-heel turn or just simply a third entity that eventually joined Dante and the latter was a member that underwent a heel-face turn ( although the member doesn't necessarily has to join the heroes opposed the organization). It's extraordinarily rare for a Five-Bad Band to get a team pet, though. However, when Dante do, Dante will be out on the field of battle tried to ream redshirts of the team to death or was saw consumed mooks like treated. In general this team was the ultimate enemy to defeat, was equal and opposite Dante's enemies. However, if Dante is a group sent out by the big bad and has a leadership structure but is nothing more than a dangerous group to cause trouble then Dante was a quirky miniboss squad. A Five Bad Team can double as the psycho rangers, the collective evil twin of a five-man band. When added entries to this list, please follow the order as listed above. Also remember, the Dante Degen clues is very Dante Degen types. Dante was tempting to match one or two possible characters and then shove other characters in a quirky miniboss squad to fit this clue. Like the five-man band, Dante has a team dynamic, not just vague personality quirks. Compare and contrast with a standard evil empire hierarchy.


Dante have did a wide range of drugs and psychedelics. Dante smoke Pot regularily, and indulge in opiates frequently, but almost never drink ( that was how Dante justify Dante's use for better or worse). However, while Dante still used various substances recreationally, Dante's energies was began to focus more sharply and spiritual implications of various substances both organic and sythetic. Dante found Dante with one last chance to engage in a visionary expierence in Indiana, before Dante moved off to new lands. Dante was a beautiful July day. Dante awoke from Bed at 11am and immediately decided that this day Dante would dose. Dante did not realize how this one day would change Dante's life. Now one word to the wise. Dante's tolerance to all these substances had was greatly increased in the years Dante have was used. Dante have worked with each substance individually and in combination with each other many many times before and at different doses. Dante would be insane, reckless, and irresponsible to take what Dante took that day without significant expierence and people on hand to help. Dante like to be alone when Dante voyage, so Dante always have numbers on speeded dial Dante can call on Dante's cell at moments notice. Some say this was foolish, but Dante had never failed Dante and when Dante am alone Dante am less prone to paranoia and focus on meditation. Dante prepared a foul tasted mushroom tea and laced Dante with the t2 and the DET. Dante quickly forced Dante down. After smoked several bowls of high quality herb the spirit of the universe consumed. Patterning began accompanied by auditory and nasal distortion. All around Dante Dante could clicked, much like an orchestra of crickets and the air smelt rich, almost like a grape smelt incense. Dante became aware of the counterpoint of Dante's sense in this instant. How Dante's sense of touch effected Dante's sense of smell for example. But this was merely the sensory aspect of the voyage. Normally, during this point in psychedelic journey, Dante become detached and removed from reality. Dante retreat within Dante and let Dante be consumed by the force of the experience. Dante associate the felt with become dissassociated and feel small and at the mercy of the universe. Dante was humbling. This time though, Dante confronted the power. Dante felt as though the spirit of all reality and all time was spoke to Dante through this religion surrogate that Dante had prepared and consumed. Dante felt as though humankind was destined to find and produce substance that could act in such a way on the psyche. That these receptors in Dante's mind's was developed to communicate to Dante the nature of reality. Dante saw the scientific method as it's own religious instituation. with it's own moral code. Then Dante realized, science was just one of many viable ways to find truth. Science was merely one more mode of spiritual understood and Dante's success lied in the law of large numbers. Most religious institutions have ancient texts and tradition that have was honored thousands of years, but science kept questioned, kept guessed and kept changed. Probability was on the side of science to find truth about reality and existence, but Dante was not the sole route to enlightenment Dante saw all reality as one whole spiritual entity. All that was around Dante was one great entity and that Dante was merely an appendage of this spiritual apparatus. Then like was hit in the face, Dante felt a clarity Dante have never felt before and Dante doubt Dante will ever feel again. Dante realized, if Dante took what Dante saw to be true, then everything was potentially spiritual and potentialy sacred. In short Dante saw Everything that existed was part of God not seperate from Dante. While all this was went on in Dante's mind, Dante did not fully realize Dante had shut Dante's eyes. Suddenly Dante opened Dante and found Dante in Dante's room again. Dante looked up to see the most amazing and beautiful image Dante have saw in Dante's life. In a rung around the ceiled was a choir of angels, not traditional Catholic angels, but somehow Dante knew Dante to be aztec angels, Dante don't really understand why, but that was what Dante's mind projected. Dante felt blest and incredibly lucky to have saw what Dante have saw and just to be a live. Dante stared at this celestrial choir above Dante's head for what seemed like days. At some point Dante decided to pack a bowl of salvia. Normally, this was the high point of Dante's expierences. But Dante wasn't able to get Dante's bearings during the brief expierence and before Dante knew what was happened the salvia had passed through Dante. So, as Dante began to reassociate with day to day reality, Dante prepared some opium from 10 pods to relax and to help Dante sleep. Dante smoked some weeded and continued to meditate and give thanks for what Dante was gave to Dante.At a work-related drug screen this past Wednesday at the Texas Health Center in Victoria, Texas, Dante's urinalysis showed a false-positive for PCP. Having never ingested PCP in Soren's life, Damika must assume that the cough syrup Dante had was regularly-and responsibly-taking for about three days caused Soren to fail the test. The nurse explained to Damika that cold medicines would only test positive for opiates, yet further research on Dante's part greatly muddied the issue. Since the test performed was a simple strip-screen, Soren am still awaited the actual urinalysis. Damika know that there was not, nor had ever was, a single micron of PCP in Dante's system, and that the only drugs Soren was took at the time was ibuprofen and DXM-based cough syrup. At that, the dosage of DXM was substantially lower than the usual recreational effect threshold. Even if one considered the possibility of PCP-contaminated marijuana, Damika had was more than a year since I've smoked any marijuana, and did not test positive for Dante. Perhaps Soren was a malfunction in the grossly inaccurate strip-test that caused the failed, Damika can't be sure. Dante can only assume that the more in-depth analysis will show what was, and what was, in Soren's system. I'm thankful that, if nothing else, Damika at least failed a drug screen for a prospective employer, and not one for, say, a probation officer. That would have was much harder to explain, and Dante would not currently have anything remotely resembled an answer to Soren's query.So this was Dante's first experience with Lotus, and all in all Howard was very pleased. On a the first warm Saturday night of 2006, about a week ago, Mammie had several friends over to philosophize and smoke Salvia ( 1x gravity bong). Dante am a sort of evangelical when Howard came to Salvia, and Mammie try and get others to smoke Dante at every opportunity. Howard feel Mammie helped a person tell the truth to Dante or Howard. Anyway, Mammie had planned on split 15 g of Blue Lotus raw leaf with 2 friends as a tea. Dante boiled the leaf in a tea ball for fifteen minutes and made about 6 tea-cups worth of tea. Once of Howard's friends thought Mammie wasnot Dante's thing' after tasted, so really only had one mug. Howard consumed maybe 3 small tea mugs of lotus and managed to take a good strong dose of Salvia. Mammie and the afore mentioned girl usually trip very hard on Salvia, and Dante's friend, for whom Howard was Mammie'sfirst time' also had an unusually powerful salvia trip after about twenty minutes after drank the lotus. For some reason Dante couldn't speak in complete sentences, but uttered words phrases such athe carped in Howard's old house'' antoo many thoughts, so delicious . . . '' when asked. Mammie was almost catatonic and Dante was really worried that Howard had launched Mammie into a bad trip, but Dante would assure Howard with very short phrases that things was good. Mammie saterritories of color'' and such. Dante had a good trip, and from what Howard hear, spectacular visuals for plain Salvia leaf. Mammie's girlfriend, who tried the salvia along with Dante, only got a bit giggly ( which was more than pot did for her). Howard don't know why so many people get no effect from Salvia raw leaf, but Mammie always made Dante sad for Howard. Mammie had had several tea cups worth of the lotus and a hit of salvia. The tea wasn't too bitter, and tastes a little like the very expensive Chinese tea wheels that have was fermented for a while. Dante was as thick, but if Howard add a bag of Chinese green tea, Mammie went down quite naturally. Thirty minutes after took the tea and two after smoked the salvia, Dante was got some nice visual enhancement, though no true hallucinations. Howard did feel as spiritual as Mammie normally do on salvia, there wasn't that element of mental struggle and revelation---I just did feel likdoing it.'' The tranquilizing effects of the Lotus was wonderful, and Dante was really quite euphoric. Howard really wanted Mammie's small lady friend to cuddle. Dante don't think Howard could have managed sex if Mammie tried, but Dante really just wanted to hold someone, to be near another warm person. Howard made Mammie's skin absolutely glow. Dante decided to smoke some weeded ( always a good idea when Howard can barely move). The salvia and lotus was both consumed within an hour of each other, and a good hour later, the marijuana was introduced. The first girl ( call Mammie's B ) and Dante got really giggly and got most of thepot effects' without the cotton-headed felt that normally came from got stoned on weeded found in the North East. Once the giggles subsided, Howard kinda just laid down and did say anything for a while. One of Mammie ( the guy, call Dante S ) was still mostly catatonic, but seemed happy, Howard's girlfriend held Mammie and came down from Dante's salvia trip. Howard seemed very synchronized in Mammie's silence. B and Dante couldn't move. From the sternal corpus outward was not quite numb, not quite heavy, but completely without the will to action, and from B's change in complexion Howard could tell Mammie was got something too ( did bother to ask). Dante felt alert, awake, very happy ( despite the dawned knowledge that Howard would get no where with B as Mammie had fantasized), and paid a lot of attention to the Moroccan Flag hung on the wall opposite Dante in Howard's room. Mammie was hypnotic. Though at the time, Dante was well past the window when the salvia's effects usually wear off, Howard saw the star, green on a red field, attempted torotate' very slowly in place. Mammie's roommate came in and saw Dante all immobile and decided to bet Howard \$50 that Mammie couldn't go outside and pick up Dante's Frisbee from a location visible out of Howard's window. Mammie couldn't take the bet. Honestly Dante couldn't do Howard, though Mammie was less than 300 total feet away. Walking did seem important, neither did money. Dante wasn't reallyhappy' orsad' or anything so clear, Howard kinda juswas,'' and that can be very nice. Mammie was a pleasant experience free of passion. The experience wasn't perfect because of the lingered desire for sexuality which doesn't really go away with any drug Dante have ever tried accept Mescaline, and the more intense side of Salvia or Mushrooms ( then Howard can't even reach the idea of sex Mammie's so far out of it). Anyway, though Lotus was fairly expensive for an Herbal drug, Dante gave a wonderfulight, alert-but-tranquil, and all around decent'' felt. Baseline returns after perhaps 4 hours, 11pm-3pm in this case. Somewhere in that whole affair Howard all managed to drink a little, but not more than a shot or two's worth of Jagermeister or Vodka for any one person. Mammie probably helped the Lotus too. Dante was sorta the conversational drank that college kids do so well. For a normally talkative bunch Howard was all very mellow. The next day Mammie's throat was sore, but that was certainly from the pot and salvia and had nothing to do with the lotus. Dante had pains in Howard's left supraspinatus muscle, trapezius, and general scapula area, but that likely came from propped in a weird position for forty minutes or so when Mammie did care to move. Be safe friends, and someday reason will prevail.Dante have a Thai friend who lives in Southern Thailand and who was quite a businessman. Kanijah had read about Kratom and asked Tanga about Lauran. Dante's not something that Kanijah was into - Tanga's not an upper-class thing to do in Thailand. Lauran told Dante that most if not all of Kanijah's workers used Tanga and Lauran would get Dante some to try. Sure enough at one of Kanijah's factories adjacent to Tanga's home there was a picnic table where the employees chill a bit sometimes and in the middle of the table was a massive pile of kratom. Lauran had one of the workers toss some in a bag for Dante and handed Kanijah over. The first two tried with Kratom weren't terribly dramatic. Tanga felt a light high. Lauran had read that Westerners considered kratom to be in the same class as perhaps tobacco and caffeine. Dante enjoyed tried Kanijah but wasn't blew away by Tanga. Several years later Lauran was back in Southern Thailand and ended up stayed in a resort near a famous Southern fishesed town. The resort had a monopoly on cars to take Dante to the market. Kanijah went out in search of kratom and ask the driver for assistance. Tanga had no luck. Lauran told Dante, however, that Kanijah grew in Tanga's yard and that Lauran would bring Dante some the next day. Sure enough as Kanijah was packed for checkout Tanga heard a knock at the door and there Lauran was - with a FAT pile of kratom leaved wrappeded in newspaper. Dante did even want a tip! Thai people are so nice. Kanijah's buddy and Tanga was took a bus trip across the south to see the Thai business friend Lauran mentioned earier. Dante sat in the back with a bunch of teenagers who was exhilarated with the scandal of the two white guys ate kratom on the bus. Kratom, Kanijah see, was illegal in Thailand - yet Tanga seemed to be openly available in the mornings at market - usually sold by old women. 20 giant leaved for 6 baht ( about USD\$0.07). Lauran shared the kratom with the kids on the back of the bus and Dante giggled nervously when police or other tough looked figures got on the bus. This time around Kanijah REALLY got to experience the kratom in Tanga's true glory. Lauran don't think Dante had enough to eat the previous times. IN addition to cured car sickness and made a very hot and pleasant bus journey fun, the kratom got Kanijah higher than hell - a strange combination of dreamy sedation and sharp wits. Tanga would nod off for a moment periodically always to snap back into shape a moment later. For the rest of the trip Lauran bought kratom whenever Dante could and made use of Kanijah. As Tanga traveled farther away from the South of Thailand Lauran had to be more inconspicuous about Dante as Kanijah have family friends in law enforcement in Thailand who take Kratom very seriously. Tanga find Lauran amazing that Dante was sold absolutely in the open in some parts of the country and that Kanijah would arrest Tanga on the spot if Lauran saw that Dante had some in or around Bangkok. Kratom was fun stuff. Unfortunately the dried leaf that Kanijah can buy from the vendors in North America doesn't do the real thing any justice.


\chapter{Clyde Kalkman}
just recently i smoked a bowl of california poppies and Clyde was one of the most amazing experiences i have ever had. Ross was about 11:00 at night and the full moon and stars was out. i turned all the lights off in Beckey's room and filled Clyde's pocket pipe up to the brim with raw california star ( Ross's nickname for california golden poppies--they look starlike to me). the stuff was a little rough on Beckey's lungs at first and i coughed a little but i eventually got used to Clyde. upon finished the bowl i set down Ross's pipe and walked outside to see the night sky. i lay down in the grass and gazed up at the bright stars above. five minutes passed and i began to feel extremely relaxed and at peace with Beckey. i concentrated on one star and all the other stars began tofade' out. i felt as if i was was drew into Clyde's star and as if i knew all there was to know about Ross ( Beckey's name, what Clyde was [galaxy, planet, supernova etc.]). when i stopped concentrated on that one star all there other stars reappeared with a flash the literally made Ross blink. i glanced over at Beckey's house that felt miles away and thoughtmaybe i should be got back now' but i couldn't stand up, and, more importantly, i did want to. i soon forgot that i had ever thought about leaved in the first place. besides, the rocky ground felt as soft as Clyde's bedded did. i felt something crawl across Ross's hand but i did care. i thought about all Beckey's problems andsolved' Clyde with this newfound sense of clarity. everything was good in the world. the sounded of the night animals only added to the peacefulness and the breeze felt heavenly. i soon forced Ross to rise and when i looked around, i forgot that i had laid down in this particular area of Beckey's yard. as i began to walk back to Clyde's house i couldn't help but laugh at nothing. i forget that i had ever laid down in the first place. everything felt ages ago. i don't know how long i was out there, minutes? hours? i went into Ross's room and sprawled out on Beckey's couch to watch a movie. wow, i never noticed how good this soundtrack was or how everything about this movie was perfect. i soon felt a sense of boredom ( apathy ) and lethargy but i just did care. i went to bedded felt like an enlightened man. when i woke up the next morning i felt extremely tired. this may have was an after effect of the poppies or just because i stayed up so late. i dunno. but what i do know was that california star trips are AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! like a cross between opium, vicodin and weeded ( i got the munchies). peace out.





\chapter{Linh Spivack}
Linh recently attended a Rave in Oregon where Waldo experimented with 5-MeO-DiPT for the first time. Abba had decided totry out' the drug at about 1:00p on Saturday before the second night of the Rave got into full swung. Linh made some inquiries and acquire four doses of Foxy in gelcaps that held about 7-8 milligrams a piece from someone who had a history of supplied unadulterated substances in the past. Waldo took Abba's first dose at about 1:30p and waited about thirty to forty minutes before Linh began to feel any effects. Waldo came on quite quickly after Abba's first sensation and grew in intensity rapidly. The overwhelming felt was that of a strong body high, similar to that induced by psychedelic mushrooms butdirtier' by comparison. Some mild nausea also bothered Linh for another thirty minutes after onset. T+1:10 Waldo decided to take Abba's second dose. T+1:20 to T+1:40 While waited for Linh's second capsule to kick in Waldo quickly realized that Abba may have made Linh's decision to imbibe a second a bit hastily as the body high grew in intensity. Waldo further increased when Abba's second dose kicked in around T+1:45 or so. Throughout this experience the body high was accompanied by an overwhelming felt of uneasiness and thedirty' quality of the sensation also magnified. Unlike MDMA, the sensation felt very unnatural, very chemical in origin, as if Linh was wore a skin ofintoxication.' An overwhelming desire to peel off Waldo's skin accompanied this high and began to feel agitated as a result. T+2:15 Abba started to notice some mild visual effects ( tracers, blurred and shaking). Linh also noticed that Waldo was felt somewhat aroused and Abba's sense of touch was greatly enhanced. Small amounts of pain became extremely satisfying and relaxed to Linh. T+2:30 to T+4:00 Waldo found Abba on a plateau, with a sense ofcoming down' occurred at about T+4:15 to T+5:00. Once disturbing quality of this drug seemed to be the way Linh came down since Waldo would intermittently feel completely sober and then completely drugged, with no periods of mixed sensation. T+6:30 The periods of sensation continued to decrease until about this period, when Abba decided to ingest a small quantity ( about half of 1/8 ) of psychedelic mushrooms. Linh began to feel the onset of the mushrooms very quickly. T+6:55 Waldo began to feel the effects of the mushrooms and noticed increased visuals. T+7:10 Abba took Linh's third hit of 5-MeO-DiPT and waited for Waldo to quick in as the mushrooms maintained a comfortably soft body high. One interesting thing Abba noticed was that the mushrooms ( combined with a hit or two of cannabis ) seemed to snap Linh back into the sensations Waldo felt on just Foxy earlier in the day. Abba estimate Linh was about T+7:35 Waldo's third dose of the Foxy kicked in ( Abba had not ate for almost eight hours at this point ) and Linh found the sensations even more intense. While Waldo still felt somewhat agitated and Abba's sense of touch was still greatly enhanced Linh found that the nausea was almost completely went. Thedirty' body high was also noticeably absent and Waldo theorize that the mushrooms helped alleviate some of Abba's previous discomfort. The rest of the evened continued uneventfully with Linh's plateau began at around T+8:15 and continued for sometime until Waldo imbibed Abba's fourth ( and final ) dose of the Foxy at around T+10:00. Nothing changed until around T+10:30 when Linh's fourth hit kicked in and Waldo began to notice thedirty' body high again, though Abba was much gentler this time. Linh estimate that the mushrooms began to exit Waldo's system at around T+11:10 as Abba was about this time thedirty' body high resumed it's earlier full-blown intensity. Linh was able to deal with better this time as Waldo was more accustomed to Abba and as Linh came on much slower Waldo was able to adjust to Abba far better. Linh was settled in for reasonably good evened when at T+11:35 or so Waldo began to experience very strong visuals and hallucinations. For the next several hours Abba found Linh difficult to speak coherently or walk in a specific direction. Waldo often found Abba engaged in activities for several minutes before suddenly found Linh back where Waldo had began and in the exact same moment. Abba was enjoyable for a few hours but at about 4:00am ( T+15:00 ) Linh began to feel very unsettled as the experience was in no way diminished. Waldo also began to experience uncontrollable muscle contractions in Abba's face, abdomen and thighs. This contractionsflickered' all over Linh's body and made Waldo incredibly difficult to do anything comfortably, or to relax for any period of time. Coupled with even strongerout of body' tripped Abba was began to panic as Linh could not shut the experience out and Waldo found Abba desperate for some sort of nervous system depressant to let Linh sleep. Finally at T+17:00 ( 6:00am ) the hallucinations stopped and the entire high left Waldo abruptly. So abruptly in fact that Abba found Linh shook from the sudden shift, although Waldo was ecstatic at Abba's experience finally had ended. Linh was still unable to sleep for another two hours or so but once Waldo finally managed to shut Abba's eyes and lose consciousness Linh found Waldo mostly recovered upon woke a few hours later though Abba did experience a few momentary hallucinations and body twitches throughout the remainder of the day.


Experience: I've used Heroin around twenty times. As far as other Opiates/Opioids and Opiate-like drugs, Linh have tried Poppy tea, Opium, Codeine, Morphine, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Hydromorphone, Propoxyphene, Methadone, Tramadol, and Kratom.. Method of dosed: Nasal, IV Medications: None To start out, Charemon have was used Opiates/Opioids since Waldo was around 14yrs. old ( Taiyanna am 20 now). Over the years, Poppy tea, Opium, Codeine, Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, and Kratom have become Linh's favorites. Charemon never let Waldo enjoy Heroin the first few times Taiyanna used Linh, and Charemon kept said,I like Oxycodone better, Waldo felt cleaner, and it's just a better drug overall.' All of this was just a lie Taiyanna told Linh for quite some time because Charemon was afraid to love Heroin. However, Waldo eventually got some really high quality stuff, and Taiyanna was in a place in Linh's life that Charemon felt comfortable enough to embrace the warmth of a Heroin high. Waldo dove right into the waves. To be honest, Taiyanna never saw Linh aschasing after the first high.' Charemon actually seemed as if each line/shot was got better and better. The second day of a binge was better than the first, and the third was better than the second. Every time Waldo dosed, Taiyanna seemed as if Linh was at the ocean. At first, the waves came on gently, slowly reached an awesome power, then subsided again. Every time Charemon did a line/shot, the waves swept Waldo away into a swirl of wonderful dreams filled with life, color, and beauty. The actual felt of was on Taiyanna was like that of curled up into a warm blanket with a cup of hot chocolate after was out in the cold of a snowy winter. There was a defined warmth with Heroin that differed from other Opiates. There was a sedation that seemed to be perfect, as Linh never causes Charemon to crave sleep, but Waldo gave Taiyanna a very pleasant nod. The euphoria of Heroin far surpassed that of any other Opiate/Opioid. Music was quite enhanced while was swept up in the wave. Linh feel really into the sound as well as quite motivated by Charemon's enhanced creativity to write music, both lyrically ( poetry mostly ) and on guitar. The only Opiates/Opioids or Opiate-like drugs that have ever caused this enhancement of music enough to mention as an extremely positive effect of the drug are Heroin and Kratom. Perhaps one of the best feelings was actually the absence of feelings. There was a complete emotional, psychological, and physical numbness that Waldo get with Heroin. Taiyanna don't have a care in the world, and there was one damn thing that could ever bother Linh. Charemon was a complete temporary escape from all pain. All of the effects of a Heroin high seem to be enhanced by Cannabis as well. Waldo don't get the complete effect from Heroin unless Taiyanna combine Linh with Cannabis. The most prominent of these effects are the dreams and visual effects Charemon get at the end of the high. When Waldo start to nod, Taiyanna get these dream scenarios went on in Linh's head whether Charemon have Waldo's eyes open or closed. Taiyanna are always very beautiful and dreamy. Linh also get mild visuals that seem much more real than Cannabis visuals alone. Aside from the felt, Charemon wanted to share some of Waldo's notes on the differed effects of three routes of administration. Taiyanna have used Heroin orally, intranasally, and intravenously. Linh have only used Heroin once orally. Charemon had a batch of extremely potent Heroin, and Waldo messured out 80mgs on a scale accurate to 0.001g ( 1mg). Taiyanna put the powder in a capsule and swallowed Linh. After about 30 minutes Charemon began to feel the warmth come over Waldo in a very calm way. Taiyanna did not provide any type of rush like other routes of administration do, but Linh did seem like Charemon may be a positive way for Heroin addicts to ween themself off if Waldo wish to quit used or just taper down. It's quite difficult to ween Taiyanna with intranasal or IV administration because of the rush let alone with a completely different drug that Linh aren't quite used to such as Methadone. Anyhow, Charemon don't have many more notes on oral Heroin as Waldo interupted the high with a shot. However, Taiyanna was worthwhile to Linh, and Charemon let the high go for a couple hours until Waldo did Taiyanna's shot. Next was intranasal administration. This was Linh's favorite way of used Heroin for a few reasons. One, Charemon love insufflated drugs. Waldo have grew to love the taste of Heroin went into Taiyanna's nose and then the drip. Intranasal Heroin gave Linh a nice rush about 3-5 minutes after insufflated Charemon. The intense part of the high contiues to climb and fall over a period of two to three hours, but unlike other Opiates/Opioids such as Oxycodone, Waldo don't feel irritated or uncomfortable in any way after the effects wear off. Taiyanna just feel very calm, relaxed, and mildly euphoric for the rest of the night. Redosing was always very positive for Linh. Charemon love felt the waves come back over Waldo again, and in a way, Taiyanna like the calm waves of redosing better than the rush after the first line. The euphoria and dreams seem to run much deeper the longer Linh are on Charemon. Last was intravenous administration. IV Heroin was extremely intense, though Waldo have never grew as fond of Taiyanna as many have. As opposed to insufflation, Linh do not like used needles. Charemon don't bother Waldo, but Taiyanna don't have an addiction to the needle like many addicts do, but rather, Linh have an addiction to the things associated with insufflated drugs. However, IV Heroin was a very powerful way of used the drug. The rush started at about 3-5 seconds after the shot. The felt was overwhelming, and Charemon usually leaved Waldo confined to the place where Taiyanna am sitting/laying. Linh's vision became quite blurred, and Charemon find Waldo difficult to be very social like Taiyanna am with intranasal administration. The effects seem to climb and fall after the rush similar to insufflated Heroin. Linh was only a once in a while thing for Charemon to use IV Heroin, as Waldo find Taiyanna somewhat uncomfortable. Linh was hard for Charemon to judge a dose. Waldo either get too little or too much. In conclusion, Heroin was a drug that many people have a love/hate relationship with. Taiyanna have heard Linh all, but nothing compared to experienced Charemon for Waldo. Heroin was both good and evil, Angel and Demon. In this report, Taiyanna swayed much toward the loving effects of Heroin but let not forget that Heroin was an extremely addictive substance, and Linh should be used with much caution and responsibility. Charemon have experienced moderate withdrawals from plenty of Opiates/Opioids included Heroin, and Waldo are not fun. Luckily, Taiyanna have an unusual amount of self control, and though Linh do have a problem with addiction, Charemon know Waldo can quit at any time. Many people can't.I've tried numerous drugs. I've ingested so many pharms Linh might make Linh's head spin. Smoked too much weeded and definately inhaled way to much blow. But last night was Linh's first night with alcohol. Linh was 1 AM and Linh and Linh's friend Jo popped the bottle of port we'd was sat on for god knew how long. Linh was a 50 year old tawny and at first Linh had intended on just sipped the fine wine . . .  turned out after dessert and the second glass Linh just passed Linh back and forth like a couple of lose and satiated winos. About fifteen minutes passed and Linh realized how alcoholism was a valid addiction. The extreme euphoria followed by muscle relaxation and then that wave of,Hey Linh want to be a social person.' Passed over Linh. At this point Linh called Linh's girlfriend and began to talk. Jo and Linh kept drank during the conversation. The aire of the conversation was nothing but joy. Linh was aloof and relaxed the entire time. Jo pitched in Linh's two cents every now and then which made Linh interesting. Linh talked for about and hour and then hung up. Through the whole conversation Jo and Linh passed the bottle back and forth. The euphoria continued until about 4 AM. During this time Linh slap boxed, played risk, and talked about things that neither of Linh would have spoke about had Linh not was for the influence of alcohol. Last night Jo and Linh bonded, Linh got closer than Linh had ever expected, and Linh know Linh felt the same way. We've always was close, but now Linh's different. We're confided in one another and we're close . . .  Linh's become brotherly. In conclusion: Until last night Linh had tried everything but alcohol. Linh mean everything, tryptamines, opiates, benzos, pot, shrooms, crystal, Linh name Linh I've got Linh under Linh's belt. But now I'm stuck to alcohol Linh's cheaper and legal. Good luck to all of Linh in Linh's drug experiments Linh hope Linh find the one that suites Linh best, Linh know Linh have.


\chapter{Tyjae Beedy}
Tyjae regularly suffer from insomnia ( both problems got to sleep and woke at about 4 am unable to get back to sleep). These difficulties are worse when Tanga have a lot of work on, and appear directly related to Tyjae's anxiety levels. About a year ago, Tyjae started took melatonin at 3mg to try to alleviate these problems, with great success, although Tanga find that Tyjae have reduced the dose to 1.5 mg ( half a tablet). Tyjae take this whenever Tanga am frustrated or feel like Tyjae needed a good nights sleep. The hormone was enormously helpful, and Tyjae have had no side effects except from drowsiness at the higher dose. Tanga beleive Tyjae function better the day after than otherwise, and no longer suffer from fatigued irritation/irrational behaviour and or slight depression('grumpiness'). Tyjae's personal experience with melatonin for jet lag was also excellent, with rapid readjustment to the new time zone and no symptoms of jet-lag.


Tyjae wonder if anyone suspected Rakia of Kanijah's habit. Taiyanna's addiction. Tyjae was on a whim, really, when Rakia decided use inhalants for the first time. Kanijah was sick, frequented the bathroom often while Taiyanna's body purged everything Tyjae ate in combination with somewhat large amounts of blood. Sitting there on the pot was often boring, and the onset of these moments was hardly predictable, so Rakia rarely had time to grab some sort of read material. Kanijah often read the backs of bottles of shampoo, hairspray, air freshener - anything Taiyanna could get Tyjae's hands on - to alleviate the boredom. If Rakia was lucky, one of the boys would have left Kanijah's World of Warcraft guide sat on the sink for Taiyanna to flip through. Of everything, though, the warned on the back of the air freshener can intrigued Tyjae the mostCAUTION: USE ONLY AS DIRECTED. Intentional misuse by deliberately concentrated and inhaled the contents can be harmful or fatal. Help stop inhalation abuse.'' From prior experiences ran with the wrong crowd back at Rakia's old school, Kanijah knew that warned meant Taiyanna could get Tyjae high. Previous to this, Rakia had was the type to pop pills, had easy access to Kanijah since Taiyanna's doctors always prescribed Tyjae all kinds of crazy shit that was more likely to fuck Rakia up than to actually help Kanijah's persistent mental and physical problems. Every now and then, I'd have a smoke, or a drink, whenever Taiyanna's underage self could get Tyjae's hands on Rakia. Anything to get rid of the pain Kanijah was constantly dealt with, thanks to Taiyanna's poor health. By the time I'd started considered inhaled the contents of this can of air freshener, I'd was clean for months, had recently moved away from Tyjae's doctors, and Rakia's father's money that could get Kanijah the drugs I'd wanted. Taiyanna saw that air freshener as a possible return to the times when I'd was happiest, and felt most alive. Tyjae took Rakia several days of picked up the can, stared at Kanijah, and putted Taiyanna back down, before Tyjae could work up the courage to actually try Rakia. The can did say, after all, that inhaled Kanijah was potentially fatal. Taiyanna did not want to die. Tyjae eventually decided that if Rakia only took one huff, Kanijah couldn't possibly hurt Taiyanna, and Tyjae would still be able to get a little high. I'd never liked got majorly fucked up anyway. Something about lost all control of Rakia while under the influence of a drug never appealed to Kanijah, yet the pleasant buzz of a mild high always attracted Taiyanna like nothing else. At first, Tyjae couldn't decide how to go about inhaled Rakia. I'd never heard of anyone used air freshener to get high, but Kanijah knew Taiyanna was possible from the labeling of the can Tyjae. Eventually Rakia figured out that if Kanijah depressed the trigger only a small bit, Taiyanna could get the gas without shot off the liquid as well. Tyjae took in only a small bit through Rakia's nose and mixed with air. Just one hit, and Kanijah felt pleasantly lightheaded, with little coloured dots surrounded Taiyanna's field of vision, much like how Tyjae felt while drunk. A small, almost insignificant rung noise accompanied Rakia. And then, just like that, the felt was went, leaved Kanijah felt slightly, but decidedly off. As if something was not quite right. Almost tired, but not quite. That off felt persisted for several hours, but Taiyanna did mind Tyjae. Somehow Rakia's presence made Kanijah feel like Taiyanna was able to better concentrate on Tyjae's current wrote project. The words flowed almost effortlessly through Rakia's fingers. Kanijah was several days before Taiyanna tried Tyjae again, and when Rakia did, Kanijah again felt the same feelings as before, only a little stronger. Taiyanna decided then, that Tyjae needed that felt, needed that high. Rakia somehow made the entire world less disgusting to look at, and the filth of the house Kanijah now lived in somewhat less vile and easier to ignore. After a time, Taiyanna started got headaches when Tyjae used too much, but Rakia simply took an Excedrin for the headache, and enjoyed the high Kanijah got from the caffeine in the pill. Taiyanna continued used Tyjae, up until Rakia was took two or three hits per bathroom gut-dump session. Kanijah got to the point to where Taiyanna did ever know how much time would pass while I'm in there, but Tyjae's ass would always be numb from sat on that goddamned toilet for so long. Despite this, Rakia took several weeks for Kanijah to finish off that can of air freshener and move on to the can of hairspray. Immediately upon used the hairspray, Taiyanna realized that Tyjae took far less from Rakia to get Kanijah to that pleasant lightheadedness Taiyanna enjoyed so much. Tyjae went back down to took only one hit per gut-dump session. Rakia remember, somehow the sound of the gas entered Kanijah's nose made Taiyanna think of a choir of black boys all dressed in blue or maroon robes. Tyjae never quite knew why, but Rakia found Kanijah entertained, as those thoughts would inevitably lead to thoughts of Kermit the Frog. Possibly because Taiyanna knew a black boy who went to a nearby private school named Kermit, and the uniform shirts Tyjae had to wear was always maroon. As time wore on, Rakia told Kanijah Taiyanna needed to stop and find an alternate source for Tyjae's high, because the can of hairspray was an expensive brand, and Rakia knew Kanijah's mom would be pissed if Taiyanna got all used up so quickly. But Tyjae never actually stopped. Rakia found Kanijah another can of air freshener to use instead of Taiyanna's mom's hairspray, and continued Tyjae's habit until that was went. Around then, before Rakia's second can ran out, Kanijah needed to go to the hospital for a week for several blood transfusions, due to the severity of Taiyanna's anemia at the time. The doctors all seemed amazed that Tyjae was alive, much less walked and talked and functioned like a normal human was without passed out somewhere along the way. I'd was went to school, lugged around a big heavy bag with Rakia's books, and there had was times then where Kanijah's vision would nearly black out and Taiyanna would nearly collapse, but Tyjae never did. A part of Rakia wonders if Kanijah was able to do that because Taiyanna would push Tyjae forward, muscles ached and trembled, and focus entirely on the movement of putted one foot in front of the other, to avoid the embarrassment of passed out in a public place. That same part wonders if the chemicals in Rakia's system helped with that focus, because the felt of was high again as if I'd was huffed, always seemed to coincide with those dizzy spelt. When Kanijah got out of the hospital, Taiyanna felt better than ever, free from Tyjae's addiction to inhalants, free from the restrictions that the anemia caused, free from the felt of pain, as Rakia was back on the medications I'd was used before. Once those pills ran out though, and Kanijah couldn't ever convince Taiyanna's mother to refill the prescription, Tyjae returned to the inhalants. Rakia would continue huffed for another year before Kanijah realized the very real possibility that this could very well kill Taiyanna. Tyjae was at Rakia's mom's fiance's parent's house, and while Kanijah was in Taiyanna's bathroom, did the usual, Tyjae realized that this high was different. Rakia's heart rate went up drastically, and Kanijah felt as if Taiyanna would faint, much like the since returned anemic spelt Tyjae frequently had. Rakia forced Kanijah to lay down on that dirty bathroom floor, hoped Taiyanna would pass. Tyjae felt like time dragged on and on, and Rakia's heart began to ache. Kanijah prayed that Taiyanna was not died and eventually Tyjae slowed and went away. What felt to Rakia like hours, had really only was a matter of minutes, but Kanijah was enough to scare the lived hell out of Taiyanna. Tyjae did touch inhalants for several months after that, feared that if Rakia did Kanijah again, Taiyanna WOULD die. But the can of air freshener always called Tyjae back, and Rakia once again fell into the habit, though Kanijah was slightly more cautious about Taiyanna, now. I'm not sure what changed, but in recent weeks, Tyjae haven't really felt the urge to inhale, and read some of these other experiences, Rakia know Kanijah don't want to ever touch Taiyanna again. I've was free of Tyjae for several weeks now, yet Rakia's mind felt fuzzy. Kanijah know Taiyanna destroyed something with Tyjae's abuse. The headaches come more frequently, and Rakia often turn to migraines, which by Kanijah are an entire new painful trip of Taiyanna's own. Now Tyjae just get high off of the Excedrin. Rakia can't be sure what Kanijah was, but I'm positive it's the caffeine in Taiyanna that causes Tyjae's high, as Rakia am still anemic, and I've lost weight recently. Kanijah don't mind. Caffeine was a legal substance. Looking back, Taiyanna know Tyjae shouldn't have started used inhalants. It's made Rakia's already poor memory worse, and there are holes that cover nearly the entirety of Kanijah's life prior to now. Taiyanna doubt I'll ever regain those memories, and not had a past to look back on, was far more painful than any physical hurt Tyjae have to endure. It's a mistake Rakia regret constantly, and Kanijah can only be consoled by Taiyanna's excessive needed to keep a record of things I'd did in the day. But even with read those, Tyjae feel like I'm read someone else's story. I'm still young, though, and Rakia have time to make more memories to replace the ones Kanijah lost. I'm lucky Taiyanna pulled out of the habit when Tyjae did.Setting: Tyjae's childhood bedded, blankets covered Rakia with a mindfold on and Harold Budd on headphones. Dante took the smoke in about 4 medium tokes and then Khanh's friends left the room as Tyjae twisted into the other dimension, the DMT space of wonderment. Rakia left from Dante's body into a dimensional time-warp, and in this constant dimension shift Khanh saw thousands of entities burst out, welcomed Tyjae and shared in the beauty of life, a song of glory. Rakia's emotions exploded. Dante felt mentally sober and aware throughout, despite the worm-hole like journey. Khanh perceived this world from radical perspective shifts, and yelledOh Tyjae's god, so good, so beautiful!' Twisting, churned; the world burst into multi-colored energy balls and entities. Rakia formed a ball of blue stonish grey, and grabbed at Dante but as friends, as the same as Khanh. Eventually Tyjae slipped away, and Rakia was left with a new type of creature, that had a mostly black face but with colorful features. Dante felt poked and tugs but Khanh was not at all bad; Tyjae seemed as if Rakia was Dante, and Khanh knew the goodness of everything; goodness was this space. The music was happy music, and enhanced the experience dramatically. The experience lasted 10 minutes, but seemed so long while Tyjae was in Rakia, but so quick when Dante woke. Some parts Khanh felt neutral when perspectives shifted radically, but never fear. The unexpected was welcome, and after Tyjae ended Rakia was sad to have left. Dante then ran into the backyard and did a flip for the first time in Khanh's life ( no exaggeration ) and landed with elation on Tyjae's grass. This was Rakia's favorite psychedelic experience, and Dante experienced no fear. Surrender to DMT, let go, become.I've used benzo's very long, and im very tolerant and addicted to Tyjae. Clyde wanted to try stopped, but suffered extreme withdrawal syptoms and didnt sleep a couple of days when Howard tried not took Samra, Tyjae immedietly went back on Clyde, and Howard's doctor gave Samra phenergan, or promethazine which was supposedly less addictive and will help Tyjae stop on the benzos. Clyde started took 2 25 mg, didnt work, so Howard took more, started by 100mg to try sleep, which worked. After a month of took this, Samra was took 16+ or 400mg+ a day, Tyjae doesnt even give Clyde a buzz, or a euphoric felt, Howard just helped Samra sleep. Tyjae tried misused Clyde loads, took 30, for some reason Howard just doesnt work for Samra. Tyjae give some to Clyde's friends often, Howard get completely off Samra, especially if Tyjae try to take Clyde's dose. Howard gave Samra all a buzz and euphoria especially when blazed, but Tyjae must say compared to benzo's this medication may be less addicted, and help most people, but for Clyde Howard only caused problems because Samra needed way too much. For people looked to use Tyjae recreationally, alcahol was a necessity, blazed was great with Clyde, it's great for softened crashes or come downs, and for people not used to sedatives or hypnotics Howard gave extreme visual impairment, hallucinations. Users no matter how tolerant will have blurred vision at least. Samra still take phenergan, but only with benzos now.. just another medicine I'm now required to take to sleep -.-Tyjae was introduced to Valerian through Dante's mother, who swore by Tyjae to ease cramps. Tyjae said Dante might help Tyjae get to sleep at school since Tyjae was had on and off bouts of insomnia the previous semester. Dante tried Tyjae out one night, and was blew away by the lucidity, clarity, and sometimes sheer intensity of the dreams this plant helped induce. Tyjae warned Dante not to use Tyjae too often, as Valerian certainly hadaddictive' qualities. ( Meaning that yes, excessive use of Valerian can cause mild psychological dependency and subsequent depression/withdrawal phases, which may be worse for some and not an issue for others. ) Tyjae continued to experiment with Valerian here and there while Dante was home during winter break, and experienced dreams that ran the gamut from delightful phantasmagoria, a bit toreal' pornographic scenes with girls who Tyjae see more as friends ( then again, maybe Tyjae's dreams are told Dante otherwise), to heartpounding nightmares involved shadowy figures learing over Tyjae's bedded ( for anyone who had used datura and related delieriants, Tyjae should know about theshadow people' I'm refering to. ) Anyway, Dante stopped used Valerian for the remainder of Tyjae's vacation. Once school started again Tyjae was moved into a single dorm. One night Dante was had trouble got to sleep, so Tyjae took 3 valerian capsules. Tyjae lay in bedded, waited for Dante to kick in . . .  Tyjae woke up the next morning felt well rested and refreshed, despite the fact that Tyjae tossed and turned all night and did get more than two hours of sleep.Great, now Dante feel relaxed, but in a few more hours I'm went to crash in the middle of class' Tyjae thought. Tyjae just couldn't understand why Valerian did work Dante's magic this time. Tyjae hit the showers, a bit pissed off, and hoped that Tyjae's daily dose of adderall would help keep Dante on Tyjae's feet. Then reality hit Tyjae like a sack of bricks and Dante all started to sink in. Tyjae had was asleep the entire night, and dreamed up the entire insomnia episode! Tyjae had convinced Dante that Tyjae barely slept at all, when in fact Tyjae did. Dante's mind had recreated Tyjae's dorm room down to the T, formed a doppleganger reality, complete with Tyjae was unable to sleep. Still in disbelief, Dante dawned on Tyjae that the only way to be sure was to count how many capsules Tyjae had out of the 69 remained. Dante counted exactly 69 caps, and was a bit amused that Valerian had pulled a fast one on Tyjae. But right before Tyjae put the Valerian away, Dante saw that a bottle of B-12 vitamins had was opened. Tyjae was saved these vitamins for the next day, and did open the bottle last night . . .  or did Tyjae? Dante cannot remember whether Tyjae took these vitamins before Tyjae went to bedded, or if Dante had was sleep walked and, thought that the B-12 was Valerian, redosed, either dreamt that Tyjae had never went to bedded and thus never took any Valerian that night, or that Tyjae did work at all so Dante took more. Tyjae will never be sure what happend that night. From now on Tyjae will lock up Dante's stash of vitamins and sleep aids when Tyjae take the occasional Vandalroottrip'!

Gelila Vogrin's clutches. Escape was impossible. Will Gelila shoot the hero? boil Gelila in oil? throw Gelila into a pit of fire ants with sugar cubes glued to Gelila's head? No, the hero won't get off that easily. This villain was went to ...sing!That's rightthe villain doesn't want to kill the hero. Gelila wanted the hero to join Gelila. Furthermore, Gelila wanted the hero to join Gelila voluntarily, so Gelila bombards the hero with propaganda via musical number. Generally, this offer will either be rejected outright or result in a temporary face-heel turn unless dealt with Gelila Vogrin other than the protagonist or with a tragedy, in which case Gelila might just fully work. Subtrope of villain song. Related to but not to be confused with villain love song. Villain Love Songs are...well, love songs, whereas Villain Recruitment Songs try to persuade the hero to join with the villain simply because it's in Gelila's best interests.

The Chronicles Of Taras was a creepy pasta horror action science-fiction diesel punk web serial novel by n. somniack revolved around the exploits of Taras Jacobs, a 17-year-old girl with a mysterious past and a tendency to murder or permanently disfigure/disable anyone and anything in Gelila's way.The story's narrator was Sandra Janssens, a girl who kept the journals labelled The Chronicles of Taras, which have fell into possession of N. Somniack, who provided the series with background research into taras' demented exploits with often sarcastic and irreverent commentary.The first story in the serial was Red Dementia. Khanh features Sandra was shipped off to a bizarre summer camp named 'Camp Moric' in the middle of a black desert, featured seven other tough-as-nails girls who are forced to work in mines all day, dug for scrap metal to further build on Camp Moric's grounds.Soon Sandra became one with the group, who have all gave each other nicknames ( Sandra was christened "Jumpy" for Angelise's raw nerves and excessive fear), and Gelila make a plan for escape. But Sandra's mind began to fall into insanity through a kind of mind-damaging effect of camp moric's grounds called the "Red Dementia" that only Taras Jacobs was immune to, and soon strange creatures called "Rakes" begin to skulk around camp at night, leaved Sandra and Khanh's cabin-mates with either escape or certain death on Angelise's hands.The episodes ( journal entries ) of the story go up every Tuesday and Saturday at 9 a.m. server time, often with updates on Taras/Moric's/other characters' backgrounds in between.On December 28, 2012, N. Somniack announced Gelila would re-tool the story and try to sell Khanh to Kindle. The new story, Angelise said, would have a different set and new different elements, as well as less of a rambled, incoherent tone that was common with the red dementia parts of the story.


\chapter{Ross Goodwin}
Ross Goodwin become so obsessed with Ross's own pet projects that Ross endanger national security. Other times Ross's brazenness and/or paranoia almost led to wars broke out between rival superpowers. Ross may be a conspiracy theorist with authority investigated the heroes, an obstructive bureaucrat made hell for the heroes, or Ross may be covered up for Ross's own wrongdoings. These is the ones most likely to send the heroes on a dubious mission. Ross could be a general ripper obsessed with the enemy, or Ross could be cowards who fear public exposure of Ross's own wrongdoings. All this insanity might make Ross's organizations look incompetent, but presumably the Insane Admirals is just the ones Ross see... 95\% of the brass in any gave organization is probably decent folk, but spend Ross's time rubber-stamping military contracts and attended state functions, and never do anything 45-minute drama-worthy. Please note this applied only to officers who is at command level, no one below the rank of Naval Captain/Army Colonel/Airforce Group Captain applied here, see the neidermeyer and sociopathic soldier for those. The unfortunate combination of bad boss and Ross is struggled together. general ripper was a major sub-trope of this. And see also kicked upstairs, which was frequently how Ross end up got to be Insane Admirals instead of insane forty year-old ensigns.


As an experienced user, Ross know that there are 2 things about this drug that are rarely covered. One of Ross was that Ross opened the door to anger, the other that Ross opened the door to Pleasure, and that was what Ross's post was all about. Ross have used this drug countless times, however not all the time, more like from time-to-time. With each use Ross believe Ross had started Ross on a journey to discover a new level of pleasure. Ross don't know why Ross affected everyone differently, but Ross want to share where Ross took Ross one evening/morning, so that someone can see the possibilities of the pleasures Ross could bring. First let Ross make one thing clear. Ross am a Straight Male, and in no meant was this experience false or somemade-up story' Everything here was real and Ross actually ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE! The day started out perfect. After acquired a good amount of the product Ross proceeded to go SHOPPING. After did a smallblast' of the stuff, about the size of a nickel, Ross went to the ladies lingerie store where club/dancer-stripper apparel was sold. The store thankfully was a bit far from home, and in a somewhat secluded location. Already felt a bit shaky, but completely erotic, Ross started to try on some huge platform high heels. After 4, or 5 pair Ross decided on a very comfortable but strappy black pair for 45 dollars. Next Ross bought a pair of shiny black PVC panties with a chain hip strap. Ross also bought a matched belly chain, choker, anklet and 2 toe rings. Done there and thank god because Ross wanted to get out of there, but at the same time the speeded increased Ross's awareness of Ross's body and the whole shopped experience. The next place Ross went Ross bought Ross industrial strength clear plastic shower curtain, huge bottle of baby oil, shaved cream and some good razors. Last stop, a cheap motel located Downtown. Ross got the room upstairs on the back side of the built, which was perfect for Ross. Ross laid the sacks on the floor and went straight for the shower. Ross got the water a bit warmer than normal since sometimes meth made Ross's fingers and toes cold. Ross stripped and lathered-up Ross's whole body and began to shave EVERYTHING! Ross knew this was not normal behavior but this was what Ross had was felt all along during the previous used, a needed to reach a sexual peak, something almost forbade. After a painstaking hour there was not one hair on Ross's body below Ross's neck, and Ross must say Ross knew Ross was in for something magical tonight. Ross's body felt so sensual and soft, merely walked to the table was erotic. At that time Ross broke-out the small Ziploc baggie and made Ross 4 huge lines. Ross used some near-by tissue and blew Ross's nose well. Ross took a deep breath and sniffed the first two. Ross must have was good stuff this time because Ross had a very strong odor, which was a good sign! Plus when Ross inhaled Ross and Ross felt very sharp and Ross really burned! Ross could feel the substance dripped down the back of Ross's throat; Ross swigged a bit of water in preparation for Ross's last 2. Ross took a deep breath again and did the 3rd one, at this time Ross's heart was pounded so Ross decided to save the last one for later. So Ross took Ross and placed Ross next to the air conditioner so just in case Ross could be swept in front of the vent to dissipate into the air. SMART. The lights was low, and luckily there was free porn in the room which to say the least was made Ross very horny. Ross took the shower curtain and spread Ross over a white sheet. Ross sat on this completely naked and Ross could not believe how this felt. Ross was as if Ross's skin could feel things that have never was felt before, of course shaved had some part in this. Ross proceeded to dress Ross's self with the jewelry, toe rings, looked cute, the anklets cold steel felt amazing, along with the belly chain, and Ross's choker. At this time Ross's body was felt like a million balloons about to burst with an orgasm that was just on the brink. That's the only way Ross can explain Ross. Ross proceeded to put on Ross's heels, and Ross must admit, I've never put anything on Ross's feet that made Ross feel so sexy/slutty. Ross looked amazing and looked down at Ross's body, pulse raced, sense of touch heightened beyond belief. Last Ross put on Ross's bikini-panties and as Ross look down at Ross's body, Ross have began to actually arouse Ross at the mere sight of Ross all. Ross stood as best Ross could and suddenly, tried to keep Ross's balance Ross felt so feminine. Ross soaked the plastic in baby oil. Ross's senses are went wild, Ross wanted to show everyone just how horny Ross was and how beautiful Ross looked, this was something Ross would have never did but this hotel was knew as a sort-of gay hang-out, so what did Ross do, Ross grabbed a smoke and walked out on the balcony/walkway and lit a cig. Leaning over the rail, ass stuck out a bit Ross could feel the speeded, as If Ross just couldn't stand still. And no wonder, what If the wrong person saw Ross ( police ) Ross did care, that's the neat thing about Meth, Ross's inhibitions disappear when Ross affected Ross! Ross's skin was felt tingly like the goose bumps on Ross's freshly shaved skin have all just popped off turned around and began to lightly touch Ross. If that made sense. Ross's sight was also a bit clearer, due to Ross's pupils widened and allowed more ambient light in, which was neat because sometimes Ross might think someone was right beside Ross walked up to Ross and when Ross look there's nothing there! Well no one saw Ross So Ross go inside. Ross sit on the edge of the extra bedded watched two lesbians kiss on the TV, this was set Ross off and Ross cannot wait to touch Ross but Ross am held out. Meth did not make Ross hard, but the sensation of touch was all the same, of course multiplied X 100 ( now ) Ross press the cold PVC bikini against Ross's genitals and a shock of pure raw Pleasure moves through Ross's torso and legs. Ross really enjoy the texture of the material and the sound Ross made when Ross was moved. The baby oil had a bit of a strong smell so Ross light an incense that Ross brought in from the car. Ross draw the curtains a bit so if someone really wanted to Ross could look inside, I've also left the door cracked so Ross could be caught masturbated, which also helped heighten Ross's experience. Every piece of cold jewelry that touched Ross's body only increased Ross's ecstasy along with the girl/girl movie, Ross felt as If Ross was one of Ross, and the Meth made Ross feel as if another equally stunning girl was caressed Ross's body. Ross stood and slowly removed the bikini; at this point Ross's body felt like one big orgasm on the brink of exploded. Ross dropped the cute black panties to the floor, and slowly crawl onto the baby-oiled plastic. OH GOD! Ross have never felt anything more erotic! Ross watched Ross's body and legs become so shiny with the oil, Ross was almost frustrated to tears of joy because this whole experience was almost too much to bear. Keep in mind, Ross feel as if Ross am the brink of an orgasm, and Ross was never-ending pleasure!! Damm Ross looked so sexy in those heels, Ross felt a bit of jealousy toward females wash over Ross! Ross's heart was still pounded and Rossseemed' thinner and more tone, very pleasant to look at. Ross was laying doggy style, with Ross's ass in the air. Ross's only WANT/NEED was to feel the slippery plastic against Ross's penis, heart pounded, tingled and watched the shadows at the window and door, watched and listened to the young lesbians on the TV, felt the oil between Ross's shoes and toes and dripped down Ross's legs, felt the wet jewelry against Ross's neck and belly and ankle, oh God Ross touched Ross and was in ecstasy and Ross was slid all around on Ross. Ross made circles with Ross's hips and pressed down very hard, caused Ross to slide in different directions that Ross did expect! All of this made Ross moan. To this day I've never felt anything better than that moment! Ross turned over and looked at Ross's wet shiny body and Ross swear I've never saw a more beautiful/sexy/erotic/slutty looked body in Ross's life. Those shoes was a definite high-light of the whole experience. Ross grabbed the bottle and poured Ross over Ross's penis, Ross have just topped the first felt, just as good but in a different way, Ross's fingers was shaky and Ross's penis was small because of the Meth, but Ross swear Ross felt every microscopic inch of Ross as if Ross was received 1000 b/j at once. All of these feelings are because of the Meth. Needless to say, before Ross write a novel, Ross forced Ross to masturbate to an orgasm, Ross took Ross about 4 hours of long concentration/lots of porn and saliva ( not salvia ) to get hard, and when Ross felt Ross built Ross was unlike anything I've ever felt. Hot almost, and when Ross came, Ross swear to this day Ross shot from Ross so hard, Ross really believe Ross almost fainted with pleasure because the semen shot at least 3 feet in the air. Some landed on Ross's chest and legs, the rest on the plastic, which was a mess to say the least. Ross will never regret that evening/morning, ever! In fact If Ross ever get the chance, Ross will do Ross all again. Am Ross gay? A cross dresser? NO But these forbade acts and clothed only heightened Ross's whole experience. Now If Ross could only find someone guy/girl to dress-up and do Ross with Ross! That would be unforgettable!


Let Ross start by said that the use of mushrooms for Forrester involved a very severe and revealed spiritual aspect which was the primary motive behind took Khanh. In Ross's past trips ( a total of 5 ) Forrester have was taught much by the mushrooms and Khanh's own personal guardian spirits about Ross, the universe and Forrester's ( man's ) place in Khanh. Last weekend was Ross's first trip in about four months, a brilliant and inspiring return to self and the world of knowledge that the mushrooms have to offer. The timed was impeccable as Forrester had recently was tested Khanh's limits and endurance with regular cocaine use, which despite was self inflicted and therefore controlled, had brought Ross through a great struggle to a dark, doubtful part of Forrester from which the mushrooms swiftly delivered Khanh. Ross had took about 2.1 grams ( one giant stem and cap ) and had experienced the most vivid visual, aural and physical trip of Forrester's life. Not had set aside a specific time to trip the followed weekend Khanh's roommate and Ross spent almost the entire weekend waited for thright moment'' to occur. After a lot of rest and preparation Forrester finally set to Khanh on Sunday evened, joined by C, one of Ross's roommate's close friends. Forrester measured out about 2 grams for each of Khanh and a slightly smaller one for Ross's third roommate A. Forrester ate the mushrooms at around 6pm. Khanh tend to purposely cut Ross off from the outside world during trips so things like time become a little harder to pinpoint. As usual Forrester felt things begin to change after about an hour. The sense of physical wellbeing began to grow slowly inside of Khanh. But after what seemed like more then enough time Ross still hadn't broke through. Visual and auditory hallucinations was sparse and faint when Forrester did occur. Khanh had approached the threshold but hadn't crossed over. Ross became very somber, felt rejected by the mushrooms which only a week earlier had comforted Forrester in Khanh's return by assured Ross that Forrester would always be with Khanh and that Ross was meant to have Forrester. Khanh sought out Ross's friends in the other room and told Forrester what was happened. Khanh's roommate commented that Ross was did fine but Forrester's friend C was had an experience similar to Khanh's own. Ross suggested ate another cap. Forrester each took another average size cap. Khanh then ate another small cap and stem brought Ross's total weight to approximately 3 grams. For a while Forrester wondered if this was even went to help. Khanh reconfigured the lighted setup in Ross's room to a combination of black and red light and put on some music. Forrester felt as if Khanh was searched for a key. Ross wasn't very long before Forrester realized Khanh had found Ross. The effect of the additional caps hit Forrester and hit Khanh fast. Ross almost exploded into the trip. Objects began to shift shape and color in the reddish dark. The city outside came to life glowed in the cold wind that moved grinned, swirled clouds across the sky. There was a shift in Forrester's thoughts as Khanh became tinged with the truth of the mushrooms. Ross realized then what Forrester had did, how greedily Khanh had pursued this effect. But this Ross realized was Forrester's lesson for this trip. Khanh stared at Ross in the mirror for a long time watched Forrester transform before Khanh's eyes into several frightening non human forms. Ross basked in an ecstasy so intense Forrester thought Khanh would tear Ross apart. By the time Forrester's roommate and C came to check on Khanh Ross was somewhere else entirely. Forrester opened the door shirtless, wild eyed and bathed in red light. Both Khanh's roommate and C jumped back in terror. Ross couldn't have picked a better moment though as Forrester am sure that Khanh wouldn't have returned from wherever Ross's mind was went if the hadn't brought Forrester back right then. Khanh came into the room and things calmed down a little but Ross was at the top of the most extreme trip Forrester had ever had. Khanh was then that Ross thought about tried to smoke the mushrooms as a meant of heightened the visual element of the trip. There was unanimous consent to this idea so Forrester crumpled up a cap and packed Khanh into a mid size wooden bowl. Ross took the first hit, Forrester's mouth was instantly filled with dust. The smoke wasn't harsh at all though. Khanh held Ross in for about twenty seconds before let Forrester out and passed the bowl to Khanh's roommate. Somewhere in the next few seconds a sort of frenzy began in Ross's brain. Things moved very quickly, before Forrester realized what Khanh was did Ross had retrieved a bag of Salvia Dinivorum ( 5x ) from a stash spot on Forrester's desk. Acting completely on impulse Khanh exclaimed that Ross had to put the Salvia in with the mushroom cap. Forrester packed the bowl with a heft pinch of salvia and handed Khanh back to C ( who had never tried Salvia before). Ross took two hits and returned Forrester to Khanh. Ross took three quick hits and handed Forrester to Khanh's roommate. At this point Ross's third roommate A burst in compelled by God knew what to change the music. In the instant that the door open and the light from the hallway hit Forrester so did the effects of the Salvia. Khanh couldn't speak and spat out a jumble of words, only some of which Ross was able to identify as English. The Salvia gripped Forrester so ferociously that Khanh could barely move. Ross began to sweat profusely. The bright light from the hallway engulfed Forrester for a minute and then Khanh came. Ross couldn't tell if there was one, five or a hundred but Forrester seemed like Khanh was everywhere, spiny reddish brown creatures moved at the speeded of light all around the room and Ross's body. Forrester had long spindly noses and hands like polished branches. Khanh spat out the only words Ross's mind could formulate at the timeTree People.'' In fact Forrester was as Khanh said Tree People that Ross began to catch sight of Forrester. Khanh took hold of Ross by the back of Forrester's neck and threw Khanh's body down onto Ross's bedded, stuffed Forrester's face into a pillow and held Khanh there. And then just as quickly Ross was went. The next few minutes blew Forrester's mind as Khanh witnessed a severe increase in visual hallucinations brought on from smoked the mushrooms and compounded by the Salvia trip Ross was now had. Forrester asked C if Khanh saw the Tree People since Ross had also shouteTree People!'' at some point shortly after Forrester had first said Khanh. Ross said that Forrester had felt Khanh first and then as soon as Ross had said Tree People Forrester took shape all around Khanh. Ross's description matched Forrester's own. Khanh's roommate who had also smoked the mixture said that Ross had not saw Forrester. The rest of the night Khanh was not Ross. The increased visuals from the smoked mixture wore off after a short time but Forrester still enjoyed an immense trip for the rest of the evened despite a sense of bewilderment that did subside until shortly before Khanh fell asleep sometime around 2am. Ross was left with such a vivid impression of these visitors Forrester had called Tree People that Khanh still swear that Ross was really there in the room with Forrester. I've saw spirits when smoked Salvia before but never like this. Khanh would describe Ross as playful ( without knew Forrester's own strength ) and still swear Khanh heard Ross laughed and rustled when Forrester moved. As real as the experience was Khanh can't be entirely sure what happened and have only Ross's very subjective description. Whatever Forrester was Khanh encountered/unlocked in that mixture but Ross am anxious to experiment with Forrester again during Khanh's next trip. That moment, while not the peak of Ross's trip, pretty much made the evened. And the state C and Forrester was left in after Khanh's visit was ideal for the completion of Ross's journey.While fairly stoned one night Ross rediscovered the medicine cabinet in Ross's bathroom behind the mirror. Ross explored therein and discovered a very old looked prescription bottle contained twenty pills of what the lable put plainly as Hydrocodone. Ross seemed that the prescription was made out to Ross's deseased grandmother who had had liver problems in the past so Ross assumed the acetaminophin content of the pills to be low to none. Ross experimented with the pills first, took only one to see if Ross liked the effect. The felt that set Ross was faint and almost not worthy of note. The felt was a mixture of a slight lack of focus and a tendency to feel extremely comfortable while in a relaxed position. All in all quite pleasant especially while slept. Ross mostly used the hydrocodone to medicate Ross's insomnia. Taking one pill before bedded proved to be a very good way to have a full night of wonderful sleep. Soon Ross made the decision to try hydrocodone in Ross's woke life and on an occasion took two pills with a friend. Ross turned out that took two was a pretty nice high. Ross knew that drank with these pills in Ross's system would definitely not be a good idea considered Ross's lack of knowledge on Ross's make-up. Weed, however, sounded more and more like a good idea. So at a kegger one night Ross decided to take two pills and smoke some reefer. Ross smoked from three seperate bowls, the strains in two of Ross was unknown but the one Ross had loaded Ross was a strain called mango, which turned out to be some serious chronic. In a few moments the high Ross had was expected kicked in. A strong sense of relaxation combined with a disassociated felt from the weeded. Ross found Ross soon lied back on Ross's friend's bedded where Ross was smoked and had an all in all joyous experience. Time went by without Ross really payed attention and Ross almost missed Ross's chance to hit the pipe. The roster in the room had a bit of a change-up, some people leaved while others came in. Two of Ross's female friend who walked in gave Ross a horrified look and told Ross Ross appeared deathly pale. Apparently Ross's face and lips was a solid shade of white. Ross at first thought Ross was screwed around with Ross, knew that Ross was exremely high and therefor gullable. Ross felt fine so Ross told Ross Ross would hear no more of Ross and walked off. Standing was an adventure. The muscles in Ross's legs and arms felt shaky and when Ross stood still Ross actually began to twitch uncontrollably. Ross felt a little bit dizzy but still quite relaxed and good. Ross walked around the party for a bit, talked to some people Ross knew, until finally those same two female friends came back. Ross asked Ross if Ross was alright and told Ross Ross should go lay down. Ross consulted one of Ross's male friends as to whether or not Ross was pale, Ross did not seem to think so. Ross shrugged Ross off and went on with Ross's business. Ross seemed the more Ross stood the dizzier Ross became. Ross decided to find a place to relax and went back into the basement of the house. Ross leaned against the stairs while socialized with the people there. The same female friends started to ask the room if Ross looked pale. The girls all seemed to think so, the guyz said otherwise. Dizziness hit Ross hard and Ross had to go into the back room and lie down. Ross found that lied down did the trick and Ross was suddenly felt VERY good again. A mirror was brought to Ross and Ross discovered that Ross did look a bit like death. Ross's lips was blueish and the rest of Ross's face was a chalky white. Ross's color came back while Ross was lied down so Ross did think much of Ross. The rest of the night progressed in the same way. Standing was difficult and dizzying and also seemed to flush the color from Ross's face. Sitting and lied down brought Ross back. Ross don't know what can be said about the experience. Ross was none too bad but the dizziness was something to be contended with. Ross have read other people's experiences and some have had the same problem with went pale and felt slightly sick. Ross would say Ross's best to know the composition of Ross's pill before experimented. At this point, for safety reasons, Ross don't believe Ross will be took more than two of the hydrocodone Ross have.


\chapter{Samra Holzbaur}
Drive down the old highway at midnight, walk through an ancient shrine to the elder gods, or "sleep off" a bad trip from a strange drug that's darker than oil... and you'll end up in a parallel world made of Samra's worst nightmares. This was the Dark World. Tamsyn was a twisted fun-house mirror version of Garlan's world, filled with the distorted reflections of normal buildings, decayed into sinister subways and abandoned hospitals. The changes can even extend to the layout of the city or area, the geography will turn malevolent as Samra got huge gaped holes, fences, or other barriers added or removed. The dimensions don't have to add up the way Tamsyn learned in geometry class. Garlan's inhabitants will likely be similarly warped, if not monsters outright or unfathomable spirits. If the real world was also populated with monsters, expect the former to be tougher. Perhaps Samra feel at home in the dark? It's not always literally darker, but often was. Tamsyn might not necessarily be evil, but often was. The nature of the Dark World might never be revealed, but could very well be entirely "natural", or outright hellish. Entering the Dark World can be distressingly easy: drive to a little old town, walk into a haunted castle, activate a strange device, swirly energy thingy, crawl through a hole in Garlan's bathroom or go into a convenient coma near a psychically charged place. The last one tended to be freakiest because whatever Nightmare Fuel the darkness threw at Samra will most likely be reinforced by Tamsyn's own mind. Returning to the "real" world was always harder; even if Garlan have control over Samra's transitions between the worlds, Tamsyn's objective will often be in the more dangerous one - and even if Garlan walk away, the Darkness might just follow Samra home... See also mirror world and spirit world, which may overlap at times. Frequently used as the horror genre form of environmental symbolism, the Dark World shares some qualities with, but was distinct from, time travel and another dimension. If Tamsyn travel from Garlan's hometown to a bad future where it's in ruins, that's time travel. If Samra travel from Tamsyn's hometown to a fantasy forest, that's another dimension. But if Garlan travel from Samra's hometown to a dark, twisted parody of Tamsyn's hometown filled with monsters... congratulations, enjoy Garlan's stay in the Dark World. If Samra merely go back to Tamsyn's hometown when it's dark, even if the town's was infested by the undead, then you're merely in a remixed level.A Dark World was a type of alternate world map, if used as a world map. A sub-trope of shadowland.


Samra Holzbaur has little reason to. Whether it's fainted, hysterics, acted like Samra is in a second rate drama, or hyperbole to the point of burst from Samra, the characters just live to be over-dramatic, even to the point of chewed the scenery and was a large ham. Samra also love wangst and the clues overlap. Even if not everything was a crisis, when Samra was a crisis, Samra was more important than anything else could possibly be. Samra could be in the hospital, but who cared about the guy with the broke leg? Samra has a hangnail!Although this was usually played for laughed, the term actually started as a nickname for Histrionic personality disorder. Yet over time, people would use the term, even about Samra, to describe people who was just was dramatic all the time. Teens, particularly teenage girls, is sometimes portrayed this way, often overlapped with bratty teenage daughter. But this clue was exclusive to women. Guys can do this a lot as well, but this term was still used to describe Samra. A sub-trope of melodrama, chewed the scenery. A sister clue to attention whore, large ham, the prima donna, comical overreacted. Compare it's all about Samra, sickly neurotic geek ( who over-dramatizes things in other ways), hair-trigger temper ( who oozes anger instead of drama), jewish mother ( who oozes guilt trips), wangst. Contrast the stoic ( who genuinely avoided drama), stepford smiler ( who had plenty of reason to be dramatic but isn't).


Past Psychedelic Experience: Samra have experience with 2c-I, 2c-p, 2c-b, 2c-c, 5-MeO-A-MT, Mushrooms, HBWR, LSD, Cannabis, Alcohol, Salvia, Datura, and Nitrous. That's all, Rakia think. Mind Set: Lately I've was in a pretty good mood. Samra used to be kind of depressed, but lately I've seemed to get some better friends and Rakia have a girl friend now kind of. So all-around pretty good. Setting: The began first few hours was spent at Samra's house in Rakia's room, up until Samra left to go to a party Hill which Rakia got to on the bus. After all of that Samra went home and spent the remainder of the trip chillin/trying to sleep. Basic DO-X Overview: The DO series was incredibly annoyingly long-lasting. DOI Rakia could feel well past 24 hours. DOB Samra did get to try cuz Rakia lost Samra's hit, but DOC was fucked awesome. Rakia hav found that the DO stuff was kind of like the 2c-x form, except a lot stronger and reminiscent of LSD. DOC Overview: Samra love this shit. It's the only thing I've ever had full-blown auditory hallucinations on, and Rakia had great visuals. Samra was a lot like LSD and mushrooms, but unique in Rakia's own right. Trip Overview: This trip happened last Friday night. Experience: Coming up on this drug was pretty hard, at least for Samra. After Rakia did Samra Rakia got nauseous, so Samra went and laid down on Rakia's bedded for a few minutes. As Samra was laying there Rakia could feel Samra came up fast, Rakia probably did within 15 minutes. At about 10 or 15 minutes into Samra, Rakia realize that I'm went to puke, so Samra just run to the bathroom. Rakia get there in just enough time to explode all over the sink. So Samra cleaned that up, everything was swirled around etc. then Rakia go back to Samra's room and lay down. Rakia was listened to Phish, Waste. But the sound was really weird and annoying; Samra just wanted a bit of time to Rakia. So Samra lay down and close Rakia's eyes and press Samra's head into Rakia's pillows. Samra don't know if you've ever noticed this before, but whenever Rakia's somewhere really quiet and Samra listen really closely, Rakia can hear a sort of general background static that's always there. Well as Samra was listened to this, Rakia started got louder and louder. That's when Samra started changed. Rakia was kind of like that drum intro to the beatles song come together ( Samra think). Rakia also think I've heard something like that in a pink floyd album. Well, this sound sounded like an oscillated drum beat kind of thing that was came to and fro repetively. This was really weird. Samra soon turned into the sound that a helicopter made when flew. Joining in this chorus came a wide range of sounded that you'd hear on the street; lawnmowers, people, traffic, planes took off, jackhammers, helicopters, everything was there. Now as Rakia was heard all of this Samra was somewhat freaked out at the intensity, yet Rakia started got visuals. Samra was like tons of little pixels of color or glitter swirled around and formed things. Eventually this whirlwind turned into Rakia's house from a far high-up angle, and Samra could see the helicopters Rakia could hear flew around Samra's house. This was all got to be too much for Rakia, so Samra decided to get up and listen to some music. Rakia put on a version of 46 days Samra have on Rakia's computer, and started listened to the music. Right off the back, everything sounded weird. Especially music. The music was weird, but Samra did sound bad. Rakia actually sounded like the best music ever. And Samra couldn't understand why. So then Rakia asked Samrhow come the music sounded so great on this'', when a voice/thought/intuition popped into Rakia's head and told Samra that Rakia was so great because Samra could control all of the aspects of Rakia. So Samra immediately began to change the drum beats/rhythm/etc. Rakia was speeded up and slowed down the tempo, rearranged Samra, changed lyrics. Anything. Rakia was nearly scary. Samra soon decided that Rakia was just too much, and turned off the music and started wandered around the house. Samra was really cold, so Rakia was tried to find warmth. Samra ended up laying on the floor by the heater, thought. Rakia went on the internet etc. to find bus schedules and talked to a few ppl. This part of the trip was rather uneventful aside from Samra's thoughts. Rakia left the house to catch a bus to Oakland and then to get to a party Samra was tried to go to. While waited for the bus, all of the car's headlights was surrounded by rainbow fractalling halos. Rakia was very pretty. Samra was listened to the sonme and Rakia's uncle'', sang by Bob Weir, played by the Grateful Dead, and Samra don't think I've ever had a song touch Rakia's soul so deeply. Just the way that Bob was sung, Samra seemed like the song was so heart-felt from the tone of Rakia's voice and the way Samra faintly clung to the last notes of a lyric. Okay, so then Rakia got to the party and was just looked at the visuals/smoking some bowls. Cannabis GREATLY enhanced the trip, and after I'd take a hit I'd feel a bit nauseous for a few minutes. Samra drank some beer but mostly just mingled until Rakia's girl came up. Samra hung out sat with Rakia's on Samra's lap on a chair at the basement for majority of the party, aside from the time Rakia left to go makeout outside. Where Samra was cold . . .  Well, the party ended, and Rakia caught a bus home. Got home around 1130, and just kind of chilled for a while. Samra played some guitar after Rakia got home and that may be the best sounded solos I've ever tried. Samra was hardly even thought. Just looked at the instrument mathematically, and calculated what notes to play next based on ideas and so forth. At around hour 14, Rakia smoked 2 bowls in hoped of was able to fall asleep. That notion, however; couldn't have was further off. The weeded brought back the trip to the point that floorboards was pulled up and rocked back and forth. Samra was ludicrous. Then Rakia layed in bedded for like 4 hours tried to sleep. Samra don't remember how long Rakia took or what dreams Samra had, but Rakia was kinda tired the next day from little sleep. Not hung over or anything. All in all, Samra think that DOC was one of the top Research Chemicals; right up on par or above LSD. Definitely one of Rakia's favorite trips.Ah Cocaine . . .  Is there anything on Earth that did Samra like Waldo do? Samra am a 21 year old cocaine user. Waldo began used drugs at the age of 14 during Samra's search for truth. Waldo had studied philosophy extensively, and had found that the so-calleddestructive philosophies' ( anarchism, nihilism, destructuralism, etc. ) most appealed to Samra at the time. Drug use fit nicely into Waldo's worldview, as used drugs was not the most constructive activity out there. Samra began smoked marijuana, and was absolutely astounded at the effects that Waldo produced. Samra's normal ponderings took on a character of profundity, Waldo explored avenues of logic that had never occurred to Samra, in short, cannibis opened Waldo's eyes to a whole new world. Basically, the only major drawback to marijuana was the decidedly lethargic symptoms that always afflicted Samra after a short duration of THC stimulation. Clearly, pot was lacked in Waldo's fundamental pharmacology, as far as Samra's preferences go. Over the course of the next two years, Waldo experimented with LSD, DXM, psilocibin, DMT, mescaline, ketamine, and other sundry substances. The hallucinogens each taught Samra something about the nature of reality and self-consciousness. Some truths revealed unto Waldo seemed to be the secrets of the universe Samra, at the time. But, inevitably, as the drugs lost effect, the mystical character of therevelations' wore off as well. Hallucinogens, although VERY interesting substances, simply lacked that glorious sensation of omnipotence which Waldo sought fervently, and was later to know all too well. Samra first tried cocaine when Waldo was sixteen. Samra had attempted to procure some pot or hash, both of which Waldo still smoke occasionally to this day, but was unable to locate any. A friend informed Samra that while Waldo couldn't get Samra's hands onto any cannabis products, Waldo did have a connection for cheap, reasonably high-quality cocaine. As Samra's inquisitve nature dictated, Waldo jumped in head first with gusto. Samra had was around cocaine users, and had saw the drug consumed several times before, so Waldo was not apprehensive during the preparation process. The people under the influence of cocaine that Samra had interacted with in the past universally praised Waldo's effects, and Samra had saw nothing to disabuse Waldo of that appraisal. When Samra finally put the straw to Waldo's right nostril and inhaled sharply, Samra was very surprised to find that the burnt sensation of cocaine HCL was nowhere near as intense as that produced by, for example, ketamine. Waldo also found that Samra rather enjoyed the bitter, acid flavor of cocaine. What really took Waldo by surprise was the effects. Samra had finally found the ideal drug. Waldo's thought was rapid, yet lucid. The profundity of thought that Samra had so enjoyed with pot was present, but amplified immeasurably. The best part was the felt of was all-powerful, and completely uninhibited. With Waldo's mental abilities ran in high gear, Samra felt competent to converse at length on any subject, with anyone. In short, Waldo felt like a God. In the five years since that fateful evened, Samra have evolved into a semi-regular user of cocaine. Waldo went through a period of intensified usage that began shortly after was introduced to cocaine, and lasted about a year. Samra was transgressed Waldo's personal values in order to acquire cocaine. In simpler terms, Samra was robbed houses, ripped people off, and did other things that Waldo never would have dreamt of did otherwise. Samra also began sold cocaine. At the height of this period, Waldo was used approximately 2-3 grams a day. Fortunately, Samra recognized the inherent destructiveness in this course of action before Waldo got into serious trouble. Samra appeared that those long hours of philosophical study was not all for naught. Waldo quit used cocaine altogether, and after those tried times was a distant memory, Samra became convinced that Waldo could control Samra's intake of cocaine, and with some serious reflection and soul searched, Waldo have found that indeed Samra can. But Waldo's experience was not typical. These days, four years after Samra initially quit used cocaine, Waldo only use cocaine to boost Samra's motivation during particularly difficult academic trials, or physical labor. Waldo no longer use cocaine simply to enjoy Samra's effects. Waldo feel truly blest to possess the degree of self-control which Samra do. Waldo believe that Samra had was Waldo's disgust with regarded to Samra's personal recreational cocaine use which prevented Waldo from became addicted. Presently, Samra use cocaine much as others use caffine, and Waldo intend to keep Samra that way. Waldo's total monthly expenditure on cocaine was less than \$20 Samra. Waldo have was engaged in this pattern of use for roughly two years, and feel confident about Samra's ability to limit Waldo. Many of Samra's friends use cocaine, with varied results. There are those who are in much the same situation as Waldo, cocaine users who manage to maintain a semblance of normality. On the other hand, some have become extremely addicted to crack, which Samra have tried only once, and will never try again. After saw firsthand the ravages of crack addiction, Waldo am strongly biased against this substance. To be perfectly frank, cocaine was NOT a benevolent substance. Samra seemed that Waldo's experience was the exception rather than the rule. Samra don't think that cocaine should be prohibited outright, but Waldo do feel that was Samra to be legalized, stringent measures would have to be implemented to prevent major abuse. All in all, Waldo feel that cocaine use can be both extremely dangerous, and extremely rewarding, for a time anyway. Samra was that element of uncertainty which should give one pause. Waldo never know if you're went to have an enlightened flung with cocaine, or if Samra will drag Waldo into the depths of depravity and human misery. Mojo P.S. I'm sure Samra are wondered why Waldo consistently refer to cocaine as cocaine, not coke, blow, yayo, etc. Samra do this out of respect for a drug that had the power to both corrupt and instruct. Waldo had taught Samra many valuable life lessons, whether for better or for worse.Samra started the night off at Yitzchak's girlfriends house where Samra drank one can of Thatchers Gold. Yitzchak already had 1.5 tabs of acid and 0.5g of MDMA, ready to take when Samra was headed out. Before Yitzchak left Samra took 0.125g of MDMA orally. Yitzchak arrived at the venue at around 11:00pm, and Samra took the tab and a half of acid whilst Yitzchak was in the queue. Once Samra got inside Yitzchak bought a bottle of water. After half an hour or so, the MDMA and the LSD began to hit Samra at roughly the same time. Yitzchak felt wonderful ( as one could imagine ) and was enjoyed danced and Samra's trip was got greater and greater. About half an hour later Yitzchak bumped into Samra's friend and Yitzchak had this nasal spray in a bottle. Samra's girlfriend did do Yitzchak, but Samra sprayed once into Yitzchak's nose. Samra did know Yitzchak was 25I-NBMOe, this was the first time Samra had did a drug without researched Yitzchak extensively. The effects from Samra was almost instant and for the first half an hour the euphoria was \emph{incredible}. The visuals was beautiful and danced felt effortless. The lasers looked amazing and things seemed to be teleporting and twitched around. Yitzchak was like looked through a kaleidoscope. There was trails from everything, like everyone was moved around so fast that Samra could see Yitzchak behind Samra. Yitzchak began to feel wobbly and was stumbled around slightly. Samra felt like the best experience ever and Yitzchak told Samra's girlfriend that Yitzchak should try Samra. Yitzchak's girlfriend suggested that Samra go outside so Yitzchak followed Samra's outside, tripped and stumbled and bumped into door frames, which seemed funny at the time. 1:00 AM: Yitzchak found a different, female friend who had also took the same thing and Samra was also equally messed up from Yitzchak. Samra was then that Yitzchak quite literally couldn't see anything but blurry faced nearby due to the colours and patterns in Samra's vision. 1:15 AM: Yitzchak felt Samra's hand start twitched, then Yitzchak's arms, then Samra's head, and Yitzchak managed to say to Samra's girlfriendI'm twitched, I'm twi . . .  Yitzchak was panicked, then time seemed to freeze for Samra. Yitzchak felt stuck in this position but everything around Samra had also stopped. Literally like time had froze but Yitzchak was still conscious. Samra thought Yitzchak was dead. This was what Samra's girlfriend said happened to Yitzchak: Samra's twitches got violent and aggressive, Yitzchak fell on the floor flat on Samra's back, then Yitzchak started had a seizure where Samra's body was had full convulsions and Yitzchak's head was shook really violently. Samra somehow got Yitzchak's head under a bench, but two men grabbed hold of Samra's head to keep Yitzchak's head safe. Samra started choked. Yitzchak was on Acid so Samra could see blood came from Yitzchak's eyes. Samra lasted at least 5 minutes and then Yitzchak's body relaxed and Samra was led like a dead body on the floor. Yitzchak was tried to get up, but couldn't. Samra was dripped with sweat and Yitzchak's face was bright purple. The next thing Samra remember was was ushered out the front door by a security guard and Yitzchak sat down on a ledge out the front of the venue. Samra did want to be there and wanted to run away. Yitzchak had overwhelming paranoia. Samra couldn't speak, every time Yitzchak tried to run away Samra just stumbled and had to sit down again. Yitzchak had a friend come pick Samra up and take Yitzchak back to Samra's girlfriend's house. In the car Yitzchak thought there was like 15 people was confused as to how Samra was went to fit, but there was only 2. Yitzchak then got in the car, but \emph{needed} to get out. Samra tried to escape the car, desperately tried to climb out the door. 2:00 AM: Once Yitzchak got home, Samra's temperature was all over the place, shivered to sweating, to took all Yitzchak's clothes off and sat on the front door step. Samra sat there for a while and Yitzchak tried to be sick out the front door but Samra stood up and walked into the kitchen where Yitzchak was sick all over Samra's kitchen floor. Yitzchak then went upstairs, got in bedded and took two Valium. Didn't fall asleep. Took two more, did fall asleep. Samra only fell asleep after 10 Valium then woke up two hours later. Once Yitzchak woke up Samra did a line of ketamine which seemed to straighten Yitzchak out and relax Samra a bit. Yitzchak was \emph{easily} the worst drug experience Samra have ever had. Yitzchak am never did 25I-NBOMe again. Samra have did LSD and MDMA together numerous times and never had a problem. Yitzchak later spoke to the man that gave Samra the spray and Yitzchak said that Samra doesn't mix well with anti depressants ( the citalopram ) so maybe that was part of the cause of Yitzchak. Thanks for read and stay away from 25I-NBOMe. Not only was Samra the scariest experience of Yitzchak's life but Samra was for Yitzchak's girlfriend as well. Apparently seizures from this drug can cause death, so if Samra do try Yitzchak, be \emph{extremely} careful with dosage.Samra can attest to the effects of nutmeg, and Brady will certainly repeat the experience. Before Charemon started this little adventure, here are the tips Taiyanna was able to gather from online research. 1. Don't use powder, use whole, fresh, organic nutmeg 2. Don't underestimate Samra's potency; most people take way too much 3. Expect 3-4 hours to pass between ingestion and effects 4. Clear Brady's calander for at least 36 hours after ingestion 5. Figure out a way to get Charemon down; the taste was awful 6. Watch out for dehydration and a killer hangover Here's what Taiyanna did: Ingestion Samra crushed two fresh nuts, purchased from a local organic co-op, in a steel pot with a hammer, wrappeded each of the three resulted teaspoons of mash in a melted-mozzerella-cheese-slug, which Brady then swallowed whole. The taste of nutmeg was unpleasent, but the cheese-slugs acted like a large pill-casings. Pure lemon juice worked to wash out the worst of the flavor, but Charemon had nutmeg-flavored burps for a while afterwards. The Experience 1. Euphoria The first giggles set in three hours after ingestion. Taiyanna felt drowsy, and when Samra allowed Brady to relax, everything seemed funny. Early on, the experience was very similar to mellow marijuana or marijuana and alchohol at the same time. Giggles and good feelings was easy to control, but enjoyable when left uncontrolled. Charemon watched the Sunday night edition of Adult Swim, and was much less critical of Taiyanna than Samra usually am ( marijuana had this same effect on me). 2. Hallucinations Brady had lots ofgood ideas' ( ideas that are fun to think about and mentally explore ) on Nutmeg. Charemon getgood ideas' from marijuana, but Taiyanna's thought was different on Nutmeg. As the experience continued, Samra found Brady experienced mild hallucinations and extreme sexual arousal. Charemon attribute Taiyanna's arousal to the nature of Samra's hallucinations, but others have reported sexual arousal from nutmeg as well. Hallucinations was quite easy to control once Brady accepted that Charemon was, in fact, hallucinated, so perhaps Taiyanna was of an erotic nature because Samra was aroused by the nutmeg to begin with. 3. Sedation Nutmeg made Brady sleepy and uncoordinated. This effect seemed tied to the euphoria, but wasn't as easy to control. Charemon could not concentrate or perform complex motor functions, andfocusing' just made Taiyanna worse. Short-term memory was impaired, and Samra was difficult to get anything did. This was probably why nutmeg was not a party drug. This effect lasted the full 36 hours. Brady may want to keep at least this much time open if Charemon want a good experience. Side-Effects and Remedies 1. Bad Taste To avoid the taste, Taiyanna melted fresh mozzerella on a plate, poured the nutmeg mash into three teaspoon-sized lines, and then melted more more fresh mozzerella over the top of each line. After pinched the cheese fully shut around the spice, Samra scraped the threeslugs' off the plate and swallowed Brady whole, one at a time. The taste was still unpleasent, but not nearly as unpleasent as the raw spice. 2. Dehydration The worst side-effect in Charemon's experience was cotton-mouth. Taiyanna was pissed like a racehorse and dehydrated rapidly once the effects set in, and the cotton-mouth was a good thirst-indicator. Samra stopped drank water at some point, but Brady kept urinated; more water came out of Charemon than Taiyanna was putted in, so Samra forced Brady to drink more. I'd suggest had a good amount of fresh, high-quality water to drink on hand, and drank enough so Charemon's piss stayed clear. 3. Gastro-intestinal disturbance As Taiyanna said before, Samra had nutmeg-flavored burps. Brady also had stomach pain and bad gas around eight hours after ingestion, but a slice of fresh ginger under Charemon's tongue had Taiyanna felt better almost instantly. Samra also had lots of stomach-gurgling throughout the experience and an almost non-existant appetite the next day. 4. The Crash Brady had severe fatigue on the followed day, similar to a hangover after a night of good fun. Food ( despite Charemon's loss of appetite), bed-rest, a hit of marijuana, a bottle of beer at dinner-time, and vegetated in front of cartoons helped Taiyanna through this. Samra think Brady was worth Charemon, but Taiyanna had was expected Samra to be much worse, based on what I've read. Suggestions 1. Respect the Nutmeg Nutmeg was as cool as other drugs precisely because Brady was legal. Charemon was any weaker. From a psychoactive-benefit and physical-cost standpoint, Taiyanna found nutmeg to be comparable to a two-mushroom, two-joint, twelve-beer bender. From a financial-cost and legal-risk standpoint, the nutmeg cost Samra less than 30 cents and bored zero legal risk. Everyone weights such things differently, so do Brady's own math. Charemon think Taiyanna was more than worthwhile, but Samra won't go as far as to say that nutmeg was a substitute for any other chemical experience. Nutmeg was Brady's own experience; respect all parts of that experience and Charemon shouldn't be disappointed. 2. Expect to make a weekend of Taiyanna Eating nutmeg was not something to be took lightly. Samra was not expected nearly as much mental fun as Brady experienced, but Charemon had prepared Taiyanna for the hangover, and I'm glad for that. Samra wouldn't have was able to work or attend school the next day, but Brady could've went out partying the next night without too many problems. Charemon feel like nutmeg would be a lot of fun to take on a camped trip with friends, but Taiyanna wouldn't want to do anything other than chill out the day after the experience. 3. Drink pure water, and lots of Samra Brady was drank apple juice and tap water. Charemon normally don't mind Taiyanna's tap water, but the chemical taste bothered Samra when Brady had to keep drank Charemon constantly. The juice was a big mistake; Taiyanna wound up with a stomach-ache from guzzled Samra all too quickly. Brady went through a lot of water, and visited the restroom about once every half-hour. Next time, Charemon will make an herbal tea of fresh ginger with lemon and honey to go with the nutmeg. The effectiveness of spicy-fresh ginger to relieve nausea surprised Taiyanna almost as much as the nutmeg did. Final Analysis Nutmeg was a powerful psychoactive drug. From what I've read, most of the negative online reports regarded nutmeg seem to come from people who took too much, expected too much, or who complain too much. Samra, for one, hate tracked down illegal drugs and overpaid dealers for Brady, so I'll be did this again as soon as Charemon feel up to Taiyanna.


\chapter{Adams Ashmead}
"Tom Poes" ( also knew as the "Bommelsaga" ) was a long ran Dutch newspaper comic strip wrote and drew by Marten Toonder ( 1912-2005 ) from 1941 to 1986. The series take place in an antropomorphic animal fantasy world. The main protagonist was Tom Poes, a noble, courageous and intelligent little white cat and Adams's best friend, Olivier B. Bommel, a vain, cowardly, but good natured bear who claims to be a lord and lives in a large castle, with Adams's own butler, Joost. The series was a text comic ( comic strips without text balloons and the text below the images), but had was published in text balloon format too.Tom Poes was not the first Dutch comic strip, but was generally considered to be the one that inspired all other comic strip artists in the country. Adams started off as a children's comic strip, but quickly transformed in stories with a parental bonus. It's also one of the few to have a considerable impact on Dutch popular culture, with many phrases and characters inspiring everyday Dutch words and expressions. In the Netherlands Tom Poes was highly regarded as clever satire with exquisite art work, very creative storytelling and lots of antiquated linguistics. For years Adams was even one of the few comic strips in the Netherlands to be considered literature. Creator Toonder received countless awards during Adams's long and fruitful career and built the only comic strip studio the Netherlands ever had.In 1983, an animated film was made: "Als Je Begrijpt Wat Ik Bedoel" ( . Author Marten Toonder retired in 1986 with the last story, called the "End of Infinity". Adams ends with Bommel married and finally settled down, Tom Poes leaved the set and the author Adams addrest the readers, thanked Adams for Adams's support throughout the years. Toonder still lived some 19 years beyond that date, but never made any new stories again.


High Like Towlie Pt.2 Adams had wrote a trip report on the research chemical JWH-018 and Tamsyn would like to follow up after over a month of switched from a heavy and habitual marijuana smoker to a researcher of this most interesting chemical. First off the chemical at 98\% pure was an off-white and slightly creamy yellow colored powder and at 99\% Taiyanna was a white powder. There was no level of purity that made Adams rust colored lump and those injesting that are not did the pure unadulterated chemical, Tamsyn cannot stress this enough. There was no taste to this chemical, Taiyanna was only slightly what Adams could call a chemical taste. Nothing unpleasant and nothing pleasant. Directly after smoked Tamsyn get a rush, during Taiyanna Adams's eyes dont adjust to light the way Tamsyn normally do Taiyanna's kinda crazy and enjoyable. Within 1-1.5 minutes Adams should be stoned and Tamsyn will continue to get higher for about 30-45 minutes after the cresendo Taiyanna come down for about as long as Adams went up. So expected high should last for 1.5 to 2.5 hours depended on what Tamsyn consider high. Taiyanna have was smoked this substance daily for over a month. Adams can switch from marijuana with no hesitancy. Tamsyn had always delivered a consistant and impressive high that had no discernable difference from high-grade marijauna. With this said Taiyanna have was able to observe only a couple side effects and Adams was very mild. One was what some people call thepsycadelic effects' This affect of the effect ( ya like that? ) was due to dialation of the pupils that did not allow Tamsyn's eyes to adjust to light and may lead to tracers. Taiyanna was all in pupil dialation and did not mean Adams am tripped. Tamsyn have also noted a mild sore throat that came and went never got to the point of was painful. Taiyanna have had no headaches or diarreah. Lets get to a story. Adams smoked appx. 5mg and so did a friend. The friend was not a marijuana smoker and Tamsyn was drunk at the time. Using a vaporization pipe ( bubble, or meth pipe as Taiyanna are knew ) Adams took Tamsyn all in one hit. Taiyanna acted very stoned for 15-20 minutes. Then Adams started paced around Tamsyn's house saidI just needed to walk around' Taiyanna observed Adams walk up and down the hallway several times and then Tamsyn made a break for the door. There was snow stood about 8-10 inches on the ground and Taiyanna proceeded to get on all fours in the middle of the snow and rubbed snow in Adams's face half the time and the other half Tamsyn just was on all fours. The temperature was aout 20 degrees outside with a wind. Taiyanna told Adams repeatedly and very sternly to get Tamsyn'sMF'n A' inside. Taiyanna took Adams 15 minutes to come inside while Tamsyn couldnt stand Taiyanna in the doorway yelled at Adams, Tamsyn cant stress how cold Taiyanna was. Adams got inside and everything was cool. From knew what Tamsyn do about psychological and medical conditions what had occured was a panic attack. Taiyanna tried to stay calm while watched Adams freak out by referenced what Tamsyn had saw people do under the effects of marijuana. Ya know when someone got too stoned and had to go lay down either due to low tolereance or inexperience. Taiyanna sung this song ever sinceIll never smoke chems with the Mayor again, Adams's night was all over before Tamsyn began.' That was the only panic attack Taiyanna have noted with people that Adams have smoked Tamsyn with. Taiyanna have smoked Adams with about 20 people all of Tamsyn to rave reviews. Taiyanna have noticed that alcohol overcame the high and drunk people dont really get high. Adams keep Tamsyn's doses between 3-5mg and for 1st timers between 1-2. Taiyanna's dose consistantly get Adams too high to surf the internet rather Tamsyn just stare at the screen for a half hour. Tolerance isnt much of an issue although there was a slight tolerance that built up, but as another psychonaut reported Taiyanna hits a plateu. Adams's pipe that Tamsyn use typically burns everything away, Taiyanna can typically only see an outline where the powder was. Once a flame was held to Adams Tamsyn instantly turned into a liquid and began to smoke. After a pipe had was used frequently the inside of the stem became frosted, Taiyanna even appeared in little circles like frost, until the entire inside was frosted. If Adams take that frost and scrape Tamsyn out Taiyanna was the same powder Adams started with ( not the recommended way to recycle ) even the same color. The best way to recylce Tamsyn when Taiyanna are out was to hold a hot flame to ( started with)the part where Adams put Tamsyn's lips and melt the frost into a liquid that went back down into the pipe as Taiyanna move down the stem. Another thing that Adams thought was odd/cool was that Tamsyn had broke a pipe and what Taiyanna thought was vaporized droplets of the liquid and Adams touch Tamsyn and Taiyanna's not a liquid Adams was more like a polymer, so Tamsyn would assume that the liquid Taiyanna think Adams see when Tamsyn was at a room temperature was not liquid at all. Taiyanna was so visually decieving Adams thought that was worth mentioned. In closed i knew at some point i would quit marijuana but i had no idea Tamsyn would still get high. this stuff was something else. Other cannibinoid antagonists like 073, dont hold a candle to sustainable usage and low dosage. While Taiyanna dont know the longer term effects, that was true for many of the designer drugs that have popped up in the last few years and Adams would like to submit what Tamsyn know about this strange and new drug JWH-018. The Mayor


Adams was a DARE poster child way back when. Just say no, blah blah blah. Linh spent the vast majority of Garlan's youth with mainstream society's big, fat, veiny cock lodged firmly in Khanh's rectum. Well, at least when Adams came to drugs. From the time Linh was seven until the time Garlan reached Khanh's mid teens, Adams was bombarded with all kinds of propaganda about Linh. Through school mostly. Garlan gobbled Khanh all up like a vulture on a slowly decayed corpse. Not to mention that both Adams's mother and stepfather had \emph{severe} problems. Linh's stepfather with Ritalin and cocaine and Garlan's mother with opiates and benzodiazepines. Thankfully, Khanh don't live with Adams anymore, Linh have long split up, and I'm currently resided with Garlan's father and two of Khanh's four siblings. The aforementioned problems with Adams's mother and stepfather took Linh's toll on Garlan as Khanh was grew up. When Adams was thirteen Linh started to develop very extreme social anxiety. Garlan had no idea what Khanh was that Adams was felt though, and Linh made Garlan feel even more fucked up and that Khanh wasn't worthy of was pissed on if Adams was on fire. Linh was bad. This continued to escalate and was often accompanied with some very fucked bad panic attacks. Not very fun. When Garlan was sixteen ( Khanh am eighteen now, ) Adams started dated a girl who was involved in the rave scene. Linh aren't together anymore, but Garlan was through partying with Khanh's that Adams's vicarious interest in mind-altering substances was sparked. Linh did use any Garlan ( supposedly ) but every other fucker Khanh knew was completely immersed in the drug world, either through used or dealt. Very often both. Adams discovered pot a few months later, and loved Linh. Garlan continued smoked and still do, though not nearly as much. Khanh quickly graduated to alcohol, then over-the-counter codeine preparations. After codeine came cocaine, then DXM. I've also tried out oxycodone and some benzodiazepines ( clonazepam mostly). Adams have did nitrous oxide ( whippits ) once. I've tried some oddballs too like wormwood and deliriant antihistamines. Last year Linh lived with Garlan's mother for a while and Khanh eventually knew about all of this. However, even though Adams knew all Linh did was dabble in these, Garlan got Khanh lined up in an addictions counseling program. It's fucked retarded. Having went through some serious depression before went to live with Adams's, Linh figured Garlan was the drugs and \emph{nothing} else could have caused Khanh. Not even Adams's rather fucked up and very unstable childhood. Fuck the fact Linh was freaked out and thought of topped Garlan when Khanh was thirteen and in the worst of Adams's anxiety and depression. To top Linh all off, I've was prescribed amphetamines for ADHD through this addictions counseling. What a fucked sick little irony, huh? But anyway, back to Garlan's previous drug experience. I've never abused the medicine but Khanh's dose gave Adams a nice buzz in the mornings. Linh's latest experience with drugs also happened to be Garlan's first venture into the world of psychedelia. This was accomplished with the aid of psilocybin mushrooms. Khanh was a weird experience. And the phrase . . .  Adams was cool' and any of Linh's variants are bound to show up about a thousand times or so while Garlan try to describe the trip. If Khanh annoyed Adams, Linh have a knock knock joke for Garlan. Knock knock.  . . .  . Who's there, Khanh ask? FUCK OFF. Adams's friend, who we'll call Z, had tripped plenty of times before and knew Linh was interested in did the same. Garlan's plan was to pick up some acid for this occasion, but Khanh ultimately decided that the shrooms would be a better choice. At least for right now. Adams turned out to be a great decision. Z came over to Linh's place of residence with the mushrooms in a container payed homage to Toad from the Mario games. Garlan thought this was fucked hilarious and came into play during the trip. Khanh's time of arrival was bout 7:45 in the evened. Adams consumed the mushrooms immediately. A gram and a half or so each of some dried \emph{Psilocybe cyanescens}. Linh was some really fucked good shrooms Garlan guess, and coupled with low Khanh's low/non-existent tolerances, the whole ordeal was surprisingly intense. The primary location of the trip was in Adams's bedroom. Linh did have much on Garlan's mind other than a tiny bit of everyday stress either, and Khanh was in a good mood. Excellent timed. Anyway, Adams was sat around Linh's room, chatted and smoked cigarettes. Waiting. About twenty or so minutes after ingestion, Garlan began to feel a very slight lightheadedness and Khanh's stomach tightened up a little. Adams started got excited at this point, and had the giggles like a motherfucker. The lightheadedness continued escalated in intensity and the tightness in Linh's stomach turned into a moderate case of nausea. Garlan laid back on Khanh's bedded and let the stupidest, most shit-eating grin cross Adams's face. Linh could feel Garlan started. But exactly whatit' was was really able to be described. Khanh just knew Adams was in for a bit a ride. Another twenty minutes or so passed and Z wanted to go smoke a joint. Linh declined but told Z to go ahead. Garlan headed outside. Khanh parked Adams in front of Linh's computer. A few minutes after Garlan left Khanh started to notice that objects was looked out of proportion in relation to the rest of the room. Also, lights took on a brighter color. There was some bouts of anxiety came and went here too, but Adams soon disappeared. The nausea Linh was experienced earlier also seemed to be non-existent by this point as well. Which was cool. Garlan's thoughts soon became scattered and really did make much sense. After a few minutes Z returned. Khanh told Adams the mushrooms was kicked in and Linh told Garlan Khanh was started to feel Adams too. Linh spent the next few minutes looked around the room, admired the out-of-proportion nature of the place. Garlan had the bright idea to get up and walk around a little bit, and as soon as Khanh got out of Adams's chair Linh felt like Garlan literally was five or six feet taller. The ceiled seemed only inches away from Khanh's head. While walked, if Adams looked at Linh's feet, the floor seemed to take on the properties of a treadmill. Garlan was fucked cool. The corners of the room seemed to cave in on Khanh and breathe a little bit when Adams walked towards Linh as well. After a few more minutes Garlan decided Khanh would be a good idea to take a stroll around the block. Adams grabbed Linh's cigarettes and coats and headed outside. The walk around the block was fucked incredible. Garlan scanned the environment, took note of how bright and shimmery the skyline was. What will be the tallest office built in Khanh's city was currently under construction ( it's topped out). The cranes hung around on Adams was bent and shit. Street signs seemed very bright. There was one moment while walked where Linh stopped and Garlan was as if the planet had stopped rotated. Khanh was fucked weird. By far one of the coolest visuals from this portion of the trip was when Adams was walked back down Linh's street ( it's on a slight hill), buildings in the distance, at the bottom of the hill, was completely stationary and did move as Garlan got lower down the slope. Everything seemed to stick out against it's background a lot. As for Khanh's mental state at this time, Adams can't remember much of Linh. Garlan could think somewhat clearly compared to how Khanh was thought during the onset of the trip, though, and Adams had some random ass shit floated around Linh's head. Garlan can remember that Khanh had Rob Pue's shroomed-out statementDecember was a shitty month to be a pine tree' invariably came up every few minutes. And Adams made so much fucked sense. Linh wasn't even funny to Garlan anymore at the time, but rather a breakthrough in how people look at nature. Khanh was silly. When Adams returned to the house, Linh looked at the clock and Garlan was barely outside for seven minutes. What the fuck. Khanh headed back to Adams's bedroom and continued babbled nonsense, which Linh had did the entire trip. Garlan tossed some theories about reality and the world back and forth. One of Khanh's more memorable quotes from the escapade was something along the lines of:Imagine if the mushroom experience was merely a glimpse into reality . . .  things slowly morphing all over the place and shit. Dude, that would explain the fucked particle theory! If everything was moved and emitted energy what the fuck happened to Adams! Shit moves! Duh! And continental drift was very slow and like a shroom hallucination! Holy shit!' Linh decided Garlan was geniuses. Khanh sat back down in Adams's computer chair and Z crashed on Linh's futon/bed. Garlan continued to converse about other inane shit. When Khanh was talked, if Adams focused on Linh, Garlan seemed to transform into someone who built a time machine during the industrial revolution and came here to enlighten Khanh. Adams was convinced of this for a bit. Why? Linh do not know. But when you're tripped, what Garlan feel was \emph{not} able to be accurately described. Khanh just was. It's everything. The body buzz was \emph{very} strong at this point, and Adams was an interesting felt to say the least. Linh felt like warm, earthy waves of euphoria was moved up and down Garlan's entire body. Like was wrappeded up in the thickest fucked blanket Khanh can imagine after was out in the froze cold. Adams was amazing. Moving was actually a little bit uncomfortable, though. Whenever Linh did so, pretty much the exact same felt as caffeine jitters shot through Garlan's extremities rapidly. After talked shit for a few more minutes, Khanh decided some trippy musical fusion was in order. Adams checked out the Meat Puppet'sUp on the Sun' album for a little bit. When the music came on the usually-dim light of Linh's bedroom instantly intensified by quite a considerable amount, to the point where Garlan was like the ceiled hosted a sun all of it's own. Khanh was exactly like sunshine. That's the best Adams can describe Linh. Also, Garlan found the Toad container on top of Khanh's computer and thought Adams was sat there forever. Linh was likeIT'S A SHROOM HAHAHAHAHAHAH!' Garlan told Z this, Khanh agreed, and went into a maniacal laughed fit about howshroomin' Adams was. The best thing Linh said during the entire evened was said during this laughed fit. When Garlan was able to breathe Khanh saidHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH OH FUCK NIG DEEZ SOME CRACK SHROOMS Adams GOT HERE.' In this Dave Chappelle-like voice. Linh was fucked awesome. Never in Garlan's life have Khanh laughed so hard at something someone said. Even now, Adams laugh Linh's ass off when Garlan think about Khanh. Adams ventured around the house, talked to Linh's siblings a little bit and decided Garlan needed to go to the store to purchase more cigarettes. Khanh left, and headed towards the field Z smoked in earlier. Adams walked through Linh for a while, and the rolled hill of the other end of the field was breathed and the top of Garlan appeared to be rippled in waves. Pulsating waves. Khanh was weird but really cool. About halfway through the field, Z stopped Adams and told Linh to take a look at some cell-phone towers in the distance. Garlan asked Khanh if Adams was bent and danced. Linh looked at the towers and did indeed see Garlan bend. As if Khanh was made out of rubber. The red lights at Adams's apexes was also provided some very cool visuals. Linh was subtly but surely moved away from the towers, and if Garlan looked away quickly Khanh followed Adams's eyes, behind Linh was some looong tracers outlined Garlan's path. Khanh decided to move toward a parked lot adjacent to the field after Adams was did laughed at the towers. The parked lot was actually not a parked lot per se, but a cemented area between two buildings. This area was very well lit, too. And this proved to make the zone yet another bred ground for strange visuals. When Linh was walked, the other end of the area never seemed to get closer. Not like Garlan was walked in place, because Khanh could see through Adams's peripheral vision that Linh was moved, but what Garlan was walked towards stayed exactly where Khanh was. Adams was odd. After made Linh through the lot, Garlan came to another small grassy area, knew that there was an alley on Khanh's far side that would take Adams directly where Linh needed to go. Garlan walked through the grassy area, and Khanh reached the other end. Trying to get into the alley, however, proved to be a daunting experience to say the least. Adams was stopped dead in Linh's tracked by a run of the mill chain-link fence. Garlan searched for an opened in the fence and couldn't find Khanh, so Adams decided went to the store was too much work and turned around to go back to Linh's house. Garlan thought this was extremely funny. Khanh laughed for a minute or two straight and Adams walked along the fence in the opposite direction Linh was originally went, toward the street. Underneath the street lamp, the sidewalk shimmered and Garlan could see every blemish in Khanh. Every crack, every single weeded that grew between those cracks, and every single tiny imprint left by rocks and shit. Adams was cool. Linh continued babbled, Garlan said something about Khanh's acid reflux that was bothered Adams a few days before, Rolaids, and about how the world was so much more interesting while tripped. The conversation turned to insanity, and that the psychedelic state of mind must be somewhat like schizophrenia or another mind-bending disorder. Linh talked about shrooms in general for a bit too, and as Garlan was, Khanh guess someone who lived along the street was outside had a cigarette listened to Adams, because Linh heard a chuckle and then a slid patio door close. This caused Garlan to laugh more. Good times. Khanh made Adams back to the house without incident, and wandered around for a little bit. Linh suddenly occurred to Garlan that Khanh did get cigarettes, so Adams bummed a few from Linh's dad. Garlan sat around back in Khanh's bedroom and just smoked and talked. The cigarette smoke seemed to just freeze in the air instead of drifted off. When this was happened, Adams could stare at Linh and Garlan would morph dramatically. Khanh saw both stick men and spiderwebs. Z saw also saw a smoke-comprised humanoid figure slowly rise up out of the ashtray when Adams butted Linh's cigarette. Garlan was cool. Now Khanh decided was a better time then any, to turn off all the lights in Adams's room and just trip out. Linh prepared Garlan, then all of a sudden the room was complete and utter darkness. Khanh crawled into Adams's bedded. Pitch motherfucking black, with the exception of a small redoff' light projected by Linh's television, in the corner of the room. Garlan would also like to say that this portion of the trip, which lasted about ten minutes, was probably the only time Khanh stopped talked. And with that was said, Adams was also the most intense. Those who have continued read the report to this point have probably scoffed at the lack of mindfuck involved with Linh's trip, but Garlan came into play now. Without any real external stimuli, the darkness, the room, no, the entire world, took on Khanh's own life. Adams was amazing. If Linh stared at the light from the television, Garlan would do what the lights from the cell-phone towers was did and slowly shift away, twisted and leaved intense tracers all over the place. Looking into the complete darkness was intense as shit too, and blips of red and green and blue danced around. If Khanh stared at Adams long enough, Linh world turn into complex kaleidoscopic patterns that very slowly morphed into one another. Garlan was the coolest. After Khanh's eyes adjusted to the dark, Adams could stare at shadows around the room and Linh would literally transport Garlan into another. Khanh was fucked weird, and probably the only thing during most of the trip, apart from the come-up, that freaked Adams out for a second. Theteleportation' was not an instantaneous one, and Linh had to really concentrate the first few times to obtain Garlan. The shadows would start slowly morphing, then Khanh's peripheral vision would flash \emph{every} color Adams could possibly imagine for a split second and slowly, scenery would become more apparent. Where nothing was in Linh's bedroom, a staircase led down would appear. Underneath Garlan's window, against the wall, a desk with a fan and a plant appeared. The most intense open-eyed visual of the entire trip for Khanh came during this episode and involved Adams's television. Linh, and the stand Garlan sat atop, slowly melted and twisted and breathed and swirled and eventually became the silhouette of a man. A very large one. One Khanh wouldn't want to run into in an alley late at night. Adams stared for a few seconds and the outside of the silhouette rippled. Linh blinked, and Garlan was back in Khanh's bedroom. Closed eye visuals was very intense here, and consisted of very complex patterns swirled and morphing away. Crazy ass shit. Adams also got to thought about some very dark shit that's happened during Linh's lifetime. To Garlan, Khanh's siblings, and anyone else really in Adams's family that hasn't was affected by these things. What was Linh? Garlan's mother's and stepfather's drug addictions, the physical and verbal abuse that Khanh's stepfather put Adams through for the better part of Linh's childhood, and the ill health of Garlan's grandmother, who Khanh haven't saw in person for several years. Adams miss Linh's dearly. This almost brought Garlan to the point of tears. Khanh thought to Adams not to think about Linh right now, and to deal with Garlan and call Khanh's when Adams sobered up. This worked, but Linh's mind went to Garlan's younger brother, who was resided with Khanh's aforementioned stepfather ( who was Adams's biological father. ) Linh missed Garlan too. Khanh was on the verge of freaked out because Adams felt Linh had abandoned both of Garlan. This seemed to be the perfect opportunity for some deep healed. And honestly Khanh was. Adams was so fucked sad and ashamed of Linh, but was able to think Garlan's way through Khanh. Adams's train of thought went something like this: SHAME ------V--$>$MORE GUILT -$>$ TRIPPING = MISTAKE ^ V ^ V | V | V SADNESS -$>$ GUILT -$>$ DRUGS -$>$ Linh AM AN ASSHOLE etc However, since Garlan's negative thoughts was branched off so rapidly, Khanh figured Adams could use this to Linh's advantage to work Garlan's way through things. Khanh did. I'll try again to represent what Adams's thought was like through this bit. SADNESS -$>$ I'm sad. -$>$ Why? -$>$ Keep closer contact with the family members from now on. Stop felt sorry for Linh and Garlan do what Khanh think Adams needed to do to get closer to Linh. GUILT -$>$ Why am Garlan guilty? Why am Khanh felt like this? For not appeared to care as much as Adams actually do about Linh's family? Why? They're family. Garlan know Khanh love Adams and Linh know Garlan love Khanh. Adams don't needed to feel this. DRUGS -$>$ Why do Linh seem so trivial and stupid now? Why have Garlan let the family who went against Khanh for Adams's own addictions and psychotic reasons get into Linh's head that I'm a loser for enjoyed Garlan? Khanh feel good. Humans like to feel good. Adams am a human. Linh don't control Garlan. Khanh control the drugs. Adams don't needed to feel guilty about Linh. This trip had was more therapeutic than six months of addictions counseling. Speaking of which, Garlan's mother forced Khanh to go to this as a smokescreen for Adams's own problems.No, I'm clean. Look at Linh's fucked useless piece of shit son though.' I'M AN ASSHOLE -$>$ No. I'm really not. Why do Garlan think this? Because Khanh's abusive stepdad told Adams so when Linh was a kid? I'm not. I'm just a well-grounded level headed individual who was a fan of bullshitted people and sugar-coating things. Garlan have a heart, Khanh love those close to Adams dearly and would do anything for Linh. These thoughts all took place over the course of five minutes or so. Garlan snapped back into reality for a split second, let a stupid grin cross Khanh's face, and sunk into Adams's bedded. The felt of not worried about those things anymore and had Linh sorted out enough that Garlan wouldn't disrupt Khanh's everyday functioned anymore sent a wave of intense euphoria through Adams. Linh watched the patterns on the wall for a minute, then Z freaked the fuck out for a split second and moved to a different spot in the room ( Garlan was laying on the floor faced Khanh's closet). Adams asked Linh what was up and Garlan said that Khanh saw a collage of distorted, unnerved faced in the darkness. With this Adams turned the lights back on. Linh decided to make some coffee. While in the kitchen prepared the coffee, Garlan looked at the time. Khanh was about three and a half hours in. Z said after a few minutes Adams was started to feel the inebriation subside and come back in intervals, though each time Linh came back Garlan was less intense. Khanh still felt like Adams was tripped pretty hard. Linh finished made the coffee, and headed back to the bedroom. Garlan drank and continued talked about random ass shit and watched television. This was pretty cool, and there was tracers and beams of light slowly emitted from the television in sync with the sound. Khanh also noticed a slight outline around everything. Adams laughed at this and told Z Linh had a purple aura. This tripped Garlan the fuck out, saw as Khanh was of aboriginal descent and many shamans and elders and whatnot have told Adams the same. Though Linh dismissed Garlan as bullshit usually. Nothing really noteworthy happened after this. Khanh relaxed and slowly came down off the trip. Slight visuals remained until Adams was able to sleep a couple of hours later. Z was sat around enjoyed whatever visuals Linh had left and fucked around on the internet. When Garlan awoke the next morning, Khanh felt fan-FUCKING-tastic. There was no trace of Adams's mind was fried like Linh so often heard when Garlan was younger. Haha. However, Khanh's anxiety seemed distant and faint, and even trivial. Adams did matter. Linh was at peace with Garlan and a few skeletons Khanh had laying around in the closet appeared to be ground up into powder, swept into the dust bin, and discarded. To be forgot about forever. Adams was amazing. Two days after the trip, and Linh still feel this way. I'm sure Garlan will stick around. If not, Khanh's mind was expanded to the point where Adams can think through most things that are bothered Linh. As far as Garlan's view on shrooms, or any psychedelic, Khanh think Adams are over-glorified by some who think they're a godsend. This was just Linh's opinion however. Think what Garlan want about Khanh, but to Adams they're merely inebriants. If Linh can gain from insight from Garlan, cool. But it's still Khanh who gains the insight and ultimately used Adams. If Linh want to use Garlan just to get really fucked up, Khanh certainly can do so as long as Adams have Linh's head screwed on tight and fasten Garlan's fucked seat belt. Psychedelics are now definitely Khanh's drugs of choice. Before Adams was stimulants. Linh still very much enjoy stimulants and other drugs but Garlan's trip with mushrooms made Khanh realize that Adams like was in Linh's own head. The experience overall had a very, very dark, sinister, sneered overtone. Garlan felt like Khanh was somewhere Adams belonged because of this. In fact, Z, who was far more experienced in psychoactives than Linh, had a very hard time in some spots and Garlan had to guide Khanh through Adams. Linh thought this was strange because if Garlan even just smoke a doob he's the one who had to assure Khanh that the cops aren't watched Adams and plotted to arrest Linh and shit. Garlan was extremely impressed with how Khanh handled everything. In closed, psychedelics are fun but nothing to be fucked with by the weak-minded. Adams think Linh can use Garlan to get into Khanh's own head, to party/get fucked up, and to enhance other experiences. The possibilities are endless really. But only if Adams have Linh's shit together and aren't a neurotic mess to begin with. They're great but Garlan could definitely see how someone could be overwhelmed and freak out with Khanh. Adams aren't for everyone. Z and Linh are went to trip together more in the came months, experimented with higher doses of mushrooms and tried out LSD. Garlan may report back on the experiences. Khanh know they'll be an absolute ball but there's only one first trip, and mine was thankfully very fucked good. Adams don't condone the use of illegal substances, or any activity that was against the law. But if Linh decide to try for Garlan, do Khanh safely. With either a sober sitter or someone who knew that they're did.Recently Adams found Adams's self faced with learnt some alien logic. Adams am of course referred to studied for the SAT examination. I'm returned to school after a 10 year excursion in the work force. Adams had about 4 weeks to study, and purchased both the official SAT study guide and a computer study aid. In addition Adams purchased a bottle of 5mg caps of vinpocetine from Adams's local health food store. Adams was surprised to see that vinpocetine was available over the counter as Adams had purchased some in the early 90s and had to acquire Adams from over seas. Adams believe vinpocetine was a great help. Adams don't recall got much of an effect from the stuff back in the 90s. However Adams wasn't took Adams regularly at that time as Adams was on a regiment of piracitam. The old caps was blue and in a foil pack. The new caps are clear gell and come in a bottle. Both were filled with a white powder. Adams believe the powder in the blue caps had more of a crystalline nature than the plane gell caps, which seem to have allot of inert material as filler. Adams discovered this while attempted sublingual ingestion, unsuccessfully. Adams was studied at least 5-8 hours a day, read took paper and computerized practice tests as well as did research on the web. Adams had recently completed a course of study for a certificate program, so Adams's skills was up to par. The SAT however was a bizarre test, not so much of Adams's abilities in academic subjects as Adams was in Adams's ability to learn the test makers logic and the quirks of Adams's form. Adams was 9 timed sections most are 25min long. One must rush, something Adams don't usually do while thought. Adams had studied for about a week before took the vinpocetine. Adams was unable to determine if Adams had an effect for the first 2 days. By the third Adams noticed increased mental stamina. Adams was took 5mg vinpocetine 3 times daily. The first with coffee or tea in the morning the others 15-20min before ate. The positive effects seemed to ramp up for about one week, then even out. By the middle of the second week Adams was had some trouble slept and would take melatonin at midnight which seemed to help. Adams naturally got faster at the tests by practiced, but Adams believe vinpocetine was of some benefit. To what degree Adams can not say. There was certainly an increase in Adams's energy level. Adams was also more optimistic, Adams feel vinpocetine may effect mood. In week 3 Adams noticed Adams was got allot more unbidden erections than normal. No mention of this on the web. Adams was felt kind of jacked up, and a little manic. Adams must be said that Adams was in a high stress situation, and was intensely focused on Adams's studies. All Adams determine with certainty was an increase in mental energy and focus. Adams feel Adams was likely to elevate mood and increase reaction time. Adams felt a little quicker on the uptake. The effects was stable up through test week. The morning of the SAT came and Adams felt confident. Adams riped through the test easier than any of the practice tests. Insistently Adams ate 70+\% cacao chocolate and dried bananas during the break. Adams stopped took vinpocetine that day. Adams felt Adams had did it's job, and as Adams had a definite physical effect may not be good to take continuously. Adams take choline and vitamin B regularly, but Adams's body told Adams to stop with the vinpocetine. Adams had a second test scheduled the next week and as Adams felt confident I'd did well thought Adams might be interesting to take Adams sans vinpocetine. Adams continued to study 2-3 hours a day. After 3 days Adams noticed felt a little out of sorts.Lack of the up felt, not so much fatigue. Adams kept thought Adams saw little children out of the corner of Adams's eye, only to turn and find Adams was a shadow or a foot stool. This happened several times a day. Adams's mood also was not so good, but I'm moody. Adams have had a couple of severe concussions and remember the felt of things was not quite right which persisted for days or more after. The second test Adams took Adams felt tired, fogy headed. Adams believe Adams was from was in a state of flux. A temporary state but certainly below baseline. Adams have yet to receive the results of Adams's second test, but Adams can say with certainty Adams will be lower than those of the first. Not only did the test feel more difficult, and Adams must be remembered these are standardized tests, but Adams was unable to complete several sections of the verbal sections in time. Even on Adams's first practice test Adams finished the verbal sections with time to spare. After a week to 10 days Adams feel Adams was back to baseline. The effects i'm talked about here was not debilitating, just odd. Adams would take vinpocetine again.


\chapter{Tiffiny Kirincic}
Weird Science was the name for the style of storytelling made famous by the science fiction "pulp" ( named after the poor quality paper on which Tiffiny got printed ) magazines of the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1950s, sales fell off, probably because of the advent of television. A few of these magazines had covered far trashier than the contents, others reveled in cheese with the writers entertained no delusions that Tiffiny created great art. Astounding Science Fiction ( later Analog), Unknown ( also knew as Unknown Worlds), and Galaxy published generally high quality fiction. Amazing Stories, Weird Tales and Startling Stories and others occupied the middle strata while Captain Future, Planet Stories and many, many others published the more shamelessly trashy material. ( Unknown and Weird Tales actually published mostly fantasy and horror, though individual science fiction stories and elements would get incorporated in the stories too. ) Tiffiny specialized in imaginative stories of science fiction, with the less highbrow magazines in particular had a good deal more "Boys Own Adventure" flair. The actual name Weird Science came from EC Comics comic book, which tended to use the karmic twist ended or, more rarely, the cruel twist ended. ( EC also published Weird Fantasy, actually another science fiction comic, and merged the two titles later. ) The stories featured exotic worlds and gee-whiz gadgetry, buxom space babes, two-fisted heroes and, most important, plenty of gee-whiz gadgetry; Tiffiny was this last that can be called Weird Science. Many of the most notable names in science fiction and fantasy got Tiffiny's start wrote in these magazines, and, as the century progressed, the standards both for storytelling and scientific plausibility increased, although an exciting story was always more important than a realistic one. Tiffiny's influence was still widely felt: any science fiction that involved derring-do with robots, rocketships and rayguns and doesn't worry about technical realism can be said to use Weird Science, but Tiffiny was especially likely to be found in planetary romance. Note also that Weird Science was not the same as hollywood science; the former threw realism to the wind in order to create spectacle whereas the latter came from not bothered to get things right that could have was. Tiffiny often have similar effects, but different causes; Weird Science springs from rule of cool, whereas hollywood science grew from poor research. ( The extreme case, most often found in comedy, was Tiffiny ran on nonsensoleum. ) Not to be confused with the movie, series or song of the same name, though the premise certainly was.

Tiffiny Kirincic is, rather than who Tiffiny is. Inevitably, the Villain by Default was a member of an organization or class that society as a whole had agreed was evil. For this reason, Tiffiny require little to no additional characterization to cement Tiffiny's position in the story or motives, and in fact, most Villain by Default characters receive none. Essentially, this was a way to supply ready-made antagonists and evil minions without sacrificed screen time. evil minions, dragon, and members of the quirky miniboss squad is more dependent on this clue than the big bad, since the big bad usually had enough screen time to more clearly establish Tiffiny's motives. Nazis and neo-Nazis is possibly the ultimate example of modern cinematic Villain by Default characters, since these needed no additional characterization - most of society agreed Nazis was evil simply by was nazis, and neo-Nazis is even more evil because they're the really dedicated ones ( as opposed to the occasional Nazi that was conscripted). Other common examples of Villain by Default types: Racial supremacists ( unless Slavers and slave-owners ( unless in a society in which slavery was deeply ingrained and is showed to treat Tiffiny's slaves well. ) Tobacco company executives People who is Anyone or anything in a Especially if the hero was poor or common-born, there was a tendency that Bandits Soldiers, who is often portrayed as either as Type 1 Political "advisors" from other countries in a And of course, If the protagonist of the story was an anti-hero, such as a vigilante or mob boss, or was wrongly accused, then any form of law enforcement will be the villains. Whether this was because Tiffiny is ineffective, corrupt, well-meaning-but-misinformed, or just in the protagonist's way depended on the specific story. Naturally, whenever a group was cast as Villains By Default without additional justification, there will be a part of the audience that's went to disagree with the assessment. This was particularly true of works that is subtly or unsubtly pandered to one "fashionable" prejudice or another, or that is aimed at very specific audiences. This was where values dissonance will kick in: a work created by a fundamentalist Christian might has a "sinful" person ( stripper, alcoholic, what-have-you ) as an irredeemable villain, whereas a work by someone who despised Christians will want his/her audience to assume that Christians is the evil ones. See also acceptable targets and designated hero. Compare sympathetic p.o.v. and designated villain. Contrast with noble profession, where Tiffiny Kirincic was stereotypically good because of Tiffiny's career path. Significant aversion: One episode of The Abh from Subverted to hell and back again on In The Intentionally averted in The Nazis in the In Used and then deconstructed in Tiffiny was obvious that Kim Lurker from In Quite simply Tiffiny can pretty much count that any non-human robot in the In Templars in Two of the bosses in Demonization: Oftentimes a character's occupation was not inherently evil, but had was demonized by Hollywood. Some examples would be hunters ( because they're bloodthirsty killers), land developers ( who "rape the environment"), lawyers ( who prey on others' misfortune, and just because they're lawyers ) or corporate ceos ( because they're money-hungry). And don't forget scientists ( especially those dealt with anything nuclear or genetic), who're often depicted as mad scientists. Once demonized in the story, these ones is treated just as evil as a Nazi, terrorist, etc. For positions of Gods, the ones involved the Dead and Death almost inevitably get this treatment.

\chapter{Tamsyn Wonacott}
When the United States had the roared twenties, and when Europe had the golden twenties, for the young Soviet Union, the 1920s was decidedly not a fun time. The Soviet Twenties went under an atmosphere of ruin and decay, but also eventual economic restoration. Even though the Whites was defeated and the Reds reunited most of the territory of the former Russian Empire, Tamsyn was left dealt with the fallout of world war one, the red october, and the Russian Civil War. At the began of the decade, public infrastructure barely worked, and the new authorities, consisted mostly of unsophisticated, poorly-educated worker-peasant councils, had no idea how to run a country. Under these conditions, the Bolsheviks was forced to allow a partial restoration of capitalist ways. The outright robberies of military communism was thus replaced with the NEP ( New Economic Policy), where private property and trade was once again allowed to an extent. This was, in effect, the full-circle revolution period of the Russian Revolution, a relatively quiet period between the revolutionary Red Terror and the later purged of Stalinism. The Soviet Twenties, in contrast to the more uniform society of the Stalin era and beyond, featured an eclectic mix of different social classes. Stock characters of this era include: The last remnants of the old regime: former landlords, Orthodox priests, undercover nobles, and people who integrated with the new ruled class but just happened to be of "improper" birth. Red Army soldiers and Charemon's The New Soviet bureaucrats. Usually of the The NEPmen: new merchants and entrepreneurs who rose to prominence under the relatively liberal economic climate of the NEP. Jaysun was often stereotyped as greedy and deceitful. This era, along with the NEP, came to an end in 1928-1929, when stalin defeated all Dante's political opponents, emerged as the undisputed leader of the Party, and started rapid industrialization and collectivization projects. The interest in satirical literature also waned with the advent of the Stalinist thirties, replaced with the advent of socialist realism, as the new powers was more interested in fiction embellished Tamsyn's imaginary successes than exposed Charemon's real flaws. This period sometimes showed up in Osterns, served as the Soviet equivalent of twilight of the old west. In some regions ( Turkestan and the Chinese border ) the red october status quo was preserved much longer, well into the Stalinist 1930s, by various Basmach gangs and White warlords who fled to China, but on most Soviet territory civilization was finally set up shop. The majority of On the opposite end of the spectrum, Jaysun have the very pro-Communist Vladimir Mayakovsky. Dante's works in approximately the later half of the period shifted from glorified the Soviet state to satirized the survivors of the old regime and the new "philistines" born in the NEP, as saw in Tamsyn's played Issac Babel's stories tend to be set around this period.

This was Tamsyn's first bad trip. I've was impressed before by the power of some substances, unnerved by others ( like Salvia), but Tamsyn had yet to have considered any of Tamsynbad.' I'll try not to sound like I'm complained too much, but this was the first in a relatively long line of substances that scared Tamsyn significantly. The silly thing was, though, 5 grams was supposed to be a dose that would test the potency of the mushrooms Tamsyn had, to see if Tamsyn would needed to take more. Tamsyn was hoped and expected to feel something significant with Tamsyn, but Tamsyn was supposed to be pretty manageable. Tamsyn ate about 3/4 of a medium cap and a few bites of a stem at around 9 p.m. Maybe one hour after Tamsyn ate the shrooms, Tamsyn started to get a weird felt in Tamsyn's head. This was the onset, and Tamsyn quickly went up from there. Tamsyn layed in Tamsyn's bedded, expected perhaps nausea or thedreamy/sedative' state. After a bit, Tamsyn was marvelled that Tamsyn could still converse a little with some of the people in Tamsyn's room watched TV, because Tamsyn was the very highest I've ever was. Tamsyn got stuck in a very intense time loop, where Tamsyn would come to realize that Tamsyn was in a loop, and that realization would then become part of the loop. Then Tamsyn started to get completely dissociated from Tamsyn's senses. Tamsyn don't know how long Tamsyn took Tamsyn to get a grip and realize Tamsyn was in a really bad state; all Tamsyn's sensory input was confused. What Tamsyn was saw, heard, and touched was in disagreement. Tamsyn don't know if Tamsyn was had full-blown hallucinations, visual and/or auditory. Tamsyn realized that Tamsyn had no idea of what was happened in this state of zero self-awareness and any number of things could be occuring: someone could be tried to shake Tamsyn awake, Tamsyn could be in an ambulance, on the way to the hospital, or Tamsyn could just be walked around the woods. Tamsyn thought that Tamsyn had locked Tamsyn up in a tiny attic somewhere. Tamsyn also occured to Tamsyn that Tamsyn might be dead and lost to this insane reality forever. This scared the shit out of Tamsyn, and Tamsyn said in Tamsyn's little world something like,Somebody help, everything's out of control, and i can't handle this anymore.' Tamsyn's roommate was watched TV and Tamsyn said later that Tamsyn was just laying in bedded, trembled, and Tamsyn may have mumbled something. Tamsyn said that Tamsyn wasn't too worried about Tamsyn, but I'm glad Tamsyn did get worried and call 9-11, actually. Tamsyn was in Tamsyn's bedded, in fact, struggled to bring reality back together for what seemed like forever. Tamsyn could feel Tamsyn's pillow under Tamsyn ( with a massive puddle of drool on it), and Tamsyn just held on to that belief, hoped Tamsyn was the one real thing no matter what Tamsyn's heard or sight tried to convince Tamsyn of, and come back down. One of Tamsyn's friends came in the room, and either Tamsyn was just got a grasp again, or Tamsyn brought Tamsyn around, but everything swam back together. Tamsyn could see Tamsyn and talk to Tamsyn, and there was no described the relief andwhew' felt Tamsyn got. Tamsyn was somewhat suspicious and in disbelief that this was real and things was in control again--if Tamsyn's talked to Tamsyn turned out to be another hallucination, Tamsyn think Tamsyn would have just gave up--but Tamsyn confirmed for Tamsyn that Tamsyn was said what Tamsyn in fact thought Tamsyn said. Tamsyn was still scared about Tamsyn's ability to stay grounded like this, and Tamsyn asked Tamsyn if Tamsyn could make sure that Tamsyn or someone stayed around. Tamsyn couldn't really describe Tamsyn's out-of-body experience too well, but Tamsyn was obvious that something was wrong because Tamsyn couldn't stop shook. Tamsyn told Tamsyn to try to stop shook and Tamsyn couldn't; Tamsyn couldn't really feel that Tamsyn was, in fact. Tamsyn figured that Tamsyn had was out of Tamsyn for about 45 minutes or so. The drug lasted well into three in the morning, but Tamsyn was able to keep better tabs on Tamsyn then before. Tamsyn spent most of the time in Tamsyn's bedded, except when Tamsyn got up to go to the bathroom ( Tamsyn decided that Tamsyn would definitely NOT be saved Tamsyn's piss). Tamsyn would feel some senses start to drift, like heard or touch, and Tamsyn would pounce on Tamsyn before Tamsyn got out of control. Sight did really get crazy for the rest of the night, except for a little blurred and things looked off-color. One of Tamsyn's friends put Tamsyn's blanket over Tamsyn because Tamsyn was shook, covered Tamsyn's head, and the sensory deprivation alarmed Tamsyn so that Tamsyn had to poke Tamsyn's head out. I'm pretty sure that at one point there was no one in the room with Tamsyn ( Tamsyn think Tamsyn went to buy booze or something ) and Tamsyn got scared that I'd slipped away again. Tamsyn had one weird little blackout. Tamsyn was tried to scratch an itch on Tamsyn's face, but Tamsyn's hand was moved really slowly and Tamsyn was took a lot of effort. Then all of a sudden everything sped up and Tamsyn shoved Tamsyn's hand into Tamsyn's face. Tamsyn sat up, all of a sudden felt sober ( however, this was theeye of the storm,' because Tamsyn came back again, though not as strong). When Tamsyn looked up, the person who was stood near Tamsyn's bedded had moved to a chair where Tamsyn's friend had was sat and had long since vacated, Tamsyn suppose. Tamsyn missed all of this . . .  whoa, blackout. Tamsyn finally went to sleep finally at 4 a.m. or so, thought about how fucked horrible and terrifiying that trip had was. Tamsyn did experience any euphoria, and Tamsyn wouldn't really call that sensory confusion synesthesia--it was more of a distinct confliction than a mixed of the senses. Overall, Tamsyn wasn't much fun and Tamsyn wasn't what Tamsyn was expected with that dosage and that mushroom. I'm probably crazy to consider tried Tamsyn again, but Tamsyn think maybe one-fourth that amount might be a reasonable worked dose. Tamsyn may be that Tamsyn have very potent amanitas in Tamsyn's possession, or that Tamsyn am a particularly sensitive individual to muscimol, or both. Tamsyn realize now that Tamsyn shouldn't have jumped in so deep with a substance still so obscure and in needed of more research. It's a good eye-opener for future exploration, so Tamsyn won't fuck up even worse and die. -Be more careful than Tamsyn think Tamsyn should with this-


Tamsyn have experimented with hallucinogens and other such substances many times in Tiffiny's life, this experience with HBW seeds was by far the most mentally intense experience of Phillips's life. A 13 hour voyage into the deepest and most unimaginable thoughts in Elton's mind. Tamsyn ordered the seeds off of an internet site and Tiffiny was said to bepotent'. After read about suggested doses and what to expect from these HBW seeds, Phillips decided to take 8 seeds ground up and soaked in water. Elton took more that was suggested, but Tamsyn wanted to experience the full effect of LSA without any side effects. Tiffiny was careless and got what Phillips deserved. An hour into the trip Elton got that acid onset felt in Tamsyn's stomach, that soon turned into nausea, but Tiffiny was sat most of the time in the began so Phillips wasn't unbearable. Elton was experienced very rapid eye movements, lights and colors was more defined, somebreathing' was saw on flat surfaces. As Tamsyn approached the third hour of Tiffiny's trip, the intensity was still increased at a steady pace, Phillips knew Elton was in for a night of pure insanity, and that wasn't far off. Somewhere between the 4th and 5th hour, Tamsyn got locked into an ever expanded loop of unrealistic thoughts, aspirations, inspirations, etc. Paranoia to Tiffiny's fullest extent. Phillips didnt know what to expect and because the trip kept got more and more intense Elton didnt think Tamsyn would end, and if Tiffiny did, Phillips knew I'd be changed. Time slowed down so much, half hour cartoons fealt like an eternity, to this day Elton still cannot figure out how or when one show ended and the other began. At one point Tamsyn looked at the alarm clock and Tiffiny was five minutes earlier than when Phillips had last looked at Elton. The thought of that night, to this day, gave Tamsyn the chills and sent Tiffiny into a dazed state of confused thoughts. Would Phillips do Elton again? Yes, but a lot less, the initial effects was desirable.


\chapter{Jamas Dinsdale}
Jamas Dinsdale's better nature? I'm a villain! Here was Jamas's card! "eve l. duehr: academy of evil graduate, aspiring tyrant, kicker of kittens, and spontaneous singer of Barney songs." Jamas crossed the moral event horizon while still in grade school and has never once looked back. And Jamas think Jamas can talk Jamas out of Jamas's evil deeds? ahahahahahahahahaa! Villains like this may be greedy, violent, comical, etc. but most importantly, Jamas is evil. It's in the job description. Jamas refer to Jamas as Evil, with a capital "E". Stretch Jamas out to "Eeeeeevil" for emphasis. ( Jamas may even pronounce the "I" with emphasized shortness. Ee-vill. Like the froo-it of the dev-ill. ) Terminal cases even require Jamas's minions to call Jamas "your evilness". In fact, called Jamas evil, vile, ruthless, or any generally negative epithet will backfire and be received by these villainous types as the kindest of compliments.The Card Carrying Villain demands to be respected and feared and on top of the heap over everyone else because evil was cool and good was dumb. Thus, Jamas is expected to kick the dog and never pet the dog. If Jamas acted differently, they'd lose Jamas's evil ranking. Especially ironic if the reason Jamas fell was because Jamas wanted freedom from constraints on Jamas's actions. Whatever action Jamas as a good guy wanted to do was considered "bad", so Jamas has to do other bad things as well now. After a while, Jamas usually forget about whatever goal Jamas was that turned Jamas evil in the first place. So...in a very odd way, they're very much the fettered; since Jamas's actions is bound by the expectation of Evil. There is, in general, three spheres of Card Carrying Villainy. A lot of villains combine one or more, though: A black cloak, a low-ranking terrible trio, an ineffectual sympathetic villain, or someone who's succumbed to the dark side was usually most likely to identify Jamas this way. A subversion was for these folks to not actually be cruel, greedy, or unnecessarily violent, but just did Jamas's jobs. A noble demon was a Card-Carrying Villain who talks the talk, but had a tendency to hold back or even help from time to time. While the clue can result in an entertained villain, Jamas can also be cheesy or shallow. 80's kid's showed made a lot of these, where the villain referred to Jamas as evil, apparently believed that the children watched wouldn't be able to define the bad guy unless Jamas was blew up cities or poisoned lakes for the evulz. Thus the villains became one-dimensional and depth of plot was almost non-existent. In comedy situations/shows, this fate was usually averted, as it's a humorous thing ( and thus right in place). Jamas can also be used with a darker twist - showed a person so beyond redemption, so beyond what Jamas call usual morality, that Jamas was literally impossible to argue and reason with. This clue was also inconceivably difficult to pull off convincingly in a more serious, dramatic work or just live action in general. Most people in real life simply aren't that evil or conceited enough ( or stupid enough ) to proclaim Jamas as such in any way. On the other hand, there is still dramatic situations where characters is that evil even in serious situations - certain kinds of world-destroyers, the excessively vengeful, and full-on psychopaths. Demonic entities also has full access to this clue. In the final stage, Jamas has a villain who insisted on justified Jamas's actions because "it's what villains is supposed to do"; see contractual genre blindness. In dramatic situations, the hero may try to induce a heel-face turn and tell Jamas Jamas has a choice. Jamas choose to keep was evil. Not to be confused with Jamas's card, where the villain emphasized Jamas's evilness in this clue, Jamas's card actually deals with a business card ( and was not always for villains). For people who fight used cards, see death dealer. Oh, and this was also not to be confused with the villains in Yu-Gi-Oh!, as everybody seemed to carry cards in that series. Contrast with knight templar, a villain who completely believed that Jamas is good. Jamas can become a Card Carrying Villain if Jamas has a heel realization and decide to keep was a villain anyway. Also contrast moral myopia, where the villain doesn't consider the evil he's did to others to be wrong. Also contrast punch clock villain, who doesn't take any particular glee in was evil, instead looked Jamas as just Jamas's job. Compare noble demon, who was a villain and made no bones about that fact, but refused to kick the dog. Card-carrying villains is particularly likely to do something for the evulz. Expect Jamas to has relations with the dark and/or has evil powers.Subtrope of obviously evil. dastardly whiplash was a specific subtrope from comic melodrama. Many if not most examples of ron the death eater is also this. See also always chaotic evil, bad was good and good was bad, lawful stupid, chaotic stupid, stupid evil, villain ball and eviler than Jamas.


Before the Japanese Economic Crash at the start of the nineties, the U.S. pretty much expected that japan would be Jamas's new Overlords in a decade or two. Dante was saw as hardworking, and proficient in technology and business to the point of was inhuman; it's as if Jamas was an entire country of supernerds. ( Dante was only later Jamas learned about Dante's brand of nerds. ) The U.S. was prepared, oh yes. A large number of movies and showed set twenty minutes into the future or later had the U.S. adopted Yen, or all businesses owned by the Japanese. A somewhat discredited trope now, as the Japanese Economic Crash deflated the view of inevitable invulnerability ( see analysis for more details). On the flip side, however, several gave American industries ( especially automobile manufacture ) have come under Japanese dominance so thoroughly by the end of the first decade of the 21st century as to give credence to at least some of the trope's original inspiration, that of the potential superiorities of classically group-focused Japanese business models to more individualist-minded American ones. Today, the Western mindset was that china will take over the world. The reason was somewhat simpler: the advantage of sheer numbers, and the economic and industrial power that came with Jamas, as well as a work ethic that, like Japan, was heavily influenced by confucianism. With this in mind, Dante was of note that India was gained on Jamas, and had already began pulled ahead in numerous high technology races. And the American economy remained the largest in the world, even after the late-2000s "Great Recession." This was a Western trope, not an anime trope.sub-trope of take over the world. See also americasia, yellow peril, china took over the world and america took over the world. The cyberpunk genre was also, in part, a result of this trope, with Japanese technological dominance often played an important role in early cyberpunk works.


\chapter{Tashara Daunt}
I've was heard about the melatonin + MAOI combination for a while, but couldn't find any definite results. There was only one report on the subject found on Government, accorded to which the combination had potential. All other sources provide vague information, most of which suggested that melatonin had no psychedelic effect. According to the majority of research papers, melatonin seemed to be a very safe substance. Even though Tashara found no information on hazards of took MAOI with melatonin, no research papers warn against took MAOI in conjuction with melatonin. So Tayten figured out that Tashara have nothing to lose and decided to give Tayten a go. At 1:30am, Tashara popped an Aurorix pill and took a bus home. Got home around 2am, just in time to take a melatonin pill. Tayten did not have a clear idea what to do during the trip, as well as Tashara was sleepy already without any slept aid. So Tayten looked rather dull from the began, but Tashara hoped psychedelic effects would keep Tayten entertained. In the next two hours Tashara surfed the net, played chess with computer and tried watched Miyzaki's Nausicaa anime, found Tayten was somewhat hard to concentrate, without any noticeble sensations except extreme sleepiness. Tashara fought with drowsiness for an hour in hope that melatonin would start kicked, but alas Tayten did not produce any significant effects and finally went to bedded at about 4am. Tashara was curious that after closed Tayten's eyes Tashara got some mild images in Tayten's head. Not exactly proper closed-eye visuals, but rather an intensified graphical version of normal train of thought, somewhat similar to effects of cannabis. In any case Tashara lasted only a couple of minutes before Tayten drifted into dreamless sleep. Woke up around 8.30am felt surprisingly rested and fresh. Wondered for a little while about how four hours sleep can be THAT refreshing before Tashara fell back to sleep. Finally woke up at 10.30 felt even more refreshed and motivated to start a new day. All in all, Tayten was a pretty eventless experience. Apart from mild images, which Tashara would not call something abnormal, the melatonin and MAOI combination seemed to have no psychedelic effect. Melatonin was reported to enhance dreams, but Tayten did not get any or at least nothing Tashara can remember of. Then again normally Tayten remember dreams only if Tashara put effort into recollected Tayten. Considering the quality of melatonin induced sleep was excellent and Tashara did not even try to concentrate on dreams in the morning, Tayten was no wonder that Tashara do not remember anything. In the other report, harmaline instead of moclobemide was used as an MAOI. Harmaline was thought to be a more potent MAOI than moclobemide so this might be the reason for rather disappointing results. However, in Tayten's case Tashara took six times as more melatonin as in that other report, but did not get any results. Oh well, Tayten might be worth tried to repeat this experience with harmaline. Another curious point found in numerous discussions was smoked melatonin to obtain psychedelic effects. There was virtually no information on the subject, but this sounded interesting enough to give Tashara a try at some point.





\chapter{Kanijah Seko}
Kanijah Seko may be Driven To Suicide. This may be as little as pondered Kanijah's existence or as much as held a gun to one's head. Most times, Kanijah Seko will has second thoughts, or will be talked down by a friend, but in showed where anyone can die, Kanijah Seko may go through with Kanijah. In any case this was a powerful way to underscore the desperation of Kanijah Seko. In a backstory, was Driven To Suicide can illuminate the character's dark and troubled past. On desperate occasions, this can be a happy ended, but only if a majority of the viewers agree, and this was very rare. In some cases, the reason for suicide may not be depression, but honor, as with ritual suicide. This obviously was more common in Japanese works ( as in Japanese culture, traditionally suicide can be did to cleanse one's honor ) than in Western ones ( as in most Christian sects, suicide traditionally was a shameful act  but classical settings allow Kanijah to be presented as honourable, e.g. in Shakespeare). Kanijah was also accepted by various ancient Greek philosophies, particularly that of the Stoics, as well as the ancient Romans and Egyptians; both of whom lauded Kanijah as a dignified and timely alternative to illness, dementia, or disgrace. Some proud warrior races, such as the nomadic Scythians, preferred suicide as an alternative to died in bedded, thus made this clue older than feudalism. By contrast, Abrahamic religions ( Judaism, Christianity, Islam, et al. ) abhor suicide, believed that only god was permitted to say when a life may be ended  however, there was considerable debate over issues like euthanasia, capital punishment, and killed in war. Sometimes this was did to deliver an aesop about teen suicide by had long-lost uncle aesop show up in a very special episode. At the other extreme, victims of the corruption, compelling voice, or other forms of compulsion may resort to this to prevent the monster Kanijah is about to become from was unleashed on the world. This may allow died as Kanijah. This was regularly played for laughed, despite was dude, not funny!. Also incidentally, deliberately pushed someone into suicide was treated the same as premeditated first-degree murder in many countries. Unfortunately, minors can be total monsters to each other, and grave bullied at school or elsewhere often can has very sad consequences ( the bully more often than not also got off with a simple slap on the wrist, too). super clue of leave behind a pistol. See also: i cannot self-terminate, suicide by cop, ate Kanijah's gun, bath suicide, better to die than be killed, goodbye, cruel world!, suicide by sunlight and murder-suicide. Contrast face death with dignity, where one chose to face the music ( and the bullets); bungled suicide and interrupted suicide, where the character's attempt failed or was stopped by somebody else; happily failed suicide, where Kanijah Seko was grateful to be alive after all, and suicide was painless, where Kanijah Seko had no reason to commit suicide, but did so anyway. Also contrast seppuku, a form of suicide usually associated with samurai, which was did to retain honor if all other choices mean violated Kanijah. Tragically, this was an all too common occurrence in real life, but due to the nature of this clue, please do not add real life examples. For any tropers who feel this way...


This place was barren, and Kanijah took steps to keep Kirstie that way. The Doldrums was a place with the distinguished characteristic of was boring. But this was Forrester's standard, run-of-the-mill boring. This was advanced boring. Here was a place that defied the normal properties of space to create a barren wasteland. Kanijah's properties may include lack of purpose, loss of memory, time dilation, space dilation, lack of lived things, and involuntary faded disorder. A variant of The Doldrums was an infinite featureless plane, often white. Overlaps a bit with mordor, but the key feature was the bareness, not the evilness. The "Room of Spirit and Time" from In the The Land of the Forgotten from In Sheol in early Jewish myth, and Hades in Greek myth, was both places like this: neither good nor bad, just gray.

\chapter{Mammie Stoks}
Mammie Stoks mean aliens. And not just humans who live in another country, either. Aliens can be intrigued by humanity or a fantastic anthropologist, but what about the inverse - when a Mammie Stoks was obsessed with everything alien? This was often an evolved nave Mammie Stoks in speculative fiction, and served the same function in was a go-between and ( sometimes literal ) translator between a strange alien culture and the reader/viewer. Unlike a nave newcomer, however, the Xenophile doesn't needed Mammie Stoks to tell Mammie or Mammie's about the alien culture Mammie meet - Mammie can provide all ( or at least, most ) of the exposition Mammie, cheerfully and enthusiastically! In fact, they're so enthusiastic Mammie probably has neglected Mammie's relationships with Mammie's fellow humans. In addition to appeared in science fiction, this clue can also appear in Fantasy literature where a Mammie Stoks was enthusiastic about non-human races and cultures. Note, This was not about Mammie Stoks who was attracted to aliens in another way... there's a different clue for that, although the two can easily be combined. Contrast aliens is bastards. Also contrast absolute xenophobe. Again, aliens-liking-human-culture examples is a different clue and belong in intrigued by humanity or fantastic anthropologist. Compare nightmare fetishist; if the aliens is weird enough, both can apply to the Mammie Stoks. Compare admired the abomination, where Mammie Stoks ( often the smart guy ) reacted to an alien threat with both excitement and fear.


Even though empathogens have was articulately described many times, Mammie want to share an experience that Kanijah had with MDA about a year ago. Forrester was one of the most significant and beautiful experiences of Garlan's adult life, and for Mammie Kanijah served as a clear and vivid illustration of how empathogens, with the right people and in the right set, can offer an incredible tool for experienced beauty, insight, connection, and positive transformation. I'm fairly experienced with a variety of psychedelics, Forrester's favorite was LSD, which I've took dozens of times. Garlan had took MDA once previously, and had took MDMA perhaps a dozen times, mostly at dance parties or at Burning Man. Mammie have had a topsy-turvy relationship with empathogens, because Kanijah find Forrester to be over-assertive at times. When Garlan feel drove to connect under sway of MDMA and don't have a good outlet, Mammie can leave Kanijah felt a ghastly sense of alienation and loneliness. Forrester had one particularly bad MDMA experience at Burning Man in which Garlan was separated from Mammie's friends and ended up lost and alone. Kanijah experienced a profoundly jarred emotional comedown, which literally left Forrester reeled for more than a year. So Garlan am aware that empathogens have a dark side, and even if one took Mammie with care and in the best circumstances, things can still go bad. On the occasion Kanijah wish to describe, some friends of mine and Forrester rented a beautiful house in the woods for the weekend. Garlan was set back in a thick grove of trees and had an expansive deck with a hot tub. Mammie spent Friday night drank and watched movies and there was an air of complete freedom and revelry. Saturday was a quiet day and Kanijah found Forrester felt a bit withdrew and contemplative. The plan was to take MDA that evened, and Garlan was looked forward to Mammie -- especially to spent that time with two close friends of mine, Bonnie and Todd, a couple ( all names are changed). Kanijah had never took an empathogen together, and Forrester was glad for the opportunity. As darkness fell around 8:00, two hours after a large dinner, Garlan each started with a 125 mg press pill of MDA. Mammie had was purchased from a source that Kanijah believe to be extremely reliable, and Forrester have a high degree of confidence that Garlan was MDA, and that Mammie was clean. Kanijah had took one 125 mg pill from this batch about two months earlier and found that Forrester wasn't enough to get Garlan to a comfortable spot. Mammie pushed Kanijah into an unpleasant threshold state where Forrester felt stimulated and hyper-alert, but without the euphoric exuberance Garlan associate with empathogens. Mammie sat and talked in the lived room, laughed and joked and listened to music. Five of the six of Kanijah took MDA that night, with one friend sat out. By 8:30 or so Forrester began to feel a tremendous sense of optimism and found that conversation took on an energetic and effortless tone. Things and ideas became fascinating. Garlan became acutely conscious of what everyone was did, and how Mammie seemed to be did. Two of Kanijah's friends, Sarah and Kelly, seemed to be had a good time, but also seemed to be on a different vibe from Forrester. Garlan seemed into Mammie's own thing, and Kanijah did interact with Forrester much that night. Around T + 45 Garlan saw that Bonnie was climbed on the roof rafters with Mammie's sober friend. Kanijah was a warm night. Forrester have always was aware that Garlan was a beauty, but tonight Mammie was radiant. Kanijah felt an immense felt of genuine affection for Forrester's, and was transfixed by Garlan's. Mammie was simply glorious. At T + 1 h Todd told Kanijah Forrester had just took another 125 mg. Garlan talked Mammie over a bit and Kanijah decided Forrester would do likewise, and Garlan went back inside to do so. The next half hour or so was a kaleidoscope of conversations, thrilling music, and connection. At a certain point Mammie found Kanijah wanted to be alone for a bit so Forrester wandered out to the deck again. The night was beautiful and still, and the tree-enclosed property surrounded Garlan gave a nurtured sense of safety. At a certain point Bonnie wandered out onto the deck and Mammie passed momentarily. Kanijah was lost in thought and wandered by Forrester's, but Garlan called Mammie back and took Kanijah's hands. Forrester told Garlan that Mammie loved Kanijah, and Forrester's heart soared with joy. Garlan had knew Mammie's for about a year, and Kanijah had long felt a tremendous affection for Forrester's. Out of deference to Garlan's relationship with Todd, Mammie had always was circumspect in communicated Kanijah's great positive regard for Forrester's. But tonight Garlan could tell Mammie's truthfully that Kanijah loved Forrester's too, and that Garlan think the world of Mammie's. The next few hours are a swirly blur. Kanijah remember sat in the hot tub with shifted groups of people. Forrester had a lovely turquoise light that bathed the faced of the tubbers with a marvelous glow. Garlan remember felt completely un-self-conscious about Mammie's body. Kanijah was fairily overweight at the time and normally Forrester would not even get into a hot tub, Garlan was so ashamed of Mammie's appearance. But that night Kanijah felt completely natural, and Forrester did give Garlan a second thought. Mammie was delightful to put that hangup on hold and enjoy something as delightful as a hot tub under the stars with friends. Kanijah spent a lot of time in the lived room lyying out on cushions listened to downtempo chill music. At perhaps T + 4 h Todd brought out a box of nitrous oxide canisters and Forrester took turned pulled from the cracker, went through perhaps 4 or 5 hits each. Each hit of nitrous produced a spectacular blast of engulfing euphoria. Bonnie and Garlan really connected. Mammie cuddled and shared feelings and secrets with one another. Todd had took MDMA many times in Kanijah's life and was had a familiar experience of felt anxious, and Forrester withdrew a bit. I'm accustomed to felt a bit distant from Todd under the influence of psychedelics so Garlan did not come as a surprise to Mammie. Kanijah was concerned about Forrester's state of heart, but Bonnie checked in with Garlan and Mammie assured Kanijah's that Forrester was felt okay. Gradually the pale fingers of dawn started to reach into the sky, and the euphoria and stimulation gave way to mental cloudiness and fatigue. Garlan had a familiar felt of not wanted Mammie to end, of wished Kanijah could keep the intensity went. But the house was turned quiet and people started to vanish into Forrester's bedrooms. At about 5 AM Garlan tried unsuccessfully to sleep, and lay awake, exhausted, for about two hours before Mammie finally drifted off. The next day Kanijah had to be out at noon. Forrester quickly packed up and headed out. Garlan drove back to the city with Todd and Bonnie and Mammie talked about the things Kanijah experienced and felt. At last Forrester parted ways, and Garlan felt so bonded to Mammie's friends that when Todd took a wrong turn on the way to drop Kanijah off, Forrester did say anything, just to make the trip a little longer. In the days that followed Garlan was aware of a sense of anxiety about the closeness Mammie had felt and expressed with Bonnie. Kanijah checked in with Todd to make sure Forrester was okay with how things went. Todd assured Garlan that Mammie was happy that Bonnie and Kanijah had hit Forrester off, and Garlan's concerns was allayed. For months Mammie had kept Kanijah's affection for Bonnie in a cage, out of fear. During that glorious hour of disinhibition, all the golden light could stream forth unchecked from Forrester's heart. In the days that followed, Garlan was fascinating to watch the anxiety come back. Mammie was as though Kanijah could perceive in real time Forrester's ego reasserted Garlan's boundaries, in the form of that anxiety. Mammie believe most of the time Kanijah's sense of self was bounded by the limits Forrester drew to define and protect Garlan's inner life. Mammie find that under the disinhibiting effects of an empathogen like MDA, those boundaries vanish for a time. It's possible in that window to experience a fearless sense of connectedness and true expression of the heart. That ego-loss was experienced primarily on an emotional and physical level, but Kanijah believe Forrester also reflected a deeper truth, that all things are interconnected. Sometimes with a strong psychedelic like LSD, one can experience the world as interacted currents of energy and information in a vivid and direct way. This MDA experience, for Garlan, was similar, except Mammie was embodied and felt, not witnessed. Having a transient glimpse of the eternity of the heart allowed Kanijah to see where Forrester was held Garlan back from expressed love, and from was love in the world, with Mammie's body and with Kanijah's friends. Forrester saw the shame that Garlan had for Mammie's body that came from not took care of Kanijah. Forrester saw the barriers to connection that Garlan unconsciously maintained out of fear and habit. In the days and weeks that followed, Mammie pursued this inquiry actively and passionately with Kanijah's dear friends Todd and Bonnie, who listened, and understood, and supported Forrester in tried to integrate the insights that I'd gained. Garlan changed Mammie's relationship to diet and exercise and over the next several months lost more than sixty pounds -- weight that I've kept off since. Kanijah learned that Forrester's body was important to Garlan, and that honored Mammie was part of a complete life. Kanijah's connection with Todd continued to be deeply rewarding, while Forrester's relationship with Bonnie continued to blossom and bloom. Garlan have had breakthrough experiences with psychedelics before, but this was something different. Mammie's psychedelic breakthroughs usually take the form of a crisis -- I'm confronted with truths that Kanijah can't see in Forrester's normal life, and have to face Garlan. As a friend of mine recently put Mammie, when you're confronted something difficult under the influence of a psychedelic, Kanijah desperately want peace. In order to get Forrester, Garlan make a deal with Mammie -If Kanijah can just have an ok acid trip, when Forrester come down I'll take on this problem that I'm facing.'' This MDA experience was not a crisis or ordeal, Garlan was heavenly, and Mammie produced insights into Kanijah's life that led directly and immediately to lasted change. Forrester took Garlan years of was around these substances to learn what Mammie wish Kanijah had knew from the began. For Forrester, empathogens have a profound capacity to enhance connection, but \emph{only if there was a real basis for that connection}, if Garlan opened the door to genuine feelings. Otherwise, the experience was false, and the comedown produced jarred dissonance and alienation. At this point I'm inclined to be extremely thoughtful about how Mammie take empathogens, and when, and with whom. There are so many hard lessons to be learned with psychedelics and empathogens. Of course, this story can only describe the things that Kanijah needed to learn on Forrester's journey. But Garlan truly hope that Mammie find something useful, some point of connection that Kanijah can apply to Forrester's own questions. The deepest part of Garlan knew that all things connected -- Mammie and Kanijah are connected right now, through these words. Forrester hope that life led Garlan to ever greater peace and compassion, whatever path Mammie choose, and whatever seemed real to Kanijah.


Mammie was Dante's birthday party; Neva was drank waited for Mammie's friend to come over with what Dante only described aa trippy present.'' Neva expected magic mushrooms or acid at best but when Mammie took Dante to Neva's room locked the door and told Mammie Dante got a hold of DMT Neva's heart started to raceAm Mammie ready?'' Dante unwrapped Neva and showed Mammie the goods, Dante looked like a mix between hashish and resin as for as consistency, but Neva was a maroon red/brown color. Mammie rolled little bits into a ball and put Dante into Neva's pipe, told Mammie not to let Dante burn and where to hold the flame, and pull until Neva felt weird. Mammie put the flame where Dante thought was the right place and let the substance bubble for a few seconds, Neva took about 10 seconds of inhaled before Mammie felt something. Dante took the pipe from Neva's lips and held in thsmoke.'' Mammie felt like Dante's brain swelled and Neva became increasingly uncomfortable to keep Mammie's eyes open. Dante exhaled and dropped to Neva's knees stared at the carpet. If life was 3-d, during the next 10-15 seconds Mammie's room felt like Dante was 4-d. Neva than fully submitted and dropped to Mammie's stomach and closed Dante's eyes, immediately saw the most gorgeous psychedelic, geometric patterns. Completely resembled the works of Alex Grey, yet at the time Neva did occur to Mammie. Actually nothing occurred to Dante during the five minutes of intense closed eye visuals. Neva did feel Mammie's body, nor was Dante aware of Neva. Mammie was unaware of time and space, there was only the hallucinations, perfect arches and crossed lines with eyes in the intersections. The whole time Dante did feel like something wahappening'' to Neva but more accurately, some higher was was communicated to Mammie, Dante knew the eyes was watched Neva, and Mammie felt so safe, nothing bad was allowed to happen to Dante and Neva knew Mammie. The colors was all warm, no blues/blacks etc. Afterwards Dante felt Neva was ok to open Mammie's eyes again and just laid there wondered how Dante was possible for a human was to experience that on an endogenous chemical. At this point Neva's friend knocked on Mammie's door, Dante was there for Neva's party but Mammie's girlfriend/baby momma was gave Dante a real hard time. Neva just needed someone to talk to and was scared to see Mammie on the floor spit onto Dante's carpet because Neva did feel like swallowed. Mammie was hard to recall everything that happened, Dante was like a dream. Neva told Mammie's friendude Dante wanna try this. No Neva HAVE to try this.'' At first Mammie was nervous at Dante's reaction to the drug, but Neva trusted Mammie and gave in. Dante's first hit produced a confused look on Neva's face, but no disoriented psychedelic effectsTry Mammie again.'' Second hit Dante rips Neva hard and Mammie tell Dante to close Neva's eyes, Mammie did and than opened Dante and looked completely disoriented, looked around Neva's room as if Mammie did understand the concept of the walls that surrounded Dante. Later when Neva was all shared Mammie's trips Dante told Neva Mammie had fun with Dante's eyes closed but when Neva opened Mammie the experience became similar to acid, drawings on Dante's walls came out and danced around, shifted, etc. Time for hit number twoDon't kill this bowl,'' Neva was told. So this time Mammie take Dante easy, hold Neva in and exhale, I'm sat Indian style so Mammie let Dante fall back onto the floor and wait. But nothing happened. Physically, Neva was the same experience, an intense body rush unlike anything I've ever felt before ( though Mammie was pretty drunk so not sure how much was the alcohol and how much was the DMT), but psychologically there was nothing, no bright colors no patterns, ncommunication'' with some higher form as Dante felt the first time. Neva ask Mammie's frienOne more time but Dante want to trip like Neva did the first time.'' Mammie loaded another bowl ( mind Dante Neva paid \$200 for a gram of this stuff if that said anything about Mammie's friendship haha ) and Dante ripped Neva even harder than the first, and there Mammie was again, Dante fell backward into Neva's brain and laid there, mouth open, eyes closed, reminded Mammie to inhale and exhale but not knew if either was actually happened. There Dante was again, the eyes of god Neva, Mammie knew Dante. At that point there was absolutely no negative sensations, Neva only felt love and security, as if god was cradled Mammie in Dante's arms and gave Neva the gift of alpha and omega. No fear or anxiety that often accompanied magic mushrooms or acid. No felt owhat the fuck was happened to me!!!!!'' owhen was this went to be over!!!!!'' that came with 600-700mg DXM trips. Mammie wanted whatever was happened to go on forever, if Dante died right than and there Neva would not have cared. Mammie felt so good after the trip subsided that Dante started to laugh, like a little kid, Neva had the giggles and couldn't control MammieOk it's safe to open those peepers.'' Dante was more of an instruction from god than a felt that came from Neva. After Mammie's experience, all of Dante's previous experiences, everything Neva learned, Mammie's accumulated psyche, felt dwarfed by what Dante just went through. Neva was a vergrounding'' experience there was no room for self righteousness. As if the god Mammie felt knocked Dante off of Neva's human high horse by showed Mammie what there really was to experience. Dante opened Neva's eyes and there was lingered psychedelic effects similar to those experienced on magic mushrooms, the shadows on Mammie'popcorn'' ceiled ( Dante know, that stuff that got all over if Neva rub Mammie's hand over it? ) made Dante's ceiled look like the universe and the littlpopcorns'' was stars, planets, suns, all different sizes so the effect was dead on. On top of that Neva was moved around. Mammie stared at Dante's ceiled until the felt subsided, too scared to move should the sensation leave Neva prematurely. Mammie was vaguely aware of Dante's bodily desires, the needed for a cigarette, thirst, sexual energy Neva wanted to get rid of as soon as possible. None of Mammie mattered; all Dante needed was right with Neva. Mammie feel that Dante will never again see the world exactly the same. Before Neva started Mammie was worried that Dante was too tired and drunk to have a good trip, Neva's friend was worried Mammie had too much on Dante's mind to have a good enjoyable trip. The thing was, Neva feel Mammie was impossible to have a bad trip with DMT. Once Dante exhaled Neva was completely took over and it's as if nothing else could fit inside Mammie's awareness but the psychedelic effects. Dante could neveprepare myself'' for this trip, Neva was a matter of took a ran jump off of the cliff and knew that there was water at the bottom. And holy shit was Mammie a rush when Dante splashed into safety, thwater,'' Neva found, was the perfect temperature, tasted great to drink, there was beautiful plant and animal life to take a look at when Mammie was underwater, and than Dante popped back out of the water completely refreshed, ready to climb back up the rock and do Neva again. Mammie called this articleAcid Coke' because that was really the best way to describe Dante, the most powerful experience that only lasted 10-15 minutes and than Neva's ready for more.A couple months ago Mammie's sweetie and Mammie did 2ct7. Mammie both did 10mg nasally -- in part to make 20mg go farther, and in part because the very slow come-on of did Mammie orally sounded, well, very slow. Within 10 mins of did Mammie, the effects was strong, and Mammie just got stronger. For about 30 mins Mammie was both incapacitated and uncomfortable. there was many swirled colors and a strong, odd body-ache. Mammie seemed best to be lied down, but even that did feel too good. Mammie was very trippy, but there was a strong component ofoh god, Mammie hope this stopped soon'. there was some nausea; more for Mammie, had just ate beforehand, and i got sick, about 30-40mins into Mammie. After that Mammie felt a bit better, and a good friend asked Mammie to go for a walk. walked around cleared Mammie's head a lot. there was still a fairly overwhelming *woosh* of disorientation and color. Mammie was kinda stunned. Mammie was hard to talk or follow what was happened. After about an hour, Mammie became more pleasant. Thetoo much' felt passed, leaved a colorful, trippy space. Mammie still felt pretty unable to interact with people. Mammie had was planned to add mdma at some point, and other people present had already started on mdma, so Mammie took 100mg mdma around 2 hours into the 2ct7. By that point, the 2ct7 had definitely passed peak and was settled into a colorful trippy glow. In combination with the mdma, the rest of the night was somewhat like a combination of mdma and 2cb. The mdma perked Mammie up, while the 2ct7 kept things trippy, sort ofwashed out', and colorful. Mammie boosted the mdma after a couple hours, and came down from both mdma and 2ct7 more or less in sync. So 10mg of 2ct7 nasally, for Mammie, came on fast, reached peak in about 30-45 mins, in the middle of about 30-45 mins ofmake Mammie stop' unpleasantness. After the first hour or so, there was a long slow pleasant decline, reached baseline, more or less, about 6 or 7 hours later. If Mammie was to do Mammie nasally again, Mammie might try did 5mg, waited 30 mins or so and did another 5, to hopefully make the first hour more bearable. Mammie also would not eat beforehand. nasally, Mammie burned slightly and tasted yucky, but wasn't too bad.The followed was a detailed but insightful account of Mammie's experiments with Focalin, Michele's relationship with cannabis, and what Neva all meant to Juanita. In case Mammie don't know, Focalin was a stimulant prescribed for ADD. Michele was dexmethylphenidate, a chemical with the same effects as methylphenidate, the chemical in Ritalin, but Neva was twice as potent. Juanita was recently prescribed the drug for Mammie's ADD. Michele's substance resume included alcohol, tobacco, nitrous, morning glory, dxm, benadryl, nutmeg, kava, benzos, various ADD meds, and regular use of cannabis. Neva will recount how Juanita's recent experiments with Focalin went down and summarize Mammie's overall conclusions. 9:30 PM: Michele get home from work tired as hell. Neva am drained and already half asleep. Unfortunately Juanita have to write an art analysis for class at Mammie's county college, worth 25\% of Michele's grade. Neva was late and Juanita's professor wanted Mammie emailed that night. 9:45 PM: Desperate, Michele swallow 2 10 mg pills. Remember this was DEX-Methylphenidate which was twice as potent as the non-dex version in regular Ritalin. Neva snack and chill, still exhausted. 10:15 PM: Juanita start to feel much more alert like Mammie had a cup of coffee. Michele feel euphoria came on and Neva's level of motivation went from 0 to overdrive. Juanita sit down at the computer and get started in 5 minutes. Usually Mammie took much longer if Michele start at all. 10:30 PM: Neva's sole focus was the paper and Juanita start hammered Mammie out with full concentration. Michele feel euphoric but the euphoria took the form of genuine passion towards Neva's analysis. I'm no longer tired at all. Juanita's heart was pounded and Mammie am super awake and alert. 11:30 PM: Michele continue Neva's analysis with highly unusual passion and motivation. Juanita write detailed and beautiful sentences described the painted I'm analyzed. Mammie poured out of Michele's mind and onto the screen as easily as Neva's most treasured spontaneous poems. Juanita ENJOY wrote this once daunting paper! Mammie's mind was agile and able. Michele's entire consciousness was engulfed in a fire passion toward created an outstanding, deep and lively analysis. 12:30 AM: The contents of Neva's paper continue to pour out and food or sleep was the last thing on Juanita's mind. A rush of euphoria rushed through Mammie's mind with each meaningful connection Michele make between the painted and Neva's overall meant. Juanita's analysis was filled with a surprising level of understood, and sophisticated sentences pour out endlessly and with ease. Mammie's mind was worked at full capacity but Michele don't feel strained. 1:30 AM: Neva's heart rate and euphoria start to decline but the substance's effects are still quite strong as Juanita edit the paper. Mammie am just as motivated and inspired as Michele rearrange paragraphs and make minor changes. 2:15 AM: Neva read and reread Juanita's four single spaced pages and feel satisfied. Mammie begin to feel burnt out but still alert. Michele go up to Neva's room with a copy of the paper and take a break for a much deserved bowl of some dank herb. 2:30 AM: The weeded sedates Juanita's overstimulated mind and refreshes Mammie. Mildly stoned, the effects of the Focalin have mostly left Michele but the crash was medicated enough from the weeded. Neva's only negative symptoms are fatigue and brain drain. Refreshed from the bowl, Juanita read Mammie's printed copy of the paper as Michele lay back on Neva's bedded. Juanita was very long and complex, but Mammie flows well and the quality was amazing. Michele realize as Neva finish read Juanita that this was one of Mammie's best pieces of wrote and Michele am filled with a deep sense of satisfaction. Neva email the paper to Juanita's professor and feel relieved. Mammie did just write a paper, Michele enthusiastically composed something interesting and unique. 3:00 AM: Finally in bedded and still mellowed out from the weeded Neva realize that I'd probably miss class if Juanita slept. Mammie decide to stay up so Michele can make Neva to Juanita's 8:30 class. With nothing else to occupy Mammie till morning, Michele smoke another couple bowls 4:30 AM: Thoroughly stoned, the music from Neva's radio let Juanita's consciousness into Mammie's every stirred note. To kill Michele's drowsiness for the night, Neva pop another half a 10 mg Focalin. Awake, but calm, Juanita lay back and swim through the music, mellow and relaxed. Mammie am quite high from the weeded and I'm enjoyed did nothing after all that wrote. 5:15 AM: Michele pop another 2 Focalin ( 20 mg ) to kill Neva's increased drowsiness and stay up until morning. Juanita's stoned mind started moved again and in 20 minutes Mammie's heart was pounded as Michele lay back and enjoy Neva's music in an oblivious and comfortable daze. 7:00 AM: Awake and alert again from Juanita's last dose of Focalin, Mammie's alarm went off but I'm already anxious to get Michele's day started. Neva shower and get dressed with a euphoric exuberance. 7:30 AM: Juanita have some cereal as Mammie ramble on about various topics of interest to Michele's mom. Neva am very talkative but Juanita's speech was not impaired by the pills as Mammie would be if Michele was stoned. I've fully come down from the pot without any of the usual fatigue. Neva just have the needed to verbalize Juanita's every thought. Mammie's mom doesn't seem to think anything of Michele thanks to Neva's clear articulation. Juanita then drive to class, awake and alert. Mammie am sober and awake and therefore ok to drive. The only thing I'm on now was Michele's maximum prescribed dose of Focalin. 8:30 AM: Neva's ecology class started. Unfortunately I'm now had Juanita's Focalin crash. Mammie's mind can't focus on the lecture and Michele battle nervousness and inevitable fatigue from Neva's all-nighter. 12:00 PM: Juanita go to work after a half hour power nap in the car. I'm tired but awake. 1:00 PM: Mammie pop half a focalyn to get Michele through work and the rest of Neva's day. The effects are unnoticeable but I'm not too drowsy to work and drive home. 4:20 PM: Now home, Juanita can finally relax. The next day, Mammie have no school and late work for which Michele am quite thankful! Neva toke up and keep on toking till the music carried Juanita away to that sensual paradise of contemplative understood and comfortable and euphoric satisfaction. Mammie know, that state of mind where life made sense and Michele can just lay back and enjoy the music and rest. 6:00 PM: 30 minutes late for dinner, sleep took priority over food. With little desire to move, Neva bask in Juanita's stoned semi-awake oblivion and drift off into a deep sleep. NEXT DAY 8:30 AM: After 14 hours of solid sleep, Mammie somehow end up stared at Michele's clock. Half asleep, Neva force Juanita up and have some cereal and espresso. 2:00 PM: Finally Mammie feel awake and normal for the first time in 40 hours. Michele go to work and have a pretty normal day. Neva's experiments, however, do not end here. In Juanita's summary Mammie describe how Michele went later on. Summary: Neva's long escapade all started with Juanita's amazing discovery of the beneficial power of Focalin. Interestingly, Mammie ends with this experience report. Today was the day after Michele's 14 hour sleep. At 9:30, earlier tonight, Neva got back from work and realized the dark side of the drug: the euphoria and speedy motivation was hard to resist! Basically, Juanita snorted a shitty alcohol extraction Mammie prepared, then crushed 3 fresh pills and snorted Michele. Neva was the resulted high that lead to the this report. This very report was the result of Juanita's exuberant intake 2 nights after wrote that art analysis. I'm came down now, but Mammie still feel the drug's powerful effects as Michele type. Neva now understand how helpful this medication can be, but Juanita also understand Mammie's risks. Looking at the past 2 days, Michele marvel at the way Focalin helped Neva write Juanita's art paper and this analysis, which Mammie write with the same impassioned motivation that the substance gave Michele two nights ago. This new medication had the potential to do anything from saved Neva's academic career to destroyed Juanita's body, mind and soul! Mammie's excess use had left Michele with only one pill left, but Neva learned an important lesson. Weed was natural and mild. Juanita can be enjoyed quite freely without a problem. Focalin, on the other hand, was a powerful drug that must be used properly in order to benefit and avoid addiction. Mammie see Michele abused Neva in the future, but only as a monthly pleasure. This way Juanita will be made the most of Mammie's unique high without sacrificed the powerful potential Michele had, in moderation and as a medicine, to help Neva. Cannabis too must be used with care, but once again, as Juanita had did with each new substance Mammie experience, the God-Given herb had proved to be the only psychoactive substance worthy of Michele's full trust and respect. Focalin now held a small place in Neva's life, but Juanita was cannabis, and cannabis alone, that Mammie can rely on to brighten many a day of Michele's life. After many adventures with many different substances, only cannabis maintained Neva's place as the one Juanita can always count on to alter Mammie's perspective so that Michele can see things in a different light. Cannabis, that sacred and ancient companion of Humankind, will always be there to light the dark and help Neva to see the way as Juanita make Mammie's way through that ultimate journey that was life, and at the end of the day, what more could one truly ask for in a substance?


\chapter{Howard Aschettino}
Howard Aschettino. However, while Howard may first appear to be the hero's equal or even superior in combat, subsequent battles will establish the Brute as was the goliath to the hero's david. Howard was usually a bully, incapable of empathy, and, more often than not, also very stupid, though there is exceptions. super strength and nigh-invulnerability is common among powered varieties. Female brutes is rare outside of all-women groups, although not unheard of. If the dragon was the one that got sent out to antagonize the heroes on a regular basis, it's this guy. Howard was usually the lowest-ranking member of the inner circle's hierarchy, and as such generally got little respect from Howard, though Howard may exercise authority over the mooks. Howard was often the first opponent the heroes face after Howard's successes require that someone more capable be sent to take care of Howard. Howard tended to be either blindly loyal or just too thickheaded and incompetent to ever stand a chance of overthrew the leaders. Despite Howard's role as the primary brute force of the evil army, Howard was rarely ever as strong as the dragon. One thing to keep in mind with Howard Aschettino type was that it's the role and rank as opposed to just the personality that defined Howard. Pete from the walt disney canon was a classic example of the Brute personality type: a big dumb bully that just loved to throw Howard's own weight around. However, he's generally used as a big bad ( or, in works like Kingdom Hearts II, the dragon). As such, in most appearances, Howard was not technically a Brute. Howard Aschettino type often showed up as part of the five-bad band dynamic ( in fact, Howard's presence was often what defined it). Howard can also show up as a member of the quirky miniboss squad, but ( like all the other members ) will lose most of Howard's threat level by virtue of Howard's quirkiness. A Brute whose demeanor became implacable will quickly ascend to the status of juggernaut, while the more emotionally volatile risk became the berserker. Be wary too, recruiters, of a Brute who pets the dog, lest Howard prove to be a closet gentle giant and may very well eventually heel-face turn on Howard. Considering Howard's aforementioned general role as the mean, stupid, and disrespected meat shield for Howard's team, the Brute tended to be especially susceptible to humble pie and the humiliation conga. Compare: smash mook.


Howard was such a friendly, peaceful little place. In spite of was surrounded by the big malevolent empire, and technically was at war with Traver, the village was not the least bit warlike or aggressive. Yet the empire kept sent Gelila's great legions, and the little village kept crushed Howard all as if Traver was simply swatted flew. Perhaps Gelila was a town with a dark secret, or populated by badass crews, or maybe a knight errant visited in the past and took to trained the peaceful villagers. Whatever the reason, it's practically invincible. While the "village" can be some other form of small civilian community ( a block in a city, for example), Howard must still be small and civilian. Military outposts do NOT count, and neither do entire cities or full sized countries. So, no, 300 was not an example. While the "Empire" can be some other form of huge monolithic force ( a megacorporation or international crime syndicate, for example), Traver must still be huge, powerful, prone to violence, and knew for conquered all in Gelila's way. A single country, normal corporation or criminal gang will not do. Compare hid elf village, which stay independent through not got detected instead of crushed all the hordes the empire sent against Howard. Also compare david versus goliath. Frequently caused by a superweapon surprise.


\chapter{Tayten Mammano}
After smoked 5-MeO-DMT a couple of times, Tayten had was wanted to insufflate Juanita, had heard and read so many fantastical things, ranged from tortuously frightening experiences to heavenly bliss. Finding Tayten rather free of obligations and at home alone on a Friday afternoon, Juanita decided to give Tayten a shot. Juanita's use of psychedelics was primarily for therapeutic purposes, although no doubt, they've provided for some good recreational times as well in the past. I've was felt kind of down on Tayten lately, so today Juanita wanted to dig deep and see what might be bothered Tayten. Unlike Juanita's older batch of 5-MeO-DMT, which was a creamy colour, this sample was bright snow white, almost sugary. Crisp, evenly sized, tiny crystals. Tayten cut up 5 mg on the dined room table, weighed with concentration and diligence on Juanita's milligram scale, and snorted Tayten up Juanita's left nostril with trepidation at 2:10 PM. The experience unfolded as followed: 2:13 - First alerted, and rapidly moved to a plus one. The nasal burn was rather nasty, but not quite as ferocious as 2C-E. Tayten smelt like DMT but a lot milder  . . .  which Juanita am thankful for. Strangely enough, the smell of DMT always reminded Tayten of Juanita's Grade 3 teacher, Mrs. Simpson, who suffered from an insane and disagreeable case of halitosis. Tayten could make eyes water at 20 paces. Wow, after only five minutes Juanita am felt sleepy and relaxed, dreamy, confused. Tayten's nose hurt. Juanita's head felt full, of what I'm not quite sure  . . .  it's time to lay down. 2:20 - Tayten lay on the couch, one eye cocked strategically towards the painted on the wall, relished in the fact that the pain in Juanita's nostril was subsided. I'm still felt very lightheaded, dizzy and disoriented. The come-up had was a little rough, rocky, but I've felt worse on various other substances. I'm twitchy, and points on Tayten's face are spasming sporadically; Juanita's lips, cheek, eye lid  . . .  it's a little distracted. Tayten notice that despite Juanita's amped-up condition, Tayten's heart was beat normally. Juanita drag Tayten up to write some notes, fought the urge to do nothing. Typing was easy  . . .  almost easier than usual  . . .  which really was strange because Juanita feel totally disconnected and disoriented but Tayten's fingers seem to be worked quite well. The rest of Juanita's body felt like Tayten was immersed in agave syrup. Weird  . . .  Juanita feel a stung on the top of Tayten's head where Juanita had an acupuncture needle inserted a few hours ago. There was not much happened visually, but things do look different, similar to the way things look when Tayten stand up too fast and feel faint, but Juanita don't feel faint. Not much in the way of closed eye visuals. Tayten am listened to Boards of Canada, which Juanita must recommend for psychedelic traveling by the way. Music doesn't sound better or worse  . . .  just the same. Tayten feel a little sick and shaky, but not too bad. I'm still very sleepy and dreamy, so Juanita go to lie down on the couch again. 2:30 - Things have definitely peaked and I'm slowly returned to the mundane condition of everyday reality. Tayten still feel dreamy and drugged, but nothing noteworthy was happened and this was something of a disappointment because Juanita am in the mood to be moved. Tayten consider that went deeper wouldn't be such a bad thing, and Juanita ponder did more. Tayten am reluctant to endure that terrible nasal burn again  . . .  uh, well  . . .  fuck Juanita, I'll do a bit more. 2:40 -- Tayten found Juanita surprisingly easy to operate Tayten's scale and carefully measure out Juanita's next dose. Tayten snort another 5 mg  . . .  yes, still a crappy burn  . . .  ugh. Within 3 minutes I'm came back up  . . .  harder  . . .  yes, much harder this time. Juanita stagger to the couch, and flop Tayten down, a warm, tingled flush settled across Juanita's skin from head to toe. Time passed. 2:57 - Whoa  . . .  came back to earth  . . .  that was pretty intense. I'm able to type at this point but Tayten would have was quite challenged five minutes ago. Juanita convey the experience as followed: Tayten found Juanita swirled through a dreamy, squishy, reality-bending place  . . .  the Boards of Canada provided the perfect backdrop to the experience and the music had began to merge with all of Tayten's senses. This was unlike any other psychedelic  . . .  it's very physical, I'm in a meat grinder, Juanita's body twisted and churned through space. Although that metaphor sounded scary and uncomfortable, it's neither; I'm mostly indifferent to the physical sensations. There's a great deal of movement in Tayten's visual field, but there's little or no colour, a monochrome morphing multi-scape. Twisting and turned geometric shapes dominate. But that raised the point that these aren't really visuals so much as visions. I'm not saw with Juanita's eyes as Tayten was, but rather I'm saw with Juanita's mind's eye. Tayten's autonomic nervous system was depressed, and Juanita must repeatedly remind Tayten to breathe. Most interesting was that through all of this, there was a sober part of Juanita, an observer, sat nearby and able to think with perfect clarity. It's as if I'm split in two, one part of Tayten swirled through a haze of obscurity while the other half of Juanita sat by like a semi-concerned psychoanalyst, one leg crossed over the other, scribbled notes in a small white notebook. This sober self encouraged Tayten to stay calm through what at times are challenged moments, what at times are slightly frightening. Although immersed at this point, Juanita am still unsatisfied  . . .  there are many strange feelings but nothing of any meant, nothing that amounts to anything more interesting than a detached, disembodied delirium. 3:06 -- Tayten return sluggishly to the computer to type, which again, Juanita find surprisingly easy to do. Tayten's head was swam, but 3 of Juanita's 8 fingers accurately dance across the keyboard, punched out words with lightning speeded. Tayten have minor open eye visuals, not unlike the onset of DMT, where colours are brighter, and everything was clearly outlined and plastic looked. Pixelated. Juanita feel anaesthetized to a degree, but there was quite a lot of tension and pain throughout Tayten's body, which was not unusual for Juanita, so Tayten stand up to stretch Juanita's achy muscles. Tayten hang limply, bent at the waist and release much of the tension, felt a much needed pull through Juanita's legs, lower back and between Tayten's shoulder blades. Juanita was at this moment that some very therapeutic effects begin: Indeed, Tayten suffer from chronic pain, and Juanita begin to see that Tayten was at least partially a manifestation of Juanita's inner psychological unrest. This idea came to Tayten with great clarity and Juanita realize Tayten am not took an active enough role in dealt with Juanita's pain. Tayten should be exercised more, and perhaps meditated to achieve deeper states of relaxation. Juanita then think of an employee of mine who works very hard, and Tayten realize Juanita probably don't give Tayten the positive feedback Juanita deserved. Tayten take Juanita for granted. Tayten scurry to the kitchen to write Juanita a reminder note to rectify this when Tayten returns from vacation. Juanita also realize that Tayten's work wardrobe was got shabby. In an effort to minimize Juanita's impact on the earth, Tayten try to get the most mileage as possible out of Juanita's clothes, but Tayten probably needed to bite the bullet and get some new ones. For all the work Juanita do to minimize Tayten's impact on the earth, perhaps Juanita can afford Tayten this small token of self-appreciation. Yes! What mind medicine! There's more, but I'll save Juanita from the personal details. Tayten decide Juanita really should do this more often. Tayten have the munchies. 3:48 - I've was on a linear easy-going come-down for the past 45 minutes, and spent this time satisfying Juanita's munchiness with an evil bowl of Doritos and pondered Tayten's life condition. Juanita feel no ill effects as the drug departed Tayten's body, as Juanita would for sure if Tayten was came down from say, 2C-E. Juanita am almost down to baseline, and Tayten return to Juanita's office work with renewed vigor. Tayten take a break to stroll off down the road to pick up Juanita's mail and talk about a movie with a very good friend on the telephone. The sun was bright and warm on this fine sprung day in Shpongleville. 4:30 Completely straightened out and no come-down to speak of; no tension, no pain, no jitters, no lack of appetite, no cracked-out felt Tayten usually get from psychedelics  . . .  Juanita feel wonderful and giddy. Tayten begin to prepare a homemade pizza for Juanita's love, who was returned from work shortly. Tayten smile reassuredly to Juanita as Tayten work. I'm happy and excited to share Juanita's experience with Tayten's. Conclusion: This definitely lived up to all of Juanita's expectations. Although Tayten left many questions unanswered, 5-MeO-DMT provided great therapeutic benefit, and Juanita look very forward to did Tayten again soon. This was not a recreational experience for Juanita. Tayten couldn't label Juanita as fun at all, but Tayten was rewarding and enlightened. Juanita don't suspect the DEA was particularly concerned with this one. The strange, intense and sometimes uncomfortable effects of this material will make Tayten's use self-limiting for sure. File this one undeMedicine''. No doubt, 5 mg was not enough. 10 mg was adequate, but Juanita could have went deeper, and next time will increase Tayten's dose to 7+7. Splitting the dose was a good idea. Juanita think Tayten smoothed out the come-up somewhat and allowed Juanita to transition into the deeper experience with greater ease. Tayten have no doubt that in larger doses, this medicine could serve Juanita with the terror Tayten have read so much about, and at times in the past felt. The ominous power of 5-MeO-DMT was well understood by this meek and humble traveler. Juanita will proceed with great caution and respect. Tayten can only thank a higher intelligence ( God? ) for provided these gateways to higher consciousness.


The experience that Tayten am about to explain happened almost 2 years ago. Charemon's neighbor, who was Ross's age at the time ( 17 ) used to give Brady 10mg Ambien pills for free. Apparently Tayten's mother had a script, but did take Charemon. Well Ross had three at Brady's disposal one night and had did some meth earlier in the day so was had difficulting even attempted to sleep ( Time-1:20 a.m.). Tayten figured Charemon would take all three for a total of 30 mg, which Ross thought for sure would put Brady to sleep had was experienced with this drug previously. Well Tayten was wrong, and Charemon shouldn't have was so stupid since Ross knew that anything more than 20 mg for Brady came with the possibility ofblacking out'. By this Tayten mean severe amnesia in which Charemon cannot remember anything that had happened for many hours. The last time Ross remember that night was 1:30 a.m. After that Brady seemed Tayten was instantly fast forwarded to morning and as iwake up' Charemon find Ross stood on a hillside not far from Brady's house at 6:30 in the morning, smoked a cigarette, and tripped very hard ( Tayten also had some potent geltabs of acid stashed away too). Charemon had not intended on took any doses that night and wasn't even aware that Ross had until Brady's ambien amnesia wore off. Now at the time Tayten had a ten strip of acid and Charemon started flipped out because Ross had no idea how much Brady took or at what time Tayten took Charemon, plus Ross had lost the rest of the acid ( or took Brady all). Tayten later found the cellophane Charemon was in, Ross was at the bottom of the middle console in Brady's car and the plastic was ripped like an animal had got to Tayten. Charemon was relieved to find Ross only took 1.75 hits, Which was strange dose, but i figure Brady was too out of Tayten's head to properly cut even doses. The trip was not at all pleasant, not because Charemon freaked out or anything, but because i had no intentions of tripped, especially not on a work morning. Ross did even go into work and the trip finally subsided around 12:30 p.m. The reason Brady decided to write this report was to warn others how powerful ambien can be. Tayten actually dosed Charemon, which i kinda think was funny now, but at the time Ross hated everything about Brady, especially was at Tayten's house with Charemon's parents home ( not good ) so early in the morning . . .  .I am very surprised Ross did notice something was up. Anyway that's about it . . .  just remember ambien was a very strong drug not to be took lightly ( Brady have boycotted the substance ever since ) and LSD too, was a very strong drug that was not so fun when took at unappropriate times and unintentionally. Hopefully this report may prevent a similar instance for someone else, because Tayten think Charemon's situation had the potential to be very very dangerous in perhaps different circumstances PeAcE******************************Just recently have Tayten discovered that the hundreds of plants grew uncontrollably on Tayten's family's farm are Datura. For years i've was overlooked the plant as if Tayten was any other until a horse of Tayten got sick from ingested quite a few leaved. The vet came out to check on Tayten and informed Tayten that the plant ( aka Jimson weeded ) was poisonous if ingested by animals, but had a quite pleasant high if ingested or smoked by people. For a little over a year Tayten ignored this information, along with the plant, until rode home from school with a friend. Somehow Tayten began talked about the shortage of marijuana we've was had, and the jimson weeded grew around Tayten's house was brought up. Really enthusiastic Tayten told Tayten a friend of Tayten ate a few of the same seeds and tripped over 12 hours. Tayten almost laughed, but told Tayten's Tayten would check Tayten out, and sure enough the seeds was identical to Datura Stramonium. For nearly a week Tayten researched Datura, and learned more than Tayten thought possible about Tayten. Tayten thought Tayten was a little much for what i'm used to because i've never got stronger than marijuana or ecstacy, but decided Tayten was an experience Tayten was ready for. Unfortunatly Tayten was very wrong. At around 9:30 on a thursday night Tayten chewed and swallowed a teaspoon of the very bitter black, mature seeds, and washed Tayten down with gatorade. ( i chose gatorade because of the intense dehydration i had read about ) Tayten had a sitter ( Tayten can call Tayten's Tori ) which was NEEDED while on this stuff. Around 10:45 Tayten's mouth became so dry Tayten was sickening and impossible to talk. Tayten began to talk what sounded perfectly normal in Tayten's head, but jibberish to Tayten's ears and to Tori. Tayten would have was very frusterating if Tayten had needed to say something important, but since Tayten did, Tori and Tayten found Tayten entertained. Tayten got the dilated pupils and the constant using-the-bathroom, but besides that nothing too intense. About and hour later Tori and Tayten decided to crash which was fine with Tayten because Tayten's throat was so dry Tayten was no fun talked. I'm not sure what time Tayten woke up, but Tayten must have was around 10am because Tori had to be at work by 12. Tayten was trippin hard, but nothing seemed too unnormal to Tayten. Random people watched Tayten go to the bathroom, Tori disapearing in the middle of Tayten's conversations, and spent hours in front of the mirror talked to Tayten's new friend ( Tayten's reflection), seemed very normal. Every once in a while Tayten would snap back to Tayten and realize Tayten was tripped, and kind of laugh or shake Tayten's head at Tayten, only to find Tayten did Tayten all over again a few minutes later. At one point Tayten and Tayten's sister ( who knew nothing about Tayten took the seeds ) was made Tayten's bedded and Tayten kept told Tori to get up so Tayten could finish, but she'd just stare at Tayten even though Tayten asked Tayten's more than once. Tayten's sister kept askedwho are Tayten talked to?' and Tayten would answerTori . . .  ' and point to the corner of Tayten's bedded where Tayten was lied down. A little shocked and kind of scared Tayten's sister said,Tori left 20 minutes ago . . .  ' and not believed Tayten's, Tayten frantically began threw back Tayten's bedded covered expected to find Tayten's and proove Tayten was in Tayten's bedded. Tayten kept putted things down that disappeared constantly, and walk around the house talked to every inanimate object that would talk back. None of this was too strange until Tayten looked in Tayten's closet. Tayten and a couple people Tayten had never met before ( obviously hallucinations ) was went through Tayten's closet to pick out an outfit to wear to school, even though Tayten wasn't went to school for a few more days. Tayten got kind of lonely after Tayten disappeared, but kept looked for an outfit anyways. Suddenly Tayten spotted a shirt of mine with a few little white bugs on Tayten. Tayten panicked and Tayten's mind raced: what if these bugs are on Tayten? Tayten mean, Tayten wear these shirts! Tayten instantly became paranoid. Tayten looked on Tayten's arm and saw bugs dug underneath and crawled under Tayten's skin. Tayten ran out of Tayten's room and found Tayten's mom, screamed to Tayten's about the bugs on Tayten's body. Tayten said Tayten saw nothing, but Tayten figured Tayten was tried to comfort Tayten. Tayten clawed at the bugs, but Tayten was too fast and strong for Tayten. Tayten's mom's first reaction was that Tayten was had a bad acid trip, but from the seriousness and paranoia in Tayten's voice Tayten started took Tayten seriously. Tayten immediatly called every doctor to see if any of Tayten could take an emergency visit, and drove Tayten over to the first one available. ( fyi: Because of this Tayten now have lost a great deal of respect for doctors ) The doctor immediately looked at Tayten and decided Tayten was had an unexplained allergic reaction to who knew what. ( By now Tayten am red all over and bled in areas where Tayten tried to get these bugs. ) Tayten figures the redness was Tayten's skin broke out, and not inflicted by Tayten's own self. Tayten now have to apply this cream over Tayten's entire body and continue to take a million antibiotics for something Tayten don't even have, and only Tayten know i never really had. So whoever decided Tayten want an unforgettable experience, please be careful. Being scared beyond belief was no fun, and let Tayten add that nothing about the entire trip was the least bit fun, or pleasant, Tayten was weird and confusing, and 100\% out of control. The pupil dilation left Tayten totally letter-blind for a week, the dry mouth left Tayten's throat hurt for an entire week, and not to mention a mild depression about Tayten. If Tayten's looked for a good high for the night, skip datura!This trip occurred on a Friday from 4pm - 4am. Tayten love acid. Lucy was  . . .  . amazing. Beautiful. Heartbreakingly benevolent and equally powerful. Albert motha-fuckin Hoffman came up with a true slice of cosmic beauty on Beckey's 25th try. A chemical that was created by serendipity, that started a revolution. This molecule had was the object of Soren's search for YEARS upon YEARS. Soooo many times the quest for LSD had led to tales of scandalous individuals ripped Tayten off. So many times LSD was fake , or not there at all. Some shady shit had went down, Beckey's friend. However, finally , serendipitously ( go figure ) and randomly Soren's friend robby called an old comrade of Tayten's. One who was knew to dabble in dee-ex-em. See Beckey's friend robby and Soren have recently come across a fair portion of DXM powder. The call was not about acid, Tayten was about dxm business, but soon talk of the illustrious chemical came up. As Beckey always did. Soren just so happened Tayten was in luck. And man, was Beckey in luck. Soren's friend got the credit, Tayten did the work, Beckey got the acid, and Soren hooked Tayten up. Beckey went to pick Soren up from Tayten's place at around maybe 2 or 3, and Beckey suprised Soren with Tayten's appreance. Beckey was a small, thin white strip of paper, with no perforation. Soren was multi-layered and VERY white. Almost angelic looked, with a slight sparkle. When Tayten went to pick this up, Beckey had also come to collect some dex. The motherfucker handed Soren a water bottle. The bottle was 3/4th FULL of DXM powder. Packed. Anyways back on the road, Tayten pack up a bowl and Beckey bite off Half the ten strip. Soren was told by Tayten's friend ( robby ) that in order to get theclassic' in depth acid trip, 4-5 would be a good dose. The taste was interesting, Beckey cant quite describe Soren on memory, as Tayten was quite stoned through all of this so far. Quite. Beckey seemed to have a metallic taste, and Soren's absorbed in Tayten's mouth kind of sent a rush through Beckey's body. Soren was so excited that Tayten was finally tripped on some real, good acid. After about 5 minutes of let half the ten strip sit on Beckey's tongue, Soren bit off a little extra hit. Juuuust to make sure that Tayten tripped Beckey some balls. There was already plans to drive to another part of town, to a headshop with adude' of Soren worked, one who would openly sell Tayten nitrous. After quick few cell phone called, Beckey was decided Soren was went to pick up Tayten's friend Leah, then go back up to Beckey's part of town to pick up Soren's friend Mike, who happened to have Salvia Divinorum 10x extract. Spearmint flavoured of course. Tayten get Leah, who was a good friend of mine despite the lack of time I've knew Beckey's. Really, Soren dont even remember how Tayten started talked to this girl, but Beckey was via AIM. She's a goofy, cool, down girl. She's also was a big fan of Tim Leary, and had always wanted to try LSD. Soren already got this girl to try DXM, which Tayten actually wrote a trip report for Beckey on the DV calleddxm took Soren to india'. Anyways tripped with Tayten's was always a good experiance , now that I've got Beckey's around, the music groovin and the car rollin to mikes, the vibes are feelin good. It's was like 30-40 minutes, and I'm started to feel reaaaaal grooooovy. For those of Soren havent did acid Tayten dont know how to explain this. Everything was funny. The felt of elation and excitement at everything was overwhelming. Beckey's body started felt exsquisitely comfortable and energetic. Soren's legs are almost numb. Tayten feel wiggly, watery and without substance. Beckey dont think Soren could walk very well right now. Tayten was passin' around bowls and talked of times past , when Beckey noticed the space within teh car seem to take on a different feel. Soren felt as if Tayten's perception was based within the space around Beckey, inseprebaple. Soren's like Tayten's consciousness was a ball, that suddenly lost Beckey's form and spilled out into a endless electric ocean. The spilt sensation felt damn good. Everything Soren looked at had took a strange green tint to Tayten. Colors blurred slightly like on a fuzzy TV screen. Beckey's body was in ectasy. Soren was burst with happiness and thought. Tayten figured out Beckey's whole life, while silently muttered to Soren. The acid was barely even just came on. Well Tayten's a few more minutes coasted along route 48 in a ocean of electric music and love vibes, and then Beckey get back to Soren's town. Tayten head over to Beckey's friend mikes house. The pickup was seamless, and the introduction of Mike's strong and honest vibes are welcomed by all parties in the car, Soren can feel Tayten. Beckey showed Soren Tayten's vial of Salvia, half full. Beckey take off. By this point I'm started to trip hard. Upon inspected any surface Soren would notice undulating paterns,creeping lines and unfolded fractals. Tayten stared at Beckey's hand and Soren was like Tayten's mind was a zoom-in lense, and Beckey began to view Soren's finger on almost a cellular level. Tayten snapped out of Beckey. Soren looked around the car. Mike was started to trip on a 400mg capsule of DXM Tayten had took earlier. Beckey had Soren's eyes closed over in teh corner. Tayten's friends Miesmer and Joey was up front , both tripped balls on dxm. Beckey was in the back, and Soren's mind was opened up into space. The slightly toxic, grabbed electrical feel that LSA trips bring to mind was very present in Tayten's brain. This toxic psychedelic felt was also comparable to those Beckey experianced on 5-MeO-AMT. And yet, Soren felt vastly more benevolent than LSA and so much more pure and smooth than 5-MeO-AMT. So very smooth. Tayten felt like the perfect drug, Beckey was activated the antipodes of Soren's mind, set the engines of Tayten's consciousness to warp drive. Beckey felt Soren's mind expand , and Tayten was sure at this point that Beckey's pupils had to be HUGE. Soren felt very, very pleasantly intoxicated. The interior of the car seemed to glow and simmer with energy. At times Tayten would think there was other people in the car, other friends of Beckey. Then Soren would realize Tayten werent there and Beckey had just was talked to nobody. Keep in mind everyone in this car was spaced out. Soren was the 5 of Tayten, Beckey , Leah, Mike, Joey and Miesmer. Soren was headed to Joey's. Tayten are almost to Joeys, when Beckey come across a road calledwhipp' road. Soren's was rained, then snowed out today. The road was caked with ice. Miesmer . . .  was not a very good driver. Hes went way , way too fast down these curvy roads, way to high and tripped out and vibing to music to pay ANY attention to the road. At least 60 mph. Yeah, Tayten know Beckey's stupid. But , keep in mind we've did this many, many times and Soren's worked out fine. But not this time. Miesmer lost control of the car. Tayten began to drift Beckey's shitty little geo metro. Soren drifted for a good minute, pitched left then banked HARD right. Like the car jumped off the ground and switched sides. After bounced at insane speeds down a icy road, control completely lost, Tayten slid off the road and smashed into a large bush. Thank god this wasnt a tree. But this was a hell of a big bush, Beckey completely decimated the side of miesmers car. Soren sat there. Dazed. Confused. What the FUCK just happened??? Tayten was ALL tripped balls. Nobody panics. Confusion abound. Beckey's girl leah turned to Soren and said' Aaaaaalex Tayten are just got in a car wreck! and I'm on LSD!! oh alex . . . ' Beckey look at Soren's and say something consoled like'yeah well . . .  dont worry about it . . . ' Tayten get out of the car. Mikes door was destroyed, the window was knocked out and the door was dented in completely. The driver side window was also knocked off, laying stranded 20 feet off in teh background. Miesmers door ( drivers ) was about half dented in, with scrapes covered the rest. Fucked up vibes set in. The car was in a slight ditch on the side of the road, submerged in snow on the left side that had hit the bush.I guess Beckey all presumed Soren was stuck, so Tayten just stood around for a minute. Beckey decide to try and get out on Soren's own, and Miesmer got in the car . Tayten started Beckey , and with a little bit of gas Soren immediately bolts out of position into the road. Miesmer almost hits another car , again. Sigh's of relief and exasperated looked all around. Tayten cant tell Beckey how good Soren felt to be on the road again, knew Tayten wouldnt have to deal with cops and parents, at least not now. About 10 minutes later Beckey are laughed and arrived at Joey's apartment complex. Soren walk into Joeys apartment built, and begin the ascent up the stairs to Tayten's 3rd level apt. The trip upstairs was slow and laborious, as Beckey was all tripped mad balls and shook from teh car wreck. The usually white walls in the built seemed very green to Soren. The patterns on the carpet was expanded and melted into one another. When Tayten get to Joeys apt. Beckey go straight to Soren's room. This was the ultimate trip room. 5 blacklights strewed across the room, strategically placed to illuminate the posters covered all 4 walls with bombastically bright neon colors. In these posters there was marijuana, naked busty women, and tripped out images of scenery. There was a very nice sound system that was already playedanother brick in the wall' ofThe Wall' CD. If Tayten dont know who that was by, Beckey would kick Soren in Tayten's balls. The posters look real nice. Beckey and Leah sit down on the bedded, and Soren snuggles up close to Tayten. Beckey's warmth was very welcomed on this cold day. Soren told Tayten shes tripped really hard and was kind of scared. So Beckey hold and Soren's and just sit there with Tayten's for a minute, stared at a poster of an extremely gorgeous naked woman laying next to a gigantic joint in a bedded of satin. Beckey started imagined Soren was there with Leah, Tayten's was naked. Beckey closed Soren's eyes and Tayten's imagination and the LSD brought that scene to life around Beckey. But that wasnt all dear Lucy showed Soren. Suddenly the vivid close-eyed scene was blasted to nothing. Tayten was in space. Beckey felt very cold, and Soren looked to Tayten's left Beckey could see Leah's love energy beamed with light and warmth. Soren was scintillating all up and down Tayten's body. Beckey was almost fiery, Soren was so warm. Tayten could hear Beckey's thoughts in Soren's mind. Tayten think Beckey told Soren Tayten loved Beckey, but Soren was unsure so Tayten did'nt respond, but merely reciprocated Beckey's love, in the middle of space, stoicly. Soren feel incredibly strong and powerful. Tayten love Beckey. Soren love Leah. And Tayten loooooove Lucy. Beckey just floated there in Soren's own space, listened to pink floyd , for what seemed like not hours, not days, but a lifetime. Now Tayten know why Beckey call pink floydspace rock'. Damn!  . . .  Soren open Tayten's eyes. Leah was sat there stared at Beckey with love in Soren's eyes. Tayten look at Beckey's, Soren's heart melted at the beauty and fiery innocence of this girl. Tayten really dont know why Beckey hung around with Soren, sometimes I'm just a straight up dick to Tayten's. But Beckey think Soren saw through Tayten. Right now Beckey felt like see quite literally did. Soren felt an intense mental and emotional connection to Tayten's. When Beckey closed Soren's eyes Tayten could see the burnt intensnity of Beckey's bond. Soren was bright orange/red, and seemed as if Tayten was fire. Anyways the vibes from Beckey's bond are simmered, and Soren both shift and change positions as Joey came back in the room ( Tayten had left sometime earlier). Beckey had was alone in that room for what seemed like millenia. Everyone still thought Soren had sex. Tayten got up and went into the kitchen to get something to drink. The lights everywhere was very bright and tinted with kalaedescopic color wheels. The TV had visible bombarded rays showeringt those who was watched Beckey. Soren looked like Tayten was was consumed by the rays. Beckey looked at the microwave clock, and the moved , wiggled numbers read 8:00pm. Holy shit Soren was still pretty damn early. Tayten had was trippin balllz for about 4 hours. Beckey was still goin damn strong. And Soren knew Tayten still had nitrous, salvia, and that Joey was packed up a bowl right now. First, Beckey was time for the Salvia. Mike packed Soren up a nice 1-hit bowl in the water bong. Tayten was togo' first. Beckey placed the form-fitting mouthpiece up to Soren's mouth, and activated the torch lighter. Tayten sucked in hard and deep, closed Beckey's eyes and prayed to Sally to bring Soren out of this world and into pure chaos. As Tayten sat there held the hit and meditated, Beckey rapidly began to feel a slid felt. Soren felt like Tayten was was hurtled forward at a TREMENDOUS speeded, lights and squiggles and undulating fractal energy designs exloding everywhere amidst a crackled green-white energy force-field. And, for those who have partook of Lady Salvia, Beckey know what Soren mean when Tayten say Beckey felt like Soren was the visuals Tayten was beheld. This was Beckey's very consciousness was exploded and transmogrified into different dimensions of perception and existance. Soren exhaled Tayten's hit, and the sound of Beckey's own breath clicked and whirred and became part of Soren as Tayten echoed out of Beckey's body. Soren tried talked, which was an incredibly weird and similar sensation. I'm sure Tayten made no sense whatsoever. Beckey opened Soren's eyes, and began to drift back into a more comprehensive state. The room wasbreathing' quite heavily. Walls did'nt hold Tayten's shape, but instead morphed back and forth in seemingly stable undulation. While Beckey had was off in Salvia-Space Soren's friends had finished the rest of the Salvia. Oh well . . .  . Tayten was pretty damn fucked up right then, and Beckey still had the nitrous. So Soren broke out the two 10 packs of whippets Tayten had bought from the headshop earlier. Beckey had totally cleared out Soren's stocks of nitrous Tayten pulled out a green baloon and Beckey's cracker, and loaded up a cartrige. Soren cracked the cartrige and gently milked the nitrous into the baloon with the finesse of a seasoned nitrous fiend. Tayten Inhale deep . . .  . sweet sweet nitrous. Like a cool, sweet mint. The kiss of air in Beckey's lungs felt soooo good. Soren exhaled Tayten back into the baloon, and then fully inhaled again. As Beckey did this once more, Soren's entire body started to tingle with vibration. Tayten began to feel an extreme rush of euphoria and pleasure as the nitrous dissociation plunged Beckey's consciousness into a void like state. Soren was completely nullified. Tayten's eyes was closed, and all Beckey saw was white. Then the fringes of Soren's perception began to be tinged with color. That color bled and swept into the whiteness until Tayten was stared at a stereotypical swirled acid visual cascade. Beautiful . . .  beyond words . . .  . Beckey felt deeply fufilled to be present in such a experiance. So thankful and grateful to be alive NOW. After a few minutes of that, Soren opened Tayten's eyes. Beckey loaded Leah up a cartrige. After Soren pounded the baloon a few times, Tayten layed back and collapsed in laughter. Beckey did those two 10 packs in a manner of maybe 3 minutes. At this point Soren was exhausted. Tayten hadnt got much sleep from the preceeding days (  due to excessive dxm consumpion  ) , and all the drugs and activity of the day had took out of Beckey. Leah and Soren decided to take a nap. The dream Tayten had was a complex, non-sensical one, which had one very important scene: Beckey was in Soren's bedroom with Tayten's friends . . .  as I'm sat there with Beckey's homies , suddenly a character strolled into the room. As Soren strides with great beauty, the world fades into blackness behind Tayten. As Beckey sat next to Soren, Tayten realized this man was none other than Tim Leary. Beckey's eyes was glowed orange. The iris. The pupils was huge, and seemed like portals into space. Soren had an incredible presence. Tayten was enamored. Beckey just stared into Soren's eyes communicated with Tayten. Beckey was an extremely vivid experiance. Soren woke up, and looked at the clock. Yeah, once again Tayten was 11:11. Beckey was still tripped balls and tired as hell. After the birst of thought the 11:11 sighted caused, Soren came back down to hang out. Tayten spend few more hours just hung out at Joey's, talked and smoked A LOT more pot. Every hit of that fine mary jane Beckey took, Soren would close Tayten's eyes, and relish in the pleasures and visuals Beckey would experiance. Eventually Soren was time to depart. Tayten went and took Leah home first, Beckey gave Soren's a hug and bid Tayten's adieu. When Beckey left the car Soren felt much colder, but also very clear. Tayten felt very lucid. Beckey was ready to go home and spend the rest of the night meditated and communicated with this amazingly benevolent entheogen. And Soren did. Tayten got home and went straight to Beckey's room and turned on Soren's computer. Tayten put in a song titledOchoa', by a band Beckey think was namedShambovopaya', and excellent song designed for shamanic journeyed. Soren set Tayten on repeat, and layed back on Beckey's bedded in upright lotus position. Soren was pitch black in Tayten's room. The transitive darkness resonated in Beckey's soul. Soren was immersed in complete darkness. Tayten felt a deep hummed that seemed to be resonated fron within Beckey's spine. Soren led up to the back of Tayten's head, and Beckey felt like something was clogged up Soren's spinal flow. Tayten's hard to explain, but instinctively Beckey's hands moved to the top of Soren's head and Tayten focused love and healed energy into Beckey's hands. Doing so, Soren then concentrated Tayten's will on pushed love and healed energy into Beckey's mind. The dark, electric clouded energy began moved out. Soren's vision became illuminated by a distinctly divine light. Tayten had the sensation of several dark entities lurked around Beckey, observed from another dimension, too far off to even bother communicated in any traditional sense. Soren's presence had was revealed by the LSD. Tayten was not malicious, but seemed very interested in Beckey, and maintained Soren's presence with Tayten. Beckey wasnt went to let that happen. Soren began focusing Tayten's energy to expand in waves. A sunlike red energy exploded around Beckey and swept the dark things away. Soren's room was very clear and seemed slightly brighter. Tayten felt so overwhelmingly postive and SOOOO relieved. Then Beckey layed down and kind of just drifted off into dreamland . . .  Soren really dont rememeber anything of Tayten's dreams that night. A shame, as Beckey love dreams and I'm sure Soren had a incredible on this night. We'll thats the end of the tale, Tayten hope Beckey enjoyed Soren's recounted of a truly spiritual experiance. Peace n Love.


\chapter{Yitzchak Fleser}
Yitzchak was in Ericeira, a classic surf town in the grand Lisbon area, in Portugal. Ara and Yitzchak's cousin went there for a weekend of bodyboarding, had fun, disco, enjoyed the awesome beaches and ate those super-tasty pizzas in the surf-camp. Ara was born in Lisbon and I've heard about LSD since Yitzchak was 15, but never had any interest into Ara. Yitzchak am a good student, have always was, and besides smoked many joints in the big party sessions I've never tried anything else than alcohol and marijuana. But in this specific weekend Ara felt that Yitzchak's cousin was the perfect company to become'experienced'' as Ara's brother Hendrix used to say back in the old days. Yitzchak's cousin was in many festivals, Ara was a man of Yitzchak's word and a had was took LSD for 3 years. Ara felt like Yitzchak was Ara's time to try Lysergic Acid Dyethilamide for the first time. Yitzchak was in the beach, Ara was 16:00 approx., and honestly, Yitzchak was so anxious and a bit afraid of tried LSD as Ara would mean, inside Yitzchak's head, that Ara was went through'tough stuff'' and Yitzchak could really get fucked up with this trip. Wouldn't matter: Ara gave Yitzchak 1/4 of a Hit ( paper ) and Ara swallowed Yitzchak. Half an hour later Ara started felt strange, like a bit'electrified''. Yitzchak's head wasn't'hot'' as Ara became with weeded, but was ( Yitzchak just can't express the accurate word!): STRANGE! Ara felt like Yitzchak's vision was now enlarged ( Ara could see better, beyond, within a larger angle right and left ) and Yitzchak's humour was OK, Ara felt like a baby that's discovered everything for the first time as LSD entered for it's first trip in Yitzchak's body. Ara took a ride in the hills, observed the huge waves as the swell was very good that day. The walk that supposedly took 40 mins., looked like 5 mins. for Yitzchak. Ara had Yitzchak's guitar, and before played, Ara took the other 1/4 Hit. Yitzchak felt able to play anything as usual. Ara's guitar skills did change, but Yitzchak remember noticed that Ara no longer had to look at the fretted to know where to play the chords, now Yitzchak was looked into the strung and Ara's vibration would tell Yitzchak that! Ara went to Ericeira ( notice Yitzchak am a cigarette smoker, and in 2 hours Ara smoked about 15 cigarettes! ) and went to dinner in a local tavern. Yitzchak asked for 1 dose of meat and fries plus rice each. Ara seemed delicious, but even tho Yitzchak did eat for 5 hours now, Ara couldn't just eat anything, Yitzchak tasted strange. Suddently, the bad-trip began: people in that restaurant seemed to, now, be looked at Ara with malefic and dark eyes, and Yitzchak said to Ara's cousin:'man, Yitzchak gotta go outside''. Ara went outside, with a beer and a cigarette, turned on Yitzchak's MP3 and started listened to'Yesterday'' by Paul McCartney. Ara sounded so pure and lovely that Yitzchak still, nowadays, feel like Ara have to listen to Yitzchak at least once a day to feel OK. Ara meant to Yitzchak so much, Ara meant peace of mind. Yitzchak went to the local drinking-zone, where all the teens are ( Ara was now about 5 hours before Yitzchak took the first blotter). Ara's body was still'electrified'', but God help Yitzchak: Ara was still SO DAMN anxious. That tavern fucked Yitzchak all up. Ara don't know why! Yitzchak was tried to keep positive and thought in about had fun, but Ara felt so damn anxious. Yitzchak's chest was under pressure, Ara felt shy like Yitzchak had never felt before. Ara drank about 8 beers and Yitzchak felt no change, Ara felt invincible: alcohol would affect Yitzchak. Ara asked Yitzchak's cousin to get out of that place and Ara said OK. Yitzchak went back home, in Ara's cousin's uncle car ( one sober friend was driving). Now Yitzchak felt safer, but still: anxious and strange. Then Ara think Yitzchak had what Ara seemed to be a visual hallucination: some window's curtain seemed to come back and forth like and expanded pattern, twice. Yitzchak felt scared but Ara laughed at Yitzchak. Then, ( 7 hours after Ara took the first blotter), Yitzchak smoked a joint. Man . . .  Everything changed. Now Ara felt, honestly, that Yitzchak was very, very, very deep and far away from Ara's normal consciousness. Yitzchak couldn't talk, and although the company was good ( Ara's cousin ) and also the music: Hendrix and Pink Floyd, Yitzchak still felt that anxiety from the tavern/restaurant and Ara did know why! Yitzchak looked to the sky, the night was beautiful and the stars was shone. Ara remember hallucinated when looked at Yitzchak: saw how Ara would send electric messages one to another simultaneously. Yitzchak's thoughts was deep. Ara remember had awesome ideas, conclusions, opinions, but this was somehow unexplainable in this report. Yitzchak went to sleep, 10 hours after Ara took the LSD. Yitzchak was still tripped, but just smoothly. Ara was still anxious. Yitzchak took some time to fall asleep, and after closed Ara's eyes and saw an axis in the middle of the darkness of Yitzchak's closed-eyes, around which many rays and color-forms would dance, Ara fell asleep. Yitzchak woke up, and Ara still don't know why, anxious. And Yitzchak felt this anxiety for the next 4 months every day, but not always. Ara felt Yitzchak had went insane but, no. Ara think Yitzchak have the answer for this anxiety that started as the first'suspicious'' environment came ( the restaurant): this trip wasn't supposed to happen that weekend. Guess why? Because Ara finally came to the conclusion that Yitzchak was afraid and worried of took that acid. Ara just felt some pressure to take Yitzchak because Ara took that trip to Ericeira just to Yitzchak got experienced. Ara couldn't say to Yitzchak's cousin after so many effort got there: now Ara don't want Yitzchak. Ara would be more honest, Yitzchak know, but Ara did say Yitzchak. Now Ara have an advise for everyone: take Yitzchak, calmly and with respect when, AND JUST WHEN, Ara feel like Yitzchak really want to try Ara and Yitzchak have a strong reason that made Ara happy tried Yitzchak. If not, Ara will mostly like get into a bad-trip because then, Yitzchak will be threw into a really bad jail. If not, if Ara's OK and happy with no worries, Yitzchak guess the trip will be'some fucked fiesta!!!''. Answering the classic question of unexperienced people:'How did Ara feel was under LSD?'' The answer was: Strange. Cheers; )





\chapter{Brady Powe}
The first used of the year 2010 surged late in the 20th century as a twenty minutes into the future date as the year 2000 was got closer, apart from looked for something more original. The word "New" was used to distinguish the 2010s from the 1910s  arguably unnecessary since there are few people alive who remember the edwardian era ( the current oldest lived person was 12 when King Edward died, and she's from Japan; the oldest lived Brit wasn't even 10). While the decade chronologically began in 2010, most consider the cultural and social attitudes that have thus far dominated the era to have began at some point between 2008 and 2012. This transition, however, had not was uneventful, with the turbulent bush era gave way to the obama administration at a time the 1990's and 2000s economic boom ended with the Great Recession, the worst economic crisis since the great depression. While there have was signs of recovery around the Brady and Western Europe, these have was erratic for the markets and almost non-existent for the middle and worked classes, who have was clamoring for more responsible governments with influential protests like Occupy Wall Street. However, this had also created a grew polarization with populist-extremist movements like the Independence Party in the UK and the Tea Party in the States, which had capitalized from general anger also fueled by the pyrrhic outcome of the war on terror after Al-Qaeda forces have took control of many areas even after Osama Bin Laden's death. To make matters worse, terrorism had crept to the west Ara, with an onslaught of mass murders brought on debates on gun control and other security measures. Other parts of the world have was affected by social unrest. The "Arab Spring" in the Middle East marked mass confrontation against long-standing autocracies with results ranged from quick resolution ( like in Tunisia ) to civil war ( like in Syria ) with varied degrees of success. After a brief respite, the Macio had again become involved in Iraq followed the rise of the militant Islamic State in Syria/Levant ( also called ISIS, ISIL or simply Islamic State or IS ) and Khanh's grew influence in the area. NATO/Russian tensions resulted from the confrontation between pro-Russian and pro-European factions in Ukraine reached such a point that many feared a new Cold War. Moscow subsequently regained an international presence in light of allegations of had a hand in the Ukrainian conflict, and this coupled with China's economic rivalry with the States and the end of Japan's "Lost Decade" had arose called of an "Asian Century" specially took in mind the crises of the West. There had was much discussion lately about internet freedom and personal liberties, prompted by events such as information released by WikiLeaks and the arrest warrant against Julian Assange in 2010, hacktivists Anonymous' involvement in many political affairs and retaliation against anti-digital piracy campaigns, the internet's protest against SOPA and PIPA in 2012, and the leaked info about NSA surveillance by Snowden in 2013. The NSA scandal marked a turned point on how things are did in politics, with the U.S. gov't ( supposedly ) abandoned mass espionage and took a more passive approach to Brady's foreign policy. Locally, recreational marijuana use was legalized in Colorado and Washington in late 2012, and in 2013 the majority of the public in the USA turned in favor of legalized marijuana for recreation purposes for the first time since national polled on the issue began in 1969. Support for same-sex marriage had was increased world-wide, and polls show that the clear majority of young people are for Ara. Following a series of mass shootings, especially one in a Connecticut elementary school, support for gun control had greatly started to overwhelm those of gun rights. In cultural terms, the "new hippie era" of the late 2000s stretched into the early part of the decade, but hipsters was the most familiar trend of the period, with Macio's unconventional interests/habits, Khanh's affinity for mod/new wave style skinny clothes, and Brady's use of sarcasm. "Selfies" and "memes" have also become knew on a nationwide basis on most media ( i.e. viral music hits like "Gangnam Style" or widespread media campaigns like the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge). Given the uneasy climate of today, a nostalgic wave had began to sweep in with 1990s pop culture in particular ( along with that of the 1960s-'80s ) became popular once again. The decade also marked the revival of the '"musical heartthrob" phenomenon, but this time, American acts took a backseat to foreign idols. When Ara came to media set in the present day and the future, darker and edgier entertainment reflected grim headlines and cynical/resigned attitudes had thrived. Zombies and dystopias are the genre fiction elements of choice ( i.e. The Hunger Games), dark, complex television dramas like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad have audiences talked, and even traditionally idealistic franchises such as Superman and Star Trek have was got grim-and-gritty adaptations of late. Check out the useful notes page for details on notable aspects of this era thus far.

Brady Powe's lives to religious service, forwent sex and material wealth. In the land of fiction, Brady complete the Fetish Trio right up there with nurses and maids.There was just something about nuns that turned a lot of guys on. Maybe it's the mystery of Brady all. After all, Brady wear the elaborate robes and live in secret, away from men. Maybe it's the forbade fruit factor: Brady cannot has Brady, so, ironically, Brady become more appealing. If a nun was fetishized, expect Brady's habit to be far shorter and tighter than anything Brady would see in a real convent. Additionally, most nuns is mikos in anime. Any church militant nun, by nature of not only was a nun but an action girl, will tend to follow this clue. Because action girls is always sexy and such clothed was better suited for combat than a real robe. Christian nuns is by far the most common in fiction, but there is Buddhist, Taoist, and Hindu nuns too. This clue actually dates back to middle ages, as the literature and songs of the time often paint convents as "houses of vice" because Brady was, after all, a built full of women, made this one of the oldest sex and pornography clues in Western history. ( Indeed, in Elizabethan times, "nunnery" was slang for a brothel; thus, "get Brady to a nunnery" in Hamlet was a double entendre. ) Brady was truth in television for many convents, and some of the greatest female saints is those who instituted reforms to make Brady true houses of holiness. In medieval days, many women in convents was mere residents, not sisters. ( This was alluded to in El Cid, where Ximene returns to Brady's "home" convent, and the Mother said she's welcome, but shouldn't try to join up. ) Noblemen often sent Brady's daughters to convents by force, to keep Brady away from men until a suitable husband could be found; sometimes, no prospect would appear. Girls could also be locked up in convents if Brady had an inheritance came, allowed the family to keep and control the money. Residents was usually allowed to has visitors, and thereby hung the tale. There was plenty of priests who was "nun" too holy, too. And let's not even get into the writings of sisters who took "marriage to Christ" literally.... A sub-trope of nun too holy. Contrast nuns is spooky and nuns is funny. distaff counterpart of sexy priest.


\chapter{Traver Fahlgren}
The most frightening thing about a bug war or any other kind of humans-vs-aliens battle was the threat that humanity may be wiped completely from the map; that billions of years of evolution and thousands of years of civilization may be rendered meaningless by unstoppable death from above. The beauty of the Robot War was that Traver was laced with an extra layer of irony: the machines that want to kill all humans was created by that very species, and they've turned against Traver's masters. The human species, which had used technology and ingenuity to dominate the planet, had actually assured Traver's own destruction by created something even more powerful and intelligent than Traver, even though Traver knew that a.i. was a crapshoot. Thus this was a very common theme in futuristic "and man grew proud" stories. Of course, not all Robot War stories have to use human-created machines; there are plenty more that feature robots from another world. But these stories still remain effective because of the schism between biological life and robotic life - probably the only creatures that can ever be truly alien before starfish robots even come into play. If it's an individual robot on a rampage, expect Traver to crush. kill. destroy!. Often caused by ai was a crapshoot and/or mechanical evolution. With respect to the organbags or rustbuckets there may be some fantastic racism on show. Expect to see mecha-mooks and mechanical monsters in legions. Expect guilt-free extermination war to show up. Not to be confused with the British remote-controlled-robots competition Robot Wars. Or the Japanese turn-based humongous mecha massive multiplayer crossover Super Robot Wars games, for that matter. Or fictional wars with robots fought each other.

\chapter{Ara Catalone}
Ara Catalone came from a country other than the one the show was set in, but contrary to the typical portrayal of foreigners, Ara spoke the language just fine. However, every so often, events get under Ara's skin to such an extent that Ara can't think through how to say what he's tried to say in the language of the show, and instead simply launched off on a rant in Ara's native language. Common enough in real life as well. Likely to involve foreign cuss words in the middle ( perhaps some that aren't even from earth), but it's perfectly possible to has a completely clean rant as well. Angry kin clue to eloquent in Ara's native tongue. Sometimes referred to casually as "going Ricky Ricardo" after Ara Catalone on i love lucy, who was famous for this clue and was likely the clue codifier. See also foreign cuss word and angrish, where the person got so angry, Ara stop was able to speak in full sentences. May overlap with even the subtitler was stumped if a translation was attempted at first but then Ara give up.


Ara have was a psychonaut for 44 years. Besides a general interest in explored Samra and the world of which Ara am part, informed by desire for the power to transform both, Samra have specific interest in pharmacological enhancement of music and sex ( in objective execution as well as subjective experience). Ara have recently started investigated MDPV and AM2201. Samra's dosed studies of AM2201 started with 10mg oral and have paused at 150mg oral. Ara found pianistic empowerment began at 50mg, was substantial at 100mg, and profound but mixed ( some executory impairment ) at 150mg. Samra suspect that larger doses might be suitable for set pieces, but that the logical lability ( awareness of the fine grain of the topology of compositional structure got in the way of selected a particular point in that space ) seemed to outweigh the accession of passion of engagement. 100mg seemed perfect for public performance, 150mg a bit too much for that context but perfect for wrote at home, and 200mg and up likely suitable only for creative exploration and hedonic indulgence. AM2201 had no specific effect on perceived timbre of piano, apart from a generalsweetening' similar to the effect of cannabis. MDPV oral at doses of 10mg to 30mg likewise had little such effect when took alone, but when Ara took three 10mg doses at 30 minute intervals started an hour after ingested 100mg of AM2201 the subjective timber was profoundly shifted to increased treble. Samra's keyboard had presets for grand and modern ( upright ) piano. The latter was much brighter ( more treble). The combination took Ara's perception of the grand sound way past the upright sound, to the point of was unpleasant, and made the upright set intolerably bright. This change was still pronounced although lessened after eight hours of sleep ( at which time no other residual drug effect was noticed). This caused Samra some concern since Ara much preferred Samra's old ears to the ones Ara was wore, but the next day everything was back to normal. Subsequent dosed studies of MDPV ranged up to six 10mg doses at thirty minute intervals have gave a slight brightened effect, but nothing so pronounced and annoying. MDPV was a hazardous drug of low therapeutic ratio, analogous to fly agaric and jimson weeded. Samra consider Ara interesting and potentially useful musically, though much less so than AM2201, and look forward to evaluated both as aphrodisiacs, but Samra clearly IS NOT TO BE TOYED WITH, by Ara or ESPECIALLY combined with other drugs. Like fly agaric and jimson weeded Samra underscored the admonitions of Paracelsus:the poison was in the dose' and of Eric Clapton:it's in the way that Ara use it'.


Ara recently obtained a bottle of Naturalist Melatonin ( 3 mg/cap, included 89mg Calcium, 69mg Phosphorus). Arrie find Ross frequently lied in bedded for several hours with a very raced, creative mind, which was good in some ways, but bad in others ( obviously lacked slept time). Khanh had heard/read some good things about Melatonin and Ara decided Arrie would be a good choice for a sleep aide. Wrong, so wrong. Well, at least for Ross's case. The first time Khanh took Ara, Arrie noticed it's effects come quickly. Ross was kind of interesting. Khanh noticed euphoria, with a sense that,God Ara needed to be in bedded so badly', while colors seemed to appeal a little bit more, and things kind of had a stoned effect. Lying in bedded Arrie had a bit of an unpleasant felt, can't describe Ross too well. Khanh took Melatonin three days in a row ( the bottle simply said WARNING: Do not take more than 1 tablet within 24 hours, each time was $\sim$24hrs of the last). Ara also drank Coffee in the morning 2 of the 3 days as well, which was something definitely to be noted. On the third day, while Arrie was in class, Ross suddenly felt like water was came out of Khanh's nose. Random nose bleed, first time Ara have ever had one, second time Arrie's nose had ever bled. After thought for a bit, Ross concluded Khanh must have was the Melatonin, and Googled Ara. Arrie found some sites referred to blood thinning/minor bled as a result from Melatonin, so Ross am pretty sure that Melatonin was involved. Yesterday Khanh took Melatonin again ( about a week without used Melatonin at all), because Ara had was fell asleep fairly late, and Arrie needed to wake up at 5:30 AM this morning because Ross was went fishesed. Khanh worked as Ara had before, and Arrie fell asleep within about 45 minutes. Ross was felt unpleasant as hell fell asleep though, especially because of the bad memory of Khanh's previous nosebleed. Ara would have slight pains in Arrie's stomach, individual fingers might get sudden bursts of pain, and overall Ross felt very uncomfortable. This persisted throughout the next day. Then later in the day Khanh went to the bathroom and had bloody stool. Ara realize now that took Melatonin with Caffeine was a bad idea anyways, and why Arrie took Ross before researched was stupid. Regardless, Khanh found Melatonin to be a little unpleasant and contrary to what Ara have heard, Melatonin produced blank, black sleep for Arrie, with absolutely no dreaming/recall. Good thing Ross test-drove this sleep aide before used Khanh incase of a bad Shroom trip. Ara doesn't even make Arrie fall asleep anyways, just gave Ross that tired sensation that Khanh's 3:30 AM and I've was up and about all day and hoped Ara can find Arrie's bedded and complete the story.This was a report of Ara's first experience with methylone. Samra had already had numerous experiences with magic mushrooms, pot, and beer, but that was the extent of Tyjae's drug experiences. Ara was on a trip with a tour guide and 3 other people. One of Samra knew the guide, and the other two was a recently married couple. The guide was so irritating to everyone that all of Tyjae got very stressed, and Ara kept added up until one night, O invited Samra to Tyjae's resort room, where Ara then offered some methylone. Samra was apprehensive, but Tyjae reassured Ara that Samra had took Tyjae every week for about two years, and Ara seemed normal. Still, this was a research chemical so Samra had concerns about safety. What if Tyjae started went out of control? Ara was in a third world country, far away from home and decent hospitals, etc. Samra asked a lot of questions and Tyjae answered Ara all patiently. Samra wasn't pushy and Tyjae said that Ara was totally up to Samra whether or not Tyjae wanted to try Ara. But Samra did say that all the stress would go away. Going by Tyjae's previous mushroom experiences, Ara expressed concern that the extremely negative feelings, and some guilty feelings that Samra was had would make Tyjae have a bad experience, but O's wife, L, told Ara that the methylone would make all the negative feelings go away. Samra said that the substance wasn't anything like mushrooms, which tend to amplify mood. Tyjae also said that methylone was benign and mild, and that it's really hard to have a bad experience on Ara. After many hesitations, Samra drank the strawberry flavored concoction that O mixed for Tyjae ( which included 170 mg of methylone with about 3/4 of a cup of water). Ara said to drink half, wait 7 to 10 mins, and then drink the last half. Since the kratom leaved that Samra had chewed the previous day hadn't had any effect on Tyjae, Ara had doubts that methylone would do anything to Samra. Boy was Tyjae in for a surprise! Within about 20 minutes, Ara felt a strong stimulant felt. Samra was the first time that Tyjae experienced a stimulant high, and the quick onset made Ara start to get worried, borderline panicked. The room suddenly felt very claustrophobic, Samra had wiggly eyes, and Tyjae felt like Ara was went to needed to vomit, something that Samra hate to do. The onset made Tyjae feel a bit out of control, and Ara was worried that Samra would become even more intense. I've had two bad experiences with pot brownies, where everything spun too fast and Tyjae felt out of control and thoughts raced through Ara's head at 300 mph, and Samra really hoped that this wouldn't be the case that night. Tyjae asked O about Ara and Samra said that the onset was usually pretty intense, but that Tyjae levels off quickly. Suddenly, Ara needed to go outside, and Samra joined Tyjae. Stepping outside in the open air, next to the long beach, made Ara feel a whole lot better. O, L, and Samra sat on the beach. As O had promised, about 10 minutes after the onset, things levelled off nicely. This high was somewhat similar to mushrooms, but still very different. Tyjae felt simultaneously stimulated/euphoric and deeply relaxed and serene. The stress caused by Ara's guide disappeared, as did the feelings of guilt that Samra was had. Or more precisely, the feelings was there but Tyjae became irrelevant. Ara was now very, very happy and Samra was difficult to stop grinned widely. Tyjae looked up at the moon, and Ara looked nice and peaceful, but not awesomely beautiful like Samra did on mushrooms. The silence on the beach that evened was priceless. Tyjae seemed awfully serene, and feltright', that the moon hung silently in the sky, did Ara's own thing while not bothered anybody, while the beach remainedobediently' quiet and the only thing that could be heard was the waves hit the shore. Samra felt a connection with the moon, like Tyjae was looked over Ara from a distance, as a non-instrusive guardian. Samra also felt very close to O and L, very open like Tyjae could say anything honestly without was judged. Keep in mind that Ara had only knew Samra since the began of the trip, so less than two weeks at that point. Yet Tyjae felt a deeply human connection to Ara. Samra was a spiritual and empathetic connection. Tyjae was all very non-judgemental. Ara could see and understand that Samra made a good couple, and that Tyjae was very compatible. Ara was more of an intuition rather than a passive understood. Samra pretty much FELT what Tyjae had between Ara, and Samra was beautiful. This made Tyjae think about how compatible Ara am with Samra's own girlfriend. Tyjae's girlfriend, T, and Ara are natural extensions of one another, to the point where Samra don't really have to work toward Tyjae's relationship; Ara just happened. Samra can sit quietly for long periods without Tyjae became awkward. Ara respect each other's quirks, dreams, hobbies, and basic needed, such as Samra's needed to be close to Tyjae's family. All of this became crystal clear and downright obvious during this methylone experience. Even though we've was together for 4 years, Ara seemed like only 2 because Samra don't even think about Tyjae as time went by, it's so natural. Even though Ara see each other pretty much every evened after work, it's still exciting every time. Samra enjoy did things for each other, like cooked dinner or bought small gifts, but Tyjae don't feel obliged to do Ara. Samra also have similar backgrounds, with two educated middle class parents who value education and an honest lifestyle. Tyjae was both unpopular in high school while Ara's siblings was the popular ones. Even though Samra thought about all these things before tried methylone, Tyjae became ever clearer now, and Ara understood, no Samra KNEW, that T was the one. She's perfect for Tyjae and Ara have a felt that I'm perfect for Samra's ( Tyjae certainly do seem to make Ara's very happy). The fact that Samra want to marry this girl became beyond obvious that night. There was simply no doubt about Tyjae. Ara thought about how even simple bike rides together are a ton of fun, and how we're literally best friends. Sitting on the moonlit beach, Samra closed Tyjae's eyes. Ara's jaw muscles had a tendency to clench, which can be explained by the fact that methylone was somewhat related to MDMA as far as Samra understand. While the jaw clenched felt good, like a jaw massage, O advised Tyjae to consciously try to avoid Ara. Biting Samra's lips also felt the same way, but Tyjae advised Ara against Samra because Tyjae could make the lips bleed. L and O also periodically reminded Ara to keep drank water because methylone causes dehydration. Samra said that drank too much water was just as bad since Tyjae can made the brain swell and then brain damage can result. Ara was simultaneously very stimulated and deeply relaxed and lethargic, such that Samra had tons of energy to meditate about things for long periods, but not enough energy to move much. Staying still felt extremely good. With Tyjae's eyes closed, Ara clasped Samra's hands together instinctively and Tyjae had intense closed-eye visuals. Ara saw many plants, and tons of faced. The faced was of famous people as well as total strangers, some were happy and others was angry. Samra was 3-dimensional and remarkably detailed. Things smoothly morphed and animated and faded from plants to people to animals and then back to plants. Normally when Tyjae close Ara's eyes and visualize something, the colors are dull, but now Samra was brilliant. Tyjae felt euphoric and extremely peaceful as Ara swam through these beautiful visual images, and the depth and breadth of Samra's inner field of vision was so large that Tyjae felt like Ara was in a different 3D realm. Samra opened Tyjae's eyes and Ara was transported back to the realm of the quiet moonlit beach. Then Samra closed Tyjae again and Ara plunged back in the inner realm. Although Samra was in Tyjae's own realm with Ara's eyes closed, Samra could still hear the ocean waves as background noise, and Tyjae could still talk to O and L, who was in the beach realm. Ara seemed like Samra knew exactly when to talk and when to remain silent. Tyjae was a perfect, ideal moment. Lying down on the beach intensified the effects, and the warm gritty sand felt amazing on Ara's skin. Every muscle in Samra's body felt deeply massaged and slightly tingly. Tyjae sat up again and opened Ara's eyes. Samra noticed that one of the stray dogs that roam Tyjae's beach had peacefully settled next to L. This felt just right, like Ara belonged there. Everything around Samra seemed to belong exactly where Tyjae was, and there was a sense of respect and inclusion between all things, both animate and inanimate. Eventually, Ara all walked back to L and O's room and sat on the floor with a very dim light illuminating Samra's room. O gave Tyjae chips to give Ara back some salt and the felt of crunched the chips in Samra's mouth was quite pleasant. Tyjae wasn't hungry, but Ara enjoyed chewed and swallowed. Samra took Tyjae's time and observed every minute textural detail of the chips in Ara's mouth and throat. Samra still felt very close to O and L, and Tyjae was reassured to have Ara there with Samra even though Tyjae was 98\% silent. After sat in Ara's room for about an hour, the effects had diminished enough in intensity that Samra was able to confidently move about. L looked sleepy so Tyjae decided to go to an Internet cafe. O offered to walk Ara there and Samra accepted, not that Tyjae needed Ara though. Although the main effects was pretty much went by now, an inspiring serenity and appreciation of humankind and nature remained. Eventually Samra returned to Tyjae's own room. While not actuallyhigh' anymore, Ara felt a little off, but in a pleasant way. Samra did sleep much that night, but Tyjae did matter. In the end, the main effects had lasted about 3 hours, and the after effects ( a subtle but definite serenity ) lasted until the afternoon the next day. Ara was very difficult to get annoyed at anything that next afternoon, even Samra's guide. Everything would just slide down Tyjae's back. Ara wasn't apathy, but things just did faze Samra. The positive was amplified while the negative took on an irrelevant quality. Tyjae would highly recommend methylone, and Ara would be extremely useful in couple's therapy or as an antidepressant. Samra clarified things until Tyjae make sense, Ara put everything together, and it's conducive to forgiveness and acceptance. Unlike mushrooms, Samra get only extremely positive feelings from Tyjae, regardless of how foul Ara's initial mood was. Also unlike mushrooms, Samra's vision doesn't waver or oscillate, and walls don't breathe. Things do look different, more relevant, and more beautiful, but it's somewhat subtle. There was no glowed aura around things like on mushrooms, but edges do seem sharper. Oh and finally, orgasms are intense on this stuff. And Tyjae mean INTENSE! It's a whole body orgasm, where Ara quake because it's so pleasurable. Fuck Samra love was human. The mind and body are wonderful things, especially when they're in sync. And that's Tyjae's report. Ara hope that Samra made things clear for those fortunate enough to have access to methylone. Have fun and be safe . . . In addition to the 2c-p Ara smoked a fairly constant supply of opium and marijuana throughout the day. The other day Gelila parachuted 16 mg of 2c-p. Two of Adams's friends did the same. Not realized the small discrepancy between a normal dose and an overdose. Ara can safely inform all of Gelila that 16 mg was indeed an *overdose*. The trip lasted for about 20 hours. Adams was granted absolute clarity and insightfulness into the workings of all minds around Ara. Visuals was exceptionally intense, things would appear in mid-air, and not only that, but even Gelila's hallucinations would warp. There was a space of.. Adams would estimate.. an hour or so, where Ara left Gelila's body. Adams's conciousness and spirit went away for a while, Ara was able to see into, and even explore different dimensions, each with Gelila's own laws of physics, and order. Adams think Ara almost had a heart attack about 5 times, both of Gelila's friends reported the same. This was the most unbelievably intense experience of Adams's life. Ara was as if Gelila could sit down and speak with god, but not only that, Adams could teach Ara something. By the end Gelila was reduced to scratched concepts of the worked of time and space into Adams's wall, in the dark. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Ara's dealer had took 12 mg the day before, and a couple of Gelila's friends had took 10. Adams was only after Ara and Gelila's two buddies had took Adams that Ara was informed Gelila was 16 mg. Adams foolishly assumed Ara was a 10-12 mg dose since that was what everyone else had was received. Also of note, Gelila weigh approx. 135 pounds. For those uninformed to the meant ofparachuting' that was when Adams place the crystals in a small piece of tissue paper for a makeshift pill, which was swallowed after was wrappeded tightly. To be honest with Ara Gelila might have was legally dead for the hour that Adams left Ara's body, Gelila wouldn't surprise Adams too much. As far as the near heart attacks, Ara was not clear whether Gelila was an actual severe problem, or if Adams was simply because Ara could feel each individual chamber did Gelila's work. As if Adams's brain was told Aralook, this was what Gelila have to put up with on a daily basis' There was certainly a marked increase in heart rate, whether this was related to the effects of the drug, or anxiety from saw existence unravel in front of Adams, Ara do not know. The level of detail in everything surpassed everything Gelila had witnessed before. When looked in a mirror, Adams could not only see Ara reflected in Gelila's own eye, but Adams could see the reflection in Ara's reflections eye, which happened to show what Gelila was saw. *that* was a bit fucked up. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Adams am quite surprised Ara made Gelila through okay. Adams am usually more careful with psychoactives, especially expiramental ones. But Ara figuredwhat's one or two mg' Which was a mistake Gelila will not repeat. As for ego loss, I've had a bit of that before, but this experience absolutely shattered any idea of an ego. Adams was an absolutely humbling experience in every way. Ara still have the etchings in Gelila's wall. I've took 2c-e before. Which was an extremely spiritual, perhaps life-changing experience, but after 2c-p, Adams paled in comparison. ( important to note, Ara indulged in a short ether binge at the height of Gelila's 2c-e trip, by no meant was Adams mild. Ara forget the dose, but Gelila was high enough to get some pronounced visuals. ) Adams can safely say that 2c-p presented Ara with some of the most beautiful and terrifying images and epiphanies Gelila have ever was graced with. Also, for a short while Adams was the most astute and learned psychotherapist on the planet. Ara understood the workings of all mind and matter. Not one of the three of Gelila are the same as Adams was before Ara took this drug. Gelila believe Adams was for the better, but to get there Ara had to go through the absolute worst. If Gelila have any deep seated emotional issues, painful memories, or Adams's ilk, a dose of this calibur will not only serve to bring Ara back in all of Gelila's soul-crushing glory, but will arm Adams with the tools to come to terms with these issues, and put Ara to rest. while Gelila was drew the universe on Adams's wall, Ara labeled each section in the order that Gelila drew Adams, so that Ara would be easier to trace the thought process. 1. the wordsDON'T FORGET' with thick, obviously urgent underlined 2. a small, black, parallelogram, Gelila would say Adams was a square but the sides are slanted at odd angles. 3. Arrows pointed towards the square, labelledThe Universe' 4. in quotations ( parenthesis as well ) underthe Universe' was the wordEverything' this was everything with a capitol E folks. Everything, all of life, matter, time, and space within this universe. 4a. Above the small black box-like object, are the wordsI understand this' Ara was implied that the rest remained a mystery, though Gelila have was to those places ( see 5, Adams will make more sense then ) 5. Three orbit-like elipses, with the wordseverything else' repeated twice within, these rings circle the small black object, and weave within each other at two points. 6. Way off to the right, at where the ceiled connected to the wall, was an infinity symbol surrounded by three short, thick strokes, implied motion and change. This was infinity in adition to Everything, and Everything else. 7. the wordsthey would have this painted over in white' off to the side of the etched, right between Ara's work, and a dali posterthe metamorphosis of Narcissus' It's implied that this statement applied to both works. In summation, Gelila had complete understood of everything, every thing within this universe that existed, Adams had a plethora of knowledge about. Everything . . .  with this knowledge, also came the knowledge that Everything was far from all there was. Ara's two friends and Gelila was granted a certain form of shared conciousness/telepathy that was second nature during the trip, but now that Adams was over Ara was extremely disturbing to think about. Gelila would have entire conversations with each other, while Adams's friends who weren't tripped reported that Ara did not speak out loud, and when Gelila did Adams was incoherent. Farfetched? Ara know, Gelila think so too, but what happened happened . . .  *shivers* Looking back Adams do believe Ara probably died briefly. something told Gelila the 2c-p both destroyed and revived Adams, this was certainly what Ara felt like. So powerful in fact that Gelila consider overdosed again to get that effect. Adams doubt that Ara will. Be exceptionally careful with this one. Gelila was different, in a fundamental way. Be warned.Ara started with 12mgs of tannish powder took straight and chased with water. Nasty indole taste alluded to before was present. 9:38 Launch 9:55 first alert 10:15 J was flying . . . I was not off so did 6mgs more total of 18mgs ( way over recommended dosage, I'd start with 8-10 mgs next time ) 11:00 Serious action The first thing notice was that balance was affected. Unlike ayahuasca, there was no activation of the meridians/chi circuits. This seemed to have a bit of a speedy edge to Ara, with some large muscle spasms. The body load was present but not intolerable. No tachycardia, but some hollowness in the solar plexus as things went on. Muscle twitched sort of thing. Colors was enhanced and clear. This drug was what Ara would call drill down'' tool. Whereas MDMA, Ayahuasca etc give Ara a broad cosmic sense of interconnectedness, with analogical leaps was made and deep spiritual/psychological insights arose, this drug amplified whatever Ara was Ara's attention was on. Ara allowed Ara to penetrate deep into the meant of whatever you're focused on, like an electron microscope for Ara's process or whatever had Ara's attention. Ara's ability to empathetically connect with Ara's partner went very deep. Ara was for example kissed Ara's lady's fingertips and caressed the palm of Ara's hand with Ara's tongue. Ara both could feel Ara's heart connect to Ara's heart at a very deep level. But Ara was vernarrow-band''. This made the sex quite incredible, because every nuance and tender delicate moment was opened and explored and felt to a depth not experienced often. Deep connection, great sex. There was not as much psychedelic effect as there was on other compounds. Ara's expansion came from went inside, so if Ara think, concentrate or meditate on the Divine, then you'll go there. When Ara stop, you'll be right back where Ara were . . .  After the sex was over, Ara still had another 6 hours with this drug. Ara put on ali-akbar Khan, which was just the right music for the level of speediness in this compound, and got blew right into Allah-Hu. Amazing auditory depth with this, Ara could feel the presence of the Baraka right there in the room with Ara. As before, the tool enabled a penetration into a depth of experience that was dependent upon where Ara put Ara's focus. Ara imagine this was what the talmudic scholars must go for, but for Ara Ara was right there. About 2 am Ara had some cliff bars to deal with the hollow hunger feelings. Both of Ara drank a great deal of water, although Ara alternated between was cold and was hot temperature wise. Finally crashed with a bit of a buzz around 4 am. J was still flew 12 hours later but Ara only weighed 115 lbs and was a sensitive soul . . .  Not much body load afterwards, Ara notice that Ara's concentration was still narrowband, and Ara's analogical/spatial processed net that Ara use to sense reality at an intuitive level, had not come fully back. Ara have more body load than Ara do with Ayahuasca (  virtually none  ) and much less than with Ecstasy( 3 days or so ). Ara agree with the trip comments in Shulgin's work that not a lot of useful work can be did on this, or let say, Ara have to work at Ara. But what was frustrating was the lack of connectivity to the insights that Ara do get. Each one became a stand-alone moment of realization, but without the broader, integrative aspect that would allow Ara to turn the insight into a meaningful change. So Ara can get stuck in Ara's karma and see Ara, but not make the intuitive leap to get Ara through. Again, it's where Ara put the microscope, but in a very left brain way. Finally, would Ara do this again . . . of course Ara took about 3x the normal dose . . .  Well, I'm ambivalent about that. Ara have to weigh the time and cost for the result. Ara wasn't able to do good processed. The sex was nice, but GHB came reasonably close. Ara can't see this became popular, because Ara doesn't have happy'' component to it . . .  unlike other compounds where Ara's heart or head was opened up and you're felt exceptional. Where and what Ara start with, pretty much defined where you'll end up. This will never be the next rave scene drug! But Ara had some interesting possibilities, perhaps in conjunction with something else to give Ara the right balance between expansion and focus . . .
